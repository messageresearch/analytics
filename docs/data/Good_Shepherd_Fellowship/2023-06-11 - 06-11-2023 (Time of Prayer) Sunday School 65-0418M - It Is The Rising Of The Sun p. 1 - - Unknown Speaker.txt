========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] a bird singing like their own Hearts research Joy because there is an Easter we believe that you raised up Jesus from the dead many years ago today and we celebrate this Memorial Day and let there come on Easter among us all today may we as disturbance understand his word that we were in his Fellowship then and that now that we are risen with him and setting together in Heavenly places bless the service here in the Tabernacle and across the lands where it goes by this telephone may it be an Easter for them also and an exodus from sickness onto strength and those who are dead in sin and trespassed may they live today through Christ and we'll praise thee for we asked it in his name amen I certainly deemed this a marvelous privilege this morning to be back here in Jeffersonville Indiana with this great congregation the church packs and standing in the round and outside and in the lots of every word to you people on the phones Across the Nation It's a beautiful morning here five o'clock this morning my little friend with a red breast blew up at the window and woke me up he's like his little heart would burst and he is risen I've always thought of this little bird being a friend to me because I like him the legend about him says the little brown bird saw him suffering on the cross for sin had placed him of course the little bird had noticing it has to die for the little bird but he flew into the cross and tried to pull the nails out a little bit they got his breath all red and that's the way I want mine too as this Shield of trying to protect the Glorious thing that he died for realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone I would like to call your attention this morning to a a picture that some time ago was taken by the camera Vision that I had here at the Tabernacle of leaving Indiana to Arizona where I was to meet in a form of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when I got there thinking it was the end of my life but no one could stand the blast and I'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in sabinia Canyon one morning like this while in prayer there had been a sword placed in my hand and said this is and stored of the word later the Angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where I was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air and around the circle like the wings of the angels and drawed into the skies the shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared Scott stuck the picture all the way from Mexico as it moved from northern Arizona where the holy spirit said it would be standing 40 miles Northeast of Tucson and it went into the air and Life Magazine packed the pictures of Mystic something way in the Spheres where there can be no moisture where there can be no evaporations or anything 30 miles high and 27 miles across and coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know science the or one of them is Tucson wanted to know any significance but I didn't tell them you all do it all beforehand but it wasn't for them and so there he spoke to me and said Seven Seals will be open the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible is Saint Paul and closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings a hearing those Mysteries marriage divorced serpents seeds all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by God himself that's opened those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last day and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the on the plaque but then I have the picture League present here if you notice as Life Magazine had it but I wonder if my audience visible here as ever really looked at the picture and a way it should be you remember I was preaching when this Vision came upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges where we see Jesus in Revelations 1 when we started to open Seven Seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seventh field Christ was standing with hair like wool White and I described that to you that the old English judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably stiff in the audience it's Christ these eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig a dream deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes his nose his mouth just turn the picture from this way they had it this way the way can you see it his Supreme judges none other but him and that is a perfect identification again of vindication this message is the truth and making him not a third person but the only person maybe White so you can see the darkest faces near his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to on the cross that's where he looked to the right where he pardoned The Sinner and the blight of his resurrection still go forth in his name I wish this morning that I had just much time to stand upon these phenomenas that's beyond any Shadow of Doubt it's been proven for the past 30 years or 35 years right here at this church that's down on the River on that same light came down here in Jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message before on the second we're at the end time and we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the Earth Maybe sometimes we'll have a chance to explain that if God willing now I want you to turn in in your Bible as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word I always read that because if my words is the word of a man it will fail but the word of God can never fail now we're going to to read from the holy scriptures a text and we want you to turn first uh to uh three places in the Bible that I have chosen to read from one of them is in Revelation the first chapter and uh 17th and 18th verse this is where he appeared with his hair white as wool and his feet was like brass and then I want you also to get in your Bibles Romans 8 11. I've chosen this morning three places to read from the holy scriptures for my message today that the Lord is placed upon my heart for the resurrection and then I want you to also Mark 16 1 and 2. there I will draw my context now in Revelations 1 18 we read these words a 17 and 18. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and more dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and Hell and in Romans the eighth chapter and the 11th verse we read this but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and now in Mark the 16th chapter the chapter of the Resurrection the 16th chapter the first and second verses and when the Sabbath was passed Mary maganese a mother and Mary the mother of James and salami has brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the suppleter at the rising of the Sun now my text this morning I want to take for a text it is the rising of the Sun and for a subject I want to use the quickening power now you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speak in our Noble brother Neville this morning speaking his Easter subject uh on the resurrection and I thought maybe I would take it a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle or use the scriptures every angle you go with the Scriptures it always declares Jesus Christ you cannot get away from it any way it always declares now as the world today in a memorial service or at least in the United States and this side of the Earth this morning and the churches and throughout uh celebrating a memorial of of the greatest Triumph that man ever has I think as savior when he died or as an infant when he was born he could not being here less being coming into the Earth and when he died shortly he atoned for our sins but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many men who have suffered and died for a real cause but there never was one that could raise yourself up again until this day now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all times this Easter is where he proved what he had said man can say things but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proved to be the truth and as God who said prove all things hold fast to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that he would not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sins and now not only is it a Memorial Day of all these great Easter flowers Easter bonnets and the pink rabbits and so forth that we've got into and holy celebrations which is all right but this is not the real thing and that way as people today are trying to say we should worst beat once a year on on uh Thursday now on Friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines and they argue about where they should be this day or that day or what should be established they are the first day of the week or all these things are just merely traditions what good would any of it do you where you had lit or not lit if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which is nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their Traditions but left off the main thing Satan doesn't care harm religious you are a how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that line yours won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if God raised up Jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this Resurrection morning only uh one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this are are we benefactors of his resurrection what does it mean to me what does it mean to you not we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago now to find this text as I was tired my arm hurting me from shots that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days and I'm but have these shots not enough and with calorie yellow fever and everything I was pretty weary making me sick which seizure requires to have these shots before you go into the other nations and he said give Caesar that which is Caesar but then give God that which is God and as I was sitting there wondering what would I speak to this waiting audience this morning which I'm very thankful for and man and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say how should I do it what should I take for a text and then while I was sitting there almost asleep my door rattled out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as I knew I listened I didn't get it just right after a while the den room door where I have turned into my study it rattled and someone kept shaking the door and I I went to the door and opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow-haired blue-eyed girl standera looked like a little Easter flower a steady here looking at me now she handed me a card and it was the uh uh of course I guess when I get home there'll be Easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that I'd received and she said brother Branham this is from Daddy and me sure be sure that me was in it and or arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair had sent this card when I took it and thanked the little darling as she turned and walked away from the door I opened up the card and in the form of this car I drew my text for on the card was the Saint March 16 1 and 2. shut up the sun was Rising and then I thought of that and then the subject of the quickening of Jesus Christ to be raised up from the data through my subject now the Sun at the rising of the Sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and was born and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved up on that water and said let there be light God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word first life that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let's bear be life and there was like that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy life upon the Earth then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion and that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the sun rose and swept across its raised and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning this time with the sun leading into the sky it brought forth a greater Sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this thunder rise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this Sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth more to life but this time when the sun rose that was a a dual sun rising another sun rising it was a not only if you in Rising it was a s o n had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promise seeds that by foreknowledge his seen laying upon the Earth no more could the the botany life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than the day when sons of God is up on the earth it takes a s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world on Easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the Earth and In Heaven There was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that they're called this son of God raised it would also raise the life every son that was for our days to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious Sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at times when it first gone now this great breaking of the Easter seal now [Music] foreign [Music]
