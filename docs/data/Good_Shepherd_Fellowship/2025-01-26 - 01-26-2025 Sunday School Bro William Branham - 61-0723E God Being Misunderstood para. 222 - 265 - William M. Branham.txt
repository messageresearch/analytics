[Music] when the all night and went away how could they see a man a man that they had know to perform Miracles and raise the dead yet submit himself to death and walk up through there beating and crying just a spit run off his face and blood mixed with it where it put the handfuls of beard out plucked it from his face and wared his back till his bones of shining through and kicking him and beating him around them cussing drunken soldiers beating him around up the street and stand and let him do that they misunderstood so they stood far off righty Hallelujah the devil misunderstood him the devil said surely that cannot be a Son of God that would stand there and be mistreated like that and I'm cussing and my disciples down there just treating him any way and him taking it he's not the Son of God also the Pharisees the priest misunderstood he said if if thou be the Son of God bring yourself down off of there the thief on his left misunderstood you that if thou be the Son of God take us off the cross save yourself and us too but the thief on the right understood him he said we hav we've done evil and we deserve what we're getting but this man's done nothing Lord remember me when he come into your kingdom watch that voice come back today shall thou be with me in Paradise hallah he understood that that was God dying for our sins the only way he could die would be put to Death In the Flesh he can't be put to death in spirit because he's an eternal spirit and he had to be in flesh to be put to death so they just misunderstood he understood it one day about 10 days after that about 40 days after that 50 days it was the disciples climbed up into an upper room and they stayed up there for 10 days and night until the 50th day comes then all all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind because Jesus had told him behold I send the promise of my father up you but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high they know that it was going to come I they know it was had to happen go up there and wait until I send it they waited up there they confessed got everything out of their minds and hearts they were waiting all in one accard in one place waiting for the promise walking back and forth the man men and a women up there walking around together in this upper room all the doors barred so the Jews couldn't get in and hurt them all once they was up there walking around and there came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind wh down through there and the licks of fire begin to set up on them the doors flew open the windows come open out into the streets they went and they were misunderstood amen hallelujah in so much as they said are these men not full of new wine these people are drunk because we hear them blabbering off something we don't know what they're talking about all at once and said how hear we ever men in our own language are not all these galileans they misunderstood that it was a promise of the father then God had a prophet there who could stand up and speak Peter said you men of Jerusalem and you that dwell in Judea don't misunderstand this this is that which is spoken up of the Prophet Joel and it'll come to pass in the last days sayth God I'll pour out my spirit upon all the flesh upon my hands maids and made servant I pour out of my spirit they shall prophesy I'll show wonders in the heavens above and and the earth below and fire and vapor and pillars of smoke it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved am it was a work of God it was the Holy Ghost but they misunderstood it he was misunderstood has always been misunderstood Israel misunderstood him the people in Noah's time misunderstood him the people in Daniel's time misunderstooding the people in John's time misunderstooding the people in and the prophet's time misunderstood the people in the Pentecostal age misunderstood him the people in this age misunderstanding it's still the same they don't get it because he's misunderstood it's trying to compare the natural with the spiritual when the people in today at Pentecost when it's all filled with the Holy Ghost had this great big meeting up there they called a man down there crippled from his mother's womb two of them was going along the street and this beggar shuck a can and ask for some money and he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I'll give it to you am he said in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth stand up and walk and he took the man with the hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength he began walking and leaping then running and jumping and praising God went into the temple and all the people began to come together and scream and the carry on was unusual and they put them in ja and threatened them that they should not preach anymore in the name of Jesus am Peter said who should we listen to God or man and they turned them loose thinking because they whipped them a little bit and threaten them if they'd hang them the next time or burn them or put them on the cross or something they'd stop it but the next thing they found is right out on the street doing it again why they misunderstood was them people it was God in those people doing those things right amen when they caught up little Stevens at the Sanhedrin court that morning said we'll take him before this court when all these rabbis and Jews and high priests and holy fathers and all of them together out there these doctors of idty it'll scare him into wits so they brought him out in these chains and stood him out there a little fell like a lamb hun a bunch of Raving wolves they said watch him take down now and say I'll take it all back brother don't you all bother me he said you stiff necks uncircumcised my heart ear why do you resist the Holy Ghost like their father so do you amen they found out that it wasn't him yes boy they picked up clouds and throw their hands in their ears and begin to Nash up him and clot him to death and when he raised his head up towards that in the bats beating him from one side of the head other he said I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God hallelujah amen hallelujah and he fell asleep in the arms of the Lord Jesus when he died he said father lay not this sin to their charge yes see they misunderstood what they did Paul standing there look at it later on it got on his nerves and said I'm the least among all them because I bore witness to Steven's death thy Sint amen hallelujah that's it see people misunderstand this enthusiasm people misunderstand today hallelujah amen they misunderstand the power of the Holy Spirit they call it a bunch of Hool rers they call it a bunch of people that ain't got their right mind they misunderstand that you have to lose your what you call your right orderr because you have the mind of Christ you can't have the mind of the world in the mind of Christ at the same time one's carnal and the other is spiritual he that walks after the flesh is carnal walks the spirit is spiritual so I Lose Myself and find Lord inl yes sir amen so God's misunderstood it's not you that's misunderstood it's the Holy Spirit making you do that that they misunderstand amen they're not speaking against you they're speaking against him people are misunderstood now they go let them go but they get right back in the street and start again the same today they misunderstand the people they don't know what it is amen today I misunderstood in my Ministry that he sent me to the people they misunderstand me everyone of them said We Believe brother R I talked to a preacher a while ago said brother R we all know that you was sent to the church but the idea is how do you come baptized in Jesus name they misunderstand the scriptures they misunderstand it that's what he sent me for that's my purpose being here why do you teach the serpent seed and things like that that's contrary to what we teach well brother that's why I'm here they just misunderstanding amen but God is bearing record by his word and signs of the Holy Ghost matter how much misunderstanding God's confirming the word amen God's always been misunderstood and those who live with God are misunderstood with God because it's God working amen you believe it amen I [Music] love he first love do you love him raise up your hands and say [Music] praise just my Sal [Music] [Applause] [Music] are you glad you misunderstood amen we used to stand a little song saying now marked marked marked marked by the spirit Divine that's right people that once love me turn their back on me now because I'm marked marked by the spirit amen I lost my mind to the things of the world to receive the minds of Christ therefore if I have the mind of Christ my mind seeks those things which are above I'd like for somebody show me any different correct baptism besides the name of Jesus Christ I like for somebody to show me a scripture that says a serpent didn't have a seed I like for somebody to show me a scripture that says there's three Gods amen then they say well why is it God sent his message and Bears record of it amen he confirms the word with signs following amen hallelujah that's what the Bible says hallelujah they can't deny that no it's a fact but what do they do they misunderstand it because I didn't come in the name of the Assemblies of God the Oneness or the Tess or the threeness or the Church of God or the Baptist Methodist presbyter and Luther I'll come in none of their names I come in the name of Jesus Christ am and God by his Mercy confirms the message by the power of the Resurrection Hallelujah so it's still the spirit of God that the people misunderstand that's right misunderstood sure you misunderstood all that live Godly in Christ Jesus is misunderstood all the way from righteous Noah all the way down to the modern day Saint today is misunderstood always been Hallelujah people misunderstand it Israel misunderstood it they don't understand they just can't because they are carnal and spir not it won't deviate with the spiritual because it will not make it but I'm glad that we live in a kingdom that's not made with hands of man I'm glad that we're going to a kingdom that man had nothing to do with I'm glad that our kingdom is above and if our kingdom is above we're born from above then we seek those things which are above
