at sister nin's house and then after that one we have not done anything for the couples praise the Lord amen brother B says uh uh family is the backbone of the church the same as is the backbone of a Nation praise the Lord and uh uh we we love to strengthen our you know our family life encourage one another because there's never been a time where there had just been so much pressure so much battle on uh on home life because if they enemy can destroy that then we we really don't have church because the church is at home home amen just like our brother said on Wednesday we bring Church to church amen I hope you brought Church to church amen I hope you brought Church to come and have church you have to bring Church to come and have church amen praise the Lord if you don't have church at home you'll just be staring and you'll be sleeping and you'll be wondering what's going on so uh uh you know we we we want to take a leap of fi I know it was a late call and we want to take a leap of fi and and see what uh uh but it it turned out that the Lord is giving us favor I heard a few of the the the Saints From Grace Ministry call in that there will be coming so that that uh that help us amen that will help our numbers like we have like we have always said amen you know uh uh we we plan these things and then we realize that we don't have people to have them but it it's not going to deter us from doing what the burden that we have to do amen if there is just one person that will that will be blessed from it that is our desire amen just like we said last week it's God that gave names you try to make name it will fail amen God has to make name and he make Name by the character that he build in us the things that he take us through that's how he makes make name and after all it is his name praise the Lord this morning I want to talk on their Redemption money their Redemption money I want to talk about money but I was trying to find a way what cannot praise the Lord before it looks like I'm chasing after your money so I just say let me find something so I can talk about money amen so I can so this morning I'm going to talk on the Redemption money actually I entitled my my my S by of me God that word by of me God I want us to get you see because the church has traveled in the long uh uh uh deceitful in some sense or ignorant understanding of the word and it have either either either limit us or erupt us because of how we are understanding the word praise the Lord by of me gold is so easy for people to start selling hanger shaps and start selling water and start selling prayer you know like I shared with you one time I was driving somewhere and I saw the church put a billbo or prayer for free I've wonder when was prayer sale on sale amen they had prayer for free I drove I turned around I came back I said let me make sure that I see this prayer for free when was it on sale praise the Lord and uh uh so uh uh that that that concept you know will make people to think that well I mean this is the law saying by of me what what wrong should it be and and I will tell you thatth the the early church the Catholic Church Reign on most of these things that's how they soow uh Indulgence in many things to people because of this but one thing we have to understand that uh most of our truth meaning of the word was Lost in Translation and that's the reason why the Holy Ghost have to return back to the church amen and God has to send us a prophetic Ministry to be able to bring us truth understanding amen truth understanding or SSE I mean and we will we will we will we will not appreciate what God has given to us amen yeah we will not appreciate what God has given to us because if we were to buy from God think about buying pardon and think about buying Mercy do you realize that in the early church uh uh seats in the church was on price the poor people did not have seat in the church they either stay to the back so whether the man was in church or that this was his seat this was his family bench they pay for it uh uh every month it was Josh Miller uh uh one of Revival is that rebuke they out of the Church of England praise the Lord the wealthy had their seats they pay for it every month even though we don't pay for it year but I don't think we must have particular seats amen if you come here tell you love a favor place to sit sit there but if someone is sitting there then find another place to sit love the Lord amen so I mean there was lot of things that were lost in translation I'm telling you if if if we never had the word restored if God never started doing the work from Luther and bring wesle with sanctification and restore the gifts for us to be here where uh uh uh uh the Divine interpretation has come to the word I mean uh we all will be worshiping one Idol or another because there are a lot of things that are lost lot of things that are lost amen a lot of things that are lost and what the church did over the years is to make you to feel that you have to earn your salvation you can't earn it you can earn it and you see when brother Bram says the the M the Bible became a new book we not changing the word what makes it new is because Divine interpretation has come toon understand to help us to understand what is written in the in the pages of the word we say that salvation is individual Affair who is the individual are you the individual it say your Affair when did it begin your Affair he is the individual it is his affair it's not your Affair when did it became your Affair the day you join the church then when you decide not to serve God is not your Affair anymore it was never your Affair in the beginning and a lot of those things just you know they just so so you you we we you we we find ourself keep keep working and keep trying to do something instead of appreciating and embracing what God has given to us and when we fail we don't blame the word we say Lord I know I have a fallen nature but your word make a promise that I can overcome this and I take what your word says then to rely on my ability because whatever you are relying on your ability for is going to fail and God will make you miserably fail until you realize that you need his grace praise the Lord so so when you look at this word by of me the word actually carry the sense of exchange exchange Jesus used that word what will you give in exchange for your soul because that was the principle of buying in the beginning the battle system was exchange there was no money I bring this I I want to I want this glasses and the only way I can get it I give you a goat or I give you uh H something they equal the value of this so what we do is that we exchange so that is the sense that the word is so God is saying to loudish your age you think you are rich you think uh you you you need nothing but let me tell you if you can just exchange your miserably condition if you can exchange your miserably condition and let me give you character so every service we come to that's what the Holy Ghost is doing he want you to give up something in your life and take something from the word that's the father's business he's a businessman every time we come the Holy Ghost comes around he want you to give up something and take something in return praise the Lord if you remember we spoke a long time ago I don't know how long it was but um on the seller of oil Jesus in the parable of the 10 virgin he says go to those men they say oil go and buy of them so that's the same principle praise the Lord that is the same principle because you will realize that in the in the in in the book of Acts Peter had to rebuke that man that wanted to buy Power and he think that he could give the Apostle some money for him to be able to buy Power and join the the the the the church but Peter told him perish with your money amen you perish with your money so if the Holy Ghost is a type if the Holy Ghost is a type of oil then what will happen is that uh uh uh you can you can you can sell you can sell it in the sense of the way we understand the word sell no you can sell it but yes it's sold it's sold in the sense that because before God gave us the Holy Ghost what he put on the table to exchange repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus that's what he put on the table that's the price he put on it praise the Lord so do you have the sense so the word thereby of mean has the sense of exchange or give in exchange praise the Lord you see and that's the reason why the church keep feeling All Through the Ages because uh uh H H I mean uh uh we we just want to go through some sensation we just want to go through emotion and work ourself up and we not ready to give up we are not ready to give up that old nature that old desire we don't we are not ready for I mean uh H uh the human the human nature is not ready for change God by his grace have to do something special praise the Lord amen we want change but we really don't want change we want change but we really don't want to be changed so that's the word and and that's why we going to we going to labor on this morning B of me God so I'm going to talk on the Redemption money Numbers Chapter 3 numbers chapter 3 there is this thing that the Lord told Moses and you'll realize there a in the first place brother W was not making this up in scriptural there is something called the Redemption money praise the Lord now Pras chapter 3 let's read from verse 14 if you read with me and the Lord said unto Moses number all the firstborn of the male of the children of Israel from a month or upward and take the number of their names and thou shal take the Levites for me I am the Lord instead of the firstborn among the children of Israel the kles of the Levites in still of all the the the firstling among the cattles of the children of is Moses number as the Lord commanded him all the firstborn among the children of Israel and all the firstborn male by the number of names from a month old and upward of those that were number of them were 20 and 2,000 20 and 2,200 and three scores and 13 and the Lord speak unto Moses take the Le VI instead of the firstborn J changed also so uh uh when God brought the people out of the land of Egypt he says all the firstborn are mine I'm going to kill all the firstborn of the Egyptians and you Jews all your firstborn are mine praise the Lord are we together are we together amen now so as the people traveled and God was settling down with them and trying to to build his ordinance around then he called the prophet Moses he says I've I've told I've said to you that all the firstborn were mine but now we going to do something here what we going to do is that you will take all the firstborn all the firstborn of the House of Israel and you're going to take all the first born of the sons of Levites and you're going to exchange every firstborn with a son of Levi are we together amen so a battle system was going on here God was exchanging the firstborn of Israel for a son of levite because now he's going to take the Levites onto himself for his service the going to self in the Tabernacle only the sons of Aaron were the high priest that could go behind the curtains but the other ones that were born as levit they had different work to do they take care of the Tabernacle some will put the Tabernacle up some will take it down because the people were traveling so God is telling Moses here now you're going to exchange every first born for a son of Levi are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord amen take the levite inste verse 45 and all the firstborn among the children of Israel and the cattles of the levite in still all their their CES and the Levites shall be mine I am the Lord and for those that are to be redeemed of the 23 scoes and 13 13 of the firstborn of the children of Israel which are more than the Levites so all the firstborn were more than the sons of Levi are we together so after you swipe you swipe you Swip all the sons of Levi will go and there will still be more first born what do we do with them God is claiming his right he said all of these are mine are we together now so we go ahead and the Bible says here verse 47 thus shall e thou shall even take five shakers a pieace by the pool after the Shakers of the sanctuary shall thou take them a sh is sted G and thou shall gave the money where W the OD number of them is to be redeemed unto Aaron and his sons and Moses took the what what are you talking on your breath praise the Lord and Moses took what he took their Redemption money so the Redemption money now will be the money that is paid for all of these other first born that were left there is a Redemption money that will be paid this will build a concept in the ordinance of Israel that we will understand are we together you love the Lord are we ready for the word praise the Lord amen you know uh H uh the word of God the the message of the hour is not is not real you know I mean we appreciate when the Lord bring things to us we learn you you know but I mean uh uh uh it's really not for learning it's for us to experience God Amen is for us to experience God if we stay with all of the knowledge and don't experience God in the Forgiveness of our sin in the Deliverance of from our habits in the healing of our body if we don't experience God all we have is in in spirit there are two spirits that what against the church one is a seducing Spirit which is an evil spirit to carry the people into immorality the next one is an enticing spirit that stop you from going to the promise it only leave you with ha knowledge you can never experience the word of God in your life it's only for those in the Bible it's for time pass it cannot happen now that's an ining Spirit he's robbing you of the blessing so the word is not only for learning the word is for us to experience it that's why Paul says if my preaching is not by the demonstration of the Holy Ghost then I'm only preaching to you inticing Spirit by men's wisdom praise the lord it's all these enticing spirit that can make people to cut the prophet and they can tell you about the godhead but yet they don't have no ground for their temper praise the Lord and with all the knowledge of the word they are stay swimming in immorality that's why Paul says you are denying the power thereof because this word has power it has power to heal it has power to deliver it has power to give us a DE decent life to restore decency so we see here God is is uh is instituting something here and Moses took the Redemption money of them that were over and above them there were Redeemed by the Levites of the firstborn of the children of Israel took took he the money 1,300 3 and3 scores and 50 sheers after the sheers of the centuary and Moses gave gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons I calling to the word of the Lord as the Lord God commanded do you do you realize that the early church when the Roman system took over the Christian Church they RAR all of these things amen praise the Lord and that's the reason why families were charged the the the wealth of family was taken from them the church Target people that was wealthy when they knew they had wealth the priest found a way to convince the father how their young daughter can be a none she can she can give her life to the service of the Lord they really never wanted to girl they wanted the riches that's right praise the Lord and these are the kind of a scripture that they were pointing to them are we together but we going to look at it yet and uh and and trust that the Lord will be able to help us praise the Lord hallelujah amen you love the Lord amen the Lord been so good to us he's been so good to us what an awesome God we serve praise the Lord hallelujah now so this was instituted in Israel so this particular ordinance this particular ordinance will make us to understand something that I believe was long misunderstood in the Bible praise the Lord now the Bible called it the Redemption money the reason why the Bible call it the Redemption money is because in God Redemption plan he had a medium of exchange praise the Lord in God Redemption plane oh I see the the newborn in church that's a little baby back there okay she's sleeping we greet her greet the sister for me praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh so we we we see here that uh uh um in his Redemption plan he had a medium now remember now he had this plan before the foundation of the word praise the Lord and in his great mind he saw how am I going to redeem the Earth how am I going to redeem men and all of that he planted so he had a medium of exchange he has something that he would give and he would take everything back praise the Lord there is only one mediator between man and God that's the man Christ Jesus so that was God medium of exchange his medium of exchange that he will become man he will identify with our misery and then he will bring us out of it are we together so you see the Redemption money all of these things God was casting it inside us because the mind of God is so deep I know the thoughts that I think concerning you praise the Lord don't even guess because you will not come close When God says I know the thoughts that I think about you don't guess just believe it because you will not even come close Hallelujah so in his Redemption plan he had a medium of exchange so God is going to play this medium of exchange through different types and shadows amen he's going to use different example to play out the medium of exchange so that's one year the Redemption money you realize how this is done let me let let me bring this to you look at the case of Jeff in the Bible Judges chapter 11 praise the Lord amen the Bible says jeffa made a vow to the Lord and he said Lord if you give me the battle the first thing that will come out of my house I will sacrifice it to you praise the Lord not knowing th will be his only beloved daughter are we together amen you see before we even came here before you made your mistakes God already made a provision for your mistakes he knew your ignorance he knew how stupid I am so he made a provision are we together here is this man that was rejected by his brothers because he was born of a gentile woman you see how God had a gentile in mind Jeffy had a gentile mother and because of that he was rejected by his brothers and now they were in trouble and they came to J out of desperation out of desperation after being re rejected you see how rejection can affect people that sometimes in the future we make decision from the effect of rejection not even thinking he says the first thing that will come out of my house I will give it to you and if you give me this this battle and when he returned from the battle it was his only daughter only daughter only daughter praise the Lord and the Bible will lay out some things if you want to turn turn turn there with me in a little bit here praise the Lord are we together glory be to God if you want to turn with me there a little bit you love the Lord amen jorges 11:29 the Bible speaks of the spirit of the Lord coming upon jeffi now we go down amen verse 34 and jeffi came to mpad unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with Timber and and with dance and she was his only only only can you think about another only Isaac was known as Abraham only even though he was not the only he was not the first legally but as concerning the promise he was the only and here is God telling Abraham to give his son your only son Isaac glory be to God and Abraham will struggle over the to and and and and and and tell Sarah we are going to worship and he tell the man you wa for us yeah the L and myself we will come back and Abraham will try to guard that thing in his heart and and and and and everything and D on Mount moras almighty God will come down and give Abraham an exchange praise the Lord when Abraham live for his hands God says don't do it Abraham look behind you I give you an exchange you see so in God's Plan of Redemption God was not going to take any man born in sin he won't take any life born in sin he commanded Abraham and he never took Isaac he make an exchange he gave a ram now you tell me now how will God take this young woman when you read the Scripture it looks like it it appears like Jeffy killed his daughter to honor his promise to God that's how it appears like praise the Lord are we together but if thou was so it will break Revelation chapter 5 because Revelation chapter 5 says there was no man worthy that word no man means no human are we together so which mean it will break Revelation chapter 5 but let's go down a little bit and you will appreciate the word amen so the Bible says his only daughter came out beside herself he had nether son no daughter she was the only the Bible put that there meanly oh man I just feel like closing this Bible and preach oh God send the spirit of preaching on me this morning send the spirit of preaching on me this morning because I can tell you there the jeti daughter represent a bride in this age because the time of the judges is a good description of loudish age where every man is doing what what is Right In Their Eyes there is no Prophet on the land we just get a bunch of false prophet that are raising up every word praise the Lord and every man is doing what is right in the eyes and here is God is going to raise up a man that is from a gentile mother praise the Lord to show that in a time of chaos God is going to have a gentle brother he's going to have a a virgin Gentile bride that will say the same thing that Mary said listen to this young woman she said Let It Be unto me as you have vowed unto God if that's why you told the Lord then let it be unto me praise the Lord that's the reason why no matter how polluted the age gets how corrupt his girl God will still have a bride amen God will still have young women that will keeps to the word of God he will have young men that will respect the word of God and keep them themselves to the word of God the age might be adulterous but God will always have a witness praise the Lord he will still have people that I will honor their body for his name sake praise the Lord are we together but follow me a little bit let enjoy the beauty of the word I love it amen I love it and she said in verse 36 and she said unto him my father if thou H has opened thy mouth unto the Lord do to me according to that which which have proceeded out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord has taken Vengeance for thee over the enemy even the children of Amon and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me just give me one thing let me alone two months I iemp to believe that's where you got your brother shower from I don't know but I turn to believe praise the Lord that I may go up upon the mountain and be well my virginity I am my fellow me and my friends will spend some time there you know and then we will just and the Bible says uh glory be to God took a c drop that is irritating my throat and he said go and and and and send and send her away for two months and she and her company to be well upon the mountain and it came to pass at the end of the at the end of two that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he have vowed and and she knew no man and it was a custom in Israel that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament praise the Lord now if you look at this word let me travel with you a little bit praise the Lord that word lament means to rehearse and tell again they gathered together it became a custom where they gathered together they rehearsed the story it almost like the Feast of Paran when that time of the year reaches they read the book of Esther and everybody stand to their feet and every time the priest will call the name of Hammet the Jews will knock their feet on the ground it became a custom praise the Lord this became a custom unto them at that time of the year they gather and they tell the story now it's easier to go with the mind and and and think that they gather and they just cry they cry for this girl whatever her name was was and they just cried and they just cried but you see it would break the continuity of the word is going to affect Revelation chapter 5 because there was no man woring and you see and that's the reason why God was against the hidden for putting their children in the fire for sacrificing their children their virgin children to the fire why will he take a virgin G why now you see that parties of the Redemption money praise the Lord that's when the Redemption money comes into play a person makes a vow that is bigger than them so then you go to the priest you go to the temple praise the Lord because this will be sacrificing an innocent life to God if God will not take the life of Isaac that he called Abraham and said give me your only son if he would not take the life of Isaac why would he take this one why would this one matter to God glory be to God now you can do with it whatever you want that's not my message amen the reason why I'm bringing it like this is to help us to appreciate what God has given to us praise the Lord amen the interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication not only interpretation though but with Divine Vindication God in this state has come behind his word to back it up are we together now so take for example the daughters of zapi the Lord of Israel was that uh uh the the the the the inheritance of the father will only be given to the sons and he did not have sons praise the Lord but when that matter arrived see the beauty of the Bible that was the last judgment that Moses made before he left them why if Moses would have left the people will not know what to do they will follow what God told them you people are G you can never take the inheritance of your father but this will be the last judgment the last matter that Moses will sit down with the children of Israel and judge among them that it is truth if he had no Sons Let The Inheritance be given to the daughters but they can only marry a man in their tribe that the inheritance will not move to another tribe because they must not cross inheritance by we're not preaching tribal marriage here amen that's not what we are saying but we are trying to show the importance of God's word so you see God made a provision because they never had a provision for it but yeah he made a provision and from that day on do you know what it was you know what those girls went through four daughters you know what they went through to defy the ERS and bring the matter to Moses I believe they went to talk to their Uncle oh you gu you gu from here praise the Lord but they were so concern concerned they were so burden that our father was faithful the man that stood against Moses he was not counted among them if he does not have an inheritance he will not have a name in Israel and God God that saw the need he kept the prophet for that need to be rightly judged praise the Lord God saw the ignorance of Jeff time he knew and that's the reason why he made provision for a Redemption money praise the Lord you go through what it is is that you go through all all the rights all the ritual that's what they were playing out here in the book of Georges she had to do everything she go she did everything so to what the way the Lord describ it is that as concerning the ordinance she was dead it does not mean that she literally died praise the Lord the same thing to Abraham as concerning Isaac Abraham was there I mean as concerning Isaac Isaac was dead to Abraham but literally he did not die do you see that praise the Lord as concerning the Lord you will go through all the rights and everything that you have to do they will do this they would do that they would do that because it's your vow are we together well like I said do with it whatever you want to do let me preach this morning amen I see a lot of you holding me on there please don't hold me on it glory be to God don't hold me on it this morning hallelujah amen but is god making provision for you knowing that you will fail knowing that you will mess up he go the exra mind he looked beyond our needs he look beyond our thought and he provide everything that we need praise the Lord how can we come out if you look in the face of God's provider word and you reject his provision that's what brother B was saying in the message pdon this morning a pardon was offer WR on a piece of of sheet this guy did everything to track Abraham Lincoln down to get a p for his friend the pum was given he took it but the man did not appreciate it he did not value the pardon because it never came the way he wanted it praise the Lord you can only expect things the way you want it when you make your God but the one that make you will give you things the way he wanted praise the Lord he will give you things the way he wanted Hallelujah and he build character in you after you shake your head no you'll come by and say yes you love the Lord let's give him a hand of praise hallelujah praise the Lord amen glory be to God as concerning Isaac he was dead the Bible says Abraham received him as what one from from the dead according to Abraham God don't play with his word so for God to give me this boy back means that he died and he resurrected oh you love the Lord you know I keept thinking about this it keeps blowing my mind you know Redemption Redemption just beginning to get sweet all the time when you think about it it just beginning to get sweet all the time let's go telling the people an unconverted people a people that been complaining and misbehaving then he tells them love the Lord with all of your heart how how how can we how can we the reason that is that many of the time we take God's word as a commandment as a requirement but in most cases God is telling you what he's going to do I'm going to make you to love me with your heart amen that brother bam says that's the Deep call it to the Deep if God says water from The Rock he put water in the Rock to get water out so when he says love the Lord with all of your heart praise the Lord there's a James seed that he dropped down in your heart that as you as you beginning to hear the word of God it will gravitate to the word and then you will start loving God when he said love the Lord with out of your mind he's able to bring your mind on obedience from every ftiness he's not requiring it from you because he knows that by yourself you can never give it but when he speak it to your heart he's able to bring it out of your life that's the God we oh my let me take it a deep breath here as I read this I'm getting I'm lost in my breath amen you guys are pulling so hard think think thing on our ways listen to this tell me what kind of a price that you can put on eternal life if you are dying tonight with a100 billion dollar in your pocket it could not touch internal life you can buy it money is filthy in God's sight if it isn't used for his kingdom or to some good cost some will not be called to use it for his kyom but some donated for cancer research some donated for This research praise the Lord and because they do it that way God blesses it praise the Lord amen because what what is money a medium of exchange you must be able to get it or give to get are we together amen so morning is a filthy thing in the sight of God if it's if it isn't used for his kingdom or some good cause that's what our money and our greatness is before God we can buy it God is so good till he gave it to us without money or without price but yet suddenly we turn it down because we want to show our own achievement we without money and we without price are we together amen now see this I'm going to I'm going to use this to go into something a little bit yeah just to be able to speak to you as a church speak to you as a people encourage you and also you know just keep us on our guide L is to what what uh the prophet of God said yeah we got it we got it so easy who have believed our report we got it we we got it easy over here now he was making comparison he was making comparison of Other Nation he had just came from Other Nation he saw in places where people were still doing battle system you know they were giving this to get that and all of that so he just coming down here he says we got it so easy over year we are wellfed and clothed and have need of nothing is that that Revelation chapter 3 as we think brother they could teach us Christianity they have to pray and hold to God for everything they got now when brother Juma brother Juma James Jambo was preaching for us the brother from Zimbabwe if you remember he mentioned something as he just went you know they went through a time where you know people have to pray you know prayed over water and put it in their vehicle that's that was not a fairy tale that was not a fairy tale because it came to the point of time where the Zimbabwe money was useless you have to carry a a a a bucket full of money or a trunk full of money to just to go and get a loaf of bread to buy praise the Lord oh yeah because you see what makes the medium of exchange valuable is the standard that you have behind it the reason why we can count on the blood is because we have God behind his blood the reason why we can count on this word above everything and anything because God is behind his word if you don't have a good standard behind your medium of exchange it don't have no value it don't have no value that's the reason why the US money was backed by the gold standard they hide gold behind the money it makes that valuable but the Roman Church has taken all the gold but why make the US money still have value I'll share that with you because we are in critical time we are in critical time we have to preach the word of God to you not politics praise the Lord but we were Tau by the prophet that mody events are made clear by prophecy not by politics modern events are made clear by prophecy people are complaining on the economy and the think is one party or another follow me a little bit just follow me a little bit let's build Our Hope ontain intenal and hold to God's unchanging hands if you have not learned to start trusting God and start trusting and start believing God I share some few things with you this morning are we together definitely definitely I I was in uh Zimbabwe I think two years ago and and the brother that I preached before we uh uh uh you know after the service took me home good friend of mine took me home and you know and then he you know he he got got himself a good compound and uh and and all of that and as we walk around he told me he says brother one he says he says I was only able to have this place during our financial crisis because of how much our money was de value praise the Lord but you see this whole place was a wealthy neighborhood if you never been there you not know what we're talking about you have choices of different meal to eat from you will know what a hungry child goes through you really don't have hunger you just have diff appetite for different thinking sometimes that's what we call hunger listen to this what he says I continue to read they have to pray and hold to God for everything they get listen to this we will get an economy some days if we don't straighten up our living in this country brother Bram said this in the 1950s he said we will get an economy some days he did not tie it to political party he tie it to the reducing of God's word taking the Bible and allow everything that we have allowed follow me a little bit just follow me a little bit we can't finish it we'll finish another time now you see this this is not you see this this is not to scare you this is to raise your faith this is to challenge you praise the Lord amen you see the weow woman in the book of Kings she never had a wellhouse f stock of meal no she just had a bed but every day she went there God was able to give her enough for that day praise the Lord amen God was able to give her enough for that day he's the same Lord that promised that he will supply our needs ACC calling to his riches in glory and we better take him serious because he mean it praise the Lord amen you know that there's a bank in heaven Heaven amen you know there's a Heavenly economy you know what the currency is Faith the currency is called Faith praise the Lord faith in the promised word let's let's just read it a little bit here just trying to grab grab your mind and encourage you and say people we are living in trouble time when we see all of these things that are happening around the world now the all of these communist country North Korea China Russia they are trying to build a strong economy you know what they want to do they want to the US dollar they want to take the US dollar from the place of being International medium of exchange and when that happen God be merciful I give you a little bit of History yeah Master peace he taught us and said now we have got a place we got a place our faith somewhere amen he says uh uh uh uh try to make a success in life and and become many times a millionaire but what we are going to do I mean but what we are going to do that way what are we going to do with that we got to come down to the end of the road what good is it to us then amen and money is a strip is an exchange but you can exchange it for life only God has life now let me go this other place also amen and and don't think that we are trying to preach against I I believe that you know uh uh God has blessed us in this age and I believe that God can bless you he can give you job the right kind of a job he can give you the right kind of a income praise the Lord I believe it glory be to God are we together so don't allow the devil to give you poor excuse and you wreck your own life thinking that I don't need money praise the Lord and we just run ourselves into depths and all of that that's not what I'm preaching here this morning that's not what I'm saying I'm saying that whatever God has given you trust him to keep it that's what I'm saying to you whatever he has given you and he has blessed you with trust him to keep it don't trust your certificate or your ability because it can go in a snap of a finger are we together so brother bam says money is just an exchange that's what it is it's just a medium of exchange just like the the Redemption money was it was just a medium of exchange now we go down a little bit yeah he gave us a history and he said he took this history from the facts of our faith that is the highest Catholic book that can be bought actually brother B will tell a story behind this book that Frank give it to him because you just came by it's very expensive it's it's on the elite book and he refused to give it to the guy back that's the story behind it he says and it said if there a Catholic on the ticket that's running against a Protestant if a Catholic vote for uh for that President they are excommunicated from The Fellowship of the Catholic church right if there is two Catholic running on the same office they will pick out of the Catholic uh there's more lawyer to the mother and then vote for them praise the Lord let's go ahead there a lot of things I could say but I will leave it let's go let's just stick with our talk this morning amen and see how that's deceit what they are trying to do give money away to buy what they are trying to break it they are doing it and she broke it what is it is it's on the goh step in the Catholic Church the Hier owns the gold of the word and uh uh $68 million there you are throw her right back on the gold standard and you people just keep your homes and and things but you belong to the Catholic Church why because she have the go of this country just keep your homes that's what he said now he's preaching this thing back there in the sisters he's telling us these things I bring an interesting information to you he said just keep your homes and things but you belong to the Catholic Church the nation belong to the Catholic Church the whole thing is captured right in like that through through their currency because the money will not have a value unless it is H it has a standard if the enemy comes as a flood the spirit of the Lord will do what raise up a standard so you have a stand you need to have a standard that being raise up to back up your currency praise the Lord in Liberia we use a whole lot of American dollars because we don't have nothing to back our money up we have Liberian but the US dollar is what we use Zimbabwe they do the same and many other countries they do the same why because the US dollar still has something back in it are we together now the Bible says here brother and say through their currency don't you he says don't the Bible speaks of that I love ly my man is look I took one from my office say somewh I I got it from somewhere and it just giving me a little choke here praise the Lord we'll preach anyhow amen if I can talk I'll use my sound language I still have a little bit of it now you'll realize here that uh H H uh in the Book of Malachi you will hear from history that between Malachi and Matthew there was 400 years historian call it the the the years of Silence it's only called the year of Silence because people think there is nothing in history that tells us what happened but the Bible told us what happened in Daniel chapter 9 verse 25 the Bible says from the rebuilding of the city to maiah the prince what time does it cover it covered the 400 years because Mai was a prophet that came out of asiah so he came from the building of the temple to maiah the prince so when we think that there is no history that is living on a period of time the Bible tells us that let's look at a few of them the Book of Daniel glory be to God are we together am I boring you amen glory be to God [Music] hallelujah you have to give to take that's all we are doing here that's what the gospel is all about is freely giv but you will not rightly receive it until you are willing to give up something also Daniel let's go to Daniel chapter n Daniel chapter 9 you know I'm a I'm not a good teacher so I I I really don't I I'm not able to organize myself to this I get too excited amen I get too excited so a real teacher will bring you down you know and bring you down break it down to you I'm not a teacher amen I just love the Lord hallelujah amen I just love the Lord I'm just your brother now so just like I said you read the 70 weeks you look through the 70 weeks you will see that down the chapter 9: 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem when was that from the time of cus from the time of cus to the time that Jesus will come that those years that seems to be like silent years God has already spoken about it praise the lord we also have a time when it seems like the the the the the the uh what will lead up to the the tribulation what will happen some of those things it looks like a silent but God already spoke about it you have to realize that Daniel was a Jewish Prophet that God Rose and gave visions and Revelation about things concerning their end are we together let's look a few of them but when when before we go down let's let's read this from the first seal it will build a picture here and then I will come back to Daniel and then you will understand it see what he says here and after the church is taken away the Rapture are you not glad amen that the worst of this is going to happen when you are taking away after the church is taking away Rome and the Jews will make a covenant with one another the Bible said they would we will find in the Bible where it said it with the holy people and not and and and I'll notice they were they will make it because this nation is going to be busted the rest of the word that's on the ghost Stander is busted and you know that if we are living off of taxes deal bails for 40 years from now he's he's talking this way back in there in 1963 where are we there is there is only one thing can happen that to call in the currencies and paid off the bounds and and we can't do that wall uh uh Wall Street owns them and Wall Street is controlled by the Jews now you see why the Jews and Rome will get into coveted because they own Wall Street praise the Lord amen oh yeah the whole New York is owned by them it's not a fil are we together so you see that's that's where they will come into a covenant because they are the strength behind the the businesses borrowing and all of that and Rome owes the god are we together follow me a little bit the rest the rest of it is is is in the Vatican and the Jews has got the rest of it in Wall Street with the commers of the word we can call it in Praise the Lord amen now what brother ban is saying here is that America cannot just change her money to save herself she can do it all of these big companies will not allow it Wall Street will not allow it many times do that to be able to save save their economy they change their money that's some of some of funny things I'm not I'm I'm just trying to bring things to you so so you can understand where we going this morning Amen Let me let me just read this quickly uh yeah and if and if they could do it this whiskey guys and all these tobacco people which billion times billions of dollars of the year and write off their income taxes for their vocal pictures and things and go out in harona there and buy millions of acres of land and thousands and and and you know and and the dig big Wells and all of the and uh uh now he's he's trying to make us to know that's the reason why they cannot do it because uh uh uh the government just don't have that power there are there are people that has they has the the Jud U your power and there are people that have the uh economical power are we together now look here now in in Daniel chapter 8 let's take uh uh Daniel chapter 8 few few verses there Daniel chapter 8 if you look at verse 22 Daniel chapter 8 you look at verse 22 if you if you go down and and you read back you will see here talking about the Grecian power but what you have to honor is that that image that Daniel saw that came from Babylon to Greece and down to Rome is the same spirit that is just changing Nations that they are ruling is the Same Spirit whatever Spirit was ruling in the head of God that's what was ruling in the breast of sa are we together now so so just just look here n and then you see here uh uh uh uh verse 22 as I said now that being broken whereas four St up of it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power and in the later times the the later times of the aom the later times the end times when trans when the transgressor I come to the fall just like the same thing the the sin of the amorites God was waiting for the sin of the amorites yeah Daniel is saying the the transgressor will come to their fold are we together are you seeing the picture because God cannot bring judgment on the people until the people are Reed for judgment are we together now when the transgressor I come to their four the kings of the first uh uh continents and the understanding that that sentence shall stand up this is what I want to get you and his power shall be Mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practice and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people and through his policy also he shall cause craft what is that Commerce Commerce so that's that's exactly what brother Bram is talking here it's is the power of Rome amen now because he has the gold the Jews has Wall Street they got to come together in a covenant let's read down a little bit bed and through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hands and he and he shall be magnify and he shall magnify himself in his heart and and by peace shall destroy many that's what Paul will say when they say peace peace peace suddenly come destruction because it's all in the same time are we together he shall uh uh the strong maning he shall also stand against the Prince of Peace praise the Lord but he shall be broken without him are we together I love I love the next verse and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is truth wherefore shut up shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many days God said close the book Daniel shut it up I'm revealing it to you but it will be for many days this is something for the end when transgress when transgression will rise up will be for are we together verse 27 and I Danel fainted and was so Sake One Vision in the night troubl him tore him aart he says I fainted and I was sick for many days what are we talking about we're talking about medium of exchange let me bring something to you in 1971 are we together amen hallelujah in 1971 no okay I'm I'm looking at different thing here let me get back to my to my now now you you can find all this information they are there they are in the public domain you can search for it the dollar was Peg at uh $35 an ounce and freely exchangeable into gold at that rate now that was when the dollar was backed by the gold standard amen that's when the dollar was backed by the gold stand however by 1971 uh by 1971 converting into gold was no longer available as US Gold resources drained away instead the dollar became a pure flat currency until the Petr dollar agreement was concluded by Richard Nixon and his uh Secretary of State cassinger in 1973 what was this agreement to save the US economy at that time the president sent his secretary down to Saudi Arabia to get into an agreement with them that the us is going to protect Saudi Arabia Supply them with army amination and all of that and all the things there but the US will will protect them if they will AG agree to sell the oil their oil in US dollar so the so the the the the dollar is not backed by the gold is now backed by oil now so you see what everything that is happening there with Russia and all of these guys you know the prophet to us watch Russia when they get down to that oil and and and is is to is to destroy the value of the US currency because when the currency got behind the oil it became an international power praise the Lord are we together just like I said this information are they are all on uh uh public domain I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to to encourage you you know share some things with you this morning just just to encourage you are we together and also so we can educate ourself are we together time is fill that's what the word says glory be to God the Bible told us we must pray for the Peace of the nation that is our duty to do we we must respect the lord of the nation that is what we're supposed to do as Believers but we must Bank on God's promises we must Bank on God's word okay let me just read few to you all of these things I will not go I will not go a lot into that so that in 1973 the in the the essence of the the deal was that the US will agree uh to military sell and and defend Saudi Arabia in Return of all the oil trade being uh uh Den noted in in US dollars so now the dollar now will have another strength behind it it will have another strength behind it by statistics you will realize that there is more $100 bill out of the US than in the US praise the Lord that's why when you go to the bank they ask you uh uh how much Bill you want and if you're taking SS money they will not give it all to you in $100 bill because they don't have it big money deals are taking place in $100 bills you have 70% out of the country that's statistics you can check it out I'm not making making up things here I'm just I'm just trying to bring some reality to you so just to caution us to realize that the econom the economical problem we are having is the crisis of the US Dollars trying to destroy the value of the US dollar from behind the oil Market Russia was selling their oil in US Dollars now she's in problem with with America she want to sell her oil in rubies so it cut the value of the US dollar from from there praise the Lord by history America have always stand with Israel oh and hope pray God may she ever stand with Israel amen and all of those Arab countries they are putting pressure on Saudi Arabia there is more that is happening than just what is happening on your phones there is more that is happening what is happening in your backyard are you are you understanding what I'm saying praise Lord all I'm trying to do is to bring you back to what God's Prophet said bring you back to what the scripture said that's all I'm trying to do this is not just feeble we not just coming together just because we want to come together and make another church no we have a people that will hold on to God's tender because we know that when the enemy come as a flood even the flood against our economy God will raise a stander when there were when there were drought in Israel for 3 years the Bible says that they were even eating their children God had a Brooks to take care of Elijah he had a widow woman to take care of Elijah and I don't believe it was only Elijah that he was taking care of he was taking care of all the faithful ones all the faithful ones praise the Lord this is time to build Faith Like building muscles it's time to build faith in the promised word I'm not talking about emotion of faith I'm not talking about a guest faith I'm talking about a faith that is affecting you you are seeing the effect in your own life you can get in the presence of God and get down on your knees and spend time with God and you feel so good you can read the word of God not just like newspaper you can read it and you know that I believe this thing the promises in this is solid I will believe it in what is on the news media that's what I'm trying to do this morning I'm trying to tell you invest in your faith Bank invest in your faith bank that's what I'm doing because we are in trouble times the things that are happening around us they are real amen and I lean lean that onto your own understanding let me find a place to bring this to a close and read this to you and see how we can be able to live up the name of Jesus amen that's what matters amen he says now now if we are on the gold standard we are broke and what we are go what's going to happen what's going to happen you know the rich people of this nation these big F trit and whisky men and tobacco and so forth like that is going to stand to change the the the curreny so the only thing we have to do is to borrow praise the Lord is to borrow because that's that's what was happening on the on the promise of giving them military defense the the the the subsidize some of the US deaths and all of that and then pretty soon most of the other uh or countries started falling in line and every one of them started using the US dollars so that's why it's called the petrol dollar go and read on the petrol dollar it's called the petrol dollar because it's it's backed by petroleum is backed by the oil market and that is the war that is going on all the rest that is happening is just is just Mirage is just Mirage because if the US is putting a high sanction on uh on uh uh North Korea and and and sanction on uh uh uh uh Russia and all of that uh uh uh it's it's because they can only have sanction because of the power of the US dollars so if Russia can be able to campaign and get these guys on their side where they can get get rid of the US dollar and just use their money between them the sanction does not have effect praise the Lord the sension does not have effect you can only sension me and say we're not going to pay you now because I'm not getting paid and I don't have no where else to get money from it's going to affect me that's going to affect my children praise the Lord but if I say so well you're not going to pay me I get a job at Walmart praise the Lord are you understanding what I'm saying so there are big things that are playing out there I'm trying to say get back into the word read the word listen to to to to the message study the word invest in your prayer life work on things that you need to work on are we together we saw how the the the the pandemic uh how how it affected the economy B hands they got to get behind it and and and talk the only solution they can come up with is to tell her to wear masks praise the Lord people were dying nothing they could do they just say wear masks so you see people there there's a whole lot that is going on here let me close this thing because I can go on and on and on and on and uh with all this you see there's a whole lot that is going on you you know it say I mean coming to church is not is we didn't come to show faction and why we we and and and that's that's that's that's not it that's not it when we lift out our hands let's mean it let's give it to the Lord let's give it to him let's surrounder to him that whatever he has released healing he has already given it he paid the price for it but we will not enjoy it if we still having doubt in fear we will not enjoy it it's already there everything we need for our journey is there praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is there he comes behind his word but if you are not taking the word of God serious all you will just look for is some kind of a sensation you say you have the Holy Ghost you can back it up with your life you can back it up that's why we are trying to say let's take the word serious let apply in our homes what kind of God are we have seven and he can be able to help us over our problems he can help us over our differences we have reduced God some other God not almighty God because he have not lost his power amen he have not lost his power he's still Healing The Sick he's still delivering people from Habits the devil will just give you one poor excuse and you just hang behind it because this person did this so what what did they give you in exchange what will any man give you that will that that that will that that will measure out what God has given you when God has given you himself are we together God is real let's experience him the God we serve he's real he's a living God let us experience him that's what the gospel is all about it's about Experiencing God glory be to God see God from the foundation of the word when he made his Redemption plan he made an a medium of exchange how am I going to give this to them how am I going to exchange this in his own great mind he make all of these plans to manifest his attributes but how are they going to receive it I have to give them something in exchange that's what the gospel is all about people it's not just about showing up it's not enough to show up praise the lord we must be able to give and also take it's a daily giving to God and receiving from him you identify the promise in God's word you say your word said it Lord what is handling me from experiencing this I give it to you he said B of me that's what it means come let us reason together come let us exchange amen I'm ready to take your weaknesses your failures I'm here to give you my divine nature and God can do it praise the Lord God can do it he's changing lives we're using some some very manded things things of no value bringing disgrace to our own confession the Bible call our tongue the least member of the body the least and yet it ruling us when we open our mouth to talk and say things our sister say we can never put the name of God on our tongue what is that Christian Believers people getting ready for the Rapture what we reducing God when the Bible says that the words from our mouth must be seasoned with Grace praise the Lord let's experience God you know because you know what David said he says taste and see that this God is good he said taste and see come and taste and see that this God is good praise the Lord he can change lives he can make you a decent woman and a decent man our faction does not have to be a from the word praise the Lord can restore s sanity back to our mind he can bring values back into our homes that's the God we serve he's a almighty God huah he can save he can deliver you see when we are just so filled with ourself and it's just ourself we become God to ourself then it has to be our way oh what a mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve let's give the Lord a hand of Praise he's a mighty God yes that's the God we ser praise the Lord that's the God we serve he's strong and mighty he can back up his promise glory be to God brother said on the tap this morning he said what is the pardon is God releasing you from guilt he's releasing you from guilt you will not forget about it but he have taken guilt from your heart and always say because he have taken guilt there is no condemnation unto them that are in Christ let them say what they can say but God has taken the guilty feeling and if you are still feeling guilty then you have to meet God you don't pretend don't make it happen when it's not happening the heaven is so filled with reality for us to take counterfeit the Bible remain a truth for us to just make church and make things happen God is able to back up his word he said I'll build my church and the gifts of Hell will not Prevail against it he mean it oh what a God we serve he's an awesome God Amen I'm telling you he can give you peace of mind he can give you peace of mind joy unspeakable joy unspeakable full of Glory there is nothing Our God cannot do there is nothing there is not one thing that concern us that does not matter to him Hallelujah glory be to God he
