appreciate you we lift you up in the highest blessed be your holy name in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you tonight let's take our Bibles Thank You sis now me this evening of trial let's turn to the book of Revelation chapter 13 I'm not so fond of trying to follow you know and when things are coming up but I just thought thought about it this morning and I thought that well trust the Lord in and be able to go in this direction tonight we might not get through it just for an introduction I would like to talk a little bit on the Mac of the Beast the reason is because of all the things that are out there so just just to kind of encourage ourselves and have the Lord keep us in his direction so Revelation chapter 13 verse 9 tonight if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the song here is the patient and the faith of the saints and I believe the other we are in such an hour were the patient and the faith of the saints I need it there are just a lot of things out there that that make us one the rapture today a lot of things out there and so we want to look at some of those few things tonight and I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he speak as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and cause causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed god bless you you can have a seat also continue to read and he does great one wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceive them that dwell on the earth but by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that world on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wounds by a swarm in that life and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead and that no man might buy or sell save he that hath the Mac or the name of the beast or the number of his name Jerris wisdom let him they have understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six praise the Lord father we were actually blessed upon your word and we just trust the Lord you'll be able to enorus tonight to say that things of God that will give us faith to draw closer to you we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord and with with the present crisis that the world is dealing with and I mean there are just a lot of things that are out there and in any strange thing about it is that giving among us as believers we were beginning to share those things you know when people share those things and and and we have to know that words have spirits you know so we just it is not it is net wrong to be able to share something is all is is also the thought that is behind what you are sharing the reason why you are sharing it now you know a brother could share something with mean just to terminus as well see what is out there well there I mean this thing is completely contrary to the scripture or this thing is completely you know just out of place you know and in that way it is not just to Ma get in and just laugh at it but it's also to have the grace to be appreciated what to appreciate what God has given to us and then also I mean people who shared things because it's a problem it's a popular view I mean it's coming from from from one minister and he can go to another brother and because a setting brother send it out so it looks like you know it's a good thing to shear like I said sometimes people don't even read those things as we shared him but what I wanted to look at tonight just a little bit just to caution us is that we want to look at a little bit the Mac of the Beast I won't go into all the teachings of it I will just pick up a place here I had a prophet of God saying something and it kind of stood up to me that's what drew me in today so you just have to bear with me tonight praise the Lord Amen now we realize that sister faith if you have my code of the alleged start with with this code from the seal of God and where he says a Mac is a distinction it makes a difference it separates something you said you got one Mac egg you got one Mac against you a Mac but you never said you had one seal against you you got one mark against you and a seal is a sign of ownership a Mac is a distinction a feel is a sign of ownership praise the Lord revelation I'm in Genesis chapter 3 verbatim says you know all of these things starts right in Genesis so we want to go back a little bit and look over in Genesis chapter 3 and and you know and be able to - I was just thinking about all of this - I mean today so you just bear with me I'm actually going away from what I wanted to speak on tonight but I hope that the Lord would make this a blessing to us I mean Genesis chapter 3 let's look at verse 15 and go six years I will put on a meeting between thee and the woman and between thy seed and hosi and I mean between the dicey and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel praise the Lord now we realize that that was a promise of redemption there speaks of walk top legs on cavalry and speaks of everything that has to do with redemption and you know and the promise that God gives to the woman but you know as brother Branham talks about base uses right down from Genesis God keeps showing you know how you know the the protection that he has on his church and the protection that he has on his people and that's the reason why I wanted to bring this to you tonight as an introduction I hope that the Lord bless us and continuing to lead us in this direction we can get really into a teaching of this and year but Branham says a seal is a sign of ownership and and I believe that's the place were the Lord want us to get to as his people and as his children praise the Lord he want us to have that blessed assurance that Jesus is mine amen and that's what the Holy Ghost is all about now so we realize in this hour you know as the world is trying to figure out how to deal with this with this virus and they're talking about you know coming out with a vaccine every time like the small parts when a breakout they came out with a vaccine I mean every every you know illness plague that have come to the world they have come out with some form of treatment but and as they are thinking about it and and they are talking about it now because of fear I believe that many minds are running to the places this virus you know one now that this is a plague that have plagued the entire world is this going to be the virus that will introduce the mark of the beast and this is what well now you know what in in many areas before you enter the building they have to use a certain equipment and look on your forehead just to get your temperature and and then when this when this vaccine you know what is Bill they're going to have a chip in it and then when they give you the vaccine and I mean in all of those things are out there man I just only probably trying to find an answer but a bride should not be at that place you know sons and daughters of God should not be other place praise the Lord we must be at a certain spot because we have been told we have been taught what this what is all about what is coming down to praise the Lord and that is the reason why I want to go in that direction because the mark of the beast has been right from the beginning the seal of God has been right from the beginning right there we can see in Genesis chapter 3 where God is putting a seal talking about the seal that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the seven it's a promise that if sealed there is nothing like brother Branham we'll talk about how when when Abram came out and he made the perfect sacrifice that the devil thought that he was the one and heroes of King to kill Abel and God raised up a set in the race of Enoch and here is some more in the race of Abraham and the promise was given to Abraham that he was going to have a seat and go heard that I mean that they ever heard that again the Abraham was going to have a son through whom God would be the father of many nations and he thought that that was the promise see why because even the devil knows that a promise we'll see you in there promise prays alone a seal it's a sign of ownership praise the Lord so we want to look at this to help us to realize that you know like like the prophet of God said he says this age is just like the sick man that wins that went over to the doctor you know and how to die right on the die to step because he will not take the prescription that the doctor has given him and I believe that that is the situation of this age we cannot leave the word that God has given us in this hour and try to find an answer and try to find a solution out there that are all floating up and down on social media all of these people are doing the best they didn't know they are comparing it with Scripture because they have not gotten a word from the Lord like we have got from the Lord amen praise the Lord so that's what we want to we want to just kind of all remind ourselves that we have because you know that's what the devil would do he would take your eyes from on the promise and put your eyes into the future then put your eyes into wondering hoping to get something when what God want to give you is right before you and you just have to feed on that word of God and take what the prophet of God says that's what we want to look after that I pray that the law would be able to give us grace amen now so we realize your brother branham the thing that that caught my attention was the way he brought out the difference here between the mac of the beast and the seal of god and that's what the scripture says right there in the book of Revelation you know that there will be a Mac of the beast and there will be a seed of God and and it is not it is not just in this time even before coronavirus came on the scene before the world was black with based the mark of the beast was already on the scene there the seed of God was already on the same God already had his people see you in this age praise the Lord and he had a people there was already Mac destined to walk away from from God's truth so we want to look at that tonight a little bit or lookout some few types and shadow I read that again that quote again but Urbana shades a Mac is a distinction it makes a difference it separates something you said you got one Mac against you and Mac but you never said you had one seal against you you got one Mac against you and SEO is a sign of ownership a Mac is a distinction and the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit amen grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby ye are sealed unto the time the day of your Redemption the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing us ownership God on his church prays alone but the Mac of the beast is a way one that they cast out their refuse to take and come to God provide a way praise the Lord so he says again the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing us on a shape God on his church and I believe that's the hour where we are in word I mean we have to like force and make our called an election show we have to go back and check our experience of the Holy Ghost amen they we just had a sensation or we had an indwelling experience of the Holy Spirit because that is the seed of God that is the thing that is promised to the believer and if the believer have their water whether there is a vaccine or whether you have to go to a place your your workplace where they got a test your temperature you are not going to be afraid because you already have an assurance in you [Music] that's the holy that's the Holy Spirit you know that if anything should happen like brother Branham says if the worse you blow out right now you know that you are going to be in a safe place it's not a maybe it it's not a guess it's an assurance that we hold in our heart praise the Lord and that is the that is the assurance that I want for us to to kind of fall we want to make emphasis on the Holy Spirit praise the Lord Amen because we know also in an hour like this there will be another group of people that will be looking for the Holy Ghost you know like the scripture says there over in Matthew chapter 25 the the fully virgin she will be going out looking for oil and she want to get she want to get an assurance because she's so scared of the darkness of the night she's scared of everything that is happening and all the things on the media she won't but that's that that is now with the wise virgin when she heard when when the car went for behold the bridegroom cometh she woke up she knew exactly what to do because she was ready price alone he says God in his church but a Mac of the beasts is the way war they cast out that refuse to take and come to God provide away amen King as soon as he was Mac was sent away praise the Lord we get that ever died and said rise to take his place was a sign of the resurrection once again there is that ownership or that assurance there after even able died God raised of one in his stead a sign of the resurrection so even if the plague will harm a believer with that assurance of the Holy Ghost in his slide he will rise again brother Branham says the seed of Abraham was promised to be like the sand by the seashore and the stars in heaven a sign of the resurrection that we if Jesus started we may go by the word of the grave but we will rise up like the signs in the heaven praise the Lord so as we look at this - as we look at this together it just for us to be able to to encourage ourself in the bridge he also said this let's look at that tonight that would be the second code I'll be looking at and then we just look at some few scriptures just to encourage ourselves now before we even go to there now see where brother Branham kind of lay out there Mac of the beach he says again the mark of the beast is the way wall they cast out that refused to take and come to God provide the way praise the Lord so we realized that as the Prophet make us to know that the the mark of the beast and the and the seed of God was right from the beginning and that is shown out there in a life of King and a bear is said right there in Genesis chapter 4 but we realized here that he underlined some things you know that there has to do with this with this mark of the beast refusing to take God's provide the way which is God's provided word which is God's Word for the hour refusing to take God's provider where we can we can we can be associated to a church we can claim to believe the message but just bringing our heart to accept what God has provided God's word for the hour if we can just go into the chamber of our heart and acts our self do we have a heart that accept God's correction or are we always struggling against the correction of God we were always refusing correction that we always you know just walking away from the Word of God you know away what person is is one that just could get out there he does not hear it does not have no shame face and people in this age does not have no shame face when they are doing things that is contrary to God's Word refuse to take and to come to God providing Wayne in the bridge he talks about the seal again he says another thing a seal signify is ownership seed the seal has a mark on it the seal it has a mark on it it shows ownership when you are bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by God praise the Lord you are owned by God I was I was talking to a brother yesterday and actually that's what I wanted to speak on tonight but it's okay I can go in that direction a little bit where I was talking about how the scripture speaks in a book of Proverbs that that the the barrier is is slave to the lender and and and and and you look at that principle as much as it is in business in in in other ways but you located in a strip sure you will realize that this this nature of seeing that we are born on earth was landed to us in but by default and like brother Branham says you know the lie between the seven and Eve landed us this nature so we borrowed it from the from from from from the devil let me say it that way and then it had enslaved us out of our life but we don't have to be enslaved out of our life because jesus paid a price amen he already paid a price on the cross of Calvary by eros here we are stay caught in this body that was born in sin shifflett in iniquity now you see that is the reason why the accuser of the Brethren always come back he's trying to accuse us he's trying to enslave us so what was given to us so what we borrowed but because we know a price is already being paid we don't have to be slave to the devil we don't have to follow his instruction because the price has already been paid we don't owe him anything we don't owe him anything the one that we all is the one that I paid the price [Music] praise the Lord even though I mean I still have the jacket as they have this stick in nature in Maine and he can say well that jacket belongs to me you know the major used to be mine I just gave it to you but now if you if we don't come to consciousness of the price that has already been paid that we don't always guide anything it's easier for us to be in slip oh yeah it used to be for you you know yeah I agree it used to be for you you don't have to agree because the price has already been paid you don't owe you the one that you owed is the one that I pay the price [Music] when you are bored by the blood of Jesus Christ and the seal and see you by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the word or anything that pertain to the world praise the Lord amen now you think about it like God speaking and even listening to him and he's speaking to the second and says I will put an m-80 between you and a woman and between your seal and a woman's seed praise the Lord and he's saying that the seed of the woman would loose your head now is Eve is listening to death now you just imagine that now I mean right in the presence of God or have just spoken to Adam first in God have spoken to the woman second and they were all listening to the conversation the no the wrong that they have done but right in their wrong you say that God is sealing a promise why because he has already come on the scene with a bleeding lamb you have already approached him with a bleeding lamb praise the Lord he he saw the wrong that they have done and in and the disobedience that they have walked in and there was no way they could come back to him and he came down and slid alive he walked right down and eat him I had him Adam where are you he went right to where the word and presented them the bleeding lamb and his voice is coming through the blood speaking to them and she's hearing him now himalay in the wrong that she has done she's feeling guilty but God through the blood is giving and assurance God is giving her a security that the seed of the woman will bruise the head the head of the sipping praise the Lord now so you see that's how sometimes we struggle with truth and we struggle with the promise of God's Word like when brother Branham says you never did it in the first place and he Mele we know what we have done praise the Lord there is that tendency of struggling to be able to accept what God has provided for us Adam also said standing by and listening to Dan and God never said the seed of the man he said the seed of the woman praise the Lord I believe after all of the shame and all of the hurt and all of the embarrassment and all of the things that might have gone through her mind but to walk away from that garden verse can with a thought in her mind the sea otter woman praise the Lord the seed of the woman and like the scripture says in John chapter 12 except a seed it's planted in the earth and it dies amen so he so in another sense this this promise that God was giving to her was not going to be an outward sign this promise of a seed that will bruise the head of the serpent was an evil sign and that's what the seal of God is to the church it's not an outward sign it's an evil sign we no longer belongs to the world or anything that fits into the word you are owned by God and another thing is a seal is a security Cu means you are secure for them to walk out of eating nori in your mind that God had made a promise that there will be a seed that would bruise the head of the seven they can hide behind that God has just lucked out on an EVE into a promise that he can walk away the walk away from that garden not even thinking what their life will be not even thinking about and not a mistakes that were made because God has already made a promise a seed of the woman will bruise the head of the setting praise the Lord oh if for any reason the seven came by when when I was not around it was easy for Eve to remind him you remember God said my seed will bruise your head she did she never had to be intimidated again because she had a promise a seal is a security si means you as seek heal now you that don't believe in eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination whoa onto the guide I try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken praise the Lord amen the Holy Spirit see you cannot be broken there is not there is not a Vashem that can break the Holy Ghost seal there is not a bastion they can give you that would break the Holy Ghost see you and take the Holy Ghost and give you the mark of the beast why can we go for the real thing when people can hold to the promise of God and let it be real in your life praise the Lord has been burning he says I was about to travel and he says they have given me fussing all over my body for for that trip I told him I don't need it but it's the Lord I couldn't go over there without those passing now I'm not preaching you to go for the Vasan what I'm preaching here is that no Vasan is the mark of the beast like the scripture says no medical equipment of testing in your head to get your temperature is the mark of the beast if you are afraid for I mean for you to be tested you better check down your faith you better check in your heart for that insurance all of the Holy Ghost because that's the thing that matters in this hour that is the thing that is going to get us out of here that is the thing that is going to get us over this plague that is the thing that is going to bring the church out it's a Holy Spirit it's not how smart we can be or how much we can evolve what is giving out there in the world the holy spirit see you cannot be broken you all have heard me say that people people said that that would make me to do this no no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't see you in so then cause you were not seal in he says and when you assume in sorry he see you out praise the Lord that that's what matters amen that's what matters when we are see you in that they will see you out if there was anything that we were we I mean the the the church to be thinking about or the bride should be thinking about is I mean getting a refilling of the Holy Ghost and walking out of our house everyday having that full assurance in our heart that as we go go out and come back in I mean the Lord is with us he's dwelling in our hearts and that would be worrying about I mean just a plague in our mind with all the things that is out being praise the Lord I heard someone saying from from a video somebody say me and says I wonder if John I wonder if John in a vision was seen what is going on with people being skinned on their forehead they are just wondering it's not the word of the Lord praise the Lord let me take a stripper yeah let's look at Jeremiah chapter 3 praise the Lord now yet God is speaking to Jeremiah he's talking about how Israel has played the harlot Jeremiah chapter 3 that's look at verse 3 he says therefore the shell has been withholding and there have been no lettering and thou have a wool for head they refused to be ashamed now God was telling Israel because of all that they have done they are walking prowling in their disobedience against God's Word amen he's saying you have the forehead of a wall what is the forehead of a wall it's a girl that was trained by her parents to be shaming and respectful and she don't care what clothes she word because she won money she can stay in the street and cars can be passing by she don't care who's looking at her I mean she just had the forehead they have boldness in her face possessed by the devil to strip herself and just stand by the street she don't care even if a father coming passed by that's the forehead of a war and God is addressing Israel he says that's the kind of a forehead you have you can stand right in the face of God's Word with all that I've done for you and you can still go after idols you can still go after strange teachings the forehead of the ward praise the Lord and that's the same thing verbatim says what the Mack is is refusing the correction of God standing right in the face of God's Word you can argue to get yourself out of God's Word that is the mark in the in the forehead it's a kind of fun it's a kind of a mindset that that always rebelled against God's Word whenever truth is presented you have something to counter it you can argue about it it is not just dared to say beer unto me according to your word it's not just there to say oh I surrender you always have to have another thing you always have to argue that truth why is it not this way why did the Bible say that why you know Old Testament is this place Lord we notice it's a rebellious spirit against truth amen it's a rebellious spirit against truth look at our Lord Jesus he was born the word he was now born in seen he was born but a virgin an injured announces his birth but when he was met by the devil he never used his deity rinsing well you know I was not born in sin I never pay talk of what you introduced to Adam he never used his deity he used the word it is written so he even humble himself to the word and said sit on it is written the devil comes and say yeah I know illustrating but it is also written that he would give his angels charge over thee I mean he could have just used the divinity that was behind him but he gets back to the word again and said it is written that I should not tempt the LORD thy God that is that is the sign that is the sign of a Son of God we will always goes to the word for our correction we were goes to the word for our defense we were goes for the word for our protection we will go to the word for our comfort who goes to the word to solve our problems because the word is the secure place that God has placed us that's where we find security that is the fear of God when we have I mean issue comes we I mean people they have work I mean no conscious of the Word of God you call this frame they have no example in their lives they will go to this other person the house I mean they don't have no godly example what is caring what is caring people in that direction why is because there is a spirit that refused truth then or there if they prayed and read a Bible the Bible would tell them something to get in line with the way God want them to do that God even to a king if you do ask your brother Abel but it was not in him to do it he refused refused correction refused confection refused to surrender yet we want to experience the power of God we want to experience praise the Lord Ezekiel chapter 3 let's take another verse here now we together we together praise the Lord okay I think I have a few minutes out soon leave you just a feather if you know quickly I just send you a code that I want to refer to Ezekiel chapter 3 let's let's look game every time I try to multitask I get confused but can get away from me let's see how God speaks to his 7-year Ezekiel also oh I see why I'm looking in the wrong chapter I'm asked him I said what did I wrote down here Ezekiel chapter 3 now God speaking to Ezekiel son of man go get Aeon to the house of Israel that is verse 4 God is instructing him to go to the house of Israel let's look at verse 9 verse 8 that's why I want to I want to look at when I be home I have made a I have made a face strong against the offense and therefore has strong and died for head strong against their forehead as a son as an adamant harder then flint have I made that forehead fear them that neither be dismayed at their logs though they be a rebellious house now here's God also talking to Ezekiel and tell him that he has given him a forehead wish of course it represents a mindset amen I'm sending you to this rebellious house I'm sending you to this disobedient people but I'm going to keep you in the mindset of my will can you imagine even Jeremiah prophesied to Israel that they are going into captivity and talking about how the Babylonians is coming to amigo to to ravage the place and all of the things and he and this is his people he's not even sugarcoating of what God is saying he's not even trying to say well you know please I mean he's not begging him he's saying the Word of God just the way the God want him to see it God put in his prophet in a mindset that no matter how the offense is I speak my word just ask I wanted to be spoken praise the Lord it's a mindset it's a mindset to do what God's will were seized and the mark of the beast on the forehead is a mind said I no matter what the Word of God says I can take it from the King James I would go and look for the for the Living Word translation you read a living word translation it brings it area no they don't want it I want it they want to find a good news maybe the good news for water this done for me you go to the good news and it says they keep finding a way to get out of God's Word it's just a mindset a mindset that cannot take true from God's Word they will rather take it from the media they'll rather believe what the internet says though rather believe was one drunker or somebody you know they have no good example in your life who said instead of taking what the Word of God says but here is God putting his people and that's what he want us to be we have to be in a mindset that he is our protector we have to be in a mindset that he is our provider no matter what what how ugly it is and what they say they are bringing we have to know that our security is in him is for them for the bride a believer to be in their mindset I think the problem is there people feel their minds with the media more than feeding their minds with the Word of God they feed their minds oh you saw this other thing on Facebook oh you saw this other thing on whatsapp or you've sorted until people would send them out I mean things that are not real praise the Lord just recently I was I was I was talking to her brother fellowshiping with a brother some one brother sent me something and and and what he and what they did in that is theater it took brother branham picture behind by the arabesque Oh puppet that's how terrible the Internet is and you have a court a quotation of brother branham dear now just seeing that there is something wrong with that picture it just told the truth of what the Prophet is saying off I mean I just when I open open the the message that he sent me and I could just identify it's the brother branham they were preaching better a basecoat charge he was never there he said a way to make what he says you know have strength or to vindicate what he says we have to take his picture and hang him in a cloud we have to take his picture and put him right in good shape for tabernacle for people to know that yeah we are really preaching brother branham message we gotta take his picture and and you know to do something on the computer they have him right behind you that just aligned spirit as much as we love the Prophet we must not trick him like that I think if you even send him a photo like that he SME is going to be astonished when did this happen what is our mindset what is our mindset when we wake up in the morning what is our mindset because that that will be your mark on your forehead it's your mindset what are you thinking about what are you meditating on praise the Lord we see the a type of a rebellious mind said that God is strife she's just like the forehead of the world that's a rebellious mindset no matter what you say I don't care what the courts say I don't care what the scripture says I'm gonna do what I have to do anyway that's the forehead of the wall she don't she don't care if her mama comes by she has choosing that as a lifestyle she's going to dress that way that's the kind of a forehead she had she can goes right in the middle of the street she's not hiding in the corner she doesn't have shame face right in the house of God praise the Lord and we see the mindset of a son of God is he here he says I'm gonna give you I'm gonna make your forehead so strong right in the face of a rebellious generation you would say speak the truth you would say speak the truth the ice is now going to terrify you when you're even you are put before the king I'm gonna make your head so high to stand for what is right praise the Lord what are people talk about brother Branham says some people get the wrong impression of what their anointing is did you ever think of death when was the greatest anointing ever gave to anyone and what did and what did they do when they had anointing the greatest anointing our debt was ever give to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it with our measure and one day he entered into the temple and pick up the straw and he read the Spirit of the Lord the Spirit of God is upon me he was testifying that I had the seal of God I have the Holy Ghost upon me the Spirit of God is upon me for he has an ottoman to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken had to heal the sick to give sight to the blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him there's been prophesied eight hundred years before that it will come and year he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we will want to run all over the building screaming and hollering but the Bible said he laid down the straw and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions they anointing it brain power in control praise the Lord that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for for us to control our temper control our thoughts control our eyes control our desire control our tongue that's why the Holy Ghost is giving for and that is the seed of God praise the Lord I just wanted to address all of those things that are out there because we can like ourself in a room like the family in the house refuse to go to hospital refused to go to church refused to do whatever I refused to do everything and see if our hearts a snap in obedience to God's Word that's what the seed of God is a had I use the serrano to God a life that is willing to be corrected by God's truth a heart that is ready to run to repentance and ask God for His grace and His mercy like the heart of the prodigal son he was ready to run back home he never said what I've wasted everything I rather just keep going I'm just going to go until I die he was ready to go back home it's a sign of ownership the believers hold that sound in his heart he knows that all that I have belongs to the Lord I've been bought by a price so he just can't live anyway surrounding himself to the Word of God I believe we are right in that our what the children of God we're gonna be so glad that he paid the price for us we're gonna be so glad that he gave us the promise of his spirit we know that we are possessing it can you just think about it in the mists of all of this you are at peace you don't even know the kind of a fear that this word is honor the thing that is terrifying people have not even come now you have not visit your mind Ezekiel chapter 9 but Branham says also it was the sign of the Holy Spirit they see you on their forehead when they were praying for the abomination that is done in the city it says he said it was an evidence that he had the seal of God and evidence of the Holy Spirit in our time we'll be praying and saying god save those people that I exposed to these things right in the city of New York is save them Lord why because you already know you are in a secure place you already know his protection is around you you want to get on your knees and just be so concerned about you and your family and your children and I mean and your relatives will be praying for the city of Minneapolis you be praying for the city of New York when you go dating and listening to the news and year all of those things that are happening you'll be praying for children that their parents are quarantined and their sake if those parents leave them there will be there will be offerings and evidence of the Holy Spirit a heart that is seal a heart that is in security will be crying out for the ones that are perishing praise the Lord I hope that this kind of makes sense to you but it's just I mean all of the things that are out there in pretty soon we can get ourself workup in all all the theories that are out there all the theories and then we can leave the word of God the safest place if you don't have insurance of the Holy Spirit you better be praying that God gave you the Holy Ghost because that is the CEO of God and if you have the Holy Ghost you better pray that God gave you more of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord may he just refill you and refill you and refill you that you were having mindset that we stay in the promise of God no matter how all good things go you will be so stubborn to believe God's Word the word can be stubborn about everything but you will be stubborn that God said it and I believe it that's that - it praise the Lord we were stopped here tonight this bad boy yes Heavenly Father
