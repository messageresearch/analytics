[39:49] because we have come to see you that we
[39:52] may see you before the end of the
[39:54] service
[39:55] this arm or father we ask in Jesus name
[39:57] Amen praise be to God can we turn our
[40:02] Bibles to Hebrews 11
[40:14] Hebrews 11 23 to 27 I read by faith
[40:23] Moses when he was born was hid three
[40:27] months of his parents because they saw
[40:31] he was a proper child and they were not
[40:35] afraid of the Kings commandment by faith
[40:39] Moses when he was come to years refused
[40:42] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[40:45] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[40:48] affliction with the people of God than
[40:51] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[40:53] season
[40:54] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[40:57] riches than the treasures of Egypt for
[41:01] he had respect unto the recompense of
[41:04] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[41:08] fearing the wrath of the king for he
[41:11] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[41:15] praise be to God we are going to please
[41:21] be seated
[41:26] there is something the Lord has laid on
[41:28] my heart tonight
[41:35] and I title it what is your god-given
[41:39] purpose in life
[41:42] what is your god-given purpose in life
[41:49] praise be to God now they're children of
[41:55] Israel ended up in Egypt Egypt was a
[42:01] home to them they left Egypt God blessed
[42:09] them they prospered
[42:12] life was good until that came a pharaoh
[42:17] who did not know Joseph then the tables
[42:22] turned over God so much blessed the turn
[42:28] of Israel that their prospect in
[42:31] everything that they did Sarah saw the
[42:36] way the churn of Israel were just
[42:38] numbering he thought to himself that
[42:42] probably one day these people are going
[42:46] to take over Egypt ah they may have the
[42:51] enemies of Egypt to overthrow Egypt and
[42:54] took over the economy of Egypt so he
[42:58] spoke to the midwives that were in
[43:00] charge of the maternity of the children
[43:03] of Israel to kill every son that was
[43:08] born but a Bible says they feared God
[43:11] and they wouldn't do it and when he saw
[43:16] that they were not doing it then he
[43:18] issued a Fiat a decree that any male
[43:23] born should be cast into the Nile she be
[43:28] drowned it was around this time that a
[43:33] man called Amram and his wife Jackie
[43:36] bird gave birth to a child and the Bible
[43:40] says they hid him for three months till
[43:47] they couldn't hide him anymore
[43:49] now I have been wondering over and over
[43:52] a child three months old I don't care
[43:58] how small the house is you would always
[44:00] find a place for that child
[44:02] I believe that when federal issue that
[44:07] order there were men that were parading
[44:10] going run in the night to listen out
[44:16] whether they were babies
[44:18] newborn babies crying and they had all
[44:22] the authority to walk into the room and
[44:25] take that child if it was a baby boy and
[44:29] cast it into the river and I believe
[44:34] Jackie read and amrum may have taken
[44:38] turns keeping wait to make sure Moses
[44:42] doesn't cry and that may have done that
[44:46] over and over till probably the bow tie
[44:48] it you know a little children the best
[44:51] thing they can do is just cry when you
[44:54] are hungry they cry when you're wet they
[44:57] cry when they want fellowship they cry
[45:01] they don't care whether you just came
[45:03] back from work and you are tired they
[45:05] don't know that oh it's not easy God has
[45:09] always given Grist appearance praise be
[45:12] to God
[45:12] and I couldn't keep this child anymore
[45:15] now the Bible says that his mother did
[45:19] not feel the commandment of the king he
[45:23] didn't yet and to tell you that she did
[45:27] not feel what the King has said just
[45:30] imagine that a king had given orders
[45:32] that every male bossy because in the
[45:35] river and the mother makes that Ark we
[45:39] know the story I don't want to go so
[45:41] much into it and then she carries the
[45:43] little baby right where the king had
[45:46] commanded that every single baby born
[45:49] she be cast into they should run a baby
[45:51] but she didn't care she took the baby
[45:55] day praise be to God now the Bible says
[45:58] that the name that
[46:02] child was the proper child they did not
[46:05] fear what the enemy had planned against
[46:09] the life of that child they knew that
[46:12] the purpose of God for his life was
[46:15] never going to be defeated and she took
[46:18] the little boy to the river
[46:21] I dare you King you have given orders to
[46:25] drown babies in this river I bring the
[46:28] baby day you don't have to look for him
[46:30] just send your men to come and drown him
[46:32] praise be to God and none other than the
[46:37] king's own daughter Kim so Moses and he
[46:43] said no she had so much love for the
[46:50] child that if it would cause the child
[46:54] to die I believe she would have taken
[46:57] the place of the child and we know how
[47:02] she ended up right in his mother's arms
[47:06] the demurrer was the impaired to take
[47:08] care of his own son her own son and when
[47:14] Moses came of age the mother took him to
[47:20] Pharaoh's daughter I bring your son to
[47:23] you and actually it was Pharaoh's
[47:25] daughter who named him Moses praise be
[47:30] to God and Moses grew up in a very home
[47:42] praise beauty God the Amanda issued the
[47:46] orders took him and he even has so much
[47:52] love for him than he had for his own son
[47:57] Moses had the best of the best life was
[48:02] good he agreed up in the palace and he
[48:09] was groomed to be the next Pharaoh
[48:15] but you know what the Bible says by
[48:20] faith when mothers became of age he
[48:23] refused to be called the son of
[48:27] Pharaoh's daughter by fate remember what
[48:33] we are talking about tonight is what
[48:35] your god-given purpose in life by faith
[48:40] he refused to be called the son of
[48:44] Pharaoh's daughter it takes a man and
[48:49] for that matter
[48:51] a woman who knows their god-given
[48:56] purpose in life to take that type of
[49:00] thing that you have life going well for
[49:06] you you are in the palace you have been
[49:13] nurtured to become the next pharaoh
[49:16] Egypt remember at that time it was as
[49:19] great as America is today a Pharaoh's
[49:24] book everybody everywhere in the world
[49:27] they listened that was how influential
[49:30] Egypt was and for Pharaoh for for for
[49:34] for for Moses to refuse to identify
[49:38] himself with that room tells you that he
[49:42] had found his god-given purpose in his
[49:45] life because it is very very easy to be
[49:51] carried away on the circumstance like
[49:54] that
[49:58] he knew that he was born for a purpose
[50:03] he knew that he did not belong there he
[50:07] identified himself with those people day
[50:12] the Egyptians were calling slaves he
[50:15] numbered himself among them praise be to
[50:19] God he knew that he was born for a
[50:24] purpose and when he saw that an easy an
[50:30] Israelite and an Egyptian were fighting
[50:32] and he killed the Egyptian he identified
[50:37] his purpose but he went a step too far
[50:41] he went a little too early and Moses
[50:48] lent his mistakes to show you that he
[50:53] learned his mistakes in the wilderness
[50:57] Moses could pray and tell God if your
[51:00] presence does know go with us do not let
[51:02] us go from here because he knows what it
[51:06] means to go ahead of God praise be to
[51:11] God you can know your purpose in life
[51:15] but you may go ahead of God and there is
[51:19] a disaster
[51:22] never go ahead of God does it mean girl
[51:31] should go ahead of you yes but make sure
[51:36] that God does not leave you behind
[51:40] praise be to God when God makes a move
[51:44] make a move when you taste a step take a
[51:47] step when he stops stop if your process
[51:51] does not go with us do not let us go
[51:54] from hence
[51:57] what is your god-given purpose in life
[52:05] I want to ask these two questions have
[52:13] you found your god-given purpose in life
[52:17] do you know why you are here why God
[52:23] brought you into this life question
[52:28] number two
[52:28] have you found your purpose in life and
[52:32] if yes I used serve in that purpose and
[52:37] if no why
[52:47] Prez beauty guard now
[52:56] you can never serve the purpose of God
[53:00] trying to work in another man's
[53:02] footprints be yourself you are unique in
[53:12] yourself God made you the way you are
[53:16] for a purpose it doesn't matter how you
[53:22] feel it doesn't matter how you see
[53:25] yourself it doesn't really matter what
[53:28] matters most is how God sees you you are
[53:33] made to serve the purpose of God often
[53:39] times people try to be like other people
[53:44] you hear of a post I hear sir oh I wish
[53:48] I was like this person you hear of a
[53:50] rich person there oh I wish I was a
[53:52] switcher this person you hear this Oh we
[53:55] kind of lose our identity we lose our
[53:59] god-given purpose by trying to be like
[54:02] other people try to walk in the
[54:05] footprints of other people God did not
[54:10] make you to be like someone else you are
[54:15] unique in yourself and you have a
[54:17] purpose to save a god-given purpose
[54:20] praise be to God
[54:23] God did not create you to see how you
[54:27] would look like oh just another human
[54:29] being because he already knew how you
[54:32] would look like before he created you so
[54:36] you are not just another number
[54:40] God created you for a very specific
[54:44] purpose
[54:50] like a piece of invention if you woke up
[54:56] one morning and you saw a drone lying in
[55:02] front of your doorstep now we all know
[55:07] what a drone is so it will be very easy
[55:09] to tell what it is but just imagine that
[55:13] you woke up one morning you open your
[55:16] door and there was a drone sitting down
[55:18] in front of the door how would you call
[55:21] it you will refer to it as maybe a
[55:27] miniature plane because that is what it
[55:29] looks like and if you will so the remote
[55:34] and the body attached to it it's still
[55:36] wouldn't change the name but if you saw
[55:43] the manual and you got a hold of the
[55:49] manual then you would know what that
[55:56] piece of invention is what it can do
[56:01] what it is created for that is it is all
[56:07] meant to do that is it can do why
[56:11] because you have the manual but the
[56:17] inventor or the creator does not need a
[56:21] manual because he invented it
[56:24] so he knows is purpose he knows what it
[56:28] can do and what it cannot do but for you
[56:32] you need the manual and just like us
[56:38] human beings you did not create yourself
[56:44] you did not create yourself so how do
[56:46] you tell what your god-given purpose is
[56:57] God created us to be able to tell what
[57:03] your god-given purpose is you have to
[57:08] lay hands on the manual without laying
[57:12] hands on the manual remember you don't
[57:16] belong to yourself I hear people say oh
[57:19] it's my life it's my life it's my life
[57:21] it is not your life the Bible says we
[57:25] are bought for and paid for by his blood
[57:31] you don't belong to yourself that is why
[57:35] you can't just do what you want that is
[57:37] why you can't just live in a life you
[57:39] want that is why there are places you
[57:41] can't go that is why you can't dress
[57:43] anyhow why because someone brought you
[57:48] here and he has an expectation of you
[57:52] you are brought here to serve the
[57:57] purpose of God not your past our purpose
[58:00] not your personal purpose but to serve
[58:03] the purpose of God and to serve the
[58:08] purpose of God you need to get a hold of
[58:12] your Bible for that is the old owners
[58:16] manual the Bible is the owners manual it
[58:21] is not as if you open the Bible and then
[58:24] you see your name and then it tells you
[58:27] oh hey this is what I'm supposed to do
[58:30] this what I'm supposed know but by you
[58:33] going through the word reading the Word
[58:36] of God feeding on the word marginally by
[58:42] bread alone but by every word that
[58:44] proceeds out of the mouth of God as you
[58:46] feed on the Word of God and you are
[58:49] becoming the Word of God you are having
[58:51] fellowship with God study in the world
[58:54] feeding on the way you are getting
[58:58] closer to God you are getting to
[59:02] discover who you are and what you are
[59:06] made for
[59:09] and before you realize their old phrase
[59:17] back to the background and you are
[59:19] becoming a new creation as you go into
[59:25] the world and you'll live by the word
[59:28] and you feed on the word you are getting
[59:32] to discover who you are and what you are
[59:35] made for that is why we just do not have
[59:43] to stay away from the world praise be to
[59:50] God and until you find the purpose of
[59:54] God for your life there is no way your
[1:00:00] life will be fruitful there is no way
[1:00:06] sometimes when we lose our identity and
[1:00:09] we lose our god-given purpose in life we
[1:00:13] try to replace it with with the tents of
[1:00:18] this life go to places we shouldn't go
[1:00:23] routines with ain't good we
[1:00:25] shouldn't do sometimes we don't
[1:00:28] necessarily do you know commit sin but
[1:00:31] we try to preoccupy ourselves thinking
[1:00:35] that is going to give us joy but it
[1:00:37] never gives you joy why because you were
[1:00:40] not brought here to set those papers
[1:00:42] until you serve the purpose of God there
[1:00:45] is no way you would ever find joy
[1:00:49] sometimes you will think it's education
[1:00:51] and then you finish me you finish with
[1:00:54] your with your bachelor's degree and
[1:00:55] then you ask what next and there is a
[1:00:58] master's program you go in for it you
[1:01:01] finish it and then what next
[1:01:03] then there's PhD you go for it and when
[1:01:06] you finish there is nothing more to do
[1:01:08] praise be to God that just gives you
[1:01:13] some sense of accomplishment just for a
[1:01:17] little while
[1:01:18] then you realize that you are back to
[1:01:21] square one that joy is birthday like a
[1:01:27] young man of twenty nine years old he
[1:01:31] was so smart at the age of 29 he had
[1:01:36] gotten his ph.d very successful in life
[1:01:41] life was very good the head of a
[1:01:47] corporation and then he took ill not
[1:01:50] long after that and in his sickbed he
[1:01:55] sent for his father and then the father
[1:01:58] came and he told his father daddy I want
[1:02:03] you to go home and gather all the books
[1:02:06] you bought for me and then bring them to
[1:02:10] the hospital here then the nurse said
[1:02:13] you have a mini library in the house a
[1:02:17] mini library actually Gwen gather all
[1:02:21] those books and bring to you he said yes
[1:02:25] then that I said what are you up to
[1:02:28] he said that just go and get them for me
[1:02:32] that that was hesitant they said dad
[1:02:36] uh-huh I've been given six months to
[1:02:38] live what if this was my death wish
[1:02:42] would you do it for me
[1:02:44] it's soraka son let me go get at him I
[1:02:48] don't know what you're up to but I'm
[1:02:49] going to get the books he went but
[1:02:53] people to help him he loaded all the
[1:02:55] books in the truck and then brought him
[1:02:57] to the hospital came brought them to the
[1:03:00] room and then he arraigned all the books
[1:03:03] and a boy told his life that you have
[1:03:07] been a very good father you gave me the
[1:03:11] best you push me to the highest you
[1:03:16] wanted me to be successful and indeed I
[1:03:18] have been very successful in life now I
[1:03:22] want you to look at all these books
[1:03:25] tell me where is the Bible
[1:03:30] and the dad was speechless where is the
[1:03:36] Bible where is the owner's manual
[1:03:47] sometimes as Christians would even know
[1:03:51] where Bibles are the only time you look
[1:03:57] for your Bible it's worth trouble you
[1:03:59] have a bad dream and then you open the
[1:04:01] Bible and put it on your chest praise be
[1:04:04] to God
[1:04:05] are you put it under your pillow and you
[1:04:07] sleep on it you have a Bible yet you
[1:04:11] don't read it sometimes you know where
[1:04:14] the Bible is but you don't even read it
[1:04:18] other times you read the Bible but you
[1:04:24] don't do what the Bible commands of you
[1:04:27] to do as a child of God why is the Bible
[1:04:32] I don't care how much education you get
[1:04:35] it can never replace the purpose of God
[1:04:39] in your life as we humans as human
[1:04:43] beings we have our own purpose in life
[1:04:46] to go to school to have a best education
[1:04:50] to have a good job to have to live in a
[1:04:52] big house to drive in the best car they
[1:04:55] are all good may remember that you have
[1:05:02] a god-given paper just safe and that is
[1:05:08] why you are here
[1:05:10] and the purpose of God in your life can
[1:05:14] never be defeated sometimes we think
[1:05:21] it's money and people engage in crooked
[1:05:26] deals data still they can kill the cow
[1:05:31] Rob to get money and then you get the
[1:05:34] money and there still it doesn't bring
[1:05:37] you satisfaction there is no joy in it
[1:05:40] it's useless look at a man like what's
[1:05:44] his name Steve Joe I think he died with
[1:05:48] probably eight billion dollars and what
[1:05:52] did he say he said if it's money I have
[1:05:55] money but my money cannot heal me my
[1:05:59] money cannot deliver me
[1:06:02] what is the value of money without God
[1:06:05] it's useless it's useless it's better to
[1:06:13] have God and not have money at all that
[1:06:16] to have money and miss God and for some
[1:06:21] of us we miss our god-given purpose in
[1:06:25] life because we chase money all our life
[1:06:30] just think about the rich young ruler
[1:06:33] the rich man who kept the Lord Jesus
[1:06:37] upon all the work he had he realized
[1:06:41] that there was something that was still
[1:06:44] lacking in his life and he came to the
[1:06:47] Lord Jesus good master what shall I do
[1:06:52] to be saved when the Lord Jesus told him
[1:06:57] go sell all you have give it to the poor
[1:07:01] come and follow me he saw that it was a
[1:07:04] very difficult thing to do because the
[1:07:06] Bible says he was rich he couldn't
[1:07:12] imagine himself becoming poor he missed
[1:07:18] that opportunity he missed that
[1:07:22] opportunity to save his god-given
[1:07:25] purpose why because of money sometimes
[1:07:32] want to be famous you want to be popular
[1:07:35] you want to be a in everybody's good
[1:07:37] books and you turn your back on God
[1:07:44] among all human beings I don't know who
[1:07:49] was greater who was so famous thank you
[1:07:54] but if a man like in SoLoMo can say when
[1:08:02] you go to the end with all his wealth
[1:08:06] and the wisdom that God gave him with
[1:08:08] all his fame if you say life is just
[1:08:11] nothing but vanity upon vanity
[1:08:14] then why do you stand praise be to God
[1:08:22] tonight what we are talking about
[1:08:26] tonight as what is your god-given
[1:08:29] purpose have you identified their
[1:08:32] god-given purpose in life for that is
[1:08:37] the only thing that is going to give you
[1:08:40] joy praise be to God the only thing that
[1:08:46] would give you satisfaction money fame
[1:08:51] and what have you will just give you
[1:08:53] some happiness and some little
[1:08:57] recognition which over time fades away a
[1:09:09] child of God nothing brings you joy than
[1:09:14] the Word of God you live in in the world
[1:09:18] and knowing that you are serving the
[1:09:22] purpose of God it doesn't matter where I
[1:09:29] have food to eat or not it doesn't
[1:09:32] matter
[1:09:33] what goes on in your life for you to
[1:09:36] know that you are walking in the will of
[1:09:39] God and you are serving the purpose of
[1:09:42] God in your life gives you joy what is
[1:09:49] your god-given purpose in life
[1:10:02] now everything God made what's the SAP
[1:10:05] ghost papers the Sun the Moon the Seas
[1:10:10] the stars the trees mention them they
[1:10:15] are all made to serve the purpose of God
[1:10:18] and when you take man for example every
[1:10:25] single part of your body is made to
[1:10:29] serve a purpose the eyes are made to see
[1:10:36] the ear is made to hear the hey some of
[1:10:43] us don't have hey praise be to God it's
[1:10:51] for a good cause you may not realize it
[1:10:54] but when we get out there I'll be
[1:10:57] looking for something to cover my head
[1:10:58] because I'll be losing so much heat and
[1:11:01] very soon whatever praise be the legs I
[1:11:09] made for a purpose every single part of
[1:11:15] your body is made for a purpose just
[1:11:18] look at you and then tell me one part of
[1:11:21] your body that has no use just one part
[1:11:28] of your body that is there to serve no
[1:11:30] purpose just one you can't find one
[1:11:41] I remember now we are all part of the
[1:11:48] body of Christ you might be the hand I
[1:11:53] might be the finger you might be the
[1:11:56] head here you might be the lungs you
[1:11:59] might be the kidney we are serving a
[1:12:02] purpose in God and never try to be like
[1:12:07] somebody else be content with what God
[1:12:11] has given you the Bible says bad leaders
[1:12:14] with content but it's a great game do
[1:12:17] not desire another man's gift God knows
[1:12:24] what you can handle and whatever God has
[1:12:29] given you I don't care how little it is
[1:12:33] God is pleased with it if you serve that
[1:12:36] papers you look at the heart you dive in
[1:12:45] see the heart where the heart is working
[1:12:49] 24/7 365 80 years
[1:13:01] you don't see it but it's working
[1:13:06] sometimes the success of the ministry
[1:13:13] it's on your prayer the prayer that you
[1:13:17] are saying pray in your closet that
[1:13:22] nobody knows about it but God in heaven
[1:13:24] knows that you are keeping the ministry
[1:13:27] by day and by night before God and the
[1:13:33] success of the ministry rests on your
[1:13:35] prayer and then you sit down and you say
[1:13:38] Oh nobody knows me nobody knows me
[1:13:40] nobody even sees what I'm doing whom do
[1:13:43] you want to see what you are doing is it
[1:13:45] God or is it man praise be to God we are
[1:13:54] all part and parcel of the body of
[1:13:58] Christ and as every single part of our
[1:14:02] body says a pebbles
[1:14:04] every one of us here serve a purpose or
[1:14:09] must serve a purpose in the body of
[1:14:11] Christ
[1:14:13] you have your god-given purpose there is
[1:14:17] a reason why God has brought you here
[1:14:20] not to eat and sleep and go to bed and
[1:14:23] wake and do it over time and get the
[1:14:25] money and then die and go and live it
[1:14:27] that is not the use of life that is not
[1:14:32] the purpose of life if that is why we
[1:14:35] are here then among all creatures were
[1:14:37] the most miserable that's right we have
[1:14:40] been called to a greater purpose than
[1:14:48] you think it doesn't matter how small
[1:14:53] you are it doesn't matter how old you
[1:14:57] are it doesn't matter how weak you think
[1:15:01] you are nothing in the hands of God is
[1:15:07] useless
[1:15:10] remember that the purpose of God in your
[1:15:13] life can never be defeated in the
[1:15:19] message maritima liveth I want to read
[1:15:29] from paragraph 10 a little 9 down that
[1:15:39] we are and I think that this is a
[1:15:42] wonderful time to think on the hopes
[1:15:46] that God has given us now we want to
[1:15:49] draw this face into our mind that there
[1:15:52] is not one thing that can destroy us
[1:15:55] until the purpose of who of he who
[1:15:59] created us has been fulfilled there
[1:16:02] could be nothing we are made for a
[1:16:05] purpose this church was built here for a
[1:16:09] purpose
[1:16:09] this foundation was dug and Aquila stone
[1:16:13] lead and the blocks laid into the
[1:16:17] building and a roof and the interior was
[1:16:20] not put here just to see if it could be
[1:16:24] done it was put here by a purpose Oh for
[1:16:29] a purpose praise be to God your home
[1:16:32] that you live in was not just
[1:16:35] accidentally per day or somebody just
[1:16:39] wasted some time your home was made for
[1:16:42] a purpose to serve a purpose if you did
[1:16:46] Drive this morning here in your
[1:16:50] automobile so this night in our case
[1:16:54] that automobile was not made just to see
[1:16:58] if it could be made the materials that
[1:17:02] was not wasted by men it was put here
[1:17:06] for a purpose and to serve a purpose
[1:17:10] their clothing that you weigh was not
[1:17:14] just to see if somebody could fashion
[1:17:17] something it was for a purpose the food
[1:17:20] that you eat
[1:17:22] was no groan on the 8th does a see if it
[1:17:25] will grow it was made to serve a purpose
[1:17:29] and bird did not have to just make a
[1:17:33] tree just to be a tree
[1:17:36] he made it free for a purpose and God
[1:17:39] did not make you and I just see if he
[1:17:44] could do it he made us for a purpose
[1:17:47] therefore there is a purpose for us all
[1:17:51] been here
[1:17:52] praise be to God you are not an accident
[1:17:56] in the kingdom of God God made you for a
[1:17:59] purpose and you are here to serve a
[1:18:02] specific purpose and that purpose will
[1:18:05] never be defeated
[1:18:06] and until you serve that purpose there
[1:18:09] is no way you are coming to the end of
[1:18:12] your rope you are not here just to be
[1:18:16] another human being you are here because
[1:18:18] that God made you for some peppers you
[1:18:23] are here you are not here just to eat
[1:18:25] the food now God grew though God wrote
[1:18:29] you are not here just to live in the
[1:18:32] house that man made or to wear the
[1:18:35] clothing does somebody fashioned you are
[1:18:39] here for a specific purpose no matter
[1:18:41] how little you are how big you are
[1:18:44] how important you are how unimportant
[1:18:47] you are you are here to serve a purpose
[1:18:51] just as a finger is here for a purpose
[1:18:57] my nail on my finger is for a purpose my
[1:19:03] eye and every part of our body is to
[1:19:06] serve a purpose and it was not just put
[1:19:11] here to see what it would look like when
[1:19:15] it was put here but it was put to serve
[1:19:20] put here to serve his purpose it was
[1:19:24] God's divine plan to do so and if we
[1:19:28] were put here for a purpose
[1:19:34] then there is nothing can destroy us
[1:19:37] until God's purpose in our life is
[1:19:41] fulfilled praise be to God nothing can
[1:19:45] harm us until that purpose that God has
[1:19:51] put us here for has been made manifest
[1:19:56] no matter how much trouble we have how
[1:19:59] much headaches or sorrows that we go
[1:20:02] through all of these are reasons and
[1:20:05] this a reason for it
[1:20:07] praise be to God we will take for
[1:20:10] instance Noah in the Bible there was a
[1:20:13] flood that came on all the eight was
[1:20:21] destroyed the vegetation and everything
[1:20:24] was destroyed but Noah and his seed that
[1:20:29] he had taken into the ark God's purpose
[1:20:31] can never be defeated
[1:20:34] there is nothing can defeat it so how
[1:20:42] happy at Whitby today rested upon the
[1:20:47] beautiful revelation of the word of the
[1:20:51] Living God that there is neither taste
[1:20:54] present nor things that can come there
[1:20:58] is no sickness no sorrow no death no
[1:21:01] perils no nothing can separate us from
[1:21:05] the purpose of the Living God what God
[1:21:08] has imagined in his mind what God has
[1:21:12] purposed in his heart to bring to pass
[1:21:15] there is no demon there is no power
[1:21:21] there is nothing can ever separate God's
[1:21:25] great immortal eternal plan it must be
[1:21:30] as God has said praise be to God
[1:21:36] what is your god-given purpose in life
[1:21:41] I want you to do an intro special set
[1:21:46] your heart
[1:21:48] are you living up to the papers are you
[1:21:52] living up to the task
[1:21:54] I you serving the purpose of God in your
[1:21:57] life
[1:21:58] if Christ shall come today right now and
[1:22:09] if you are not serving the purpose of
[1:22:11] God what would you say is your skills
[1:22:16] what would you say is keeping you away
[1:22:19] from 75 hours of God what would you say
[1:22:27] it's keeping you away from seven his
[1:22:30] eternal purpose in your life that devil
[1:22:36] is going to bring a lot of destruction
[1:22:37] our way the devil is going to keep you
[1:22:40] very busy so he can take you away from
[1:22:47] what you are supposed to do or what you
[1:22:51] ought to be doing as a child of God the
[1:22:57] Bible says we should be as wise as
[1:22:59] serpents know why you are here this
[1:23:04] world is passing away I always tell my
[1:23:08] wife and children that we are just
[1:23:11] living in a time of grace but if God has
[1:23:14] given you eyes to see you will see that
[1:23:16] this world is already gone
[1:23:18] the word is gone there is nothing left
[1:23:22] in this world you should fix your eyes
[1:23:28] your minds your heart on the tents of
[1:23:33] God for there is nothing to look up to
[1:23:38] this world is a failure it's just a
[1:23:42] matter of time and we'll be out of here
[1:23:45] if you do not know why you are here
[1:23:49] it is time to start talking to God
[1:23:53] for God has to hear for everything yes
[1:23:56] it is that by accident it is time to
[1:24:01] start talking to God for there is a
[1:24:03] purpose in your life you must save I
[1:24:07] don't care what it is that you are going
[1:24:10] through there is no excuse enough not to
[1:24:13] save that purpose for a life full of
[1:24:18] excuses it's not worthy of the gospel as
[1:24:20] the professor said what is your
[1:24:25] god-given purpose in life I remember it
[1:24:32] doesn't matter how small it is if you
[1:24:39] can serve that purpose you would have
[1:24:43] glorified God sometimes we are looking
[1:24:47] for the big chance and sometimes the big
[1:24:50] things are not to be made for us bird is
[1:24:55] looking at us and trusting us for the
[1:24:57] small team and as they come don't let go
[1:25:03] down don't let go down we have let him
[1:25:09] down several times in several ways
[1:25:12] countless number of times but we are
[1:25:16] serving a gracious God a very loving God
[1:25:19] who has given us second chances
[1:25:21] Terrence's fourth chances so we can't
[1:25:24] even count anymore
[1:25:26] praise be to God you can look at your
[1:25:30] personal life and see how far you have
[1:25:32] come and you can tell that it is by the
[1:25:35] grace of God that you are still alive
[1:25:38] there are instances in your life that
[1:25:42] would have taken you away but ask
[1:25:44] yourself if God had not been so gracious
[1:25:47] to you
[1:25:47] and had taken you away where were you
[1:25:50] going to spend eternity where we're
[1:25:54] going to spend eternity last Sunday
[1:26:00] whereas God was talking about whom
[1:26:02] as homegoing time eternity begins here
[1:26:07] and where you are going to spend
[1:26:11] eternity depends uh is determined by by
[1:26:16] your walk with God here
[1:26:19] you can't live any life in a reckless
[1:26:23] life for that matter and then hope that
[1:26:28] when when when when you get to the end
[1:26:30] of your road in this life some miracle
[1:26:32] is going to happen it's time for us to
[1:26:40] mean business with God it's time to
[1:26:46] serve God and serve God faithfully don't
[1:26:52] look across the shoulders to see who is
[1:26:55] coming a voice not coming we are called
[1:26:59] individually when someone works at a
[1:27:03] door walks into this auditorium in this
[1:27:06] church and then he merges a name done
[1:27:12] nobody here would answer I would answer
[1:27:16] and when I pretend I didn't hate I
[1:27:19] believe you guys who call my attention
[1:27:23] praise the Lord they are calling you so
[1:27:28] we all have a duty a sacred duty to God
[1:27:34] don't ever forget that God has not given
[1:27:40] up on you don't give up on God whatever
[1:27:47] purpose God has entrusted to you God
[1:27:49] knows you can serve that purpose else he
[1:27:52] wouldn't give it to you don't let go
[1:27:58] down
[1:28:02] God has faith in you have faith in God
[1:28:08] there is a god-given purpose in your
[1:28:10] life and that purpose you must save
[1:28:16] there is no two ways about it you must
[1:28:20] serve that purpose and always remember
[1:28:24] that the purpose of God for your life
[1:28:26] can never be defeated cannabis has come
[1:28:41] what is your god-given purpose in life
[1:28:48] some of us are called to be the eyes to
[1:28:53] lead the road but of what use with the
[1:28:58] ice be if the icy danger coming and the
[1:29:04] less refuse to run
[1:29:08] praise be to God what would be the
[1:29:14] purpose so you realize that even though
[1:29:19] every part of the body has a unique
[1:29:22] purpose they're all waking harmony they
[1:29:27] all work in harmony so we have our
[1:29:31] individual peppers and then we all work
[1:29:36] in harmony to lift God up press B
[1:29:43] together the purpose of God is to see
[1:29:48] men in our fully state man in this stage
[1:29:53] living other way that you can become the
[1:29:58] word on two feet the men can look at you
[1:30:03] and see God in your life
[1:30:06] now you don't have to go to a places to
[1:30:09] type without I am a Christian oh I go to
[1:30:11] change no let the people see Christ in
[1:30:14] you the Bible says you shall become
[1:30:17] living epistles seen a read of all men
[1:30:23] the word must become flesh in you
[1:30:30] if you have to tell people you are a
[1:30:32] Christian and you have to try to
[1:30:36] convince people that you are a Christian
[1:30:38] then remember there is a problem by the
[1:30:43] life you live by the words of your
[1:30:46] testimony by the desires of your heart
[1:30:49] that US you have the places you love to
[1:30:55] go they're people you hire and --which
[1:31:00] it tells where you stand with God
[1:31:04] and the purpose of God for you is for
[1:31:09] God to be able to come down in his
[1:31:12] fullness and to live in you to use your
[1:31:15] hands to use your feet to use your eyes
[1:31:18] to use your lips press be to God to the
[1:31:22] glory of his holy name that people can
[1:31:31] look at you and see Christ the Bible
[1:31:35] says let your light shine before men
[1:31:37] that they may see your good works and
[1:31:39] give the glory to your father which is
[1:31:41] in heaven because man is an entity of
[1:31:45] darkness and if there is light in you it
[1:31:50] means that God has come down to live in
[1:32:00] that
[1:32:02] because he is light the Word of God is
[1:32:06] lights praise be to God Jesus to the
[1:32:10] people that this is not a condemnation
[1:32:13] that light has come into the world but
[1:32:15] men loved darkness because the idea idea
[1:32:19] deities were evil the Word of God is
[1:32:23] light when the word comes into your life
[1:32:26] there is no way you are ever going to be
[1:32:29] the same if the word has come into your
[1:32:32] life and you are the same person your
[1:32:34] way last year
[1:32:37] you are still the same person the
[1:32:40] surface anyway five years ago you are
[1:32:43] still the same person then the receptor
[1:32:46] is trouble then there is trouble
[1:32:51] praise be to God we all have our
[1:32:55] god-given purpose they remember that our
[1:32:58] purposes when put together should work
[1:33:05] in harmony and should serve one purpose
[1:33:09] that is the purpose of God
[1:33:12] praise be to you can we just give us a
[1:33:23] song to sing praise God is alive

[1:35:04] said in the church age is all of God's
[1:35:06] children have gifts amen

[1:35:13] is the gift of God so it comes with a
[1:35:16] gift so there's a gift of God in you
[1:35:19] when you have internal life internal
[1:35:22] life is here it's a gift
[1:35:24] praise the Lord couple of weeks ago I
[1:35:27] read a coat here and butter Dan says
[1:35:33] something tonight
[1:35:34] I was thinking about that just like I
[1:35:38] said we will have a time to study there
[1:35:40] but RAM said that in the revelation
[1:35:45] series for and I really begin as we come
[1:35:50] to the close of this service he said see
[1:35:53] John I left the earth man he's talking
[1:35:58] about John being lifted up Christ I left
[1:36:03] Earth in the form of the Holy Spirit and
[1:36:07] I returned back to a body again he said
[1:36:15] today the body sit there as a memorial
[1:36:21] think about there when Jesus extended
[1:36:26] in seated on the right hand of the
[1:36:28] throne of God their body is sitting as a
[1:36:32] memorial listening today's it said as a
[1:36:37] memorial as a sacrifice we we get to
[1:36:44] that right down through the chapter but
[1:36:48] the Spirit of Christ come back and live
[1:36:54] in the church live in us praise the Lord
[1:37:00] so where's his body the one on the
[1:37:04] throne or the one year the one year the
[1:37:09] one on the truth is just a memorial it's
[1:37:15] just a memorial now you see that is that
[1:37:19] is the mystery of the mystical body
[1:37:23] there in all of God's children he has
[1:37:27] put a gift to sustain his body praise
[1:37:34] the Lord
[1:37:35] that's what he says when I go one word
[1:37:38] spoken against the church will not be
[1:37:40] forgiven but Benham says no matter how
[1:37:44] weak the church is he said it's better
[1:37:46] than what the world can offer its us you
[1:37:52] know people can blame the church they
[1:37:54] complained about Church they have
[1:37:56] problem with the church they have
[1:37:57] problem with people and all of that that
[1:38:00] I mean the actual thing that is that the
[1:38:02] problem is just yourself it's because
[1:38:05] you have not find your position you have
[1:38:08] not found your purpose in the body
[1:38:11] that's why you have your problem
[1:38:17] if you have identified that place that
