[4:29] when God prove what he would do and said
[4:31] what he would do and prove what he would
[4:34] do then they turned around and called
[4:37] this man an evil spirit which cursed
[4:39] them
[4:43] all think of what taking
[4:46] place think of what caused them their
[4:49] training caused them not to recognize
[4:54] the very word made flesh for their day
[4:58] the very train that they had in their
[5:01] schools with the very best of
[5:04] teachers and you say well we wouldn't do
[5:06] that today there teachers were far
[5:08] Supreme to ours today Superior to our
[5:15] teachers and they failed they didn't
[5:18] have
[5:18] 996 different organizations as we have
[5:22] today they had about three and in the
[5:26] Three Bottle down to three and none of
[5:29] the three we recognized
[5:32] it this goes to show that What man does
[5:34] is foolishness to
[5:37] God
[5:39] now they fail to recognize it now and
[5:43] they do the same thing
[5:45] again man intention is good it always is
[5:50] good and man never changes his posture
[5:56] he never changes his ways much I'm I'm
[5:59] talking to the man of the world man is
[6:02] always praising God religious man for
[6:06] what he
[6:07] done and always pointing people to what
[6:10] he's going to do and then ignoring what
[6:13] he's doing see that's just man he's made
[6:17] that way he's always been that way and
[6:20] you Bible readers tonight know that
[6:22] that's according to the word right
[6:25] they're always praising God for what he
[6:27] has done saying what he will do and
[6:29] ignoring what he's doing that's just the
[6:31] habit of
[6:35] man the reason that they had did this
[6:38] the
[6:39] teachers to my opinion now they had
[6:43] interpreted the word because they all
[6:46] believed in a coming Messiah all Israel
[6:49] believed it they do yet
[6:51] today but the reason that they didn't
[6:55] recognize
[6:57] him his message wasn't according to
[7:01] their
[7:02] ecclesiastical
[7:04] fit they uh there the interpretation
[7:08] that they had of the word the Messiah
[7:11] never manifested himself in the way that
[7:14] they had interpreted that he would do it
[7:17] so and therefore they did not recognize
[7:19] him because it didn't fit their
[7:23] interpretation as I've said before and
[7:25] say again God doesn't need anybody to
[7:28] interpret his word
[7:30] he is his own
[7:33] interpreter now the Bible says let me
[7:35] prove to you now that that is the truth
[7:39] Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this
[7:43] happened Isaiah the prophet said a
[7:46] virgin shall conceive and shall bear a
[7:49] child there's no doubt that everyone in
[7:51] that age thought their daughter would be
[7:54] that woman because Isaiah said it but
[7:57] you see it was 700 years later
[8:01] but when God didn't need anybody to
[8:04] interpret his word when he'll do it or
[8:05] how he would do it he said he would do
[8:07] it and he did
[8:10] it God promised that he over in Isaiah
[8:14] also I believe the 28th chapter about
[8:16] the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that
[8:20] in the last days the last 2,000 years he
[8:23] had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[8:26] he said your sons and daughters shall
[8:28] prophesy your young young man shall see
[8:30] Visions your old man shall dream dreams
[8:33] and the things that he would do Isaiah
[8:35] said with stammer lips and other tongues
[8:38] will I speak to this people and this is
[8:40] the rest but they wouldn't hear it they
[8:43] waged their heads and walked by it he
[8:45] said all the tables of God would become
[8:48] full of vomit and there would be nothing
[8:50] clean and if that isn't a picture of
[8:53] Jerusalem and the Church of that day at
[8:56] the coming Messiah it's a picture today
[8:59] the same
[9:00] same it's just repeating itself now when
[9:04] God says he'll do a thing he did it
[9:07] regardless of what anybody else thinks
[9:09] about what anybody says when God speaks
[9:11] to something he's Duty bound to
[9:13] interpret that word himself and his in
[9:16] Vindication of the word is his own
[9:19] interpretation
[9:20] notice vindicating his messiah's
[9:24] message he promised what the Messiah
[9:26] would do when he come and when he came
[9:29] even when the wise men in the East had
[9:32] looked down south Westward from where
[9:36] they were at in babyin and they saw a
[9:39] majestic
[9:40] star did you know there's not a speck of
[9:43] History nowhere that any Observatory
[9:46] where they even kept the the uh the time
[9:50] by stars great man who studied these
[9:53] Stars there's not no history says that
[9:56] any of them seen that star at all why it
[9:59] wasn't given to them they wasn't looking
[10:02] for such but these wise men know that
[10:06] there would be a star of Jacob
[10:09] R and they were looking for it and it
[10:12] passed from the time that Jesus was born
[10:16] in Bethlehem now I know our Christian
[10:19] Traditions it's just like our churches
[10:22] it has things Topsy turby you go out
[10:24] here and you see wise men coming to
[10:26] worship a baby there's not such a thing
[10:28] in the scripture
[10:30] two years later they got there coming
[10:32] down through the Plains and across the
[10:34] Tigers River they never come to worship
[10:35] an infant but a young
[10:38] child about two years old why was it at
[10:41] the same time Herod slew all the
[10:43] children from two years old under that
[10:45] he might catch the Messiah you see they
[10:49] God had Vindicated by his word and when
[10:52] these wise men came to Jerusalem the
[10:55] star LED them to the religious capital
[10:57] of the world Jerusalem and as soon as
[11:01] they entered those Gates that star the
[11:03] supernatural that had led them refused
[11:06] to show them anymore up and down the
[11:08] streets These Fine Man rich man with
[11:11] fine great camels and so forth up and
[11:14] down the streets saying worries is born
[11:16] King of the Jews we saw his star in the
[11:18] east and that great religious
[11:21] Capal after two years of the shepherd's
[11:25] message still didn't have the answer and
[11:28] know nothing about it amen the head of
[11:31] all the denominations amen didn't have
[11:34] the answer so it Disturbed the Sanhedrin
[11:38] and they call for the scribes to come
[11:40] read and they read Micah's story The
[11:44] Prophet which said thou Bethlehem art
[11:46] thou not the least of all the princes of
[11:49] Judah the least but out of thee shall
[11:52] come a governor that shall rule My
[11:55] People
[11:56] Israel and after the scriptures being
[11:59] being read and still being Vindicated
[12:02] Before Their Eyes they still didn't
[12:06] accept it though the scriptures said
[12:09] so I doubt very much they would today if
[12:12] the scriptures that's promised for this
[12:15] day will be made
[12:17] manifest I may never preach to you again
[12:20] but I want you to get
[12:21] this still they wouldn't
[12:24] believe the great wisdom of the father
[12:28] makes man wisdom so
[12:30] foolish that he belittles the man he
[12:34] actually comes to the place to work
[12:37] makes man feel so ashamed of himself and
[12:39] he's not big enough to admit that he's
[12:43] wrong he still stays with this story no
[12:48] matter how much the father proves that
[12:50] his word is true and he's doing just
[12:53] what he promised to do man thinks his
[12:56] wisdom is so Superior to God if it don't
[12:58] come according to him is wisdom why It
[13:01] Isn't So Am that's true in every age
[13:04] still does it see how fitting the whole
[13:07] matter was now what inspiration to those
[13:13] herdsmen the Angels coming down to speak
[13:16] to
[13:18] herdsmen angels of God coming to speak
[13:21] to a bunch of shepherds I wonder if you
[13:25] ever had the privilege of of talking
[13:28] with a she Shepherd are being with one a
[13:32] while if you would I I don't like to say
[13:35] it because of my uh remark I'm fixing to
[13:38] say after a while but the shepherd stays
[13:42] with the Sheep so
[13:44] much until he even laughs like the Sheep
[13:49] blatant he talks like the
[13:53] sheep and he smells like the
[13:56] Sheep that's right
[14:00] because he's with the Sheep that's all
[14:04] he knows is his
[14:07] sheep now the Vindicated word of Truth
[14:12] when these Shepherds humble
[14:17] uneducated man what an honor how fitting
[14:22] it is to a
[14:24] Shepherd to receive a message of a
[14:28] newborn sheep
[14:32] am it could come to nothing else but a
[14:35] Shepherd that's why it was born in a
[14:37] stable and not in a house sheep are not
[14:40] born in a house or in a pink decorated
[14:44] hospital room see they are born in the
[14:47] barn in the
[14:50] fields that's the reason he was led to
[14:53] calary you can't not make a sheep Walk
[14:56] The Gang way to the slaughter did you
[14:59] know that in the slaughter yards they
[15:02] have a goat that leads the sheep and
[15:05] when he gets up to where the killing
[15:06] place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep
[15:09] go on a sheep has to be led he can't
[15:12] lead
[15:13] himself so therefore it had to be the
[15:17] shepherd coming for the his sheep when
[15:20] they found the god baby exactly where
[15:23] the messenger said he would be and when
[15:27] they found this
[15:30] mess message of the messenger in the
[15:33] manger
[15:35] exactly where the angel said it would be
[15:39] now I heard people say an angel spoke to
[15:42] me he said thus and thus how ridiculous
[15:46] sometime I've heard people say that an
[15:48] angel spoke to them and told him thus
[15:50] and thus which was absolutely contrary
[15:53] to the word now How Could An Angel do
[15:57] that it just couldn't be and if God told
[16:01] you a certain certain thing would happen
[16:04] you say he told you that and it doesn't
[16:06] happen then it wasn't God speaking to
[16:08] you just remember that's right God
[16:10] doesn't lie he's not found in a
[16:13] lie when they found the baby what a joy
[16:17] it must have been to them because the
[16:19] angel that gave them the message they
[16:22] found it just exactly the way the angel
[16:26] said it would be and just in the place
[16:28] where the angel said it would be what a
[16:30] thing that must have been to him in a
[16:32] Manger why see how it ease these
[16:36] herdsman was in the
[16:40] stable why do you think a theologian
[16:42] would have been in there it put a pin
[16:45] over his nose and said get me out of
[16:47] this
[16:49] place he would have been so out of place
[16:52] he' been in
[16:54] misery but you see it was just at home
[16:57] to the shepherd praise the Lord God
[16:59] knows where to send his
[17:01] message just exactly right and this
[17:05] state the Shepherds was in then in their
[17:07] stable with their lamb a
[17:10] Vindicated message that they had heard
[17:14] how beautiful in the presence of the
[17:16] Messiah Vindicated word of their message
[17:20] when the
[17:22] Shepherds heard that the Messiah was on
[17:25] Earth and came into his presence right
[17:27] in their own environment
[17:29] and found the message to be true was
[17:33] Vindicated there how that must have made
[17:35] those men Fe to find that God had done
[17:39] this great thing for them while Scholars
[17:42] would have been so out of place there
[17:44] under such circumstances and they had
[17:46] all left right quick why the
[17:50] messengers coming to Common herdsman
[17:53] maybe they could have not
[17:56] even these some of these herdsman might
[17:58] not have even been able to have sign
[18:00] their own name very doubtful you know
[18:04] the herdsman that Jesus chose when he
[18:07] was here on Earth the her his
[18:10] sheep lovest thou me Peter more than
[18:14] these yay Lord thou knowest I love thee
[18:18] feed my sheep and the Bible said that
[18:21] Peter was an ignorant and unlearned
[18:26] man still choosing Shepherd
[18:31] the church members of those past days
[18:34] and priest well trained Society in that
[18:39] day would have been so out of place in a
[18:43] stable now I'm not quite sure that many
[18:48] of you could understand maybe you citt
[18:50] people
[18:52] what a judian stable smelt like what it
[18:57] look like
[19:00] as the animals in that stable and what
[19:03] it would have been why some of these
[19:07] Classics of the day would be so out of
[19:09] place there they they wouldn't even
[19:10] enter the door amen but it pleased God
[19:14] am by his infinite wisdom to reveal it
[19:18] to such as would receive
[19:22] it the scholars and wise men of that day
[19:26] would certainly would not have received
[19:28] it
[19:29] they had been so
[19:30] humiliated to be caught in such a
[19:33] place why the first place if they would
[19:37] have went back to their church and would
[19:40] have witnessed that they tended such a
[19:42] meeting and believed a bunch of
[19:47] uneducated Shepherds bringing such a
[19:50] phenomena they had have been
[19:52] excommunicated from their
[19:54] church that have been thrown out of the
[19:57] society of
[19:59] Bethlehem if they have been caught
[20:02] listening to such an unlearned bunch of
[20:05] people as these Shepherds were
[20:07] humiliated they certainly would have
[20:09] been if they had been associated with
[20:12] such common
[20:14] people and being un accepting such
[20:20] heresies as to believe that God would
[20:23] bring his message to an uneducated bunch
[20:27] of shepherds when they had everything
[20:29] all prepared for
[20:32] it they would have lost their
[20:34] affiliation they' have had to give in
[20:36] their papers and would not have been
[20:38] able to have been uh uh recognized among
[20:42] the Society of their groups of that day
[20:46] because they had associated with such a
[20:48] thing and not with a better
[20:52] mind how dare you the priest would have
[20:56] said you come into my Sanctuary here
[21:00] with such a heresy with such a
[21:04] foolishness that some unlearned Bushman
[21:07] out there that doesn't didn't go to
[21:11] through the prer and would believe such
[21:14] a message that an angel come down and
[21:16] spoke to him but what if the man would
[21:19] said I saw his message Vindicated
[21:24] amen he had said let me quickly give you
[21:27] your papers and get out of this
[21:30] Society times change but people
[21:33] don't it would have probably happened
[21:36] again
[21:37] today they would have been thr out of
[21:40] their
[21:41] churches but the Shepherds felt
[21:44] completely at ease in that place with
[21:47] God's
[21:48] lamb and any good shepherd does the same
[21:52] thing when a Good Shepherd over the
[21:54] sheep can see the word of God made plain
[21:57] and Vindicated of what he promised to do
[21:59] that Shepherd's right at home I don't
[22:01] care what anybody else says there's God
[22:04] promised it and God did it they say the
[22:06] days of Miracles is passed there's no
[22:08] such a thing as the baptism of the
[22:09] spirit there's no such thing as the
[22:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost that was for
[22:13] the apostles but let a true Shepherd of
[22:16] the word preach it in the power of the
[22:19] Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the
[22:21] same yesterday today and forever Peter
[22:23] said on the day of Pentecost the
[22:25] promises un you and your children and to
[22:27] them as far off even as as many as the
[22:29] Lord Our God shall call wherever he
[22:31] calls a promise and the same blessing is
[22:34] true and let a genuine word feeding
[22:38] Shepherd see that Vindicated all the
[22:41] theologians in the world can't take it
[22:42] away from
[22:43] him because he know God said so and it
[22:47] happens that's all it's just God's word
[22:52] always his word was made flesh and was
[22:56] dwelling among them and they knew would
[22:59] not he promised the same thing in this
[23:03] day I wonder if we would recognize
[23:06] him the proud and wise had never
[23:10] received such a thing as that and they
[23:13] believed if there was such a thing as
[23:17] the Messiah on Earth it would certainly
[23:21] have to come to their denomination amen
[23:24] it would be their group would receive it
[23:26] or it wasn't right am
[23:29] now just think right
[23:33] hard if it ain't in their group then did
[23:36] you notice
[23:38] then God never chose any out of their
[23:41] group but he chose that who wasn't
[23:44] connected with any of it because one
[23:47] group had said you see what we
[23:49] did and they do the same
[23:53] today but God chooses the nobody that's
[23:56] the reason he chose the shepherd
[23:59] the Shepherds was completely at home
[24:01] with the god lamb in their midst his
[24:04] word made flesh among them the proud and
[24:07] wise never received it pass by we could
[24:10] say as much for today or in any age it
[24:13] was the same things in the days of
[24:15] Martin Luther same thing in the days of
[24:17] John Wesley is the same things in the
[24:19] days of the
[24:22] Pentecostals but God stops for No Man's
[24:24] organization he moves his Spirit right
[24:26] on to vindicate his word would have to
[24:31] be and come in the class to their own
[24:34] Council or they wouldn't receive it as
[24:38] they're so head strong today all the
[24:41] churches that they're going to do such
[24:43] and such and unite all the churches
[24:45] together if they're looking for a
[24:47] messenger now who can unite all the
[24:49] Protestants Catholics and Orthodox
[24:52] everything together and make one great
[24:55] church our brethren
[24:58] I've had the privilege of preaching to
[25:00] hundreds of different religions and
[25:03] there's good man in all of them but now
[25:06] you remember I am
[25:08] prophesying every organization will have
[25:11] to accept this or not be an
[25:14] organization it's forcing him did you
[25:16] read the Tucson paper today or a
[25:20] Catholic priest help ordaining in the
[25:22] paper ardain in Missouri a Protestant
[25:26] clergyman and who was a recognized in it
[25:29] Presbyterians Baptists Lutheran and
[25:32] Assemblies of
[25:35] God it's in the Tucson paper
[25:38] today oh it's
[25:41] shocking it's not the man in there it's
[25:45] them ecclesiastical governmental heads
[25:48] that twist the thing in there the system
[25:52] that throws you into it whether you want
[25:54] to or not you can no longer be an
[25:57] organization and escape this wrath
[26:00] that's coming up the Earth and you see
[26:02] if that isn't right I may be gone when
[26:04] it happens look back on one of these
[26:07] tapes then if it wasn't I'm a false
[26:10] witness if it was I've told the
[26:14] truth they would have called it some
[26:16] kind of a working of an evil spirit
[26:19] against their positive
[26:22] thinking you're so much today about
[26:24] positive thinking and just put your mind
[26:27] on anything and think positive positive
[26:28] on it the devil can do that there's only
[26:32] one thing that's rules over all and
[26:35] that's God's
[26:38] word if you're thinking contrary to the
[26:40] word forget your
[26:42] thinking think on the
[26:45] word
[26:47] Messiah they thought would not be found
[26:50] in such a place a mess as that could you
[26:53] imagine a fine great high priest or
[26:57] clergyman all Polished in theology would
[27:01] come down to a stable full of
[27:04] manure and accept the message of a poor
[27:07] humble Shepherd that had no education
[27:11] and would come say see I can prove it to
[27:14] you this is the baby this is the
[27:19] messenger and you know what them people
[27:21] have said the man is honest he's very
[27:26] sincere in what he's saying
[27:29] but he's absolutely
[27:32] wrong I've seen people live such good
[27:35] lives until people wouldn't believe
[27:38] couldn't say nothing about him but they
[27:39] say he's sincerely wrong he just doesn't
[27:42] know what he's talking about God he
[27:44] wouldn't do such a thing as that but
[27:46] here they have the evidence and after
[27:50] the evidence go up there at the stable
[27:52] and see if that baby isn't laying there
[27:56] they' say you've been by be
[27:58] but some evil spirit that's caused you
[28:01] to say such yet it was according to the
[28:04] word of
[28:05] God and they were too blind to see it
[28:08] because their theology had blinded
[28:12] them what a
[28:14] tragedy caught in such a place in such a
[28:19] mess as this was in a
[28:22] stable when they had a beautiful place
[28:24] for him to come they had everything
[28:26] fixed for him to come and then them to
[28:28] think that he would come down and go and
[28:30] not bring their teachers the message and
[28:32] would give it to a bunch of unlearned
[28:34] Shepherds and then bring his own son and
[28:37] have him born in a a stable a common
[28:41] Livery
[28:43] stable well in in a Manger of
[28:46] hay why it couldn't be so they wouldn't
[28:49] believe it because it was so humble and
[28:52] it's so simple that's how the wise
[28:55] always overlooks it it's so simple it
[28:59] confounds them they look for a god way
[29:01] out there when he's right here they're
[29:04] looking for something way Yonder when
[29:06] it's right here with them now Christ
[29:09] risen from the dead the same yesterday
[29:11] today and
[29:12] forever all their great things was
[29:16] bypassed but it sure was the truth that
[29:20] there was a
[29:22] messiah we know it today we believe it
[29:26] today we kep it
[29:29] today but then if God promised something
[29:32] for this Christmas promis something for
[29:35] this day and proves that it's so and we
[29:38] still walk away from it we're just in
[29:40] the same class thing was back there at
[29:42] that day that bypassed it because it
[29:45] don't does not come in our
[29:47] denominational
[29:49] taste that's why we're such a mess this
[29:52] Christmas Jesus Christ is not dead he's
[29:56] alive he's here to today amen the Bible
[30:00] said he's the same yesterday today and
[30:01] forever he said in St John 14:12 he that
[30:05] believeth on me not he that makes
[30:07] believe he that says he believes he that
[30:10] believeth on me the works that I do
[30:13] shall he do
[30:15] also and More Than This shall he do
[30:17] because I go to the father and I've seen
[30:20] him in my own life do more of the same
[30:24] works that he did then than it's written
[30:26] in the pages of this Bible amen and he
[30:28] goes over the top of the head and the
[30:30] wise today and revealed to babes such as
[30:33] we'll learn that Jesus prayed
[30:35] for it is true he's done more than he
[30:39] I've seen in my day of my 33 years of
[30:42] ministry I've seen him do more than I
[30:45] have read of him doing in the Bible more
[30:47] of the same thing that no matter what he
[30:50] did then do you think the srin believ
[30:52] him well they said you're
[30:55] Bewitched but find out where they made
[30:58] their mistakes was to find out and
[31:00] finding out not what their Creed said
[31:03] but what the word said Messiah would do
[31:05] in their day there's where we make the
[31:08] mistake today not searching the
[31:10] scriptures Jesus told them search the
[31:12] scriptures in them you think you have
[31:13] eternal life and they are they that
[31:15] testify of me they tell you who I am
[31:20] notice God forew they would do this
[31:24] that's just why he had to take it to
[31:26] Shepherds he knew knew they wouldn't do
[31:28] it they wouldn't receive it now do you
[31:31] see why it had to be
[31:33] Shepherds why
[31:34] Shepherds theologians wouldn't receive
[31:37] it why Shepherds again would it come
[31:39] contrary to his word no they were
[31:41] shepherds they know sheep and that's
[31:43] what he was born a sheep a lamb
[31:47] notice he was the lamb they were they
[31:51] were the only kind that would accept him
[31:55] a Shepherd was the only thing would
[31:57] accept the lamb
[32:00] they know how to take care of it and so
[32:03] is it today when we get the Lamb's
[32:05] message now striking the most humblest
[32:11] uneducated man adoring Emmanuel in a
[32:17] stable the most and there were people
[32:21] out there at the same days teaching
[32:24] their theology great crowds drawing
[32:26] everywhere from all over the land they
[32:29] come to sacrifices which Jehovah said
[32:31] was a stench in his
[32:33] nostrils and here was humbled shephers
[32:36] in a stable adoring
[32:40] Emmanuel God himself made flesh and land
[32:43] in a
[32:45] stable see how we with our great
[32:49] learnings and our head sticking back
[32:51] like we know something and God bypasses
[32:54] the whole
[32:56] thing he does what he promises to do and
[33:00] he always does that but think of these
[33:03] lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a
[33:06] Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking
[33:10] sure is then out after they had adored
[33:15] him and realized
