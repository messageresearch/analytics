through and that will be by his blessing and by his mercy that you come through it amen wonderful wonderful let's just go ahead and jump right into the scriptures here musicians thank you being on wednesday night we'll just jump right in that way we can get you out in a reasonable hour [Music] if you'll turn with me to the book of joshua chapter 1 1-8 i have quite a few pages and notes here so you just be in prayer here that i don't need to use them all and we'll get out as quick as we can i have a thought here i'm a little nervous so i'm talking fast all right that i want to look into and i want to look into following joshua is to fulfill the message god gave moses and maybe as a sub-context is that in all of it here was just jehovah fulfilling his promises to abraham now that may sound like all things that have happened in the past or an old testament or old testament thing something that's in the bygones but we know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we had a prophet come in this day who said he was a typologist and he took us both back into nature and back into scripture and he said you have to be able to follow it from genesis to revelation and see where god did it the same way over and over and over again and that way you can place yourself in the word and find out where you're at in that cycle god has you in all right joshua 1 uh 1-8 and we're going to read quickly now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses is minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses for from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so shall i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prosper withers whoever they'll go is this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success let's just pray heavenly father lord we just want to take these few scriptures and notes and thoughts lord and surrender them all to you lord if it's something you desire to use to be a blessing to your people then so be it and if not lord then we're just a vessel in your use father i ask you bless your people and have your way in this service we pray in jesus name amen you may be seated now we know that according to the message of the hour we've come to a point in place where we are in a position brother ram says we're in a third exodus and we know in the first exodus it was moses calling israel a nation out of a nation out of the nation of egypt and he had to go in and bring them out according to promise you see it wasn't just all of a sudden something moses decided to do because he did have a stage in his life where he just decided to go do that he thought i'm the man to do it and i'm going to go do it but he tried to do it the wrong time completely out of god's will but trying to go in and take the people out and deliver himself was out of god's will but him trying to do it at the wrong time and being forced out of egypt was not out of god's will think about that god needed something to drive him out of his cushy place in egypt where he thought he was going to do it his way and deliver them by his own power so he could take and deliver him from himself first so he could use him to come back and deliver a people you see so it looks like moses did the wrong thing and what he was attempting to do was wrong but god had it in his plan the whole time okay so we know that and in this day and age we had a prophet come and what did he come to do he came to call a church out of denomination okay so now if we begin to walk through start thinking about it put on your spiritual thinking caps we're stepping back we're looking into the old testament types so that we can see where are we at what is happening now in our day in our time not just during the day and time of the prophet not just during the day and time of moses but now we've gone on we can see moses my servant is dead the prophet has gone off the scene so now we can see we are placing ourself in time in the scripture so now what is the next steps because if god did it one way before he's doing it that same way again right now okay now there's a lot of controversy within the message i'm sure there's a lot of controversy in in joshua's time you know many many are stuck we're stuck on moses and moses's message you know they stayed stuck on moses's message and moses and never actually dug into his message and what it said and what it meant the promises for them meant for the next four or five thousand years to the days of christ do you know they stay stuck there they never actually got into the revelation of moses's message on what was coming for them and what their opportunities what the promises were for them and they stayed in that cycle going round and round but we want to take a a quick look here is that many people maybe want to stay and cling to moses cling to the prophet on this side and then you come on this side and and you have the people over here who are we don't need the prophet anymore we don't need this we don't need that you have all your eighth messengers you have extra people coming out they're the ones to lead you and fo to take you and show you the right way and they want to discard the prophet altogether and now we know by a prophet's message that it'll be somewhere right down the middle of that okay you see the chaos to the right you see the chaos to the left okay you're gonna be right in the middle now i gotta warn you you get in the middle and get ready because you're going to see a fight even greater and tougher and harder than if you wanted to go to the far right or the far left because you're going to be pressing down the middle of road and those on the right and the left will be throwing stones at you trying to knock you off trying to knock you off your path okay so here we are what we want to do is we're going to take a look first thing when god commissioned joshua okay and maybe we want to we want to think about who who does joshua represent and who does the promised land what does the promised land represent and you know they kind of if you study the message they intertwine and they have a similar representation we know that both joshua is a representation of the holy spirit and of christ and also the promised land is a representation of the holy spirit in your life stepping into the holy spirit and we'll go over that i'm going to try and stay mindful of the time so we're going to probably hit a lot of things what i want to do here is give you a lot of highlights and then you'll see what i'm driving for is you take those highlights home you know maybe you didn't bring a notebook and pen or maybe taking notes is not your thing and you're not really good at it luckily for you we're in a time and an age where you can go back and reference this as many times as you would like so you're in luck beyond that you're blessed we're very blessed okay so you'll notice in these first eight verses of joshua god makes tells him moses and my servant is dead okay we got to move on from here now therefore arise don't stay where you're at get up keep moving keep moving you have to keep moving forward you see god is never standing still he's always moving and you're gonna you've got to follow with him you see the children of israel have been doing that all the way through the message even with moses they weren't just following moses but as moses followed the pillar of fire they followed moses see but here something was about to switch something was about to change now it's the eyes are coming off of moses and going fully and totally on the pillar of fire now the people as individuals as families and as the church eyes are set on the pillar of fire stepping and moving forward now following that pillar of fire and not following just a profit or following the man but now there's been a relationship change eliezer has passed off rebecca to isaac okay we're going somewhere and if you don't make that handoff you're not going to enter into the promised land you see whoever wanted to enter into the promised land had to leave off following moses because if they still wanted to follow moses we know he went up into the wilderness onto the mountain we know and he died and the angel lords packed him away he had no grave so i'm sure there was many people in the camp were like we have no proof he's dead we'll just go out into the mountains and look for him we ain't just following you joshua because you say so moses is our prophet and away they go into the mountains and guess what the mountains were this side of the promised land okay but you'll notice in his commission to joshua the lord emphasizes joshua i'm not giving you a new message you are going to be leading these children in a fulfillment of the message i gave moses he said stick to that message believe that message meditate on that message day and night because in there are the promises of your inheritance in the promised land so you see it's right in the middle we're following joshua as joshua leads us into claiming the promises in the message moses brought to us given him by a pillar of fire so is it today as we step forward hold on getting ahead of myself a little bit i want to take a look at one other thing okay now we know the first thing they do is they they have to cross jordan okay they have to get past this representation of self this representation of the flesh this representation of death to oneself jordan means to descend and it's representation with death it means to lower yourself abase yourself and before you enter into the land of the promise of the holy ghost you're gonna have to humble yourself set yourself to the side so he can come in in dwell in your heart and take full control okay now the people were about to see that god was with joshua just like he was with moses why because he's going to do the exact same thing that he had done with moses with joshua but here's something key are you ready okay we could read it but just for your reference i'm just going to paraphrase the story through because you all know it and if you don't it's in joshua 3. go back and read it in fact go read the whole book of joshua some time as soon as you can jump into the scripture jump into the message jump into the the your bible read it see when whenever a thought strikes you and you take it up from the service something really strikes you in a service write that thing down even if it's one thing take it home and go back to the bible go back to the message how many of you have a smartphone here today oh good good how many of you have a computer at home how many of you have access to a computer anywhere you guys are really lucky you know why because maybe you're not a minister of 30 years in this message maybe you don't have the bible memorized maybe you're new to the message altogether maybe you're new to christianity but god has given us access to not only the scripture but to this message in a way to where even the unlearned and unknowing can go right in and begin searching out whatever it is that god has put on their heart and then begin anointing that to you as you begin to dig in and dig into the message you can go to that word search and find hopefully a language you understand and begin to type it out and begin to go in there and find this quote and find that quote and bring it bring it together and see where he mentioned a scripture and go read it in the scripture and if he if he mentions moses go read about moses if he mentions abraham go read about abraham if he mentions christ go jump into the gospels begin bringing it all together okay and you're gonna see like this is this there's a point to that it's all about entering into the promised land okay now there we are in joshua chapter three first thing he's doing is god has vindicated joshua's ministry to joshua and commissioned him and now he's going to vindicate joshua's ministry to the people here they go they come down to the water edge of jordan it's springtime and it says the jordan is overflowing its banks now based on where they crossed they don't know exactly how wide it was that day or whatnot but typically the jordan river is anywhere from 70 to 100 feet wide when it's not overflowing its banks and anywhere from 5 to 10 feet deep so now it's overflowing its banks we can be sure it's at least 100 feet wide and probably at least 10 feet deep now i was reading and just an excerpt on someone i forget who it was just online and they said the miracle was not that they crossed the jordan the miracle was that they crossed it on dry land scripture says they crossed it on dry land you see because even if you can clear the water i mean it rained all day today if you go stepping into the marsh you're going to be knee-deep in mud the ability to cross is extremely limited but god knew if he wanted to cross his people he was going to do more than hold back the water to hold back death but he was going to take away all the effects of death itself all the effects of that humanity of your flesh it's all going to go away it's all things that are compensated for by the baptism of the holy ghost you see too many times we try and hold on to our flesh you know whether it's family traits um and whether that's just family traits of well i'm whatever it is um depression you want to claim that for your family heart disease any type of ailment whether it's a physical ailment and uh let's say yeah my whole family the you know they're all real fire brands you push their button too much the wrong way and boom we're off to a start so don't get me going guess what that's what the holy ghost came for it came to remove that that's not even an option anymore you see because as a son and daughter of god if you want to receive the baptism of the holy ghost you have to give up your human rights that the rights to that human nature you know everyone's here we we are in a time of rights and we know brother and speaks about he said the lamb the sheep they give up all their rights but here's something good and i'll touch on this too and just wait for it but you know you get a whole new set of rights you do and we'll touch on that okay they're crossing the jordan now you'll notice go back and read it is joshua put everything in order the way it should be and for the people to have the victory he doesn't come up with a new idea he doesn't come up with some new message he takes the ministry that was put in order by moses with the promises of god and the word that was thus saith the lord to lead the people across jordan joshua didn't make anything of himself he didn't say watch me look at me look what i can do [Music] he said no god has already put a ministry in place for this day in this age a five-fold ministry he said and they're gonna take that word and they're gonna lead us across this jordan and as the ministry took the first steps you see that's the that's something that'll be a characteristic of any true ministry that god puts in place they will always lead you right into death itself they'll take those first few steps into the jordan because they know they're packing god's word they know they're packing thus saith the lord for your day and without fear or favor they'll step right in and you'll watch those waters part the waters of this world the people surrounding the thoughts the idea the chaos and as they do those waters will fall back because nothing can stand before thus saith the lord the word put in its place so here's the first thing joshua does is he puts the ministry and the word in its place before the people and the way they go to cross jordan and as long as the word stood in its place the people could cross every single one right through the word right through the word everyone through the word now everyone who did not want to take that route through the ministry and place and the word for that hour stayed on the other side they had come out of egypt they had gone all through they had learned really good church order moses taught him church order he put this church in order he set it straight he he set him straight on doctrine he said i'm straight on all kinds of stuff okay but they decided they weren't following joshua over they were staying on this side of the river they'd had enough this is as far as we're going to go they were still seat of abraham but they stopped short okay so now we see there's an order okay let's move on what we see when moses received his commission god came to him and got his attention in exodus 3 verse 1 and 6. i'm probably only going to read five but here's where moses he's out in the wilderness god's had him out here for a while he's been out here for 40 years wandering around with a bunch of sheep in the middle of the desert all his ideas of how to save the children of israel are done and over with as far as he's concerned i'm going to live out my life here me my wife my boys i'm going to walk around with these sheep and that's it he had no aspirations of his own anymore he hardly even thought of the children of israel back in egypt he had failed that's good that's good that's where each one of us has to go that's where we all have to get to a point where we realize that we in ourselves are a failure and at that point now god has him where he's ready to work with him and he comes down and he gets his attention and in verse five and he's he sees the the burning bush it attracts him it draws him in and when he gets there the lord speaks to him out of the bush moses responds and the lord tells him and he said draw nigh not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet from the place whereon thou standest is holy ground here he is he's meeting the pillar of fire for the first time we see the requirements for coming on to this place god speaks to him from out of the bush and we see his experience he can't go there with any man-made idea any man-made protection of any kind he has to step into that presence just him and god alone there's something about it god talks about the steps of the righteous order to the lord he talks about the footsteps of the the ministry he for something about it it's something god really focuses on your footprints but it matters to him on how and where you make those footprints you can't just make it with your own ideas and he has him take off his shoes okay now we're not going to focus here but my reason for pointing this out is now we're going to jump to joshua 5 13-15 they've crossed the jordan they're on the other side joshua is a great general and he goes to see the city they're going to be attacking you see they're in atlanta promise it's all theirs but they still got to fight see brother brown said that's how you know this is a representation of the holy ghost is you get the holy ghost and measures but you're gonna have to fight for every promise it's not it's gonna be given to you you see when they crossed into the promised land within moments and the day after they crossed into the promised land they began to partake of the promises of the land the first fruits the old corn of the land the original the original word the original seed and when they do the manna that they've been receiving for over 40 years in the wilderness ceases that manner just fell from heaven they didn't have to work for it they didn't have to do nothing it just fell they went outside their tent kind of happened chance just kind of well it's always here i guess i'll pick some up today gone why because ministry was changing god wasn't bathing his people anymore he said you want it you've got to fight for it you're gonna have to dig in you have to go find it you're gonna have to search it out that's what he wants for each one of you yeah you're going to come in through stages of your life justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost when he gets you there maybe you've been having the milk of the word all the way up until here boom when you get here you're crossing over into meat territory you're crossing over into where it's actually going to take you some work to get the nutrients out of the food you can't just swallow you better be careful just swallowing you'll choke on it you'll choke on it god wants you to start digging in deeper and deeper breaking it down finding out what is these promises that are meant for me what is my inheritance and moving forward okay so here he is captain of the host joshua he's the general over the people but he's about to have an experience just like moses just like moses because every son and daughter of god called of god is gonna have to have a similar experience with the pillar of fire maybe for you it'll be a burning fiery bush in the wilderness maybe for some of us like joshua will be we'll be there surveying the land and asking god lord what do i do how do i take this promise and he'll come to you like he did to joshua and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho they lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand you see now that pillar of fire is not just something in passing it's not just a symbol but it's taken on flesh christ himself embodied and you think wow joshua would recognize an angel lord immediately he didn't he didn't no and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto a servant now look at the similarity here he showed up in a different form but the approach is the same and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place wherein thou standest is holy and joshua did so here it is same experience they had to both of them in order to lead the people had to have that same experience with the pillar of fire they couldn't just feed off of well we've been following the pillar of fire through moses and that's good enough no each one had to have that experience with that pillar of fire meet him on her own grounds all right okay uh the power of decision 1955 that's where we read a quick part of this quote um oh i feel religious my know that the holy ghost is here the same plural fire that led the children through the wilderness and went with them to the promised land you see here confirmation is the same polarifier with moses with joshua with the children of israel now today in our time jesus christ same yesterday today and forever jehovah the old is jesus of the new he just takes keeps changing form you see in 40 years he changed form when he came to moses he was a burning bush you know that joshua's experience with him was greater than moses because then moses asked lord let me see you he put him up in the cleft of the rock and he said when i pass by i'll put my hand over as i pass by and you'll see me the backside and he did and he said he looked and he saw it it was as the back side of a man but here joshua saw him face to face eye to eye it was greater he's changing forms he's revealing himself to his people as they enter into the promise all right now think these are types these are types keep keep that in there think about it let your let your mind as god would work on your heart do the walking as the prophet say through the scripture think about it this is not this is one instance i share with you he did it all through the scripture from beginning here with all the way from genesis i mean here we are we've barely made it to joshua we're barely into the sixth book of the bible there's 66 books my friends there's so much more this is one story in the sixth book don't stop here don't just take it as a good sermon go search it out dig in see who else he did it for so if you can see he did it for more than one person he'll do it for you too okay now let's keep moving okay where did i stop um the same pillar of fire that led the children through the wilderness went with them to the promised land here he is with us tonight even had his picture taken all over and over showing the same signs and wonders whose picture was taken the pillar of fire jesus christ himself that's important to remember because too many people put too much on moses and not on the pillar of fire that was over the tabernacle okay we're not we don't take nothing from moses we don't take nothing from the prophet but we're following a pillar of fire and we need it's more important to know who that pillar of fire was than to know who the prophet was because if you never knew the prophet you never knew his name but if you came and met the pillar of fire face to face you'll never be the same again you could know the prophet's name you could know all about his life and you can end up like janice and jamborus in the wilderness who opposed him said moses we know your faults we know you killed an egyptian you're not the only holy one amongst us and you know what happened to them the earth the world swallowed them and their families up whole they left egypt they made it through justification they made it into a point where the church was put in order they had good church order but their focus was on moses and they found fault with moses and guess what moses had plenty of faults to find because god never meant for the focus to be on moses he meant for it to be on the pillar of fire but the people rejected him at mount zion because they were so focused on moses and all those people who were focused on moses perished in the wilderness okay now showing the same signs and wonders what are we scared about by faith don't care i feel like caleb let me have that bunch over yonder amen and if you want to read the rest of that it's the power decision 1955. there's a whole message out there for you to listen to it gets even better it really does but i want to jump into now because he mentioned caleb and i think caleb is a representation of the true believer in the church okay now in joshua 14 5-15 we're coming to the end they've fought a lot of battles already they're in there clear claiming the promised land caleb has been fighting for the last 80 years he's been fighting for 80 years he was five years old when they left egypt and he's been fighting for 80 years he's been through every church split he's been through every church problem he's had to bear with the people when the people didn't think they could take the promise and he had he went right back out there with them all right here we go again these people let's just wander around another 40 years and finally he's made it to the promise he's in here you would think you made it buddy relax take it easy that wasn't caleb that wasn't his way caleb had a promise from moses's message for him about his inheritance and he wasn't going to stop until he had every bit of it he went to joshua he went to joshua to remind him of the promises in the word that were for him okay and he said and caleb the son of jeff neff that kenazi said unto him thou knowest the things that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadesh barnea you know and i know this is no secret you know why i'm here now let's jump down in verse 8 it says nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god you see there's going to be a consistency in his life no matter what stage of he is in whether he's coming out of egypt he's coming through the wilderness or he's going into the the baptism of the holy ghost there's something about the true believer is whatever stage they're in to the best of their ability that they wholly follow the lord their god to the best that they understand the word for that moment for their revelation in that hour they're following it but they're seeking for something more this is what i know right now i must stick to it the best i can i think too many times we we think we always think of the three believers in the church right the make the unbeliever the make-believer the believer but we forget that even in the believer's life there's multiple stages you know we always think justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost well these are all played out you had coming out of egypt you had going they had to be justified they had to be set free of their bondage just to get out of there now going through the wilderness they they need to get things cleaned up and sanctified moses is there you know he's giving them the basics don't kill don't commit adultery don't cleaning up their lives what is that sanctification setting the church in order and now they're going to step into the baptism of the holy ghost caleb has gone through each stage he's been there each stage he's ready now he's in the baptism of the holy ghost and moses swear on that day saying surely the land wherein thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god and on 11 as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and come in verse 13 and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of geneva hebron for an inheritance you see he'd been in the message for 40 years but his zeal and his fervor for the word hadn't changed every day he wanted a little bit more lord you gave me a great revelation yesterday but give me something more today i need something new this this morning i can't just sit back and and relax and say well my experience i remember that experience when i got back when i got converted it was a wonderful experience and i received the baptism of the holy ghost good enough no that wasn't good enough for caleb he wanted more because there was more to be had he had a promise and you know how he knew that promise he kept the word of moses in his heart he kept the message fresh and alive even all the years he spent fighting to help gain inheritance for everyone else he kept going back to the word of moses and saying there's something that is specific for me it's not just for the church it's not just for all of us there's something with my name on it because i know my name's on it because i'm in the message reading it and i see it it's there and i'll keep reminding joshua the holy spirit that that promise is made to me until i get it nonstop now i mentioned to you that they were stuck on moses as their prophet all the up to the time of christ many of them didn't recognize anyone else they never moved beyond moses you know how i know when jesus came they were following moses the man the prophet and not moses's message they had fixated on we have moses to our prophet and stop there they had memorized the message many of the ministers of that day could quote you the message by heart but they had no revelation of the message you see because christ didn't come with a new message he was simply a fulfillment of the message he said i've come to fulfill all these scriptures all throughout the old testament all these types i've come to fulfill them i am the manifestation of the message he is the revelation of that message but they were so fixated on god sent a prophet they had no idea what the message the prophets even spoke was you see in john 1 and 45 there were people who recognized him the disciples did philip for one he went to nathanael and he said we have found him of whom moses and the law and the prophets did right these were men who were in the word they read the books of moses they read the books of isaiah the scrolls of ezekiel and they saw the promise and they were waiting they were searching they were digging in like caleb they knew there was more to the promise so when they saw it they said there it is why because they had a revelation of the message and not just the fact that a prophet had given it you see it's not good enough just to know god sent a prophet most of the world in the 50s and 60s knew that but it wasn't revealed to them so they said things like we know we don't know anyone else which such a wonderful christian-like spirit and the love of god in his life or the power of god being manifested but we're pretty sure you're off in your doctrine you kind of went off the wagon there how much sense does that make it was the same thing in christ's time here in john 9 28 through 37 there was a blind man who'd received back his sight been born blind okay now don't think we've strayed from the book of joshua we're just trying to show it's the same we're moving on we want to move you through the timeline here and through time um so you can see it's not just old testament it's not just new testament then we want to move it to us and we want to do it as we go or wait to the end and if you need to wait to see all the evidence first that's okay and even if you get all the evidence you're still not sure go search it out for yourself in fact that's even better okay now the blind man then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses's disciples you see where they're at disciples of moses we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is now this man he was just a simple brother he said well i'm nobody but even being nobody i know that the only person who can open blind eyes is god and you know what they did the same thing people are doing yet today when you say god is still moving in our midst when you say there is god moving in a five-fold ministry and the power of the holy ghost revealing himself even more to the individual day by day they go how how is it you think you can be more spiritual than the prophet how does it think you can have a greater revelation than the prophet because they're so fixated on the man that they've elevated him to a place of sainthood that they can never attain and for anyone else to get there is sacrilege that's what they told jesus how dare you being a man claim to be the son of god and yet isn't that what each one of you are all here yet today to claim sons and daughters of god now how dare you why because we have a revelation of who we are you see now here's what the attack is and it's still the same today they answered and said unto him thou was also together born in sin and thus thou teach us and they cast him out you see if they can't contradict the message they'll go to personal attacks and when after the personal attack then they will completely shut you out from their circle of friends why because light and darkness cannot mix now we know all throughout the message where the man talks about draw the circle bigger and i say yes draw the circle bigger but as you draw the circle bigger if you walk in the light as he is in the light darkness will flee from the circle no matter how big you make it okay now one more just showing us the place that they were at john 5 45-47 and jesus himself speaking to them says do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even moses your very own prophet if you knew his message would condemn you and does condemn you that's why we stand in a place where the same message preached across the pulpit coming off of the tapes is both a message of deliverance and yet also a message of of judgment to the completely and totally lost because outside of a revelation and seeing yourself in the word as a son and daughter of god there's only one other way to see yourself and that's totally lost so it's the same message many people think well you know during one time there's a message of grace and then there's a message of judgment no it's the same message it's what has god revealed to you and how do you identify that's the sage this whole world's in right we know spiritual types the natural natural types of spiritual everyone's in a state where we they wanting to identify in some way and find their identity why because we're in a time of the separating of the wheat from the shaft the wheat from the weed and each one as they're being separated is coming to their identity coming to their identity if you see something happening in the natural you can be sure it's already happening in the spiritual because god always moves first and the devil tries to copy it so don't be alarmed or confused if you see something that's happening out there and you see something moving in a certain way say wow hmm that's what the devil's doing so when did god already do it the right way everyone's clamoring for rights caleb was going for his rights as a believer in the holy ghost because anything that's a promise to you in the word if you come at it the way god has promised it it's your right as a believer that's what this whole baptism of the holy ghost is about is a continuation a continuation a continuation until you come to that place of adoption where you stand on the same level as the father himself to speak the word now you and the word are so the same that he's not worried what will you say he's not worried well i'll give him power he's and you're going to speak a mercedes into existence he knows that your values are the same as his and you'll speak the truth in love that's where we saw a prophet we saw it go all through those stages for us ahead of us he got to the place where god gave him full authority to speak the word because he knew he would not move outside of what god wanted him to do he wasn't worried about it and he's not some saint greater and above us he just is a saint that came to fruition first we're all going to that same place you see so to lift him on a pedestal above us greater than is not good because now if he's somewhere between you and god you can never have that relationship with the father because you've placed someone between you and him you'll never get there but if you and him are on the same level then you both have access to the father you see caleb caleb did not come begging joshua for his promise he just came to remind joshua this is mine as mine by right of inheritance you cannot keep it from me i will fight till the breath has left my body to gain it [Music] all right just a few more minutes and we'll all right now we know that the signs the wonders the pictures that were taken around the prophet's message what were they all for the signs that moses had when he went to egypt what was it all about the signs all through the wilderness what was it about i'll tell you he was to get the people to christ all of it all of it was just to get the people to christ let me see here i'm gonna skip a few things because because like my my grandfather on my dad's side he used to he loved the message he loved being in the word and every once in a while you know he would read something and he'd share it with somebody he'd get excited about it at whether that was at church or someone around him and he'd share it with him they'd go wow where'd you get that from he said it's in the message they said which one he said all 1200 of them and you know that's how i feel sometimes i kind of feel like you know no there's many different forms of ministry that's why there's a five-fold ministry because there's something for everyone you know because sometimes as churches we get to a point where we get a little puffed up spiritually speaking and we are all the whole church is the church of ephesus you know we've all entered into the stage of adoption we're here we've made it so there's no need to preach anything else but it's not true we have people at all different stages and walks within the church and so there's going to have to be something for each one now i don't say that every minister has to find a way to cater to every person but the holy spirit in every message will have something for every person so guess what if it seems like it's really wow that's a lot to handle maybe for you because there's an ephesian message going out and that's not to belittle anyone it's just god speaking somebody was on their knees praying about it and god is speaking to them okay because that's the stage they're at and they have really been seeking but guess what even in that god will come speak to you if you'll pray too and guess what those of us maybe who've been in a message some from birth i got something to say on that too real quick you know people always want to ask well how long you been in the message you know those of us who are parents were in the message and well i was born in the message no you weren't you were not i hate to break your bubble you were not born in the message you know why scripture says all have sinned and come short of the glory of god born in sin shaped in iniquity where were you born you were born in sin my brother you just like the children of israel started out in egypt now by god's favor and grace you were also born into a family that gave you a head start out of egypt whether or not you took that was up to you you either chose to take it and you at least got into the wilderness a lot faster or you stayed in egypt for a lot longer than you should have and then there's some who come straight out of egypt they they didn't have that head start but they are into the wilderness and running through it towards the the promised land as fast as they can go and guess what those who search for it the most will get it first god doesn't play no games no favorites if you were born in a family where at least you got the message and and the word preached and given to you from a young age you're privileged okay but if you're not digging in you're not seeking you're not chasing it those who come in yesterday will pass you up in a moment how how much do you want it that's the key okay all right how to get that off my chest because people always ask that and we always are like born in the message no you're not no you're not so stop that you think you were born in a very fortunate position okay that's it now it's up to you to make take advantage of that position or not okay um oh my okay all right so we know that the promised land is a representation of the holy ghost and yet even as measure by measure we receive it the first baptism we stepped on to the land we're here baptism of the holy ghost now we know brother branham says he said where are you at now he said you're just a babe in christ isn't that so contradictory to all the denominational teaching denominational teaching was you're speaking first of all speak in tongues you have the holy ghost you have the holy ghost you're sealed you're done you're over well the truth is speaking in tongues has very little to do with it but you received the holy ghost you've just started you got the first measure there is an entire promised land to conquer but if you just stay here guess what you'll be surrounded by enemies until you start taking the next step and the longer you stay there the longer you'll deal with the same enemies over and over and over again the same temptation you said temtention with the holy ghost more so you know when you were in the wilderness they fought only a few battles and guess what it was all together joshua led them and moses stood above them in prayer and pretty much god just killed everyone in front of them hail and whatnot and people just dropping it was no real battle it was just to make them feel good like we're out here so they're out running around thinking they're doing something doing nothing mana is dropping from heaven they don't have to work for it but when you step into the promise now you're going to begin fighting like never before because now it's personal if you want it you're going to have to take it it's yours you have the title deed that's the holy ghost you have it it's in your hand you're looking at it it says this property belongs to me but isla until you put feet on the property and kick the squatters off you will never have the fruits of the land and you have to start one enemy at a time one enemy at a time and keep marching okay now as we're fighting it's important like joshua to always keep the ministry and the word in its place ahead of you if you get in front of the word you lose your protection stay behind the word you see that's what happened to the children of israel when they went after um when when aiken who had crossed into the promise he'd made it into the holy ghost he'd have the first baptism but there were still things of the world pulling at him you see and when he went in and he's fighting the battle he's pressing the battle there's something in the midst of his battle temptation was too great and he went and failed to it you know that's don't don't look down on aiken don't look down naked you know that's where adam fell adam in that garden of eden had entered into the stage walking up to adoption he was not at adoption he was going to adoption he was walking with the lord he was learning where he stood on the promises okay and from that level he fell and that's where we find aiken but that failing affected the children of israel it affected those around him you see and those things had to be cleaned up before they could move on so don't think well i got the the holy ghost i can let my guard down not for a second guard goes up higher than ever okay don't stop don't pause for a moment not to left not to the right that's the commission god gave joshua in his commission do you remember we read it okay it says turn not from it what the word the message of moses to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest so now we have details to what we're supposed to do with that message said don't don't go to the right don't go to the left and that message has been the same all through scripture all the way up into the book of revelations where it says do not add nor take away one dot or one tittle not even a form of punctuation don't move it not to the right or the left stay down the center of the word if you're not sure just keep praying just keep praying he'll reveal it to you so the the commission is still the same you see here we are we're seeing it's the same he gave it to joshua christ gave it to the disciples here we see in the book of revelations to us at the end time it's all the same it's been the same all through scripture he's still calling us and saying just stay with the word that was the vision brother branham saw the end time church even you know the church the world the the church world he saw them he said they weren't even even in line at all it was a rock and roll party the whole way through but even the chosen bride the church of the hour he said there at the end he started just getting out of line he started crying out stay in line stay in line stay in line stay with the message he didn't yell stay with the prophet he said stay with the message because the message is christ okay now i have multiple quotes here that are supporting statements to everything i've i've been saying but to read everything we'll run out of time and that's not necessary you see if i've tricked your heart just enough to go is there something to what he said or maybe you're thinking i don't know i don't know if what he's saying is just quite right that's okay too as long as it drives you back to the message i don't care where you're sitting in your heart right now whether your thought is i'm not sure if that's right or if your thought is i'm pretty sure that's right but until you know that you know go back to the message because you cannot properly sit here in church and say amen until you've been to the message first and you know what you're hearing to be the truth because that is the meaning of amen so be it means that's the truth and how can you say that's the truth unless you've proven it first unless you have an understanding of the truth how do you know what is true you are required brother branham himself the prophet of god said you owe it to yourself now i'm not going to read you the quote go find it where he said you owe it to yourself not just to take my word for it but take it back to the scriptures and prove that it's true why because he's not wanting you to just take his word for it he's wanting you to have a personal relationship with jesus christ the joshua of your hour so that you can claim the land because he knows as you go back to prove that it's the truth you'll run into more and more promises and as you run into more promises you'll see what you're missing out on as you show what you're missing out on you'll know what to claim okay so whether you're like yeah i trust him i think he's telling me the truth don't don't do that that's complacency that's what the children in the wilderness did the whole time yeah moses yeah so far he's been right let's keep following him every day we come out here there's more mana one time we complained then we had quail it's all good seems like a nice guy that won't get you any of the promise it's a nice life i guess if you like moving around a lot and never knowing where you're going to be tomorrow that's where a lot of people are when they're in the wilderness it's one day they're saved one day they're lost one day they're saved one day they're lost one day they're saved one day they can make it next day they can't one day their bride next day well maybe i'm just foolish version if i can just make it there i guess that's okay that's not where we want to stay we've all been through those stages all of us at one point or another maybe yours was very short and someone else was very long it doesn't make you any better just by god's grace so keep moving okay but we know the key to this is keeping the word in its place all right so i'm just going to read you two last quotes and then we'll we'll wrap this up um in the law having a shadow 1954 i think it's the second to the last one if you're trying to keep up with me here i know i'm all over the place let's see here and we're just going to start from where i i don't know if they kept the area where i put it in bold but about middle of the quote and all of god's word is written by inspiration there's not a contradiction in the entire bible if there is i want to see it it's nothing in there that's written now one quick thing i'm just gonna make it real quick though because if not i'll just branch off and i'll forget where i'm at in this quote um you see here brother random says if there is i want to see it he's unafraid you know too many people in this message and christians of today and ever actually all across the ages forget just today are extremely scared of anyone challenging their what they believe you know why because they're not fully for sure and what they believe they haven't entered into the promised land they're still wandering on the wilderness they're like well it's a promise but we haven't got there yet maybe maybe it's not there maybe it's not for us maybe it's not true i don't know and so when someone comes to him and says what is this you believe what's this nonsense oh oh i don't know yeah i don't i don't like talking religion when uh with in public or you know i just want to keep it to myself i know i i don't you don't know now maybe you're not an evangelist maybe you're not every single person you see hey hey you know you know jesus christ can save you you know jesus christ you know the prophet came maybe you're not maybe you're just that quiet presence that god is working through that is a lived life maybe we all all of us are called to a different ministry each and every one of us but when you are called to your ministry and you know where you stand in the word when when the time is right and someone comes to you and ask you of this hope you'll be ready with an answer unafraid unafraid because you know where you stand okay all right all right i'm doing what i said i was going to not do you prediction like if there is i want to see it you see no no fear show it to me in fact i'm going to search scripture over to see if there's a contradiction because after i've searched it over if someone else comes to me and says hey there's a contradiction i'll be like no there isn't like yeah there is no there isn't how do you know i've searched the whole thing not one and if you would like i'll show you how what you think is a contradiction isn't because i can show you and take you to each step because i've already been through it okay study to show yourself approved right all right i want to see it it's nothing in there that's written that cannot be straightened out by the word of god if it's rightly put in its place now brother random always used that that terminology said if you put it out of its place you end up with the cow picking grass on top of a tree you notice how misconstrued that is first of all the cow's on the tree but now he's picking grass he's not even picking leaves you're really mixed up it'd be one thing if you could somehow get the cow on top the tree and then at least be eating leaves that would make some sense but you have a cow picking grass in a tree none of it makes sense that's how confused you are because you don't know where you're at or where you're going or what you're doing why because you're not fighting for it you're just okay every day i come to church the pastor throws out some mana for me i take that home it kind of sustains me till wednesday and i come back and he throws some more mana out for me and i take that home but one time i didn't make it to church in between and then the mana started getting moldy on me like i really it started wasn't making no sense and i couldn't figure it out and i was like wow maybe i shouldn't even go back to that church because they're confusing me well yeah you're confused because church is not the place where you learn everything whoa you didn't know that did you you thought well i go to church and they're going to teach me everything i need to know no no because he said i'll send you the holy ghost and he will teach you all things now he did for those of you who are going to get ahead and go wow we don't even need church the holy ghost to teach me everything slow down the holy ghost himself put the ministry in place in the church to teach the church now if you get the holy ghost guess what you're gonna need the ministry to teach you hey the way you're dressing you shouldn't do that sister is cutting your hair don't do that why because you're going to take the holy ghost take this message you're going to dig through the quotes you're going to get down you're going to read the scriptures you're going to find them and you're going to say lord reveal to me why this is so i'm not gonna follow it because this is what i'm told to do i'm not gonna just follow it because this is our way of life i'm not gonna just follow it because this is what the church says i'm not gonna follow it just because this is what the pastor said i'm not even gonna follow it just because that's what the prophet said but i'm gonna take it all the way back to the word and ask god to reveal it to me myself so that i know that i know that i know okay so we put the word rightly in place but we'll never do it by man's understanding never you'll never be able to just figure it out okay the holy spirit wrote the bible and the holy spirit is the only one who can interpret the bible and he will give it to us as we have need as you're going through your walk and your stage of life god will reveal it to you as you search it out do you have a desire to search it out he'll reveal it to you just start searching take on a step take one more step why because will adam told he said the the parable he gave us just like jesus gave parables the prophet came to us and spoke to us in the same way the parable of the man with the lantern and they asked him he said well how do you know where you're going through these dark woods he said i have this lantern he said well can you see where you're going he said no but as i move the light moves with me and i can see just one more step at a time one more step at a time don't don't try and figure it all out just take one more step as you take that step a little more light on your path will show just keep moving don't stop don't don't hunker down keep moving don't do like most of the church world throughout the ages have done brother iran said they took the gospel on what they thought it was and they put a period on the end full stop and they said that's it that's the revelation and you know that's where many of us find ourselves today we've read the message perhaps we've read a scripture our favorite minister preached it a certain way and we go there it is that's the answer that is what that quote and that scripture means and then we sit down done close close our bible close up the message we know what that means no need to press on and then you know maybe a week later a year later 10 years later 30 years later someone comes along and and picks up that quote and reads that that scripture and preaches it from a whole another angle and you are so set in your ways we are so set in our ways and we go no no can't be false doctrine no no stop it the scripture is never ending as he reveals it there's more and more we could read one line out of one verse and if we just took that one and that's all we had we would never end of things to minister on and revelation to be had because his word is without end and so how how arrogant of you how arrogant of me to think that we have the full revelation of even one bit of the scripture and we have some type of copyright to that scripture where no one else can touch it we've got it you want access to it right here come to me if you try and take it in any other way you're in trouble stop it god is gonna come to each individual he didn't come outside the walls of jericho to joshua in a fiery burning bush he didn't but if we judged him by moses's experience word for word we'd say uh-uh no way a man you saw a man who claimed to be god you saw god don't you know the scripture says no man shall see his face joshua you have lost it you saw him you talked to him you challenged him to battle yeah he wasn't the first jacob was at least that we have knowledge of he wrestled with the angel with that pillar of fire until it gave him his inheritance if he hadn't there would have been no inheritance for jacob who was jacob israel so here we see the taking of the land is from all this time back the promise to abraham and then jacob wrestling for the promise and now it's coming 400 years later it's coming to pass maybe there's times when we'll wrestle we'll go round and round and we'll be given a promise you may not see that promise come to fruition for 400 years so hopefully they come up with better medicine but that's where abraham was too he wandered through his wilderness he got called out of a pagan land he had to leave his family he wanders through the wilderness all over the place he gets lost a few times he ends up in a few of the wrong places until finally hits the place where god can use him and he's ready to enter into adoption you see it's the same it's the same no matter which story you pick up you'll find it's the same so if it's the same for all of them it's the same for us don't go read the bible claim it begin to read it as if wow um my okay that's what god did there how does that how is that represented in my life and if i don't see i'm at the promised land yet okay am i am i still kind of leaving egypt no well i think maybe i've got across the red sea i'm that far okay i'm learning some church order all right now i know where i need to go that's okay it's okay what's important is to identify where you're at right now because if you don't know where you're at you'll never get where you're going okay no all right one last thing i want to just show you real quick um you say well you've typed out egypt the wilderness and the promised land is justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost different stages that god's working in our lives in all of us at different times and points but you know there's a there's a type in the new testament too because we know brother brandon preachers he preaches on and he said joshua types is a type of ephesus ephesus is in is the new joshua is the old testament version of ephesus the ephesian church right entering into the promises so if ephesians is the type of joshua then there has to be types of egypt and of the wilderness and you'll find that scriptures are not just written the way they're written for a purpose but even the books are placed where they're placed with purpose everything god does is with a purpose okay and you'll find the two books leading up to ephesians are corinthians and galatians now i'm going to give you a few little nuggets you go dig into these books and read them and find out i already have and i'll do it again and again because there's more in there but in the book of corinthians paul comes to him and the first thing he does is he starts trying to correct them they're everyone is got their own thing going on um they are in a stage of division they don't know who's following who everyone has a favorite pastor one some of them are claiming to follow the prophet paul and he's better than your pastor and i'm not having nothing to do with your pastor and what you guys believe isn't right and on top of that there all this arguing about what is right what isn't right who's pastor is better and they're missing all that they can't even see their own in front you know in front of their own two eyes to see their their nose as you would say because right in the middle of their church they not only even think it's anything wrong with it there's a there's a man who's in a relationship with his own mother which i think if you go back take it back into scripture it wasn't his biological mother but it was his father's wife and no one is concerned about that the sin in the church just well my my pastor is right and your pastor is wrong my church is better than your church that's the stage the corinthian church was in they're stuck in there they're not even out of egypt arguing about who's who's church and who's pastor and who did right and who's baptized by who and and this nonsense and we get over to the the book of galatians the church there okay they got things a little bit more straightened out they got no one living in sin in in adultery at least they got some things figured out um but their first thing paul does is he goes hey guys it sure didn't take you guys long from the time that i spoke it to you actually if you could put up galatians 1 and verse 8 that would be great but in just a short period of time you guys are all running off after weird and strange doctrines everyone's got his own interpretation he said what happened if you could put up uh galatians one and eight okay and here's his rebuke to them to try and straighten them out but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that's which we have preached unto you let him be accursed he said i'm putting this all to a stop real quick so they've made it out into the wilderness but their church order their understanding of the word is just all over the place then if you take and you step into the book of ephesians paul begins speaking to the church and he just begins greeting them and what a pleasure it is to speak to them and by the fifth verse he is straight into his message on adoption of sons and daughters of god see this is a church who's in order who's ready to move on to adoption they're ready they set themselves in order they're not following some weird doctrine they're in the message they're in the holy ghost and now they're ready to take the land step by step word by word you see it's the same thing playing out and within our lives we'll all go through a stage of the corinthian church we've all gone through a stage of the galatian church and now hopefully at some point we're reaching that stage of the ephesian church where we're stepping into the word we're stepping into that adoption we're stepping to that place we're saying lord if you can use me anyway i'm yours father let me be a surrendered vessel lord i'm not worried what whatever wherever you want to have me to be a blessing that's where i want to go whatever church whatever pastor or leadership you want to put over me that's fine i'm okay with that whatever you know however you would desire to lead me lord that's where i want to be and saints that's where we want to come to not this infighting not not all the nonsense of the world around us we we want to come out of egypt we want to come out of the wilderness that experience was good but there's more as we enter into the promise there's more and it's never ending there's never anything just you got to keep fighting you got to keep pressing get into the word if the musicians would want to come saints if you want it there's more there for you don't read your bible once and feel like you've read it all you've missed so much and i don't say because you're not a good reader or you don't have a good understanding it's just not all of it could be revealed to you at one time it's impossible but he's only able to reveal to you as you have desired to know you see he's he is hampered by your either belief or unbelief at any stage in your walk you either believe there's nothing more there to be found or you believe it's endless if you believe there's nothing more to be found you won't find anything you could be surrounded by the most wonderful treasure but if you didn't believe there was any treasure to be found you would never see it you'll walk right by it you won't even see it you could you could step on it you wouldn't know what it was there you did oh tripped another stone here and you just went over a precious gem but if you're searching you'll be looking wow look it i think there's something more there it is i found it you go you pick it up you'll treasure that you put that away and you think wow if there was something more here there's got to be something more somewhere else you know keep searching keep searching keep searching never stop searching saints never stop [Music] they wait upon the lord christmas [Music] oh oh [Music] is [Music] let's just buy our house and pray together let's just pray that the scripture says blessed are those that hunger and test after righteousness they shall be filled let's ask the lord to give us spiritual appetite for his word that we will not just be seeking to know that we will get in the word because we love the word just that love for the world while the bible will speak directly back to you the words will speak back to you when you read the scripture i see the holy ghost that the holy spirit moving some of the young people have the opportunity of god dealing with them from reading their bibles from listening to a preacher preaching that's wonderful heavenly father lord jesus we just want to thank you tonight lord our father that you have reminded us lord father not to turn to the right now to turn to the left

tonight thank you father god for all the times lord thank you father for the emphasis of the holy spirit the emphasis lord is that we go back to the word because every time we read the word every time
