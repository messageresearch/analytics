[36:40] Hebrews 5 we are reading from from
[36:44] Hebrews 58
[36:58] Hebrews

[37:19] suffered may the Lord add His blessings
[37:22] to the reading of his word amen shall we
[37:26] be seated
[37:35] I titled my message
[37:37] tonight the
[37:39] Bedrock of
[37:43] Victory the
[37:45] Bedrock of
[37:48] Victory praise the
[37:51] Lord I have not been around long enough
[37:58] praise the
[38:02] Lord I'm 60 years
[38:05] old and still
[38:10] counting so that looks like a long time
[38:13] and it
[38:15] is because I remember in those days when
[38:19] I would hear somebody say I'm 50 I'm 60
[38:23] and I was around 20 I said why this
[38:25] person is old
[38:29] and here I am
[38:34] 60 and I can only thank
[38:38] God for bringing me this
[38:42] far praise the
[38:45] Lord because my mom told me as I shared
[38:48] once upon a time before I got to 6
[38:52] months old my
[38:54] auntie put something in in a bottle
[38:58] for me to
[39:02] drink it was just God it wasn't my
[39:04] mother who saw
[39:07] it because I was sick and I had come
[39:09] from the hospital she gave me the first
[39:12] medication when it was time for the
[39:14] second
[39:15] one she went and took it and realized it
[39:18] was tampered
[39:20] with she pour some in a spoon and
[39:24] realized the color was
[39:26] different she called my father's
[39:31] attention and lo and behold it was
[39:35] something else but
[39:39] medicine I got
[39:41] drowned when I was around 8 years old
[39:44] completely
[39:48] drowned and in between then and now a
[39:51] lot has
[39:53] happened for me to be standing on my
[39:56] feet at 60 years years full of life and
[39:59] in good health it is nothing but the
[40:02] grace of
[40:03] God when I look at myself I don't see
[40:06] anything but the grace of
[40:08] God some people talk of Grace but I live
[40:12] by
[40:13] Grace I have said it time and again that
[40:16] the day I fall dead it is the perfect
[40:19] will of God because God has saved me
[40:22] from time and again oh my goodness I
[40:25] can't count that is what that's not what
[40:27] what we are here to do tonight but I
[40:29] just want to thank the almighty
[40:31] God when I
[40:34] say I have
[40:39] not come far I don't mean my physical
[40:43] age 60 years it's a lot of time it's a
[40:48] lot of
[40:49] time it's just the grace of
[40:52] God and I cherish it every single day
[41:02] sometimes I see
[41:06] danger and I walk in
[41:09] it and God has always proved in his
[41:13] himself the Lord our God is
[41:17] faithful
[41:23] now when I say that I have not been
[41:26] around for long long but I've been
[41:29] around for long to know that it is
[41:34] possible for us to walk through these
[41:37] doors every Wednesday every
[41:42] Sunday and yet year in year
[41:47] out never meet the person of the Lord
[41:50] Jesus
[41:55] Christ that we can for short of meeting
[42:00] Christ even though we walk through the
[42:02] doors every single time there is
[42:05] church we stop at
[42:07] church but we never get to move Beyond
[42:11] church to meet
[42:14] Christ church does not give
[42:18] life there is only one
[42:21] lifegiver if you do not meet
[42:25] him I here to
[42:29] say that if you do not meet him you have
[42:33] no life
[42:36] whatsoever get a hold of
[42:39] him there is so much
[42:42] pressure so much pressure in the time we
[42:45] are living
[42:47] in
[42:48] economically politically
[42:53] socially you can mention it peer
[42:56] pressure
[42:58] a lot of the times when you talk of peer
[42:59] pressure The Young Ones think oh it's
[43:02] for the teenagers no there is peer
[43:04] pressure for any age group you can be
[43:07] 100 years and you still have peer
[43:13] pressure there is so much pressure and
[43:16] the devil is doing this to make sure
[43:19] that you don't have time to even read
[43:22] your Bible that you don't have
[43:25] time to even seek the face of God In
[43:28] Prayer that all you want to
[43:31] do is rest with the
[43:35] time overw yourself because the bills
[43:39] are mountain and mountain and mountain
[43:41] and you need to catch up with the
[43:44] bills so much
[43:46] pressure that you can't even stop to
[43:49] think about
[43:51] yourself we need to redeem the time
[43:55] because the days in which we are living
[43:57] are very evil praise the Lord and
[44:01] sometimes when you are able to even
[44:04] redeem the time guess what the Demons of
[44:08] Technology come to distract your
[44:12] attention
[44:15] Facebook Tik
[44:17] Tok
[44:19] Instagram
[44:21] WhatsApp mention
[44:23] them and when they
[44:26] come when you have been able to make
[44:28] time and they come what do they do they
[44:32] try to take your
[44:34] mind away before you realize you have
[44:38] wasted the day you have wasted the time
[44:41] and any time you waste that time is not
[44:44] coming
[44:45] back it's like pressing the
[44:49] trigger when that bullet leaves the
[44:51] chamber it never comes
[44:54] back you can put in another C CH but
[44:58] that one that left is never coming back
[45:01] that is the way time is if you lose the
[45:04] time for today for something you can
[45:07] never make up for
[45:09] it we try to convince ourselves oh I was
[45:12] supposed to read chapter so so and so of
[45:15] this verse I didn't I'm doing it
[45:18] tomorrow you never made it
[45:21] up praise the
[45:24] Lord tonight by the grace of God
[45:27] I am here to encourage you I'm not
[45:29] bringing anything new now
[45:33] this team I
[45:36] chose actually a brother that has come
[45:38] through here to minister for us on two
[45:43] occasions sent me something on
[45:47] WhatsApp and it blessed
[45:51] me and while I was thinking of what to
[45:54] say on a Wednesday night like
[45:58] this it just touched my heart to talk
[46:02] about
[46:03] it and I'm trusting that God would come
[46:06] Behind these
[46:08] words and then bless your hearts tonight
[46:11] praise the
[46:12] Lord I sent something there sister net
[46:15] if you can please put it up for me
[46:32] praise the
[46:34] Lord so this was the title of what he
[46:37] sent to me the mathematics of
[46:41] life life is full of
[46:44] mathematics I find it so very
[46:47] interesting and meaningful message to
[46:50] share now it is true I never thought of
[46:54] it but life is full of
[46:59] M spiritually physically economically
[47:03] which way you put it if there is
[47:06] something I am doing
[47:09] today and it is not helping
[47:14] me and I'm taking it out of my
[47:18] life a subtraction A Min
[47:22] us if I sit down and I look at things
[47:27] how can I make this
[47:30] better and I take a step of Faith or I
[47:34] take a step to do something economically
[47:35] to help my
[47:37] situation it's plus an addition
[47:40] sign if I'm able to achieve my
[47:44] dream how do I multiply it that is why
[47:48] the rich men don't
[47:50] sleep those of us that think we are poor
[47:53] we have better sleep they don't sleep
[47:56] they have all the wealth of the world
[47:58] yet they don't sleep they want to
[48:00] multiply
[48:02] it that's multiplication and when you
[48:05] have gotten
[48:07] it if you have to share with others
[48:10] there is a
[48:12] division and that is where a lot of us
[48:14] don't do
[48:16] well we hate to
[48:18] share we want to keep it off for
[48:21] ourselves praise the Lord so whichever
[48:24] way you put it
[48:26] life is full of
[48:29] MTH but that was not the part that
[48:31] actually caught
[48:34] me sister net can we get the second pH
[48:36] of it

[48:55] them from one to 26 that is a 1 b 2 up
[49:01] to Z
[49:04] 26 if you can get the next one
[49:10] please up to Z and probably the next
[49:18] one
[49:20] good so a lot of us a lot of the times
[49:24] would ask ourselves what what can I
[49:28] do to make life better for myself pardon
[49:32] me I'm still uh struggling with

[50:07] impairment but everybody in their right
[50:10] mind want to
[50:12] succeed you don't just want to come and
[50:15] walk this Earth God just like that you
[50:18] want to leave something behind praise
[50:21] the Lord and then he P hard work if I
[50:26] should work very hard I am going to be
[50:28] very successful and then he puts all the
[50:32] numbers together from H to K he puts all
[50:37] together and then it comes to
[50:39] 98% it looks like it's very good enough
[50:42] isn't it praise the Lord but it doesn't
[50:45] get us to 100 the next

[51:00] good thing and that is why we send our
[51:01] children to school we encourage them

[52:14] Atlantic Ocean to come here and then
[52:17] work for money praise the Lord if I
[52:21] should get all the money in the world I
[52:22] should be successful then you ask
[52:24] yourself why is it that people people
[52:26] are so rich till they don't they can't
[52:29] even count your money and some of them
[52:32] will drug themselves to death some of
[52:35] them would put a bullet in their heads

[53:30] you realize that it's just 97% you don't
[53:35] ever get there praise the Lord

[53:45] where I want us to spend some
[53:48] time

[54:37] 100% bear that in
[54:39] mind attitude is a great
[54:42] thing it is
[54:44] 100% now attitude can be good and it can
[54:48] be bad it can be positive it can be
[54:52] negative

[55:07] the right mental attitude it is 100%
[55:11] right and when you have the wrong mental
[55:14] attitude it is 100%
[55:17] wrong if it is good it is 100% good if
[55:21] it is bad it is 100% bad
[55:29] praise the
[55:31] Lord your
[55:34] attitude your attitude determines your
[55:39] altitude your attitude determines how
[55:43] far you go in
[55:45] life it is not your education it is not
[55:48] your
[55:49] money it is not your
[55:54] influence your attitude
[55:57] determines how far you are going to go
[55:59] in
[56:01] life and as we go through I pray God
[56:05] would Minister to you the way he did to
[56:08] me praise the Lord I was listening to um
[56:12] one a celebrity one time on a podcast uh
[56:15] the Dy of a CE and he said something he
[56:19] said his mother told him when he was
[56:20] growing that manness maketh a
[56:24] man and I learned a lot from that
[56:28] manness maketh a
[56:33] man it is not how good you
[56:37] look it is
[56:40] not how tall you
[56:42] are it is
[56:44] not how rich you are it is your
[56:48] maners that is very important and that
[56:52] brings us back to what your attitude so
[56:56] when we are talking about attitude I
[56:58] also want you to be thinking about
[57:00] character they are just the same a good
[57:04] character a good attitude um a good
[57:07] behavior a good attitude they are just
[57:09] one and the same so I maybe
[57:11] interchanging these words but remember
[57:14] we are talking about
[57:20] attitude praise the Lord
[57:31] you may
[57:33] wonder if I have good attitude how does
[57:36] it
[57:37] help if I'm well behaved how does it
[57:40] help if I have good MERS how does it
[57:43] help
[57:48] me it helps a
[57:52] gr sometimes not in ways you want
[57:58] but it helps a great
[58:01] deal there was a very rich man who died
[58:05] and left five
[58:06] children and for some reason he gave
[58:10] half of the wealth to the
[58:13] oldest and the rest of the four he
[58:15] didn't even divide the rest equally to
[58:18] the four he gave it to three and left
[58:20] one for whatever
[58:22] reason this man
[58:24] died and they had to share the
[58:28] world this case ended up in
[58:31] court because there was another head who
[58:34] was not even included in the world and
[58:36] they said no they have to do something
[58:39] that was dividing the family the oldest
[58:41] one stepped in and said all Daddy has
[58:44] been telling us is that we should always
[58:48] stay
[58:49] United but I can see that this family is
[58:53] falling apart after this court case
[58:56] it doesn't look like we are going to see
[58:59] eye to eye again and right in court he
[59:02] said you know
[59:04] what I
[59:07] withdraw I am not going to take the half
[59:10] that he has given me but I want the rest
[59:12] of the family to share this together so
[59:15] there will be peace in the
[59:16] family and that was what they ended up
[59:19] doing even though he was entitled to
[59:22] have and there was one person that was
[59:24] going to lose his inheritance T he
[59:27] stepped
[59:28] back and they had to share their wealth
[59:32] equally to the rest of the four people
[59:34] and guess what happened they came one by
[59:37] one to him oh bro we are very sorry for
[59:41] what happened that we had to end up in
[59:43] court over all these things we are sorry
[59:46] but you know what from what I have I'm
[59:48] sharing it with you gave him up another
[59:52] person comes oh oh bro we are sorry for
[59:55] I mean you took that time you have saved
[59:57] this family you have brought us back
[59:58] together we are proud of you you know
[1:00:00] what I am giving you half of
[1:00:03] mine he ended up having the same half
[1:00:07] his daddy gave him before he
[1:00:09] died and still kept the family
[1:00:13] unit there is a lot we
[1:00:16] gain by staying
[1:00:19] humble praise the Lord the Bible says
[1:00:22] Pride goes before a fall there is
[1:00:25] nothing consoling in
[1:00:31] Pride have it at the back of your
[1:00:34] mind we are talking about the
[1:00:39] Bedrock of
[1:00:41] Victory the Bible says that without
[1:00:44] faith no man can please God faith is
[1:00:47] very crucial in this journey but you
[1:00:50] would
[1:00:52] realize that even the faith you have is
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:56] determined is
[1:01:00] determined by how
[1:01:03] much by by your
[1:01:06] attitude by your
[1:01:09] attitude without that premise your faith
[1:01:13] in God HS in the
[1:01:19] balance and you would think that it is
[1:01:23] only in our Christian work no
[1:01:29] even in
[1:01:30] prison in
[1:01:33] prison if you have good
[1:01:36] attitude you are treated not as a
[1:01:39] prisoner but as a prison
[1:01:41] officer I have seen that the prisoners
[1:01:45] walk through the
[1:01:47] doors and we give them we just Elevate
[1:01:50] them give them another status we make
[1:01:54] them overseers
[1:01:56] over their own colleagues why because
[1:01:58] they have demonstrated good
[1:02:01] behavior and we can talk about
[1:02:06] Joseph that in prison he was not treated
[1:02:09] as
[1:02:15] such and that also can even give you a
[1:02:19] pardon because every year I used to
[1:02:22] think it was only in Ghana but all over
[1:02:24] the world the president gives
[1:02:27] pardon and it is the prison officers
[1:02:30] that will give a list of people that are
[1:02:33] well
[1:02:34] behaved people that have demonstrated
[1:02:36] good
[1:02:37] behavior and then they are given
[1:02:40] clemency either they reduce their
[1:02:42] sentence or they just get them out of
[1:02:46] prison for good
[1:02:48] behavior because they have demonstrated
[1:02:50] what good
[1:02:53] attitude and the police have an
[1:02:55] Unwritten love that you don't
[1:02:58] give good attitude
[1:03:01] excitation when the police pulls you
[1:03:03] over and you are not arrogant you are
[1:03:06] not arguing you are just so friendly and
[1:03:09] so respectful a lot of the times you get
[1:03:13] away it has not worked always I remember
[1:03:17] the last two didn't work for me
[1:03:29] praise the Lord but the lady did
[1:03:32] something
[1:03:35] good in fact I think I needed
[1:03:39] it it was one morning I was going to
[1:03:41] pick my wife up it was Sunday morning so
[1:03:45] she would go and get some rest and we
[1:03:46] come to church and it was so foggy you
[1:03:50] couldn't see ahead of you you wouldn't
[1:03:53] see any car all you see is that break
[1:03:55] the light
[1:03:58] so I was not seeing I was just using the
[1:04:01] road markings that was the only way I
[1:04:03] could tell I was in my
[1:04:06] lane and then I just passed and I saw
[1:04:10] the light behind me and I she was so
[1:04:12] angry you don't have to drive that way
[1:04:15] you you I mean she was so mad and I was
[1:04:18] so calm I say yeah you're right you're
[1:04:20] right it's true I'm sorry I'm going to
[1:04:22] pick my wife today Sunday we are going
[1:04:24] to church and blah blah blah blah BL
[1:04:26] and then she went I thought she was just
[1:04:28] coming to say don't do that again she
[1:04:30] brought me a citation but the good part
[1:04:32] is she reduced the
[1:04:36] mileage and she said I didn't give you I
[1:04:40] didn't put the speed limit on it I
[1:04:42] reduced
[1:04:43] it so I said thank you I got to work and
[1:04:46] I was even complaining I said she gave
[1:04:48] me the citation anyway and said she I
[1:04:50] reduced it by seven seven seven uh M I
[1:04:52] mean uh 7 m sare hour I said what does
[1:04:55] that mean and somebody said she has
[1:04:57] saved you almost $200 I said oh but that
[1:05:00] was
[1:05:05] good and the next time we went to a we
[1:05:07] coming another person picked me up so I
[1:05:10] was so nice but they still give me the
[1:05:12] citation sometimes it is good and I
[1:05:14] think I needed that praise the Lord so
[1:05:19] it doesn't always work with the police
[1:05:21] but it is a good thing to do praise the
[1:05:24] Lord even in business the people have
[1:05:26] realized that good attitude
[1:05:29] sells it is not how best your commodity
[1:05:33] is or your service is no you can have
[1:05:37] the best restaurant if you don't have
[1:05:39] good customer service nobody's coming
[1:05:41] there you can offer the best Services if
[1:05:45] you don't have maners nobody is calling
[1:05:48] you for any any
[1:05:50] service because people come they are
[1:05:54] looking at you are whether you are
[1:05:58] listening how you say whether you I
[1:06:02] mean they take consideration of all
[1:06:05] those things so even in the business
[1:06:08] World they know that to have a good
[1:06:12] attitude matters a
[1:06:14] lot praise
[1:06:17] God
[1:06:18] now look at
[1:06:23] joob can we take our Bible go job
[1:06:30] 2 job
[1:06:37] 2 we are reading from 6 to
[1:06:45] 10 and the Lord said unto Satan behold
[1:06:49] he is in thine hand but save his
[1:06:54] life so went Satan
[1:06:57] forth from the presence of the Lord and
[1:07:00] smoked job with saw boils from the so of
[1:07:05] his feet onto his
[1:07:07] crown and he took him a pot shed to
[1:07:11] scrape himself without and he sat down
[1:07:15] among the
[1:07:17] ashes then said his wife unto
[1:07:20] him do thou still retain thine integrity
[1:07:26] Curse God and die verse 10 but he said
[1:07:30] unto her thou speakest as one of the
[1:07:34] foolish women
[1:07:36] speak speaketh what shall we receive
[1:07:41] good at the hand of God and shall we not
[1:07:45] receive
[1:07:46] evil in all this did not job sin with
[1:07:52] his lips praise the Lord
[1:07:56] we are talking about attitude
[1:08:00] here that a man that was
[1:08:04] actually put to the
[1:08:07] test in fact of all
[1:08:12] humans that have
[1:08:15] lived I have not seen anyone that has
[1:08:18] gone through what job has gone
[1:08:22] through praise the Lord and with all
[1:08:25] that job went through he still stood his
[1:08:30] grounds his faith in God was put to the
[1:08:37] test and yet in all that he went
[1:08:41] through in all that he went
[1:08:44] through he wouldn't ciss
[1:08:48] God even when his wife impressed upon
[1:08:51] him to C God and die he wouldn't do it
[1:08:54] and he said should we only receive good
[1:08:57] from God and not
[1:09:04] evil just look at the
[1:09:08] attitude look at the
[1:09:11] attitude
[1:09:12] sometimes you will think a man is well
[1:09:16] managed or a man has good character wait
[1:09:19] until they are put to the
[1:09:21] test then what is in the inside is going
[1:09:25] to come out you wouldn't even know when
[1:09:27] it comes
[1:09:29] out when you are put to the test you
[1:09:31] wouldn't know when it comes out it's
[1:09:33] just going to play out because it is in
[1:09:40] you maybe just walking down the
[1:09:43] road and somebody gives me a
[1:09:46] slap it will take the grace of God for
[1:09:50] me to get up and just keep moving if the
[1:09:54] grace of God doesn't come down
[1:09:57] we may have to square it
[1:09:59] out and then just imagine maybe you are
[1:10:02] giving a slap and then you get
[1:10:05] up and then you look at the man and you
[1:10:08] look at his sture his buil and you
[1:10:11] assess the situation say no I can't
[1:10:13] fight this one and then you
[1:10:17] go that is
[1:10:20] not
[1:10:21] humility there is no humility in that
[1:10:26] it is not a good
[1:10:27] attitude it's not because you are
[1:10:29] well-mannered it's not because you have
[1:10:31] a good character no it's because you
[1:10:35] have assessed the situation and you have
[1:10:37] seen that no you can't do anything about
[1:10:41] it and people may stand and say oh this
[1:10:44] man is well behaved this man is man man
[1:10:47] is well maned no you are not well
[1:10:51] maned is because the situation is beyond
[1:10:55] you
[1:10:56] if you want to see the true character of
[1:10:58] a man wait until they are reach if they
[1:11:03] were
[1:11:04] poor if you want to see the true
[1:11:06] character of a man wait until they have
[1:11:12] power wait until they have
[1:11:15] power and then that is where you are
[1:11:18] going to see true
[1:11:21] humility and as we go on you see
[1:11:25] that when things happen and you know you
[1:11:28] have the power to change the situation
[1:11:31] and
[1:11:32] yet you choose not to that is where I
[1:11:36] want to
[1:11:38] be praise the Lord that is where I want
[1:11:41] to be it is not easy it is not a common
[1:11:44] place to be but that is why I pray to be
[1:11:47] by the grace of God praise the
[1:11:50] Lord and God requires what good maners
[1:11:54] God requires good character good
[1:11:56] attitude God requires it so much so that
[1:12:00] the Bible says that Christ himself
[1:12:03] learned obedience by the things he
[1:12:07] suffered he learned obedience that is
[1:12:10] character praise the Lord job said naked
[1:12:14] I came and naked I will
[1:12:16] go yes so long as the things of this
[1:12:19] world are concerned we are not going to
[1:12:22] take anything when we live this life we
[1:12:25] are going to leave everything back
[1:12:28] everything we ever toil for everything
[1:12:30] we ever labored for everything we ever
[1:12:33] struggled for we are going to leave it
[1:12:35] behind we are never going to carry it
[1:12:37] with
[1:12:38] us
[1:12:42] nothing Look at
[1:12:45] California this new year a lot of things
[1:12:48] happened there were a lot of Storms and
[1:12:51] we felt a part of it on this side of the
[1:12:54] world look at California that went up in
[1:12:57] Flames for over 10 days that California
[1:13:00] was
[1:13:01] burning and
[1:13:03] nothing they couldn't do nothing to
[1:13:05] bring the fire
[1:13:07] down people
[1:13:09] lost their entire world life
[1:13:14] saving they lost their
[1:13:17] home they
[1:13:19] lost everything they ever labored for
[1:13:22] went up in flames
[1:13:25] they have nothing to point a finger
[1:13:30] to so
[1:13:32] yes naked we came naked will go butam
[1:13:37] said we are not going to go back
[1:13:39] naked we are going to go back with what
[1:13:43] character character attitude good
[1:13:47] attitude that is how important it
[1:13:51] is that a man comes into this life
[1:13:56] and they labor all through this
[1:13:59] life 30 40 50 60 100
[1:14:03] years and they are not going to carry
[1:14:06] not even a shoe
[1:14:08] latchet with them the day they leave
[1:14:11] this earth but they are going to carry
[1:14:14] what character it tells you how
[1:14:19] important character
[1:14:21] is we can never overemphasize that
[1:14:25] the character is so so so important if
[1:14:29] it is the only thing we are going to
[1:14:32] carry all our life it tells us how
[1:14:36] important it is and should never be
[1:14:41] overlooked it should never be
[1:14:47] overlooked and it is not the good things
[1:14:51] of this life that gives us character
[1:14:56] you realize true
[1:15:00] character comes through
[1:15:03] toils
[1:15:04] disappointments failures
[1:15:07] struggles it doesn't come on a silver
[1:15:11] platter it is not a
[1:15:14] gift it is a
[1:15:16] virtue you have to fight for
[1:15:22] it if character
[1:15:25] good
[1:15:26] behavior attitude if it is the only
[1:15:29] thing we are going to carry when we take
[1:15:33] our last
[1:15:35] breath then it tells us how important it
[1:15:41] is we can never overemphasize
[1:15:46] that that Christ himself God in human
[1:15:51] flesh he had to learn what
[1:15:55] obedience by the things he
[1:15:59] suffered by the things he suffered you
[1:16:02] want to you want to see true
[1:16:05] character there was never anybody so
[1:16:08] humble like the Lord
[1:16:11] Jesus
[1:16:12] never there was never
[1:16:16] anyone all power in heaven and on Earth
[1:16:20] was given
[1:16:21] him he had the power and the authority
[1:16:24] to call leges of angels to come and
[1:16:27] fight on his
[1:16:29] behalf and such a man was
[1:16:32] set and they will say all manner of
[1:16:34] things about him and all he will just do
[1:16:38] is just
[1:16:40] look with all the power and the
[1:16:42] authority he
[1:16:48] had that they did all that they did
[1:16:50] against him called him names whipped him
[1:16:56] hang him on the cross n him to the
[1:17:00] cross and yet he wouldn't
[1:17:04] call the angels to
[1:17:07] war that is true
[1:17:11] humility that is true
[1:17:16] character and it is an example for you
[1:17:20] and
[1:17:21] me a lot of the times we don't even go
[1:17:25] through anything and all we do is
[1:17:32] complain for everything that comes our
[1:17:36] way we may not like it you don't have to
[1:17:39] like it but when God allows situations
[1:17:43] to come your way it's for a
[1:17:46] good you may not see it at that present
[1:17:49] time but there is something good behind
[1:17:53] it how else else do you shine the light
[1:17:56] in you if there is no Darkness around
[1:18:01] you there is light in you to
[1:18:04] shine the Bible says let your light so
[1:18:07] shine before men that they may see your
[1:18:09] good works and give the glory to your
[1:18:11] father which is in
[1:18:14] heaven if there is no Darkness for you
[1:18:18] to shine that
[1:18:20] lights how do you
[1:18:22] shine how do you glorify God
[1:18:25] when God allows situations is just to
[1:18:28] bring that which is inside of you
[1:18:32] out sometimes you don't even know what
[1:18:35] you are capable of by the grace of God
[1:18:38] but it
[1:18:39] happens that in that spare in in that
[1:18:43] time in the spare of the moment you just
[1:18:47] see Christ play
[1:18:50] out that when you sit to think about
[1:18:53] it I mean
[1:18:56] sometimes you even have
[1:18:57] to because you know
[1:19:00] yourself and you know when God has taken
[1:19:03] over
[1:19:05] the you know it is not you you know it
[1:19:08] is the grace of God praise the lord we
[1:19:12] are getting
[1:19:19] somewh so we are talking about character
[1:19:22] talking about attitude
[1:19:24] it is not your
[1:19:28] character the bride you
[1:19:30] choose reflects your
[1:19:34] character and the bride Christ has
[1:19:36] chosen must reflect his
[1:19:40] character we are talking about the life
[1:19:44] of God in a man we are talking about the
[1:19:48] character of Christ in a
[1:19:52] man we all have our
[1:19:57] nature if you are not happy with your
[1:20:00] attitude you don't have to keep it you
[1:20:03] don't have to manage it you can trade
[1:20:06] it you can trade it tonight
[1:20:25] so everything is
[1:20:28] edly but by now we have
[1:20:31] realized that attitude actually
[1:20:34] transcends Beyond
[1:20:36] time that when all of life comes to an
[1:20:40] end and a man has to
[1:20:43] live he is going to
[1:20:46] carry character with him praise the Lord
[1:20:54] brother Bram said that the right mental
[1:20:58] attitude to every Divine promise of
[1:21:02] God would bring it to
[1:21:06] pass so your attitude is
[1:21:09] enough to bring you your healing if you
[1:21:13] can believe your attitude can change a
[1:21:17] whole
[1:21:18] picture look at Virgin
[1:21:22] Mary when he was overshadowed by the the
[1:21:24] Holy Spirit what her attitude
[1:21:29] was praise the Lord and we can also talk
[1:21:33] about a um San uh woman in Matthew
[1:21:39] 15:27 whose daughter was vexed with an
[1:21:42] evil
[1:21:45] spirit when he was behind the Lord Jesus
[1:21:48] and he she was sh
[1:21:50] shouting thou son of David have mercy
[1:21:54] upon me me thou son of David have mercy
[1:21:57] upon me just following them and just
[1:21:59] crying
[1:22:00] out my daughter is vest with an evil
[1:22:04] spirit she cried and cried and followed
[1:22:07] them till the disciples couldn't bear it
[1:22:10] anymore it was enough for the woman to
[1:22:13] have told
[1:22:15] herself I have shouted
[1:22:18] enough he is not even minding me let me
[1:22:21] just forget it she can die if she wants
[1:22:25] to die but she didn't stop she kept
[1:22:29] following and she was she shouting and
[1:22:32] shouting and shouting thou son of David
[1:22:34] have mercy upon me till the disciples
[1:22:37] told the Lord Jesus why don't you send
[1:22:39] this woman
[1:22:42] away why don't you send her away she is
[1:22:45] just tormenting
[1:22:48] us and when she turned to the
[1:22:51] woman she said I cannot give
[1:22:56] the children meet to
[1:22:58] dogs still the woman was not
[1:23:01] offended she said
[1:23:03] yes as a fact you can't do
[1:23:07] that but you cannot also deny the dogs
[1:23:10] from eating of the
[1:23:12] crabs she said what what a faith what
[1:23:16] was it that was her attitude
[1:23:20] towards
[1:23:22] God her attitude
[1:23:25] towards God was what brought her the
[1:23:29] result her daughter got healed why
[1:23:32] because of her
[1:23:35] attitude attitude
[1:23:37] matters is so
[1:23:41] important and let us not forget that in
[1:23:45] our service to
[1:23:47] God
[1:23:49] attitude is everything praise the
[1:23:53] lord we got can talk about the
[1:23:57] Centurion whose servant was so sick and
[1:24:01] when he heard that the Lord Jesus had
[1:24:03] entered capern with his with with his
[1:24:05] disciples he came and as that Jesus goes
[1:24:10] with
[1:24:11] him to go and heal his
[1:24:13] servant he actually asked for the
[1:24:16] healing of his servant and the Lord
[1:24:18] Jesus said yes I will
[1:24:21] come and look at another attitude here
[1:24:25] that you don't have to
[1:24:26] come I have a man set in
[1:24:29] Authority I tell this go and they go I
[1:24:33] tell this come and they
[1:24:35] come just speak the word and my servant
[1:24:39] will be healed praise the Lord he said I
[1:24:43] have not seen such a such great a faith
[1:24:46] in Israel I have not seen it what an
[1:24:50] attitude towards the word of God if you
[1:24:53] should have have such an attitude
[1:24:56] towards every single promise of God you
[1:24:59] are going to see it come to pass in your
[1:25:05] life the right mental
[1:25:08] attitude towards every Divine promise of
[1:25:12] God would bring it to
[1:25:14] pass a lot of the times we don't have
[1:25:17] that right mental
[1:25:20] attitude sometimes we think we do a lot
[1:25:24] of times we
[1:25:27] don't and if you have the right mental
[1:25:31] attitude and you talk to God and you are
[1:25:35] not seeing the result just stay there
[1:25:38] it's only for a
[1:25:41] while do not let your faith
[1:25:45] waver it will surely come to
[1:25:48] pass praise the
[1:25:51] Lord the right mental attitude
[1:25:54] towards every promise of God would
[1:25:57] surely bring it to pass can we take to
[1:25:59] Luke 10 to Luke
[1:26:02] 18 that will be our last reading for
[1:26:05] tonight Luke
[1:26:08] 18 Luke
[1:26:18] 189 Luke
[1:26:22] 189 and his SP this Parable unto certain
[1:26:27] which trusted in
[1:26:29] themselves that they are righteous and
[1:26:33] despised
[1:26:37] others
[1:26:41] now some of the times we find ourselves
[1:26:47] here that we say to
[1:26:50] ourselves oh we are the bride of Christ
[1:26:55] we have believed in the message of our
[1:26:58] day we have believed in M 4 5
[1:27:02] and6 we are the redeemed of the
[1:27:08] Lord and we are ready for a
[1:27:11] Rapture and then we look at all other
[1:27:15] people as
[1:27:19] trash we look down on everything
[1:27:27] because they are not your brothers
[1:27:29] because they are not your sisters
[1:27:31] because they don't fellowship with you
[1:27:33] because they don't believe in what you
[1:27:34] believe or stand for what you stand and
[1:27:37] because of that they are going to
[1:27:40] hell we show no
[1:27:44] mercy we show no
[1:27:48] mercy the Bible says
[1:27:51] that let he that thinketh he standed
[1:27:54] he that thinks he standed let him take
[1:27:56] heed lest he
[1:28:01] falls show
[1:28:03] Grace show
[1:28:05] Mercy it is the grace of God that has
[1:28:08] brought us this far it is not our
[1:28:11] strength there are children of God out
[1:28:13] there you can't just look at somebody on
[1:28:16] the for on the forehead and tell who
[1:28:19] they are
[1:28:24] sometimes we look at people by the way
[1:28:26] they they dress and the places they go
[1:28:29] and we think that
[1:28:31] no the Judgment of God should just come
[1:28:33] and consume them if God did that to us a
[1:28:37] lot of us will not be here in this
[1:28:40] room because God were those
[1:28:43] days that we go to the nightclubs in the
[1:28:46] drinking power drink from night from
[1:28:49] morning till
[1:28:51] night get up in the morning in instead
[1:28:54] of brushing our teeth we use drink to
[1:28:57] brush our
[1:28:58] teeth if God had not had mercy upon us
[1:29:01] we would not be here it is the grace of
[1:29:04] God it is not our
[1:29:08] strength and he spake this Parable unto
[1:29:12] certain which trusted in themselves that
[1:29:15] they were righteous and despised others
[1:29:18] praise the Lord two men went up into the
[1:29:21] temple to pray the one a Pharisee and
[1:29:24] the other a Publican the Pharisees stood
[1:29:27] and prayed thus with himself God I thank
[1:29:32] thee that I am not as the other men are
[1:29:37] extortionist unjust adulterers and even
[1:29:41] as this
[1:29:42] Publican I fast twice in the week I give
[1:29:47] TI of all I all that I possess and the
[1:29:52] Publican standing a far of would not
[1:29:56] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[1:30:01] but smut upon his breast saying God be
[1:30:06] merciful to me a
[1:30:08] sinner tell I tell you this man went
[1:30:13] down to his house Justified rather than
[1:30:16] the
[1:30:17] order for everyone that exalted himself
[1:30:20] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[1:30:23] himself
[1:30:24] shall be exalted praise the
[1:30:29] Lord two men stood side by
[1:30:34] side
[1:30:35] one just taught himself to be so
[1:30:39] righteous and he looked down upon the
[1:30:42] other so so
[1:30:44] much that he's in his prayer he was
[1:30:48] saying I am not an
[1:30:51] extortioner I don't steal
[1:30:54] I don't corent I don't commit adultery I
[1:30:58] don't cheat I don't drink I don't smoke
[1:31:02] like this Publican here I am a righteous
[1:31:05] man I pay TI the biggest
[1:31:10] TI and you should hear my prayer but
[1:31:13] here on the other side was a Publican
[1:31:17] who would not even speak
[1:31:20] out but in
[1:31:22] humility was pray
[1:31:24] and crying out to God Lord have mercy
[1:31:28] have mercy forgive me a sinner have
[1:31:32] mercy forgive me my shortcomings have
[1:31:35] mercy forgive me for letting you down
[1:31:39] have mercy that when you trusted in me
[1:31:42] to lift the bloodstain B of Christ for
[1:31:45] the world to see I let you down I sanded
[1:31:48] that opportunity forgive me oh just
[1:31:51] praying pleading for the mercies of God
[1:31:56] the Lord Jesus said this publicly went
[1:31:59] home more Justified than
[1:32:04] the what again attitude in
[1:32:08] this attitude in
[1:32:12] this so attitude matters a
[1:32:17] lot in our life's
[1:32:21] journey at work
[1:32:24] you can be the best employee if you
[1:32:27] don't have the right
[1:32:29] attitude they will walk you through the
[1:32:34] doors I have seen people say oh I am the
[1:32:38] best employee without me this company
[1:32:42] would not
[1:32:43] function they walked them through the
[1:32:45] door and the company has been
[1:32:50] bar atude
[1:32:55] spiritually if you are going to go
[1:32:58] anywhere with
[1:33:00] Christ your attitude towards the word of
[1:33:03] God is
[1:33:05] crucial your attitude towards the word
[1:33:09] of God is
[1:33:13] crucial what is your attitude when the
[1:33:16] word of God comes to you and then it is
[1:33:19] not what you wanted to hear that the
[1:33:22] word of God comes to you and you feel
[1:33:25] like a sword has been dashed through
[1:33:27] your
[1:33:28] soul you feel like you are under the gun
[1:33:32] you feel like the sermon is so much
[1:33:35] against
[1:33:35] you you feel like oh this is I'm the one
[1:33:38] they are talking about what is your
[1:33:40] attitude when the word of God is
[1:33:45] preached what is your
[1:33:48] attitude your attitude towards the word
[1:33:50] of God can bring God closer and it can
[1:33:54] send you far away from so remember that
[1:33:58] our attitude towards the K of God are
[1:34:02] very important our attitude towards the
[1:34:06] word of God is crucial very
[1:34:10] important if we are going to go anywhere
[1:34:12] at all with Christ Our attitude towards
[1:34:15] his word is very very very important and
[1:34:19] remember that good
[1:34:22] attitude character for that matter it's
[1:34:26] one thing that all of us are going to
[1:34:29] carry with
[1:34:30] us when life is no
[1:34:33] more when we have stepped out of this
[1:34:37] body and are
[1:34:41] gone our attitude goes with us your
[1:34:45] character goes with you character is
[1:34:49] almost like your
[1:34:52] DNA and it takes
[1:34:56] circumstances to bring
[1:34:58] out that attitude it takes circumstances
[1:35:02] to bring out the true you your character
[1:35:08] that is hidden and nobody sees it it
[1:35:10] takes circumstances to bring it out if
[1:35:14] circumstances around your life do not
[1:35:17] bring it out time will bring it
[1:35:21] out you can't hide it
[1:35:25] you can't hide it whatever it
[1:35:30] is you can look at your life and you see
[1:35:34] where you're not doing
[1:35:36] well it's a good thing when you can look
[1:35:40] in the mirror of the word of God and see
[1:35:42] where you are falling short praise the
[1:35:46] Lord then it gives you something to pray
[1:35:50] about it gives you something to pray
[1:35:52] about
[1:35:57] when I looked at
[1:35:58] that that
[1:36:00] attitude actually as up to 100 when
[1:36:04] nothing else does it blessed my
[1:36:09] heart and I just thought I should share
[1:36:12] something like this
[1:36:14] tonight it may not have maybe it was not
[1:36:16] what you wanted to hear but probably
[1:36:19] there is somebody here who needed that
[1:36:21] praise the Lord so remember that in our
[1:36:25] walk with
[1:36:26] God
[1:36:28] God
[1:36:30] actually demands
[1:36:33] it
[1:36:35] attitude towards your attitude towards
[1:36:38] the word of God is very important to it
[1:36:43] may not mean anything to you but it
[1:36:46] means a lot to you and we are here to
[1:36:50] serve God and whatever means a lot to
[1:36:53] him
[1:36:54] should be something that we should be
[1:36:56] Desiring to do praise the Lord life is
[1:36:59] not about us it's about
[1:37:02] him and whatever matters to him should
[1:37:05] matter most to Us Praise the Lord so
[1:37:09] remember as we leave here tonight that
[1:37:12] your attitude towards the word matters a
[1:37:15] lot to
[1:37:17] God and your
[1:37:19] attitude would open every single door in
[1:37:23] this life
[1:37:24] whether it is spiritual whether it is
[1:37:27] social whether it is
[1:37:29] economic whatever it is your attitude
[1:37:33] good attitude for that matter would open
[1:37:36] that door and then lift you up and bring
[1:37:39] you where you never expected to
[1:37:43] be praise the
[1:37:45] Lord one

[1:42:29] tonight brother brother Dan speaking
[1:42:32] tonight on um on
[1:42:35] attitude
[1:42:36] character but Rand said there in U
[1:42:40] Ephesian paralite Joshua how our
[1:42:43] misbehavior of unconfessed sin how he
[1:42:46] can cause the church to fail all goes
[1:42:49] back to our
[1:42:51] attitude and Especial the
[1:42:54] the last scripture he read
[1:42:57] there you see saints of God we have to
[1:43:00] realize that the message of the hour is
[1:43:03] a high
[1:43:04] calling God has called us to a high
[1:43:08] calling in the way we talk the way we
[1:43:12] dress and many times uh we stay on the
[1:43:17] atmosphere of this
[1:43:21] word it affect us
[1:43:25] change the way we do
[1:43:30] things but we have to come to that
[1:43:32] reality you know when brother B talks
[1:43:34] about the right mental
[1:43:37] attitude it's not the way you compose
[1:43:40] your mind but the way you receive the
[1:43:42] word the way you think about God's word
[1:43:46] many times we we we think about how the
[1:43:50] grace of God is helping us in our life
[1:43:53] and sometime it's so easy for us to
[1:43:55] attribute it to our
[1:43:57] effort to our the effort we put in In
[1:44:01] Living right the effort we put in in
[1:44:04] holding the word our you know you know
[1:44:07] our faithfulness and but we have to
[1:44:10] realize that it's the grace of
[1:44:14] God we always have to bring it back to
[1:44:17] the foot of the
[1:44:19] cross that it is by God's grace
[1:44:23] it's by God's grace that we are standing
[1:44:26] in in his house tonight it's by God
[1:44:29] grace that is giving us uh uh the
[1:44:32] strength and uh the wisdom and
[1:44:35] everything that we doing we we have to
[1:44:36] bring it back to
[1:44:40] him it is it is he that is working in us
[1:44:47] mightily we must now one day rely on our
[1:44:50] own effort
[1:44:53] not our own best
[1:44:55] attitude because I'm telling you people
[1:44:58] there are people that are that that that
[1:45:00] grow up with respect and and morals and
[1:45:03] and and but when it comes to the
[1:45:05] attitude towards the
[1:45:07] word Jesus told John the Baptist
[1:45:10] disciples and said go tell John blessed
[1:45:12] is he that is not offended in me
