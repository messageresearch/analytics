[19:19] houses we saw them
[19:21] we placed others on a lot and my wife
[19:23] would say i don't like it
[19:25] then we'll cancel it but it so happened
[19:29] that we saw one very hard one house
[19:32] we went there we liked it we gave the
[19:35] offer
[19:37] and they turned us down and took
[19:40] somebody else's offer

[39:04] he's been down with uh striped trucked
[39:06] and fever
[39:07] we just want to commit him in the hands
[39:09] of the lord
[39:11] little grace
[39:15] brother stephen and kish wu's daughter
[39:18] we want to pray for her and little
[39:20] treasure as well
[39:22] you know the whole treasure
[39:26] story uh my little girl prayer was not
[39:29] well
[39:30] so she had a cold and and a pink
[39:33] eye the school sent her home and you
[39:36] know with everything that is going on
[39:39] when there is any sense of fever the
[39:41] school will want to make sure that a
[39:42] child is tested before the comeback so
[39:45] prayer had to be tested and and
[39:49] while she was home she and treasure goes
[39:51] to the same school
[39:53] so treasure said well you know she told
[39:56] her teacher
[39:57] that her sister was safe which is area
[40:00] and so they sent her home too to go
[40:03] home and be tested so
[40:07] when prayer tests came she was negative
[40:11] and then when brother lawrence took
[40:15] his daughter to be tested he got tested
[40:17] too
[40:18] because of his work and other things but
[40:21] he was negative
[40:22] and then it turned out that treasure
[40:25] test came out positive
[40:27] but uh the the the nurse says she's
[40:30] showing no fever she surely knows no
[40:32] symptom
[40:33] so uh
[40:37] you know that's we will have to deal
[40:39] with all of these things
[40:41] especially now that we will be getting
[40:43] into the cold weather
[40:45] and as we have said over and over if you
[40:47] are not feeling well
[40:49] just stay home it is not no sign
[40:53] of less faith okay the sign of good
[40:57] faith
[40:57] is to be concerned for others that's the
[41:00] sign of good faith
[41:01] praise the lord that's what the gospel
[41:04] teach
[41:04] us to do and so
[41:08] [Music]
[41:09] but i mean with everything that is going
[41:12] on we will have to go
[41:13] through there people that are working in
[41:16] the health area some of them have to be
[41:18] tested
[41:19] after every two weeks in in all of that
[41:22] so we would just trust the lord and
[41:26] ask the parents to take her yesterday
[41:29] for another test
[41:31] so we looking forward to hear what the
[41:33] report will be

[1:01:55] by the prophets have in
[1:01:58] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:02:01] son
[1:02:03] whom he have appointed hearers of all
[1:02:06] things
[1:02:07] all things disappearing again by whom
[1:02:11] also he made the words
[1:02:14] amen who being the brightness
[1:02:19] of his glory the express
[1:02:22] image in collusion we read
[1:02:26] about the image of the invisible girl
[1:02:29] now here paul go another level he says
[1:02:33] that
[1:02:33] image is an express image
[1:02:38] the express image of his person
[1:02:46] and upholding all things
[1:02:49] by the word of his power
[1:02:53] when he had by himself paused our sin
[1:02:57] sat down on the right hand of the
[1:03:01] majestic
[1:03:02] on high let's pray together father
[1:03:05] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:03:07] just pray
[1:03:08] the lord god you will come and bless us
[1:03:11] together now
[1:03:12] in jesus name amen praise the lord this
[1:03:15] morning
[1:03:16] have you seen i want to speak on
[1:03:19] this the express image of the invisible
[1:03:22] god
[1:03:25] the express image of the invisible god
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:33] praise the lord
[1:03:37] you know christianity
[1:03:42] is a beautiful thing when you come
[1:03:45] into the revelation of faith
[1:03:48] praise the lord amen
[1:03:51] uh
[1:03:57] brother eric is working on on a picture
[1:04:00] for me
[1:04:02] and as soon as he's done we will have
[1:04:05] the privilege to share that with you
[1:04:08] uh but you know
[1:04:12] to some people they don't understand
[1:04:15] and even many of us that are caught up
[1:04:18] in the realm
[1:04:19] of christianity we are still learning
[1:04:22] every day
[1:04:24] amen we are still learning every day
[1:04:28] and uh and god stayed revealing himself
[1:04:31] to us
[1:04:33] he stayed he's still making himself
[1:04:36] known
[1:04:36] that's the reason why we never want to
[1:04:39] come to the place
[1:04:40] you know and and and feel like we
[1:04:43] uh uh you know we
[1:04:47] we really understand you know
[1:04:50] uh what god is even doing with our life
[1:04:53] praise the lord amen so uh
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:58] but this morning we will try to
[1:05:02] to take this subject and bring us to the
[1:05:05] place where
[1:05:06] we can be able to understand it you know
[1:05:09] if you are inside it's almost like the
[1:05:13] the tent that we put on the on the door
[1:05:16] there on the glass when you are inside
[1:05:20] then you get an understanding of what is
[1:05:22] happening outside
[1:05:24] but when you are outside it's hard for
[1:05:26] you to know
[1:05:27] what is happening inside amen that's the
[1:05:30] reason why
[1:05:31] it frustrate the eight years and they
[1:05:33] frustrate you know all the godless
[1:05:36] people
[1:05:36] when they talk about god they just think
[1:05:39] that you are talking
[1:05:40] about uh uh i mean just one person is so
[1:05:44] selfish to talk about
[1:05:46] about god but you just think about what
[1:05:48] the scripture says
[1:05:50] he created all things
[1:05:54] and without him nothing exists
[1:05:58] and he created all things for himself
[1:06:03] until we understand it that this whole
[1:06:06] thing about
[1:06:07] faith and about god is all about him
[1:06:10] that's right it's all about him
[1:06:14] praise the lord he holds our life in
[1:06:17] in his hands praise the lord
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:26] he holds our life he holds time and
[1:06:28] eternity in his hands
[1:06:30] so this is the this is the one we want
[1:06:31] to talk about this morning
[1:06:33] you know uh uh uh
[1:06:36] we've been we've been just going around
[1:06:39] uh talking about the go ahead and not
[1:06:41] really trying to make it as subject on
[1:06:44] the godhead for doctrine of purpose
[1:06:46] but we're trying to make it a subject to
[1:06:49] be able
[1:06:50] to bring us into the revelation of who
[1:06:54] this god is
[1:06:58] praise the lord amen
[1:07:02] to bring us into the revelation for us
[1:07:05] to
[1:07:05] understand who this great god is
[1:07:09] and i pray that he show himself unto us
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:16] we can go back and forth with with
[1:07:18] doctrinal views
[1:07:20] but what we try what we try to bring out
[1:07:22] this morning the express image
[1:07:25] of the invisible god we want to talk
[1:07:28] about and i mentioned on the last sunday
[1:07:32] how god in the way that he showed
[1:07:34] himself
[1:07:35] you think about it even before he was
[1:07:37] god
[1:07:38] because god means an object of worship
[1:07:41] so before there was anything to worship
[1:07:43] him
[1:07:44] this great internal spirit existed
[1:07:48] by himself how we talk are we together
[1:07:52] and the bible called him the invisible
[1:07:55] god
[1:07:57] amen the invisible god
[1:08:03] so he's the invisible god
[1:08:06] but this invisible god try to
[1:08:10] make himself visible
[1:08:14] and until god becomes visible to you
[1:08:18] amen you can never worship him
[1:08:22] you can never serve him
[1:08:25] until he becomes visible to you
[1:08:28] amen amen
[1:08:32] praise the lord so this invisible god
[1:08:37] internal spirit praise the lord
[1:08:40] starts to unfold himself
[1:08:45] he started unfolding himself he started
[1:08:48] trying to make himself known coming from
[1:08:50] the invisible
[1:08:52] told the visible
[1:08:55] praise the lord amen coming to the
[1:08:59] invisible coming from the invisible
[1:09:03] to the visible praise the lord
[1:09:07] and when when when when jesus
[1:09:13] was born and came to the full age of his
[1:09:17] ministry
[1:09:18] the bible make us to know the invisible
[1:09:21] god
[1:09:22] fully embody into him
[1:09:25] that's why he could say i and my father
[1:09:27] are one that's why he could say i do
[1:09:29] nothing except the father
[1:09:31] show it to me praise the lord
[1:09:34] amen and and after
[1:09:37] jesus ascended on high
[1:09:41] the invisible god came in the form of
[1:09:43] the holy spirit
[1:09:45] and started dealing with the church back
[1:09:49] from the visible because when he was
[1:09:52] here
[1:09:52] he was visible he's dealing with the
[1:09:55] church now back from the visible
[1:09:58] to the invisible praise the lord
[1:10:01] and that's what we want to look at and
[1:10:03] that is the thing
[1:10:04] sometimes that that that that that
[1:10:07] trouble us
[1:10:08] because unless until we understand these
[1:10:11] things
[1:10:13] you know uh uh that the devil can come
[1:10:15] around and bother us
[1:10:17] because right now you see that is the
[1:10:20] reason why let me say this way when god
[1:10:22] was dealing with the jews
[1:10:24] he gave them all their laws and their
[1:10:26] other
[1:10:27] ordinances it was all visible things
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:30] you got to wash your hands before you
[1:10:32] enter into the tabernacle
[1:10:34] you got to kill a literal animal you got
[1:10:37] to burn
[1:10:37] candles they were all all visible
[1:10:42] why because he was coming from the
[1:10:44] invisible
[1:10:45] to the visible so he have to give them
[1:10:48] visible ordinance
[1:10:50] for them to really know a man has to
[1:10:53] take a lamb
[1:10:54] and drag the lamb to the temple and and
[1:10:57] go there
[1:10:58] lay his hands on the lamb
[1:11:01] and wash the priests killing the lamb
[1:11:04] for him to be able to walk back
[1:11:08] and believe that his sin was forgiving
[1:11:10] but
[1:11:11] you and myself by faith
[1:11:14] we lay our hands on the lamb of god
[1:11:17] jesus christ
[1:11:20] invisible our faith is invisible man
[1:11:28] praise the lord amen
[1:11:33] the bible says he has forgiven us of all
[1:11:36] of our sin
[1:11:37] that's the thing that troubles us
[1:11:39] because we don't see
[1:11:40] it visibly
[1:11:43] we don't see it visibly so it's hard for
[1:11:46] us to believe
[1:11:49] what god is doing in the
[1:11:53] amen amen
[1:11:57] amen praise the lord
[1:12:02] but he came from the invisible to
[1:12:05] the visible and from the vegetable
[1:12:08] he's moving back to the invisible
[1:12:12] amen are we together amen
[1:12:16] let's read another scripture maybe he
[1:12:17] might help you romans chapter one
[1:12:23] romans chapter one
[1:12:41] romans chapter 1 praise the lord
[1:12:45] amen amen
[1:12:48] let's read from verse 18 romans chapter
[1:12:52] 1
[1:12:53] reading from verse 18. the bible says
[1:12:55] for the wrath of god
[1:12:57] is revealed from heaven against all
[1:13:00] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:13:04] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[1:13:08] you see saints that is that is the
[1:13:11] responsibility that is given to us
[1:13:14] god has revealed great truth to us and
[1:13:18] the bible says here god wrath
[1:13:20] will be against a man that will hold
[1:13:22] this truth
[1:13:24] in unrighteousness
[1:13:29] praise the lord what a responsibility we
[1:13:31] have
[1:13:34] that god has placed in our hands
[1:13:38] what we could go into there but let's
[1:13:40] step up a little bit
[1:13:41] because the reason why god would do this
[1:13:45] he says because that which may be
[1:13:48] known of god the things to be known of
[1:13:52] god
[1:13:54] is manifest in them
[1:13:58] for god have shown it unto them
[1:14:04] god has shown it unto us let's follow
[1:14:08] the apostles a little bit
[1:14:09] for the invisible things
[1:14:13] the invisible things of him
[1:14:16] from the creation of the world
[1:14:19] the invisible things
[1:14:22] that's what paul is saying now the
[1:14:25] reason why
[1:14:26] god will judge this word the reason why
[1:14:29] he will condemn this word
[1:14:31] is because the invisible god
[1:14:34] threw out all the ages through signs
[1:14:38] through a medical
[1:14:42] doctor medical science and true and and
[1:14:45] and even
[1:14:46] the the the civilization we see around
[1:14:49] us
[1:14:52] everything that we see tangible
[1:14:56] from the invisible god
[1:15:00] amen amen
[1:15:04] he said because that which may be known
[1:15:06] of god is
[1:15:07] manifested in them for god has shown it
[1:15:11] unto them for the invisible things
[1:15:13] of him from the creation of the world
[1:15:15] are clearly
[1:15:16] seen the invisible things are
[1:15:19] clearly seen how are they seen because
[1:15:22] they will be invisible
[1:15:26] i clearly seen being understood
[1:15:30] by things that are made
[1:15:34] even his internal power
[1:15:37] in his godhead so this whole godhead
[1:15:41] about
[1:15:42] father son holy god jesus is god it all
[1:15:45] started from
[1:15:46] the invisible god trying to make himself
[1:15:50] visible amen
[1:15:53] trying to make himself visible
[1:15:58] the invisible god trying to make himself
[1:16:01] visible even the godhead
[1:16:06] that's where it started from from the
[1:16:07] invisible god
[1:16:09] trying to make himself visible
[1:16:13] so paul is saying
[1:16:16] the invisible things from the creation
[1:16:19] of the world
[1:16:20] are clearly seen being understood
[1:16:24] by the things that i made so the visible
[1:16:27] things
[1:16:28] are the manifestation of the
[1:16:31] invisible god
[1:16:35] because this god that we worship
[1:16:39] the god that we claim to be our god
[1:16:42] he's not a man god
[1:16:46] is not a man before there was
[1:16:50] time before there was anything that was
[1:16:53] ever made
[1:16:54] he existed by himself
[1:16:59] and he fell all time in all space
[1:17:06] that's why the apostle paul said don't
[1:17:08] be deceived
[1:17:10] you can't mock god
[1:17:14] you can't mock god you can play god
[1:17:20] amen praise the lord
[1:17:25] before there was anything that was me
[1:17:30] he existed by himself
[1:17:36] this is the one that has no beginning of
[1:17:39] day
[1:17:43] no beginning of day no father no mother
[1:17:48] that's the one that we are worshiping
[1:17:53] when you think about it
[1:17:56] it humbles your heart praise the lord
[1:18:01] he's a great god when we say he's a
[1:18:04] great god
[1:18:06] he's great in himself
[1:18:09] praise the lord god don't need to do
[1:18:12] something for you for him to be great
[1:18:15] for the matter of fact that you are a
[1:18:19] life
[1:18:19] you are existing show his greatness
[1:18:24] just for the fact that you are existing
[1:18:34] the express image of the invisible god
[1:18:39] he's trying to express himself
[1:18:43] he's trying to make himself known
[1:18:48] are we together
[1:18:54] that is the reason why every time you
[1:18:56] pick up the bible
[1:18:58] you have read it over and over but it
[1:19:02] says becomes new
[1:19:04] it's still open up because it's all part
[1:19:07] of the greatness of god you can
[1:19:09] you can never discover all about this
[1:19:12] god
[1:19:14] when you think that you know
[1:19:20] you have not begun yet
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:24] when you think that you know
[1:19:29] and you hear people say i know my god
[1:19:32] you know i know the god that i serve
[1:19:35] it's nothing to break about
[1:19:39] no it's nothing to break about
[1:19:45] praise the lord paul says something
[1:19:49] i'll share that with you first timothy
[1:19:53] chapter one let's look into that a
[1:19:55] little bit
[1:20:05] i'm so caught up in the thought of this
[1:20:06] thing that is it's hard for me to preach
[1:20:09] it
[1:20:10] the reason is because it's just
[1:20:14] it's just
[1:20:18] i mean it's it's just it's just like a
[1:20:20] slap on my face
[1:20:24] you know it's i mean the greatness of of
[1:20:27] our god
[1:20:28] it's just like a slap on my face i was i
[1:20:31] was trying to see how i can get away
[1:20:33] from this
[1:20:33] and and look for something evangelistic
[1:20:36] to preach about
[1:20:37] but i just i just felt like with all of
[1:20:40] the the prayer needs we had
[1:20:42] we need to talk about the greatness of
[1:20:44] god amen
[1:20:46] because our god is surely greater than
[1:20:48] coronavirus
[1:20:51] amen if he did not created a word there
[1:20:54] would not be a space for coronavirus
[1:20:58] amen he's greater than all every illness
[1:21:02] in our body
[1:21:04] praise the lord he is greater than uh
[1:21:06] than than your depths
[1:21:10] praise the lord amen when you have
[1:21:14] not figured out how to get out of debt
[1:21:16] god have already figured it out
[1:21:21] that's why we have to trust him
[1:21:33] praise the lord first timothy
[1:21:36] chapter 2 1 first team chapter 1 verse
[1:21:40] 17. see
[1:21:42] how the way the apostles said it here he
[1:21:44] says
[1:21:46] now onto the king in tenor
[1:21:51] the king in tanner
[1:21:55] immortal invisible
[1:21:59] do you know that internal life is
[1:22:01] invisible
[1:22:02] can you show me your internal life
[1:22:08] we all have eternal life here this
[1:22:10] morning can you reach in your pocket and
[1:22:12] show me your internal life
[1:22:17] can you show me your eternal life
[1:22:21] praise the lord amen is it because you
[1:22:24] come to church that you have eternal
[1:22:25] life
[1:22:26] no praise the lord amen
[1:22:34] you having faith this morning is that
[1:22:36] fit in the building this morning
[1:22:38] can you show me your faith
[1:22:42] can you put your hand in your pocket and
[1:22:43] bring out faith
[1:22:46] it's invincible
[1:22:51] praise the lord
[1:22:54] love is invisible
[1:22:58] love is not flowers no
[1:23:01] love is not flowers praise the lord
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:09] love is not flowers love is not sweet
[1:23:13] words
[1:23:18] praise the lord amen
[1:23:24] let me not go down that route this
[1:23:25] morning
[1:23:29] but paul said unto the king in tanner
[1:23:34] immortal do you know you have immortal
[1:23:39] life dwelling in you
[1:23:44] and what immortal means that you can't
[1:23:47] die
[1:23:51] you can die yes as soon as this body
[1:23:55] dropped
[1:23:55] that's right there is another body
[1:23:59] you drop this body you step into the
[1:24:02] other one
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:10] praise the lord but you see because
[1:24:14] these things are invisible that's the
[1:24:17] reason why
[1:24:18] when we get sick we feel the the visible
[1:24:21] chills on our body
[1:24:23] we feel the the symptoms and all of that
[1:24:26] and and and and it creates fear it looks
[1:24:30] like
[1:24:30] we are going and it's gone and after
[1:24:32] this we are lost
[1:24:34] but in the midst of all of that
[1:24:38] there is an invisible being
[1:24:51] unto the king in tanner
[1:24:54] immortal invisible
[1:24:58] the only wise god amen
[1:25:03] the only wise god
[1:25:08] that's why we can't outsmart him
[1:25:12] he expects us to come to him
[1:25:15] just as we are
[1:25:18] we can ask matt god
[1:25:22] we can play him
[1:25:26] the only wise god
[1:25:29] be honored and glory
[1:25:33] forever and ever
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:40] what a prayer yes to stick
[1:25:43] in your mind hallelujah onto the king
[1:25:47] in tanner immortal
[1:25:51] invisible yes the only wise
[1:25:54] god praise the lord
[1:26:01] we are so glad to call him our father
[1:26:04] amen amen
[1:26:06] so that's what god has been doing
[1:26:08] throughout all the ages
[1:26:12] that's how that's what he's been doing
[1:26:14] you see and
[1:26:15] and and and because if god do not
[1:26:18] express himself that way you will never
[1:26:22] be we will never be able to know him
[1:26:25] we will not be able to know him i mean
[1:26:27] we will be so confused
[1:26:31] we will be so confused even with all
[1:26:35] that we have read from the bible and all
[1:26:37] that we know from the scripture
[1:26:38] with all the denominations and
[1:26:41] everything that is happening out there
[1:26:42] in the name of the church
[1:26:44] we stay confused and all the religion
[1:26:48] out there
[1:26:53] but this invisible god
[1:26:57] this invisible god has been
[1:27:01] unfolding himself
[1:27:05] he's been unfolding himself that is the
[1:27:08] thing that buffered the minds of the
[1:27:09] people
[1:27:10] to think when god told
[1:27:13] to ahaz i will give you a sign a virgin
[1:27:16] child conceived
[1:27:19] it was god giving a sign it was god
[1:27:22] becoming a sign
[1:27:26] that jehovah god this invisible god will
[1:27:28] come
[1:27:29] in the form of a baby in dementia
[1:27:35] it's hard to wrap your mind around it
[1:27:38] i mean it's hard to wrap your mind
[1:27:40] around it why because
[1:27:42] the same nature has given us a sense of
[1:27:46] pride
[1:27:47] that when a man reached to a level
[1:27:50] of greatness he's not able to come down
[1:27:55] so it's hard for us to wrap our mind
[1:27:58] around
[1:27:58] the invisible god
[1:28:01] becoming a baby
[1:28:05] praise alone call the two years or you
[1:28:09] baby no i'm not a baby
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:18] it's just that you know pride that comes
[1:28:21] with the sin nature
[1:28:24] so because of that it's hard for us to
[1:28:27] wrap our mind
[1:28:28] around it
[1:28:32] that is the reason why to know god
[1:28:35] in every age just like how god
[1:28:38] in the beginning john said in the
[1:28:41] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:28:43] with god
[1:28:44] just how god the invisible god the great
[1:28:47] internal god had to condense himself
[1:28:51] into a body of light for the angels to
[1:28:54] worship him
[1:28:56] because the angels could now worship him
[1:28:58] until
[1:28:59] he became an image
[1:29:04] amen and so that is the same way in
[1:29:07] every age to every people that's right
[1:29:10] for you to know this invisible god he
[1:29:13] had to take a form
[1:29:15] to reveal himself amen
[1:29:20] amen he has to find a china that's what
[1:29:24] he used the prophets
[1:29:30] praise the lord that's why god will take
[1:29:33] a man
[1:29:33] in the age and god will take that man
[1:29:37] that is born and sin and by athlete
[1:29:40] parents
[1:29:41] and god will draw him to himself look at
[1:29:44] the life of moses
[1:29:45] god will take moses a murderer
[1:29:49] draw him to himself take him into his
[1:29:53] presence
[1:29:53] that that man can speak fleas into
[1:29:56] existence
[1:30:01] that demon he can turn the water into
[1:30:06] blood
[1:30:07] why is the invisible god
[1:30:12] coming down in the form
[1:30:15] amen to make himself visible to the
[1:30:18] people
[1:30:19] so the people that are believing him
[1:30:21] will be able to see him
[1:30:24] through a visible form
[1:30:29] amen that's why in every age she takes a
[1:30:33] right and after he has revealed himself
[1:30:38] he make himself visible
[1:30:42] hallelujah praise the lord amen
[1:30:46] that a man moses that one time ran away
[1:30:49] from egypt
[1:30:49] was right back in egypt again he never
[1:30:53] came with a military
[1:30:54] uh uh uh uh behind him and with with
[1:30:57] amherst and terror
[1:30:58] he came just with a drastic in his hands
[1:31:05] why because he saw the invisible god
[1:31:09] when the invisible god came down in the
[1:31:11] in in the form of a fire
[1:31:14] moses said it was a fire when he went
[1:31:18] there
[1:31:18] you see that that's the thing about this
[1:31:20] invisible god he can choose to take
[1:31:22] whatever form
[1:31:26] that pleases him he can choose to take
[1:31:29] whatever form
[1:31:32] whatever form amen amen
[1:31:37] one time he took a form of a
[1:31:38] three-year-old boy in the temple called
[1:31:40] samir
[1:31:43] he came down and started giving that
[1:31:45] three-year-old baby boy vision
[1:31:48] and speaking to him
[1:31:52] that's the thing about the invisible god
[1:31:55] and that
[1:31:56] is the proud that he had to have you
[1:31:58] young men and young women
[1:32:00] living a dedicated life yes
[1:32:05] praise the lord and god take you in your
[1:32:08] youthfulness
[1:32:09] yes yes don't miss out just like he did
[1:32:13] to jeremiah he take you in your
[1:32:16] youthfulness
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:18] yes he want to make something out of
[1:32:22] your life
[1:32:23] to show to this adulterous generation
[1:32:26] that a young man can live clean without
[1:32:30] follocation
[1:32:31] without a doctrine that a young woman
[1:32:33] can be a virgin
[1:32:35] until she walked down the aisle is the
[1:32:38] same invisible god
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:47] it's the same invisible god
[1:32:52] praise the lord each does not bother him
[1:32:56] if he don't get you in your youthful age
[1:32:59] he can get you in the older age
[1:33:01] because does not matter to god
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:19] the bible says there was a woman
[1:33:23] old hannah blind in the temple
[1:33:27] blind
[1:33:32] but just at the birth of jesus a blind
[1:33:34] woman
[1:33:37] when they called that little baby
[1:33:39] illegitimate child they gave him all
[1:33:41] sorts of names
[1:33:44] but that blind woman could see him
[1:33:48] hallelujah
[1:33:59] praise the lord oh samuel in the temple
[1:34:03] oh
[1:34:05] he did all he knew to burn insane
[1:34:08] and everything amen
[1:34:12] but god did not despise his old age
[1:34:17] when the world was brought to the temple
[1:34:20] in his own age he recognized the word
[1:34:23] for his day
[1:34:24] he said lord now your seven can depart
[1:34:28] in peace
[1:34:29] become my eyes yes
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:44] praise the lord
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:49] all that god has been doing through the
[1:34:51] ages is not to make
[1:34:52] church all he's been doing
[1:34:56] is expressing himself finding people
[1:35:00] that he can express himself through
[1:35:03] praise the lord amen
[1:35:11] finding husband and wife that he can
[1:35:13] express himself through
[1:35:14] the man is like christ the woman is the
[1:35:16] type of the church
[1:35:19] and god wants to express himself through
[1:35:21] your union
[1:35:24] that's all he's been doing so the
[1:35:26] invisible god that's why jesus
[1:35:28] said let men see your good work
[1:35:31] and praise you is that what the
[1:35:34] scripture says
[1:35:35] and praise you let them see your good
[1:35:37] work and glorify your father
[1:35:41] because your work expressed the
[1:35:43] invisible god
[1:35:45] amen amen
[1:35:49] amen so if we don't praise you don't
[1:35:52] feel bad
[1:35:58] amen you should feel bad if we don't
[1:36:01] glorify the father
[1:36:03] because that's the purpose that's right
[1:36:07] to glorify the father
[1:36:10] that's god's purpose
[1:36:14] that's god's purpose
[1:36:26] and that's the thing sometimes that hurt
[1:36:29] you know it hurts i mean after a person
[1:36:32] and then yo you hear that with with many
[1:36:35] other people
[1:36:36] that really came in contact with the
[1:36:38] revelation of the world
[1:36:40] when they have when they have hate that
[1:36:42] uh
[1:36:43] that that year they mean when they have
[1:36:45] hit that super age
[1:36:48] praise the lord they have fees so broken
[1:36:53] why they didn't see this all of my life
[1:36:57] praise the lord
[1:37:01] amen but you don't have to be
[1:37:04] discouraged
[1:37:05] god kept you for that purpose
[1:37:08] amen to show that he the invisible god
[1:37:12] he can reveal himself whenever he wants
[1:37:15] to
[1:37:16] and whoever he wants to
[1:37:21] amen so if god is dealing with your
[1:37:24] heart
[1:37:25] if the fear of god is dealing with your
[1:37:28] heart
[1:37:30] against things don't play with him
[1:37:34] don't think that you are in control you
[1:37:37] are not in control
[1:37:40] amen you are not in control yes
[1:37:46] let me read something to you i'm just
[1:37:48] completely away from my notes
[1:37:50] but that's good amen

[1:38:24] alive he says
[1:38:25] what is this you are bumping into all
[1:38:27] the time

[1:38:47] wrong
[1:38:48] what is that thing that tells you
[1:38:52] when nobody is dead and nobody knows
[1:38:55] what you are doing
[1:38:56] what condemns you that's his presence
[1:39:01] he's the invisible god because you can

[1:39:58] with your heart
[1:40:02] that's him you might not be
[1:40:05] able to open your eyes and see him

[1:40:24] he can use a sister to talk to you he
[1:40:27] can use a brother to talk to you
[1:40:30] he can use a preacher to preach his word
[1:40:32] he can use somebody to sing a song
[1:40:35] and that song can minister to you he
[1:40:37] dwarfed
[1:40:38] among his people
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:45] because he endured among invisible
[1:40:48] people
[1:40:49] making himself visible by
[1:40:52] his promised word
[1:40:55] in that people so god
[1:40:58] is making himself visible that's the
[1:41:01] reason why
[1:41:02] he called a people for his namesake
[1:41:06] to make himself visible that's the
[1:41:09] reason why
[1:41:10] he gave us a a a
[1:41:13] a prophet a son of man
[1:41:18] with the ministry of their son of man to
[1:41:21] make himself visible
[1:41:22] because until god becomes visible you
[1:41:24] can't worship him
[1:41:26] you will not be able to understand
[1:41:29] you will just be conforming to religion
[1:41:32] to create
[1:41:33] but unless god becomes visible his word
[1:41:36] becomes so
[1:41:37] visible that you can say this is god
[1:41:42] nothing but god
[1:41:46] and when god become visible to you that
[1:41:48] way nobody can kick you out
[1:41:50] nobody can tell you different you don't
[1:41:53] want an explanation from a pope or from
[1:41:55] a priest or whoever it is
[1:41:58] he has become so visible to you
[1:42:01] praise the lord that was the place where
[1:42:04] little david was standing amen
[1:42:07] he didn't care whether you believe his
[1:42:09] testimony on that
[1:42:11] david did not care he knew
[1:42:14] that he killed a lion he knew that he
[1:42:18] killed a bell you
[1:42:19] you want to prove it by his age you want
[1:42:21] to prove it how dangerous
[1:42:23] a lion is you couldn't tell david
[1:42:25] anything different
[1:42:27] because it was so real to him that's the
[1:42:29] reason why goliath was just
[1:42:31] like a little boy in david eyes
[1:42:35] because the invisible god became so
[1:42:37] visible
[1:42:39] to david when invisible god becomes so
[1:42:43] visible to you
[1:42:44] there is nothing nothing corrupt or
[1:42:47] filtered on the internet can be able to
[1:42:49] rob your mind
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:54] praise the lord there is nothing that
[1:42:57] this world can offer
[1:43:00] because he has become so visible his
[1:43:03] glory
[1:43:04] is so close to you
[1:43:08] that it drives you away from anything
[1:43:12] that is ongoing that's right
[1:43:16] we're not talking about church
[1:43:17] membership not talking about putting
[1:43:20] your names on the book
[1:43:22] we are talking about coming in contact
[1:43:25] with the invisible god by him making
[1:43:28] himself
[1:43:29] visible
[1:43:32] praise the lord amen amen
[1:43:38] science want to make us and tell us that
[1:43:41] you got to see before you believe
[1:43:45] amen say you got to see it before you
[1:43:48] believe
[1:43:49] yes praise the lord
[1:43:53] but you see god is not bothered by
[1:43:55] science
[1:43:58] because he's not taken from science
[1:43:59] science is taken from him
[1:44:02] praise the lord science is taken from
[1:44:05] him
[1:44:06] amen you know
[1:44:09] brother lonnie he used to have this
[1:44:11] story he says
[1:44:14] the scientists wanted to go in context
[1:44:16] with god
[1:44:18] and he says let's go in context god said
[1:44:20] well okay
[1:44:23] praise the lord they say okay whatever
[1:44:25] you may we can make the same
[1:44:27] god said okay you go first amen
[1:44:31] they tried to go and take something from
[1:44:33] the universe because you know
[1:44:35] all of these things are mated
[1:44:39] amen make your own stars make your own
[1:44:43] planet
[1:44:47] create your own word and then you can do
[1:44:49] experiment you are using my
[1:44:51] product and then you trying to tell me
[1:44:54] that i don't exist
[1:45:07] amen you're using my own thing then
[1:45:09] you're saying i did not exist
[1:45:20] the invisible god the express image
[1:45:24] the express image the bible says god is
[1:45:27] spirit
[1:45:28] and they that worship him must worship
[1:45:31] him in spirit and in truth let's just
[1:45:32] take
[1:45:33] this from christ is the mystery of god
[1:45:35] reveal and then we will find a place to
[1:45:37] close you
[1:45:38] thank you for being patient with me amen
[1:45:42] now listen today this is this is very
[1:45:44] profound and in a way that
[1:45:46] he said yeah now for a text
[1:45:49] i want to take out of there this
[1:45:52] is a text basing it upon the entire
[1:45:56] bible
[1:45:59] this christ is the mystery of god
[1:46:02] revealed
[1:46:02] is based on the entire bible
[1:46:06] from genesis to revelation christ
[1:46:09] was revealing god through the entire
[1:46:12] bible
[1:46:15] amen christ not jesus
[1:46:19] the man christ
[1:46:22] the lord christ the anointed
[1:46:26] one was revealing god
[1:46:29] throughout the entire bible
[1:46:33] are we together and i want to tie to
[1:46:36] this christ the mystery of god reveal
[1:46:39] christ being the mystery of god revealed
[1:46:41] now
[1:46:42] god's secret mystery he had before the
[1:46:45] world began
[1:46:47] now back in the back part of his mind
[1:46:49] there was
[1:46:50] something that he was trying and was
[1:46:53] going
[1:46:54] to achieve what was that thing
[1:46:57] to make himself known
[1:47:01] that's all god wants to achieve to make
[1:47:04] himself known to you
[1:47:07] that he's your creator hallelujah he had
[1:47:10] given the boundaries of your life
[1:47:13] the day you will be here and the day
[1:47:14] you'll be gone out of this earth
[1:47:17] he want to make himself known to you
[1:47:20] without him you will never succeed he
[1:47:23] want to make himself known to you that's
[1:47:25] that's what god
[1:47:26] wanted to achieve is to make himself
[1:47:29] known
[1:47:30] that's all the preaching of the gospel
[1:47:32] is all about is for god
[1:47:36] to become known to us
[1:47:44] something that he was trying and was
[1:47:46] going to achieve
[1:47:48] and he had a motive of doing it
[1:47:51] and in order to to let himself be
[1:47:55] expressed amen
[1:47:59] so you see it even go a little farther
[1:48:02] not just for you to know him
[1:48:05] but for him to express himself through
[1:48:07] you
[1:48:11] because when you come to know him he
[1:48:13] wants
[1:48:14] to express himself through you so your
[1:48:16] friend can come to know him
[1:48:18] so your relatives can come to know him
[1:48:22] because when they look at your life
[1:48:25] and know who you were and the things
[1:48:27] that you used to do
[1:48:29] they say no this is not junior that we
[1:48:32] know
[1:48:34] that's not junior maybe something
[1:48:36] happened to him
[1:48:38] praise the lord amen
[1:48:45] my stepmom used to do that when i got
[1:48:48] saved
[1:48:50] she had a pentecostal friend you know
[1:48:53] and uh she always should be she will
[1:48:56] always be talking to the lady
[1:48:58] it looks like something has come over
[1:48:59] him you know
[1:49:01] in the night he just ch i don't know
[1:49:04] he's chanting or what
[1:49:06] i was praying at the time amen
[1:49:13] and then she would try to explain it to
[1:49:14] him to her but she
[1:49:16] she wouldn't get it you know because we
[1:49:17] were from uh from a melody's family
[1:49:20] and uh she will she was not able to get
[1:49:23] it but
[1:49:24] but that's what it is praise the lord
[1:49:28] sometimes you think that you just have
[1:49:30] it in your hand and you can do it
[1:49:32] and i can tell you that you know what
[1:49:34] many times we misrepresent jesus
[1:49:37] praise the lord we misrepresent him
[1:49:39] because we try to take it as our
[1:49:41] personality
[1:49:42] when it's not your personality
[1:49:48] now god's secret mystery he had before
[1:49:50] the word now
[1:49:51] back in the back part of his mind there
[1:49:53] was something he was trying
[1:49:55] and was going to achieve and he had a
[1:49:58] motive of doing it in order
[1:49:59] for him to as for for himself to be
[1:50:02] expressed because
[1:50:03] first there there wasn't even a moon
[1:50:07] style outer molecule anything
[1:50:11] there was nothing nothing
[1:50:16] he was god amen praise the lord
[1:50:20] just like i said the other day
[1:50:23] if you don't worship god he don't take
[1:50:26] nothing from him
[1:50:29] no for us to come and worship god is for
[1:50:32] our own benefit
[1:50:34] amen praise the lord it's for our own
[1:50:38] benefit
[1:50:39] when paul says don't forsake the
[1:50:41] assembling of the saints
[1:50:43] if you choose not to worship god it does
[1:50:45] not change him
[1:50:47] praise the lord amen
[1:50:52] if you have ever had a true experience
[1:50:54] of god you will see how it affects your
[1:50:56] life
[1:50:57] because you won't have the joy that
[1:50:59] you're supposed to have
[1:51:01] you won't have that peace of mind that
[1:51:03] you're supposed to have
[1:51:05] you just get in the wilderness and you
[1:51:07] start longing you warm days you want
[1:51:09] this you will just
[1:51:10] you just be running all over the place
[1:51:16] because before you were made
[1:51:19] god existed amen
[1:51:26] before there was even the moon stars
[1:51:28] atom anything
[1:51:30] there was nothing it was all all
[1:51:34] blackness there was no
[1:51:38] sun that that's that's what i was i was
[1:51:40] reading this morning listening to it
[1:51:42] when that song came on my mind
[1:51:44] he carried the weight of the word on his
[1:51:46] shoulder
[1:51:47] not only at the cross even before there
[1:51:50] was anything
[1:51:51] god carried everything in himself
[1:51:54] the creation of this world he was
[1:51:56] carrying it in himself
[1:52:01] praise the lord
[1:52:06] before there was anything it was him
[1:52:11] and him alone
[1:52:20] there wasn't no sun no more no stars
[1:52:24] no nothing then he was god
[1:52:31] and he asked joe where were you
[1:52:35] where were you
[1:52:39] where were you
[1:52:43] when i lay the foundation of the wood
[1:52:56] amen
[1:52:58] see the monsters sang together for joy
[1:53:01] the sons of god
[1:53:02] the morningstar sang together the sons
[1:53:04] of god shouted for joy
[1:53:06] where were you that was way back
[1:53:09] before the earth was
[1:53:14] praise the lord
[1:53:17] the expression of the invisible god
[1:53:22] god expressing himself making himself
[1:53:26] known
[1:53:28] praise the lord
[1:53:32] making himself known making himself real
[1:53:38] trying to grab people
[1:53:41] that he can express himself in look at
[1:53:43] the day that we are living in
[1:53:45] the lawless day with all
[1:53:48] of the things that is happening in the
[1:53:51] name of the church
[1:53:53] as soon as you take a bible or you want
[1:53:56] to talk about the lord jesus
[1:53:59] people just think it's one of them there
[1:54:02] all the one is just it's just people
[1:54:04] money the church is a business
[1:54:08] they don't see this thing that was in
[1:54:11] god's mind
[1:54:12] to be able to get a people that he can
[1:54:15] express himself through
[1:54:19] you see that's the reason why god
[1:54:22] under the old testament he chose the
[1:54:24] jewish people
[1:54:26] and he gave them lord and ordinance
[1:54:30] because they were the people that he
[1:54:33] wanted to express himself through
[1:54:35] what the what did the the the rahab said
[1:54:40] rahab said we have heard about your god
[1:54:44] how he opened the red sea all the
[1:54:46] nations
[1:54:48] around
[1:54:51] praise the lord they could stay in their
[1:54:54] lane
[1:54:55] and in the night they would see the
[1:54:56] pillow of fire hanging
[1:54:58] over the children of israel when
[1:55:01] everywhere is that
[1:55:02] they can see light so they knew there
[1:55:05] was something special about those people
[1:55:08] god choose them to be able to express
[1:55:10] himself
[1:55:12] that's why he gave them his lord and his
[1:55:16] ordinances
[1:55:18] to be able to show through them that i'm
[1:55:20] a holy god
[1:55:24] i'm a holy god i'm a righteous god
[1:55:29] he was expressing himself
[1:55:33] but because he was coming from the
[1:55:36] invisible to the visible
[1:55:39] he had not entered the human soul yet
[1:55:43] that's the reason why all their
[1:55:44] ordinance was just
[1:55:46] literal ordinance physical things don't
[1:55:49] touch this don't touch this don't do
[1:55:51] this
[1:55:53] it was all physical things
[1:55:58] but finally when god
[1:56:02] got himself a body
[1:56:05] when he got himself a body
[1:56:11] praise the lord do you know
[1:56:14] for you to be here i mean in this world
[1:56:17] to be born
[1:56:19] there were thousands of your brothers
[1:56:21] and sisters that had to die
[1:56:25] because there were a lot of there were a
[1:56:27] lot of sales
[1:56:29] from your father a lot of elses from
[1:56:33] your mother
[1:56:33] that could have made other brothers and
[1:56:35] sisters of yours
[1:56:38] but god has to choose the one that make
[1:56:41] you
[1:56:44] but when it came to jesus there was not
[1:56:46] multiple cells
[1:56:49] god himself produced the blood cells for
[1:56:51] one body
[1:56:54] and he produced the egg cells for one
[1:56:56] body
[1:56:58] so there were now multiple cells just
[1:57:00] like from from your father from our
[1:57:02] father and our mother
[1:57:06] and finally god god a man
[1:57:10] and he couldn't express himself in it
[1:57:16] nicodemus came to him by night and says
[1:57:19] look we know we talk about it no man can
[1:57:22] do this
[1:57:24] except god except
[1:57:27] god they could see
[1:57:30] but they just couldn't fight from it
[1:57:34] the god that led our fathers by the
[1:57:36] pillar of fire how could he come into
[1:57:38] this capital boy
[1:57:39] they just could not wrap their mind
[1:57:41] around it
[1:57:43] that's why god did not call us to
[1:57:45] understand he called us to believe him
[1:57:50] because there are things that happen in
[1:57:52] our life we can wrap our mind
[1:57:53] on it i'm serving god i'm a son of god
[1:57:56] why is this happening
[1:57:58] you will never be able to wrap your mind
[1:58:00] on it
[1:58:02] but if you have seen the invisible one
[1:58:06] no matter what comes
[1:58:10] no matter what comes you can
[1:58:13] you can say i have seen him that is
[1:58:15] invisible
[1:58:19] praise the lord
[1:58:23] musicians you can come
[1:58:33] sometimes god has to take us through
[1:58:36] tough trials to be able to break us
[1:58:41] so we can see him sometimes the things
[1:58:44] that we go through is for our own good
[1:58:49] because he wants to make himself real
[1:58:55] he want to make himself real
[1:59:05] let's let's play that song again and
[1:59:08] there's no mountain too tall
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:25] let's buy our hands and just
[1:59:29] worship him just think about him
[1:59:32] this morning
[1:59:54] what is bothering you
[1:59:58] are you worrying about

[2:01:18] that are happening
[2:01:24] what kind of trouble you are in and you
[2:01:25] think god cannot bring you out of faith
[2:01:27] [Music]
[2:01:34] he carried this entire word
[2:01:37] everything that was made he carried it
[2:01:39] in him
[2:01:41] before there was anything that was made
[2:01:44] it was just him and him alone
[2:01:51] and he brought those things out in the
[2:01:52] form of creation
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:02:00] and the creation drifted away from him
[2:02:02] and yet he came in the form of a man
[2:02:05] and he took the scene of the word upon
[2:02:07] his shoulder once again
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:11] to prove that he's the father

[2:15:18] he's an old timer he's a man of faith
[2:15:22] he was an evangelist and an apostle
[2:15:25] in a sense that i think that is very
[2:15:28] significant he's a
[2:15:30] he takes teams around south africa
[2:15:33] he goes into villages and just put up
[2:15:36] tents
[2:15:38] and and stayed at a week have meetings
[2:15:41] and uh and and for many of those things
[2:15:43] there were there were churches that was
[2:15:45] birthed
[2:15:46] in different places but he was he was
[2:15:48] very
[2:15:49] he was unknown by all the believers
[2:15:51] there there uh
[2:15:53] so they were coming from a finer that he
[2:15:57] and his son-in-law that also passed
[2:16:00] uh preach and they would return him back
[2:16:04] and his wife there i mean you listening
[2:16:06] to the tributes
[2:16:08] that was given to that sister you say oh
[2:16:10] my goodness
[2:16:12] oh my goodness i mean if the saints
[2:16:16] if god could give them you know the
[2:16:19] grace to
[2:16:20] to be just like the the scenes in uh in
[2:16:23] in the book of arts that called for
[2:16:25] doctors to come back
[2:16:26] i mean she had such a testimony i mean
[2:16:29] she was
[2:16:29] mother to to all the children you know
[2:16:33] and and a great supporter to her husband
[2:16:37] i mean a woman that had such a
[2:16:39] confidence
[2:16:41] i learned that morning at the funeral
[2:16:45] she signed she and her daughter that
[2:16:47] also passed signed the song
[2:16:49] when the road is caught up yandere i
[2:16:51] would be there
[2:16:53] and not knowing she was prophesying
[2:16:57] that she was going to go before her
[2:17:00] husband
[2:17:01] prashanik is recovering and
[2:17:04] it's very difficult for him he lost his
[2:17:06] wife and he lost
[2:17:08] his daughter and his son-in-law the next
[2:17:11] picture
[2:17:13] is uh uh
[2:17:16] the picture of brother babes uh
[2:17:19] and there's their sister eunice there
[2:17:23] like we share with you a little bit on
[2:17:25] wednesday night
[2:17:27] uh you know but base i was trying to get
[2:17:29] the numbers together it was actually
[2:17:31] seven years
[2:17:32] that he stayed in prison for something
[2:17:35] that he never did
[2:17:36] and uh but you could never make better
[2:17:41] fee sign for being in praising you could
[2:17:44] never
[2:17:45] you could never bring sadness out of him
[2:17:47] why because
[2:17:48] he felt like he was not serving a
[2:17:50] sentence that was the first message he
[2:17:53] preached when he came out of prison
[2:17:54] i never said a sentence i said the
[2:17:56] purpose
[2:17:58] he says when you go to praising
[2:18:02] you become a hero he says but god has to
[2:18:06] bring you to zero
[2:18:08] from a hero to zero amen
[2:18:12] for you to be able to understand what
[2:18:14] actually he's doing in your life
[2:18:16] and many times that's what happened you
[2:18:18] know many of us we own our
[2:18:20] houses so proud so arrogant god has to
[2:18:23] bring
[2:18:24] us down to zero for us to really
[2:18:26] understand
[2:18:27] what he wants to make out of our lives
[2:18:30] yes uh that's our brother brother babes
[2:18:34] and the last time i was in i was over
[2:18:37] there
[2:18:38] in south africa i really wanted to
[2:18:39] contact him you know
[2:18:43] and and we didn't have the privilege to
[2:18:45] to be able
[2:18:46] to to contact him but
[2:18:50] i think i spoke with him when he was all
[2:18:52] in praising
[2:18:54] and you know he loved
[2:18:57] he left a very very tremendous testimony
[2:19:00] tremendous testimony just imagine he was
[2:19:03] pastoring the church
[2:19:05] and he had just had his first first try
[2:19:07] before
[2:19:08] that incident took place he was falsely
[2:19:10] accusing
[2:19:12] and uh you know and all of that
[2:19:15] you know you know the brothers were
[2:19:17] talking and talking about that you go to
[2:19:19] see but baby praising
[2:19:21] as uh you know you try to be sorry he
[2:19:23] will just break you out into some kind
[2:19:25] of a laughter
[2:19:27] you know and uh he was he was never the
[2:19:30] man that carries sorrow with him
[2:19:33] you know yeah and uh
[2:19:36] the same with brother shannon's wife i
[2:19:38] mean she was a sister
[2:19:40] of contempt you know she just has
[2:19:44] such a content and she was a strength
[2:19:47] to her husband ministry
[2:19:50] i mean even if she was now well she
[2:19:52] wanted to be there
[2:19:53] she wanted to make sure she sing a song
[2:19:55] before he comes to the pooping
[2:19:57] you know that was the kind of a woman
[2:19:59] that
[2:20:00] she was so we would miss them but they
[2:20:04] ain't a better place
[2:20:05] praise the lord i think they understand
[2:20:07] about the invisible more than you and
[2:20:09] myself do
[2:20:10] because everything now is so visible to
[2:20:12] them amen
[2:20:13] heaven is visible to them heaven is
[2:20:15] invisible to you and myself
[2:20:17] but heaven is visible to them praise the
[2:20:19] lord so
