[25:20] verse 1.
[25:22] 23
[25:26] in the beginning was the word
[25:28] and the Word was with God and the world
[25:30] was gone the same was in the beginning
[25:33] with God all things
[25:35] were made by him and without him was not

[27:09] you father in Jesus name we pray amen
[27:13] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[27:15] your seed praise the Lord you may have
[27:18] your seed
[27:19] okay I know I had a
[27:22] praise report here Shalom Saints I want
[27:25] uh
[27:27] to use this opportunity to thank you all
[27:30] for your prayers while I was away
[27:33] I also bring greetings from my dad
[27:36] brothers and sister-in-law their sister
[27:40] Bureau so we thank the Lord for granting
[27:43] our sister a safe travel
[27:45] and
[27:47] so on Sunday we were talking about uh
[27:52] the reproach
[27:54] of the word
[27:56] we were talking about a reproach of the
[27:59] word we were taking our inspiration from
[28:02] the message
[28:03] reproach for the cause of the word
[28:06] so uh and what we were trying to show is
[28:10] the other is because we are we are
[28:15] bearing the word that's the reason why
[28:19] we have been reproached
[28:21] praise the Lord that's that's the
[28:23] picture I want us to get
[28:25] whatever whatever is the devil that is
[28:29] reproaching Us by trials and and
[28:32] different things all it is scoffers that
[28:36] are mugging us because of our Word of
[28:39] Life our address and whatever it is the
[28:43] reason why we have been reproached is
[28:47] because God has called us to bear his
[28:51] word
[28:52] praise the Lord
[28:54] I want us to grab that picture and then
[28:57] we will read a quote here from the
[28:59] message reproach for the course of the
[29:02] word that's what I would take my my
[29:03] thoughts from tonight
[29:06] and uh
[29:15] that's what I would take my thoughts
[29:17] from tonight
[29:19] and
[29:28] I think sister
[29:30] Naisha mom and Anne supposed to be
[29:33] traveling tomorrow
[29:34] so we would like to keep them in our
[29:37] prayers their flight is set for tomorrow
[29:39] evening and I think they are giving IRA
[29:43] and his wife
[29:44] some support before they head out
[29:47] so let's let's look into that tonight if
[29:52] our Tech Team can just put up their code
[29:56] that we want to I want to I want to use
[29:59] there to be for us to be able to create
[30:02] uh
[30:03] the focus tonight brother Branham says
[30:06] here he says
[30:08] Jesus
[30:10] reproach for the word
[30:14] Jesus
[30:16] reproach for the word so that they use
[30:19] their phrase to be my message tonight
[30:21] Jesus reproached for the word
[30:25] so what I want to do with this thought
[30:28] is to
[30:30] separate Jesus from the word
[30:34] Jesus reproach for the word
[30:39] he was reproached for the word because
[30:41] he was bearing the word he was the
[30:43] vessel that the word was in
[30:47] that's the reason why he was reproached
[30:52] praise the Lord
[30:53] amen so in the beginning was the word
[30:59] that's what we read that's what the
[31:01] scripture says that's what we believe
[31:03] in the beginning was the word and the
[31:07] Word was with God the world was God so
[31:09] uh as as you as we look at that thought
[31:12] tonight you can take each of those
[31:16] phrase and break it down and then it
[31:19] helped us to be able to see the the
[31:23] steps
[31:24] that the word went from one to the other
[31:29] we were not we will not take all of the
[31:32] time on that tonight but what I want for
[31:35] us to do like I said
[31:37] and uh
[31:39] uh so we will see here that uh the Bible
[31:43] says in the beginning back again was the
[31:46] word the word was with God the world was
[31:48] God the same was in the beginning with
[31:50] God all things were made by him and
[31:54] without him was not anything made that
[31:57] was made so let's go to First collusion
[32:01] I mean sorry no first collusion there is
[32:04] no first solution there is just only one
[32:06] amen
[32:08] let's go to the book of collusion and
[32:12] there should be right after our book of
[32:19] Philippians
[32:36] that will help us to be able to grab our
[32:38] thoughts tonight let's read from verse
[32:40] 12. mm-hmm
[32:42] chapter 1 from verse 12 giving thanks
[32:45] unto the father
[32:47] which have made us
[32:50] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[32:53] of the sins in light
[32:57] who have delivered us from the power of
[32:59] darkness and have translated us into the
[33:03] kingdom of his dear son
[33:05] in whom we have Redemption through his
[33:08] blood
[33:09] even the Forgiveness of sins amen am I
[33:14] am I reading from the right place did I
[33:16] told you something different
[33:18] amen who is the image of the invisible
[33:23] God
[33:25] the firstborn
[33:27] of every creature
[33:30] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[33:33] Brothers this is where brother Branham
[33:34] took his uh his teaching from portion of
[33:38] his teaching
[33:39] this brings us back to
[33:42] Saint John chapter 1. and it take us
[33:46] back to Genesis chapter 1.
[33:49] praise the Lord
[33:51] in the beginning was the word
[33:54] now Paul yet is making us to understand
[33:57] in verse 15 who is the image of the
[34:01] invisible God
[34:03] so uh uh the invisible God the invisible
[34:08] spirit
[34:10] talk a form
[34:14] praise the Lord
[34:15] so in the beginning was the word
[34:18] Thy Word was the form of the invisible
[34:23] God
[34:23] it was the image
[34:26] of the invisible God and that word image
[34:29] as I was studying it it came out a
[34:32] beautiful year I was looking at that
[34:36] it comes from a Greek war a Greek word
[34:38] that is spelled e-i-k-o-n
[34:43] their original form from which it is
[34:47] drawn
[34:49] not merely a thing it resembled
[34:54] it's too different
[34:56] praise the Lord
[34:58] the original form from which
[35:02] it is drawn not merely
[35:05] uh I think it resemble now the reason
[35:09] why I took that was because on Sunday we
[35:13] were showing uh the difference between
[35:17] reflecting and resembling
[35:21] praise the Lord
[35:22] so the the image of their invisible God
[35:27] is not a form of resemblance
[35:31] it's a form of reflecting
[35:36] are we together
[35:39] praise the Lord I'm trying to I'm trying
[35:41] to get you I see you a bit spread out in
[35:45] uh in in your mind not not where you are
[35:47] sitting but you are you are spread I'm
[35:49] trying to I'm fishing out for your
[35:51] spirit tonight amen
[35:55] so the the the who is the image
[36:00] of the invisible God
[36:04] the firstborn of every creature
[36:09] praise the Lord so the invisible God
[36:13] hard to give birth have to bring forth
[36:17] that's where that image is he was drawn
[36:21] from himself
[36:25] amen he came from an invisible God and
[36:31] now he becomes he took a form called the
[36:35] word called the logos
[36:38] he took a form as a body of light
[36:43] are we together
[36:48] for by him where all things created
[36:52] so it goes back to Saint John chapter 1
[36:55] in the beginning was the word the word
[36:57] was with God the world was God and by
[36:59] him you know he made all things
[37:04] so Paul is here using their very same
[37:09] thought for by him were all things
[37:11] created that is in
[37:14] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[37:19] invisible whether there be trans
[37:21] Dominion principalities
[37:25] all powers now you you look at this word
[37:28] principality it has also to do with
[37:32] every evil spirit
[37:38] every Power
[37:43] are we together
[37:45] praise the Lord
[37:46] so just like how we were created for a
[37:51] purpose the evil Powers were also
[37:53] created for the purpose
[37:59] are we together
[38:02] they are all subject onto the Creator
[38:06] all things were created by Him and for
[38:10] him
[38:17] and he is before all things and by him
[38:20] all things can say so we go back to that
[38:25] and uh taking the word image Also let's
[38:30] uh look back in Saint John chapter one
[38:34] let's look at verse 18.
[38:52] it's in John chapter 1 let's look at
[38:55] verse 18.
[39:05] Verse 18 John will Express yet he said
[39:08] no man has seen God
[39:12] at any time
[39:14] the only begotten son which is in the
[39:18] bosom of the father
[39:20] he have declared
[39:23] so the image of the invisible God was
[39:26] just declaring
[39:29] so once again it's not a resemblance
[39:32] it's a reflection
[39:35] amen because that's what you do with
[39:38] light when the place is dark you you
[39:41] turn the light on to declare what is
[39:43] there the life will show what is there
[39:49] are we together
[39:52] praise the Lord
[40:01] now so so uh uh Jesus
[40:08] brother banham said Jesus reproach for
[40:12] the word
[40:15] he goes ahead he said Jesus was
[40:17] reproached for the word Lord here how
[40:20] could he stand the reproach
[40:23] when he was the Divine incarnate God he
[40:29] was God himself made flesh
[40:33] praise the Lord
[40:36] amen
[40:37] so that's what we want to follow tonight
[40:40] he says Jesus reproach for the word
[40:46] so we look up there from the beginning
[40:49] and then we want to come
[40:51] year
[40:53] in Luke chapter 3.
[40:57] Luke chapter 3 let's read the
[41:00] uh
[41:15] praise the Lord
[41:18] Luke chapter 3
[41:22] let's read from verse 21.
[41:27] Luke chapter 3 reading from verse 21.
[41:36] now when all the people
[41:40] were baptized it came to pass that Jesus
[41:44] also being baptized
[41:47] and praying the heaven was open
[41:51] and the Holy Ghost descended
[41:55] in a bodily shape like a dove upon him
[42:00] and a voice came from heaven we said
[42:04] thou our mind beloved Son
[42:08] in D I am well pleased
[42:13] praise the Lord
[42:15] amen
[42:17] I'm well pleased
[42:21] as chapter 10 keep there in your mind
[42:24] the descending of the Holy Ghost in the
[42:27] in the bodily ship and see what the
[42:30] apostle was said in Acts chapter 10.
[42:33] let's take Acts chapter 10.
[42:39] now there was the same look that wrote
[42:41] that
[42:43] but he expressed it here in another way
[42:46] you will soon grab the picture where
[42:48] we're going
[42:50] we'll build it and then we will preach
[42:53] praise the Lord as chapter 10 let's look
[42:56] at verse 38.
[42:59] as chapter 10 verse 38.
[43:11] okay as chapter 10. verse 38 the Bible
[43:15] says
[43:16] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[43:20] the Holy Ghost and power when was he
[43:23] anointed
[43:26] from the scripture that we have just
[43:27] read
[43:28] in Luke when was Jesus Anointed with the
[43:32] Holy Ghost
[43:34] praise the Lord
[43:37] I didn't hear anybody say anything
[43:41] I just said praise the Lord so you can
[43:43] answer me
[43:46] and he said praise the Lord because I
[43:47] agree with you I didn't hear what you
[43:49] said
[43:55] when was Jesus
[43:57] Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[44:01] after baptism
[44:03] he was anointed with the Holy Ghost in
[44:06] power so you will see here that Jesus
[44:12] in the beginning was the word I want to
[44:15] hold my place here so
[44:17] so what we are looking at is the other
[44:20] Jesus was born the word
[44:24] amen what word
[44:27] was born the Virgin shall conceive
[44:30] that was Jesus that was the word
[44:34] esta shall rise out of Jacob
[44:37] that was a word that Balaam said
[44:41] the Sea of the woman will bruise the
[44:44] serpent head that was the word
[44:48] amen that word was before Jesus
[44:55] the star rise out of Jacob it was a word
[44:58] before Jesus
[45:02] a virgin shall conceive he will be
[45:05] called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty
[45:08] God that word the Isaiah spoke was
[45:11] before Jesus
[45:15] are we together
[45:17] praise the Lord
[45:19] now so all that promised word
[45:25] the angel Gabriel will now take all of
[45:29] their promises that were speaking about
[45:31] the Messiah to find a virgin and speak
[45:35] the word to thy virgin
[45:38] are we together
[45:40] amen
[45:42] the reason why Jesus was not born is
[45:47] seen because he was called the seed of
[45:49] the woman meaning that the woman will
[45:52] have a seed with no man
[45:55] the reason why he was not and he was not
[45:58] born in sin because uh uh the seat of
[46:01] the woman tying it with the Virgin shall
[46:03] conceived is the same
[46:07] are we together
[46:14] now so that word
[46:17] that was spoken by the prophets all the
[46:20] promises the law of God shall raise up a
[46:24] prophet like me that was a word that
[46:26] Moses spoke
[46:28] amen it was a promise
[46:32] you remember when that when the
[46:34] Pharisees went to to meet John the
[46:37] Baptist they says are you Elias he said
[46:40] no this is are you the Messiah he said
[46:43] no they said are you that Prophet which
[46:46] prophet they were talking about the one
[46:47] that Moses spoke of
[46:54] so you see all of those promises
[46:58] now
[47:00] form that word was now formed in
[47:03] marriage
[47:07] praise the Lord
[47:10] a former body
[47:14] and that has birth the angel said He
[47:17] Shall be Called Jesus
[47:20] because he will do what
[47:24] oh let's talk people let's talk let's
[47:26] talk let's talk let's talk let's talk
[47:30] let's talk let's talk
[47:34] praise the Lord
[47:36] let us not be your friend
[47:40] if we were taking quests there would be
[47:42] nobody here that will Mark the paper
[47:44] only God in heaven
[47:48] praise the Lord
[47:50] he will be called Jesus because
[47:53] he will save his people from their sin
[47:56] Jesus meaning Joshua
[48:00] Jehovah savior
[48:05] so that word that was forming Mary now
[48:09] was named Jesus
[48:14] are we together
[48:18] amen so he was born the word the word
[48:22] he was born the word because there's a
[48:26] promise that was hanging over him
[48:29] praise the Lord but for that word now to
[48:32] get in power
[48:35] for that word to for to to to fulfill
[48:39] what it was promised it needed to be
[48:42] anointed
[48:43] amen
[48:49] praise the Lord
[48:53] so Luke tells us there that when Jesus
[48:57] was baptized the heaven opened and uh
[49:01] and and and and the the the Holy Ghost
[49:03] descended in a bodily ship that's what
[49:08] brother Branham will warn us that you
[49:11] cannot make Jesus his own father
[49:15] The Mystery of the godhead
[49:19] praise the Lord
[49:21] is rightly placed in the scripture
[49:25] if you just go with one God as your one
[49:29] finger you will get the whole thing
[49:30] wrong
[49:31] right
[49:35] but because that one God
[49:39] took on flesh
[49:41] that one God has many forms of
[49:45] manifestation
[49:48] and the reason why I'm bringing it like
[49:51] this because just like Jesus had a word
[49:55] that brought him forth you had a word
[49:58] that brought you forth
[50:02] the word that brought Jesus forth had to
[50:06] be anointed for it to get in place and
[50:09] until the word that brings you forth is
[50:11] Anointed we will you will just play
[50:14] Church
[50:19] you would just play Church you were just
[50:21] play religion
[50:26] praise the Lord
[50:29] there was a word that brought him forth
[50:32] the Virgin shall conceive
[50:35] the star of Jacob the woman see we can
[50:38] go we can go on and on through the Old
[50:42] Testament we can we can we can pick it
[50:44] up year and day
[50:45] right
[50:50] are we together
[50:52] now you see that's the reason why he
[50:54] could bear the reproach
[50:58] he says for this cause I was born he
[51:01] could bear the reproach
[51:04] why because he identified the word on a
[51:08] wish he was born
[51:10] he identified the promise on the wish he
[51:13] was born
[51:16] are we together
[51:17] you will only be able to Bear the
[51:20] reproach of the world for your day
[51:23] if you are not just joining a church but
[51:26] you have identified the word
[51:31] praise the Lord
[51:33] are we together
[51:36] because there is a word that is bringing
[51:39] forth a bride
[51:40] just like the word brought for Christ
[51:43] the church cannot bring forth the bride
[51:47] amen the church can bring something that
[51:50] looks like the bride but the church
[51:53] cannot bring the bride so no matter what
[51:55] church you go
[51:58] praise the Lord
[52:00] no matter what church you go it can be
[52:02] called whatever name Genesis or Exodus
[52:05] and pillow of fire or whatever name you
[52:07] want to call it
[52:08] your church cannot bring for the bride
[52:13] believe in brother Branham asked the
[52:15] messenger of the age cannot bring forth
[52:17] the bride and we have to take the word
[52:24] the same way the word brought the
[52:27] bridegroom it would be the word that
[52:29] will bring the bride
[52:32] are we together
[52:33] are you seeing the picture
[52:36] praise the Lord
[52:38] that's the reason why you you you you
[52:40] you can you can put your religious
[52:42] strength to bed and bed and bed and bed
[52:48] but then it gets in a place where you
[52:50] throw in the towel I can bear this
[52:51] animal
[52:52] I'm tired
[52:55] the world never brought you forth
[52:59] if the word brings you forth it will
[53:01] keep you
[53:02] it will sustain you
[53:11] praise the Lord
[53:14] are we together
[53:16] are you seeing the picture
[53:18] can I preach now
[53:21] okay
[53:24] so
[53:26] yeah uh uh Luke is bringing it out in in
[53:31] in the the eyes of the Apostle year
[53:34] where he's he's making us to see that
[53:38] that word
[53:48] verse 37 he said that word I say ye no
[53:52] which was published throughout all Judea
[53:54] and and begin From Galilee after the
[53:58] baptism wish John preached
[54:01] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[54:06] the Holy Ghost the one that's hid this
[54:09] scripture
[54:11] they don't like it but it's truth and
[54:14] many wonders in the message don't like
[54:16] this scripture
[54:18] because the thing that you are taking
[54:20] something from Jesus when you read this
[54:22] scripture
[54:26] praise the Lord
[54:33] when you see if you don't if we don't
[54:35] understand our sonship because from the
[54:38] first Psalm that God brought forth from
[54:40] the beginning Genesis chapter one that's
[54:42] the way he's bringing for all his sons
[54:50] all his sons are coming by the word
[54:54] now you that's that's the reason why you
[54:56] can't take your sensation you can take
[54:58] your experience it has to be the word
[55:00] nothing but the word
[55:06] because you can have a vision today it
[55:08] is only for today
[55:10] and it might not sustain you
[55:15] praise the Lord
[55:17] the gifts are not over the word
[55:20] amen
[55:22] your experiences are now over the world
[55:30] are we together
[55:33] okay so let's let's travel now we see a
[55:36] little bit here we just wanted to build
[55:37] this picture see what brother Branham
[55:39] sharing before we go we've been playing
[55:41] this message that's our uh uh Sunday
[55:44] school tip message will be in plain who
[55:47] is this
[55:49] let's let's read this one
[55:52] listening to this now he says here
[56:00] now the difference between him who him
[56:03] Jesus
[56:05] amen
[56:07] the difference between
[56:09] Jesus as a son in you as a son
[56:16] the difference between Jesus as a Son of
[56:19] God and you as a son and daughter of God
[56:23] there is a difference that's why we want
[56:24] to see let's look at that difference he
[56:27] says see he was at the beginning
[56:31] their word
[56:34] amen
[56:35] but that beginning that he was at the
[56:38] word he was not called Jesus
[56:45] praise the Lord
[56:47] you were at the beginning
[56:51] in thought form
[56:55] you were in the mind of God
[56:58] never thought about you when you were
[57:01] born he thought about you from the
[57:02] foundation of the word
[57:06] are we together
[57:10] he was at the beginning the word in my
[57:13] feet a body
[57:16] he came in and lived in
[57:19] that
[57:21] in the person of
[57:24] Melchizedek
[57:26] are we together
[57:28] praise the Lord
[57:32] we never heard no more
[57:35] of my kisses because he became Jesus
[57:39] Christ but later on
[57:43] praise the Lord
[57:44] amen
[57:46] later on he took different forms
[57:51] Through the Ages
[57:53] that's the reason why the Bible says The
[57:56] Only Name giving among men
[58:00] so it was that were taking on human name
[58:06] The Only Name giving and more men
[58:09] whereby we are safe
[58:12] the only human name
[58:15] so the word took on a human name
[58:18] when he was called Jesus Christ
[58:22] are we together
[58:27] praise the Lord
[58:34] you were
[58:35] we were always there from the mind of
[58:38] God
[58:39] but it was when our mama was conceived
[58:44] with us that he started thinking on a
[58:46] name to call us
[58:50] amen
[58:52] your name was not before you you were
[58:54] before your name
[58:59] are you seeing the picture
[59:03] so that's the difference between him as
[59:06] his son and you as a son he says
[59:09] Melchizedek was that priest but he
[59:13] became Jesus Christ now you bypass that
[59:21] you bypass that but for for for for for
[59:25] Jesus Christ
[59:27] he descended he came from one form to
[59:31] another Pillar of Fire by Night pillar
[59:34] of cloud by day the angel that met Moses
[59:37] in a burning bush the captain of the
[59:39] Lord host that met Joshua he came from
[59:42] one form to another form until finally
[59:45] he took a human name
[59:48] but you bypass all of that
[59:51] amen
[59:52] praise the Lord you never came from one
[59:55] form God kept you for laodisha
[59:59] you are not in episode Church age
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:03] praise the Lord
[1:00:07] he kept you to express you in a time of
[1:00:10] our teachers so you bypass that
[1:00:15] but now with Jesus right from the mind
[1:00:18] in the beginning all things were made by
[1:00:21] him
[1:00:23] then he became the Tree of Life in the
[1:00:26] in the in the garden
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] then from there he took another form the
[1:00:32] seed of the woman honor a promise
[1:00:36] praise the Lord
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:40] and then he took another form with with
[1:00:43] uh with uh uh no one and then with
[1:00:46] Abraham and then uh with Moses and and
[1:00:49] you were just Discerning descending
[1:00:51] descending descending descending
[1:00:54] but we never came that way
[1:01:00] we were kept for this age
[1:01:03] for this period for this purpose we were
[1:01:06] born
[1:01:07] for this time time like this
[1:01:13] are we together
[1:01:16] so is God
[1:01:19] a point a word for this age now you will
[1:01:22] appreciate this when we when we look
[1:01:23] look at some few things here
[1:01:26] so he says now you bypass that because
[1:01:29] in their form he knew all things
[1:01:33] praise the Lord that's why Jesus could
[1:01:36] say before Abraham was I am
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:43] so when that word that talked all the
[1:01:47] different from got into a body system
[1:01:50] element that could be hungry that could
[1:01:52] sleep it still has the same quality
[1:01:58] of knowing the beginning
[1:02:03] are we together
[1:02:05] amen if we who have come that way we
[1:02:09] will just be the same
[1:02:17] because in their form he knew all things
[1:02:20] and you have never been able to know
[1:02:23] that yet
[1:02:24] you don't even know what's going to
[1:02:26] happen right after the service
[1:02:30] we want to know that his grace brought
[1:02:32] us here we enjoy the word and his grace
[1:02:34] will take us back home
[1:02:38] praise the Lord
[1:02:40] are we together
[1:02:42] are you getting the picture
[1:02:44] we are talking about sonship
[1:02:46] we are talking about the way God did
[1:02:48] with us
[1:02:52] when we when you understand that
[1:02:56] then nothing
[1:02:58] bother you so much you you get bothered
[1:03:00] but not so much
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:05] you are like Adam
[1:03:09] praise the Lord
[1:03:12] he says like Adam like me you became
[1:03:17] from the attribute toward the flesh to
[1:03:20] be tempted
[1:03:24] we will not express all true we came
[1:03:27] right from the thought
[1:03:29] directly to the flesh
[1:03:32] are we together
[1:03:34] now so just like Jesus
[1:03:37] I promise you that I want to be
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:45] message of an hour tonight
[1:03:49] just like Jesus came under a promised
[1:03:52] word the seed of the woman the start of
[1:03:55] Jacob Emmanuel God With Us in all of
[1:03:59] those promise we also came on a promise
[1:04:02] word
[1:04:05] praise the Lord
[1:04:07] so let me let me let me say like this uh
[1:04:09] ask chapter 15 let's go to Acts chapter
[1:04:11] 15.
[1:04:15] we uh we will use this verse
[1:04:20] to establish something
[1:04:31] now this was in the Jerusalem Council
[1:04:35] verse 13 let's read
[1:04:37] and after they have held their peace
[1:04:41] James answer saying men and brethrens
[1:04:44] yaking unto mean
[1:04:46] Simon Simon Peter has declared how God
[1:04:50] are the first did visit the Gentiles to
[1:04:55] take out of them a people
[1:04:59] for what
[1:05:01] praise the Lord
[1:05:03] I want for us to read that together amen
[1:05:09] Simon have declared how God are the
[1:05:12] first did visit the Gentiles to take out
[1:05:16] of them a people for his name
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] what what is the promise for the
[1:05:27] Gentiles
[1:05:29] a bearer of
[1:05:31] his name yeah
[1:05:35] praise the Lord
[1:05:38] our promise is to bear his name
[1:05:44] the reason why God
[1:05:48] will visit the Gentiles the reason why
[1:05:50] God
[1:05:52] will save us we that that were that were
[1:05:57] not in the Commonwealth of God uh
[1:05:59] alienated away from God uh the reason
[1:06:02] there is that we will be a bearer of his
[1:06:05] name now you if you go back to the
[1:06:07] scripture this is where this is the part
[1:06:09] that I love I'm telling you I'm telling
[1:06:11] you you enjoy it
[1:06:13] I love this part
[1:06:15] praise the Lord I love this part the
[1:06:19] reason why I love this
[1:06:21] is because
[1:06:26] everything that God will do
[1:06:30] in dealing with us the way he deal with
[1:06:33] us the reason why he protected us the
[1:06:35] reason why he provide for us
[1:06:38] is because of his name
[1:06:45] praise the Lord
[1:06:46] is because of his name then you go back
[1:06:50] and see that in the Ten Commandments
[1:06:54] they turned off the Ten Commandments
[1:06:58] God told the children of Israel
[1:07:01] do not take my name in vain
[1:07:06] praise the Lord that is more than just
[1:07:09] swearing
[1:07:10] that is here more than just Jesus that
[1:07:14] is more than that now so God is going to
[1:07:18] show how he treasure his name
[1:07:24] praise the Lord
[1:07:29] and if God treasure his name
[1:07:34] oh man he says it's getting beautiful I
[1:07:36] don't know if you're grabbing the
[1:07:37] picture but I'm beginning to see it
[1:07:41] and I love it
[1:07:43] I beginning to see it and and and and I
[1:07:46] appreciate it
[1:07:51] praise the Lord
[1:07:53] now you see how precious Redemption is
[1:07:56] to God
[1:08:01] because if God will give Israel his
[1:08:05] people all the laws and all the
[1:08:07] ordinance you know and build the entire
[1:08:10] picture Through the Ages with Israel and
[1:08:13] the Jews and you know he built all those
[1:08:15] pictures but for you and myself
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:22] that now he was he were coming and
[1:08:25] express his love to us
[1:08:31] just because of his name
[1:08:38] praise the Lord
[1:08:40] Hallelujah
[1:08:41] that's the best part of it
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:46] that is the best part of it because uh I
[1:08:49] mean uh other you sisters you you know
[1:08:52] well you know you you can uh uh you you
[1:08:55] have your daddy's name and then you get
[1:08:57] married you can change your name and
[1:08:58] even you young guys yeah yeah I mean if
[1:09:01] you don't like your daddy name it sounds
[1:09:03] like my own name you can you can change
[1:09:05] your name and look for some kind of
[1:09:06] offensive name
[1:09:08] praise the Lord
[1:09:09] but when a woman takes a man name
[1:09:13] in Maori you stop to it
[1:09:16] praise the Lord
[1:09:18] you don't have that right
[1:09:21] like you have before you get married
[1:09:24] to change your name
[1:09:26] I mean I mean even if a guy named sounds
[1:09:29] ugly only because I don't want that ugly
[1:09:31] name I really like the guy but I just
[1:09:33] didn't like the name my goodness
[1:09:36] I couldn't bear being caught
[1:09:40] foreign
[1:09:43] that one came from but
[1:09:48] as I would look for one one name that I
[1:09:52] can't even pronounce
[1:09:57] yes very interesting
[1:09:59] yeah it gets very very interesting and
[1:10:02] and that's word I want us to see that
[1:10:05] that is the promise that is hanging over
[1:10:09] us
[1:10:12] you see that is the reason why God had
[1:10:15] to bring us to this place to understand
[1:10:17] the mistrate of history for purpose
[1:10:24] praise the Lord that is the reason why a
[1:10:28] God has to restore the the the the the
[1:10:32] the the true form of baptism in the name
[1:10:35] of Jesus Christ
[1:10:40] because the promise that was hanging
[1:10:43] over uh the rest of the people of the
[1:10:46] word because it's the rest of the people
[1:10:48] of the world that were now born under
[1:10:51] the abrahamic Covenant the people the
[1:10:54] rest of the people of the world that was
[1:10:56] now born to the children of Jacob
[1:11:00] are called the Gentiles
[1:11:04] are we together
[1:11:05] amen we are all under that Gentile group
[1:11:11] amen Samaritans only comes in a picture
[1:11:14] because it's a gentile and Jew mix
[1:11:20] are we together
[1:11:23] praise the Lord so let's let's start to
[1:11:26] appreciate here that there's there's a
[1:11:28] lot of few scriptures here we could read
[1:11:30] but let's look at this one first Samuel
[1:11:33] chapter 12.
[1:11:37] first Samuel chapter 12 Jesus how the
[1:11:40] word hanging over him the Virgin shall
[1:11:42] conceive the start of Jacob the woman's
[1:11:45] seed he had that word that was the word
[1:11:47] that that brought him forth
[1:11:52] amen you also have a promise hanging
[1:11:56] over you
[1:11:59] you can play the church you can dress
[1:12:02] you can get the church dress code you
[1:12:05] can speak the language of the message
[1:12:06] you can do everything but if our life
[1:12:10] does not come up to the standard that we
[1:12:12] are living for his namesake
[1:12:16] and whatever we are doing we are doing
[1:12:19] it for his namesake now for the church
[1:12:21] namesake
[1:12:23] now for the message namesake
[1:12:25] before his namesake
[1:12:28] because that is the promised word that
[1:12:31] will bring forth the bride
[1:12:39] so you can dress the message you can
[1:12:41] drink the message you can sleep the
[1:12:43] message
[1:12:46] that's the reason why you cannot replace
[1:12:48] his name with the prophet name
[1:12:57] that's the promise that will bring
[1:12:59] that's the promise that will bring the
[1:13:02] bride
[1:13:03] that is the promise that God will
[1:13:06] Quicken in this hour
[1:13:12] that's why Paul would say let everything
[1:13:15] that name the name of Christ depart from
[1:13:17] sin
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:27] are we together first Samuel chapter 12
[1:13:28] that's what I said I think I'm doing
[1:13:31] good here
[1:13:33] and I will also not be I would not
[1:13:36] struggle to confess if I pass the time
[1:13:50] first Samuel chapter 12
[1:13:53] . let's read from verse 20 listening to
[1:13:55] this this beautiful beautiful
[1:14:00] part of the scripture that says that's
[1:14:02] what I love I I enjoy that tonight amen
[1:14:06] I don't know about you but I'm just
[1:14:07] having a good mighty good time
[1:14:15] I'm just having a matter of good time
[1:14:20] first Samuel chapter 12.
[1:14:28] oh I'm in second Sammy sorry
[1:14:32] I'm in second son boy it's first Samuel
[1:14:35] don't go to Second it's first Samuel I'm
[1:14:37] in second time I'm at the wrong place
[1:14:44] you stayed in first Samuel
[1:14:46] chapter 12.
[1:14:48] let's read from verse 20.
[1:14:52] and then just follow the reading there
[1:14:54] and see how beautiful and Samuel said
[1:14:57] unto the people fear not
[1:15:00] you have done all this wickedness
[1:15:04] yeah turn that aside from following the
[1:15:08] Lord
[1:15:09] but serve the Lord with all your heart
[1:15:14] and turn your net aside
[1:15:17] foreign things
[1:15:21] which cannot profit non-deliver
[1:15:24] for they have been
[1:15:27] for the Lord will not forsake his people
[1:15:32] for his what
[1:15:35] praise the Lord oh I want you to yell
[1:15:38] that amen because that's your promise
[1:15:41] you better start loving it
[1:15:43] you better start loving it and start
[1:15:46] putting it on your lip I cannot do this
[1:15:48] for God namesake
[1:15:52] praise the Lord
[1:15:55] for the Lord will now forsake his people
[1:15:59] for what
[1:16:00] his great name's sake
[1:16:03] because
[1:16:08] it have pleased the Lord to make you his
[1:16:11] people
[1:16:16] the only reason why yeah see see what
[1:16:20] the way Samia said you have done all
[1:16:21] this wickedness but let me warn you
[1:16:24] there's a secret behind it
[1:16:27] fear the lord
[1:16:30] fear the lord
[1:16:34] because there is one reason why
[1:16:37] God will not flush you down the drain
[1:16:42] because he has attached his name to you
[1:16:48] for his name's sake
[1:16:58] praise the Lord
[1:17:00] are we together
[1:17:03] let's look at Psalm 106. I just took few
[1:17:06] scriptures tonight because
[1:17:09] I wanted to stay in an hour
[1:17:13] psalm 106.
[1:17:20] so we don't have anything to do with
[1:17:23] your natural birth they don't have
[1:17:24] anything to do with one family you are
[1:17:26] born in you don't have anything to do
[1:17:28] what tribe what nation you are from
[1:17:32] they don't have anything to do with you
[1:17:36] if God will achieve anything in your
[1:17:38] life it's not because of what you have
[1:17:40] done
[1:17:50] so when you think you are better than
[1:17:52] other people
[1:17:53] then you better be careful
[1:17:59] are we together
[1:18:01] Psalm 106
[1:18:03] let's read
[1:18:04] verse seven now brother Branham will use
[1:18:08] this that's the very scripture where he
[1:18:10] used to preach the message God being
[1:18:13] misunderstood
[1:18:15] and what brother Branham was bringing
[1:18:17] out of that message is that we all
[1:18:21] misunderstand God
[1:18:24] just like the children of Israel
[1:18:26] misunderstood God
[1:18:29] praise the Lord
[1:18:32] we think it's about church
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:37] we think it's about us
[1:18:42] when it's not because of us
[1:18:47] praise the Lord
[1:18:50] when it's not because of us you think
[1:18:52] about it
[1:18:53] Akon stole the Babylonian government and
[1:18:56] God says get rid of him his entire house
[1:18:58] now if God would have done that
[1:19:02] to my great-grandfather that smoked a
[1:19:04] pipe I will not be here
[1:19:07] just get rid of him the entire group
[1:19:10] that comes from there get rid of them
[1:19:14] if you have done it to Adam he would
[1:19:16] just close the book go back and be an
[1:19:18] eternal spirit
[1:19:24] are we together
[1:19:25] so brother Branham is I read this in in
[1:19:30] in in teaching the message God Be
[1:19:32] Misunderstood let's let's go ahead there
[1:19:34] verse 7.
[1:19:42] our father on us to Matt
[1:19:46] that wanders in Egypt
[1:19:50] we also don't understand God grace to us
[1:19:54] amen we think God grace is our good diet
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:02] praise the Lord
[1:20:07] Our Father understood that wonders in
[1:20:11] Egypt they remember that the multitude
[1:20:14] of thy mercy
[1:20:16] but provoke him are the sea even at the
[1:20:20] Red Sea but it still did not stop God he
[1:20:25] opened the sea
[1:20:26] and still allow those people that
[1:20:28] provoking to us to walk on the very seat
[1:20:36] are we together
[1:20:40] nevertheless
[1:20:42] he saved them for
[1:20:48] he saved them for
[1:20:53] sounding a little better
[1:20:56] praise the Lord
[1:20:58] he saved them for
[1:21:01] his name's sake
[1:21:03] that he might make
[1:21:07] his mighty power to be known
[1:21:12] praise the Lord
[1:21:14] amen now so you see when brother Branham
[1:21:18] said
[1:21:18] Moses gave God a better idea no if you
[1:21:23] want to really look at it Moses pick it
[1:21:26] up and God was pleased with it when
[1:21:29] Moses said what will the nation say
[1:21:31] about you God says that's exactly what I
[1:21:34] was thinking about
[1:21:35] he pick up the thoughts of God and it
[1:21:38] pleased God
[1:21:41] because everything that God was doing
[1:21:43] was for his name's sake
[1:21:52] oh I'm feeling mighty good amen
[1:21:54] I will go to bed tonight and I would
[1:21:57] just have a good sleep
[1:21:59] because for his name's sake he will
[1:22:01] watch over me
[1:22:03] he gave his beloved sleep for his
[1:22:05] namesake
[1:22:08] you will give me another day tomorrow
[1:22:10] for his namesake
[1:22:13] and that's the reason why we are
[1:22:15] conscious of what we do
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:19] we are conscious if it is not going to
[1:22:21] bring glory to his name don't do it
[1:22:25] because he spared your life for his
[1:22:27] namesake
[1:22:29] and why should you why should you
[1:22:32] live and pollute the name of God
[1:22:37] you'll be taking the name of God in vain
[1:22:44] the Bible says Thou shalt not take the
[1:22:46] name they didn't
[1:22:47] I shall not say the name
[1:22:50] thou shall not take the name when God
[1:22:55] placed his name upon you don't walk
[1:22:57] about it in vain places
[1:23:01] right
[1:23:11] nevertheless he saved him for his name's
[1:23:14] sake
[1:23:16] he saved us by grace for his name's sake
[1:23:19] because he said he will get a people
[1:23:21] from the Gentiles
[1:23:23] praise the Lord
[1:23:25] and that's the reason why we are
[1:23:27] baptized in his name that's the reason
[1:23:29] why whatever we do in words are these we
[1:23:33] do it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:35] Christ
[1:23:43] you love the Lord tonight let's look at
[1:23:45] Jeremiah chapter 14.
[1:23:54] Jeremiah chapter 14.
[1:24:15] if you are looking at the time it says
[1:24:17] brother one will not really make it
[1:24:20] praise the Lord
[1:24:22] you are right I will not really make it
[1:24:28] praise the Lord
[1:24:33] uh let's let's just take Jeremiah having
[1:24:36] two two other scriptures here
[1:24:38] the last one
[1:24:40] is very
[1:24:42] is very very good so I will not just
[1:24:45] close the Bible
[1:24:46] but let's look at Jeremiah chapter 14.
[1:24:53] Jeremiah chapter 14 look at verse 7. Oh
[1:24:57] Lord
[1:24:58] though our iniquity testified against us
[1:25:02] do thou aid for thy name's sake
[1:25:06] for our backslidings and many
[1:25:10] we have sinned it against thee
[1:25:13] praise the Lord
[1:25:15] Ezekiel chapter 20.
[1:25:19] Ezekiel chapter
[1:25:22] 20.
[1:25:29] praise the Lord
[1:25:33] are we together
[1:25:38] you've seen the picture
[1:25:41] praise the Lord
[1:25:45] because if if you you get to the place
[1:25:48] in in and you you grab that
[1:25:51] understanding
[1:25:53] and and see what what is what is there
[1:25:57] that is is the word
[1:26:00] you know God is bringing forth
[1:26:04] his word now in Ezekiel chapter 20
[1:26:07] that's what I said
[1:26:12] is that what I said
[1:26:14] yes let's read from verse 5.
[1:26:24] Ezekiel chapter 20.
[1:26:28] reading from verse 5.
[1:26:32] and said unto them thus said the Lord
[1:26:34] God in the days
[1:26:37] when I choose Israel and lifted up my
[1:26:41] hand onto the seed of the House of Jacob
[1:26:45] and made myself known unto them in the
[1:26:48] land of Egypt so he's going back now in
[1:26:51] the land of Egypt just like David said
[1:26:54] they never understood when God was doing
[1:26:57] all of those things turning the water
[1:26:59] into blood you know all of that they
[1:27:01] never understood it
[1:27:03] praise the Lord they just thought that
[1:27:06] Moses was trying to make something of
[1:27:07] himself
[1:27:10] but God was doing all of that to live
[1:27:13] her lift up his name before the
[1:27:15] Egyptians
[1:27:19] that you cannot compare me with the god
[1:27:22] of Egypt
[1:27:24] God was lifting up his name
[1:27:30] and the journey all they were thinking
[1:27:32] is that this this Moses he shouldn't
[1:27:34] play with us this time the first time he
[1:27:36] did it he ran away
[1:27:39] he must not try this time we ourselves
[1:27:41] would grab him and kill him
[1:27:43] yeah
[1:27:46] praise the Lord
[1:27:53] and I wanna
[1:27:55] if many times we don't misunderstand the
[1:27:58] things that God is doing
[1:28:03] why he allows certain things
[1:28:08] praise the Lord
[1:28:10] so he go he's going right back there to
[1:28:12] the house of Jacob in Egypt when I
[1:28:15] lifted up my hands unto them saying I am
[1:28:17] the Lord your God verse six in the day
[1:28:20] that I lifted up my hands unto them to
[1:28:23] bring them forth of the land of Egypt
[1:28:26] into a land that
[1:28:28] that I had
[1:28:31] aspired for them flooring with milk and
[1:28:33] honey which is the glory of all Lanes
[1:28:38] then say I don't to them cast yet away
[1:28:41] every man the abomination of his eyes
[1:28:45] and Define that thyself with the idol
[1:28:48] Idols of Egypt
[1:28:50] I am the Lord your God
[1:28:53] but they rebelled against me
[1:28:56] and will not hacking unto me
[1:28:59] they did not
[1:29:02] Every Man cast away their Abominations
[1:29:06] of the eyes
[1:29:08] amen why because those idols took a hold
[1:29:12] of their heart
[1:29:15] that's why they kept looking back to
[1:29:16] Egypt
[1:29:18] they might not have it in their back
[1:29:21] maybe when they came across the Red Sea
[1:29:23] some of them make effort yeah yeah
[1:29:25] that's true we are gone they throw it in
[1:29:27] the sea but it will stay in their heart
[1:29:41] but they Rebellion against me verse 8
[1:29:44] and will not take it unto me they did
[1:29:47] not every man Cast Away the abomination
[1:29:50] of their eyes neither did they forsake
[1:29:52] the idols of Egypt then I said I will
[1:29:55] pour out my forehead upon them
[1:29:58] to accomplish my anger against him
[1:30:01] in the midst of the land of Egypt
[1:30:04] but
[1:30:05] I wrote for my namesake
[1:30:08] praise the Lord
[1:30:10] that I should not be polluted before
[1:30:16] so you see this now explain that
[1:30:19] conversation
[1:30:22] of Moses
[1:30:25] amen God said for my name's sake
[1:30:29] I will have there with them I would have
[1:30:31] wept them up before my namesake
[1:30:34] right because
[1:30:36] I will not pollute my name
[1:30:39] before the headings
[1:30:42] and that's exactly what Moses was saying
[1:30:45] what would the nation say about you
[1:30:48] if you do this
[1:30:50] praise the Lord do you think that Moses
[1:30:53] could suggests a better idea when God
[1:30:55] cannot learn
[1:30:58] but he just pick up the mind of God
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:03] and it pleased God
[1:31:10] so you just think about it Moses just
[1:31:12] caught a shadow of it
[1:31:15] when he said that it was just a
[1:31:17] revelation it was an inspiration just a
[1:31:20] shadow
[1:31:21] right
[1:31:29] for time there are many a lot of verses
[1:31:32] down here we who have read God repeated
[1:31:34] that over and over you you just take the
[1:31:36] time to read chapter 20 you will see how
[1:31:39] he repeated that over I was going to do
[1:31:41] this to them
[1:31:42] but for my namesake
[1:31:46] they came they complained I was going to
[1:31:48] do it but for my namesake
[1:31:53] Ezekiel chapter 36 let's take this last
[1:31:55] one and then we will close and go to the
[1:31:58] Lord in prayer tonight
[1:32:02] but bam said just like
[1:32:06] the the the star that Moses had before
[1:32:09] pharaoh
[1:32:10] he says that's how the name of Jesus is
[1:32:13] in the church
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:16] where two are three two or three I
[1:32:19] gather in my name he says I will be
[1:32:21] there
[1:32:23] praise the Lord
[1:32:25] Hallelujah
[1:32:27] he keeps it his appointment because we
[1:32:29] are coming together in his name
[1:32:32] we are not coming together just to
[1:32:34] please ourselves we are coming together
[1:32:36] in his name
[1:32:42] Ezekiel chapter 36 let's read from verse
[1:32:45] 16. it's it's a counter for lengthy
[1:32:48] reading but let me give you the picture
[1:32:51] this word you will find a scripture when
[1:32:55] God says that the a new heart and a new
[1:32:58] spirit
[1:32:59] where I give you
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] I will take away the Stony heart
[1:33:07] and I would put my spirit now the reason
[1:33:10] why he's doing it
[1:33:12] that's what he will explain you I'm
[1:33:14] doing that because for my namesake
[1:33:19] because I want my name to be reflected
[1:33:22] through your life that's why I will give
[1:33:23] you the Holy Ghost I'm not giving you
[1:33:25] the Holy Ghost because you fast and
[1:33:27] prayed
[1:33:31] praise the Lord
[1:33:34] is because I want my name
[1:33:37] that's the reason why I'm going to take
[1:33:39] your selfish nature
[1:33:42] I'm going to take that stubborn spirit
[1:33:45] because I want you to be a vessel that I
[1:33:48] can reflect my name through
[1:33:57] so you see the church word put it on
[1:33:59] because we fast and pray that's why the
[1:34:01] Revival came
[1:34:03] because we we lay down before the Lord
[1:34:07] and that's the reason why it don't last
[1:34:10] because when we do it it has an aspiring
[1:34:14] date to it
[1:34:18] but when God comes behind it and do it
[1:34:21] for his namesake
[1:34:23] and we identify that is because of his
[1:34:26] name
[1:34:28] then it humble us
[1:34:30] we don't take no Pride we don't take no
[1:34:33] praise
[1:34:35] we walk humble before the Lord
[1:34:39] we say like Mary be it unto me
[1:34:43] according to that word
[1:34:49] that God will look my way
[1:34:54] praise the Lord
[1:34:55] that God will take a a a a a lust for
[1:35:00] demons or a a stubborn habit away from
[1:35:03] me
[1:35:04] but sometimes people cherish their own
[1:35:07] nature
[1:35:09] praise the Lord
[1:35:15] it's almost like a blind man regretting
[1:35:17] wow
[1:35:18] yeah I mean
[1:35:21] I regret that God gave me sight
[1:35:25] praise the Lord
[1:35:27] sometimes that's the way we behave
[1:35:32] because we wish that we will stay in
[1:35:34] those All Flesh and those all nature
[1:35:38] we do everything to revive it we we look
[1:35:40] for every little occasion
[1:35:43] to revive it
[1:35:49] so that's that's the background of of uh
[1:35:52] of Ezekiel 36 year verse 16. will raise
[1:35:57] moreover thou son of man
[1:36:01] take the one stick and write upon it for
[1:36:04] Judah and for the and for the children
[1:36:06] of Israel
[1:36:10] His companion then take another stake
[1:36:13] now he's going to he's going to do all
[1:36:15] of this and and you see that he's
[1:36:16] addressing it to the house of Israel
[1:36:18] he's addressing it to the the sons of
[1:36:21] Jacob
[1:36:27] are we together
[1:36:32] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:36:37] the mighty run into it I mean uh and
[1:36:40] they are safe amen
[1:36:51] so when you understand that
[1:36:53] that that is the promise
[1:36:56] that is hanging over your life a people
[1:36:59] that will be the bearer of his name
[1:37:03] now brother Branham says something in uh
[1:37:06] in the message uh by faith Moses
[1:37:09] he says there are a lot of people
[1:37:11] that
[1:37:14] that build their own persecution
[1:37:18] sure they try to be fanatic for the word
[1:37:22] they try to misrepresent the word and
[1:37:25] say they are persecuting me
[1:37:28] he says if you if you put yourself in
[1:37:31] that place you will bear your own
[1:37:32] persecution
[1:37:37] praise the Lord
[1:37:39] and now that is the place also where it
[1:37:42] brings an understanding
[1:37:44] if you are persecuted for the word for
[1:37:47] sake
[1:37:50] then you will rejoice
[1:37:52] if you are complaining about it then you
[1:37:55] have to check what is the word or you
[1:37:57] have built it
[1:38:04] praise the Lord
[1:38:13] so like the prophet of God said yeah
[1:38:16] Jesus reproached for the word we can
[1:38:18] also say the bride reproach for the word
[1:38:27] we are we are reproached by scaffolds
[1:38:30] people that misunderstand why we live
[1:38:33] the way we live while we we dress the
[1:38:35] way we dress the things that we do
[1:38:38] amen
[1:38:42] praise the Lord
[1:38:45] even the demons the devils are also uh
[1:38:48] uh uh uh the the misunderstanders they
[1:38:52] wanna why can't we give up
[1:38:57] no we can because
[1:39:00] this body was redeemed
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:05] he was baptized in Jesus name
[1:39:08] after after he has repented for all of
[1:39:12] his wrong law forgave him baptized in
[1:39:14] Jesus name and moreover God comes and
[1:39:17] and give you the Holy Ghost to empower
[1:39:20] you
[1:39:23] to be able to bear his name
[1:39:28] praise the Lord
[1:39:31] so you see the picture
[1:39:39] that's why we can bear his reproach
[1:39:42] musicians can come you can read the rest
[1:39:44] of the scriptures home and uh because as
[1:39:48] as we read things come up and then I
[1:39:51] want to emphasize and time is going so
[1:39:54] uh let's just let's just use this time
[1:39:59] and just meditate on what what what was
[1:40:02] ministered to us tonight
[1:40:04] praise the Lord
[1:40:06] let's just use this time
[1:40:08] while we sit and uh
[1:40:11] uh and just and just try to bring
[1:40:14] everything together tonight and and
[1:40:16] think about it as we go to the Lord in
[1:40:19] prayer
[1:40:29] let's just sing that song the name of
[1:40:32] the Lord is a strong towel but let us
[1:40:34] not let's not sing it as a praise song
[1:40:38] Let's just sing it as a worship song
[1:40:40] while we think think about it amen the
[1:40:43] Lord Has Lifted his name above us
[1:40:45] the name of the
[1:40:48] Lord is
[1:40:53] a strong time

[1:43:54] long host what a musician plays softly
[1:43:58] now just listen to this
[1:44:00] I was reading from the wrong verse elim
[1:44:02] moreover the word of the Lord
[1:44:05] came unto me saying son of man
[1:44:08] when the house of Israel during their
[1:44:11] own land they defied it
[1:44:13] by their own ways and by their doing
[1:44:17] their ways was before me as the
[1:44:20] uncleanness
[1:44:22] of a removed woman
[1:44:25] therefore our poor my forehead upon them
[1:44:28] for the blood that they have shared upon
[1:44:32] the land and fall their Idols where we
[1:44:35] they have polluted
[1:44:37] and I scattered them Among The Hidden
[1:44:41] and they were dispersed through the
[1:44:43] countries are calling to their ways and
[1:44:46] according to their doing I judged him
[1:44:50] and when they enter onto the headings
[1:44:53] whether they went they Pro free my holy
[1:44:56] name
[1:44:57] when they said to them Thou Art the
[1:45:01] people of the Lord and are gone forth
[1:45:04] out of his land
[1:45:05] but
[1:45:07] I have pity for my name
[1:45:10] I have pity
[1:45:12] for mining
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:16] if God would deal with us
[1:45:20] but our iniquity
[1:45:25] there's no way we can stand before him
[1:45:29] but I have pity for my holy name
[1:45:32] which the house of Israel had profined
[1:45:34] among the healings
[1:45:35] whether they went therefore said unto
[1:45:39] the house of Israel tell them they'll
[1:45:41] say the Lord I do not this for your sake
[1:45:45] o House of Israel but for my holy
[1:45:48] namesake
[1:45:49] which year have profaned among the
[1:45:52] headings where you went
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:55] and I will sanctify my great name
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:45:59] which was profound among the healings
[1:46:01] which year have profaned in the midst of
[1:46:04] them and the hidden shall know that I am
[1:46:08] the Lord
[1:46:09] when they see you the very person that
[1:46:12] was living in Dumb and dirt
[1:46:14] when I sanctify my name
[1:46:17] and now you are living a decent life the
[1:46:19] hidden will say there is a living God
[1:46:22] because I know that man he used to be a
[1:46:24] wicked one I know that woman she used to
[1:46:26] live a wrong life
[1:46:28] but when I take you and I sanctify my
[1:46:30] name in you the healings will know that
[1:46:32] there is a living God
[1:46:35] oh I love this
[1:46:39] the hidden shall know that I am the law
[1:46:41] said I am the Lord said the Lord when I
[1:46:45] shall sanctify you before their eyes
[1:46:48] for I will take you from among the
[1:46:51] heathens I will gather you
[1:46:53] out of all the countries out of all the
[1:46:56] denominations out of all the churches I
[1:46:59] will bring you

[1:47:04] clean water upon you

[1:47:51] church Creed I will put my spirit in you
[1:47:56] to cause you to walk in my status and
[1:47:59] you shall keep my judgment and do them
[1:48:03] in Asia dwell in the land that I give
