[16:19] and here comes this minivan pulls up in
[16:22] the parking lot
[16:23] and it's a lady she lives in the linwood
[16:24] apartments and she
[16:26] had rolled down her passenger in there
[16:28] and she said sir sir can i talk to you
[16:30] and said she want to know what we
[16:33] believe i said well we believe that the
[16:34] lord jesus christ is our lord and savior
[16:37] she says that's good enough for me
[16:40] she's been looking for a church and so i
[16:42] just want to
[16:43] make her make a prayer burden but you

[41:31] when you get sick and you experience
[41:34] god's healing
[41:35] it shows that there is a lame where

[42:10] hell is also the dimension he told us
[42:13] that hell
[42:14] is now on earth you find that's the
[42:16] reason why the people
[42:17] they always they have that language man
[42:19] if he likes hell
[42:21] amen when people are going through
[42:23] struggle or
[42:24] suffering you know why it's so hell i
[42:27] mean it's
[42:28] it's it's it's a dimension it's a word
[42:31] praise alone and if the word going
[42:34] through their trials and their
[42:37] difficulties
[42:38] can stop feeling hell on them the
[42:40] believer must
[42:41] also be feeling heaven in their soul
[42:44] amen no matter what we go through

[43:12] that's that's that's the earnest the
[43:15] earnest
[43:16] of our inheritance praise the lord
[43:20] amen god bless you you may have your
[43:22] seat because i've already started

[43:26] now amen
[43:28] praise the lord you know we were
[43:30] fellowshipping yesterday
[43:31] and i was telling but one that says
[43:33] there is one benefit that we have
[43:35] of this message the son of man ministry
[43:38] brought
[43:38] us one unique benefit they had that that
[43:41] were that were they were really
[43:43] experienced during the ages
[43:45] we know that paul he went to the tear
[43:48] heaven
[43:48] we know that that philip he was picked
[43:51] up by the holy spirit he was transported
[43:53] to meet the eunuch on on under on the
[43:56] river that was traveling away from
[43:57] jerusalem
[43:58] so you see in the sort of ministry you
[44:01] see brother branham
[44:03] traveling into people life he i mean he
[44:06] he will he would discern people he says
[44:08] i'm just waiting on that one he says
[44:10] okay
[44:10] i see you when you were four years old
[44:12] this is what happened to you
[44:14] now so the son of man ministry has
[44:16] brought us this
[44:17] unique benefit to transport us
[44:22] to transport us back to bible days
[44:28] praise the lord amen to transport us
[44:32] brother branham
[44:33] a question and answer on genesis he says
[44:36] well
[44:36] let me take you to the banister of time
[44:39] let's hang over the banister of time
[44:41] let's
[44:41] look at the galaxies let's start to see
[44:44] the things that god did before they were
[44:46] there the earth ever came to be what was
[44:49] he doing
[44:50] he was transporting us
[44:54] praise the lord that is
[44:58] the benefit of the son of man ministry
[45:03] that is the reason why when the holy
[45:05] ghost starts dealing with you
[45:07] you can be able you you can be
[45:09] transported to some of your past and
[45:11] transported to some things in your life
[45:13] that you did not understand
[45:15] and you say oh i see why
[45:21] praise the lord you know when you start
[45:23] experiencing that you know what is
[45:25] happening to you
[45:26] you are growing wings and one of these
[45:28] days you fly out of here
[45:32] praise the lord when you start when you
[45:35] start looking back into the past and
[45:37] looking into things that god been doing
[45:39] in your life
[45:40] he says oh i see why oh praise the lord
[45:42] your wings are growing just keep
[45:44] stretching them
[45:45] one of these days you're going to fly
[45:46] out of here praise the lord
[45:49] it's a unique benefit that the son of
[45:51] man ministry has brought us
[45:53] is to transport us praise the lord
[45:57] we want to thank the lord and so
[46:00] grateful
[46:01] we're having few prayer requests this
[46:03] morning we will now want to
[46:05] jump over them but wesley calling
[46:09] this morning sister carol was
[46:13] troubled a little bit a little bit with
[46:15] her blood pressure so they couldn't be
[46:16] with us
[46:18] and they wanted us to pray and
[46:21] remember them in prayer and
[46:25] also continue to remember
[46:29] the adult or sarah in prayer as well
[46:33] and i believe they will also appreciate
[46:36] the prayer for candy as well
[46:38] we will remember them the alice had to
[46:42] uh pack out of their house yesterday
[46:46] so uh i think that's the reason why they
[46:49] are now with us
[46:51] so they also asked for our prayers
[46:55] brother john bibi in his household
[46:58] having an unspoken prayer request
[47:02] they want us to remember them in prayer
[47:05] so they are now with us
[47:06] as well
[47:11] we would just remember these different
[47:14] families trying to see if i'm not
[47:18] missing a prayer request here
[47:21] and i think brothers brother scott said
[47:24] it all with that experience
[47:26] of that young lady this morning
[47:30] and and i i just believe that
[47:33] we have to realize church that
[47:37] we just we just did uh 25 years
[47:41] anniversary and i would like to say this
[47:45] you know a church
[47:48] it takes a while before sometimes and
[47:51] many times
[47:52] the people really grab the vision of the
[47:55] church
[47:56] the church is not the building it's not
[47:59] because we just come here and we meet
[48:02] you
[48:02] it is now also because we believe the
[48:05] message it's true
[48:06] we believe the message we believe jesus
[48:08] christ as our lord and savior
[48:10] but you see when god called the people
[48:12] together he gives them
[48:14] a vision and their vision becomes their
[48:17] burden
[48:18] that's the reason why the prophet says i
[48:21] mean
[48:21] solomon said we are vision the people
[48:23] perish because
[48:24] if the people don't have a vision they
[48:26] don't have what to live up for
[48:29] and in that way they can just go in
[48:32] come out you know i mean they can just
[48:35] treat church
[48:36] like like anything
[48:39] but when the people have a vision when
[48:42] the people
[48:42] actually understand why we are
[48:46] on 900
[48:49] a humble avenue while we are on the
[48:52] corner of this street
[48:56] why god put us on the corner of the
[49:00] street
[49:09] if we really understand it i mean we
[49:12] will not have to be
[49:13] chasing people to come to church we will
[49:15] not have to be
[49:17] you know uh uh i mean looking forward to
[49:20] do this and looking for what to do there
[49:23] i mean everybody will get involved
[49:27] when the people really grab the vision
[49:30] of the church and sometimes it takes a
[49:32] long time
[49:34] it takes a long time
[49:37] but i believe we are heading in that
[49:39] [Music]
[49:42] direction
[49:45] and when it comes to that place word
[49:50] god gave us a baptism as a church
[49:54] where he gave us a baptism
[49:58] and and and unite us together
[50:01] i mean it would be so easy to preach it
[50:04] would be so easy to sing a song because
[50:07] the people already know where we are
[50:10] heading
[50:12] the pastor will not have to preach
[50:14] something and somebody get
[50:16] get ugly about it if they get ugly about
[50:19] it
[50:20] they just know that they get a wrong
[50:21] spirit on them
[50:26] praise the lord
[50:38] you know that's the reason why you know
[50:40] brother branham
[50:42] in the church order
[50:45] you know they are pre that there are
[50:46] purpose habits you come on the poopy you
[50:48] start looking for different things to do
[50:50] i hope this jail don't become my poopy
[50:52] habit amen
[50:53] praise the lord because i stopped
[50:55] pouring it on my hand
[51:00] amen and oh yeah
[51:08] yeah sister real yeah i think that's one
[51:11] of the prayer requests that was on my
[51:12] mind sister real
[51:14] brother jairo's wife she having an egg
[51:16] on her leg
[51:17] spoke with her yesterday and uh
[51:20] [Music]
[51:21] strange pain of burning uh you know
[51:24] pains and
[51:25] she did an x-ray and the doctors
[51:27] couldn't see anything
[51:29] so uh and it's so painful so she want us
[51:32] to
[51:33] to remember her in prayer you know so
[51:36] we put on on the prayer list this
[51:38] morning and we
[51:39] as we go to the lord in prayer now so
[51:41] you see
[51:42] uh i mean that's that's i i mean i
[51:45] believe that we're healing in that
[51:46] direction
[51:47] you know and uh i just i just pray like
[51:51] i said
[51:52] if god give us a baptism as a church
[51:55] you know we can have our individual
[51:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[51:59] but we need a baptism of a church you
[52:02] know
[52:02] i believe all those disciples 120 in the
[52:06] upper room they all had their different
[52:08] experiences of christ
[52:09] but when they were gathered in the ho in
[52:11] the in the upper room
[52:12] god initiated them together as the birth
[52:16] of the first church
[52:19] yes
[52:23] in the house of calendars he did the
[52:25] same thing again
[52:26] he could have met them in their rooms he
[52:28] could have met them in different places
[52:30] but he decided to to just initiate the
[52:34] first
[52:34] gentile group together
[52:41] praise the lord
[52:44] oh i'm i'm looking forward to that one
[52:46] of these days the holy ghost come and
[52:48] sweep through this building you shouting
[52:50] streaming over your words and don't even
[52:52] know what is happening you can't
[52:53] fake it because you fake it you'll feel
[52:56] so bad
[52:57] because you will know that it is not
[52:58] real but when the holy ghost get ahold
[53:01] of you
[53:02] and you can control yourself a
[53:05] humble you praise the lord
[53:08] because after you finish shouting glory
[53:11] to god
[53:12] when you come to yourself you just sit
[53:14] down quietly
[53:16] but when you fake it you will feel so
[53:18] bad because your inner man will tell you
[53:21] you were faking it
[53:27] praise the lord as we as we go i begin
[53:30] this uh
[53:31] a month of uh august
[53:34] this evening we will come together for

[1:05:24] have lost its silver
[1:05:27] wherewith shall it be salted
[1:05:30] it is henceforth good for nothing
[1:05:34] but to be cast out and
[1:05:38] to be trodden on the fault of
[1:05:41] man ye are the light of the world
[1:05:45] a city that is set on a hill cannot
[1:05:50] behave
[1:05:51] ye are the light of the world and you
[1:05:54] are
[1:05:54] also a city that is set on the hill
[1:05:59] remember now we've been talking about
[1:06:00] what is your attraction
[1:06:02] on your mountain or what is the
[1:06:04] attraction on your mountain
[1:06:06] so here jesus christ is stopping you as
[1:06:09] a city and he's putting you on the hill
[1:06:12] you are just like
[1:06:13] the new jerusalem that's what he's
[1:06:15] trying to is he's saying here you are a
[1:06:17] city
[1:06:18] that is on the hill praise the lord yeah
[1:06:21] the light of the world the city
[1:06:23] that is set on the hill cannot be
[1:06:26] hid neither do man light a candle
[1:06:30] and put it under the bush shell but on
[1:06:35] a candlestick and it gave a light unto
[1:06:38] all that are in the house
[1:06:43] let your light so shine before men
[1:06:46] that they may see your good works
[1:06:49] and glorify your father which is in
[1:06:52] heaven
[1:06:53] revelation chapter 21.
[1:07:08] can you remember we've been we've been
[1:07:09] encouraging ourselves
[1:07:11] that god has given us a lot of
[1:07:13] experiences from the day
[1:07:15] we came from our mother woman even
[1:07:17] coming forth from our mother woman was
[1:07:19] our first
[1:07:20] experience you know whether we were
[1:07:22] crying or whether we were shouting for
[1:07:24] joy but there was a noise when we came
[1:07:26] out
[1:07:27] and and as we grow and go along we had
[1:07:30] different different experiences and all
[1:07:33] of those things
[1:07:35] is a type of the mountains around about
[1:07:38] jerusalem because those are the very
[1:07:40] things that god
[1:07:41] will use throughout our life journey to
[1:07:44] be able to draw us
[1:07:46] to him praise the lord
[1:07:49] revelation chapter 21 and i saw
[1:07:52] a new heaven and a new earth
[1:07:56] and the first heaven and the first f
[1:07:59] will pass away and there was
[1:08:02] no more seed and i john saw the holy
[1:08:06] city
[1:08:07] new jerusalem coming down from god
[1:08:10] out of heaven prepared
[1:08:14] as a bride a door for
[1:08:17] her husband a new jerusalem coming down
[1:08:21] prepared as a bride remember in john
[1:08:24] chapter 14
[1:08:25] jesus says i go to prepare a place for
[1:08:28] you
[1:08:30] amen and we know in every
[1:08:33] wedding ceremony
[1:08:37] you know uh uh uh you know
[1:08:40] there is there is just that special
[1:08:42] thing the awaiting of the bride because
[1:08:44] there is a lot of preparation that goes
[1:08:46] into it amen
[1:08:48] so this this new jerusalem
[1:08:51] said i saw the holy city new jerusalem
[1:08:55] coming down
[1:08:56] from god out of heaven
[1:09:00] praise the lord i i i
[1:09:06] okay let me just read and we pray
[1:09:08] prepared
[1:09:09] as a bride adore for her husband let's
[1:09:11] pray together
[1:09:12] heavenly father in the name of the lord
[1:09:14] jesus christ we just want to thank you
[1:09:17] and we ask your blessings this morning
[1:09:20] upon your word
[1:09:21] the the little time that we all will
[1:09:23] fellowship together
[1:09:25] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[1:09:29] amen the lord bless you you can you can
[1:09:31] have your seed
[1:09:34] amen praise the lord
[1:09:39] i mean there is there is no there is no
[1:09:42] ministry
[1:09:43] uh uh or no pastor
[1:09:47] that will now want the experience of the
[1:09:49] baptism of the holy ghost upon his
[1:09:52] church
[1:09:53] you know because
[1:09:57] it makes things easy you know
[1:10:00] just like the bible says when solomon
[1:10:02] dedicated the temple
[1:10:04] the glory of the lord came down and even
[1:10:07] the preacher never had a place to preach
[1:10:10] the musicians never had a place to even
[1:10:12] play because the glory of god was just
[1:10:14] going through the building
[1:10:16] it was just so acceptable to the people
[1:10:20] everybody knew that god was in their
[1:10:22] midst
[1:10:23] you know and if god bring us to that
[1:10:27] place
[1:10:28] you know uh everybody will know that god
[1:10:30] is in our midst praise the lord
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:36] you know and and just like every one of
[1:10:39] us
[1:10:40] god will keep us in a in a setting place
[1:10:42] for a purpose
[1:10:44] when that purpose is achieved then he
[1:10:47] takes us away
[1:10:49] or moves us to another place and i
[1:10:51] believe that that is the same for this
[1:10:53] local assembly
[1:10:55] i give you a testimony here brother
[1:10:57] andrews from shiva
[1:10:59] we we had him here before
[1:11:02] one of those alaskan village you know
[1:11:04] there
[1:11:06] in that
[1:11:11] part of uh the country
[1:11:16] and and the at church there has been
[1:11:18] going i think
[1:11:19] over maybe close to some
[1:11:24] 30 years now or or maybe a little more
[1:11:28] but what happened is that over the years
[1:11:32] you have to know that those people they
[1:11:34] live
[1:11:35] as a family because it's a tribe that is
[1:11:37] on the village
[1:11:39] and and and they respect their culture
[1:11:41] they respect their custom
[1:11:43] and all of that so when brother don't
[1:11:46] believe that went to be with the lord
[1:11:48] and brother willie
[1:11:49] and those different brothers started
[1:11:51] going to the island to carry the message
[1:11:53] and the entire village was a catholic
[1:11:56] village
[1:11:57] and now uh when it when they took the
[1:11:59] message there the
[1:12:00] the people of the village frowned at it
[1:12:02] because
[1:12:03] they just thought that they were
[1:12:04] bringing in you know uh
[1:12:07] a new religion or a new teaching that
[1:12:10] was going to divide their people
[1:12:12] sometimes that's the reason why people
[1:12:14] fight against
[1:12:16] truth or people fight against setting
[1:12:19] belief
[1:12:20] because the things that it would bring
[1:12:22] division
[1:12:23] you know it would divide the people it
[1:12:25] will it would break some of their
[1:12:27] culture they would break some of their
[1:12:28] rules
[1:12:29] and out of that praise the lord you know
[1:12:32] so
[1:12:33] uh uh uh
[1:12:38] uh
[1:12:42] what am i thinking on if you're feeling
[1:12:45] tired
[1:12:46] and you want to sleep stand back there
[1:12:50] and just relax yourself and come back in
[1:12:52] church
[1:12:53] that is the righteous things to do so
[1:12:57] uh uh so after after a couple of years
[1:13:02] you know brother andrews and few other
[1:13:03] brothers believe and they were just a
[1:13:05] small group of people i mean the whole
[1:13:07] village was against them you know the
[1:13:10] whole village
[1:13:11] was was against them and
[1:13:14] i mean the last time i was there then
[1:13:17] but andrew's older sister
[1:13:19] i mean she she had given her heart to
[1:13:21] the lord and and i mean she was she was
[1:13:23] just she was just weeping
[1:13:25] for the fact that she was one of the the
[1:13:27] other on the council
[1:13:29] and she knew how much they fought
[1:13:31] against the word of god
[1:13:33] being on that village but i'm saying in
[1:13:36] a sense that
[1:13:37] a small church a a group of people
[1:13:40] god can plant a seed you know i was just
[1:13:43] i was just
[1:13:44] studying yesterday and and uh and uh
[1:13:47] spoke on that before
[1:13:48] but it came back to mean again you know
[1:13:50] uh uh that
[1:13:52] that all of the trees you see around you
[1:13:54] the life
[1:13:55] the thing that transform is in the seed
[1:14:01] the power of life is in the seed
[1:14:04] and i believe this is
[1:14:08] the seed the spoken word
[1:14:11] is the original seed praise the lord
[1:14:16] the written word came after but in the
[1:14:19] beginning god said let there be
[1:14:21] and there was so the spoken word is the
[1:14:24] original see which means
[1:14:26] you have to take the promises from here
[1:14:28] and speak it
[1:14:30] as long as it's laid in this book you
[1:14:32] are just carrying sea
[1:14:34] in the bed but when you take the
[1:14:38] promises from here and you speak it
[1:14:41] then you are putting the seed from the
[1:14:43] bag into the earth
[1:14:46] and if it is the original seed of god no
[1:14:50] matter what comes or go
[1:14:54] there is so much potential in that sea
[1:14:57] to make a forest
[1:15:01] praise the lord
[1:15:05] amen so we uh we
[1:15:08] we're praying and hope that the lord
[1:15:11] will be able to
[1:15:12] to help us praise the lord amen
[1:15:16] so this morning we want to look at this
[1:15:18] subject before us here
[1:15:20] uh reading on revelation chapter 21
[1:15:23] and uh uh such a fair if you if you want
[1:15:26] to put my code up there if you have
[1:15:27] together with you
[1:15:29] let's just read uh uh right there on
[1:15:31] revelation chapter 21
[1:15:33] and uh uh satan's eating
[1:15:36] a little bit as we as we introduce what
[1:15:40] we want to speak about you know on uh
[1:15:42] uh wednesday night i was i was preaching
[1:15:45] on normal wall
[1:15:47] and and there were few few things that
[1:15:50] came to my mind sorry i never even sent
[1:15:53] it
[1:15:53] to share it with you this morning but i
[1:15:56] think i can do that quickly
[1:15:58] uh i made a mention
[1:16:02] about uh america
[1:16:05] in a type of jerusalem let's go to first
[1:16:09] chronicles chapter seven let's go to
[1:16:12] first chronicle chapter seven let's
[1:16:14] let's just back up this morning
[1:16:16] and and uh there there are some
[1:16:19] principles that i want for us to see
[1:16:27] first chronicle chapter seven
[1:16:34] are we together
[1:16:43] when you go over to first chronicles
[1:16:44] chapter 7
[1:16:46] what actually yield is is uh uh it
[1:16:49] begins with
[1:16:51] now when solomon had made an end of
[1:16:54] praying
[1:16:56] the fire came down from heaven and
[1:16:58] consumed the burnt offering and the
[1:17:00] sacrifices
[1:17:02] and the glory of the lord filled
[1:17:05] the house and the priest could not enter
[1:17:08] into the house of the lord because of
[1:17:10] the glory
[1:17:11] of the lord so uh
[1:17:20] first chronicle chapter seven uh
[1:17:23] starts with that
[1:17:27] first chronicle chapter seven starts
[1:17:29] with that
[1:17:31] and uh sorry i'm trying to
[1:17:35] struggle here and help myself i realized
[1:17:37] that
[1:17:38] i left something something out
[1:17:42] since the afraid i've just throw
[1:17:44] something back there
[1:17:46] uh sorry that i know
[1:17:49] i do that all the time
[1:17:55] now so solomon has just dedicated the
[1:17:58] temple
[1:17:59] and this is where god gave solomon the
[1:18:01] promise
[1:18:02] and he said if my people that are called
[1:18:05] by my name
[1:18:06] amen but let's drop down
[1:18:10] to the verse here that i want for us to
[1:18:12] get to get to
[1:18:13] god give this promise to solomon
[1:18:16] that if the people that are called by my
[1:18:18] name if they will humble themselves
[1:18:20] he promised them i will open my eyes
[1:18:23] onto this place
[1:18:24] let's read from verse 15 now
[1:18:28] my eyes shall be opened and my ears are
[1:18:30] in
[1:18:31] attendance to the prayers that i made in
[1:18:34] this place
[1:18:35] for now i i have chosen incentivized
[1:18:38] this house
[1:18:39] for my name may be there forever
[1:18:43] in my eyes and my heart
[1:18:46] shall be dead perpetually and as for
[1:18:49] thee
[1:18:51] if thou will walk before me as david
[1:18:54] your father work and do
[1:18:56] a calling to all that i commanded thee
[1:18:59] and observe my statures and my judgment
[1:19:02] listening to this
[1:19:03] i will establish that throne
[1:19:07] establish the throne of the kingdom i
[1:19:09] call him as i have
[1:19:11] i have coveted that with david the
[1:19:14] father saying there shall
[1:19:16] not fail thee a man
[1:19:19] to be ruler in israel but if
[1:19:23] but if ye turn away and forsake my
[1:19:27] statute
[1:19:28] and mine commandment which i have set
[1:19:31] before you
[1:19:32] and shall go and serve other gods and
[1:19:35] worship them
[1:19:36] listening to this then i will pluck them
[1:19:40] up by the roots out of my land
[1:19:43] which i have given them and this house
[1:19:47] which i have sanctified for my name
[1:19:51] will i cast out of my sight
[1:19:55] and will make it a proverb and a bad
[1:19:58] word
[1:19:59] among the nations and this house
[1:20:03] which is high shall be an astonishment
[1:20:06] to everyone that passed by so that
[1:20:10] he shall say why why have the lord
[1:20:13] done this unto this land and unto this
[1:20:17] house
[1:20:18] now i was saying wednesday night that
[1:20:20] was the same way that god dared with
[1:20:22] this country
[1:20:23] america and the foreign fathers came
[1:20:26] they came with the biblical principle
[1:20:28] you know paying taxes is on the bible
[1:20:30] principle of paying your tithes
[1:20:32] and they establish all of those things
[1:20:35] you know
[1:20:36] for them to be able to get the blessings
[1:20:38] of god upon this lane
[1:20:40] but just like this because this promise
[1:20:43] year
[1:20:43] god also gave it to moses in deuteronomy
[1:20:46] chapter 18
[1:20:47] 28 and uh and and so
[1:20:51] the picture here is there the we are
[1:20:54] having
[1:20:55] all of this violence and
[1:20:58] write and and and and and throwing down
[1:21:01] of statues whatever that they are doing
[1:21:04] and it's it is a mindset that people
[1:21:07] think that they are
[1:21:08] looking for equality but let me tell you
[1:21:12] the uh the way that god established
[1:21:15] equality in the beginning was to make
[1:21:18] man
[1:21:18] in his image
[1:21:21] and in his likeness
[1:21:25] that was the way he established equality
[1:21:27] he
[1:21:28] made male and female in his image
[1:21:31] and in his likeness
[1:21:35] praise the lord now so all of those
[1:21:38] things but what i'm trying to bring to
[1:21:39] your mind here
[1:21:41] is that uh the nation
[1:21:44] has drifted away from the lord
[1:21:47] praise the lord and some of the reason
[1:21:50] is because
[1:21:52] the church that's supposed to stand as
[1:21:54] an ambassador for
[1:21:56] jesus christ has rejected their day they
[1:21:58] rejected their visitation
[1:22:02] they rejected the the revival that god
[1:22:07] has brought to this nation
[1:22:11] jesus said the gospel will travel like
[1:22:14] the lightning from from the east to the
[1:22:16] west
[1:22:17] after catholicism dominated over the
[1:22:21] church
[1:22:22] god break out a man
[1:22:26] luda he started right there in germany
[1:22:32] god started a revival trying to grab the
[1:22:35] people's attention back
[1:22:36] to the he says there is nothing about
[1:22:39] purgatory and paying money for the dead
[1:22:42] it is not written in the scripture
[1:22:44] he wrote his thesis with a little he
[1:22:47] knew from the bible and and
[1:22:48] put on the church and and god moved with
[1:22:51] that revival
[1:22:52] and john wesley dead in england and and
[1:22:55] god moved with that revival
[1:22:57] and then azusa street uh uh uh
[1:23:01] uh the pentecostal revival
[1:23:04] out of all of those revival there were
[1:23:06] many other revivals that came
[1:23:08] john smith uh uh uh the kibberlin
[1:23:11] revival
[1:23:12] and and and and different groups broke
[1:23:14] out of that
[1:23:15] but those were the major men that
[1:23:16] started the move of god
[1:23:19] praise the lord and what what was
[1:23:22] happening is that god was cycling
[1:23:25] the the the the promise that jesus made
[1:23:28] so with the gospel travel he was cycling
[1:23:31] the word
[1:23:34] and right on the west coast that's where
[1:23:37] the pentecostal experience came with
[1:23:39] those azusa
[1:23:40] or azusa street uh believers
[1:23:45] are we together
[1:23:50] and at that time god had i mean there
[1:23:53] were men
[1:23:54] that that uh i mean that were they were
[1:23:56] running a crowd across the nations
[1:23:59] going overseas and going word carrying
[1:24:02] the gospel
[1:24:02] printing bibles and i mean i mean
[1:24:06] they will just revive with every word
[1:24:11] praise the lord
[1:24:17] but when it came to the time where
[1:24:22] god raised up a ministry that was going
[1:24:25] to gather
[1:24:26] all the loose ends
[1:24:30] and bring the people grab the people
[1:24:34] attention bring them back over to
[1:24:37] to to the promise of the hour
[1:24:41] the promise of the day that we are
[1:24:43] living in
[1:24:46] recognizing your dead and this message
[1:24:57] most of them enjoy
[1:25:00] the the discernment they enjoyed the
[1:25:03] miracle
[1:25:04] but they wanted to have nothing to do
[1:25:06] with the teachings
[1:25:08] praise the lord they wanted to have
[1:25:10] nothing to do
[1:25:12] with the teachings of malachi 4.
[1:25:17] but this is what happened this is where
[1:25:19] i want to grab grab your attention to
[1:25:23] and because than the nation because the
[1:25:27] people
[1:25:28] rejected their blessing now you have to
[1:25:30] realize
[1:25:31] god is saying this word to to to solomon
[1:25:36] david has gathered this place
[1:25:40] david has made this place the capital
[1:25:43] solomon
[1:25:44] built the temple here the presence of
[1:25:45] god come then god said i've turned my
[1:25:47] eyes to this place
[1:25:49] i have sanctified this place i've
[1:25:50] displayed my glory before you
[1:25:52] but i'm still telling you that if you
[1:25:54] leave my word
[1:25:56] this very glory that you are seeing will
[1:25:58] become a shame
[1:26:02] just like how it was for israel just
[1:26:04] like how it is for
[1:26:06] america as a nation so it is for the
[1:26:09] believer
[1:26:11] so it is for you as an individual
[1:26:15] the thing that has kept you the thing
[1:26:18] that is keeping you in what you are
[1:26:21] doing and blessing you
[1:26:22] is the promise of god's word
[1:26:27] and just like how god did to israel and
[1:26:30] to the temple
[1:26:31] and to the house the same thing to the
[1:26:33] believer if you turn away from god's
[1:26:35] word
[1:26:37] the proud you have in serving god will
[1:26:39] turn to a shame
[1:26:44] and that's why we have people that were
[1:26:47] that were proud of their faith
[1:26:48] people that were proud of what the grace
[1:26:51] of god
[1:26:52] they are embarrassed of the same thing
[1:26:54] they were once proud of
[1:27:03] that's what i'm trying to bring bring to
[1:27:05] you now
[1:27:06] let me read this to you i mentioned this
[1:27:10] uh sister phil if you can put what i
[1:27:14] just sent up there
[1:27:15] i mentioned this on on wednesday night
[1:27:20] and it's is this thing where you know
[1:27:22] brother brandon was talking about
[1:27:24] uh uh packing a gun
[1:27:27] i i said on wednesday night you know uh
[1:27:30] all of these
[1:27:31] things that is going on but yeah he
[1:27:33] quoted that
[1:27:34] in california from billy graham you know
[1:27:37] he says
[1:27:38] look what darkness we are living in
[1:27:40] today
[1:27:41] look what is going on look at the murder
[1:27:45] the rape the strife why
[1:27:48] it come to pass i believe it was billy
[1:27:51] graham said
[1:27:52] in his last meeting in 10 years from now
[1:27:57] every citizen of california we have to
[1:28:00] pack a gun to protect themselves
[1:28:03] you can't you can't put enough lord
[1:28:06] enforcement
[1:28:08] the people has just
[1:28:11] got gone insane shooting murder rape
[1:28:14] everything it's just gone wide see
[1:28:19] upon the streets it's a day that we are
[1:28:22] living in
[1:28:23] is a sodom soda my day praise the lord
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:35] and then in word for the part he picks
[1:28:38] that up again
[1:28:40] the same thing
[1:28:43] now what the the reason why i'm showing
[1:28:45] you this
[1:28:47] is for us to be able to
[1:28:50] understand the condition of our time
[1:28:54] what what what is creating all of these
[1:28:58] violins out there
[1:29:01] that they want to put under the statues
[1:29:05] of civil right
[1:29:08] but no
[1:29:11] it's a spirit of the age
[1:29:16] that is destroying the people and uh
[1:29:19] uh and just like i said uh wednesday
[1:29:22] night
[1:29:23] it is preparing them for the tear award
[1:29:30] it's preparing them for the great battle
[1:29:33] of america that's what brother branham
[1:29:36] said he says all of this
[1:29:37] rock and roll music that is filled with
[1:29:40] violence
[1:29:42] will prepare the minds and the heart of
[1:29:44] the of of the generation
[1:29:54] are we together now so you see this
[1:29:57] age the age
[1:30:01] is supplied with what would prepare the
[1:30:04] people for violence
[1:30:07] that is the same way you and myself god
[1:30:09] has given
[1:30:10] us what will prepare us for the new
[1:30:12] jerusalem
[1:30:14] that's what we want to come to
[1:30:17] because the spirit of this age is
[1:30:20] preparing
[1:30:21] the people of this age for their doom
[1:30:25] while the spirit of god will be
[1:30:27] preparing god's people for their kingdom
[1:30:36] praise the lord that is the reason why
[1:30:40] we have to pay attention to the
[1:30:42] attraction on our mountain we have to
[1:30:44] pay attention
[1:30:45] to the things that god is doing around
[1:30:47] our life to the things
[1:30:49] that the way he's dealing with us we
[1:30:52] have to pay attention to it
[1:30:59] because the very same house the very
[1:31:02] same house
[1:31:03] where the glory of god came down the
[1:31:06] from heaven the people could see
[1:31:08] the shaking of glory they witnessed it
[1:31:11] with their eyes
[1:31:13] that very same house
[1:31:19] people that didn't know the lord of god
[1:31:21] babylonians walked
[1:31:23] right into the house kim knew
[1:31:26] nebuchadnezzar and his men they talked
[1:31:28] the holy vessels of god
[1:31:35] the thing that keep you and myself is
[1:31:38] the word
[1:31:40] praise the lord amen is the word
[1:31:44] i was listening to brother brown last
[1:31:45] night he says he says uh
[1:31:47] uh it is now you receiving the holy
[1:31:49] ghost he said is the holy ghost that
[1:31:51] receive you
[1:31:54] he said it is just like when god
[1:31:56] accepted
[1:31:58] ebay of sacrifice
[1:32:03] is the word that has the keeping power
[1:32:10] praise the lord
[1:32:17] and uh and and and and israel and and
[1:32:21] and solomon
[1:32:22] were blessed with all of his wisdom and
[1:32:24] and and he
[1:32:25] he seek to know this he seek to want to
[1:32:28] know this
[1:32:29] and seek to want to go to this place and
[1:32:31] understand this thing and then he just
[1:32:33] got himself so makes up
[1:32:35] until his men and women took his heart
[1:32:37] away from the lord
[1:32:43] we have to use the word of god to guide
[1:32:45] our hearts
[1:32:47] praise the lord amen now so he says
[1:32:51] he used the same thing here over in the
[1:32:53] world falling apart he says
[1:32:55] and so will this age meet exactly to the
[1:32:58] sign and the wonder and the things
[1:33:00] that god promised to do in the last days
[1:33:03] the church itself
[1:33:05] will be ready and will go in the rapture
[1:33:08] with jesus
[1:33:10] because we we receive a kingdom that
[1:33:13] cannot be shaken
[1:33:15] it cannot be moved heaven and earth will
[1:33:18] pass away
[1:33:19] but the kingdom shall not pass away
[1:33:22] amen i'm glad
[1:33:25] to be tonight he says in thy
[1:33:28] kingdom aren't you happy
[1:33:32] just think what could
[1:33:35] could you promise yourself today
[1:33:39] in another 10 or 15 years
[1:33:44] if this world shall stand
[1:33:48] if it does stand there every man in
[1:33:52] chevape
[1:33:53] every woman will have to pack a
[1:33:57] gun on the street now you have to know
[1:34:00] it is not the sense of people going to
[1:34:04] hunt
[1:34:04] it is not the sense of i mean there are
[1:34:07] people that grow in the west they are
[1:34:09] used to their raffle that is not the
[1:34:11] sense that brother branham is talking
[1:34:12] about
[1:34:13] what he's talking about here is gun
[1:34:16] violence
[1:34:20] because of the evil that will be so much
[1:34:23] in the land
[1:34:31] that's what he's talking about
[1:34:37] praise the lord and the same people that
[1:34:40] are parking the gowns are the same
[1:34:42] people that are killing himself
[1:34:44] the protection is not in the gum people
[1:34:46] the protection is in god's presence
[1:34:49] it's in god's word
[1:34:59] he says this back in in 1963
[1:35:02] he says 15 years from now
[1:35:06] how many years has we've gone and if we
[1:35:08] will go more years what is it going to
[1:35:12] be
[1:35:18] young people that's the reason why the
[1:35:19] holy ghost is important
[1:35:21] parents that's the reason why the holy
[1:35:23] ghost is important
[1:35:30] are we together oh man
[1:35:35] and he talks about all of this
[1:35:42] he talks about a whole lot he talks
[1:35:44] about uh
[1:35:46] how you're going to stop it he says i
[1:35:49] was in new york the other day
[1:35:50] and went down through there for months

[1:35:58] holloms with earrings in their ears

[1:36:05] way they were dressed and

[1:36:23] then in isaiah chapter five he said
[1:36:25] there will be houses upon houses and
[1:36:27] roads that
[1:36:28] rolls over rolls and all of that you
[1:36:30] know i mean
[1:36:31] the prophet he's speaking on the
[1:36:33] inspiration of the holy spirit but
[1:36:35] also his that inspiration is just like a
[1:36:38] vision
[1:36:41] what is he looking at the horror
[1:36:44] the thing the spirit that is that is
[1:36:48] upon the age that is upon the young
[1:36:50] people
[1:36:55] drawing them into weight praise the lord
[1:37:01] as another young boy gets over to to
[1:37:05] uh uh three four years old
[1:37:08] the thing that died inside them is to
[1:37:10] pierce their ear
[1:37:17] because it's a spirit

[1:37:26] the the young girls on i mean they're

[1:37:58] are we together
[1:38:08] praise the lord
[1:38:12] okay let's go over to satan's eating
[1:38:14] there are some few things that brother
[1:38:16] branham says here
[1:38:17] let me let's just go over it so i won't
[1:38:19] keep you
[1:38:21] uh i noticed it's very warm in here
[1:38:25] i'll keep you since we have to come back
[1:38:27] this evening
[1:38:28] now he's talking in revelation chapter
[1:38:30] 21. satan's eating over in revelation
[1:38:33] chapter 21
[1:38:34] he said and i john saw the holy city the
[1:38:38] new jerusalem discerning
[1:38:40] from heaven out discerning from god
[1:38:44] out of heaven
[1:38:49] there was no sea the first heaven
[1:38:52] and the first earth was passed away
[1:38:56] what is the first heaven
[1:39:00] it was the millennium
[1:39:04] was the first earth was this
[1:39:09] it it will be renovated just like
[1:39:13] it was baptized by
[1:39:17] walter in the days of the
[1:39:20] of of uh baptized by noah
[1:39:24] in the days of his preaching was
[1:39:26] sanctified by christ
[1:39:28] as he sprinkled his blood upon it
[1:39:32] amen to be renovated
[1:39:36] take all the gems and and and
[1:39:40] and everything off of it it will be
[1:39:42] renovated at the end
[1:39:44] with a baptist with a fire baptism
[1:39:47] that will kill every gem every sickness
[1:39:50] every disease every field
[1:39:54] that was ever on the earth now this is
[1:39:57] where my mind was when i was talking
[1:39:59] wednesday night
[1:40:00] on we were steady walls normal
[1:40:04] studying walls is not just america
[1:40:07] against russia or america
[1:40:09] is in germany we having
[1:40:12] uh out of this sickness
[1:40:16] they are walls amen
[1:40:21] i mean we we we we talked about gem
[1:40:24] warfare
[1:40:27] so when isaiah gave that promise
[1:40:31] in isaiah chapter 2
[1:40:35] speaking about the law house upon the
[1:40:37] mountain and where the lion will be by
[1:40:40] the linemen all of that and he says we
[1:40:42] will sell the walls no more
[1:40:44] you know where they would turn their
[1:40:46] sword into plotting hawks and all of
[1:40:48] that
[1:40:49] it is at a place where
[1:40:52] it is true that now physically
[1:40:56] we are going to elaine that will be the
[1:40:59] millennium we are going to a promise
[1:41:01] we are going to a place where the
[1:41:04] scripture said
[1:41:05] satan will be bound for a thousand years
[1:41:09] amen there will be no sickness
[1:41:12] there will be no suffering there will be
[1:41:14] all of these things
[1:41:15] because satan will be bound
[1:41:19] because he will be bound so there will
[1:41:22] be no sin
[1:41:23] i mean there will not come an evil
[1:41:25] thought crossing your mind
[1:41:29] because satan will be bound but you
[1:41:32] think about this
[1:41:35] think about this in this promise of
[1:41:37] revelation chapter 21
[1:41:41] god designed it in a way
[1:41:44] that he says that that city
[1:41:49] coming out of heaven praise the lord
[1:41:54] is going to be like a bride
[1:41:58] prepared for a bridegroom
[1:42:03] now he's comparing the city with a
[1:42:06] people
[1:42:08] because what is the use of a city if
[1:42:10] there is nobody to live there
[1:42:15] are you seeing where i'm going what is
[1:42:17] the use of a city
[1:42:19] if there is nobody who lived it
[1:42:26] amen so here john now
[1:42:30] looking at this new jerusalem looking at
[1:42:34] this city
[1:42:35] coming out of heaven
[1:42:38] he sees this city having such an
[1:42:41] appearance
[1:42:43] like a woman like a bride
[1:42:48] and jesus
[1:42:54] in matthew chapter 5 tells us right here
[1:42:57] you are the sword of the earth
[1:43:00] you are a light you are a city that is
[1:43:03] on the hill
[1:43:09] so you see that is the reason why in
[1:43:12] future home
[1:43:13] brother branham says the same process
[1:43:16] that god is taking the f through
[1:43:21] to prepare it for the new jerusalem
[1:43:25] that is the same process he's taking the
[1:43:27] people that will go to that city
[1:43:33] are we together let's look in the book
[1:43:36] of peter
[1:43:55] glory be to god amen
[1:44:02] i saw this said in the uh
[1:44:06] this is the last time
[1:44:19] praise the lord
[1:44:29] that that is in second peter chapter 3
[1:44:32] second peter chapter 3 try to place this
[1:44:36] in scripture
[1:44:42] ii peter chapter 3.
[1:44:51] to save time let's drop to verse 5 for
[1:44:53] this the willingly are
[1:44:55] ignorant of that by the word of god
[1:44:58] the heavens were of all
[1:45:02] and the earth standed out of the waters
[1:45:06] the water and in the water whereby
[1:45:10] the word that then
[1:45:14] was being overflowed with water perich
[1:45:19] but the heavens and the earth which
[1:45:22] are noun by the same word i
[1:45:25] kept install reserved onto
[1:45:28] fire against
[1:45:33] the day of judgment and predation
[1:45:37] of the ongoing now so we are dealing
[1:45:40] with the same thing here
[1:45:42] uh uh uh peter yeah now is testifying to
[1:45:45] us he's pointing us back to
[1:45:48] some of the the the the the process that
[1:45:53] god has
[1:45:54] have taken the word through is first
[1:45:59] experience his first attraction
[1:46:03] was when when uh uh noah preacher
[1:46:07] messaged 120 years and the people didn't
[1:46:10] listen
[1:46:10] god visited the world with with a
[1:46:12] baptism
[1:46:14] he brought a judgment praise the lord
[1:46:18] and he learned that noah bought on top
[1:46:21] of the mountain
[1:46:23] proving that only the word of god will
[1:46:26] stand
[1:46:29] praise the lord
[1:46:33] and then peter also making us to
[1:46:36] experience here
[1:46:38] that the entire universe at that time
[1:46:42] went through that judgment because the
[1:46:45] word of god said it
[1:46:47] and the word of god stood and the same
[1:46:50] word
[1:46:50] that said he was going to destroy the
[1:46:53] world with water he's the same one that
[1:46:55] is saying
[1:46:55] he's going to destroy the world with
[1:46:57] fire
[1:47:01] praise the lord amen
[1:47:08] so if you look in here and you read this
[1:47:11] carefully
[1:47:12] you will see how
[1:47:16] peter brings out all
[1:47:19] like brother branham who says all the
[1:47:21] birth pains that the world has gone
[1:47:23] through
[1:47:30] and he make us to to understand that the
[1:47:33] same way
[1:47:34] that god is preparing
[1:47:38] this word he says heaven and earth will
[1:47:40] pass away
[1:47:42] he says it's just going to be a a
[1:47:45] renovation
[1:47:45] god is going to renovate the entire
[1:47:47] world
[1:47:49] and then that that city will come out
[1:47:53] and sit right down here on on the same
[1:47:55] earth where we are
[1:47:59] and god's people will inherit it
[1:48:04] but before we get to that setting it is
[1:48:06] the very same thing
[1:48:08] that he's doing with our lives
[1:48:12] he's preparing us for a prepared city
[1:48:21] praise the lord
[1:48:30] revelation chapter 8
[1:48:39] revelation chapter 8 holds
[1:48:45] and understanding for us after
[1:48:49] the seventh seal was open and
[1:48:52] uh there was silence in heaven
[1:49:05] but let's drop down to verse 12.
[1:49:12] was no more
[1:49:22] relation chapter 8 verse 12 and
[1:49:26] the fourth angel sounded and the tear
[1:49:29] parts
[1:49:30] of the sun was smarting in the tear
[1:49:33] terror parts of the moon and the
[1:49:36] pteropaths of the stars
[1:49:40] so as the third part of them was docking
[1:49:44] and and they're shown that
[1:49:47] for uh a third part of it
[1:49:52] and the night likewise and i beheld
[1:49:56] and heard an angel flying through the
[1:49:59] midst of heavens
[1:50:01] saying with a loud voice
[1:50:05] world war war
[1:50:09] we know that word world over from the
[1:50:11] old testament is it's a kind of a curse
[1:50:13] word
[1:50:14] but brother branham says this was it was
[1:50:17] all of this angel sounding the three war
[1:50:21] walls
[1:50:22] were announced all of those walls was
[1:50:24] the first world
[1:50:26] the second world war and the third world
[1:50:28] war
[1:50:33] praise the lord the first world war 1914
[1:50:37] the second one 1939 and
[1:50:40] and the one that this word is breathing
[1:50:43] in itself with all of the things that is
[1:50:50] happening
[1:50:54] are we together
[1:50:59] so you see just like there was a water
[1:51:02] baptism in noah's day
[1:51:04] there was a sanctification with a blood
[1:51:06] that was sheared
[1:51:07] and there will be a fire that will
[1:51:09] renovate the earth
[1:51:11] praise the lord
[1:51:18] and that's the same way that he's
[1:51:19] dealing with his people
[1:51:22] because he's preparing us for a prepared
[1:51:25] city he said i'll go and prepare the
[1:51:26] place for you
[1:51:29] praise the lord
[1:51:34] robert barnum says he says malta does
[1:51:36] not in
[1:51:37] inherit uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:51:40] immortality
[1:51:44] he says so really it is not a house of
[1:51:46] breaks
[1:52:03] the first heaven will pass away
[1:52:08] and the first heaven falls under
[1:52:13] the space of time of the millennium
[1:52:15] because you have to remember
[1:52:17] is that one day
[1:52:21] is the completion the fulfillment of
[1:52:23] that one day
[1:52:25] that adam broke out of
[1:52:28] because until sin came
[1:52:33] he was still honored that one day
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:42] and that's what will happen a thousand
[1:52:44] year reign
[1:52:46] god will give give his people just like
[1:52:49] i said wednesday night
[1:52:50] you know he gave noah a full taste of
[1:52:53] what
[1:52:53] adam had he had noah in the boat the
[1:52:56] door closed there was lion there was
[1:52:58] cheetah there was all of those animals
[1:53:00] but with the presence of the
[1:53:02] of the lord sin was kept out of the eye
[1:53:06] amen and the lion kool-aid
[1:53:10] by the lamb
[1:53:20] he gave him a full taste 40 days on on
[1:53:23] that seed
[1:53:24] with the outdoor clothes
[1:53:27] the lion never raised up his voice
[1:53:37] he's going to give us that experience
[1:53:41] amen
[1:53:47] being born into a word like like job
[1:53:49] said
[1:53:51] few days and fall of trouble
[1:53:55] few days and full of trouble
[1:53:59] is that a time that we have not seen
[1:54:01] trouble
[1:54:02] even if we have not seen it we heard it
[1:54:04] on the news
[1:54:08] amen few days
[1:54:11] just a few days we have to be here
[1:54:15] whether we ever go we're going to reach
[1:54:17] 70 years old or 80 years old but
[1:54:20] it is just a few days and it has been
[1:54:23] trouble from the day we got here
[1:54:30] from the day we got here it was trouble
[1:54:37] that's the reason why the baby comes
[1:54:39] right from the room and start crying
[1:54:40] because it's trouble
[1:54:44] that child is identified with trouble
[1:54:46] yeah
[1:54:49] praise the lord if the child have to
[1:54:52] come by see
[1:54:53] session the mother is in trouble
[1:54:57] it have just been trouble from one
[1:55:00] trouble
[1:55:01] to another trouble
[1:55:05] praise the lord
[1:55:09] and when we even thought that we gave
[1:55:11] our life to the lord jesus christ
[1:55:12] everything is going to be up hell break
[1:55:14] loose
[1:55:16] and the devil just turned every gun from
[1:55:18] hell on you
[1:55:20] it had just been one trouble to another
[1:55:23] trouble
[1:55:24] but god going to give you such a rest
[1:55:27] when the millennium day breaks
[1:55:30] you will remember your sorrow no more
[1:55:42] i don't care how we try
[1:55:48] maybe it's not natural not to listen to
[1:55:51] the news not to read the news feed
[1:55:53] on your on your on your phone you just
[1:55:56] try to just stay away from all the
[1:55:58] negative things
[1:55:59] somebody is going to drive by on the
[1:56:01] street
[1:56:02] and cut before you
[1:56:06] or they're going to come down the street
[1:56:08] with this loud music
[1:56:09] just full of insults it's just
[1:56:13] one trouble after another
[1:56:18] a few days that is full of trouble

[2:04:15] and and put their voice together and say
[2:04:17] this is not true
[2:04:19] the society honored that that because

[2:04:22] to rebel so what they are saying is
[2:04:24] truth
[2:04:25] against god's word
[2:04:31] that is the thing that is appealing to
[2:04:33] the hearts of the young people
