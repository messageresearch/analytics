[Music] because we have found a super-state the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord I just feed the spirit of worship I mean just to just worship the Lord and but like the prophet of God said the service is not complete without the word because the word is our object of worship amen the word is what we come to worship praise the Lord in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was gone there is nothing about the Word of God there is no body than it's about the Word of God the preacher the brothers and sisters the children nobody above the world amen praise the Lord even God himself never put himself above his word he works by the lord of his word so we will just give a little time to the word this morning and then we will go into into a time of worship praise the Lord amen so thank you musicians let's stand on our feeding and we will read 2nd samuel chapter 10 this is my end-of-the-year message up preaching started that Wednesday night from the house of shame to the house of testimony amen and I believe that's what God is taking this little group he's taking us from the house of shame into a house of testimony amen there's nothing to be ashamed of there's nothing to be if you are dealing with Shamy you know we have the remedy praise the Lord Amen just confess it to the Lord amen praise the Lord if the devil state can get from your back then find somebody you can trust and confess it oh praise the Lord because shame is going to destroy you amen there's something so we want to we want to just read the scripture yet in 2nd samuel chapter 10 praise the Lord god bless you sister salad for staining and how the knowing just exactly what to do in in time like this he may praise the Lord for some you second Samuel Chapter ten I hope that's what I say at the second Samuel Chapter ten and it came to pass after this okay I'm right after this that the king of the children of armour died and Hanna his son reigned in his stead then said David I will show kindness unto her the son of nimshi as his father show kindness to me kindness unto me and they were sent to comfort him by the hand of his sevens by the hand of his servants for his father and David seven came into the land of the children of Ammon in the prints of the children of Ammon said unto Hannah dear Lord think of the out that David honored the father that he has he has sent comforters unto thee have not devil rather send his sevens on today to search the city and to spy out and to overthrow it well for Hannah took David seven and shave off the one half of the a beard and cut off their garment in the middle even though their boots and send them away when they taught it to David he sent to meet him because the men were greatly ashamed and the King said tarried at Jericho until your beard is grown and then returned father in the name of the Lord Jesus Oh God we remember Paul said in the book of Romans for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ for is the power of God unto salvation father we want to ask your blessing this morning we want to thank you Father God the Lord everything lure the enemy pulled to handle the service law father we've been able to break through it this morning Oh God and we we just we just love you Father Lord to know oh god that this is net we are not conforming to acree Lord God Lord Jesus this is this is not a people Lord God that is just following a religious order but oh god father we are a people law that are putting our hearts before you and asking you to change our lives that the reality of Jesus Christ would tap in our body Lord you promised so father God to have a redeemed people in this age and oh god is that reality love father that God all Jesus we are striving for this morning we want to thank you

our mind on you Lord and you alone we don't want the devil Lord God exploiting any opportunity father God Lord we just want to look to you their altar and the finisher of our faith come Lord bless this portion of the service right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray with faith in Thanksgiving in Jesus name Amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord from the house of shame to the house of testimony amen praise the Lord amen one time this house of yours this body of yours was the house of shame amen born in Saint Shipley in iniquity coming to the word speaking lies praise the Lord Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 let's read there this morning as we try to build a little foundation year of where we want to go talking about this subject praise the Lord Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 the Bible speaks you verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh verse 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed amen you know why they were not ashamed because they were God conscious when a people when the people become God conscious they are not ashamed praise the Lord Amen but Branham who says there was a whole evil over their eyes thinking man's fetter that's what he said but it was because they were God conscious praise the Lord and then when we go over to Genesis chapter 3 after the broke the Word of God then they became ashamed amen then it stands - found fig leaf to hide their shame and to hide their nakedness and then you know and and and and from that time that the the the human race were exposed to shame because they had become self-conscious no more God conscious they are started becoming self-conscious thinking about himself thinking about what this person thinking about me and thinking about what this person and trying to meet up with Arab thoughts and give everybody a better expectation of themselves a better feeling of themselves and all of that self self-conscious Amen praise the law but can you can you just imagine the scripture that we have just read steadying on there at a little bit last night and this King was was the king of honor you you have to remember now these these were the two nations that was more an Arnold from from the two daughters of lot so so these people somehow the word it will relate it to Israel praise the Lord because of the route of Abraham and lot now if you follow the scripture you realize in 1st Samuel chapter 11 First Samuel Chapter 11 that was worth saw the king got his first victory before he was anointed to be king in Israel amen and I mean after he have had that experience with with with saw and and he was faced with this battle with the children of the children of honor and then from that battle this king that David was singing a regard to after he passed took a very very strong hatred against all I want to be the background here so you can see what is happening you he took I mean he he had a saw for the way that saw slaughter his people praise the Lord now pretty soon David would start having problem with Saul and David will be on the run are we together First Samuel chapter 22 well now tell us that David as skipping from Saul he took his father and his mother because now you know all of these things of you know present politics were you know when when the leader this net you know he's net in favor of you your parents you know I also a target is it's being sent back there amen David had to now take his parents his brothers and his sisters that's what the scripture said that's that's over in First Samuel chapter 22 praise the Lord then he had that he choose to go and praise law amen verse one sitting David therefore departed thence and escaped to tudyk to the cave I belong in his brethren sin all his father's house heard it they went down Taylor to meet him and everyone and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in depth see the kind of people that David was leading amen all of these people in distress in depth you know when and then just different things but year when you read down David now talk these people down over to the land of Honor and then he you know the king was able to receive him now so you just put the connection together now now this king he had problem with saw and because David and so is having problem now he can be able to accommodate amen so I want to get nine story together now David talk now I missing something here David talked his parents and his people down to the land of more now more of was the auto tribe from lost daughter now they were down there for a period of time okay my getting my story correct now it's over in second Samuel Chapter eight word the people know how to lead the land of Mora because the king of the land of Mora decided to revenge on the family of David now so there was there was I think two of the house of David and skip over to the land of Honor then there was where the friendship came between the the king of Honor and David now because he was able to open his doors when the king of Moore came on on his people so that was where the friendship was so David had a friendship with this King and then when the King passed away David decided now to send his men for them to go and and you know and sympathize the king is gone he now sent his men for them to go and sympathize with with the family with the nation go and represent Israel so his kindness over to these people praise the Lord Amen now so we realized here when David sent his men we saw water what a scripture told us there you know everybody knew David for being a man of war and you know the end and the things that he can do so these people just thought oh no you know David is its planning year to can for you know so do all the honor him so maybe this man that he has sent the adjuster spine and the scripture says there was the shave half of the abeer you know kind of a disfigured their face and and took their clothes their clothes their garment right to the backside and just tear it off and you know and just and just left them in that kind of a horrible condition praise the Lord embarrassing situation amen these were men you know the how wives and children just imagine trying to return back home and coming home and you know in in such a bad shape you know that your honor garment is suppose you know your beer is all chafing and and all of that what what a disgrace what a shame praise the Lord now this is what I want for us to follow this now these men were embarrassed but the reason why David will now bring them back home because the a shame is the shame of Israel amen the a shame is the shame of the kingdom praise the Lord and that's what we have to know that your shame is machine whatever embarrasses you embarrass the entire kingdom embarrasses the entire day embarrasses the Church of the Living God praise the Lord and so David went to me the man and told him well you stay right here in Jericho now you have to remember that Jericho was a city that was cursed by Joshua even though it was a curse setting but Jericho has a history of testimony praise the Lord amen it has a history of testimony where I am sharing the message that fate has saved a he said Jericho was always a curse city since the Jews possessed polished and he said Joshua said curse is the man that we built this city Jericho always represents backsliding Jerusalem sits above Jericho the heavenly and and as it left Jericho going down you are you are going away from God the curse said it the blessed one side and the curse City on the other side so he said Jericho always represented back slating amen Jericho was a cursed place but Jericho always hold a testimony that's a paradise given and what I want for us to just look at it together Wednesday night we were talking and using sin John chapter 4 brother Branham says here who is this the chassis deck he said that he says now one days in John chapter four he he had me to go bust a mirror on his road down to Jericho praise the Lord now there's a kind of a parallel years when you look at it now we were talking about how Jesus went down and met that woman and you know and took her from the house of shame to the house of testimony well actually he was on his road to Jericho praise the Lord amen and since John chapter fall he said I must need go by the way of Samara but his destination was over to Jericho now follow me in a little bit now on the road to Jericho went up around some merit and why he was going up there he sat down on the well outside of the city of Syria and the well if you have if you have ever been there it's a little panoramic about like this year and and and there is a public spring there the water were they all come and the women come all the morning get their pots of water and and and put it on the head and and and one on each hip and walk is just as strange as can be never spill a drop talk to one another the people come out there so this was about eleven hour of the day I got stuck on this last night a little bit because there are a couple of places you see where the prophet of God referred today's as this was about the eleventh hour and and there are other places you say was about known now what got me stuck on this because the scripture said it was about the sixth hour that's what the scripture said amen is that what the Bible says in st. John chapter 4 that it was about the sixth hour now what happened is there when when I started looking into this you know it's just it's just those things that you know I mean they grab your attention you you don't sleep until you can be able to figure out what was going on year praise the Lord but what is happening here is they're the the Jewish hours just like we talked about the watches of the night amen the first watch the second watch and the Terr watch of the night and that is the same with how the Jews called their time so the Jewish time from the rising of the Sun the first hour starts praise the Lord amen so from the rising of the Sun depending on when the Sun comes up maybe about 5:00 a.m. or five tearing that the Jewish hour of the day starts so we our timepiece is mostly under the Roman because we use the Roman calendar we use the Roman time is completely different from the Jewish time praise the Lord Amen so under the Roman time it will be the sixth hour it will be like almost no honor under the Jewish time is the sixth hour under the Roman time is about 11 o'clock noon praise the Lord now another place that would that would that would kind of for grab your attention on this as chapter 2 verse 15 the Bible says for this man are not drunk as he suppose seeing it is about the Terr hour of the day in seeing that this is above the tail hour of the day so this was just around 9 a.m. when the holy ghost came on the date of Pentecost and those people started speaking in tongues and and and and you know and running around and and all of that now if you go back again you will see that the Bible says about the death of Jesus Christ March chapter 27 the Bible says and now from the six hours there was darkness all over the land until the ninth hour so when Jesus was hanging on the cross from the sixth hour which was just about noon eleven twelve that was the reason why it became it became striking to the people because darkness came right in the middle of the day if it was six o'clock darkness it would not surprise him because by that time of the day attack but when they hang him on the cross about the sixth hour darkness came right in the middle of the day and the darkness and by it got stopped for about three hours so from from about eleven twelve o'clock until 3:00 p.m. it was completely dark where Branham says the Sun refused to see its maker on the cross it closes its eyes so what are we talking about it was about eleven o'clock a man oh my goodness praise the Lord Amen people that's why we that's why we love this message a many it makes the Bible the new book the Bible becomes an open book because all the women went to the well in the early part of the morning it was for all the the wives and you know the young women the virgins and all of that but when it gets to that afternoon time and the Sun is coming up everybody goes away they have all fetch their water that's when this woman sneaked out he men just about that time praise the Lord yeah that thing caught my mind so I wanted to share with you their selves I didn't want to dwell on the earth but I just wanted to bring their out him in and and in the parallel year to realize that here a David men were put to shame and he kept them in the city of Jericho Jesus here going to the city of Jericho and then he but he had to pass by the way of Samara I was just trying to keep those parallel together amen because Jericho is the house of testimony praise the Lord you know we remember we all remember Rahab and what happened the people went around the wall of Jericho just praising God the walls of Jericho came down he men the Good Samaritan it was on the road of Jericho praise the Lord blombo team was received his sight at the gate of Jericho Amen Jesus caused Zacchaeus down from the tree by the weight of Jericho even though it is a curse it it what is is a city of testimony praise the Lord amen amen are we together yes so we saw as we look at this together what I want for us to realize here is that you know like we read from the scripture it's ruining them that are sick that needs a physician amen and there is something that is unique about medical science but random talks about how they have that ambling about Iraq of the stepping around the poor remain and we ever give them that inspiration the God from what God told Moses to do praise the Lord amen and then there there is just something unique about them also you get down to the hospital I mean they charge you in the register you in and everything and to make sure that you are dears they tell you they bring you a menu wear your suit like this but for them to tell you that you now honor our care it will bring you again take all your suit your necktie wear your gown praise the Lord and they always having you put and it tying it to the back praise the Lord it's a sign that you are here for help that backside that relief open is a sound that you I hear to be helped praise the Lord Amen so I mean if you know if you if you are if you are too fancy you might have the best the most expensive nightgown home but they want you to keep that one on him and tell you that you are here for help praise the Lord now so out of this man had you know what the same identification year those men of honor you know tear their closet expose their nakedness and and give it hard to keep them down there you know until you can find a way you know for their for their beer to grow in and bring them a change of clothes and and in order there before they can come home to their wife and their family and to the house of Israel Lord so David had to keep them there he had to take them out of out of that place of shame and just keep them right there in Jericho because Jericho will hold them a testimony he's going to use that you go back and read the rest of the story there you'll find out what will happen now this is just to put us in a place to realize just like we're air from Genesis chapter 2 25 you know and the scripture says and they were not ashamed but then after the why the Bible's dared caught us in a place where Genesis chapter 3 tells us now man disobeyed God and break God's Word and pretty soon this man that was not ashamed this man I was gold conscious it's now hiding himself praise the Lord amen there is just something about it we all become very conscious if there is something of our you know of our backside that is that is that is exposed a young man can be playing in sooner his pants rip in the back he stopped becoming embarrassed what if somebody is looking at you or net for the mother day for the matter of fact that that trouser is told behind you you just feel insecure praise the Lord what are somebody looking at you on now you just nobody know what has happened but something is telling you that I'm not secure praise the Lord have it happen to you before praise the Lord sometimes even give you the most strange walk and you put smile on your face because you want to capture everybody and nobody should look behind it praise the Lord and that's what happened when people are having strange walk it means that they are hiding something when it just stopped behaving strange in church strange around the home praise the Lord then shame has come in you see shame makes people to lose their identity they lose the irregular behavior they just that you know want to behave more nice I mean they are taking knives to another level just because they don't want to be caught praise the Lord but you know shame can only shame you if you don't deal with shame it can only shame you praise the Lord but you see the quicker you deal with shame is normally shame it become a testimony praise the Lord and I was looking at this in looking in the what blood Bentham shed over in a messy shame he says here now the word ashamed could be translated embarrassed you know something that you are faced with something that you are embarrassed about being ashamed that's another thing being ashamed does it shows that you are not sure of what you are talking about if you know what you are talking about and have the assurance that you know what you are talking about you can tell anybody that I mean you are not ashamed you can tell anybody that anywhere anytime because you know what you're talking about you know what God has brought you true I mean it didn't happen to another person it happened to you you can see it anytime anywhere praise the Lord but when your experience is not sure then the story is this way one time and the other time the house the cow is on top of the house eating grass praise the Lord you can tell anybody that you are not ashamed but if you feel put off out of place it shows you are not sure then you become embarrassed then you start stammering you start messing your words praise the Lord Amen and then I took I took I took brother branham definition because I was thinking about it and I went back and and and I starts to look at this of the way he did kind of or defined this word because I I just been kind of for dealing with that on my you know you know because sometimes there are a lot of things that being misrepresented Amen you find some people you know that that is just I mean I mean they kind of owe swallow up caught up in a spirit of pride and sometimes they think they have they have shame face that's not shame face amen you know having a humble blushing face it's something completely different from machine face a face that there is that is respectful and reverent to the Word of God it's completely different so I went back I started looking at this in and I I found these two two words that kind of a brought out the meaning better then I said okay I see what Weber Brennan took his definition from you know because the thing about it recently I was talking to a brother and and and I told the brother I said most of the time we try to we try to define scriptural words with modern dictionary amen but you will realize that scripture define itself praise the Lord scripture define itself so ashamed I mean in embarrass which of course was the word I was looking at means to be ashamed to be confounded you know to display shame dumbest regime cause embarrassment and I took another word I don't know which one of them is I think the first one I read it was from the Hebrew and this one is is from the Greek to be without resources you know for people to be talking things just because this is that's what my church believed or that's what my pastor says that's what our church says and I really never took a time to really out of God's Word you don't have a resource you are just only saying it because you yeah they said it praise the Lord to be in a strait it's a narrow path to be left wanting to be embarrassed to be in doubt not to know which way to turn Amen not to know which way to turn to be at a loose of oneself were you aware you're not having yourself under control it can be embarrassing to be in doubt not to know how to decide or what to do or to be perplex praise Lord we have to know that God has not given us the spirit of fear amen but his word has come to give us a sign and just like I said when God made man in the beginning he made man to be upright he made man up right toe stuck in the earth like roots praise the Lord so then we realize something happened that put man in this shameful condition and we all have things that are very shameful of our lives amen for my real father our first birth it's shameful verbatim says no matter where it was in the best Hospital he says every birth is a mess praise the Lord and God by His grace has come to take us out of the house of shame toward the house of testimony praise the Lord and to get out of the house of shame we have to be God conscious let me read something else here that girl from the message of shame he says and you notice Amen you notice there is so much of that today especially on the subject that I'm now speaking of a shame of the word praise the Lord now he and his word is the same in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever and whatsoever is ashamed of me and my word praise the Lord you know over and over Jesus said that through the gospel whosoever is a shame of me in this word I would be a shame of him now most of most of the time the the the the the secular believer they were only thing there when Jesus says that is to be ashamed of the name of Jesus it's not the name of Jesus he said was whoever is ashamed of me and what is Jesus Christ in every age is his word is the promised word to that age and that is the reason why through the seven church ages every time he comes to the church edge if you go back and read from revelation chapter three every time he comes to the church age he identify himself I am the Alpha and Omega I am the beginning and the end why because in every age God has an identification and you have to identify him in your age if you don't identify him you will be struck with a historic guard you obese you just be stuck because you realize to the Gentile Church he identified himself to every church age and it's not the same identification one is not the same identification it's the same God with the same characteristics but God in every age will will will hide himself behind a man behind a ministry praise the Lord it's the same Jesus speaking to Ephesian Church age it's the same Jesus speaking to the simnet church age but when he speaks and identified himself to the age he does not use the same identification praise the Lord and that is the reason why people are ashamed of him praise the Lord I just I just read an article of a church that was going to have a new pastor and what he did was he first time to the church he dressed like a homeless man he disguised himself like a homeless man and then he came to the church the very people are wanting this new pastor he came as a homeless man and I mean he was sitting right there to the church and and I mean and he I mean he could see the the more unbelieving attitude from from from from the people that he was coming to Pastor praise the Lord amen well I guess if if if if some of them knew that that there was the a pastor you know even if they have a funny attitude to homeless people they will smile at him that they praise the Lord but because they they never knew that he was the one there was this guy see himself as a homeless man praise the Lord and you could see how the people were caught in a shame when he realized that that was the a pastor that just disguise himself praise Lord oh that's that's an embarrassing situation I mean so just like just like I was saying and I said I was going to talk on this but I'm not speaking on their name by just giving an idea just so you can be able to see where I'm going with this revelation chapter 2 verse 1 on today on to the Church of Ephesus write these things said he the hold at the seven star now on to Ephesus church age this was Jesus identification he'd hold at the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks praise the Lord now if you look at this now this is to the Gentile age the first Gentile church he taking on this identification this is he's he identifying him says he I'm the one writing on to your episode the one that hold at the seven stars in his right hand the one that walketh in the mists and if you if I sort of God as a daughter of God if reading our Bible the one that walketh in the midst where does it takes our mind to back to Genesis the one that was walking in the midst of the garden has not come again to walk in the midst of the seventh church so it's just God masking himself the same one that was working in the cool of the evening and how was he walking in Genesis how did the Bible says how was he walking the voice of God was walking in the mists of the garden now there's a voice of God here the same one praise the Lord now you see if you can identify if you can identify a person you will never be a team of him what are the change their form I believe they are taught that their their pastor his wife knew he was the one do you think that she would be ashame of her husband she knows that he was the one this guy see himself he was the one in there so she would not be ashame of him praise and that is the thing that is crossing shame that's the thing that caused Adam shame he was not ashamed of our sins but for them when naked in the garden there was not ashamed but what caused shame well pretty soon oh wow amen he has lost their consciousness of God he has lost the whole evil it's now his conscious of himself he realized that he's naked himself in shame the same one that identified himself to the FSO church as the one hole in the seventh side the one who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks when it came down to the second church age verse 8 how did he identify him said the same one and onto the angel of the church of Sam the right this thing said the first and the last which was dead and is alive amen that's how he identified himself to that age so the believer of the age receiving that letter norine who is he that was dead and is alive amen who is he he said I can lay down my life and I will raise it up again you see so that is the reason why the media birth the believer of the age seeing this identification they will see the man but he knows that the ministry is Jesus Christ amen that's how he identifying himself to that age we together for the Bahamas Church age and onto the Pergamos Church is ver 12 these things say he which have the shop saw with two-edged Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrew 4:12 is that one another why the scripture the Word of God is sharper and two edges war so here he identified himself as the word and our word that is like a two inch of soil it can discern it can pierce even to the X nor endure between the spirit and a soul it can discern the heart so he's identifying himself all of this identification is just one man the Lord Jesus Christ that's the Lord Jesus Christ but he's using different masks as he come to this church age he he he he picks on and ministry picks on a man that is the reason why you would not have problem with the messenger if you know the identification and whew is he that have identified himself praise the Lord Amen it's just like our church's Good Shepherd who is the Good Shepherd the Lord Jesus not me Amen is the Lord Jesus he is the Good Shepherd but as a church we can trust that he will be able to give us a man that will be burdened with the people burning with the Word of God that will reflect the Good Shepherd so he identified himself in every age HIDA had a shop 2x war amen to the terror tear at church age verse 18 this thing said the Son of God amen who have his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like farm rise praise the Lord this thing said the Son of God and if we realize Jesus came in three sons name Amen a son of man which is always referred to a prophet praise the Lord the Son of God that was the Amana promise of God among his people the anointing of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and the son of David wishes a millennial promise are we together and year to the territorial church age he's identifying himself as the son of God oh I wish I was talking on the identification of Jesus Christ in all ages praise the Lord my mind is going to something this morning but we're almost out of time I'm just only trying to point point us to the place that when you can identify the person you cannot be ashame of him praise the Lord you cannot be a shame of him because you know who he who he is praise the Lord and you see them and and that's what God is doing in in in in the life of his children because it's Christ in you the hope of glory inside his church age you can just go back and just and just you know and just look look over all of these things onto the injured of the saddest church existing say he they had the seventh Spirit of God and the Seven Stars praise the Lord back back over in in in the seminal church age or the yeah the same that church age we look at that not the same maturity the Ephesian Church age he had a seven style you know hold of the seven style in a year in the inside his church age he's a seven spirit and in the seven style is Christ he feels everything amen the seven spirit year is not seven individual spirit that will make us worse than Trinity it's one God just breaking himself out just like God took that the spirit of Moses and put it on all of those men just for the same work amen just like on a date of Pentecost if he pour out his spirit on his church it's the same thing are we together Philadelphia Church age let me just run through this and I'll be done with you year he says and and he that is true he that is true he they have the keel of David he died openeth and no man shot it and shot and no man can open praise the Lord that's how he identified himself to the Philadelphia Church age the age of brotherly love amen he brought the the love of the beloved the key of David oh they a lot of keys in his life praise the Lord touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm that's a key in David's life he told a man he says don't don't don't chop his ears or maybe the Lord has told him to do there that's another key in David's life all of those things were key that God locked in the life of David he was a man after God's own heart praise the Lord he had a key to open God's heart of mercy it will lock in David's life verbatim said in the message there he was preaching a crisis the mystery of God revealed he says this brother Levi was talking to him and say brother Brandon how can you sit down and a lot of people to talk did I mean they can just slam your name and you don't see nothing about it you know he says he says he says and this brother was talking like a man hi his I mean he hi he's he's gone all loaded up and he was just ready to blast anybody and better been told him he says he says he's his brother he started talking something to the brother and he says do you remember when David was growing out as a fugitive he says and a man started spitting on David amen and somebody rose up to say sir I will not let this door to spit on my king he said and and and Davis said leave him the Lord told him to do that praise the Lord we're burnin was not even done saying there a vision just broke on the wall praise the Lord sometimes we think it's you know our our our our him and effort and things that we have to do you know to be able to win the heart of God to win God high you must respect God's Word you must come in obedience to God's Word praise the Lord he never even said that a vision broke on the wall and I mean he was able to give an answer to someone I was in need why because he was not carried away or coming into self defense trying to defend himself and saying oh yeah that you know those people are talking about me they don't know this and this this is you I mean he phoned a key of David and that's what we want to do church that's what we want to we want to do and that's why we are praying that the Lord would take us into as we come out of this house of shame amen people are ashamed to testify a shame to you know to read a Bible a shame to parading and I mean the devil just ruling our life in shame when we're supposed to be living in the grace of God's testimony of everything that he's doing in our life every day amen the devil and in-system age that we are living in you know have just put things out there to lock people into shame if there's anything that will have you to look over your shoulder before you do it you have you must ask yourself is there something I machine off praise the Lord you have to look over our shoulder in the restaurant before we pray then there you then there is a problem with your experience amen I mean then there is a problem with your experience what are you in the library what are you on the bus wherever you are calling upon the name of the Lord Jesus you don't need nobody permission and times we try to we look over our shoulders to see whether somebody is looking at us and we don't want to be looking at and all of that praise the Lord let me tell you this body holds a lot of shame it is holding shame that runs down from your ancestors some of the habits you have some of the attitude you have they run down in your gene and God want you to break out of that he want you to break out of that break out of complex amen break out of the place word you just always feel like you know you I mean you some kind of a second-class somebody that is bored by the blood of Jesus Christ that is the highest price that can ever be paid that Jesus will share his blood for you you are more valuable than whatever praise the Lord you don't need to be driving a flashy B&W before before you you get class and that's why the word does to be able to get class they come down from the icon and they blink the light so everybody can know who's now I have arrived as a son of God as a daughter of God you must be able to announce your presence by your decent thing and now's your presence by your decent thing you don't announce your presence by your waiver by your your smartest smart cellphone or the ladies 2020 vehicle you announce your presence by your decency praise the Lord you announce your presence by referencing the God that you sell amen we're living in an age never an age has been a shame of God than this age that we are living in praise the Lord amen and all of those things are out there trying to rub us but God is taking us out of the house of shame amen stickiness out of the house of shame and this body is the house of shame because of his past because of its complex because of all the genetics and all the different things praise the Lord he keeps trying to you know trouble mine and you know embarrass our spirit set up in up in a position word you know we just feel condemned the more we get closer to God that's the more our spirit ought to be lifted we must be enjoying this grace that has come to us well we want to thank the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord Paul says if this tabernacle be dissolved there's another one that is waiting for us praise the Lord and that Tabernacle is the tabernacle of testimony praise the Lord people are getting the shame of the message getting the shame of the messenger you don't know what God has given to you praise the Lord you don't know what God has given to you you don't know what grace you have walked right into where branches is just like that man condemned to death and he was going to be Hank and and his friend went and plea you know to the governor and the governor came right into his room all this identification that I'm reading in this in this in the scripture in a way that God was identified to all of these ages there were not men when Luther rose up in his age people who see Luther as a Catholic priest that was breaking out of capitalism but it was God that was hidden behind a man to bring a Reformation this exact identification that we read in this scripture it was that scripture taken on flesh when he stepped out of the Lutheran Church it was that particular scripture that was made flesh because he was the messenger of their age and because the governor was not you know he was not having a flashy card order you know and anything flashy de that ball just he I mean he abuses pattern praise the Lord when the governor was right there to write out his pattern for him to go free and that's what will happen if you if we don't make use of the grease that has come to us the grace that has come come to us coming meet us in our state praise the Lord to rewrite our history to break our our alive from from from from curses help our children if we don't if we don't embrace this and justing that is another denomination is another church and and and and i mean it's the grace of god we should never be a shame of what god has given to us people are ashamed what they erase the ayah shame of the sx the a shame of everything the a shame of the appearance praise the Lord His grace is to take us from the house of shame to a house of testimony amen just like how God made the woman at the world her life at testimony and the Bible says she she brought many to the Lord Jesus Christ because she broke out of her house of Sheen the very house that one day was unashamed was now a house of testimony and I brought many to the Lord Jesus and God can do the same to you if we are involving ourselves in things that is making it a shame we better break out of that because it would just robbed you it would just rob you praise the Lord I mean it will rob you I mean it will it will make you just like that little boy nobody no he just he just jumped you know I mean he jumped up from down he ripped his his his paints nobody know that but I mean he's just eating by his shame until he's looking over his shoulder putting a fix on his face nobody knows what is happening but he's caught up into a mind of Sheen as soon as people turn their eyes see me look at their faces I mean the president never even seen what you are doing it's your own shame that is praise the Lord but there is a man yet I can turn on the light amen there's a man year that can break the curse there's a man year that can walk us out of the out of out of the house of shame praise the Lord when he identify himself to our age when he identified himself to allow this your church age he identified himself as they amen the one that has the final say he identified himself that you know no medical doctor or medical science can define your health situation he has the finest aim the society cannot define you know your life situation he has the final say on to the Church of loud they should speak Amen the Amen the faithful and true witness praise the Lord the God that we ever remain faithful has come in your age to prove faithfulness to you and he also identified himself the beginning of the creation of God now you see that's the reason why their prophet messenger could break back before time because the gift the identification of Jesus that was in this age was nothing less than the logos because the logos is the beginning of the creation of God when God was moving from internal spirit the great intent of God he found himself into the logos it was the logos that John testified for in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God it was the logos by him all things were created that's why the creating power could come back in our age because it's the identification of Jesus Christ in this age the beginning of the creation of God and you know what can also happen praise the Lord that creating power is here amen all things pass away behold all things I knew that creating power is here it's not in a shadow form like it was through or other ages musicians you can come praise the Lord people let's get to know the one that has come in our age let's get to know the one that is identified in our age praise the Lord if Jesus should take the clothes of a beggar will you be able to identify him well you can you be like see Martin I told his tall his coat and put it on that beggar in a night he had a dream he saw Jesus wearing a very same piece of coat that he pulled on the beggar [Music] praise the Lord [Music] sometimes we want them to you know come our church sometimes we want them to speak the same language we speak we have to realize that God changed his max through all the ages but his characteristics is the same and he's identified by his characteristics now by the changing of his max but by his characteristics [Music] there is nothing to be ashamed of we have a fountain that is filled with blood from amanwe vein we have a fountain in the house of David now we can go talk [Music] we don't have to be just like nominal Christian the Bible says if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us and we just think that a well you know Lord Jesus you know you know I've done this thing again I mean you you have to mean it [Music] sometimes we are so ashamed we so la Cotte in shame that we're not even able to talk to our maker you be able to put our self before him all I need a closer walk with you [Music] the closer work is not just a Sunday morning church the closer walk I mean it's a closer work you are in the Word of God you are in prayer that word is speaking back to you I mean you are God conscious and man that is God conscious is not ashamed because if he makes mistakes he knows to say God I'm sorry he's not ashamed he's God conscious he know he's not in a perfect body [Music] but the problem with our age is that we are too self-conscious and that has made us selfish we ought about ourselves I don't want somebody to say this about me and I want somebody to say that about me [Music] but the God of heaven and earth how to come and take our body form he had to come and take our body form to be identified for us just to bring us out of this house of shame he was tempted in
