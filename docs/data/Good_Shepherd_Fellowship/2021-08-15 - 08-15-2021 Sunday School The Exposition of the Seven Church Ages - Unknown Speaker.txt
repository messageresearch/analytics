TRANSCRIPT
========================================
john 4 1-4 and jude 3 4 and 12. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them antichrist spirit because greater is he god's spirit that is in you than he that is in the world jude 3 4 and 12. beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men not saints crept in unawares these have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds now then i think there is something else you want to know the seven churches which are addressed by john are in asia minor and are all gentile churches he does not speak to the church at jerusalem which was mostly jewish with perhaps just a few gentiles in it the reason is that god had turned from the jews to the gentiles thus the whole of the church ages is god dealing with the gentiles calling out a gentile bride to himself that makes the church ages and the fullness of the gentiles the one and the same thing acts 13 44-48 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed romans 11 1-8 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew what ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life but what sayeth the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day romans 11 25-29 for i would not brethren that ye be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance these seven churches located in asia minor contained certain characteristics within them at that ancient date which became the mature fruit of later ages what were just seed plants back there came out later in a mature harvest even as jesus said for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry luke 23 31 the message to the ephesian church age revelation 2 1-7 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and hast borne and has patience and for my name's sake hast labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have someone against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from once thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hate is the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god the messenger the messenger angel to the church of ephesus was the apostle paul that he was the messenger to the first age of the gentile era cannot be denied though to peter was granted the authority to open the doors to the gentiles it was given to paul to be their apostle and prophet he was the prophet messenger to the gentiles his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the gentiles authenticated him as their apostolic messenger to this agreed the other apostles at jerusalem galatians 1 12-19 for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversion in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord's brother galatians 2 2 and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain galatians 2 6-9 but of those who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man's person for they who seem to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrary wise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision romans 11 13 for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office paul founded the church at ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date of the beginning of the ephesian church age about 53 a.d his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future messengers were to aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of god though he would not attain to such heights in the prophetic realm as did paul paul's ministry had a threefold quality and was as follows first of all paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated from it no matter what the cost galatians 1 8-9 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed galatians 2 11 and 14. but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compels thou the gentiles to live as do the jews first corinthians 14 36-37 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord notice that paul was unorganized but spirit led as when god moved upon moses to lead israel out of egypt jerusalem's council never sent paul out nor did it have any power or jurisdiction over him god and god alone did the sending and the leading paul was not of men but of god galatians 1 1 paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead galatians 2 3-5 but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word first corinthians 2 1-5 and thy brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god acts 14 8-10 and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked the same heard paul speak who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked acts twenty nine through twelve and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted acts 28 7-9 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed second corinthians 12 12. truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds thirdly he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry second corinthians 12 11 i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commanded of you for a nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing first corinthians 9 2 if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye and the lord second corinthians 11 2 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ paul had been the means of bringing in multitudes of the gentile sheep he fed them and cared for them until they brought forth righteous fruit and were prepared to meet the lord as a part of the gentile bride at the time of the giving of the revelation according to tradition paul had already died a martyr but john was carrying on in his stead exactly as paul had done in the days of his ministry the death of paul before the revelation was given does not at all and all the fact that he was the messenger to the ephesian church age for the messenger to every age regardless of when he appears or goes is the one who influences that age for god by means of a word manifested ministry paul was that man the city of ephesus the city of ephesus was one of the three greatest cities of asia it was often called the third city of christian faith with jerusalem first and antioch second it was a very rich city the government was roman but the language was greek historians believe that john mary peter andrew and philip were all buried in this beautiful city paul who founded the true faith in this city pastored here only about three years but when he was absent from the flock he was continually prayerfully mindful of them timothy was its first bishop first timothy 1 1-3 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and lord jesus christ which is our hope unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightis charge some that they teach no other doctrine the very name ephesus has a strange compound meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less ardent following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of satan it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it had left its first love the tiny seed planted in that ephesian age would one day grow in the spirit of error until all foul birds of the air would roost in its branches so inoffensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to that new eve the new church that again she would be deceived by satan the ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for god's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment satan planted the seed of complete ruination the very religion of ephesus types out perfectly this first church age and sets the tenor of the ages to come in the first place the magnificent temple of diana that was so many years in building housed in its sacred courts the most lustrous and unobtrusive image of diana that one could imagine she was absolutely unlike any other of her images seated in the other temples dedicated to her she was simply an almost shapeless female figure that finally sunk into the block of wood from which she was carved and her two arms were formed of two simple bars of iron how perfectly this depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed in the first age there he was loosed in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people yet the two arms of iron bars showed that it was his intent to crush the work of god as he made his inroads and no one seemed to notice him or what he was doing but one day they would notice when with those arms of iron his deeds became doctrine and his doctrine became the law of an empire the order of temple service is also very revealing there were first of all priests who were eunuchs this sterile priesthood pressaged the sterility of a people who would drift from the word for a people who claim to know god apart from the word are as barren of life as is a sterile eunuch secondly the temple had within its confines the virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple this showed forth the day that ceremony and form ritual and works would take the place of the holy spirit and no longer would charismatic manifestation fill the temple of god over them all was the high priest a man of political power and public influence portraying what was already in progress though not too manifested that is the church would soon be given over to the leadership of man with man's plans and man's ambitions and thus saith the holy ghost would no longer be a living reality and underneath them all were the temple slaves who had no choice but obedience to the religious hierarchy what can this mean but the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering state help and the substitution of word and spirit for creeds dogmas and human leadership would enslave the laity while the leaders luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the poor people who were to be served according to god now became the servants jesus his messenger and churches revelation 2 1 these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks this is he of whom it is said this same jesus is both lord and christ there he is the one and only lord god almighty and beside him there is no other there he is the savior salvation is of the lord jonah 2 9 walking in the midst of the churches throughout the seven ages what he was in the first stage he is in all ages to every believer he is jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever what he did once he is still doing and will keep on doing now you will notice that jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches there is no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he is her lord and master she gives him all the glory and that glory he will not share with another there is no pope with him there is no archbishop with him mary the mother of his earthly body is not with him he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he does not turn to give orders to a holy spirit for he is god eternal spirit and it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the lord there was no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung upon the cross and gave his blood he is the author and finisher of our faith he is the alpha and omega of our salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him his word is law creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no effect on us yes it is jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is god in her willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you that is jesus and jesus alone there he is with the seven stars in his right hand the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of god psalms 44 3 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou had to favor unto them in that right hand of power are seven stars who according to revelation 1 20 are the seven church messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is his light they have no light of their own they kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their sparks isaiah 50 11 it is night for that is when the stars come out it is the night of the blackness of sin for all even the whole world have sinned and are constantly falling short of the glory of god romans 3 23 these seven messengers are making god known to the people he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them john 13 20 they speak and act upon his authority he stands behind them with all the power of godhead matthew 28 18-20 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world consummation of the ages so there they are full of the holy ghost and faith on fire with the fire of god holding forth the word of truth and there he stands to back them up and think of it not one believer of any age need cry in his heart oh that i might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were first sent out there is no need to look back look up behold him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages behold him who is the same yesterday and today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst and not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and giver of all good gifts to the church hallelujah who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as christ who is our life for christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious society a club a meaningless gathering of the people as a corpse bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last ages golden candlestick what he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in this last age jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever seven golden candlesticks in exodus 25 31 it says and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it but we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god hath spoken it but not only is the candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the sufferings that christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life christ praises his own revelation 2 2-3 i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and hast born in hast patience and for my name's sake hast labored and has not fainted how beautifully the savior praises and commands his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness amongst them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the lord he knows how to encourage us in the right manners and discourage us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that god deals with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not ungracious to forget your labors of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and blessing from the lord i know thy works thy labor and thy patience as he walks in the midst of his church he is aware of the suffering of his people and he cares as it was in the days of the captivity in egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks amongst them the very word labor signifies a weariness through oppression god's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient in bearing the yoke this first age suffered great persecution it had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth their high calling in life was to serve god and when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on earth i think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought [Music] you
