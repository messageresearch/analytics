he's he's so good to us thank you musicians that will be all for the music and uh praise the Lord it's good to have you so dear amen amen praise the Lord so last Sunday like we said uh uh Christian Fellowship over in DC had the the election for for the pastor after brother mirror went to be with the Lord I think they were in three years or so or a little more than that we filed a pastor so they were able to vote brother James uh amward in on Sunday and uh so this coming Sunday they want to place him in office and uh yeah they have asked that we come over and support them so I will be away and uh but today I will take the service for us pray for our brother praise the Lord and then so I was talking to brother James on Monday I called him to congratulate him and I knew that his dad was was also now well so I was also checking uh with him concerning the health of his dad he's pretty much dealing with the same Health situation I like brother Steve John Bibi he has a pancreatic cancer but he's more in a common like state so he's in the hospital so it's kind of a tough for our brother and so he asked that we pray for him and it's strange enough because I was driving over to see brother Steve John baby and they know both one another because they are from the same background with church there in Ghana so I want to see him and then now you know spending some time there then and just talking with him and and then uh you know when I got there he asked me to help him sit up and help him you know and he said we talking and then after he wanted for me to help him back into bed so why he lied there and uh and and dealing with with with all the the pains in his body I was sitting down and just looking and his daughter was also helping and uh and and the thought just hit me he's in the tender hands of Jehovah and then when I left left the house uh I you know I started strolling through my phone to look for I know I've preached his message many years back and then I started looking through my phone and I just bought the tender hands of Jehovah and I realized that uh it never came to me like the way they came to me just uh this go on Monday it was in the message that Exeter and that will be the only place that brother Brandon will use their phrase the tender hand of Jehovah so uh uh so then it kind of caught my attention and and in a way that it caught my attention is that it's an element for an Exeter in a way that he said it and I will read some of the statement to you so so then all through the week I just I'll just be looking at different different things uh uh in light with that uh uh statement the tender hand of Jehovah and uh uh he couldn't leave my mind it was not what I was talking so I thought I said okay I will pray about it and then we will speak we will speak on that uh on the first Sunday of October and let's let's pray may we we will be planning to have a convenience service on on the first Sunday of October so let's just put there before the Lord and so I thought I said well okay maybe I will talk about that but then all through the week I mean it was just the thought that was just going through my mind the tender hand of Jehovah and I was just looking at different things looking at the hand of the Lord through the scripture you know uh and then they just couldn't leave my mind I was I was here a couple of hours today just before service and and it just kept coming back to my mind I said well Lord okay maybe if if that's the only thing on my mind then that's the only thing I can talk about what is on my mind praise the Lord so then I went back and and I got a few few of uh the the quotes I were looking at today uh looking at through this week and then also uh uh got in he had an AXA brother uh Jordan to to get us a few uh photo as a slide that we would like to use tonight so just for a scripture reading let's just stand and then we will we will read Jeremiah chapter 18 reading from verse 1 to verse 6. Jeremiah chapter 18 reading from verse 1 to verse 6. praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 18 let's read from verse 1 the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to the Potter House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to the Potter House and and behold he wrote for work on the vessels and the vessel that he made of clay was marked in his hands in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel our same good to the porter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying O House of Israel cannot I do with you as this Porter say the Lord behold as the claim is in the hands in the porter hands so I hear in my hands O House of Israel praise the Lord amen Jeremiah 29 as the clitus in my hands in the hands of the Potter so I hear in my hands Jeremiah chapter 29. familiar verse 11. for I know the thoughts that are that I think towards you say the Lord thoughts of peace a man of evil to give you an expected end then called upon me and uh yes I go and prayed unto me and I will yaken unto you and he shall seek me and find me when yeh shall seek me seek for me with all your heart and I will be fond of you said the Lord and I will return away your captivity and will and will gather you from all the Nations all the denominations if we want to see their way and from all the places whether I have driven you said the Lord and I will bring you again into the place where Wayne's I cause you to be carried away captive let's pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord I can I can really say that this is a subject tonight Lord because I don't know how I got here but Lord as I just sat there Lord guarding and seeing our brother struggling in pain Slaughter this talk just struck my heart he's in the hands of the tender hands of Jehovah and father I pray to God that you will bless this prayer meeting tonight and the few things that we will say may they be blessing may it be and encouragement to your children Lord we love you we appreciate you father Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen go to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord so just like I said I went and then uh you know sometimes you are you are so consumed with a thought that you don't pay attention to certain details and but this time it came to me in a in a different way so that's what I would love to share with you tonight and uh man if you if you uh uh uh go and and read or play the message there actually you realize that brother Branham opened the service actually with a prayer and then he he made comments so uh uh then just before he will he would get to reading the word he decided to to pray it again and it was actually in that prayer that he made this statement so we will read that we'll read that together and then maybe that would just help us to be able to gather our thoughts yeah [Music] taxider he says I'm looking now by faith towards the coming something Lord upon the Earth that's going to draw that people together when we see the denominational churches Soul uh uh paying down and and getting so different is really pushing people out just as it was in Egypt a pharaoh Rising who knew near Joseph as it was in Germany up into Russia and Italy the people rise up uh he said Joseph Hitler Stanley Mussolini who hated the Jews they had to go back to their Homeland now you have to realize that under the seals but Brandon said it takes uh political pressure to take the Jews back to their Homeland but for the church it takes religious pressure praise the Lord so just as God will create a political pressure on on the people of Israel that was the same thing there in Egypt a pharaoh race of that they didn't know Joseph just to be able to fulfill the promise of a 400 year visitation and uh uh that that that is the same thing that it took in all of this but we we want to keep that in our mind because what is happening to them in the physical is happening the same is also happening to us in the spiritual praise the Lord amen he says in they had to go back to their Homeland God you you got ways of doing things that we don't understand and and you press them go home in Germany everything taken away from them also in italic Russian no place to go and they were sent back to their Homeland just to fulfill the word all the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer but is still it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children we thank you Lord praise the Lord amen I like to read that again before I continue how sometimes he says uh oh the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer but it's still praise the Lord the way people suffer the things we go through he said but it's still what a paradox praise the Lord amen but it's still the tender hand of Jehovah leading his children we thank you Lord I'm looking now by faith I think I'm repeating this yes I'm repeating it I will drop down now I pray God as I see the day that the denomination is pressing the believer as communicating then saying there their names must be upon their book and they are lost have nothing to do with uh with the other group is only the tender hand of Jehovah leading them to the Tree of Life the tenor hand of Jehovah was leading Israel to a Promised Land the hand of Jehovah is leading us to the tree of life which is the word praise the Lord so when those Trials come is to lead us back to the word are we together that's the place we can find our comfort that's the place we can gather strength that's the place our healing comes from are we together I pray God that each I know they will because it's your word it cannot fail and may we be led to the tree of life that we might be a possessor of internal life see the hand of God and by the eyes of it look Beyond this shadow that we are walking in today see the promised land line just ahead praise the Lord amen and then while he went on uh uh um he started preaching and he was gathering his thoughts and and then the thoughts struck him again he was actually talking about the terror Exeter but then as he went on talking they thought struck him again and he made the statement he says uh he says now you can see what we were speaking in prayer a few moment ago why did God have to hide in Pharaoh's heart to put the people back in the Promised Land before he could blessed him to bring forth the Messiah to them how how did he have to hide in Hitler's heart to be against the Jews when he was half Jews himself how could he have to do that Stanley messalonia see people that's not inspired not a nation God has to take and think that they are living by the lord of the land many times to make his promise comes true he had to harvest those detectors had to run the Jews back to the promised land it had to be that way praise the Lord amen so as I was thinking about that and uh just like I said I asked brought Jordan to just get a few slice of pictures here so we ask him to project that and then we will go into our thought tonight remember that this is just a prayer meeting now these are few photos from from the Holocaust and in in all that those Jews have to go through now see all of the you know the innocent faces of these babies that should be home playing with their friends praise the Lord now they were all set apart and they had to be put in trained they have to be separated from their parents and women away from their husband and all of that and yet a prophet is saying is the tender hand of Jehovah praise the Lord if you sit back and just think about this I don't know about you but as I thought about it I just sit back and just weeping praise the Lord because you see this is one thing to read black and white is the tender hand of Jehovah it's another thing to really be in the tender hand of Jehovah is one thing to read about his tender hands it's another thing to be in the hands of God the Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the Living God fearful not mostly in the sense of scaring it's fearful mostly in in a sense of is is a sacred thing like when the Bible says you are wonderfully and fearful in me are we together and all of these things that the people have to go through I mean I mean the the Jewish people had to go through I mean all of these uh uh family plans and uh uh preparing for for for birthday and uh yeah happy birthday Emmanuel you had your birthday yesterday and and all of that and then all of a facility things just change how to take them from their homes praise the Lord they have to be giving a certain identification your life will never be the same praise the Lord I was listening to a brother talking about this and he said uh he said I struggle with this he said I struggle with this when I heard people saying that there was the tender hand of Jehovah he said I struggle with it I struggle to to understand it to believe it right it's not that I doubt that the prophet but I just couldn't fight on me I couldn't put it together he said but when I went and listened to the message to Exeter and I listened to it again and I listened to it he says then God was gracious he came down and gave me a sense of understanding for me to be able to understand to look at this photo and say this is the tender hand of Jehovah praise the Lord are we together the Bible says uh in in in in the Book of Revelation the the the New Jerusalem uh was coming down like a bride a door for her husband do you have another one there brother Jordy just just go through just go through all of the ones you gather if that's the last one then we can get back to our subject here praise the Lord in future home who will read this now notice Jesus said as in John 14 go to prepare a place oh what will it looks like how did you ever think now right what will it looks like it's a uh it is prepared and designed by their Divine architect what will that City looks like now we are going to talk about it for a few minutes the Divine architect has prepared design it and look he designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride praise the Lord the same tender hands that hold us in the time of our trials and our our sicknesses and uh the difficult things we go through he's making us to realize he's the same tender hands that have built the New Jerusalem praise the Lord this great architect just like we look at the temple in this progression from the Tabernacle to the temple and even to ourself thus as it as as a tabernacle of the Living God realize that God was giving us a picture of how he would deal with us not only be with us but how he will come down endure in US praise the Lord amen how he would come down endure in US is is uh is uh is uh a rating and testify that in the Bible after Solomon dedicated the temple the the shakhana glory came down and and is still it stayed there it was it was not going and coming it rested right there in in the in the temple of Solomon because everything was in place and God was so pleased with the place until he came down and he endured and the people who see the glory of the Lord in the same way their fathers could see the the cloud by night and see the the the you know the the pillow the pillar of Fire by night and the cloud by day right in the Tabernacle there they could see the glory of God praise the Lord and the people that that witness uh uh uh uh the uh the outpouring uh at Azusa they will tell you that uh uh when William Simon came up and he started to sink the comforter has come the comforter has come I mean they were not running over the place they were now being loud they were just worshiping they would tell you that right in California you will see the place being milky you can feel the presence of God the glory of God will come down you will see a clown hanging in the building praise the Lord what was the Shekinah Glory it's now the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost to the believer praise the Lord whatever was that pillow of Fire by night is now the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost in The Believer are we together but you think about it yet think about what uh we are looking at here he says that uh the uh what would that City looks like we think about the New Jerusalem we think about uh uh acidic coming down and uh a place that we are looking forward to going he says you think about it in your mind that place is built by the great architect of God he says I go and prepare a place for you the same hand that have gone to prepare a place for you is the same hand that is preparing you to go to that place the Lord amen oh yeah we wonder we want the glory of that place we want to enjoy the place no more sickness no more pain but just like as he's preparing the place he should also prepare us prepare us to go to a prepared place because it's a prepared place for a prepared people are we together the tender hand of Jehovah it's hard to feel it it's hard to feel the tenderness of his hands when you are in pains or going through something and you can't explain it how can you feel tenderness in trials how can you explain tenderness when an Egyptian is taking a whip and whipping the Hebrew boy on his back how can you explain tenderness praise the lord it's a prayer meeting tonight so try not to keep you too long I'll just we just prepare you here it's I mean it's just it's just one of those things I mean your mind gets so filled with a thought and and it's just it just it just it just won't leave you praise the Lord how can we explain the tender hand of Jehovah that way but let's see what David said here are we together praise the Lord awesome Psalm chapter 119. Psalm chapter 119. let's read verse a 66 David said teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed thy commandment before I was afflicted I went astray but now have I kept that word meditate on that just for the meaning before I was afflicted I went straight and we wish me before you got a hold of me I was lost right my mind was now thinking right my life was not right but when you got a hold of me praise the Lord he says now I can keep your word now and I can walk in your statues before I was afflicted before I went through triers I was astray praise the Lord that's that's the reason why the prophet was says you are not in our right mind until we have the man of Christ right praise the Lord until we have the man of Christ Express there in the book of Philippians what the Bible says he taught it not Robert to be equal with God being God he suffered even to the death of the cross but that's the Eternal hand of Jehovah Isaiah said it pleased the Lord to see him striking they please the Lord and I believe that I say please the Lord in the bridegroom so it's also pleased the Lord in the bride when we are going through what God has allotted us to go through praise the Lord you know the truth of the matter there is Saints this picture will never come fully right to us until we get on the other side because no matter how much you think you understand it get in the fire it almost looks like when you're getting tires everything you know about Trial goes from your mind may I try us impatient love the Lord in try yours trial give you faith everything you know ever tried every virtue you know it almost looks like it goes from your mind and that Williamsburg we cry Lord what I've had done oh Lord what I've had done have mercy upon me forgiving all my sins you know then you want to be reap after I say again you want to you you just want to look through your life and it just it just almost looks like it's gone from our mind before hours of lectured I went astray are we together the tender hands of Jehovah their great architect is dealing with us the prophet said that's what the great Shepherd would do the shepherd comes reached down with tender hands and bring that little and bring that one safely in place it upon his shoulder and bring it safely back to the father he's using every key and every gentleness to bring us back to the Fort but to you and myself is horrible it's unbearable why me praise the Lord to the great Shepherd he's using every Tender Care to pick you up and put you upon his shoulder and take you safely back into his presence but with you and myself know we don't have no money we don't have no food nothing going right How can there be The Tender hands of Jehovah praise the Lord he says so pray the song we can't see the hands of God anymore than what we start looking for we start looking for you know uh uh uh family problem family curse we start looking for all sorts of things when it is just the lovely hand of God picking you up putting you on his shoulder the Bible says as the heaven is higher than the Earth so are his ways higher than our ways it's hard to it's hard to put it together because we would think the tender hands of Jehovah we will start to feel a a wind blowing when when there is no wind blowing we know that the angels are flopping their wings you know I could feel the breeze the Angels were moving their wings I mean I was lifted off of the ground I could feel myself suspending I was walking on the air that that is the way we think about it in our mind sure that's the way we want it oh how we enjoy Seth praise and self-glory self-gratification we enjoy those things but his thoughts are higher than our thoughts praise the Lord amen I don't know if I'm preaching tonight but uh I'm just sharing with you be not afraid I saw this thought also you know along when you are in the present alone when you are in the presence of Christ you always see miraculous things taking place that's the reason I love to live in his presence is to see his great tender hands going out to minister praise the Lord amen I would love to have walked with him in those days but I think today is maybe the greatest privilege because he's walking inside of us now everybody I'm talking about that kind of hand of Jehovah going to minister is he is his honor thy gift going to minister to the needs of the people when there are people that are having uh uh uh illnesses in their life what the devil is taking some right to stand there and he will go out the tender hands of Jehovah through vision will reveal what is their problem praise the Lord and is that same tender hands that comes through the preaching of the word it might look like a rebuke it makes us to feel uncomfortable praise the Lord that's the reason why the scripture says we can never stand God's judgment we must not even ask for the hand of the Lord we must not ask for him to lay his hands on us we must only ask him to pick us up praise the Lord no matter what we are going through he's only picking us up to bring us to a better place attend the hands of Jehovah I know every one of us has gone through one thing or the other praise the Lord and sometimes to the onlooker you just think wow that thing is not trying praise the Lord it's only not trial because you are not in it right it's only not a trial because you are not in it that's right wow they say what they call trial wow it's because you are not in it amen because when you are in a trial is is is is difficult it's difficult it takes time for it to hit you that this is a Triumph you you first don't see it as a try you see it that the whole world is against you everybody don't like you your whole world is crashing at you we don't see it I said try it I used to turn the hands of Jehovah the tender hands of Jehovah you you just think about that tender hand is picking us out dealing with us spiritually but look at those photos look at those people going through the gas chamber right how can you understand that in your mind to be the tender hand when he's the very God that deliver one man down there in the lion then give something such a great power to split a lion into two right for Social Power he opened the red seed you know how many how many good decent Christians theologians that that very thing has stumbled and they dropped their Bible they won't read it anymore they won't believe that God that has in his word and opening the Red Sea when he couldn't stop cruel-hearted man like Hitler he loved the Lord tonight try to bring this to a close so we can find some time to speak to the Lord tonight but just like I said brother Brandon is placing this within the tear Exodus he's associating this he's associating base with the first accident how their rose up a pharaoh that they didn't know Joseph praise the Lord amen and he will go back and talk about how even Joseph got into Egypt it was just jealousy of his brothers praise the Lord now that the Egyptians are Egyptians they are not Hebrews but before he could get to the Egyptians for for for the Hebrews to be punished by the Egypt right in the same house in the same family jealousy they got jealous and they decided to sell him right in the same family praise the Lord just like we were speaking on Sunday you see why they can cause a church if a people don't rightly discern the body of the Lord and they will just sit there with a lot of comparison in their mind you are not doing Justice to yourself you are not doing Justice to yourself because this is the place you call Church this is the place you come can you imagine what that would be like where you call home your parents are endlessly laboring and doing everything for you and then you feel so pleased with the neighbor's house and just look at your house as a trash and that's that very same trash you're going to sleep in praise the Lord if they would just realize that is going to carry them hundreds of years under slavery something that their children children will suffer from just one jealousy praise the Lord we know that's a word of God 400 years your people will so joined in The Strange Land we know that's the word of God they could not bypass it but you just think for the moment what it could have been if they would have rallied around Joseph and say oh wow just in the same house they are jealous around them over into Egypt into slavery then our year comes another Joseph again you you realize that all of those things is happening right under the end time spirit praise the Lord because you'll find bunch of these men that are having problems with the move of God the message of the hour it's just a spirit of jealousy many many of them has thought they will rise to that place now this gave us now for Brother Brad I'm alone but I call into God's plan it was just one man right right behold I send you Elijah there is no s it was not Elijah's praise the Lord just a spirit of jealousy that God will pick up an electric man with no education and every one of them with their degree will sit right back there he can highly pronounce his words good but yet they can see the demonstration of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord can you imagine what it was sitting down behind behind a prophet and he's telling people what is on their mind you're trying everything to be in your best behavior and brother Brown can say I can feed it some of you are doubting me can you imagine what it is to walk with a man that can just look in your life and tell you exactly the things you are doing how many of those Pentecostal preachers and even preachers around the message who have love to rush to that place where they can hold the people they can hold them hold their nose by their finger because they should just have a dream and somebody should just appear in that room to them now it's a divine revelation God has spoken to them I saw this brother is this I saw him in my dream praise the Lord well sometimes the dream gives you only a Cause and they don't give you the result praise the Lord are we together so among the brothers it was a spirit of jealousy over in Egypt it was now a pharaoh praise the Lord that they didn't know Joseph that they might regarded no spiritual dream do you know what would have happened to Egypt Egypt who have who have now been in Egypt if it was not because Joseph could interpret their dreams and he received the nation not only Egypt he said the present word his gift save the present word his gift was enough as Jesus on the cross of calvary explaining to them a year a seven year of surplus and seven years of farming praise the Lord but yet there will be a man that will raise up and despise they will despise the name who is Joseph those are all in days and there will be men that will raise up if God did not had a man in his hands to turn our heart back to the apostolic fathers praise the Lord some of us won't have the life that we have praise the Lord who will marry the wives that we might will not even raise the family that we have raised in church praise the Lord with all with all the truth that is given to us we are still struggling to compose ourselves Wilderness is still coming in and out of the church how much more that we did not have uh a Revere word so you see a spirit that is rising up to despise the gift that has brought us this Liberty it has to be part of the Exeter it was in the first Exeter it was in the second Exeter it has to be in our Exeter but you see there's going to be a little bride that is going to bear it she's not going to understand everything because when you are in the tender hands of Jehovah you don't understand everything you only believe that God is in control and you believe that he has the last word praise the Lord you will be a little bride that will that will that that would be gathered by the tender hand of Jehovah she would come under the Press the Lord brother Brandon says the church has always done its best under pressure she has always done is her best on the persecution praise the Lord sometimes they take our hardest trial to bring some of our best moments but you see it is not the moment that you that you would capture is the moment the heavens capture praise the Lord sometimes it takes hour hour hardest trial can you imagine going through something in a state of confusion praise the Lord be in a state of confusion and you just say oh God and sometimes that's the movement that heaven like haven't just captured that so the father is so beautiful oh may God give us Grace may God give us Grace and may God help us praise the Lord may he give us Grace help us as individuals help us as a family help us as a church because I mean that's the path that we we will have to go it will take the tender hand of Jehovah support us in the Promised Land praise the Lord sometimes we have a loved ones and I you know I've said this in a while brother John Bibi then his wife you know I've got to know them when I got here and uh here in order you I was I was I was very fond of him because it looks like at a certain at a certain point of time it looks like uh we were we were we were chasing one another because you know he was living here in Brooklyn Center and I've you know sometimes I will come come from work and just and just come come right in there and I will you know find him right here just just praying and lifting different things to the Lord and you know and sometimes he will wish that I don't see him praise the Lord and uh but I'll tell you he's doing okay amen he's uh his body going through a lot of pains it's hard to witness you know that's that's that's what the human body cannot handle you know when you see a loved one the one that you love and you are just at a place where there is nothing you can do there is just nothing Himalayan that you can do even if you choose to change places humanly it can never be done praise the Lord and sometimes it's not only that person that is in the tender hand of Jehovah even you yourself you are in the tender hand of Jehovah because God is using that situation to work on you musicians you can come tonight praise the Lord thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] not just by our house together tonight [Music] what you see this is it's it's glorious and it's pressure very precious [Music] we might go through a state of confusion most of the time that's the first state you you are in a state of confusion you can really identify yourself you can identify why these things are happening you can identify who is the cause and you are just in a state of confusion [Music] but almighty God will take us through another state where he will come around and and try to reassure us he will come and bring some comfort even though he might not take the pain away but you you bring he will just bring a sense of comfort he will set that in tears what comes from your eyes and and you will remember the thing that the Lord has done and how the Lord has been good and how the Lord has been merciful and you will think about all of those things and you were just weak it still does not taste the pain away it does not change the situation [Music] imagine how many nights those Jewish men they met together and they argue they will not even want to hear the name about Jehovah don't talk about Yahweh don't remind us about about our arrested to them there is nowhere to put those stories together [Music] but the Apostle Paul will come to you and myself he will say blindness happened to Israel foreign his people so the gospel can come to you and myself [Music] to know that we are in the tender hands of Jehovah no matter what what's what's going on what's what's happening in our lives if we can just want to recognize that if we can just when it come to the place and surrounded ourself if we can just only just just just get a grip of him just try to hold him Lord if I'm in your tender hands I want to hold you tight I want to have something to hold on can I hold [Music] to can I hold to him I want to give you an embrace [Music] I don't understand it Lord but I know it is the tender hands of Jehovah Jehovah I know your thoughts towards me not the thoughts of evil how can it not be the thoughts of evil when evil things are happily how can it not be the talks of evil but yet to God is not the thoughts of evil is to bring us to unexpected hand all Church God has had this assembly in his tender hands the Taylor hands of Jehovah has held this church and I don't care what you think I don't care what you're watching what what your mindset is and what you think but I know that we are in the hands of God I know that he's he he's taking us from one place and he's bringing us to another place it might not make sense to you it does not make sense to me about our last same thing about our family what a beautiful thing but Brandon would demonstrating he would talk about his two girls
