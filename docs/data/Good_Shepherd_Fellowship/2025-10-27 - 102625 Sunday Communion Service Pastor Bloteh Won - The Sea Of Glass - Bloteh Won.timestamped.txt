[58:13] works, Lord God Almighty, just in truth.
[58:17] either ways. Thou king of saints
[58:24] glorify
[58:29] all nations worship.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And after that I looked and behold the
[58:39] temple
[58:40] of the tabernacle of the testimony in
[58:43] heaven was open.
[58:48] temple.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And one of the four beasts
[59:02] gave unto the seven angels, seven
[59:06] bowling bars full of the wrath of God
[59:09] who live forever and ever. And the
[59:13] temple was filled with smoke from the
[59:16] glory of God and from the power that no
[59:19] man was able to enter into the temple
[59:23] till the seven or the seven.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may have your
[59:30] seat. So we see here uh in uh in verse
[59:34] two, and I saw as it were a sea of glass
[59:40] mingled with fire. This morning we
[59:42] talked about a seat of glass like
[59:44] crystal and uh and and yet here we see
[59:48] that the seat of glass is here again
[59:51] with fired.
[59:53] So something different is going on
[59:56] tonight and I just thought that we can
[59:58] we run through that quickly and uh and
[1:00:01] then we change the order of the service.
[1:00:04] So we still talking about a seed of
[1:00:06] glass and uh which uh from the Old
[1:00:10] Testament it was a sea of brass uh uh
[1:00:13] but in the New Testament uh uh yet it's
[1:00:17] called the sea of glass and before the
[1:00:19] throne it was uh like crystal clear like
[1:00:23] crystal praise the lord
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; and yet we see now we have another we
[1:00:29] have the seed of glass here that is
[1:00:31] mingled up with fire now listen to verse
[1:00:34] too, then you would get the picture. You
[1:00:37] get the picture if you if you just uh
[1:00:39] follow it a little bit. And I saw as it
[1:00:42] were a sea of glass mingled with fire.
[1:00:46] And them that had gotten the victory
[1:00:49] over the beast. Them that have gotten
[1:00:52] the victory over the beast. This is the
[1:00:55] beast system. Amen. That's the beast
[1:00:57] system of Revelation chapter 17 18, 13,
[1:01:01] 17, 18. those that have gotten uh power,
[1:01:05] victory over the beast and over his
[1:01:08] image
[1:01:10] and over his mark which is those that
[1:01:14] overcome the mark of the beast. So with
[1:01:17] that reading the setting tell us here
[1:01:20] this is after the tribulation.
[1:01:25] You get the picture. Amen. Because these
[1:01:28] ones right here uh they have gotten
[1:01:31] victory over the beast and over his
[1:01:33] image and over his mark and over the
[1:01:38] number of his name. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Now we have overcome that
[1:01:45] by the knowledge of the word. Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; We know what it is.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there will be a people
[1:01:54] that will literally go through
[1:01:57] experiencing resisting the mark of the
[1:02:00] beast and uh and and I think they are
[1:02:04] the one that are in the picture here.
[1:02:06] Are we together?
[1:02:09] So uh uh they overcome the image, they
[1:02:12] overcome his mark, they overcome the
[1:02:14] number of his name
[1:02:16] and stand on the sea of br the sea of
[1:02:20] glass. Sorry. Having
[1:02:23] the halves of God. Are we together?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh that's that's what we want
[1:02:31] to look at. There were there were a few
[1:02:32] things we left this morning. This was
[1:02:34] part of our our morning exitation. So,
[1:02:39] we just want to go right back there
[1:02:40] quickly. I told the
[1:02:44] uh the young people to to get back to my
[1:02:46] notes. So, let's let's take up uh
[1:02:49] Revelation chapter 4, throne of mercy.
[1:02:51] If you look at the arrangement, they are
[1:02:53] having one, two. So, uh this morning we
[1:02:56] read one. So this evening, let's let's
[1:02:59] go let's take two of of that quote and
[1:03:02] let's let's read. Now I saw as it was a
[1:03:06] sea of glass mingle with fire. That's
[1:03:09] that's that's what that's that is the
[1:03:11] attraction here this morning. The
[1:03:13] attraction was the sea of glass like
[1:03:16] crystal
[1:03:18] this evening. The attraction is the sea
[1:03:20] of glass that is mega with fire. That's
[1:03:24] what we want to look at. And now, and
[1:03:28] they that had gotten the victory over
[1:03:31] the beast, and over his image, and over
[1:03:33] his mark, and over the over the number
[1:03:35] of his name, stood on the seat of glass,
[1:03:39] having halves of God, and they sang the
[1:03:41] song, they sang the song of Moses, the
[1:03:44] servant of God. Oh,
[1:03:48] do you see it? Tribulation period. Now,
[1:03:52] one of the thing also too that will help
[1:03:54] us to be able to bring it into context
[1:03:57] when you go back to verse one, I saw
[1:03:59] another angel. I saw another sign in
[1:04:02] heaven. Great and marvelous. Seven angel
[1:04:05] having the last seven plagues.
[1:04:08] Amen. Having the last seven plagues
[1:04:11] filled with the wrath of God. So, it's a
[1:04:13] period of judgment. It's a time of
[1:04:16] judgment.
[1:04:17] Plagues, wrath of God, a time of
[1:04:20] judgment. So that gave us gave us a
[1:04:23] picture here. So you see here that in
[1:04:26] this time of judgment in this time of
[1:04:28] tribulation there is one thing that is
[1:04:30] going to bring these people out.
[1:04:34] They are going to have the sea of the
[1:04:37] sea of glass mixed with fire. Why mess
[1:04:41] with fire?
[1:04:45] Because there is no blood.
[1:04:51] Because there is no blood. What has
[1:04:53] happening here in the real context? The
[1:04:55] rapture has already taken place.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; So there is no blood.
[1:05:02] So which mean they have to go through it
[1:05:08] by the testimony of their faith.
[1:05:11] They have to stand for what they know is
[1:05:13] right.
[1:05:14] And you see the thing about it then is
[1:05:16] there are the uh uh uh there are there
[1:05:19] are there are hundreds millions of
[1:05:22] people out there. You see just like the
[1:05:24] time of Elijah those sons of the prophet
[1:05:26] knew that Elijah was going to be
[1:05:28] raptured
[1:05:30] but they were not part of the rapture.
[1:05:33] They told Elisha and you know yourself
[1:05:36] your your master will be taken away.
[1:05:41] And so there are many many uh uh people
[1:05:44] good Christians that are that are that
[1:05:46] are uh believing the rapture. We know
[1:05:49] the phenomenon that took place there in
[1:05:50] South Africa with bunch of people
[1:05:52] claiming the hell and say the rapture
[1:05:54] was going to take place sometime in in
[1:05:55] September. And so there are many people
[1:05:58] that they get different concept and
[1:05:59] different teaching of the rapture. And
[1:06:01] in the midst of that there are also good
[1:06:05] uh people living
[1:06:08] dedicated clean decent Christian life.
[1:06:12] But you see they have now been exposed
[1:06:14] to the message of the hour like you have
[1:06:17] been.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:21] I I I don't think I don't think any one
[1:06:23] of us that have come under the message
[1:06:24] of the hour must desire to go through
[1:06:27] this
[1:06:29] because you have access to the blood.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; You have access to the bleeding word.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; You have access to a word that can be
[1:06:38] able to deliver you, that can be able to
[1:06:40] cleanse you, that can be able to to help
[1:06:43] you to overcome whatever we are dealing
[1:06:45] with.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; We have a word.
[1:06:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; But you see this now is for this group
[1:06:56] of people.
[1:06:59] They have never have access to this
[1:07:01] great truth,
[1:07:06] but they know enough Bible truth.
[1:07:11] Amen. To be able to resist the beast
[1:07:14] system.
[1:07:20] Are we together?
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; When we saw our representation this
[1:07:27] morning, our representation was in the
[1:07:31] the the the the
[1:07:34] four beasts around the throne. That's
[1:07:37] our representation.
[1:07:40] Amen.
[1:07:43] That's our representation. There's a
[1:07:45] brother that sent out pastor sent out a
[1:07:47] quote this morning and where brother
[1:07:48] Brand says uh uh you know he's talking
[1:07:51] about uh I'm standing he says I'm
[1:07:53] standing behind the pit with the Bible
[1:07:56] open. He says the closest place to
[1:07:58] heaven.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; This message has come to bring us into
[1:08:09] heavenly places.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You see, so our position, our
[1:08:17] representation is the sea of glass
[1:08:22] like crystal.
[1:08:26] That's our place.
[1:08:30] So this uh this the this this anointing,
[1:08:34] let me say it that way. His anointing
[1:08:36] are here to influence us to look at the
[1:08:40] sea of glass.
[1:08:42] Don't look at what people are saying at
[1:08:45] about you, but look at the sea of glass.
[1:08:47] See your reflection. See what reflection
[1:08:49] God have in his word for you.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. another group of people that are
[1:09:01] going to to stand on the seat of glass,
[1:09:04] mingle with fire.
[1:09:11] Are we together?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Let me let me just show you uh a little
[1:09:18] bit here. Um uh
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; you love the Lord.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] Amen.
[1:09:43] And uh
[1:09:58] let me just uh let me let me show you
[1:10:00] something here that will that will kind
[1:10:02] of bring it out a little bit.
[1:10:22] Now you remember Paul
[1:10:24] Paul was speaking
[1:10:30] Paul was speaking over in uh uh uh
[1:10:38] speaking to uh
[1:10:43] the Corinthians.
[1:10:45] Uh
[1:10:51] let me u sorry this just came to my
[1:10:56] mind. So let me see if I can uh just get
[1:11:00] right in there and see if uh Okay. 1
[1:11:04] Corinthians chapter 3. 1 Corinthians
[1:11:07] chapter 3.
[1:11:11] First Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:11:26] Let's read from verse nine quickly. For
[1:11:28] we are laborers together with God. Ye
[1:11:32] are God's husbandry.
[1:11:35] Ye are God's building. Now remember we
[1:11:38] were talking about maker and builder.
[1:11:39] Abraham looking for the city maker and
[1:11:41] builder.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; So he's saying that you are God's
[1:11:45] building. So u uh uh verse 10. according
[1:11:50] to the grace of God which is given unto
[1:11:54] me
[1:11:55] as a wise master builder. I have laid
[1:11:58] the foundation and another man buildeth
[1:12:01] there on. Let but let every man take
[1:12:04] heed how he buildth their own. For
[1:12:08] another for other foundation can no man
[1:12:12] lay
[1:12:13] than that is laid which is Jesus Christ.
[1:12:17] Paul in Hebrews said Abraham was looking
[1:12:19] for the city that had a foundation.
[1:12:21] Amen. So that foundation is Jesus
[1:12:23] Christ.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And uh so let's look at this now. Every
[1:12:30] man works shall be made manifest.
[1:12:34] For the day shall declare it, because it
[1:12:37] shall be revealed by fire,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and the fire shall try every man work of
[1:12:46] what sought it is.
[1:12:48] Praise the Lord. Listen to this now. If
[1:12:52] any man work a bond which he have built
[1:12:56] there on, he shall receive a reward. If
[1:12:59] any man work shall be burned, he shall
[1:13:04] suffer lust, but he himself shall be
[1:13:08] saved, yet so as by fire. So I we will
[1:13:13] get back to the glass being up with fire
[1:13:15] because that's what is taking place
[1:13:17] here. Whatever he was doing, if it is
[1:13:20] not according to the plan of God, it
[1:13:22] will be lost.
[1:13:24] But he will be saved by fire.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, so let's let's watch now and
[1:13:32] see here
[1:13:34] uh verse 16. Know ye now that ye are the
[1:13:38] temple of God and that the spirit of God
[1:13:39] dwelt in you? If if uh
[1:13:45] if any man
[1:13:50] Where am I?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:02] Okay. If any man uh uh
[1:14:14] if any man defy the temple of God, he
[1:14:16] shall be destroyed. For the temple of
[1:14:20] God is holy. Which temple ye are?
[1:14:24] Are we together?
[1:14:37] Okay.
[1:14:40] Okay. Just stay just stay right there
[1:14:42] with me.
[1:14:43] Just stay right there with me.
[1:14:46] And
[1:15:00] just stay right there with me. Uh
[1:15:04] now, so Paul here
[1:15:08] is trying to bring something out that
[1:15:10] that will kind of explain this thing
[1:15:12] that we want to look at. Uh let's look
[1:15:15] at uh
[1:15:18] uh chapter 12.
[1:15:26] No, chapter 3. Sorry. 1 Corinthians
[1:15:29] chapter 3. Is that where we were reading
[1:15:31] just?
[1:15:33] How did I jump over this?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, I jump over verse 12. That is
[1:15:39] verse 12 I was looking for. Sorry.
[1:15:42] Let's read verse 11 again. For on the
[1:15:44] foundation can no man lay
[1:15:47] then that is laid which is Jesus Christ.
[1:15:51] Verse 12. For if any man build upon this
[1:15:54] foundation, gold, silver and precious
[1:15:56] stones. Now gold, silver and precious
[1:15:59] stones are God-given.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. So Paul is saying if any man build
[1:16:08] using God's gift,
[1:16:13] Fire cannot consume gold. It makes it
[1:16:15] brighter.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Fire purify silver.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Fire purify precious stones. They are
[1:16:25] godgiving.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And then he says that uh any man go
[1:16:34] savor precious stones but wood wood is
[1:16:37] manmade. Men cut down the tree and make
[1:16:40] wood.
[1:16:44] Men make hill.
[1:16:46] Amen. Men make stables.
[1:16:50] So what Paul is doing here is that he
[1:16:52] says every man work will be tried
[1:16:55] whether it's of God or is of man. If it
[1:16:58] is of man, the fire of God will burn the
[1:17:02] wood.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; It will turn to ashes.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; The man will will lost the the the
[1:17:11] labor.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; But he will be saved by fire.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the concept?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing it?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; So that that is that is the place where
[1:17:26] h as we look at this uh uh uh sea of
[1:17:31] glass may go with fire. uh uh uh it it
[1:17:35] help us to be able to see that brother
[1:17:37] Brandham is saying these people come
[1:17:39] through the tribulation. The people that
[1:17:41] came through the tribulation that will
[1:17:43] come through the tribulation most of
[1:17:45] them will be people of this kind that
[1:17:49] are doing the work of God never being
[1:17:52] able to grab the move of God of their
[1:17:54] day. Never being able to see the message
[1:17:56] of the hour but they love God. They they
[1:17:59] are winning. So they they are doing
[1:18:01] things for the kingdom of God.
[1:18:04] Are we together?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Were not able to make the bride to make
[1:18:09] the rapture
[1:18:12] and suddenly they realized they left
[1:18:14] here.
[1:18:17] But yet that that zero of God is in
[1:18:19] their heart and they know that no I will
[1:18:21] not give into the mark of the beast. I
[1:18:23] will not I will stand for God. If I have
[1:18:25] to die, let me die.
[1:18:30] Are you seeing it?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; So they will have to go through the
[1:18:35] fire. They will have to go through the
[1:18:37] tribulation
[1:18:39] and then they come on the other side
[1:18:41] standing on the word of God, standing on
[1:18:45] the sea of glass. But it was me God with
[1:18:48] fire.
[1:18:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You and myself have the privilege
[1:18:54] to stand on the seed of glass
[1:18:58] like crystal.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It's like crystal. A prophet is is
[1:19:03] LETTING US TO LOOK INSIDE and see what
[1:19:06] is there.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; A prophet comes AND TELL YOU THAT GOD
[1:19:11] TOOK A picture of you.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:19] You know, way false says something one
[1:19:22] time. He says he says uh
[1:19:27] he says I'm glad that he choose me
[1:19:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:31] because if he was see me now he would
[1:19:32] change his mind.
[1:19:37] Praise the Lord. We know that God don't
[1:19:39] change his mind. But uh you know it's a
[1:19:43] kind of a himorous statement with lot of
[1:19:46] gratitude in it.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; You see so and and the reason why we
[1:19:56] saying that is not just to bring you a
[1:19:58] knowledge of the word is for us to
[1:20:00] realize what a privileged people we are.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; We can't sit around and play church.
[1:20:10] with all of these truth that has been
[1:20:12] given to us. We can't you can't sit
[1:20:14] around and place church.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; We sit right in church and then we we we
[1:20:23] are in church but yet we are
[1:20:24] backsliding.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; We don't have a prayer life. We don't
[1:20:30] have a a response to the word. We are
[1:20:32] just there.
[1:20:35] Brother says if we just knew how many
[1:20:37] people are are perishing right in the
[1:20:39] pills.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; So to to to realize the privilege that
[1:20:48] we have
[1:20:50] this anointing comes message after
[1:20:53] message and say look look into the
[1:20:55] crystal see your REFLECTION SEE WHAT GOD
[1:20:58] thinks about you see what God you know
[1:21:00] what what what he says about you. Let me
[1:21:02] read this and then I get out of this.
[1:21:03] Amen. So you so you seen the picture.
[1:21:07] You see what makes the difference.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. What makes the seed of glass with
[1:21:11] fire and while the other one revelation
[1:21:14] 4 is crystal. Amen. You see the
[1:21:17] difference. One is before the
[1:21:19] tribulation. One is after the
[1:21:21] tribulation. That's the picture I wanted
[1:21:23] to bring to you tonight. Let's let let's
[1:21:25] let me read this and then uh uh we close
[1:21:28] here. You love the Lord.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, church.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure I'm not uh preaching
[1:21:39] alone and everybody is at home. I think
[1:21:41] I can see people here.
[1:21:43] Sit on Ed and see what brother B says
[1:21:45] here. He says uh they were saved in
[1:21:49] God's pavilion. They were alive. They
[1:21:53] had no death around them. Hallelujah.
[1:21:57] They had perfect love one for another.
[1:22:00] Perfect life forever.
[1:22:03] They had perfect love, perfect
[1:22:06] understanding of the love of God. That's
[1:22:08] that's that's what I wanted to strike
[1:22:10] down this evening. Perfect understanding
[1:22:12] of the love of God. What is that perfect
[1:22:15] understanding?
[1:22:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:19] Perfect understanding of God's love.
[1:22:23] What is that perfect understanding?
[1:22:25] That's what God has given to us. He has
[1:22:28] given us a perfect understanding of his
[1:22:30] love.
[1:22:32] What is that perfect understanding?
[1:22:36] That God love is elective.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; God don't love you based on what you do.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And there is nothing you can do for his
[1:22:52] love to change.
[1:22:54] What what we struggle with is is the
[1:22:59] effect of our wrong choices.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It it has affected us.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; So we don't we we we cannot we cannot uh
[1:23:12] measure it up with God's love. So we
[1:23:16] think he don't love us.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:21] before while we were yet sinners, Christ
[1:23:23] died for us.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; That is the understanding of his love
[1:23:29] that his love is elective.
[1:23:35] the whole the whole book of Malachi
[1:23:37] that's how it's it opens God trying to
[1:23:40] tell Israel that I love you and they are
[1:23:42] saying HOW DO YOU LOVE US THAT WE HAVE
[1:23:44] TO GO INTO CAPTIVITY WE LOST EVERYTHING
[1:23:47] AND HOW DO YOU LOVE US HE said he said
[1:23:49] Jacob and Esau before each one were born
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Jacob I love Esau I hate
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; so his love was election
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; God's Love is election.
[1:24:07] That is the understanding of his love.
[1:24:11] It does not have to do with anything of
[1:24:13] your behavior. You cannot impress him.
[1:24:16] You cannot discourage him. He have seen
[1:24:18] a whole lot.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:33] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; A perfect understanding of his love.
[1:24:39] When you understand that, when you
[1:24:42] understand,
[1:24:44] when you understand that it is his love
[1:24:52] that he love you so much that he look
[1:24:55] you look at millions and trillions of
[1:24:58] people on this earth
[1:25:02] and he pass your way to bring you the
[1:25:05] knowledge of Malachi for
[1:25:09] There is nothing. There is nothing
[1:25:13] that you can see yourself right in the
[1:25:15] scripture. Behold, I send you.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You are that one.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you. If you were not yet,
[1:25:23] God will not send Elijah.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason of God sending Elijah
[1:25:30] is because there is a people on the
[1:25:32] earth.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:39] If we will be able to understand his
[1:25:41] love,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; his love of election.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why he could
[1:25:57] predestinate
[1:26:00] before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:07] So once again, it's just it's just to be
[1:26:09] able to, you know, sometimes, you know,
[1:26:12] it's it's is not to to our our you know,
[1:26:16] our best judgment. Sometimes we now, you
[1:26:18] know, we're not happy about it or or
[1:26:20] whatever it is. But you have you have to
[1:26:22] realize that uh you know uh uh God God
[1:26:26] has a picture uh in his mind where he
[1:26:28] want to bring his church. He says that
[1:26:30] he will get himself a church without
[1:26:32] spot or without wrinkle.
[1:26:34] Brother Brandon says when the power of
[1:26:36] of God come back to the church, it will
[1:26:38] not be on the people's effort.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; It will not be on your effort is because
[1:26:46] God says he would get a people. He will
[1:26:49] make sure that he get a people.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; The blessing there is that uh uh uh uh
[1:26:59] we rejoice that that he have opened our
[1:27:02] eyes and and we want TO BE A PART OF
[1:27:04] WHAT HE'S DOING.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT AND LORD I
[1:27:08] WANT TO BE A PART.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Because you have to realize that he can
[1:27:15] do without you.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; He can do without you. He can patch you
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; and drop you like a dead clo
[1:27:32] just having a grateful spirit.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Waking up with a grateful spirit.
[1:27:40] Not looking at your achievement but
[1:27:42] looking at what he has done.
[1:27:48] Until this become real to us,
[1:27:53] our walk with God is just around the
[1:27:56] block.
[1:27:58] But if you want to take a walk just like
[1:28:00] Enoch walked with God.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You want to take a walk
[1:28:05] like Enoch walked with God.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can you can argue whether he
[1:28:13] have wives and children or not, but I
[1:28:16] know that as he walked with God, he knew
[1:28:18] that even if he have wife and children,
[1:28:20] God would take care of them. Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; He was not he was not worried. He was
[1:28:26] not bothered. I mean, it was just it was
[1:28:29] just this gratefulness
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; that the creator of heaven and earth
[1:28:32] would say, "Come and take a walk with
[1:28:34] me."
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Then I would turn around and say, "No,
[1:28:36] you know, my I my children are small. I
[1:28:39] need to bring them up. Oh, I I I have a
[1:28:41] wife to get married. My, you know, I get
[1:28:43] jobs and will make all of the excuses.
[1:28:45] Brother Brandham say a life full of
[1:28:47] excuses is not worthy of the gospel.
[1:28:56] Musicians, you can come.
[1:29:02] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:29:04] Let's thank him. Let's thank him for
[1:29:06] being very mindful of us, for expressing
[1:29:11] his love to us,
[1:29:14] for bringing us before the seat of glass
[1:29:17] like crystal.
[1:29:20] That's the word you must be able to see
[1:29:21] yourself here.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; If you see yourself, then why are you
[1:29:26] getting mad?
[1:29:29] If you really seeing yourself, why
[1:29:31] should you get mad?
[1:29:35] Not even seeing yourself like the way
[1:29:37] you are, but seeing yourself like the
[1:29:39] way God sees you.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; When you look in the sea of glad, you
[1:29:44] don't see yourself like the way you are.
[1:29:46] You don't see your flaws and your
[1:29:47] struggle. You see the grace that he have
[1:29:50] put upon you.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know what happened
[1:29:55] that that that evening when Esther broke
[1:29:58] out of praying? You know what she did?
[1:30:00] She went and took the very gown she got
[1:30:02] wed in. Praise the Lord. The gown that
[1:30:06] she wore that the king saw her that was
[1:30:08] the very gown she took and she wore. The
[1:30:11] Lord says nobody go until the king go.
[1:30:14] She said the Lord for the people out
[1:30:15] there not for me.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When she stepped forth,
[1:30:21] the king said, "Where have you been?"
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Where have you been?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Guys,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; CASE CLOSE." WHATEVER WE WERE TALKING,
[1:30:33] somebody remind me tomorrow everybody go
[1:30:35] home.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Dismiss.
[1:30:52] Oh, we are blessed people.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; We have blessed people.
[1:30:58] Oh, we are blessed people. That's uh
[1:31:15] he was wounded for my transgression.
[1:31:23] Just play that softly.
[1:31:47] Surely
[1:32:00] he bore
[1:32:03] my sorrow.
[1:32:06] Oh yes.
[1:32:09] And by his tri
[1:32:15] I was
[1:32:20] Oh, he was holy
[1:32:25] for my
[1:32:28] transgression.
[1:32:34] He was bruised
[1:32:37] for my
[1:32:40] iniquity.
[1:32:46] Oh, surely
[1:32:49] he
[1:32:52] all my sorrow
[1:32:58] and by his right.
[1:33:03] I was
[1:33:06] 1 Corinthians chapter 11. For I have
[1:33:09] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:33:11] deliver unto you, that the Lord Jesus
[1:33:14] the same night in which he was betrayed,
[1:33:16] took bread, and when he had given
[1:33:19] thanks, he break it and said, "Take,
[1:33:21] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:33:24] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:33:28] After the same manner also he took the
[1:33:31] cup when he have sed saying this cup is
[1:33:35] the new testament of my blood. This do
[1:33:39] ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:33:42] of me. For as often as he eat the bread
[1:33:45] and drink this cup do show the Lord's
[1:33:49] death till he come.
[1:33:51] Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread,
[1:33:54] eat this bread, and drink this cup of
[1:33:56] the Lord unwartiling, shall be guilty of
[1:33:59] the body and the blood of the Lord.
[1:34:05] But let a man examine himself. How do we
[1:34:08] do it? How do we examine ourself?
[1:34:11] You can examine yourself.
[1:34:14] You examine yourself by looking at your
[1:34:17] sacrifice.
[1:34:20] Let a man examine himself, and so let
[1:34:22] him eat of that bread, and drink of the
[1:34:25] cup. For he that eatth and drinketh
[1:34:27] unwartily, eat it and drink damnation to
[1:34:30] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:34:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:41] St. John,
[1:34:45] St. John chapter 13.
[1:34:48] Let's just take our scriptures tonight
[1:34:52] so we can go right right into what we
[1:34:55] are here for tonight. Let's read from
[1:34:56] verse two. And supper being ended, the
[1:34:59] devil having now put in the heart of
[1:35:02] Judas as Simon's son to betray him.
[1:35:05] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:35:08] all things into his hands and that he
[1:35:11] was come from God and went to God. He
[1:35:14] rises from supper and lay aside his
[1:35:18] garment and took a tower and g himself.
[1:35:20] After that he pou water in a basin and
[1:35:23] begin to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:35:26] wet them with the tower wherewith he he
[1:35:29] was g. Then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[1:35:33] And Peter said unto him, Lord, does thou
[1:35:35] wash my feet? Jesus answer
[1:35:38] him.
[1:35:40] Jesus answered and said unto him, what
[1:35:42] what I do, thou knowest not now, but
[1:35:46] thou shalt know here after. Peter said
[1:35:49] unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.
[1:35:52] Jesus answered, If I wash thee now, thou
[1:35:55] have no part with me. Simon Peter said
[1:35:58] unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
[1:36:00] also my hands and my head. Jesus said to
[1:36:04] him, he that is washed needeth not safe
[1:36:08] to wash his feet, but is clean
[1:36:11] everywhere. And yay, I clean, but not
[1:36:14] all. For he knew who should betray him.
[1:36:18] Therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.
[1:36:21] So after he have washed their feet and
[1:36:24] has taken his garment
[1:36:27] and was set down again, he said unto
[1:36:29] them, "Ye call, ye know what I have done
[1:36:31] to you. You call me master the Lord,
[1:36:36] and ye say well, for so I am. If I then
[1:36:39] your Lord a master has washed your feet,
[1:36:42] there also ought to wash one another
[1:36:45] feet.
[1:36:47] For I have given you an example
[1:36:51] that ye should do as I have done to you.
[1:36:54] Verily, verily, I said unto you, the
[1:36:57] servant is not greater than his law,
[1:37:00] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:37:03] that sent him. If you know these things,
[1:37:06] happy are you if you do them. Amen.
[1:37:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:13] Let's bow our heads.
[1:37:23] iniquity.
[1:37:27] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:30] Christ, we lift this bowl up to you
