[4:20] age, a certain thing to happen. And we
[4:23] find out that it happened just exactly
[4:25] like it. And he said that he would do
[4:27] because he's rich in his mercy to always
[4:30] have mercy to fulfill every word that he
[4:33] has promised. He has to do it and always
[4:35] in order to stay
[4:37] God. Always he does this. His word
[4:40] always comes to pass in its season. His
[4:43] seed that he has sold into the earth,
[4:45] what did he do? He put it here in the
[4:46] word and that's a seed. And every time
[4:49] the age comes along, that seed ripens up
[4:52] and then uh reformation comes forth and
[4:56] he promised it and it does that. Now, we
[5:00] did not deserve these things. We did not
[5:03] deserve these blessings of God because
[5:06] we had went out after the things of the
[5:08] world. One in the air of Cain. Cain
[5:11] building a nice altar and a nice church
[5:13] and putting flowers up on it and thought
[5:15] that's exactly what it was. It was a
[5:17] bunch of apples or pears or pomegrants
[5:20] or whatever it was and his father and
[5:21] mother had eaten in the Garden of Eden.
[5:23] It run them out and so he offered that
[5:26] back to God and God rejected it.
[5:29] But Abel by faith offered unto God a
[5:32] more excellent sacrifice than Cain. And
[5:35] today the Bible said in Jude that they
[5:38] have run in the way of
[5:40] Cain. Perished in the gain sand of Kora.
[5:44] See running the way of Cain, building
[5:45] altars, building churches,
[5:47] denominations, making it flowery big
[5:49] more members than the rest of them.
[5:51] taken in things. Anything that come
[5:53] along and jumped up and down or shook
[5:55] hands or was baptized a certain way or
[5:57] spoke in tongues or run through the
[5:58] floor, they put their name on the book.
[6:01] That's right. And then turn on the real
[6:03] truth that be preached and denied.
[6:07] How can it be? So notice what a mess we
[6:10] were in. Notice and the Bible said, "And
[6:13] they went in the way of
[6:15] Balum and perished in the gaining of
[6:19] Kora."
[6:20] perished in the gain s What was the gain
[6:23] saint of Kora? Well, you think you're
[6:26] the only holy man? Well, God's all of us
[6:28] are holy. The whole church is all right.
[6:30] Every all of us get together. That's
[6:32] what we ought to do. That's where they
[6:34] perish. That and we truly deserved it.
[6:39] We deserve to be that. But God, rich in
[6:42] mercy, has pulled us out of that chaos
[6:45] and let us see it before the thing hits
[6:47] here. rich in his mercy and sent us back
[6:51] a revival of divine healing and the
[6:55] coming again of the power of God.
[6:57] According to history, no revival ever
[6:59] lasted over three years. This revival
[7:02] carried for 15 years. It's been a
[7:05] burning fires around and around the
[7:08] world. Why? Because we deserved it. God
[7:10] rich in his mercy. Not because we
[7:14] desired it or because we deserved it
[7:17] rather. Just think of what it's done. I
[7:20] think of one of your sisters right here
[7:23] in Phoenix that many of you know, Miss
[7:26] Hattie Waldraw.
[7:28] She had cancer of the
[7:30] heart and she was in the prayer line up
[7:33] here when brother Moore and I were here
[7:36] the first time about 15 18 years ago and
[7:41] she was dying with cancer of the heart
[7:44] and she should have been dead a long
[7:47] time ago but God rich in mercy
[7:52] sent his power upon her and he saved her
[7:56] life and she's living today.
[7:59] God, rich in mercy, Congressman Upshaw,
[8:03] a great man. Uh I think he was the
[8:06] president or something of the of the
[8:09] Baptist uh Southern Baptist Convention
[8:12] at one time or vice president or
[8:14] something. He had done all he was a good
[8:16] man. He did all that he knowed how to
[8:18] do. He'd went to every doctor. Nobody
[8:20] could do nothing for him. He was bound
[8:22] down. Ministers had prayed for him. He'd
[8:25] had a gallon of oil or a poured on his
[8:27] head, anointing of different ministers
[8:29] everywhere. One night, Los Angeles,
[8:33] California, walking up to the pull pit,
[8:35] looking a bunch of wheelchairs about
[8:37] twice, three times, and watch sitting
[8:39] there all up and down the aisles back
[8:42] and
[8:43] forth. And then there laid over there a
[8:46] cop with a little colored girl and
[8:48] little negro uh girl. And her her mother
[8:51] was sitting by her. and my brother had
[8:54] bringing the prayer line up and I was
[8:57] looking knowing not what was going on
[9:00] and I seen a doctor with tardis shell
[9:03] glasses operating on a little negro girl
[9:06] for a throat condition and she paralyzed
[9:10] and I looked around I thought where is
[9:12] the child at I couldn't see her after a
[9:14] while way down there no hopely little
[9:17] girl about seven or eight years old to
[9:20] be paralyzed the rest of her life there
[9:22] was her mother down there on her knees
[9:26] praying. Then I said, "This doctor
[9:30] operated on your little girl into
[9:32] scrap." She said, "That's right, sir."
[9:34] Then she tried to get the baby to the
[9:35] platform. They told her not to do it.
[9:37] They tried to quieten her down. By the
[9:39] time they got her quiet, I thought,
[9:41] "Well, we'll get a chance to pray for
[9:43] her." In a few minutes, maybe people
[9:45] right here was there that night. And I
[9:48] was looking out over the audience. I
[9:50] seen that little girl going down look
[9:54] like to a a little narrow road with a
[9:57] dial in her arms rocking that doll. No
[10:01] matter how much the doctor said that she
[10:04] was going to be paralyzed the rest of
[10:06] her life, God rich in mercy sent down
[10:09] the Holy Spirit by a vision. And that
[10:12] little girl got up out of there and she
[10:14] and her mother took hold of hands and
[10:16] walked down through that aisle praising
[10:19] God. Way back there said an old man,
[10:22] Congressman Upshaw. Many of you knows
[10:25] his testimony. He had been a good man.
[10:27] Tried all of his life 66 years and in a
[10:31] wheelchair pushed in bed crutches under
[10:34] his arms that he walked with never no
[10:36] more to walk normal. And there he sat
[10:38] there looking on that. All of a sudden,
[10:41] I looked out and saw a vision. There he
[10:44] come walking down across the top of that
[10:47] audience. Bound his head could walk as
[10:50] good as anybody. I didn't know who the
[10:52] man was. I said, "There's a great man
[10:53] sitting back there. He fell off of a
[10:55] wagon when he was a little boy or onto a
[10:58] hayframe and hurt his back. They bored
[11:01] holes in the floor to keep the vibration
[11:04] when the people walk from striking on
[11:06] his back." I said, 'He becomes a great
[11:08] man and he keeps growing greater. He's
[11:11] sitting in a great circle at the White
[11:12] House. And then this man come and told
[11:15] me, he said, "That's Congressman Upshaw.
[11:16] Did you ever hear him?" I said, "Never
[11:17] heard of him." And so he run a little
[11:19] extension mic back there and it was
[11:21] talking back and forth. Then I started
[11:23] to look around. I seen the old
[11:25] congressman coming walking towards me in
[11:27] a vision just as perfect and normal as
[11:29] he could be. God rich in mercy pulled
[11:33] him from that wheelchair and he walked
[11:35] without crutches till the day he died.
[11:38] God rich in mercy when doctors had
[11:42] failed when science had failed when
[11:44] everything else had failed. God was rich
[11:47] in mercy. The congressman upshaw I think
[11:50] of myself as a little old boy. I
[11:53] remember as a people call me a day a
[11:55] woman hater. The reason it was is
[11:58] because I seen so much immorality. out
[12:00] of women when I was a kid. I hated them
[12:03] and I don't do that now because I know
[12:05] there's some good ones. But I remember
[12:08] how it was so bad, so immoral. And I
[12:12] thought my I I'll never be around where
[12:16] people's at. I have no education so I
[12:18] won't get any. And little old kid
[12:20] sitting there, not even a shirt on with
[12:22] my uh uh coat pinned up like this with a
[12:25] safety pin and it real hot. And the
[12:27] teacher said, "William, aren't you hot
[12:29] with that coat on?" I said, "No, ma'am.
[12:30] I'm a little bit chilly." And she made
[12:32] me go over to the stove and and put some
[12:34] wood in the stove, and I like to burn
[12:36] up. I I I didn't have no shirt that
[12:38] whole season through. And I thought if I
[12:41] could ever get the money sometime, and I
[12:43] could get a little uh get me a 3030
[12:46] rifle, I come out west here and live out
[12:49] here and hunt for the rest of my life. I
[12:50] didn't want nothing to do with people.
[12:52] Just stay away because they didn't like
[12:54] me and and I just stay away from them.
[12:56] And then every time I go downtown to
[12:59] talk to anybody, see some fellas on the
[13:00] street, I knew I'd say hello there,
[13:02] John, Jim, how are you? Oh, hello. See,
[13:05] they didn't want to talk to me. Didn't
[13:06] want nothing to do with me because of my
[13:09] daddy and them that made whiskey. And I
[13:11] I didn't do that. It was nothing I done
[13:13] and I would have been that type. But now
[13:15] I said to the wife not long ago, my wall
[13:18] is plastered with the best guns that can
[13:20] be bought. Oh, and I think of them old
[13:23] dirty clothes tonight. I've got two or
[13:25] three good suits and no friends. I have
[13:29] to hide out in the wilderness to keep
[13:31] away from people. What's the matter? Is
[13:33] it because of my personality? Is it
[13:35] because of my education? No. God, rich
[13:38] in mercy saw me in that condition and he
[13:42] saved me. I remember being led by the
[13:44] arms as a blind man. I could not see.
[13:47] Everything in front of me was a blur.
[13:49] I'd be blind the rest of my life. But
[13:51] God rich in mercy restored back my
[13:54] sight. I'm 55 years old and still got
[13:57] good sight. God rich in mercy is the
[14:00] only thing I can say. Once the church
[14:03] had no provided way of healing. They had
[14:05] one but they turned it down. But God
[14:08] rich in mercy has sent them a gift of
[14:12] divine healing. That is the Holy Spirit
[14:15] among us confirming the word with signs
[14:18] following. God rich in mercy. I have two
[14:20] or three pages sure of these notes, but
[14:22] I ain't going to try to strike them
[14:23] because I'm I'm conscious that it's
[14:25] almost time to start that prayer line.
[14:27] But God rich in his mercy. Many of you
[14:29] here tonight, the doctors turned you
[14:31] down. There's people sitting in them
[14:32] wheelchairs. They probably never come
[14:34] out of there. They are there to stay.
[14:37] Some of them paralyzed in different
[14:38] ways. They would never couldn't come
[14:40] out. There's no way for them to come
[14:41] out. But God, rich in his mercy, has
[14:44] provided an atonement.
[14:47] Don't turn it down. Receive it. There's
[14:50] man out there with heart trouble.
[14:51] There's people with cancers that the
[14:53] doctors can do nothing with. You're
[14:55] hopeless, helpless in this world. But
[14:57] God rich in his mercy has sent down the
[15:00] Holy Ghost and right here now to confirm
[15:03] the word to prove that he's the same
[15:05] yesterday, today, and forever. Yes.
[15:07] Amen. Because we deserve it because God
[15:11] is rich in his mercy.
[15:14] Amen. Amen. Now, that's the one. That's
[15:18] the person. It's that Lord Jesus. He is
[15:21] not dead, but he has risen from the
[15:23] dead. And he's alive forever more. And
[15:26] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[15:28] forever. Still just as rich in his mercy
[15:31] as he was to the woman that had a blood
[15:34] issue. And she started through the
[15:36] crowd. There was no hopes for her. The
[15:38] doctors had done all they could do. She
[15:40] had a blood issue. She was dying. And
[15:42] she touched the master's garment. God
[15:45] rich in mercy turned around and told her
[15:48] of her condition and she was healed of
[15:51] this blood issue. A little foul
[15:54] prostitute went up to a well one day to
[15:56] get some water. No hope. She'd been
[15:58] excommunicated from the virgins from
[16:00] around the people. Her life was no good.
[16:03] And she thought, "What's the use of
[16:05] trying? I'm turned out there's nothing
[16:07] left for me." But she looked standing
[16:09] over on the side or sitting by the side
[16:11] of the well and there was a man sitting
[16:14] there who told her all things that she
[16:15] has ever done. God rich in his mercy.
[16:19] That same God tonight just as rich in
[16:22] his mercy and just the same as he was in
[16:24] that day. God
[16:27] rich. I think we have 200 prayer cards
[16:30] out here or what we've called out in
[16:32] 200. We're going to call them and let
[16:35] the people line up. We're going to pray
[16:37] for them. But before we do it, that
[16:40] there be some newcomers here to get away
[16:43] from all
[16:45] superstitions. This is not a
[16:48] superstition.
[16:49] It is a manifestation of a promise of
[16:53] God. It depends on what you
[16:56] no virtue in any man. There's no power
[17:00] in no man. But we as believers have
[17:03] authority. Not power, but authority.
[17:07] Someone asked me not long ago said,
[17:09] "Brother Fran, you believe you got power
[17:10] to do this? I ain't got no power at all.
[17:13] But I've got authority." Every believer
[17:15] has it. If you refuse it, you'll stay
[17:18] where you're at. But if you'll accept
[17:20] it, it'll do the exceeding abundance
[17:22] because God is rich in his mercy.
[17:26] Take a little policeman stand out here
[17:27] on the street, his clothes hanging half
[17:29] off of him. He's just skinny. The the
[17:32] cap's got his ears pulled down and he
[17:35] walk out there where cars are coming
[17:36] down that street at 50 miles an hour,
[17:38] 300 horsepower motors in him. He hasn't
[17:41] got the power to stop a bicycle. That's
[17:44] right. But just let him go that whistle
[17:46] and hold up that hand and watch the
[17:47] brake squeak. He hasn't got power, but
[17:49] he's got authority. The whole city is
[17:52] behind him. And when a man or a woman, I
[17:54] don't care what condition you're in,
[17:56] you've got the authority of God by
[17:59] promise
[18:00] because it's rich and promised to do
[18:03] exceedingly abundantly. If you say to
[18:05] this mountain, be moved and don't doubt
[18:07] in your heart, but believe that what
[18:08] you've said will come to pass, you can
[18:10] have what you've said. You got no power,
[18:13] but you got authority.
[18:15] Remember when he told me back there
[18:17] said, "You'll be able to reveal the
[18:19] secrets of the
[18:20] heart." Do you remember that? Many of
[18:22] you Phoenix people, he promised it. What
[18:25] he promises, he does.
[18:28] Now, there's some of you here that
[18:30] hasn't got prayer cards. No doubt. How
[18:32] many sick and don't have prayer cards?
[18:34] Raise up your hands.
[18:37] All right. If you want to know not
[18:39] authority, not power, but the authority
[18:41] of the word, the things that I do shall
[18:44] you also. Jesus promised in Luke
[18:50] 17:30 that just before his coming there
[18:53] would be like the time of no Moses or
[18:56] Noah when they were eating and drinking
[18:59] and giving in marriage and knew not to
[19:00] the day that Noah entered into the ark.
[19:02] He said to be that time. Then he said
[19:04] also as it was in the days of Lot and
[19:07] said this will take place in that day
[19:10] when the son of man shall be revealed.
[19:14] when the son of man is revealed in the
[19:17] last days. Now look what he how the son
[19:20] of man revealed himself in the person of
[19:23] this angel which was the son of man.
[19:26] Absolutely. Abraham called him Elohim.
[19:30] He was a son of man. Revealed himself
[19:32] just before the gentile world was
[19:34] burned. How did he do it to the
[19:36] believer? To the makebeliever. He sent
[19:39] two preachers down to preach to him. But
[19:41] to the real believer, he stood with his
[19:43] back to the tent and he said, "Abraham,
[19:47] is Abram the day a few days before that,
[19:49] but now he's Abraham. Where is thy
[19:51] wife?" Sarah said, "She's in the tent
[19:54] behind you." Said, "I'm going to keep my
[19:57] promise to you. I'm going to visit you."
[20:00] Oh, Abraham was a hundred years old and
[20:03] Sarah was 90, but God, rich in mercy,
[20:07] kept his promise. Amen. They brought the
[20:10] baby because God's merciful and he full
[20:14] of mercy. He's rich in mercy. He keeps
[20:15] his promise. Notice with his back turned
[20:18] to the tent. Sarah laughed and said,
[20:20] "How could these things be? I'm old. How
[20:22] can I have pleasure with my husband as a
[20:24] a young married woman? Why he's 100
[20:27] years old? Our family relationship has
[20:30] ceased many, many years ago. How could
[20:32] this be?" And she laughed about it. And
[20:35] the angel with the son of man with his
[20:37] back turned to the to the tent said,
[20:39] "Why did Sarah laugh? How can these
[20:42] things be?" What was it Jesus said in
[20:45] St. Luke 17:30 that and the days like it
[20:49] was in the days of Lot? Same situation
[20:51] before the gentile world is burned up.
[20:55] He said the son of man will reveal
[20:58] himself in that day. Amen. He made the
[21:00] promise that Malachi 4 promised us it
[21:04] would a message would come forth that
[21:06] would restore the people back to the
[21:08] original Pentecostal message and with
[21:10] the same blessings they had on the day.
[21:12] What is it? It's a two-winged eagle both
[21:14] new and old testament plumping its
[21:17] promises together of God to fulfill what
[21:19] the promises of the Bible said it would
[21:22] do. Amen. God rich in mercy would not
[21:26] let his people go out this
[21:28] denominational
[21:30] rich in goods and things of the world
[21:33] later see a church age but he didn't
[21:35] make a way of escape
[21:37] believe it
[21:39] people go bless you
[21:43] amen
[21:45] God rich in mercy the mercies of God
[21:50] that's the only thing that I desiremen
[21:53] Not his righteousness, not his law, but
[21:57] his mercy is what I call for. God be
[21:59] merciful to
[22:01] me. We all have that feeling. I was
[22:04] watching. There's a little woman sitting
[22:06] out here on the end of the seat. You
[22:08] have a prayer card out there, lady. You
[22:10] don't. Let me show you God's rich and
[22:13] mercy. You've been real nervous here
[22:15] lately, haven't you? Real bad. In your
[22:17] eyes has gotten worse. Isn't that right?
[22:19] That's right. Now, they're going to
[22:21] change.
[22:22] God rich in his mercy by asking you if
[22:26] you would believe this now. You have no
[22:29] prayer card. You have nothing. But you
[22:31] don't need it. See, it's grace that's
[22:33] bestowed to you. There's such a little
[22:34] bitty fellow sitting right there in
[22:35] front of kind of a sitting right out
[22:37] here. He's suffering with a growth on
[22:40] his body. It's just recently come on
[22:43] there recently. Isn't that right, sir?
[22:46] It's right. You don't know what it is.
[22:48] You're scared of it. That's right. It
[22:50] was caused from a bruise, wasn't it?
[22:52] Have you a prayer card? You don't have
[22:54] no prayer card. You don't need
[22:58] one. God rich in his mercy. Oh, brother,
[23:03] sister, believe God. Don't doubt him.

[23:15] rich in his mercy? You're sitting there
[23:17] with a hernia. Do you believe that God
[23:19] can heal that hernia and make you well
[23:21] sitting right here on the end of seat

[23:24] can heal that hernia, God will do that
[23:26] to you if you'll accept it. Do you
[23:29] believe it? Will you accept it? All

[23:40] here. She's suffering with poor
[23:42] circulation in her body. But if she will

[23:49] believes it, I believe she's going to
[23:51] miss it as sure as
[23:53] anything. I have
[23:55] mercy is my prayer. If I could see the
[24:00] woman's Mrs. Riley, do you believe that

[28:38] within my heart. Oh, glory to his name.
