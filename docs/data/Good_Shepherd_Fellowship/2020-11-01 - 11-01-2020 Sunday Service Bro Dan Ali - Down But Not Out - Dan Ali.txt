while good to see you once again on such a beautiful sunday morning musicians god bless you you can take your seats um in fact as i was seated over there just getting prepared in a way and i saw that 10-minute clip about the missionary trip somewhere in tanzania in fact it broke my heart that people go through a lot to serve the same god we are serving just look at the church why they were seated having fellowship that was not something in isolation you can find 1001 places like that spread across the continent and as a matter of fact here in america we just jump in our cast and we drive to church people walk for hours to go to church and they walk hours to come back home and sometimes they come and there is not even food to eat in fact i don't know how many of you know what it means to glean it's one thing being a farmer you have your farm and your crop and your harvest it's another thing that the farmer finishes harvesting their crop and then you go in to see whether there were some leftovers and then you pick those leftovers that's what we call cleaning so as a matter of fact if you were standing outside and somebody was harvesting their field you'll be praying that they should just they shouldn't even enter some areas so you can go and have a bumper gleam in fact and anytime it's not you have to reduce yourself to do something like that and anytime you saw somebody doing that they were doing that to put food on the table and for somebody to go and do that to raise up a house for the lord and to refuse help my goodness we have no excuse excuses we have no excuse whatsoever we need a lot of sister marias in this day and age praise be to god in fact you know the devil has always been a liar he has been a liar from the start and he is going to be a liar in the end you know um i believe he's a very good rnd guy rnd is just research and development i happen to be in that field if you are in the r d field don't get offended i'm not talking about you i'm just talking about the operation what goes on in that field that there is a standard recipe and then what these guys do they just take a little from the standard add a little just to create something new because the people are craving for it we have a standard recipe the word of god is the standard anything less than that is unacceptable the devil will just come take a little here add a little there and when you accept it you accept damnation amen the other day just last sunday after service i went home and there was a call when i picked the call it was my son joshua it's a daddy i have always been having this notion that heaven is going to be boring and um i heard a preacher talking about this talking about that and i had the opportunity to deal with those things and i told him heaven is not a boring place the bible says in first corinthians 2 9 that the eyes have not sinned nor the ear head neither had the man the heart of man conceived what god has prepared for his children or for them that fear him or love him now when you look at this scripture what does it tell you it tells you that there are simply no ways to describe it there are no adjectives to describe it and as a matter of fact when you go to revelation 21 while you are so seated if you can just turn to revelation 21 just take a few scriptures there revelations 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first eight were passed away and there was no mercy and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bright adorned for her husband and i had a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and there shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he does sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful praise be to god and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son we are sons and daughters of god he that overcometh we ought to overcome there are things to overcome praise be to god now when you read something like this does it tell you that heaven is going to be a boring place death is abolished there are no motifs to steal no more armed robbery no sickness no disease no heartaches no headaches no hate no greed no selfishness no temptation praise be to god what is better than this and the devil can just come and pollute people's mind look and when i left with them i said you know what i just don't know where it came from in an instant i said in any case if heaven is going to be a boring place a boring heaven is by far better than a busy hell [Music] praise be to god he said daddy is hell going to be busy i said yes hell is going to be a busy place because the bible says there'll be nothing of teeth they'll be wailing they'll be shouting so it's going to be busy you know when i was asking why don't you come to church he was blaming it on transportation and again just look at what the clip was just saw i'm very mindful of what the youth meeting i will not keep you here a minute longer than we are supposed to it's not a promise though but praise the lord yes you know if the desire is there god will always make a way it's a genuine excuse to say that i have no transportation but is it worthy of the gospel brother brother said a life full of excuses is not worthy of the gospel for some of us oh it's because of transportation that is why i don't come to church for some of us it's because of work sometimes it's not just work because you realize that during service whether wednesdays or sundays you are free to come to church but it's because of the little over time that keeps you away from service and sometimes it's because of school work that keeps you away from service sometimes you don't have the time the 24 hours a day we have it's not even sufficient for some of us here so there is no time for god and for some of us it's none of the above all you know is that i'm not coming i don't even know why you know if for nothing at all if for nothing at all it's better to come to church when the church does have opened up to sit in the house a man and his family left for church one day they got back home they didn't realize the house they just saw the police light around and before they got there there was a semi the head was in the building and the trailer was outside so if they were in the house just imagine what was going to happen by coming to church and going but you don't know what god takes you from there are a lot of dangers that god takes us away from which we have no idea about if for nothing at all it's better to be in the house of god when service is going on than to choose to do otherwise you may feel sometimes that oh i come and i don't benefit i'm not getting anything it's still better to be in the house of god you know i just love the wild unfortunately here in america even the wild it's not even a while i don't care how far you go in the bush you also see light you see water there is gas you can heat up what but you know i love the wild you can set fire and then you go to the river and then pick a wet log or you can cut a fresh branch fresh with leaves on and then put it right in the fire it is not going to bend it will never bend but so long as it is keeping company with those that are on fire something happens it is getting too dry it is not lighting up but the water inside from the tip is drying it is drying and it's drying and then over time it begins to catch fire you may come and feel you are not getting anything it's because you don't even know what you are getting but when you stay amen you stay under the anointing of the world the worldliness in you is gradually being pushed out you are getting dry that ain't right catching up with fire and you don't even know it and when that white love catches fire just pick it up and you see at the end of it you see some water something like grease coming it's just paging the water out of his system when a man or a woman gets to that point even when you come to church and they check god's help i know service is going on you can even pass through the window because something has happened to your life praise be to god amen so sometimes you come and it's like oh i didn't get anything you got something brother brother said there is no way you would come and go back the same something happens anytime you come praise be to god brother branham said that when you take the holy spirit out of the church it becomes a lodge and a lord is one of the most secretive societies in the world very demonic and we don't want no we don't want a lodge we want a church that is filled with the power of god that when you come you can see yourself in the mirror of the word of god see yourself as you are and then cry out for mercy praise be to god just remember that your services to god would never be invented i was so much touched about what sister maria was is doing um [Music] yeah we we have a very comfortable place very cozy we don't care whether it's raining or not we don't care whether the sun is shining or not but you think of a place where people would be and they are praying that oh there shouldn't be rain because you are going to have service if the rain comes it's going to destroy our service just imagine where you would stand on that day with all the opportunity we have may the lord be merciful praise be to god as i said i'm very mindful of my time today and i'm not going to keep you here for long but there is something i want us to look at in the book of judges if we can stand for the reading of the word judges 13 1-7 judges 13 1-7 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of danites whose name was manual and his wife was barren and bear not and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren embarrass not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware i pray i pray and drink not wine no strong drink and it's not any unclean thing for lo thou shall conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be another right unto god from the womb and he shall be he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine no strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be another right unto god from the womb to the day of his death praise be to god shall we pray our lord and our savior jesus we thank thee once again for this opportunity we have had to come before the old god we have come with expectations great expectations lord on our hearts to hear from you we have come because we know and we believe that you would meet us at the various points of our needs we have come because we know that will not leave your presence the way we have coming we have come trusting and believing that we behold your faith oh god we are so grateful for everything you've done for us we ask you dear lord jesus to come and take over the service lord touch every heart lord touch every soul in ways only you can and let our name be praised this morning father in the name of jesus we pray and we thank you so much for having ahead and answered our praise amen shall we be seated i have titled my message this morning down but not out down but not out it's one thing to be down and it's another thing to be out uh let's just take the boxing arena it's one thing when you are boxed down or you are knocked down and it's another thing when you are knocked out to be knocked down doesn't mean that you are knocked out praise be to god down but not out i used to love boxing a lot not because i was an amateur boxer coming up but i just loved that spot for whatever reason and i would sit for very long i was watching boxing and there was one boxing boat i watched just for the purpose of this illustration let's say one was in the right corner the other was in the yellow corner and the one in the yellow corner almost every single round he was knocked down almost every single round he visited the canvas but he never gave up he was so bloody and he was so swollen up and i sat there and i was asking myself why would he not give up and i was again asking if he is not giving up why is that afraid not discontinuing the fight because the refrigerant uses discretion to stop the fight but the referee wasn't doing that and again his coach he's at the corner there the coach can also throw in the towel and stop the fight but for every time they went on recess the court will just come and tell him you beat him you can do this trust me you can fight this guy you are going to win this fight and the guy is there nodding his head with all the blood and then they will go in he will go down again and as they continued fighting they both just landed blows on each other's jaw and both of them went down remember that there was one that was already used to falling down and rising up so when they went down i knew that he was going to rise up and he never disappointed me he got onto his feet but the one that went down who was supposedly winning the fight was just lying down the referee counted one two three up to ten he never woke up they had to come and carry him out down but not out he was knocked down several times but he was never knocked out he came back and he won the fight praise be to god i want you to have this picture in your mind as we travel together this morning now we read about something the children of god israel had done evil and god gave them up to the philistines 40 years to rule over them but it got to the point i believe the table was turning and god sent forth something to deliver the children of israel from the hands of the philistines now there is something i want us to take note of the bible says that he was a nazirite from the womb praise be to god and he was going to be another right unto his death but in between in between from the womb to death in between the bible didn't tell us that trouble he was going to go through the bible didn't tell us the storm that was going to come his way that things he was going to go through the bible didn't talk about it but the bible said he was a nazarite from the womb and he would be another right even unto death praise be to god if you are a child of god you were before the foundation of this world and you are going to die a child of god there is nothing that can change it before you were born you were a child of god a son or a daughter and i don't care what it is that happens between your breath till the time you die i don't care what it is that you go through and god is not interested in your fault that is why the bible says that just shall fall seven times and rise up again amen i know seven times by now you are counting how many times have i fallen already i have fallen over 100 times and what am i talking about seven is the number of completion so you can fall and fall completely and still never fall out of grace praise be to god so it doesn't matter you can carry a ship to the tenth floor of a building and let go of it it will come and crash and die when you come down you will never come and see a goat you will see a dead sheep children of god are born we are born of god praise be to god whatever it is that you may be going through god is not looking at all those things the fallen god is looking at you at the cross line he was a nazarite from the womb and he will be another right unto death but everything that happened in between or was going to happen was inconsequential amen something came he was a very very strong man as we all know my brother brother said that something was some tiny fellow very tiny you would look at him and think you will run him over 10 times in a second embryo said it had to be so so god can take the glory if he was like a man the size of goliath that would say oh it was his strength but you looked at this man the way he was and he could just go and then catch foxes one time he caught 300 foxes tied their tails together would catch one here one day tidy a test one day one they cut tie their tails together put a brush light at it and they entered the farms of the syrians and bent everything down amanda would come and lift up an iron gate over a thousand pounds and not just throw it down but will climb the hill and go and dump it when he went into the into the rocks to go and hide and the syrians came and surrendered the place his own brethren went to him and said something what have you done again the syrians are here it's okay we have just come to tie you up and to hand you over to them so we can be at peace someone said that is all right just make sure that you are not coming to fight me it is okay to tie me up they tied something and went and delivered him up the series were happy when they got to a place the spirit of the lord came upon him and those costs melted and when he turned what did he find the jawbone of an ass he slew a thousand felicia soldiers with a jawbone of an ass this tiny fellow very insignificant if you should look at him in that perspective this tells you that god can use anybody god can use anything it is not your strength when you think you are strong god is out of it when you think it is your wisdom god is out of it when you think it's your intellect god is out of it but when you come to that place and you can reckon that oh you are just i mean you are nobody you are trusting on him and you are believing in him god will never let you down god can use anybody praise be to god that tiny fellow so that baffled baffled they the syrians the philistines a lot i mean who is this guy so they knew that it was not his natural strength they knew that there was a secret behind his strength and they decided to find out what this secret was your enemy will never get tired running after you and we used to have a saying that the thing that is throwing after you is not complaining of tiredness you that are running away are the one complaining of tiredness no the devil would never stop they set up to find that secret now remember that they couldn't get to something they know it was going to be a death penalty but they had somebody very close to something through whom they could get to him the devil cannot get to you as a child of god the devil can never get to you but the devil can always get to this man here in order to get to you the devil can always get in contact with this man here and delilah was something's weakness and this flesh here is our weakness brother branham said you know every man has a weak point and the devil knows your weak point the devil will not attack you why he knows you are strong when he is coming he comes from the weakest point because he knows that it's your weak point again it's like two boxes in the ring when you know because before the boxes come together they watch each other's clip and if you ever had an injury and they come in the ring with you that is what they are focusing on because they know that if they can hit that place they would overcome you and if you also know that that is your weak point you don't think you're going to allow put your head on the line for your opponent to hit no way you'll guide it and you guide it jealously so that weak point you have don't let the devil capitalize on it or take advantage of it you have to guard that weak point and guard it jealously because if the devil is coming that is how he is going to come in so the philistines knew how to get to to something so they came to delilah to entice delilah with money money is a dangerous thing the bible says the love of money is the root of all evil and the prayer of god made us understand that we should watch money money has its own influence too little of it problem too much of it problem in fact for the love of money human beings can do anything if the grace of god does not help you for the love of money you can settle for anything i have seen people in the name of my name go into tunnels for weeks till they don't know what day what time of day it is or the day of the month they don't know it chasing gold and here in america i have had over a thousand times already how because of insurance money husband is killing wife wife is killing husband father is killing son and it's a mess just for the love of money one time a husband took his wife on his on her birthday essa honey i'm going to give you a birthday you will never forget the wife asked what is it honey he said it's a surprise and indeed it was a surprise an unpleasant surprise that he took his wife on her birthday in the car and as they were driving they went out of town and they were still driving and the woman asked honey where are we going i don't remember ever coming this way with you for anything it's a honey it's a surprise not knowing he had already arranged with somebody to kill his wife they got to the place he pulled up and then she asked honey i mean what are we doing here and then they saw a man coming he rode on the glass the man just came took a gun shot the woman but the good news was that after shooting the woman he turned the gun on the man and shot him too insurance money is very bad do not let the love of money ever enter your heart it will ruin your life in any case why are we carrying the money too if you are as rich as bill gates what are you carrying the money to the day you die they just go and bury you in that six by six hope and that is the end of the story everything you tried for is useless put god first praise be to god [Applause] a somalian woman who had five children had a visa where she ended up in australia and then went back to somalia on a visit and then she went out two men arrested her and they said your husband has paid us to kill you so what are talking about my husband is dead he said no you have a new husband the one who just got married to in australia the woman they didn't believe it they called the husband's number and spoke with the husband and they said we have done the job he said guys send me the picture i want to be very sure say okay we'll send you the picture and the other woman is that husband's voice is that his number i said yes and what made me to read that i had i saw the caption a woman who attended her own funeral i said what is this let me read it so the man thought oh i have killed a woman already and was preparing the purpose to go for the insurance money so they did the funeral on the day of the funeral the woman walks into the funeral home praise be to god why insurance money he is behind bars now the love of money money can let people stoop so low and live like dogs live a wretched and a filthy life and they will make you think that they are enjoying life they are not enjoying life they came and enticed her with money and she went before before something and we know the story how she tried to dig in i mean something would give her one clue and delilah would have the man hiding only to realize that no it wasn't it and the ladder would just come oh something you don't love me something you are a killer something you hate me something you are not telling me the truth i don't even know who you are until the bible says something so god vexed and he had to tell her the truth but you know delilah was not samson's enemy samson's enemy was something he was his own enemy because he saw all the signs but the brother said it is not how close you get to sin without sinning that makes you spiritual it shows how reckless you are to show that you are a spiritual person when you see sin you keep your distance away from it because the bible says that we should flee from every appearance of evil if you keep hanging around sin if you keep hanging around evil guess what you are going to fall for it when i lived once in northern ghana we were drawing water from the wells it's not the american wells here you can just enter the hardware call it just be in the house and press a button and then the water flows through the well into the pipe no we go there and we draw it with buckets with rope and they are open wells sometimes it will rain and to be so full you can't even tell which is the well and where the road is a very dangerous place now sometimes you have a heat goat i don't know he got is very stubborn i never saw the female goal do that but he goes they come and then they peep inside the open well and then they look inside and then they are going around it and then you see somebody chasing it away it will go and then stop when you're telling you are going when you turn your back you see the he got coming back and when it comes it doesn't go anywhere if you just come and stop around the world again just be looking inside and going around it if you are the owner of the he goat just get the fire ready get some pepper and salt you will soon eat pepper soup you know you know water has a mirroring effect when you look inside the water you can see yourself so the ego looks inside and it's like oh there is a colleague inside there and there to be bleeding it looks he says oh it's like it's ready for fun let me drop you so we can have fellowship there is job sin only to realize that oh it's a different thing it was not what i thought that is how sin is you will see it attractive when you lock in then you realize oh that was not what i thought and when you keep your distance away you are free but so long as you keep close to it and you will not leave that vicinity you keep going around sin keep going around sin keeping company with sinners you are going to fall for it [Applause] it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time something so is coming he could have invented it but he kept going around it going around it so finally his soul got so vexed and he gave out the secret and what did the men do they came and bound him did allah shave him very well and i think my head is even better praise the lord they made sure they saved him very well their strength was gone something's strength was not his hair his strength was not his hair he had a nazarite vow god said that no razor would touch his head so long as he was keeping the hair and there was no result going in he was obeying the lord's command and so long as he was obeying the word of god there was that there was that channel there was that channel there was that highway that super highway from the throne of god that god could step into that channel at any time to do exploits but when that razor touched his head he went against that commandment it was not just the hair i have seen a lot of men in the street with very long hair enough you can whip them they will not stand for a second god is the secret of our strength heaven and earth shall pass away but the word of god would never pass away if you have the word in you you can't pass away how do you pass away with the word of god in you it's impossible the secret of our strength is taking god at his word amen amen when something misbehaved and did the things he did and went against gave the secret out and they shaved him oh then he realized that no the game plan had changed and remember there is always a penalty for sin don't think that because you're a child of god you can do anything and get away with it no you can't get away with it as a matter of fact when we started reading judges 13 it says that the children of israel did sin again and god gave them to the philistines 40 years a child of god if you go against the word there is a penalty to pay don't think you can get away with it and something had a penalty to pay his eyes were scooped out they burned him in prison and he was there grinding oh it's a dangerous thing to live in darkness when you have the opportunity to live in the light it's a dangerous thing to choose to live in darkness for somebody that is already living in darkness do you know when you stay in darkness for too long it tends to get a little brighter for you but for you that is living in the light you fall in darkness is gross darkness it's not a place you want to be as a child of god something was reduced to nothing you can never quantify the grace of god upon the life of a man or a woman you can put a value to it when god takes his grace away from you you'll be more useless than the word useless you'll be more hopeless than the word hopeless when god takes his grace away from you you are finished something now in prison in chains grinding but the bible says that even in prison his head started to grow again now remember that at this point the philistines knew that his strength had something to do with his head and i believe they would have been very very reckless to let his health grow again i believe they heard men that were probably doing over time watching his head probably with your razors ready any hair that is coming they will just take it off because if they were not doing it then they were very reckless praise be to god but word where god has made a way praise be to god the devil is confounded the hair was growing but something himself knew that at this point he had no comfort of growing his long hair again he knew that because he knew that the philistines would not sit down and let that hair grow long again but then he could feel the hair growing praise be to god and the philistines went and looked for trouble they had their fists and they were going to celebrate their god because they said your god had given philistine substance to their hands that something had destroyed them so long killed your man and they were going to celebrate their god to thank their god for delivering something into their hands the purpose of god in a man's life can never be defeated whatever god has brought you into this life to do nothing will stop it something was brought for one purpose he was brought for one purpose to deliver the children of israel from the philistines to kill them to torture them that was the purpose of which he was brought now at this point while he is in the prison bound in chains it looked like oh it is a wasted dream it looked like oh that purpose has been defeated how maybe his people would have been complaining something you were brought to deliver us you were brought for this see where you are behind bars and where are you and every reasonable person would look at that situation and then paint one picture that oh it's a wasted dream but i say it again to the glory of god that the purpose of god for your life can never be defeated and where it looks like the purpose is being defeated you are getting closer it than you ever thought [Music] here comes something that brought him out of prison to come and entertain the people and the bible says that all the laws of the philistines had gathered together substance name was a name of a terror that each time they had something looked for the door and they ran for their dear lives when the governors and the and the lords heard of something they locked their doors up nobody's going out because something is in town now but look at the picture here is something now his eyes blocked out his strength gone he has become an entertainer now so the people that would have been running away from him if they heard something now all of them are gathering together now to come and see him instead of running away now they are gathering together all the dignitaries the loss the politicians the judges the men and the women who they were running away they all came together just to come and make merry and have something to entertain them praise be to god they were gathered together 3 000 people men and women and in his lifetime he hadn't killed that much we can count the thousand he killed we can count the other teddy and a few year few day but all his life he never killed after three thousand because they will not stand and wait for him to come but now they are comfortable to come together because they knew that his strength was gone praise be to god amen when something stood there and they wanted some form of entertainment some say the little boy that was leading him can you please lead me to where this building is sitting those two pillars the pillars upon which this building is sitting and then he let him there samson put his hand on those pillars and something cried out to god remember me lord remember me lord it's not my brother it's not my sister that is in need of prayer it's me oh lord it's not my father it's not my mother it's me something who is in need of prayer remember me oh i know i have let you down i know i have not behaved but once more this was this once remember me and the people were looking what is this guy up to what is he doing what show has he got to give us and the hair had grown a little i don't think it was easy for something i don't think it was easy the battle we are fighting today those mind battles every child of god has fought it in their time i could see something saying you know what my hair is not grown yet my strength has not come what if i fail and something comes and say no something you know what the condition which you are you are already dead just do it anyhow he said no but the hair is not much how do i know if my strength would come how would i know if it would work but against all us he prayed praise be to god when we pray something happens god answers prayer god hears our prayer he prayed and when he shook the building the building came down and 3 000 people including samson himself perished and the bible says in his death he killed more than when he was alive in his death samson lived his most glorious time his death was the most glorious time of his life because he achieved the purpose of god in his life to the letter he achieved it to the letter that was why god brought him he was down but he was never out something was down but he was never out a child of god the word the devil can do to you is just to get you to fall but you falling down doesn't mean you are out i don't care how low you fall the grace of god is lower than your fall and by that time you will be followed to that level the grace of god is already there to pick you up praise be to god a child of god i don't care what situation you find yourself in i don't care how messed up you are i don't care how many times you're falling whether your legs are up or you're down yo i don't give a damn about that if you can get to that place to reckon that you are child of god and that there is a higher purpose to which you are called and you can stand and confess your sins repent of your sins and ask the grace of god to take over the grace of god is going to take over this reminds me of that pilot whose son went into the into the mountains to go and hike and then he was in the house and i said you know what let me just fly the plane go to the mountains maybe i'll see my son and then he flew into the mountains and then he saw his son just fell from the mountain and was just coming down to hit the rocks and the father just came down just shouted at the sun hold the wing hold the wing the sun held the wing and his father just drove him up to safety you may have fallen off and all you are looking at is the ditch but the grace of god is there to sustain you the fact that you are down doesn't mean you are out god is not looking at your situation now god is looking at your situation across the line once you are born a child of god you are going to die a child of god he was a nazarite from the womb and he died another right even though he was shaving shaving he still died another right you can fall 10 23 times don't turn the grace of god into disgrace if you have found favor in the sight of god and god has rescued you you have no reason you have no cause to go back into sin anymore stay your grounds repent of your sins ask god for forgiveness and god will restore you where you belong once a child of god always a child of god children of god are born the circumstances we got through in this life do not change us they don't define who we are your true identity is in the man before the foundation of this world that is why your true identity is the circumstances of this life do not define you we were children of god before the foundation stone was laid we are children of god it doesn't matter what we go through we are children of god when we come to the end of the road and we have to live nothing can hold us back there are a lot of choices wrong choices we've made there are things we have done which we shouldn't do but those things do not define you remember that you are son of god remember that you are a daughter of god god is looking at you across the finishing line make things right praise be to god down but not out we can talk about david we can talk about king soul we can talk about adam and eve when they fall came in the garden they were down but they were not out for their sake god cares the earth but they were not out of the will of god we can talk about a whole lot of characters in the bible i just want to spare you that so it's one thing to be down and it's another thing to be out to be down is not synonymous to being out all you have to reckon is that where you fall it's not your destination why you fall it's not your destination rise up and keep moving praise be to god can the musicians come over and as you pray everyone can come over our lord and our savior jesus we thank this so much that we can gather together on a sunday morning like this father oh god to encourage ourselves we know that the days are getting closer [Music]
