to be in the house of the Lord we just bring you praise report tonight amen thank you for the one for stepping in the 18 leaving us tonight amen you know for many years brother Branham says something in the message he preached where he talks about total delivering the message total deliverance in that messages he speaks about total obedience to every word God entitle us to the Holy Ghost and and for many years you know I don't know about other people but for many parties right you know he says total obedience to every word of God so in your as you read you you feel like every word every word of God means every word of God but you know it's just like the scripture you know when you read one verse and and you read the next verse it takes God to connect you to the next verse to see how the how the change in the scripture or what the Holy Spirit was doing in a particular time and Barbara Branham said there I never taught battle as I were protocol up for you tonight but when he said there the next paragraph he says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so when he talks about total obedience to every word of God he gives us an entrance to every word of God because that's where it begins from amen repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so that's were there's there's that that's the doorway you know to obeying every word of God praise the law and and and sometimes that that is the way we've gone in in in human mind we always try to process things and in our our our our our China of processing things we over processing we over think about it until it makes us afraid and then we get nervous and then we get confused and then when we think about it so much then we even start doubting the very thing we were thinking about you know that's that's how the human mind works what you see it takes obedience to God's Word amen to give us the victory last Wednesday we had a prayer meeting and we were going to continue in a channel of their prayer meeting tonight so we will have a prayer meeting tonight and just like we did but let me let me let me testify to you tonight a little bit our sister billers who will be traveling this weekend and to Iowa to visit with her brother and then she would be bad she wanted me to let you know so you will continue to pray for her she's one of the oldest ever less sister they have been with us here for for some time praise the Lord and what is iki also wanted me to bring his appreciation to the entire church for standing where he and his family amen we had a good visit with him last night and kind of all end up into a late night early morning 1a and Bible studies brother Joseph my wife and we were all down there just to just to visit with family a little bit and never been in his family nor there too so we had we had a shot night email praise the Lord but we want to thank the Lord and just build madmen on Sunday she called me in the week and then she wanted to most of the time you know I'm mad and that's so much of a person that likes to there are things that I talk about there are things that I don't talk about let me say like that so well she met meaning but she said it's - meaning it was very very powerful so I want to share with you and she being brain you know she's just been praying and trusting the Lord and you know committing things to the Lord she's never come in a week weekly services from Wednesday night just because of the nature of what she does and so on Monday last week she had accounted for repetition of dreams that was happening all through the night and what actually was you know she started you know praying for the church and she saw us going into a prayer service you know and I mean we were having the prayer service like praying like never before you know the candle like the spirit of supplication just break upon the people you know then people were praying and there were different things you know and then the dream repeated again and then Wednesday night normally she would she would turn into the service but she did not turn into the service I don't tell she she watched the service on on Thursday and and it turned out to be that the very thing that she was dreaming about I mean there were some things that were very specific in the dream and those things were Pacific on Wednesday night praise the Lord and it might not mean nothing to you but for me being the preacher I know what it is he meant it means a whole lot praise of God and I just had had a burden on my heart you know you just have preeminence Wednesday night and and then gradually we go into the new year with their praise Lord so realizing that a Lord even started witnessing to her when I have not even said it and then I even announce it you know that was that was very comforting I was that was confirming praise the Lord and we want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord and we will just we will just encourage you to to pray you know less let's open our heart to the burden of Prayer you know let's find time to pray morning afternoon you know whatever time we came in the middle of the night fun time to pray amen spend time with God if you if you just don't have nothing to pray about nobody just remember me amen pray for me praise the Lord so and we thank the Lord for all of those things I just believe that God in His mercy he's mindful of us amen he's very very mindful of us so tonight just before we go into our prayer meeting and I came ready tonight I was I was going to leave you just like we did last week and then there was those birdie number one how to to lead us into worship we talked about it here myself in Owen and I appreciate you number one he told me he says he says you know I don't take it lightly going behind the pulpit I mean it's not a place to joke it's not a sure thing it's something that we all might take and was take seriously and we must respect everything that we do when we enter into there through those doors Solomon being a wise man he said in the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 5 he says wash your feet when you go into the house of the Lord wash your steps don't just come flapping your feet and throwing your hands and you know and then just come and sit down take your chewing gum and go out to the bathroom come in you slam the door in or death praise the Lord wash your feet go into the house of the Lord you just think about it those people the Old Testament Tabernacle even one man could go into the holiest place and when he go they had to tie a belt around his lash and he had to wash every step holy holy unto the Lord one mistake he made he fall dead and you have to drag him out praise the Lord and that's the very same place that we come every every time we come to church and let us now take it for granted praise the Lord tonight Amy and let us bow our heads and pray [Music] [Music] the prize the cross be my glory [Music] yeah [Music] my ride so yes Lord yes Lord Jesus yes

verse 18 now the birth of Jesus was on this wise when as his mother married was exposed to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and now willing to make her a public example was was minded to put her away prevailing but why he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou now her but thou Joseph Dow aiming shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins Heavenly Father we want to ask that you bless this portion of the world tonight father garden and just make this service special

know there will be a lot of talking about our Lord Jesus they will put him in the manger that we talk about the baby they will talk about married you know but tonight we want to talk about Joseph amen a just man being not ashamed amen a just man maketh nourishing that's what I want to speak on tonight as we continue to talk on our subject of shame I want to speak on just man may not a shame I just read a portion of code there brother Branham said about Joseph just want to run through there quickly so I can introduce my tortilla so we can pray but branches now little virgin one day she probably had hard time beautiful little lady I mean praise the Lord she kept herself clean from from the world and she lived in a lot Munno town then Dowson creaky she lived in Nazareth but she purpose in her heart that she who served God and she was just an ordinary little woman she was going with a man that was a widow of four children and his name was Joseph we do all means that he was married before his wife died and you know then he thought that he should get another wife praise the Lord you know many times this scripture mark chapter 6 verse 3 let's look at it very quickly this scripture is is is it's really confused in in the Bible praise the Lord and because Mary Mary was a virgin Jesus was the first fruit of her womb the fruit of her warm so in in their sense many times this scripture is confused in a sense as it is written here mark chapter 6 verse 3 is not this the cap into the son of Mary the brother of James and Johnson of Judah and Simon and are not his sister's here with us and they were offended at him now many times people will think that these were married children these were called the brothers and sister of Joseph I mean of Jesus because they were Joseph's children praise the Lord Amen because they were Joseph's children and from his first marriage before he got exposed to Mary praise the Lord sober Benham says she was an ordinary little woman she was going with a man that was a we all of four children and his name was Joseph and they plan to get married in one day when she she had to she had the picture on her hair perhaps göran göran to the virgins well now last year we were talking about the woman are the well she never had to come at this time the mirror was coming because many years she was among her peers amen they call it the well of the Virgin in us and as she come down of the hill maybe say there was Monday morning she was going to get the daily supply of water and those women can pack a package jar of water on the head and in one on each hip and just walk as steady and she was going down to get water and she had a joke perhaps on her arm and she was going alone thinking about the scripture that had data perhaps I mean that she perhaps heard the robber or maybe she induces looking from the front the front porch across the hill where they were going to have be a home and he was a cap injure all those had to be faith faith perfect you know and and and a little hard hats on the world and because he was taking his sweetheart to this one this was a special house him and his sweetheart was going to live in a mean and they were reading the straw on the front porch Joseph read their the scripture the day before unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder in his name shall be called counselor Prince of Peace mighty God everlasting father and his kingdom there shall be no end and maybe Mary said yourself will you read that structure again dear and he read it again who was as I uh speaking of they're all no doubt the Messiah he will come someday praise the Lord and the next morning on the road and the common little GERD about 18 years old going alone to get water down at the well and on her Road that morning perhaps she's seen a life flash and she said it must have been the Sun maybe coming up in the early Julian morning and the dew falling and the dew holding the fragrance down to the ground how beautiful amen now I just wanted to read this just to be able to to capture our mind a little bit create a little picture on our mind as we look at this story together and but the Bible year you know speaks about on this wise Jesus was born praise the Lord meaning the things that were around his birth there were many things that were around his birth we saw what the prophets have spoken besides everything that was that was in the Old Testament scripture at a time that he was going to be born there were many things that were happening around his birth we have to realize that this is the greatest gift that God was going to give to the world and like the prophet of God said he says God always protect his gift amen when God is giving a gift he will always protect it praise the Lord why because there is an identification of God with his gift a gift identify the giver praise the Lord that's the reason why gifts I chose him you just don't jump out there in and just pick up rock and you know anything and and for the oven and go and give it to somebody that's a gift sometimes it's difficult to give people gifts because we have to be thinking you have to be thinking and trying to think about what is happening at that time you see their birthday they see the graduation you know and and how can your gift be able to address what is happening at that time and and now only about them but even about yourself how much will your gift speaks to them how much would they remember you know this it would not be something that we just open look at it and once and it gone away from their mind it man praise the Lord so like the prophet of God said he says God protects his gift and God about to gave the greatest gift to the world he era said that God in His sovereignty praise the Lord amen we spoke on this before but I want to go into into a channel year to to be able to see that realizing everything that was happening around there even though there was a prophecy in the scripture a virgin shall conceive but the people did not even know how it was going to happen and realizing that no matter if it's the Word of God that is said no matter if we were warned about it if those things happened before before our eyes we always as Hemus tried to reason it out amen we always tried to say well maybe it was not so maybe why it had to be so do you realize oh do you really think that that was a so God in His sovereignty he made a provision and what God would do God would take this man Joseph I Colin - to a history he was about about 40 years old like Burt Branham said he he had married in you know what he was he was living happily his wife went to be with the Lord and his children has grown up a little bit in and and and well you see that girl who keep him amen I go keep him after this he will not be a man I would just be I mean just running around with every woman there in Nazareth but he will be a man and I mean he's he's watching over his children he won his children to grow up in you know and uh to be successful I mean to grow up in the things of God he spent time to bring them up but yet there was a need in his life to have a wife praise the Lord amen and this young woman about 18 years all she's she's just had a place to get married praise the Lord amen thinking about her future thinking about her first child thinking about what or whom would be thinking about her wedding veiling and and all those I was saying as a bride mates in her wedding and thinking about the night world she would go and be will hop urgency and that's what I think that's what has come over to to to us like what do we have as how they call it her brother's something you know Showell in that that thing came down from the time were a jet tied our daughter was just I vowed that the first thing that would come from out of my house I was sacrificed to the lawn and and and when her dad told her that he had made a promise to talk to God and he was going to sacrifice her you see God kept a perfect type in the scripture just like how he allowed Abraham to give His only begotten Son that was the same way he laid out that gesture we gave his only begotten daughter why because God image is perfect male and female prays alone and then Christ sacrificed for us but he will also have a people that will be a bride I will also sacrifice him in that we give their life for the gospel now so we go ahead and we realize that she's thinking about all of these things and all the planes that she's making you know for the wedding and everything can and not even thinking about you know what kind of or trouble she's I mean library Burnham says she tried to live a clean life I mean it was a proudful thing for that generation now like at the age that we are living in praise the Lord Amen well you know what young women I will get out of setting the Asian and you know yeah you know and and what and all of the things that is happening but let's just go down this road a little bit so we realize here here is married posed to Joseph making all their planes but God in the back of his mind nor in their there is always a reproach that goes with his word amen he knew that there is a reproach that goes with his word maybe your life would have been better if you were now safe in a way that the world would think better praise the Lord but when you are identified with this word there's a Mac of Jesus Christ on you and there is a reproach that goes with the world and we are glad to bear his reproach so God will raise up a man they have heart and experience he will not raise up a novice he's bringing his greatest gift into the world if it was just maybe in nineteen years or bored or a twenty year or boy I'm telling he's going to dumb married and be gone pick up another woman by eros a girl who get a man that that is the spirit he has been there done that praise the Lord God don't makes mistakes amen now there were many young men over there in Nazareth Judea and all of those places what Mary saw in this man there has been Mahara before he said you said there was anyway you have already live his life but it was God's design God design it that way and the Bible said he was a just man he was a just man it takes a just man to protect the Word of God it takes a just man to Pope the desire of the world above his necessary needs praise the Lord he was a just man that's what the scripture says we do over there a little bit just man make it not a sheen that's what we want to talk about tonight the Bible says uh-uh eros Mary come over you know from the well she met the angel fear not Mary Ann danger telling her she's going to be with chai praise the Lord how is this going to happen seen I've never been with a man the Holy Spirit is going to overshadow you praise the Lord now you would think that and people they have the promise of the Messiah it would have been an easy thing for mirror to see and everybody's glory to God God has for fairies word it would have been you would think that it should have been an easy thing even Mary herself just reading the scripture and she said unto the angel be it unto me according to your word think in her mind in her young mind I'm going to tell my pastor and he would be so glad praise the Lord Amen well for the first time she was saying all the suspiciousness came out like worms coming from a garbage bin everybody started thinking wow wow wow I mean and the news going everywhere my goodness how could just have put himself in such a situation I knew it I knew there was something I thought there was something fishy about this I need everybody going with the earth and the very thing that she was so glad and said be it unto me according to your word now she's now becoming ashamed to even walk in the marketplace because her name has become a bad name praise the Lord and all the parents trying to keep their daughters in a 6 p.m. you have to go they are angels around man that is making young women pregnant and I mean and everybody started saying all sorts of things the very people that the word was given to I mean it's Allah making all sorts of ugly stood me the thing that brought joy to her heart and she ran home to go in announcing now she's in Paris she's getting a little bit confused praise the Lord was that dreamy amen she's trying to shake herself out of her dream trying to shake her head trying to say well if this is a let me get out of here leather their brakes let this be a dream but it's not a dream it's affecting her life she's feeling the change praise the Lord this gospel is not a dream people is going to affect your life is going to change you she's feeling it praise the Lord and the Bible says Joseph was a just man a little be to God and Mary came home and she told Joseph and he hear what she says a just man he never blew out of ya he was a just man he had to be careful she has spoken in the name of the Lord praise the Lord Amen she has spoken in the name of the Lord she have told a angel appear to me praise the Lord and when you read the scripture with what the scripture says there is no provision than that Joseph did not believe Mary he believed her praise the Lord he believed what she told that that an angel has visited I mean that they have built their relationship on trust they have been talking the truth to one another there's no form of deception or lives yeah you have never crossed a line to him about anything why now should he now believed this one praise the Lord but he also know that is written in the word he cannot marry the woman man that is now carrying a child but in respect to the Word of God and in respect to her he's not going to make it a public show he's now going to run down to his relatives and start talking about it and meet his friends everybody that come to the carpenter's shop he had to let them know about it just men don't behave like that just men don't behave like that and God need just man to protect his word amen just man don't behave like that Oh job was a just man he told his wife you speaking like a foolish woman hey man the prophet of God said he never said you are fully he said you speaking like one you better change that language amen Adam was a just man he identified himself with the wrong of his wife he took the blame he never caught a conference and said lion and and all the animals you come and see what this woman has done just man don't behave like that Joseph was dealing with a conflict in his mind what was conflicting in his mind is what is happening to married to conform it with the scripture realize in there if she's carrying a child she's now pregnant with a child I can't I can go ahead and marry her so that was the conflict that was in his mind and the scripture said he will not make a public shame of her praise the Lord because he have already heard one had been what has been said in the marketplace people come to the carpenter shop he hear what they are saying and he keeps his mouth shut he never tried to stand to them and say yeah well you see this all the young girls this is that's the way the behaving nope he said he don't have nothing good to say keep your mouth shut or find another place to take your work talk God needed adjustment to protect his word he needed a just man and just man make it not a shame and the Bible says with this conflict that he had in his mind of reconciling what his his his wife is his the woman he has betrothed what what she's seen with what he's been taught in the scripture to reconcider he will make a public scene but he would deal with it privately praise the Lord he would deal with it properly glory be to God Oh God says the reigns in the heart when a man had and thoughts appeal it make God rush on the same quickly to bring him an answer his thoughts would peel he had no accusation against this young innocent woman innocent woman that have lived a clean life why now should he start disgracing her praise the Lord he had nothing against rain NNN and he just started thinking about it all joy over hearing everything that people are saying about married Lord helped me what can I do how can I help her he's dealing with the conflict in his mind but when she when she come around he he tried to encourage her it will be okay praise the Lord he says she's married you know God never feel there was nothing to have for the Lord he says but my name is all over the place even the Nazareth paper deny me in the paper everybody talking about me say milk come down it will be okay he's waiting for God to give him a leadership waiting for God to speak he was now on a telephone calling this other person you see what is happening Engler on the table

Joseph was respected the Sanhedrin Council respected him the Pharisees members of the Pharisees respected him the people in the community respected him because they knew his children they call them by name the new his daughters they were all growing nice kills praise the Lord this was a man that that that kept his integrity to raise his his his his children in the fear of the Lord to stick with his family no matter what has happened just like job burning and a insane set and a burnt offering for his children he seeks he sticks with him praise the Lord even though they were doing things that were wrong but he was identifying himself with them praise the Lord that's a just man that's a just man I just man knows that I can't change my children I'm not God that's my children I'm going to love them anyway and I'm going to put them in the hands of God when it comes to right I would tell them what is right amen I will tell them what is wrong but I will love them anyhow praise the Lord that's just man that make it not a shame and that's the kind of a man that God prepared to protect his gift knowing the reproach that would come with the birth of Jesus the persecution that would come they had to travel when Pharaoh when Hera heard about the chai wan to kill the child Joseph had to be big not a novice not a man that you know that that is just any for his own self pleasure and safe gain but a man I can be able to esteem the Word of God a puff is desire after the Lord came and spoke to Joseph that night it's a fear not Joseph my goodness my goodness God stepped down that night he's lying on his bed having it on his mind Oh God Jehovah helped Mary make her strong he would not talk you letting in his mind what to do he was more burden for her because he could go sky free the
