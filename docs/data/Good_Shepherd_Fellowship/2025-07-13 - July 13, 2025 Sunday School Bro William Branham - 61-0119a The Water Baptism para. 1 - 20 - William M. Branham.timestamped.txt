[0:01] [Music]
[0:33] is that we don't want to to take too
[0:36] much your time,
[0:38] &gt;&gt; but I got uh and
[0:42] I go do a little studying and I'm going
[0:45] to get ready pretty soon to I got to go
[0:48] to dinner today with some people and I
[0:51] thought before too much gets piled in,
[0:54] there's a lady minister coming from uh
[0:56] up in here, brother Jack Moore's sister
[1:00] that uh she wants to talk to me about
[1:02] women preachers and I know she used to
[1:03] be in today and I thought I'd get over
[1:06] here first
[1:08] and uh the first thing I want you all to
[1:12] know this is recording isn't there's the
[1:15] first thing I want you all to notice
[1:19] and that's uh sister uh um
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Gibson
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Gibson and sister um Su and sister uh
[1:28] Simpson
[1:29] Um
[1:32] the question was asked me about um water
[1:36] baptism
[1:38] and I
[1:39] &gt;&gt; that talk I want to know
[1:40] &gt;&gt; do you want to know about
[1:43] I I would like you all to know first
[1:45] that I have
[1:47] my objective
[1:50] is not to try to show
[1:54] uh like you was some mastermind or know
[1:58] more than somebody else.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Uh my objective is to try to explain to
[2:08] the best of my knowledge by the
[2:10] scriptures
[2:11] what is right and wrong.
[2:14] And it's always been my objective to
[2:18] never uh compromise
[2:21] on anything that God has written and
[2:25] never say it's right because somebody
[2:27] else says it's right. But it's got to be
[2:31] that way. Now
[2:34] it might be this that in the future if
[2:37] you listen to this tape that we're
[2:39] talking on, it might be good to tell you
[2:42] the reason why
[2:44] Um, can you all hear me well enough?
[2:49] &gt;&gt; They um
[2:53] &gt;&gt; uh I think our heavenly father has
[2:56] people made up in certain ways for his
[2:58] own benefit just like we do things
[3:01] certain ways different each time because
[3:04] we have a purpose of doing it.
[3:08] some time ago, I was sitting down in in
[3:12] the state of Kentucky
[3:14] talking to um uh some of my brethren.
[3:17] And
[3:19] when I go home and I can have a little
[3:21] time off from the meeting, there's
[3:23] usually a great crowds piling in, you
[3:25] see. And then I get so nervous after all
[3:29] night. See, don't get no rest at all.
[3:31] They just come day and night.
[3:33] I get real nervous. Then I'll either
[3:36] pick up a fishing pole and go fishing or
[3:38] it's hunting season I'll get my rifle
[3:39] and go hunting. Well, rifles is one of
[3:43] my favorite things to with shooting
[3:45] targets. Brother Jean here and I uh he's
[3:49] been hand loading now. We're we just
[3:51] love to do it.
[3:53] And then um I had a little what they
[3:56] call a model 75,
[3:59] a Winchester rifle 22. Well, that's what
[4:03] I hunt squirrels with.
[4:05] Well, uh, I hunt the squirrels at 50
[4:08] yards, and at 50 yards, I keep messing
[4:11] with this little rifle. So, I can drive
[4:14] attack with it at 50 yard. And the other
[4:17] day, I put nine bullets in the same
[4:20] hole. That right, Brother Jean?
[4:22] &gt;&gt; At 50 yard with a 22 rifle.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Now, well, all at once it went out. I
[4:28] usually, if the squirrel is looking at
[4:31] me, I will shoot him. If he's got his
[4:33] back turned to me, I won't shoot him. He
[4:35] has to be setting so I can just see his
[4:37] eye. And if I happen to hit him low from
[4:40] the eye or above the eye, I know there's
[4:42] something on the rifle. See, so I just I
[4:45] don't try to lie to myself. And I just
[4:47] and I don't take no more squirrels than
[4:50] what the law allows me to take. See, cuz
[4:52] that's right. I'm a conservationist. But
[4:55] I just I find one and he's too far away,
[4:58] I just let him alone. And if this one's
[5:00] too close to me, I'll back up to 50
[5:02] yards and I'll watch him go out and get
[5:04] a hickor and come back. He's looking at
[5:07] me. I just let him alone. Next time he
[5:09] gets one, maybe 10 minutes later after
[5:11] he cuts that one through, he'll go get
[5:13] one. Maybe he's got his back turn. I
[5:14] would shoot him like that. So if he goes
[5:16] away, let him go. Me another one. See,
[5:18] because I'm miss and I love them.
[5:20] They're the best meat there is in the
[5:22] world. There's nothing compared with a
[5:23] great squirrel, especially when he's
[5:25] cutting beach or hickory or something
[5:26] like that.
[5:28] So, my rifle went out. Now, a rifle is a
[5:33] strange thing to fool with. It It's
[5:35] something that it takes the tension off
[5:38] of my nerves and things. Now, other
[5:39] people wouldn't give a care for it. And
[5:42] um I believe our gracious brother or
[5:44] Roberts, I think he plays golf and so
[5:47] does our brother Billy Graham, they play
[5:50] golf. That'll get on my nerves out of
[5:53] them women half-dressed and things like
[5:54] I couldn't stand that. See, I did. But
[5:56] now maybe them brothers I don't mean to
[5:58] get out there for that purpose. See no
[6:00] because they are they're they're
[6:02] gentlemen they're are Christian brothers
[6:04] but just to get out around there I
[6:06] couldn't stand that. See playing golf
[6:09] that's like it's for women or something.
[6:11] You see hit a ball with a stick around
[6:15] that brother I think same thing sitting
[6:16] around fool with an old rifle. Well you
[6:18] know we're made up different. And so,
[6:20] um,
[6:22] this rifle, a lethal vibration of any
[6:26] way will throw it off. You can be
[6:28] shooting and driving an attack with it
[6:30] and put your finger on the barrel, you
[6:32] just ruin your shooting. See, that's how
[6:34] how accurate it has to be. Hey, wrap
[6:36] your hand around the forearm, lay it
[6:38] level in your hand.
[6:41] And then you say, "What's all this got
[6:42] to do with what we're asking you?" But
[6:44] I'm trying to get you to something.
[6:46] First, have a background.
[6:48] Now,
[6:51] one day it went out and I've done
[6:52] everything I know how to do to make it
[6:55] to bring it back in again. I tried
[6:57] rebedding it. I tried tightening,
[7:00] loosening, and everything else. And a
[7:02] 22, you can't handload it because the
[7:04] primers in the hull and you have to take
[7:06] factory loaded ammunition. Now, where we
[7:08] load the ones that's got the the big
[7:11] shells where we can knock the primer out
[7:13] and get a resizer and things while we we
[7:16] can load that and keep changing powders
[7:17] and grams and weight the bullets till we
[7:20] get it to where it'll shoot while it
[7:21] will shoot or either then we go into the
[7:23] bedding and so forth. Therefore, we
[7:25] couldn't do it on that one. But I said,
[7:28] well, maybe I'll ruin the bedding. I'll
[7:30] send it back to Winchester Company. I
[7:32] returned into Winchester Company and
[7:35] they wrote me a letter which I keep for
[7:37] just a a commemoration of it. They said,
[7:40] "Reverend Brandon, this model 70
[7:43] Winchester was not made to be a target
[7:45] gun."
[7:46] Said it'll group a inch, seven shot
[7:50] group. It'll group an inch
[7:53] at 25 yards and said, "You'll never get
[7:56] it any better than that." Cuz that's
[7:58] perfect for that type of gun. an inch at
[8:01] 25 yards. I know that was wrong. I done
[8:06] what nine shots one hole in the other 50
[8:09] yards with it. And that was a Winchester
[8:11] company made it. Now I look like someone
[8:13] would say, "Well, if the engineers
[8:15] patent that gun and they all know what's
[8:18] in it and if they made the gun, then why
[8:23] would you?" That's what my wife said to
[8:25] me. She said, "Billy, why would you fool
[8:27] with that gun X, the man who designed it
[8:30] and made it and knows even how much gas
[8:32] is in every shell and every ring is in
[8:34] it and everything else? How how would
[8:36] you try to dispute their word?"
[8:39] I said, 'Well, honey, not long ago, you
[8:40] were asking me a Bible question,
[8:43] and you had the answers in the back of
[8:45] the Bible, and you asked me, "Did God
[8:49] give Abraham
[8:52] uh that ground that he promised him?"
[8:55] And uh and uh or she asked me, and I
[8:59] said, "No, he never give him the ground.
[9:01] He promised it to him, but he never he
[9:03] never possessed any never got." And so
[9:06] she said, "Uh, oh, I got you on that
[9:08] one." She said, "Here's the answer. He
[9:10] did give it to him." I said, "Turn to
[9:12] Acts 7."
[9:13] Not so much as the place to put his foot
[9:15] on. That's right. It it wasn't given to
[9:18] him. Now, see, sometimes our written out
[9:21] man answers can be wrong.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; And a man that makes the gun can be
[9:26] wrong because I've already knowed I
[9:28] drove nine straight TS into a piece of
[9:32] paper in the same hole. at 50 yards of
[9:35] that gun. They said if seven bullets
[9:37] cover you take an inch at 25 yards, half
[9:40] the distance, you never get it better.
[9:43] To me, they were wrong where they are
[9:44] the masters of the gun or not cuz I know
[9:47] better. See, and I sat down under a tree
[9:50] one morning and brother Woods and
[9:52] Brother Charlie who hunts with me and
[9:54] they were squirrels everywhere. Well, I
[9:56] shot at one a couple days before that.
[9:58] Missed its eye, hit way down on the
[9:59] cheek. of course kill the squad as dead
[10:01] as it hit him in the eye. But the gun
[10:03] was out to me. It makes me nervous cuz
[10:05] that gun's not perfectly in it don't do
[10:08] me no good. Go hunt because I don't hunt
[10:10] for the meat of it anyhow. I just hunt
[10:12] for sport. And um so I said uh that's uh
[10:17] it's I was sitting under a tree, a
[10:18] little leaning tree. I could go to it
[10:20] this morning there in the mountains in
[10:21] Kentucky. And I sat back around that
[10:23] tree listening to Charlie over here just
[10:25] banging away. They I don't care one in
[10:28] the squirrel they shot this so they shot
[10:29] the squirrel if their gun was grouping
[10:32] anyway just so it hit the squirrel but
[10:34] there's the hips or in the mid center or
[10:36] anywhere hit him that's all right and so
[10:39] and uh I said well now that don't I just
[10:42] couldn't stand that and I sat down there
[10:44] I thought just look at the fun them
[10:46] fellas are having and they love to hunt
[10:49] just as well as I do and they're both
[10:52] fine good shots they're dandy man. Both
[10:56] of them Christians filled with the Holy
[10:58] Ghost and just fine man, some high
[11:01] caliber man. And then brothers up there
[11:04] having most fun shooting squirrels and
[11:06] there were squirrels jumping through the
[11:07] trees right by me.
[11:10] Well, I said then why would I do a thing
[11:12] like that sitting here and here I am
[11:15] sitting here crying just tears running
[11:18] down my face. There they are and here I
[11:20] can't even hit the target. And I raised
[11:22] up and I said, "Heavenly Father,
[11:27] why did you make me like this?"
[11:30] A little nervous, upset uh uh person.
[11:34] And then your grace has given me
[11:38] literally millions of friends. See? And
[11:41] I said, "Why would you make me a person
[11:44] like this?" And I started weeping right
[11:46] out loud then sitting under a little
[11:48] leaning tree right sort of up a mountain
[11:51] and uh and I knew soon those fellas had
[11:55] their limit of the squirrels and back
[11:57] that I was sitting there just oh I just
[12:00] didn't have the nerve to shoot at one
[12:01] because afraid it hurt him you know they
[12:03] get get away see and I just and my gun I
[12:06] for a season isn't very long and I'd
[12:09] been for well half the season's gone to
[12:12] try and get that rifle back. I sent the
[12:15] scope where it might and they said that
[12:18] scope is perfectly right. Well, I knew
[12:21] it was a rifle because it's throwing
[12:22] more one in one way and one another. The
[12:23] scope probably wouldn't do that. So, I
[12:27] sat down there and I I just wept
[12:30] and after sitting there a little bit
[12:32] kind of my head over I heard him speak
[12:34] to me.
[12:37] Now you all stood last night in the
[12:39] meetings see how he could go out into
[12:41] the audience anywhere there wherever he
[12:43] desired me tell the people all about
[12:46] their conditions and who they were and
[12:47] where they come from and what they had
[12:49] done what will be
[12:52] you ever see it fail never fails you
[12:54] can't because it's him well then he was
[12:58] speaking to me
[13:00] and he said um
[13:03] he said I made you that way for a
[13:06] purpose
[13:08] Now I said why did you make me that way
[13:11] Lord for a purpose to be nervous and the
[13:13] only thing I have to relax me out of the
[13:15] meeting is come here and hunt and you
[13:17] let me see God makes everything work
[13:19] right for them that love him. See
[13:22] &gt;&gt; he wanted to tell me something. That's
[13:24] how that gun had to go out to get this
[13:26] very thing to me. He said well I said my
[13:30] gun I said Lord you're the only one
[13:32] could bring it in.
[13:34] I said, 'You're the only one could help
[13:36] me because the regular Winchester
[13:38] company says that it won't group but one
[13:41] inch and 25 yards. And Lord, I know it.
[13:44] I I've shot at 50 yards and drove nine
[13:47] straight TS. See, I'm no different than
[13:50] that. He said, that's the reason I made
[13:53] you that way. that you see you I made
[13:58] you that way so
[14:01] for a purpose.
[14:04] Now
[14:06] here's what it was. See if I knew that
[14:09] it would drive attack at 50 yards. I
[14:12] don't care who says anything different.
[14:14] I know it will do it if it can get in
[14:17] the right condition. If the barrels, the
[14:20] bullets and the and all the ballistics
[14:23] of the gun can be studied and fixed down
[14:26] because it done it one time. If it done
[14:29] it once, it'll do it again. Well, that's
[14:32] where he made known to me then. He made
[14:34] me that way on account of the commission
[14:37] that he's given me for these days that
[14:40] I'm living in
[14:43] that I just can't go to a denominational
[14:47] church and join up with one when they
[14:50] just splatter. Well, the church says
[14:52] this is all right and they accept this.
[14:56] If it if if Jesus Christ is the same
[14:59] yesterday, today, and forever, if it
[15:01] drove the bullet there, it'll drive it
[15:03] again. I don't care what they say. See,
[15:05] there's got to be some way that he is
[15:08] the same person.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; He's the same thing. His power is the
[15:12] same. Now, when you hit a place like
[15:14] this, Matthew 28:19
[15:17] that you're asking me about this
[15:19] morning, Acts 2:38,
[15:22] Jesus commissioned his disciples here,
[15:25] "Go ye into all the world and preach the
[15:27] gospel to every creature. He that
[15:29] believeth and is baptized shall be
[15:31] saved." Now, that's Mark 16 I'm quoting
[15:35] from. And now that's when he
[15:37] commissioned him and he never mentioned
[15:38] how to baptize him there. Mark never
[15:40] wrote it down. But Matthew said Matthew
[15:43] 28:19, he said, um, when he appeared to
[15:47] him and so forth and commissioned to go
[15:50] to baptize, he said, "Go ye therefore
[15:53] teach all nations." And the right
[15:56] translation is that is make disciples of
[15:59] all nations.
[16:01] baptizing them into the name of the
[16:03] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[16:05] Ghost, teaching them to observe
[16:07] whatsoever I have commanded.
[16:09] And 10 days later, Peter said, "Repent
[16:13] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[16:15] the name of Jesus Christ."
[16:18] Now, there's a strict contradiction.
[16:21] Now, most people say, "Well, my church
[16:25] teaches be baptized, name of Father,
[16:27] Son, Holy Ghost." The seminary I come
[16:29] out of taught me that. So that's the way
[16:31] I'll do it. To me, that's not right. I'm
[16:34] hitting over here, hitting over there.
[16:35] I'm making a a 40inch group.
[16:39] That ain't make the scriptures right.
[16:41] It's got to zero.
[16:44] It's got to zero. Well, then how does it
[16:46] go to zero? When Matthew said, "Baptize
[16:49] the name of the father, son, holy
[16:50] ghost." And Peter said, "Baptize in the
[16:52] name of the Lord Jesus." Both of them
[16:54] disciples, one a scribe, the other an
[16:55] apostle.
[16:58] And that every person in the Bible was
[17:00] baptized after that was baptized in the
[17:03] name of Jesus Christ. And those who had
[17:05] already been baptized by John had to
[17:07] come and be rebaptized again in the name
[17:09] of Jesus Christ before they got the Holy
[17:11] Ghost.
[17:13] I said, "See, you're not zero there.
[17:18] There's something up." Now, if we
[17:20] believe the Bible to be God's infallible
[17:23] word, we can't make it splatter all over
[17:25] a piece of paper and then be zeroed.
[17:29] You understand me? It's got to hit the
[17:31] target or it ain't hitting.
[17:34] If it's out, it's out. Well, why did
[17:37] Peter turn around and do something Jesus
[17:39] told him not to do? And then God
[17:41] recognized it and give him the Holy
[17:43] Ghost. when when
[17:47] Jesus said baptize him in the name of
[17:49] the father, son, holy ghost and Peter
[17:52] said, "Oh, baptize in the name of of
[17:54] Jesus."
[17:55] Now, you you can't make that hit the
[17:57] target. See, now there's something wrong
[18:00] somewhere, sisters. See, either one lied
[18:03] or which one lied? Which one was it?
[18:07] Now, to me, that just won't work just
[18:09] like it is. uh is uh the baptism of the
[18:12] Holy Ghost evidence speaking in tongues
[18:15] or is it not? Some says yes and some
[18:17] says no. What's the scripture say about
[18:19] it? It's got to zero.
[18:22] I find where some did speak with tongues
[18:24] and some didn't. What is it? Other
[18:27] outstanding question is women to be
[18:29] preachers? Yes or no? Somebody said,
[18:32] "Pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your
[18:34] sons and your daughters shall prophesy."
[18:37] And notice that I forbid not a woman to
[18:38] speak in the church. Even see now that
[18:41] don't zero.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; No,
[18:44] &gt;&gt; it don't zero. So just don't leave it
[18:46] like that because the seminary the
[18:48] factory said it was is that's as good as
[18:49] you're going to get it. No,
[18:53] it's got to zero or it is no good. Well,
[18:57] now if it zeroed for them, it'll zero
[18:59] for me. If it zeroed once and brought a
[19:02] results to claim the resurrection of
[19:04] Jesus Christ with power and signs and
[19:06] miracles and wonders, it'll do it again.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Now, some were we we're we got too much
[19:12] static on the barrel. See what I mean?
[19:15] This is a rude way to express it about
[19:17] shooting a gun, but I'm just I'm put for
[19:20] a base so you understand what I mean.
[19:23] There's static on the barrel somewhere.
[19:25] It's not bedded, right?
[19:28] The power is either too high or too low
[19:31] or either one screw's tight and the
[19:33] other one's loose or one too loose and
[19:34] the other tight and there's something
[19:36] wrong somewhere.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Might be the guy who pull the pull the
[19:38] trigger too.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it might be the guy behind the
[19:41] trigger is right. But now what is it
[19:44] then? Now if there's a contradiction in
[19:47] the word of God so pine point blank as
[19:52] that is
[19:54] then it's not the word of the god that I
[19:56] know.
[19:58] If he can confuse himself and confuse
[20:01] his word
[20:04] and get confused himself he is not
[20:06] infinite.
[20:10] He's finite like I am.
[20:13] Is that right?
[20:15] That word either has to be right and
[20:17] every bit of it right and it's zeroed
[20:21] or either it's not God's word. Now many
[20:25] times people say well you see Peter was
[20:28] all excited
[20:30] when he said baptize the name of Jesus
[20:33] because that really Matthew said exactly
[20:37] what Jesus said. We don't care what
[20:39] Peter said. Well, then if Peter and
[20:42] Jesus wasn't in line with one another,
[20:46] then the rest of the gospels might not
[20:48] be lying with one another. If one word
[20:50] of that contradicts the other one, then
[20:53] it ain't the word of God or the God that
[20:54] I know.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe John made
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, John might have made some. Which
[20:58] one was right? After all, it was I don't
[21:00] know whether Jesus said that or not.
[21:02] See, Matthew wrote it.
[21:05] Mark never said anything about it. Luke
[21:07] never said anything about it. John never
[21:09] said nothing about it, but Matthew did.
[21:12] Well, then maybe all of Matthew's gospel
[21:14] was wrong in Luke's. Well, then which is
[21:17] right and wrong? See where you got
[21:18] yourself? No, sir. It's all got to be
[21:20] right. Then I wonder why would God write
[21:22] a thing like that? Let it be mixed up.
[21:25] Even Jesus thanked his father that he
[21:28] had hid this from the eyes of wise and
[21:30] prudent and revealed it to babes such as
[21:32] would learn. that's done that to throw
[21:35] the the the wise off the track. But the
[21:40] book is a revelation.
[21:43] Now, like when I go overseas and my wife
[21:45] writes me a letter and I sit down. She
[21:47] said, "Dear Billy, I'm sitting here
[21:49] tonight.
[21:51] The children are in bed. I thought I'd
[21:52] write you a few lines, let you know what
[21:54] we did today and how we're getting
[21:56] along. We trust that God is blessing you
[21:59] and all like that." Now, I'm reading off
[22:01] the lines what she's writing.
[22:04] But I'm so in love with my wife and
[22:07] she's so in love with me.
[22:09] No matter what I write, we can read
[22:12] between the lines what we mean. Well,
[22:14] that's the way the Bibles wrote between
[22:16] the lines. You know, many of my sermons
[22:19] like of God turning Abraham and Sarah
[22:21] back to young people. You'd have to you
[22:24] have to read between the lines to see
[22:25] what the scripture says. You have to
[22:27] know. But it'll never get off the line.
[22:29] See, in between the lines will just
[22:31] bring the lines together and make it one
[22:33] big picture.
[22:35] Now, it's got to be a love affair with
[22:38] God before you can ever get it because
[22:40] the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible. And the
[22:42] Bible says that it is of no private
[22:45] interpretation, but it's inspired. Now,
[22:48] to your question,
[22:51] have you got a Bible? Have you all got a
[22:54] Bible? Now, the first No, that's all
[22:57] right. you you can mark it down. Now I'm
[23:00] going to give some illustrations if you
[23:02] don't mind.
[23:04] And in this then you'll you'll see why.
[23:13] Now I want to ask you sisters a
[23:16] question.
[23:17] I want you to be just as free as free
[23:20] can be. I say on this subject on account
[23:23] of this tape because I mean that we
[23:26] could get off on initial evidence and
[23:28] everything else like that, but we'll
[23:30] make another tape for that to you
[23:32] sometime. But this we're talking about
[23:34] the water baptism.
[23:36] Now,
[23:38] it looks like that Matthew and Peter, if
[23:42] they were shooting at the same target,
[23:44] they were well off line somewhere.
[23:47] Now, now I'm going to take in in my
[23:50] Bible and I'm going to read and and you
[23:53] sisters if you want to read want the
[23:56] Bible or you want to mark it down or
[23:57] whatever more you do as you want to. And
[24:00] then I'm going to um I'm going to get
[24:04] you I want you then to um
[24:07] to uh after you do this, write it down.
[24:10] And then if there's any questions, I
[24:12] want you to be sure and and um ask me
[24:17] now.
[24:19] Ask me. So if at any future time on this
[24:23] tape if somebody would have to ask you a
[24:26] question, you might be able to come back
[24:28] and explain it. Now, in order to
[24:31] straighten these people out and to get
[24:35] these two uh uh down right, I'm I'm want
[24:39] to have to make to almost blend two
[24:45] subjects together.
