[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] praise the lord
[38:13] [Music]
[38:16] while we are so standing
[38:20] or maybe let's let's be safe for just a
[38:22] minute please
[38:27] yeah i i had
[38:29] brother daniel giving a testimony
[38:33] tomorrow is his birthday
[38:36] and we we all give the glory for his
[38:38] life
[38:39] because actually it is just by the grace
[38:42] of god
[38:43] he is alive
[38:45] [Music]
[38:48] i remember one day i was going to work
[38:53] we were living in minnetonka at the time
[38:57] and
[38:58] as soon as i was drawing 394 i saw the
[39:01] police lights
[39:04] so i became curious
[39:06] because it was one of those days
[39:08] you'll be sleeping with them and before
[39:10] you realize
[39:11] they are not in the house they are going
[39:12] through the window
[39:14] so
[39:15] he hadn't been in the house for probably
[39:17] three four days
[39:19] so uh when i checked
[39:22] they said there was an accident
[39:25] and he was in minnetonka high at the
[39:28] time
[39:29] uh musicians god bless you i think i'll
[39:31] relieve you for now
[39:34] he was in minnetonka high at the time
[39:38] and according to the news
[39:42] a student in minnetonka high school
[39:46] a 17 year old and he was 17 years at a
[39:49] time
[39:51] in minnetonka high school
[39:54] who went to a record whatever it was and
[39:58] was going back
[40:01] and a car hit him
[40:03] and he died on the spot
[40:06] now we were just it was just less than
[40:08] half half a mile
[40:10] from where we were living
[40:13] so you put
[40:15] all the the puzzles together
[40:17] and it gets
[40:19] i mean it gets
[40:21] so close
[40:23] for comfort
[40:25] i said what
[40:27] daniel didn't sleep in this house
[40:29] last night this guy didn't sleep in his
[40:32] house last night
[40:35] whoever it was 17 years old danielle is
[40:38] 17.
[40:39] minnetonka high school he's in
[40:41] minnetonka high school
[40:44] this description
[40:46] comes too close for comfort
[40:48] i got to work
[40:50] i tried to work i never told my wife
[40:54] but
[40:54] i wasn't able to work
[40:57] and a part of me was saying this could
[40:59] be your son
[41:01] and a part of me
[41:03] could not even react to it
[41:06] so i was saying if it happens to be
[41:08] danny
[41:09] how am i going to tell my wife
[41:12] i tried to work i couldn't but i just
[41:14] went
[41:16] googled
[41:17] and lo and
[41:18] behold it was not danny it was somebody
[41:21] else
[41:23] and then i put it behind me
[41:25] so it is just the grace of god
[41:29] if you actually want to see the grace of
[41:31] god if you have known them before and
[41:34] you see them now
[41:36] you can see the grace of god at work
[41:39] praise be to god so we thank god for his
[41:41] life
[41:41] and we are trusting god for more of him
[41:44] praise be to god

[43:16] laodiceans right

[43:32] i know thy works
[43:34] that thou art neither cold
[43:37] nor heart

[43:59] and increase with goose
[44:01] and have need of nothing
[44:04] and know if not
[44:06] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[44:08] poor and blind and naked
[44:11] what a contrast
[44:13] i counseled thee to buy of me
[44:17] gold tried in the fire
[44:19] that thou mayest be rich
[44:22] and white remember
[44:24] that thou mayest be clothed
[44:26] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[44:29] not appear
[44:30] and anoint thine eyes with i self
[44:34] that thou mayest see
[44:37] verse 19
[44:38] as many as i love
[44:40] i rebuke
[44:42] and chasten
[44:43] be zealous therefore
[44:45] and repent
[44:46] praise be to god
[44:49] may the lord add his blessings to the
[44:51] reading of switch shall we be seated
[44:57] now
[44:59] i titled this message
[45:02] moving forward in retrogression
[45:08] i wouldn't say i titled it
[45:11] actually i had two titles for this
[45:16] and i was wondering which one to use
[45:18] but for some reason i was just not
[45:21] comfortable
[45:22] i was thinking either this either that
[45:25] but then i prayed and i left my computer
[45:28] i went up at work i was doing something
[45:32] and then from nowhere
[45:34] this just jumped in
[45:36] moving forward in retrogression
[45:39] now i had an idea
[45:41] already of what it means to retrogress
[45:45] but then i decided to go and look for
[45:47] the meaning
[45:50] and the word retrogression here
[45:54] means
[45:55] a process
[45:57] of returning to an earlier state
[46:01] typically a west one
[46:05] a process
[46:07] of returning to an earlier state
[46:11] typically
[46:12] a west one
[46:14] so moving forward in retrogression
[46:17] now what a contrast
[46:21] just like the scripture we just read
[46:25] there was a sharp contrast
[46:27] and when you look at the theme here
[46:31] it's a contrast it's a paradox
[46:34] how can you be moving forward
[46:36] and yet in retrogression
[46:40] praise be to god
[46:42] this is just a little
[46:45] teaching we're going to have this
[46:47] morning
[46:48] for the next 40 45 minutes maybe an hour
[46:51] i'm not sure
[46:53] but we are just trusting god
[46:56] sometimes
[46:59] it's not
[47:00] the message maybe it's not for everybody
[47:03] i don't know
[47:05] maybe it is in the case of leaving the
[47:07] 99 and wait for the one i don't know
[47:13] one brother brother wesley prayed
[47:18] he was asking that the lord should make
[47:20] us be on fire
[47:23] and that will shouldn't be lukewarm
[47:25] and here we are reading from revelations
[47:28] 3 14 that talks about what lukewarmness
[47:33] and this morning as i was seated in the
[47:35] pastor's office
[47:38] and the sunday school started playing
[47:40] it went right there
[47:43] in fact i don't know if our sound
[47:46] technicians
[47:47] can get the sunday school ready
[47:49] um again we are not going to play it
[47:52] probably the first two three minutes
[47:54] there was something about it
[47:57] it was it was like talking about my
[47:59] message
[48:02] uh it's just
[48:03] how things just dovetailed
[48:09] and it's not for the fun of it
[48:12] praise be to god
[48:14] you love the lord
[48:17] we thank god for his grace what i want
[48:20] to say
[48:23] as the bible enjoins us
[48:26] love the lord
[48:27] with all your heart and with all your
[48:29] soul
[48:31] love the lord
[48:33] with every fiber of your being
[48:35] with all your strength
[48:38] with every ounce of breath
[48:40] in your lungs
[48:42] he first loved us so we
[48:45] could love him back
[48:48] love the lord
[48:50] do not love god
[48:54] because you want to go to heaven
[48:58] love god because you love him
[49:00] serve god out of love
[49:09] let your relationship with god
[49:12] base solely
[49:14] on love
[49:19] praise be to god
[49:23] anything outside of love
[49:26] you are building on the wrong foundation
[49:33] let it be love centered
[49:38] we are not serving god because we want
[49:41] to go to heaven
[49:43] we know
[49:44] he has made us a promise
[49:48] that in my father's house are many
[49:50] mansions
[49:52] and i if it were not so i would have
[49:54] told you and i got to prepare you a
[49:56] place and i will come and receive you
[49:59] unto myself
[50:00] that where i am there you may be also
[50:03] it's a promise
[50:05] and god is obligated to his promise
[50:10] so we know that eventually we are going
[50:14] to go to heaven
[50:16] but we are not serving god because we
[50:19] want to go to heaven we are serving god
[50:22] because we love him
[50:27] i remember i still remember that chopper
[50:30] i don't know how many of you here know
[50:31] what a chopper is but let's talk about
[50:33] let's talk about restaurant
[50:35] okay so we can we all be on the same
[50:37] page
[50:38] i went to a restaurant one time i still
[50:40] remember the face and the person i got
[50:43] in before him
[50:44] we were working in the same i was a
[50:46] prisoner at the time he was sinner in
[50:48] rank
[50:50] and he came and met me with a
[50:52] cook and then he sat and then we just
[50:56] greeted
[50:57] and when i got through and i was living
[50:59] he said something
[51:01] he said this god you guys are talking
[51:03] about what if tomorrow you get there and
[51:06] you realize that there is no heaven
[51:12] i just smiled and walked out
[51:15] if it were today
[51:16] i would have probably chewed him
[51:20] and guess what 20-something years later
[51:24] joshua goes to work and he comes back
[51:27] and he's telling me a story
[51:29] how a man i actually know told him that
[51:33] he's having you guys are talking about
[51:34] what if tomorrow you get there and there
[51:36] is nothing like heaven
[51:40] you realize that it is the same devil
[51:42] he never changes
[51:46] heaven and hell are real
[51:52] and i say again
[51:55] never serve god
[51:59] because
[52:02] you want to go to heaven
[52:06] save him
[52:08] out of love
[52:10] there are people that will go to heaven
[52:13] and there are people that will go to
[52:14] hell
[52:16] but god did not prepare hell
[52:19] for any human being but satan and his
[52:22] fallen angels
[52:25] the choices you make in life today have
[52:28] great eternal
[52:30] consequences it is going to be your
[52:33] choice
[52:34] where you end up it's going to be your
[52:36] choice
[52:44] and people make fun
[52:48] if god was coming he should have come by
[52:50] now
[52:51] what are you guys talking about
[52:53] god should have come by now
[52:56] how many years we've been hearing this
[52:58] over and over god should have come by
[53:00] now what are they talking about
[53:05] he made a promise he is going to come
[53:10] the bible says that
[53:12] god is not slack
[53:15] concerning his promise
[53:17] as some men count slackness
[53:20] but he is long suffering to ask lord
[53:24] not willing that any man should perish
[53:27] but that we may all come unto repentance
[53:33] praise be to god
[53:36] think about it
[53:40] if god had come maybe 20 years ago
[53:43] where would you and i be
[53:49] you don't have to worry when he is
[53:51] coming
[53:52] that should not be your headache
[53:55] what you should worry about
[53:57] is living the life
[53:59] what you should worry about is
[54:01] reflecting christ
[54:04] what you should worry about is serving
[54:07] him
[54:15] love god with all your heart
[54:19] and if you love god it doesn't matter
[54:21] who is standing behind a puppet you'll
[54:23] find you will not find an excuse to stay
[54:25] away
[54:26] you will make sure you are in church to
[54:28] save god
[54:30] it doesn't matter whether you agree with
[54:31] a man or not it doesn't matter whether
[54:33] it's your best preacher or not
[54:35] you would come to church because your
[54:37] love is towards god and not the man
[54:39] [Music]
[54:41] praise be to god
[54:47] oh if god was coming he should have been
[54:48] here by now
[54:53] if he was here 10 years ago how many of
[54:55] us would be would have gone
[54:58] if he came five years ago how many of us
[55:00] would have gone
[55:02] now we are talking of 20 10 15. let's
[55:05] talk about today
[55:06] amen if christ should come now how many
[55:10] of us here are ready to go
[55:13] praise god i see some hands up
[55:22] so do not worry
[55:23] about when he is coming
[55:26] when brother wilson came here last two
[55:28] weeks ago he sat in all of his
[55:30] missionary trips when he goes he is
[55:33] looking for that last one
[55:36] who the last one is nobody knows
[55:40] it may be your neighbor the neighbor you
[55:42] are forcing and fighting with every day
[55:44] it may be your supervisor the supervisor
[55:47] you never agree with
[55:48] because the devil knows the day you
[55:50] agree with and you sit down to talk you
[55:52] are going to speak words of wisdom that
[55:54] will lead them to the house of god
[56:02] so do not worry
[56:04] about when he is coming
[56:07] all you have to worry
[56:09] about being
[56:11] in the world
[56:14] living by the world
[56:18] all you have to worry is keep pressing
[56:20] on
[56:21] keep pressing on
[56:24] every day you leave keep pressing on he
[56:27] said brother i've been president for 20
[56:29] years yes keep pressing on
[56:32] i've been president for 40 years yes
[56:34] keep pressing on
[56:36] i've been president for a year praise
[56:38] god keep pressing on
[56:41] never relent in your work with god
[56:44] keep pressing on the upward way that is
[56:47] all we can do
[56:50] whilst we are waiting on him keep
[56:52] pressing up
[56:55] the devil will try to give you excuses
[56:58] why you should stay away keep pressing
[57:00] on
[57:02] anything that would keep you away except
[57:05] when you are not sick or you are not
[57:06] feeling fine but if anything that will
[57:08] keep you away from service is nothing
[57:10] but satan
[57:13] if you have to drag your carcass to the
[57:15] house of god drag it anyhow
[57:18] sometimes we are sick and we'll find an
[57:20] excuse to go to work because if we don't
[57:21] go they'll fire us or we'll have points
[57:24] so we'll go to work anyhow
[57:26] but then when it comes to going to the
[57:28] house of god we have all the fine fine
[57:30] excuses we can give
[57:32] praise be to god
[57:35] keep pressing on the best way you know
[57:40] we all have things to deal with
[57:43] and yet
[57:45] we are pressing on
[57:47] we are pressing on
[57:51] do not look for that golden opportunity
[57:53] because that golden opportunity may
[57:55] never come
[57:58] the golden opportunity is now
[58:00] now that you are seated in the house of
[58:02] god strong and healthy hearing the word
[58:04] of god that is the golden opportunity
[58:08] amen
[58:15] do not look for any golden opportunity
[58:19] the bible says from the days of john the
[58:21] baptist until now
[58:23] the kingdom of god
[58:25] suffers violence and the violence
[58:27] ticketed by force
[58:33] we were not against flesh and blood but
[58:35] against principalities forces of
[58:36] darkness evil spirits
[58:38] we are taking it by force
[58:42] and when you go to the book of nehemiah
[58:44] and in
[58:46] in the rebuilding of the temple walls
[58:49] there was no peace
[58:51] they
[58:52] rebuilt it in the time of war
[58:54] those that were up there and laying the
[58:56] stones had their souls on their side
[59:01] men were downtime in their boots with
[59:04] their soul with their spears ready to go
[59:06] to war
[59:08] somewhere cutting materials building
[59:10] materials with one hand and in the other
[59:12] hand
[59:12] there was a weapon
[59:15] do not wait for that golden opportunity
[59:19] just keep pressing on in here
[59:22] keep pressing on
[59:24] when we went to
[59:26] [Music]
[59:27] sis eunice and sis becky's
[59:31] graduation
[59:35] the the lady that came to open the
[59:37] ceremony said something
[59:39] actually it was a quote and i love west
[59:42] of philosophy a lot
[59:44] as much as her love stories
[59:46] and she quoted something somebody i
[59:50] didn't actually hear the name until i
[59:52] was getting ready
[59:54] and it struck me i said let me find out
[59:57] who was this person so i went and
[1:00:00] searched and it happened to be martin
[1:00:03] luther king jr
[1:00:05] she said if you can't fly
[1:00:10] run
[1:00:12] if you can't run
[1:00:15] then walk
[1:00:17] if you can't walk
[1:00:19] then crawl
[1:00:23] and in the concluding part of this quote
[1:00:26] he said whatever you find yourself doing
[1:00:30] keep moving forward
[1:00:33] keep moving forward
[1:00:36] and that comes so close to to to my to
[1:00:39] my
[1:00:40] to my title this morning
[1:00:42] moving forward in retrogression
[1:00:45] whatever you do
[1:00:47] keep moving forward
[1:00:51] fly if you can
[1:00:53] if you can't
[1:00:54] run
[1:00:56] run as fast as you can if you can't walk
[1:01:00] walk as fast as you can if you can't
[1:01:03] crawl
[1:01:05] and i want to add
[1:01:07] that it may happen that
[1:01:09] you don't even find your posit yourself
[1:01:11] in the position to crawl
[1:01:12] and you may find yourself lying on your
[1:01:15] back
[1:01:16] i encourage you to just roll
[1:01:20] praise be to god
[1:01:22] just row
[1:01:24] you may be happy to find yourself on top
[1:01:26] of a hill
[1:01:28] and you have the slope beneath you
[1:01:30] just row
[1:01:32] you may run faster than somebody that is
[1:01:35] walking
[1:01:36] you may end up in the valley dead
[1:01:38] but one thing i can guarantee you by the
[1:01:40] grace of god you will not die lying down
[1:01:46] keep moving on
[1:01:49] there was a
[1:01:53] who went to church
[1:01:55] and they were singing that song
[1:01:59] in a dialect saying
[1:02:00] metya methya brown samso methyl brown
[1:02:03] samso
[1:02:04] which means that i step on satan
[1:02:07] that's what it means to translate it i
[1:02:09] step on satan
[1:02:11] and this was just
[1:02:12] enjoying the lord singing i stepped on
[1:02:15] such a step on satan yes satan belongs
[1:02:18] under our feet that is why he is
[1:02:21] now
[1:02:22] it is not room
[1:02:24] satan being under your feet
[1:02:28] is not
[1:02:30] room
[1:02:31] for you to be reckless
[1:02:34] no
[1:02:35] that is when you ought to be very
[1:02:37] careful in your work with god
[1:02:40] because satan is under your feet
[1:02:44] when a man is falling
[1:02:47] when i go out there and there is snow
[1:02:49] and the ground is slippery i walk like
[1:02:52] um
[1:02:54] like a penguin you know how a penguin
[1:02:56] works
[1:02:57] very short steps
[1:03:00] so when i slide
[1:03:01] i quickly balance myself up
[1:03:06] because if you don't know how to walk
[1:03:08] before you are aware your legs will be
[1:03:09] in the air
[1:03:13] i remember one time since comfort
[1:03:16] brother brother williams um wife came to
[1:03:18] my house and he was he was in she was in
[1:03:21] the car with my wife and i just came
[1:03:23] down we were living in plymouth at the
[1:03:25] time i was just walking briskly i didn't
[1:03:28] know it was slippery and then i
[1:03:30] disappeared
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:39] sister comfort was looking at me through
[1:03:40] the window coming
[1:03:42] when she saw me disappear
[1:03:45] and she turned to my wife
[1:03:47] oh this is the photo i have not seen
[1:03:49] your husband again no
[1:03:53] that was a very nice way of seeing your
[1:03:54] husband is on the ground
[1:04:00] so satan is under your feet
[1:04:03] that means you ought to be careful where
[1:04:06] you go
[1:04:07] be careful what steps you take
[1:04:10] be careful how you walk
[1:04:12] because your enemy he is not lying down
[1:04:15] there
[1:04:16] just as a dormant
[1:04:18] he is our adversary he is fighting us
[1:04:21] and he is under your feet
[1:04:24] you think he is going to make it easy
[1:04:26] for you
[1:04:28] when you enter there and there are
[1:04:30] stumps do you just walk anyhow or you
[1:04:33] lift your leg when you see a stump
[1:04:35] it calls for caution
[1:04:39] praise be to god
[1:04:41] he is under our feet anyhow and that is
[1:04:44] what he is going to be
[1:04:45] but you ought to be careful how you walk
[1:04:49] because if you walk recklessly it's
[1:04:51] going to cost you
[1:04:56] and this people yes i suppose satan i
[1:04:59] step on satan
[1:05:00] and in the night he goes to bed and he
[1:05:03] gets a dream
[1:05:04] the devil comes
[1:05:06] wake up wake up then he wakes up
[1:05:10] are you
[1:05:11] in church
[1:05:13] when they were singing i stepped on
[1:05:15] satan i stepped on satan
[1:05:19] you were also there singing i stepped on
[1:05:20] satan i step on satan
[1:05:24] do you stand by it
[1:05:26] he said yes
[1:05:29] this is why you have to worship god with
[1:05:31] conviction
[1:05:34] worship god with conviction
[1:05:39] let it be settled here
[1:05:43] that there is nothing that is going to
[1:05:45] take you away from the love of god
[1:05:48] if they have to sow you asunder
[1:05:51] let them do it but keep believing
[1:05:54] praise be to god he says yes i stand by
[1:05:57] it
[1:05:58] do not worship god according to somebody
[1:06:01] else's conviction let it be your
[1:06:03] personal conviction
[1:06:07] he said yes i stand by it
[1:06:10] it's not what my church says this is
[1:06:12] what the church is but what do you say
[1:06:15] this is what the church stands for but
[1:06:17] what do you stand for amen
[1:06:21] the church just says this the chair says
[1:06:23] that but what do you say
[1:06:26] he says yes i stand for it
[1:06:29] he said yes you know when i checked you
[1:06:32] don't have legs
[1:06:35] so with what legs were you stepping on
[1:06:37] satan
[1:06:39] and then he just sat down
[1:06:41] and i thought came to him he said you
[1:06:43] know what
[1:06:44] i'm glad i didn't even have legs
[1:06:47] and even if i had legs i was not going
[1:06:50] to use those legs
[1:06:52] i borrowed the legs of jesus
[1:06:54] and it was the lust of jesus i used to
[1:06:56] stamp on you
[1:06:58] and the devil just jumped back
[1:07:00] he said yes if you do
[1:07:03] i'm going to do it again
[1:07:04] i step on you with less of faith
[1:07:07] in the name of jesus i step on you
[1:07:09] then the devil just jumped it's oh no i
[1:07:12] was just checking
[1:07:13] he said look i step on you with the legs
[1:07:16] of jesus
[1:07:18] then the devil disappeared
[1:07:20] now
[1:07:21] know that it is not your strength
[1:07:24] your strength would fail
[1:07:26] he is our strength
[1:07:28] it is not your righteousness
[1:07:31] your righteousness your righteousness is
[1:07:32] as filthy as the as filthy rocks in the
[1:07:35] sight of the father
[1:07:38] it is his righteousness
[1:07:40] praise be to god
[1:07:42] keep moving forward
[1:07:45] and keep trusting and believing
[1:07:48] knowing that it is not your strength
[1:07:51] knowing that it is not what you can do
[1:07:53] it is what he has already done
[1:07:56] praise be to god
[1:07:59] whatever you do
[1:08:01] keep moving forward
[1:08:05] know that you are a child of promise
[1:08:08] we have so much power and authority in
[1:08:11] our lives
[1:08:14] and when you know the power and
[1:08:16] authority you have in your life as a
[1:08:18] child of god
[1:08:20] the hell
[1:08:23] death and grave can never hold you back
[1:08:29] death hell and grave
[1:08:32] can never hold you back
[1:08:34] remember
[1:08:36] i say it's just going to be a little
[1:08:38] teaching
[1:08:39] for sunday morning
[1:08:41] and
[1:08:42] we'll be reading i don't i don't think
[1:08:44] we'll read a lot of scriptures here
[1:08:46] but
[1:08:47] actually
[1:08:49] when when they started playing the the
[1:08:51] the sunday school
[1:08:53] they just went
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:56] on
[1:08:58] right on
[1:09:01] and i'll be very happy
[1:09:04] if they come start exactly where they
[1:09:07] started from
[1:09:09] exactly where they started from
[1:09:11] and it was right on
[1:09:16] if we can just sit for a minute or two
[1:09:20] while they play it
[1:09:21] i want to take it up from there
[1:09:42] now what god saw was entirely different
[1:09:44] from what they said they saw
[1:09:46] they said that they were rich in goods
[1:09:48] and spiritually wealthy they had arrived
[1:09:51] they had need of nothing
[1:09:53] but god saw it otherwise
[1:09:55] he said
[1:09:56] you don't know this but you are wretched
[1:09:58] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:10:02] now when a people are that way
[1:10:03] especially naked and don't know it
[1:10:06] there has to be something awfully wrong
[1:10:08] surely something must be happening
[1:10:11] is it not that god has blinded their
[1:10:13] eyes as he did to the jews
[1:10:15] is the gospel going back to the jews
[1:10:17] is history repeating itself
[1:10:20] i say it is
[1:10:22] god says this church of the laodicean
[1:10:24] age is wretched
[1:10:26] that word comes from two greek words
[1:10:28] which mean endure and trial
[1:10:30] and it has nothing to do with the trials
[1:10:32] that come to a true christian for god
[1:10:34] describes a christian in trial as
[1:10:36] blessed
[1:10:37] and his attitude one of joy
[1:10:39] whereas this description is phrased as
[1:10:42] wretched and miserable how strange
[1:10:45] in this age of plenty in this age of
[1:10:47] progress in this age of abundance how
[1:10:50] can there be trials
[1:10:52] well now it is strange
[1:10:54] but in this age of plenty and
[1:10:55] opportunity when everyone has so much
[1:10:58] and there is so much more to be had
[1:11:00] but with all the inventions to do our
[1:11:02] work and so many things to give us
[1:11:04] pleasure suddenly
[1:11:05] we find mental illness taking such a
[1:11:07] toll as to alarm the nation
[1:11:10] when everybody ought to be happy with
[1:11:12] really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:11:14] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:11:16] pep pills in the morning
[1:11:18] rushing to doctors entering institutions
[1:11:20] and trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:11:22] alcohol
[1:11:24] yes this age boasts of its tremendous
[1:11:26] stories of worldly goods
[1:11:28] but the people are less happy than ever
[1:11:31] this age boasts of its spiritual
[1:11:32] attainments but the people are less sure
[1:11:35] of themselves than ever
[1:11:37] this age boasts of better moral values
[1:11:39] and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:11:41] since the flood
[1:11:43] it talks about its knowledge and science
[1:11:45] but it is fighting a losing battle in
[1:11:47] all fields for the human mind and soul
[1:11:50] and spirit cannot comprehend or keep
[1:11:52] abreast with all the changes that have
[1:11:54] come upon the earth
[1:11:56] in one generation we have gone all the
[1:11:58] way from the horse and buggy
[1:12:00] to the space age and we are proud
[1:12:03] god bless you
[1:12:05] praise be to god he is just talking
[1:12:09] exactly about what i have here
[1:12:13] that in this day and age when we boast
[1:12:15] of plenty one will boast of what
[1:12:18] abundance one will boast of what worldly
[1:12:21] goose when we say we have it all
[1:12:26] we realize that
[1:12:28] we are wretched we are poor we are naked
[1:12:32] there is nothing we can boast
[1:12:37] moving forward in retrogression
[1:12:41] we can just close our bibles at this
[1:12:43] point pray and go home
[1:12:46] praise be to god
[1:12:48] i believe strongly that there is a
[1:12:50] reason why god wants us to talk about
[1:12:52] this why i do not know
[1:12:54] because everything just seems to fall in
[1:12:57] place
[1:12:58] praise be to god
[1:13:00] now i just want to jump forward here
[1:13:08] because
[1:13:09] what he's talking about is right from
[1:13:11] revelation 3 14
[1:13:15] and he has even laid the foundation
[1:13:17] better than i would have done
[1:13:21] so what i have here
[1:13:23] i'm going to skip it
[1:13:26] now bye brandon says
[1:13:30] in the message i was not disobedient
[1:13:33] to the heavenly vision
[1:13:36] in a word of prayer he said father
[1:13:40] who brought again the lord jesus to life
[1:13:45] though all the world seems to be so
[1:13:48] modernistic
[1:13:50] and they are going lord to knowledge
[1:13:53] instead of just a simple faith in god
[1:13:56] we realize that
[1:13:58] in the garden of eden
[1:14:00] when they tested the tree of knowledge
[1:14:03] they broke off
[1:14:05] relationship with the tree of life
[1:14:09] and since then
[1:14:10] man has went after knowledge and
[1:14:13] destroys himself
[1:14:15] every time he buys
[1:14:17] from the tree
[1:14:19] gunpowder
[1:14:21] automobiles
[1:14:22] and now an atomic bomb
[1:14:25] knowledge knowledge
[1:14:27] truly the prophet daniel said
[1:14:29] they will run to and fro
[1:14:31] and knowledge shall increase
[1:14:34] but back tonight
[1:14:36] at a blackness of two thousand years of
[1:14:39] two thousand years past
[1:14:41] to faith in lord jesus in the lord jesus
[1:14:44] ministered by a gift
[1:14:47] of healing
[1:14:48] by an angel
[1:14:51] i believe we are living in the latter
[1:14:53] time
[1:14:55] i do not want
[1:14:57] any of you to go away and say that
[1:15:00] brother branham said that
[1:15:01] jesus
[1:15:02] would be here in a certain amount of
[1:15:04] time
[1:15:05] i do not know
[1:15:07] but i believe as far as i know
[1:15:11] the scriptures
[1:15:12] that something's got to happen soon
[1:15:16] the world is in a terrible condition
[1:15:20] and i was thinking
[1:15:21] i was just thinking a few moments ago
[1:15:24] upon the subject of science
[1:15:26] and
[1:15:28] i just
[1:15:30] thinking of how that science
[1:15:33] how they are taking
[1:15:36] the natural man and how he went into the
[1:15:39] research
[1:15:40] from the fall
[1:15:42] of the natural
[1:15:44] and what he has done
[1:15:47] and how little
[1:15:48] the spiritual man has progressed in the
[1:15:51] kingdom of god
[1:15:53] and i was thinking
[1:15:54] that a natural man went out
[1:15:57] at the unseen
[1:15:59] of his eyes and pulled an atom down
[1:16:03] out of the sky and split
[1:16:07] and split that atom into two
[1:16:10] that destroys human human life
[1:16:14] and if the natural man
[1:16:17] that knows nothing of god and cannot
[1:16:20] know nothing of god except
[1:16:23] he be converted
[1:16:24] then he so becomes a life with a
[1:16:26] supernatural if he could do that
[1:16:30] in the natural realm
[1:16:32] what ought
[1:16:34] the man of god to be doing
[1:16:39] my friends the church is so far behind
[1:16:46] talking about how the natural man has
[1:16:49] progressed
[1:16:53] by the church of the living god
[1:16:56] is left
[1:16:58] so far behind
[1:17:00] let's pray
[1:17:04] my god that that that god will move his
[1:17:07] church up
[1:17:09] the natural man with a natural resource
[1:17:12] is getting greater results
[1:17:15] than people
[1:17:16] that
[1:17:18] call themselves
[1:17:20] christians
[1:17:23] let's press
[1:17:24] into the unseen
[1:17:27] the blessings are yours
[1:17:30] they are for you
[1:17:32] the prophet of god speaking
[1:17:34] praise be to god
[1:17:36] now when you look at the natural man
[1:17:42] in his natural environment
[1:17:47] with the wisdom of man
[1:17:53] and you look at the accomplishment
[1:17:57] he has gotten
[1:18:00] the spiritual man
[1:18:04] who has
[1:18:05] the word of god the living word of god
[1:18:09] not the wisdom of
[1:18:11] has never been able
[1:18:14] to match that
[1:18:21] the natural man
[1:18:24] in his natural environment
[1:18:27] has been by far
[1:18:29] what the spiritual man has accomplished
[1:18:33] when you look at the area of information
[1:18:36] technology
[1:18:38] we are living in a from information age
[1:18:41] but if you want an age
[1:18:46] that is most uninformed it is this age
[1:18:50] what a paradox
[1:18:52] that we are living in an information age
[1:18:56] but we are very uninformed
[1:19:00] if you are also looking for a people
[1:19:02] that were very ill informed it is in
[1:19:05] this age
[1:19:07] what a paradox
[1:19:09] that we are living
[1:19:11] in the most informative age and yes
[1:19:14] yet we are very ill-informed
[1:19:20] anything you are looking for
[1:19:22] you just go out there and
[1:19:24] you will find the answers
[1:19:28] in the field of commerce
[1:19:32] this time you don't even have to go out
[1:19:35] you can sit in your room
[1:19:37] just on your laptop or on your phone
[1:19:40] and you can shop anywhere in the world
[1:19:45] and not only that
[1:19:47] you can track whatever you are ordering
[1:19:49] from the warehouse
[1:19:52] you know the curia
[1:19:55] you just log into that website and you
[1:19:58] see something like a radar and you can
[1:20:00] see your good that coming on the screen
[1:20:03] you know when it enters the country you
[1:20:06] know when the van is out for
[1:20:07] distribution you know when they put it
[1:20:09] in front of your door mouth
[1:20:14] knowledge indeed has abound
[1:20:18] knowledge indeed has abound
[1:20:22] and the bible says in the end time
[1:20:25] knowledge
[1:20:27] would abound
[1:20:28] we indeed are living in the end time
[1:20:32] when you go to the
[1:20:34] that matthew marty 24
[1:20:36] it talks
[1:20:38] about the end time
[1:20:41] there will be wars
[1:20:43] there will be rumors of war nations who
[1:20:46] rise against nations
[1:20:48] there will be earthquakes in diverse
[1:20:50] places
[1:20:53] for the love
[1:20:55] the love of man who was called because
[1:20:57] of illiquity
[1:20:58] i mean you just go through the list
[1:21:01] and nothing tells you
[1:21:03] that indeed there is no more time
[1:21:08] there is no more
[1:21:12] time the bible says teach us how to
[1:21:16] number our days
[1:21:17] that we may apply
[1:21:19] our hearts unto wisdom
[1:21:26] live today like tomorrow is never going
[1:21:29] to come
[1:21:31] tomorrow may not come
[1:21:34] it may come
[1:21:36] but leave today
[1:21:37] like tomorrow may never come
[1:21:46] what are you waiting on
[1:21:51] if there is anything to make right this
[1:21:54] is the time to make it right
[1:21:56] we believe in a definite convention
[1:21:58] confession
[1:21:59] but how many people
[1:22:01] are ever going to have that opportunity
[1:22:04] where you'll be lying down and you are
[1:22:06] in pain and the doctor is telling you
[1:22:08] that you know what
[1:22:09] um you are not going to go home uh this
[1:22:12] is the end and you are thinking oh get
[1:22:15] the man of god around let them pray
[1:22:18] no this is the time
[1:22:20] amen amen
[1:22:23] do not wait
[1:22:27] praise be to god
[1:22:29] knowledge indeed
[1:22:32] has abound
[1:22:36] when you look at
[1:22:40] the military
[1:22:41] warfare in fact if there should be a
[1:22:43] world where today a world war today
[1:22:47] the other day i was thinking about it
[1:22:49] i said
[1:22:50] the world would probably end before it
[1:22:53] starts
[1:22:58] we are living in the most dangerous
[1:23:00] times i know children of god we don't
[1:23:03] have to worry about that
[1:23:04] because we know before that terminal
[1:23:07] sets in on this land by the grace of god
[1:23:10] will be gone
[1:23:14] but if there should be a third world war
[1:23:18] it may not take minutes
[1:23:25] russia
[1:23:27] launched
[1:23:28] its latest missile
[1:23:32] a few weeks ago a hypersonic missile
[1:23:36] that travels 28 times the speed of sound
[1:23:41] and they call it rs2
[1:23:43] satan 2.
[1:23:46] that is the name they have given it
[1:23:47] satan too
[1:23:51] and according to military analysts
[1:23:53] there is no radar anywhere in the world
[1:23:56] that can pick that up
[1:24:01] there is no radar
[1:24:03] when the prophet of god said watch
[1:24:05] russia the king of the north he meant
[1:24:08] watch russia the king of the north
[1:24:12] at work in different places and even
[1:24:15] when you listen to the news they'll be
[1:24:16] talking of how strong america is america
[1:24:20] is a military might yes it is
[1:24:23] but i tend
[1:24:25] to look at the prophecy
[1:24:29] praise be to god
[1:24:32] what is going on behind the scenes
[1:24:34] my goodness
[1:24:38] it's not
[1:24:40] there is no place under the sun that is
[1:24:42] safe
[1:24:43] the only safest place
[1:24:46] is here
[1:24:48] that is the only surface ground
[1:24:52] if there is anything to boast off
[1:24:55] it is this
[1:24:57] praise be to god and there is life in
[1:25:00] the word of god
[1:25:02] don't let anybody deceive you
[1:25:05] somewhere i don't tell anything
[1:25:06] somewhere in the south some years ago
[1:25:09] somebody had his bible i think it was a
[1:25:12] lady lying in her car
[1:25:14] and for some reason the cow caught fire
[1:25:17] the cow consumed that the fire consumed
[1:25:20] the car by the bible no fire fire never
[1:25:23] touched the bible
[1:25:27] what are you telling me
[1:25:29] there is life in the word of god
[1:25:32] praise be to god
[1:25:34] and somewhere right here in minnesota
[1:25:37] and they said it was a children's bible
[1:25:40] i've forgotten the city you can google
[1:25:42] that a children's bible
[1:25:44] a house caught fire
[1:25:46] but it left the children's bible alone
[1:25:53] there is no
[1:25:55] safe place under the sun
[1:26:00] what you think is a safe ground it's a
[1:26:02] sinking sun
[1:26:05] the only thing you can depend on
[1:26:07] and the only place to put your hope
[1:26:10] is in the word of god
[1:26:13] praise be to god
[1:26:15] praise be to god
[1:26:18] we are living in the most dangerous
[1:26:20] times
[1:26:24] look at espionage we are talking about
[1:26:26] what knowledge and what knowledge has
[1:26:28] accomplished what the nature man has
[1:26:30] accomplished that the spiritual man
[1:26:33] has not been able to compete with is
[1:26:35] very sad
[1:26:37] remember
[1:26:39] we are talking about moving forward in
[1:26:42] retrogression
[1:26:45] what a miserable state to be in
[1:26:47] i pray god gives us grace
[1:26:50] to see it through the same spectrum
[1:26:58] gunway does this
[1:27:00] countries after now till tomorrow
[1:27:02] they'll be spying on one another
[1:27:04] it's something people do for it for
[1:27:06] living
[1:27:07] they used to send men on the boots men
[1:27:10] with boots on the ground
[1:27:11] but what do they do now
[1:27:13] they just sit down
[1:27:16] and they have what satellites i believe
[1:27:20] in the space
[1:27:21] of america alone we have more satellites
[1:27:23] than we have cities in the world
[1:27:26] spying over one and
[1:27:28] one another
[1:27:31] they have drones
[1:27:33] they have sun drones
[1:27:34] to go and gather surveillance
[1:27:37] they just sit down
[1:27:39] and they know what is going on
[1:27:48] knowledge
[1:27:49] indeed has abound
[1:27:52] and when i sometimes think of what the
[1:27:54] natural man has accomplished i ask
[1:27:56] myself what next is science going to do
[1:28:02] it's like they have accomplished
[1:28:03] everything and before i'm away they come
[1:28:05] up with something strange again
[1:28:09] so in spite of the accomplishment the
[1:28:12] natural man has had he is never
[1:28:15] satisfied
[1:28:16] he is never tired
[1:28:18] they have achieved so much
[1:28:21] and yet there is no complacency but when
[1:28:24] it comes to the spiritual man
[1:28:26] we are complacent over little or nothing
[1:28:33] we have achieved very little
[1:28:36] and yet
[1:28:40] we complain
[1:28:45] the natural man
[1:28:47] is sitting on the moon
[1:28:49] trying to colonize
[1:28:51] the heavenly bodies
[1:28:54] they are not satisfied and we are here
[1:28:56] the spiritual man fighting and fishing
[1:28:58] over everything
[1:29:01] how the seals are not open
[1:29:04] how the prophet is this how the prophet
[1:29:06] is that
[1:29:08] if we don't agree with you we'll hack
[1:29:09] you down
[1:29:11] they went out of us so they are not
[1:29:13] children of god
[1:29:17] oh it's just sad
[1:29:19] it's sad
[1:29:21] that in this message
[1:29:24] in the message of our lord jesus christ
[1:29:27] the message is not abraham's message
[1:29:30] is the message of the lord jesus christ
[1:29:32] himself
[1:29:33] that we call ourselves the bride
[1:29:36] and we can fast and fuse and disagree
[1:29:39] with very little and minor things
[1:29:42] the other day i was just thinking to
[1:29:43] myself i had one one stubborn boss
[1:29:47] and i used to argue with him
[1:29:50] and sometimes i would tell him very hard
[1:29:52] things
[1:29:54] and i will see his eyes tears in his
[1:29:56] eyes
[1:29:59] and one day i told him i said i don't
[1:30:01] want to mention his name i told him i
[1:30:04] said in fact there is something you do
[1:30:06] very well
[1:30:08] i say you take you take feedback and
[1:30:11] criticisms
[1:30:12] on a very good level
[1:30:15] as i don't know if i could do what you
[1:30:16] are doing
[1:30:18] and these are people we call unbelievers
[1:30:24] it's like it's it's almost like it's
[1:30:27] easy
[1:30:30] to even correct an unbeliever
[1:30:33] than it is to correct a believer
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:39] they claim to know it all
[1:30:42] get so proud and pompous
[1:30:44] so you can't tell them what is right or
[1:30:46] wrong
[1:30:48] if he doesn't go their way
[1:30:50] then it's wrong
[1:30:52] but no man is our example
[1:30:55] our example is christ and christ alone
[1:30:59] praise be to god
[1:31:02] the natural man
[1:31:04] has so much belief in their books in the
[1:31:08] knowledge of men and their ability that
[1:31:11] more than the spiritual man believes in
[1:31:14] god
[1:31:15] can you imagine that
[1:31:17] that we are living by the living word of
[1:31:20] god
[1:31:21] the word that created the heavens and
[1:31:24] the earth
[1:31:27] there is so much power in the world and
[1:31:30] that is what we are holding on that is
[1:31:32] what we have believed in and yet
[1:31:35] we are not seeing much of god
[1:31:39] that the natural man who has just
[1:31:41] believed in the wisdom of man
[1:31:44] and in his natural abilities
[1:31:47] is doing exploits and we are sitting
[1:31:49] down
[1:31:52] what explains that
[1:31:55] they believe in their natural abilities
[1:31:58] so much
[1:32:00] till you can't tell them otherwise
[1:32:02] right
[1:32:04] probably 10 years ago i heard a story on
[1:32:06] our cake
[1:32:08] kktis yes
[1:32:10] i think i shared that story one time a
[1:32:12] long time ago
[1:32:13] there was a doctor a medical doctor he
[1:32:15] was a heart surgeon
[1:32:19] who for probably 20 years
[1:32:21] had operated upon patients
[1:32:24] and he never lost one
[1:32:26] and this medical doctor had a friend
[1:32:29] who was a pastor
[1:32:32] and he told his pastor
[1:32:35] to come and see how he performs his
[1:32:38] operation
[1:32:40] and the pastor came
[1:32:41] and they dressed him up in their gowns
[1:32:44] you know whatever and then they entered
[1:32:46] the oppression room
[1:32:48] and then
[1:32:50] the doctor performed the oppression
[1:32:53] and when he was done
[1:32:55] he touched the heart
[1:32:57] of of of the patient
[1:32:59] and according to the story that was
[1:33:01] supposed to kick the heartbeat
[1:33:03] but it never happened
[1:33:07] so now the patient was dead
[1:33:12] so what this has never happened before
[1:33:16] can you imagine
[1:33:17] this is the natural man we are talking
[1:33:20] about this was the point where he had to
[1:33:23] just close it
[1:33:24] but not so
[1:33:26] he believed in himself so much
[1:33:29] and what he could do
[1:33:31] he believed in his book so much and what
[1:33:34] his books taught him
[1:33:36] that he cross-checked
[1:33:38] he checked every box
[1:33:40] he looked at his work he said no i have
[1:33:42] done this over 20 years and it never
[1:33:44] failed this one is not going to fail
[1:33:47] and the story says he went to the ears
[1:33:50] of the dead man and called him by name
[1:33:52] and said tell your heart to beat again
[1:33:55] and right there and then his heart
[1:33:56] started pumping
[1:33:58] he started pumping
[1:34:00] praise be to god
[1:34:03] but where does the spiritual man stand
[1:34:06] maybe you are going to throw your hands
[1:34:08] in the air oh he is dead i have killed
[1:34:10] him
[1:34:11] can you imagine that
[1:34:19] praise be to god
[1:34:22] the natural man
[1:34:24] brother branham said
[1:34:26] has achieved
[1:34:28] a lot more
[1:34:30] with his natural wisdom that the
[1:34:32] spiritual man has achieved
[1:34:35] and the natural man
[1:34:37] as sadly as it is has more confidence
[1:34:41] and faith
[1:34:42] in their natural abilities
[1:34:45] then the spiritual man has faith in his
[1:34:47] god
[1:34:48] it is sad
[1:34:50] very shameful and very disgraceful but
[1:34:53] that is the truth what a paradox
[1:34:58] what a paradox you know
[1:35:01] because when you look at the book of
[1:35:03] revelations which we just read and we
[1:35:05] just played the tape everything just
[1:35:07] dovetailed
[1:35:10] that the church the ladies and church
[1:35:12] age
[1:35:13] is talking about how they have advanced
[1:35:17] they have everything
[1:35:19] they have increased in goods
[1:35:21] we are rich
[1:35:23] we don't have need of anything
[1:35:25] and when you actually look at it yes
[1:35:32] but
[1:35:34] in that advancement
[1:35:37] the church has retrogressed
[1:35:43] in that advancement
[1:35:45] the church has retrogressed
[1:35:47] you see how
[1:35:49] now
[1:35:51] according to the guinness
[1:35:53] world record
[1:35:56] from 1995
[1:35:59] the bible
[1:36:02] is the number one
[1:36:04] best selling book of all time
[1:36:07] right
[1:36:09] from 1995
[1:36:12] the bible is the number one selling book
[1:36:15] of all time
[1:36:18] and it goes on to say that 5
[1:36:21] billion books
[1:36:23] five billion bibles have been sold out
[1:36:27] five billion with a b
[1:36:30] not m
[1:36:32] so when you look at the world's
[1:36:33] population which is in excess of seven
[1:36:36] billion it tells you that there is a
[1:36:39] bible
[1:36:40] almost in every home
[1:36:44] that means the muslims are even keeping
[1:36:45] bibles
[1:36:49] they don't read it the way we read it no
[1:36:52] they read it so they can come and argue
[1:36:55] i know that for a fact
[1:36:59] they don't read for any good intention
[1:37:01] that means there is a bible in almost
[1:37:05] every single room
[1:37:09] five billion bibles
[1:37:13] if you wanted an age
[1:37:16] why we had more preachers
[1:37:21] it is this day an age we are living
[1:37:26] if you wanted an age where there were
[1:37:29] most churches
[1:37:31] in fact there are places in the world
[1:37:34] you will go almost every 100 meter
[1:37:37] you'll find a church
[1:37:39] if you got 100 meters and you don't see
[1:37:41] one in front of you look on the left or
[1:37:42] the right you'll find one
[1:37:45] that is how the churches are
[1:37:48] one time
[1:37:49] somebody came to ghana and they were
[1:37:51] traveling from the south all the way to
[1:37:53] the north and for some reason they said
[1:37:56] let's count the churches that are along
[1:37:57] the road
[1:37:58] and they counted over 1200 churches
[1:38:06] churches everywhere
[1:38:09] preachers everywhere
[1:38:11] bibles everywhere
[1:38:15] when you go on the social network on the
[1:38:17] internet
[1:38:21] there are places where they talk about
[1:38:22] nothing but god
[1:38:25] but
[1:38:26] the most
[1:38:27] sinful
[1:38:30] the most adulterous age
[1:38:35] the age that has departed the most
[1:38:39] from the principles of god
[1:38:42] is this age
[1:38:43] how do you reconcile that
[1:38:47] that christianity yes has come of age
[1:38:51] for the bible to be the number one
[1:38:53] selling book of all time for probably 20
[1:38:55] something years now that tells you how
[1:38:58] far christianity has come
[1:39:00] the number of preachers and the
[1:39:01] missionaries out there
[1:39:04] talking about christ here and there
[1:39:06] tells you how far christianity has come
[1:39:10] but guess what
[1:39:12] we have moved forward
[1:39:14] in retrogression
[1:39:17] we have come this far
[1:39:19] and yet we have nothing to show for it
[1:39:24] we have come this far and yet we have
[1:39:26] not covered any grounds
[1:39:29] it's one thing moving forward
[1:39:31] and it's selective moving forward in
[1:39:33] retrogression
[1:39:35] when you are moving forward you are
[1:39:36] covering grounds
[1:39:38] when you are moving forward in
[1:39:40] progression you are losing grounds
[1:39:44] you say how do you move forward and lose
[1:39:46] grounds yes
[1:39:48] you can move forward in the perfect will
[1:39:50] of god
[1:39:51] and you are gaining grounds
[1:39:53] and you can move forward in the
[1:39:55] permissive will of god and you are
[1:39:57] losing grace even though you are moving
[1:39:58] forward
[1:40:03] don't take things for granted
[1:40:10] don't take things for granted you can
[1:40:13] move forward and still lose grounds
[1:40:16] moses prayed and told god
[1:40:20] if there was anybody that knew what it
[1:40:22] meant to go forward it was moses
[1:40:25] this was a man
[1:40:26] that went to egypt and delivered the
[1:40:28] children of god
[1:40:30] came out
[1:40:31] he had to trust on god to move forward
[1:40:35] had to trust on god to move forward he
[1:40:37] got to a place and he told god if your
[1:40:40] presence does not go with us do not let
[1:40:43] us go forward from hence
[1:40:46] if the presence of god is going with you
[1:40:49] you know
[1:40:50] that you are gaining grounds
[1:40:54] if you're the presence of god does not
[1:40:56] go with you even though you are going to
[1:40:58] go you know that you have lost grounds
[1:41:02] praise be to god
[1:41:06] i want us to read
[1:41:13] if you can just stand your bibles first
[1:41:15] corinthians 10
[1:41:20] first corinthians 10
[1:41:34] ten one
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:38] moreover brethren
[1:41:46] i moreover brethren
[1:41:48] i would not that you should be ignorant
[1:41:53] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:41:55] cloud
[1:41:57] and all passed
[1:41:59] through the sea
[1:42:02] and were all baptized onto moses in the
[1:42:05] cloud and in the sea
[1:42:08] and did all eat
[1:42:09] the same spiritual food
[1:42:12] and did our drink the same spiritual
[1:42:15] drink
[1:42:16] for the drunk
[1:42:18] of that spiritual rock that followed
[1:42:20] them
[1:42:22] and the rock
[1:42:24] was christ
[1:42:26] but with many of them
[1:42:28] god was not well placed
[1:42:31] for they were over true in the
[1:42:33] wilderness
[1:42:35] can you imagine
[1:42:38] they were already overthrown
[1:42:41] in the wilderness
[1:42:44] let's read on now these things
[1:42:47] were our examples
[1:42:49] to the extent we should not
[1:42:53] last
[1:42:54] after evil things as they did lasted
[1:42:58] neither be idolaters as well some of
[1:43:01] them
[1:43:02] as it is written
[1:43:04] the people sat down to eat and drink and
[1:43:07] rose up to play
[1:43:09] neither let us commit fornication as
[1:43:11] some of them committed and fell in one
[1:43:14] day three and twenty
[1:43:17] thousand
[1:43:18] neither let us stand christ
[1:43:20] as some of them also tempted and were
[1:43:23] destroyed
[1:43:24] of serpents
[1:43:26] neither mama yi
[1:43:27] as some of them also mummy and were
[1:43:30] destroyed
[1:43:32] of the destroyer
[1:43:34] now
[1:43:35] all these
[1:43:37] happened
[1:43:38] unto them
[1:43:40] for examples
[1:43:43] and they are written
[1:43:45] for our admonition
[1:43:47] upon whom
[1:43:49] the ends of the world
[1:43:53] are come
[1:43:54] praise be to god
[1:43:56] wherefore let him that think of his
[1:43:59] standard take heed
[1:44:01] lest
[1:44:02] he fall
[1:44:05] if you think you are standing
[1:44:07] take heed
[1:44:09] do not take things for granted the bible
[1:44:12] says
[1:44:13] let him that think of his standard take
[1:44:16] heed lest he falls
[1:44:22] they saw the glory of the lord
[1:44:25] and how god delivered them from the
[1:44:27] hands of pharaoh
[1:44:30] they saw the glory of the lord when they
[1:44:32] came before the red sea
[1:44:34] and pharaoh and his army was coming
[1:44:36] after them and how the rest departed and
[1:44:39] they went through they saw the glory of
[1:44:41] the lord
[1:44:42] they saw the glory of the lord
[1:44:45] when they drank from the rock that
[1:44:46] followed them when they heard from the
[1:44:48] maratha fell
[1:44:50] that threw their journey in the
[1:44:51] wilderness
[1:44:53] nobody
[1:44:54] ever complained
[1:44:58] they saw the hand of god in their lives
[1:45:00] god was blessing them
[1:45:02] and yet
[1:45:04] god was not happy
[1:45:07] with most of them
[1:45:09] and with most of them
[1:45:11] actually god had overthrown them already
[1:45:14] in the wilderness
[1:45:17] and i read this
[1:45:20] and in fact
[1:45:21] it tells you
[1:45:23] that it is nothing but grace
[1:45:26] nothing but grace
[1:45:32] a people
[1:45:34] that had tasted of god
[1:45:36] that was seeing the miracles the signs
[1:45:39] the wonders
[1:45:40] happening in their lives
[1:45:42] what more what more is there to tell you
[1:45:46] that god is with you
[1:45:48] and yet
[1:45:50] the bible says
[1:45:52] god was not pleased with them
[1:45:54] they were already overthrown
[1:45:58] they had come very far
[1:46:01] they had moved forward
[1:46:04] all the way from egypt in the wilderness
[1:46:06] moving forward you were saying oh they
[1:46:08] were going in circles in the wilderness
[1:46:10] yes a genitals was meant to be in three
[1:46:13] days they took it 40 years
[1:46:15] they were going in circles yes but every
[1:46:18] single step they took
[1:46:20] brought them closer to the promised land
[1:46:25] they moved forward
[1:46:28] but they moved forward
[1:46:29] in retrogression
[1:46:33] it didn't mean anything to god
[1:46:37] this is how we ought to be very careful
[1:46:40] we ought to be very careful
[1:46:44] we want to see the blessings of god in
[1:46:46] our lives
[1:46:48] we want to see the hand of god in our
[1:46:49] lives
[1:46:51] we want that assurance that god is with
[1:46:53] us
[1:46:54] we want to see his hand of deliverance
[1:46:57] when we step out there we want to know
[1:46:59] that god is with us
[1:47:02] but
[1:47:03] it could also be very dangerous
[1:47:06] this is where you have to check your
[1:47:08] salvation
[1:47:11] work out your salvation with fear
[1:47:14] do not take things for granted
[1:47:21] it's good to see those things in your
[1:47:22] life
[1:47:24] but it is not a sign
[1:47:27] that god is with you
[1:47:30] you know yourself more than everybody
[1:47:32] knows you
[1:47:34] and of course there is somebody that
[1:47:35] knows you more than you know yourself
[1:47:38] set your heart
[1:47:43] sometimes we can be so stubborn
[1:47:48] that things that we have to take care of
[1:47:52] will ignore them
[1:47:54] and we want to go forward anyhow
[1:47:57] and you know that you are going forward
[1:47:59] but you are not making any success
[1:48:03] remember
[1:48:05] where the heart falling
[1:48:08] if there is something
[1:48:10] to take care of
[1:48:12] take care of it while you are going
[1:48:19] don't move forward
[1:48:23] bearing grudge
[1:48:25] don't move forward
[1:48:27] harboring unforgiving spirits
[1:48:30] don't move forward with pride
[1:48:35] a lot of the times we have a way of
[1:48:37] categorizing things and we tell you what
[1:48:39] is more dangerous and what is not more
[1:48:41] dangerous
[1:48:43] what brought lucifer down
[1:48:45] it was pride
[1:48:47] when he sat down and said i'm going to
[1:48:49] raise my throne above the throne of god
[1:48:51] what else and be worshipped instead of
[1:48:54] god what does that that is pride
[1:48:58] that is pride
[1:49:01] and don't joke with that demon of pride
[1:49:04] because the bible says that pride goes
[1:49:06] before a fall
[1:49:11] if there is anything to place under the
[1:49:13] blood place it under the blood
[1:49:16] if there is anything to confess confess
[1:49:18] it
[1:49:19] if there is anything to make right make
[1:49:22] it right
[1:49:23] do not wait
[1:49:25] and the question is what are you waiting
[1:49:27] on
[1:49:30] what are you waiting on
[1:49:32] tomorrow may never come
[1:49:36] just live the life
[1:49:39] live the life
[1:49:44] and when you are living the life
[1:49:47] you don't care what happens
[1:49:50] you don't care if you go to bed tonight
[1:49:52] and you don't rise up you don't
[1:49:54] care
[1:49:56] because we have a promise
[1:49:58] that day that our life and remain will
[1:50:01] not hinder them that are asleep
[1:50:03] we have a promise
[1:50:06] if there is anything to worry about
[1:50:10] is living by the world
[1:50:14] praise be to god
[1:50:17] moving forward in retrogression
[1:50:20] this was meant to be a little teaching
[1:50:24] praise be to god
[1:50:26] and it looks like i have a lot of time
[1:50:32] yes
[1:50:33] so
[1:50:36] the world does not care
[1:50:39] you ask yourself
[1:50:41] and you say oh there are more churches
[1:50:43] today
[1:50:45] there are a lot of preachers outside
[1:50:46] there
[1:50:47] there are a lot of bibles being sold
[1:50:49] that means people are getting interested
[1:50:52] but why are we not seeing the results
[1:50:56] why are we not seeing the results
[1:51:01] a serious disconnect
[1:51:06] that means people are just being what
[1:51:09] religious
[1:51:11] and it doesn't take religion to please
[1:51:14] god
[1:51:16] it does not take religion to please god
[1:51:21] that religious spirit would kill you
[1:51:28] a lot of the times when we talk about
[1:51:30] cain
[1:51:32] we have all the negative and the
[1:51:33] batteries to talk about him
[1:51:36] but brother brown said that cain was
[1:51:38] religious
[1:51:41] he was
[1:51:43] you say oh i believe in god can't
[1:51:45] believed in god
[1:51:48] oh i worship god can worship god
[1:51:52] i make sacrifices to god yes cain made
[1:51:55] sacrifice to god
[1:51:57] and sometimes they'll tell you he
[1:51:58] brought rotten apples and fruits from
[1:52:00] his god no he brought the best of his
[1:52:03] field
[1:52:04] the only difference there was
[1:52:07] between cain and abel
[1:52:09] that cain
[1:52:11] did not have revelation
[1:52:13] into the things of god jesus told his
[1:52:16] disciples
[1:52:18] upon this rock
[1:52:20] the rock of revelation i will build my
[1:52:22] church and the gates of hell will not
[1:52:24] prevail against it
[1:52:27] the letter killeth
[1:52:29] the spirit give us life
[1:52:32] you can take the letter and run with it
[1:52:40] and you can also take the spirit get
[1:52:41] into the spirit of god
[1:52:45] for they that worship god must worship
[1:52:47] him in spirit and in truth
[1:52:56] there is life in the world
[1:52:59] but when you take the letter
[1:53:02] you are just
[1:53:04] doing a religious duty
[1:53:07] a religious duty
[1:53:11] it does not take religion
[1:53:13] to save god
[1:53:16] just come to church
[1:53:18] pay your dues
[1:53:20] move from church and then you go back
[1:53:22] into the world that is bringing us right
[1:53:26] to revelation 3 14.
[1:53:32] the bible says
[1:53:34] i would that that white cold no heart
[1:53:39] if you want to enjoy the world just
[1:53:41] enjoy the world and forget of god
[1:53:45] just be cold
[1:53:48] and if you want to serve god serve god
[1:53:51] and forget of the world
[1:53:53] but the spirit of the age
[1:53:56] is something we all have to watch out
[1:53:57] for
[1:53:59] that are people we have become so
[1:54:01] stubborn
[1:54:02] that we refuse it we will serve god
[1:54:05] anyhow and we will do the test of the
[1:54:07] world anyhow
[1:54:08] and that puts us in the middle
[1:54:11] where we become what we look warm
[1:54:14] we are not cold and we are not hot
[1:54:18] why because we have mixed the things of
[1:54:21] god with the traditions of men
[1:54:23] we have missed the things of god
[1:54:25] with the world
[1:54:27] fills them together
[1:54:28] and we want god to accept it anyhow
[1:54:32] and the bible says because thou art
[1:54:35] lukewarm i will spew you out of my mouth
[1:54:43] praise be to god
[1:54:49] they have a form of godliness
[1:54:52] but they deny the power thereof
[1:54:56] yes
[1:54:57] so the church has let god down
[1:55:02] the church
[1:55:04] has let god down
[1:55:06] and even though there are a lot of
[1:55:08] people out there
[1:55:11] that are dying
[1:55:13] and looking for the truth
[1:55:16] they don't find it necessary going to
[1:55:17] church
[1:55:20] because they don't see anything good
[1:55:23] when they look out there
[1:55:27] when they look at the churches
[1:55:29] all they see is an extension
[1:55:33] of the world
[1:55:38] that is all they see
[1:55:40] and that is how much you have let go
[1:55:42] down
[1:55:48] and god have mercy
[1:55:51] that you look at yourself
[1:55:53] and you call yourself a christian
[1:55:56] and somebody in the world looks at you
[1:56:03] and do not see what you are seeing
[1:56:08] they see you as belonging to them
[1:56:10] they see you as part and parcel of them
[1:56:12] when you are seeing yourself as a
[1:56:14] christian god have mercy
[1:56:22] because a christian your life is not a
[1:56:25] hidden book
[1:56:28] is something that is in the plane for
[1:56:29] people to see
[1:56:33] after all the bible says
[1:56:35] we are living epistles
[1:56:39] as you feed on the word of god you
[1:56:42] become the word
[1:56:46] people look at you and they see the word
[1:56:49] in you
[1:56:50] people look at you and they see christ
[1:56:52] in you
[1:56:55] and they can look at you and tell that
[1:56:56] no you are different there is something
[1:56:58] special about you
[1:57:01] and sometimes they are not ashamed to
[1:57:02] come and ask
[1:57:04] praise be to god
[1:57:08] but if the world looks at you
[1:57:10] and they are not seeing christ
[1:57:12] and they see you as one of them
[1:57:15] lord have mercy
[1:57:19] because what are we supposed to be doing
[1:57:21] we are supposed to be reflecting what
[1:57:23] christ
[1:57:25] and we shall reflect christ
[1:57:28] every day of our lives
[1:57:30] praise be to god
[1:57:32] we should demonstrate christ
[1:57:35] we shall preach christ
[1:57:37] we must leave christ
[1:57:39] we must be a true reflection
[1:57:43] of him
[1:57:45] amen praise be to god
[1:57:49] brother branham talks about the sun and
[1:57:51] the moon
[1:57:52] and he ties them
[1:57:54] to christ and the church
[1:57:57] now naturally
[1:57:59] naturally
[1:58:03] the moon takes its energy from the sun
[1:58:08] and when the sun is slow more or when
[1:58:09] the sun goes down then the moon comes up
[1:58:12] to shine its light
[1:58:14] the light that the moon is shining is
[1:58:17] not the moon's light
[1:58:18] the moon does not have light by the
[1:58:20] light of the sun
[1:58:23] so they have a direct relationship
[1:58:27] so without the sun the moon is useless
[1:58:33] and when you bring you to christ and the
[1:58:34] church
[1:58:35] without christ
[1:58:37] the church is useless
[1:58:42] when you read verse 3 20
[1:58:45] revelation 3 20
[1:58:47] it tells you how christ is outside of
[1:58:49] the church
[1:58:50] knocking begging and pleading to come in
[1:58:54] so if christ has no place in his own
[1:58:58] church
[1:58:59] what has that become
[1:59:01] and we boost of how far we have come we
[1:59:04] boost of how many bibles we have sold we
[1:59:07] boast of how many churches we have built
[1:59:10] we boast of how much we have preached we
[1:59:12] both have all those things and christ is
[1:59:14] not in it we have failed
[1:59:18] we have failed christ
[1:59:25] praise be to god
[1:59:27] it shows
[1:59:28] how much we have let god down
[1:59:33] we are supposed to be reflecting
[1:59:36] the beauty of christ in our lives
[1:59:40] now people out there can look at us
[1:59:43] and see christ in our midst
[1:59:47] and we are not reflecting any light by
[1:59:50] the light of christ
[1:59:53] we ought to have a direct relationship
[1:59:56] with him
[1:59:58] and as i was looking at this
[2:00:00] something has jumped in
[2:00:02] and it's a natural phenomenon
[2:00:05] which we all know about and that is the
[2:00:07] eclipse
[2:00:10] i remember when i first thought of it or
[2:00:12] when it first struck me
[2:00:14] because i know that the moon
[2:00:18] is the top of the church
[2:00:20] so i say egglest of the moon oh i say i
[2:00:22] got this
[2:00:23] eclipse of the sun i say no the sun
[2:00:25] types christ i don't want to deal with
[2:00:26] this
[2:00:28] i can't so i left it
[2:00:31] the following day guess what i sat
[2:00:33] behind my computer again and here it
[2:00:35] comes again
[2:00:36] but it is time with grace
[2:00:39] praise be to god
[2:00:42] now
[2:00:43] the bible says let your light soul shine
[2:00:46] before men that they may see your good
[2:00:48] works and give the glory to your father
[2:00:50] which is in heaven
[2:00:52] because they know that man is an entity
[2:00:55] of darkness
[2:00:57] if there is any light in you it must be
[2:00:59] the light of god
[2:01:00] so when they see oh this guy he used to
[2:01:03] be like that
[2:01:04] but no he has changed oh praise be to
[2:01:07] god the glory is given to god
[2:01:10] but look at what is going to happen here
[2:01:13] we have two types of eclipse
[2:01:16] that's the lunar eclipse which is the
[2:01:18] atlas of the moon
[2:01:19] and the solar eclipse which is the
[2:01:21] eclipse of the sun
[2:01:23] and remember
[2:01:25] we are talking about the church and
[2:01:27] christ
[2:01:29] now in the eclipse of the moon
[2:01:34] the eclipse of the moon happens
[2:01:37] when the earth
[2:01:38] comes between
[2:01:40] the sun
[2:01:43] and the earth
[2:01:45] sorry
[2:01:47] the edges of the moon happens
[2:01:49] when
[2:01:50] the
[2:01:51] the earth comes between the moon
[2:01:55] and the sun
[2:01:56] then there is an eclipse of the moon
[2:02:02] and
[2:02:03] an eggless of the moon can be a total
[2:02:06] eclipse
[2:02:07] or a partial eclipse
[2:02:10] but remember as the bible says he that
[2:02:13] offends in one is guilty of all
[2:02:16] there is no small sin and there is no
[2:02:17] big sin sin is sin
[2:02:22] whether a partial or total eclipse an
[2:02:24] eclipse is an eclipse
[2:02:28] so in the eclipse of the moon you have
[2:02:30] the earth coming between the moon and
[2:02:33] the sun and christ is the sun the moon
[2:02:36] is the church so what happens here we
[2:02:39] allow our earth
[2:02:41] our earth
[2:02:43] this earth here
[2:02:44] we allow our earth to come between us
[2:02:48] and christ
[2:02:54] and when the earth when your earth
[2:02:57] comes between christ and the church
[2:03:00] you don't see
[2:03:04] the power of god
[2:03:07] because self
[2:03:09] is now on display
[2:03:14] it's not to say that the light is not
[2:03:16] shining the light is still shining
[2:03:19] he is the same yesterday and to do today
[2:03:20] forever he changed off note
[2:03:23] he is so shining his grace is he shining
[2:03:26] his love he is sustaining his
[2:03:28] deliverance praise be to god
[2:03:30] but now
[2:03:32] you have allowed your earth
[2:03:35] your pride your arrogance your sin your
[2:03:38] iniquity your worldliness your whatever
[2:03:41] to come between you
[2:03:43] and the world
[2:03:46] and because of that you don't see your
[2:03:48] potential because there is no connection
[2:03:51] now
[2:03:56] praise be to god amen
[2:03:59] now we can talk about the athletes of
[2:04:01] the sun
[2:04:03] remember
[2:04:04] that the sun never changes his position
[2:04:08] he stays where he is he is the same
[2:04:10] yesterday today and forever
[2:04:12] since shines is light
[2:04:15] grace
[2:04:16] love mercy protection what a view
[2:04:21] but in the earliest of the sun
[2:04:24] this time it is the moon that is coming
[2:04:27] between the earth
[2:04:30] and the sun
[2:04:32] and the moon
[2:04:34] is the church
[2:04:36] so now the church has come between
[2:04:41] god
[2:04:43] and humanity
[2:04:50] the church has become a stumbling block
[2:04:54] we are not talking of unbelievers
[2:04:57] we are talking about the church of the
[2:04:58] living god the church has become a
[2:05:01] stumbling block
[2:05:03] to the people out there that are looking
[2:05:05] for salvation
[2:05:06] to the people that are dying
[2:05:08] that are seeking god
[2:05:10] the church has become a stumbling block
[2:05:12] now they look at the church
[2:05:15] and they don't see god
[2:05:16] they don't see anything special
[2:05:20] they look at the church and it's like
[2:05:22] you know any other place
[2:05:25] organization
[2:05:26] the church
[2:05:28] has become a stumbling block
[2:05:32] the church
[2:05:34] which god is hoping for
[2:05:37] to lighten
[2:05:39] the world
[2:05:42] is now
[2:05:43] in the way
[2:05:45] so much in the way
[2:05:49] that the people out there that are dying
[2:05:50] and seeking god
[2:05:52] don't see god anymore
[2:05:58] praise be to god
[2:06:02] so you realize that a lot of the times
[2:06:05] we get to a place and we are suffering
[2:06:07] from eclipses
[2:06:10] you have become a stumbling block
[2:06:13] when you are supposed to be shining the
[2:06:14] light you have become a stumbling block
[2:06:17] when you are supposed to reflect the
[2:06:19] beauty of christ you have become a
[2:06:20] stumbling block
[2:06:22] when people should look at you and see
[2:06:24] god in you they look at you and they see
[2:06:26] an extension of themselves
[2:06:28] what are you preaching what are you
[2:06:30] telling the people around you
[2:06:33] you don't come to church to be a
[2:06:35] christian
[2:06:38] you are supposed to shine the light out
[2:06:40] there
[2:06:42] in the midst of darkness
[2:06:46] god is stressing on you to shine the
[2:06:48] light
[2:06:50] so people would see you
[2:06:55] and you'll be a source of motivation
[2:06:57] or hope to them
[2:07:02] moving forward
[2:07:04] in retrogression
[2:07:07] moving forward in retrogression
[2:07:11] i have not come to preach you a good
[2:07:12] sermon
[2:07:13] i have just come to tell you what god
[2:07:15] has laid on my heart
[2:07:17] it may not be for everybody
[2:07:20] but if this message is meant to go for
[2:07:22] the one person that god is looking for
[2:07:25] praise be to god
[2:07:31] moving forward
[2:07:33] in retrogression
[2:07:34] how we ought to examine every step we
[2:07:37] take
[2:07:38] how we ought to check our lives by the
[2:07:42] word of god
[2:07:43] how we ought to be sober
[2:07:48] to seek the face of god
[2:07:51] concerning every move we make
[2:07:55] how we ought to serve god in spirit and
[2:07:58] in truth
[2:08:00] how we ought to be honest how we ought
[2:08:02] to be sincere
[2:08:06] remember that you can never surprise god
[2:08:10] god knows what you would do before he
[2:08:12] chose you
[2:08:15] so how are you going to surprise him
[2:08:17] he already knows what you are going to
[2:08:19] do before you did it yet he still chose
[2:08:21] you
[2:08:25] and you go to god and you have something
[2:08:27] to make right don't sleep
[2:08:30] you go to god and you have something to
[2:08:32] make right
[2:08:33] speak to god
[2:08:36] speak to god
[2:08:40] confess it
[2:08:43] remember he knows you more than you know
[2:08:45] yourself don't sugarcoat it
[2:08:51] if you have to come before the church
[2:08:53] come
[2:08:54] they will tell you oh you look stupid
[2:08:56] yes it's better to look stupid here than
[2:08:58] to look stupid over there
[2:09:02] i better be stupid and put on my wedding
[2:09:04] garment and get ready to live here than
[2:09:07] to act like i'm a wise man and only end
[2:09:09] up in hell fire
[2:09:14] moving forward
[2:09:16] in retrogression
[2:09:19] check your life
[2:09:22] check your life
[2:09:24] over and over again
[2:09:26] there is no complacency
[2:09:29] in our work with god
[2:09:31] examine yourself
[2:09:35] don't just be a follower
[2:09:39] don't just follow the crowd
[2:09:43] that because people are going so i am
[2:09:45] also going
[2:09:49] get to know christ
[2:09:51] and have a personal relationship with
[2:09:52] him
[2:09:55] don't just be a crowd follower
[2:10:00] mean business with god
[2:10:03] let your faith be in god and not amen
[2:10:06] amen
[2:10:08] and always look up to him
[2:10:11] for it is homegoing
[2:10:15] you look around it tells you that it is
[2:10:17] homegoing time
[2:10:20] so much so
[2:10:22] that even the unbelievers know that it
[2:10:24] is ongoing time
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:31] it's just a matter of time
[2:10:34] and who knows
[2:10:35] it could be this night
[2:10:40] it could be this night
[2:10:48] your service is to god
[2:10:51] and not to a man
[2:10:55] and my my my encouragement to you this
[2:10:58] morning
[2:11:00] do not let any man
[2:11:03] for that matter any woman
[2:11:05] come between you and your god
[2:11:17] seek god
[2:11:20] seek god while he can be found
[2:11:24] make good use of the grace of god
[2:11:27] while the grace of god still abounds
[2:11:31] if there is any age
[2:11:33] where grace abounds is this age
[2:11:38] because the bible says where sin abounds
[2:11:40] grace abounds and even more
[2:11:43] embraces there is more of grace to know
[2:11:47] a lot of the times we try to talk about
[2:11:49] the grace and we don't even scratch the
[2:11:51] surface of it
[2:11:52] because it's so deep and white
[2:11:57] who can understand what god is doing
[2:12:01] sometimes we we we try to behave like we
[2:12:04] understand what you can't understand god
[2:12:06] because the bible says his words are
[2:12:08] past finding out
[2:12:15] every day of your life
[2:12:19] every day of your life
[2:12:22] make sure that you are walking in the
[2:12:25] perfect ways of god
[2:12:27] yes we are humans
[2:12:30] we have good days we have bad
[2:12:32] days but that does not change
[2:12:35] god
[2:12:38] when you have a good day he's god
[2:12:40] when it's a bad day he remains god
[2:12:43] when you're on the mountaintop he's god
[2:12:45] when you're in the valley below he is
[2:12:46] god when you are in good health he is
[2:12:48] god when you are sick he is god nothing
[2:12:51] changes god
[2:12:57] hold on
[2:12:59] keep holding on to that word
[2:13:02] do not let the enemy snatch it
[2:13:05] as a matter of fact the enemy cannot
[2:13:07] take the word away from you
[2:13:09] all he can do
[2:13:12] is get you to a place
[2:13:14] where
[2:13:15] you relinquish your authority
[2:13:17] and then now he begins to deal with you
[2:13:21] the devil can never take the word
[2:13:23] he can't handle the word of god
[2:13:29] praise be to god
[2:13:31] all he will do is try to discourage you
[2:13:37] make you feel low have low esteem
[2:13:40] of yourself
[2:13:42] forgetting the power and authority you
[2:13:44] are wielding
[2:13:45] as a son or daughter of god
[2:13:48] and you look so dejected
[2:13:51] and how nobody loves you and how
[2:13:53] everybody hates you
[2:13:55] and you forget
[2:13:57] that you are a son you forget that you
[2:14:00] are a daughter of the most high god
[2:14:04] praise be to god amen
[2:14:09] living
[2:14:10] moving forward
[2:14:13] in retrogression
[2:14:16] i pray that should not be our story
[2:14:20] that should not be our story
[2:14:26] when we take a step forward
[2:14:28] we'll be gaining grounds
[2:14:30] now we'll not take a step forward and be
[2:14:33] losing grounds
[2:14:36] that you take one step forward two steps
[2:14:38] back know that we are going to maintain
[2:14:40] our focus
[2:14:42] praise be to god
[2:14:45] keep your focus
[2:14:47] there are a lot of side attractions
[2:14:50] and that is just to carry you back to
[2:14:52] the world
[2:14:54] keep your focus
[2:14:57] do not take your attention from god
[2:15:00] let your attention be on your pro on the
[2:15:02] promise
[2:15:03] like elisha
[2:15:05] looking unto elijah and would not even
[2:15:08] turn to the left or right
[2:15:09] i would not take no for an answer
[2:15:12] keep your focus on god amen
[2:15:16] tomorrow may never come
[2:15:18] the devil will tell you oh tomorrow has
[2:15:20] always come
[2:15:23] and so tomorrow is going to come yes it
[2:15:26] may come
[2:15:27] but tomorrow may never come
[2:15:31] and if god gives you grace an
[2:15:33] opportunity to do something right today
[2:15:36] don't postpone it till tomorrow
[2:15:39] because tomorrow comes and you are
[2:15:41] unable to do it
[2:15:48] with many of them in the wilderness
[2:15:51] even though they enjoyed of god they
[2:15:53] tasted of god
[2:15:55] god blessed them in their journey yet
[2:15:57] they were overthrown already and god was
[2:16:00] not happy with them
[2:16:01] and we saw how they all died at kadesh
[2:16:04] bania and they didn't have to go over to
[2:16:06] the promised land we saw all that
[2:16:12] if there was any time to mean business
[2:16:13] with god is today
[2:16:18] do not push it
[2:16:20] till tomorrow it is today
[2:16:24] if you push it to tomorrow tomorrow
[2:16:27] comes and yet you are not able to do it
[2:16:35] the musicians can come over
[2:16:37] praise be to god
[2:16:40] remember
[2:16:43] that we are here
[2:16:47] to serve god and not man
[2:16:51] it doesn't matter what someone else
[2:16:54] thinks of you
[2:16:56] it doesn't matter
[2:16:58] whatever they want to take off you let
[2:16:59] them take it
[2:17:01] but you make sure that your relationship
[2:17:03] with god is certain
[2:17:08] because man would not give you a chance
[2:17:11] as a matter of fact if our salvation
[2:17:14] depended on men
[2:17:16] i don't care who they are if they don't
[2:17:18] like you they'll just take your sh
[2:17:21] they'll just take your your what
[2:17:22] your name and shred it put it in the
[2:17:24] trading machine
[2:17:26] and they are done with you
[2:17:29] if they don't think good of you that is
[2:17:30] the end
[2:17:32] if you are not in a good india good
[2:17:34] books that is the end
[2:17:35] [Music]
[2:17:39] so
[2:17:40] man would always have his thoughts
[2:17:43] don't care what a man thinks of you
[2:17:48] you should rather care what god thinks
[2:17:50] of you
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:55] serve god
[2:17:57] live for god
[2:17:59] there is nothing worth more than serving
[2:18:02] god
[2:18:04] praise be to god
[2:18:07] so this
[2:18:08] is a moment i want us to go before the
[2:18:11] lord
[2:18:14] i don't know in what way god may have
[2:18:16] spoken to you
[2:18:17] but i want you to just pray
[2:18:21] pray to god
[2:18:23] you know yourself more than anybody
[2:18:25] knows you
[2:18:27] and if there is anything in your life to
[2:18:29] deal with
[2:18:30] [Music]
[2:18:32] because the bible says his word will not
[2:18:34] go out and come back void
[2:18:36] the papers for which the word of god
[2:18:38] went out today is accomplished
[2:18:41] and any time the word of god comes
[2:18:44] it comes with enough grace
[2:18:47] that if you can just approach the throne
[2:18:49] of god with the same grace
[2:18:51] and talk to god concerning your
[2:18:53] condition
[2:18:54] god would hear from heaven
[2:18:56] there is no doubt whatsoever
[2:19:01] you think god would bring his only
[2:19:03] begotten son
[2:19:05] to suffer what he suffered
[2:19:07] and then turn around and say no i'm
[2:19:09] sending all of you to hell god will not
[2:19:11] do that
[2:19:13] he is such a gracious and loving god
[2:19:17] praise be to god
[2:19:19] god would not rush in his spirit
[2:19:22] the prophet said he is more willing to
[2:19:24] give us his holy spirit and we are
[2:19:25] willing to receive him
[2:19:28] it's a moment
[2:19:30] to make sure your life
[2:19:32] your work with christ it's right
[2:19:34] it's on the right pedestal
[2:19:38] praise be to god
[2:19:40] our lord and our savior jesus we thank
[2:19:43] this so much oh god for this moment that
[2:19:45] we have had to come before you
[2:19:47] and father we are so very much grateful
[2:19:49] oh god
[2:19:51] for having spoken to us
[2:19:54] father
[2:19:56] your word has come to us
[2:19:58] and as you have made us a promise
[2:20:01] that your world would not go out and
[2:20:02] return unto the void
[2:20:04] we believe without any shadow of doubt
[2:20:07] that the purpose of which your word went
[2:20:09] out further is accomplished this morning
[2:20:11] in our midst
[2:20:12] and all we are asking for is grace
[2:20:16] we would never justify what is wrong
[2:20:19] we will never justify our weaknesses and
[2:20:21] our slaughterfulness
[2:20:23] we know as your word says lord we indeed
[2:20:26] have let you down
[2:20:28] that church has let you down
[2:20:30] but there is enough grace
[2:20:33] if you can only turn unto thee oh god
[2:20:35] with a willing heart
[2:20:37] to receive you into our hearts
[2:20:40] we pray father for mercy
[2:20:43] we pray have mercy upon our souls
[2:20:46] father forgive us lord jesus forgive us
[2:20:48] of all our shortcomings forgive us of
[2:20:50] all our sins forgive us for our
[2:20:52] iniquities and of all our transgressions
[2:20:55] and of every evil
[2:20:57] there is in our lives
[2:21:00] have mercy lord
[2:21:02] we pray in the name of jesus have mercy
[2:21:05] and help us to live the life
[2:21:07] that will be a true reflection
[2:21:10] a true reflection of you
[2:21:14] that you look down and see as father oh
[2:21:16] god walking in your footprints
[2:21:19] that man may see our good ways and give
[2:21:21] the glory to you
[2:21:23] that the word will look at us for
[2:21:26] father for hope
[2:21:29] bless us lord jesus
[2:21:31] bless us
[2:21:33] bless us lord
[2:21:35] we pray anoint our souls tonight anoint
[2:21:39] our souls this afternoon put your holy
[2:21:41] spirit and fire
[2:21:43] and take complete control over our lives
[2:21:47] that we shall live to please thee
[2:21:48] another man
[2:21:50] that we shall need to serve your cause
[2:21:53] and not the cause of a man
[2:21:55] keep us in the pages of your word lord
[2:21:58] and let your goodness and mercies
[2:22:01] follow us all the days of our lives
[2:22:06] when we are going forward we want to
[2:22:08] gain grounds
[2:22:11] do not let us go forward and lose ground
