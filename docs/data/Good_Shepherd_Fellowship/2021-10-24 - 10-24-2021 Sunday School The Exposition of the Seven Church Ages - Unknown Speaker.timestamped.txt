[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] do
[0:19] so
[0:41] fear none of those things which thou
[0:43] shalt suffer
[0:44] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[0:47] into prison that you may be tried and
[0:50] you shall have tribulation ten days
[0:52] be thou faithful unto death
[0:54] and i will give thee a crown of life
[0:57] every time the lord uses those words
[1:00] fear not there is an engagement at hand
[1:02] which will involve great danger and
[1:04] suffering and deprivation
[1:06] now he does not say in a blonde curt
[1:08] manner tribulation is coming that would
[1:11] frighten one
[1:12] but like a mother who is about to turn
[1:14] out the light says gently to her child
[1:16] lest he be frightened
[1:18] now don't be afraid for the light will
[1:20] go out and it will be dark but remember
[1:22] that i am here with you
[1:24] so he says
[1:26] don't be afraid of man or what he can do
[1:28] to you i am with you and my grace is
[1:30] sufficient for you
[1:32] when you pass through the waters they
[1:34] will not overflow you not even in death
[1:36] are you defeated
[1:38] you are more than conquerors
[1:41] the great apostle paul knew from
[1:43] experience the reality of those words
[1:45] and he wrote in romans 8 35-59
[1:49] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:51] christ
[1:52] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:54] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:57] peril or sword
[1:59] as it is written
[2:01] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[2:03] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[2:05] slaughter
[2:06] nay in all these things we are more than
[2:08] conquerors through him that loved us
[2:11] for i am persuaded that neither death
[2:13] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[2:16] nor powers nor things present nor things
[2:19] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[2:23] other creature shall be able to separate
[2:25] us from the love of god
[2:27] which is in christ jesus our lord
[2:30] no we are not to fear
[2:32] his love casts out all fear
[2:35] now notice what he says
[2:37] the devil will cast some of you into
[2:39] prison that you may be tried
[2:41] the jews were doing that right then
[2:43] the pagan priests were doing that right
[2:45] then
[2:46] the governors who tried to curry favor
[2:48] with the public because the people liked
[2:50] the arena hurled the christians by the
[2:52] thousands to their death destroying them
[2:54] by lions and gladiators
[2:57] what has the devil to do with this
[2:59] why blame him
[3:01] ah yes but it is the devil's hatred
[3:03] behind it all
[3:04] he is behind it all for he hates god
[3:07] what god has set his heart on satan is
[3:10] bound to try to destroy
[3:11] but watch
[3:13] here is some illumination
[3:15] if satan is behind the jews who are
[3:17] hailing the christians into court
[3:19] then the jews are not of god's religion
[3:21] but the devils
[3:22] their gathering is also of the synagogue
[3:24] of satan
[3:26] and if the roman catholic church killed
[3:28] the multitudes of believers in the dark
[3:29] ages yes and in all ages
[3:32] then they are of the devil and belong to
[3:34] satan also
[3:36] and if you think this is shocking just
[3:38] wait until the prophecy of revelation 13
[3:41] is fulfilled
[3:42] it is strikingly true that the united
[3:44] states of america is in that chapter
[3:47] the very number 13 is a symbol of this
[3:49] nation
[3:50] it started with 13 colonies its flag has
[3:53] 13 stars and 13 stripes
[3:56] and there is her destiny in the 13th
[3:58] chapter in this image that is mentioned
[4:01] in this chapter will be found all the
[4:03] wickedness of the beast that was before
[4:05] it
[4:05] as the beast rose at the nicene council
[4:08] so the image will come out of the world
[4:10] council of churches with all ungodly and
[4:12] satanic power to vent the anger of the
[4:14] devil upon the true vine of god
[4:17] it will be a repeat performance of all
[4:19] diabolical cunning and cruelty
[4:22] those who fight the humble of god and
[4:24] scoff and destroy
[4:26] let them do it
[4:27] and do it they will
[4:29] and all in the name of god and religion
[4:31] but they lie
[4:33] they are not of god
[4:35] they are of their father the devil
[4:37] they by their deeds against any people
[4:40] expose themselves for what they are
[4:42] let them organize and repudiate the
[4:44] little flock
[4:45] they but further reveal to all that they
[4:47] are of the devil
[4:49] they are the false vine
[4:50] the vine that murders
[4:52] their hatred proves who they are the
[4:55] nicolaitan antichrist church is who they
[4:57] are
[4:59] they shall be cast into prison
[5:01] yes they are hailed into court and
[5:03] falsely accused and tried and imprisoned
[5:06] and of course it is all done in the name
[5:08] of religion and decency and outraged
[5:10] innocency
[5:11] all done for a good cause
[5:13] that makes me think of the supreme
[5:15] court's ruling on prayer and bible
[5:16] reading in the schools who is behind it
[5:19] satan is
[5:21] it is just another angry outburst
[5:22] against god
[5:25] thou shalt have tribulation ten days
[5:28] here is a prophecy
[5:30] and with it is a means of determining
[5:32] the lifespan of the smyrnian age
[5:34] diocletian the cruelest of all emperors
[5:36] launched a terror campaign against the
[5:38] saints of god
[5:40] but except for the mercy of god would
[5:41] have wiped out all believers
[5:44] it was the bloodiest in history and
[5:46] lasted 10 years
[5:47] the 10 days of revelation 2
[5:50] 10 be
[5:51] from 302 to 312
[5:54] be thou faithful unto death
[5:57] he does not say be faithful until death
[6:00] but unto death
[6:01] you may have to seal your testimony with
[6:03] your blood
[6:04] thousands yeah millions have died during
[6:06] all the ages they died in the faith
[6:09] like antipas the faithful martyr they
[6:11] held not their lives dear unto death
[6:14] often we think that it would be almost
[6:16] impossible to be a martyr but dare to
[6:19] recall that the faith we daily use to
[6:21] triumph in christ jesus is the same
[6:23] faith that upholds the polycarps and all
[6:25] martyrs the supreme faith will give
[6:28] supreme grace for the supreme hour
[6:30] blessed be god forever
[6:33] and i will give thee a crown of life
[6:36] since not even a cup of cold water given
[6:38] in the name of the lord fails to receive
[6:40] a reward
[6:41] how great shall be the reward to him who
[6:43] gives his life as a martyr for the name
[6:45] of the lord jesus
[6:46] perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[6:49] compare this crown with the crown one in
[6:51] a race
[6:52] in first corinthians 9 24
[6:54] paul says
[6:56] know ye not that they which run in a
[6:58] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[7:01] so run that ye may obtain
[7:04] a crown given to the winner of the
[7:06] olympic race was a garland of olive
[7:07] branches
[7:08] but the crown spoken of here in the
[7:10] revelation given to a martyr is the
[7:12] crown of royalty
[7:14] jesus calls it the crown of life
[7:16] the one crown is for those who have
[7:18] striven the other is for those who have
[7:20] given
[7:22] both crowns are incorruptable they will
[7:24] not perish
[7:25] the winners of the worldly race of life
[7:27] will soon lose the joy of the plaudits
[7:29] of the world
[7:31] their glory will fail
[7:33] but those who give their lives for god
[7:35] either by daily striving or shedding
[7:37] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[7:39] their lives will be given the crown of
[7:41] life
[7:43] all too little time is spent on laboring
[7:45] for the eternal rewards of god
[7:47] the recompense of god is too lightly
[7:50] esteemed
[7:51] if we believe in the reality of the
[7:52] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[7:55] kingdom of substance
[7:56] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[7:58] good treasures that are available to the
[8:00] faithful saints
[8:03] the reward for overcoming
[8:06] revelation 2 11
[8:08] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[8:10] the spirit sayeth unto the churches
[8:13] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[8:15] the second death
[8:17] now once again the spirit is talking to
[8:19] all the ages
[8:20] this message is to comfort us today even
[8:23] as it has comforted our brethren of all
[8:25] the other ages
[8:26] and he says to us that the second death
[8:28] will not hurt us
[8:30] we all know that the second death is the
[8:32] lake of fire
[8:34] revelation 20 14
[8:36] and death and hell were cast into the
[8:38] lake of fire this is the second death
[8:42] of course that means all those who were
[8:44] therein were cast into the lake of fire
[8:47] now then i want to bring out something
[8:49] here for you
[8:50] it no doubt will cause people to comment
[8:52] on my strange doctrine
[8:54] but i stand here on the authority of the
[8:56] word of god and deny that the unbeliever
[8:58] goes to an eternal hell and burns there
[9:00] eternally
[9:02] in the first place hell or the lake of
[9:04] fire or whatever you want to call it is
[9:06] not eternal how can it be if it had a
[9:09] beginning
[9:10] in matthew 25 41 it says that
[9:14] everlasting fire was prepared for the
[9:16] devil and his angels
[9:18] now if it was prepared then it wasn't
[9:19] without a beginning
[9:21] if it had a beginning then it can't be
[9:23] eternal
[9:24] of course you might stumble over the
[9:25] idea of the word everlasting
[9:28] but that word means from the ages to the
[9:30] ages
[9:31] and has different meanings attached to
[9:33] it
[9:34] in first samuel 3 13-14
[9:37] god told samuel that he was going to
[9:39] judge the house of eli forever and that
[9:41] they would offer no more sacrifices
[9:43] forever as his priests
[9:46] and in second kings 2 27
[9:49] solomon thrust out the last descendants
[9:51] of eli from the priesthood
[9:53] that was four generations or so later
[9:56] now you can see that everlasting does
[9:58] not compare with what is eternal or that
[10:01] which had no beginning or end here in
[10:04] this case the word everlasting means to
[10:06] the vanishing point
[10:08] that is what happened
[10:10] they vanished
[10:12] look at the word destruction over in
[10:14] second thessalonians 1 9
[10:17] who shall be punished with everlasting
[10:18] destruction
[10:20] in the greek destruction positively
[10:22] means annihilation
[10:24] and the word destruction does not mean
[10:26] destroying
[10:28] now destroying means something going on
[10:30] and on in decay so what can everlasting
[10:33] annihilation mean
[10:35] it doesn't mean to keep on annihilating
[10:36] or that would make the word destroying
[10:39] instead of destruction
[10:41] it means to destroy to the ending point
[10:44] ended
[10:46] you might wonder now when you can use
[10:48] that word eternal and not use it the way
[10:50] we have been taught
[10:52] that is easy
[10:53] when it applies to god it means to be
[10:55] without beginning or end and ever
[10:57] enduring and never ceasing and when you
[11:00] talk of eternal life you have that in
[11:02] mind which is the life of god
[11:04] this is the record that god has given us
[11:07] eternal life
[11:08] and that life is in the sun
[11:10] he that hath the son hath
[11:12] life now then only sons of god have life
[11:16] eternal the kind that never had a
[11:18] beginning but always was
[11:20] that is right
[11:22] you have something in you right now that
[11:23] is eternal without beginning or end
[11:26] it is the spirit of god
[11:29] it is a part of god himself
[11:31] it is the life of god
[11:33] now if a sinner is going to go to hell
[11:35] and then suffer the same as you are
[11:37] going to heaven and enjoy heaven
[11:39] then he has the same kind of life you
[11:41] have already
[11:43] well then there might be those who say
[11:45] eternal life signifies the welfare of
[11:47] the children of god
[11:48] it is their welfare and enjoyment that
[11:51] is at stake
[11:52] on the other hand the sinner goes to his
[11:54] punishment so that we can reduce the
[11:56] second death to a matter of punishment
[11:58] and place
[11:59] eternal life means heaven and eternal
[12:01] punishment means hell
[12:03] you would be surprised at the men who
[12:05] have been exalted as theologians that
[12:07] believed that
[12:08] but do you know what that does
[12:11] it makes eternal life a matter of
[12:12] geography instead of a person
[12:15] eternal life is god the lord jesus
[12:17] christ
[12:18] how anyone could believe such a thing
[12:20] that eternal life is a matter of place
[12:22] is more than i know it makes me stagger
[12:24] to think of it
[12:26] no sir
[12:27] there is only one kind of eternal life
[12:30] god has it
[12:31] if we have god we have eternal life in
[12:34] and through him
[12:36] so you see that word eternal or
[12:37] everlasting can be applied in various
[12:39] ways
[12:40] but when it applies to god he being what
[12:43] he is it has one meaning
[12:45] it is the duration of god
[12:48] you can't apply it like that to any
[12:49] other thing
[12:51] god alone is eternal and because he
[12:53] lives we live with him
[12:56] now don't let anyone say that i don't
[12:58] believe in a lake of fire and in
[12:59] punishment i do
[13:02] i don't know how long it will last but
[13:04] it will eventually be removed
[13:06] in revelation 21 8 it says that those
[13:09] sinners mentioned will have their part
[13:11] in the lake of fire
[13:13] but the true interpretation of the word
[13:15] is not part but it is time
[13:18] see there you have it so the wicked
[13:20] shall be cast into hell hades or the
[13:23] grave and hell into the lake of fire
[13:26] separated from god
[13:28] what a terrible thing that will be
[13:31] but with the righteous it shall not be
[13:32] so
[13:33] they don't have to fear
[13:35] they have been redeemed by god
[13:37] they are in his bosom they are the
[13:39] overcomers
[13:41] and who is he that overcometh
[13:43] he that believeth that jesus is the
[13:45] christ
[13:47] why will this overcomer this believer
[13:49] escape and go into realms of eternal
[13:51] life and bliss
[13:53] because jesus paid a price to ransom us
[13:55] from sin
[13:56] he filled the gap of separation and we
[13:58] who were afar off are now made nigh by
[14:01] the blood
[14:03] and they will never come into
[14:04] condemnation
[14:05] they will never be in that lake of fire
[14:08] they can never be lost for he will lose
[14:10] none of them not one of the redeemed
[14:13] will be anywhere except where jesus is
[14:16] do you know why that is
[14:18] i'll illustrate it for you
[14:20] i have a little boy joseph
[14:22] he is a part of me no matter what
[14:24] happens
[14:25] if i were a rich man the worst i could
[14:27] do would be to disinherit him
[14:29] but there is nothing that i can ever do
[14:31] to deny him
[14:32] i can't because he is a part of me
[14:35] here let's take a blood test let's match
[14:37] his blood with mine it'll prove that
[14:39] joseph is my son he is mine
[14:43] it's the blood test that shows whether
[14:44] you belong to god or not
[14:47] i can't help thinking of the time that i
[14:49] used to ride heard on purebred herefords
[14:51] out in colorado
[14:52] we used to have to bring in those cattle
[14:54] for government inspection if we wanted
[14:56] them to feed on government range
[14:58] but they would not allow one single
[15:00] animal that did not have the blood tag
[15:02] on the ear
[15:03] the tag signified that it was purebred
[15:06] the rangers that looked them over did
[15:07] not once look at the brand they just
[15:10] looked at the tag to see that the blood
[15:11] was the right blood
[15:13] hallelujah if it's the right blood it's
[15:15] got to be right
[15:18] you know god looked down and declared
[15:20] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[15:23] it is separated from me
[15:25] it can't approach unto me
[15:28] we know that all have sinned and fallen
[15:30] short of the glory of god
[15:32] that meant that all died all were
[15:34] separated
[15:35] and one day a time would come when even
[15:37] that bit of life would be snuffed out
[15:39] and it would be all over
[15:41] but god in love took an animal and took
[15:43] its life in the place of the sinner's
[15:45] life
[15:47] in the old testament the sinner brought
[15:48] a lamb
[15:49] he placed his hand on the lamb while the
[15:51] priest cut the lamb's throat he felt the
[15:54] bleeding and heard the bleeding
[15:56] he felt the body stiffen in death he saw
[15:59] the smoke of the sprinkled blood ascend
[16:01] to god
[16:02] he knew that the lamb had taken his
[16:04] place
[16:05] he knew that the lamb's life had been
[16:06] forfeited for his but the life of that
[16:09] lamb was animal life and it could not
[16:11] come back upon the sinner making him
[16:13] clean
[16:14] so he left with the same desire to sin
[16:17] he would go out with sin in his mind and
[16:19] come back and offer a sacrifice for the
[16:21] same thing a year later
[16:23] but in the new testament it is not so
[16:26] our dying lamb is the son of god who
[16:29] gave his blood a ransom for many
[16:32] by faith we walk up and place our hands
[16:34] upon that lamb we see him with the
[16:36] bloody wounds the lacerated back the
[16:39] cruel thorns tearing his brow
[16:41] we feel his pain and hear him cry
[16:44] my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
[16:48] and what happened
[16:49] the life that left that broken blood
[16:51] cell came back upon the repentant one
[16:54] the life that was in him came back upon
[16:56] us
[16:58] we go back with no more desire to sin
[17:00] and we now possess a hatred for the
[17:02] works and lusts of the flesh
[17:04] look at us
[17:06] what is our life
[17:07] just one little cell that came from our
[17:09] father
[17:10] the female does not have the hemoglobin
[17:13] she produces the egg she is the
[17:15] incubator
[17:16] but the blood comes from the male
[17:18] that is why the woman takes the man's
[17:20] name the children take his name the
[17:23] mother is the incubator for the children
[17:25] she bears him
[17:27] that is what happened for our redemption
[17:29] the holy ghost came upon mary and she
[17:31] bore a son and called him jesus
[17:34] the great creator came down and became a
[17:36] sacrifice for our sin
[17:38] his blood was the blood of god
[17:40] that is exactly what it was
[17:43] that blood of god was shed and the
[17:45] spirit left him as he died in agony
[17:47] then the same life spirit came back to
[17:50] indwell the repentant sinner and set him
[17:52] free
[17:53] that sinner did not come back year after
[17:55] year sacrifice after sacrifice for there
[17:58] was no need by one sacrifice
[18:02] once and for all he has been set free
[18:04] from the dominion of sin
[18:06] and has received the life of christ
[18:07] whereby he reigns in victory over sin
[18:10] the world the flesh and the devil
[18:13] god did it
[18:14] he did it all
[18:16] he cried out to the world cursed in sin
[18:19] i will give you a sign
[18:21] a virgin shall be with child a virgin
[18:23] shall conceive and bear a son
[18:25] that will be your sign
[18:27] it will be an everlasting sign
[18:30] what she brings forth will be emmanuel
[18:32] god with us
[18:35] god came down in a blood cell not
[18:37] through a man but by the holy ghost
[18:39] and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for
[18:41] the purpose of death was built
[18:43] the seed of the woman came in order that
[18:45] he be bruised to bring us our salvation
[18:48] when the holy ghost came upon mary he
[18:50] created within her womb the cell that
[18:52] would multiply and become the body of
[18:54] our lord
[18:55] that cell was created it was the
[18:58] beginning of the creation of god
[19:00] that is who jesus is
[19:02] and that holy one was filled with holy
[19:04] blood even the blood of god
[19:07] that tabernacle came to birth
[19:09] he grew to be a man
[19:10] he went to jordan and there that
[19:12] sacrifice was washed of john in the
[19:14] river called jordan
[19:16] when that acceptable sacrifice rose out
[19:18] of the water
[19:19] god came and indwelt him
[19:21] filling him with the spirit without
[19:23] measure
[19:24] and when he died and shed his blood
[19:27] the perfect life of god was liberated to
[19:29] come back upon the sinner who would
[19:30] accept the christ as his savior
[19:33] oh how striking it is
[19:35] jehovah born crying over a manure pile
[19:38] jehovah born in a manger of straw
[19:40] there is your everlasting sign to the
[19:42] proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals
[19:45] that have evolved their own theology and
[19:47] denied the truth of god
[19:49] jehovah god a crying baby in a stinking
[19:52] barn
[19:53] then we think we have a right to be
[19:54] proud holding up our noses criticizing
[19:57] and acting as though we were somebody
[19:59] here's your real sign
[20:01] this is the right one
[20:03] jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working
[20:06] in a carpenter's shop
[20:08] jehovah washing the feet of fishermen
[20:11] i'll give you a sign said god
[20:14] not the sign of a white-collared
[20:15] priesthood
[20:16] not the sign of wealth and power
[20:18] there's nothing in this sign that you
[20:20] will want or think suitable
[20:22] but it is an everlasting sign
[20:25] it is the greatest sign of all
[20:28] jehovah's standing in the courtyard
[20:29] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[20:32] brow and spit on his face mocked and set
[20:35] out not
[20:36] jehovah despised and rejected hanging
[20:39] naked upon the cross while the
[20:40] hypocrites jeered and dared him to come
[20:42] down off the cross
[20:44] jehovah dying
[20:46] jehovah praying and nothing happening
[20:49] then jehovah died
[20:51] that is the sign for all men now
[20:53] there isn't another like it
[20:55] it is the great one
[20:58] then darkness came upon the earth
[21:00] they put him in a tomb
[21:02] there he lay those three days and nights
[21:04] until an earthquake shattered the gloom
[21:06] of night and he came forth
[21:08] jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on
[21:11] high
[21:12] then jehovah returned to indwell his
[21:14] church
[21:15] jehovah came back with a mighty rushing
[21:17] wind and flames of fire
[21:19] jehovah came back to walk in the midst
[21:22] of his church and empower his people
[21:24] once more jehovah came
[21:26] and this time to stay in his people
[21:29] and again jehovah heals the sick raises
[21:32] the dead and manifests himself by the
[21:34] spirit
[21:35] jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[21:37] and giving the answer back in
[21:39] interpretation
[21:41] jehovah came down and he raised the
[21:43] prostitute to sin no more
[21:45] he came down to the drunkard with fly
[21:47] blows on his face as he lay unconscious
[21:49] in the gutter
[21:51] yes jehovah came to manifest in flesh
[21:53] and manifest through flesh
[21:55] jehovah came
[21:57] god in us the hope of glory
[22:00] yes jesus came and shed his blood and
[22:02] set the captive free
[22:04] he came and redeemed his lost sheep
[22:07] he gave them eternal life and they shall
[22:09] never perish
[22:10] he won't lose one of them but raise them
[22:12] up at the last day
[22:15] hallelujah the second death cannot hurt
[22:17] them it has no power over them for they
[22:20] are the lambs and they follow him
[22:22] wherever he goes
[22:26] the holy spirit in every age
[22:29] revelation 2 11
[22:31] he that hath an ear
[22:33] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[22:35] the churches
[22:36] there is not one church age where this
[22:38] verse is not mentioned
[22:40] every single age has the same admonition
[22:43] to the people of every age
[22:45] he that hath an ear
[22:47] let him hear what the spirit saith
[22:49] but it is absolutely impossible for all
[22:52] men to hear what the spirit says to the
[22:53] different ages
[22:55] first corinthians 2 6-16
[22:59] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[23:00] that are perfect
[23:02] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[23:04] the princes of this world that come to
[23:06] naught
[23:07] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[23:09] mystery even the hidden wisdom which god
[23:12] ordained before the world unto our glory
[23:15] which none of the princes of this world
[23:17] knew
[23:18] for had they known it they would not
[23:20] have crucified the lord of glory
[23:22] but as it is written
[23:24] i hath not seen nor ear heard
[23:27] neither have entered into the heart of
[23:28] man
[23:29] the things which god hath prepared for
[23:31] them that love him
[23:33] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[23:35] his spirit
[23:36] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[23:38] the deep things of god
[23:40] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[23:43] save the spirit of man which is in him
[23:46] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[23:48] but the spirit of god
[23:51] now we have received not the spirit of
[23:53] the world but the spirit which is of god
[23:56] that we might know the things that are
[23:57] freely given to us of god
[24:00] which things also we speak not in the
[24:02] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[24:04] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[24:06] comparing spiritual things with
[24:08] spiritual
[24:10] but the natural man receiveth not the
[24:11] things of the spirit of god
[24:14] for they are foolishness unto him
[24:16] neither can he know them because they
[24:18] are spiritually discerned
[24:20] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[24:22] things yet he himself is judged of no
[24:24] man
[24:25] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[24:28] that he may instruct him
[24:30] but we have the mind of christ
[24:32] matthew 13 13-16
[24:36] therefore speak i to them in parables
[24:39] because they seeing see not and hearing
[24:41] they hear not
[24:43] neither do they understand
[24:45] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[24:47] isaias which saith
[24:49] by hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[24:51] understand
[24:52] and seeing ye shall see and shall not
[24:54] perceive
[24:56] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[24:58] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[25:00] their eyes they have closed
[25:03] lest at any time they should see with
[25:04] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[25:07] should understand with their heart and
[25:09] should be converted and i should heal
[25:11] them
[25:12] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[25:14] and your ears for they hear
[25:17] john 8 42-44
[25:20] jesus said unto them
[25:22] if god were your father you would love
[25:24] me
[25:25] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[25:28] neither came i of myself but he sent me
[25:30] why do you not understand my speech
[25:33] even because you cannot hear my word
[25:36] you are of your father the devil and the
[25:39] lusts of your father you will do
[25:41] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[25:43] abode not in the truth because there is
[25:45] no truth in him
[25:47] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[25:49] his own
[25:50] for he is a liar and the father of it
[25:54] it is most evident from these scriptures
[25:55] that no man of himself can hear god
[25:59] that ability has to be given him of god
[26:02] matthew 16
[26:03] 17
[26:05] and jesus answered and said unto him
[26:08] blessed art thou simon barjona
[26:10] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[26:12] unto thee but my father which is in
[26:14] heaven
[26:16] putting these verses together we see
[26:18] that there is only one group of people
[26:20] and that a very special group of people
[26:22] who are able to hear what the spirit
[26:24] says in each age
[26:26] it is one special group that receives
[26:28] the revelation for each age
[26:30] that group is of god
[26:32] because the group that cannot hear is
[26:34] not of god
[26:36] john 8 42-44
[26:39] the group that can and does hear what
[26:41] the spirit is saying and receives the
[26:43] revelation thereof
[26:44] is that group described in first
[26:46] corinthians 2 6-16
[26:49] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[26:51] god they are the ones that are born of
[26:53] god they are baptized into the body of
[26:56] the lord jesus christ by his spirit they
[26:59] are baptized with the holy ghost
[27:02] to further bring out what we have just
[27:04] said
[27:05] and to also use a scripture that should
[27:07] be borne in mind as we talk about who it
[27:09] is that is baptized with the holy ghost
[27:11] see what jesus says in john 6 45
[27:15] it is written in the prophets
[27:17] and they shall all be taught of god
[27:20] but turn to isaiah 54 13
[27:23] whence this is taken and it reads
[27:26] and all thy children shall be taught of
[27:28] the lord the all of god are the children
[27:31] of god
[27:32] thus it is that the evidence of being a
[27:35] true child of god
[27:37] he whom the spirit has come upon and
[27:39] indwells
[27:40] is again set forth as one taught the
[27:42] word by the holy ghost
[27:45] now you can begin to see why tongues is
[27:47] not the evidence of being baptized with
[27:49] the holy ghost
[27:50] it doesn't say in any age that
[27:53] he that hath a tongue let him say what
[27:55] the spirit is saying
[27:58] that puts tongues interpretation thereof
[28:00] and prophecy etc aside as an evidence
[28:04] the evidence is hearing what the spirit
[28:05] says
[28:06] the spirit is talking
[28:08] yes the spirit is teaching
[28:10] that is exactly what jesus said he would
[28:12] do when he came
[28:14] john 14 26
[28:17] he will teach you all things and bring
[28:19] all things to your remembrance
[28:21] whatsoever i have said unto you
[28:23] and that is just what happened
[28:25] that is how the gospels were written
[28:28] these men had recalled to their minds by
[28:29] the holy ghost the very words that jesus
[28:32] spake
[28:33] that is why the gospels are accurate
[28:35] they are perfect
[28:37] but the spirit did not only bring all
[28:39] things to their minds but he taught them
[28:41] further on the truth they already had
[28:43] that is how paul received his
[28:45] revelations
[28:47] he said concerning it
[28:49] but i certify you brethren that the
[28:50] gospel which was preached of me is not
[28:53] after man
[28:54] for i neither received it of man neither
[28:56] was i taught it of man
[28:58] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[29:01] galatians 1
[29:02] 11-12
[29:04] he was taught by the holy ghost
[29:08] one day when jesus was upon earth a
[29:10] certain important man came to visit him
[29:13] this man said
[29:14] rabbi we know you are a teacher sent
[29:16] from god
[29:17] but you will notice that jesus cut him
[29:19] short
[29:20] he turned to nicodemus and the words he
[29:22] spoke may well be paraphrased thusly
[29:25] i am not a teacher
[29:27] i am the sacrificial lamb for sin
[29:30] i am making possible the new birth by my
[29:32] spirit
[29:33] but there is a coming one who is the
[29:35] teacher
[29:36] he is the holy spirit
[29:38] when jesus was upon the earth he came as
[29:41] the lamb and as the prophet
[29:43] but when he came back upon the church by
[29:45] his spirit he became the teacher
[29:48] and to every age we hear the same truth
[29:51] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[29:53] the spirit sayeth to the churches
[29:55] but only a spirit-filled man can hear
[29:57] the revelation for that age
[29:59] none other can
[30:01] no sir
[30:02] they cannot because that is exactly what
[30:04] paul said in first corinthians two six
[30:06] through sixteen
[30:08] now this ought to make you rejoice
[30:11] there is a most peculiar doctrine in the
[30:12] air that is causing much
[30:13] misunderstanding and hard feelings
[30:16] for when the pentecostals say you must
[30:18] speak in tongues or you haven't been
[30:20] baptized with the holy ghost
[30:22] they are either denying that great men
[30:24] like knox moody taylor go forth and
[30:26] others
[30:27] did not receive the holy ghost
[30:29] or saying that they all secretly spoke
[30:31] in tongues and were not aware of what
[30:33] was going on
[30:34] now that is not true no sir
[30:37] that is gross error
[30:39] tongues are not the evidence of being
[30:40] spirit-filled
[30:42] it is simply one of the nine
[30:43] manifestations mentioned in first
[30:45] corinthians 12.
[30:47] there is no scripture that says you
[30:48] receive the holy spirit speaking in
[30:50] tongues or that you receive the holy
[30:52] spirit by speaking in tongues
[30:54] but it does say that
[30:56] after they were all filled with the holy
[30:58] ghost they spake in tongues
[31:00] and later on it says that they
[31:02] prophesied
[31:04] today
[31:09] [Music]
[31:34] you
