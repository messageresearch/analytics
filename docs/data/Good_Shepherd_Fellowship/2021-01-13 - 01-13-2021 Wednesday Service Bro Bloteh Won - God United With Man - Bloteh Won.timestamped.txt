[1:14:23] he said this and i wanted to read it to
[1:14:26] you
[1:14:30] from the message united time is signed
[1:14:32] he said
[1:14:34] water unity when
[1:14:37] god united himself
[1:14:41] in a human body
[1:14:47] the principle the greatest of all
[1:14:50] the uniting that ever was done
[1:14:57] was when god united with man
[1:15:02] and left his great strength
[1:15:05] of being god his great strength
[1:15:09] of being god that will ever remain
[1:15:12] a mystery to us when god
[1:15:16] left his great stream
[1:15:19] of being god
[1:15:24] and stretch forth his tent
[1:15:29] can you be able to imagine that
[1:15:34] that god left his great stream of being
[1:15:39] in tenor of being
[1:15:42] self-existent
[1:15:46] and he stretched for his tent
[1:15:49] and i mean he stretches so thin
[1:15:54] that he could drop down into a sistine
[1:15:57] element body
[1:16:00] praise the lord and yet the prophet of
[1:16:04] god says that is the
[1:16:06] greatest the greatest unity
[1:16:11] it is uniting
[1:16:17] he stretched for his team he become one
[1:16:19] of them
[1:16:21] to redeem them unity that's what
[1:16:26] that brought peace between
[1:16:29] god and man forever
[1:16:33] how thankful we are
[1:16:36] are we thankful yeah tonight
[1:16:40] because of that thank you lord are we
[1:16:42] thankful is it is it because
[1:16:44] it's are we thankful because we we are
[1:16:47] part of the good shepherd church
[1:16:49] fellowship are we thankful because we
[1:16:51] hear the message of the hour
[1:16:53] if there is if there is ever a thing
[1:16:57] that we must be thankful for
[1:17:00] is that god left his dream of being god
[1:17:05] for him to unite with us yes
[1:17:10] for him to come down
[1:17:15] and pay the debt that we could not pay
[1:17:20] if there is ever a thing that must never
[1:17:23] leave
[1:17:23] our conscience that we must be thankful
[1:17:27] for
[1:17:28] praise the lord being thankful for a
[1:17:31] prophet
[1:17:32] and not being thankful for this
[1:17:35] you might be standing in the wrong place
[1:17:38] being thankful for a message and not
[1:17:41] being thankful for this
[1:17:43] why because this is why the message came
[1:17:46] this is why god sent us a prophet for us
[1:17:49] to be able to see
[1:17:51] what he have done
[1:17:54] that he left the strain of being god
[1:17:58] yes brother yes
[1:18:02] that is something that we will never
[1:18:04] never comprehend that's right
[1:18:06] we will never be able to put it in words
[1:18:10] the great apostle paul says great is the
[1:18:13] mystery
[1:18:13] yes of godliness
[1:18:18] that god left the stream of being god
[1:18:21] to unite himself with us how thankful
[1:18:27] we are and may god help us to ever
[1:18:30] remain thankful
[1:18:31] yes
[1:18:36] in paragraph 83 of that message he says
[1:18:40] the trouble of 8a's with men
[1:18:43] they don't know he don't know his leader
[1:18:48] yes sir i was going to go back tonight
[1:18:50] to talk about the injury of the exeter
[1:18:53] that was that was the reason why i put
[1:18:54] this code but i've just i'm just kind of
[1:18:56] for changing
[1:18:57] a little bit here just for the 15
[1:18:59] minutes that is before me

[1:19:03] little different
[1:19:05] just to encourage you and to show you
[1:19:08] and
[1:19:09] and for us to see a beauty
[1:19:12] that is lay in god's word the trouble of

[1:19:16] man with man he don't know his leader
[1:19:18] yes sir
[1:19:20] they will rally around the nomination
[1:19:26] they will rally around a bishop or a man
[1:19:31] i am not even afraid to say they will
[1:19:32] rally around political parties
[1:19:37] but they won't rally around the leader
[1:19:41] their leader the holy spirit
[1:19:46] in the world he is the leader
[1:19:50] of this accident amen amen
[1:19:55] he is the leader of this exeter
[1:19:59] may god help us yes and we can rally it
[1:20:01] around our leader
[1:20:03] if we would get out of here we have to
[1:20:06] rally around him
[1:20:07] because he's the one that is leading the
[1:20:16] way may the lord just bless
[1:20:19] the rest of his word tonight i hope
[1:20:23] what we want to share with you will be a
[1:20:24] blessing also praise the lord
[1:20:27] as i make this prophecy it is something
[1:20:29] that we all
[1:20:30] are very familiar with you look in luke
[1:20:33] chapter 3
[1:20:35] the gospel of luke chapter 3 and you
[1:20:38] you'll find there
[1:20:40] uh in luke chapter 3 you find it in
[1:20:43] matthew chapter 3 you find it in mark
[1:20:45] chapter
[1:20:46] one in luke chapter three
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:50] let's take it a little bit from uh from
[1:20:53] the
[1:20:53] from the gospel uh we reading it from
[1:20:56] the prophet isaiah
[1:20:58] in uh in in luke noun
[1:21:02] is recording the fulfillment amen
[1:21:06] luke is recalling the fulfillment verse
[1:21:09] four as it is written
[1:21:11] in the book of the words of isaiah the
[1:21:16] prophet saying
[1:21:17] the voice of one crying
[1:21:20] in the wilderness prepared ye the way
[1:21:24] of the lord make his path straight
[1:21:28] praise the lord i was i was i was uh
[1:21:32] uh reading i was having a devotion one
[1:21:35] night
[1:21:36] early in the morning late night and and
[1:21:38] and and
[1:21:40] as i was reading this and i stumbled
[1:21:42] across this is
[1:21:43] it it caught my attention in a way that
[1:21:46] i've never seen now remember now
[1:21:48] praise the lord amen when
[1:21:51] when isaiah give this prophecy
[1:21:55] something he said here that i don't want
[1:21:57] us to overlook
[1:21:58] because it's going to bring bring out
[1:22:00] the prophecy real
[1:22:02] he says for the glory of the lord that
[1:22:04] is in verse 5
[1:22:05] shall be revealed and all flesh
[1:22:09] shall see it together for the mouth of
[1:22:12] the lord has spoken
[1:22:14] it amen now
[1:22:17] like i said before this is god bringing
[1:22:20] comfort to his people
[1:22:22] after they will go 400 maybe 600 years
[1:22:25] without a prophet
[1:22:26] israel go in i mean in the dark period
[1:22:29] of time after malachi
[1:22:30] and god is going to bring a man on the
[1:22:33] scene god is going to bring
[1:22:34] a man the forerunner now the reason why
[1:22:39] i want to pick this is speaking about
[1:22:41] john the baptist but yet instead
[1:22:43] we will realize that it has some
[1:22:46] application towards
[1:22:47] our day in our time because it's a
[1:22:50] prophecy
[1:22:51] to to to mankind it's not a prophecy
[1:22:54] that is just only
[1:22:55] unique to uh john the baptist in the day
[1:22:59] that he came
[1:23:00] praise the lord because the voice that
[1:23:03] was crying in the wilderness in one
[1:23:06] sense it describes john's physical
[1:23:10] ministry but in another sense
[1:23:13] the spirit of man has wandered away from
[1:23:16] god
[1:23:17] and his whole spirit being has become
[1:23:19] like a wilderness
[1:23:22] praise the lord amen man's spirit is
[1:23:26] like a wilderness
[1:23:30] born from a father that have
[1:23:34] james running down from grandfather
[1:23:36] great-grandfather and
[1:23:38] generation and and and a mother that had
[1:23:40] a
[1:23:41] uh hall owner james running down and
[1:23:43] yaris said it gave
[1:23:44] birth to us and and and we come into the
[1:23:47] world with all of these
[1:23:49] all of these uh uh things that that make
[1:23:52] us that make
[1:23:52] the complex being that we are that's
[1:23:55] some of the things that give us complex
[1:23:58] because our spirit is like a wilderness
[1:24:02] the real you is caught up in that
[1:24:05] wilderness
[1:24:06] and it will take a voice of god
[1:24:10] to break you out for you to know
[1:24:14] yourself
[1:24:20] that's the reason why young people grow
[1:24:22] up they want to be like movie stars
[1:24:24] they want to be like the best football
[1:24:26] player they want to be like a basketball
[1:24:28] player
[1:24:29] it's all because we are in the
[1:24:31] wilderness
[1:24:35] and when a man is in the wilderness and
[1:24:37] he's lost
[1:24:38] that's right there's a beautiful thing
[1:24:41] that
[1:24:42] that i discovered this week and it was
[1:24:45] so precious
[1:24:46] to me and i was keeping conversation
[1:24:48] with someone and we were you know we
[1:24:50] were talking some things in
[1:24:52] and and different things we were talking
[1:24:54] about
[1:24:55] and uh and the person says something to
[1:24:58] me and he says he says yeah bro you know
[1:25:00] that's
[1:25:00] i mean that's the way it is you know a
[1:25:02] man that stays by water
[1:25:04] can never be lost that thought stuck to
[1:25:07] my mind
[1:25:09] and i started going i said i have to
[1:25:11] look into this
[1:25:13] i have to look into this praise the lord
[1:25:18] amen sometimes when you call me you
[1:25:21] don't get me and i'm looking into
[1:25:22] something
[1:25:24] that have just caught my mind that is
[1:25:26] hard for me to get away from
[1:25:28] so i apologize praise the lord
[1:25:32] but it's beautiful as i begin to think
[1:25:34] about it
[1:25:36] uh because you know as i year
[1:25:39] i would not want to go into that because
[1:25:41] i'm losing my time here
[1:25:43] he talks about the weight of the law
[1:25:45] that is in the sea
[1:25:48] and do you know that it is it is that
[1:25:50] scripture
[1:25:51] that makes a man to go and steady
[1:25:57] see geographic
[1:26:01] to be able to make uh how you call in
[1:26:05] there compacts for ships
[1:26:12] i'll bring you more information on that
[1:26:15] praise the lord
[1:26:20] but here is god making a promise
[1:26:26] realizing that this is the forerunner
[1:26:31] the forerunner that is going to make a
[1:26:34] way for the lord
[1:26:35] the scripture said prepare a way for the
[1:26:38] lord
[1:26:40] amen prepared a way for the lord he was
[1:26:44] to prepare a way
[1:26:46] so if he was to prepare the way you must
[1:26:49] realize
[1:26:50] that he's going to make
[1:26:53] he's going to have a compass amen
[1:26:57] he's going to make a road map
[1:27:01] and this way that he's going to prepare
[1:27:03] for the lord
[1:27:05] is to be able to make a way in the
[1:27:07] wilderness
[1:27:08] of lost man's spirit because he was
[1:27:11] preparing a way to bring man
[1:27:13] back to god he was preparing a way that
[1:27:16] the messiah will come
[1:27:19] to come and redeem adam falling rich
[1:27:24] praise the lord amen
[1:27:27] are we together now watch the scripture
[1:27:30] now
[1:27:31] you will appreciate god's word
[1:27:34] because it's so beautiful god's word is
[1:27:38] so precious
[1:27:40] praise the lord amen
[1:27:46] every valley
[1:27:49] shall be filled
[1:27:55] praise the lord amen
[1:27:58] he's coming from on high
[1:28:02] he's leaving his strain of being god
[1:28:06] and he's humbling himself so he's
[1:28:09] descending
[1:28:09] in the valley amen
[1:28:14] to bring man from our law
[1:28:21] and dark thoughts and dark spirit
[1:28:27] amen all the doubting and despair
[1:28:31] must be removed all the self-seeking
[1:28:35] and kind of desire must be forsaken
[1:28:41] across these deep valley
[1:28:46] a glorious cause word of grace must be
[1:28:50] raised
[1:28:53] so he's coming to bring make every
[1:28:55] valley to be exotic
[1:28:58] glory be to god
[1:29:01] and for father when john the baptist
[1:29:03] came he never came with a construction
[1:29:05] team he never came with bulldozer
[1:29:09] a physical bulldozer but he had a word
[1:29:13] he had a message so you can see
[1:29:17] that this prophecy is prophesying by
[1:29:22] vision
[1:29:23] can only describe what what whatever he
[1:29:25] saw in the vision
[1:29:27] but god here fulfilling the vision
[1:29:30] took a simple man from the wilderness
[1:29:34] when they are nine years old came out at
[1:29:36] 13 years old
[1:29:39] praise the lord amen he's giving hope
[1:29:43] to the common people
[1:29:47] he's calling them to the redeemer he
[1:29:50] leave
[1:29:50] the sanhedrin council he leave the
[1:29:53] religious people of that day
[1:29:55] and he's raising the common people from
[1:29:57] the street
[1:30:00] the despised people
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:04] but he had a message that can meet them
[1:30:07] in their situation
[1:30:08] and give them hope for them to rise up
[1:30:11] again
[1:30:13] every valley will be insulted
[1:30:21] remember jesus said if i be lifted up
[1:30:24] yes i will draw all man
[1:30:28] i will draw all men
[1:30:32] unto me praise the lord
[1:30:36] amen amen
[1:30:42] and then he says every mountain in hell
[1:30:46] shall be he had a message
[1:30:52] he had a message for herod and
[1:30:55] herodis he had a message
[1:30:59] for kai fights when he met the tax
[1:31:02] collector he had a message for him
[1:31:07] you tricking the people and robbing them
[1:31:09] of their money
[1:31:11] he said the axe is laid against the tree
[1:31:15] oh my goodness this is a forerunner this
[1:31:19] is a message of a forerunner
[1:31:24] praise the lord we know that he was not
[1:31:28] physically cutting trees down
[1:31:30] and paving the physical road in
[1:31:32] jerusalem
[1:31:33] as many who have talked that this
[1:31:35] prophecy is
[1:31:37] maybe they were looking for their
[1:31:38] messiah to see brand new highway running
[1:31:41] down but there was a voice of one crying
[1:31:43] in the wilderness
[1:31:47] prepare be praying the way for the lord
[1:31:51] now once again once again
[1:31:54] god we have entrance to the human spirit
[1:32:00] remember they were under the blood of
[1:32:02] bulls and god
[1:32:04] all they are watching hands and watching
[1:32:06] feet and washing pens
[1:32:09] was never bringing god to the inside
[1:32:12] of their soul but there is a message
[1:32:16] here
[1:32:17] that is going to cut everything and once
[1:32:20] again
[1:32:23] like adam heard the voice of god when
[1:32:26] god said adam
[1:32:27] adam where are you he heard that voice
[1:32:30] from within.
[1:32:34] praise the lord amen amen
[1:32:37] he heard that voice from within that's
[1:32:40] the reason why when god speaks to you
[1:32:42] he speaks to you from within amen
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:51] every mountain
[1:32:54] every proud
[1:33:01] boastful self-righteous
[1:33:06] that's the way he was dealing with him
[1:33:08] he had a message for those boastful
[1:33:10] severance pharisees
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:16] he said they were just like dead man
[1:33:20] bones
[1:33:22] praise the lord he went lord he went
[1:33:25] high
[1:33:26] he went right he went left
[1:33:29] that's your compass
[1:33:36] every seven righteous must be level
[1:33:40] to make brother even talk about it he
[1:33:42] says he says
[1:33:43] uh uh that's the reason why they could
[1:33:46] not even accept john's message
[1:33:51] because they asked him are you elijah
[1:33:54] are you the messiah
[1:33:56] he identified himself with
[1:34:00] a prophecy and voice of one crying in
[1:34:03] the wilderness
[1:34:04] i could see those stripes growing back
[1:34:07] oh yeah i know where as i
[1:34:08] said that as i chapter 40 well go back
[1:34:10] and read it
[1:34:12] but when they are reading it they are
[1:34:14] looking for the guy coming with a
[1:34:16] construction truck
[1:34:19] bulldozer to be cutting trees down
[1:34:22] when they were right before them yes
[1:34:26] praise the lord amen when the highway
[1:34:30] the way of the lord was not a physical
[1:34:33] street
[1:34:34] the way of the lord is how he would get
[1:34:36] back
[1:34:38] to the human soul how he would get back
[1:34:42] into relationship with mankind from the
[1:34:45] inside
[1:34:46] of the inside
[1:34:54] every mountain in high heel
[1:34:59] divine fellowship people
[1:35:03] that's the reason why
[1:35:10] we were never
[1:35:14] see the fullness that this message of
[1:35:17] the
[1:35:18] hour has brought to us
[1:35:22] praise the lord brother branham said
[1:35:26] souls in praising he said just like
[1:35:30] under the old testament coveting word
[1:35:34] the worshipers the life
[1:35:38] of the animal could not come on the
[1:35:41] worshipers
[1:35:43] because it was just a substitute he says
[1:35:46] that is the same way
[1:35:48] under the ages of the reformation
[1:35:52] they could not bring that talking life
[1:35:57] they couldn't bring the talking life you
[1:35:59] think about it
[1:36:00] luthor was a reformer amen
[1:36:05] but he could not come to talking life
[1:36:09] he brought a message and he stirred out
[1:36:11] the people and even
[1:36:13] even in his own life
[1:36:16] he still held to his pipe
[1:36:19] he could not come to talking life and
[1:36:22] that's the reason why
[1:36:24] malachi 4 said the talking message
[1:36:28] was a highlight of why god sent a
[1:36:31] prophet
[1:36:33] because what it means it means that
[1:36:38] by the opening of the seals once again
[1:36:41] god has broken open
[1:36:45] the literal life
[1:36:49] once again the soul of the believer
[1:36:53] that's the reason why the baptising of
[1:36:55] the holy ghost
[1:36:56] cannot be associated with with church
[1:37:00] membership
[1:37:01] they don't have anything to do with i
[1:37:04] mean
[1:37:05] being in branham tabernacle it don't
[1:37:07] have anything to do of how long you
[1:37:09] because it's the life of jesus christ
[1:37:12] black on the soul of the worshipper
[1:37:19] that is the reason why i would encourage
[1:37:20] you tonight don't take nothing less than
[1:37:23] that
[1:37:25] don't take nothing less than that
[1:37:31] amen praise the lord
[1:37:35] because some of these things that god
[1:37:37] laid in his word in prophecy
[1:37:39] they were more deeper than the things
[1:37:41] that the people taught
[1:37:43] yes a prophecy of a voice of one crying
[1:37:46] in the wilderness and the people
[1:37:48] limited it to physical manifestation
[1:37:51] until when god sent the messenger
[1:37:54] they could not see that he was making
[1:37:55] way
[1:37:57] in the spirit of the people that's what
[1:38:00] brother branham when he talks about
[1:38:01] simon
[1:38:02] and say his father taught him simon how
[1:38:04] to fish and say simon one day the
[1:38:06] messiah would come
[1:38:07] and this would be the sign of the
[1:38:08] messiah and this is what the messiah
[1:38:11] would do
[1:38:11] and brother brahm talked about blind by
[1:38:13] timos and how his parents taught him a
[1:38:16] blind boy that one day the messiah would
[1:38:18] come
[1:38:18] and and all of these things they were
[1:38:21] taught
[1:38:21] by that but you see there was something
[1:38:25] that had to
[1:38:26] open the way
[1:38:30] open the way of the human spirit
[1:38:34] praise the lord
[1:38:42] some of some of the young people have
[1:38:44] the privilege to be born around
[1:38:46] around the message i mean it does not
[1:38:48] mean it's a holy ghost to you you need
[1:38:50] to be born again you need an experience
[1:38:52] with god
[1:38:53] but but some came out of out of
[1:38:55] denomination where they were so tied to
[1:38:57] the accretes of denomination
[1:38:59] and and at that time it would be
[1:39:01] difficult for you to believe that there
[1:39:03] is anything different from what you know
[1:39:06] but how did this work comes to you
[1:39:09] god had to make a way in your wilderness
[1:39:15] he had to open a path he had to bring
[1:39:19] bring you from your low state
[1:39:23] he had to cut down some of your
[1:39:25] mountains
[1:39:27] and make it plain
[1:39:31] and make it plain that you can be able
[1:39:34] to see the word of the lord today
[1:39:37] to be able to rejoice in the revelation
[1:39:39] of the hour
[1:39:44] pray praise the lord is it strange
[1:39:48] that the bible says the crooked shall be
[1:39:51] made straight
[1:39:53] lies deceitfulness
[1:39:58] amen a spirit to cheat
[1:40:04] is right there right in the human spirit
[1:40:11] the crooked will be made
[1:40:14] straight the rough some people have
[1:40:18] rough life
[1:40:20] verb talks about the the woman at the
[1:40:22] well
[1:40:23] that was not her choice she had a rough
[1:40:26] life
[1:40:27] sex hustle going from the hand of one
[1:40:30] man to another
[1:40:40] rahab the prophet god said she
[1:40:44] she only did there because that was the
[1:40:46] main there was a way for her to have
[1:40:48] means
[1:40:49] to be able to take care of her parents
[1:40:53] it was not really a choice of life for
[1:40:55] her
[1:40:58] some people have rough life
[1:41:02] but a voice in the wilderness will reach
[1:41:05] out
[1:41:06] and bring them out
[1:41:09] of that rough life rough
[1:41:13] life
[1:41:17] they sit there and they just cry
[1:41:21] they just cry there's nothing of their
[1:41:22] fart
[1:41:31] but there is a voice there's a voice
[1:41:36] and that's what this voice of god is for
[1:41:44] reaching out praise the lord
[1:41:47] amen those crooked
[1:41:52] places wavering hearts
[1:41:55] must be made straight a path of decision
[1:41:58] of god and holiness
[1:42:00] markow double-minded man
[1:42:05] our strangers to god's truth
[1:42:09] praise the lord and sometimes people
[1:42:13] struggle with that you you just
[1:42:14] see see see the type that the bible
[1:42:16] placed there for jacob
[1:42:19] there was something that he struggled
[1:42:21] with he had the breath right
[1:42:24] he had the blessing of the fire of his
[1:42:26] father
[1:42:27] but yet he struggled with cheating and
[1:42:30] lying
[1:42:33] even after the angel met him
[1:42:37] after the angel met him and changed his
[1:42:40] name
[1:42:41] from jacob to israel
[1:42:44] when he was going to meet his brother
[1:42:49] amen when he was going to meet his
[1:42:52] brother
[1:42:53] he never said well the angel met me i'm
[1:42:55] going to he says
[1:42:56] go in from go and appease him
[1:43:00] still finding ways because look
[1:43:03] those things they are they are in our
[1:43:06] spirit
[1:43:09] they are in our spirit
[1:43:13] and until god sent us a prophet for us
[1:43:16] to be able to
[1:43:18] understand that there is a dividing
[1:43:20] asylum between the spirit and the soul
[1:43:24] many people have cast themselves to hell
[1:43:27] because they have struggled with things
[1:43:29] in their lives
[1:43:30] they have cried to god to deliver them
[1:43:33] and sometimes
[1:43:34] god just need to have that thing there
[1:43:37] to keep you humble the rest of your life
[1:43:44] praise the lord it does not mean that
[1:43:46] you are not safe you are safe
[1:43:48] but god knows that if he takes that
[1:43:50] thing up you're going to run like in my
[1:43:53] dog
[1:43:54] so he's going to keep it there
[1:43:58] that's the way he can bring you on your
[1:44:00] knees for you to cry
[1:44:02] so your heart can be tender so he can be
[1:44:06] able to deal with you
[1:44:11] amen praise the lord
[1:44:16] and what did the false religious
[1:44:18] teaching taught us
[1:44:19] that people that will be dealing with
[1:44:21] those things you are possessed of the
[1:44:23] devil
[1:44:23] you you have crossed the line
[1:44:29] you remember the woman that came to
[1:44:31] brother branham in the prayer line
[1:44:34] and her pastor told her she was in a
[1:44:36] witch
[1:44:38] because she was dealing with some kind
[1:44:39] of a nervousness
[1:44:41] that came down from her childhood
[1:44:45] but ram says your preacher told you you
[1:44:47] are in which
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:53] there are things there are things
[1:44:58] there are things that
[1:45:01] that have been engraved in our spirit
[1:45:04] man
[1:45:05] some of those things you don't have
[1:45:07] nothing to do with it
[1:45:09] it came down through the genes of your
[1:45:12] father
[1:45:13] mother family life
[1:45:16] family strange
[1:45:20] praise lord you know the blessing of the
[1:45:23] holy ghost
[1:45:23] is that the holy ghost remove the curse
[1:45:28] that that thing is not a curse to you
[1:45:31] now it becomes a blessing to keep you
[1:45:33] humble
[1:45:39] there's a voice there's a voice
[1:45:42] of one in the wilderness
[1:45:46] that's the reason why we have to keep
[1:45:49] listening
[1:45:50] to that small state voice because
[1:45:52] because he's calling
[1:45:54] in your wilderness he's really calling
[1:45:58] to the real you
[1:46:01] because all of these things that make
[1:46:03] this body
[1:46:04] is not really you
[1:46:07] they have just created a wilderness of
[1:46:10] confusion
[1:46:13] that's why some want to change from man
[1:46:15] to woman from woman to men
[1:46:17] they want to go from black to blue
[1:46:23] it's because they are in a wilderness
[1:46:27] their spirit is in the wilderness they
[1:46:30] take the voice of god
[1:46:33] to go in your wilderness bring
[1:46:37] the low valley up take you from your
[1:46:40] prowl
[1:46:41] and hearty mountain down

[1:46:47] cheating
