[40:21] upon each and every one of us
[40:24] sorry we couldn't
[40:26] make the service on Sunday but we want
[40:28] to thank the Lord that the Holy Ghost
[40:30] was here praise the Lord amen I think
[40:33] brother Stephen was praying and and
[40:36] mentioning the service on Sunday it was
[40:39] brought down there preaching that
[40:40] brother one
[40:42] hey
[40:44] praise the Lord
[40:46] so uh
[40:47] we thank the Lord for that let's take
[40:49] our Bibles in Hebrew chapter four Hebrew
[40:54] chapter 4 we want to just uh
[40:58] take a thought
[41:00] uh Hebrew chapter 4.
[41:04] thank you for your prayers thank you and
[41:16] Hebrew chapter 4 tonight
[41:27] I was on a
[41:30] on a daddy's Duty
[41:32] and that kind of for caught us
[41:35] over there in in Philadelphia but
[41:39] we we had also the privilege to visit
[41:42] with brother Otis in the group there
[41:44] and I spoke with him before we left and
[41:48] I knew he had a visiting preacher so I
[41:51] intentionally never told him I was going
[41:53] to be around
[41:54] because I did not wanted to this you
[41:56] know kind of a structure what they had
[41:59] playing there and uh so
[42:04] when we didn't make our flight in the
[42:06] morning I just called him and then he
[42:08] came to pick us up so he had Brother
[42:11] Francis a young brother from DC
[42:12] preaching there and and it was wonderful
[42:15] it was wonderful for us to be with them
[42:18] so Hebrew chapter four let's read verse
[42:20] 11 and uh
[42:23] 12.
[42:26] let us labor therefore
[42:29] to enter into that rest
[42:33] at least any man fall after the same
[42:37] example of unbelief
[42:39] it's only the word that can bring rest
[42:42] so Paul is going to tell us how we can
[42:45] enter into that rest for the word of God
[42:49] is quick and Powerful
[42:52] and sharper than any two edges swore
[42:56] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[43:00] of the soul and the spirit
[43:04] and of the joints
[43:07] and maroon and it's a descender of the
[43:12] thoughts and the intents
[43:15] of the heart
[43:17] neither is there any creature
[43:21] that is not manifest in his sight
[43:25] but all things are negative and open
[43:28] unto the eyes of him
[43:31] with whom we have to do
[43:35] so the one that we are dealing with
[43:36] tonight nothing is here from him let's
[43:39] ask blessing father we just want to
[43:42] thank you
[43:43] that uh that make you awesome Lord you
[43:47] know where we are tonight you know the
[43:49] thoughts that goes through our mind
[43:52] you know father
[43:53] every bit of our heart tonight
[43:56] father Lord you know our needs
[43:59] and so we pray that Lord God you will
[44:02] just meet us where we are tonight
[44:05] from the pulpit to the peel speak to us
[44:09] out of your word in Jesus name amen amen
[44:13] the Lord bless you you may have your
[44:14] seed
[44:17] so I had this
[44:25] sorry
[44:26] I had this
[44:29] uh had this thought
[44:34] can also put this on
[44:36] after I wore my jacket so I
[44:39] can push through everything up
[44:50] foreign
[45:24] [Music]
[45:32] so I was I was talking about uh
[45:37] uh the fight for Ministry
[45:40] I was I was actually looking at this and
[45:43] I wanted to speak on uh
[45:45] uh the Flaming swallow I was going to
[45:47] talk on the cherubins in the Garden of
[45:50] Eden that was given to wash the way of
[45:53] the treat of life
[45:54] so uh
[45:57] that's the direction I want to go I was
[46:00] actually standing there on
[46:03] Friday night
[46:05] for some reason I couldn't sleep so
[46:08] I was spend some time up studying that
[46:12] so
[46:13] we had that burden in our heart so
[46:16] brother Otis asked that we greet the
[46:18] church so we just have to tell them what
[46:19] was on our heart
[46:21] so I spoke a little bit on that and
[46:23] before the preacher came
[46:25] and so we want to go in that direction
[46:29] tonight but let's go to Hebrew chapter
[46:33] 1.
[46:35] Hebrew chapter one
[46:41] Hebrew chapter 1
[46:44] . now when we were we were looking at
[46:46] this uh we
[46:49] we
[46:52] were talking about the the the angels
[46:56] [Music]
[46:58] we pick up there from the Sun where
[47:01] David said his angels are ministering
[47:04] spirits
[47:05] so Paul used the same thing here but I
[47:08] want for us to look at it I want for us
[47:11] to look at it closely as we read Hebrew
[47:13] chapter 1.
[47:18] Paul said here Hebrew chapter 1 verse 1
[47:21] God who at sundra times and in Davos
[47:26] manner speak in time past unto the
[47:30] fathers by the prophets in Davao manners
[47:34] he used different ways to bring his word
[47:37] to To His prophets praise the Lord in a
[47:40] message I have seen but now I've heard
[47:42] brother Branham say God used Visions God
[47:45] use inspiration God you dreams different
[47:49] ways that he he was able to bring bring
[47:53] the words to the prophets in time pass
[47:56] verse 2.
[47:59] have in these last days spoken unto us
[48:04] by his son
[48:06] praise the Lord
[48:09] whom he have appointed hearers of all
[48:12] things
[48:13] by whom also he made the worst now when
[48:17] you when you look at this
[48:20] and make you and make us as Bible
[48:23] Believers and and and the message
[48:25] Believers it make you to look very
[48:28] closely here because he said in this
[48:30] last day he has spoken to us by his son
[48:34] but he's connecting the song that was
[48:39] made flesh also with the son that
[48:42] created all things in the beginning
[48:47] praise the Lord
[48:48] amen he says whom he have appointed
[48:53] hearers of all things and by whom also
[48:55] he made the worst of the entire universe
[48:59] now so we see here that uh this song
[49:03] that he has spoken to us by
[49:07] when he was Jesus it was the logos made
[49:11] flesh
[49:13] that's what Paul wants for us to pick up
[49:16] here that the same one that spoke the
[49:19] word in existence was the same one that
[49:22] became flesh and it's the same one that
[49:25] is with us tonight
[49:29] praise the Lord
[49:30] amen now Paul is using this Foundation
[49:35] to be a for to be able to help us to see
[49:39] the importance of the word
[49:42] we can never put our gifts or our
[49:45] sensation above the word
[49:51] amen
[49:53] he's helping us for us to be able to see
[49:56] the importance of the word so I wanted
[49:59] because in Hebrew 4 12 he says that word
[50:02] is sharper then two edges for
[50:07] so that's the reason why I came back to
[50:09] this verse so we can see in the Old
[50:12] Testament he used different ways he used
[50:14] different manifestations he spoke
[50:17] through uh the the you spoke with
[50:20] lightly and thunder on the Mountain uh
[50:23] uh uh Moses there was uh you know a
[50:27] burning bulge uh uh concerning the birth
[50:30] of something and enjoy appeared to his
[50:33] parents God used different ways but in
[50:36] this last day
[50:39] his major way is his word
[50:43] praise the Lord
[50:45] so no matter how he speaks to us whether
[50:49] we have a dream or a vision that's the
[50:52] reason why every gift must be brought
[50:54] back to the word
[50:56] no matter how real it sounds if it
[50:59] cannot goes through the word
[51:02] don't have anything to do with it
[51:08] in this last day he has spoken to us by
[51:11] his son
[51:14] now if you are in the tradition you will
[51:16] take it back to to Jesus of Nazareth but
[51:19] that son is still here the revealed word
[51:22] of the hour
[51:26] are we together
[51:28] now so uh I wanted to to establish their
[51:33] first and then
[51:36] uh
[51:47] let's let's read let's read down a
[51:49] little bit it will it will help us here
[51:51] we'll be in the brightness
[51:54] verse 3 of his glory they expressed
[51:57] image of his of his person
[52:00] and ofholding all things by the word of
[52:05] his power when he had by himself porch
[52:10] our sins
[52:12] sit down on the right hand of the
[52:14] majesticid on high
[52:17] be made so much better
[52:20] than the angels
[52:23] as he have by inheritance obtained a
[52:28] more excellent Name than they
[52:32] For unto which are the Angels say he at
[52:37] any time there are my son this day how
[52:40] far begotten thee again I will be to him
[52:45] a father and he shall be to mean a son
[52:50] praise the Lord
[52:54] and again when when he bringeth in the
[52:58] first begotten into the word he said
[53:02] and let all the angels of God worship
[53:06] Him
[53:07] now you see the uh
[53:15] this verse explained what brother
[53:18] Branham shared in question and answer in
[53:20] Genesis where he says that the uh God is
[53:24] an object of worship
[53:26] so when he when he brought the first big
[53:28] Garden which was the logos
[53:32] then the Angels worship the logos and by
[53:35] that God became God because there was an
[53:38] object of worship
[53:40] are we together
[53:43] I'm going somewhere with this
[53:45] and of the angels He said who maketh his
[53:49] Angel spirit and his Minister a flame of
[53:54] fire
[53:55] praise the Lord that's that's where I
[53:57] want to to get with this you go uh
[54:04] uh and of his angels He said we'll
[54:07] maketh his Angel spirit and his ministry
[54:10] the flame of fire now we read back in
[54:14] Genesis chapter 3 word
[54:18] those cherubins to God the treat of life
[54:22] praise the Lord
[54:24] and and that's what we want to we want
[54:27] to uh
[54:30] we want to do it on tonight so yeah
[54:33] there are some things that uh
[54:37] brother Brandon said yeah let me read
[54:39] this one from pagama from pagama's
[54:42] Vision he said talking on Hebrew 4 12
[54:45] the word of God is quick and powerful
[54:48] and sharpered in and in two edges swore
[54:51] piercing even to the dividing the
[54:53] Thunder of the soul and the spirit and
[54:56] of the joints and the marine and it's a
[54:59] descender of the thoughts and the
[55:02] intents of the heart it is the word
[55:06] praise the Lord is the word that does
[55:10] all of that
[55:11] it is performing where
[55:14] onto it
[55:17] was him for it the word
[55:21] is full of power
[55:23] it is the same spirit that was in Jesus
[55:28] the word amen it was the word
[55:33] when he told the the the the the woman
[55:37] at the word you're having five husbands
[55:39] the one you awake it was just the word
[55:43] praise the Lord
[55:44] amen
[55:50] it is the same spirit that was in Jesus
[55:53] the word that is present again in the
[55:57] church in this last age as a last sign
[56:02] trying to hear the people all from
[56:06] joshmen for they they reject him the
[56:10] word are now already come to Josh
[56:13] joshman crucifying him at fresh no so he
[56:17] identified that same gift as a sign that
[56:20] come to the last day Church which of
[56:22] course is the ministry of the son of man
[56:24] that uh the manifested in brother
[56:27] Branham is the word
[56:30] said that word never stop with that son
[56:34] of man Ministry that word was promised
[56:37] to continue with the bride
[56:40] so we still have the gift of discernment
[56:43] not in the one-man Ministry amen anybody
[56:47] trying to do that that would be a
[56:49] impersonation we have the word the word
[56:53] descend our needs
[56:58] are we together
[57:02] the word is the one that discern our
[57:05] needs and minister to the same
[57:09] praise the Lord
[57:11] now so when we look at this uh this this
[57:14] this thing of uh uh uh bringing the the
[57:18] the
[57:20] Cherry beans are the the treat of like
[57:23] brother Branham say this and I want for
[57:26] us to follow it a little bit here
[57:28] because we're talking around the fight
[57:31] for Ministry Ephesian Church age to him
[57:33] that overcome I will give to eat of the
[57:37] treat of life which is in the midst of
[57:40] the paradise of God what a thrilling
[57:43] thought is this the Tree of Life In the
[57:46] Garden of Eden which could not be
[57:49] approached unto because of the fall of
[57:53] Adam is now giving to the Overcomers
[57:56] the Flaming sword
[57:59] of The Guiding cherubim has been shared
[58:06] but it was not shared
[58:09] air is blade was blotted with the blood
[58:13] of the Lamb let us meditate upon this
[58:17] truth
[58:18] the white as we consider why the tree
[58:22] was denied to Adam
[58:25] and his descendants but noun aloud again
[58:29] praise the Lord
[58:31] so we asked yeah we are actually here to
[58:33] meditate but then see when brother
[58:35] Branham came to the resume of the age he
[58:39] said it's also referring back to their
[58:42] same uh uh verse again them that have
[58:46] overcome we eat of the tree of life he
[58:48] says resume of the age he says to him
[58:51] that overcometh will I get to eat of the
[58:55] Tree of Life in the Paradox of God
[58:59] the church
[59:02] already invaded too deeply in too deeply
[59:06] of the tree of death or a denomination
[59:10] of false Vine Wu ends is the Lake of
[59:14] Fire
[59:16] but there I know cherubins with flaming
[59:20] soil to guide the treat of life now
[59:23] God does not now depart from the midst
[59:29] of his church as he departed from eating
[59:33] oh no he will ever be in the midst of
[59:37] his church until the final age
[59:40] and until that time he calls to all to
[59:47] come
[59:49] now so uh if you look at this subject
[59:53] and you look at the two codes that we
[59:55] have just read uh uh year in the resume
[1:00:00] of the age brother Branham is bringing
[1:00:02] this thought up as if uh
[1:00:08] uh with God being in the midst of his
[1:00:11] church we do now have their physical
[1:00:14] manifestation of uh of the Flaming sword
[1:00:18] in one sense what actually it is is uh
[1:00:22] you remember taking on the whole armor
[1:00:26] of God brother Branham says that that
[1:00:28] that those faithful Ministry is God
[1:00:32] dress word
[1:00:33] so if God is in the midst of his church
[1:00:37] you know he embodied the fight for
[1:00:40] Ministry
[1:00:42] praise the Lord
[1:00:43] amen so uh that's that's what he's uh
[1:00:48] he's uh trying to to make us to honest
[1:00:51] him because in the Ephesian Church age
[1:00:54] he says that uh the the the Fleming salt
[1:00:58] what was shaded
[1:01:01] okay
[1:01:04] uh the the cherubins Shaded their
[1:01:07] flaming soil after the the
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:13] sharing of the Lamb's blood he says we
[1:01:16] must meditate on that how God would now
[1:01:19] keep his children away from the treat of
[1:01:21] life but now they are now asked to come
[1:01:25] back to the Tree of Life
[1:01:27] pray to praise the Lord
[1:01:29] amen now we spoke about the cherubins
[1:01:33] and we took them in types of their four
[1:01:36] faces
[1:01:38] and and we said how each one of those
[1:01:42] faces uh take a representation in the
[1:01:46] faithful Ministry
[1:01:48] now so he gave his angels uh uh just
[1:01:53] like uh
[1:01:55] uh his Angel spirit and his ministers
[1:01:58] flames of fire so the fight for Ministry
[1:02:02] now
[1:02:03] plays the role of what the cherubins
[1:02:08] were doing to the treat of life
[1:02:12] praise the Lord
[1:02:13] that's where I want to bring this whole
[1:02:15] talk now that there are faithful
[1:02:17] Ministry they place the role of what the
[1:02:20] cherubim the cherubim that was placed in
[1:02:22] the Garden of Eden was to keep men from
[1:02:25] coming but now on the faithful Ministry
[1:02:28] is to bring them back to the treat of
[1:02:30] life
[1:02:33] are we together not to bring people to
[1:02:36] church but to the truth of life not to
[1:02:39] bring people to themselves but to the
[1:02:41] treat of life
[1:02:43] that is the purpose of the ministry to
[1:02:45] guide the people back to the Tree of
[1:02:48] Life
[1:02:49] praise the Lord now so let's get into
[1:02:52] what we want to talk about a little bit
[1:02:54] tonight if the Lord will allow us to be
[1:02:57] able to explode it now we read here word
[1:03:01] Paul says that the word of God is
[1:03:04] sharper
[1:03:05] than any two edges swore
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:13] praise the Lord
[1:03:14] that the word is sharper
[1:03:17] than ending two edges swore
[1:03:21] when uh when I share this
[1:03:30] let's let's go back a little bit yeah
[1:03:36] let's take some few scriptures here
[1:03:39] Deuteronomy chapter six
[1:03:43] let's read four and five
[1:03:56] praise the Lord
[1:03:59] are we together
[1:04:02] if we will be able to achieve
[1:04:06] what God or deemed to achieve with his
[1:04:11] word I mean with his church or with his
[1:04:13] people we must major on the word nothing
[1:04:16] less than the word
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:19] we can we can we can uh you know uh
[1:04:24] bring uh you know create uh uh
[1:04:28] activities and other programs for the
[1:04:31] church but nothing will be able to
[1:04:33] achieve God's desire for his people than
[1:04:38] the word
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] I mean we can we can have barbecues we
[1:04:45] can we can we can choose to do while uh
[1:04:49] a full shedder and uh you know and and
[1:04:52] and and and put uh you know a kind of a
[1:04:55] tent right by the side of the road and
[1:04:57] decide to feed this community I mean all
[1:04:59] of those things are good
[1:05:01] but there is nothing that will be able
[1:05:03] to achieve God's desire for his church
[1:05:08] and his people than the word
[1:05:12] praise the Lord
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:17] and uh they are there are different
[1:05:20] programs you know uh to help people
[1:05:22] manage anger they are different programs
[1:05:25] to help people marriage relationship
[1:05:28] manage relationship there are different
[1:05:30] programs to help people raise their
[1:05:33] children you know and all of that all of
[1:05:35] those things are wonderful
[1:05:38] praise the Lord
[1:05:40] but let's realize as Believers that uh
[1:05:49] the word of God is the most successful
[1:05:51] thing to use
[1:05:55] praise the Lord
[1:05:57] so Deuteronomy chapter 6 Moses said here
[1:05:59] let's read verse 4 year o Israel the
[1:06:03] Lord our God is one Lord
[1:06:06] and thou shall love the Lord thy God
[1:06:09] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[1:06:12] and with all
[1:06:15] thy might
[1:06:17] praise the Lord and these words which I
[1:06:20] commanded this day
[1:06:22] shall be in thine heart
[1:06:26] are we together
[1:06:29] let's look at Mark chapter 12.
[1:06:31] Mark chapter 12 in the New Testament
[1:06:34] Jesus pick up their very statement of of
[1:06:38] Moses
[1:06:46] Jesus pick up their very statement of
[1:06:49] Moses
[1:06:50] Mark chapter 12
[1:07:02] verse 29 Jesus answered him
[1:07:06] the first of all the commitment is ye o
[1:07:09] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:07:14] and thou shall love the Lord thy God
[1:07:18] with all the heart with all thy sword
[1:07:22] with all thy mind
[1:07:24] and with all that strength this is their
[1:07:28] first commandment praise the Lord now
[1:07:30] when Moses said that he says love the
[1:07:33] Lord with all your heart and with all
[1:07:35] your soul and with all your might
[1:07:39] when Jesus
[1:07:40] speaks of this he introduced another
[1:07:44] element
[1:07:45] which is the mind
[1:07:49] praise the Lord
[1:07:51] Oma in the Book of Romans Paul uses the
[1:07:53] mind and the spirit
[1:07:56] he he he use he uses talking about a
[1:07:59] spirit he will talks about the mind and
[1:08:02] talking about the mind you know he used
[1:08:03] the mind and the spirit so I want for us
[1:08:05] to watch this as we as we look at this
[1:08:08] together and Jeremiah chapter 17.
[1:08:13] Jeremiah chapter 17.
[1:08:19] praise the Lord
[1:08:24] Jeremiah chapter 17. are we together
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:40] Jeremiah chapter 17 this is a verse that
[1:08:43] is very familiar to every one of us
[1:08:54] now Jeremiah 17 does verse 9 9 and 10.
[1:08:58] we're going to look at together the
[1:09:00] heart is
[1:09:02] the heart
[1:09:05] okay
[1:09:07] get caught up with different verses yeah
[1:09:09] the heart is deceitful Above All Things
[1:09:14] and desperately weak it
[1:09:17] who can know it
[1:09:20] are the laws search the heart I try the
[1:09:22] range even
[1:09:24] to give every man according to his ways
[1:09:28] and I call him to the fruit of his doing
[1:09:32] praise the Lord
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:36] now uh when you look at this actually
[1:09:40] when you when you when you said it on
[1:09:42] this verse you will see in a way that
[1:09:44] Jeremiah described the heart here being
[1:09:47] deceitful above all things and
[1:09:51] desperately wicked
[1:09:52] and it means that the heart
[1:09:57] uh
[1:10:00] that word desperately wicked
[1:10:03] means that the heart
[1:10:06] is incurable
[1:10:10] the heart of man is incurable
[1:10:16] praise the Lord
[1:10:18] and you see that's the reason why when
[1:10:20] you look in the scripture God never
[1:10:23] talks about curing the heart he talks
[1:10:25] about I'll give you a new heart
[1:10:33] praise the Lord because the the the the
[1:10:37] the the fall makes our heart
[1:10:40] deceitful above everything
[1:10:43] and desperately wicked
[1:10:47] and moreover who can know it
[1:10:51] praise the Lord
[1:10:54] are we together
[1:10:56] now so uh uh realizing that we are
[1:11:00] caught in their situation we are caught
[1:11:03] at that place that I mean that's that is
[1:11:06] what we are we are born with let me go
[1:11:09] let me go a little further
[1:11:11] uh Matthew chapter 15.
[1:11:15] let me go a little further here
[1:11:17] it will help me to be able to follow my
[1:11:20] thoughts here
[1:11:22] a little bit
[1:11:23] our emphasis here is making the word
[1:11:26] having the preeminence we can you can
[1:11:29] follow your thoughts
[1:11:31] praise the lord we must follow the word
[1:11:33] you can follow your feelings we must
[1:11:35] follow the word amen
[1:11:39] is only the word that can deliver us
[1:11:42] your feelings can lie to you your
[1:11:45] thoughts can also lie to you if it is
[1:11:48] not in line with the word
[1:11:50] now uh
[1:11:59] now Jesus said here I'll just read verse
[1:12:02] 19. uh he says out of the heart proceed
[1:12:07] evil talks
[1:12:09] murder
[1:12:11] adultery fornication teeth false witness
[1:12:14] blaspheming out of the heart proceed out
[1:12:17] of there when you when you look at that
[1:12:19] carefully it helps us to be able to see
[1:12:22] you see there are some of the things
[1:12:24] that that will that makes us to really
[1:12:26] appreciate uh the son of man Ministry
[1:12:30] because with what Jesus said here out of
[1:12:33] the heart proceed evil thought and it
[1:12:36] proceed all of these evil things then we
[1:12:38] realize that the heart that the Bible is
[1:12:41] talking about for us to love the Lord
[1:12:44] with all of our heart it is not this
[1:12:46] muscle that pumps our blood
[1:12:52] because if it is this muscle then the
[1:12:55] doctors that work on heart must be able
[1:12:57] to take evil thoughts
[1:13:02] praise the Lord they must be able to go
[1:13:05] in there
[1:13:06] and take evil thoughts and and you know
[1:13:09] and take all of these things uh thieves
[1:13:13] and false witness and all of these
[1:13:15] things that Jesus said that proceed out
[1:13:17] of their heart they must be able to to
[1:13:20] operate us and take it from that
[1:13:24] praise the Lord
[1:13:25] but let's let's read something here of
[1:13:27] brother Branham
[1:13:35] second coming of the Lord
[1:13:40] amen I wish of course we are all
[1:13:42] familiar with he says when it said that
[1:13:45] you know God said as a man thinking in
[1:13:48] his heart the scripture say out of the
[1:13:50] heart
[1:13:52] this the scientists said that God got
[1:13:56] everything mix up
[1:13:58] there was no mental faculty in the heart
[1:14:02] to think with
[1:14:04] he has to think with his mind
[1:14:08] his mind was the only thing
[1:14:11] that he could think of
[1:14:14] and that was his heart with his mind but
[1:14:19] God just made a mistake
[1:14:23] when he said heart
[1:14:28] heart when he said heart he means heart
[1:14:33] praise the Lord
[1:14:35] I want to be able to say this one I'm
[1:14:37] just I'm just reading in in my mind is
[1:14:40] not together
[1:14:43] when he said heart he means hot
[1:14:46] a few weeks a few weeks ago Medical
[1:14:50] Science found that in the center of the
[1:14:54] heart is a tiny little place
[1:14:58] that doesn't have blood cells or
[1:15:01] anything around it
[1:15:04] and they claim medical science claim
[1:15:07] it is is their occupation of the Soul
[1:15:13] animal doesn't have it
[1:15:17] so after all God was right man things
[1:15:22] with his heart
[1:15:24] now so yeah brother Brandon now making
[1:15:27] us succeed that even signs us realized
[1:15:31] that uh there is a compartment in the
[1:15:34] human heart where blood do not go
[1:15:37] now so he's he's making us to be able to
[1:15:41] see that uh uh that place
[1:15:45] it's a special place
[1:15:47] that place is uh uh the the where the
[1:15:53] sword of man is he said where men think
[1:15:56] it from
[1:15:58] praise the Lord
[1:15:59] amen
[1:16:01] amen now we get back to what the Apostle
[1:16:04] Paul says the word of God is sharper
[1:16:07] than any two edges swore
[1:16:11] and it goes
[1:16:13] to it it uh it goes to the he says and
[1:16:18] it's piercing even to their divided
[1:16:21] asunder of the spirit and the Soul what
[1:16:26] does that mean
[1:16:28] praise the Lord
[1:16:30] and tore the joints and the marriage and
[1:16:33] is at the center of the thoughts and the
[1:16:36] intents of our heart
[1:16:39] praise the Lord that's just how powerful
[1:16:42] the word that we sit under is
[1:16:45] when we realize that our mind is not our
[1:16:49] brain
[1:16:52] that compartment there where blood do
[1:16:56] not goes to the word gets into that
[1:16:59] compartment and is is able to be able to
[1:17:03] tell your spirit Reign and is able to
[1:17:06] tell your soul Raymond you know and
[1:17:08] brother Branham will go back to tell us
[1:17:10] about our subconscious and and and all
[1:17:14] of that
[1:17:18] praise the Lord
[1:17:21] we shall cause over and over he make us
[1:17:24] to realize that that is what the real U
[1:17:28] is that's where the word is is is is
[1:17:31] designed and predestined to deal with
[1:17:35] you
[1:17:37] praise the Lord
[1:17:38] this body that we have that is you know
[1:17:41] that is made out of uh you know James
[1:17:44] from our father our mother that runs
[1:17:46] down from our grandparents you know we
[1:17:49] we are just caught up in this body
[1:17:52] and there are a lot of things that we
[1:17:54] deal with in this body
[1:17:56] praise the Lord Thou Art against us he
[1:17:59] says the Apostle Paul again says you
[1:18:01] know when oh who will deliver me from
[1:18:03] this Wretched Man that I am
[1:18:06] praise the Lord
[1:18:08] because he's he's now realizing he's now
[1:18:12] realizing how much he have trained
[1:18:15] himself to follow the law to follow the
[1:18:19] tradition of his father
[1:18:21] praise the Lord and how he have
[1:18:24] disciplined himself you know what to
[1:18:26] keep the word to live by the message
[1:18:30] but he will also realizing that he kept
[1:18:34] coming short
[1:18:35] of their zeal he kept coming short of
[1:18:39] that desire
[1:18:41] praise the Lord
[1:18:45] and after being saved and and and being
[1:18:48] converted by the Holy Ghost he realized
[1:18:50] that there was a new work that was
[1:18:52] taking place from within
[1:18:56] praise the Lord with everything that he
[1:18:59] knew about the Lord and everything he
[1:19:01] knew about the word but there was uh uh
[1:19:04] uh uh uh a desire a longing in his heart
[1:19:09] even though his his flesh was filling
[1:19:12] him his mind was filling him and and
[1:19:14] then he couldn't even see better with
[1:19:16] his eyes after that experience but in
[1:19:19] his heart
[1:19:21] praise the Lord
[1:19:25] there was this longing
[1:19:29] are we together
[1:19:32] now so you see the the the the the very
[1:19:35] there is the responsibility
[1:19:37] of the ministry
[1:19:41] if we if we if we if we just sit down
[1:19:45] and realize that is to make sure you see
[1:19:47] that's the reason why this word must not
[1:19:50] be mixed with nothing
[1:19:52] because it's only the word and the word
[1:19:55] alone that can goes in that channel
[1:20:00] praise the Lord amen
[1:20:02] while telling somebody you know you know
[1:20:05] you know your parents used to serve the
[1:20:08] Lord your you know and and just plain on
[1:20:10] their emotion you can make them feel
[1:20:12] sorry for you can just do it in their
[1:20:14] Spirit Room but it will never be able to
[1:20:17] address
[1:20:18] the situation in their soul
[1:20:24] praise the Lord
[1:20:27] the purpose of the word is to be able to
[1:20:29] address that compartment whatever is in
[1:20:32] that compartment
[1:20:37] praise the Lord
[1:20:39] that's the purpose of the word
[1:20:42] that's where the word is aiming at
[1:20:48] are we together
[1:20:50] and then if if we are laboring together
[1:20:53] as he have called us to be laborers with
[1:20:57] him
[1:20:58] that is the place that we must be
[1:20:59] focusing on also
[1:21:05] that is the place where we must be
[1:21:07] focusing on that is the place where the
[1:21:10] image of Christ is built
[1:21:13] because the image of Christ is built by
[1:21:16] the word
[1:21:22] are we to together now so you see the
[1:21:25] thing about it there is the other that's
[1:21:28] the reason why Paul says that you know
[1:21:30] I've not come with enticing words of men
[1:21:33] wisdom
[1:21:35] I've come preached the gospel with the
[1:21:38] the demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:42] he was he warned us against uh you know
[1:21:45] uh uh preaching psychology
[1:21:50] praise the Lord
[1:21:54] and what psychology would do that I mean
[1:21:56] they would just they would just wash
[1:21:58] your life parting wash the things you
[1:22:00] eat and you know when you wake up and
[1:22:02] you know how your mood is in the morning
[1:22:05] and and how your mood is in the
[1:22:07] afternoon and you know all of those
[1:22:09] things they will steady and uh you know
[1:22:11] God has blessed people in that area they
[1:22:14] have been able to help people but you
[1:22:16] see it does not bring
[1:22:18] conviction it does not bring the the
[1:22:21] body change
[1:22:24] the only thing that is designed to bring
[1:22:26] the body change the only thing that is
[1:22:28] designed to give us the overcoming power
[1:22:31] is the word
[1:22:36] praise the Lord
[1:22:37] psychology is not it's not a design
[1:22:41] praise the Lord
[1:22:43] you see and it put lot of responsibility
[1:22:47] on the ministry to know what is the word
[1:22:50] of the hour
[1:22:52] what do we need to be feeding on
[1:22:58] praise the Lord
[1:23:06] and we must bring the world we must we
[1:23:08] must you know uh put the you know the
[1:23:10] the bride the church right into into the
[1:23:14] the message of the hour
[1:23:18] that's where rapturing faith is
[1:23:29] it is not I mean just to make us happy
[1:23:31] or just to preach and make the church
[1:23:33] sign no we must be able to put the
[1:23:36] church right in the word
[1:23:42] because it is him with whom we have to
[1:23:46] do
[1:23:48] it is him that we have to deal with
[1:23:53] praise the Lord
[1:23:58] there are uh uh an individual uh you
[1:24:03] know frustration look at this look at
[1:24:05] this also let me read this to you
[1:24:08] getting close to uh close enough yeah
[1:24:11] Birmingham share this in the message
[1:24:12] revealing God revealing himself to his
[1:24:15] people he says now this is not mentor
[1:24:21] telepod and neither is this neither is
[1:24:24] it's psychology
[1:24:26] Peter said at the gate of beautiful
[1:24:30] to the man that sat there he says look
[1:24:34] on us
[1:24:36] is that right Jesus told the woman
[1:24:40] said bring me a drink
[1:24:43] he got in contact with her
[1:24:47] Paul why he was preaching he said to the
[1:24:51] man said I perceive that you have faith
[1:24:55] to be healed
[1:24:56] is that right then it is in Psychology
[1:24:59] is the power of God so what the brother
[1:25:02] Branham is talking about yeah Peter said
[1:25:04] look on us making contact the word must
[1:25:08] make contact that's where it takes
[1:25:11] effect
[1:25:15] praise the Lord
[1:25:17] all the preacher will carry out all his
[1:25:19] emotion he will be shouting he will be
[1:25:22] you know jumping up of everything he's
[1:25:23] doing he's just trying to get your
[1:25:25] attention so the word can take contact
[1:25:30] so the world can be able to nail right
[1:25:33] to that place what they want to address
[1:25:35] in our life
[1:25:43] praise the Lord
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:55] and I mean I mean just like uh uh just
[1:26:00] like the woman or the word that says sir
[1:26:03] I perceive that you are a prophet the
[1:26:05] word took contact what did he do
[1:26:06] equipping her
[1:26:08] amen a quick in her and and and and you
[1:26:12] experience that when the world take
[1:26:14] contact you says wow yeah that word is
[1:26:16] is spoke directly to me the word pick up
[1:26:20] something in uh not just you know uh uh
[1:26:23] you know in in enjoying the majority of
[1:26:26] everything the preacher is saying but
[1:26:28] how the word address things in our life
[1:26:30] now most of the time it's not just the
[1:26:34] sense of telling you things that you are
[1:26:36] doing wrong that's not the only work of
[1:26:39] the word
[1:26:40] but the word comes also to be able to
[1:26:44] take you sometimes from tradition when
[1:26:46] you do you you have established a way of
[1:26:49] doing things and you think that is the
[1:26:51] way and the word comes in and you see it
[1:26:53] in the world wow
[1:26:56] it brings correction
[1:26:58] the word corrects the error
[1:27:04] are we together
[1:27:07] that's how it makes contact that's when
[1:27:10] it's a blessing when it makes contact
[1:27:15] open your understanding
[1:27:19] praise the Lord
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] I mean I mean just like was that last
[1:27:27] week also yet last week Wednesday we we
[1:27:30] rarely cooked there better brand was
[1:27:31] talking about that woman you know uh
[1:27:34] that he that he knew she had the Holy
[1:27:36] Ghost
[1:27:37] you know but uh uh just to be able to
[1:27:42] give her their self-confidence brother
[1:27:44] Branham says I pray Lord that you allow
[1:27:46] her to speak in tongues
[1:27:51] praise the Lord
[1:27:52] because you want to Psalm some athlete
[1:27:55] manifestation she wanted some kind of a
[1:27:58] manifestation
[1:27:59] to be able to Anchor her faith
[1:28:03] praise the Lord
[1:28:05] I was following the service on Sunday
[1:28:08] I mean brother
[1:28:10] Dan preaching did on uh where he found
[1:28:13] faith
[1:28:14] what was running through my mind as I
[1:28:17] was listening I said you know what uh
[1:28:19] Jesus knowing the time that we will be
[1:28:22] leaving him
[1:28:24] praise the Lord
[1:28:26] and some of the elements of this time
[1:28:28] that we are living in is that uh what
[1:28:31] our trouble is there are a lot of things
[1:28:33] of the age that is creating fear
[1:28:36] there are a lot of things of the age
[1:28:38] also that there is there is there is
[1:28:40] never a time where we have fats
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:48] being an Information Age it has given us
[1:28:51] a lot of facts
[1:28:55] praise the Lord
[1:28:56] so this is an age that is driven with
[1:28:59] fats
[1:29:01] feared
[1:29:03] and faith
[1:29:07] praise the Lord
[1:29:10] I mean just just say something people
[1:29:12] just take out their phone they go and
[1:29:14] check it up and see if it's fat
[1:29:17] is an Information Age we are driving
[1:29:20] people live their life out of fats
[1:29:23] it's not true I don't believe it they
[1:29:25] just they just send it through the
[1:29:27] window
[1:29:28] amen because they cannot find no
[1:29:31] information on it
[1:29:37] and another spirit that is driven The
[1:29:39] Edge is a spirit of fear
[1:29:42] we are living in a time of uncertainty
[1:29:46] the world is changing rapidly in a way
[1:29:48] that oh wow
[1:29:51] I mean the middle of August we have a
[1:29:53] rainstorm
[1:30:00] praise the Lord
[1:30:03] I was just thinking about that our law
[1:30:06] knew exactly what we will be dealing
[1:30:08] with
[1:30:09] he knew exactly the time the spirit that
[1:30:12] will be dominated in our age
[1:30:18] praise the Lord
[1:30:22] oh yeah I mean
[1:30:24] back there the people uh I mean it was
[1:30:28] it was a treasure to have the word of
[1:30:30] God now we can have 15 different
[1:30:32] translations on our phones
[1:30:36] it was such a treasure such a treasure
[1:30:39] to to have the word and many of them did
[1:30:41] not even have a uh have a Bible it was
[1:30:43] just if they had a confidence in a man
[1:30:45] whatever the man says they hang their
[1:30:47] soul onto it
[1:30:51] praise the Lord
[1:30:52] but it's not like that now we're having
[1:30:54] we have in the Bible every word we have
[1:30:57] the message we can go and search out
[1:30:59] what are you telling us what the
[1:31:00] prophecy on that
[1:31:04] which is a good thing
[1:31:07] but that's not what we are called to
[1:31:09] base our walk on
[1:31:12] amen sons of God Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:16] God are led by the spirit
[1:31:20] and we are called to live a life of
[1:31:23] faith
[1:31:26] praise the Lord
[1:31:27] our faith in God's in God's word in
[1:31:31] God's promised word must be above
[1:31:35] everything we know that is fats
[1:31:40] praise the Lord
[1:31:42] amen because even if you take you take
[1:31:45] some some uh some health situations
[1:31:48] that we go through
[1:31:50] I mean you go to see the doctor the
[1:31:52] doctor give you his report everything he
[1:31:54] says it's a fact
[1:31:57] praise the Lord but Fox will not bring
[1:32:00] will not bring healing
[1:32:04] it's faith in God's word that will bring
[1:32:06] healing
[1:32:09] praise the Lord
[1:32:11] amen but sometimes for us to be able to
[1:32:14] to to step up to that place of of uh of
[1:32:18] of faith and and take God God I'm
[1:32:20] standing on your promise I'm holding to
[1:32:22] your word sometimes we need to
[1:32:24] understand what is going on with the
[1:32:26] body
[1:32:30] are we together
[1:32:31] brother bam says if if if
[1:32:34] a man was was was condemned to die he
[1:32:39] was sentenced to die he will be hanged
[1:32:41] tomorrow morning
[1:32:43] he says I mean there's there is nothing
[1:32:45] that fear will do fear will kill him
[1:32:47] before even he think
[1:32:50] fear will kill him before even death
[1:32:52] reach him
[1:32:53] he says but faith can change the
[1:32:55] situation
[1:33:02] praise the Lord faith can change the
[1:33:04] situation
[1:33:11] I mean that is the time that we are
[1:33:13] living that is the spirit that is
[1:33:14] dominating the age whether you like it
[1:33:17] or not we all we go in and out of it
[1:33:21] we like to prove things we would like to
[1:33:24] make sure the information is truth
[1:33:27] I would like to gather truth on these
[1:33:29] things
[1:33:32] but our walk with God must not be driven
[1:33:35] by those things
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] we believe in a God that can change
[1:33:41] situation
[1:33:43] we'll be living the god that can heal
[1:33:45] the sake
[1:33:46] amen we believe in a god that is that is
[1:33:49] among his people
[1:33:58] are we together
[1:34:02] I believe that's what I better brand I'm
[1:34:04] addressed here he says uh uh we read
[1:34:07] that before then in the
[1:34:09] the resume of the age he says that the
[1:34:12] the church already
[1:34:15] embedded too deep on the tree of death
[1:34:18] you know the false bind denomination
[1:34:21] whose ends is in the Lake of Fire but
[1:34:24] there are no cherubins with flaming soil
[1:34:27] to guide to the to the tree of life now
[1:34:29] why because God is in the midst of his
[1:34:31] church and he's not going to leave
[1:34:38] praise the Lord
[1:34:42] so if you just you just think about that
[1:34:45] you know that he's in the midst of his
[1:34:48] church
[1:34:49] and he's not going to leave
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:54] he gave us all of these gifts and the
[1:34:57] sole purpose of it is to lead us back
[1:35:00] into his presence
[1:35:05] that's the sole purpose of it is to lead
[1:35:08] us right back into his presence
[1:35:13] so you think about that again you know
[1:35:15] uh uh I mean we we we go with we we go
[1:35:19] through different things I mean there
[1:35:21] there's there are some things you you
[1:35:23] you you take an even through it of
[1:35:25] yourself you see uh uh uh uh things that
[1:35:30] your body is going through and and
[1:35:32] things your mind is going through we
[1:35:34] must be able to bring all of those
[1:35:37] things on a suggestion to the word
[1:35:41] you must be able to bring all of those
[1:35:44] things your feelings your fear bring
[1:35:47] everything to what God is doing in that
[1:35:50] little compartment in your heart
[1:35:53] praise the Lord if you believe that God
[1:35:55] is dealing with you you believe that
[1:35:57] he's speaking to you you believe that
[1:36:00] he's changing your life then whatever
[1:36:02] you are going through you have to bring
[1:36:03] it to that place
[1:36:06] you have to bring it to that place
[1:36:10] because that is the place where the word
[1:36:12] is going the word is not the word the
[1:36:15] word is not going to uh uh is is not is
[1:36:18] not coming to your feelings
[1:36:20] is not coming is going to that place
[1:36:25] is sharper than the two-edges sword and
[1:36:28] even if look at the beautiful thing that
[1:36:30] Paul says here even to the joints and
[1:36:33] the marrow it goes right down there and
[1:36:36] then it's even distributed to bring
[1:36:38] healing to our body
[1:36:42] when a word is received in that
[1:36:44] compartment it goes every word in our
[1:36:47] body where we need healing the word
[1:36:49] address it
[1:36:53] where we need cleansing the word address
[1:36:55] it
[1:36:56] where we need to re-address our thought
[1:36:59] the word address it
[1:37:02] you see but when a person you if you are
[1:37:04] just taking the word from a place of
[1:37:06] reasoning
[1:37:09] praise the Lord
[1:37:11] you will just think your mind will just
[1:37:13] go your mouth would just go but you will
[1:37:15] not get the effect of the word
[1:37:19] but when a person is receiving the word
[1:37:22] speak to me Lord
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:27] that's the reason why sometimes we sit
[1:37:29] on a year in the word and uh I mean you
[1:37:32] you hear the word you receive the word
[1:37:34] and and then sometimes uh uh uh in a
[1:37:38] week something from the word that you
[1:37:41] have received just speaks to you
[1:37:45] amen and just come back to your mind and
[1:37:48] it stays on your mind for a while say oh
[1:37:50] wow
[1:37:52] oh wow yeah oh I see why oh okay I
[1:37:55] understand that's what he was talking
[1:37:57] about
[1:38:02] are we together
[1:38:05] you see this this particular verse in
[1:38:08] the Bible
[1:38:10] it really destroyed the psychology
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:19] psychology might be able to talk and
[1:38:21] help people in human behavior
[1:38:25] but to be able to bring a solution
[1:38:28] to be able to bring healing and
[1:38:30] deliverance
[1:38:32] when it comes back the word
[1:38:38] praise the Lord
[1:38:41] the word goes straight to that
[1:38:42] compartment it castings away from our
[1:38:45] spirit
[1:38:49] the word receive in that compartment of
[1:38:52] our soul it create more love in your
[1:38:56] heart for God
[1:38:58] it brings your body subject it puts your
[1:39:01] soul in uh uh uh uh
[1:39:06] in more fellowship with God
[1:39:12] praise the Lord
[1:39:16] he want to make contact
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] the world want to make contact
[1:39:26] I listened to brother Branham he says he
[1:39:29] says over rubber was good
[1:39:31] he said over rubber will tell the people
[1:39:33] you know he had a television program he
[1:39:36] says he said make contact put your hand
[1:39:38] on television
[1:39:42] he says oh yeah if you have in your
[1:39:43] Bible there just just put your hand on
[1:39:45] your Bible or or whole whole hands
[1:39:50] he said but he didn't get it
[1:39:54] you know he didn't get it
[1:39:57] that was his way of trying to help the
[1:40:00] people to make contact with the word
[1:40:05] claiming faith for their healing
[1:40:08] praise the Lord
[1:40:13] by the way that God designed for his
[1:40:16] word to make contact with us
[1:40:19] is a word going to that dividing the
[1:40:22] sunder
[1:40:23] of our soul and our spirit
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:28] even at the center of our thoughts
[1:40:31] the intents of our heart
[1:40:35] praise the Lord
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:39] the brother Graham says the nine the
[1:40:41] nine uh
[1:40:43] fruits of the spirit he says you cannot
[1:40:46] go to any address to Walgreens or CVS
[1:40:51] and and be able to buy Loft and and be
[1:40:54] able to buy all of these all of these
[1:40:56] fruit of the spirit
[1:40:57] you see so it brings us to the place
[1:41:00] where we have to realize
[1:41:03] there is something big you know the
[1:41:05] prophet of God will say is that you can
[1:41:07] create another word and go and live on
[1:41:10] it
[1:41:13] praise the Lord
[1:41:15] amen there is something if if a Son of
[1:41:19] God or that or a daughter of God God can
[1:41:21] just get us to be able to to uh uh uh
[1:41:26] you know understand the way he's dealing
[1:41:28] with us and know that you know this is
[1:41:31] is far beyond of everything our our
[1:41:35] senses is is reflecting to us
[1:41:39] most of the time we are caught up in our
[1:41:41] senses
[1:41:43] praise the Lord
[1:41:45] but God has not given us the spirit of
[1:41:47] fear
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:50] he have not given us the spirit of fear
[1:41:53] he had given us assignment but let me
[1:41:55] ask you a question don't you feel afraid
[1:41:58] yeah you do feel afraid why it's your
[1:42:00] body it's your five senses
[1:42:02] where God has not given you a spirit of
[1:42:05] fear is that it's in that little
[1:42:07] compartment there is no fear that the
[1:42:09] words there
[1:42:12] is the place where he's dealing with you
[1:42:19] your mind
[1:42:21] but when God get a hold of your heart
[1:42:23] and you are able to Center your mind on
[1:42:26] him you realize the fear just go away
[1:42:30] you will always have a sense of fear in
[1:42:33] this body your five senses will always
[1:42:35] speak fear to you
[1:42:38] but when it comes to that little
[1:42:40] compartment
[1:42:41] fear does not worry
[1:42:45] praise the Lord
[1:42:50] are we together
[1:42:54] that's the reason why it's it's it's
[1:42:56] major on the word
[1:42:58] bringing us back to the Tree of Life
[1:43:02] it's not just uh you know uh uh because
[1:43:06] that's that's the place where Adam was
[1:43:11] he was dealing with God from from a
[1:43:14] realm where he never knew fear he did
[1:43:17] not new doubt
[1:43:19] he never even knew he was naked
[1:43:22] you think about it he's naked he never
[1:43:25] knew where was he dealing with God from
[1:43:27] not from the body
[1:43:33] speaking things into existence and
[1:43:35] calling this mountain I don't want
[1:43:36] naming the animals and grabbing the
[1:43:39] thought of God and manifesting it he was
[1:43:41] not dealing with God from this body
[1:43:46] he was living in such a realm that that
[1:43:49] lifted him above everything his body was
[1:43:53] going through
[1:43:56] praise the Lord
[1:44:03] so that's where the word is supposed to
[1:44:05] bring us
[1:44:07] praise the Lord
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] that's where the word is supposed to
[1:44:13] bring us
[1:44:15] Jesus in his day he cried to the people
[1:44:18] it's nine o'clock I'll leave you here he
[1:44:20] cried to the people he says uh you know
[1:44:23] how how they have turned to the
[1:44:25] traditions of men
[1:44:27] turn the Commandments to the traditions
[1:44:29] of men
[1:44:31] the word that was supposed to be
[1:44:32] changing the people they have made forms
[1:44:35] out of it and the Word was losing its
[1:44:38] effect
[1:44:41] because we were we we were we were we
[1:44:43] were paying more attention to addressing
[1:44:46] people emotions
[1:44:48] people feeling
[1:44:50] oh I don't feel good about it okay let's
[1:44:52] do something about it yeah this sister
[1:44:54] don't feel good about this thing in the
[1:44:55] church so let's do the other person come
[1:44:57] with their own a feeling let's do it I
[1:44:59] mean we will have a mess
[1:45:02] let's stay with the word
[1:45:05] let's make the world happen
[1:45:08] let's look for the word to be manifested
[1:45:10] in our midst
[1:45:12] let the word brings Joy To Us
[1:45:16] amen we will not work out ourselves to
[1:45:19] let the world let them let us preaching
[1:45:21] of the word Rejoice our hearts
[1:45:32] are we together
[1:45:34] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:45:37] amen
[1:45:39] and Moses said love the Lord with all of
[1:45:42] your strength
[1:45:44] how can you put that strength into it
[1:45:46] the word has to give you the strength
[1:45:51] praise the Lord
[1:45:52] like uh no brother Stephen preach
[1:45:54] praying tonight and he says you know uh
[1:45:58] you know many of us who would not like
[1:46:00] to be yet you know and coming from work
[1:46:02] we are tired and but that word knowing
[1:46:05] that we kept you coming to Fellowship
[1:46:06] from that room something kicks in you it
[1:46:10] gives you a joy I want to be in church
[1:46:12] tonight
[1:46:15] if it is just the senses of the body I
[1:46:18] mean you I mean everybody would like to
[1:46:20] have the Wednesday off
[1:46:24] and we just make a Sunday service
[1:46:29] praise the Lord
[1:46:32] I mean even the ones that can that can
[1:46:34] make it and and and tuning into the
[1:46:36] service I mean it takes some kind of for
[1:46:39] joy of the word
[1:46:42] it takes a joy it takes a desire of the
[1:46:46] word it takes a strength that comes from
[1:46:49] within
[1:46:54] that's part of how your body feels
[1:46:58] but the moment you you you you give into
[1:47:01] that
[1:47:05] it turns on
[1:47:07] it takes over the weakness of your body
[1:47:10] praise the Lord your mind is set for
[1:47:12] church your strength is coming I want to
[1:47:15] be in service I'm going to church
[1:47:20] praise the Lord
[1:47:23] how close with this I I know I know of a
[1:47:26] sister
[1:47:27] many years ago very lovely sister her
[1:47:29] husband believed the message and and she
[1:47:32] was not a Believer she was a Catholic
[1:47:35] and uh
[1:47:37] uh
[1:47:38] you know he was he was he was he was a
[1:47:41] man of a varied uh
[1:47:45] #he was a diplomat and then uh you know
[1:47:49] he would go to church and and uh
[1:47:54] you know she will she will always be
[1:47:56] wondering you know I mean
[1:48:00] you know I mean I mean why he's just
[1:48:03] he's so dedicated to water
[1:48:06] uh you know and but then she was finding
[1:48:09] her way
[1:48:10] to be uh I mean when he's around she
[1:48:12] don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:48:13] the message when he's not around then
[1:48:16] she found her way to be able to read
[1:48:18] what is in this thing that he's really
[1:48:20] reading
[1:48:21] you know and you should go as you read
[1:48:24] the message you know
[1:48:25] it's not making sense to harden you know
[1:48:27] and on and on
[1:48:30] and then one day
[1:48:33] uh
[1:48:35] one of the things that were bothering
[1:48:37] her was was in a way that uh you know uh
[1:48:41] uh you know Mary was there with you know
[1:48:45] the the way that the Catholic Church put
[1:48:48] a lot of reverence on Merit you know the
[1:48:50] mother of God the Holy Mary and all of
[1:48:52] that you know and the way message
[1:48:55] Believers would talk about you know her
[1:48:57] husband was a preacher too you know he
[1:49:00] became a preacher leader and the way he
[1:49:03] would talk about married and I mean she
[1:49:05] just couldn't stand it you know so she
[1:49:08] said one day she was just there
[1:49:11] and the thought hit her hit her mind and
[1:49:15] uh
[1:49:16] uh and
[1:49:20] it it kind of addressed this whole thing
[1:49:23] about about this the merry subject in
[1:49:25] her mind that uh uh that's a beautiful
[1:49:28] beautiful way that she said it I can I
[1:49:30] can be able to remember a word for word
[1:49:32] but it was more like uh
[1:49:36] no matter how we think about Mary and no
[1:49:39] matter how people what they say about
[1:49:41] Mary it does not change what the actual
[1:49:44] you know young virgin wants you know in
[1:49:47] in their sense whether we are making too
[1:49:50] much of her or whether people are trying
[1:49:52] to degrade her it does not change what
[1:49:54] she wants you know she was what she was
[1:49:58] you know so she said that that thing
[1:50:00] just changed her mind so one day her
[1:50:03] husband is going to church and and he
[1:50:05] got read it and then you know he he uh
[1:50:08] he uh and and she she playing secretly
[1:50:11] that she was going to join him and never
[1:50:13] told him that she was going to join him
[1:50:15] but he got ready knowing that his wife
[1:50:17] would stay home or you know uh do her
[1:50:20] just get in her place and just do her
[1:50:22] sign of the cross and do her Catholic
[1:50:24] prayer and all of that he got ready and
[1:50:28] uh
[1:50:29] and he says as soon as he drove he got
[1:50:31] to the to the security gate he called
[1:50:33] the the wife called the security and
[1:50:35] tell and tell them to stop her husband
[1:50:38] and uh
[1:50:41] they stopped stopping he says oh your
[1:50:43] wife said you should come back so he was
[1:50:45] wondering why oh I wonder what happened
[1:50:47] you know he ran back quickly thinking
[1:50:49] that maybe she was not well or so and
[1:50:51] that's when he got back up she says I'm
[1:50:52] going to church with you
[1:50:54] I mean that was the biggest shock in his
[1:50:56] life
[1:50:57] okay
[1:51:00] praise the Lord
[1:51:02] but what happened was there the because
[1:51:05] she was reading the word
[1:51:09] she was reading the word
[1:51:11] the word was able to find her
[1:51:16] praise the Lord the word was able to
[1:51:18] find her another another testimony there
[1:51:22] is the other
[1:51:23] uh a brother there over in uh
[1:51:28] uh
[1:51:29] uh Alabama
[1:51:32] he took a seven Church age book and he
[1:51:34] told a friend of his I think it was a
[1:51:37] Baptist preacher but a denomination of
[1:51:38] preacher he says stick this book
[1:51:41] if you will read this book
[1:51:45] if you will read this book
[1:51:47] and just apply what
[1:51:52] this book is saying your church will
[1:51:54] grow
[1:51:58] praise the Lord he said if you would
[1:52:00] just read this book The Seven Church
[1:52:02] ages give it to the to the man and say
[1:52:04] if you would just read this book and
[1:52:07] just apply what is in the book your
[1:52:10] church will grow
[1:52:12] so he said that the gentleman took took
[1:52:15] the book from him their seventh Church
[1:52:16] age book and he went and started reading
[1:52:18] the book and you know and he's oh wow
[1:52:21] you know and it's I mean he's he's
[1:52:24] coming to the pulpit and he's he's
[1:52:26] preaching what is in the book
[1:52:29] praise the Lord
[1:52:30] and grow not only in the sense of
[1:52:35] Amiga Church
[1:52:37] but the people started growing in the
[1:52:40] word
[1:52:41] they started having desire to go back
[1:52:43] and look in the scripture and see what
[1:52:46] he was saying
[1:52:48] they didn't know why he was getting it
[1:52:50] from but whatever he was saying it was
[1:52:51] scriptural
[1:52:55] praise the Lord so you see the word has
[1:52:58] the power to do its work
[1:53:04] it has its power to do his work
[1:53:08] praise the Lord
[1:53:10] and he came back and met the brother and
[1:53:13] said and says I I don't know what's
[1:53:15] happening but exactly what you said is
[1:53:17] happening my people beginning to respond
[1:53:20] to the word
[1:53:22] I beginning to feel the effect of my
[1:53:25] preaching in church
[1:53:31] because the word has the power
[1:53:36] to change our life
[1:53:39] praise the Lord if we will just take the
[1:53:42] word and apply it to our our situation
[1:53:45] we will get a positive result
[1:53:49] amen a word that was in chaos and
[1:53:53] darkness all God had to do was speak his
[1:53:56] word let there be light and there was
[1:53:59] light
[1:54:01] and that word was able to bring an Eden
[1:54:04] it was able to bring an author in the
[1:54:07] midst of Chaos
[1:54:10] when we start to take our thoughts and
[1:54:13] our desire the way we want things above
[1:54:16] the world
[1:54:18] the way we think things should be above
[1:54:21] the word
[1:54:26] praise the Lord you are just hanging
[1:54:28] yourself for a great fall
[1:54:32] because you hold to that thought you
[1:54:34] hold to that thought the day it does not
[1:54:37] manifest you're going to fall
[1:54:41] because God is not obligated to our
[1:54:43] thoughts he's not obligated to our
[1:54:46] feelings he's not obligated to your fear
[1:54:49] God is obligated to his word
[1:54:57] praise the Lord
