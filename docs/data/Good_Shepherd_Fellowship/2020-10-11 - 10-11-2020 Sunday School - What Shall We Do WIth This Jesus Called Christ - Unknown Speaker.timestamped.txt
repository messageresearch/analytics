[3:16] so
[3:18] [Music]
[4:18] take just this moment of time or to
[4:20] express my gratefulness
[4:22] to your brother demus shakarian
[4:25] does never meet his pentecost under the
[4:27] groups there's too many differences
[4:29] but there's one place where we have
[4:30] things in common under the blood of
[4:32] jesus christ
[4:33] that's where we have things in common
[4:35] that's god's way
[4:37] for us to meet anyhow there's no other
[4:39] place that god promised to me
[4:41] man only under the shed blood
[4:45] i think last night of our brother oral
[4:46] roberts when he made that wonderful
[4:48] statement here about
[4:49] out of his innermost being shall flow
[4:51] rivers of water
[4:52] the great uh how he brought that in
[4:55] about out of his belly i believe he said
[4:57] throw the flow of these rivers of water
[4:59] did you ever notice
[5:01] it's rivers of one water
[5:05] rivers plural water one not rivers of
[5:09] waters
[5:10] but rivers of water one spirit by the
[5:13] same spirit
[5:14] we're all baptized into the same body
[5:16] out of him
[5:17] blows the goodness and grace of god and
[5:20] now
[5:21] you california people we are in your
[5:23] state beginning next week i believe over
[5:25] there and then on down through georgia

[5:32] greatly i appreciate the little ladies
[5:34] that's played the music
[5:35] and these fine men that have met this
[5:37] new brother your
[5:39] brother solomon king i may say that
[5:41] wrong i can thank a king solomon and
[5:43] just turn it around
[5:44] that was that day and this is another
[5:46] king too
[5:48] a son of a king anyhow that's right son
[5:50] of a king oh i'm not a king the king
[5:54] when i look at this it reminds me of
[5:55] down in mexico here
[5:57] a few years ago in mexico city we were
[6:00] there one night
[6:01] they'd been a blind man the night before
[6:03] come on the platform totally blind for
[6:04] many years
[6:06] i looked at his feet i stand there with
[6:08] a good suit on a pair of shoes and i
[6:10] looked at his
[6:12] he's blind no shoes on ragged trousers
[6:15] and standing out there in that rain for
[6:17] maybe 30 000 or more standing there in
[6:20] that rain leaning against one another no
[6:21] seats
[6:22] been there since early that morning just
[6:23] waiting to get there that night
[6:25] and there had been um this blind man had
[6:29] received his sight
[6:31] and the next night much about twice the
[6:33] size of this
[6:34] bench here whatever we call it but just
[6:37] on the platform is this
[6:38] rick's almost as high as what that
[6:40] curtain hangs just old
[6:42] shawls and coats and at the people at
[6:44] warren throwing up there
[6:46] just that we might touch it
[6:49] uh that most all were catholic of course
[6:51] there in mexico city
[6:54] and i got in being the first protestant
[6:55] ever coming on our military
[6:57] invitation that was from general valdez
[7:00] our good friend
[7:01] full gospel businessman i remember that
[7:04] night
[7:04] there's a scream come from the outside
[7:06] my son came to me said
[7:08] i've got at least 150 ushers or more
[7:11] standing there and they can't keep a
[7:12] little spanish woman she's got a dead
[7:14] baby died this morning
[7:15] said they can't keep that woman outside
[7:17] she'll climb over their backs and
[7:19] everything
[7:20] and i said well just reinforce it he
[7:22] said i haven't got nothing else to
[7:23] reinforce with
[7:24] i said give her a prayer card said i
[7:25] haven't got one they're all give out
[7:28] i said brother boy you go pray for her i
[7:30] said cause she don't know me
[7:32] and i said uh you go pray far and i'm
[7:35] gonna try to pray for this big rig of
[7:36] clothes just in a few moments
[7:38] while i was standing there i looked out
[7:40] over the audience like this
[7:41] and before me was a little mexican baby
[7:44] no teeth just smiling right out in front
[7:46] of me i said wait a minute brother moore
[7:50] they brought the little fella a little
[7:52] lady come in falling down with a
[7:54] crucifix in her hand
[7:55] i told through a brother interpreter
[7:59] to have her stand up i said brother
[8:02] moore i don't know where this is it or
[8:03] not but i've seen a little baby standing
[8:05] out from in a vision just now
[8:07] smiling she had under a little blue and
[8:09] white striped blanket just soaking wet
[8:11] it's just raining it's about 10 o'clock
[8:13] at night the baby died that morning
[8:15] around eight or nine in the doctor's
[8:16] office with pneumonia
[8:18] and so she had been staying the rain her
[8:20] hair was all down in her face
[8:22] and she was a very lovely child
[8:26] she looked to be probably her first baby
[8:28] in her early 20s
[8:29] and the little fella died i just laid my
[8:32] hands over on it and i said lord jesus i
[8:34] don't understand this
[8:35] but according to that vision i've seen
[8:37] him no more and said that
[8:38] he kicked and screamed and the little
[8:40] fellow was alive
[8:42] i had brother espinoza's how many knows
[8:44] espinosa's brother espinoza's
[8:46] he was the one who chased it down to the
[8:48] doctor's office found that it's true
[8:50] that's right the baby died that morning
[8:52] to sign the statement and so now
[8:54] he's the same god today if we could just
[8:57] have the same kind of faith
[8:59] in him that's right our heavenly father
[9:03] sent us that faith of that little
[9:04] mexican woman today she'd seen that
[9:06] little blind man
[9:08] heal the night before stand out there
[9:10] with her baby in that cold
[9:12] blowing wind it took pneumonia
[9:15] and the next morning early it died in
[9:17] the doctor's office
[9:19] her first thought comes if god can heal
[9:22] a blinded eyes can reveal the secret of
[9:26] the heart
[9:26] it's still the word of god or the word
[9:29] of god
[9:31] discerns the thoughts it's in the heart
[9:34] and she knew that he could discern the
[9:37] thoughts that was in her heart
[9:39] she believed him and he could raise up
[9:42] lazarus from the grave and he was the
[9:44] same
[9:44] yesterday today and forever she come you
[9:48] rewarded her lord by giving her a banker
[9:50] baby it lives today so far as we know
[9:53] we thank thee for this bless us today
[9:55] father bless these people with these
[9:57] handkerchiefs and coats laying here also
[10:00] and may your holy spirit come now
[10:02] and in part the word of god to us we
[10:04] asked in jesus name
[10:06] amen i know you have a meeting just in a
[10:10] few moments
[10:10] or five o'clock i believe and usually
[10:13] that wouldn't give me time to get
[10:14] started but i've
[10:15] i've been converted from that i think
[10:17] now i've tried hard this week
[10:19] i had a sore throat maybe that was
[10:21] working together for good
[10:23] i told the people of the day i had their
[10:25] hair pieced but that's a shame to wear
[10:26] because i hollered at the women so much
[10:28] about their hair
[10:29] and i i had my hair taken out by
[10:31] carbolic acid and
[10:32] the other night they opened that door a
[10:34] little air circulated through here and i
[10:35] didn't think i was going to get back
[10:36] today
[10:37] i said if oral roberts is sure he can
[10:39] stand by if he will
[10:41] he hasn't showed yet so i'll read the
[10:43] scripture you pray for me
[10:45] saint matthew the 27th chapter beginning
[10:47] with the 11th
[10:48] verse i wish to read now listen real
[10:51] close to the reading of the word because
[10:54] my word is a man's word it'll fail
[10:57] his word can't fail so now listen close
[11:00] as we read
[11:01] and before while you're turning i'd like

[11:43] before the governor
[11:44] and the governor asked him saying art
[11:46] thou the christ
[11:49] of the jews and jesus said unto him
[11:53] thou and when he was
[11:57] of the chief accused of the chief
[11:59] priests and elders
[12:00] and of the i had answered nothing then
[12:04] said
[12:04] pilate unto him here's now not
[12:07] how many things they witness against
[12:10] thee
[12:12] and he answered him to never a word
[12:14] insomuch that the governor
[12:16] marveled now at the feast
[12:20] the governor want to release unto the
[12:23] people a prisoner
[12:24] whom they would and they had then a
[12:27] noble
[12:28] prisoner called barabbas therefore
[12:32] when they were gathered together pilate
[12:34] said unto them
[12:36] whom will ye that i release unto you
[12:38] barabbas
[12:39] or jesus which is called
[12:42] christ for he knew
[12:45] that for envy they had delivered him
[12:49] when he was cast down on the set down on
[12:52] the judgment seat
[12:53] his wife sent unto him saying have
[12:55] nothing to do
[12:56] with this just man for i have suffered
[12:58] many things
[13:00] this day in a dream because of him
[13:03] but the chief priests and the elders
[13:05] persuaded the multitude
[13:06] that they should ask for a barabbas
[13:10] and destroy jesus the governor
[13:14] answered and said unto them whether i'll
[13:17] between will ye that i release
[13:19] unto you and they said barabbas
[13:23] pilate said unto them what shall i do
[13:26] then
[13:27] with jesus which is
[13:30] called christ they all say unto him
[13:34] let him be crucified and the governor
[13:37] said
[13:38] what evil has he done but they cried out
[13:41] the more saying let him be crucified
[13:44] pilate saw that he could prevail nothing
[13:46] but rather the
[13:48] tumult was made he took water and washed
[13:51] his hands before the multitude scene
[15:12] 27th chapter of the 11th verse and jesus
[15:15] stood before the governor
[15:17] and the governor asked him saying art
[15:19] thou the christ
[15:22] of the jews and jesus said unto him
[15:26] thou sayest and when he was
[15:30] of the chief accused of the chief
[15:32] priests and elders
[15:33] and of the and answered nothing then
[15:36] said
[15:37] pilate unto him here's now not
[15:40] how many things they witness against
[15:42] thee
[15:44] and he answered him to never a word
[15:47] insomuch that the governor
[15:49] marveled now at the feast
[15:52] the governor want to release unto the
[15:55] people a prisoner
[15:57] whom they would and they had then a
[16:00] noble
[16:01] prisoner called barabbas therefore
[16:05] when they were gathered together pilate
[16:07] said unto them
[16:08] whom will ye that i release unto you
[16:10] barabbas
[16:11] or jesus which is called
[16:14] christ for he knew
[16:18] that for envy they had delivered him
[16:21] when
[16:22] he was passed down on the set down on
[16:24] the judgment seat
[16:25] his wife sent unto him saying have
[16:27] nothing to do with this just man
[16:30] for i have suffered many things this day
[16:33] in a dream because of him but the chief
[16:36] priests and the elders persuaded the
[16:38] multitude
[16:39] that they should ask for a barabbas
[16:42] and destroy jesus the governor
[16:46] answered and said unto them whether all
[16:49] between will ye that i release
[16:51] un to you and they said barabbas
[16:55] pilate said unto them what shall i
[16:58] do then with jesus
[17:01] which is called christ
[17:05] they all say unto him let him be
[17:07] crucified
[17:09] and the governor said what evil has he
[17:12] done
[17:13] but they cried out the more saying let
[17:15] him be crucified
[17:16] pilate saw that he could prevail nothing
[17:19] but
[17:20] rather the tumult was made he took water
[17:23] and washed his hands before the
[17:25] multitude saying
[17:26] i am innocent of the blood of this just
[17:29] person
[17:30] see you to it then answered all
[17:33] the people and said his blood be on us
[17:36] and on our children
[17:38] then released he barabbas unto them and
[17:40] when he had
[17:41] scourged jesus he delivered him to be
[17:44] crucified
[17:48] my subject today if i should call it
[17:50] that for the next 30 minutes
[17:54] is what shall we do with this jesus
[17:58] call christ
[18:02] and then uh i would like to say this
[18:05] also
[18:06] jesus on our hands
[18:10] now i believe that the hour where our
[18:13] scene starts
[18:15] is long about daylight and pilots
[18:17] judgment hall
[18:20] and it's one of the saddest times
[18:25] and one of the most uh crucial times
[18:30] of all history is the saddest mistake
[18:34] the church ever made in its history
[18:37] they had just made it and now
[18:41] it's been thrown into the laps of the
[18:44] governor
[18:45] the state both church and state because
[18:48] they were a people chosen of god
[18:54] called to be his servants and the nation
[18:57] was supposed to be
[18:58] controlled by god's laws
[19:02] and the church had turned down
[19:05] their messiah although he had been so
[19:10] well identified to them
[19:13] they had chosen rather to stay with the
[19:17] tradition of the elders of that day
[19:20] than to believe the anointed the
[19:23] vindicated
[19:25] word that god had promised them
[19:28] for hundreds of years to come
[19:32] did you notice it also prophesied that
[19:34] they'd be blind
[19:36] they couldn't understand this and how
[19:38] they'd be blinded but they were
[19:41] and they had made their great mistake
[19:44] and this day
[19:45] they had made their final show of it
[19:48] and now it's in the hands of the
[19:51] government
[19:52] and now the government has to make its
[19:55] choice
[19:56] the churches had already rejected him
[19:59] though god had
[20:00] thoroughly proved that he was their
[20:03] messiah
[20:05] now i want to take just a few moments
[20:08] before
[20:08] we get down into this to the text and so
[20:11] forth that i have
[20:12] notes i got written here about him how
[20:15] could
[20:16] those people have failed to see that
[20:20] one thing the scripture clearly says
[20:22] they were blind
[20:24] but it's hard to make them understand
[20:27] their blind
[20:28] just as hard as it is today when the
[20:31] bible tells us that
[20:32] this generation is naked
[20:35] miserable poor and blind and don't know
[20:39] it
[20:40] now that's the scripture now
[20:44] you tell we american people that we're
[20:46] blind we'll tell you right quick you
[20:48] don't know what you're talking about
[20:49] but i'm going to bring you to trial this
[20:52] afternoon
[20:53] find out whether we are blind or not and
[20:56] we got jesus on trial
[20:58] this afternoon and he's blood on our
[21:00] hands
[21:02] and now we want to see what we're going
[21:03] to do about it
[21:05] will we make the same rational mistake
[21:08] that they made then
[21:10] notice what happened he had been clearly
[21:13] identified
[21:15] and fulfill the office that god said he
[21:18] would fulfill as messiah
[21:20] there was no question about it
[21:24] for he was born the way god said he'd be
[21:26] born
[21:27] he was rejected the way god said he'd be
[21:29] rejected
[21:31] he had proven himself to be the messiah
[21:33] because the messiah
[21:35] was god messiah means anointed
[21:40] one and he was anointed with the
[21:44] with the fullness of the godhead bodily
[21:47] dwelled in him
[21:48] he wasn't just a prophet yet he was a
[21:50] prophet but he was more than a prophet
[21:53] he was a god head bodily dwelling in a
[21:57] human
[21:58] being known as the son of god god the
[22:01] father had overshadowed a virgin and
[22:04] created in her blood
[22:05] in her womb of blood cell that brought
[22:08] forth the son
[22:09] of god which god tabernacled in
[22:14] and he was identified to them
[22:17] as who he said he was but he never did
[22:20] come right out and tell him
[22:21] i am the son of god no no they have to
[22:24] believe that
[22:26] he said my works testify who i am
[22:29] he commanded them look in the scriptures
[22:31] and see what day they were living in
[22:33] then they would know what he was i think
[22:36] it would behoove us to do this as we see
[22:38] another exodus at hand
[22:40] i think we should look and search the
[22:42] scriptures when we see things
[22:44] arise we notice then that the church had
[22:47] made their decision that they wanted
[22:49] nothing to do with him
[22:51] why when the word correctly identified
[22:54] him
[22:55] and his works vindicated that he was the
[22:58] messiah
[23:00] such a horrible crucial thing
[23:03] mistake that that church made and i
[23:05] wonder if it could be possible if we can
[23:07] make that same mistake
[23:10] they had been given their last chance to
[23:13] see what he was and to accept him
[23:17] now you won't always have the
[23:19] opportunity to accept what god says
[23:22] see his patience finally runs out and
[23:25] then you cross that line between grace
[23:27] and judgment
[23:28] there's nothing left but judgment when
[23:30] god's patience finally runs out
[23:33] but they have been given this
[23:34] opportunity and it's seen him identify
[23:37] himself
[23:38] see him at the well with the woman and
[23:40] told her
[23:41] that she had five husbands seen
[23:44] nathanael
[23:45] uh come up to him after philip that went
[23:47] and brought nathaniel into his presence
[23:50] and he spoke and told exactly who he was
[23:53] and where he come from
[23:54] told simon peter who his father was and
[23:57] what his name was
[23:59] and they hadn't had a prophet for
[24:01] hundreds of years
[24:02] and even that little prostitute woman
[24:05] recognized the word of god
[24:07] she wasn't all mixed up in something she
[24:10] she was
[24:11] her mind wasn't all what we would call
[24:13] if you excuse expression from this
[24:15] muddled up running here and running
[24:17] there it was a virgin mind as far as
[24:19] that concern
[24:20] she said we know the messiah's coming
[24:22] and this is what he'll do
[24:24] and he said i'm he and quickly she
[24:27] run told the man in the city come see
[24:30] him this is the very messiah
[24:32] one of those educators and people of
[24:34] that day couldn't see that
[24:35] it's it's be hard to see if you wouldn't
[24:38] know the scriptures but the scripture
[24:40] said
[24:40] they were blinded they were
[24:43] actually blinded but they chose
[24:46] rather instead of that lovely jesus
[24:48] after
[24:49] we hear the cry come out crucified
[24:53] pilate said what will i do with this
[24:55] jesus which is called the christ it said
[24:57] away with him crucified who shall i
[25:00] release to you
[25:01] barabbas or jesus and they made the
[25:04] rational mistake
[25:05] by choosing a murderer
[25:09] instead of life-giver
[25:12] one that was identified as life-giver
[25:15] they chose a murderer who was identified
[25:18] as life-taker
[25:20] what a contrast and i wonder if i say
[25:24] this with
[25:25] all godly respects for my brethren and
[25:28] my sisters and for the
[25:29] men and women of this day who i preached
[25:31] to with love in my heart for
[25:34] all people i wonder if we are not
[25:37] about ready to see the same thing as
[25:40] this scene
[25:41] the government had become involved in
[25:44] this
[25:44] and the the issue was on the question
[25:48] must be
[25:49] settled it was at a showdown
[25:52] so has it been today so is it in this
[25:55] hour
[25:56] the showdown is on something's got to be
[26:00] done
[26:01] you've got to say yes or no but remember
[26:05] it won't be when you're forced to do it
[26:07] you have to do it on your free moral
[26:09] will now now not when that time takes
[26:12] place when it does it's over
[26:13] now this may be the last day you'll have
[26:16] time to make choice
[26:17] you can't do it then you've already took
[26:19] it it's too far at that time you must do
[26:21] it now
[26:22] don't wait till the last minute because
[26:25] the boat will pull out and leave you the
[26:27] doors will be closed many people will
[26:29] come into the ark if they could have
[26:30] gotten in there when the rain started
[26:32] falling
[26:32] but the issue was made the gospel was
[26:35] preached
[26:35] the signs were showed and the time was
[26:38] over the rain was then falling judgment
[26:39] was on
[26:40] now the whole nation had
[26:44] to reject him because that it was
[26:47] called as we would say today a christian
[26:50] nation like this is called a christian
[26:52] nation
[26:52] therefore if it was called jehovah's
[26:55] nation
[26:56] his selected people then the whole
[26:59] nation had to turn him down
[27:01] the church had already turned him down
[27:03] the church had kicked him out
[27:05] they wanted nothing to do with him but
[27:07] now the government's involved in it
[27:10] so is it back again
[27:13] praise god it's right back in the lap
[27:16] again
[27:19] with the scripture laying here
[27:20] identified just exactly what jesus said
[27:23] would happen
[27:25] why do we stagger on in this hours of
[27:27] darkness
[27:28] why do we let this come upon us
[27:31] when we've been thoroughly warned just
[27:34] as it was in the days of
[27:35] lot we see the very same thing jehovah
[27:38] has set the scene
[27:39] and told us as it was in the days of
[27:41] love
[27:42] you see the messengers out down there in
[27:45] the babylon trying to get lot out and
[27:48] you see the message to the elect
[27:50] abraham it was already out
[27:53] and everything exactly to name place in
[27:56] time
[27:58] has been thoroughly identified but now
[28:01] it's in the hands of the government the
[28:04] government's got to condemn it now
[28:06] and they're going to do it don't you
[28:08] worry about that it's a christian nation
[28:09] it's
[28:10] got to take its christian stand if it is
[28:12] a showdown
[28:13] is on the whole nation had to be brought
[28:17] into judgment because it happened about
[28:20] 80 70 when the great uh roman general
[28:24] titus besieged jerusalem about 80
[28:27] 70 with his army from rome and there
[28:30] they paid the price for rejecting him
[28:42] today
[28:50] [Music]
