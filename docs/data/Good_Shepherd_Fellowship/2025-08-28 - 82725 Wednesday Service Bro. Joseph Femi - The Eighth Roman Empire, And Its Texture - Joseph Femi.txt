So it were like two of my sons were working for overnight and most of the time if I'm not working when they are working I always call wash it back wash it back because I know it's hard for them to on the overnight so when I'm not working I can't sleep I keep worry about them checking on asking me but that night rather thinking of staying up something else happened yeah went to take care of one resident that is very difficult.

God bless you Jesus tonight with our brother. Amen. All right. Um let's go ahead and stand as we sing few song before we turn the other service. I really sing God on the mountain. [Music] Hallelujah.

The God of the day is the God of the night. We talk of faith when we're on the mountain. But don't cross your easy when life at his best [Music] and is down in the valley of trials and temptation. The dust when f is really port and the god of the mountain is still good in the valley. When things go wrong, yeah, he'll make them right. And the God of the gold is the God in the B.

[Music] The Lord bless you. May have your seat a while. Let's just take some prayer needs here before we turn to the preaching of the word. You are more than enough. [Music] And he's more than enough for me. Praise the Lord. We want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be in the house of the Lord this evening and uh for blessing and keeping us while we were away from one another and uh uh around 7 8:00 this morning about yeah about 8:00 I was out on 35 and coming this way and uh uh I just I just saw a lot of movement of police vehicle and ambulance and I just felt so much in my spirit that there was something going wrong to see that amount of uh uh police vehicle and ambulance that was that was running at that time of the morning. I just I felt so much in my spirit. I said there is something going on and Lord whatever it is you just uh take complete control and uh and it was not too long uh that we learned there was uh school shooting that was done in the church. It was a Catholic church. I think they normally do have mass before the kids go to go to go to class or something like that. And uh uh Um and I think there were uh four lives that were lost and and there are some that are in critical condition. So we want to take that upon our hearts tonight and just bring it to the Lord in prayer. Uh brother Desimon has a uh spoken prayer request. We want to remember our brother tonight. Brother Era is asking uh prayer. He's having pain in his left arm and uh uh not knowing what what is what is causing the pain. So we want to take that tonight. Let's just bow our heads uh as we just uh uh be able to take these knees and and uh [Music] When you just think about uh the the time that we are living in and all the things that is happening around us, many of us we have uh we have grown under this grace. This grace that has sought us out. his grace that has favored us and many other horrible things that is happening out there. God has kept us away from it. Just like the children of Israel were in Gushing and the and the judgment were falling in Egypt. And many times is is it's not so easy for us to bring ourselves to the place to to really understand how horrible this word is. to be able to understand how there are blooding men and blood seeeking devils that are walking driving the same street you are driving and walking the same places that you are walking just in a s. So just think about it that this is the week where many little ones are going back to school and that uh that individual which of course he took his life after. But uh uh to just think about the many homes that are grieving tonight. To think about the pains that is in the hearts of mothers, grandmothers, fathers, siblings. if God would just help us tonight and and just bring ourself in and uh and be able to just say a word to the Lord on their behalf tonight that God will be merciful. I listen to a doctor report this afternoon also of one of the surgeon that is working on the on the ones that are critically wounded and by the grace of God trying to stabilize them. May God be merciful and be able to bring them out. But for many families, their lives will never be the same. Their home will never be the same again. Oh God, you are more than enough. Lord Jesus, Father, if we didn't have you, if grace, Lord, Father, have not come our path, Lord. And God, we can come this evening, Lord Jesus. Oh, precious Lord. Many of those people don't even know who to go to, where to turn to. Their little babies were killed right in a church mass. Let's pray together tonight. If we just want to say a word of prayer, we just want to ask God to be merciful. We just want to ask God to send comfort and that God will just help those hurting families. Let's pray together in Jesus name. Amen. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, oh God, we we just Lord Father God, stand Lord God, at our post of duty tonight, Lord, as your sons and your daughters, oh God, Father, precious Lord, we pray, oh God, and say, Father, Lord, just be merciful, oh God. We want to thank you, Lord God. Father, if we just want to know what a privilege we have, oh God, to be able to go out of our house and come in, Lord God, Father, not fearing anything, Lord Jesus Christ. It's not because, Lord, horrible things that are happening out there, Lord. But God, it's all because you have been good to us, Lord.

[Music] called to worship around the article of the supernatural, the word of the living God, Christ Jesus himself, being here and being anointed by his spirit on which mortality can worship the immortal God. The Lord, you expect that from your creation and we are so grateful. The Lord, we're a portion of your creation on earth that still have this consciousness of worshiping you, of coming to the house of the Lord, of laying aside all we counted to be so important to us. Father, be with us. We are here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May we not live the same as you came in. Father, we have needs, we have requests, we have desires. Lord, maybe for ourselves, maybe for some relations. On today we hand over those and Lord, you smile upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be with us tonight. On today I commit the pastor of this church again and the helpers, the deacons and the officers, every member take charge, Lord of their life, soul, spirit and body. We are grateful because you've heard us. Lord, if there be any sin in our midst tonight, iniquity, unconfessed sin, Lord, sin of omission, whatever it might be, transgression, but the authority of the blood of the lamb and the love that the blood that was shed on Calvary released, we plead for mercy and pardon in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Give us our blessing and our release tonight. Father, may the world have a free course in our midst on today we commit this service by pass of clay and speak life unto your people. Thank you for touching your daughter, mama, Lord, and just bring her health and healing to perfection. Thank you for the daughter of the work you've done on her and bless the children and grandchildren, dear Lord, that keeps her comfortably. have your own way. Reward them in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you saints. You be seated for a while. We welcome us again to the house of the Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm grateful to the Lord to be here one more time at this side of eternity. And as the pastor was saying, I just come around to see mama when I learned that uh she passed through some surgery and uh felt it would not be appropriate for me to be here without seeing her because she's fun of me somehow and I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I came and saw her and she's not looking sickly only her body she's feeling weak and the places that the medical science try to maybe work on her but we are grateful to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I appreciate the son here. I wouldn't say son-in-law. I think brother one know is more than a son-in-law to that mama. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful brother. And um The daughter also, sister Aaron, God bless you. &gt;&gt; The woman is not looking unckempt. Amen. She appears to be well taken care of and those things does not go unrewarded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful to God that I know they still keep her with themselves. Maybe some old people's home. I don't know whether she will still be alive by now. But there's something about the warmth of your loved ones. &gt;&gt; Yes. You see the people that are your blood. You see the people that bite your intestine, maybe your child, your grandchild, your great grand. It gives some sort of comfort &gt;&gt; and for strange people to be surrounding you and then on the night of emergency they call you rush rush rush. So so good. And uh God bless them. I appreciate him also as a friend. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate your support every time we come here and the reception we also have from the church. God bless you. And um if you don't receive even if you want us to be here, if you don't want us, we can be here. That is how it goes. I thank you for your love and I want to encourage you again that you stay with your pastor. You love him from the depth of your heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Ronan said is the hardest job on earth, not one of the hardest job, the hardest job on earth &gt;&gt; is to pastor a church &gt;&gt; to prepare people to be ready for the coming of the Lord. To be qualified, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord is a difficult task. And we were talking at home, you have to deny yourself of a whole lot of things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, you dedicate church members car maybe brand new. You dedicate their homes and maybe young was built in 1932 and you dedicating a home that is built in maybe 2005 or 2020 home brand new. And you must not jealousy. You must not feel bad about it. You must be happy. that your church members are progressive. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that must it can only come from a heart that is pure. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Only come from a heart that love God, &gt;&gt; right? When you are sleeping. Sometimes we can't sleep. Yes. We just cannot sleep when you are sleeping. And sometime we sleep when you are awake. That is just how the ministry goes. You see, it's a work that you cannot predict. I didn't plan all this, but it's coming and I'm saying it. When we come here sometimes the grace of God just come down, we start talking. God bless you, brother Steve. Amen. And the wife, the scout, sister Joy, I saw you at the back. God bless you. I guess my brother, my friend Steve Woods is not here tonight. Is the wife around? Or maybe she's listening to Sister Tit and the family. God bless all our friends. We sincerely appreciate you. And um back home there we just know we have some people in Minnesota. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God bless you. So friends that is just how it goes. The ministry is not what you can predict. You can't predict it. You can have a burden for a sermon. You come here the Holy Spirit change it. And there's nothing you can do about it. Sometimes you want to preach some sermons you feel is deep deep. That may not be what God wants for that particular service. And you must not be disappointed &gt;&gt; because obedience is better than sacrifice &gt;&gt; and hacken than the fat of rams. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was thinking I will speak on loyalty tonight but it does not click. So we'll speak on something else that brother Ram say you must be loyal to your church not just being loyal to Jesus Christ right you must be loyal to your church. &gt;&gt; And to be loyal to your church is to be loyal to your pastor. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And we in America, you must be loyal to your church. And loyalty, if you are loyal to something, it implies that you can die for that thing. &gt;&gt; As Americans, you love your country, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I have it in my mind that every American is ready to die for the cause of America. So if you are ready to die for a physical nation, how much more spiritual nation? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Something that have eternal reward. Not just a reward, eternal reward. &gt;&gt; Rewards that lasted through eternity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It must be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the hardest job on earth. Praise God. I said it sometimes ago when I was here that, you know, fasting may be easy or easier when there's no food to eat. But when you are surrounded with plenty and you have to leave the food, it shows a lot of commitment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you don't need two people to be praying for you. One is enough. You don't need two people. One is just enough. A true shepherd that truly carry your burden. &gt;&gt; He does not let off. He does not let go until that thing is done. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can't see it and know. &gt;&gt; You can't know about it. It's not being discussed. &gt;&gt; Even when it's done, he will go in the secret place. &gt;&gt; And thank God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this is been taken care of. &gt;&gt; God bless you if I continue like this. And I wish I can continue like this and forget about what I'm bringing in here tonight. All right. So I appreciate all you all. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I guess Bridget is not here also. We're you know talking and laughing yesterday on a lighter mood. Thanks be to God and we appreciate her state. God will establish everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody God will establish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Except you are not a child of God. &gt;&gt; But the time of the establishment differs. &gt;&gt; Yours could be closer. Yours could be shorter. Yours could be farther. Yours could be like that. Yours could appear as if there's no hope. &gt;&gt; But not when you are truly serving God because we have a hope. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That maketh not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of hope we have. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So all is well because we have a message shalom. Greetings from whom? Every time they call say greet the church, greet the church. Every member of my family, my wife, they send their greetings. Brother Gideon, he passed here also. Greeting from him. He's presently in Colombia. You may be preaching tonight. And America is such a place that uh you can't plan yourself based on time because there are different time zones in one country. So, but we appreciate the Lord for that. But eternity to come, there will be no different time zones. &gt;&gt; There be one great big economy &gt;&gt; and Christ Jesus will be the king. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Shall we read from the scriptures tonight? &gt;&gt; All right. I'm looking at the clock. Uh, amen. Let's pray one more time from the book of Amos. Righteous Lord, we thank you for bringing us to the house of the Lord. Thank you for the comfort that we have being here tonight Lord Jesus. The relaxation we have in your divine presence. No tension, no pressure. We are grateful unto thee. Now we are going to the word of the Lord. Father, refresh us by it. I don't know anything. Lord, I'm a child. I cannot even speak. Lord, unto thee I yield my vessel that you speak life unto your people. &gt;&gt; Take glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amos 3:7. First, Amos 3:7. It's a familiar scripture. Then we'll go to Revelation 13. Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealed his secret unto his servant, the prophet. We see it. Thank you. Revelation chapter 13. The Lord God will never do anything. He will first of all reveal his secret unto his servant, the prophet. I love this scripture so well. Revelation 13:17. And while I was thinking of something else, this one did not leave my mind. Revelation chapter 13, we take you from verse one to three. And uh we just have the frame of one hour where we trust the Lord to help us. The Bible says, "And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea." A beast in the Bible, the prophet said represent power. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And if you read the book of Revelation, because this same beast also came out in the book of features rather in the book of Revelation. As at the time that this same beast, this same power features in revelation, he has carry an institution. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To complement itself to spread its own influence and power all over the surface of the earth. But is the same power is the same beast. Is the same institution. It's the same demon power is the same spirit. But it is guys. So and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns. and upon his horns 10 crowns, and upon his head the name of blessed. And the beast which I saw was like unto a low part, and his feet were as the feet of a bear. We still refer to this. And his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat and great authority. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to pick out a piece from this. John the prophet said the book of revelation is a book of symbol. Yes, &gt;&gt; entirely symbolic brother. I'm saying nothing is written in revelation right directly out is like parable like visions symbols nothing is written directly like that everything is symbolic. Now this beast still leave it on the screen. You said beast represent power and he has seven heads and 10 horns and 10 crowns upon the 10 horns. &gt;&gt; And the dragon, we know that Satan is the dragon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Gave where is that verse two or verse one? We know that the dragon and um and I saw one of his heads and the dragon gave him his power. So this beast that is before us tonight is how exercising all the power of the devil. The devil vacated his seat for this beast to sit upon it. The authority of Satan, he deposited it in that power. He's on earth. He's not in heaven. He's not in. He's not in heaven. He's on earth here. Right now, let's go to verse three. We'll deal on one and three. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to a death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast is a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So may the Lord bless the reading of his word in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We take Revelation 17 when we need it. We I don't know. We just call this the eighth Roman Emperor and its texture. The eighth Roman Emperor and its texture. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We just titled it this and we just trust the Lord to help us within the frame of time that we have. We in the in this brother Renham says that uh he he preached a sermon I think twice titled the events make clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said God always love to tell his people the events before they come to pass. He always love to post us ahead that watch this, watch this, watch this, watch that, it will happen. And we are grateful to the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says a prophet is not just a visioner. He's not only somebody is not somebody that just see vision and prophesy tell the future. He say he's not just a teller forth and a false teller. He say what vindicate a true prophet is because the word of the lord comes to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That a true vindication of a true goal prophet. &gt;&gt; Because we have herbalist that also see vision. &gt;&gt; They also divine. Right. They see things they can tell you your name without seeing you before. So that is not a true vindication of a true prophet of God because Satan does all that. All right. And um we yes if we go to I would leave this you say yeah what a prophet means let's show us the first picture that is the image that man we start from there tonight. church, we are living at the end time. There was a time that the end time began, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron said the return of the Jews back to the back to Palestine is the beginning of the end. And now we are at the end of the end. There was a time the end began. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But now the end has ended. We are at the end of the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. We are not at the beginning of the end. We at the end of the end. Everything that surrounds us shows that we at the end. And as believers, we are grateful to the Lord that we at the end. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And one day, the eastern skies will break open &gt;&gt; and the son of God will peep out from the I mean from heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course, the message of the shout had already gone forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and a voice of the resurrection that will awaken the sleeping saints &gt;&gt; and the trump of the Lord will sound and the force of gravity will lose it hold upon us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we rise with a change of body to say the everlasting price bidding farewell to this sin cause war. &gt;&gt; I was at home. He was out. I read on news back in his house you know shooting in uh in Minnesota. again killed two innocent children, two adults, wounded some other ones. Why? What have they done? Maybe some people are some people that are crazy are holding gun. They're not supposed to hold gun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But by your everybody in America can hold on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give us a picture that first picture. So the world, the gentile world is divided into four different empires. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The gentile world is divided into four different empires right from the Babylonian kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which was typified or represented by the head of gold. &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the of gentile kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if something began remember it must end. &gt;&gt; We have a birthday. We also have a death day. &gt;&gt; Right? Mhm. &gt;&gt; So now that was the head of gold. Then we have typified by the head of gold. Then we have the arms and breast of silver. The medipes kingdom took over from Babylonian kingdom. You know all that. &gt;&gt; We're only reminding you what you had already been taught. &gt;&gt; And then from that we move to the Christian empire. And when we are talking about empire, these were these were kingdoms. Hallelujah. These were a people that governed the entire world. &gt;&gt; Babylon governed the entire world. The kingdom passed down to Mopacian. It governed the entire world. It pass down to Grecian Empire. They govern the entire world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Babylonian were in charge. The Mipian were in charge. The Grecians were in charge. But now today it has moved to the last phase of the gentile world which is the Roman Empire. And Roman Empire is divided into two phases. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The pure mineral led of iron and the iron mixed with mar clay. &gt;&gt; Those are the two divisions of &gt;&gt; the Roman Empire. And that is the empire under which we are living today. We are &gt;&gt; like it or not filled with the Holy Spirit or not filled with the Holy Spirit we are being governed by the Roman Empire &gt;&gt; is under that that we are in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a limited time but not withstanding. So this leg of iron can I have something maybe like a stick even the drumstick I can use it. So that will not my image will not block this on that point. Give me the drumstick or any little stick that can go a little further. So church, Roman Empire is divided in two. The pure letter of iron which was imperial pagan. Thank you. Imperial pagan Roman Empire. I hope you are hearing me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This was imperial from here to here. Legs of iron, imperial pagan Roman Empire. There was nothing here called Christianity but pure paganism. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, brother. Yes. Thank you. Amen. From here the knee legs of iron down here that was the first face of the Roman Empire which was legs of iron and it was marked by pure paganism. And when we are talking about paganism we are talking about an institution that does not know God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; An institution that does not respect God. An institution that does not value humanity, your friend, they kill you. &gt;&gt; Human blood mean nothing to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it ended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it ended, it came down to the feet of iron mixed with mar clay. &gt;&gt; Iron there is still that roish power. declared there brother say humanity that is everywhere man is found that roish spirit must follow it there that's right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; even I don't know how will I put it now to the remotest village on earth don't be surprised that that roy spirit follows it there now we forge ahead by the grace of god so the word I mean gentile word is divided to fall. And now we at the last phase of this gentile power which were at the feet of the image of Daniel chapter 2. And you know what the two big toify &gt;&gt; America and Russia. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cruise chief and uh &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. You know all that by the grace of almighty God. So let's go ahead. Amen. And uh it looks like America and Russia are calling the shots. The America and Russia are just like pebbles on the beach. The main man that is calling the shot is the bishop of Rome. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Is the one that is calling the shot is the bishop of Rome. But he's doing it so hypocritically &gt;&gt; that the world does not discover it. Thank be to God for the believers &gt;&gt; because God sent us a prophet &gt;&gt; with deep prophetic insight &gt;&gt; into the Bible. &gt;&gt; He pull it out and we know that the seven seals has been opened. &gt;&gt; The covering of the devil have been unveiled &gt;&gt; everything that covered the devil in secrecy in falsely in false everything is been pulled out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the believers could see the devil like Satan today like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all that he's doing &gt;&gt; because we are the &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And the probability for a for I mean for the bride of Christ to be deceived is zero. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You mathematician. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The probability for a child of God to be deceived &gt;&gt; zero. &gt;&gt; No probability &gt;&gt; for a child of God to ever be deceived. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; He may go into this. He may go into debt. He may go into something into mockery into fun. A child of God &gt;&gt; never ever &gt;&gt; can never be deceived &gt;&gt; because God knew the end right from the beginning. &gt;&gt; How can his child be lost? &gt;&gt; So we are under this influence. &gt;&gt; I want to ask us a question. Who is the chairman of United Nation Organization? Who is the chairman of UN? Who is the chairman of UN? Who is the president of UN? You're supposed to know. You are people and you live in America. Praise God. Who is the secretary of UN? &gt;&gt; Is it Antonio Gutter? &gt;&gt; Gutter. &gt;&gt; Gutter. &gt;&gt; Now church. Who do you hear concerning UN? Is he a chairman or a secretary? &gt;&gt; What do you hear? &gt;&gt; We hear secretary &gt;&gt; right now. How can the secretary head an institution like United Nation Organization? Come on, brother. Have we ever sat down or sat down to to to to think about that? Have you ever seen any organization that is being headed by secretary? There must be a chairman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or a president. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or a leader of some sort. &gt;&gt; But UN does not have Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In practice today, UN does not have a chairman. I say in practice, but in principle, UN has in principle, UN has a president. He has a chairman. Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But in practice, he won't say it. And the chairman will never appear or behave or talk as if he's in charge. Brother, brother, say the pope is the one in the driver's seat. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Today, like it or not, he's the head of the gentile world today. Are you on Are you streaming the service? There's only your church that can access it. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Honestly, that is why when I come to America, I don't like saying certain things. I just preach maybe evangelica. I just sufface something and go &gt;&gt; preach brother. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. The pastor say I should preach. &gt;&gt; He's the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Brother say he is the one in the driver's seats. come and charge. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes they cause the world economy to tumble. &gt;&gt; Sometime they stabilize it. Sometime they scatter. Sometime they they I mean they rough on it. How can it be? World economy is collapse. The war collapses it. &gt;&gt; Why should the world economy collapse? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our minerals are no more. Our minerals in the grounds are no more. The resources we get money from, they are no more. &gt;&gt; There are people in charge of this world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know it. &gt;&gt; There are people in charge of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's forge ahead. So now we are the food of this image. That is the last world empire. He moved from here to here. When he was here, it was pure paganism and he moved down here. Then he became a church. Show us the first picture. trusting the Lord to help us. Before you show us the first picture, let me read this quotes in um Mark of the Beast program 142. Mark of the Beast program 142. Mark of the Beast of 19 um God bless you, church. I'm feeling so good here. Mark of the Beast 1954. Let's see what it says. Amen. 1954. Like everywhere in the scriptures, from the beginning of the gentile, right? From the beginning of the gentile plumb back from Genesis. I can prove that Babylon begin in Genesis &gt;&gt; and ends up in Revelations. Babylon began in Genesis, end up in Revelation, started out back there with Nimrod. The son of Ham through adultery. Babylon started &gt;&gt; with Nimrod. the son of true idolatry. &gt;&gt; That was how that kingdom was ushered in. Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't forget there was a time it was not okay. He say through h true idolatry to bring idols in to worship idols. There was a time there was nothing like idol worshiping on earth. But the moment the devil got his own seed on earth then problem started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the devil poured down his own understanding revelation into the mind of his seed and from his seat the world you know is constantly being polluted by idols and errors and false teachings and all. Okay. So now to to bring idols in to worship idols list in church and it come right down through and and so cunning the prophet say and so cunning in the last days till it takes on the name of Christianity &gt;&gt; and still adultery &gt;&gt; at the end time the prophet said he came in so cunny. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; so smart. so shrewd, so sly that he came in the end time in the name of Christianity, &gt;&gt; but he say still at the lottery. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No difference. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why I titled it the eighth Roman Empire with his and and his its textures. All right. &gt;&gt; And to continue by the grace of God. But the elector cannot be deceived. You say well my you say well my how the day we are living in the darkness that we are living in and men and women grouping in grouping about here in pagan darkness and don't even know it what a beauty but that's the day that we are living in &gt;&gt; now church let's go back to revelation chapter 13 revelation 13 one be fast on the projector I will try and get the quotes but get the scriptures So he saw this beast coming out from the water and the prophet said even according to revelation 17 he say waters there means peoples we can't read it because of time you know it peoples tongues and nations &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; this power came out from among peoples tongues and nations everywhere man is being found &gt;&gt; and he has seven heads the prophecy there's only one uh there's only one city on earth &gt;&gt; that is built on seven hills &gt;&gt; and that is Rome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's built on seven hills. &gt;&gt; So the seven heads means seven hills. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And brotherham, trusty trusty. It says the city of Rome that no city on earth is built on seven hills apart from Rome. And he said but Rome with her strict confines. Amen. He said the people does not realize that. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that Rome Vatican is a city within &gt;&gt; a city, &gt;&gt; not a church. &gt;&gt; Can the city of Minnesota or Minneapolis, right? &gt;&gt; Can the city of Minneapolis send out ambassadors and receive ambassadors? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is she qualified? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Even the state of Minnesota is not qualified &gt;&gt; to send out ambassador and receiving ambassador. But the city of Vatican, &gt;&gt; I think about 4,000 or I mean about 2,000 people. If I still get the population correctly, the population of Vatican is about 2,000 people in um Vatican. All right, let's leave that. It's about a thousand between a,000 and 2,000 people. She sends out ambassadors. &gt;&gt; Then she receives ambassadors. You have ambassador of of Vatican in the United States. What was he looking for? &gt;&gt; And you have your ambassador also in Vatican. What was he doing there? I hope you are hearing me. &gt;&gt; How can a city assume the status of a country? &gt;&gt; Vatican has their own flag. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you have your own flag &gt;&gt; and let it supersede? So church in the beginning God completed the transformation of the earth. He went to rest. Don't forget the devil came. &gt;&gt; He took over this beautiful Eden and it became Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's Eden had an echo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't think if Satan takes it over, he also have an echo. So what do you think Vatican is? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What do you think Vatican is? Vatican is Satan's &gt;&gt; headquarters. &gt;&gt; And that is why he stays to govern world affairs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother said she's in democratic nations. She's in the more despotic ones. Like it or not, she's in Russia. She's in China. Right. She's in mention it those police countries. Those police countries they're everywhere. And who can push them out? Roman Cali priest can enter anywhere I believe on earth. But let me carry our Bible under our armpit. Let's say we are going to somewhere who knows us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see them in the airport. You see them here. They are well respected. Brother says &gt;&gt; adultery at the beginning &gt;&gt; he said but by the time it came to the end time it came so conny &gt;&gt; that it put on the name of the church &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and still at the lottery &gt;&gt; to the call &gt;&gt; so he has bring the scripture thank you seven heads and 10 I think we've said that in verse two the Bible says verse two it said this beast which he saw was like onopath The appearance, the skin, the color was the color of a lopat. And he had the mouth of a lion, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he had a paw, the feet of a bear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One animal. &gt;&gt; Combining the characteristics &gt;&gt; of three other brutal beasts. &gt;&gt; Lion is brutal. &gt;&gt; Lopad is brutal. B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B A E A A R brutal. &gt;&gt; So this beast and in Daniel chapter 7, Daniel saw the exact thing that John seen here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Daniel said he saw him as the lion. Daniel 7, don't go there anyway because of our time. He saw him. He said he saw four beasts, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that strove on the great sea. He it also related the beast to water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the first one was, you know, was like a lion. &gt;&gt; The second one was like a lopad. The third one was like a bear. In verse 7, let's read Daniel 7:7 first. Daniel 7:7, you see what it says there. He said the fourth one was dreadful and terrible. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; He did not have any description for the fourth beast. &gt;&gt; No representation in the animal kingdom. &gt;&gt; Daniel did not know what to call it. &gt;&gt; He said it looks dreadful. and terrible. He's not coming on. I've quoted a leave it. God bless you. Now, let's move on to something else because of our time. He say it was dreadful and terrible. So now that is to say this beast of Revelation 13:1, he combines the characteristics. Thank you. And this I saw in that vision, behold the fourth beast was what? &gt;&gt; I want to hear your voice church. dreadful and &gt;&gt; and strong exiting. That's the Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; Is that Roman kingdom? Who do you think can defeat it? &gt;&gt; The Bible ask said, "Who can make war with the beast?" He said the Bible. Who can make war with the beast? &gt;&gt; Nobody on earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there's coming a king, a warrior according to Revelation 19. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he would destroy her with a with a spirit with a sword of his mouth. &gt;&gt; And here comes with him from heaven soldiers, &gt;&gt; saints riding on white horses. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Do not literal horses." &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that can defeat the beast. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who can make war with the beast?" &gt;&gt; Is a challenge in the scriptures, &gt;&gt; brother. Nobody can fight it. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. America will not fight it. Russia cannot defeat it. No, no political weapon can defeat it because he's the head of politics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the head of politics. &gt;&gt; No. Okay. Look dreadful and terrible. Now he will forger. Uh yeah, he has the characteristics of lion, of bear and of loba combined. That is to say the powers of the first three kingdoms &gt;&gt; is all gathered in that fourth kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Demon power. Who do you think rules Babylon? Who do you think rules Metropia? Who do you think was ruling in in the Christian Empire? And then who do you think is ruling now in the Roman Empire? You will see who is ruling. That's right. As we remind you again, we are living at we are living in the end time. Brother said the most glorious time for the church &gt;&gt; and the most horrible time for the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; We can sing the song of redemption because our redemption drawer now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are we are just about to be in fact we are free. &gt;&gt; Not that we are about to be. We are free. &gt;&gt; We are liberated. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So now revelation give us revelation leave that one dreadful and terrible all the powers of this other kingdom is combined. Don't forget also the devil is fighting us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the form of the pale horse rider. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't it? And a pale horse is the power of the white, the black and the red combined to fight the bride. And God has given a corresponding power, the anointing of the flying eagle to combat that power. So we cannot be overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are victors ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now give us revelation. Revelation revelation 13. Just leave it at verse two there. Hallelujah. So now he combines these other powers and uh the man of a dragon. The devil gave him his seat. So there's a seat for it. &gt;&gt; There's a throne for it. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not hanging anywhere. There's a seat. There's a throne and great authority. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When UN was 50 years here in America, don't forget Revelation 13:11. That's your That's America. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; A lamb. I mean a beast like that had a little horn like a lamp. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother R said that's America. &gt;&gt; Two little horns. &gt;&gt; Brother R say &gt;&gt; and ecclesiastical power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Political and church power, &gt;&gt; government and church power. You can't run away from them. The only thing that can lift to above them is the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the seal of God. &gt;&gt; Apart from that, brother, you can't dodge it. &gt;&gt; You can't dodge it. Who is not connected to civil power here? Who is not working here for the government? &gt;&gt; You say no, I'm self-employed. You're self-employed. Who are you serving? Who are you serving? Now, leave the scripture on there. Just leave it on there so that I won't take time before you bring it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, now let's go to verse three of Revelation 13. Excuse me. And I saw what? &gt;&gt; One of his heads as it were &gt;&gt; wounded to death. Not unto death. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Wounded to death. And his deadly wound &gt;&gt; was healed. And all the world wondered &gt;&gt; after the beast whose deadly wound was healed. Praise the Lord. Now brother Ram said this was when the barbarians in the church ages. This was when the barbarians onslaught that Roman Empire pure pagan uh pure that onslaught imperial pagan Roman Empire. Brother Von said there over 400 or about 400 idol temples in Rome alone. In the city of Rome alone there over 500 temples to idols of idols in Roma. In the city of Rome alone over 400 temples of idols. Now and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast. The prophet said this uh uh death blow or uh uh deadly wound was when the barbarians on slaughtered that pagan Roman Empire, right? And beat her to the ground that she was almost lifeless. That paganism was almost &gt;&gt; lifeless. But in her wickedness, there arose a champion &gt;&gt; called Constantine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There arose a champion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who pretended to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But in actuality, he was a he was a pagan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Adult worshipper. &gt;&gt; Now, what did he do? He brought paganism &gt;&gt; and Christianity. He had a dream, right? He saw the cross and he believe if if he paint the cross on the shield of his soldiers, he will win the election. And he won the election. Come on, church. He brought pagan. He brought pagans and Christians together. And Nishia council of 325 AD. Nisha is in the present day talking. You have access to those informations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Right. &gt;&gt; I say praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now church. &gt;&gt; That was when under Constantine he brought Christians and pagans together. I'm sorry now. And if you are having a reaction maybe chemical reaction when you mix two compounds or two atoms or two element together the resultant product will be different from the two component element you put together. It must be different. Yes. &gt;&gt; So when Christianity came to get married to paganism, he gave birth to something. &gt;&gt; And what he gave birth to was not Christianity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it did not look like paganism. [Music] &gt;&gt; He he mingled politics and religion. He brought church and state. He brought Christianity and idolatry. Mix them together. And he gave birth to something. What did he give birth to? &gt;&gt; You know the meaning of RC? I won't break it down now, but you know what means. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, so Constantine was the catalyst that the devil used to achieve that goal. Let's go to Revelation 17. Now, the wounded head. That's when that pagan Roman Empire that was almost lifeless came back to life again. Right? That is the healing of the wounded head. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Rome revived and became stronger than ever, more powerful than the pagan force. Say he rules today in every country, even to the despotic ones. Let's go to Revelation 17. Praise the Lord. All right. Thank God for the few more minutes we still have in here. Neil, and there came unto me one of the seven angel who had the seven vows and talk to me, say unto me, come either I will do what? &gt;&gt; I will show unto thee the judgment. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Of the great hall that does what? &gt;&gt; Seated of many words. Revelation 13:1. Where does the power power come from? From water. &gt;&gt; And by the time he comes to Revelation 17:1, he's now sitting on many waters, &gt;&gt; dominating the peoples of the earth, &gt;&gt; except the one that has their name written in the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; They are the only people that will not be deceived by this power. &gt;&gt; It's a power is a formidable power, &gt;&gt; but not before the Holy Spirit. Verse two. Verse two says, "Whom the kings of the earth have done what? Committed fornication." When died, I followed. They followed the do on radio. Clint I think Clinton was there. I can't remember the president that was the who was ruling America then whether was Obama. I just cannot remember. Kings came from kings came from uh the land of Arabia from the Arab lands from all those Asian countries. Kings they literally knelt down beside the corpse of the pope literally including your president and ex-president of America. What has big political big week? who has political big weeks got to do with a pastor. &gt;&gt; Is Pope not a pastor? &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Is he not a pastor? &gt;&gt; What has political big weeks got to do with a pastor &gt;&gt; thanks be to God. Our eyes have been anointed &gt;&gt; with eyes off &gt;&gt; that we can see &gt;&gt; and we are seeing. &gt;&gt; We are not blinded. We are not blind. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; yes. So, leave it, leave the scripture on there. Revelation 17. See what it says. Thank God. Whom the kings of the day have committed fornication, and the inhabitant of they have been made drunk with the wine of our fornication. That's adultery. Verse three says, yes. Verse three, &gt;&gt; so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness. What did he see? &gt;&gt; And I saw a woman set upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of &gt;&gt; having how many heads? &gt;&gt; How many horns &gt;&gt; is the same beast &gt;&gt; of Revelation? 13 &gt;&gt; that has come here to Revelation 17. And as Revelation 17, Hallelujah, the beast is no more by itself. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; She had carried a woman on her back on his back. &gt;&gt; And the woman is a church. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So now what happens or what happened? That pagan power, that pagan authority, that pagan rights, pagan rituals, hallelujah, was now hiding under the texture of the Bible, &gt;&gt; under the texture of the church, under the texture of himnels, under the texture of choir, under the texture of white robes, &gt;&gt; under the texture of tight and offerings, &gt;&gt; under the texture of gang. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanks be to God &gt;&gt; for his mercies to us &gt;&gt; through the message of the hour &gt;&gt; revealing the secret of the devil to us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So by the time from Revelation 13:1 it became Revelation 17:3. &gt;&gt; That same power carried a church. Empowering a church, financing a church. Hallelujah. Inspiring a church is the same demon power. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The same evil spirit. But night has become a church with pulpit, &gt;&gt; with Bible, &gt;&gt; with church members, with confession, with the cross, with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on, we go. No, in the old pagan Roman, in the old pagan empire, Nimrod, the wife's name was Amir. She when Nimrod died, she claimed that she had an immaculate conception that she was being impregnated without knowing a man because your husband died and then she put to birth. She named her son Thos, which is that same son God. She named her son Tamos. So now we had Seami that was being woripped in all Babylonian pagan religion and then we had her son that was also being woripped &gt;&gt; in the old pagan Babylonian religion. So then when paganism became married to Christianity what happened it was so easy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They pulled down Samaria. No more calling Sam they were now calling Mary because it looks so fitting. They were now calling Mary and Jesus mother and son. It fitted their pagan religion. &gt;&gt; We only have one hour to deal with this. Amen. So fitted fit perfectly their pagan religion. Now they change their song God worship birthday to the birthday of the son of God. And that is why they took Christmas to December. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not born in December. &gt;&gt; He was born in March, April. &gt;&gt; That's right. How can we be celebrating his birthday &gt;&gt; in the very month that he was not born? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was when that pagan power of revelation 13:1 that demon power hide under the texture of the Bible &gt;&gt; and the whole world carries amen pastor bishop. I don't want to call that pastor now a bishop of this right you know you understand what I'm talking about &gt;&gt; thanks be to God &gt;&gt; that he open our eyes &gt;&gt; that's the prophet &gt;&gt; right now why we forge ahead so it became a church idolatry at the beginning beganism at the beginning idolatry paganism at the end but it has taken on the name of a church by the time you came to the end time. Praise the Lord. And none is the feet of iron mixed with maric clay. That's papal false Christian Rome is still a Roman power is a Roman Empire &gt;&gt; and he's under that now wherein we are like it or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now America is a superpower but America is under that power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every country under the sun is under that power and he knows how to achieve it. All right, I'm looking at the time now. If we go to steel mark of the beast, I hope we understand this. Revelation 13 became revelation 17 in Revelation 133 and Constantine was a catalyst that the devil used to achieve that &gt;&gt; to marry church and stay together. And the product was the Roman Catholic Church. I've said it now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's a church, isn't it? &gt;&gt; She has a pastor, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Does seem like a Christian church, isn't it? That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know what is behind it? &gt;&gt; You have seen the power now that is carrying her is the power. Revelation 13. One, that beast, that power, by the time he came to Revelation 17, it has become purple, royal, rich, powerful, torture. So when they were saying Hillary Clinton will be the one that fulfill the six vision. How can Hillary Clinton fulfill the six vision? Brother say a most beautiful a most beautiful but woman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hillary Clinty was beautiful maybe when she was 18 20 but today she's a grandmother. Where's her beauty? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But this woman, the Bible, the prophet said, "A most beautiful croy woman." &gt;&gt; Beautiful, brother. That church is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That church &gt;&gt; is &gt;&gt; beautiful. You go there. Golden altar. &gt;&gt; Come on. Purple color, red color, white color, silver color, golden color. and they have brilliant architect or designer that could mix those things together. See the class of cars they pack in their church compound. See the dresses the members wear. Beautiful. Let's continue. That's not our thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it became a church. Mark of the beast paragraph 184. Paragraph 184. Let's see what the prophet says in here. Mark of the beast paragraph 184. Amen. Which says uh yeah, it says it the devils at the beginning. It the devils at the beginning and I can prove to you that the Bible said here all the word wonder after the beast's power which was which is not and yet is. How could it be? Was and is not. Let's continue with Revelation 17 before we come to this. Bring it out. Revelation 17. I think we'll stop our verse three. And the woman was already in purple and scarlet color and dealt with gold and precious stones. Do you see she's beautiful &gt;&gt; impels and having a golden cup in a handful ofations and finess of her fornication. Verse five, and upon her forehead was what? &gt;&gt; Written. &gt;&gt; Written mystery Babylon the Lord. Let's go to verse six. Verse six says, "And I saw the woman drunken." Let's go to verse seven. And the angel which said unto me, wherefore I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carried her, which has seven heads and 10 horns. The next verse, and the beast, yes, this verse eight, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. Verse eight says, the beast that thou saw west, right? Which is the same beast in 131 is the same beast in Revelation 17. And the beast that saw in the and the power that thou so and institution that saw west and the people that saw west or the person that thou so was and is not. &gt;&gt; How can a human being how can a beast? He was is not and yet is. Brother Ram says that the succession of popes. &gt;&gt; The beast that thou soest was and is not and yet is brother that the succession of popes and the beast that thou soest was the pope is alive and is not the pope die. And yet is they elected another one &gt;&gt; that thou soest was &gt;&gt; and is not and yet is. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And shall ascend out of the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. You see the connection of the Bible and go into pition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder wonder whose name hallelujah were not written in the book of the love of love from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was. Can you follow me? Can you say with me? When they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is &gt;&gt; session of popes. That's the eighth emperor. Now we going let's go to the next verse. And here is the man which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountain. Do you see the Bible? Now &gt;&gt; on which the woman seated. The next verse verse 10. We do we we talk a little bit. And there are seven kings. We talk a little bit because our subject is the eighth Roman emperor and its textures. And there are &gt;&gt; seven kings. &gt;&gt; Seven kings. Five are falling. Now used to say five kings had come and ruled and died. Brother taught us these things. There are seven kings. Five are falling. They have come rule and died and one is ruling. No, as at the time of this writing of the verse, and one is, and the other is not yet come, and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. Hallelujah. Verse 11 says, "And the beast that was and is not even, &gt;&gt; he is the &gt;&gt; he is the age." Thank God for the prophet &gt;&gt; that dissolve these things for us. Even he is the eight and &gt;&gt; of the seven &gt;&gt; is of the seven and goeth into &gt;&gt; pition hell &gt;&gt; going into hell and yet is a pastor with white cas amen with grace of the Lord Jesus Christ the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit go with you Oh, &gt;&gt; but behind it pagan power &gt;&gt; by the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe we are believers here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are not, you don't belong here. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Right. If you are not, you don't belong here. You'll be a problem for us tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And yet we need you here &gt;&gt; because you must fulfill a scripture that a true believer must not fulfill. But we hope and believe that all of us are going to heaven. &gt;&gt; One thing I I don't like said it. I don't like it. Not that I don't believe it. Scaffold work. Scaffold work. You had a lot of scaffold when you were constructing this place. &gt;&gt; Where are the scaffold today? &gt;&gt; They all gone. &gt;&gt; It's a form of believer. It's a form of church members. &gt;&gt; I don't like that thing. Now church while we forge ahead where did we stopped verse 11 right even he is the eight now let's continue let's see what the prophet says give us the picture the first picture the image that image of Daniel chapter 2 give us fast sorry I'll still refer to this and refer to that amen he said the beast that thou sawest The beast was, is not, and yet is. This is this is the realm of the pure pagan Roman Empire minus defeat. Do we see it, &gt;&gt; George? Do we see it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Again, now this was the realm that had the seven kings. It was a pagan imperial pagan Roman Empire. And there are seven kings. Revelation 13 is talking about Rome. He's not talking about Mopacia, Babylon and uh Grecian Empire. They have passed. &gt;&gt; He was dealing with the last world empire which is Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; If the if the Babylonian Empire had an emperor, the Christian Mipia had an emperor. This one had an emperor. Would this one also have an emperor? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by the time he pass from feet to I mean from legs to the feet, won't he also have an emperor? He must have a king &gt;&gt; and the Bible said that king is a king of the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; So now revelation chapter 9. So now what are we say? This was the real imperial or imperial pagan Roman Empire that had seven kings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Five are falling rule dead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One is the sixth. He was ready then and one is yet to come and when he come he must continue a short space. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in here one of those emperors was Nero. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That rule that pagan Roman Empire. Brother said one of them was Nero. Let's consider Nero. Let's dissect him a little bit before we close very soon. Nero was he a kind man? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Her brother say he was nasty. That was correct. &gt;&gt; He was what again? From another person. &gt;&gt; Evil. &gt;&gt; Nero was evil from another person. He was a murderer from me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was what again? &gt;&gt; Wicked. &gt;&gt; He was wicked. He was mean. &gt;&gt; He was bad. B A raised to power 1 million. &gt;&gt; Wicked. Emperor Nero, right? &gt;&gt; He killed his mother. Yes or no? &gt;&gt; Children love their mama. &gt;&gt; Amen. See how brother one sister Harry we carrying mama with her. Even today she was going around. I said no hold my hand. Hold my hand. Even she need me to carry her. I still have the energy to carry her on my back. Put her where she will sit. She's mama grandma for that matter. Children love their mama. I love my mama. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Sometime we confide in mama than papa. I'm sorry now papa. &gt;&gt; Brother say children listen to their mama. &gt;&gt; Oh you are hearing my African mama. To their mother. Yes. Children listen to their mother. But this one was so mean, was so heartless that she took the mother, whoever he used, she tied the mother on a horse &gt;&gt; and she dragged the he drug the mother was drag all drugg round the city of Rome. Emperor Nero's mother was being dragged on the ground. You know when you touch somebody and the person is rolling on the ground the skins everything will be peeling &gt;&gt; until the life left the body of the mother Emperor Nero. That was who he was. And that was what marked right the nature of those seven kings in the old imperial pagan Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; Come on church. Now the Bible says the beast that sest was and is not and yet is. The Bible say he even he is the eighth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That is to say he's the eighth emperor. &gt;&gt; And he's of the nature of those seven kings. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on brother. &gt;&gt; That will not make us to remind us to know who is sitting in that &gt;&gt; in that seat. the kind of a person today is an American but it doesn't matter he's a spirit &gt;&gt; and so long as you are there on that seat that demon possess you &gt;&gt; and you cannot help it &gt;&gt; now church squeezes ahead of us &gt;&gt; and is that same institution that bring the who killed Jesus &gt;&gt; who tried to destroy Israel &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and you think he won't do the same thing again Right? So he's the eighth king. He's the eighth emperor. And his nature, his characteristics, his manner of life, his way of life is of &gt;&gt; the seven kings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you say something is off. I'm of brother one. Brother one is of me. Right. Sister is of &gt;&gt; brother one. So even he is the eighth the beast that has always that is and is not and yet is brother said that's the pop &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; even he is the eighth the eighth emperor &gt;&gt; b of the servant let me read a quote and then we'll close in mark of the beast paragraph uh 20 thank you for your time mark of the beast paragraph I will leave the rest of the quote paragraph 254 4. I don't know if they can bring it out together. If they can bring it out, we read it together. It'll be so beautiful. Paragraph 254 of this mark of the beast. Look at what brother Rana was teaching in 1954. when people thought even to today some people believe that brother was not educated something he said he came out of uh came out of ignorance came out of this brother if anybody was intelligent and brilliant in church he was brother &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; so 254 mark 540513 if they can bring it up I would really appreciate it Now he will take the history and go right back and show it. Let me be slow a little bit. Yes, I'm looking at the time. If we will take history, He will take the history and go right back and show it where the kings had fallen in Rome since the Babylon religion. Brother say one is and in bracket he put Nero emperor N E R O Emperor Nero. One is remember the Bible say there are seven kings five are falling one is in bracket the prophecy that one is is Nero according to this book all right and one is to come and he must continue a short space remember Nero also burnt to Rome and laid the and held the Christian responsible for for for burning Rome meanwhile he was the one that did it &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; Amen in the little documentary that you know I saw of him one time he was crying and maybe when room was burnt or something he was crying and he took a small bottle and he allows some tears to drop in that bottle he like say this one is for this and he said and this one is for that mean people that life doesn't mean anything right people that can suck out human brain and chew it raw behind curtains One is Nero and one is to come and he must continue a short space about 6 months when he comes and the beasts. Oh brother say oh look at this he said now the power is going to take the pagan place the beast that is that was and is not. Brother said hallelujah. He said even he is the eight but he's of the seven. The prophecy said do you say he's going to take the pagan place? The only difference right between the legs of iron and the feet of iron met with clay. The only difference is that a church has been built on that power. &gt;&gt; That's the only difference. &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit. It's the same power. Nothing has changed &gt;&gt; now. Now God Almighty that office with the Pope God saw it as one his own office &gt;&gt; said the kings come this one does this and does that he's gone he said but this one does not change and he will not change until Jesus come it must be pope in that office that's why the bible call it one the eth because one go another come inside one he say that power is going to take the pagan place paganism at the Beginning he say beganism at the end only today it has assumed the name of a church. God bless you church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. From nearer nearer bless to the cross where thou hast done. &gt;&gt; Draw me nearer, pastor. Nearer. Bless the Lord to the preious bleed in [Music] a bless to the cross where thou hast thou Draw me near. Draw near a blesser Lord to thy preious bleeding side. Consecrate me now. on St. [Music] Lord by the power of grace divine. Let my soul look up. Let my soul open up with a steadfast hope. Let my will be lost in. Oh Lord, draw me near the air. How blessed Lord to thy cross where thou hast gone. Oh drawing nearer, nearer of blessed Lord to thy preious living. Praise the Lord. Let me say this tonight and just encourage you. We thank the Lord for the word. It was beautiful word. Amen. I wish we had enough time for our brother to continue but uh just one word is enough. Amen. Uh sufficient of the dead is the evil dead. But let me say this and just encourage you tonight. you know uh that uh uh paganism that idolatry that has gone throughout the ages and uh uh that that has been the cause of every denomination. Every move of God was corrupted by that uh uh paganism power by that idolatry power. What we must re remember God called Abraham from out of idolatry. Our father Abraham the father of faith was called out of idolatry until we get out of here. One of the thing we will fight is idolatry because it's easy to idolize anything. That's the reason why don't just take I'm in the message. You could idolize this message and and be far from God. You could idolize brother Brandham and you still don't have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. You are just under a religion. That's the reason why we must meet the person of Christ. You must be a show of your new birth. You must be assure of what God is doing in your life. Don't be satisfied to say I'm in the message. I was baptized in Jesus name. The devil knows that better than you. He have corrupted men that have had experience with God. Paganism is very strong. It's very very strong. And there's a bunch of it around this message. A bunch of it around this message. Those are the things that are bringing all the abuses because that's what it came from. Paganism. In Paganism, it was it was torture. All of Christianity is abuse. That's why we must have a personal experience with God. Our experience must be a living experience. Now, oh, I believe the message 20 years ago. I believe the message five years I was baptized. All of those things are wonderful. &gt;&gt; But Christ is a living Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today. He must be living. Your experience with God must be living. Oh, now when I was in Liberia, when I was in Jerusalem, when I was in this place, uh, oh, I used to do this. It must be a present tense because it's very easy for people to go into idolatry. When Luther came, he was the move of God, but the Lutherans took his that move of God, they took it into idolatry and they go right back to Catholism. The same thing with John Wesley. The same thing with the Pentecostals. I'm not afraid to say the same thing around this message. I'm not afraid to say it because I've seen it. We idolize everything. [Music] It's in the fabric of religion. Idolatry is in the fabric of religion. That's where God took our father Abraham from. [Music] Let's bow our hands together tonight. Lord, I want to love you more than I ever have before. [Music] You so easy to adore. Lord, I want to love you more. Oh Lord, I want to love you more. I really want to love you, Father, with all of my heart, with all of my soul, with all of my mind, Lord. Father, I just don't want to be satisfied with a church. I just don't want to be satisfied, Lord. I just don't want to come just beyond the a covering. I'm in the message and I really don't have an experience with you. I want to love you more. I want to know you in the power of your resurrection. That power that can change, that power that can break habits, that power that can deliver. Father, we thank you for your word tonight. What a word, Lord. What a word on Wednesday night, Father God. Lord Jesus, I was sitting there and I was just thinking in my mind, what a spiritual warfare, oh God, that we have been honored. If the people only have an idea, even this city Minneapolis that you are in, the idolatry that is done in this city, this is a big uh gale city uh trans uh the whole uh trans thing, they have a big headquarter here. The spirit that waring in this city, don't play with your prayer life. Don't don't we must not just chase after the wind. Let's get some substance. Let's get some substance that when everything fail, the only thing that will not fail. [Music] Father, we thank you for your word tonight, Lord. It's an eye opener, Lord God. It's you send that word to to awaken us, Lord Jesus. Oh God, I just love it when you do things like that, Father. When you come back, Lord, and try to wake us out of our slumbering, Lord God, Father, Lord, oh precious Lord Jesus, I pray tonight, oh God, that Father, oh God, you would just you would just deal with every one of us. We, this message will go home with us tonight. it will go home with us tonight. Father Lord God, when we get down to the to the pillows on our bed, bring something back to our mind. Something Lord God, Father, Lord, that will encourage us. Something that will challenge us, Lord. Something that will put us on our need and say, "Lord, I want to love you more. I want a reality of you, oh God. I just don't want to be, Father God. just just I I I I don't want to just be satisfied to say I'm I'm in the message. I believe Brother Brandham as a prophet, but I want that pillow of fire in my heart. I want a living Christ in my heart. Dear father, we pray to God that you take us home, Lord Jesus. And once again, Father, Lord, bless your people. They have to go to work tomorrow, Lord. Some of our students back to school. We just ask for special grace and blessing upon their lives. Father God, we pray Lord until we meet here Sunday morning. Come Lord God and and be with each and every one of us. So Father keep us Lord God in everything that we about to do. Oh we just love you tonight father. May the Holy Ghost just uh have his way tonight. We thank you. We appreciate you. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can stand on your feet tonight. I am covered. I'm walking by faith. Let's sing that and be dismissed. You have a safe travel home. Have a good night's sleep and have a blessed rest of your week.
