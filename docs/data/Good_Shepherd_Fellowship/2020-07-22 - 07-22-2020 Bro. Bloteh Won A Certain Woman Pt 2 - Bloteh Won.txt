glad to be back in the house of the lord this wednesday evening praise the lord and what can we say about the weekend amen what can we say about our special anniversary service on sunday we can all say praise be to the lord can we give the lord a hand of praise amen praise the lord thank you all for making this special and we want to thank the lord also for making it more special amen praise the lord because uh he was the special one that showed himself in our midst through the word and through the service we are so grateful praise the lord there are few things that stuck out to me during the service i will that's what i want to talk about tonight and maybe use something one of them for the for the little bible studies we will call it that way uh i will be capping up on something that i preach a couple of wednesdays ago and uh by the way brother farmer asked me to bring his greetings and he appreciate the hospitality that you gave him so you want to [Music] say that he got back home safely that's what he said and uh he uh looking forward another time if the lord will lead him this way praise the lord so we thank the lord for that um one of the things that stood out to me was uh uh the tip we play the tip we played it if uh uh some of you uh that don't know brother uh but one you will know that uh or for those that know him too you will know that i mean when he got up dancing and all of that it was not actually his makeup you know you would know that it was not his makeup uh he's uh he's a kind of a private man in some way you know but i just believe that was the lord and then one of the things that caught my my mind too was that on the tip we play brother brandon begins that tape talking about dancing in the spirit he began that tip talking about when he when he he was very critical of people dancing in church he said he was very critical he couldn't he couldn't really affect it together when people get emotionally movingly aborted and all of that well you have to know he's he's from the baptist background and so uh he he was very critical of that he said until uh one day in his own tabernacle there was a lady that was uh was singing a special also but she got down to the dancing floor with her dancing shoes on praising the lord and he he said he sat back and he started thinking how can she do that in the house of the lord you know he was just thinking about that and trying to you know place it in the scripture and all of that and he says before he realized he himself he was on the floor dancing with the woman in the spirit praise the lord so i saw something like that with brother prater when we went to liberia i can still remember we were down in hebel having a service there that night and it was an evening you know no light we are using lanterns and and after the service the same started singing i'll see you in the rapture you know and it's not it's not the you know it's not just the chorus the chorus in a sense the the uh as one singing it as a special you know uh with the kind of uh instrument that they play they are very fast sinking people so instead of sinking and i see you in the rapture you know and then he took the tambourine he got he got preaching he done preaching that night he took the tamarind and i saw him knocking the timber in before i knew his feet was left from under him and he was all over the place praise the lord amen you cannot impersonate that you can never impersonate someone dancing in the spirit if you try to do like them you will hurt yourself because when the lord get a hold of a person that's what happened that was one of the things that stood out to me in the service you know to realize that brother branham just spoke on that you know in that tip that we're listening to and yeah we said at the end of the service the lord kind of blessed us with that praise the lord and uh and the next thing that stood out to me in the in the service would pretty much be something i would want to to go back to tonight so uh sister faith if you help me just put up that quote uh have there from only believe that was the message we're listening to we believe before we read the scripture tonight i just want to read that quote because that's where my inspiration or my encouragement my bible said whatever the law would lead us to do tonight this is where we were taken from brother branham says yeah he says now put your hands down this was right in the prayer line when he was about getting in the prayer line or getting to pray for the sick let me call it like that he says put your hands down now what did that little woman do she touched his garment she got down there too late to get a prayer card we did say he said in our language if we would compare jesus meeting with our meeting we would say she got there too late to get a prayer card but she touched his government she got healed just the same as the little girl got her spirit drew back that was jairus daughter but the woman got healed before jairus daughter but in the way that brother branham is saying a year he's he's comparing something because you have to realize jairos intentionally went to call jesus because his daughter was not well and this woman in the crowd when jesus was going in you know and and i mean in the crowd she pressed her way to touch so brother branham is comparing uh jesus praying for jairus daughter which of course by the laying on of hands or calling her spirit back to her body he's comparing the same with the woman that live leap out by faith to touch his garment he says the same with jairus daughter got a result the woman also got a result praise the lord whether he lay hands on her or whether she touched him they was both jews or jewish so whether she touched him or the dead girl couldn't couldn't touch him so he had to touch the dead girl so you can touch him tonight he's the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities praise the lord do you believe that we can touch him tonight let's go to the lord in prayer and i will show you what i'm coming to tonight heavenly father lord jesus we we just want to commit this service in your hands and we pray that father you will come down lord and and and bless the inspiration that is on our hearts tonight you are wonderful you are sovereign in your ways so god we just commit ourself now lord for service for speaking and for yearing oh god you come father lord take over the service lord father because we realize lord jesus you are our audience tonight you are the one looking down upon us we ask the lord you will give us all the reference that we need father to be able god to to create an atmosphere where you can come out of the pages of your word you can instruct us tonight father god you can bless us in your presence we love you we love you father in jesus name we pray amen amen well you say brother one we have not read the scripture tonight so uh if we will read the scripture tonight then let's stand on our feet and then we can read numbers chapter 15 praise the lord number chapter 15 numbers chapter 15 let's read verse 38 verse 38 number 39 verse 40 verse 41 verse 30 is speak unto the children of israel and beg them that they make them french in the borders of their government throughout their generation and that they put upon the french of the border a raven of blue praise the lord amen and it shall be unto you for the french ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that year seek not after your own heart or your own eyes after which you use to go a whoring that ye may remember and do all the commandments and be holy unto our god i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god amen the lord bless you you may have your seat so let's go back to that quote again then we will we will get going tonight praise the lord the lord has promised to be our help so we know he would definitely help us brother branham said yeah this is the thing that caught my attention now you you just think about it we we're listening to the tape and we write in uh about in the prayer line and and just like i said every one of us paying attention because i listened to the entire tip through the night when i got home and uh but i never caught that until during the service because like i said there was such an atmosphere that was created here and i would want to use that and encourage you that when we are playing tapes for the sunday school it is not just because we don't have no subject for sunday school just like i said on sunday those tapes the benefit of those tapes is the atmosphere that they carry they are they are teaching materials in those steps they are things that when you listen and and train yourself to constantly listening to brother branham there are things that you would pick up they are things that uh uh i mean that i i've had that i don't know whether uh people have experienced that but brother farmer was also telling me you know something like that you know you you you you you listening to a tip it looks like you have heard something and you show it's on the tape you go back you play it you you can't find it you know he says wow but i thought he said that you know i had one of those things one night and i just couldn't sleep i had to play it and play it go back and read word for word but but so i just want to encourage you whether you are home or whether you are you are in the building whenever we are playing the uh the tape for sunday school concentrate listing we don't get to play an entire message uh uh we uh uh just uh play a portion for that time of the sunday school but there is a reason why uh we we feel led to go that way and and most of the tips sometimes that we will we will ask brother jordan to play is it's a tape where sometimes we are getting the inspiration from that we try to preach a message so if you go back and listen to those tapes you realize that uh you know we are trying to stay just in line with the scriptures just in line with what the messenger has taught us so we encourage you uh you can play tips at home i you know uh you know you hear people i don't come to church to listen to table i can play them home and sometimes those people that says those things never play tapes they never play tips and i just think it's an arrogant spirit if a person says that and behave like that now so i'm sitting there and i'm listening and uh uh another thing again i will go over to say uh the uh we we all know now that is by law that we have to wear match now in minnesota you know is is now by law the governor has passed that past that so we have to we have to guide ourself as we go about and [Music] you know so i mean thank god that we try to require ourselves to do it as a church before is it have now become a statement that we have to we have to wear max i got out of the gas station this morning and i just saw you know max is required right at the pump i said max is required to pump gas you know i did i never i didn't yet you know i didn't even though i heard it on on the news that people were going to to you know the governor was thinking to to to talk about it and then so i was going inside to get something so i took my max and i wore in you know and just like that so we just want to remind you that it is now something that is you know instructed by elijah where is your max okay go and the beacons will give you one so this is what caught my attention brother branham says yeah he says they was both jewish that caught my attention you know why i caught my attention because when i was preaching the message on the setting woman i tapped the woman as a gentile and the reason why i type her as a gentile it is because of what leviticus said so let's turn to the book of leviticus let's go over the notes so that caught my attention praise the lord and i just wrote i just wrote a phrase then i said i have to look at this because brother branham used this over and over most of the time in the prayer line he has never associated whether a jew or the gentile or the samaritan he had never associated so when when when he said that on the tape it caught my attention i see i have to look at this close so let's look at that tonight leviticus chapter 15. leviticus chapter 15. now this this was the reason this was our inspiration while we talked and and again uh you'll see in many places where brother branham talks about god using the gift and the individual using the gift he types it in both ways brother branham says when when when when jesus went to the the the tomb of lazarus he went there by a vision it was god that was using the gift he went there by the vision and he told the disciples lazarus slipped he went there and he said lazarus come forth and lazarus came forth listen to the brother branham says he called lazarus from from death and that you never even left him that you never even left him he said but that woman when she touched so she was the one that was using the gift she was the one that was pulling on the gift when she touched the ham of his garment he fell weak but when he said lazarus come forth and lazarus came i mean nothing happened to him because he went there by a vision he went there by the vision and and like brother branham said if he never said lazarus come forth it was going to be a general resurrection and and and and many what comes from the grave and all the dead sins who have come from the grave and he will have not stayed fair weak why because it was god that was using the gift so when you use the gift when you put on the gift when when you are inspired it draws strength from god praise the lord now so you will see many places where brother branham talks about that and and in the way that he talks about it you you realize that many times when he talks about uh the roma centering okay he talks about a roman centurion which was a gentile he talks about the gentile faith the expression of the gentile faith just speak a word my seven would be healed if i touched the ham of his garment i would be you know he says like like paul says the the the jews secret signs the greek are after knowledge so the jews the the the jews the love sign so brother branham talks about the laying on of hands the law of the laying on of hands but when he compared with the gentile faith well speak the word just say a word my seven will be healed so most of the time brother branham put the gentile faith to an action are we together now so you see uh uh uh that that woman expressing saying in her heart if i touch the ham of his garment okay leviticus chapter 15 tonight i know i have a way of just going in cycles and the time will be gone let's read verse 19 we just pick up some few verses verse 19 and if a woman have an issue and her issue in her flesh be blood she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever touched her shall be unclean until the evening praise the lord let's drop down verse 25. and if a woman have an issue of her blood for of a blood many days out of the time of her separation which means after she have crossed the seven days when she noticed it she should separate herself for seven days but after she has crossed the seven days which is the time of separation and she continued to experience this blood issue or if it runs beyond the time of her separation all the days of her issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation she shall be unclean what is saying here is that the moment she goes across that seventh day now she will stay unclean until they can figure out what is happening praise the lord if she if she feels uh she has an issue of blood the first day she must separate herself after that first day now in our term we would say current thing she was guaranteeing herself so after after the seven days she can step out she's free if the blood issue does not continue but if the blood issue continues after the seven days she must stay separated she must stay quarantined until they can figure out what is going on with her praise the lord if it is just only one day it happens she have to stay until seventh days there is something you you will notice in the book of leviticus when you read it is either seven days you will have to separate yourself and the time that you will be accepted in the congregation was the evening time it's a very beautiful thing when you read uncleanness in in the book of leviticus wherever the form of uncleanness you have to be separated for seven days if the priest will pronounce you to be clean it has to be in the evening time so evening time message has brought some cleaning for us [Laughter] amen it was one of the things i enjoy studying the book of leviticus it's been a while so so this was the thing that caught my attention if this woman had a blood issue for 12 years that's what the bible is saying amen if she had a blood issue for 12 years you will see there are places also in a message where brother branham in in the prayer line he descended the needs of some women compare it with that woman he typed it to to menopause that i can show you the code there's a place where he he types that in as well and and and and all of that now you we we would take that as an inspiration of the prophet praise the lord because there's a difference like i've said to you before there's a difference between interpretation and inspiration as as a minister as a preacher i have the right to inspiration because that's what the scripture says praise the lord that the scripture is given by inspiration that the man of god should be equipped but i'm not an interpreter of the scripture there is one person that has a legal right to interpret the scripture is given to the prophets so i can use this leviticus uh 15 that we have just read i can preach a message from there another person can come and preach another message and use a different title it's all inspiration praise the lord but when a person starts to say the scripture means this then we have to pay attention we have to pay attention because that that now becomes interpretation praise the lord so uh uh just i'm just kind of reminding you i know we talked about it before now so uh reading this like i said looking at the woman having a blood issue for 12 years looking at what leviticus said if she was an obedient jewish woman she would have to separate herself are you seeing the picture praise the lord i don't know whether it went over your head when i was preaching it but that's what i was saying if she was uh had this blood issue for 12 years now the gentiles did not knew that custom they never had the lord of moses so the way a gentile woman would treat her blood issue is different from the way a jewish woman would treat her blood issue are we together praise the lord i mean things are crossing my head and i don't want to go into it amen i want to stay right here i don't know what is your questions that are crossing my head but i want to stay right here praise the lord amen now so you can see where i i got that inspiration from if the blood issue is 12 years and she should be separated then i don't believe that she can be a an israelite or a jewish woman she has to be a gentile and moreover she's she's having a gentle attitude because the jewish attitude is to fall before him and says master touch me that's that's the jewish approach the gentile approach is expressing it by faith are we together praise the lord now but when the prophet comes and says they're both for jewish definitely it gets your attention it catches your attention as and as a preacher it gives you sleepless nights it gives you sleepiest night praise the lord because you have to look at that subject very well you can either be arrogant and stick to your thoughts or you can be humble and come back to the word of god praise the lord so so what i did was i decided to go back and look at the subject and and again what what caught my mind i just think it was the law that was that was helping me because i had a subject on my mind i was listening to uh uh i was listening to something and uh i was listening to to a commentary from uh from from uh a jewish guy uh or he he i mean he said he knows the hebrew so he was talking about isaiah chapter six you know isaiah chapter says what the bible say his strength filled the temple okay that word his strength that word train means it means show it means shown and it also that and the word shown means bother it has the same application with the border on the hem of the garment so when he said that because i was listening to the book of isaiah when he said that it caught my attention i said no i have to look into this i have to look into this there is something about the ham of his garment that i have to look into let's look into matthew chapter 14. let's look into matthew chapter 14 oh man praise the lord i know you miss your old church being at home i know you miss the comfort of your old church praise the lord and i maybe your pastor at the time was nice you have to bear with me praise the lord what did i say as i i mean uh matthew chapter 14 praise the lord are we together matthew chapter 14. amen amen amen let's read from verse 31 matthew chapter 14 let's read from verse 31 this was very very very important this scripture came very handy and was very important to help me and immediately jesus stretched for his hands and cut him that speeded and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore they doubt doubt and when they were come into the ship the wayne sees then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou are the son of god and when they were gone over they came into the land of jenna syria and when the man of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all the country around about and brought unto him all that what disease and besought him that they that they might only touch the ham of his garment so the woman other word i mean that woman with a blood issue was not the only person that touched the ham of jesus coming now it makes the subject interesting now it makes the subject interesting praise the lord i love it when it's like this because i know i'm all into your spirit now i'm all into your mind [Laughter] i love it when i just get you on the hook like this you know i can just wind you in [Laughter] praise the lord amen and besought him that they might only touch the ham of his garment and as many as many as many as many as touch we may perfectly hold now in the mouth of two or three that's that's word that's that's a scriptural principle if we can find another scripture to back what the scripture says a proof that is not a unique event that's what i want to bring to you and because it was not a unique event there was some significance to the harm of his garment are we together because it was not a unique event so there is a significance to the ham of his gaming praise the lord so just like i said the reason why i'm looking into this and and and and going this way is because the the prophet by inspiration has has driven my my thought to look at it barbara was he was not teaching it was not teaching that brother branham was doing he was in the prayer line he was about to pray for people and we all sat here the first person that he called out was brother farmer's dad but he was preparing the minds of the people that you don't have to have a prayer a prayer card to be prayed for just like the woman of the word just like jared's daughter they both were jews or jewish are we together praise the lord so that's the reason why sister fed up uh entitled dead a setting woman i want to make it a part two of that message so i can be able to anybody listening to it and listening to the part two can be able to understand that uh we progress [Laughter] whenever the word opened to us we progress praise the lord don't you love the lord for them amen we love the lord for death as many as touch were made perfectly whole now we read our scripture reading that we read uh this evening was numbers chapter 15. let's go back to numbers chapter 15. because this is going to be interesting praise the lord amen i have welcomed you on the flight please take your seatbelt praise the lord i'm believing that the the flight to now will not be bumpy amen so back in numbers chapter 15 verse 38 speak to the children of israel tell them to make a torso on the corner of their garment throughout their generation it was something that they were supposed to wear throughout their generation amen and and and another thing we can put we can we can attach to this is that uh uh what am i reading speak to the children of israel so we realize here that this was not just for the priesthood this was for all of the children of israel male and female it was it was for them it was supposed to be something that they should put on their garmin are we together praise the lord let's continue to look at that closely all the children of israel and they must wear it all through their generations this was not just only an exit address this was something that every clothes that they buy they have to get a blue ribbon and and make make a border they have to make a border we'll call it like a hem you know like the way you hand hem the the clothes like this you know just like here the thread in the end at the at the end they have to make a border of of of their clothes so uh uh let's continue to read they also have to put a blue ribbon they have to put a blue ribbon to make a french at the border of their garment throughout their generation and that they pulled the french of the border a ribbon of blue you know uh blue you know is is uh is uh it's it's they call it like a heavenly color you know like the clouds you know the heaven the color in any way but let's go i will not dwell on the color and it shall be unto you for a french that ye may look upon it and remember so they were to they were to face their clothes like that so when they are traveling they can look down when they look down and the eyes get on the blue their minds remember so god giving them a way to remind them when they look down on that then they remember the commandments of god are we together we see over there in detroit the bible says they must write it upon the their doorposts put it upon their bed and you know so so the word of god can be part of them so when you go to work and they are in the field and they are applauding and whatever they are doing when they look down to the border of of of their garment they can remember the commandments of the lord so even if a man is in the field and he's working and maybe they try to argue of us and his eyes get on the border of the garment he remember the commandments of the lord that he has to love his brother praise the lord now you have to we have to remind ourselves to know they did not have the indwelling of the holy ghost they had the holy ghost but they never had the indwelling of the holy ghost and that's one of the things that jesus said the comforter will do it will do what it will remind you of those things that i have said and because they never had the indwelling of the spirit now god is has designed a way for them to remind himself praise the lord and even we that have the indwelling of the holy ghost how much we need to design ways to remind ourselves to be able to meditate upon the word of god remind ourselves to pray remind ourselves of the things that we are taught praise the lord because if you don't remind yourself it slips away amen that's why we take notes down in church to remind ourselves because you have to realize that your mind is a battleground don't ever tell yourself say oh i'm listening whatever they are saying i'm keeping it in my mind you are just lying your mind is a battleground even when you sit in church the devil is blasting your mind with things the preacher is saying one thing and you're paying attention before you realize your mind is caught up your mind is flying all over the place so if the word means something to you find a way to remind yourself so when you go away from church you can be able to return back to that landmark they say yeah this thing was said okay yeah praise the lord are we together young people and all we have cell phones we have alpha we have the the quotes and scripture all posted on on the wall so i mean we just we just come to church flying hands but you have to know that that is technology if there is no light we still going to preach we just the deacons just have to run down to walmart and buy or candle we're not going to say oh there is no light to the current gun tonight since let's just go home and sleep no praise the lord you remember the other night we were having a prayer meeting right in there in the cycle the light went off there was a ton of storm that came we still had our prayer meeting so that was the purpose for them to remind themselves to remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that yes seek not after your own heart the heart is desperately wicked our society today said believe your heart follow your mind but god is commanding them do that so when you see it you can look for a scripture to remember because that's that is that is uh that is the suicide that thing keeps coming back to my mind because it keeps coming back you you tell yourself that that is the thing i should do because it keeps coming to my mind and you never ask yourself whether it's it's according to the word of god it just keeps coming to my mind so i just feel like i should do it because if it was wrong it would stop coming back to my you don't have control over your mind brother branham says you don't have no thought coming you don't have no thought coming it sounds as simple but it's true and it's powerful and everything they have to do with your life even your decision for work your decision for going home and going to bed tonight you don't have no thought coming if you are thinking to do right there is a source of inspiration that that thought is coming from god is responsible for that channel of good thoughts that are coming to your mind as much as the devil is responsible for the channel of evil thoughts that are coming to your mind your mind is just a battleground it's no man's land but god has given you a shotgun of faith and you can use that shotgun of faith and blow all the scarecrow away from your mind blow all the devil evil thoughts from your mind he says look at the blue ribbon so you remember the promise of god that you will not follow your heart you will not follow your own your own thought but your mind will constantly go back to the promises of god your mind will constantly go back and that's what i encourage the young people memorize scripture memorize scripture memorizing scripture helps to keep your mind positive because if if if you just if you are you just catch yourself in the place and says oh where my memory verse today as use as you try to go back in your mind to grab that memory verse the holy ghost comes down and start kicking all those evil thoughts out of your mind because your channel wants to get the word of god memory verses has healed people that have memory loss people that have memory loss that quick to forget let me say this way quick to forget where's my purse where's my key where is my spoon where's my cup i'm drinking from praise the lord it's right in their hands and looking for it is anyone in the house yeah my hand says my hands off i'm the one are we together you see how how god works he brings out one thing and he opens the door for many things he caught my attention on that it just opened the floor gates for many things i mean there are a lot of things that i went into reading and studying i was just so blessed let's finish our scripture tonight well brother steve you have not got the clock on tonight so we're preaching until we are done praise the lord that you seek now after your own heart and your eye and your own eyes after which you use to go warring you means it's after you look around you know all the things that you see the us you know comes together to settle down in your mind you know and the devil used those things you know to to you know try to put our mind on things you know that we hear and things that we see and all of that so you can you can just you can just trust your heart you know use the word to remind yourself praise the lord amen is talking to one of mine my gals in and i was you know uh just conversing and talking as a slog i mean they are just this this bible it just falls it's filled with with with i mean pretty praises when people just get caught to the place where the the the thing that what people say about them is what matters know what god says about you praise the lord that's what matters he's the one that said you are fearfully and wonderfully made i'll never leave you i will never forsake you what what a comfort people we people don't find comfort in god's word because they don't spend time in god's word if you spend time in his word and his promises another benefit of reading the word meditating upon the word is those those words that you have read and you meditating upon it it comes back to you as voices that is the reason why god commanded his children you know if if a man has a vision or has a dream or said the lord has spoken unto them what he asked him to do bring it back to the word because god only speaks his words to you his promises to you that ye may remember and do all the commandments and be holy unto your god so that was the importance of that blue ribbon that they put on the ham of their garden praise the lord and they were to wear it throughout all their generation and i wish i would prove it to you because jesus came and he rebuked jesus rebuked the pharisees matthew chapter 10 23 let's look at that 23 uh matthew 23 verse 5 i became beginning to stumble matthew 23 verse 5 i'm i'm almost left with seven minutes here so i have to speed yeah machu 33 but all their works they do fall to be seen of men this is jesus rebuking the pharisees why you know why because the pharisees have they took that that simple commandment that god gave them they were now making a faction they made their borders big they had all sorts of different design in it amen something that's supposed to be just simple simple blue strap to remind yourself they're not making a faction i mean they had to go to embroidery and you know and and design it and and this man have to show how much he paid do you know how much i pay for mine so it was something the wall all through their generation but here is the religious people now and and as generation goes by they're weakened on the word of god they turn the word of god into faction so jesus rebuking that generation you are gone away from the principle it's supposed to be at the ham of your garment they will come they put blue stripes down your undergarment they put another one yet again they put another one yet again just show men's shape the darker red themselves with blue uh a border all on the addresses and they are not even thinking on the word of god they are not even meditating on the word of god praise the lord the word corrects the error and he was the word for that day so he could pick it up immediately and correct the error are we together praise the lord are we together and my brother branham talks yeah i believe that this he used he used another uh uh talking here about aaron aaron uh a garmin that he used to go in the holiest of holy now this this really does not fully apply to what we are saying but it kind of forced my mind a little bit believe that this era when he uh went into the holy so holy once a year he had to wear a certain kind of government he and and he and he had to be anointed he had to take blood with him is that right and on the ham of his garden he had pomegranate and a bell now even the priest himself he had that he had that uh uh pomegranate embelled but he also had a blue ribbon so as he's going into the holiest of holy he's taking step he's looking down remembering the promise of god because he knows if he goes into that present with any kind of a corrupt mind or corrupt ill feeling he's going to die so as he goes the belt is ringing he keep his eyes dead and and and he read a promise and he takes another step he keeps his eyes there he read a promise just like that because he has to keep his mind on the lord are we together praise the lord praise the lord now the ham of his garment or the ham of the garment because we have gone beyond jesus's garment now we're talking about aaron's garment here going into the holiest of holy he has to keep his eyes on it that because the word of god was attached to the heart of their garment it had very very very important significance remember because of time first samuel chapter 15 what happened in first samuel chapter 15 was when samir told saul samuel last word to saul there because he have disobeyed god god has rejected him what they saw they he reached out the bible says for the ham of samuel garmin and when he reached out and told it what the samuel said to him that just how the lord has done your kingdom praise the lord first time you're chapter 24 first samuel chapter 24 will bring us to the place of david running away from saul and just like we we talk about it when we when we spoke on the beauty and the beast if you can remember david had an opportunity and the bible says the lord put a deep sleep on saul and david stepped in there and he took the ham of salt garment and he cut it praise the lord that was also important when david did that praise the lord when david did that amen let me just let me just try to find a place here because it was very important you remember in that in that story david repented to saw because because they knew what the importance is i was as i was studying even uh it was it was a sign of separation it was a sign of divorce if a man was angry with his wife in those days he could take the ham of her garment and just cut it she knew exactly what was happening when he did that so that that that is the kind of a weight he had and the reason is because god attached his word to the harm of their garment he says put that blue ribbon there to be able to remember my word so the entire world the entire promise of god was was was uh was right there for them to be able to remember i mean there have to be something for them to remember so i believe they read the the torah or they went to to the temple and whatever the preacher read from the torah when it goes into the field and goes into their work when they look at the arabian they tried to remember the service they tried to remember what they read they tried to remember even the little ones tried to remember the the the scripture that mama read to them it was something that god commanded them to do in all their generation now see another beautiful part here that that caught my attention also was malacca chapter four oh man malachi chapter 4 praise the lord malachi chapter four are we together i'll read verse two but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings now this healing in his wings let me read a quote here for you then i will get into what i want to say uh what is the attraction on the mountain i've been looking uh used this quote many times but when i was setting for what is the attraction on your mountain then i saw it again so let's read this together what is the attraction on on the mountain do i have that there is a fake okay let's read that brother branham said he's reading that he's reading the very scripture that we we just read he says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing campaigns healing in healing in his wings he said healing campaigns because what wings does a fly all over so healing campaigns was all over praise the lord that's what wings does it fly everywhere so the son of righteousness rise in our bay with healing campaigns because there were healing meetings all over seven times with healing campaigns healing in his wings now that word wins the word wins means bother and the word wings also apply to the hem of the garment because the hem of their garment was the border of their skirt it was the wings of their garment praise the lord now so you see because the the the the seraphim in uh uh uh isaiah chapter six the reason why isaiah the prophet disrupted as his stream filled the temple because their wings blended together and it was in a tree it was in a train form just like this going around that's the reason why brother branham says in ezekiel it was like the wheels in the middle of the wheels he says a revelation chapter 4 series he says the same angel those cherubim from eden he says it spoke from the beginning the redemption of the church he said that was the church traveling that was the protection of the church throughout the ages there in there it was in eden at the beginning of the church he says in revelation those same angels were found before the throne of god so in god's mind the church has already arrived home are we together so those wings of the angels are the mother healing in his wings if they have the same significance then you can see why these people wanted to touch the ham of his garment because they believed they were healing in the wings of his curse we just love the lord amen musicians you can come for tonight it's just afraid if we can try that song if i could touch the ham of his garmin what are you down on that side no let him play the best it helps if i could but touch that i'm of his government if i could touch some part of his clothes i know i'll be here my saints are forgiven if i could but touch him i know i'll be home praise the lord let's try if i could touch the hem of his government if i could just touch some part of his clothes yes i know i'll be here [Music] my saints are forgiven yes

just bow our heads together praise the lord do you feel like just reaching out and touching his garment tonight reach out and touch the lord let's sing that as we just meditate upon his word [Music] you think about it now jesus came to that setting they say lord we don't want you to pray for us they brought all the sick people they said just touch the ham of his garment because they know the son of righteousness has rise with healing in his wings reach out and touch the lord as he goes by oh reach out and touch the lord [Music] yes and touch the savior i see go are we reaching out tonight reach out and touch the lord [Music] is not too busy to hear your [Music] retry and touch the law as he goes by you have to know it was the faith of the woman that was the emphasis of brother branham
