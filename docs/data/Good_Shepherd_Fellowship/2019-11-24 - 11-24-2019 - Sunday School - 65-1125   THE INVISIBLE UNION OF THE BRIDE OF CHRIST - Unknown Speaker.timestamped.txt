[0:35] Daltry I'm speaking of the natural now
[0:38] to type it with the spiritual
[0:40] if this woman would commit such a sin
[0:43] then she is more an adulteress if she
[0:47] has two living husbands at the same time
[0:50] therefore she has sparked at it by doing
[0:53] this her rights to God and heaven by
[0:58] doing so much she sure has
[0:59] she is an outcast from the economy of
[1:02] God according to the Scriptures and I've
[1:05] just read so is the church when she
[1:08] tries to mix creed and denomination with
[1:11] the Word of God
[1:12] she can't be married to a denomination
[1:20] the others I'm all set so here plenty of
[1:25] oils and God's Word and that's his law
[1:28] Paul speaking the same thing here she
[1:31] cannot be married to a church of worthy
[1:34] Creed and be the Bride of Christ because
[1:37] she one is contrary to them I remember
[1:43] say what we believe this but we don't
[1:44] believe that if you're married to Christ
[1:47] Christ is the word of God in st. John
[1:51] the first chapter said in the beginning
[1:54] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:55] in the Word was God and the same was
[2:00] made flesh into all the movement Christ
[2:03] was the Living Word he always was the
[2:07] word he's still the word she always will
[2:10] be the word
[2:12] he was only the manifestation of the
[2:15] attributes of God for he was the son of
[2:19] God in any son is the attributes of his
[2:22] father and just as you were in the genes
[2:26] of your father in the body of your
[2:29] father when he was a young boy you were
[2:33] in him yet he could not have fellowship
[2:35] with you because he didn't know you but
[2:38] then through the bedding grounds of a
[2:40] mother you were brought forth into the
[2:42] earth and become in the image of your
[2:45] father then we can fellowship with you
[2:47] and so you sons of God and daughters of
[2:52] God before there even for you are only
[3:03] the physical manifestations of the
[3:06] attributes that was in God at the
[3:08] beginning or there's only one form of
[3:10] eternal life and that was you before you
[3:13] don't know us at about it didn't you
[3:14] know when yours in your earthly father
[3:16] but you're a manifested in his image in
[3:21] the image of God you are made and you
[3:24] were manifested for the glory and the
[3:27] fellowship of God and therefore as short
[3:31] as your gene had to be in your father
[3:34] before your natural birth your spiritual
[3:37] James had to be in God because you're an
[3:39] expression of the attributes of his
[3:42] thoughts before the foundation of the
[3:43] world
[3:45] no way around it's right now now we
[3:49] notice that life being in you God life
[3:56] being in you from the foundation of the
[4:00] world
[4:00] now now you cannot mix denomination
[4:07] greed with the word becauseyou're -
[4:10] contrary one to the other that's exactly
[4:13] what Satan tried to do with his
[4:15] intellectual conceptions to eat
[4:17] he said he admitted that God said it but
[4:20] it said surely you'll not die see and
[4:24] they believed that and that's what Creed
[4:26] has done tonight denomination that
[4:30] separated the people from the Word of
[4:33] God didn't Jesus say when he comes you
[4:35] through your traditions have made the
[4:38] commandments of God of no effect to the
[4:41] people that you are free
[4:44] we have dissociated the fellowship of
[4:49] the holy spirit to anoint the Word of
[4:52] God that's laced out for this generation
[4:54] we have separated the people so far
[4:57] denomination that they cannot have a
[4:59] chance to see it now God here every
[5:04] generation he has a new part of his book
[5:06] and all goes together like my body was
[5:09] built I'm told to start in the spine
[5:11] where wasn't all spine it went from that
[5:13] to ribs and from lungs into hands and
[5:16] arms and feet and so forth and come on
[5:19] out to be the person that I am and so
[5:21] was a God manifested in the beginning
[5:25] and finally he was appear to Jehovah God
[5:29] the Father then he appeared as God the
[5:31] Son in Jesus Christ
[5:33] knives appeared has got the Holy Ghost
[5:35] the same God all the time three
[5:37] manifestations of the same same God
[5:41] now we find in this as each generation
[5:44] God has lauded his word from the
[5:46] beginning just like evolution team just
[5:50] like first thing God created probably
[5:52] was let's say created bhakti life first
[5:54] then he created animal life next then he
[5:58] created human life next time an
[6:00] evolution rising higher so has it been
[6:02] in God in his church justification
[6:05] hunter Luther Satan has pulling his
[6:07] bride out now he's creating his bride
[6:08] justification under Luther
[6:10] sanctification under Wesley and so forth
[6:13] he's the evolution of the Spirit being
[6:16] given more and more calls a body is
[6:19] building coming to the head which is
[6:20] Christ the body of Christ
[6:23] now she as a woman if she is married to
[6:29] Christ the word she cannot be married to
[6:32] a church denomination at the same time
[6:35] for she's bound by she shall cannot live
[6:40] with both husbands at the same time
[6:42] their country wanted her one is God
[6:46] fancy other than his man-made so they're
[6:50] contrary said let every man's word be
[6:52] alive mind be the truth God said it just
[6:57] as much contrary to one another as law
[7:01] was to Greece as Paul speaking up here
[7:05] one must be dead to have the other any
[7:09] of she tries to mix them she shall be
[7:13] called an adulteress Oh think of it
[7:18] New York Arizona across the nation think
[7:23] of it
[7:23] God said if she's tried to be married to
[7:26] two at the same time she shall be called
[7:29] in a darkness what adult earnest can
[7:33] enter heaven with God marry an adult
[7:36] earnest certainly not yes us not to do
[7:39] it she shall be called an adulteress
[7:42] then her children if she is an
[7:45] adulteress her children is illegitimate
[7:49] illegitimate illegitimate Awad not to
[7:53] the church but to the word she's
[7:56] illegitimate what a teacher office
[7:59] revelation three here all the last day
[8:02] lady or CEO churches what an
[8:05] illegitimate group what denomination
[8:09] mixer lukewarm yes carry on and Colin
[8:17] sells Christians and deny the word of
[8:20] god having a form of godliness but
[8:23] denying the power thereof as the Prophet
[8:28] said they would be marriage is the
[8:31] oldest institution in the world marriage
[8:34] was performed first and instituted in
[8:37] the Garden of Eden
[8:38] a woman is entrusted with certain
[8:43] characters that she must not the bow a
[8:47] woman is trusted that there's not a
[8:50] preacher on earth like a woman there's
[8:53] no female doll there's no female of any
[8:56] time and trusted with the character that
[8:58] a woman is a woman but not even in the
[9:02] the beginning of the creation because
[9:05] God know that she'd fall all other
[9:07] females could not commit adultery she's
[9:10] the only one that can commit adultery if
[9:14] she been they like the original that
[9:16] within this complementary to God's great
[9:18] wisdom see she was made a byproduct of a
[9:21] man but because she was cast over in
[9:24] that side she is also been given a
[9:27] sacred charge from God for redemption
[9:33] she's got characters that she must not
[9:37] defy if she wouldn't my damn she's the
[9:40] file for lifetime no matter how much
[9:43] she's forgiven she can't be justified
[9:45] I'll strike that a little bit got it
[9:48] scriptural next a few minutes she can be
[9:50] forgiven for her development but she
[9:52] cannot be justified in this life it's
[9:54] always with her notice now she's been
[9:58] given it she may be forgiven but not
[10:01] justified her
[10:02] body is given to her a sacred trust from
[10:05] God
[10:06] no female dog no bird no other animal
[10:10] nor the creature like that no she's the
[10:13] only one by it she is the reason so
[10:19] sacred she is the bring forth life
[10:21] engineer her body is the bedding grounds
[10:25] of life therefore that's reason she's
[10:28] given this sacred trust now here's what
[10:32] you may disagree many of you delusions
[10:35] that's what they file the whole human
[10:37] race is that adultery at the beginning
[10:40] [Applause]
[10:41] her bedding ground was March she brought
[10:44] forth those twins Cain and Abel one act
[10:46] two children
[10:47] search the scriptures notice now we find
[10:52] that her body is a Betty grounds and
[10:55] therefore it's a sacred trust not to
[10:57] defile it now I'm speaking out bringing
[11:00] this to an illustration to show you were
[11:02] the church things I'm not speaking of
[11:06] you women whatever you are that's
[11:07] between you and God who you man but I'm
[11:09] speaking out the church and right now
[11:16] this she has given to bring forth life
[11:19] but only God Himself can give her
[11:22] husband might be the germ bear but God
[11:25] has produced life this right it has to
[11:27] come all life has to come from God any
[11:30] eye has to come from God it's perverted
[11:32] that's what makes it sinful but life has
[11:35] to come from God he's the author of life
[11:37] now she has a sick one all to name three
[11:41] things sure that she must not get away
[11:43] from now I'm speaking to keep the church
[11:45] in mind while I'm speaking this to the
[11:47] natural woman is Paul is here in seventh
[11:49] chapter Romans she has a sacred trust of
[11:52] virtue committed to her by her Lord a
[11:56] certain virtue nothing else holds it but
[12:01] a woman trying that's committed to her
[12:04] by God she must not defile that virtue
[12:08] if she even does something wrong
[12:10] she must confess that to her husband
[12:13] before she takes
[12:14] and make a righteous saying to the
[12:16] church at his marriages the law has to
[12:17] come also before crying before the
[12:19] second marriage she has confessed that
[12:21] if she doesn't and she lives with her
[12:23] husband 14 years and then confessing he
[12:26] has a right to far away and marry
[12:27] another woman that's the scripture
[12:31] fornications unclean living Joseph fear
[12:34] not tickity million died wife for that
[12:36] which she conceived in her is of the
[12:37] Holy Ghost he was my ta put her away
[12:40] privately she had already engaged her
[12:43] when you engaged her as far as God's
[12:45] concerned you're married to her notice
[12:47] now she has a sacred trust of virtue
[12:51] it's been given her trusted to hurt by
[12:55] the law God gave her that virtue just as
[13:01] it was in the Garden of Eden she say yes
[13:03] or no she has a sacred trust of
[13:07] womanhood committed to her but she must
[13:10] not break the womanhood I'm speaking of
[13:13] here is her conduct her character around
[13:16] man nothing every man looks on these
[13:19] screens and see these movie stars
[13:21] kissing and hugging is slopping around
[13:23] all these women a woman does that is of
[13:26] a bad character
[13:27] she might be purchase otherwise but see
[13:30] in her heart when those gland sex glands
[13:33] are in the lips the man kisses a woman
[13:36] is actually pretentiously committed
[13:38] adultery six glands are in the woman's
[13:41] lips and a man's lips he could kiss her
[13:43] on the hand it was mixing their six days
[13:45] but the sex panja's in the lips you see
[13:48] all this nonsense endure the Hollywood
[13:51] today of all this and slopping and
[13:53] loving around with women and so forth
[13:55] and little girls look at all that no
[13:56] wonder our morals are rock
[14:02] [Applause]
[14:04] the cause is cut before the children try
[14:07] it it has to be that way for the last
[14:09] days now keep the church in mind she's
[14:12] kissing us swapping it and everything
[14:15] else but let the devil in education and
[14:19] scientific churches and so forth once
[14:22] scientific education everything is
[14:24] absolutely contrary to God the whole
[14:27] system of civilization we have now is
[14:30] absolutely antichrist educational system
[14:34] is Antichrist civilization is Antichrist
[14:38] it's against God you say a gift
[14:42] civilization God will have a
[14:43] civilization one of these days that
[14:45] won't have any death associated into it
[14:48] this modern civilization come by Satan a
[14:52] preventive Lord willing tonight how the
[14:55] Bible all these things are of Satan our
[14:59] new civilization I have none of this in
[15:01] it she has this secret womanhood no
[15:06] wonder that man act around women the way
[15:08] they do is because women act around man
[15:10] the way they do she characters herself
[15:13] out you're the parish shorts on and skin
[15:16] tighten man's pulling and thanks out on
[15:18] strings twisting around no matter what
[15:21] she says she might be as birches to her
[15:24] husband she could be but it is sight of
[15:25] God she is a darkness whosoever looketh
[15:29] upon a woman to lust after her has
[15:31] committed adultery with her already in
[15:34] his heart did she present herself to be
[15:36] that nuts exactly what the church is
[15:38] done with the world notice that's
[15:43] committer sacred virtue sacred womanhood
[15:47] and then sacred motherhood honor her
[15:53] husband just look today in certain
[15:58] cities many cities they even have big
[16:00] parties in what called society church
[16:03] members to death their hats and a floor
[16:05] and they all get drunk pitcher keys into
[16:07] it each woman goes and picks the key out
[16:09] of the head for the man she lived with
[16:10] over the weekend all kinds of such
[16:13] parties which I've got some
[16:14] to say your floor footing I haven't got
[16:16] time to go into it touch a bill and the
[16:22] church is just as bad right committing
[16:25] adultery with everything she has no
[16:27] business to be going into she should
[16:29] stay with the world
[16:32] buildings are all right
[16:34] hospitals are all right all these other
[16:37] things are all right educational
[16:38] programs that's all right we have to
[16:39] live your hep Reid ride that's one of
[16:41] the economies like we weren't supposed
[16:42] to put on any clothes just the beginning
[16:44] I'll preach on that later this week the
[16:46] Lord willing but we have to wear clothes
[16:48] because God gave us clues but in the
[16:50] beginning we didn't need them
[16:51] we were veiled now she's veiled your sin
[16:55] she don't even know she sinner yes she
[16:59] was then father
[17:00] now she's bayeux by the devil that she
[17:02] was veiled by God the difference of it
[17:05] now we find out that she's been given
[17:06] this sacred trust that she must not
[17:09] break a womanhood at have her character
[17:13] raise her children be honorable to her
[17:15] husband
[17:16] nowadays they pay a bit more attention
[17:18] to it and nothing in the world you're
[17:20] sitting office sometimes and see man
[17:22] bringing their wives where they try to
[17:24] get right with God and confess of all
[17:25] the man they live with and everything
[17:27] else ends have been married oh you say
[17:29] that's there are Pentecostal the others
[17:34] will come so it's I'm speaking up how I
[17:38] can get away what do you get to mix it
[17:40] up with the world and the church and all
[17:42] the fashions and things that we have
[17:44] we're no more like the original
[17:45] Pentecost was and day is from night
[17:49] we've drifted off somewhere here's some
[17:52] dark chaos somewhere and lost what a
[17:56] sacred trust what a responsibility to a
[17:59] woman ah see why she the type of the
[18:03] church which has the same responsibility
[18:06] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[18:08] to her mother your virtues to her
[18:12] husband the church has a sacred
[18:15] responsibility to pare into the word
[18:17] into Christ just as same as a wool
[18:21] and as a woman drifts off with another
[18:24] man when the church goes off on these
[18:26] institutional programs and building
[18:28] programs and schools and so forth I have
[18:30] nothing against them here all right they
[18:32] serve their purpose but they're not
[18:35] jesus never saycome excuse preach the
[18:39] word that's where they neglected god
[18:44] make it institutions hospitals and so
[18:46] forth ends all right but that's not the
[18:49] church's duty Oh their duty is to preach
[18:53] the gospel but we've done everything
[18:57] else but that and we've drifted in just
[19:00] like Satan didn't mix it up with some
[19:02] gospel something else and something else
[19:04] just got a conglomeration of nothing
[19:06] yeah
[19:07] corruption even our hope the whole world
[19:11] what's the trend of the world reading
[19:13] Reader's Digest you're no longer work
[19:15] young girls are going to the menopause
[19:16] and man the cheese applies between 20
[19:19] and 25 years old they're going to the
[19:21] middle age corruption why not because of
[19:25] scientific research of food and stuff
[19:28] that's broke down from the natural
[19:30] things we should put in our body we are
[19:33] nothing but a bunch of dying corruption
[19:36] now that's what the church is also hey -
[19:40] the same condition she's a type she has
[19:44] the same precious virtues by spirit
[19:47] given to her to preserve the spirit and
[19:50] the word and never commit adultery with
[19:52] anything in the world read a state birch
[19:54] it to the word as the woman is to say
[19:56] purchase to her husband it's a sacred
[19:58] trust to honor their large word above
[20:02] every man made great wisdom denomination
[20:05] there is the church's giving our trust
[20:08] given they say without my church I don't
[20:10] care what's your church means if it's
[20:12] contrary to the Word of God stay away
[20:14] from
[20:16] the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same
[20:18] yesterday and forever mark 16 said these
[20:21] signs shall follow them a bleeder the
[20:23] church breach is different from that
[20:24] don't you you doubted that thing be
[20:27] barred to get into the Word of God
[20:29] do you to all the world I preach the
[20:31] gospel to every creature that's how poor
[20:33] it was to go these signs shall follow
[20:35] them that believe in all the world and
[20:37] every creature that will believe yeah
[20:39] see how we got away from it sure but
