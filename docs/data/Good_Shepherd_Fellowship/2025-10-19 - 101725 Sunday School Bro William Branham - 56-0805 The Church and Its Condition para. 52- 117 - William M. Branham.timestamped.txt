[0:21] [Music]
[0:32] three years old. You know that's a lie.
[0:34] But you let your kids get their head
[0:36] stuck full of that. And there isn't one%
[0:38] out of 100 that ever know anything about
[0:41] Jesus Christ is because this world has
[0:43] become so polluted. this nation so
[0:46] ridiculous and so far from God has
[0:48] rejected the Holy Ghost. Oh, you say, "I
[0:50] go to church and shout, you might do
[0:52] that,
[0:53] &gt;&gt; but until that gentle lamb of God
[0:56] settles in your heart and makes you
[0:58] clean up your life and act like a
[1:00] different person, it won't do you any
[1:02] good to impersonate Christianity, you've
[1:04] got to have it."
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. My god.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; I went into a house sure not long ago to
[1:10] visit a sick man and a lady was lay
[1:13] sitting there and a little old Oswald
[1:17] come in hat sitting on the side of his
[1:19] head is dinner ready. She said honey
[1:22] that we haven't had time said this
[1:25] morning to get any dinner. Said I'm
[1:28] fixing a sandwich. Said there's some
[1:29] oranges. He walked over and got a hold
[1:32] of an orange looked at dipped into it.
[1:35] pulled it up against the wall as hard as
[1:37] he could. The juice shone down to the he
[1:40] got around this place and I now
[1:45] go be mine for about five minutes.
[1:49] Boy, I jerked the hide off of him like
[1:51] he'd never jerked off.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; But family there pitying baby. What he
[1:56] needs is a good oldfashioned limb
[1:58] skinning. That's why we need some
[2:00] oldfashioned homes again and some
[2:02] preachers that will stand behind the
[2:03] pull pit and preach the truth and lay it
[2:06] down where it belongs to be.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my little Mary stomp her little feet
[2:16] and stick that little nose up and turn
[2:18] them little bitty
[2:20] rosecoled lips by Max Factor stuff up in
[2:23] the air and stick her little head up and
[2:25] walk out of the house. What a disgrace.
[2:28] how disobedient children are being. The
[2:30] Bible said they would be.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; The scripture said they would be, how
[2:34] they would act, how they would do, and
[2:37] the things that's going on in the world
[2:38] today is because they have grieved away
[2:41] the Holy Spirit. A few years ago, I'm
[2:44] going down a few days to celebrate the
[2:46] first falling of the Holy Ghost in
[2:47] America 50 years ago. this year at the
[2:50] old ISUsa street meeting, Pentecostal
[2:52] meeting in Los Angeles where they had
[2:55] their first falling of the Holy Spirit
[2:58] when the people got together. When
[3:00] Christ come down among those people,
[3:02] they were just as gentle, just as
[3:05] peaceful. They live godly lives. They
[3:07] live sacrificial lives. They were
[3:10] willing to give in. They were willing to
[3:12] be led by the Holy Ghost. They didn't
[3:13] care what the people said. They were
[3:15] oldfashioned or they said they were
[3:16] crazy or what about it. They were
[3:18] willing to be led by the Holy Ghost.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; But today, oh my, with a powder pup and
[3:25] a bakeup box and a pair of shorts on and
[3:28] out on the street, why it's a disgrace
[3:31] and calling themselves with the Holy
[3:32] Ghost. Oh, you say, "But I spoke a
[3:34] tongues." Yes, and the devil does, too.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I shouted, "And the devil does,
[3:39] too." The devil can impersonate
[3:42] everything God's got except love. And he
[3:45] can't impersonate love. Amen. Thank God.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; And the first thing you know when you
[3:51] started doing those things, you let down
[3:53] the bars, you begin compromising and the
[3:56] church begin to get little clux clicks
[3:58] in among them. And this said, you know,
[4:00] the pastor is this so and so or the
[4:02] deacon so and so. And the first thing
[4:05] you know, you listen to that. And that's
[4:07] the reason we've had so much trouble is
[4:10] because you begin to listen to the devil
[4:13] and get a snarl instead of listening to
[4:15] the gentle dove.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the dove of God that
[4:20] would lead you and guide you and love
[4:22] you and bless you.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; First time you get one of those little
[4:25] temper spasms, the dove flies right
[4:27] away.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. She can't stand it. Her
[4:31] nature is different.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, she can't stand that at all.
[4:34] And you go to talking about your
[4:35] neighbor, she can't stand that.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; She just won't put up with it. He just
[4:39] takes his flight and goes on away. He
[4:42] just can't stand it any longer. The dove
[4:44] is gentle. The dove is neat. And the
[4:48] dove and the and it can't stand on
[4:50] nothing unless it's the same kind of
[4:52] nature. Now, God can make you a
[4:55] different nature, man or woman. He can
[4:58] give you a different nature. And you
[4:59] say, "Well, Brother Brandham, what can
[5:01] we do about it?" just become a lamb
[5:02] again. It's only two animals will ever
[5:05] associate together. That's the dove and
[5:07] the lamb. The dove won't come to
[5:09] anything else but a lamb. And if you
[5:11] become a goat, then get that old goaty
[5:13] spirit off of you.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; If you become something else, get it
[5:19] away from you. If you begin to become a
[5:21] tadler, here one time I preached just as
[5:23] hard as I could preach in a certain city
[5:26] and there was thousands of people there.
[5:28] I made an altar call and I thought I
[5:30] covered a whole realm of sin. I covered
[5:33] everything that I could think of. That
[5:35] night after the service over, a very
[5:37] pissy little woman walked by. She said,
[5:40] "But Brother Ram, I'm sure glad that you
[5:42] didn't touch me tonight." I thought that
[5:44] must be a real Christian.
[5:46] Said, "You didn't touch me tonight." I
[5:48] said, "Well, I'm certainly glad you hear
[5:49] that lady. You must be close to the
[5:51] kingdom of God." And she tipped away
[5:53] some elderly ladies standing there. I
[5:55] said, "Say, do you know that woman?"
[5:58] Yes. And I said, "She must be a real
[6:00] Christian." Said, "One thing you failed
[6:02] to hit tonight, Brother Brandon, that
[6:03] was gossip. She's the chief gossiper in
[6:06] the country." There you are. That's it.
[6:09] See, but when you come to one of those
[6:12] things, no matter whether a preacher
[6:13] hits in the pull pit or not, when you
[6:15] see those carnal things of the world, as
[6:17] long as you intolerate with them, you're
[6:19] away from God and the Holy Spirit will
[6:21] stay away.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the meetings are not
[6:24] like they used to be. That's the reason
[6:26] the sawdust trail isn't born this
[6:28] morning in the tabernacle. That's the
[6:30] reason the great tit meetings are not
[6:32] around the country is because we have
[6:34] breathed away the gentle dove of God.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[6:37] &gt;&gt; right. He won't stay with us as long as
[6:39] we're so indifferent. As long as we're
[6:42] backbiting, we want our ways. Now, I
[6:45] want you to notice the lamb was a silent
[6:48] lamb. The Bible said he opened not his
[6:50] mouth. Like the sheep before the shears,
[6:53] he was dumb. He didn't open his mouth.
[6:56] He wasn't a fellow that wants his
[6:57] rights. No, sir. He was willing to
[6:59] forfear for his right. He was a silent
[7:01] man. But today, oh my how, we want our
[7:05] differences. Oh my. I tell you, you just
[7:08] let somebody say something to me. I'll
[7:10] go over and get him, boy. I'll take him
[7:11] apart. I'll tell that old hypocrite when
[7:13] I see her. Just wait till I see her.
[7:15] Bless God. Hallelujah. Mhm.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; The dove just takes his flight and goes
[7:20] on away. That's right. The Holy Spirit's
[7:22] not with you anymore. As long as you
[7:24] feel that way, just mark that down in
[7:26] your book. It'll never do it. A Holy
[7:28] Spirit just won't stay around where that
[7:30] kind of a spirit is.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a lamb spirit, a gentle
[7:34] spirit or just won't stay with it.
[7:36] That's all there is to it.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; If it ain't a gentle meat led by the
[7:41] Holy Spirit, and if anything comes up,
[7:43] it just don't even notice it. Just goes
[7:44] on. See, and the very minute that it
[7:47] turns a sign, you know that's the very
[7:50] the when you turn aside, do you know the
[7:52] first sin started of a person turning
[7:55] aside just for a minute?
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Did you know that the Bible said so? Eve
[8:01] turned aside just a moment.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what Satan had to say? And
[8:04] he painted a picture so pretty to her
[8:07] till she actually thought it was the
[8:08] truth and she listened to him. And the
[8:11] only thing the devil wants you to do is
[8:13] just turn aside just for a few minutes.
[8:16] He can paint the picture and say, "Now
[8:17] look here. You know, brother, you know,
[8:19] sister, if they were the right kind of
[8:20] people, they wouldn't do this. If they
[8:22] just did this right here, you know, he
[8:24] can make it so real to you until it
[8:26] becomes a real truth."
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Right. But remember, it's the devil.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; I don't care how low down they are, how
[8:34] far they've stooped in sin. It's your
[8:37] business to put an arm around them and
[8:38] lift them up by the love of God.
[8:41] Where was you when the devil of God
[8:43] lifted you out of Mari Clay?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; It's your business, my friend.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; This world of dying for a little bit of
[8:50] love.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; The I want you to notice this animal,
[8:54] too. This little animal, it was a solid
[8:57] lamb because it didn't when he was
[8:59] reviled, he reviled not again. He didn't
[9:02] rail and carry on and fuss and stew and
[9:04] go on. He didn't do it. When somebody's
[9:08] when he was reviled, he reviled not
[9:10] again. He opened not his mouth. But you
[9:12] let somebody do something to you
[9:15] &gt;&gt; or me. Oh my. We blow up like a toad
[9:20] frog eating bugshot.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Puff out like a like an old goose. I
[9:24] tell you right now, you step on my toes
[9:27] like that again. I'll never go back to
[9:28] that old church again. Oh, sure. Bless
[9:30] God. Hallelujah. The Nazarines will
[9:32] receive me. The pilgrim holiness,
[9:33] they'll take me. Hallelujah. I don't
[9:35] have to do it no more. All right. The
[9:38] dove takes its flight.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; You know what? If that old hypocrite
[9:43] goes to that church, I'll never go
[9:46] again. Bless God, I'll never do it. When
[9:48] that thing strikes you, that old
[9:50] snarling wolf, the dove takes her
[9:52] flight,
[9:54] &gt;&gt; right? Then the Holy Ghost is gone.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Then you wonder what's the matter with
[9:59] you. You wonder what's the matter with
[10:00] the church. You wonder what's the matter
[10:02] with you. Why ain't you got victory like
[10:04] you used to have? You change your
[10:06] nature.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; You become a goat instead of a lamb.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; You become something else besides a
[10:13] lamb. You've got to get that real meat
[10:16] spirit. Let the Holy Ghost lead me
[10:19] wherever. God, I love every sinner no
[10:22] matter where they are.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; That kind of a place get into my heart.
[10:25] Then you're going to see something
[10:27] happen. Your soul say, "Well, brother
[10:30] Brandham, is there any solution for it?"
[10:32] Yes. Just become a lamb.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; That's all you say. Say, "Well, brother
[10:36] Brandon, I met a young lady the other
[10:38] night down street. Billy and I went out
[10:40] to a place to get a sandwich at the
[10:41] service store. A beautiful young woman
[10:44] come in there, probably a young girl or
[10:46] maybe a 20 or something like that. Nice
[10:48] dress. She sat down. I noticed she kept
[10:51] looking across that way. I just kept on
[10:53] eating. Few minutes the lady come in.
[10:55] She said, "How did you spoke to her?"
[10:57] And I know the lady was Sister Davis
[10:59] down there. and um her and another lady
[11:02] from Life of Tabernacle. I knew them
[11:03] well. She come over, spoke to me, went
[11:05] on. Then the young lady sitting across,
[11:07] she said, "Brother Bram, that was a nice
[11:08] message tonight." I said, "How do you
[11:09] do, sister?" I said, "Thank you very
[11:11] much." And I said, "Um, are you a member
[11:14] of the live tabernacle?" She said, "I
[11:15] am." She said, "You know, Brother Bram,
[11:17] I could have sung in the choir, but they
[11:19] make a restriction down there." She
[11:21] said, "I had oh so many years of vocal
[11:23] training and everything." said, "I sang
[11:25] solos and I sang certain things." Said,
[11:27] "But I I couldn't sing because they have
[11:29] a they have a restriction that no woman
[11:32] wearing paint can slang in the choir." I
[11:34] said, "Well, praise God for life
[11:36] tabernacle."
[11:38] &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, I tell you, Brother
[11:40] Brandham," she said, "Uh, I'm a
[11:42] Christian." I said, "Then sister, go
[11:44] home and wash your face or whatever you
[11:46] do." I said, "Do you mean to tell me
[11:48] that you let such a little thing is
[11:50] wearing a little that old stuff on your
[11:52] face?" Now, I can prove to you that that
[11:54] come from the devil. I can prove to you
[11:56] that nothing in the that originally was
[11:58] heathens. And as long as you wear it,
[12:01] it's a mark of a heathen. Now, I just
[12:03] come back from Africa and I've been in
[12:05] the hot and hot jungles and found out
[12:08] just exactly where earrings where all
[12:10] that stuff comes and all this lot of
[12:12] jewelry and wrap around your neck and
[12:14] ears and everything where that comes
[12:17] from. It's the heathens. And the Bible
[12:20] don't want a Christian to be a heathen.
[12:22] And you don't want I don't say that you
[12:24] are a heathen because you do it, but
[12:26] you're making yourself look like one.
[12:28] It's because your pastor didn't tell you
[12:30] the truth.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. And now you say,
[12:34] "Brother Brandon, I think if I got short
[12:36] hair, it makes me cool and everything
[12:38] like that's right. But if you got long
[12:39] hair, you'd be cooler. It'll take it all
[12:42] off your neck and wrap it up and make it
[12:44] right." Well, you know what the Bible
[12:46] said? that a man has a right to put away
[12:48] his wife, get a divorce from her if she
[12:50] cuts her hair. If she cuts her hair, it
[12:53] shows she's living untrue to him. The
[12:55] Bible said so. 1 Corinthians 12, find
[12:58] out if it's not right. She that a woman
[13:00] that cuts her hair dishonors her head,
[13:01] which is her husband. And if she's
[13:03] dishonorable, she should be divorced and
[13:05] got away from. That's right. But see,
[13:07] the pastor never tells you those things.
[13:09] And that's the reason that you do the
[13:11] way you do. and and the man the Bible
[13:14] said here not long ago there was
[13:16] somebody wrote in and said brother
[13:17] Brandham the these blouses that women
[13:20] get said well it's such a you just can't
[13:23] hardly find blouses anymore and it would
[13:25] be all right for us Christian women to
[13:27] wear these dayrons nylons or what it is
[13:30] like that I said look sister there's one
[13:33] thing about it here's one thing true you
[13:35] can do this if you can't buy one they
[13:38] sell sewing machines you can make one I
[13:40] said that's right to make it look this I
[13:43] believe you know what's in your heart is
[13:45] what expresses itself. The way you do
[13:47] and the way you act that shows what's in
[13:49] you. That's the reason that all this
[13:51] you're snarling and fussing and
[13:52] backbiting and and biting back and
[13:54] carrying on around the church. That's
[13:56] what breaks up the church. That shows
[13:58] that the devil got into you and that
[14:00] shows the Holy Ghost left you.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; God. Now
[14:04] &gt;&gt; I know that's just burning the tar out
[14:06] of some of you, but it ought to do it.
[14:08] It ought to. That's what it's said for,
[14:11] not to be smart, not to act cute, but to
[14:13] tell you where the trouble is. For
[14:15] someday, I'm going to have to stand and
[14:16] give it an answer for you.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; And the very reason you do and the way
[14:20] you act, that shows what you are.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; If you just got an old temper that will
[14:25] fly off the handle just a little bit and
[14:27] get out here and carry on or criticize
[14:29] or vulgarity and stuff like that, that
[14:31] shows where it's coming from.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Now, there's only one thing to do. Get
[14:34] that thing out of there
[14:36] &gt;&gt; and the dove will come back to your
[14:38] heart. When the dove went out of the
[14:39] ark, she was turned out. But she come
[14:42] back and knocked at the dark door and
[14:44] told Noah let her in. The Holy Ghost is
[14:46] here. The Holy Ghost wants to come in.
[14:48] That's the reason that the day that the
[14:50] Holy Spirit, it hasn't gone from you
[14:52] forever. It's just sitting out there on
[14:53] the limbs of the tree somewhere ready to
[14:55] fly itself back and to come into you and
[14:57] give you love and peace and joy like you
[15:00] used to have.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Sure it is. It's ready to do it. He
[15:04] wants to do it. He's longing to do it.
[15:07] But you won't let him do it. Now, I'm
[15:08] not talking to you, stranger. I don't
[15:10] know what your pastor. I'm talking to
[15:11] the Brandon Tabernacle.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking to you people in other
[15:15] churches. I'm talking to the brand
[15:17] tabernacle. That's what's the matter
[15:19] around here. That's what makes the dove
[15:20] take his flight. Just let somebody just
[15:22] start a little something around the
[15:23] church and the first thing, oh, is that
[15:25] so?
[15:27] Oh, did you don't mean so. Right? Then
[15:29] the Holy Ghost goes fly away. Amen.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; They just can't stand that kind of
[15:33] spirit.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; As long as that lamb nature leaves you
[15:36] and the Holy Ghost is gone.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's what's the
[15:40] matter today.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the people's in the
[15:42] condition they are is because they let
[15:45] the wrong spirit come into their heart
[15:47] into their life. Now, that's the reason
[15:49] we got the Bible said that's the reason
[15:51] so many sick and afflicted among us
[15:53] &gt;&gt; is because of such thing. We must be
[15:55] gentle. We must be peaceful. We must be
[15:58] a lamb so that the dove can abide with
[16:01] us. Now remember the dove will come. You
[16:03] said, "Oh, brother Brandham, don't tell
[16:05] me I never received the Holy Ghost."
[16:07] Hallelujah. Down at the night there one
[16:09] night. Oh, when he come in, I could just
[16:11] walk sure that was him. Oh, I felt so
[16:15] good. I felt like I could get every
[16:17] little bird out of the tree and hug it.
[16:18] Love it. My wickedest person ever done
[16:20] anything to me. I felt like I could put
[16:22] my arm around him and hug him. Oh,
[16:24] brother Bam, how I felt. Sure, that was
[16:26] the Holy Ghost.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; But you see the reason he couldn't
[16:31] abide, you was a lamb, man. But when you
[16:34] become a wolf,
[16:37] &gt;&gt; he had to make his flight.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the with the with the
[16:42] dove. It's you.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; And though you let that spirit come to
[16:45] you. Did I let it, brother Ram? Yes.
[16:47] When he went to listen to that gossip,
[16:49] when he listened to that lie,
[16:51] &gt;&gt; when he went to say, "Well, I've got a
[16:53] right to." You You haven't got no right.
[16:56] You're bought with a price.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; That was a price of the precious blood
[17:00] of the son of God.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; The only right you have is come to the
[17:08] fountain filled with blood. Go in front
[17:10] of Emanuel's name. When sinners punch
[17:12] beneath the blood, lose all their guilty
[17:14] stain.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's the only right you have
[17:18] is a surrendered self-will to God. And
[17:22] then God does the leading from then on.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what causes the meetings.
[17:27] That's what causes so many strange
[17:29] things. The Holy Spirit will go to a
[17:31] place the Holy Spirit said, "This is not
[17:33] right. Stop the meeting. Move you on."
[17:35] I'll stop it too, brother. Move right
[17:37] on. That's right. Because you've got to
[17:39] be led by the spirit of God.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; And the only way to be led by the spirit
[17:44] of God is keep gentle. Not to know a
[17:46] whole lot. Oh, you think I know a whole
[17:48] lot? Yeah. You get your brain all worked
[17:50] up and it can't even work itself. You
[17:53] know all the books and all the answers,
[17:55] all the Greek and all the Hebrew. Now,
[17:56] ain't got no place for the dove to
[17:58] roost.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; But you know it all. Then the dove can't
[18:02] lead because you know too much. The lamb
[18:05] don't claim to know nothing.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; It's got to have somebody else to lead
[18:09] it.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; What's that?
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Don't know nothing. Amen. The only thing
[18:16] I know is Christ Jesus died to save me.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:21] down through California is a guy coming
[18:23] had a sign on the front of him said I'm
[18:24] a fool for Christ and on the back said
[18:27] whose fool are you?
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Become a fool to the world
[18:33] that you might be led by the Holy Ghost.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Cause the sons and daughters of God are
[18:38] led by the Holy Ghost.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1 said, "There's therefore now
[18:42] no condemnation to them that are in
[18:44] Christ Jesus that walk not to the flesh,
[18:48] &gt;&gt; but the spirit."
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Walk not after the wolf but the
[18:51] dove.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doc used to sing a song, fill my
[18:56] way every day with love. As I walk with
[18:58] the heavenly dove, let me go all the
[19:01] while with a song and a smile. Fill my
[19:04] way every day with love.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; What a peaceful day it'll be for the
[19:07] Brandon Tabernacle or any other church
[19:10] or any individual when they'll far their
[19:13] rights.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; To become a lamb.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; What's the question, brother Brandham?
[19:18] Come back to a land. Come back to be
[19:20] gentle. Come back to know nothing. Come
[19:22] back to just submit yourself to Christ.
[19:25] Don't try. Don't try to know nothing.
[19:28] Just walk me, quietly, humbly, gently,
[19:32] and the dove will lead you. But whenever
[19:34] you go to listen to that gossip,
[19:36] whenever you go to get that temper up,
[19:38] whenever you go to thinking you got a
[19:39] right to do this and do that, the dove
[19:41] just takes your flight and goes on away.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Then you don't have it anymore. Now,
[19:45] she's not very far from you this
[19:47] morning, church. She's sitting right out
[19:48] there on a limb of peace.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Waiting for your nature to be changed.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; What you need today is to submit all
[19:57] your rights. Is to let God lay you down
[20:00] and shave all your rights off of you.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine how a little old lamb
[20:06] all hangs his rights? Yeah. Burn it up
[20:11] and then just lay up on the sharing
[20:12] table. They know what's best for him.
[20:14] Take all his rights away from him. Sure,
[20:16] all how cool and light he runs.
[20:20] He's happy and jumps around and has a
[20:22] big time. Yes, sir. If you forfeit your
[20:25] rights, that's what you get.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; But you got to forfeit your right and
[20:29] let the word of God shave all the world
[20:31] off of you. Take all the habits of the
[20:34] world away and you become a new creature
[20:36] in Christ. Here some time ago over in
[20:39] Africa,
[20:40] I was talking to a to an old saint. He
[20:44] said, "Brother Brandon, I know you
[20:46] believe in the supernatural." I said,
[20:47] "Certainly, my brother." He said, "Years
[20:50] ago, I used to think I was somebody."
[20:54] Said, "I thought I was really a
[20:55] Christian." And he said, "Then up in our
[20:58] church, I had to climb a hill where I
[20:59] stopped my little car and said I had to
[21:01] climb a hill about oh three or 4 hundred
[21:03] yards to get around bushes and things
[21:05] getting up and said we'd had prayer
[21:07] meeting up there and said I thought I
[21:10] was really a Christian." He said, "I
[21:12] know all the Bible. I studied all the
[21:14] Hebrew. I studied all the right
[21:16] pronunciations of the words and said
[21:18] anybody walk up to me, I could talk to
[21:20] them like that about the Bible. I know
[21:22] what I was talking about. He said one
[21:24] night I was going up to church. There
[21:26] been a lot of conflict in our church
[21:28] said this little parties against one
[21:30] another. You know how it raised? I said
[21:32] yes sir. He said on my road up the hill
[21:34] I was walking and all at once I become
[21:36] conscious that somebody was following me
[21:41] and said I thought I'd wait just a
[21:43] little bit forever to catch up and I
[21:45] talked to him a little while as we went
[21:47] up the road. You know that's kind of a
[21:51] good thing. you just wait a little while
[21:54] and says as I walked up the hill said I
[21:58] come up a man come up the hill and said
[22:01] he had a bundle on his back that was way
[22:03] bigger than a man and said he was just a
[22:06] painting and a blowing and making his
[22:09] little short steps trying to get up and
[22:11] I said fella can I help you pack this
[22:14] load up a hill said no I got to pack it
[22:18] I looked at his hand that I knew then it
[22:21] was a vision
[22:22] He had scars in his hand.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; So I fell down and I said, "Lord, are
[22:27] you packing the sins of the world in
[22:29] that sack?" He said, "No, I'm just
[22:30] packing yours. Just getting you up the
[22:32] hill just so you can get up."
[22:36] That's the way it is.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; If we just look around, we find out he's
[22:40] packing ours.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it make you feel little?
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Our wicked, cruel heart just because we
[22:50] can do it. there some time ago I was
[22:53] hunting as you know I love to hunt and
[22:55] there was a wicked guy in that country
[22:58] he was a wicked fell and he used to make
[23:00] fun of me because I wouldn't shoot dos
[23:02] and swans I said it's brutal I said
[23:07] won't you be a real clean hunter
[23:10] and shoot the old bucks and things
[23:12] that's old
[23:14] and ready to die that God gave them to
[23:16] us them young mothers and saying he said
[23:18] oh you're chickenhearted preacher
[23:21] kept telling me like that. I said, "Now
[23:23] look, if I was hungry and I wanted one
[23:25] of those fans, I believe God let me have
[23:27] it. But just to shoot it, just to act
[23:30] smart, wait, fill a wagon up."
[23:32] And he went and made him a call or some
[23:34] kind of a whistle and he could blow that
[23:37] whistle and it sound just exactly like a
[23:39] little fawn calling. One day we was in
[23:41] the bushes together. I shamed him. I
[23:45] said, "I've been ashamed of myself. kill
[23:47] eight or 10 fawns one time if you could,
[23:50] doors and everything just to act smart.
[23:53] Maybe cut the hind quarters off and
[23:54] leave the rest of it lay there. I said,
[23:57] "You said, "You preachers are too
[23:59] chicken hearted." One day he stood back
[24:01] in the bushes and he took hold this
[24:03] whistle and he screamed and sound like a
[24:05] little fawn crying. Just as he did that,
[24:08] a beautiful dough stuck her head out,
[24:11] come stomping out. You could see her big
[24:13] brown eyes looking. She was startled.
[24:16] She was looking around. The hunter
[24:17] raised down, pulled up his rifle to
[24:19] shoot the dough. And the dough seen the
[24:22] hunter. But you know what? That scream
[24:25] of that farm. She didn't notice that
[24:27] gun. She was looking for that baby. It
[24:30] was in trouble. You know that display of
[24:34] real motherhood and mother love that she
[24:36] faced that gun in the face for death.
[24:39] Looking at that in the muzzle of that
[24:40] gun, you know what? That display was so
[24:43] great it got next to him.
[24:45] He threw down his gun. He run back and
[24:48] grab me around the arm. He said, "Billy,
[24:50] pray for me. I've had enough of this."
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; When he seen that display of mother
[24:55] heroism.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, when the world sees the display of
[25:00] the love of God in the gallop in our
[25:03] human heart. What a difference it'll be
[25:06] when we let the dove of God come to our
[25:08] heart and gentleness make us meet. there
[25:11] in that brush harbor back there. Me
[25:13] standing there praying for that old boy.
[25:14] I led him to the Lord Jesus. From then
[25:17] on, he was a good clean hunter.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Sure. He thought he had a right. He'd do
[25:22] what he wanted to. That was on my place.
[25:24] They eat my coffee down there if they
[25:26] want to. I said, "That's right. But it's
[25:28] unhuman to do that.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; You've got to forfeit your rights."
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, God have mercy that we will. Here
[25:35] some time ago in oh about a hundred
[25:37] years ago, there was a great Christian
[25:40] live in the southwest United States. His
[25:44] name is Daniel Curry. A wonderful man, a
[25:47] godly man, a sainted man, a real
[25:51] Christian, a man that everybody thought
[25:53] so much of. Such a wonderful person. And
[25:57] the story goes that he died or went into
[26:00] a trance. And he said, "Have you went up
[26:02] to heaven?" Of course, when he died and
[26:05] when he got to the pearly gates, the
[26:07] caretaker come to the door said, "Who
[26:10] are you?" He said, "I'm the evangelist
[26:13] Daniel Curry. I've won thousands of
[26:16] souls to Christ, and I'm I want to come
[26:19] in this morning. My life's journey is
[26:21] ended on earth.
[26:24] I have no place to go now.
