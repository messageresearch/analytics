[50:35] to see
[50:35] pastor one for sometimes we have some
[50:38] offending business to discuss

[50:46] september before for my
[50:48] anniversary to bring my wife along so we
[50:50] can see him
[50:52] but she has something else to do so uh
[50:54] that didn't work up

[50:59] thanksgiving and that didn't work out
[51:01] for her again
[51:03] but i said where i got something to
[51:04] discuss with brother when i was very

[51:10] see him and do also fellowship with you
[51:13] praise the lord
[51:15] you know when you have the opportunity
[51:17] to see
[51:19] the children of god is very important
[51:23] because we are living the time where we
[51:25] don't know tomorrow
[51:27] tomorrow is not a promise day for us we
[51:30] only
[51:31] expect to see tomorrow by faith god
[51:34] never promised anyone tomorrow
[51:36] so we want to make use of every
[51:38] opportunity we have
[51:40] when we have the chance to meet like
[51:41] this so i'm happy to be here
[51:44] and uh and i believe that you have
[51:46] prayed so much for this service
[51:48] and we just want to just pray that god
[51:51] will come down and just minister to us
[51:54] praise the lord so uh i just want to say
[51:57] happy thanksgiving to you all

[52:06] happy this morning
[52:08] wonderful wonderful wonderful amen and
[52:11] amen
[52:12] hallelujah
[52:17] in no church this is
[52:20] the most important part of my life not
[52:23] so much of standing beyond the pulpit
[52:25] but being in church
[52:27] i'm not saying that because i'm here i'm
[52:29] saying that because of me what i'm
[52:30] saying
[52:33] being in church to serve god is the most
[52:35] important part of my
[52:36] entire life i don't see one thing i
[52:39] would do much better i
[52:40] i got my job i get my family i got my
[52:42] case but
[52:44] when i in the presence of god in church
[52:46] is the best part of my life
[52:48] and i take it very seriously and i
[52:51] believe that you all this morning have
[52:52] come here with that expectation
[52:55] you know i was just meditating i said
[52:56] lord i don't want us to come to church
[52:59] just because today's sunday
[53:02] and we want to make that like a
[53:03] tradition and then just come to church
[53:05] saying club and go no
[53:07] i want us to come to church meaning
[53:11] i want to feed that connection with god
[53:14] i want to see something happening when i
[53:15] come to church
[53:17] i want to break through this
[53:18] multidimension into the supernatural
[53:20] realm
[53:21] i i want to feel something extra
[53:24] so when i go home i can tell someone i
[53:26] met god today
[53:28] i you know go home go go home with that
[53:30] experience like oh yes i met god today
[53:33] i was in church today yeah i i really
[53:36] feel something today
[53:37] so when i'm going to church that's what
[53:39] i want because sometimes
[53:41] it becomes very easy you know sunday
[53:43] morning we got to go to church again or
[53:44] to the sunday it becomes
[53:46] like like any other denomination church
[53:49] but brothers and sisters
[53:50] this we are not a denomination
[53:54] and when you get that in mind we are not
[53:56] a denomination
[53:57] we are a spiritual people that have been
[53:59] called by a prophetic
[54:01] message and i trust that by god great
[54:04] this morning uh the holy spirit will
[54:06] just
[54:07] minister to you god bless you brother
[54:08] one for this opportunity again
[54:10] to come and just take the time to have
[54:11] fetishes we all and god reach the bless
[54:13] you all
[54:14] let us just turn to our feet
[54:28] let's send our bible to second peter
[54:30] chapter three
[54:33] i've been thinking that i had a message
[54:36] in mind when i
[54:37] told brother one that i was coming down
[54:39] and i say oh i saw to preach because
[54:42] instead of cody were coming so i was
[54:44] telling the thought
[54:45] but i think the spirit of god being
[54:47] changed him and taught i think over and
[54:49] over
[54:50] so i think this is the most appropriate
[54:52] one that he want me to speak
[54:54] amen so i hope that it will be a test
[54:57] giving message to you like i said
[54:59] so uh ii peter chapter
[55:03] three verse one
[55:11] before we can read the word let us just
[55:12] talk to god
[55:16] thank you jesus let us bow our heads and
[55:17] close our eyes
[55:20] our gracious father we thank you lord
[55:25] lord we've just been talking with
[55:26] brother one back and forth from the word
[55:31] we realize lord we are living such a
[55:33] time
[55:33] [Music]
[55:36] that we need more of god than ever
[55:38] before
[55:41] and lord that's why we are yet
[55:42] dismantled to just look in
[55:45] the pictures of this message the written
[55:48] word

[55:53] so that we can know what we can do
[55:54] next because everything is shaking
[55:58] nations are breaking israel's awakening
[56:01] the heart of man is fit in fear
[56:05] but lord you have given up your word
[56:07] your mind

[56:10] age to the ministry of a prophet
[56:14] so lord that's what we want to look at
[56:15] this morning oh god and just

[1:01:40] start reading from there praise the lord
[1:01:42] now i want you to follow this reading
[1:01:44] very carefully because i'm going to use
[1:01:45] that as a foundation
[1:01:46] and i trust that god give us listen
[1:01:48] robert brown said he said the name
[1:01:50] lao di which means people right
[1:01:54] was very common and was given to several
[1:01:57] cities in honor of royal lilly's
[1:01:59] sony just follow me very carefully
[1:02:04] this city was one of the most
[1:02:07] politically
[1:02:08] important and financially flourishing
[1:02:10] city in asia
[1:02:13] a numerous amount of property was
[1:02:16] equated to the city about
[1:02:17] feminine citizens it was the seat of a
[1:02:21] great
[1:02:21] medical school its people were
[1:02:25] distinguished in the arts and science
[1:02:29] it was often called the metropolis and
[1:02:31] it was the country seat
[1:02:33] for the 25th 25th
[1:02:36] other cities the peaking god watched
[1:02:39] there was zeus
[1:02:42] in fact this city was once called
[1:02:45] the polios city of zeus in honor of
[1:02:48] their god
[1:02:50] in the fourth century an important
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] council was heard there frequently
[1:02:57] earthquakes
[1:02:58] finally caused it complete abandonment
[1:03:01] praise the lord amen watch he said how
[1:03:04] fitting
[1:03:06] what the character reaches of this last
[1:03:08] age
[1:03:09] to represent the age in which we none
[1:03:12] live
[1:03:13] for example the watcher one god zeus
[1:03:17] who was the chief and father of the gods
[1:03:21] this forecast the 20th century one god
[1:03:26] five of us are religious preeminence
[1:03:28] that set forth
[1:03:30] the the brotherhood of man
[1:03:33] it is even now breaking together the
[1:03:36] protestant
[1:03:37] catalyst jews hindus etc
[1:03:40] with the intent that a metro form of
[1:03:43] water will
[1:03:44] increase our love understanding
[1:03:47] and care of each other the catholic
[1:03:50] the catalyst and the protesting are even
[1:03:52] now striving for
[1:03:54] and actually gaining ground in this
[1:03:56] union with the avoid intent that all
[1:04:00] other we follow
[1:04:04] this very attitude was seen in the
[1:04:06] united nations organization
[1:04:08] when the world leaders refused to
[1:04:09] recognize any one
[1:04:11] comes out of spiritual worship by
[1:04:13] recommending putting yourself
[1:04:15] all these separated concepts with the
[1:04:17] hopes that all the religions become
[1:04:19] invaded in one
[1:04:21] for all desire the same goals all have
[1:04:25] the same purpose
[1:04:26] and all are basically right
[1:04:29] we are not all the same i can never be a
[1:04:32] buddhist
[1:04:33] i'm not a caddy i'm not a denomination
[1:04:36] but watch what by brown is saying but
[1:04:37] brown is just trying to
[1:04:38] express to you the characteristics of
[1:04:40] laodicea
[1:04:41] for which is 50 in our day now i'm i'm
[1:04:44] preaching though you'll be mindful of
[1:04:45] the words of a prophet
[1:04:47] and i'm reading this for you to give you
[1:04:48] the foundation on which i'm going to
[1:04:49] preach
[1:04:50] he said i just want to follow the
[1:04:51] reading because like i said we
[1:04:53] we we walk in the lag of the message of
[1:04:55] the hour but we seem like
[1:04:56] many things slip in our mind and we're
[1:04:59] forgetting what time we're living in
[1:05:01] and the thing that supposed to be most
[1:05:03] important to us we're taking the less
[1:05:04] important
[1:05:07] so i pray that god help us to remind
[1:05:08] ourselves this morning let's just
[1:05:09] continue
[1:05:10] let's just continue the reading
[1:05:13] number one said in he said notice the
[1:05:15] name laodicea
[1:05:16] the people right or justice of the
[1:05:19] people
[1:05:20] was there ever an age like that 20th
[1:05:22] century church it does oh
[1:05:24] that has seen all nations rising up and
[1:05:26] dominating equality
[1:05:28] socially and financially he said this is
[1:05:30] the age of the
[1:05:32] com communions where all men are
[1:05:34] supposedly equal
[1:05:36] though it is only so in turi this is the
[1:05:40] age of political parties
[1:05:42] who call themselves christian democrats
[1:05:44] and christian socialists
[1:05:46] now you you become sadder to the massive
[1:05:48] believer trying to get themselves
[1:05:50] involved in politics
[1:05:51] even preacher beyond the puppet today
[1:05:53] they're trying to promote politicians
[1:05:54] such as sick spirit
[1:05:56] amen i'm telling you brother you have to
[1:06:00] be very careful
[1:06:02] i trust that god would give for grace
[1:06:04] amen he said he said

[1:06:08] christian commonwealth
[1:06:10] federation etc according to our liberate

[1:06:28] that is wrong
[1:06:29] i i'm not mentioning too much on this
[1:06:31] but when i'm preaching you follow this
[1:06:32] you just said it this very carefully he
[1:06:34] said when the ancient caller odisha the
[1:06:36] metropolitan was looking forward to the
[1:06:38] one world government
[1:06:40] that we are now setting up as we think
[1:06:43] of that city
[1:06:44] being the location of a great church
[1:06:47] council
[1:06:48] we see foreshadowing the ex-economic
[1:06:51] the economical move taking place today
[1:06:55] we're in very soon we will see all the
[1:06:58] so-called christians come together
[1:07:01] indeed the church instead religion and
[1:07:05] politics
[1:07:05] are coming together the thighs are being
[1:07:08] bound
[1:07:09] the wheat will soon be ready for the
[1:07:11] ghana hallelujah but
[1:07:14] it was a center of earthquake such
[1:07:16] effort has finally destroyed it
[1:07:19] this age will end in god shaking the
[1:07:22] word the whole world
[1:07:24] that has gone off to make love with the
[1:07:26] o hallett
[1:07:28] not only will one sister crumble but the

[1:07:45] millennium

[1:07:48] with my door open
[1:07:49] when i can just get in my car and drive
[1:07:51] without even thinking about
[1:07:53] any crazy crazy thing that will happen
[1:07:55] to me
[1:07:56] because during the millennial ring is
[1:07:57] going to be a path for peace

[1:08:22] i want to give my all to god because i
[1:08:25] want to see the millennium
[1:08:28] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:08:36] but the city was rich in doomed by the
[1:08:39] wealthy it was full of culture
[1:08:43] sounds abandoned highly today the
[1:08:46] churches are rich
[1:08:47] the worship is beautiful informal
[1:08:51] but cold and dead
[1:08:54] the churches are rich the watchers the
[1:08:57] people sing the angel
[1:08:59] but they are dead in wall-e we don't
[1:09:01] want to be like that church
[1:09:03] we want to be on fire we want man our
[1:09:06] man and woman to come here play
[1:09:08] instruments with the holy spirit in
[1:09:10] their hearts
[1:09:12] that's the church i want to see
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:22] culture and education have taken the
[1:09:24] place of the spirit-giving world
[1:09:30] that's right oh my god
[1:09:34] and faith has been supported by
[1:09:37] science so that man is evicted
[1:09:40] of materialism
[1:09:44] you don't understand that greedy i'll
[1:09:45] get to that moment
[1:09:49] praise the lord i'm going to remind you
[1:09:53] amen praise the lord vibrancy in every
[1:10:03] attribute
[1:10:04] ancient lava disha is found reborn
[1:10:09] in the 20th century like this age in the
[1:10:12] mercies of god
[1:10:13] and he said may those who have an ear to
[1:10:16] hear
[1:10:16] come out of her that they be not
[1:10:19] particular of a sin
[1:10:20] and the consequence of judgment
[1:10:24] now listen what do you say yes he said
[1:10:26] the lord is beginning around the
[1:10:28] 10 of the 20th century he said perhaps
[1:10:31] nothing or says
[1:10:33] how long would it last as a servant of
[1:10:36] god
[1:10:36] who has had multitude of visions
[1:10:39] of which none has ever failed
[1:10:43] let me predict i did not say prophesy
[1:10:48] but predict that this
[1:10:51] age will end around 1977.
[1:10:56] who
[1:11:07] but listen to the reading very carefully
[1:11:09] listen very carefully
[1:11:11] he said if you were preparing a personal
[1:11:14] note here
[1:11:15] i based this prediction on seven major
[1:11:18] continuation that came to me one sunday
[1:11:21] morning
[1:11:22] in june 1933 the lord jesus spoke to me
[1:11:27] and said that
[1:11:28] the coming of the law was drawing nigh
[1:11:31] but that before he came several
[1:11:35] major events will transpire
[1:11:40] are you waking up be mouthful of the
[1:11:43] wolf of a prophet
[1:11:45] verb said on the sunday morning he said
[1:11:48] the lord jesus himself
[1:11:50] came to him he said that the coming of
[1:11:53] the lord is very
[1:11:54] close but before he comes several major
[1:11:58] events will have to happen before he
[1:12:00] come
[1:12:02] now listen very carefully he said i
[1:12:05] wrote them all down
[1:12:07] and that morning i gave both the
[1:12:08] revelation of the law
[1:12:10] you see the first vision was that muslim
[1:12:12] will even
[1:12:13] ethiopia and that nation will fall at
[1:12:17] his steps
[1:12:19] that vision surely did cause some
[1:12:21] repercussion
[1:12:22] and some were very angry when i said it
[1:12:25] and would not believe it but it happened
[1:12:28] that way
[1:12:29] he just walked in there with his muddy
[1:12:32] arms and took over
[1:12:33] the native then i had no trust but the
[1:12:36] vision also said that muslim will come
[1:12:39] to a
[1:12:39] horrible end with his own people turning
[1:12:42] on him
[1:12:42] that came to pass just exactly as he
[1:12:45] said
[1:12:48] the navigation foretold that an oscar by
[1:12:51] the name of adam hella would rise up as
[1:12:53] detective over germany
[1:12:55] and that he would draw the war into war
[1:12:59] it showed that sifa land in our and how
[1:13:02] our troops would have a terrible time to
[1:13:04] overcome it
[1:13:05] then they showed that hitler will come
[1:13:08] to a mysterious end
[1:13:10] the television was in the realm of war
[1:13:12] politics for it
[1:13:13] showing that there will be three great
[1:13:15] emptiness
[1:13:16] fascist fantasticism narcissistic
[1:13:18] communism but that the first two
[1:13:21] will be swallowed up into the term
[1:13:23] divorce
[1:13:24] and manage watch russia watch
[1:13:27] russia keep your eyes on the king of the
[1:13:30] north praise the lord
[1:13:34] the fourth vision shows the great
[1:13:36] advance in science
[1:13:44] that will come after the second world
[1:13:45] war it was
[1:13:47] he headed up in the visions of a plastic
[1:13:50] bob trip car
[1:13:51] that was running down beautiful highways
[1:13:53] on the remote control
[1:13:54] so that people appear seated in this car
[1:13:56] without a steering wheel
[1:13:58] and they were playing some sort of a
[1:13:59] game to amuse themselves
[1:14:03] the faith vision had to do with the
[1:14:05] moral problem of our age
[1:14:07] centering mercy around women
[1:14:10] god showed me that woman began to be out
[1:14:13] of their place
[1:14:14] with the grating of the vote then they
[1:14:18] cut their off their hair
[1:14:20] which signify that they were no longer
[1:14:22] on authority
[1:14:23] of a man but insist insisted
[1:14:27] on equal error equal rights
[1:14:31] or in most cases more than equal right
[1:14:34] she adopted men clothing and went into a
[1:14:36] state of undress
[1:14:38] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[1:14:40] naked
[1:14:42] except for a little fact leave that
[1:14:44] april
[1:14:45] but branson with this vision i saw the
[1:14:48] terrible perfection and moral plague of
[1:14:50] the entire world
[1:14:53] then in the six visions there arose in
[1:14:55] america and most power
[1:14:56] a most beautiful but raw woman
[1:15:00] she had a people in her complete power
[1:15:03] i believe that this was the rise of the
[1:15:05] roma catholic church
[1:15:08] he said though i knew it could possibly
[1:15:11] be
[1:15:11] a vision of some warmer rise in great
[1:15:14] power in america
[1:15:15] due to a popular vote by woman
[1:15:21] the last in seven vision was within i
[1:15:23] heard a most terrible expression that
[1:15:25] this is what i want you to come to
[1:15:26] because
[1:15:27] like i said be mindful of the wars of a
[1:15:30] prophet
[1:15:31] jesus taught wedding brown that this
[1:15:33] ever event when it took
[1:15:35] when after the seventh event take place
[1:15:36] that would be total discretion
[1:15:38] and what's better brown the last vision
[1:15:41] he saw
[1:15:42] was the wrath of the powerful woman in
[1:15:43] america
[1:15:45] he said after this when he saw right
[1:15:47] after this he said
[1:15:49] he said the last and seven weeks i was
[1:15:51] with him i heard a most terrible
[1:15:53] explosion
[1:15:54] as i tend to look i saw nothing but
[1:15:57] depressed
[1:15:58] catches and smoke all over the land of
[1:16:00] america
[1:16:02] what time are we
[1:16:09] he said based on this seven vision along
[1:16:12] with the rapid changes which have
[1:16:14] swapped the world in the last 50 years
[1:16:16] i predict i do not prophesy that this
[1:16:19] vision will have all come to pass by
[1:16:21] 1977. listen what he said
[1:16:23] and though many may feel that there is
[1:16:25] an in
[1:16:26] in responsible statement in view of the
[1:16:28] fact that jesus said
[1:16:32] that no man know at the end of the hour
[1:16:34] a statement in this prediction
[1:16:36] after 30 years because jesus said jesus
[1:16:40] did not say no man could know the year
[1:16:42] month or week in which his coming was to
[1:16:44] be completed
[1:16:45] so i repeat as sincerely believe
[1:16:49] and maintain as a private student of the
[1:16:51] world
[1:16:52] along with divine inspiration that 1977
[1:16:56] auto terminate
[1:17:00] the wash system and also in the
[1:17:03] millennium
[1:17:04] i will leave that to you and your pastor
[1:17:06] to think
[1:17:08] before we say brother otis you give me
[1:17:10] some interpretation but listen to me
[1:17:13] he said now let me say this can anyone
[1:17:15] prove any of this vision wrong
[1:17:19] where they're not all fulfilled yes each
[1:17:22] one has been fulfilled
[1:17:24] all is in the process right now
[1:17:28] muslim evil ethiopia successfully then
[1:17:30] fell
[1:17:31] and lost it all hella started war he
[1:17:33] could not finish and die mysteriously
[1:17:36] communism took over both the other two
[1:17:38] incidents the plastic bobcat has been
[1:17:40] built
[1:17:41] and is awaiting only a better network of
[1:17:43] roads that want to already build the
[1:17:45] roads
[1:17:46] woman at all but naked
[1:17:51] and even now worry tape let's buy this
[1:17:53] shoot
[1:17:55] did i tell the people in my church you
[1:17:56] know i wanted to preach something
[1:17:57] different what come but i preached this
[1:17:58] message
[1:17:59] last week in my church and i said and
[1:18:00] the holy spirit tell me okay just preach
[1:18:02] the message here
[1:18:04] so it was not something intentionally
[1:18:05] died but it was just led by the spirit
[1:18:06] of god
[1:18:07] so i'm not yet targeting anybody praise
[1:18:10] the lord
[1:18:10] praise the lord he said he said women
[1:18:13] are naked
[1:18:14] and what even now wearing topless
[1:18:15] bathing suit and just the other day i
[1:18:18] saw in the magazine the very dress that
[1:18:20] i saw in my vision
[1:18:22] so while brad brown was living he saw in
[1:18:24] democracy the fulfillment of his vision
[1:18:27] sister where time are we living in be
[1:18:29] mindful of the words of a prophet
[1:18:34] praise the lord
[1:18:39] he said it was a plastic transparent
[1:18:41] type of cloth with tiny darkened spot
[1:18:43] that covered both breasts in the small
[1:18:45] area and then there was a dark place
[1:18:46] like a smart apron below
[1:18:48] and he said he said the capital church
[1:18:50] is on the rise
[1:18:52] we have her one we we have ha
[1:18:55] won't cut the president and we're not
[1:18:58] that

[2:06:34] the chat and said
[2:06:35] oh you think this position that we this
[2:06:38] place in remember is for us we can go
[2:06:40] take it
[2:06:40] the only thing on his mind now physical
[2:06:43] inheritance
[2:06:45] how you want to get this how you want to
[2:06:47] get that you forget about the word of
[2:06:49] the prophet
[2:06:51] he's not paying attention to the
[2:06:52] prophecy anymore that elijah have
[2:06:54] prophesied that he's going to die
[2:06:56] they didn't take the time they didn't
[2:06:58] take the date
[2:06:59] they didn't take the meaning and that's
[2:07:00] what i'm telling you we don't know the
[2:07:02] hour
[2:07:03] we don't know the time but what we
[2:07:04] should be doing now in church
[2:07:06] running after money running after all
[2:07:08] these things when we see event may clap
[2:07:10] our prophet said
[2:07:11] we need to wake up
[2:07:14] this may become so blind
[2:07:19] all year but think about prosperity
[2:07:22] blessing now why it's very careful i'm
[2:07:24] so close listen so when joseph
[2:07:26] verse 2
[2:07:29] and it came to pass in the third year
[2:07:32] that jehoshaphat the king of judah came
[2:07:34] down to the king of israel now
[2:07:35] very careful for the rest of you and the
[2:07:38] king of israel said unto his seven
[2:07:40] know ye that raymond in gilead is ours
[2:07:43] and we be still and it it is not out of
[2:07:47] the
[2:07:48] hand of the lord of this and it is not
[2:07:50] out of the
[2:07:51] hands of the king of syria
[2:07:55] and he said unto jessica would that go
[2:07:57] with me to battle
[2:07:59] i was telling my church last week
[2:08:02] i said you see christian when they in
[2:08:06] need then they come to church
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] people people only go to church maybe
[2:08:13] when they're in the desperate condition
[2:08:15] they want the pastor to do something for
[2:08:17] them or they want this brother or the
[2:08:18] one sometimes
[2:08:19] you don't call your brother for two td
[2:08:20] moves oh you don't call yourself you

[2:21:41] jehoshaphat said
[2:21:42] is there not hap it's just not yet a
[2:21:45] prophet of the lord besides that we
[2:21:48] might inquire of him the manner is not
[2:21:52] looking correct
[2:21:54] yay i'm not seeing something brainy
[2:21:57] inside

[2:21:59] change i need to feel on the world
[2:22:02] i need something to tell me who i am i
[2:22:04] need something to change my life

[2:22:08] pastor will preach the word
[2:22:11] i need to sit on the ministry that the
[2:22:13] power of the
[2:22:14] power of the change and he said
[2:22:17] there's nobody else here and the king of
[2:22:19] israel said unto
[2:22:20] jehoshaphat there is yet one man
[2:22:24] glory to god one voice
[2:22:27] in this age he said there is one man
[2:22:31] mackay the son of imma but when we may
[2:22:34] inquire of the lord

[2:22:38] why you hate the man the man not telling
[2:22:40] you anything to me i want to tell you
[2:22:42] the word
[2:22:45] but you see when you fail to remember
[2:22:46] what the prophet has said
[2:22:48] that's what can happen to you
[2:22:52] that's what i'm here to remind you the
[2:22:53] money be mindful
[2:22:55] and have faith to go back to the mercy
[2:22:58] you fail to remember what elijah said
[2:23:00] because he has sat on me wrong teaching
[2:23:04] for so many years so he ain't not the
[2:23:07] true voice of god
[2:23:08] but he listen the fact of the matter is
[2:23:10] he knew
[2:23:13] you getting what i'm saying that's what
[2:23:14] jesus said he said not everyone that
[2:23:16] said allah will enter the kingdom
[2:23:18] but he that do it the will of my father
[2:23:20] he says somewhere come to me on that day
[2:23:22] and say lord we prophesy
[2:23:23] we preach we do many things but you will
[2:23:26] say depart from me because you walk of
[2:23:27] iniquity
[2:23:30] you know the man telling you the truth
[2:23:32] you know what we're preaching as real
[2:23:34] but you're faithful and leave it but
[2:23:37] your judgment will be on your own hands
[2:23:40] so i have failed to remind remember the
[2:23:43] word
[2:23:45] they said i got one guy here called
[2:23:46] makaya jesus if i say here bring the man
[2:23:50] but i hate him but he does not prophesy
[2:23:52] that good concerning me but evil
[2:23:54] in jersey first said let not the king
[2:23:56] say so
[2:23:58] and the king of abraham said unto joseph
[2:24:00] there is okay restraint
[2:24:02] nine then the king of israel caught an
[2:24:05] officer and said hasting
[2:24:08] hida makai the son of imla and the king
[2:24:11] of israel and joseph are the king of
[2:24:12] judah sat ish
[2:24:14] on his own throne having put on their
[2:24:16] robes in the va place
[2:24:17] in the entrance of the gate of samaria
[2:24:19] and all the prophet prophesied before
[2:24:21] them
[2:24:21] right and zedekiah the son of
[2:24:24] chanting made him horns of anger and he
[2:24:27] said
[2:24:28] dusty at the law how can the man so much
[2:24:30] lie
[2:24:33] you want to say a man was staying in the
[2:24:37] puppet
[2:24:38] and lie look at this man
[2:24:42] standing right in the midst of the
[2:24:44] people and saying dos you know what dost
[2:24:45] yet the law is
[2:24:49] and he said thus you're the law with
[2:24:51] this shadow post
[2:24:52] the syrians that have consumed them but
[2:24:56] let me tell you something before i close
[2:24:58] when you fail to heed to the truth
[2:25:01] god will allow you to believe the law
[2:25:04] that because of that lie you believe
[2:25:06] will lead you to your destruction
[2:25:09] because they have failed to acknowledge
[2:25:11] the words of elijah the truth
[2:25:14] god raised those mental giving a
[2:25:16] deceiving spirit
