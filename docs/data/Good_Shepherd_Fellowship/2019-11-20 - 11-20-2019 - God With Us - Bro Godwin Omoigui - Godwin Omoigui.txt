name of the Lord Jesus Christ what can we say about the weekend amen was in the tremendous let's appreciate the law tonight with her hand a praise [Applause] praise the Lord amen I was I thought that after the service like what we have on had on the weekend we would just make the service special to 90 men to appreciate the law for all that he did for us amen so we will have a but then have a testimony we were having to come quickly and then we sing a song we would take another test morning and then we go into a world of prayer before we go into the preaching tonight last Sunday last weekend was a special weekend it was a very wonderful moment there was no doubt that God honored his word for the Bible says for two or three agreed in his name that he is in fact I remember after the service I went to the pastor's office but a Darrell was there I told him I said when we gather in heaven which I look back and wish I remember this day referring to the service little did I know that a devil was planning a counter-attack so that is not new it wasn't the last it wasn't the first and it wouldn't be the last so I went home very early I start my shift 5 a.m. so by 4:00 I'm up I pray I go to wake so I came open my truck and I saw a chief came in opened ransacked everything tender cappers every single thing in the car and from what happened you could see that that was a veteran it was just not a novice I was so taken aback I just stood for a while and then I started singing and you know I just sat in the truck and I drove to wake you know what even baffled me the most most of the times I would leave my wallet in the truck as a matter of fact my wife is most security-conscious than me she would lock the door but it was open and I didn't care so much about my personal the debit cards and my credit cards I didn't care much about it but I have a company credit card with unlimited funds and I was wondering what would have happened you know sometimes I start wake at 3 a.m. and by 2 I'm in the parking lot and I was wondering what would have happen if I had walked in at that time probably the fellow was armed I have seen situations where they will take somebody at gunpoint carry us to the ATM and you would think after taking the money don't let go of you know then they carry you somewhere and is a different story and all that was just playing back but as God would have it that didn't happen but I had a lot of information in the car so my personal information and that of my wife is out there now I had to sign up for how do they call it LifeLock yesterday so taken that was just the end not me there was another showdown my elder son Danny called he bought a car and you needed to notarize some forms so we're going to pick him up now I was in the left lane there was a truck in the right lane a Ford truck e350 those big four buses and I as soon as we started moving I saw that that God between us was narrowing up so I slowed down and I started blowing my horn then he just veered in into my lane and then went to the extreme left and then stopped so I just drove past I didn't say anything then I said why would he do this so we just drove past I came back in the night that was Monday in the night I had two attacks in my dream and you know I'm not used to sharing bad dreams if it is not something that would encourage or uplift you I don't [ __ ] except it is a spiritual dream something that would encourage us then I'm compelled to but attacks something that will make the devil happy our outer are not I don't I don't share those dreams but you know God has been so good that was Monday night Tuesday morning I went to wake and I have never been so distracted on the job like Tuesday there were ten reasons why everything was supposed to go wrong but it didn't happen and at one time it happened I was supposed to put some ingredients in a mix it was lying down I didn't put it in it was one I transferred it to the next page that was when I remembered and you know this is an R&D setting everything we do there you know the plans are just waiting for it and you can't imagine screwing up something like that so I just wanna solve I do and I just prayed because everything that goes downstream if there is a mistake they will see it they do a lot of analysis downstream so they will see it so I just prayed and asked God to send out his angel to carry that ingredient add it inside there and just left it and I was just praying as I stood there and we went through there ran to the end and nothing happened and it's just amazing when I went downstream my colleague that told me that the developers are already taking their samples as I so soon he said yes and I went and I took a sample I tested it there was absolutely nothing wrong with it praise be to God and you know that was yesterday today I was going to work I said what is the next thing that devil is going to do I got wet everything was so fine somebody was supposed to work somewhere and they were went to the MgO they asked me to take over I went there it was a mixed platform now we have super sucks two thousand pounds that there is a hoist you would lift it now when you lived a super shock there are two bucks the outer and the inner so when you loosen the first one then you drag it in with a device then you loosen the one in the inside then the ingredient would come down this was conflab 2,000 pounds and when I was trying to loosen it it was hard to loosen it it's what tired of so I used the knife and then I cut it and then I took the rope off little did I know that I was taking the inner loop the inner loop out I didn't know so I just took the road I cut it and I drew it off and then the bag just came down a little I didn't know that I had taken the rope out and probably maybe from this distance the way better airiness so I just drag it in and as soon as it got to the hopper it just came down over oh so all along the rope was not even there I didn't know but so you know daredevil made a move in every one of the devil's moves but also made a move the Bible says when the devil comes against us like a flood he will the Spirit of God will lift up a standard against him and I saw the hand of God in every one of these it I mean it was just too amazing we are serving a Living God I want to encourage us I don't know what other devil is going to do but the devil would not surprise me in anything praise the Lord that's what you can expect after the good service on the weekend I mean but he can try it or he can let's let's just try this song tonight whatever it takes the song that I've been wanting to to for us to practice a long time there serve Ward's calling me from the old tree and they whisper draw closer to me [Music] leave your world Fabi hi there's a new high to class and the new line a Meenu for whatever Hey to draw closer to you that's what I'll be willing to yes and whatever it to be more like you password I'll be

there praise the Lord since the catering has a testimony [Music] I have all my notes on my phone and it's not working so I'm gonna try this I actually have two testimonies one was when like a few months before me and that started coming back to church we had been like wanting to for a long time and just nothing wasn't really working out or we've kept forgetting about it or whatever and then I think it was a Sunday right well we I don't remember if we came the first time was a Sunday every Wednesday anyways it's not matter we came we finally got here and like before we came it just felt like to me that like it was just going to happen like we were just gonna go and it just felt different I guess and we that night brother one was talking about the binding power and I don't know how long he had been talking about it before then but that was the first time I had heard it obviously him talking about it during that time or whatever and just after that service the thought kept coming back to me that that someone had bound me oh and I just was like well how would I know that there's only that way that I could know that so I just kept pushing it away and then um the next time I know it was a Wednesday night brother one invited being a net to watch the service live or whatever and I couldn't make it that time because Josh was out of town and my kids go to sleep at 7:00 so I had to stay home with them obviously so I couldn't make it and so I I was really like I just put them to bed and then I saw his invitation to watch a stream at live or whatever so I joined and then in that service he was he was saying that he had written both my name and in debts and he wanted check and give it to God and I just wanted to share that with you for two reasons just to encourage you that when brother one preaches things he takes it into his own life and applies it in his own life and I wanted you to know that God did that during that time when he was preaching those sermons about the binding power my second testimony is um so back in 2015 shortly after I had my first born I was diagnosed with a kaliesha and achalasia is an autoimmune disease as far as they know they don't know a lot about it because it's rare but as far as they know it's a autoimmune disease that attacks the esophagus like the muscle in the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't work properly so it just it's closed all the time and it's hard to get food to pass through into your stomach um and they usually typically the only there's like three options for treatment or whatever but none of them are there's no cure for it and none of them are perfect and there's other things that can go wrong so I decided not to do anything and I right away in the when I was diagnosed I just trusted and believed that everything was going to be for God's glory and I loved I lost sight of that for a long time but it was somewhere there so then I've struggled with my weight at one point I didn't know it I thought I was a hundred and twenty pounds but I was a hundred and ten pounds at one point so I've struggled with all of that eating and everything it's a bit hard but then brother Ezekiel was preaching and he called up a prayer line and he called up ever anyone who was sick and I'm not sure it was I I had my eyes closed but I think I was the first person he prayed for and he just he was speaking in Spanish so I didn't understand what he was saying but then he said receive it and I just felt like I did receive it so ever since then I'm pretty sure I've attained at least five pylons since that service and I still have a lot of the symptoms but I just know that I'm healed just all of the fear and the word is gone [Applause] praise the Lord Amy your grace and mercy has brought me true I'm living this

fables of man amen and that you to accept the message of your day this implication - that brings a lot and to assure you that a lot of teenagers read it's not something that you want it may know if you want it is even if your desire even though you design it but because you are of God you can help yourself compared to all that is of the world the science of the world all those things there are better place you want to see to be but here you are in this message so I want to tell you the implication of it and that I will type it to our prophet I come so I don't want to see I can break it down praise the Lord like I said you we are already ordained of God from the foundation of the world is a currency when we are of God we have been in court even before Genesis right and that is why we have what we call the seed gel that is deposited in our heart in your soul is there so that is why when you hear the voice of mama ego will hear the voice of God generally there is something in you the anchors that makes you fall in love and to make you recognize the voice of your day because you are a being of God okay you see what I'm saying so I'm saying that data as it may there is no way you

understand this thing I'm always on the rooftop 24/7 amen so that's what we are by believing this message of your day now the message we are following today let it be said to you harder it is to William a problem message may see it stolen my brother Joe seed our copper Bonjour this is God's letter written to you and me to come back he brings you in praise the Lord and we don't know amen that discontinuity in God you stole your prayers better it's not as you first to moist your payment of tithes but don't let that be clouded up not be is probably block those things you must do but it is not those things what constraints you is that you it is love that is actually love that constraint to choose to forsake the things of this world to forsake the denomination and to forsake everything about this world and come to God and that is what you are praise the Lord how does how do how does he do it God have to send a prophet it has always been a prophet there's continuity in God the purpose is to continue his ministry amen God even look at time it's always 24/7 it never feels sin science we project in doubt to no happiness 15 years easy it's not a put it there like that so also in its word it put it in the way that it must continue praise the Lord some quotes here the Lord to call is bright you use these prophets and we do know that we don't sometime as gentle nations we are gentle nations we are not whatever noise from whatever you know what it takes to to to have the prophets like the Jews who knows is to read a turn about movies fine difficulty to defend you got to break away from it because they understand the importance of a prophet so when we change our nation don't know let me let me let me let me let me stress more on all this relation she we are we good the leadership is a as long as we are part of him we can never come off lost there is no way that you can come up lost you surely we get that OD goes it gives you that it's your right if I don't you buy know me you have it usually we have it that's only because there is something dependence it didn't seem a meat-eater see telling you that making doctoral tax is dead deposited even when you don't even know him we are watching a chicken ban ban you know and o'clock lobby looking down but we are ego look it up by that's in your soul by that teacher alone in your soul you are a miniature God please get a clear me natural go deeper courses which means that will have the power we have that with the color leap to Messiah because we have him in portion so that makes it a little easier that makes it we are we are then boom of the same boom with God we have flesh or mr. fresher God praise the Lord uh no indication they can never be a wave you can be separated from God this war that can take you away from God absolutely impossible because you have answered home what is already in your soul is there permanent you can get yourself you know you can help yourself okay you maybe you want to say I will serve God again the Lord has a way of disciplining his own he has a warp disability soul the Bible say him I love a chest highs he disciplines his soul he will discipline you we praise the Lord as if reason you don't seem to are not catching it if you know that there is no debt for a Christian you will see them looking up like that what is that separation for that teacher to be the post angel so you can never be separated from your God it's not possible you can never be separated from God because you are part and parcel of him we have physical debt we have somebody don't pass away from us know what the Bible said no see we don't know we don't we pour more ask people who don't have hope we just feel that we're not gonna see him again maybe it's I don't like you appreciate okey now you don't see me you see that bragging again you know we meet again there is that confidence praise the Lord that is not on ecology they can never be you can never be stable you can about that you cannot be stopped with the phone go I don't see a way I can't look at my hand because we are part of God as this curse only give me a knife to cut my hand away I don't I just don't like this and you can't do that your system is wrong with you that is right ease will you see you are good to be separate from God you can never constant is the positive that is the final truth because the evidence that you inserted all of the message of your day the message of your duty is the messy prop I will a modern brown I am NOT talking about my belief as among Here I am today by all believers until about believers hallelujah Nina we better check the water go to hats I lived a life by the message of the hour I struggle I to God Almighty come with me Jesus hallelujah are they brought us the prophets are you able to recognize it is the main thing many will look at it and criticize but you pick it up are you embrace it in order to do you a Martian let me tell you let me tell you one more thing again is something this is a fact it's not only can't disprove being that you are that they can never be a rapture take place without you being so dead that can never be a Rachel we have you be part of each it's not possible that's the be name of the Lord this is the message of the rapture you promise said did you actually feel lies the pages of the message of the hour there we go that's where our confident lays that's what we go with borders that are we movie confident with our Torah t without written a resort believing that we are of God we go hippos blessed be the name of the Lord now this super-sized SuperSave professor let me just stop war see profit what is a profit that was sent to rose mm-hmm they go hippos what's the profit Emily do you place a bit anymore the Lord yeah I

to talk about Jesus there's nothing again I'm not a politician when I will find Georgia's won't give me the joy to talk apartment the Lord Jesus he may not even I want to read something for you so I'm connecting you now to the Prophet I want to connect you now to him oh all right okay now he went out speaking out bless the bees okay trying to jump something where there's so many things to talk about here but I'm trying to call them shots because of time frame here now we might speak here just a minute what is a prophet now in English time according to English dictionary it means a preacher that's English version of what the Prophet is but in the Hebrew language in Hebrew times as he call is called Asia as a swer is here is here was the one who had the interpretation of the written word and he foresaw things that was to come and when he spoke of the things that was to come and prove that he was here then he knows they know that he had the right interpretation of the scripture because God through him listener I'm coming I spoken about you know anything about the the Eliza our answer for this day of all time they've got go to him Manifest said the written scripture for that day amen amen don't be slow through the province Eddie wake up that was the land identification of a sealer in Fort Ella a teleport I don't know where that in order it was getting the right interpretation to
