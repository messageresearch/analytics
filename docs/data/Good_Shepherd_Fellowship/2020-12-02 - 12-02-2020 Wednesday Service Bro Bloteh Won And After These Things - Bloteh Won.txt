the lord amen amen amen [Music] revelation chapter 19 let's turn to the book of revelation tonight thank you musician if the law would just keep us in the singing spirit we might do a little more of that after the service tonight but let's just read a portion of the word tonight praise the lord amen revelation chapter 19. just i want to trust the lord i want to do something tonight and and sister faith sorry i kind of sent just a bunch of things i had them all separate out in a way but i just pulled them together and sent it over revelation chapter 19 let's read from verse 1 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah amen praise the lord we have we we start singing it from here amen praise the lord that's why you have to put your you put your soul into singing there amen we'll talk a little bit about that hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god praise the lord for truth and raptures are his judgment for he have george the great hold which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and have avenged the blood of his sins at her hand and again they said hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever praise the lord and the four and and and 20 others and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah praise the lord amen and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his seven and all that fear him both small and great amen are they smart and great in the house tonight amen praise the lord amen amen and i heard an and it were a voice of a great multitude and as and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunders thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god only putin reigneth amen praise the lord let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we just want to ask your blessings upon your word that we have read tonight father uh pray the lord you just just help us tonight oh god us we would just look into your word and pray that you come and give us grace come speak to us lord in a way that when you can in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord praise the lord are we together amen are you are we in the house tonight amen praise the lord the lord god unimportant reyneth now when you look into this uh uh uh revelation chapter 19 and we just read uh out of these verses i'm kind of running my mind true to be show because uh i think i see uh hallelujah in verse one and hallelujah in verse three and i see amen hallelujah in verse 4 praise the lord and i see uh hallelujah for the lord god unimportant reigneth and that is in verse 6. are you seeing any other hallelujah amen if you're looking through your bibles write right in there is there any other hallelujah praise the lord if you find any you let me know amen but i think there is four hallelujah right in the passage there now uh i want to speak a little bit on the subject i would just i'll just give you a title here from verse one and after these things after these things after one thing now this this will also help us to see that when the bible was written originally it was not written in chapters like we have amen it was a straw so it was just written on it was just written on because uh in in a good in in a good english setting after these things gave you an idea for you to look back so after these stains nobody start a letter saying after these things the next question they will ask what things praise the lord so uh uh it was it was over over a certain amount of years i was looking at some of the history today and of where the bible was actually put into chapters and verses just to be able to to to help us that we will not get bored just just reading this straw you know uh just on and on so uh uh they put it into into chapters and verses but after these things now after walking after destruct the destruction of the great hall the last time we run a parallel with babylon and the new jerusalem and [Music] but you you will see here that john said after these things after after the destruction of rome after the destruction of that of that great dragon after the destruction you know of that of that hallowed church then the apostle john says i heard a great voice of much people saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god amen i mean sometimes i mean we just we just sign that song and and and we have to sing it again and we have to sing it again just to wake you up to say hallelujah and we have to sing it again just to get you a little bit into the music and we have to sing it again [Laughter] praise the lord now is is is there is no way we can we can really be able to put in our mind what this scene or the the expression of this sin you know the the the the rejoicing of these people that is having this expression that john is describing here hallelujah salvation glory honor and power unto our god praise the lord and just like i said the last time there is no way that you can be able to really imagine what it will be to be completely free from sin praise the lord amen you know you give your heart to the lord and and and you you you get a little taste of that honey on the rock and you just think oh my goodness oh god it's so good to me you read the bible you cried and and and you praise the lord and and it looks like everything and then and then and then not too long the battle stats amen praise the lord the battle starting and things start going you know crazy oh my goodness what is this praise the lord and and and you know uh uh uh you know is is is is jesus said as asks the father anything in my name is you know you just feel like uh uh you know it's it's it's just like your athlete dad you you're running to him and and you ask him and they expect him to give it to you right now you know and then you prayed and and and and god started teaching you to wait and and patient and he started teaching you different things and and pretty soon you know you have the the the test of your faith you know and and and then as you go on you realize that you know you you slip and fall you miss you you make mistake you say things that you're not supposed to say you regret and and trust comes to your mind you feel bad about it and then that god in his mercy come around and and and and give you a revival amen no matter how he did it whether it is in the preaching service whether it is in your house whether you know whatever it is god comes around and he gives you a special touch and it's almost like you get on fire again praise the lord devil i don't care whatever you do to me oh satan you cannot make it with me god is on my side i mean you get so revived and then as the week goes on again the battle gets tough oh god help me jesus oh jesus oh my goodness help me a lot praise the lord amen then you read a book or you listen to a song or you you come to a service and and and the grace of god comes and pick you up again and you drum in the spirit you are worshiping you are so happy shouting to the top of it hallelujah praise the lord and then after a couple of weeks again the battle goes on the enemy comes around to frustrate you and out of there and on and on and on and on but to know that there is coming a day praise the lord there is coming a day where the last evil thought will come praise the lord the last doubt will flow through your mind there's coming a day where the last time you have to choose your words praise the lord now so when you look right here the reason why i was counting those hallelujah because we know 40 is the number of deliverance amen that's just why i was counting it because that was just what was on my mind you know it's it's an expression of deliverance is an expression of deliverance finally finally we have come to this place much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation glory honor power i mean salvation means to be safe he has that greek word sozo brother branham said he said do what i to mean it has to do with the saving of your soul and the healing of your body we can say that we are safe safe from sin saved from sicknesses praise the lord hallelujah and all of that just because finally finally finally this thing that god allowed to manifest his attribute is now being destroyed amen it started as a spirit it moves on it became a kingdom and it moves on it became a religion it moves on it entered into politics it became the evil of the word that troubled the word in every way in every form of evil you can trace it right back to this every form of evil you can trace it right back to this praise the lord amen amen now the reason why i'm going this way you will you will see as we go along a little bit and uh uh you know all during the week i've been having this thought on my mind i've been having that song in my mind i've just been kind of for imagining you know uh uh i mean this this kind of for worship verse uh six again and i heard uh a word a voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god unimportant rinith praise the lord amen when we get into this celebration praise the lord we get into this celebration here i mean it's it's awaiting us each and every one of us will come to that place where we can express that hallelujah i don't care how you try to express it now it will never be like it is written down here this expression is going to have a different feeling that you have never known it's not only going to be a shout it's not just going to be a shout it's going to be a feeling that would go through your body praise the lord we can look forward to it amen if there is one thing we can look forward to in our future is this expression is is is uh is the fulfillment of this praise the lord amen amen i believe even like paul says if this effortless tabernacle be dissolved he says there is another one within us now if if if a sin the brother or the sister is down with some kind of a sickness and and they die they step into their new body praise the lord but even their body that they step into even though they don't feel no pain no sickness they will they are still not at the place to have this expression praise the lord they are they they are not yet at the place to have this expression now the reason why i said that is because we know that uh is uh uh uh you know we we we leave this body and we go into uh uh a celestial body okay and as we go into the celestial body uh uh you know and and we go into a glorified body but brother branham says something i mean this this just captured my mind and i'm just saying this to be able to come back to my notes i hope i can get uh uh okay i still have a few minutes that you have to share with you what i want really want to share with you tonight and uh brother branham said he said uh this body that we that we are that we have in a way that we are made as humans okay the prophet of god said we will never be angers we will always be humans amen he says the reason why the saints on the altar were saying how long how long even though the scripture says they were saying how long because they wanted to revenge now brother branham that that's a beautiful way when you when you follow the way that god you know uh help the prophet to be able to to to talk about the scripture he says in for the fact of the day expressing revenge he says it was it was there to show that they were not gentiles they were jews just by that expression so that is not the only interpretation to that because he said the reason why they were saying how long is because they wanted to come from out of a celestial body to a terrestrial body amen that they can they can be they can be in the body like this that like we have here praise the lord are we together amen you think about it beyond the curtain of time brother branham says uh you know uh he his brother was there on uh uh you know on the bed he was there you know hawking those people my beloved brother my beloved sister you know and it was just a wonderful feeling it was a you know it was a beautiful feeling but it was yet in another body that is the body that we are kept in that is the body souls under the altars are kept in that body we there we are not just a spirit that would be ruling around we have a body but yet it is not like this body are we together amen now so he said there he says uh uh they wanted to come back to this body and they wanted they wanted to have food and water praise the lord amen i'm kind of for teasing you tonight i will i will actually go into that subject and bring a lot of material for you to look at talking about a different kind of a body but the reason why i'm saying it is that uh even when we when we get when we leave from here and get into our celestial body we still does not have the expression that is here because we were not tempted in our celestial body amen we were not tempted in our celestial body you have to come to a terrestrial body and be free from sin to know the difference am i making sense praise the lord you will say oh brother one but this body is is is is a corruptable body it's corruptable because of the same nature we are honored when god takes the same nature away amen when he takes that same nature just like in the millennium satan will be bound for the thousand years we will still be in a terrestrial body but it will be a different feeling you see that is the reason why right after the right after the thousand years my goodness when satan is released the saints are going to bounce back my goodness after we have enjoyed freedom then you're coming back to tell us no we're ready to fight this time [Laughter] praise the lord after we have enjoyed living one thousand year without evil thought no lust no headache then satan is released to come and tempt us there is no there is no two thousand it i'm going to fight him i will bite him [Laughter] [Applause] praise the lord amen let me just run you quickly through what i want to share with you tonight amen that was just an exhortation i'm looking forward for the really pie hallelujah you know he says you says you know i at kennedy church says praise the lord praise the lord can the church says hallelujah hallelujah is nothing expression here hallelujah salvation glory honor is still not the expression amen i'm not even hit 10 percent yet of this of the reality of this i'm just working out myself i walk myself up now until i'm feeling hot but it's okay but it's going to be a different thing it's going to be a different thing when you get back in your celestial body and you realize you realize that there is no evil you realize that there is no evil i love the way isaiah said it he said even the food will not earth [Laughter] okay let's let's just get to something tonight praise the lord now as i run this parallel there was something i was looking at we want to thank the law for the service we had with brother andrews that was a good service amen that was a good thanksgiving service and we had brother ortiz came in to see us and and he preached for us this gun sunday that was also a good service amen now so i want to look i want to take something here a couple of weeks ago as i was looking at all of these uh uh uh you know i was i was doing a parallel with babylon in in in in jerusalem i started looking at you know the time that we are living in and you know in in the hour that we are living in talking about that great woman a great halloween and so as i was looking at that i got i got a bit caught up into brother branham 7 vision so i started working on something that i entitled 1933 and uh but then which of course that's what i thought i was going to speak on tonight i was i i decided to work on 1933 1965 and 1977. and but then uh when brother autist preached on sunday he he started dealing with their quote that had to do with the seventh vision you know because he was telling us uh uh you know uh uh reminding us of what a prophet has said is that what he preached yes amen yeah uh so uh but why he was saying that i felt in myself as he was reading that code and which of course it happens over and over when when people start reading about the seventh vision and and it comes down to brother branham prediction about 1977 there is always a strange feeling praise the lord amen because of all that we have heard about 1977 or what we have heard that people have made out of 1977 you know so so i i i mean i was sitting right there where the uh uh where young brother simon is sitting in and uh you know uh and and you know and being a pastor you know when the people are pulling even if i'm not preaching i can feel when there is resentment in the building praise the lord i said there i'm listening to the service and sometimes i get i told brother andrews after after sunday night i told him i said brother i don't know if it is just me but sometimes a different minister preach and i get tired i feel more tired i feel more tired and and and you know the different preachers will tell you the same you know because uh uh you sit there you are you are receiving the word but also you are praying for the people to be able to receive the word you know you are praying for the people you're praying for different individuals to be able to grab what the holy spirit is saying you know the preacher will say something you say lord i wish this young man would just grab that no so i sat there and as i was uh uh [Music] uh you know listening to that i got that feeling so i said well okay it looks like i have to jump over and and look at this uh my 1977 presentation that i wanted to do now i was i was actually i'm i'm having i'm having uh you know some of my notes somewhere i was i was actually going to i started putting images to some other things i was going to say i'm not i'm not you know very good uh uh slide i don't do very good slide presentation because i quit to get distracted you know i might be saying one thing and i just leave and just go my way so uh but that's what i thought i would do tonight i said sir we had these prayer requests to pray about these needs i says what i'll exalt the people a little bit on on on revelation chapter 19 and what i would do is that i will go through a few quotes on on 1977 and and see if the holy spirit will help us to to you know to to to come together there's one thing i will say to you as a church and as your pastor i've i've never i've never believed you know even being a young man i never believed that anybody won't let me say it this way first god do not vindicate a man god do not vinnicate god will never vindicate this flesh god vindicate his word if you watch brother branham ministry he will say if if all that i've said to you is the truth he will say if all that i've said to you is the truth god will vindicate it by coming and discerning your needs so god coming in the discernment was not for brother branham it was to vindicate the word that he has preached god do not vindicate a man praise the lord and if god do not vindicate a man then there is no man that can vandicate another man praise the lord amen and sometimes there's other place where it looks like we we we we tried to to to to prove or vindicate that brother brandon was a prophet it's not your work you can't do it god do not vindicate a man praise the lord i think what our problem is is is when you take a dictionary definition of vindication vindication is used in court if i'm right sister heavy it's a word that is using caught a lot you know and uh uh you know uh uh you and and in the way that those words are used which of course in the context at the time is right but when it comes to divine things when it comes to structural things is completely different are we together amen god dedicates his word praise the lord amen so uh uh that that that is something that you know we we have to we have to we have to we have to learn we have to tell ourselves because i've heard people say that over and over you know god will vindicate me god don't bend and get a man praise the lord god vindicate his word amen when god moves on the scene because you were there or because you said something it is something that you say that pleases him when brother branham says heatherwise you said the right thing it was not only because that you know that she believed in brother branham but she says something that please god so god came down and vindicated himself vindicated that what happened that what my servant is telling you that happened back there it's true are we together now so i know many of us you know we were either little now born at a time or uh you know uh uh not in the message i know brother scat and his wife says now i mean they lived through that time of 1977 and it's good to have them as a witness to i mean to tell us what it was like being a believer after 1977 with with many of the things that people taught about what 1977 was so i would take i would just take my time i would run through my coach tonight condemnation by representation 1960 now remember that's what the law show but i predict this will take place before 1977. upon this prediction i base because of their unreached slot that's coming up i want you to underline that or if you want to write it down you can write it down because of their own rushing slot that's coming now how fast that it was moving how long it will take till this nation meet his place different thing he was talking about talking about all the divisions now so this is the picture brother branham had seven vision in 1933. are we together amen he has seven vision in 1933 and and and those vision mesology and just like uh baroque says hitler you know and and and you know and and and and those things were fulfilling now in the way that they were fulfilling you know coming to pass and things that were happening brother branham brings this prediction of 1977 praise the lord are we together and uh and and and and that's what i want us to see i want us as as as christians i want us as as as believers i'm saying that now that we are not believers i'm saying it because we as christians and believers we are students of the scriptures amen we have been taught by the lord and the lord teaches us by his word we are student of the scriptures are we together so that's the reason why i'm trying to draw your attention so you can be able to see this because we are living in a dual world we have a physical world we got to go to work we got to go to school but yet we have a spiritual life to look over amen we look for the promises of god they are not in the newspaper amen the promises of god don't come on the internet the promises of god is in his word and god have a time that he fulfilled him are we together praise the lord so brother branham is talking about he says he says i'm basing this because of the unrushing slot that is coming how fast the way things were happening so he's basing this seven vision to be fulfilled at this time are we together now you watch the language as we go along amen i know this is i mean there's no time for the wednesday night to do this but i i i'm i'm intentionally doing this so maybe i could keep you off thinking a little bit through the night or praying amen but uh ephesian church age look at this one closely it would give us maybe the uh uh the law might help us to be able to look at this closely and see he says after the efficient church age he says from 80 53 until 80 70 then he went to the next church age sister faith if you can just drop down to the uh laodicea church age or philadelphia he he goes through the different years of the church ages and he says here and from 1750 on the next age come in was the philadelphia the philadelphian he says wesley age he says that began at 19 i mean 1750 and last till 1906. and at 1906 the laudition church is set in and i don't know when it will end but i predict it will be done by 1977. now so where i would draw your mind to a little bit and i want you to to catch this is that brother branham is talking about the age praise the lord is completely different than talking about the end of the word okay because this word does not have a full stop we will continue to have events happening after the rapture there will be events taking place one evening will lead to another event but he's trying to grab our attention for us to see in the age for us to see uh an age or or a dispensation if i would say like that not really but just to be able to look at an inch bracket let me say that way now let's look at another another one here praise the lord now edition church age he says and i believe the loud jesus started 80 1906. he says i predict now remember predict especially you listening at the tape i don't i don't say it will be but predate that it will end by 1977 that the church will go completely into apostle saying what is that the rejection of the holy spirit the church will go completely into apostle saying we together amen and if you if you go back to history and uh and and even through the message you will realize that that brother branham told he told uh uh where is this brother named uh willem he was he was the the the pentecostal man there uh in uh choosing of a bride the ones whose uh uh sister uh prophesy during the message his name slipping my mind uh what is his name now i would get his name as i go along here but brother branham told him you know that uh he was going to be called mr pentecost demonstrate karen thank you the name demise i was thinking about paul was just on my mind demonstrating brother brahm told him he was going to be called mr pentecost you know and and uh and he told him that that will be just exactly at a time where penny costs her will go back to her mother and therefore that took place in 1970 are we together amen now so i mean uh uh uh uh jeremiah came on the scene and told israel that we're going into babylon for 70 years that's what he told in the book of jeremiah he got slapped in the face by zedekiah he says it will only be seven years it's not going to be seven god will not be cruel to keep us down there for 70 years when god gave the dream to to down here concerning their 70 years when daniel break out the 70 years it was it was more than just literally 70 years a spun over a period of time which of course we are staying in the bracket of the 70 years are we together as children of god what we have to understand that god do not live in our time zone god is out of our time because he is internal amen being in tenor he can come into our time zone he can come out but he's out of our time zone that's the reason why it does not bother him what is happening because he knows the end from the beginning are we together amen god told he told abraham after 400 years i would come down with a mighty hand and i would bring them out that's why he told abraham praise the lord uh uh uh testimony of a true witness brother abraham said because at the time moses came the bible said paul said that he was born a proper child he came right on time but the people were not ready so the actual if you read if you read the uh i mean the the the actual biblical timing there and also with what brother branham said before moses you know he killed the man he went at the back side of the desert you know he spent 40 years there before he could come back they have overlapped that time so it was almost about 430 years before he came and brought them out praise the lord are we together amen now i'm saying these things like i said i'm not i'm not i'm not uh uh uh trying to vindicate brother branham i may call god already benedict he's seven he did his work he's gone amen praise the lord but i'm trying to grab your attention and there is there's a reason why i'm doing this because there is there is something that that was beautiful here that i saw and i might not finish today and if the lord bless it maybe we continue on sunday he says i believe the laodicea church age 1906 he says i predict now remember predict especially you listening at the tip i don't say it would be i predict that it will end by 1970 and the church will go completely into apostasy and she will be australia out of the mouth of god revelation where god said i was speedy out of my mouth he says he says it will fulfill in that time in the sense he says and the second coming or the rapture of christ might come any time now he says i could miss that a year i can miss it 20 years i can miss it 100 years i don't know where but i just predict that i call in to a vision he's shown me and taking the time the way it is progressing the way things are progressing after mesoline and masculinity died hitler came to a disgraceful end and all of those things happening praise the lord paul says we that are alive and remain he never said there he was he did not print to us he pointed to himself and those that were in his generation are we together praise the lord that is the thing with god dealing with with hima intent of god dealing with him sometimes god comes down and and and he deals with us he affects our life his presence becomes so real just like i said until you think satan you are done i will never i will never you can never get me again praise the lord then after two weeks he said lord was that experience really real what is happening oh my goodness what is happening i mean god was so real i heard his voice praise the lord amen elijah on my camera saying the god that answered about fire let him be god god came down go under his word the fire of god strike from heaven with all the water that was poured on the altar the fire of god consumed the sacrifice praise the lord and then it was just a couple of months down the road god was asking elijah what do a dare year what's happening elijah praise the lord amen that is the reason why faith is a very important substance a very important substance you know that god gives to the believer when he quicken that thing in your heart praise the lord amen are we together so he says i could miss it a hundred years i don't know but the way i see things progressing i predict are we together uh um seven to week i dropped down to the second one sister faith i think so i haven't seen them here he says the way the way progress is going i predict that there at the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predict that that uh that all happened between right now 1933 and 1977 and and not ignoring it okay he says and not knowing it god knows my heart i never know until yesterday that uh 1977 is the jubilee now i i look at this he says that's exactly the same amount of time that runs out that he gave with israel and everything at the end now so i'm still looking at this quote because i'm trying to find the period of the jubilee that brother branham was talking about so i'm still looking at that and i i will share with you uh i will i will get back to that because he's he's he's he's bringing that into into leviticus there's a place where he mentioned it talking about the scene a lot of time now so uh uh i mean they're they are just they are just uh uh okay let's uh let's let's take another one here uh that would be the low edition church age this one will cut this one comes right out of the church-ish book okay we we're we are over nine o'clock so i'm going to stop but this is where i i think the whole thing gets interesting okay brother branham as he was seeing those visions fulfilling he was at the faith fulfillment are we together amen and there was there was two left the the sixth fulfillment was the great woman that he saw amen now so it he fed inspire after the election when when when kennedy was elected praise the lord now so you take this and also take when brother branham talked about a great woman stand up in the united states he says a great woman and in many of those courts he make a lot of emphasis to the catholic church praise the lord but all of these years the catholic church has been rising in in united states but people been looking for a woman to become a president they are looking for a physical woman to become a president and they have not been watching the rise of the catholic church are we together now so see the bridge here now see the bridge that's the thing that caught my attention see the bridge because of the the the women vote it was just at that time woman was given the right to vote and because of their vote it brought in the first catholic president it inspired brother branham that this thing is setting the stage for the great woman to rise and if it is running like this are we together are you seeing the picture amen but that was just the beginning of the rise of the woman she was just getting up in a spiritual form are we together but even with all of that that was happening because he constantly said a great woman she could be a president even a vice president she kept saying it so the eye that's the way we humans are that's why our five senses connect us to physical things praise the lord by his tribe you are healed when do we wait to say we are healed it's when we feed it it's when we see it but with god he have already said it and when he said it it is just as it is gone so the preacher comes and he read the promises of god it's in isaiah 53 it's a finnish work and what is what is doing is that it's raising your faith amen to me that finished work with god brother brown said if jesus was here today if you come to him he will says i've already done it amen all you need is for your faith to rise and accept what he has already done amen are we together amen are you comfortable to go home tonight are you feeling like i didn't confuse you [Laughter] praise the lord [Laughter] oh praise the lord amen well i pray for you you pray for me we will continue amen the lord bless you listen to our feet let's buy our heads heavenly father lord we know with you there is no controversy you are not the author of confusion so lord we we just want to thank you tonight father we want to thank you we want to praise you we want to glorify your holy name dear lord we we have not alternated yet like the great apostle paul says we have narutini but father we are forgetting those things in the past and we're looking forward we are reaching out we are reaching out and say father take our hands tonight lord father there there are different ways our mind think of trusting [Music] you hear people say i'm trusting god that's why i'm coming to church [Music] i'm trusting god that's why i believe the word of god but father we really want to trust you we want to trust you in a true sense of

to this time we that are coming forth we we believe that you can hold us you can carry us through no matter what comes no matter what rises no matter what the internet says no matter what is publicized [Music] that true substance of faith cannot be explained father there is no way like your prophet said it's not comparing quotes with cults it's not comparing scripture with scripture there's a supernatural element that you release to your children that you release to your people to believe you even lord god when we are feeling even when we are not at our best even when it is not what we expect there is that divine energy that reach out and say lord here i am father we thank you tonight we appreciate you lord father you know where my heart is you know what i was thinking about lord garden and i almost left the subject tonight father but i just thank you lord the grace that you gave the window you opened father the understanding you released to the church lord father to be

to put other first lord than ourself oh god oh father lord teach us lord jesus oh god father lord to fall in love with you not to fall in love with a church not to fall in love with a man no but to fall in love with you because your love is completely different than the human love father teach us lord jesus teach us oh god as we as as as we are longing to separate from this selfish nature lord
