him my son but he's one that I saw the uh started preaching on our ministry when we started back about 1993 94 and uh that's that was one of the brothers we first God really gave us the opportunity to really see uh uh get a first-hand experience of the supernatural this brother was caught up into a building that was exploded uh a rocket fell on the building and he and his friend was dead and and the particles of the rock of the rocket sent both of them paralyzed the friend did they not made it to the hospital but he made it to the hospital and they had to they had to move into secession of hospitals because of his condition and also the medical facilities were not good at the time But as God will have it the Lord put a special loving kid on his heart for one of the major surgeon that was in the country at the time and uh Dr Coleman he was over one of the the country Hospital in the northeast of the country if I get my my location right and God will made us to travel to that region yes that's where actually uh we we uh that's why actually we started our first church actually brother Jabez and cametta that has been here with us couple of times he's our friend he's in that region now they're having uh some special services and dedicating some church but walker uh he's a native of the region been working in that place and and man the Lord is the Lord is Blessing and doing the great work among them and they have been able to raise uh this is almost about uh about four six churches now so brother JBS is there the uh dedicating some of the buildings that they built and then also having some meetings towards the gaining border uh we're getting border with Liberia and also where Ivory Coast border with Liberia so brother James sent his greetings spoke with him yesterday and I also brought a walker sent his greetings brother Brooks and brother Trot also over in Liberia we brought a larger they're saying their greetings spoke with them yesterday as well and uh so we want to thank the lord we want to thank the Lord the Lord was gracious he granted brother William and myself a safe trip uh this past week we were down in in Leslie the UK having some meetings there with brother Crosby and we have good services and the Lord was able to bless us to travel back so we we want to thank the Lord praise the Lord thank you for your prayers as well I realized that we we finish God's choosing place of worship uh the tip we've been playing and uh for our tip session in the morning and uh we were supposed to go right into uh there is a wedding series just before uh marriage and divorce but I would push the marriage and divorce series to next year because there there are some uh things also I would like to take while we are dealing with that so uh uh the marriage and divorce series will appreciate push it to next year if the law is tired amen praise the Lord if the Lord tarot they give us the opportunity to see 2023 then we will go into that that series and a couple of announcement year for our end of the year service uh the last hit of the year comes on Saturday so uh uh instead of having an all night and expect you to come to church on Sunday I will now want to be cruel amen praise the Lord I know a couple of years back we did that one time we had a Easter meeting where we had a all night and then we went home and then came back you know oh my God praise the Lord uh after all I was thinking what was I doing you know what brother Clay farmer was the one that preached the meeting he never forget about that he never forget about that he never forget about that he's he's his brother that was my first time going on the marathon you know so we would not want to do that so what we would do is that we would have the Friday night we'll have a Friday night service where we can be able to sing worship testify do whatever we will like to do in appreciation to the Lord and then uh then you can be able to go home have a good rest and then we will be back Sunday morning praise the Lord so we were planning on having a good Friday night uh Friday all night service and uh for Christmas weekend also we also want to thank the Lord Brother uh timason had a successful surgery and uh and he's recovering praise the Lord spoke with him yesterday or day before yesterday and he sent his greetings to the church he want to thank you for your prayers and also for your support we we kind of for supporting him through the course of the surgery so uh [Music] uh he was hoping there because he's in the country where his wife he was hoping that he will be able to come as soon as he is able to regain his strength so we are thinking that if he's able to be yet around that time he might take the the Christmas weekend for us uh uh since uh it has fallen our law to to have uh uh a special meeting also that we will be speaking on and I'm still working out the the the the planes yeah but we are trusting that the Lord will will be able to have his way amen we'll trust in that the Lord we have his will so that's that's what our announcement for for the the end of the year meeting uh I want you to note that on your calendar the last Friday uh in the year will be our end of the year service and then we can be able to to maybe remind staff service a little bit later that we can be able to just spend spend the evening uh to the morning and I mean just as the Lord will be able to lead us amen praise the Lord so uh that's that's what our announcement is I hope I'm not forgetting anything but it's good to see you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord Amen on Wednesday night we we kind of introduce a thought uh uh gave me children Lisa died there was uh Richard cried to to Jacob and uh uh and I thought I had something already that I thought I was going to speak on but I I feel in there to for us to continue to look into that subject and just like I said the reason why uh uh I thought about it uh uh young Joshua sent me a video uh during the week about uh the the machine area that we spoke about I think he went on YouTube and found a testimony part of it uh something that was copied like his last sermon he preached on the Titanic and which of course it was very beautiful but uh uh and I also been kind of for looking into brother Brandon investment uh series listening to different all of his investment series just in a sense of uh coming to the end of the year then you know uh trying to look through the different things that we have done you know uh uh as a family as a church as an individual as as a minister as a Ministry all of that so that's that's the place where my heart is for us for us to be able to take uh an inventory of our commitment to the Lord and not making the New Year resolution but in the sense of challenging our heart and to be able to advance in the purpose of the Lord so as we will look into the subject what I want you to do is that uh I will I pray that that the Lord will be able to to bless us and as we look into the word uh to be able to look beyond the letters let's go right into the mind of God you know let's look and and try to see what what was God's taught because as we will as we will look into the subject just like I said on Wednesday uh you have to realize that the principal team of the Bible is Jesus amen he's the principal team of the Bible from Genesis to revelation he is the principal team of the Bible so all the characters in The Bible are in the second place there are many expressions in the Bible that that are there and if God don't help us to look beyond the letters we might just get stuck with what is written there praise the Lord as you recede in the scripture I'll bring that to you this morning now to get ahead of myself but you will see in the scripture that I was studying yesterday or studying on this and I was I was it just it just it just blew my mind I was I was saying wow there was something in God's mind Sarah was barren Rebecca was barren Richard Jacob's beloved wife was Baron but yet God would come to his people and says there will be no male or female Barren ammonia so what was God's thinking what did God allow that let's stand on our feet Genesis chapter 30. foreign so we we were kind of do a little a little bit of a Bible study unless you get me excited then I would start preaching amen if you if you if you if you control your emotion I will behave myself if you control your emotion I will behave myself praise the Lord Genesis Chapter 30 let's read together and when Rachel saw that she beared Jacob no children Rachel anything call sister that's another word that will shock you this morning I was looking through the the I was looking through many commentary yesterday and and and and and most of the commentators all do it on envy and jealousy envy and jealousy but uh uh yeah let's let's just read and then uh Richard Envy her sister and said unto Jacob give me children OS I die and Jacob's anger was counted against Rachel and he said am I engulfsted in another word am I God praise the Lord I wish he knew that he was falling I wish he knew that one time Adam won't say that praise the Lord it is the Fallen nature that make us all wish to respond like that who am I is a falling nature in us that will always make us even though we know that we are redeemed we are safe we are born again but there is just something in US that will always step us back to say Lord who am I and Jacob anger was scattered against Richard and he said am I in ghost State who have we held thee who have withheld from Thee the fruit of the womb praise the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father we write into your word this morning and we want the Lord you will you just come in a special way now come father Lord and open the pages of your word oh God and trusting that father Lord you will you will just come and help me Lord father the ability of stepping aside comes from you Lord you are the one that humbles a man you are the one father Lord God I can put a man aside and then and use the fit of the people and and and speak to them and minister to our hearts oh God we pray bless the service now in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you can have a seat praise the Lord give me children or as I die Wednesday night we read also there in Genesis chapter 15 where Abraham said also to God saying that I go childless you know I mean he he talked about about uh being the father of many nations he's talked about it he talked about it like brother Branham with dramatized he and Sarah Wayne and they make shopping for the baby and they painted the room and everything but then as as the child of their faith was going he realized that he was getting old and he having a dedicated young man in the house uh Ellie easer he's now telling going to propose to God and says well I have this boy he was born right in my house uh the day you told me to commit myself to the Covenant of circumcision he was also circumcised and all my sevens were circumcised I mean he's a lawyer boy I think I think I can trust him I can put him in a place of my son God said no it's not going to be so when I thought about you uh having the son is something that would come from you amen praise the Lord is something that will come from you if when God spoke about uh uh you know people in the laodicea age overcoming no one is going to overcome for you amen God's going to make sure that your body will overcome your weaknesses praise the Lord nobody going to do it for you amen he just he always just gave us an example he gave us a way she he raised up a man in a generation that he weighed before the people but that man do not do it for the people amen that way of sheet it does it only represent that other crops are coming up amen it does not mean that you're going to have uh a bad habit praise the Lord so we see there there has always been this uh this so let's let's take our time now you just relax put on your seat belt we're going to uh uh uh you know uh take this flight slowly praise the Lord and that uh the weather is good amen the weather is good uh you know uh but we might have a bumpy ride I don't know praise the Lord so just just uh just uh sit there I can uh when we get up you are free to take off your seat belt and say amen and jump up shout hallelujah praise the Lord amen the Lord is good amen the Lord is good the Lord is good praise the Lord praise the Lord Hallelujah amen let's go to Genesis chapter 1. Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was with our form now if you read uh uh in the I was reading this uh from another version um that is the uh something English version commentary English version something like that this is the way it says here that I have that in my no Genesis 1 2. uh the cve version it says here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was barren with no form of life praise the Lord it was on the a rolling ocean covered with Darkness but the spirit of God was moving over the waters praise the Lord amen a year is God now you have to realize there is there is there is a lot of parallel between creation and Redemption we have spoke on that before you can see the picture if you really look at creation yeah you can see the picture of redemption because brother Branham taught us the same way that God deals with the Earth that's the way he deals with his people future whom now uh in in in the message uh what what does it takes to make Christian Life brother Brandon would say that which of course is something that is familiar with us he will say now I want you to notice in the beginning when when God our Father looked over this blind Earth he says it was it wasn't nothing but one Great Big Board of Water and God sent the Holy Spirit to the Earth the logos that went out of God and they begin to brood over the earth now the word brood means to make love praise the Lord or just like like the dwarf took hold and the Holy Spirit covered the Earth as a mental picture we are going to make it like the wind with a great Wing around the earth and Broad making love calling come come the father has ordained you come what was he calling to the seeds that were in the Earth praise the Lord the father has ordained you rise up rise to your potential amen rise to your ability the father have ordained you come I'm coming to perform what the father word has said and verbraham says there that's the power of transformation amen the power of transformation is that God just bring the seed that is in you he brings the potential that is in you it's now being is now being transformed from Peak to lamb no it's bringing out the lament nature in you being able to make us to produce world so we can be shared amen so those wool can be given out that's what it is so the Holy Spirit was brawling over the Earth making love because the Earth was buried but yet there were seeds in the Earth yeah that's a paradox but we're going to go that street as we as we just want to take our time and and study this together praise the lord we want to take our time and study this together so we we are looking at this at this uh a scene in Genesis Chapter 30 where uh uh we know the story there that Jacob uh uh uh Rachel was his first love amen Rachel was his first love so the custom of the land hired him to take Leah but he loved Rachel man and we we know all the story we see everything that is played out there and uh and and and the scripture says uh uh uh richer and they her sister let's look at that a little bit yeah I went dead into the strong into the the the the the strong uh concordance to be able to bring out that word envy uh the Primitive roof word it goes back to the word of zelius to be zealous xelius okay now a house in about sense it has the word jealousy and being envious but in the the death sense The Roots Saints now this this this kind of blew my mind last night I will tell you if if you do if you do blow your mind to then I think you and myself we are at the same place because I'm I'm looking at this and uh uh to realize the depth of thought that is behind this that God is playing out something here and then on the surface in the blending of our human nature it looks like we are in control it looks like we are making decisions it looks like we are doing you know what we think is right to do but there is a very strong thought that is behind Our Lives praise the Lord amen so and when you look at the the the the root sense of this word meaning to be zealous you can see it now let's let's take a scripture that uh that I attached to this that is in Numbers chapter 25 11 the Bible said Finney has the son of Ella is that the son of Aaron the priests have turned my wrath away from the children of Israel why he was Alias for my sake among them that icons that are that I consume not the children of Israel in my jealousy so God is saying here in my jealousy I will have consumed them I will have got rid of them but there was a man that was zealia so so uh fenny has zealousness was expressing God's jealousy so when God when Paul says I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy it means that I have a Zeal over you I'm zealous for you to come to be a Chase virgin unto Christ and I'll take it in a common sense it will help you yeah praise the Lord amen I walk in this morning I saw brother Dan vehicle I told him I said brother damn I'm jealous foreign it's not evil right right the jealousy that you don't express the one that you don't say that you that you your eyes is saying everything you're about your mouth can talk have everybody have anybody told you I'm I'm aware of you everybody say that to you praise the Lord and most of the time when people say that to you it's more like a compliment a sense of appreciation I want to be like you [Applause] is the one that we don't say that's the one that is dangerous when we don't have the ability to say it and it's just eating us in our mind that's right praise the Lord so let's go back to the scripture here because I want us to see the richness of the scripture the richness of the scripture the Bible says and Rachel saw that she did Jacob no children she Envy her sister and said unto Jacob give me children lest I die I mean for her to come and hold that guy by the front of his water that's the pains for gown or whatever he was wearing I don't believe that she just said it lightly and I believe that she was very roughed on him and say giving children she she was caught up under something that that was beyond I believe she know you know Jacob is not God praise the Lord I believe she knows that she don't need Jacob to preach another message to her but she was on a an inspiration praise the Lord she was honor and inspiration is the same inspiration that you get honor when you say God I need the Holy Ghost praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is a promise unto you amen are you begging God for the holy God no you are not begging it's an inspiration that comes on you Lord I want to be more like you God I want the Holy Ghost I want a life change praise the Lord let's let's drop down yeah and then uh let's drop down to uh verse 8. I want to take my time so we can appreciate the scripture amen now you will realize after that the Bible says and then then Rachel she took her her mad seven and uh uh uh be hot and she gave she gave her own to her husband and and Dan was born and and uh and then uh again in verse 7 uh and then she had another son uh in in verse 7 and we have Rachel's made conceive again and bear Jacob a second son now listen to this now verse 8 and Rachel said with great Roslyn have I Razzle with my sister praise the Lord and I have prevailed for which course she named the boy Nathalie now so you see yeah the scripture says she Envy her sister amen but yeah again now she's she's having a child that she's adopting from her man she's also expressing something that I have wrestled with my sister praise the Lord now let's let's uh let's take uh uh the Amplified version of that let's take the amplifier version of that I should have there right right on the the first verse there hmm the scripture says so Rachel said with mighty razzling now the Amplified have it in prayer to God amen with Mighty razzling in prayer to God I have struggled with my sister and I prevail so so the feeling that she was having the expression that she was having it was not in an evil sense sure when she was razzling with her sister is is that uh she she seen her sister having child she's needing child but her heart was towards God oh God when my time when will they be mine praise the Lord now that was the same thing that happened to Hannah amen she rise up with God are we together so you see there is there is a there's a thought that God is expressing you there is something that he's bringing out of his mind and he's playing it in the life in the character of these people praise the Lord amen we have seen it as the attitude I mean you could just read the scripture right there and says well she's supposed to be happy for her sister why was she jealous but she was more than just jealous [Music] amen she was more than just jealous because there is something that you have to understand about the about the Hebrew women the heart and intense desire and attains anxiousness for children because of the promise of the promise see because of that promise she they always had an intense desire to be able to bring forth are we together so we're traveling here we're traveling I'm trying to do my best now to not to get out of track here but so we see here that richer expression give me children Lisa dying praise the Lord Jeremiah over in Jeremiah chapter 15 uh chapter 31. he would take that expression that's where the saying will come from richer weeping for her children at the time Jesus will be born in Matthew chapter 2. this the slaughter of the children but Hera will will that prophecy will rise back on the scene and says according to what Jeremiah said praise the Lord amen so it gave us an idea that Rachel cry gave me children it was it was from a deep expression not just only uh Hassan Joseph and Benjamin that she was Desiring for but it was coming from a place it's almost like um David in the temple saying my God my God why have that forsake Him in and he never had no idea that this would be the very same word that Jesus will say on the cross the Lord says Those Old Testament character many times they were placed in situation yeah job there that are being an Earnest man a man that fear God he had such a testimony such a repetition among his people with no idea God is going to set his life up for the for for for for uh and you know and an eternal example of the choices that God sometimes made for his people living happily saving his people serving his children doing everything that he knows right and God is bringing the enemy to a challenge have you seen my seventh job is there any man like him and yet God never told job anything praise the Lord Hallelujah I'm sure God never told you anything also amen I never told you anything never told you you'd be here this morning God told you I will be preaching amen so we have to realize we have to realize and and that is the that is the evil of religion because it stopped us on the Black and White Plains we have to know that this word comes from the mind of God it has a very deep and intense thought that's the reason why you cannot take a verse and make a Doctrine out of it because as the heaven is higher than the earth so are his thoughts higher than our thoughts yeah I like to look in the mind of God my goodness praise the Lord when you look in in the word and the word is breaking out like this you say oh my oh my what what a God we have what a God we have praise the Lord oh God called Abraham and promise him I'll make you the father of nation and yet he withhold his wife from having children how is she going to be praise the Lord how how is she going to be the father of nation or are he going to be the father of nation and she's going to be the mother of nation how how was this going to happen but you see the thing about it there is that God was more interested in the fake children in the children that would come by faith the children that faith will give birth talk he was more interested in the fake children than Abraham just having bunch of children and they have no connection with God that's the reason why God is more interested in the things that you do by faith that you do by faith and by the word and just anything you do in your life he was interested in the faith children the children that faith will produce praise the Lord the children that holding on to God because those things that you trusted God for they never leave you praise the Lord they never leave you those things you experience with God they never leave you you might go to school and you know and learn and get out of the degree you don't remember everything the teacher told you you get this start before you get the job you want training why you don't go and bring all your textbooks drag it to school to work say what is that these are all my texts boy I'm going to use this book and get this job done praise the Lord amen you might spend the whole next three months passing pages and that's how they will fire you praise the Lord so we see here in Genesis chapter 11 verse tell it Sarah was barring Genesis chapter 25 verse 20 to 22 Rebecca was buried that's how the scripture says the scripture says it she was Barren 0 was Barren Rebecca was buried Genesis 29 for steady one richer was barring what is this these are all the Patriots these are all the wife of the Patriots praise the Lord amen now you see sometimes we try to apply our mind which of course brother Branham called that the canary brain you know people always say Sir Abraham told Allah Sarah was Barren before Abraham told a lie praise the Lord oh Isaac to Eli that Rebecca was already bowing before Isaac took Isaac took a lie before uh uh uh you know uh she was already in that state he says well Jacob was uh mischievous and all of those things is the representation of Saint John chapter 9. when the eyes Jesus uh you know about by whose sin is this man born blind we are not able to go back and see what was in God's mind what did God allow what he allowed we always try to touch some kind of a strain to sin we always try to to when when we fish out in our life we're always looking to grasp him why is this happening to me what have I done maybe not me that name on something maybe my mama was fishing out for sin [Laughter] glory be to God Amen praise the Lord amen but you see something will happen something will change here Amen in Genesis chapter 41 reading from verse 49 to 42 you can read there the Bible says here and unto Joseph was born two sons before the year of farming when it came to Joseph the story changed his wife was not buried well change it Moses the picture changed both of them married a gentle bride praise the Lord amen so you see that God had a deep expression in his mind how barrenness who have come by the Lord that's the reason why the Apostle Paul said over and over nor flesh will be justified by the Lord that's the reason why God and I gave his people law from the beginning it was Grace from the beginning Grace doing the Lord and Grace after the Lord these are the Patriots these are the Patriots father the father of Faith the people that God was using for foundation storm but each of their wife came out Baron but when it came to Joseph there was a type of Christ the Lord are we together Paul expressed that over and over right in Galatians chapter 4 he speaks of that how uh uh we are children of of Jerusalem he used he used Hagar and Sarah as a type of the of the old Covenant he says but we are born of Jerusalem we are free we're in there in Romans chapter 3 20 he talks about about the Lord no flesh shall be justified he also speak of that in Galatians Chapter 2 by the Lord no flesh will be justified so God had a very deep thought in his mind what Grace was going to do for us let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 7. praise the Lord don't worry I have not started preaching yet I have not started preaching yet I'm just trying to find a place to stand determine chapter seven let's read verse 12. wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hear King to these judgments and keep them and do them that the Lord thy God shall keep thee from no he shall he shall he the Lord thy God shall I keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he swear unto thy father and he will love thee and will bless thee and will multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of the woman and and the fruit of the land that come that wind and oil any CR and the increase of the Kings and and the and the flux all the ships in the land which his word unto thy father Thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female bearing among you or among your counters I love that Judges chapter 13 verse 3 the Bible said Manoa and his wife was barren hmm praise the Lord my Noah and his wife was Byron that is just after they have come over to the land now this is where God is giving them a promise he's giving them a promise here and yeah we've seen we're seeing this pattern and and and and and and if you can look at it you you just look I think about it now the scripture I believe there were many other people uh uh in in Bible days that was that were that were in that condition but God the scripture always mentioned these people that had a promise attached to them praise the Lord just like how God had a purpose for the Earth not for Mars not for Jupiter now for any Planet but he had a purpose for the Earth and to be able to bring out this purple of life in the Earth the Earth has to First be in a Barren State that's the same way you will see that all of these people Sarah she had a promise to bring forth the promised son Isaac there will be a type of Christ Rebecca she had a promise two Nation will be in your womb the kind of seed and the spiritual seed uh uh uh uh richer also had a promise she will give birth to her last son that will be a son of of of of Sorrow to the son of the right hand that's why Benjamin was he was born the son of sorrow but he became the son of the father's right hand so to all these people the heart a promise they had some kind of a spiritual attachment to them but yet they had to go through a period of dryness are we together you have to go through a time of farming you know I was reading last night and it it kind of blessed my mind because you will see that the Bible the Bible place it in the word it says and unto Jacob we're born two sons before the years of farming so just before baroness came on the saying God bless Jacob or Joseph breaking the curse of barrenness because it's Theory means God's word it's still remain God's promise to his people that there will be no barring that word Still Remains the truth you believe it yeah it Still Remains truth Hallelujah because the way that God looked at productiveness is very far from the way our kind of mind thinks about productiveness praise the Lord amen the way God taught about replenish the Earth is more than what our mind thinks foreign Hallelujah amen oh that's the reason why the the Bible who says us sing and rejoice all barren for many other children of the adulterous woman we will come to that it's part of my notes because what the father what is in God's mind concerning reproduction concerning replenishing the Earth it's far away from what the human thinks there is nothing that please the father nothing the purpose of creation the purpose of creation Remains the Same as the purpose of redemption praise the Lord are we together ah yeah yeah let me jump ahead of myself a little bit here Jesus it's in John chapter 15. whether he says I am the vine you are the branches he revealed what is the purpose of the father what is the deep thought of the father what the father in joy if anybody bring that fruit he's cut off he's caught up in his good for burning the father from the verse So Divine can be able to be productive so what the father looks for in the vine what he looks for in the earth what he looks for in his people is to be able to be productive praise the Lord is to be able to reproduce that's the reason why Philip could say to that to that Jailer believe in the Lord Jesus you and your household will be safe but I'm saying what is that he says the Sin the same faith that brought that men to Salvation amen will be reproduced and I was worried that the church in Philippi was born you read the book of Philippians that word that church was born it's God's way of reproduction he didn't save us for us to be to to think that we are special people then the rest of the people in the world no the purpose of Salvation is for us to be productive your faith in your heart must be able to reproduce oh you might not be able to go to Uganda I'll go over the seas right in your house because the commission says begin at Jerusalem Jerusalem is your house amen Jerusalem is your house our faith must be able to impart our relationship it must be able to impart when people start using faith to destroy their relationship and to think that they are pleasing God you are completely out of the word of God when you start using faith to cut away from from family call away from from uh from from relative and and you think you are in a word of God if your faith we're carrying you towards on a stream that you cannot even greet people and and you just look at them up and down something is wrong in your soul you better get to the altar quickly that's what I will advise you you want to go a missionary trip praise the Lord you want to go on missionary tribe you want to be in fact effective impress your home amen impress your clothes surrounding what Grace is doing in our life must be able to affect the people around us they might not believe praise the Lord they might not believe right away but they will come to that place of being convinced that I know my child is right oh I know my parents is right let's think of how faith has destroyed homes and destroyed families and we are getting ready for the rapture that's the reason why the Rapture is not an individual trait foreign travel on the Rapture is going to be a family trip now we wish that I alive amen wish we that are alive we're in any word until they come up first and join us it's a family trip praise the Lord so when you park in your bag make sure the other people's bags are packed right what is in the father's mind what is he thinking about yeah we see through the scripture Manoa and his wife is Byron but yet through them the deliverer the man that is going to destroy the Philistines is going to come through them the one that will raise up the gate the man whose name when his mission praise the Lord even the animals that don't hear the names of the Philistines starts to run because everybody is running so the Animals still start running they don't know what the people running for you just mentioned something is coming what a terror what a name that God raised up the very purpose that he was born but he came from a parent they were there were barren are we together the man I would change the course of history he would change the course of history when there was no Opie Vision in Israel no vision but God will raise up a little boy just from a little age about three two years old he would start hearing the voice of God praise the Lord but that child was born from a woman Hannah that was buried and how many night and day that she cried to God or if you can just if I can just Own It experience childbirth I will give that child to you praise the Lord amen God was using Hannah to show how the land of Israel was buried because there was no Prophet on the land God was using her life if Eli was just sensible to read beyond the letters he would know that she was not drunk she was a desperate woman she was a woman that was zealous for the Lord and God used the the expression from her sword that's the reason why we cry to God and we pray to God but yet he looked at our motives and objectives praise the Lord you can stay all night of crying and do everything you want to do if you're motive and objective is Savage come on now your tears will flowing dry on your face glory be to God he has a woman here she says I'm okay with my people we call her a successful businesswoman she's doing well her husband doing well and they are living happy you know once in a child they have got over there it was not a problem in their home and yet a prophet came by praise the Lord and she saw there was something about this man and she had a place in her home and set a room there and invited him in and give him food and and he got a good bath and had a good rest baby never slept in a decent home like that woman home was because she was a woman that was doing well she said I mean you want to talk about meeting the king no I know how to get to him praise the Lord my husband he said he's he's I mean he he has contact so I gave you a favor over the king the the the the prophet said she said no that's not what I want okay here's I said but I realized I've not seen a baby picture on the wall I looked through their home I've not seen a baby picture praise the Lord and he had never said anything about my child has gone to school or my son is in college they never say anything like that like that praise the Lord God will reward her not wave money now we have contact but God will reward hug with the fruit of life foreign amen God will reward her because in that woman was a substance she had a substance faith in her substance faith that she had in her she might have not been a religious woman amen they're going about all in in the in you know in the neighborhood and and be crying to us Sarah I'm going to church Lucy are you coming I'm going to church she might not being a religious woman that was blowing trumpet all over the place but in her was a substance faith for the fact that she could identify that this was the man of God and something in our heart could make a provision could make a risk to make a comfort for him in All was a substance fact and God was going to bring it out how will God bring it I give her the child and that child will die and yes you will make no noise about it but she would tell her Seventh Son of the house let's go and meet the man of God because in her was the substance fact the Lord Hallelujah she knew how to get a hold of God she knew how to attract God to her home praise the Lord oh Hallelujah right before the coming of Our Lord right in the same season there will be a priest a righteous man the Bible call him a righteous man the Bible says Zacharias was a righteous man right in that season the very same season where our Lord God will be made Flesh on Earth there was a righteous man keeping to the Lord doing everything that was right well Elizabeth was barring oh single Barren and rejoice glory be to God Hallelujah because God's thoughts are very deep praise the Lord shakurai has been a young man he loved the Lord he started serving God he rose up in the preschool seven in a temple burning incense and all of that the only purpose why God will keep his wife that way because there was there needed to be somebody to introduce the Messiah praise the Lord God wanted a man a child that will introduce the Messiah Elizabeth and uh Zechariah to talk about it well honey don't worry don't worry I mean it's it's God and I see our Father Abraham you know he he went many years we found we found out you know but I mean these days are more modern than those days praise the Lord amen they did everything that they knew how to do glory be to God but can you can you imagine what if God will have whisper to it Zacharias Zacharias you and I have time because I call into Malacca chapter 3. that messenger of the Covenant that will be coming as I have faulted a voice in the wilderness to be your son praise the Lord amen what is going to change his attitude he will get in the temple blowing incense you people coming here come in here you don't worry don't worry about me not having child God know what he's doing you just go and read as I have 40 who tells you praise the Lord my God in this great mind in his deep mind I just love God praise the Lord you know he says Jesus is just like running in the boson of your father sitting on his lap and looking right into his eyes he said what are you thinking oh my goodness praise the Lord praise the Lord when people think that oh yeah this is the message of the hour we must be having a move of God you know we might just walk on the street messing linga must be restored and and we make all of these fantasy when we don't even have the character behind it we are just looking for public city we are looking for public city so we can get down and condemn all the denominations when we are doing the very same thing that they are doing all that people will say well nothing is happening in the message we just make all of these things all of these things and all of these things it's just deadness and dryness everywhere don't worry don't worry praise the Lord Hallelujah yeah oh my God you love the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord Hallelujah no I'm just having a good time with Jesus I'm just having a good time you know that that's what Revelation does it just sends you into the deep thoughts of God it take you behind the letters they take you to the heart of the father it makes you to appreciate what God has done for you and the grace that have kept you and thinking of that you can say he's not finished with me he's not finished with me and I know there is something he's keeping me to do I know there's a Divine woman that is coming around the corner maybe there is somebody watching my life from a distance it's a Divine moment is coming Zacharias was faithful he was faithful he never threw in the tower because he never had a child he was faithful until the day that God spoke to him he lost speech because God blew his mind praise the Lord when God met him he lost speech praise the Lord I hope that God will meet us in this building now you will lose peace and start speaking in tongues that's what I'm looking for that your tongue will just start knocking to the roof of your mouth you don't even know what you are saying but the spirit of God is upon your life there are people speaking speaking tongues when they lose speech when they don't know what to say then you speak in tongues have you ever been in prayer and you don't know what to say and you are just there just just bubbling worse that don't even make sense covered oh my Hallelujah you love the Lord I mean I'm just having a good time this morning praise the Lord I think maybe you should have got another preacher here amen the one I can do that will make you excited and in order there you see there is there is something there is this thing in a scripture uh Exodus chapter 20. in line there uh in in in the combinance and uh is is uh uh thou shall not take the name of the Lord the Lord thy God in vain and how many times we have been taught in Sunday school you know is is the misusing of God's name in a way that says you know we must not curse using God's name we must not just use God's name any how but it's more than that it's more than that what is in God's mind concerning there your ambassadorship in God's mind what he's thinking about is that his people will be an ambassador it is not only in what they would say but their life their entire life that's the reason why we don't baptize in titles we take you down that water and baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when you Rise Up from the water you come up taking God's name praise the Lord and we expect you to take God's name in everything that you do that's why Paul said everything we do in words or base let's do it in the name of the Lord if you can't do it in the name of the Lord then don't do it because when you come out of that water you have become an ambassador an ambassadorship Paul will say the same thing second Timothy 2 19 let everyone that name the name of Christ he passed from iniquity be apart from iniquity and everyone that name the name of Christ will suffer persecution why because there's a power behind you are you seeing the father's thought what is in his mind what is in God's mind when he take us through a period of of of barrenness in our faith it almost looks like we we we we don't we don't have nothing to comfort praise the Lord oh being serving God all of these years you see that that uh the people the generation of our age I mean our age just loudly should Aid because of a loudish or Spirit no wonder there had never been a time of Prosperity Gospel preaching in this age because that's allowed this your spirit well where we reduce the blessings of God to material things perishable things perishable things and those are the things that we look for to be able to count God's blessing when men of all were looking for Souls that they brought to God how their lives Smith wigglewolf one time he told his daughter and his son-in-law his son married a missionary his daughter married a missionary sorry he told his uh his uh his daughter his son-in-law he called him he says I know you people are doing a good job trying to win the whole world he says but let me tell you don't win the whole world and let your children don't let my grandchildren go to hell right right praise the Lord he says we are winning the whole world don't let don't allow my grandchildren to go to hell why was he trying to tell them that's the commission it must begin at Jerusalem they must begin at Jerusalem it must affect our homes the home has evolved it must it must improve our parents and children relationship praise the Lord it must improve it that's the reason why they call him a one Berber because he was friends of sinners so don't say my children are not safe so I don't have relationship with them praise the Lord then you need to be safe also don't say my parents don't believe the message so damn I said we are not on good terms you need to be born again that's what I can tell you you need to be born again we pick up the Bible we listen to text and we then we start to become sassy praise the Lord when they are still paying the bills for us we are living under their Roof then we have all the courts on our arm to challenge the authority people that's not the message of the hour that's now the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ they must improve our relationship it must affect our relationship that's what he came to do this promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call praise the Lord so if your parents are not safe and you have great relationship and they respect what you believe is a blessing yes it's a Revival if your children are not saved and you have great relationship with them it's our blessing you are not a savior he is the savior but you are one that has been saved and he has saved you so he can go through you and show them his love praise the Lord oh yeah you know what brother Branham says when he talks about Peter right there when now I converted strengthen your bread wings better man says he was prophesying to Peter about his death prophesying repeated about when he comes to his old age when he comes to his old age the ones that you leave will lead you amen that's what it is I know many other times of you know what parents struggle with this parents are always parents they're always Paris you know always in the driving seat praise the Lord but it's a great it's a great tremendous Victory when you are realized that God has given you the grace to do all that you were supposed to do as a parent and you can sit down there and see the beauty of Jesus in your children and now trust their decision that's right oh my God this is a beauty that's what Grace have done for us to know that you have raised them right you have taught them right come into a place of of of a trusted relationship praise the Lord not traveling with a haunting thought I wonder what they are doing can't trust that boy praise the Lord amen many of the time the problem is with us we have not we have now work on a relationship to let go to let go and sit back that's why you raised them off for that's why you should teach them right that's why you invest invest in winning their soul and bringing them to Christ and exposing them to what is right as there will come a time where the role will reverse you will need to sit back and enjoy the ride that's why almighty God was doing in Eden he sat back and enjoyed the ride when Adam went out and named things he come back he said that's what I needed my boy he sat back and he enjoyed the ride because he had brought his son up that he can trust that's what this man message want to produce that's God's purpose that's God's desire for his children not calling one another brothers and sisters this is this is your mission for you right this is your mission field praise the Lord well I don't even know her name shame you come to the community table here then you take communion with a sister you don't even know her name huh that's a shame you're not reaching out you're not reaching out man will know that ye are my disciples if you love one another there will be such a love among you now brother Branham says when they come in and they want to plan all they are bring all their gossip and all their their toxic uh environment brother Brandon says they will eat or go away because they know that they cannot affect the bound of law that is among the people there will be no wrong to talk about a sister or talk about a brother because we will be sending back to back I learned many years ago never to poor people affection in love for you above the world oh I learned that I landed at the highway and learned that many years ago praise the Lord amen I believe that the more truth I stay to this word praise the Lord the Lord the father will love me and his people will appreciate me maybe you might think that certain people have privilege you know it's just because they have come too close amen maybe they have come too close and we can laugh together maybe you always see me like a serious person but I'm telling you I can laugh I can crack laughing amen I can crack laughing uh but receiving myself what's over there in South Africa and uh all I had a good time I had a good time he had a hotel room key in his pocket he house looking for it all over the place looking for it all over the place they also realized he had in his back pocket I had a good time laughing and sometimes when I'm when I laugh I feel sorry for myself but what are we talking about what are we talking about church amen we all know the burden of this prophecy that was hanging over Rachel never knew she just thought that she wanted a childlike every other women wanted child or just like her sister but there was a prophecy that was hanging over her she was expressing something right from the heart of the father he gave me children praise the Lord and that's the place where the church that's the place where the uh uh uh uh a people for the rapture because you know you you you we must realize this that salvation is a free gift but when we get on the other side and God starts to Crown his people we will be crowned for the burden that we have bed and the things that were expressed through our lives with you not having no idea Matthew chapter 25 he says many shall come to unto me that there and say Lord he will say it's our sake and you visited me right they said when were you sick so they had no idea it's something that was just expressing through their life something where the grace of God and the love of God has affected them so much that they were living a life of expression they never had no idea praise the Lord I realized that we can't finish this today I'm not going to try to but I'll just read some few things here but when Jesus died God provided an approach to Fellowship but when Jesus died on the day of our two men he ran the bill into I read this and we close not only the high priest but whosoever will may come anytime into the shekhana glory of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into a real Fellowship into a place in the presence of God where the power of God cleans us from all unrighteousness we become new creatures in Christ praise the Lord the Holy Ghost fall Upon Us in all of our backwardness and and and sheeness we become into a relationship with God is it the church the bride well shooting the bride be bringing for children crying Abba Father shouldn't we be bringing for children Our Lives affecting the ones around us bringing for children crying Abba Father what's the matter no wonder we can produce ourselves anymore praise the Lord because we have gone on the deep end that's what Jesus said he told those Pharisees you are putting too much burden on the people things that you can do that's why you are requiring them to do you see that's the reason why we can never bring for children we can never bring for Faith children never bring for spoken word children by legalism you will not do it legalism can only kill praise the Lord because you will bound the people and you will force them and force them and force them until they will be so burnt out there is nothing about love and grace in your heart to even want to come to church praise the Lord amen we must make it so easy for people to want to come to church praise the Lord it's a form it's a form of of of of witnessing it's a mission field I mean all these little ones we bring them to church Wednesday night a Sunday morning we bring them out I mean I mean they come from school they got to go to school the next morning and I mean it's such a sacrifice but what are you doing you are trusting that the grace of God will be able to get a hold of them you are trusting that God in a supernatural way will be able to get a hold of them when I see all of these young people working out they are scheduled around working and school in order to be in church it's a sacrifice it's a sacrifice we we all can put our responsibility on the line and get busy and how thou has killed the churches kill the churches now even on a Wednesday night it's it's it's difficult for you to have people to have a preacher come around because you you are not sure who all will be in church praise the Lord this last meeting we have with brother Brooks it blessed him so much he don't like traveling in the winter he don't like the winter I don't know how he find himself in Iowa but he told me there was a leading of the Lord but he don't like the winter praise the Lord so it was a whole lot of sacrifice for him to come come here amen and then he said to me when he came we were in the office he said tonight I'm going to see the true believers he said because it's so cold out there brother if people really show up if people don't show up I would I would understand it because it's cold out praise the Lord but you don't know what it means to a preacher you don't know what it means praise the Lord there was nothing that it blesses the preacher when the people are receiving the word it blesses the preacher when the people come showing up praise the Lord he told me he said brother I was really blessed to see the people showing up on our call uh uh Saturday night all of those things they have just killed and we're looking for the supernatural Revival were we
