[33:08] just bow our heads. Uh we have some few
[33:10] prayer leads we want to share with you.
[33:12] But we want first want to bring a praise
[33:14] report. Uh we thank the Lord. Uh I think
[33:17] it was on um Monday. Brother Wesley
[33:20] called that sister Carol was not doing
[33:23] well. They had to rush her to the
[33:24] hospital and she was animated
[33:28] dead uh uh with her blood pressure uh
[33:32] skyrocketing and she was losing her
[33:35] speech and some different things going
[33:37] on. But we want to thank the Lord she's
[33:39] back home. Amen. She's back home. We
[33:41] want to thank the Lord for that. We want
[33:43] to thank the Lord for intervening. So
[33:46] when he called me, I was just uh or when
[33:49] I spoke to him, I was just in in a place
[33:52] of speaking to brother forest farmer
[33:55] because I'm I'm hoping that he will be
[33:57] here with us the first first week in uh
[34:00] November. That's November 1st and 2nd.
[34:02] He should be speaking for us that
[34:04] weekend. And it's been a while that we
[34:06] have not har forest. Amen. So uh we
[34:09] were, you know, about to talk to him. So
[34:12] then I call him and then I was just
[34:15] sharing with him. He says, he says,
[34:17] "Brother War is surprising because I was
[34:19] listening to brother Don Reagan service
[34:21] on Saturday and there were a couple of
[34:24] prayer requests for some sisters that
[34:25] have blood pressure. Sunday morning I go
[34:28] to church and they had requestes of some
[34:31] sisters that have blood pressure. So he
[34:32] says the devil might be bringing blood
[34:34] pressures attack on our sisters." Amen.
[34:38] So uh we just we just took that to the
[34:41] Lord in prayer and we want to thank God
[34:43] that he came through for sister Carol.
[34:45] Amen. Let's take this other prayer need.
[34:48] I got it uh
[34:50] serious prayer request here. This
[34:53] individual should be in the hospital and
[34:55] uh I'm still looking for update on the
[34:58] condition
[35:00] uh for uh
[35:03] uh Daniel Gray sister Kelly. She was in
[35:07] a bad accident accident accident crash a
[35:10] t-bone. They had to cut her out of the
[35:13] car. Uh she was carried straight to the
[35:16] hospital trauma unit and uh is still
[35:20] there. Multiple bones compound uh break
[35:25] and the right ankle right broken broken
[35:29] arm. She's uh in a conculion
[35:32] and neck brace. Uh they ask uh
[35:39] They are asking which mean those sending
[35:41] the prayer request they asking for
[35:43] physical healing but also for spiritual
[35:45] healing. Amen. So I thought that I
[35:49] needed to remember this uh as we as we
[35:54] bring this uh to the Lord in prayer.
[35:57] Amen. Let's just also bow our heads
[35:59] together tonight and uh give thanks.

[36:08] opportunity of being in the house of the
[36:10] Lord and thank God for our dear sister
[36:13] Cara. And we just appreciate the Lord
[36:16] for all his goodness, all his love and

[39:50] I am rich
[39:53] because of all the Lord has done
[40:00] for us.
[40:03] He cares.
[40:07] while we have this opportunity to pray
[40:09] tonight.
[40:11] Paul told the believers one time that uh
[40:13] we we must pray for the peace of the
[40:16] city where we live. And tonight I just
[40:20] want us to just take this moment and uh
[40:23] not only our city, the country. And we
[40:26] can just ask God to be gracious, to be
[40:29] merciful. and uh uh that Lord that the
[40:33] Lord will just uh we need we need that
[40:37] peace. We need his peace to be able to
[40:40] go about take care of our family, go to
[40:42] work, go to school and all of that. And
[40:44] and we just see what
[40:48] what a chaos with with everything that
[40:50] is going on, all the shooting and
[40:53] everything just around the country. And
[40:56] we just want to just pray that God would
[40:58] just be merciful.
[41:01] We have to remember that was Abraham's
[41:04] prayer when he was interceding.
[41:07] He said, "Lord, if there be one
[41:08] righteous,
[41:10] and I believe that because of the
[41:14] righteous that is in the land, because
[41:16] of the bride of Jesus Christ, because of
[41:18] God's people
[41:20] that want to stand for his name, that
[41:22] want to live right and do right, I
[41:25] believe that God can save the city. I
[41:28] believe that God can just give us a time
[41:31] once again that we can be that we can be
[41:33] able to just shine his light
[41:38] So whatever the Lord place on your heart
[41:40] tonight,
[41:42] let's just take this time and just pray
[41:45] that God will be merciful. He will help
[41:47] his children. It's not time to be caught
[41:50] up in politics. It's not time to be
[41:52] caught up in in everything that is
[41:54] happening out there.
[41:57] If ever the time is a time to draw
[41:59] closer to the Lord.
[42:02] How we need for God to just give us a
[42:05] life of consecration, a life of prayer,
[42:08] a closer walk with God.
[42:11] We need it.

[47:04] Let's take our Bibles tonight.
[47:08] On Sunday, we were speaking on uh the
[47:11] rathers and the beast. Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; The rathers and the beast. So, uh, we
[47:18] want to continue a little bit in that
[47:20] line tonight and, uh, if it will please
[47:22] the Lord to be able to remind us of what
[47:26] we were speaking about and, uh, and and
[47:29] just, uh, maybe encourage us tonight.
[47:32] Amen. Revelation chapter 5, let's read
[47:34] from verse one. And I saw in the hand of
[47:37] him that sat on the throne, a book
[47:40] written within, and on the backside
[47:43] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[47:46] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[47:48] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[47:51] to lose their seals thereof. And no man
[47:54] in heaven known in earth neither under
[47:57] the earth was able to open the book
[48:00] neither to look there on. And I wept
[48:03] much because no man was found worthy to
[48:06] open and to read the book neither to
[48:10] look there on. And one of the the others
[48:15] said unto me, "Weep not, behold, the
[48:18] lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[48:21] David, hath prevailed to open the book
[48:26] and to loose the seven seals thereof."
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we
[48:33] want to thank you, Lord God, for your
[48:35] prevailing angel. Thank you for your
[48:38] prevailing presence, oh God. Father,
[48:41] Almighty Lord, I pray tonight that Lord
[48:43] God, you will just uh come now, Father,
[48:46] Lord, put us aside, come out of the
[48:48] pages of your word. Let something be
[48:50] said that would draw us closer to you.
[48:52] We love you because you first love us.
[48:55] What a mighty God. What a blessed Lord
[48:58] we serve. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[49:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord bless
[49:04] you. You may have your seat.
[49:07] Amen. Amen.
[49:11] And uh uh
[49:14] if you want to find out if I had a good
[49:16] day today, yes I did. Amen. There were a
[49:19] few things that uh uh you know uh that
[49:23] that really brightened my day and one of
[49:25] them and uh uh was uh I was just about
[49:29] leaving here and uh to head home uh uh
[49:34] and just uh get myself ready for service
[49:37] tonight. And then uh um Sister Bea came
[49:44] uh Sister Bea, she's uh uh helping
[49:49] a Muslim family
[49:51] and uh uh and I've I've always wanted to
[49:54] talk to the lady and because uh uh I've
[49:58] just seen social social kindness, you
[50:01] know, social kindness and uh uh I mean
[50:05] being very kind, very nice to our
[50:07] sister. So I I've always wanted to so
[50:10] I've missed her a couple of times. She's
[50:13] either driving out when I'm coming in
[50:15] and uh the other time I was very close.
[50:18] So I thought she wait for me but she was
[50:20] as soon I got out of my car she just
[50:22] drove and and left. So I'm saying okay
[50:25] uh maybe the Lord will give us enough
[50:28] time and which of course he did today.
[50:30] And but she told me she was she was she
[50:33] was running for an appointment. She saw
[50:34] me coming but she was running for an
[50:37] appointment. She never wanted to get
[50:38] laid, so that's why she just drove away.
[50:40] I thought she was in front of me anyway.
[50:43] Praise the Lord. No, I just uh I just uh
[50:47] uh didn't know what was what actually
[50:48] was. So, so I just I just stopped by and
[50:51] I talked with her a little bit and I
[50:53] just told her, "Thank you. Thank you for
[50:54] being nice, you know, to uh to our our
[50:57] sister, you know, uh she speaks highly
[51:00] of you and and I see the, you know, the
[51:02] sacrifice because she live there in
[51:04] Savage, you know, she brings sister
[51:06] Peter there. Make sure she gets here
[51:09] early for church or you know enough time
[51:12] for her to come and and uh uh you know
[51:15] and and being a Muslim family uh you
[51:20] know and just to see the way that they
[51:23] respect her faith, they respect her
[51:25] prayer time and and all of that. So all
[51:27] of those things were were things that uh
[51:30] you know every time she would tell me I
[51:32] would tell her well I don't know what's
[51:34] what is there but I I just think there
[51:37] is something you know uh that God is
[51:40] doing. I can tell what what is there but
[51:42] it was good to talk to the lady today.
[51:44] So and uh uh so I went up to her and
[51:47] greet her and just told her thank you
[51:49] and she said she told me she said no she
[51:51] says oh well you know she's she's my
[51:53] mother. She came into my life just when
[51:56] I've lost my mother.
[51:59] And uh uh you know and that that
[52:04] explained a whole lot and uh uh but but
[52:09] again unless you have been around a
[52:12] little bit unless uh you know uh uh uh
[52:15] certain group of people you would just
[52:18] see that there is just something you
[52:21] know uh uh there is just something
[52:23] special. What is it? We don't want to
[52:26] put interpretation to it, but you can
[52:29] just tell that it has it have to be God.
[52:33] Amen. It have to be God. And that really
[52:37] really really blessed my heart. Praise
[52:39] the Lord. Really blessed my heart
[52:41] because uh uh uh
[52:46] yeah, I I'll leave it. I'll leave it as
[52:48] that. So that was one of the thing that
[52:50] make me happy today. Amen.
[52:53] That's one of the thing that that make
[52:55] me happy today. So, tonight I want to I
[52:59] want to uh get back to what we've been
[53:01] talking about uh continue in in the line
[53:04] of thought of the the rather and the
[53:06] beast and uh uh I will take this uh
[53:10] first quote for you. Uh we will see
[53:12] Jesus is something that we uh we are
[53:15] familiar familiar with. We will see
[53:17] Jesus.
[53:19] Now remember God take his man but never
[53:23] his spirit.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So if you if you take that in in the
[53:29] land of thought wave the rathers you
[53:34] know uh uh one man goes uh you know the
[53:38] same spirit continue and pick up another
[53:40] man you know and it continue and it
[53:42] continue. So uh that's that's the reason
[53:45] why I throw I throw this there. Remember
[53:49] God take his man but never his spirit.
[53:51] The devil takes his man but never his
[53:53] spirit. The same spirit was on Elijah
[53:58] came on Elisha.
[54:00] Same one was on Elisha came on John the
[54:04] Baptist. Praise the Lord.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. 800 years later, the Holy Spirit
[54:11] that was on Christ
[54:14] come on the church
[54:16] &gt;&gt; and will and will remain until Jesus
[54:20] come. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Pray that. So So we can identify our
[54:23] rather.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Who is our rather? The Holy Spirit.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Who is our rather? The
[54:30] Holy Spirit. Jesus is our rather in the
[54:33] form of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; We are his be. He is our rabbit. Praise
[54:38] the Lord.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; So if you if you look at it also, you
[54:43] can see
[54:44] uh uh uh you know uh uh why the Elijah
[54:50] promise have restoration because what
[54:54] the spirit is riding four times. Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Is actually riding four times after
[55:02] Elijah the teacher. When the spirit
[55:05] leaves him, he riding full time. And
[55:07] that is the principle of restoration.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; When he's caught, he must restore four
[55:13] times. So you can see why the the the uh
[55:17] restoration, the promise of restoration
[55:20] is attached to the ministry of Elijah
[55:23] because uh uh uh is is is wrapped in the
[55:26] principle. Praise the Lord.
[55:30] Now, so tonight, uh, I I read from
[55:33] Revelation chapter 5. I I want you to
[55:35] pay attention to, I mean, what we've
[55:37] been trying to bring to you. uh uh and
[55:42] uh uh
[55:45] we started at Revelation chapter 6, but
[55:48] I felt like it was it was a kind of a
[55:50] incomplete uh uh thing because when you
[55:54] talk about the rather uh uh
[55:58] Emanuel, if you'll put my picture up for
[56:00] me, please. Praise the Lord.
[56:04] Amen.
[56:08] Now, so uh if you if you read in
[56:10] Revelation chapter 4 where we read on
[56:13] Sunday, it was mostly trying to identify
[56:17] this beast. It was trying to identify
[56:21] this beast. Are we together?
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6 that we read last
[56:29] uh uh uh last Wednesday
[56:32] uh was mostly
[56:34] talking about this. Even though we have
[56:37] one of the four B said come and see.
[56:41] Praise the Lord.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; So on Sunday what we were trying to do
[56:46] was that we were trying to identify
[56:48] because uh we read this I read this to
[56:51] you on Sunday. Mark of the beast uh
[56:54] brother Brandham said watch this beast.
[56:57] It have four different characters in it.
[57:00] So we were looking at the
[57:02] characteristics of these beasts and to
[57:05] be able to find their characteristics uh
[57:08] uh we we identify that they are the the
[57:10] the influence that is upon them keep
[57:13] them around the throne.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; So Revelation chapter 4 they were around
[57:20] the throne.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; These beasts are not around the throne.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; These ones are coming from the
[57:28] bottomless pit. Praise the Lord.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; These are around the throne.
[57:37] So you go to Revelation chapter 5. You
[57:40] also see them around the throne.
[57:44] Are we together?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is where this is where
[57:48] it's going to get interesting tonight
[57:50] because when you look in Revelation
[57:52] chapter 5, just like we have read, the
[57:54] strong angel proclaimed, "No man is
[57:56] walting." Verse four, I wept much
[57:59] because no man was found wanting to open
[58:01] the book and to read,
[58:04] neither to look there on. And one of the
[58:07] elders said unto me, "Wepth, behold,
[58:12] the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[58:17] the root of David,
[58:19] has prevailed to open the book,
[58:23] and to loose the seals thereof." Praise
[58:27] the Lord.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The other says the lion of the
[58:31] tribe of Judah. And we found out that
[58:33] the lion is also
[58:37] one of the beasts.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Now, you got to pay attention to this.
[58:40] Now, amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Because uh uh if if you don't if you
[58:46] don't pay attention, you you'll be you
[58:47] misunderstand me.
[58:50] If you remember, I don't know, we we
[58:52] spoke on this back when we were talking
[58:54] about the return of the dove.
[58:58] Amen.
[58:59] When we were talking about the return of
[59:01] the do because that's what I want to go
[59:03] to tonight and to to be able to remind
[59:06] you and clarify uh uh our thoughts on
[59:09] that. When we were talking about the
[59:11] return of the dove, we said the dove
[59:13] will only come on a lamin nature.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; The dove will only come on the lamb in
[59:21] nature.
[59:23] But we realize here
[59:26] the elder told John
[59:29] that the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[59:32] prevailed. And verse six, and I beheld
[59:37] and lo in the midst of the throne
[59:42] and of the four beasts. In the midst of
[59:45] the throne and of the four beasts,
[59:47] because these four beasts are always
[59:48] around the throne. Are we together?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; The elder said what? The lion of the
[59:56] tribe of Judah has prevailed.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; You have to follow that. He says the
[1:00:01] lion has prevailed.
[1:00:04] But when John looked,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; he saw a lamb.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; When John looked, he saw a lamb. The
[1:00:16] lion was not there, but the lion has
[1:00:19] prevailed.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what prevail means?
[1:00:31] What do prevail means?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; That's what it means. Prevail means to
[1:00:37] overcome.
[1:00:39] Are we together?
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Now, let's let's read this from the from
[1:00:42] the message the bridge.
[1:00:46] Let's read it from the bridge.
[1:00:49] If you if you put that up for me. Uh uh.
[1:00:54] And John started crying because no one
[1:00:58] was walting and no one could even look
[1:01:03] at the book. Oh, it took a human being
[1:01:07] John because no one could do it and
[1:01:10] everything was lost. And there came a
[1:01:14] voice
[1:01:16] from one of the others standing in the
[1:01:19] midst of the four beasts.
[1:01:24] and all the great host of heaven. Don't
[1:01:26] weep, John. Oh mine, the grace of God.
[1:01:30] Don't be brokenhearted, John. Don't weep
[1:01:33] for the lion of the trap of Judah, the
[1:01:36] root and the offspring of David, he has
[1:01:39] prevailed.
[1:01:40] Prevail means to russle with and
[1:01:44] overcome.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prevail means to wrestle with and
[1:01:50] overcome. Now, so put my image back up.
[1:01:55] So you see that uh each of these
[1:01:58] anointing was rrestling with this
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; in every age
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; for the believer for us to overcome.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; God gave an anointing
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; that will wrestle with this spirit.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you can be
[1:02:16] tempted. You get you deliver and again
[1:02:19] it come back and tempt you. that there
[1:02:21] is an anointing that is wrestling with
[1:02:23] this.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; And and in every age it was said to him
[1:02:29] that overcome.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; To him that prevail.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; To him that prevail. Now it looks like
[1:02:40] you know what oh Satan I rebuke you. I I
[1:02:44] I you know I I I rebuke you. I condemn
[1:02:46] the spirit and all of that. It's it's
[1:02:48] it's beautiful. All of those exercise is
[1:02:50] beautiful.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; But the thing that is making you to
[1:02:54] overcome is this.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Is the anointing you are under.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Leave this word. You see how your life
[1:03:02] will be.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; The thing that is making you to overcome
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; is this anointing.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Leave the word. You will see how your
[1:03:13] life will be.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:16] There is nothing in you
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; to stand this
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; evil.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; This was the anointing that make 6
[1:03:27] million Jews were killed.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; This very anointing that that that
[1:03:34] killed believers through the ages.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; The other said, John, we've met.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; The lion of the trap of Judah
[1:03:58] has prevailed.
[1:04:01] But when John looked,
[1:04:03] he saw a lamb.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He was looking for the lion and he saw a
[1:04:10] lamb.
[1:04:11] Are we together?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; So when we talk when we spoke on the
[1:04:15] return of the dove, what we were dealing
[1:04:18] with is there because the dove will only
[1:04:21] come on a lamin nature.
[1:04:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; We we said that uh each of these beasts
[1:04:33] each each of these anointing they were
[1:04:36] the anointing. They were the the defense
[1:04:39] force of God for the truth church.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; The dove will not come on the lion.
[1:04:49] The dove will only come on the lion when
[1:04:51] the lion has a lamb nature.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So we are looking at the anointing
[1:05:02] and we are also looking at the nature.
[1:05:07] Because a man can has the anointing
[1:05:09] anointed one at the end time. Brother
[1:05:12] Brandon was saying that there are people
[1:05:14] that will come under this this
[1:05:16] anointing. They can get anointed but
[1:05:19] their nature is not changed.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; So you see
[1:05:30] the other says the lion has prevailed.
[1:05:33] Amen. An anointing has gone forth.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; But when you are looking for the for for
[1:05:39] the anointing that has gone forth, you
[1:05:41] must look for the nature.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Because the anointing that has gone
[1:05:48] forth will not rejoice in his own
[1:05:51] strength.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; It will not try to make people to praise
[1:05:56] him or worship him.
[1:06:00] No, we must look for that lamin nature
[1:06:03] which is the nature of Christ.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So what I said at that time was that uh
[1:06:11] uh because
[1:06:14] the anointing we will get there I don't
[1:06:17] want to run ahead of myself but this
[1:06:19] lion anointing was the anointing that
[1:06:25] ruled in the first three church ages.
[1:06:27] That's why I'm moving my arrow on this
[1:06:30] first three block in the pyramid. This
[1:06:33] anointing was the anointing that cover
[1:06:36] the first three church ages.
[1:06:39] And uh by the grace of God, we will we
[1:06:41] will go there. We will be able to show
[1:06:43] you a little bit of that. And so uh uh
[1:06:51] so John
[1:06:54] who said they are the
[1:06:57] John
[1:06:59] represented the bride of all the ages.
[1:07:02] Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He represent the bride. But John in
[1:07:09] himself
[1:07:12] in himself the time that he was with the
[1:07:15] church and all of that uh uh he was
[1:07:18] under the lion anointing.
[1:07:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Because it's it's from the beginning of
[1:07:26] the first church ages, the the Ephesian
[1:07:29] church ages. So all the believers that
[1:07:31] were on the first church age, the second
[1:07:33] church age, the third church age, they
[1:07:35] were all under the lion anointing.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Now during the time of the persecution,
[1:07:46] the dark church ages, what do you think
[1:07:49] the elder will have said?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; The elves has prevailed.
[1:07:57] Are we together? The other will have
[1:08:00] said the ox has prevailed because the
[1:08:03] power that was making the believers to
[1:08:06] overcome in the dark age was the ox
[1:08:09] anointing.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; He would have said the ox has prevailed.
[1:08:24] What would the angel the air echo in our
[1:08:27] day? What were the air echo?
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; The ego.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; The ego has prevailed.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Because when we when we spoke on that,
[1:08:38] we we we we we went through the message
[1:08:41] on the wings of a snow white dome where
[1:08:43] brother Brandon was explaining to us his
[1:08:46] experience. You know, when God told him
[1:08:48] the eagle on the rock and he heard the
[1:08:50] voice, the the the the dove will lead
[1:08:53] the eagle.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] The dove coming to lead the eagle. How
[1:08:58] can the dove lead an eagle?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It cannot go as far as the eagle can go.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But remember now the
[1:09:08] dove is a type of the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; It's the nature.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Am I confusing you? Now please I I I
[1:09:21] will want to to al you again if you have
[1:09:24] if anything create question in your mind
[1:09:26] write me write send us question. Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that you are
[1:09:30] understanding and if you are not writing
[1:09:32] question it means that you did not
[1:09:34] understand what I said.
[1:09:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:40] Amen.
[1:09:43] If you are not writing question it means
[1:09:45] that you did not understand what I said.
[1:09:49] So you need to send me question.
[1:09:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you know the thing about
[1:09:56] it then is that uh uh uh you say well I
[1:09:59] don't have question because I understand
[1:10:01] and sometime you really don't
[1:10:02] understand.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And because I mean uh uh I mean even
[1:10:13] even in in teaching principle I don't
[1:10:15] know some other brothers Hillary every
[1:10:16] one of them they were teachers. The
[1:10:18] thing there is that if you teach a class
[1:10:20] and nobody have question,
[1:10:23] you never did a good job.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; You never did a good job.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; It's just what that just what I'm
[1:10:31] saying. Maybe it coming out very funny
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; but uh that's that's what I mean.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Then you you are not doing a good job
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; because just for you for you to just
[1:10:42] believe that you so excellent that you
[1:10:45] talking everybody understand. No, I
[1:10:47] don't think I'm excellent that way. So,
[1:10:50] please if there is any question around
[1:10:52] this subject or around any subject.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Let's let's uh let's let's create the
[1:10:58] attitude of asking question. Don't just
[1:11:01] be assuming in your mind.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I would I would not get mad with you to
[1:11:05] go over it again and again and again. I
[1:11:08] won't get mad with you because the
[1:11:09] reason why I'm I'm I'm doing it is that
[1:11:12] brother Brandham says how how can we
[1:11:14] overcome? We must know the devil in all
[1:11:17] of his tricks.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And if you don't understand
[1:11:24] the anointing where your strength is
[1:11:27] coming from, take take for example,
[1:11:29] beautiful. Take for example, look at
[1:11:32] Samson.
[1:11:34] He knew he was born on a covenant. Amen.
[1:11:39] All Samson had to do was just to shake
[1:11:42] his head and make sure his seven lot was
[1:11:44] there.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; No matter whether he was in the deepest
[1:11:49] sleep,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; all he need to do was to just make sure
[1:11:52] that his servant Lord was there. He
[1:11:55] would beat any amount of troops.
[1:12:01] Why? Because he was not trusting in his
[1:12:04] muscles.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He was not trusting in his prayer life.
[1:12:07] He was not trusting in how much he was
[1:12:10] obedient to God word. He were not even
[1:12:12] obedient to God word. He went down there
[1:12:14] to the Philistine and start running
[1:12:15] after Philistine girl that is
[1:12:17] disobedient to God's word.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But he knew that his strength was not in
[1:12:24] his ability. His strength was given to
[1:12:26] him at his birth
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and your strength is given to you at
[1:12:30] your birth.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So because he knew that
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; he said, "Oh, you just tell him when the
[1:12:41] time I when I pour weed around my head
[1:12:43] and this this this, they will get me."
[1:12:46] This is a Sam the Philistines are here.
[1:12:49] He just woke up. He didn't even look for
[1:12:51] where is the door, where is the window.
[1:12:53] He just shake his head. All he had to
[1:12:55] know there is that he was under the
[1:12:57] seven lot.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That all he had to know.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you can know that your
[1:13:04] strength is in the word, your defense is
[1:13:07] in the word, your power comes from the
[1:13:09] word.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; No matter what your life is trapped in,
[1:13:14] all you have to do run back to the word.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; All you have to do just run back to the
[1:13:26] word. Lord, I'm sorry your word says
[1:13:28] this and I break your word. forgive me,
[1:13:31] cleanse me, deliver me.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; But if you don't know where your
[1:13:37] strength comes from, then you know what
[1:13:39] you do? You get on the on on the
[1:13:42] religious trampoline.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You get on a religious trampoline. You
[1:13:49] know that one when you are running, you
[1:13:51] going nowhere
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and you sweating.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; When you going anywhere, you ready in
[1:13:57] your garage or only basement.
[1:14:00] and you're sweating
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and then we get on that religious
[1:14:04] trampoline and you know we start
[1:14:06] exercising oursel seven day fight and
[1:14:09] and and you know you start trying to
[1:14:10] produce every the devil will just give
[1:14:14] you a space of time
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; when you have exhausted your strength
[1:14:17] then he comes back again
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; because you don't know where your
[1:14:21] defense is amen
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; you don't know where your defense is
[1:14:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; So that's the reason why we trying to go
[1:14:39] around this, around this, around this,
[1:14:41] just to be able to remind ourself. Look,
[1:14:44] I'm telling you, this age is evil.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; There's a pressure out there.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; It's just like a vacuum. It can suck
[1:14:54] you.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It can I I I'm telling
[1:15:00] you I mean sometimes just uh you I mean
[1:15:02] you look at something on uh on on
[1:15:04] YouTube and then and then before you
[1:15:06] realize you finish spending an hour
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; you finish spending an hour doing
[1:15:11] nothing.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You are looking everything you looking
[1:15:14] at you are mad.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; How can it be you mad but you stay there
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; it's not bringing you joy. It's not
[1:15:21] bringing you money. It's not bring but
[1:15:23] it is because it's just like a vacuum.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; It suck you in.
[1:15:30] A habit can suck you in.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But if the devil can get you to the
[1:15:44] place where he can he can he can he can
[1:15:47] he can make you not to remember that
[1:15:50] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:15:52] are in Christ. He can just keep you in a
[1:15:55] cycle of condemnation. I mean, you're
[1:15:58] just feeling condemned. You're just
[1:15:59] feeling condemned. You're just feeling
[1:16:01] condemned. And then you get to the place
[1:16:03] and you ask yourself, but what is the
[1:16:05] meaning of all of this?
[1:16:07] God don't love me. I can never change.
[1:16:11] Praise the Lord. And then you say, well,
[1:16:14] I I just going to quit. I'm going to
[1:16:16] just go going to live. And then then you
[1:16:18] go start living any any kind of a life
[1:16:20] you want to live. Then the pre the
[1:16:22] predestinated see your little faith in
[1:16:24] your heart condemning. You know you're
[1:16:25] not supposed to live like this. You know
[1:16:27] you're not supposed to do this. Oh God
[1:16:28] I'm sorry. I think I need to go back to
[1:16:30] church.
[1:16:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; As now you get back to the church then
[1:16:36] the devil come against you. All the ugly
[1:16:38] thing you do, you just want to become a
[1:16:40] hrance to this church.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Then you are you caught riding a cycle
[1:16:49] now.
[1:16:50] You can't get victory anymore
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; because we don't realize that our help
[1:16:56] come from the Lord.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Our help comes from the Lord.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; What God has provided.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; What God has provided.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; So that's that's what I wanted to to to
[1:17:17] remind you a little bit
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:17:22] The lion has prevailed.
[1:17:26] The ox did prevail in this age.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The man prevailed. You
[1:17:34] you know I I will get there. I'll get it
[1:17:37] to you. I'll get there and read it to
[1:17:39] you. Brother Brandham says in the in the
[1:17:41] in the main age.
[1:17:44] He said the logical thing the logical
[1:17:48] thing for them to do was to organize.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that was that was the age you
[1:18:00] were under.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder honor thy age
[1:18:09] all of the different names
[1:18:12] of our our denomination started.
[1:18:18] Luther came out with reformation
[1:18:24] and he pul those thesis on the on the on
[1:18:26] on on the church. He came out not with
[1:18:30] the forward
[1:18:32] but something burning in his heart to
[1:18:34] get to the forward.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; The joy shall live by faith but he don't
[1:18:38] have the forward.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And this man is condemning everything
[1:18:43] that the church is doing. He still
[1:18:46] carrying on with a pipe
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; in his mouth.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] He does not have the full word, but God
[1:18:58] is using him because
[1:19:03] he was under this anointing
[1:19:09] right there. Zwingling comes out and
[1:19:11] says uh uh uh uh uh what what Lu is
[1:19:14] saying is is is is right, but he's
[1:19:17] compromising.
[1:19:19] He stayed he stayed uh in in contact
[1:19:21] with the king.
[1:19:24] If we are the church, let's cut away
[1:19:26] from the church. We we don't have no I
[1:19:28] mean let's cut away from the state. We
[1:19:29] don't have nothing to do with the state.
[1:19:31] We will not salute. We will not sing the
[1:19:34] national anthem. That's why you get your
[1:19:36] your your
[1:19:38] uh uh Jehovah Witness don't want to
[1:19:40] salute and and and you know Latterday
[1:19:43] Saints. You get all of these things.
[1:19:45] Every naming denomination came from
[1:19:48] under this. The logical thing to do was
[1:19:51] to organize.
[1:19:58] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:20:02] As as uh as uh as as as the reformation
[1:20:05] came in, you know, the blessing was
[1:20:07] coming. The people were gradually
[1:20:08] returning back to the to the true
[1:20:11] baptism, it it started become becoming a
[1:20:14] struggle because Catholic has has has
[1:20:16] introduced sprinkling to the people.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Sprinkling to the people. And as the
[1:20:22] church started getting back to baptism
[1:20:26] by immersion
[1:20:31] in the time of the reformation, it was
[1:20:33] called the Anabaptist. That's where the
[1:20:34] Baptist church came from.
[1:20:38] The Baptist church separated because at
[1:20:41] that time they were promoting immersion
[1:20:44] even though they were doing it in
[1:20:46] father, son, and the holy ghost.
[1:20:49] But they could go back to the word and
[1:20:51] say that word baptism means to be
[1:20:53] immersed.
[1:20:55] Are we together?
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Man of Simon, he was a priest. He he
[1:21:01] listened a little bit to what uh Luther
[1:21:03] was saying. He said it's truth. I you
[1:21:05] know I can't be like Zwingley. I'm not
[1:21:07] going to be radical. I'm not going to be
[1:21:10] like like uh Luther.
[1:21:14] So he formed
[1:21:17] what is called the the the the how do
[1:21:20] you call it? Menonites.
[1:21:23] That's how the Menanites was born from
[1:21:26] man of Simon.
[1:21:29] So you see all of these men, they were
[1:21:31] going back to the to the anointing.
[1:21:35] There is an anointing that was
[1:21:36] influencing them to come out of the
[1:21:39] church, come out of the church. But
[1:21:40] whenever they come, they organize with
[1:21:43] an idea
[1:21:45] and it became a denomination.
[1:21:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] West came on the scene, the move up
[1:21:55] there, the uh uh uh the Nazareth said,
[1:21:58] "Well, I mean uh uh we believe in
[1:22:00] sanctification, but uh how can we say we
[1:22:02] are sanctified?" And and I mean, we
[1:22:04] still wearing rings on our hands and and
[1:22:06] earrings and and uh so the Nazareth took
[1:22:09] it a little bit further.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; But every time they were move, they
[1:22:18] would take an idea and organize with it.
[1:22:24] Praise the Lord. Instead of moving on
[1:22:26] and moving on and wanting more of God,
[1:22:29] they just take something and organize
[1:22:31] with it. Now we, you know, we can we we
[1:22:33] we we we can wear rings and and and and
[1:22:36] you know, and all of those things now. I
[1:22:38] mean, that's it. We are sanctified.
[1:22:41] Nothing of the word.
[1:22:44] Are we together?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; But in that age
[1:22:54] the other will have said the man has
[1:22:57] prevailed which mean God is raising up
[1:23:01] men.
[1:23:03] God is now raising up men that are going
[1:23:06] to challenge and and and and it was
[1:23:08] right in this age that uh uh uh uh the
[1:23:14] the printing press was built. Right in
[1:23:17] the same age the Bible was printed.
[1:23:25] Now God
[1:23:27] has anointed using
[1:23:30] man mechanism.
[1:23:34] He's now giving man wisdom mechanism
[1:23:38] to publish so this thing can move
[1:23:40] faster.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] Because you know
[1:23:51] you know under the H power
[1:23:55] this was the airplane.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Right in this time.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, right in this time both
[1:24:07] the I mean all all of all of the all all
[1:24:10] of the inventions
[1:24:12] of God and everything came right in this
[1:24:16] time right in this period of time. So
[1:24:18] let's uh may our so
[1:24:21] are we together?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; The lion has prevailed.
[1:24:30] The lion has prevailed. now saying the
[1:24:33] lion the lion of the trap of Judah the
[1:24:36] lion you know of the trap of Judah is
[1:24:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; But we know that all all these anointing
[1:24:46] is Christ.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; They overcame by what? The blood of the
[1:24:51] lamb.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:58] Now uh uh you what what you have to
[1:25:01] understand here is that uh uh uh uh God
[1:25:05] is showing all of these things to John
[1:25:08] in the symbol. You see because if you
[1:25:11] understand the lion has prevailed and
[1:25:15] John turned around and saw a lamb then
[1:25:19] you will understand Revelation chapter 6
[1:25:23] when the lion said come and see.
[1:25:27] Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I went back there
[1:25:32] because when we get back to Revelation
[1:25:34] chapter 6 and one of the the the the the
[1:25:38] beast said come and see.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] Now then you will be able to understand
[1:25:46] what is happening there.
[1:25:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in in in
[1:25:58] Revelation 6:1, the lamb had the open
[1:26:02] book. The book was open where in
[1:26:04] Revelation chapter 5.
[1:26:08] Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't if you don't look
[1:26:11] at it wisely, you will think they are
[1:26:14] different different periods of time.
[1:26:19] Are we together?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] Are we together?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; So that's what I'm trying to to be able
[1:26:34] to bring to us tonight so we can be able
[1:26:37] to see it. And one of the elders said
[1:26:40] unto John, "Weep now behold the lion of
[1:26:43] the tribe of of Judah, the root of David
[1:26:47] has prevailed to open the book and to
[1:26:49] lose the seven seals thereof." But when
[1:26:53] John turned, he saw a lamb.
[1:26:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] When he turned, he saw a lamb
[1:27:08] that was bleeding.
[1:27:10] Praise the Lord. He saw a lamb
[1:27:15] and I behold and I beheld and look in
[1:27:18] the midst of the throne and in of the
[1:27:20] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:27:22] others to a lamb as it has been slain
[1:27:25] having seven halms and seven eyes which
[1:27:28] are the spirit seven spirit of God that
[1:27:31] is sent throughout all the earth. I
[1:27:33] would like to look at that too but
[1:27:35] tonight I just want to dwell on this. So
[1:27:38] uh now we can we can get to Revelation
[1:27:41] chapter 6 quickly. Let me just let me
[1:27:44] just uh uh look at something in
[1:27:45] Revelation chapter 6. So our image will
[1:27:47] stay out there. If you have your Bible
[1:27:49] just look in your Bible. Revelation
[1:27:51] chapter 6 now comes on the scene and it
[1:27:55] says here to us and I saw when the lamb
[1:27:58] opened one of the seal. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:02] And I heard as as it were a noise of
[1:28:06] thunder and one of the four beasts, one
[1:28:10] of these
[1:28:12] saying, "Come and see." Praise the Lord.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come and see."
[1:28:21] The lamb is holding the book. Praise the
[1:28:25] Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The lamb is holding the open book.
[1:28:31] This beast is calling to the elect of
[1:28:35] the age.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; This anointing is calling to the elect
[1:28:41] of the age. Every time Paul preached
[1:28:45] when he when he was there before he left
[1:28:47] the disciples, he says, "I'm not ashamed
[1:28:50] to declare the entire council of God to
[1:28:53] you after my depart departure there.
[1:28:56] There are graving wolves that will come
[1:28:57] among you." Amen.
[1:28:59] As he was under that anointing speaking,
[1:29:03] he was showing the working of
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; of this evil spirit.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Come and see."
[1:29:19] And and and and John is there.
[1:29:23] Is he not John is about to tell us what
[1:29:26] he saw? what what the beast show him. I
[1:29:30] saw and and behold a white house and and
[1:29:34] he that sat on him had a bold
[1:29:38] and a crown was given unto him
[1:29:43] and he went forth
[1:29:46] conquering and to conquer.
[1:29:50] Are we together?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:55] He had a board.
[1:29:59] He had a board. Let me do something for
[1:30:02] you quickly with a few minutes that is
[1:30:05] left.
[1:30:08] With a few with the the few minutes that
[1:30:10] is left.
[1:30:12] Uh
[1:30:14] Revelation chapter 2. Let's go to
[1:30:16] Revelation chapter 2.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 2.
[1:30:38] I have a page that is stick together
[1:30:40] here.
[1:30:46] Now, Revelation chapter 2
[1:30:49] reads unto the angel
[1:30:52] of the church in Ephesus. Right? Now,
[1:30:55] you have to know Epheso is under the
[1:31:00] look. Epheso is under this is under this
[1:31:04] is is right here. This is the Ephesian
[1:31:06] church age. Are we together?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I I just want to show you something. Go
[1:31:11] back to the to the reading there. Thank
[1:31:13] you. You can flip them. I appreciate it.
[1:31:18] This thing said he that holdeth the
[1:31:20] seven stars in his in his right hand who
[1:31:23] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:31:25] count. I know thy works. I know that
[1:31:27] labor that patient and how thou cannot
[1:31:30] bear them which are evil and thou hast
[1:31:33] tried them which say they are apostles
[1:31:37] and are not and has found them liars.
[1:31:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] and have born and and and have uh
[1:31:50] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:31:52] labored and have not fainted.
[1:31:56] Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:31:59] thee because thou
[1:32:02] has left that first love. Now you see
[1:32:05] how go back to the image.
[1:32:09] Thou has left your first love. Now you
[1:32:12] see that that innocent thing is
[1:32:15] represented in the whiteness
[1:32:18] is coming in innocently.
[1:32:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will tell us in the
[1:32:24] church age it was in an unguarded
[1:32:27] moment.
[1:32:30] When they were not paying attention
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; slowly they start falling away from
[1:32:35] those things that were very precious to
[1:32:37] them. those things that could they could
[1:32:40] not allow they could not tolerate they
[1:32:42] start falling away from it. Praise the
[1:32:46] Lord.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] Is that slowly the enemy is creeping in.
[1:32:52] So you see here in Revelation chapter 6
[1:32:56] you only see uh a white horse and a
[1:32:59] rather but in Revelation chapter two
[1:33:02] when you reading the church age that's
[1:33:04] when now you see the rather taking
[1:33:07] place.
[1:33:10] Are we together?
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Now, so and uh uh you left your first
[1:33:17] law. Remember wherefore thou uh were
[1:33:21] where uh remember therefore from whence
[1:33:23] thou are falling and repent and do thy
[1:33:26] first workh or else I come quickly and
[1:33:28] remove that candlestick. Verse six. But
[1:33:32] this thou has
[1:33:36] that thou hated the days of the
[1:33:39] nickelian
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; which
[1:33:43] I also hate. So what is happening here
[1:33:46] is that the nickelian started the
[1:33:49] nickelian spirit started and and what
[1:33:52] was that spirit? What was it?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Conquering.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the white horse went to
[1:34:00] what? Conquer.
[1:34:02] So here is a spirit now that has rised
[1:34:05] up in the church that is now conquering
[1:34:09] the people slowly.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; They are not falling in obedience to the
[1:34:17] word anymore. They don't the word do not
[1:34:20] move them but there is a man that can
[1:34:22] control them.
[1:34:26] When a man yel, they shakes. But when
[1:34:28] they point to they look at the word, the
[1:34:31] word do not move them again. Why?
[1:34:33] Because they are falling away from their
[1:34:34] first love.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; So you see what what I want to show you
[1:34:43] is that in Revelation chapter 6, the
[1:34:46] Bible says he went to conquer. He had a
[1:34:49] bow and what? A crown. Yeah.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham will show us that
[1:34:56] uh this spirit started with the this of
[1:34:59] the nickelen it move on to the next what
[1:35:05] in the next age it became something
[1:35:07] something that was innocent
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and before it get to the third age it
[1:35:12] got crown
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; right
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; that's the crown that was given him
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; the crown was given him in the third age
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; the spirit got crowned among the people.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Baptism, baptizing in father, son, and
[1:35:27] holy ghost was crowned among the people.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; It started very innocent, but it got a
[1:35:34] crown.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; It never had a bowl, so it did not hurt
[1:35:40] the people. It was innocent.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; No, we must not do this. You know, while
[1:35:44] they are special people, we must respect
[1:35:47] and and they just take the the the
[1:35:49] presence of God away from the people.
[1:35:53] The fear of the word was gone away from
[1:35:55] the people. Now men were established in
[1:35:58] the hearts of the people.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; So in the third church age then that
[1:36:11] spirit that doctrine became crown.
[1:36:13] That's that just what I just I just
[1:36:15] wanted to give you a little insight on
[1:36:17] it. But but that's where we are going
[1:36:20] with this.
[1:36:22] So there will be a lot of going back and
[1:36:24] forth. You can see you will see be able
[1:36:28] to see the the uh what did I put this?
[1:36:31] You will see the representation here.
[1:36:35] You will see the representation here.
[1:36:37] But then when you go back to the church
[1:36:39] ages
[1:36:41] then now you will start understanding
[1:36:43] what was really happening.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; So we will get there what was really
[1:36:52] happening. So yeah th that has you hate

[1:50:04] we still looking forward to see if we
[1:50:06] will have our our talk with the church
[1:50:09] on Sunday. I mean it's it's a service.
[1:50:11] It's not just for for you know just just
[1:50:15] you know our members. All I want to
[1:50:18] avoid is that I don't want you know I
[1:50:20] don't want u uh you know internet
[1:50:24] because the thing about it there is that
[1:50:26] one thing I I I realized with the
[1:50:29] internet thing is that the judges are on
[1:50:31] the internet. Amen.
[1:50:33] The judges are on the internet. You know
[1:50:35] they don't know nothing that you're
[1:50:37] dealing with. They just hear one thing
[1:50:38] and then they round up their judgment.
[1:50:41] So I want to keep the judges out. Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to keep the judges out. So
[1:50:46] I I I spoke to brother Jordan to see if
[1:50:48] he can create a kind of a personal
[1:50:51] channel for us. So if if anybody will
[1:50:53] not be in service on Sunday, just let us
[1:50:55] know, send me a text. If we get a
[1:50:58] personal link, we will send it to you
[1:51:00] and uh uh uh then you can be able to
[1:51:03] follow the service while you are not in
[1:51:05] service because I was thinking about it.
[1:51:07] It would not be justice to those that uh
[1:51:10] would love to be here. They can't be
[1:51:11] here with us and and then they can't
[1:51:14] follow online. I just want to keep the
[1:51:15] judges out. Amen. Praise the Lord. If
[1:51:19] you can, if you can appreciate us, don't
[1:51:21] judge us. Don't condemn us. Amen. Praise
[1:51:24] the Lord. So, let's sing that song.

[1:52:17] for we are united in Jesus Christ. We
[1:52:22] are the soldiers of the life. We don't
[1:52:26] rise of flesh and blood. But politics
[1:52:30] are done that we do our magic. Don't be
[1:52:35] crushing the enemy. Honor our faith. We
[1:52:39] are mighty in our standing.
[1:52:44] Oh yet we are united in Jesus Christ. We
[1:52:49] are the soldier of the might. We don't
[1:52:53] rise.
