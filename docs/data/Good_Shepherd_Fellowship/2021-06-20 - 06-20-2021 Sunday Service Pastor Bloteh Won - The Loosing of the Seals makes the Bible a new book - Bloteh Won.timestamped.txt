[18:04] when i woke up this morning i had a
[18:06] little song on my heart
[18:08] i hadn't sung for
[18:11] many years and uh i thought i'd
[18:15] maybe teach it to the congregation this
[18:17] morning
[18:19] it has a little story that goes behind
[18:21] it old brother gerald hughes down in
[18:24] columbia south carolina has been pastor
[18:26] for
[18:28] as far back as i can remember probably
[18:30] for 45 years
[18:33] and in his church he had a song leader
[18:37] brother neil storm and brother neal
[18:41] when he was younger had had an accident
[18:44] and
[18:45] actually had to have half of his arm
[18:49] actually amputated
[18:51] but he didn't let that slow him down
[18:53] here he was this long leader wonderful
[18:55] song leader and he would he when he gets
[18:58] stirred up he would take
[19:00] the tambourine with his good arm and
[19:02] bang it on the stump of his other arm
[19:05] and uh his wonderful brother but there
[19:08] was a song that he sang and

[30:33] have less of

[30:37] in one of you
[30:38] i think that's a good way for us to
[30:41] learn to celebrate our birthday
[30:43] and the birth date of our loved ones

[30:46] bringing prayer requests praise the lord
[30:49] but we say happy birthday to each and

[30:52] amen praise the lord and
[30:56] i want to greet one of our young friend
[31:00] brother joseph moncoco it was good to
[31:03] have him coming
[31:04] to come by and visit with us
[31:08] i was saying a little bit about him on
[31:10] wednesday night and then i got into
[31:11] something else
[31:13] uh uh joseph dale was the voice of god
[31:17] represented
[31:18] there in africa and i can say that i got
[31:21] to know him back
[31:23] since uh 1990
[31:28] late 1994 when i first went
[31:32] to the average cost and that's when i
[31:34] got to know him 95
[31:36] 95 to be exact because i went to the
[31:39] agriculture 94 in november
[31:41] but i didn't travel to to abigail until
[31:45] the following year 9 to 5. so i got to
[31:48] know him because
[31:51] since i was moving to the average coast
[31:55] i just left our little church there
[31:58] in in the town in in liberia that went
[32:01] across the border because we were
[32:02] planning to move because of the unrest
[32:05] in liberia so while we got down to
[32:08] to abidjan and we wanted to meet with a
[32:11] person in charge of the voice of god to
[32:13] make sure
[32:14] i mean we will be able to have some
[32:16] materials because we have
[32:18] very little materials those days praise
[32:21] the lord
[32:21] you see that's what i love my bible
[32:24] because i really started seeing the
[32:25] message in the pages of the bible before
[32:28] i even
[32:28] hear it on tape praise the lord so
[32:32] we had just few boxing so we wanted to
[32:34] make contact
[32:36] and we went down there and met brother
[32:38] eric and we became
[32:40] good friends we became good friends and
[32:43] uh over the years we will go
[32:46] down for his convention and sometimes we
[32:50] will visit with him
[32:51] i was i was telling telling joseph you
[32:54] know uh
[32:56] before his dad even got married to his
[32:59] mom
[33:00] where i knew him knew the dad and we
[33:03] will
[33:03] spend some time to his house and and at
[33:06] the time he was in school also
[33:08] uh he was a student i came to study in
[33:12] africa
[33:13] and and had the burden to start a work
[33:15] day
[33:16] so uh we will be walking from his house
[33:19] you know and going to church and and
[33:22] then uh
[33:24] he says he was saying to me bro sing
[33:26] this song uh
[33:29] one of them one of them you know you
[33:31] know then i'll start singing and we're
[33:33] just walking on the street you know
[33:35] one of them and we're going to church
[33:37] you know and
[33:38] and we we have some good time together
[33:40] amen
[33:41] we have some good time together and uh
[33:47] but uh it pleased the lord to so
[33:50] to take our brother home uh some part of
[33:53] last year if you remember we
[33:55] we announced the passing of uh brother
[33:58] eric moncoco
[34:00] last year that's uh joseph there
[34:03] so i thought that world okay i will
[34:06] i think i will i can have him come over
[34:10] because i mean he was small when i left
[34:12] you know and uh
[34:14] so uh i just thought of having come over
[34:18] and spent some time with him
[34:20] and he just graduated too so we say
[34:24] congratulations joseph
[34:26] and uh and he's he's he's a young
[34:29] preacher too so

[35:13] of him and my dad but when he started
[35:16] talking he started
[35:17] mentioning stuff that only like my dad
[35:20] knew
[35:21] so i realized that he was very close to
[35:23] him

[35:49] pastor too
[35:50] in his house and it was truly a blessing
[35:53] to me the lord

[48:33] morning
[48:34] to be able to finally
[48:38] declare that the little child was there
[48:40] we decided to go through the hospital
[48:43] and we stopped by there and and
[48:46] talked to the parents a little bit
[48:48] encourage them
[48:49] and uh you know just like brother
[48:51] brandon said
[48:53] you know as i was driving to the
[48:54] hospital i just put up uh they called
[48:56] the injured of the law where brother
[48:58] brandon was talking about those two boys
[48:59] that was raised in finland from the from
[49:02] the car accident
[49:03] you know and like the prophet said he

[49:17] hospital
[49:18] and i stopped there then uh went in the
[49:20] room
[49:21] uh talked to the parents a little bit
[49:24] and uh
[49:25] [Music]
[49:26] prayed with the child we read james

[49:30] 5 uh verse 13. uh uh
[49:33] there's one's sake called the editors
[49:35] anoint him of oi
[49:37] you know how to make the parents to know
[49:39] that what i was doing was
[49:41] i was just trying to follow scriptural
[49:42] principle i was not uh
[49:45] kind of for performing anything that was
[49:47] out of order so i had to read that
[49:49] scripture
[49:49] and just tell them this is exactly what
[49:52] i'm i'll be doing
[49:53] you know so we announced the child but a
[49:56] strange thing took place while we were
[49:58] praying
[49:59] and one of the monitor they had on the
[50:01] child started to go it started to beep
[50:03] you know and i could tell that the
[50:06] mother
[50:07] was so anxious for the miracle as soon
[50:10] as we said amen she said call the doctor
[50:12] call
[50:12] i mean call the nurse call the nurse and
[50:14] when the nurse came and she says it was
[50:16] beeping it was beeping you could just
[50:18] tell
[50:18] how she was so anxious to have her baby
[50:21] back in her hands
[50:23] you know and the nurse the nurse re read
[50:26] that and says well yeah it was it was
[50:28] its temperature
[50:30] you know it was it was the baby
[50:31] temperature i think she said uh
[50:33] decreasing or increasing one of the two
[50:36] and then uh
[50:37] so we visited a little bit and then i
[50:39] left and uh and i came over here at the
[50:42] church
[50:43] and uh i just wanted to be alone
[50:46] a little bit and pray but i would say
[50:50] that uh uh having
[50:54] that burden on my heart to go over to
[50:57] the hospital
[50:58] you know turn out to become a blessing
[51:00] for me you know
[51:02] let's read the scripture so i won't keep
[51:04] you standing long revelation chapter
[51:06] five let's read from verse 1.
[51:08] and i saw in the hands of him that sat
[51:10] on the throne a book written
[51:13] within and on the backside
[51:18] sealed with seven seals
[51:23] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[51:26] with a loud voice
[51:27] who is worthy to open the book
[51:31] and to lose the seals thereof
[51:36] and no man in heaven none
[51:39] in earth neither honor
[51:43] the earth was able to open the book
[51:47] neither to look there on
[51:51] and i wept much because no man was found
[51:54] walter
[51:55] to open and to read the book neither to
[51:58] look
[51:58] their own and one of the others
[52:02] said unto me weep ned behold the lion of
[52:06] the tribe of judah
[52:08] the root of david has prevailed to open
[52:11] the book
[52:12] and to lose the seals
[52:16] the seven seals thereof
[52:19] i want to read verse five again and one
[52:22] of the elders said unto
[52:24] me weep net behold
[52:27] the lion of the tribe of judah the root
[52:30] of david
[52:31] has prevailed to open the book
[52:34] and to lose the seven seals thereof
[52:38] let's pray together father lord jesus
[52:41] with with heavy heart lord we come to
[52:45] you oh god
[52:46] but lord father we are so grateful to
[52:50] know you
[52:51] in the way that you have revealed
[52:52] yourself to us
[52:54] in this day lord precious lord jesus
[52:58] we thank you father we appreciate you
[53:01] lord
[53:01] we glorify your holy name we have just
[53:04] read your word
[53:05] and you are the altar of this word
[53:08] father
[53:09] we pray to god that you will come take
[53:11] your word
[53:13] release it to our hearts lord
[53:16] bless us now father the rest of the
[53:19] service is in your hands
[53:22] in jesus name we pray amen
[53:25] amen praise the lord the lord bless you
[53:28] you may have your seed all glory be to
[53:32] god
[53:33] amen this morning i want to i want to
[53:37] speak
[53:38] on uh on water what i want to use as a
[53:41] title
[53:43] i've never never been fond of making a
[53:45] long title like this
[53:48] but it's just to make sense of what i
[53:49] want to talk about the losing of the
[53:51] seals
[53:53] makes the bible a new book
[53:58] the losing of the seals make the bible
[54:03] a new book now the reason why i want to
[54:06] talk or i try to use this
[54:08] this as a title is is because
[54:13] we talked about you know brother branham
[54:15] used the phrase i was just looking at it
[54:17] in the office before
[54:19] i came out he used that phrase
[54:22] i mean many times all through the
[54:24] scripture
[54:25] of the bible being the new book and
[54:28] and you will realize if you go back to
[54:30] search that brother branham even started
[54:32] using that scripture before the seals
[54:34] were open or he started using
[54:36] that statement before the seals were
[54:39] open
[54:40] praise the lord glory be to god are we
[54:44] together
[54:46] amen you know that's the way we have
[54:49] ever been able to achieve anything in
[54:51] this church when we stay together
[54:54] praise the lord amen
[54:58] amen so uh just i mean just like
[55:03] i was saying praise the lord
[55:09] amen
[55:16] just bear with me a little bit i'm
[55:17] trying to
[55:21] brett branham says here this is 1955
[55:24] he said it's not part of my quotes to be
[55:26] projected so
[55:27] you'll forgive me but i'm just trying to
[55:30] make a point here by reading this
[55:32] the bible is not a western book
[55:36] he says it's an eastern book and a few
[55:38] trips across
[55:40] c will let you become more acquainted
[55:43] and custom
[55:45] of what the bible and thinks he said
[55:48] it's a new book
[55:49] to you when you once live
[55:53] with the jewish people where the bible
[55:56] is written so this is back 1965
[56:00] and uh
[56:04] faith 1965 he says the bible becomes a
[56:06] new book to you
[56:08] if you are ever in palestine in oregon
[56:12] country so
[56:12] i'm just reading this to say brother
[56:14] branham started making their statement
[56:16] before the seals were open
[56:18] that the bible is a new book but
[56:22] when the seals were open and
[56:25] [Music]
[56:26] it gave us clarity
[56:30] let me see like that he gave us clarity
[56:33] of what he meant
[56:35] that's right praise the lord
[56:38] and the reason is because
[56:44] many people think that when brother
[56:46] branham says
[56:47] the bible has become a new book
[56:50] somewhere says
[56:51] you know that uh uh uh
[56:55] you know brother branham what whatever
[56:57] he says
[56:58] you know we would take what he says than
[57:00] what the bible says
[57:02] you know someone says uh you know i no
[57:04] longer read the bible again because the
[57:06] message make the bible the new book
[57:08] so i read the message and leave the
[57:09] bible you know and
[57:11] and and people and and this when you
[57:13] study history
[57:15] you realize that this is not the first
[57:17] time there has been fanatic
[57:19] amen there has been financial right from
[57:22] time
[57:23] people just get fanatical idea
[57:26] ideas and you know and and do different
[57:29] things to do strange things
[57:30] and and by the way you know uh
[57:34] when i came right after the the sunday
[57:36] school message this morning
[57:38] uh it was just to be able to
[57:42] to help myself uh you know
[57:45] announce uh what what was happening
[57:48] since we had the church praying
[57:50] all through the week you know i wanted
[57:52] to use that time of praying to kind of
[57:55] settle my spirit that i would not get so
[57:58] emotional
[57:59] because uh uh uh yeah
[58:02] you yeah i mean you know what it is
[58:06] so uh that's what i decided to
[58:09] and i know uh you know all of you being
[58:12] pouring out your heart and
[58:14] and different ones can can relate to
[58:17] uh to death and especially when i saw
[58:20] brother wesley praying this morning
[58:22] and we all know that you know what that
[58:24] would mean to him
[58:26] and uh their beloved john wesley went
[58:30] to be with the lord from a similar
[58:32] situation
[58:33] so uh that was the reason why i came
[58:36] came
[58:36] up and decided that we just we just
[58:39] prayed
[58:40] and uh and be able to settle ourself
[58:42] down
[58:43] praise the lord you know so
[58:46] uh it's it's all it's part of life
[58:50] you know part of life we live and then
[58:52] we pass on
[58:54] when the lord turrets when our time
[58:56] reaches
[58:58] you know i was talking to young people
[59:01] and
[59:02] the laws they lost their pastor
[59:05] and uh and they grew up and they were
[59:07] going to pray
[59:08] and they were praying and he said they
[59:10] refuse you know they refuse
[59:12] death you know and they believe that god
[59:15] is going to raise him up
[59:16] so i was talking to one of the young man
[59:18] and you know trying to encourage them
[59:20] after i heard about it
[59:22] and then i told him i said i said sir i
[59:25] said let me tell you boy
[59:28] if you if you if you if you live in the
[59:31] night
[59:32] if you refuse that he's dead there is no
[59:35] way you can raise him up because only a
[59:37] dead man can be raised up
[59:41] you have to come to term and accept
[59:45] that this has happened but i believe
[59:48] that god can change the situation
[59:53] praise the lord living in denial
[59:56] is no way is it's a complete hindrance
[1:00:00] to god
[1:00:04] when you're living in denial when there
[1:00:06] is a reality
[1:00:08] you have to accept the reality
[1:00:11] and believe that god can change this
[1:00:14] reality
[1:00:15] to a better reality
[1:00:21] so i told him i said if you want if you
[1:00:23] want the miracle
[1:00:24] then you have to accept that he's dead
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:34] praise the lord so you see that i mean
[1:00:37] they're just
[1:00:37] fanatical views man has heard all the
[1:00:40] time
[1:00:43] so uh uh looking at this subject
[1:00:46] brother brennan will will help us now as
[1:00:49] we will look through
[1:00:50] the the message or the little thought
[1:00:52] that is on our heart
[1:00:55] you know how the the loosening of the
[1:00:57] seals
[1:00:58] make the bible a new book praise the
[1:01:01] lord
[1:01:02] amen glory be to god
[1:01:06] water wonderful water wonderful we know
[1:01:08] that this is the
[1:01:10] the the book of redemption the bulk word
[1:01:13] no man was walking
[1:01:15] amen amen no man was walted a strong
[1:01:18] angel proclaimed with a loud voice
[1:01:21] who is walking to open the book
[1:01:24] and to lose the seals now you have to
[1:01:28] keep that in your mind who is worthy
[1:01:32] to open the book and to lose the seals
[1:01:38] praise the lord now when you read
[1:01:42] you will you will see the scripture also
[1:01:45] talking about
[1:01:48] uh no man was wanted to look
[1:01:52] upon it no man was worthy to read it
[1:01:57] praise the lord but there is two major
[1:02:01] effect to this book is the opening
[1:02:05] and the losing
[1:02:10] praise the lord oh i pray that the holy
[1:02:13] spirit will help us
[1:02:15] amen there is two major
[1:02:19] effect to this redemption book
[1:02:24] is the opening of the book and the
[1:02:28] losing of faith
[1:02:31] praise the lord
[1:02:36] no man was worthy to look there on
[1:02:39] in verse four it says uh and no man was
[1:02:42] found water to open the balkan to
[1:02:44] to read the book neither to look there
[1:02:46] on
[1:02:47] so open the book look upon it
[1:02:50] read it and loosen the book
[1:02:56] praise the lord
[1:03:01] now if you think about the the way
[1:03:04] revelation chapter 5
[1:03:05] described this book being sealed
[1:03:09] with seven seals
[1:03:12] then in the literal understanding it
[1:03:15] will be
[1:03:16] that the book have to be loose before it
[1:03:19] can even be open
[1:03:25] are we together praise the lord that the
[1:03:28] book has to be
[1:03:29] loose before it can be opened because if
[1:03:32] the book is sealed
[1:03:33] you cannot open the book before you lose
[1:03:36] it
[1:03:38] [Laughter]
[1:03:41] glory be to god amen
[1:03:45] oh thank you jesus what a wonderful
[1:03:48] jesus we serve
[1:03:50] amen glory be to god we realize
[1:03:54] that revelation chapter 10 let's just
[1:03:56] read revelation chapter 10
[1:03:59] amen glory be to god
[1:04:02] revelation chapter 10 reads and i saw
[1:04:05] another mighty
[1:04:06] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:04:09] a cloud and the rainbow
[1:04:11] was upon his head and his face was as it
[1:04:14] were
[1:04:15] as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:04:18] pillow of fire
[1:04:20] and he had in his hand
[1:04:23] a little book open
[1:04:27] praise the lord and then he's he
[1:04:30] he set his right foot upon the seed
[1:04:34] and his left foot upon the earth and he
[1:04:36] cried with a live voice as the lion
[1:04:39] rolith and when he crossed seven thunder
[1:04:42] out of their voices
[1:04:44] praise the lord amen
[1:04:47] so we find here that the book that
[1:04:51] was closed no man was worthy to open
[1:04:56] became an open book in revelation
[1:04:58] chapter 10
[1:04:59] praise the lord and as we as we as we
[1:05:02] read down
[1:05:05] we'll realize that the
[1:05:08] in uh in verse 8
[1:05:11] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:05:14] speak unto me
[1:05:15] saying
[1:05:19] speak again and said go and take
[1:05:23] the little book which is open
[1:05:27] in the hands of the angel we stand upon
[1:05:29] the sea
[1:05:31] and and we realize that the book now was
[1:05:34] taken the book was
[1:05:35] opened by the lamb the book was handed
[1:05:37] down to the seven angel
[1:05:39] of revelation chapter 10 after it has
[1:05:42] been opened
[1:05:43] and that book yet in revelation chapter
[1:05:45] 10 verse 8 and now
[1:05:46] is now handed over to john that is a
[1:05:49] type of the bride
[1:05:51] the book wants that no man was warping
[1:05:54] to even look upon to even read
[1:06:00] is now in the hands of man
[1:06:05] and he's not only hindering the book and
[1:06:08] reading the book but he's asked
[1:06:10] to eat the book and that book is going
[1:06:13] to become part of his life
[1:06:18] praise the lord amen so
[1:06:21] we would just we we would trust the lord
[1:06:25] this morning and ask that he would help
[1:06:27] us i might be doing
[1:06:29] uh kind of for a little bit of reading
[1:06:33] but i believe that the law will be able
[1:06:34] to help us this morning praise the lord
[1:06:37] i read from the breach and
[1:06:40] brother branham says now the book
[1:06:42] remember is seal
[1:06:44] year is one year it is this seal
[1:06:48] then another one wrap seo
[1:06:52] another one is wrap now he's he's
[1:06:54] describing how the book was sealed
[1:06:57] with seven seals he said before it was a
[1:07:00] book it was just a straw amen
[1:07:02] it was a straw that was rolled up you
[1:07:05] know so
[1:07:05] uh he's he's he's now describing that's
[1:07:08] the way he's
[1:07:09] uh uh you know he he choose to describe
[1:07:12] that
[1:07:13] he says uh uh remember the seal and
[1:07:16] yeris won and here is this seal then
[1:07:19] another one is
[1:07:20] rob a seal another one is wrapped a seal
[1:07:24] is a book of redemption
[1:07:28] and the whole thing together makes
[1:07:32] the book and and it's sealed
[1:07:36] with seven seals and then
[1:07:40] on is on the back side
[1:07:44] is because it's worn up
[1:07:47] because it's worn up or it's rolled up
[1:07:49] let me see that way
[1:07:53] the seal mystery
[1:07:56] is on the inside
[1:08:00] amen the seal mystery is on
[1:08:04] the inside are we together
[1:08:10] the lord
[1:08:15] revelation chapter 5 1 says and i saw
[1:08:19] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:08:21] throne a
[1:08:22] book written within
[1:08:27] is written within
[1:08:32] are we together and on the backside
[1:08:38] sealed with seven seals so brother
[1:08:41] branham here
[1:08:42] is helping us to understand
[1:08:46] that the mystery is in the book
[1:08:50] amen now when people think about the
[1:08:53] seal
[1:08:54] being on the backside of the book they
[1:08:57] think that
[1:08:58] is an extra interpretation
[1:09:02] that is not in the scriptures
[1:09:07] the thing that is an extraordinary it's
[1:09:10] a flying thought
[1:09:14] that the prophet will just come up with
[1:09:16] a flying thought that is not in the
[1:09:18] scripture
[1:09:20] a book written within
[1:09:26] but is still on
[1:09:29] the backside are we together
[1:09:35] the seal mystery is
[1:09:38] on the inside and it's owner said
[1:09:43] the white house rather or the black
[1:09:46] house rather
[1:09:47] and walk more on the outside
[1:09:51] now understand now he's saying
[1:09:55] the seal the mystery is in the book
[1:09:58] but we see this how a white house
[1:10:02] rather and black house rather and then
[1:10:04] see what he said
[1:10:05] he says and what more on the outside
[1:10:11] praise the lord now let me see it this
[1:10:14] way
[1:10:14] that's the reason why a preacher would
[1:10:16] read the book of revelation and think
[1:10:19] that
[1:10:19] john might have overeaten and got a bad
[1:10:22] dream
[1:10:23] why because the things that are written
[1:10:26] there looks like something that is
[1:10:28] outside
[1:10:30] praise the lord if the word of god does
[1:10:32] not make sense to you
[1:10:34] if you read something from this bible
[1:10:37] praise the lord just like
[1:10:40] a god says in his word that uh
[1:10:47] that that illegitimate children
[1:10:51] will not come into the presence of god
[1:10:54] after 10 generations
[1:11:00] praise the lord
[1:11:03] amen now when you read that
[1:11:08] and then you see roof
[1:11:12] coming into the picture of redemption
[1:11:15] it looks like it throw you off
[1:11:19] you try to understand what is happening
[1:11:21] here
[1:11:24] are we together but let me show you
[1:11:28] something
[1:11:33] glory be to god
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:46] are we together
[1:12:03] now when we we read last week we were
[1:12:06] studying about
[1:12:10] we were studying about
[1:12:13] tema last week
[1:12:17] over in genesis chapter 38
[1:12:21] and the child that there might give
[1:12:23] birth to
[1:12:26] if you look in the scripture there
[1:12:32] you will see that uh
[1:12:36] this child
[1:12:42] was called ferrance
[1:12:47] are we together
[1:12:55] i will give you a little assignment
[1:12:57] because it's taking me off of mine but
[1:13:00] i'm just trying to show something here
[1:13:02] and then when ferrous was born you have
[1:13:04] to know that what took place
[1:13:08] was made of an abominable act
[1:13:12] now you have to you have to also realize
[1:13:16] that judah was prophesied upon the out
[1:13:20] of his lyon would come the king of
[1:13:22] israel
[1:13:25] praise the lord now but
[1:13:28] with this child being born
[1:13:32] it kicks the kingship out
[1:13:36] for 10 generations
[1:13:40] now so take this scripture
[1:13:46] go and read over in ruth
[1:13:49] after boss got married to ruth
[1:13:53] terrance is also called in the lineage
[1:13:56] go and read matthew chapter one you will
[1:13:58] also realize that
[1:14:00] from pharah's and you count down
[1:14:05] david is the 10th generation
[1:14:12] praise the lord what is your homework
[1:14:15] for your bible studies
[1:14:17] but why why i say this is because
[1:14:20] you see something here in the scripture
[1:14:23] and it stumbles you
[1:14:25] praise the lord it looks like it's on
[1:14:28] the back side because you
[1:14:29] it almost like you cannot run it through
[1:14:31] the scripture
[1:14:33] it stumbles you but
[1:14:37] the mystery of that thing is is in the
[1:14:40] it's in the book
[1:14:42] it's not going to come from a theologian
[1:14:44] some word
[1:14:46] it's right in the book it's in the pages
[1:14:48] of the book
[1:14:50] that's what david said in the volume of
[1:14:52] the book
[1:14:53] it's written of me that's speaking about
[1:14:56] jesus
[1:14:57] in the volume of the book
[1:15:01] it's written about me
[1:15:05] i come to do that well oh god amen
[1:15:10] now i just used that example to be able
[1:15:13] to
[1:15:14] help us to see your brother brandon says
[1:15:16] the seal mistreat is on the inside of
[1:15:18] the book
[1:15:20] but then if you read a white house
[1:15:21] rather or the black house rather and
[1:15:23] what mall
[1:15:25] on the outside because it just until
[1:15:29] god can be able to give us an
[1:15:31] understanding
[1:15:32] and important interpretation and show us
[1:15:35] in a scripture
[1:15:36] for us to be able to understand this is
[1:15:39] just on the outside of the book
[1:15:44] are we together
[1:15:47] but the mystery of the whole book
[1:15:52] is in themselves from genesis to
[1:15:54] revelation
[1:15:56] their complete plan of redemption is
[1:15:59] revealed
[1:16:00] in these seals all is an
[1:16:03] important time
[1:16:07] praise the lord he says is an important
[1:16:10] time
[1:16:17] feast of the trumpet he says the seventh
[1:16:20] seals and there
[1:16:21] if i have ever said anything
[1:16:25] that was inspired it was in debt
[1:16:29] there where the angel of the lord met us
[1:16:33] and the bible become an ebook
[1:16:38] there it opens up and reveal
[1:16:43] all the things that the reformers
[1:16:46] and things are left out
[1:16:50] it was the complete revelation of jesus
[1:16:54] christ
[1:16:54] altogether new to us but perfectly
[1:16:58] exactly with the
[1:17:02] scripture
[1:17:05] praise the lord perfectly exactly
[1:17:09] with the scripture that's what brother
[1:17:10] branham said if you cannot run it from
[1:17:13] revelation
[1:17:13] to uh from genesis to revelation just
[1:17:16] leave it alone
[1:17:17] you might not be wrong you might just
[1:17:19] need more grace
[1:17:21] for god to help you
[1:17:26] praise the lord a lot of the financial
[1:17:28] scene that had raising around this
[1:17:30] message
[1:17:31] is because people think that brother
[1:17:33] branham brought us think
[1:17:34] outside of the bible
[1:17:42] praise the lord if there is any teaching
[1:17:45] in this message that is outside of the
[1:17:46] bible
[1:17:47] then that is a cut
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:54] praise the lord
[1:18:01] so the bible being a new book
[1:18:05] is not a slogan that we have
[1:18:08] something extraordinary all we have
[1:18:12] is grace that have come to us
[1:18:17] to make god's word
[1:18:21] plain to our understanding
[1:18:31] are we together glory be to god
[1:18:37] amen amen statue of a perfect man
[1:18:42] he says this now and after we get
[1:18:46] through with the seven seals
[1:18:49] then at the time
[1:18:52] of the sounding of
[1:18:55] the seventh seal or the
[1:18:58] losing i want you to pay attention here
[1:19:01] now
[1:19:02] at the time of the sounding of the seven
[1:19:04] seal all the losing of the seven seal
[1:19:07] cause we know when a seal
[1:19:10] is is to lose
[1:19:15] a ministry
[1:19:18] so actually what is the losing of the
[1:19:21] seals
[1:19:24] the losing of the seals church is
[1:19:26] nothing
[1:19:28] but the releasing of christ
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:34] the christ that was bound by tradition
[1:19:38] and dogmas is now released
[1:19:43] the loosing of the seals is god coming
[1:19:45] from the pages of the bible
[1:19:50] and becoming real to the people
[1:19:57] praise the lord amen
[1:20:00] he says the losing of the seals
[1:20:04] because we know as seal
[1:20:07] is to lose a ministry
[1:20:12] and it's the ministry of jesus christ
[1:20:14] the same yesterday
[1:20:17] today and forever amen
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:24] praise the lord we know that a seal
[1:20:28] is to lose a ministry to lose seven
[1:20:32] seals
[1:20:34] and we will see that right on the chart
[1:20:38] is losing a message
[1:20:43] something that's seal
[1:20:46] up
[1:20:50] praise the lord
[1:20:53] you realize that in revelation chapter 1
[1:20:56] he used the same word
[1:20:58] he they have lose us
[1:21:02] by his own blood
[1:21:07] praise the lord we have to realize that
[1:21:10] the book of revelation is a book of
[1:21:12] symbols
[1:21:20] and god popped those symbols there in
[1:21:23] the book of revelation just to get our
[1:21:25] attention
[1:21:27] the same way he pulled a butch
[1:21:31] on the hill burning with fire but yet
[1:21:34] the leaves are not consumed
[1:21:40] it was only to get the attention of the
[1:21:43] prophet
[1:21:44] it was to get the attention of moses
[1:21:47] that's all it was
[1:21:52] and that's what the symbols in the book
[1:21:54] of revelation
[1:21:55] and therefore is to grab the attention
[1:21:58] of the elect it's for us to pay
[1:22:01] attention
[1:22:06] are we together so you understand that
[1:22:10] the losing of the seal
[1:22:14] that's what makes the bible a new book
[1:22:16] because a release
[1:22:18] christ he's no longer a historical god
[1:22:22] but he's a present tense god the sin
[1:22:25] yesterday
[1:22:26] today and forever
[1:22:32] praise the lord we don't need to go to
[1:22:34] jerusalem to experience him it's good to
[1:22:37] go
[1:22:37] and see the promised land see the tomb
[1:22:40] but jesus christ is here this morning
[1:22:42] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:45] forever
[1:22:50] that's why the loosing of the seals was
[1:22:53] it was to release christ amen praise the
[1:22:56] lord
[1:22:58] amen it was to release christ let me
[1:23:01] let me tap it like this it's just like
[1:23:03] eliza went and picked up rebecca
[1:23:06] and she started telling rebecca
[1:23:08] everything about isaac
[1:23:10] and rebecca was in a sealed car at
[1:23:13] chariot
[1:23:14] and she was bringing rebecca and she
[1:23:16] asked this question how does it look and
[1:23:18] you know they and everything
[1:23:19] and as the chair gets closer she saw a
[1:23:23] man on the field
[1:23:27] the man starts to fit the description
[1:23:29] yes sir or whatever
[1:23:30] is i was saying she pull herself
[1:23:34] together and say hello
[1:23:38] it's that man praise the lord
[1:23:42] when elijah said yes she put down her
[1:23:45] veil
[1:23:47] glory be to god because the picture is
[1:23:50] becoming clearer
[1:23:51] the seal is loosening
[1:23:56] it's no longer picture in your mind but
[1:23:59] the presence you've been told about
[1:24:01] is now becoming real
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:07] she can see his beer
[1:24:09] [Laughter]
[1:24:12] she can see the form of his face she can
[1:24:16] see his physique
[1:24:19] the seal is loosening
[1:24:23] praise the lord and rebecca is going to
[1:24:26] be a new book because the loosening of
[1:24:31] the seals
[1:24:32] make the bible a new book
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:37] praise the lord when god
[1:24:41] takes away the tradition of the church
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:45] and all the fanaticism
[1:24:49] praise the lord all the dogmas
[1:24:53] that have helped us bowed on a legal
[1:24:56] lazy
[1:24:58] when god takes it away it's
[1:25:01] that's what jesus says they were loose
[1:25:05] because a losing is to release a person
[1:25:12] and when the person is loose from sin
[1:25:15] they become a new book all things are
[1:25:17] passed away
[1:25:18] and all things becomes new
[1:25:26] praise the lord amen
[1:25:31] the loosening of the seals the releasing
[1:25:35] of christ
[1:25:36] a ministry has come to declare
[1:25:41] that he is here
[1:25:44] that's why he could preach lift him out
[1:25:47] of history
[1:25:51] amen calling on jesus
[1:25:55] because he's here that's right
[1:26:00] that's exactly right are we together
[1:26:03] are you getting the picture well if i
[1:26:06] disappoint you i'm sorry
[1:26:08] if you think i was going to be pulling
[1:26:10] things you know black cloth and red
[1:26:12] cloth out of my heart i don't have it
[1:26:14] yeah sure come on preach i
[1:26:17] i don't have anything just the word just
[1:26:20] what
[1:26:20] the word of god says
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:22] [Laughter]
[1:26:25] oh praise the lord my goodness
[1:26:30] he says we know what a seal is it's a
[1:26:33] losing
[1:26:34] that's right alpha ministry
[1:26:39] it's a losing of a ministry
[1:26:47] brother bryan said this in the message
[1:26:48] pattern
[1:26:52] oh glory be to god
[1:26:59] he says the pardon is not a pardon
[1:27:03] until unless
[1:27:07] is being accepted as a pattern
[1:27:12] god gave us all things and he give
[1:27:16] us pardon
[1:27:19] it's pardon to those who want to accept
[1:27:22] god's word
[1:27:24] as pardon
[1:27:28] understand this praise the lord
[1:27:32] a pardon is now how much you feel sorry
[1:27:35] for what you did
[1:27:40] it's not how much you feel sorry
[1:27:43] and you regret that is not a pattern
[1:27:50] praise the lord amen
[1:27:54] the parliament is not how much
[1:27:59] the george how he deliberates or how he
[1:28:02] shout what he says or what the preacher
[1:28:05] shot is not the emotion of the preacher
[1:28:10] he says it's a pattern to
[1:28:14] those who want to accept god's
[1:28:18] word anything less than that
[1:28:22] is not a pattern amen
[1:28:26] now what the church says
[1:28:31] now what the doctrine says but what
[1:28:34] god's word says
[1:28:38] a pattern
[1:28:43] those who want to accept
[1:28:48] god's word as a pattern listen to this
[1:28:51] he says
[1:28:52] just to read it it doesn't means
[1:28:56] that you are pardoned amen
[1:28:59] amen just to read it
[1:29:03] and love the reading does it means that
[1:29:07] you are pardoned
[1:29:09] just to narrate and enjoy
[1:29:13] amen it doesn't mean that you are
[1:29:16] pardoned
[1:29:19] you have to embrace it
[1:29:23] you have to accept it you have to
[1:29:24] embrace it
[1:29:27] he said just to read it it doesn't mean
[1:29:29] that you are pardoned
[1:29:31] it means that you have got to accept it
[1:29:35] as your pardon
[1:29:39] that god gave his son to die
[1:29:42] in your state then it's a pardon
[1:29:48] he says a pardon from
[1:29:51] god is there release
[1:29:55] is the same word loose and power don't
[1:29:58] lose you amen a release
[1:30:06] are we together a pattern
[1:30:09] release from guilt
[1:30:14] a release from guilt amen
[1:30:23] so a pattern is an action word
[1:30:28] a pattern has action a pattern has
[1:30:32] effect
[1:30:36] they release you from guilt
[1:30:42] now you realize that i'm trying to
[1:30:45] establish the word
[1:30:47] loose because
[1:30:50] the losing of the seals
[1:30:55] that's what makes the bible a new book
[1:30:58] amen praise the lord
[1:31:02] it's not the sepancy
[1:31:07] it's now water baptism in jesus name
[1:31:11] praise the lord amen
[1:31:18] but the releasing
[1:31:21] of christ
[1:31:25] brother branham said this in the message
[1:31:26] talking
[1:31:28] he says this he says now we notice
[1:31:32] in this that that blossoms being broken
[1:31:37] release god
[1:31:40] amen god was in christ
[1:31:45] reconciling the word to himself
[1:31:49] where no other one could do it
[1:31:54] nothing else could be done
[1:31:57] is taking that holy blood
[1:32:01] himself so he said
[1:32:05] that the blood cells being broken
[1:32:09] when the pierce him in his side
[1:32:15] he said it was the releasing of god
[1:32:21] the fullness of god that was dwelling in
[1:32:23] that body
[1:32:24] is now released to a church
[1:32:31] is now released to a many member body
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:36] so he's no longer a historical god
[1:32:40] he's a present tense god he's a god that
[1:32:43] is living among his people
[1:32:53] praise the lord
[1:32:57] can you can you can you imagine it
[1:33:01] almighty god
[1:33:05] was bound
[1:33:10] almighty god the most powerful god
[1:33:15] strong and mighty in battle but yet he
[1:33:18] was bound
[1:33:20] god was bound because his word was
[1:33:22] broken
[1:33:24] when adam left the word of god
[1:33:28] god was bound he couldn't move because
[1:33:31] his word was broken
[1:33:32] god only had on his word
[1:33:36] he don't act on your emotion you don't
[1:33:38] add on your your
[1:33:39] your your syncrete god add on his word
[1:33:49] feast of the trumpet but branham will
[1:33:51] explain
[1:33:53] how those two thousand thousand demons
[1:33:57] bound the holy spirit
[1:34:02] how how can god be bound do you know
[1:34:07] when you choose to follow your own
[1:34:10] idea
[1:34:14] lean that to your own understanding like
[1:34:16] solomon says
[1:34:19] praise the lord you make god
[1:34:23] powerless because he cannot act in your
[1:34:27] life
[1:34:29] you are having your own way you are
[1:34:30] choosing to do things the way you want
[1:34:32] to do it
[1:34:33] just to please and satisfy your flesh
[1:34:37] god can you god cannot move
[1:34:43] praise the lord
[1:34:47] the desires of the flesh not being
[1:34:49] subject to god
[1:34:50] abounds god
[1:34:55] it bounced god praise the lord
[1:35:01] when people choose to take father son
[1:35:04] and the holy ghost
[1:35:06] for baptising instead of getting down
[1:35:09] and talking to almighty god and saying
[1:35:11] you are my father
[1:35:12] if they're just too to do father son in
[1:35:14] the holy ghost you are bound in god
[1:35:16] you don't expect god to move on man's
[1:35:19] ideas
[1:35:25] you are limiting god
[1:35:30] you are limiting god
[1:35:40] glory be to god and the prophet of god
[1:35:43] said that's the worst thing
[1:35:45] you can do to almighty god
[1:35:50] is to limit him
[1:35:56] i'm telling you there is so much power
[1:36:00] there is so much power
[1:36:03] to change your body send you back to the
[1:36:07] best of your age
[1:36:11] praise the lord there is so much power
[1:36:17] but you see the church holding on to
[1:36:20] creeds
[1:36:22] it's limiting god from moving
[1:36:28] praise the lord see what happened on the
[1:36:31] date of pentecost
[1:36:33] when 120 percent in the upper room
[1:36:37] decided to surround themselves
[1:36:40] in one accord they decided to just
[1:36:44] surround themselves
[1:36:45] abandon their tops
[1:36:49] and just surrounded themselves coming
[1:36:55] no thought coming they did not make no
[1:36:58] plans for the future
[1:37:00] they didn't make no plans no thoughts
[1:37:04] they just surrounded themselves
[1:37:10] and when god's zero down
[1:37:14] when he's zero down for all the base
[1:37:19] because you know what it is the first
[1:37:20] day they got there they all answered say
[1:37:23] oh no expectation
[1:37:25] nothing and the second day
[1:37:28] nothing they sat down and talked well
[1:37:30] are we doing it the way he said we
[1:37:31] should do it
[1:37:32] he said we should gather the promise of
[1:37:34] the father will come and don't you think
[1:37:36] it's just
[1:37:37] and and and they struggled around their
[1:37:39] own ideas
[1:37:40] nothing and the bible says this starts
[1:37:44] to pray
[1:37:45] in one call in one mine
[1:37:51] when that unity of the spirit
[1:37:55] god among the believers were to surround
[1:37:58] himself
[1:37:59] right saying be it unto me now calling
[1:38:03] to your words
[1:38:04] they surround themselves just like jesus
[1:38:08] said
[1:38:08] in in in gethsemane not my will
[1:38:12] but your will be done
[1:38:16] praise the lord those men that were that
[1:38:19] were that was scared to death
[1:38:21] because of what the sahebrush council
[1:38:23] would do to them
[1:38:25] they were scared to death because of the
[1:38:26] roman empire and the roman soldiers
[1:38:30] praise the lord religion and politics
[1:38:33] was joining to come against the church
[1:38:35] they were scared to death but when they
[1:38:37] surrendered themselves to god
[1:38:40] and the holy ghost came praise the lord
[1:38:44] amen they care not for their own life
[1:38:47] they're running to the street
[1:38:48] prophesying singing praising god
[1:38:55] glory be to god and on that day
[1:38:59] the church was born amen that's right
[1:39:03] on that day the church was born
[1:39:07] god bless god release himself
[1:39:11] he released himself
[1:39:14] praise the lord god released himself
[1:39:19] that one time there was only jesus that
[1:39:21] was healing the sick and raising the
[1:39:23] dead
[1:39:23] but god released himself when peter and
[1:39:26] john went by the gate
[1:39:28] called beautiful they said seven and god
[1:39:31] we have none
[1:39:32] but what we have received we give unto
[1:39:35] you
[1:39:38] amen praise
[1:39:49] oh god want to do so much he want to do
[1:39:52] so much with you so much
[1:40:00] but we are allowing our own personal
[1:40:02] ambition
[1:40:04] and own personal things we are
[1:40:06] struggling with
[1:40:08] in our mind if we would just let go
[1:40:13] and let god have his way
[1:40:20] praise the lord he released himself on
[1:40:23] the days of pentecost
[1:40:25] not only to the 12th not only to the
[1:40:29] 12th
[1:40:31] amen not only to the 12
[1:40:41] and there were babies in the upper room
[1:40:43] just like this little baby son thank god
[1:40:45] for the holy ghost
[1:40:49] when god released himself he's
[1:40:52] no respecter of a person
[1:40:56] he's not respected of person
[1:41:00] or age
[1:41:04] he released himself
[1:41:07] a seal
[1:41:11] was broken
[1:41:14] a book was opened
[1:41:19] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:41:20] says if the if the first church of
[1:41:22] pentecost
[1:41:25] who put out a book a book
[1:41:28] was open on that day
[1:41:33] a book written within was open
[1:41:38] amen oh you are a written episode
[1:41:42] amen that is supposed to be read by all
[1:41:45] men
[1:41:47] but many of us are keeping the book
[1:41:49] close
[1:41:51] but i'm telling you almighty god is here
[1:41:54] to break that seal
[1:41:55] to break that suit upon your life
[1:41:58] now your book will be open
[1:42:04] praise the lord that your book will be
[1:42:06] open
[1:42:08] and your neighbors and friends will
[1:42:10] start reading because your book is a new
[1:42:12] book
[1:42:14] all things are passed away behold all
[1:42:17] things
[1:42:17] hallelujah i knew amen
[1:42:24] the losing of the seal makes the bible
[1:42:29] a new book
[1:42:32] are we together so brother branham says
[1:42:35] the blood cell broken
[1:42:36] he says thy release god
[1:42:42] praise the lord
[1:42:46] the presence of god unrecognized brother
[1:42:48] branham says
[1:42:49] but you see the tradition
[1:42:52] had got him cut down
[1:42:57] todd down that's the way it
[1:43:00] is today if he did have only been
[1:43:05] taught right
[1:43:09] if a man had would have believed what
[1:43:12] the scripture
[1:43:13] has said but his tradition
[1:43:17] got him off of it
[1:43:20] his tradition got him off
[1:43:24] of the scripture praise the lord
[1:43:28] when jesus came he says the scripture
[1:43:33] but it's what they have spoken of me
[1:43:37] and i will say the same thing if god has
[1:43:39] brought us the ministry of jesus christ
[1:43:42] then search the scripture young people
[1:43:45] search the scripture because if you
[1:43:47] don't search the scripture
[1:43:49] you'll misinterpret what brother branham
[1:43:50] said
[1:43:56] when jesus resurrected and he met those
[1:44:00] men on the road of immigrants
[1:44:03] the bible says from the psalm and the
[1:44:05] prophets
[1:44:07] he took them through the scripture
[1:44:12] he took them through the scripture
[1:44:16] and he opened the scripture to their
[1:44:18] understanding
[1:44:24] praise the lord people come around the
[1:44:28] message
[1:44:29] they are just screaming to understand
[1:44:30] mystery
[1:44:32] they want to understand the seals they
[1:44:34] want to know the bridge
[1:44:36] what is this bridge they are just
[1:44:38] streaming out
[1:44:41] for mystery
[1:44:48] just asked him
[1:44:51] what is john 3 16
[1:44:55] praise the lord
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:08] praise the lord
[1:45:11] they are just streaming out they want to
[1:45:13] understand what is worse down here
[1:45:15] seventh a week they want to understand
[1:45:16] you know while
[1:45:17] uh and they're just out you know that
[1:45:20] the
[1:45:20] the thing about it did is that people we
[1:45:23] we have to
[1:45:24] you know i like i said and i continue to
[1:45:27] say this thing because it's just my own
[1:45:30] personal
[1:45:30] thing that the way i see it you know
[1:45:32] people gets disappointed
[1:45:35] they get disappointed because when
[1:45:37] brother branham talked about a quick a
[1:45:38] short quick work
[1:45:39] and brother branham talked about missing
[1:45:41] ling would be restored and brother brown
[1:45:42] talk about
[1:45:43] how the dynamics of this church is and
[1:45:45] how important of the holy ghost
[1:45:47] we put all of those things into mental
[1:45:50] conception
[1:45:53] and we start to reason it out
[1:45:56] instead of just falling in love with god
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:01] instead of just loving god and loving
[1:46:04] his word
[1:46:06] amen we start to work out things in our
[1:46:10] mind
[1:46:11] pretty soon we are putting we are
[1:46:13] putting our
[1:46:14] dates to events verb said this so when
[1:46:17] by this time they're supposed to happen
[1:46:19] and pretty soon we get ourselves in
[1:46:24] trouble
[1:46:30] instead of just falling in love with god
[1:46:33] amen
[1:46:37] god interpret his word
[1:46:40] by bringing it to pass
[1:46:45] that's what we were taught god interpret
[1:46:48] his word
[1:46:50] by bringing it to pass
[1:46:59] but abraham says his tradition got him
[1:47:01] off of it
[1:47:03] seem it is today people will take
[1:47:06] the real gospel where the holy ghost is
[1:47:09] coming
[1:47:10] in and the power and the glory of god
[1:47:13] releasing sinners from sin
[1:47:17] and making them free and and baptizing
[1:47:21] them
[1:47:21] in the holocaust and healing the sick
[1:47:24] and showing signs and wonder
[1:47:26] and people will walk away
[1:47:30] they will walk away praise the lord
[1:47:36] because they want this classical church
[1:47:38] of entertainment
[1:47:42] they want to be entertained by the choir
[1:47:45] in purple rob
[1:47:47] with a pop organ
[1:47:52] they want to be entertained
[1:47:55] god is not here to entertain you god is
[1:47:58] here to release himself in you
[1:48:04] because he wants sons and daughters
[1:48:07] he's looking for hands that he can use
[1:48:10] he's looking for feet that he can use
[1:48:13] he's looking for mouth that he can use
[1:48:16] he's not here to entertain you
[1:48:20] he's not here to have you sit back
[1:48:24] crank yourself in the chair blow
[1:48:26] yourself with fan no
[1:48:27] he want to make you hot in your seat he
[1:48:32] want to make the seat so hot for you
[1:48:36] praise the lord
[1:48:41] glory be to god where brandon says
[1:48:46] they will leave that
[1:48:51] because that's what their church believe
[1:48:56] praise the lord oh my goodness
[1:49:02] oh my goodness are we together
[1:49:11] the releasing of the seal
[1:49:14] so we understand that the loosing of the
[1:49:18] seal
[1:49:19] is god releasing himself
[1:49:23] praise the lord is god
[1:49:26] releasing himself out of the pages of
[1:49:29] his word
[1:49:32] to become personal in our life
[1:49:37] praise the lord you can seek for
[1:49:39] understanding
[1:49:41] you can seek for i mean
[1:49:44] revelation that will move your spine in
[1:49:47] your back
[1:49:48] but if god is not personal to you
[1:49:52] your revelation will not last
[1:49:56] if god has not come from the pages of
[1:49:59] his word
[1:50:02] if he's not personal to you
[1:50:05] your revelation will not take you across
[1:50:08] the street
[1:50:19] now watch see what brother branham says
[1:50:20] here junction of time
[1:50:25] brother brandon preached this message
[1:50:28] he was trying to place the church
[1:50:35] describing his final junction
[1:50:39] that we have come to he says god
[1:50:43] said so in the bible jesus said
[1:50:46] before noah's time at the end they were
[1:50:49] marrying and giving in marriages
[1:50:54] how a great turmeric
[1:50:58] is in the world today and we realize
[1:51:01] that one thing that caused that
[1:51:06] the bible said that the spirit great
[1:51:09] spirit came down evil spirit
[1:51:13] and got into these people
[1:51:17] and done these things evil spirit
[1:51:20] influenced them
[1:51:23] a time where spirit is impressing
[1:51:27] himself
[1:51:29] on the earth using whatever medium
[1:51:33] it can
[1:51:37] that's the reason why we have to guide
[1:51:38] our spirit
[1:51:42] like i said wednesday night we have to
[1:51:45] guide our spirit
[1:51:49] he said and we see
[1:51:54] the same evil spirit working in our day
[1:51:57] and now notice again that not only that
[1:52:03] when all hell turned loose
[1:52:07] he said all heaven
[1:52:10] turned loose also when the enemy coming
[1:52:17] as a flaw
[1:52:18] the spirit of god raised up a standard
[1:52:21] against it
[1:52:23] he says these two forces has
[1:52:26] always show at the junction
[1:52:30] at every junction
[1:52:35] that's a depressing spirit that have us
[1:52:38] over the world
[1:52:42] i want to keep the minds and the spirit
[1:52:44] of men
[1:52:45] to be depressed we sit in church
[1:52:49] and nothing of god seems real to us
[1:52:54] because we have built
[1:52:57] false expectation
[1:53:01] praise the lord instead of just
[1:53:04] simply faking god at his word
[1:53:10] and say lord i love you amen praise the
[1:53:13] lord
[1:53:14] amen
[1:53:20] depressing spirit comes down and in that
[1:53:23] same time
[1:53:25] right the spirit of god is raising up
[1:53:29] extended amen
[1:53:32] praise the lord now he goes ahead
[1:53:37] he describes the spirit that is
[1:53:40] impressing himself
[1:53:42] upon man influencing
[1:53:45] the way they think the way they dress
[1:53:48] and all the things that is happening
[1:53:52] unnatural man without the spirit of god
[1:53:55] and you go ahead he says all the
[1:53:58] prophets
[1:54:00] in the same junction of time he says all
[1:54:03] the prophets
[1:54:05] and the samples point saying
[1:54:08] this they the angels will appear
[1:54:13] prophets will arise signs and wonders
[1:54:20] and if god did that for those
[1:54:24] little junction back day yes sir
[1:54:27] what will he do now when
[1:54:30] all hell is turned loose
[1:54:36] praise the lord all hell is turned loose
[1:54:40] hell being released
[1:54:44] he says the lead is ticking out of hell
[1:54:47] and demons
[1:54:48] are streaming out to the people
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:58] praise the lord
[1:55:02] when all hell is turned loose he said
[1:55:04] all heaven
[1:55:05] will turn loose angels appearing
[1:55:09] signs and wonders on the earth
[1:55:14] the count of faith arising god
[1:55:18] proving which is right and wrong
[1:55:24] praise the lord now see brother branham
[1:55:27] said this back in 1954
[1:55:30] junction of time he says all
[1:55:33] the prophets all the scripture pointing
[1:55:36] to a time where
[1:55:39] joy said i poured out my spirit in those
[1:55:42] last days
[1:55:44] he says all pointing to that time signs
[1:55:46] and wonders
[1:55:47] angels will appear glory be to god
[1:55:51] he says god started his church he
[1:55:54] initiated his church
[1:55:56] with the visitation of angels when the
[1:55:58] church started in the book of
[1:56:00] us we know the angels visited peter in

[1:58:17] lord
[1:58:18] but let me let me let me let me help you
[1:58:20] you will have to realize that
[1:58:23] that was on the
[1:58:26] the first port

[1:58:38] dedicated his prophet all of the first
[1:58:41] port

[1:58:47] and then when the word was opened which
[1:58:50] is the temple
[1:58:52] god also vindicated
[1:58:57] now only the prophet he vindicated the
[1:58:59] bride

[1:59:12] continue
[1:59:14] i'll leave you right in there he
[1:59:16] dedicated
[1:59:18] the bride the opening of the word the
[1:59:21] loosing of christ
[1:59:26] by seven angels praise the lord
[1:59:30] when brother brandon preached a message
[1:59:32] influenced
[1:59:33] all this influence series he read isaiah
[1:59:37] chapter 6
[1:59:38] to show how angels influenced the
[1:59:42] prophet isaiah ministry
[1:59:44] when isaiah came out of that experience
[1:59:47] with the angel
[1:59:48] his ministry was not the same amen
[1:59:51] amen amen amen
[1:59:58] the prophet god emphasis was we are
[2:00:02] under
[2:00:02] the influence of angelic pain
[2:00:07] we are under the influence of angelic
[2:00:11] being yes
[2:00:12] sir we have access to jacob ladders
[2:00:15] because angels are ascending and
[2:00:18] descending
[2:00:19] praise the lord that's the reason why
[2:00:22] all things are possible
[2:00:23] to them that believe we have a quick
[2:00:26] access to the throne of god
[2:00:29] because angers are ascending and
[2:00:32] descending
[2:00:33] amen praise the lord that's the reason
[2:00:36] why don't allow the church
[2:00:38] to bow you down amen

[2:01:17] make the bible a new book god
[2:01:22] has been released that's right
[2:01:26] and when he released himself all we can
[2:01:27] do just embrace him
[2:01:29] [Laughter]
[2:01:32] all we can do we just embrace him
[2:01:36] that's why the scripture says
[2:01:40] when there is a chariot
[2:01:43] arrived rebecca could hold herself no
[2:01:46] longer
[2:01:48] she leaped out of the chair right into
[2:01:51] his bosom
[2:01:54] amen she was released
[2:01:57] she was loose a seal was broken
[2:02:01] a new book was open

[2:02:06] far end
[2:02:09] god want to break the seals of your life
[2:02:13] because you are a written episode
[2:02:16] so man can read what is written in your
[2:02:18] life that he having sons and daughters
[2:02:21] of god
[2:02:22] young people that can stand for god and
[2:02:24] turn their back on the under the sinful
[2:02:26] word
[2:02:29] it's there it's there
[2:02:32] written within
[2:02:36] written within brother branham says god
[2:02:39] watch over you for four generations
[2:02:42] before you could get down here four
[2:02:45] generations
[2:02:46] he watched over you
[2:02:50] preparing you for this day and age
[2:02:53] that devil is no match to you praise the
[2:02:56] lord
[2:02:57] don't allow him to boss you into a
[2:02:59] corner amen
[2:03:01] there is something down within that you
[2:03:04] can say greater is he that is in me
[2:03:06] than he that is in the word
[2:03:11] praise the lord
[2:03:15] glory be to god he's been taking the
[2:03:17] lair off
[2:03:19] little by little yeah and every time he
[2:03:22] takes it off
[2:03:23] he says wow your life has changed why
[2:03:26] are you not coming to the party anymore
[2:03:30] then another seal is broken praise the
[2:03:33] lord
[2:03:34] you that never use the law of church
[2:03:36] starting to love church
[2:03:37] then another seal is broken you just
[2:03:40] love the present of god
[2:03:42] you like you like daniel you open your
[2:03:44] window why don't you left for your hands
[2:03:46] and you pray
[2:03:48] glory be to god and then he takes
[2:03:51] another layer off
[2:03:52] when you don't read the bible it looks
[2:03:54] like something has happened
[2:03:56] it looks like you lost something god
[2:03:59] taking
[2:03:59] the layers off your life little by
[2:04:01] little
[2:04:03] because there is something written
[2:04:04] within that's been sealed
[2:04:10] that's been locked up yes sir
[2:04:14] with all the cells that came down from
[2:04:16] your grandfather and all of that
[2:04:22] that's why science science call it a
[2:04:24] cell it's a cell that is keeping the
[2:04:26] original you

[2:04:32] you from being revealed
[2:04:36] you are healing behind those cells

[2:05:07] verbum says when the eyes were open he
[2:05:09] says when all important speaks
[2:05:13] he said miracles happen praise the lord
[2:05:17] you believe that only putting speaks at
[2:05:20] every junction
[2:05:23] and when the church cooled off
[2:05:28] cooled off like nothing is happening
[2:05:33] and people start to see nothing
[2:05:36] happening around the message
[2:05:38] when the church cool off like
