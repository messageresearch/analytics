[57:36] so the reading goes wuha believe our
[57:38] report
[57:39] and to whom is the arm of the law reveal
[57:58] he is despised and rejected of man a man
[58:01] of sorrow
[58:02] and acquainted with grief and we hate as
[58:05] it were our faces from him
[58:07] he was despised and we estimated
[58:22] but he was wounded for our transgression
[58:24] he was bruised for our iniquity
[58:27] the testament of our peace was upon him
[58:30] and with his tribes
[58:32] we are healed
[58:44] he was oppressed and was afflicted yet
[58:47] he opened at his mouth
[58:48] he was brought as a lamb to the
[58:51] slaughter
[58:52] and as a sheep before the sheriff is
[58:54] doomed
[58:55] so he opened that his mouth
[59:12] and he made his grave with the wicked
[59:15] and waved the rich in his death because
[59:19] he have done no violence neither was
[59:22] any deceit in his mouth
[59:42] he shall see all the travail of
[59:46] his sword and shall be satisfied by his
[59:49] knowledge i mean in roger 7 justified
[59:54] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[59:56] seven justify
[59:57] many for he shall bear their iniquity
[1:00:06] and shut the divided spoils with the
[1:00:08] strong
[1:00:09] because they pour out his sword unto
[1:00:12] death
[1:00:13] and have numbered him with the
[1:00:14] transgressor and he beared his sins of
[1:00:17] many and made a transfer
[1:00:21] praise the lord are we grateful that we
[1:00:23] can identify ourselves with every one of
[1:00:25] these verses
[1:00:27] praise the lord amen let's pray together
[1:00:29] heavenly father
[1:00:30] dear lord as we slowly go into
[1:00:34] this year easter a commemoration of your
[1:00:37] death burial
[1:00:37] and resurrection oh god we want to
[1:00:41] identify ourselves with each line
[1:00:44] each verse every word that is written in
[1:00:47] this chapter lord
[1:00:49] because father there is not one of us
[1:00:52] here
[1:00:53] that i spare from what you did on
[1:00:56] calvary
[1:00:57] and oh god we pray that this easter will
[1:01:00] be
[1:01:01] a different easter for us lord that you
[1:01:03] will
[1:01:04] give us a restoration in our heart the
[1:01:07] raising christ will be more real to us
[1:01:10] than ever before father we love you
[1:01:13] we appreciate you father in jesus name
[1:01:16] we pray
[1:01:17] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:01:19] your seed
[1:01:22] this morning reading from this chapter i
[1:01:24] was going to preach on the message the
[1:01:26] answer to the same question
[1:01:29] but i couldn't get away from this
[1:01:32] thought of the pleasure of the lord this
[1:01:35] as the scripture says the pleasure of
[1:01:37] the lord
[1:01:39] prosper in his hands
[1:01:42] praise the lord you think about it the
[1:01:45] pleasure of the lord
[1:01:47] prosper in his hands
[1:01:51] god has had pleasure in dealing
[1:01:54] with different people it's the pleasure
[1:01:57] of the lord for
[1:01:58] for you to be here this morning i
[1:02:00] believe that god god pleasure
[1:02:02] out of your singing this morning amen
[1:02:04] praise the lord are you glad to know
[1:02:06] that
[1:02:08] that he got pleasure out of your singing
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] i believe so that he gets pleasure out
[1:02:14] of our worship
[1:02:16] if not he won't come down and inhabit
[1:02:19] our praise
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:26] but the scripture speaks here
[1:02:29] of this man and says the pleasure of the
[1:02:33] lord
[1:02:34] we prosper in his hands
[1:02:38] glory be to god amen
[1:02:42] the pleasure of the lord will prosper
[1:02:46] in his hands
[1:02:50] now this word pleasure
[1:02:53] is uh it's a very wonderful word
[1:02:57] word and uh
[1:03:05] and it holds
[1:03:08] it holds a lot of
[1:03:11] a lot of truth it holds
[1:03:16] a wholesome mystery let me see that way
[1:03:18] it holds a secret
[1:03:20] it holds god's secret concerning you and
[1:03:23] myself
[1:03:25] amen let's look at
[1:03:28] uh uh
[1:03:32] revelation chapter four let's look at
[1:03:35] revelation chapter four
[1:03:37] maybe we can we can give ourselves a
[1:03:41] jump stat here
[1:03:43] a kickoff here to be able to understand
[1:03:45] where we want to go
[1:03:46] how we want to travel this uh this
[1:03:49] morning
[1:03:53] praise the lord
[1:03:57] now in the setting of revelation chapter
[1:03:59] 4
[1:04:01] john has just got out of
[1:04:04] the the church ages not completely out
[1:04:08] but he have heard a voice
[1:04:11] that have caught called him up higher
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:14] for him to come up higher so uh
[1:04:18] uh but as as we will look down here this
[1:04:21] is this is
[1:04:21] a scripture that is very familiar with
[1:04:24] us
[1:04:24] and that is the last scripture
[1:04:27] the last verse sorry thou are worthy o
[1:04:31] lord
[1:04:32] to receive glory and honor and
[1:04:35] power for thou have created
[1:04:39] all things and
[1:04:42] for thy pleasure
[1:04:46] they are and where
[1:04:50] created thou have created
[1:04:54] all things and for your pleasure
[1:04:58] so that word holds a mystery it holds a
[1:05:01] secret
[1:05:02] that god make you for his
[1:05:07] and when something is for your pleasure
[1:05:10] you do with
[1:05:11] it as you please
[1:05:17] amen you do with it
[1:05:20] as you please but here is the 10 year
[1:05:24] isaiah said that
[1:05:27] this man jehovah 7
[1:05:31] he will be the man word the pleasure of
[1:05:35] the lord
[1:05:36] will prosper
[1:05:39] in his hands praise the lord
[1:05:46] which means he will be a man dead
[1:05:50] from the dead of his birth the way he
[1:05:53] was born and how he was born and where
[1:05:55] he was born
[1:05:56] and all of the things that surrounding
[1:05:58] his birth
[1:06:00] to uh to the day he would hang on
[1:06:04] the cross where he would give his sword
[1:06:06] as an offering
[1:06:08] every aspect of his life
[1:06:12] will be to god's pleasure
[1:06:16] i believe you and myself we are made for
[1:06:18] the pleasure of the lord but not every
[1:06:20] aspect of our life
[1:06:22] is actually his pleasure i believe that
[1:06:25] we now seek more of our pleasure than
[1:06:28] his pleasure
[1:06:30] amen we love to come to church on sunday
[1:06:33] and
[1:06:34] you know sing and praise the lord have
[1:06:36] him to get a little bit of a pleasure
[1:06:38] out of us and monday we have our own
[1:06:40] program our own routine and our own
[1:06:42] things to do
[1:06:43] we want to make sure that we get it done
[1:06:45] and then if there is some few left
[1:06:47] hours that we retire we get on our knees
[1:06:49] to pray then
[1:06:50] and you know and just give him a little
[1:06:52] bit of a time but this man
[1:06:55] jehovah seven this
[1:06:58] man
[1:07:02] the pleasure of the lord will prosper
[1:07:06] in his hands
[1:07:10] glory be to god amen
[1:07:14] the pleasure of the lord will prosper
[1:07:18] in his hands
[1:07:21] now so having having a little background
[1:07:24] that uh that we have we have just
[1:07:28] shared with you and we have looked at i
[1:07:30] want us to also look at some few things
[1:07:32] before we really get into
[1:07:34] looking at our subject i'm going to turn
[1:07:36] the wheels over to you amen
[1:07:39] praise the lord i'm going to turn the
[1:07:41] wheels over to you
[1:07:43] so you can drive the service the way you
[1:07:45] want you want us to go
[1:07:47] praise the lord let me just get my
[1:07:49] bearing put my seatbelt on
[1:07:52] i think i need to put a helmet last time
[1:07:54] i got a headache out of here
[1:07:56] so praise the lord
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:08] now if you look at the word pleasure in
[1:08:11] this
[1:08:12] meaning it actually comes from a word
[1:08:17] it is they actually come out of the word
[1:08:19] please
[1:08:22] the word pleasure comes from out of the
[1:08:24] word place whatever you are having
[1:08:26] pleasure and you are pleased with it
[1:08:30] okay so the word pleasure comes
[1:08:33] out of the word place but you know uh
[1:08:36] uh scarlett's
[1:08:40] kind of for respected uh
[1:08:44] uh isaiah in his style of writing
[1:08:48] there was something i wanted to to
[1:08:51] mention
[1:08:52] i wanted to mention from the message
[1:08:55] that was playing this morning
[1:08:57] uh yeah i think i took it
[1:09:00] if if there is any way that
[1:09:04] i will our beloved sign uh sound tech
[1:09:07] can be able to put paragraph 36
[1:09:11] from the message that was playing this
[1:09:13] morning
[1:09:15] paragraph 36 i think so i was listening
[1:09:20] to that and something caught my eye
[1:09:22] i wanted to share that with you
[1:09:27] and uh
[1:09:33] if they can be able to get it and try it
[1:09:36] out for us
[1:09:36] and we can we can talk about that and
[1:09:38] then we can go on our way
[1:09:42] i'm sure that was in paragraph 36 if i
[1:09:45] do remember
[1:09:47] i said to myself i was going to copy it
[1:09:50] in
[1:09:50] and give it to them but i forgot
[1:09:53] until i mentioned scalas so if you if
[1:09:56] you look in isaiah chapter 53 let's be
[1:09:59] talking while
[1:10:00] they look of that isaiah chapter 53 you
[1:10:03] get down to verse 10
[1:10:06] where actually uh isaiah talks about
[1:10:11] the pleasure of the lord shall prosper
[1:10:13] in his hands
[1:10:15] if you look at the beginning uh
[1:10:19] if you look at the beginning of uh
[1:10:23] of how he started that verse yet
[1:10:26] it pleased the lord okay i think uh
[1:10:30] uh the
[1:10:34] uh sound people are there the different
[1:10:36] ones
[1:10:37] figure out and they have uh
[1:10:41] i was reading that and uh
[1:10:45] 20th century okay let's go down a little
[1:10:48] bit
[1:10:50] now what the what i want to refer to in
[1:10:53] this
[1:10:54] in this paragraph and in
[1:10:57] sequence of paragraph down you will see
[1:11:00] that
[1:11:01] in that paragraph brother branham is
[1:11:04] is is describing how he was studying
[1:11:07] for for 70 weeks
[1:11:11] and then he goes down
[1:11:14] and then he mentioned different books
[1:11:17] that he was looking into and he
[1:11:20] mentioned
[1:11:22] lickings and
[1:11:26] and it's strange enough that people
[1:11:31] are saying that brother branham copied
[1:11:34] from lickings
[1:11:36] he uh pressurized
[1:11:39] that's that's what he accused him of the
[1:11:41] brother brandon pressurized
[1:11:43] lakins when he taught on the on the
[1:11:46] seals
[1:11:47] and taught on the church ages
[1:11:51] so when i heard that on the tip this
[1:11:52] morning i says what i think i need to
[1:11:54] teach my church a little bit
[1:11:56] that you will not get confused with
[1:11:57] those things
[1:11:59] praise the lord you go in brother
[1:12:02] branham library in in
[1:12:04] in tucson i have not been there but uh
[1:12:07] i i i've seen the you know a video of
[1:12:11] his books that he have
[1:12:13] you know brother branham has a lot of
[1:12:14] books on his shelf
[1:12:16] and brother branham and brother
[1:12:17] mentioned that brother branham also had
[1:12:19] brother
[1:12:20] leikin's book which of course i bought a
[1:12:23] copy of that book i had it on my shelf a
[1:12:25] brother came in
[1:12:26] and asked me for it and then i bought
[1:12:29] another one
[1:12:34] and uh you see so the thing about it did
[1:12:38] is that uh
[1:12:40] uh he was a man of very poor education
[1:12:44] we know his background and we're not
[1:12:47] justifying that for any reason amen if
[1:12:50] you're having the opportunity to go to
[1:12:51] school go
[1:12:52] to school praise the lord his father was
[1:12:55] a drunken
[1:12:56] could not afford to send all his
[1:12:58] children to school so
[1:12:59] brother branham had to leave because he
[1:13:01] was the first boy
[1:13:02] first born so he had to leave and start
[1:13:05] going to hunting to support the family
[1:13:07] because the father was drunk and
[1:13:08] gambling and going in you know and
[1:13:11] by the way of his life so he had to step
[1:13:13] up at a young age
[1:13:15] but he was a man
[1:13:19] that availed himself
[1:13:23] in studying in reading he reads whatever
[1:13:28] he comes his way praise the lord
[1:13:33] many people think that everything
[1:13:35] brother brandon preach god give him a
[1:13:36] vision about it
[1:13:38] it's it's it's not right that's not true
[1:13:44] brother branham steady
[1:13:49] he steady because paul said steady to
[1:13:52] show yourself
[1:13:53] approved
[1:13:57] so he was reading things he was
[1:14:00] gathering
[1:14:01] information
[1:14:05] but you see you just don't follow the
[1:14:08] the commentators and things that people
[1:14:10] have
[1:14:10] up there because everybody is sharing
[1:14:12] their life and idea
[1:14:17] when he first preached the church ages
[1:14:20] the single copy the first time he
[1:14:21] preached
[1:14:22] in 1950s he preached it from what he
[1:14:25] gathered from the seven day advantage
[1:14:28] book
[1:14:32] so when he was when he was planning to
[1:14:35] to to preach
[1:14:36] and teach on the set on the seventh week
[1:14:39] of daniel the church ages and
[1:14:40] even the seals he was studying he was
[1:14:43] looking at materials
[1:14:46] but the holy ghost will always help him
[1:14:50] when that information was not right
[1:14:53] so he was not just bringing men's
[1:14:55] knowledge to us
[1:14:56] but he was bringing an inspiration of
[1:14:59] the almighty
[1:15:01] praise the lord and this man these men
[1:15:05] this man that wrote this books they were
[1:15:08] not just
[1:15:09] people that were writing because they
[1:15:13] wanted money
[1:15:15] no they were men that god gave
[1:15:19] insight now there is something that you
[1:15:22] have to
[1:15:23] understand about the church ages
[1:15:29] the sixth church age is called the man's
[1:15:32] age
[1:15:34] which is the philadelphia church age
[1:15:38] and you will realize that that was the
[1:15:41] age the age that is called the open door
[1:15:45] that was the age where
[1:15:49] uh uh christianity
[1:15:53] i would say put out his
[1:15:57] best writers
[1:16:05] you talk about uh uh uh uh
[1:16:08] john wesley you talked about uh uh the
[1:16:11] prince of preachers
[1:16:13] uh uh charles poggin you talked about uh
[1:16:16] all of those men they were blessed
[1:16:18] because that was their age
[1:16:20] it was the man's age so god anointed men
[1:16:24] with wisdom they had insights to
[1:16:27] look into the scriptures look into signs
[1:16:30] look into different things and bring us
[1:16:33] an understanding
[1:16:35] now the seventh church age messenger was
[1:16:38] going to take the loose ends
[1:16:40] of all of those truths
[1:16:45] all of those truths
[1:16:48] and bring it back together
[1:16:52] that's why brother branham says the
[1:16:54] seven seals was not going to be
[1:16:57] something out of the bible
[1:17:00] it was not going to be a flying
[1:17:02] information
[1:17:09] but i just wanted to tell you that you
[1:17:12] know brother brown was accused of
[1:17:13] pressurizing
[1:17:15] and then this is not the only place that
[1:17:17] he said it
[1:17:19] he was he'll tell you over and over i
[1:17:21] was looking into
[1:17:23] lincoln's book i was looking into his
[1:17:25] coffee box and
[1:17:26] and a lot of places you know what he
[1:17:29] says i have
[1:17:30] i was just reading the commentary and i
[1:17:31] love what what the commentator says
[1:17:39] praise the lord
[1:17:45] strange sometimes when people see you
[1:17:47] reading some material you think that
[1:17:49] you're trying to know better than the
[1:17:51] prophet no
[1:17:53] as a preacher you have to be informed
[1:17:58] you have to be informed
[1:18:06] what was i preaching praise the lord
[1:18:10] okay so i just wanted to bring that
[1:18:11] information to you so
[1:18:13] you can go and do your own research on
[1:18:15] it you'll find a lot of places that very
[1:18:17] brandon make
[1:18:18] comment on different men you know
[1:18:20] different men
[1:18:22] and i love them i've sought out those
[1:18:23] things for years now so
[1:18:26] uh you know and so those things
[1:18:29] uh those accusations don't hold water
[1:18:32] you know
[1:18:33] they don't hold they can't hold it they
[1:18:35] praise the lord
[1:18:36] amen because if he were pressurizing he
[1:18:41] would not mention
[1:18:42] that i have been reading
[1:18:46] pressurizing is to take somebody's
[1:18:48] information and don't make mention of
[1:18:50] their name
[1:18:54] but if you tell somebody that i've been
[1:18:56] reading the book that this sister right
[1:18:57] or this brother wrote
[1:18:59] then how can you say i'm pressurizing
[1:19:08] okay let's get back to to business
[1:19:11] club be to god amen
[1:19:17] let's get back to business it's time for
[1:19:21] business i love business
[1:19:25] amen glory be to god
[1:19:30] amen amen so as i have said yet in
[1:19:34] isaiah chapter 53 verse
[1:19:36] 10 yet it pleased the lord
[1:19:39] to bruise him
[1:19:42] he used the word a please
[1:19:46] he pleased the lord to produce him
[1:19:50] amen
[1:19:55] he have put him to grief when thou shalt
[1:19:58] make his soul
[1:19:59] an offering for sin he shall
[1:20:02] see his seat prolong his days and then
[1:20:05] the pleasure of the lord
[1:20:07] that was going to be the climax
[1:20:13] the climax so you think about it now
[1:20:17] if we were made for his pleasure
[1:20:21] if he made us for his pleasure in his
[1:20:23] mind
[1:20:24] that he will have a people that will be
[1:20:27] for his pleasure
[1:20:30] god had to provide
[1:20:33] he got he had to to to give a provision
[1:20:37] he had to make a provision
[1:20:39] that will not partially redeem
[1:20:43] us back you have to make a provision
[1:20:48] that will completely redeem us back
[1:20:51] because we were made for his pleasure
[1:20:53] so if there is something that came and
[1:20:55] took us away from his pleasure
[1:20:58] he had to provide something enough
[1:21:03] that is going to completely bring us
[1:21:06] back
[1:21:07] to his pleasure praise the lord
[1:21:12] amen yeah you can have all the time
[1:21:16] you want to have for yourself here
[1:21:20] when you get there there is no time for
[1:21:22] you
[1:21:25] hey amen you can have all the time go
[1:21:27] and shopping
[1:21:29] go and browse go and you know and
[1:21:34] when you get there it's going to be just
[1:21:36] all the time for him
[1:21:38] [Laughter]
[1:21:41] praise the lord amen
[1:21:45] glory be to god what a wonderful jesus
[1:21:49] we serve
[1:21:50] praise the lord amen
[1:21:54] so it please the lord
[1:21:57] he pleased the lord a couple of years
[1:22:01] back i was listening to a radio
[1:22:03] programming
[1:22:04] and uh and it was
[1:22:07] it was around easter and someone was
[1:22:10] referring to this
[1:22:11] and says uh you know it was
[1:22:14] that this this kind of a scripture is so
[1:22:18] is so uh it's so not
[1:22:21] right i mean there's a better way to
[1:22:23] place it because i mean
[1:22:25] you just please the lord to bruise him
[1:22:27] it looks like god was so pleased
[1:22:29] it sounds like a child abuse
[1:22:35] praise the lord i said in my heart as i
[1:22:38] was driving
[1:22:39] i said what a shame i said what a shame
[1:22:42] that christianity has come to
[1:22:44] if we only know the price that was paid
[1:22:48] it couldn't have been nothing less than
[1:22:51] what god was pleased with
[1:22:53] nothing will satisfy him
[1:22:58] then what he was pleased with
[1:23:03] so god make us
[1:23:07] so we can please him
[1:23:12] that's what we are made for so we can
[1:23:15] please him
[1:23:16] and you see it in the scripture you look
[1:23:18] at job
[1:23:20] in his trials
[1:23:25] god and sit on how to talk
[1:23:28] what job is having his his life
[1:23:31] you know enjoying his farm his cuddles
[1:23:34] and making sacrifices
[1:23:37] and it please god to say
[1:23:40] there is no man like job
[1:23:47] god was so pleased to say there is no
[1:23:51] man
[1:23:53] have you have you considered my seventh
[1:23:55] job
[1:23:57] god was so pleased to take him
[1:24:02] through that it pleased the lord
[1:24:07] to burn his farm down and please the
[1:24:09] lord
[1:24:12] now all his children gets killed
[1:24:16] praise the lord amen
[1:24:26] and god was so pleased that that man
[1:24:29] that lived a righteous life would break
[1:24:32] all over his body in bombs he couldn't
[1:24:35] understand what what have i done
[1:24:38] where did i miss the my whether that
[1:24:40] went wrong
[1:24:42] but it was not about him
[1:24:45] it was about a god that takes pleasure
[1:24:49] in the things that he allows in our
[1:24:51] lives
[1:24:55] god take pleasure in the things
[1:25:00] if he watched over you nine months in
[1:25:03] the war
[1:25:04] and he watched over you from birth
[1:25:08] until you get to that age where he says
[1:25:10] now i'm going to have pleasure with this
[1:25:12] child
[1:25:15] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:25:19] because you were made for his pleasure
[1:25:28] the reason why we cry in trials is
[1:25:32] because
[1:25:33] it's not our pleasure trial is never our
[1:25:37] pleasure
[1:25:39] praise the lord amen i always say that
[1:25:43] you find people
[1:25:44] when they are testifying after they have
[1:25:47] gone through their trial
[1:25:49] i trusted the lord i believed god i was
[1:25:53] holding
[1:25:54] on even though it was difficult i was
[1:25:56] holding on
[1:25:57] as if to say they were doing it
[1:26:01] complaining frowning
[1:26:04] go why me why me why me
[1:26:11] praise the lord let me tell you during
[1:26:13] my trials
[1:26:15] you couldn't go through it
[1:26:22] praise the lord amen
[1:26:28] glory be to god amen moses
[1:26:32] grew up
[1:26:36] was born the proper child the bible says
[1:26:39] grew up in the house of pharaoh in the
[1:26:41] palace
[1:26:42] he was a prince praise the lord
[1:26:48] he got to the age of 40 years old
[1:26:54] and then he pleased the lord
[1:26:58] that moses should forsake everything in
[1:27:02] egypt
[1:27:04] go back to the back side of the desert
[1:27:05] it pleased the lord
[1:27:11] that he will go away from being having
[1:27:14] sevens and people bringing his meal and
[1:27:17] people watching
[1:27:18] his clothes to go with one rob on his
[1:27:21] back
[1:27:23] because he did not have time to pack a
[1:27:25] bag to leave egypt
[1:27:27] he ran so he went with only one suit
[1:27:35] praise the lord that was when he knew
[1:27:38] how
[1:27:39] how bad he smelled
[1:27:43] because before then he never know what
[1:27:45] sweat was
[1:27:49] but yet it pleased the lord because god
[1:27:52] wanted a deliverer
[1:27:57] so it placed god that he should be
[1:27:58] stripped of everything
[1:28:03] you think the thing that brings pleasure
[1:28:05] to god
[1:28:07] is how you feel your feelings don't
[1:28:11] bring pleasure to god
[1:28:15] praise the lord
[1:28:18] how you feel oh i don't feel that this
[1:28:21] is right it don't bring pleasure to god
[1:28:23] god don't care about it
[1:28:26] because our sense of feeling is
[1:28:29] connected to the fall
[1:28:34] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:28:36] the thing that can make you to feel good
[1:28:38] may not make me to feel good
[1:28:47] the pleasure of the lord prospered in
[1:28:50] his hands
[1:28:52] but you see with uh with job
[1:28:55] and with moses and with david
[1:28:59] this little boy just like every little
[1:29:02] boy trying to be
[1:29:03] uh you know a seven trying to be nicer
[1:29:06] you know teenager he likes to throw his
[1:29:09] slingshot
[1:29:10] and and and you know go down on the
[1:29:13] mountains jumping on his legs and
[1:29:15] you know kicking rocks and everything in
[1:29:17] and yeri says samuel comes and anoint
[1:29:19] him to be prophet
[1:29:26] now from that from that young age now
[1:29:30] he was now to god's pleasure
[1:29:35] because he was anointed to be king
[1:29:38] he was now to god's pleasure
[1:29:42] so god had to rob him of all his
[1:29:45] pleasure
[1:29:50] so from a very young age he started
[1:29:53] becoming responsible got down there and
[1:29:55] saw the whole camp empty
[1:29:57] and everybody quiet and said what's
[1:29:59] going wrong down here and then goliath
[1:30:01] comes out and said who is that on second
[1:30:03] size philistine
[1:30:04] when even his older brother the kings
[1:30:06] and everybody hiding himself
[1:30:08] but this young man because he was now to
[1:30:10] god's pleasure
[1:30:11] he had to rise up to that responsibility
[1:30:16] that's what happens
[1:30:20] when you are to god's pleasure age does
[1:30:23] not count
[1:30:25] because we have some young people that
[1:30:27] are very responsible
[1:30:30] then some 40 50 and 60 years old that is
[1:30:33] tying hater on their heads and
[1:30:35] muscle arm and getting naked in the
[1:30:37] street
[1:30:41] it's because as a young age god has
[1:30:44] pulled you for his pleasure
[1:30:46] he said i'm going to have a bride i'm
[1:30:48] going to have a people in laodicea
[1:30:51] and just like mary you have found favor
[1:30:53] with god
[1:30:55] you better treasure it
[1:30:58] you better treasure it
[1:31:02] and stop complaining
[1:31:08] praise the lord and we know all of the
[1:31:12] things that went more
[1:31:13] uh david killed goliath and before so
[1:31:17] long he was brought
[1:31:18] saw promise that the man that killed
[1:31:22] goliath i'm going to give him my
[1:31:24] daughter so david were not even planning
[1:31:26] a wedding
[1:31:30] he was not planning a wedding he was not
[1:31:31] even ready
[1:31:34] all that was in his hair was to take
[1:31:36] care of those sheep
[1:31:39] but now he was to god's pleasure he have
[1:31:43] killed goliath
[1:31:44] they have to face a wedding date
[1:31:50] praise the lord they had to face a
[1:31:53] wedding there they had to pull him down
[1:31:55] from
[1:31:55] from the backside of the desert he got
[1:31:57] to be there and saw a house plane
[1:32:00] happened to cast out evil spirit from
[1:32:02] saul
[1:32:04] and saw throwing the javelin at him now
[1:32:08] he asking himself
[1:32:09] what is this
[1:32:12] is it is it what happened when you are
[1:32:13] in the king house
[1:32:16] when i was on the back side of the
[1:32:17] desert
[1:32:19] oh the lions and the bear they were
[1:32:21] afraid of me is it my time to be afraid
[1:32:23] of somebody
[1:32:28] but when god is having his pleasure
[1:32:33] in your life
[1:32:37] where he leaves me and i will follow
[1:32:40] what he feeds me and i will swallow
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:50] embrace own devil how to be on the run
[1:32:54] and all of those men david moses
[1:32:57] job we know the story about joseph
[1:33:01] and we can go from one character to
[1:33:03] another character in the bible
[1:33:06] but all of those men god
[1:33:09] had a level of pleasure in their life
[1:33:13] for things that he wanted to do things
[1:33:15] that were not so that to their choosing
[1:33:17] joseph his brothers have to sell him and
[1:33:20] the only reason is because
[1:33:22] god wanted him to go and be in egypt
[1:33:24] before the family would come
[1:33:28] that was the only reason they were so
[1:33:30] mean to their brother
[1:33:34] god wanted him to be there to be in
[1:33:36] position
[1:33:38] before the farming will come upon the
[1:33:40] earth so he will be able to preserve
[1:33:43] god's seed for a promise that was made
[1:33:49] are we together
[1:33:53] by all of those men there was
[1:33:56] now one word
[1:34:00] god's pleasure prospered
[1:34:05] like this man jehovah 7
[1:34:09] that we are talking about let's read
[1:34:11] another scripture here i'm
[1:34:13] i'm just i'm just getting started i hope
[1:34:15] you had a good breakfast this morning
[1:34:17] if i stay long and you get hungry just
[1:34:20] just wait
[1:34:21] your lunch might be on me
[1:34:24] praise the lord amen
[1:34:29] maybe i might have to carry the whole
[1:34:31] church out this afternoon
[1:34:39] we just have to find a place that can
[1:34:41] hold us all
[1:34:43] and there is nowhere can hold us all
[1:34:45] then i bailed myself out
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:50] i'm a good businessman you know
[1:34:54] are we together praise the lord
[1:34:58] let's look at isaiah chapter 40 and see
[1:35:00] something here
[1:35:03] that is so beautiful in the scripture
[1:35:06] i'm not started preaching here though
[1:35:09] i'm just
[1:35:09] only laying the foundation for what i
[1:35:12] want to say
[1:35:14] maybe preaching my night take me long if
[1:35:15] i can do a good job in laying my
[1:35:17] foundation
[1:35:18] isaiah chapter 44
[1:35:22] god is speaking here to the prophet
[1:35:26] isaiah
[1:35:30] of a king a gentile king before he was
[1:35:33] born
[1:35:35] cyrus the king let's look at verse 28.
[1:35:38] the bible says
[1:35:42] that set of of observers
[1:35:54] i mean i wanted to move back a little
[1:35:57] bit but
[1:35:58] i'm trying not to do too much of a
[1:36:01] reading you can just mark that down read
[1:36:03] just go back a little bit you get the
[1:36:05] picture that's sarah
[1:36:07] cyrus he is my shepherd
[1:36:11] and shall perform all my pleasure
[1:36:16] even saying to jerusalem
[1:36:20] thou sh thou shall be built
[1:36:24] into the temple that foundation shall be
[1:36:27] laid again
[1:36:28] now this god is speaking about cyrus
[1:36:31] years before he was born now you have to
[1:36:34] realize that jeremiah
[1:36:35] i mean uh isaiah brought his prophecy
[1:36:38] before jeremiah
[1:36:40] okay and jeremiah prophecy that was when
[1:36:43] israel went
[1:36:43] into captivity to babylon and
[1:36:46] nebuchadnezzar has to come
[1:36:47] and and and belchers that took after
[1:36:49] nebuchadnezzar
[1:36:50] because nebuchadnezzar took after his
[1:36:52] father and
[1:36:54] and uh uh and then
[1:36:57] after that before the means and persian
[1:37:00] when when the handwriting came on the
[1:37:02] wall that was the very same night where
[1:37:05] the maze and persian took over babylon
[1:37:09] praise the lord and when the mission
[1:37:11] persian took over babylon the first king
[1:37:13] was darus
[1:37:15] so you look at that span of time but yet
[1:37:18] isaiah is talking
[1:37:20] about cyrus the king that was going to
[1:37:23] do
[1:37:24] god's pleasure which of course
[1:37:27] it was on cyrus the king that
[1:37:32] the temple was built
[1:37:35] or that he sent men back to start
[1:37:39] considering the building of the temple
[1:37:43] are we together but you see yara said
[1:37:47] years before he was eating bone
[1:37:51] god is speaking about him and saying
[1:37:54] i'm going to have a gentile king he
[1:37:57] don't know the 10 commandments he's not
[1:37:59] a hebrew
[1:38:00] but he's going to be to my pleasure i
[1:38:03] will have him in my hand
[1:38:04] he's going to be my shepherd he will
[1:38:06] going to be to my
[1:38:07] pleasure and the thing that we have him
[1:38:10] to do
[1:38:11] is the building of the temple
[1:38:20] praise the lord i was thinking about
[1:38:22] that the other day
[1:38:24] the handwriting comes from the wall
[1:38:27] amen the first thing there is that when
[1:38:31] nebuchadnezzar had his
[1:38:33] his his dream and he told
[1:38:37] he couldn't even talk about a dream
[1:38:39] because he couldn't even remember it
[1:38:42] he just said i had a dream that troubled
[1:38:44] me by night
[1:38:46] if anyone can remind me of my dream and
[1:38:48] give me the interpretation thereof and
[1:38:50] if none of you guys can do i will cut
[1:38:52] your head off
[1:38:53] because i'm so troubled by what i saw
[1:38:57] praise the lord because true dreams
[1:39:02] goes to your subconscious
[1:39:06] praise the lord amen it goes through
[1:39:09] your
[1:39:09] subconscious it affects your
[1:39:12] subconscious that's why when you have a
[1:39:13] dream
[1:39:14] and and and and it troubles you it means
[1:39:16] that uh
[1:39:17] you know it's it's almost like
[1:39:20] it it's almost like you are living after
[1:39:24] you were dead
[1:39:27] it was almost like you left your body
[1:39:29] you went to life
[1:39:31] and then you came back to your body so
[1:39:33] you feel that thing
[1:39:35] you feel that impact that heaviness
[1:39:40] praise the lord so daniel
[1:39:44] tells him the interpretation daniel
[1:39:46] tells him you know what the image
[1:39:48] and down there is not even a friend you
[1:39:53] think about it think about it now that i
[1:39:55] taught about this
[1:39:56] this uh a little bit here because i was
[1:39:58] i was i was doing some things on dreams
[1:40:00] and and and even even look at the uh uh
[1:40:04] joseph he gives an interpretation to the
[1:40:07] bakla the cup bearer and says that you
[1:40:09] know the
[1:40:09] pharaoh is going to have have you out of
[1:40:12] here the next man gave him a dream he
[1:40:13] says
[1:40:14] three days you're going to be hank you
[1:40:16] see if you have the word of the lord if
[1:40:18] it's the truth inspiration
[1:40:20] you don't care about the consequence
[1:40:22] your duty is to give the word
[1:40:27] daniel gives the dream and said
[1:40:28] nebuchadnezzar this is what you're
[1:40:30] dreaming this is but this is the meaning
[1:40:32] of faith the head of god is your kingdom
[1:40:34] after your kingdom
[1:40:35] there is another kingdom that will take
[1:40:36] place now he's not afraid that if i tell
[1:40:39] nebuchadnezzar
[1:40:40] his kingdom will come to an end he will
[1:40:42] put me in prison put me in prison or
[1:40:44] don't put me in the prison
[1:40:45] is the word of the lord i'm going to say
[1:40:48] anyhow
[1:40:52] handwriting comes on the wall and and
[1:40:55] and
[1:40:55] and and and uh belcher's shazam
[1:40:58] his knee knocked together and and and i
[1:41:01] mean he's he's just drunk drowning
[1:41:03] and dania comes and reads the
[1:41:05] handwriting on the wall
[1:41:06] and you know what daniel tells him he
[1:41:08] says your days is
[1:41:10] done you are done
[1:41:14] as i'm talking to you right now the
[1:41:17] chairs of the meetings have been come
[1:41:18] about the city
[1:41:20] you see that's the word of the lord when
[1:41:22] a man has the word of the lord
[1:41:24] you are not afraid of the faces of the
[1:41:26] people you tell them
[1:41:28] just as the lord gave it to you
[1:41:36] praise the lord amen
[1:41:42] so we see here that cyrus was prophesied
[1:41:46] that god would have something
[1:41:49] in his life do you realize that was the
[1:41:52] reason why darus the king
[1:41:54] pulled daniel to himself that was when
[1:41:57] daniel went to the lion's den children
[1:41:58] you remember your bible
[1:42:00] story the reason why is because
[1:42:03] when they came and captured babylon they
[1:42:06] told him there was a man that just
[1:42:08] prophesied
[1:42:09] that you were coming
[1:42:13] so darus wanted to see this man
[1:42:17] who knew that i was going to take over
[1:42:18] the city
[1:42:21] that was the thing that makes him to
[1:42:22] fear dania
[1:42:24] because if god could reveal to him
[1:42:27] down here years and years
[1:42:31] now after the babylonian kingdom we come
[1:42:33] the maze and the persian
[1:42:36] there is something about this man
[1:42:42] so he pulled down here as a friend and
[1:42:44] one that he goes to
[1:42:46] for advices
[1:42:51] praise the lord and then it got all
[1:42:56] his men jealous about dania you know the
[1:42:59] rest of the story
[1:43:00] and applauded to kill him
[1:43:04] glory be to god
[1:43:07] glory be to god
[1:43:10] water awesome god we serve what a
[1:43:13] wonderful god we serve
[1:43:15] if god could determine the pleasure that
[1:43:19] he would have
[1:43:21] in sarah's life before he was born
[1:43:25] then you think about yourself this
[1:43:26] morning
[1:43:30] god has already determined
[1:43:33] where he's going to be so pleased with
[1:43:36] you
[1:43:38] he's going to be so pleased with you
[1:43:40] it's not what you can calculate in your
[1:43:42] mind
[1:43:43] it's not how you can just bring yourself
[1:43:45] together i have to behave
[1:43:47] and you i may not know he has already
[1:43:50] determined
[1:43:52] sometimes it's not from your attendance
[1:43:54] in church
[1:43:55] sometimes it's the little trials he puts
[1:43:58] in your life
[1:44:00] praise the lord sometimes says some
[1:44:02] things that he want to get from you
[1:44:04] you and him struggling he tried to
[1:44:06] deliver you you put it back a little bit
[1:44:08] you say lord i give it to you you take
[1:44:10] it back again
[1:44:18] praise the lord amen
[1:44:24] what a wonderful jesus yourself he's an
[1:44:27] awesome god
[1:44:30] he told jeremiah before you were
[1:44:32] conceived in your mother warm
[1:44:35] i knew you praise the lord
[1:44:38] jeremiah was one of those young men that
[1:44:41] the pleasure of the lord
[1:44:45] prospered in his life from a young age
[1:44:49] god told him from a young age he never
[1:44:51] had to play soccer or football or
[1:44:53] basketball with his friends
[1:44:58] from a young age she was just so
[1:45:00] burdened and burned
[1:45:02] in the heart of the lord and the first
[1:45:04] time he was on fire he just think that
[1:45:06] when he go and tell the people they will
[1:45:07] repent
[1:45:09] when he go and tell the people they get
[1:45:10] angry at him
[1:45:13] he gets frustrated oh my god what is
[1:45:15] this
[1:45:18] he said i don't want to do this again
[1:45:24] i tried to lay for you i try to be a
[1:45:28] witness
[1:45:31] he said lord i can do this again
[1:45:35] he said but yet your word burned in my
[1:45:37] heart
[1:45:39] your word i feel it like a fire
[1:45:42] it burned in my heart i can't stop it i
[1:45:44] don't know what to do
[1:45:46] praise the lord that's why you feel
[1:45:48] sometimes when you want to give up
[1:45:51] amen since i'm just tired with this
[1:45:53] christian life
[1:45:55] then you go back again and say oh god
[1:45:57] i'm sorry
[1:45:59] the world burns because the pleasure of
[1:46:01] the lord
[1:46:02] is determined upon your life but all of
[1:46:06] these men as we talk about them
[1:46:08] will realize that there is not one that
[1:46:12] uh the pleasure of god prosper
[1:46:16] in his life or her life
[1:46:21] because we can talk about sarah
[1:46:24] a young woman that got married happy to
[1:46:26] be married
[1:46:28] praise the lord that's the first thing
[1:46:30] they get happy to get married the next
[1:46:31] thing
[1:46:32] they look for they are looking forward
[1:46:33] is happy to have a child
[1:46:37] and then there is no child she had to go
[1:46:39] 25 years
[1:46:42] the house was so dry there was no baby
[1:46:44] so she said hey guy we need some baby
[1:46:46] cry in this house
[1:46:48] after i follow abraham all these years
[1:46:50] he can't bring her
[1:46:51] okay he got had the baby the baby is
[1:46:54] crying sarah is trying to be
[1:46:56] to be nice to the baby and hagar is
[1:46:58] giving her eyes
[1:46:59] and attitude like young women does
[1:47:07] praise the lord
[1:47:13] but it was the pleasure of god upon
[1:47:15] serious life
[1:47:16] it was the pleasure of god upon
[1:47:18] rebecca's life it was the pleasure of
[1:47:20] god upon a richest life it was the
[1:47:23] pleasure of god all of these women
[1:47:24] through the bible
[1:47:29] can you even think about eve
[1:47:33] the first girl
[1:47:37] you know what what fathers love their
[1:47:39] girl child
[1:47:41] because god loves eve
[1:47:49] but it was the pleasure of god i'm
[1:47:51] coming to that in the meaning here
[1:47:54] it was a pleasure of god
[1:47:57] that she would be the channel through
[1:47:58] which
[1:48:01] the attributes of god because there is
[1:48:04] no way that
[1:48:05] god could make his attributes of being
[1:48:08] the redeemer or being a savior or being
[1:48:10] a healer
[1:48:11] if there was no sin and as much as it
[1:48:15] was heartbroken
[1:48:16] to god
[1:48:19] but yet it please the father
[1:48:29] oh i pray that we will go through this
[1:48:31] easter
[1:48:32] with a different concept
[1:48:38] and say lord be it unto me i call into
[1:48:42] your word
[1:48:43] whatever pleases you
[1:48:48] let it happen to me
[1:48:51] just give me grace
[1:48:54] to bait
[1:48:57] praise the lord because that's all you
[1:48:59] need

[1:49:12] amen amen what a wonderful jesus
[1:49:15] yourself

[1:49:33] bother me
[1:49:34] inspire me to preach because i know i'm
[1:49:37] drilling right at the right place
[1:49:46] let's just read a couple years god's
[1:49:48] gift
[1:49:49] always find this place
[1:49:53] and now we find out his
[1:49:56] deity and brought him frank incent
[1:50:02] was a type that he was a seven of
[1:50:05] jehovah
[1:50:07] jesus is jehovah seven sit down to think
[1:50:11] about something
[1:50:12] that he can do to help others
[1:50:19] praise the lord
[1:50:23] many of those men will have a reward
[1:50:28] a man that came up with the polio vasin
[1:50:31] and and the different vaccine and all of
[1:50:32] that
[1:50:34] praise the lord but right right in there
[1:50:37] is god
[1:50:38] jehovah seven now we find our deity
[1:50:43] his deity and they brought him frank
[1:50:46] incense
[1:50:46] which was a type that he was a seven of
[1:50:51] jehovah
[1:50:52] jesus is jehovah seven
[1:50:57] in matthew chapter 12 we find out that
[1:51:01] he
[1:51:02] was jehovah seven behold my
[1:51:05] seventh in whom i am well pleased
[1:51:12] praise the lord that is the great
[1:51:15] mystery that is around the godhead
[1:51:19] that is the great mystery paul said for
[1:51:21] great
[1:51:22] is the mystery of godliness
[1:51:25] great is the mystery of godliness that's
[1:51:27] what he said in the book of timing amen
[1:51:32] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:51:37] for he preached unto the gentiles paul
[1:51:40] was saying god
[1:51:41] preached unto the gentiles how did he do
[1:51:42] it through christ
[1:51:53] jesus symbolized it in his in his last
[1:51:56] action with the disciples by watching
[1:51:58] their feet
[1:52:01] it was it was all he did was just to
[1:52:04] show them
[1:52:07] this is what all of this is about is
[1:52:10] selving one another watching one another
[1:52:13] feet not even in their head
[1:52:15] the nice part their feet the dirty part
[1:52:26] praise the lord i hope our next
[1:52:29] communion we can do foot watching
[1:52:32] we tried to esteem from it with all of
[1:52:34] these uh coronavirus uh
[1:52:36] restriction but i'm sure with a max on
[1:52:39] your face you can do foot watching
[1:52:42] praise the lord amen
[1:52:54] i put my strength upon him so his life
[1:52:57] was anointed with frank in sin
[1:53:00] to jehovah's service what a gift
[1:53:03] identified jesus as
[1:53:05] jehovah seven he's talking about the
[1:53:07] three gifts that were brought by the
[1:53:08] wise man the frank incense
[1:53:11] was used to anoint him for service
[1:53:14] because he was jehovah seven
[1:53:22] behold my seven
[1:53:25] in whom i uphold
[1:53:29] praise the lord
[1:53:34] so the purpose was for god's pleasure
[1:53:38] to prosper in his hands
[1:53:42] are we together let's take some few
[1:53:45] scriptures here
[1:53:47] having some few things to cover up here
[1:53:48] now i want to go a little bit faster
[1:53:50] amen
[1:53:52] are you ready let's look at first
[1:53:54] chronicle chapter 29
[1:53:56] 17. first chronicle chapter 29 17
[1:54:00] we just we just want to uh use that and
[1:54:03] uh edified ourselves a little bit
[1:54:06] praise the lord first chronicle chapter
[1:54:08] 29 verse 17
[1:54:13] praise the lord verse 17 reads here
[1:54:24] i know also my god that thou
[1:54:27] tried the heart
[1:54:31] and have pleasure in uprightness
[1:54:38] as for me in the uprightness of my heart
[1:54:43] i have willingly offered all these
[1:54:45] things
[1:54:46] and now i have seen
[1:54:49] with joy thy people
[1:54:54] god have pleasure in uprightness
[1:54:58] ezra chapter 10 verse 11.
[1:55:10] i'm making a little trap here to bring
[1:55:12] you into
[1:55:14] let me tell you before we get there but
[1:55:16] let's just read this scripture
[1:55:18] 10 11 now therefore make confession unto
[1:55:22] the lord
[1:55:23] god of your father
[1:55:26] and do his pleasure what is his pleasure
[1:55:30] separate yourself from the people of the
[1:55:32] land
[1:55:34] and from your strange wives this was the
[1:55:37] restoration
[1:55:39] of the temple when ezra and nehemiah's
[1:55:42] has come back
[1:55:43] and bringing the people back amen
[1:55:47] he's saying confess your sin
[1:55:51] and do his pleasure what is his pleasure
[1:55:54] separate yourself from the things that
[1:55:58] you have got to
[1:55:59] involved in amen
[1:56:04] as much as god loves you to be in church
[1:56:06] and he loves you to sing his praise
[1:56:10] it does not amount unto his pleasure if
[1:56:12] you are indulging in
[1:56:14] things contrary to his word
[1:56:18] so you're only pleasing your religious
[1:56:21] desire
[1:56:23] but you're not allowing the lord to have
[1:56:25] pleasure
[1:56:26] in you
[1:56:34] we have more scriptures to to to kind of
[1:56:36] uh
[1:56:37] go over here and then on and on and on
[1:56:40] let me let me just
[1:56:41] let me just go on and on like that
[1:56:44] praise the lord
[1:56:46] amen praise the lord
[1:56:50] so we see here we see that uh
[1:56:53] uh you know uh this is uh
[1:56:57] it's uh it's it's a redemption word he
[1:56:59] was we were made for his pleasure
[1:57:02] paul said that inefficient also you know
[1:57:05] the counsel of his will
[1:57:06] the pleasure of his will you know and
[1:57:09] all of that
[1:57:10] i mean that's that's what we are here
[1:57:12] that's what god sent
[1:57:13] sen sent out a message to to pull us
[1:57:17] out to redeem us as his people so his
[1:57:20] pleasure
[1:57:20] can prosper in our lives whatever he has
[1:57:23] laid out for
[1:57:24] us but you see over the years
[1:57:27] you know uh you see all of these men and
[1:57:31] women through the scripture
[1:57:33] in a way that god was able to have
[1:57:36] pleasure in their life was to carry them
[1:57:38] contrary to their plan i don't believe
[1:57:40] that it was sarah plan to go without a
[1:57:42] child for 25 years
[1:57:44] god had to take them on another route
[1:57:46] that was completely
[1:57:48] contrary to their plan and to many of
[1:57:50] them it was like suffering
[1:57:53] so you see over the years the the the
[1:57:56] christian faith
[1:57:57] have somehow associated suffering
[1:58:01] to god's will and in that way
[1:58:05] sometimes we plague ourselves wrongly
[1:58:11] oh yeah when the catholic church was
[1:58:13] doing penance that people have to crawl
[1:58:15] on their knees and crawl down on
[1:58:17] breaking bottles
[1:58:19] just because of the wrong that they have
[1:58:20] done it was never god's will
[1:58:26] it was never god's will
[1:58:31] now you see the thing that brings
[1:58:33] pleasure to god is not what you playing
[1:58:35] it's not what you desire
[1:58:37] is what he plans that you don't know
[1:58:39] nothing about
[1:58:40] you have your plan going on here and he
[1:58:43] drive you into this path
[1:58:44] you say no that's not where i want to go
[1:58:46] i'm going down there while my life is
[1:58:48] going this way
[1:58:49] no it's that place that i want to go
[1:59:02] but over the years people has brought
[1:59:06] self-affection to themselves
[1:59:09] some has become lazy to work that they
[1:59:12] think that
[1:59:13] poverty makes you closer to god you are
[1:59:16] just lazy to work
[1:59:18] find a job
[1:59:23] praise the lord because i mean they are
[1:59:25] not even improving their life
[1:59:28] they say is the word of god but yeah
[1:59:29] they say they are they are complaining
[1:59:31] i'm suffering and it's the word of god
[1:59:32] and why are you complaining
[1:59:38] it's just a misrepresentation of faith
[1:59:41] a misrepresentation of truth
[1:59:45] looking at old testament characters
[1:59:48] suffering it was not their will it was
[1:59:51] not their choice
[1:59:52] that they know how to play themselves
[1:59:55] that way
[2:00:01] are we together let me read this to you
[2:00:04] by faith moses i wouldn't say to people
[2:00:09] that they should choose to be afflicted
[2:00:14] because sometimes we make those choices
[2:00:18] when we can do a better thing
[2:00:24] when we can choose to smile
[2:00:27] sometimes we choose not to smile
[2:00:31] because we think that when we smile i
[2:00:33] mean we are we uh
[2:00:34] we uh uh i mean we're becoming sinful
[2:00:47] praise the lord amen
[2:00:53] i heard my wife giving it loud amen
[2:00:59] because sometimes she thinks i don't
[2:01:00] smile but i always tell her that
[2:01:04] it's because i'm ugly
[2:01:07] if you see my face like that it's just
[2:01:09] because i'm ugly
[2:01:11] it don't mean that i'm angry
[2:01:21] if i try to be serious i get so ugly
[2:01:25] praise the lord god have mercy deliver
[2:01:28] me lord
[2:01:32] i wouldn't say that that people should
[2:01:34] choose to be afflicted
[2:01:36] i don't say that you should choose
[2:01:38] suffering
[2:01:42] it will not be the himal thing to do
[2:01:46] because no human want to suffer
[2:01:51] it would not be the human thing to do
[2:01:56] because no human want to suffer
[2:02:03] but if suffering lays
[2:02:08] in the path of duty
[2:02:11] then let's take it as it comes
[2:02:21] i don't want you to do something
[2:02:24] for somebody to make fun of you
[2:02:29] in that way we have misrepresented the
[2:02:32] gospel
[2:02:32] yes sir if we think that being sloppy
[2:02:37] is simplicity you have misrepresented
[2:02:41] the gospel
[2:02:44] praise the lord and if you think being
[2:02:48] flashy
[2:02:52] is prosperity you have misrepresented
[2:02:55] the gospel we must not be sloppy
[2:03:01] we must not be flashy
[2:03:05] we must be decent
[2:03:16] are we together
[2:03:20] i don't want you to do something for
[2:03:21] somebody to make fun of you
[2:03:23] i wouldn't want you to say different
[2:03:26] things
[2:03:28] and you hear people saying this this
[2:03:30] message is not for everybody this
[2:03:32] message is hot the message
[2:03:33] is not high
[2:03:37] it's not high it's
[2:03:40] all the legalistic thing we have put in
[2:03:42] our mind
[2:03:44] and the regulation that we have built
[2:03:46] this is the liberty of jesus christ
[2:03:51] it's the liberty of jesus christ
[2:03:54] why you think that you will have grace
[2:03:57] to receive this message and you think
[2:03:59] that somebody else will not have grace
[2:04:02] the message is hard this message here is
[2:04:04] high it's not for everybody
[2:04:06] it's because you are inside
[2:04:11] i don't want you to say something
[2:04:16] to make yourself different to people
[2:04:20] you make yourself a fanatic and pretty
[2:04:24] soon people look at your belief to be
[2:04:26] a cottage belief
[2:04:30] they don't want to associate you because
[2:04:31] you just make yourself so strange
[2:04:46] happy easter anyway
[2:04:54] i wouldn't want you to say something
[2:04:56] different i belong to a church
[2:04:59] that doesn't believe in such and such
[2:05:02] in this word praise the lord
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:10] and the things like that just to get
[2:05:13] people to make fun of you
[2:05:22] you're trying to create persecution for
[2:05:32] yourself
[2:05:37] praise the lord
[2:05:43] i was thinking about going to uh romania
[2:05:45] for
[2:05:46] for easter meeting i'm still supposed to
[2:05:49] talk to brother gabriel there and see
[2:05:51] uh uh if we if we can if we can come
[2:05:54] over
[2:05:56] so uh uh since you've been so quiet on
[2:05:59] me and i can leave you
[2:06:02] for now
[2:06:05] praise the lord we just have to kind of
[2:06:09] figure out the things there i mean last
[2:06:11] i think two years ago that i was invited
[2:06:13] but
[2:06:14] i've didn't plan to go
[2:06:18] the good thing there is that there is to
[2:06:20] come after hours
[2:06:22] so uh yeah so uh
[2:06:25] so don't think i'm i'm running away from
[2:06:27] you anyway
[2:06:29] amen it's just that you're being so
[2:06:31] quiet on me this morning
[2:06:35] i wouldn't say for you to get out here
[2:06:40] and carry on and do something
[2:06:44] that was radical
[2:06:47] i wouldn't want you to do that
[2:06:50] so that somebody will say that you are a
[2:06:53] fanatic
[2:06:57] now if if it's just if it just comes out
[2:07:00] because the person
[2:07:01] think that i mean uh you're not
[2:07:03] unanimously saying maybe you're not
[2:07:05] dressing uh uh
[2:07:06] sexy you're not exposing your body okay
[2:07:09] say oh that one
[2:07:10] she's old school well we can understand
[2:07:12] that
[2:07:18] praise the lord
[2:07:27] you bring that to yourself
[2:07:31] but if it lays in the path of duty
[2:07:34] towards god
[2:07:36] let the world say what they want to say
[2:07:39] you just live on live
[2:07:43] on your christian life praise the lord
[2:07:47] you're not trying to make anybody angry
[2:07:49] you're not trying to impress anybody
[2:07:51] you just want the pleasure of the lord
[2:07:55] to prosper in your life
[2:08:04] praise the lord
[2:08:13] are we together
[2:08:17] now the first time that this word
[2:08:18] pleasure was used in the bible
[2:08:23] it was actually concerning our father
[2:08:25] abraham
[2:08:27] we were talking about a friend of god
[2:08:30] on wednesday night abraham the friend of
[2:08:33] god
[2:08:34] that's in genesis chapter 18
[2:08:41] praise the lord okay
[2:08:44] so i see that the time is the time is
[2:08:48] now
[2:08:48] amen the time is now so it is not bad
[2:08:52] for me to say that i will soon be
[2:08:54] closing
[2:08:56] you just hang on a little bit amen
[2:09:02] hang on and hold tight
[2:09:05] genesis chapter 18
[2:09:10] god came to visit abraham
[2:09:15] when he came to visit abraham
[2:09:20] concerning the promise that he had given
[2:09:22] to abraham that they have
[2:09:23] they have kept him you know walk with
[2:09:25] god for 25 years
[2:09:28] god come down and he's talking to
[2:09:29] abraham let's take verse 12 right here
[2:09:32] and and and and sarah
[2:09:37] verse 11 now abraham and sarah were old
[2:09:42] and well stricken in the age
[2:09:44] and it sees to be
[2:09:47] with sarah after the manner of women
[2:09:52] she have stepped into the cycle of life
[2:09:57] praise the lord a cycle where life
[2:10:00] begins
[2:10:09] they have ceased to be with sarah after
[2:10:13] the man of women
[2:10:14] and to menopause let's see that way
[2:10:17] therefore
[2:10:18] sarah laughed within herself saying
[2:10:23] after i'm walks oh shall i have pleasure
[2:10:30] my lord being old also
[2:10:36] now we see that
[2:10:40] she says this
[2:10:46] lord be to god amen
[2:10:54] and uh in a lot of this word
[2:10:59] she uses the word pleasure
[2:11:02] now most of the time
[2:11:06] as i was telling on this i realized that
[2:11:09] uh
[2:11:10] it is it's going to be very interesting
[2:11:12] so just pay attention to media
[2:11:15] let me close this bible i think i can
[2:11:17] find a way to
[2:11:18] to stop here or find a place where we
[2:11:21] can be able to
[2:11:23] to to close up here for the evening
[2:11:26] or for the morning afternoon whatever
[2:11:28] time it is now but
[2:11:31] sarah says the bible says she has
[2:11:34] stepped into
[2:11:36] the time of life a time where life
[2:11:40] begins
[2:11:41] uh sister rebecca smith
[2:11:44] brandon smith wrote a very nice piece on
[2:11:47] that
[2:11:48] uh listen to it the last time audio
[2:11:51] portion of it and
[2:11:52] and i just thought it was beautiful so i
[2:11:54] kind of stole it
[2:11:55] uh we maybe we might play one of these
[2:11:57] days uh uh
[2:12:00] and enjoy it together
[2:12:03] but you will realize that
[2:12:07] uh sarah's were making an expression the
[2:12:10] bible says she live in her heart
[2:12:13] and she says i'm i'm worth stricken in
[2:12:15] age i'm old
[2:12:18] shall i have pleasure and uh
[2:12:21] uh and and abraham my husband is also
[2:12:25] old
[2:12:29] it's amazing that she says that
[2:12:33] because
[2:12:36] it opened the channel here
[2:12:39] word
[2:12:43] we can see there now because we know
[2:12:45] that this is somehow
[2:12:46] attached to redemption but we can see
[2:12:49] that and i was thinking about it i was
[2:12:52] saying
[2:12:52] in my mind uh you know like the bible
[2:12:56] says
[2:12:57] men were inspired of all to write the
[2:12:59] scriptures you know the inspiration of
[2:13:02] god and i believe it was no mistake that
[2:13:04] they used that word they could have used
[2:13:06] another word
[2:13:07] but that actually opened china for
[2:13:10] us to understand something very
[2:13:14] important very very very
[2:13:17] important and that's what we want to get
[2:13:20] into
[2:13:21] because as sarah uses this word i'm all
[2:13:24] shall i have pleasure it's so easy
[2:13:29] for our mindset
[2:13:32] to run onto sexual affairs
[2:13:38] praise the lord and as i stated on the
[2:13:41] word
[2:13:43] it was in the 1600s
[2:13:47] that the word pleasure was associated
[2:13:50] with sexual affairs
[2:13:55] praise the lord so
[2:14:00] this will open something up here for us
[2:14:05] and it's is it's very beautiful
[2:14:09] very very beautiful
[2:14:13] because it's one of the things that is
[2:14:16] plaguing our age
[2:14:20] i wanted to say young people but
[2:14:22] everybody in this age is plagued by that
[2:14:25] because it's a spirit that is just all
[2:14:27] over the place
[2:14:28] plaguing the minds of young old
[2:14:36] the only people that are not plagued is
[2:14:38] the ones that are addicted with it
[2:14:42] because they are already addicted they
[2:14:45] are drunk in it
[2:14:50] marriage homes is a plaque we feed a
[2:14:52] marriage home is plagued with faith
[2:14:53] that's the spirit of the age
[2:14:55] but it's going to bring us to a very
[2:14:57] important place
[2:14:59] because apostle wide and as i was
[2:15:02] studying
[2:15:04] i asked myself i says
[2:15:08] i need to go down this trail lord i
[2:15:10] think i feel in my heart that you
[2:15:12] you kind of for taking me down here and
[2:15:15] i was grateful that i followed the
[2:15:16] leadership of the lord because i learned
[2:15:20] amen
[2:15:22] i said because when when you see his
[2:15:24] death the first
[2:15:25] thing the enemy comes
[2:15:28] and and whispers to the minds of the
[2:15:31] people
[2:15:32] and if god does not help them he starts
[2:15:34] to plague their mind he starts to drift
[2:15:36] them off of the word of god
[2:15:38] he starts to carry their minds into some
[2:15:40] ugly and nasty places
[2:15:45] then i asked myself by the way
[2:15:50] what is sex
[2:15:55] many times we fail to realize that
[2:15:58] sometimes when you are filling an
[2:16:00] application
[2:16:01] they ask you what's your sex
[2:16:05] praise the lord because sex is not an
[2:16:09] act sex
[2:16:12] is a personality
[2:16:19] it's not an act
[2:16:26] praise the lord go to your dictionary
[2:16:28] and define it it tells you
[2:16:31] now with all of the the the gender
[2:16:34] issue that we are having and all of that
[2:16:37] people are beginning to rewrite and
[2:16:39] redefine words
[2:16:41] but if you study the word in its origin
[2:16:49] praise the lord this is how
[2:16:52] the bible defines sex
[2:16:55] psalm chapter 139
[2:16:59] verse 14.
[2:17:03] if our lovely people can put it up for
[2:17:05] us i would love us to read it together
[2:17:12] amen
[2:17:17] glory be to god
[2:17:22] david said and let's read it together
[2:17:26] our praise thee for i am
[2:17:29] fearfully and wonderfully made
[2:17:32] marvelous other works and that my
[2:17:37] soul know it right well
[2:17:40] that's your identity
[2:17:45] that's your identity the the
[2:17:48] the the the way that the biological way
[2:17:52] that
[2:17:52] god made you that make you
[2:17:56] unique as a woman
[2:17:59] and make the man unique as
[2:18:03] a man that's what sex is
[2:18:10] but that word was abused from the
[2:18:13] beginning
[2:18:16] because when the serpent came to eve he
[2:18:19] said do
[2:18:20] you know that god knows
[2:18:24] that the day you eat of this fruit you
[2:18:27] will become
[2:18:28] god what was he doing he was robbing
[2:18:30] them of their identity
[2:18:33] and introducing an act
[2:18:42] he was robbing them of their identity
[2:18:45] and introducing an act
[2:18:49] genesis chapter three let's draw back
[2:18:51] there a little bit
[2:18:55] glory be to god man i'm getting in my
[2:19:00] element
[2:19:01] i'm just beginning to preach
[2:19:06] praise the lord hey
[2:19:09] amen amen
[2:19:12] i can feed the pool somebody is calling
[2:19:14] me
[2:19:16] somebody that's pulling me i can feed it
[2:19:21] glory be to god amen
[2:19:29] are we together
[2:19:36] okay that's that would be over in verse
[2:19:39] 4
[2:19:40] of genesis chapter 3. and the second
[2:19:42] said unto the woman
[2:19:45] ye shall not surely die for god
[2:19:49] does know that the day you eat thereof
[2:19:53] then your eyes
[2:19:55] shall be open the eyes will not close
[2:20:00] and ye shall be as gods they were
[2:20:02] already gods
[2:20:04] because they were made in the image of
[2:20:06] god
[2:20:08] god can only give birth to god but what
[2:20:11] he was doing
[2:20:12] is that he was robbing them
[2:20:17] it's just like a young young man trying
[2:20:19] to tell the young woman you are pretty
[2:20:21] it's not because you say it you must
[2:20:24] tell him
[2:20:24] i know it's not because you say it i
[2:20:27] know that i
[2:20:28] am ready
[2:20:29] [Applause]
[2:20:32] because when he sees that what he's
[2:20:34] trying to do
[2:20:35] is that he's trying to rob you of what
[2:20:38] you thought of yourself
[2:20:39] and now you will take on the image that
[2:20:42] he's given to you
[2:20:44] and all that is in his mind is just to
[2:20:46] abuse you
[2:20:54] praise the lord
[2:21:00] so that's our sex you never go fill an
[2:21:03] application and ask you while you're sex
[2:21:05] and you start talking dirty on the paper
[2:21:07] you always say i'm male or i'm female
[2:21:10] that's what you
[2:21:11] are
[2:21:27] praise the lord
[2:21:33] amen and verse six
[2:21:37] reveal that eve fell for dead
[2:21:43] thinking that taking the devil lie
[2:21:46] she would become a god
[2:21:50] when she was already a god she had
[2:21:53] dominion
[2:21:56] she was on she was she was co-equal with
[2:21:59] adam
[2:22:00] if adam could speak she could speak also
[2:22:06] because god has empowered them to have
[2:22:08] dominion
[2:22:09] over the earth
[2:22:18] praise the lord why can't people see it
[2:22:22] that's the very thing that the devil did
[2:22:24] in the beginning
[2:22:25] rob them of their true identity
[2:22:29] and he introduced an art
[2:22:35] and he's doing the same thing plaguing
[2:22:37] the word
[2:22:38] with that
[2:22:41] praise the lord if you appreciate
[2:22:45] your truth identity you can have the
[2:22:49] greatest pleasure
[2:22:50] in the world because
[2:22:53] it's just by appreciating who you are
[2:22:59] you don't have to get down to some
[2:23:01] debted things to do
[2:23:03] before you think you have you have you
[2:23:05] having pleasure
[2:23:06] what happiness it haunts you with guilt
[2:23:10] it condemns you
[2:23:25] praise the lord are we together
[2:23:34] it's almost one teddy i won't want to
[2:23:35] keep you any longer
[2:23:37] i'm already aware of my time here
[2:23:46] but let me treat something also
[2:23:49] before we close this chapter
[2:23:52] bert branham said in marriage and
[2:23:53] divorce
[2:23:57] he says this i kind of forgot some of
[2:24:00] the words
[2:24:00] because i just wanted to get to the
[2:24:02] point
[2:24:07] so if you want to read the entirety you
[2:24:10] go and find a quote and read it
[2:24:13] she is designed alone for
[2:24:16] he's talking about the unique the
[2:24:19] uniqueness of the woman
[2:24:22] which of course he described
[2:24:26] that no other female is like that
[2:24:30] praise the lord the uniqueness
[2:24:34] of our mothers of our wives of our
[2:24:36] sister
[2:24:38] invisible union he says to no other
[2:24:41] female that god gave three sacred
[2:24:43] virtues
[2:24:49] virgins say woman hold a motherhood
[2:24:54] to no other when god
[2:24:58] gave it to a woman it was a sacred trust
[2:25:06] because the promise of redemption was
[2:25:08] hid behind that
[2:25:13] she will become the mother of all living
[2:25:18] if she can keep that trust she can give
[2:25:21] life
[2:25:23] to a house that is dead
[2:25:31] glory be to god
[2:25:35] i feel like this was kind of a misplaced
[2:25:40] in some ways that i've honest to or some
[2:25:42] ways i've heard it in in a way that i
[2:25:44] think some people
[2:25:45] believe over the years because
[2:25:49] most people taught that when brother
[2:25:51] branham taught marriage and divorce and
[2:25:53] some of the things that he said
[2:25:56] took the woman out of the original
[2:25:57] creation
[2:25:59] that's not a true teaching
[2:26:03] that's not a true teaching
[2:26:06] he was talking about manifesting because
[2:26:10] genesis 1 says he make man
[2:26:12] male and female in his image
[2:26:16] that is the original creation
[2:26:22] but when he was bringing that to
[2:26:23] manifestation
[2:26:25] expressing it to flesh he hate the woman
[2:26:28] in the man
[2:26:32] because it was all the plan of
[2:26:33] redemption
[2:26:41] praise the lord
[2:26:49] a woman is designed alone
[2:26:53] i would just read this and go ahead and
[2:26:56] and you others you can
[2:26:57] you can go home and study it a little
[2:26:59] bit a dog can
[2:27:01] no other female can it's just
[2:27:04] the woman that can a dog or no other
[2:27:07] female
[2:27:09] once a year and that's for her babies
[2:27:14] and that's for sexual pleasure now
[2:27:17] so most people think when brother
[2:27:20] branham says this
[2:27:22] it means that the woman is lesser than
[2:27:25] an
[2:27:25] animal because the animal is designed
[2:27:30] to to go that way because of her
[2:27:34] youngies
[2:27:37] but he says the woman is not that it
[2:27:39] does not means
[2:27:41] that she's lesser it means that
[2:27:44] there is there is something that is
[2:27:46] hidden in her life
[2:27:48] because you have to remember she's a
[2:27:51] type
[2:27:51] of the church and god don't want to have
[2:27:54] pleasure with you
[2:27:55] one time in a year or one time in a week
[2:27:58] or one time in a month
[2:27:59] god wants to have pleasure with his
[2:28:01] redeemed people
[2:28:02] whenever he wants us so god built a
[2:28:06] woman
[2:28:06] in a way that she's not like an animal
[2:28:25] the prophet god would tell us that this
[2:28:27] is this was not god's original way for
[2:28:29] his sons and daughters to come
[2:28:34] it was not his original plan but he
[2:28:37] allowed it because
[2:28:39] he wanted to make his attributes
[2:28:42] manifested
[2:28:46] but you see because of the perverseness
[2:28:48] of our mind
[2:28:55] our mind so filled with perverseness and
[2:28:57] filthiness
[2:28:59] that sometimes it's hard for us to see
[2:29:01] through the pages
[2:29:06] praise the lord
[2:29:11] and just like i said you know i've have
[2:29:13] i've heard it
[2:29:14] you know i've heard i never believe it
[2:29:17] because i think i understood what the
[2:29:18] prophet of god says here
[2:29:22] because it's playing out
[2:29:28] he says for the woman it's different the
[2:29:30] way she's made
[2:29:33] it is not for church for childbearing
[2:29:37] the way that god made her she's
[2:29:39] different
[2:29:41] it is not for childbearing
[2:29:45] because she's she's holding in her life
[2:29:51] you see and and the devil
[2:29:55] exploits that amen
[2:30:01] he has plugged that that's the reason
[2:30:02] why i mean all i mean all the
[2:30:04] the the violence we have in the world
[2:30:06] and all the horrible things that
[2:30:08] that happen i don't want to carry you
[2:30:10] down that road
[2:30:12] but i i want you to be able to grab this
[2:30:15] why because that was what sarah was
[2:30:18] referring to
[2:30:26] that's what she was referring to it
[2:30:28] almost looks like
[2:30:29] you know what uh uh uh
[2:30:33] you know i'm old
[2:30:36] remember now it's not an
[2:30:40] art it's your personality
[2:30:44] praise the lord
[2:30:48] it's your personality so no matter what
[2:30:51] is the age of the person
[2:30:52] you have you have all the people 90
[2:30:55] years old they don't they don't go into
[2:30:57] what young people feel their minds with
[2:31:03] but they just have pleasure to know this
[2:31:05] woman has stayed by my side all of these
[2:31:07] years
[2:31:09] it's just a pleasure to come and see her
[2:31:12] at home
[2:31:13] it's a pleasure to eat breakfast with
[2:31:15] her
[2:31:17] praise the lord
[2:31:24] but the devil right from the beginning
[2:31:27] he plagued
[2:31:28] eve mind with an art and robbed her
[2:31:31] of her personality
[2:31:38] sex is your personality and you must
[2:31:41] protect it
[2:31:49] don't rob yourself of your true
[2:31:51] personality
[2:31:53] just for the few meaning pleasure or a
[2:31:55] few minutes out
[2:32:08] praise the lord well i don't know what
[2:32:11] you want me to preach
[2:32:14] amen do you want me to come and preach
[2:32:18] do not smoke do not drink
[2:32:22] amen is that why you want me to preach
[2:32:24] do not commit fornication don't you know
[2:32:27] that
[2:32:31] do not commit adultery don't you know
[2:32:33] that have you not been reading your
[2:32:36] bible
[2:32:42] because sometimes people say the pastor
[2:32:43] must hammer on that
[2:32:45] you better give me the heavy hammer then
[2:32:50] the pastor should hammer on that
[2:32:55] no the church should go past that
[2:32:58] we must go past that and get into this
[2:33:02] thing
[2:33:02] and understand ourselves
[2:33:06] understand the things that we must do
[2:33:11] do i be teaching preaching on how you
[2:33:13] should cut your head how
[2:33:15] long your trouser must be your dress
[2:33:17] you're scared is that why i should be
[2:33:18] preaching
[2:33:26] well
[2:33:32] like that old evangelist said they say
[2:33:35] all this week you've been preaching on
[2:33:37] repentance he said let the church repent
[2:33:38] first
[2:33:42] praise the lord amen
[2:33:47] amen if you think i'm preaching things
[2:33:50] that is up there reach out and grab it
[2:33:54] when you get ahold of it you will never
[2:33:55] want to come back to these little things
[2:34:01] you want to be for me to be preaching
[2:34:03] come to church you have to be in church
[2:34:04] you're supposed to know that by this
[2:34:06] time
[2:34:06] we're talking about a rapture
[2:34:20] yeah yeah he described
[2:34:24] a peculiar design of the woman
[2:34:29] a peculiar design
[2:34:35] and all of that is tied around
[2:34:42] redemption
[2:34:44] the lord outside of meetings what i've
[2:34:47] heard
[2:34:48] friends preachers preach and they use
[2:34:52] these things
[2:34:53] and become so insulted to god's people
[2:34:56] so insulted to god's daughter because
[2:34:59] they just think that brother branham was
[2:35:01] kinda and filthy in his mind
[2:35:04] like they are in their mind
[2:35:22] you say a dog or any animal once a year
[2:35:25] and that's for their babies not for
[2:35:28] sexual pleasure he sees but for their
[2:35:29] babies the old
[2:35:31] hog the old the old sword hog
[2:35:35] an old dog once a year
[2:35:38] one woman that's for babies but a woman
[2:35:41] is designed
[2:35:43] for any time she desire why
[2:35:47] because that's the reason why genesis
[2:35:49] chapter 3 he says
[2:35:51] your desire shall be to your husband
[2:35:54] and he shall have the rule over you now
[2:35:57] what happened there is that
[2:35:59] because she's built that way for
[2:36:06] redemption
[2:36:08] she's built that way that's the way god
[2:36:09] built her now brother brown goes on he
[2:36:12] says
[2:36:12] i've got some stuff crossed out here
[2:36:16] you can imagine the rest i hope the holy
[2:36:18] spirit revealed to you
[2:36:20] the rest that i cross out here
[2:36:24] praise the lord amen
[2:36:27] now so as as a christian as a believer
[2:36:31] what i'm trying to bring you to the
[2:36:33] place is there for you to know
[2:36:35] the difference between
[2:36:39] the art and
[2:36:42] your personality
[2:36:48] praise the lord and your personality
[2:36:52] who you are the unique design
[2:36:57] that god placed in your life
[2:37:09] praise the lord
[2:37:13] that is the reason why now you see that
[2:37:16] i was going to
[2:37:17] i was really going to go down this this
[2:37:19] way that's that's what i spoke a little
[2:37:21] bit on friendship on wednesday night
[2:37:23] just to be able to uh create some
[2:37:25] protection for myself
[2:37:26] and now so you will see that that's the
[2:37:29] reason why
[2:37:31] when that that relationship of
[2:37:35] friendship
[2:37:36] was very important for redemption
[2:37:41] it's very important for redemption
[2:37:47] amen what the brother branham said
[2:37:50] fellowship was is his two fellow in one
[2:37:52] shape
[2:37:55] praise the lord and that's what
[2:37:57] friendship is
[2:38:00] praise the lord so if the two fellow
[2:38:04] that is in the same shape are having
[2:38:09] good friendship they can have the
[2:38:12] pleasure of their life
[2:38:16] whether they sit on a tree they can talk
[2:38:19] and just
[2:38:20] laugh let out the stress
[2:38:25] they can just laugh they can just
[2:38:28] i mean because they're just so much
[2:38:30] friendship they reject
[2:38:32] so much understanding
[2:38:36] whether they choose to go on a cruise or
[2:38:38] to choose to just walk down the trail
[2:38:41] they can have so much pleasure
[2:38:46] he says there are people that you just
[2:38:48] love to be around
[2:38:50] he said because of the atmosphere they
[2:38:52] create
[2:38:53] you have pleasure with their presence
[2:38:58] pleasure is not an art young people
[2:39:02] don't make nobody make you to make it
[2:39:04] put it in your mind that is an art
[2:39:11] it is the unique character that you
[2:39:14] bring to the family
[2:39:15] all the children are not the same
[2:39:19] there's a unique character that's why we
[2:39:21] must not make all the children the same
[2:39:24] we must be able to appreciate
[2:39:27] their different characteristics
[2:39:32] and bring it to the table and enjoy the
[2:39:35] family banquet
[2:39:38] the unique character that god has given
[2:39:41] you
[2:39:41] for you to be in the family the unique
[2:39:44] character that god has given you
[2:39:46] for you to be a husband to the wife or a
[2:39:49] wife to your husband
[2:39:51] the unique character that god has given
[2:39:53] you
[2:40:03] why did he give you that
[2:40:07] so you can have pleasure
[2:40:11] sometimes i listen to the kids playing
[2:40:13] and they would just
[2:40:14] laugh i just said that i just laughed
[2:40:16] there's just some unique feelings
[2:40:19] that just come true you just say oh my
[2:40:20] goodness you just like what are they
[2:40:22] laughing for you don't know
[2:40:23] but they're just a unique laugh you know
[2:40:25] those people that have
[2:40:28] they have the kind of laughter that
[2:40:30] affect people
[2:40:38] you don't even know what they're
[2:40:39] laughing about but it's just a unique
[2:40:42] sense
[2:40:46] you just start laughing i know a brother
[2:40:48] good friend of mine joe
[2:40:50] we were on a convention and uh we were
[2:40:53] having
[2:40:54] lunch i brought alfred davidson house
[2:40:56] and and
[2:40:57] just from fellowship joe started
[2:40:58] laughing he's the kind of a person like
[2:41:00] that
[2:41:01] i mean he had the whole house laughing
[2:41:03] nobody know what joe is laughing about
[2:41:05] when we in our little cycle that was
[2:41:08] talking
[2:41:09] everybody started laughing because the
[2:41:10] last thought jasper
[2:41:12] is the uniqueness
[2:41:15] the uniqueness that god gave to you
[2:41:20] for you to bring pleasure to people
