good and kind to me it wasn't always there but as as a friend in the he was there to hold my hands and my thanks and word of appreciation gold also uh to the pastor and his family and the whole church thank you for the different support you give me it went a long way and meant a lot for me and my family may God bless you all give and give the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed amen so sister Eunice will be moving to Canada to follow her status so uh uh we want to thank the Lord that uh she was able to so John with us for for the time that she was here and uh what they have been around on some his trip from Trinidad but they've been busy so you have not had the time to come I spoke to him on the weekend he wanted us to bring his greetings and also his appreciation to you as a church for uh I was supporting and uh and the time that sister Eunice spent with us here praise the Lord so we pray that the Lord will bless her and keep her uh as she continued her Endeavors of study praise the Lord Hallelujah and uh I was I was actually thinking on what what to go into this morning I know we've been talking about uh our subject on part of praising that I thought I would preach on praising break this morning but I I have for a while I've just been you know trusting the Lord you'll see that couple of services that I preach I've been trying to get away from their subject and we've been talking about submitting ourselves to the world in different things and as a pastor I will tell you that uh [Music] uh the couple few months is that we this is August is ending year July June August July we we came around a tough time as a church with uh with different things that is happening uh uh around the local assembly and the different families and uh and things and we just been you know uh uh looking to the Lord and to kind of for move in a special way congratulations to you Stephen Wilson sister Kish on your anniversary brother Andrews and uh Sister Christian is also out they called uh also on the uh [Music] uh getaway for their anniversary so we pray that the Lord will also bless them too praise the Lord but in the midst of all of that we can say the Lord has been good to us amen he has given us the grace to to be able to fight through some of these things and and we are keeping we keep fighting praise the Lord I bring greetings from I'm all over the place this morning and I just send my my notes back there so I'm trying to give them few times to be able to catch up with that don't have much to say it I won't want to keep you too long but I really had a good penny custom meeting this weekend amen I was telling brother area and I was I was away there's no projecting you know you know just just old school amen you are now online so you're just free to express yourself the way you feel like you know so we we had a good meeting there we brother Bill Young's and the church amen yeah yeah uh you know those those people uh it's a church and uh they have uh more older people elderly people than uh than younger people then but but most of those people came over from Pentecost into the message you know so uh the the the the gift of the spirit the gift of tongue stay Stayed there with them and I mean social presence Friday night uh you know and I preached some of the shortest time I ever known myself to preach I was just in one hour and the first service less than one hour and but we had a good time amen we had a good time many of the people there believing the Lord uh you know for their children even brother Bill Young's two of his sons you know one of his son that should be helping him uh in the ministry uh uh but two of the boys how they are their their wives went off on them so it kind of put them in the in in a tough spot but just to see that in the midst of all of their struggle they are still serving the lord I mean it's a beautiful thing to see it's a very beautiful thing to see and uh to see how you know the simple way that the Lord can come down and move among these people not even knowing some of the things that the people are dealing with there but the law just gave us such such a liberty to be able to speak and uh you know yeah for the long time never saw myself running down the eye but I was I was just running all over the place amen I think I'm more of a gentleman when I'm home praise the Lord but it was beautiful it was beautiful and after the after the meeting there was a sister that came to me I spoke the last night I spoke on uh rehab Redemption I've preached that year but I took it in the in a different way to be able to help the people that they have had a secret that she didn't know of her secret was predestination amen and uh uh so after after the the service this this sister came to me with you know with uh with tears in her eyes and she wanted to to share something with me and uh and she told me one of the beautiful sweetest stories I've ever heard after the long time she pulled me in the shot and said brother one can I share something with you I said you are free you know what and and uh um and she told me you know I mean almost crying she says I can't remember how many years now but uh she been divorced from her husband you know husband put away and and she said uh you know after the Lord brought her through all of the bitterness and and you know and everything that she did with she said a couple of months ago she said I was just she says yeah I know I mean he have gone whatever life he was living that was up to him I would just uh praying for the Salvation of his soul and uh I was just praying that God would save him you know I never wanted him back after all as a husband I just praying that God was safe and she says I took our wedding picture and I put it on the wall I hang the wedding picture on the wall that I've never done for many years she said I think it was in a week or two her husband called her back apparently he was listening to a message from Cloverdale then he was even listening to a message that brought the biscal preach uh long time ago maybe he was streaming online or so and she said he said that message brought him to his knees and he cried and he cried and he cried and uh and called his wife and you know and and and beg her if he can come back home she says I didn't know what to do because I mean I've lost feeling for this man I was only praying for the Salvation of his soul God that works on both ends praise the Lord she didn't say that I'm just I'm just putting the picture together God that works on both ends was not only dealing with him for the Salvation of his soul but was also dealing with him to come back home praise the Lord I mean they are just brought me to tears and we were both standing there she's crying before me and I'm just on my eyes because we really had a good time we had we had such a presence such a presence that it was hard to even close the service amen but we thank the Lord amen we thank the Lord and and just like I said I mean there are just been different things there's there's uh that we that we've been dealing with as a church and uh uh I think you can see the the the ASU system is down again and the trustees have to make some decisions whether to get a new one and uh with with some future plans that uh we are also making or praying about for the church so uh uh uh I mean that is their call they will have to decide on what to do praise the Lord and uh it is uh not only via call like I said hoping that we can be able to have some a church meeting here during the fall because there are things that we need to talk about as a church praise the Lord amen this place has has uh has been good for us and it is still good for us it is not like we we have overgrown the building but yet we are outgrowing the building in a sense because we we still having uh young people and uh and we trust in the Lord too to continue and to bless us all there are things that we'll have to talk about I would not want to take all of that but then beside that also uh we send a request out for Brother Steve John Bibi and he's been dealing with himself I hope I will have talked to him this morning but uh we will we will be able to share more more of that uh uh concerning himself with you I want to talk to him before I do that and uh I think there's you know why that we also have seen brother uh wanna name this uh but one uh you know has been uh we talk frequently during the week and uh he's just been to the place where oh he's been struggling a little bit with his memory and it's March safe when he stayed closer to home and to his wife so uh uh so I mean just just different things you know uh people uh you know trusting God for a movie in their lives and move in their home and placing their marriages before the Lord and the uh their wives their husbands and different things and out of the ad you see we we come here to church and then uh you know we we think the world is bridge and we go home that is just a little that is just just a little part of of the whole thing that have to do with this church there's a lot that is that is behind the scene praise the Lord amen and uh you know in all of that you know uh I mean even the but in the midst of all of that yes I mean last Sunday after service uh my brother Chacha came to me and uh butchacha actually has been the brother there so I think he have he have hanged around this church for a good while now and uh he and sister Joy uh the older sister Joy used to work to the same place in uh and one I think she wanted to come to church and and it was Brooklyn Center and he was living close by then you know and uh but he dropped her to church and asked if he could come and then since that time he stayed coming praise the Lord amen so but if you remember we have brother Crosby from the UK sometime in match and he was preaching for us and around that time brother Church abroad a prayer request of his sister back in Kenya that was diagnosed with a tumor a stage four cancer then if you have what we actually remind you but Crosby was was preaching and actually he had a picture of of a rat with a cancer cell you know that he was you know that he was going to show so that that prayer request just fell right in line with his message so if you remember all through the service he kept he kept repeating it you know uh you know tell your sister she's healed you know he kept echoing it and he kept echoing it all through the service praise the Lord so NASA uh Sunday after the service you know he came into the office and uh he's actually he's a quiet type of person so he's coming he's as well can I talk to you I said yeah go ahead and you know he's uh he's talking and very quiet lady and and justifying to mean that his sister has been healed completely 100 percent [Applause] praise the Lord then I told him I said is that what you are telling me quietly like this you are telling me that your sister is healed with with a doctor report this is the doctor report [Applause] 100 you are saying that to me and you are so quiet about it praise the Lord [Applause] amen but we want to thank the Lord for that amen we want to thank the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] praise the Lord and and you see with all of that so I I actually wanted to just print this and and keep it so immediately after service I called brother Crosby uh he's uh he's over in Zimbabwe and uh uh and he's he's a funny character praise the Lord and uh you know I call him and then she's then he's he's talking you know he just took the words from my mouth and then started talking he said brother I'm you know I'm practicing my American slang because I'm coming back to visit you and you know hahaha but I think he was grateful praise the lord we share that with him he was he was grateful amen he was he was glad that uh you know the Lord and you know all of those things he have a way of just uh of just encouraging us in amen that God is still among his people that's part of our struggle that's part of the different things that we go through we are serving the Living God that is among his people praise the Lord you know the promise of the rapture the promise of the Rapture when Paul speaks of that in Thessalonian that was going to be the message I was going to preach on Wednesday night over in Tennessee but for some reason you know the Lord had a different he had a different plan Paul said uh in in in uh testimony did that in life and remain praise the Lord two times he said there he said we that are alive and remain how can I overcome brother Brandon says that's what a Revival is a Revival is to keep life in the body praise the Lord they that are alive and remain praise the Lord that's that's our hope that's our strength you have to be alive right that spot whatever you're going through you have to be alive and you have to remain it's two things Jesus said that he that endureth to the end the same shall be safe amen not there that are alive and forsake you know but they that are alive and remain praise the Lord and uh praise the Lord I was when I was down with brother office this young brother uh Francis he preached that that morning and I I caught that inspiration from what he was preaching and I said well I think this is a good thought yeah I might I might take it on my faith rape and just keep it there praise the Lord and find a time so we just want to thank the Lord let's turn to our feet let's stand to our feet and uh I just wanted to share these things with you uh sister Eunice God bless you you travel saving uh let the love of Jesus Christ go with you and keep you praise the Lord and I'm only in this message by Grace let's let's

thank you musicians thank you musicians let's take up the book of collusion praise the Lord let's take the book of collusion chapter one are we together after the book of Philippians let's take chapter one and uh Let's uh let's read uh from verse 12. I got this this uh this tournament on on my heart I got this inspiration uh like I told you sometime here in in September uh uh our dear brother of blessed memory brother uh mirror that went to be with the Lord uh the church has finally settled with one of the the ministers there to be their Pastor so uh uh brother dele will be coming in so after the labor of the weekend meetings the next Wednesday not this coming one but the following one he will be with us he will pray for us Wednesday he will preach for us Sunday and then uh he will go back down to DC and be with the church there they will be doing the voting in of uh uh the the pastor and then after uh they would want to do uh how uh the kind of for inauguration service or or how they call it now I hope I'm using the right word praise the Lord so uh they asked that both of us come and do the services for them so uh uh uh I would just thinking on something or meditating or listening to the word or something like that and this thought dropped on my heart changing hair shape and when it drove up my heart I thought okay maybe Lord that's what you want me to preach for them there and uh because most of the time that's that's that's the way it works with me if I have a service to go and preach preach to fall I prayed about it and and then and sometimes the law will lay something on my heart sometimes all the sepsis messages I would preach sometimes just one message and to me it always gives me that sense of uh confirmation collusion chapter 1 verse 12. so I got this thought to speak on those meetings but then why I was uh I was I was uh waiting on the Lord and thinking about what to talk about uh for some reason a draw they start kind of a drop of my heart so I say well okay uh this is the Home Folks let's let's try with them if it works then it will work that's what amen so yeah uh verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of Darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son he has delivered us a changing of hership he has delivered us from one Kingdom and he has brought us to another kingdom praise the Lord that's what I took the inspiration from who have delivered us from the power of Darkness it's a kingdom amen the power of darkness is a kingdom and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God their firstborn of every creature the Lord bless you you can have your seat while we turn to Romans chapter 7. you know so I I I I I was I was thinking about there because talking about praising break I was thinking on uh uh uh I started I started going back and started looking at different praising different notorious praising and one thing that I found out is that uh uh from every prison you know brother Brian talk about uh [Music] uh I was I was I was looking for it this morning I've read I read it read series of quotes on it and I even uh uh listened to a documentary on that praising it's a notorious present in uh in the U.S uh what orchestras yes yes that's right yes brother but Wesley being around Long amen so uh I can count on him for that that's exactly right brother Wesley brother Brahms spoke on that praising and uh there was a Prison Break that took place from their praising and and the the the the I mean uh because it's it's surrounded you know it's surrounded by body of waters praise the Lord and and I think after the men were caught the the interview them and kind of found out how they were able but this is something that is very very unique with every human prison the praising us are always looking for how to get out I don't care how terrible it is I don't care how they say stuff this place you know nobody can get out from all the praisings most of the presents they have always been a Prison Break praise the Lord men have fine uh uh you know uh uh uh terrible way I mean even even during the Holocaust you know you you you follow the documentary and escape from uh some people you know what it is they were able to dig dig under the Earth and they dig enough to go away from the praising camp the dog under the Earth using spoons and rocks to find their way away from the praising camp where they will be able to bust the Earth open and Escape it's it's just like that you see but as I was thinking about it I was I was trying to find that you know uh uh uh how to relate this you know I've I I really I really you know I'm kind of for working on it pray for me and I'm working on it amen but what I realized is that man has never been able to find a way to to break themselves free from the praising of theirselves praise the Lord just like we said before you are in a cell s call it the cells of your body you are here behind bars of Bones praise the Lord I took that line from uh uh uh the song uh Hills of whom are calling me and uh you you are heading Beyond bars of Bones you are caught up in this body that is made out of cells from your your your your parents grandparents great grandparents and all of that the the your rear identity is is here in there and uh but man has never never been able to break themselves free from the cells of their body praise the Lord amen and uh [Music] that's where my mind was because I was I was standing there during the week and uh I was going to read from the book of Acts how the angel came down and brought Peter out of prison to John Mark house praise the Lord how the angel came down and and break the praise in open for Paul and Silas were the Philippian Jailer would have killed himself one of the first praising and praising of that the Bible recorded was Joseph and we realized that it was Joseph's gift that gave him a Prison Break praise the Lord so which mean it was it was God that did it supernaturally because it is God that give gifts praise the Lord if God never came down and and closed the mouth of the Lions the Lions who have eaten Daniel so it was God that came down and gave Dania a Prison Break are we together amen so uh uh and that's where the story started becoming beautiful for me and I'm I'm thinking it looks like I'm preaching that message but I'm just telling you where where my heart has been praise the Lord I'm just telling you where my heart has been but this morning we want to talk on on uh uh changing hairship Romans chapter 7 let's read from verse 1. Romans chapter 7 let's read from verse 1. praise the Lord no you're not brethrens for I speak to them that know the Lord how that the Lord have dominion over a man as long as he liveth their sport emphasis no bread means that have the Lord has dominion over a man as long as he liveth so what is he going to do he's going to pull something from the law to make that picture clear to us for the woman which have and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he live it but if the husband be dead she is loose from The Lord of her husband so then if why her husband living she be married to another man she shall be called an adulterous but if her husband be dead she is free from their law so that she is no adulteress door she be married to another man wherefore my brethrens yeah also have become dead to the Lord by the body of Christ praise the Lord amen see the contracts here see the way Paul is doing this here he says that the man is dead then the woman is free to be married he said but you brethrens you are dead to the Lord amen you are there to the Lord and in that way we can be married to Christ the Lord so there have to be a change of hairship in the change of headship one influence have to die are we together one influence have to die praise the Lord that's that's where we want that's where we want to put our our emphasis this morning wherefore my brethrens here also I become dead to the Lord the body of Christ that year should be married to another even to him who is Raising from the dead I love that that we should bring bring full fruit onto God now you have to wash now Paul never said therefore graduates the Lord is dead no he never said the Lord is dead are you watching that he said yeah I did unto the Lord are we together it is it is it is it is beautiful place because because the thing about it there is that uh Grace is a progression of the Lord amen Grace is a progression of the law the law was a shadow of good things to come you see that is the reason why when people try to struggle by themselves to get themselves away from legalizing they make a disgrace of the grace of God are we together we are not supposed to serve God on a legalism he says ye are dead unto the Lord praise the Lord the Lord is there the word of God is dead but as you are looking ahead you are not looking at it from the place or for legalistic standpoint praise the Lord you are looking ahead to see the picture the picture of Christ because if you cut it off completely you will not be able to see the perfect Lord of Liberty are we together now so uh uh uh invisible Union this this first quote yet is from invisible Union uh uh I don't I don't have the yeah okay he says here and and it's not directed to anything or any certain person but I'm just read that uh that uh uh he just read that uh uh uh kind of doing something here okay I like to remove my jacket but it looks like if I'm going to preach with jacket on I stay thank you sir I still remember that old mama and she said why do you wear it if you're going to take it off praise the Lord now so brother Branham just read Romans chapter 7. that's where he brought invisible Union message from so he's he's going to deal with this he said it's not directed to any person uh any certain person just to the church the body of Christ that we are trying to to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives praise the Lord you see how he placed that to deeper thoughts and higher objective believing that the coming of the Lord Jesus is a hand Paul here is giving an illustration in our scripture about Lord and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce praise the Lord amen now so he said this passage is very solemn preached on because it's more or less pertained like marriage and their voice but it's also pertain to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he is trying to set in order yet he's trying to set in order that we as a church can no more be married to the word and to Christ at the same time praise the Lord they have to be a change of hairship praise the Lord to be able to have the the the the right and the benefit of of of of of your new life of your new marriage there has to be a change of hairship that's the emphasis here and that's what I want us as a church to pay attention to it's more of what is our hairship who is our headship who are we under as a church who are we under that's what I want for us to pay attention to even even us in our own individual life I mean I've been abroad a bride of Jesus Christ it's not it's not believing brother Branham to be a messenger praise the Lord I would tell you there are a lot of people in the Pentecostal ring that believe that brother Branham was a Vindicated prophet amen they do they they do better on the I believe more than people that are hanging around the message praise the Lord being a bride of Jesus Christ is not just on it when we are baptized in the name of Jesus we take on the name of Jesus but you have to realize there is a hanging Prophecy from Isaiah that in this day seven women will take all to one man and say we only want your name so if your experienced owners stop to water baptism in Jesus name you are only taking his name that that is not enough praise the Lord that is not enough for you to be able to enjoy the benefit of this Union are we together it's not enough to be able to enjoy the benefit of this Union are we together that's what I want for I I want I want to be able to grab a stool where are we having our airship there are some things we're looking to this morning as we trust the Lord he says but but it's also pertained to to a greater portion of marriage and divorce and how he is trying to set in other years that we as a church can no no more be married to the word and to Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it praise the Lord we can never be legal the truth about the matter that is that you will not have the benefit of what it is to be the Bride of Jesus Christ you will not have the benefit to be able to use the father name in prayer and have a result if you are not falling on his headship praise the Lord I mean all of these things that God abound you in Jesus name about you in Jesus you will not have the right you will not have the benefits of using the father name and having a result when when the apostles were were you know when they were challenged with demon-possessed people and and and and and and and a man comes and they get a beautiful Peter could say silver and gold are half man but what I have I give to you in the name of the Lord Jesus rise you see there was completely honored the headship of Jesus Christ they never had a thing twice to use his name you don't have that benefit because you come to a message Church you don't have that benefit because you are born with parents that were in the message like he said he has delivered us from the from the the power of darkness and he has translated us into there has to be a change of headship praise the Lord as a church can no more be married to the word and to Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it then it can be for a woman to be living with with a husband why she got a living husband praise the Lord he says I have my own thought about that and I believe that that's what the Bible says is the truth but I believe also uh it's to my belief that it unfold one of the greatest mystery of Prophecy praise the Lord and what is that what is that mystery the prophecy is concerning the church is a mystery of Prophecy that God is going to deliver the church from legalizing and he's going to translate the church he's going to bring up to the place where Christ will have the preeminence in his church this Rapture in church will fulfill that that scripture in the Bible this rapturing church will fulfill the free for purpose praise the Lord why because in the first purpose God was able to get a man he was able to get a man that he could reveal himself to the second purpose his need to get a church that he can have the full preeminine so there is a prophecy that is hanging over this bride and the way to be able to benefit from that is to be able to have this experience the change of headship amen praise the Lord I mean that's the reason why we we we can sit around and and and and all we can do we can just argue we can sit around and all we can do and we can just see all the things that is happening around the message and sometimes people use that just to give themselves a caution that I mean even though I'm not bad because all of these things are going on but I'm telling you with all of these things that are going on God is still moving on behalf of his people there are people that are experiencing the supernatural of God foreign amen there are people that are experiencing the supernatural of God they are experiencing the benefit because there's a benefit praise the Lord there's a benefit so let's go let's go on a little bit he says uh uh he says it will unfold one of the greatest mystery of Prophecy he speaks here of your Moody after reading Romans chapter 7 he ran into the street and the first man he met he said do you know Grace Amazing Grace how sweet that sound they'll save a rest like me Grace precious Grace and more of Grace To Know praise the Lord for it is by Grace we are safe not by what we can do what what whatever we do is not counter to us Grace is what save us by grace are you safe through faith praise the Lord are we together amen and I saw that's uh that's that's what I want for us to dwell on the this this uh this morning and seeing how that uh uh uh that change of hairship now when you look at it in the natural it is not so easy it is not so easy praise the Lord you just just look at some some uh some uh some natural trench of uh the change of hairship or the change of leadership praise the Lord you find that uh uh uh you you you you can even see that uh uh even when the children change School praise the Lord the being under this teacher the law of the teacher they love their friends when they have to change school they struggle sometimes praise the Lord you will see that uh one of the place we see it the most just like Paul is making us to see here we see it in marriages praise the Lord people leave uh uh uh uh sit and grow in in a church they grow on the assertive leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh uh and then if they have to move I mean it don't comes automatically praise the Lord you never realize that the way you have been taught and the way you grow up to believe things how much it made you how much of that is part of you praise the Lord and sometimes people come and then the the the the the you know the the move to another place they sit there and the local have things are done all through the eyes of the way they were brought up praise the Lord unless the Holy Ghost comes on the scene and illuminate them they can be able to see something that they can reconcile with the word until that happened amen until that happened you will never break away it will always be like I I love the services but I love the way we did things what brings the change is a light on the word when the Holy Ghost can come down and and just Enlighten you and open your eyes and you realize there is more of Grace To Know praise the Lord Hallelujah there is more of Grace to know there is there is there is more of of God to know God people are diverse are we together and the same thing also just like I said in marriages you know we get we we we we get uh we get uh caught up in the law of fever amen we're gonna we go around you know in the law of fever and then after the after the love fever is is over then we we you know we we hit the reality of life praise the Lord now if uh if uh uh in in in in in in both ways if the person had a heart a loving father they're always protected them you know and and always cherish them with love automatically you start to expect that from your husband praise the Lord the truth is you didn't marry your father amen that's the truth you didn't marry your father you have to come to that reality quickly yeah I'm married and not a brother he's not my father amen I mean even even though you can you can you can you can you can you can love him as your father praise the Lord you know so even in the natural in the natural that that little struggle is there we go through that you know you take time to be able to you know you you trust the person you love the person it's not like you are trying to hold back and say I really need to know that on a nature that's how it works why because certain things have to die it's not in the sense that you you are killing the love of your father or you got to disagree with your father no no no that's that's not what it means it's something that happened supernaturally as you as you go together you love one another together you you trust one another and then there's translations start to take place you are moving from one Kingdom over to another kingdom praise the Lord sometimes we think it's automatically and then even even on the other side of the man you know he's he's uh he said well I mean you need to trust me I'm your husband I mean there is not a button for their science have not been able to make one yet there's not a remote control for that all of these things are under the they are under the law that those are the law that God puts in the universe when a seed is poured into the ground it has to die first amen it has to die then before it starts to grow up are we together and that is the thing that I I you know I'm I I I want us to see I want us to realize even when it comes to our personal life you cannot blame the church brother random says God just just need one man or one woman in a local church that is standing with the word amen you can't blame the church and says wow that you know that church they are not on fire that church is so cold what about you what's about you what's your place the effect of our relationship the joy of our relationship comes from the place where the first husband is dead amen and where Paul was talking about your uh uh you have to dive unto the law it's in a place where on our first birth praise the Lord honor our first birth there is a law that we were born on a bonus seat in iniquity equate to gravity to what is wrong that have to die glory be to God if you are having a a place of struggle don't look far don't look far ask yourself am I fully submitted on my headship to Christ the Lord because he promised to protect us he promised to provide for us he promised to be there for us he promised that we have every right to everything that he holds all the heaven Halls belongs to us when we come under that Airship of Christ and just like we struggle in our natural relationship we also struggle in our spiritual relationship that's where Paul was trying to bring the Church of Rome because you have to remember from from from Romans chapter 4 5 he started talking about the righteousness of God that is revealed from Faith to Faith how how can we accept this righteousness of God when our mind is so filled with with with all the things that we have done our mind is so filled with our weaknesses in order how are we going to accept this righteousness that is from faithful we have to die to that you have to crucify that thought that it is no longer either living but Christ that lived in me it's it's an individual work that you you oh yeah because the devil is there he knows and he knows exactly he knows the punches to troll he knows the place to hate you he knows how to remind you are we together the change of hairship because as long as you stay on their first hair shape you're not going anywhere you will not get the benefit let's see what he says here in birth pains I think I have another thing here he says and that's the reason that we have never become a denomination amen the Lord have given us the opportunity to merge this little church in many different denominations inter-denomination people from different denominations that what he means we but we don't do it I mean let me go back there let me take that back again let me take that back and that's the reason that we have never become a denomination the Lord has given us the opportunity to to merge this church in many different denominations he could have joined with different denomination okay I think that's the sense there but we don't do it because we want to stay just like this amen so it can be under the rulership and the hairship of Jesus Christ the Lord amen we would like to stay just like this just like what how we would like to stay with the word amen I will go your father and it says we would like to stay just like this not like the way we are doing things because many things that we are doing is not right it's not right we formulate our own church time we don't come to church on time we have to we just we're just taking it down as you know as a habit you know we formulate our own church time so it is not in a sense we would like it to be just like the No No we want to go from glory to glory we would like it to be a church that will stay with the word so it can be on the rulership and the hardship of Jesus Christ that's right whatever he revealed to us and we see that is the truth and it's line of wave his word all the way back and forth Through the Bible it is not because Cloverdale Believe it or do it so we must do it no it is not because this we must be able to bring it back to the world praise the Lord amen so if you go to a place and it looks like the way they approach things is different don't say they're in charge if you want to learn ask them why you do this praise the Lord why you do this because I mean we have we have rare church order now we get it on our belt okay we we get a blue belt of church order so everywhere we go we just sit down we look over our shoulders it's not a message praise the Lord and people do things different way and and sometimes you appreciate I mean down there in in Tennessee this weekend what I realized is that they have a room that is that is a prayer room and uh uh if you follow the church all the brother Branham says is give the people that you meet and pray together maybe God will break a gift for tongues but what they do is they have to go in their room and have their prayer meeting every service the meat in that room have a prayer meeting and they're right from the prayer meeting they go right into the service and then the service starts well the Lord is Blessing to wash you I change it why should I come and take a message and Lana quotes and said you're not doing it the way brother brand name is brother Brandon I said that you do it the Lord is Blessing it why because it's keeping the people oh oh yeah I mean we must have a time of meditation at the time of meditation The Message Church is the time to clean nails is it time that people use to clean their nails or they use that time to think and some will sit right there on their phone there on Facebook and all of that so what is the benefit of that are you seeing what I'm saying as long as it is lining up with the word praise the Lord as long as I said it's lining up with the word as a church we choose to play tips every every day a Sunday morning to me I think we create something to help your meditation if you are listening if you come to church on time and you are listening to the tip at least it will help your meditation something will be said you will say well let me go back to that message again instead it are we together because the thing that takes the most privilege in the church is the word nothing is above the word nothing is above the word the music don't take the most privilege it's the word that takes the most privilege is because of the word that we are here we must be able to line up our arts and action with the word our emotion must not go above the world you find a bunch of people that are they are so emotional and all of that is you can't even see the word because just like the scripture says the prophet said and I say it again is only the world will produce itself that is the Original Seed of God is the only thing that has the power to reproduce Christ in you it's not my shouting it's not me coming up with a new method and says well let's run around the building let's do a cook out every Saturday maybe God will give us new members praise the Lord if we don't keep a right atmosphere that is back up with a good life God can trust us with people it's God finding places where he can trust people that are the people that are in need it's not just making members just to count the numbers praise the Lord are we together the Lord he says Sierra because we want to stay just like this so it can be under the rulership and the hairship of Jesus Christ that's right whatever he revealed to us and we see it we see that is the truth and a line of with the word all the way back and forth Through the Bible praise the Lord that is wrong all the way back and forth Through the Bible we're playing the message uh uh uh uh uh president of Porter prisoner I think I said that here a couple of nights ago about uh what we do on Wednesday night with our prayer meeting and and I I just listening to that again and uh and I see brother Brown saying he says this is Wednesday night we just come together it's just our way of having a a prayer meeting we just we just come together and just have a short prayer meeting are we together Lana was the word all the way back and forth Through the Bible that it is the truth and the spirit is agreeing on it we have no denomination of Barra to to hold us from accepting that we go right ahead into it and move right on praise the lord we don't have to make report to Jeffersonville we don't have to make report to uh uh DC or New York nor we may report to heaven that's our headquarter praise the Lord if you are if you are a Bible believer if you love the Lord you are in the word if there is something to to question about make sure that you are you is something on the word bring the question says the Bible says this why are we not doing it all we are doing this and the word says this I mean it's now only for this church but anywhere you go if you are if you are a loving believer you go you meet people worshiping respect them for what they believe and how they stand that's how they've been going before you got there you find people that are just flipping around the country around the world they can never have a place to rest because there is just no group that is good for them and they can't even start one of their own it's a bad place to be it's a bad place to be to be to the place where you are not on a hair ship you can never be led by the Holy Spirit if you are not properly on the headship praise the Lord a person will have a place where they can call home where they can call Church a place where they are accountable to praise the Lord I'm accountable to you amen if you if you hear anything about me don't don't be ashamed to come and tell me that's what it's about praise the Lord don't worry I just have one more cut here and then I will I will close this thing up but that's that's that's what that's what I want I want us to see it you see that's the reason why the people the Broadband said they are not getting to Christ the people are not getting to Christ the people are not enjoying the benefit of the word amen there is still healing in the word there is still gifts in the word there is still Deliverance in the word praise the Lord the joy of the Lord is our strength no matter what we are going through God can still bring us a portion of satisfaction praise the Lord when when when boas was down there they had he identified Ruth uh because of her her working and and her faithfulness I mean Ruth was there on time and make sure that the whip Reapers will finish and she will get to gleaning and and he's he told them he says just drop a ballot for a year and drop a ballot for there God is still dropping ballot for his children we don't have to manufacture it there is a law that bring these things to pass we don't have to start another Pentecostal movement let's do a seven day fast let's do a 12-day fast let's do it I mean uh I mean if it's not a bad thing too fast if we want to praise the Lord but we must not carry the church on a hunger strike because we want some kind of a manifestation if there is a need to do it we'll let you know what a need is but it's not to manufacture something praise the Lord as it's right here I've seen the waves that have come in and gone out of this church I've seen the places where God starts to bless us when the People starts to do what is right praise the Lord amen the way churches struggled to come back from the pandemic we never did that as a local church we never did that because even though there was shut down God was able to bless us with an atmosphere where we have service we have fellowship and we kept the atmosphere until the anxiousness of getting back to church was there praise the Lord but then what started happening we start we start slacking off and we start doing different things we start measuring on the mountains instead of sustaining that atmosphere praise the Lord now you see it as as a preacher like I'm not an evangelist so I'm not built that way I'm not built that way the way I'm built is to constantly wave this world before you say look this is what the world said let's do it and when we do it we will get the result that's the way I'm built I'm not built to come and start whipping you people are backslotting people I'm not built that way if a person preached that way it's not wrong if they are built that way praise the Lord I want the world to grab your attention I want you to the world to grab your mind you bring it back to yourself and says yeah you know in this place I'm not fully submitting to Christ I need to submit to Christ in in in you know in my home or in my finances I'm not submitting to Christ I meet up because there is no way out of it God can bless you out of his Lord he can bless you out of his Lord praise the Lord if the power of God will move in this place God will have to have people that are paying attention to what he's doing praise the Lord that's what I want you to see Christ is the mystery of God revealed this will be my last one foreign I don't know yet God living among his people doing the same thing then you can recognize the hair shape in Rome our hairship is in heaven I'm not going to Rome I'm going to heaven when I die see the hair ship is in heaven and where is heaven heaven is consists of the word Heaven is consist of the word not the galaxies of the word fulsive brand says Heaven is consists of the word so what what is that our hairship bringing ourselves in subjection toward the word everything we are doing we must consider what the word says about it now how I feel about it or what I think about it what the word says about it cannot can I fit this thing in the word can I fit this thing in the word because just like Paul says uh uh uh uh uh uh you know a woman there has to be a change of hair shape and I'm telling you that's where the bride is getting told people that are dropping off the message here is all because they are struggling with the word they are struggling with the word the pressure of this word is just is just it's pressing people in so much that they are struggling with the word I heard a beautiful story of lots of of Max Lucado this morning as I was meditating and this story was all about uh uh uh uh a father that will always have a dance with his daughter on Christmas Eve no not his daughter sorry his wife you always have a dance with his wife on Christmas Eve and and why they would do that then says his his little girl will be looking at him praise the Lord and I could just imagine as I was listening to that how she goes in the room and and she's practicing all the steps and everything praise the Lord and and mama was not around and and the little girl came to to Daddy and says and Christmas Eve he says he says Daddy can I dance with you he said oh sure it surprised him though praise the Lord but he said show and and then when he when he started when he started dancing with his little girl he realized oh my God oh my God she got all the steps praise the Lord but you see what happened afterwards the other uh that little girl uh seen her parents dancing she will block herself in the room and dance and dancing and and I mean she was just she was kind of overcome with dance until when she grew up she started slipping away from the house and started going for dance party before she realized the wrong Spirit got her she started becoming a club dancer and she went away from home so Daddy will write a letter and sent it to her and because of the guilt that she was feeling that I learned this thing this thing was was special to my daddy because that's what Mama did to him now that Mama has gone want to be with the Lord also how breaking daddy heart is you know when and and but she she you know she she felt so guilty that she she would not even look in the word she would not even read the message she would not read a letter she just stacked them up and stacked them up and stacked them up in one bed she received a letter from her dad and this time there was no there was no postal stamp on the envelope she just saw on the message on the envelope from your dad with no poster stem she knew exactly that Daddy was in town so she opened the letter and when she read it daddy says I know where you are I know what you are doing but can you come home oh no he says I've sent you series of letters with no response but my message is still the same can you come home and dance with Daddy praise the Lord as soon as she read that she felt a conviction to go back and read the rest of the messages that she was talking you see then and then as I was listening to that I I I I feel like it's it's the same praise the Lord he have he have sent us messages we have we have uh we have we have the word translated in different form we have all thousand messages that was preached by a prophet a Vindicated prophet amen you see that the thing about it there is that uh uh uh maybe if brother Branham was alive it would looks like brother Branham it's it's the one that we have our hair shaped no it's he's not alive and we cannot use a dead man to have our Airship our Airship is from Christ the Lord that is just the order of the scripture you go back in the book of Arts you'll find there the Bible says Moses was read in all the he was read in all the synagogues Moses was read why because he was their prophet amen they knew he was a vedicated prophet so you see this NAD it's not having a dead man as our hair shape no it's because everything we read from this course we look at it from the scripture is in line with the scripture and God sent us his word and he deals with our heart they are things that we are doing there and and it brings conviction to our heart we don't want to go home and dance with Daddy it keeps taking us away from our prayer life because we feel guilty so we stay away from prayer we feel guilty and we stay away from church we feel guilty and we found other things to occupy ourselves but the message have not changed the message have not changed come home and dance with Daddy the message have not changed are we together let the musicians come forth there has to be a change of headship praise the Lord some people are so caught up on their own hair shape that they cannot move away from it they can move away from it and what brother Brandon says you are you are living in a glad you are living in the light of a past day daddy message shall not change no matter what we are dealing with no matter what we are struggling with no matter where our battle is I believe that is the thing that must push us to the word if you really believe in the word you believe the power that is in the word you believe that that Deliverance is in his presence no matter how what whatever the devil throw in our way that is the thing that must make us to run in in the Old Testament they were wrong to the City of Refuge they will not run away from it they were wrong to the center of the Refuge and cry for mercy and look for help [Music] the message does not change we can say it's those days [Music] no for the prisoner that's the tip that I've been playing but Abraham says what is happening is there we have lost our level of sincerity to the thing that we believe that's what is happening [Music] we we are we are learning to give ourselves more reason [Music] we give ourselves a reason why we must stay away from church we give ourselves a reason why we must not pray oh I'm tired or I'm tired you realize you don't have a prayer life sometimes you have to fight a truth sometimes you have to cry God I need to feel your presence once again touch my heart [Music] change my heart oh Lord make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you oh change my heart

preeminence it's a message of preeminence the people that can fully trust God [Music] people back in fully trust God we have a word let's let's play Softly we have a word that is going down we have an economy that is very uncertain and we have all of these things around us people [Music] but we also have a god that is in control we have a god that want us to experience his Supernatural a God that can still feel the meal flower a God I can still bring the crush of oil the god that can still turn the bit of water to Sweet we still have a God and he want us to experience his Supernatural [Music] is only going to combat summation it's only going to come by summation foreign [Music] let's go to school but don't allowed any of those things to take preeminence in your life let that place of Christ walk around your schedule to be in church unless it does not work okay but but don't lose the desire of being in church because that's what God bless if the desire is there in you he will bless it [Music] if you cannot walk around your schedule he will make your schedule work around you [Music] if the desire is there give him his rightful place [Music] he don't want to be the one among

to commune with God are you happy are you are you are you really having communion with the Lord can you talk to him as friends with friends are you are you I I say at a place that you are just so bother with guilt but you we have an advocate we have a one that can settle the guilt problem foreign [Music] the same God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the god of Daniel and the boys are burning God and all of these guys that we read about he's the same God that we are we are serving he's the same God in our midst this morning he's the same God that is bringing his word to us Lord has your devotion has your dedication to the Lord in your fine eyes the Catholic system has taught the people to depend on the church no go back to the book of Acts the church depends on the people and the people that make the church how it is to support the church but you see if if you if we don't have that place of commitment to God in Fellowship you will not be bothered about those things I mean you don't you you I mean to your local church yeah you can support your local church with your ties and offering that's what the Bible says but even beyond that you have people that are that are involved in little missions here then and and they are involved in in supporting the little work things that do astrally because they have a burden on their heart to do something for God I know my my I'm I'm supposed to be dedicated to my local church I pay my tithes and offering but but beyond there there are other things that I do and I do it because of the love of God foreign of Darkness he has delivered us from the kingdom of darkness now he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son let's support the kingdom cause [Music] now that God is going to have a people he already have a people you already have a people there has to be a change of headship we cannot keep going the way that we are going we cannot keep going the way we are going [Music] Solomon says blessing you can't say God is blessing you and then you are just you are you are just combo with bunch of Sorrow [Music] you become a person of a sorrowful spirit [Music] that's what I wanted for us to see this morning church God has given
