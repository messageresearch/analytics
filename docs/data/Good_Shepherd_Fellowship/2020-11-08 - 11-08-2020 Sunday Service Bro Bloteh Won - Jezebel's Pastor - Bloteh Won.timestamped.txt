[52:21] that's my message i will be speaking on
[52:24] and
[52:25] uh but i thought that
[52:28] it was would be a good thing for us to
[52:30] play their message jesse bear religion
[52:33] and uh i think a few of the believers
[52:37] put that little clip that we show
[52:39] and and and the reason that i showed
[52:42] that
[52:43] uh is is more than politics
[52:48] the reason i showed that is because we
[52:51] are
[52:51] in a serious time amen
[52:55] we are in a serious time the word of god
[52:58] this message that we have carried in
[53:00] book form
[53:01] tape phone on our phones sd card
[53:05] and water view is the message of god
[53:08] amen
[53:09] given to us by the prophet and god's
[53:12] word can never fail
[53:14] those are some of the things we want to
[53:15] talk about this morning
[53:17] you know with the nation just coming out
[53:20] of an
[53:20] election i was going to speak on
[53:22] something but a few weeks ago this
[53:25] thought came to my mind
[53:27] just just like many of my notes this
[53:30] message
[53:31] i don't know how many years i had it
[53:34] i had a notes together
[53:38] i lost them
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] because i was updating something on my
[53:44] on my
[53:44] on my ipad and and i kind of deleted it
[53:48] and then a few weeks ago the talk came
[53:49] back to me
[53:50] so i had to go back and do some
[53:52] searching
[53:53] and uh there was there was a way i
[53:56] wanted to talk about it but then i felt
[53:57] impressed this morning
[53:59] to talk about it right after
[54:02] uh i wanted for it to be my new year
[54:04] message
[54:06] but i failed to talk about it because
[54:09] seeing the way that uh prophecies
[54:12] uh beginning to fulfill or prophecies
[54:15] are already fulfilling not beginning
[54:17] they're being fulfilled and every day
[54:19] we are stepping right into prophecy amen
[54:22] so uh uh
[54:24] that's those are some of the things we
[54:25] want to talk about but one of the things
[54:27] that is that
[54:28] we have started playing uh tapes for
[54:31] for uh sunday school and
[54:34] uh and you know with uh
[54:38] with all of the assets that we have you
[54:40] know you can play them
[54:42] on your way to to church you can come in
[54:45] and listen
[54:46] and uh um but i
[54:50] i don't know whether it is just that 45
[54:53] minutes
[54:54] you know a few hours and i know some of
[54:56] you i
[54:57] cut into it i know some of you try to
[54:59] run yet and sit down
[55:01] and be able to use the plane of that tip
[55:04] and just get your mind and spirit ready
[55:06] for the for the service but i will say
[55:09] one thing to you
[55:11] and uh the truth about it did
[55:15] is that you know we we
[55:18] we don't have a message i don't have a
[55:21] message
[55:23] the message is is was given to us by
[55:27] god's prophet
[55:28] praise the lord and when we play those
[55:31] tapes
[55:32] we are not playing it just to feel the
[55:34] time
[55:36] no we don't want to just to cover the
[55:38] time because we don't have nothing to do
[55:40] so let's just fill the time
[55:42] we are playing those tapes because
[55:45] rapturing faith are on those tapes
[55:48] we are playing those tapes because uh uh
[55:52] uh that that was god's voice to us
[55:56] in this age and uh and
[56:00] and we want to encourage you to listen
[56:03] to the tapes we are doing there to be
[56:06] able to stir
[56:07] out stir up you know an
[56:11] appetite if you have it amen
[56:14] if you don't have it there is nothing we
[56:15] can do i mean i mean there is nothing i
[56:18] know that i can be able to do
[56:19] to me but if you have an appetite you
[56:22] know when
[56:23] you know you you play you do a tape
[56:25] service people complain well i can
[56:26] listen to tip at home i don't need to
[56:28] come to church to listen to tech
[56:30] but yeah they stay home and they don't
[56:32] listen to things
[56:34] you know they don't listen to ted so uh
[56:37] uh we want to encourage you you know you
[56:40] listen to those tapes and
[56:41] and it's just we just take out a 30
[56:44] minutes
[56:45] session but uh take the name of the
[56:47] table go home listen to it
[56:50] and i mean if you listen to it you come
[56:52] back and listen to it
[56:53] then you start to get a line of talk
[56:57] you know and that's what we want to
[56:59] achieve
[57:00] and we have uh in our our youth
[57:04] fellowship we have also started
[57:06] uh our tape uh
[57:09] listening also to be able to encourage
[57:12] the young people
[57:13] we put a little uh context to it i mean
[57:16] you know young people we like
[57:18] competition
[57:19] so we put a little competition to a quas
[57:23] you know uh just so we can be able to
[57:25] teach ourselves to pay attention
[57:28] that just the only purpose i don't have
[57:30] a gold medal to give anybody
[57:33] it's just to help you to pay attention
[57:36] that's why we put their little part of
[57:38] it the amen
[57:40] praise the lord and so right after the
[57:44] service today we
[57:45] will come back and we'll be having
[57:47] another youth meeting to prepare for our
[57:50] next set of tape that we'll be listening
[57:52] to
[57:53] and
[57:58] i want to say thanks to someone gave us
[58:00] a sign
[58:01] for the for the pastor office i was
[58:04] trying to figure out
[58:05] who is there but it's it's
[58:09] brother jordan told me the person want
[58:11] to be
[58:12] and the person don't want to be known
[58:15] and
[58:18] i have multiple peoples on my mind but
[58:21] i've not narrowed it down
[58:22] so that's what it took me a little bit
[58:24] long and
[58:26] uh but it's okay we we appreciate it
[58:29] and the words are thoughtful
[58:32] and we hope that god will be able to
[58:34] help us to live up to it praise the lord
[58:37] amen so uh uh
[58:41] we i think those are just a few things
[58:45] we wanted to remind ourselves
[58:48] that you know and uh the lord bless you

[1:02:35] amen praise the lord the lord bless you
[1:02:39] actually as we said we want to
[1:02:42] uh speak on jesse bears
[1:02:46] pastor jesse bass pastor
[1:02:50] praise the lord amen
[1:02:54] like i said i had i had this talk on my
[1:02:57] mind now
[1:02:58] and uh i wanted to
[1:03:02] to uh speak it to the church i was going
[1:03:06] to go in a different direction
[1:03:08] than what i'm i'm feeling late to go in
[1:03:11] or what i'm i'm burdened with this
[1:03:13] morning
[1:03:14] but uh uh my thought here
[1:03:17] was the other uh uh faith
[1:03:21] it's a soft since 1947 brother branham
[1:03:24] said this i don't know if
[1:03:26] this is one of the first messages on
[1:03:27] tape but uh
[1:03:30] it's one of the first so uh he says this
[1:03:33] year
[1:03:34] and he says and and there was
[1:03:37] elijah and he was god's gift to
[1:03:40] ezra you believe it
[1:03:44] he was even ahab's pastor
[1:03:48] he was jesse bell's pastor
[1:03:51] she didn't want to admit that
[1:03:54] he was her pastor but
[1:03:58] he was the man who told her
[1:04:02] where she was living now only her house
[1:04:06] addressed
[1:04:06] by her way of life amen
[1:04:10] praise the lord that's right he
[1:04:14] was her pastor she hated him
[1:04:17] but yet he was god's provided gift for
[1:04:20] her
[1:04:21] down there to let her know her sins
[1:04:27] and she fell to see him you know what
[1:04:30] i'm speaking about
[1:04:33] amen are we together
[1:04:36] now so my line of thought here
[1:04:41] is that in my mind when i first thought
[1:04:43] about this many years ago
[1:04:46] uh uh what hit me is the other
[1:04:49] or what what what kind of a kind of a
[1:04:52] pickup
[1:04:52] in my spirit is that
[1:04:56] if you look at uh koran
[1:05:00] and dayton honor moses ministry
[1:05:04] amen moses went down there to egypt
[1:05:08] they saw all the all the signs all the
[1:05:10] miracle
[1:05:11] and uh uh you know and
[1:05:14] you know they saw the plague falling
[1:05:17] from the beginning they were some of the
[1:05:20] group that resisted moses
[1:05:23] but after they started to see the
[1:05:24] supernatural and he saw god
[1:05:27] you know moving in the camp of the of
[1:05:29] the of the egyptians
[1:05:31] they decided to be quiet it is not that
[1:05:34] they came
[1:05:34] to full understanding to accept moses
[1:05:38] as a leader but they kept quiet
[1:05:41] and they only kept they kept quiet for a
[1:05:44] while
[1:05:45] just to wait until there was a problem
[1:05:48] then they come and say we said it
[1:05:52] it's not because i was not talking but
[1:05:54] i've always been watching this guy
[1:05:59] i've never trusted him from the
[1:06:00] beginning
[1:06:02] praise the lord as long as there were
[1:06:05] there were plagues falling
[1:06:06] you know uh uh you know uh you know
[1:06:10] i mean they were quiet but when he got
[1:06:13] to the rescue i said it
[1:06:14] we are going to die he brought us here
[1:06:16] to carry us
[1:06:18] the egyptians are behind us
[1:06:21] when the red sea open praise the lord
[1:06:23] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:06:25] it was just the trial of our faith
[1:06:28] praise the lord
[1:06:29] when we get in the wilderness there is
[1:06:31] no food i told you people
[1:06:33] this guy was up to something
[1:06:38] it's always like that god has always
[1:06:41] right from the garden of eden the
[1:06:44] serpent the devil was sitting honor
[1:06:46] adam's ministry
[1:06:51] god has always kept him like that
[1:06:54] because
[1:06:55] he want to keep his heavens on their
[1:06:58] knees
[1:07:00] he will always keep somebody like that
[1:07:03] under elijah's ministry
[1:07:07] john the baptist he had herald and
[1:07:10] herod's
[1:07:12] under his ministry they came to his
[1:07:15] church
[1:07:16] harold appreciated his preaching but
[1:07:18] herodotus was mad with him
[1:07:21] praise the lord amen david had his own
[1:07:25] son
[1:07:25] absalom under his ministry jesus had
[1:07:28] judas under his ministry
[1:07:31] peter had ananias and sapphira sitting
[1:07:33] right under his ministry
[1:07:38] praise the lord and
[1:07:41] i and i could go when i first uh
[1:07:44] uh felt inspired with this message it
[1:07:47] was more like a kind of
[1:07:49] evangelistical message that was the way
[1:07:52] i could go but
[1:07:53] uh it has been many years now
[1:07:58] amen uh we we
[1:08:01] uh so we just uh what what where's my
[1:08:04] mind is yet is this let me go to this
[1:08:06] straight
[1:08:07] you know we play jesse bear religion and
[1:08:09] brother branham talking about all of
[1:08:10] those things you know the history of
[1:08:12] america
[1:08:13] now where my mind is with this message
[1:08:15] is that
[1:08:16] we just read uh revelation chapter
[1:08:20] chapter
[1:08:21] three onto the angel of the church of
[1:08:24] laodicea
[1:08:25] brother branham was not just only a
[1:08:27] prophet to the bride he was an
[1:08:29] age prophet he was a dispensational
[1:08:33] prophet
[1:08:35] amen and and as a dispensation of
[1:08:38] prophet
[1:08:39] uh he was a pastor to the age
[1:08:46] he was a pastor to the age and
[1:08:51] during the time of his ministry while he
[1:08:53] was here
[1:08:54] the people enjoyed the miracle they
[1:08:57] enjoyed the discernment
[1:08:58] and that when he came to the world they
[1:09:01] had a
[1:09:01] great problem with him but one because
[1:09:04] of his level of education that he didn't
[1:09:06] have no
[1:09:07] bible school certificate so they had
[1:09:09] problem with him and secondly because he
[1:09:12] was not of popular opinion
[1:09:14] and so
[1:09:18] you know they have problem but where i'm
[1:09:20] going to with this
[1:09:21] is that you know is god that told
[1:09:25] israel that i will give you a pastor
[1:09:28] after my heart
[1:09:30] amen in the book of jeremiah it said
[1:09:34] that i'll give you a pastor
[1:09:38] of my heart in jeremiah chapter 3 verse
[1:09:41] 16 the bible says
[1:09:43] it will come to pass when ye be
[1:09:46] multiply and increase in the land in
[1:09:49] those days said the lord
[1:09:51] they shall say no more the
[1:09:54] act of the covenant of
[1:09:57] the lord now when god was leading these
[1:10:01] people
[1:10:02] through moses to build a tabernacle and
[1:10:04] we know they had the act of the covenant
[1:10:06] now the tabernacle could move as israel
[1:10:09] moved the move of the tabernacle they
[1:10:10] moved with the ark of the coveting
[1:10:12] the arc of the covenant was was was
[1:10:15] representing the presence of god
[1:10:17] in the camp of israel amen
[1:10:20] it was representing the presence of god
[1:10:23] in the camp of israel we saw that
[1:10:25] in the book of samia you know when they
[1:10:27] took the act of the covenant the people
[1:10:29] shouted
[1:10:30] and and and the feelings they said
[1:10:32] what's happening they said their god is
[1:10:34] in their camp
[1:10:35] so the act of the covenant was
[1:10:37] representing the presence of god
[1:10:39] but here god is giving jeremiah the
[1:10:41] promise that i'm going to take that away
[1:10:44] amen i'm going to bring my presence in a
[1:10:47] different way
[1:10:50] praise the lord jeremiah chapter
[1:10:53] 23 verse 4 and i will set
[1:10:57] up shepherds over them that will
[1:11:00] feed him and they shall fear
[1:11:03] no more not be dismayed neither shall
[1:11:07] they
[1:11:08] be lacking said the lord so we see a
[1:11:11] change
[1:11:12] here god is saying no more you will say
[1:11:15] the act of the confident
[1:11:17] but now i'm going to i'm going to build
[1:11:21] a man on the under the new car that i'm
[1:11:23] going to i'm going i'm going to
[1:11:25] i'm going to reveal myself
[1:11:29] amen i would set shepherds
[1:11:32] over them now so
[1:11:35] uh we we see all of that and then uh
[1:11:39] uh it was more uh uh
[1:11:43] uh a covenant it was more the promise
[1:11:47] because we know right here jeremiah came
[1:11:50] in a time of of a captivity
[1:11:54] and and and when israel went in this
[1:11:57] captivity
[1:11:59] then god started
[1:12:02] a gentile dispensation in a sense he
[1:12:04] started dealing with the gentile
[1:12:06] politically
[1:12:08] not religiously are we together
[1:12:12] are you understanding what i'm going
[1:12:14] amen he started dealing with the
[1:12:16] gentiles by the dream
[1:12:18] of nebuchadnezzar interpret by daniel
[1:12:22] amen so slowly
[1:12:25] so you can see that this promise will be
[1:12:28] more
[1:12:28] fitting for for the gentile church than
[1:12:31] the jewish church
[1:12:34] are we together praise the lord now so
[1:12:38] uh uh uh when when when when when jesus
[1:12:42] came
[1:12:42] he started uh you know the language
[1:12:44] other sheeps that i have that are not of
[1:12:46] this fall
[1:12:47] he spoke to peter female lambs you know
[1:12:49] and he started out of there he started
[1:12:51] slowly
[1:12:52] that was the shepherd that jeremiah was
[1:12:55] talking about
[1:12:56] amen so
[1:13:00] just like the act of the coveting was to
[1:13:03] israel
[1:13:05] jesus the chief shepherd
[1:13:09] is to the church are we together
[1:13:14] praise the lord amen
[1:13:17] we want to we want to establish this
[1:13:19] before
[1:13:20] we we go we go further here so
[1:13:23] so the new testament church you know
[1:13:27] started started that way not having the
[1:13:31] act of the coveting and uh
[1:13:33] you know uh the tabernacle because this
[1:13:35] was a new dispensation
[1:13:37] you know while uh peter rose up as as
[1:13:40] as the leader in in all of that so we
[1:13:43] see
[1:13:43] here you know uh uh uh slowly
[1:13:47] that uh you know uh uh then paul became
[1:13:50] the messenger
[1:13:51] to the gentile and that he was not only
[1:13:54] a prophet messenger but god had to allow
[1:13:56] him to come back to the efficient church
[1:13:58] age
[1:13:59] and he the efficient church not the
[1:14:01] efficient church age
[1:14:02] the efficient church and he pastored the
[1:14:05] church for the y
[1:14:06] amen you know he stayed with the people
[1:14:09] there
[1:14:11] and uh you know uh and
[1:14:14] and we see all the different the
[1:14:16] different churches
[1:14:17] now i uh uh
[1:14:21] talking about this that is the place
[1:14:24] where
[1:14:25] i i you know i got a little bit i got a
[1:14:28] little bit
[1:14:28] caught up you know in the ticket
[1:14:33] amen because it's it's uh it's hard to
[1:14:37] talk about this and don't establish
[1:14:39] certain things
[1:14:43] and so let me let me step back a little
[1:14:45] bit and and
[1:14:46] and trust the law to be able to help
[1:14:48] when god was leading
[1:14:50] israel he led israel
[1:14:55] by his presence amen
[1:14:58] then the people desired a prophet
[1:15:03] so god's leadership to israel was always
[1:15:07] a prophet a priest and a king
[1:15:12] are we together now when you go back
[1:15:16] and listen to the message why it had to
[1:15:19] be
[1:15:19] shepherds brother branham identified all
[1:15:24] of those three
[1:15:25] offices as god's provision to
[1:15:28] israel to shepherd them he says moses
[1:15:32] the prophet shepherd
[1:15:36] he said david the king shipper
[1:15:40] so god even even on at the time of the
[1:15:45] judges
[1:15:47] the georges was another temporary
[1:15:50] provision
[1:15:51] where god raised up a man
[1:15:54] to to defend his people like the
[1:15:56] shepherd would defend the sheep
[1:15:59] amen so samson was a george shepherd
[1:16:03] same guy
[1:16:04] was a george shepherd we know it was a
[1:16:06] time where
[1:16:07] where there was no prophet in the land
[1:16:09] so but god had to raise man
[1:16:13] praise praise the lord amen i hope you
[1:16:16] follow my talk here because i'm
[1:16:18] i'm i'm trying as i'm saying this i'm
[1:16:20] trying to go
[1:16:21] in a way here to be able to establish
[1:16:24] something
[1:16:25] but so just like how the jewish
[1:16:28] church had a prophet a priest and a king
[1:16:32] and in the time where there was no
[1:16:34] prophet god used men like george's to be
[1:16:37] able to govern his people
[1:16:39] so the gentile church has
[1:16:42] a five-fold ministry
[1:16:46] the fire for ministry inefficient was
[1:16:50] given
[1:16:50] to shepherd the church
[1:16:54] it's true that in that ministry there is
[1:16:57] a gift called a pastor
[1:17:01] praise the lord a pastor could be a gift
[1:17:05] it could be a title
[1:17:11] but the fight for ministry that is the
[1:17:13] reason of the fight for ministry
[1:17:16] to shepherd the people amen
[1:17:20] praise the lord amen and i mean i'm i'm
[1:17:24] i'm straightened off yet a little bit
[1:17:26] but that's fine
[1:17:27] and uh so we we see that
[1:17:32] we see there through the through the
[1:17:34] ages you know where paul
[1:17:35] right over there in talking to timothy
[1:17:38] if a man desired the bishop
[1:17:40] the office of a bishop which of course
[1:17:42] paul you know was said it like that
[1:17:45] and uh i mean there there are there are
[1:17:47] a lot of things
[1:17:48] that have gone around that have that
[1:17:51] have been praising the minds of god's
[1:17:53] people
[1:17:55] praise the lord and sometimes all of
[1:17:57] those things
[1:17:58] has been in the way to be able
[1:18:02] to put people you know on a kind of for
[1:18:05] nicolithian spirit
[1:18:07] and and equality and doctrine amen
[1:18:10] praise the lord
[1:18:11] you know that you know i mean all sorts
[1:18:13] of things i can go into them this
[1:18:14] morning and go into different doctrine
[1:18:16] but i'm not here
[1:18:17] for for doctrine award amen praise the
[1:18:20] lord
[1:18:22] and uh but what what i'm saying here is
[1:18:24] that it's a principle of god
[1:18:27] the reason there is because he is the
[1:18:30] shepherd
[1:18:32] just like he had a prophet to lead his
[1:18:34] people
[1:18:35] a king to lead his people but he was
[1:18:37] doing the leading
[1:18:40] that's just how the five-fold ministry
[1:18:43] is
[1:18:47] praise the lord you could sit on a man
[1:18:49] that has an evangelistic
[1:18:51] gift but he's the pastor of the church
[1:18:54] he's your shepherd
[1:18:56] god has thy gift there to lead the
[1:18:58] church
[1:19:05] are we together
[1:19:10] is the work of the chief shepherd
[1:19:15] is the promise that god made in jeremiah
[1:19:20] when god said i would take away the act
[1:19:22] of the covenant and give you a shepherd
[1:19:24] he was not talking about a man he was
[1:19:27] talking about
[1:19:28] a gift that would lead the people and
[1:19:30] that is the reason why i believe
[1:19:33] you cannot be successful in helping
[1:19:36] someone to christ
[1:19:37] until you have a shepherd heart
[1:19:42] until you have a shepherd hat you don't
[1:19:45] have to be a preacher
[1:19:47] you don't have to be a preacher
[1:19:53] praise the lord that's why we have to be
[1:19:56] sheeps because as long as we stay at
[1:20:00] ships
[1:20:01] we can soon we can we can quickly get a
[1:20:04] shepherd hat
[1:20:07] i know i'm i'm i'm i'm traveling on a
[1:20:11] gravel road this morning
[1:20:13] you know men can take out guns and
[1:20:16] shoot me with different cults praise the
[1:20:18] lord
[1:20:25] you know so the thing about it there is
[1:20:28] that
[1:20:29] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:20:31] said god give you a pastor
[1:20:33] you must be happy amen praise the lord
[1:20:36] and we can talk about the
[1:20:38] different things to be able to identify
[1:20:39] what actually the ministry is
[1:20:41] but it's it's too diff one of the major
[1:20:43] thing there is a shepherd
[1:20:45] you must be able to find it amen
[1:20:49] because men have shepherd office but
[1:20:51] they have you know
[1:20:52] uh highlands heart
[1:20:55] paul says that grievous wolves shall
[1:20:58] come
[1:21:00] and out of the air instead of feeding
[1:21:03] the sheep the feet of the sheep
[1:21:05] they eat them
[1:21:08] they eat or eat their money or they eat
[1:21:10] them raw
[1:21:14] what am i talking about how did i got
[1:21:15] into this
[1:21:19] i think we need to bow our heads and
[1:21:21] pray
[1:21:24] and lord i'm out of track this morning
[1:21:26] brother scared i don't know how i got
[1:21:28] him today i'm supposed to be talking
[1:21:31] about jesse there pastor now your pastor
[1:21:34] you have to find your pastor brother man
[1:21:36] i'm identified jesse bear pastor
[1:21:38] it's jesse bell pastor i'm supposed to
[1:21:40] be talking about brother ward
[1:21:43] i know jesse be a pastor i don't know
[1:21:45] your pastor
[1:21:50] oh my goodness me praise the lord
[1:21:53] because you know just like a pastor you
[1:21:56] have a shepherd hat
[1:21:57] also you know uh uh it's not because you
[1:22:01] are in a church
[1:22:02] means that that man is your pastor
[1:22:06] some people i say they blame you some
[1:22:08] people can never be pastor
[1:22:11] not the man not the pastor not some
[1:22:13] people some sheeps can never be
[1:22:15] laid
[1:22:18] they can never be led they can never be
[1:22:20] they can never be pastored they can
[1:22:22] never be honored a pastor
[1:22:25] because they are sheep and pastor at the
[1:22:27] same time
[1:22:31] they have pastored themselves so long
[1:22:33] that it's hard to pastor them
[1:22:41] oh yeah one brother told me
[1:22:44] one time he says brother one brother
[1:22:46] brandon says choosing of a bride
[1:22:48] you know that we choose our pastor i say
[1:22:50] yeah you don't you you or you also have
[1:22:52] to know that it goes around
[1:22:54] if you choose me as a pastor i have a
[1:22:56] right to accept or reject
[1:23:02] it's not because you choose me i said
[1:23:03] pastor i say yeah brother yeah the
[1:23:05] brother of adam said
[1:23:07] i said no it goes around what he said in
[1:23:11] marriage and divorce that when you
[1:23:13] choose the person can accept
[1:23:15] or reject so don't come and put me on
[1:23:19] the wall that i choose you as a pastor
[1:23:28] but this is this is very this is very
[1:23:30] sensitive we
[1:23:32] talk out of this trying to farm a ground
[1:23:34] right here
[1:23:36] because it's very important that is the
[1:23:38] problem with this
[1:23:39] age that is the problem with america
[1:23:46] that is that is the problem with our age
[1:23:50] brother madam said in the church book
[1:23:52] that when god sent a messenger like we
[1:23:54] read from revelation chapter 3
[1:23:56] verse 14 when god sent a messenger
[1:24:00] he sent a messenger to the people of the
[1:24:03] age
[1:24:03] and also to the elect he said in every
[1:24:07] in every age the message that comes to
[1:24:10] the messenger
[1:24:11] there's a message for the age and there
[1:24:14] is a message for the inlet
[1:24:19] so there is a message in a message
[1:24:26] you are lukewarm you you are a rich
[1:24:29] that is a message to laudisha the
[1:24:32] message to the inlet
[1:24:34] is repaint
[1:24:38] that's the message to the ilit she will
[1:24:41] pick that up
[1:24:46] are we together you know so
[1:24:50] uh uh that's i mean as as we as we talk
[1:24:54] about this
[1:24:56] the reason did is that uh
[1:25:00] brother branham says some things back in
[1:25:02] 1956
[1:25:04] you know uh uh uh
[1:25:08] 50 years after the penny custer revival
[1:25:14] you know you know what one of the
[1:25:15] problem of this
[1:25:17] age one of the problem of the age
[1:25:20] and and and and the people in the age
[1:25:23] is because like i said to someone before
[1:25:26] you know all of our churches that we we
[1:25:28] met
[1:25:30] all of the churches that we met that we
[1:25:32] went to before we came to the message
[1:25:34] they were all denomination when we met
[1:25:36] them
[1:25:38] praise the lord they were all
[1:25:41] denominations
[1:25:42] and and and uh and you know uh they are
[1:25:44] all straightened from the word
[1:25:46] some of them were keeping the little
[1:25:47] fire the little truth a little prayer
[1:25:49] meeting here and there
[1:25:50] but on the major principle of the word
[1:25:53] they have already been denominated
[1:25:57] praise the lord so coming from out of
[1:26:01] that system
[1:26:03] coming from out of that system they have
[1:26:05] ruled us with creeds and
[1:26:07] dogma we struggle
[1:26:13] we struggle to be able to trust the
[1:26:16] revealed world
[1:26:20] praise the lord we struggle to be able
[1:26:23] to
[1:26:24] embrace the revealed word and and some
[1:26:26] of the things that have not helped us
[1:26:28] because
[1:26:29] many has made the message of brother
[1:26:30] branham
[1:26:33] then of the word jesus christ in our
[1:26:35] midst
[1:26:38] the message is the word jesus christ in
[1:26:41] our midst
[1:26:45] the prophet was just a chanter
[1:26:49] he was just a gift he was just a medium
[1:26:52] you just
[1:26:52] think about this this is the man to the
[1:26:55] age this is the prophet
[1:26:56] to the age this is the pastor of the age
[1:26:58] but yet he says i've never been a
[1:27:00] successful pastor
[1:27:06] praise the lord but yet he was the man
[1:27:09] that god gave the word for this age
[1:27:13] and if you're listening to the message
[1:27:15] this morning that we were playing
[1:27:16] brother brennan ran a parallel
[1:27:20] praise the lord i didn't want to take
[1:27:22] the time to read out of that that's why
[1:27:24] we played the message
[1:27:25] so if you didn't yet go back and listen
[1:27:26] to it again he ran a parallel between
[1:27:29] israel in america
[1:27:34] praise the lord
[1:27:37] he ran a parallel between israel and
[1:27:44] america
[1:27:53] because as long you know as long as we
[1:27:56] are in this body than in this world
[1:27:58] we still have our human preference
[1:28:02] amen we still have our human preference
[1:28:05] that's what make us human
[1:28:06] there is nothing bad to that that's the
[1:28:09] reason why
[1:28:09] we we have our choices we went out and
[1:28:12] vote
[1:28:13] but after all of that is said and done
[1:28:16] as a child of god as a son and daughter
[1:28:19] of god
[1:28:19] you must come back to the world
[1:28:25] we must come back to the world because
[1:28:27] if you get caught up in your preference
[1:28:30] god will not vindicate your preference
[1:28:37] he will not vindicate your press your
[1:28:38] preference because your preference is
[1:28:40] not his word
[1:28:42] your preference is not his thought we
[1:28:44] must come back to the word
[1:28:46] because what is happening here is that
[1:28:48] god is not
[1:28:49] running a a nation god is running his
[1:28:53] universe
[1:28:55] amen by his word amen
[1:28:58] we must come back to the word of god
[1:29:00] because god
[1:29:01] is not god is not uh uh you know
[1:29:04] uh interested in uh uh uh
[1:29:08] in one sense now i would say this way
[1:29:10] he's not interested in i mean
[1:29:11] we ever won the election what is
[1:29:13] interesting is that his word must come
[1:29:15] to pass
[1:29:20] the reason is because he's tired with
[1:29:22] this word
[1:29:23] he want to wrap it up and bring his
[1:29:26] kingdom on it
[1:29:29] he want to wrap the whole thing up
[1:29:46] we sit there and and as children of god
[1:29:48] as us as he let us people
[1:29:50] that have been exposed to the the
[1:29:53] the greatest thing that is happening in
[1:29:56] your day
[1:29:59] is this message it's what god is doing
[1:30:02] in your life
[1:30:04] that is the greatest thing that is
[1:30:05] happening on earth

[1:30:15] how does it interest you to know the new
[1:30:17] bridge there being in china
[1:30:18] you might never go to china and and go
[1:30:21] on that bridge
[1:30:24] why did they interest you with the new
[1:30:26] invention

[1:30:50] that is the greatest thing that is
[1:30:52] happening on earth what god is doing in
[1:30:54] your home
[1:30:56] how he's reconciling you back to himself
[1:30:59] how he's dealing with your heart
[1:31:00] how he's picking little things in your
[1:31:02] life and having you to cry to god for
[1:31:05] repair pain
[1:31:06] that is the greatest thing that is
[1:31:07] happening on the face of the earth
[1:31:11] praise the lord amen
[1:31:15] we must be looking for what god is doing
[1:31:17] in our life
[1:31:18] then what is happening on on youtube
[1:31:26] are we together so we see this thing
[1:31:30] you know broadband running parallel yeah
[1:31:32] i don't spend time to read out of that
[1:31:34] and he he run that parallel you know
[1:31:36] comparing and he says
[1:31:39] uh uh uh he says we got down there
[1:31:42] israel got down into palestine and drove
[1:31:44] those people out he said we got down
[1:31:46] here we
[1:31:46] we drove the indians out he says because
[1:31:51] are we together oh man
[1:31:56] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:32:10] he says uh the parallel
[1:32:13] and and now one one the other pepper
[1:32:15] remember
[1:32:16] israel came up and took the homeland the
[1:32:18] palestinian drove them out of
[1:32:20] uh drove them drove back all the
[1:32:23] occupants of the land and possessed it
[1:32:25] and we came in and took it from the
[1:32:27] indians drove them back
[1:32:29] and possessed it god had a reason for
[1:32:31] that
[1:32:33] he had a reason for that
[1:32:37] amen he had a reason for that
[1:32:41] and until we stick with god's reason
[1:32:45] you will be partial in your judgment
[1:32:49] what are you staying for the indians
[1:32:50] what are you staying for the white man
[1:32:52] until you stand on god's reason
[1:32:55] you will be passion
[1:33:03] god had a reason for that god was going
[1:33:05] to show the word
[1:33:08] what he could do with a little band of
[1:33:12] people
[1:33:13] that wanted freedom
[1:33:17] and freedom of religion to serve god
[1:33:21] what god will do with a man or a woman
[1:33:26] that wants to serve god
[1:33:31] now one freedom to serve god
[1:33:34] or you read about how you know how god
[1:33:37] is breaking these people
[1:33:38] out of uh uh uh uh you know uh islamic
[1:33:41] religion and all of this
[1:33:42] what god would do
[1:33:46] i'm just i reading about two ladies in
[1:33:50] in iran that was going around testifying
[1:33:52] sharing bibles
[1:33:54] god shook the word i mean the entire
[1:33:56] world media
[1:33:57] covered their story while they were in
[1:33:59] prison what god will do
[1:34:01] with a little bit of people that want to
[1:34:04] serve god
[1:34:06] not people that are just after their own
[1:34:08] pleasing in their own
[1:34:10] and know what god would do with a man or
[1:34:12] a woman
[1:34:13] that wants to serve god
[1:34:19] joshua wanted to save god's purpose god
[1:34:21] stopped the son
[1:34:23] he said son stay still until this work
[1:34:26] is done
[1:34:31] praise the lord if you really want to
[1:34:33] serve god
[1:34:34] god can pour heart to your habits
[1:34:39] he can put heart to your habits because
[1:34:42] you know you want to serve him
[1:34:56] praise the lord amen he's talking about
[1:35:00] how all the mighty men that god raised
[1:35:02] up
[1:35:02] in this nation men that were praying
[1:35:07] praise the lord men that were praying
[1:35:12] i don't want to get into that let me let
[1:35:15] me just stay here
[1:35:16] i i don't want to get lord just help me
[1:35:21] help me come back to this amen
[1:35:24] i feel in my heart you know
[1:35:28] uh when we go through it things like
[1:35:30] this we must be able to bring our focus
[1:35:32] back to the world
[1:35:34] because if ned or our conversation would
[1:35:37] be politics
[1:35:39] get back to the world
[1:35:43] let's let's stay with the world that's
[1:35:45] what god is doing
[1:35:48] you get yourself in those things you
[1:35:50] will miss what god is doing
[1:35:53] that's what i'm trying to do
[1:35:57] might be a blessing to you you might go
[1:35:58] home being angry with me and it's up to
[1:36:00] you
[1:36:02] praise the lord now so we see
[1:36:05] here elijah race up
[1:36:10] in israel and
[1:36:13] uh
[1:36:17] in our age malachi 4 has
[1:36:21] already prophesied behold i send you
[1:36:23] elijah the prophet
[1:36:25] amen so uh biblical scalas
[1:36:30] you read coffee you read food notes
[1:36:33] he compared the first coming of elijah
[1:36:36] with the second coming
[1:36:37] biblical scholar has been searching who
[1:36:39] is the one fulfilling
[1:36:41] this elijah ministry because it was a
[1:36:44] prophecy
[1:36:46] so they started looking in it
[1:36:50] praise the lord they've been looking it
[1:36:52] was announced
[1:36:54] by elijah the tishb his ministry was not
[1:36:56] announced
[1:36:59] he just showed up on the scene with some
[1:37:01] kind of a
[1:37:02] letter king around him and he went right
[1:37:05] there straight to ahab
[1:37:08] there will not be dew or rain
[1:37:11] until i call for it
[1:37:16] praise the lord
[1:37:21] that was the kind of a man he was that
[1:37:24] was his ministry because
[1:37:26] he was a prophet not only to
[1:37:30] uh the little elect the widow that fed
[1:37:32] him
[1:37:33] and and nabal that was trying to protect
[1:37:36] himself he was not just the pastor to
[1:37:38] the illest the people that was
[1:37:39] that was uh uh fearfully trusting god
[1:37:42] but he was an
[1:37:43] elector i mean a pastor to the age
[1:37:48] that's the reason why he was not afraid
[1:37:51] to tell ahab what was the word of the
[1:37:54] lord
[1:37:56] he was not afraid because he knew
[1:37:59] that was the word of god amen just like
[1:38:02] brother jordan preached wednesday night
[1:38:03] he was bored
[1:38:06] i mean he was born because he was not he
[1:38:09] was not of himself
[1:38:13] he was of the word of god
[1:38:17] are we together
[1:38:20] and yeah i mean thank all the brothers
[1:38:22] that have been kind of for stepping in
[1:38:24] brother joseph the other wednesday but
[1:38:26] then brother jordan
[1:38:28] and uh yeah i've i needed to
[1:38:32] to get myself to where i need to get
[1:38:35] myself a little bit
[1:38:36] needed to hide myself a little bit man
[1:38:40] feeling a little bit tired thank the
[1:38:44] lord
[1:38:45] so we see all of those things
[1:38:52] god sent a ministry like this
[1:38:55] he sent a man like this and yet
[1:38:58] he put a people
[1:39:01] like that right in his church
[1:39:06] now you have to know that
[1:39:09] jezebel came from
[1:39:12] uh out of idolatry
[1:39:16] amen and in idolatry
[1:39:20] the people that has power control the
[1:39:24] priests
[1:39:27] i mean so the people that have money to
[1:39:29] tell the pastor what to preach
[1:39:32] that's happening in idolatry
[1:39:37] amen by honor god's system
[1:39:42] peter told simon you die with your money
[1:39:51] and because she came from honor
[1:39:54] and a system of idolatry
[1:39:59] she don't know how to be submissive to a
[1:40:02] pastor
[1:40:06] she came from honor a system that
[1:40:08] control
[1:40:12] a system that dictates
[1:40:18] praise the lord are we together
[1:40:22] amen the bible says over
[1:40:25] in the book of genesis chapter 46
[1:40:30] when israel came over to egypt
[1:40:34] that was where joseph broke the type
[1:40:37] because he told a lie
[1:40:41] and and the reason why he went that way
[1:40:44] he was trying to protect his kingsman
[1:40:47] trying to protect his brothers
[1:40:51] he says when they ask you tell them
[1:40:55] amen that
[1:40:58] i mean our trade is
[1:41:01] with katos and the young
[1:41:05] why the scripture says because the word
[1:41:08] shepherd was an abomination to the
[1:41:11] egyptians
[1:41:14] and that's that that is that is our age
[1:41:17] shepherd
[1:41:18] is an abomination to this age when you
[1:41:21] say you are a pastor
[1:41:23] they look at you as a scammer
[1:41:28] it's an abomination to this age why
[1:41:31] because
[1:41:32] they are schemers out there people take
[1:41:35] the titles
[1:41:36] the wrong people homes they roam they're
[1:41:38] out of their money and they roam then
[1:41:40] out of there so the age has a wrong
[1:41:42] conception for it
[1:41:43] but god has sent us a prophet
[1:41:46] that taught us in the message respect
[1:41:50] that if you don't respect the man
[1:41:52] respect the office
[1:41:54] that's what the prophet taught us
[1:42:01] don't look at a man action to disrespect
[1:42:04] god's order
[1:42:07] are we together oh we can have a
[1:42:11] convention on this subject
[1:42:14] praise the lord you ate this morning
[1:42:19] praise the lord we can have a convention
[1:42:22] on this subject what's my time there
[1:42:25] i'm not even starting my time is gone
[1:42:31] because shepherd was an abomination to
[1:42:34] israel
[1:42:34] oh i mean told to the egyptians only
[1:42:37] israel knew
[1:42:42] israel you think about it
[1:42:45] ibel was a shepherd
[1:42:49] because he was in the true sea line
[1:42:53] he found himself honored the truth
[1:42:55] calling
[1:42:58] and that made him to offer the right
[1:43:00] sacrifice
[1:43:02] because right from the from the mind of
[1:43:04] god god has always thought of his people
[1:43:07] as being sheep and he being their
[1:43:09] shepherd
[1:43:12] so all all the patriots came through
[1:43:15] that line
[1:43:17] god always took them david was going to
[1:43:20] be a
[1:43:20] king but yet god gave him his teaching
[1:43:24] at the back side of the desert training
[1:43:36] sheeps
[1:43:38] are we together
[1:43:44] praise the lord amen
[1:43:48] well i think instead of just keeping you
[1:43:51] here because when you get hungry you
[1:43:52] will not be listening to me
[1:43:54] i can just go on with a series
[1:43:58] praise the lord amen
[1:44:05] so we see here
[1:44:09] god if he
[1:44:12] slay a line in his mind
[1:44:16] from the foundation of the word and we
[1:44:18] give you the picture
[1:44:20] if god talked about a lamb
[1:44:23] so in his mind when he door alone
[1:44:29] this principle this order of shepherd
[1:44:32] and sheep dealing with his people
[1:44:34] has always been in his mind
[1:44:39] are we together
[1:44:46] are we together
[1:44:50] that's the reason why if we if we can
[1:44:54] come if god can bring us to the place to
[1:44:57] realize
[1:44:58] that we are sheeps if he can bring us to
[1:45:00] the place to realize
[1:45:03] that we need help we can never find our
[1:45:05] way we can
[1:45:06] guide ourselves we can't counsel
[1:45:08] ourselves if he never brings you to the
[1:45:10] place to realize that
[1:45:12] you cannot be successful walking with
[1:45:14] god you cannot be successful
[1:45:18] you are not made to lead yourself
[1:45:25] you are not made to lead yourself
[1:45:36] so here is it but let me let me come to
[1:45:39] this place since uh
[1:45:40] uh you know i can we can we can continue
[1:45:43] here
[1:45:44] and so we see this
[1:45:47] you know brother brown time his his
[1:45:51] ministry
[1:45:51] they enjoyed his gift they enjoyed
[1:45:55] you know all of the things that happened
[1:45:56] under his ministry when it came to his
[1:45:58] teaching they thought that
[1:46:00] you know he hated women he was this and
[1:46:02] he was dead and all of that
[1:46:03] but but
[1:46:07] there was one thing they knew that god
[1:46:09] was with that man
[1:46:14] there was one thing they knew that god
[1:46:18] was with that man
[1:46:20] whether this is believing or not
[1:46:25] praise the lord through the ages
[1:46:29] as times went by and and most of the
[1:46:32] people that witnessed the supernatural i
[1:46:35] mean
[1:46:35] all of those men you listen to brother
[1:46:38] branham memorial service new year
[1:46:40] man uh uh tommy osborne and all of these
[1:46:43] men
[1:46:43] testifying that that uh that that he
[1:46:47] that he is the father of the healing
[1:46:50] campaign
[1:46:51] because that's what malachi 4 said amen
[1:46:55] the son of righteousness will rise with
[1:46:57] healing campaign
[1:46:58] that's what he said in the attraction of
[1:47:00] the mountain
[1:47:02] that's how he interpret that scripture
[1:47:04] that it was going to be a healing
[1:47:06] campaign
[1:47:07] he says over robert i saw him when he
[1:47:09] was a young man i encouraged him
[1:47:11] amen tommy osborne saw the the the
[1:47:14] deliverance of
[1:47:15] of there in oregon he came to me and i
[1:47:17] said tommy god can use you you are a
[1:47:19] good boy
[1:47:23] are we together but what is happening
[1:47:26] here what is happening in the age
[1:47:28] because it has happened in every ages
[1:47:32] praise the lord bell and ahab
[1:47:36] the i mean the the run elijah down
[1:47:40] elijah challenged him on my camera
[1:47:43] praise the lord the god that answered by
[1:47:47] fire
[1:47:48] let him be god and we know the story
[1:47:52] and the scriptures say he slayed all of
[1:47:54] those prophets jesse be a girl so angry
[1:47:59] she put men everywhere to find elijah
[1:48:02] she want to kill her pastor just like
[1:48:05] herod has killed
[1:48:06] john the baptist she killed her pastor
[1:48:10] praise the lord and that's just how
[1:48:13] sometimes this last day church the
[1:48:14] people sit right in the pill
[1:48:16] and kill the word kill the effect of the
[1:48:19] word
[1:48:23] praise the lord but bam says just like
[1:48:26] those children and their parents were
[1:48:27] sitting at home
[1:48:28] talking about elijah he was above-headed
[1:48:30] man he says it was because of the
[1:48:32] parents conversation
[1:48:34] the children picked that up they were
[1:48:37] tearing their pastor down
[1:48:39] over the dinner table
[1:48:42] praise the lord now so we see here
[1:48:49] elijah did all of that
[1:48:54] the the the sons of the prophet they
[1:48:56] were all taught
[1:48:59] he's he's out of his head he he because
[1:49:01] they were all in uh
[1:49:03] uh jesse bay and ahab seminaries
[1:49:08] but look at this side of the scripture
[1:49:10] they met
[1:49:11] elijah and said do you know that your
[1:49:14] father will be cut away
[1:49:18] do you know your father will be taken
[1:49:20] away
[1:49:21] they knew they knew that that man
[1:49:24] was the man of god
[1:49:29] praise the lord while they were hunting
[1:49:32] for elijah
[1:49:33] one met him on on on on the on the on
[1:49:36] the on the audiences
[1:49:38] please i beg you i beg because when i
[1:49:41] leave you just now you will vanish
[1:49:43] and hey how we came in
[1:49:48] please either i would tell him that i
[1:49:51] didn't see you
[1:49:55] praise the lord i'm bringing all of this
[1:49:59] to the place where
[1:50:01] we have got a social media where you get
[1:50:04] on the internet and people say
[1:50:06] all sorts of horrible things about the
[1:50:08] message about brother branham
[1:50:10] and all of that but not this election
[1:50:13] the last election
[1:50:15] when when hillary was running against uh
[1:50:18] uh president trump there were
[1:50:22] all these people you know jonathan khan
[1:50:25] and all of these guys
[1:50:26] they were all going back to willem
[1:50:28] branham's seventh vision
[1:50:34] and it was saying in his seventh vision
[1:50:37] he prophesied
[1:50:38] that there will be a woman leader
[1:50:44] whenever there is a national shaking
[1:50:48] when california chick that goes back to
[1:50:51] william branham word
[1:50:52] and it says that he said california will
[1:50:55] be under the sea
[1:50:58] you cannot kill a prophet word
[1:51:04] you might kill the man but you cannot
[1:51:06] kill his word
[1:51:07] you cannot kill his message what are you
[1:51:10] believing
[1:51:11] or not it's not you believing it that
[1:51:15] makes it true
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:18] it is true because the word of god is
[1:51:20] true
[1:51:25] that was the reason why i shot that
[1:51:26] little video for you
[1:51:28] this morning in the sunday school
[1:51:30] because it will soon start getting on
[1:51:32] the internet again
[1:51:34] they will start going back to that again
[1:51:39] whenever the people gets afraid they
[1:51:42] start to look for the place of refuge
[1:51:47] amen they start to look for the place of
[1:51:50] refuge
[1:51:50] when it gets comfortable they get away
[1:51:53] from truth
[1:51:54] they make their own choices praise the
[1:51:57] lord
[1:51:58] but isaiah the prophet said it will be
[1:52:00] in that day you can get away from this
[1:52:02] word
[1:52:03] because this is the way walking in it
[1:52:11] praise the lord amen
[1:52:15] fought and they fought against a larger
[1:52:19] message in his day jesse the haunted
[1:52:22] slav
[1:52:23] tried to kill him but yet they believed
[1:52:26] that god was going to take him away
[1:52:32] if he was wrong how god would take him
[1:52:34] away
[1:52:38] if he was evil as you said that he's
[1:52:40] evil and he's a false prophet he killed
[1:52:43] our prophet you know and i mean
[1:52:48] but yet they believe that god was going
[1:52:51] to take elijah away praise the lord
[1:53:01] we don't know how long we're going to
[1:53:03] stay here
[1:53:04] but the wheels of prophecy are spinning
[1:53:09] the wheels of prophecy are spinning
[1:53:13] because we have a a
[1:53:16] a an idolatry system a system of
[1:53:19] adultery
[1:53:20] that have come out of catholicism and
[1:53:22] all of that
[1:53:23] is hard for the people to be able to
[1:53:26] recognize
[1:53:29] the voice of god in their age
[1:53:36] oh you have you have a lot of media
[1:53:38] prophets prophecy that prophesied the
[1:53:40] icon of the election
[1:53:41] and everybody every one of them now are
[1:53:43] just in their prophecy
[1:53:47] finding some kind of adjustment why it
[1:53:49] didn't why didn't why didn't
[1:53:54] and sometimes it's a shame that instead
[1:53:57] of listening to the voice of god we feed
[1:53:59] our minds with those things
[1:54:02] it's a shame that we feed our mind with
[1:54:06] those things
[1:54:08] it shows that you don't believe what the
[1:54:10] prophet of god said
[1:54:12] you are looking for another option
[1:54:21] it's a jesse bear system
[1:54:24] it's a it's a it's a system of of
[1:54:26] adultery
[1:54:27] amen brother i'm talking right there you
[1:54:29] heard it this morning the
[1:54:31] rain from catholic oppression
[1:54:35] in france and europe that was where the
[1:54:38] foreign fathers reigned they ran from uh
[1:54:41] uh uh the suppression of catholicism
[1:54:45] and it came here to get
[1:54:49] experience god back again
[1:54:52] praise the lord
[1:54:57] but the very thing that they have
[1:54:58] reigned from
[1:55:00] they are caught in it
[1:55:04] praise the lord he says we got
[1:55:07] one catholic president john s kennedy he
[1:55:10] said we would get
[1:55:11] another one and we have another one
[1:55:19] you look at all of the everything
[1:55:21] there's uh uh that's been going on about
[1:55:23] the
[1:55:24] the supreme court and all of that the
[1:55:26] supreme court has
[1:55:28] nine justice on the panel
[1:55:33] sister heavy if i'm wrong you correct me
[1:55:36] there is one chief justice and eight
[1:55:40] associates six of them a catholic
[1:55:46] so no matter what their party is
[1:55:49] we have a leader in the house that is
[1:55:51] catholic let me tell you
[1:55:53] there is something more stronger than
[1:55:55] politics
[1:55:57] that's the reason why i don't get into
[1:55:59] politics because it's deceitful it's
[1:56:01] destructive
[1:56:04] there are people that can speak to their
[1:56:06] family they can speak to their parents
[1:56:08] because because you know it's devilish
[1:56:15] the wheels of prophecy are spinning
[1:56:19] and the man that spin the wheels is
[1:56:20] almighty god
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:24] he's the one that spills spin the wheels
[1:56:27] of
[1:56:27] of prophecy like i've said over and over
[1:56:31] prophecy is stronger than politics
[1:56:35] because prophecy is thou said the lord
[1:56:39] is god's word it will never fail
[1:56:45] praise the lord are we together
[1:56:48] amen and because
[1:56:53] because a prophet has said it you know
[1:56:57] because
[1:56:58] her pastor has said it you know when
[1:57:00] when
[1:57:01] when uh ahab came home and he was so
[1:57:04] you know uh confused and so uh
[1:57:07] disturbed because never when i give him
[1:57:10] his his his inheritance

[1:57:14] down he go complain to jesse bell
[1:57:17] you know uh he's in that neighborhood i

[1:57:27] she went and bewitched him lying to a
[1:57:30] big lie they killed never for his land
[1:57:37] elijah was not afraid
[1:57:40] early in the morning whenever i mean uh
[1:57:43] ahab was going to his new land that he
[1:57:45] has inherited
[1:57:49] elijah met him right on the junction
[1:57:53] you kill never for his lane the dogs

[1:58:04] he said it and and he said it he went
[1:58:07] his way
[1:58:12] and the dogs were like jesse their blood
[1:58:17] that's what he said praise the lord
[1:58:21] amen ahab went home he was not happy
[1:58:26] he says get it from here your business
[1:58:30] he went beautiful guiding beautiful
[1:58:34] got him but that world was haunting his
[1:58:37] mind
[1:58:39] if he was not haunting him he would not
[1:58:41] disguise himself
[1:58:43] the day he went into battle he disguised
[1:58:46] himself because he knew
[1:58:48] a man of god has spoken
[1:58:54] you cannot hide from the arrow of god's
[1:58:56] word
[1:58:57] you can change your clothes you can
[1:58:59] change your country
[1:59:01] you can change your name but you cannot
[1:59:04] hide
[1:59:05] from the arrow of god's word
[1:59:13] praise the lord amen
[1:59:20] but you think about it think about it
[1:59:24] think about what okay
[1:59:27] think about what could have happened
[1:59:32] if ahab and jessica
[1:59:35] after the challenge on my camel when
[1:59:38] elijah said
[1:59:40] lord god of israel i have done all these
[1:59:43] things
[1:59:44] according to your word
[1:59:47] let the god that answered by fire be god
[1:59:50] right before the eyes
[1:59:56] they saw the supernatural they saw god
[1:59:59] bringing fire down
[2:00:01] after the altar was wet by drums of
[2:00:04] water
[2:00:05] yet it could not stop the fire of god
[2:00:09] the fire consumed the sacrifice i'm
[2:00:12] telling you
[2:00:13] you can be wet with sin
[2:00:17] the word of god can inflame your life
[2:00:27] what what will have happened
[2:00:30] after dead if ahab was says
[2:00:34] he says look that's a prophet of god
[2:00:39] because in in israel we believe when the
[2:00:42] prophet speak
[2:00:43] and his word come to pass then god has
[2:00:46] sent him
[2:00:49] amen they could have turned israel
[2:00:52] around
[2:00:53] in a revival
[2:00:57] but because they rejected the word of
[2:00:59] god israel went
[2:01:01] worse worse worse worse
[2:01:05] until jeremiah told them you are going
[2:01:08] in captivity
[2:01:14] what would have happened to the roman
[2:01:16] kingdom when john the baptist was
[2:01:18] standing there and said you herald you
[2:01:20] took your brother's wife
[2:01:27] if you have gone home and says look we
[2:01:29] we have to say to this
[2:01:31] you know i believe his word
[2:01:34] amen
[2:01:42] it was going to bring a revival in the
[2:01:45] roman
[2:01:46] empire to see the king submitting to the
[2:01:49] word
[2:01:52] but he went home knowing that it was the
[2:01:54] truth
[2:01:55] he tried to kick it for his conscience
[2:01:59] that's the way we try to do try to kick
[2:02:02] the truth from our conscience
[2:02:05] because we are so set in our ways
[2:02:10] so set in our ways praise the lord
[2:02:14] we believe the prophet for what fit us
[2:02:19] and the very same prophet what he says
[2:02:20] does not fit us we don't believe that
[2:02:22] one
[2:02:28] only one will fit us
[2:02:38] that was my thought with this subject
[2:02:41] over and over god had that pattern
[2:02:45] all through the scripture
[2:02:50] demise and all of these people paul
[2:02:53] talks about
[2:02:54] that was under his ministry that forsook
[2:02:58] him
[2:03:00] praise the lord but it still did not
[2:03:04] change
[2:03:06] it still did not change that was the man
[2:03:08] that
[2:03:09] god ordained to lead israel at that time
[2:03:12] that was the man that had the word of
[2:03:14] god for that age
[2:03:16] he was a pastor to that age
[2:03:24] 1956 brother braham says the revival all
[2:03:27] over the place
[2:03:29] he says evangelists are psycho in
[2:03:31] america
[2:03:33] one more time because it was 50 years
[2:03:35] after azusa
[2:03:38] 50 years after 1906 revival he said
[2:03:41] maybe
[2:03:42] this will be the year that america would
[2:03:44] turn around
[2:03:45] if not it would go worse
[2:03:48] worse and worse
[2:03:53] just like god in the days of noah
[2:03:57] where his spirit could no longer strive
[2:04:01] with man
[2:04:02] amen like i've said over and over
[2:04:06] if you have god dealing with your heart
[2:04:09] you barely treasure it they are people
[2:04:13] that don't have one conscious of god
[2:04:15] their mind has been so sealed there's
[2:04:17] nothing about god
[2:04:19] and and all that has taken their heart
[2:04:21] jealousy
[2:04:22] wickedness evil that's all that is
[2:04:25] consuming them
[2:04:27] they are just into competition they want
[2:04:28] to be like this other person
[2:04:30] tomorrow they want to be like this or
[2:04:31] their whole life is just consumed
[2:04:34] in bitterness
[2:04:38] if god is dealing with your heart you
[2:04:40] better seek the mercy of god
[2:04:43] and don't allow that thing to go away
[2:04:47] because we are living in a day where
[2:04:49] merchant is going
[2:04:51] yeah marshall is growing every day on
[2:04:55] the news there is
[2:04:56] some kind of for evil every day the land
[2:05:00] is drinking blood
[2:05:06] chicago buffing in blood and all of
[2:05:09] these things happen around evil
[2:05:13] don't be here when the bride has gone
[2:05:18] don't be here because if the word is
[2:05:20] what it is
[2:05:23] time it hundred times
[2:05:30] we better strengthen ourself and come
[2:05:32] back to the word of god
[2:05:36] amen our ways ask god to help us
[2:05:41] amen
[2:05:44] we all need god's help
[2:05:48] praise the lord we all need god's help
[2:05:51] but we have to come to the place and and
[2:05:54] believe that god's word is true
[2:05:58] no matter what i think or how i feel the
[2:06:00] word of god is true
[2:06:02] there is no reason to bypass what god
[2:06:05] says
[2:06:05] and faction what the prophet said just
[2:06:07] to be able to address ourselves what god
[2:06:09] says in his word is truth
[2:06:16] because that's where that's where the
[2:06:19] whole thing is going to narrow down
[2:06:23] because no matter how we struggle with
[2:06:26] truth
[2:06:28] god is going to deal with that bright
[2:06:30] heart
[2:06:32] to surround and say lord i have
[2:06:34] struggled i have struggle
[2:06:37] i was i would submit to your word
[2:06:39] because that's what your word says
[2:06:41] that's what your prophet says
[2:06:46] it will only be the bride that will give
[2:06:49] christ preeminence
[2:06:54] only that the bride will put christ
[2:06:56] first
[2:07:05] praise the lord
[2:07:08] jesse be a pastor
[2:07:12] amen
[2:07:17] pinterest jesse bear he says now a man
[2:07:19] of god will always follow
[2:07:21] the true word of god now jesse bear had
[2:07:24] threatened him
[2:07:26] and and everything as well you say now
[2:07:29] brother branham wait a minute
[2:07:30] before you leave jesse bell that that
[2:07:34] little woman may not have had a chance
[2:07:38] she was born a pagan she didn't had a
[2:07:41] chance
[2:07:42] oh yes she did too she had a pastor
[2:07:47] amen she had a pastor
[2:07:50] that is god's mercy
[2:07:54] that is god's grace
[2:08:00] that is god's grace to the age
[2:08:04] that is god's grace
[2:08:08] to a people oh yeah she did
[2:08:12] she had a pastor and elisha wasn't
[2:08:15] afraid to tell her
[2:08:16] god always put the light there
[2:08:20] she just refused to walk in it
[2:08:23] she saw all the things happening around
[2:08:29] we must not stand between two opinions
[2:08:30] that's why elijah said let this this is
[2:08:32] not about you or me
[2:08:35] if god be god that's seven
[2:08:38] amen amen
[2:08:42] they all agree everybody agreed
[2:08:45] they came to church
[2:08:49] they did everything right before their
[2:08:51] eyes
[2:08:52] why should we struggle again
[2:08:55] what are we struggling to be able to let
[2:08:58] go
[2:08:59] and let god have his way
[2:09:04] if god in his mercy has kept us
[2:09:08] god in his mercy
[2:09:15] we feel the lord he reached down and
[2:09:17] pick us up
[2:09:19] and bring us close to him
[2:09:22] why are we kicking our feet in the air
[2:09:24] what are we struggling
[2:09:28] it comes back
[2:09:31] to that seed of god
[2:09:36] how we together amen
[2:09:40] oh my
[2:09:43] she refused to walk in it
[2:09:46] so you see what where i'm going with
[2:09:48] this thing
[2:09:50] that's the age because a prophet have
[2:09:52] said it
[2:09:53] we will go and we will go and we will go
[2:09:56] and those seven visions will never fail
[2:10:00] they would strike right to the point
[2:10:07] i was just reading the nurse called
[2:10:08] barbara was talking about that and he
[2:10:10] talked to the young people
[2:10:11] he said you young ones remember this
[2:10:15] because he knew most of the older ones
[2:10:17] would be gone
[2:10:18] he said remember this if you feel
[2:10:22] i'm not a true prophet
[2:10:27] it's not a man exalting himself into the
[2:10:30] office
[2:10:34] it's not a man praise the lord
[2:10:42] there are a lot of things that are
[2:10:43] happening around the world
[2:10:46] there are a lot of things that are
[2:10:48] happening around the world
[2:10:50] god allow this whole covet situation to
[2:10:53] get our attention
[2:11:00] because we are on the wheels of prophecy
[2:11:13] god has been good to us amen
[2:11:18] the lord is good to us
[2:11:21] he has given us grace he has allowed us
[2:11:26] to be able to hear the message of our
[2:11:28] day
[2:11:32] it was not your choosing it was his
[2:11:36] choosing
[2:11:41] if he has made this choice for you if
[2:11:44] you
[2:11:44] accept his choice it can lead you into
[2:11:47] more choices
[2:11:49] better choices that he has made
[2:11:54] but we we have the tendency to struggle
[2:11:57] we have the tendency to fight against
[2:12:00] truth
[2:12:02] amen we have the tendency
[2:12:06] to fight against truth
[2:12:10] it is all that that nature within us
[2:12:15] it is all that that uh that human nature
[2:12:20] that sinful nature the very thing that
[2:12:24] comes to change our lives
[2:12:26] we always fight with it run away from it
[2:12:32] praise the lord what a dead are we
[2:12:36] living in
[2:12:38] people what a day that we are living in
[2:12:45] and the things that is happening around
[2:12:47] us
[2:12:49] amen don't be like
[2:12:52] jesse bell or like a hop
[2:12:56] praise the lord you find many people
[2:13:01] now there's uh you know i mean
[2:13:04] with all of the different things that
[2:13:06] have happened different you know
[2:13:07] division and fastest
[2:13:09] you know many people now have chosen
[2:13:11] brother branham to be their pastor
[2:13:15] but yet it is only where
[2:13:18] they agree what he says they just play
[2:13:22] those
[2:13:22] tapes amen
[2:13:26] they play those tapes where they agree i
[2:13:28] like the discernment
[2:13:31] i like hearing brother branham calling
[2:13:33] people names
[2:13:38] praise the lord
[2:13:42] we all need a shipper
[2:13:47] amen we all need a shipper we all need a
[2:13:56] guide
[2:14:01] praise the lord we all need a guide
[2:14:05] because that's the way god ordained us
[2:14:08] to be led
[2:14:10] we can lead ourselves amen
[2:14:14] we can lead ourselves we just did the
[2:14:16] message leadership with the young people
[2:14:17] what a beautiful
[2:14:18] uh time we had together studying that
[2:14:20] message you know and
[2:14:22] and uh and we we saw some of the things
[2:14:24] that brought brandon
[2:14:25] you know brought out there you know and
[2:14:28] and uh
[2:14:29] and then one one of them was asking me
[2:14:31] brother one why
[2:14:32] you know we talked about it the the
[2:14:34] different steps of leaders brother
[2:14:35] brennan poured out he's the first person
[2:14:37] to lead us he said from our first step
[2:14:39] to our last step there will always be
[2:14:41] someone to lead us
[2:14:42] the first person that led us was our
[2:14:44] mother then he says then we went
[2:14:46] to our school teacher then he says our
[2:14:49] father led us
[2:14:51] then he says the next person that led us
[2:14:53] was the minister
[2:14:55] amen and then after the leadership of
[2:14:58] the minister
[2:15:00] we get under the leadership of the holy
[2:15:02] ghost sons
[2:15:03] and daughters of god are led by the
[2:15:06] spirit of god
[2:15:09] amen
[2:15:12] what is now father and mother the first
[2:15:14] two it was not
[2:15:16] it was not physical leadership it was
[2:15:18] guidance
[2:15:19] he was talking about guidance mama is
[2:15:22] the one that is close to the baby
[2:15:25] father take his role when the child is
[2:15:28] at an understanding place
[2:15:29] and need advices for school need advices
[2:15:32] for marriage need advices
[2:15:34] for investment then father comes in
[2:15:39] praise the lord and we identify in that
[2:15:42] message
[2:15:43] the problem of the young rich ruler
[2:15:46] he had a good mama that taught him the
[2:15:48] lord
[2:15:50] he had a good school teacher he had a
[2:15:53] good
[2:15:53] father that taught him to be successful
[2:15:55] businessman
[2:15:57] but he was under the wrong leadership of
[2:16:00] the ministry
[2:16:03] he found himself on the the wrong
[2:16:05] leadership of the ministry
[2:16:07] they could not point him to the messiah
[2:16:10] they could not tell him nothing about
[2:16:12] internal life
[2:16:14] all they were telling him or just you
[2:16:16] know
[2:16:18] we having donation in the church
[2:16:22] let's have a conference and and this
[2:16:26] piece is coming up
[2:16:27] they were just all into parties and
[2:16:30] society
[2:16:32] so because there was there was a miss
[2:16:36] in his leadership and that's it that's
[2:16:38] that's god's order
[2:16:40] if you miss one it take the grace of god
[2:16:43] to be able to help you
[2:16:49] not many had a great dance
[2:16:52] to to be able to guide him but that's
[2:16:56] where the new birth comes in
[2:16:59] that's where the new birth comes in and
[2:17:02] when a new verse comes and you know what
[2:17:04] god do
[2:17:04] he just don't lead you because you never
[2:17:06] had that he surround you with people
[2:17:10] that could give it to you if you need it
[2:17:15] but we're living in such an arrogant age
[2:17:18] people get so arrogant i'm born again i
[2:17:20] read the mess and nobody have to tell me
[2:17:22] what i need to do
[2:17:23] i have the holy ghost
[2:17:28] have enough holy ghost just to swear
[2:17:31] your head
[2:17:34] but look at your choices and you know
[2:17:37] that you need god
[2:17:43] that's why god does he put these people
[2:17:46] in the body

[2:29:39] where those things are promised to be
[2:29:41] happening around us
[2:29:43] where we see the hand of god
[2:29:48] god answering prayers god moving

[2:30:27] ourselves we try to
[2:30:28] try to do everything get in the way
[2:30:31] trying
[2:30:32] struggling and getting away from

[2:30:43] a cheap heart you never know the benefit
[2:30:47] of a shepherd
[2:30:49] you will never know

[2:31:10] rebecca was a shepherd
[2:31:14] zepora she was a shepherd yeah
[2:31:18] before she met moses
[2:31:24] mama answered to shepherd their little
[2:31:26] ones
[2:31:30] you have to get the heart of a shepherd
[2:31:32] [Music]
[2:31:38] that is to shepherd their little ones
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:50] that is the secret
[2:31:54] that's what jesus said if you are not
[2:31:56] gathering with me you are scattering
[2:32:00] because the work of the shepherd is
[2:32:01] together
[2:32:05] the work of the shepherd is to self
[2:32:13] [Music]
[2:32:27] we keep telling ourselves we know what
[2:32:29] we need to know
[2:32:32] we don't need to be taught
[2:32:37] but the work of the shepherd is to teach
[2:32:40] us
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:50] where he
[2:32:56] [Music]

[2:33:26] committed in your hands

[2:33:33] god
[2:33:34] just the lord help me help me
[2:33:37] to submit to that word
[2:33:40] [Music]

[2:33:47] position we don't want to lose
[2:33:51] the name we have built for ourselves

[2:33:59] gained his name and he gained his
[2:34:01] reputation
[2:34:04] you come before the great shepherd and
[2:34:06] he says i didn't know you
