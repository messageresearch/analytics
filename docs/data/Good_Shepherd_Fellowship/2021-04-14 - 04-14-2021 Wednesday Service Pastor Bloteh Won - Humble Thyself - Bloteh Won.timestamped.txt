[39:44] staying with our city our country with
[39:47] everything that is going on now
[39:50] and we just want to commit that in the
[39:51] hands of the law
[39:53] let's just uh read a very
[39:56] familiar scripture uh we want to
[39:59] uh take tonight
[40:05] that would just be a verse from
[40:12] praise the lord
[40:21] praise the lord
[40:26] we'll read second chronicles ii
[40:29] chronicles and
[40:30] just like i said a very
[40:47] ii chronicles chapter seven
[40:52] second chronicles chapter seven
[40:55] we read from verse 12 uh this is very
[40:59] familiar to us
[41:00] but uh we want to we just want to take a
[41:04] verse here
[41:04] i will show you there and
[41:07] [Music]
[41:08] ii chronicles chapter 7 we read from
[41:11] verse 12
[41:11] and the lord appeared to solomon by
[41:14] night
[41:15] and said unto him i have heard
[41:19] that prayer and have chosen this place
[41:24] to myself for
[41:27] a house of sacrifice
[41:31] if i shut up heaven
[41:34] that there be no rain or if
[41:38] i command the locals to devote the land
[41:41] or if i send pestilence among the people
[41:47] if my people if
[41:50] my people almighty god is saying that my
[41:53] people
[41:54] which i call by my name shall humble
[41:58] themselves
[41:58] now we have to know that this is not a
[42:00] promise to the word this is a promise
[42:03] to a people that god has called by his
[42:06] name
[42:07] if my people which i call by my name
[42:11] shall humble themselves and pray and
[42:14] seek my face not only in a prayer
[42:17] meeting tonight
[42:19] but seek the face of the lord
[42:23] and turn from their wicked ways
[42:27] then i will year from heaven
[42:30] and i will forgive their sin and will
[42:34] heal the land now i got attracted to
[42:38] uh this verse tonight or these few
[42:41] verses that i read just because of those
[42:44] few words i will heal
[42:46] their land we need healing and we are
[42:49] not able to
[42:50] to congregate in church tonight because
[42:55] our i will learn our community is
[42:57] hurting
[42:58] so we need healing praise the lord we
[43:01] don't want it to be
[43:04] no worse than what it is and we will
[43:08] just
[43:08] we will just inform you i mean we having
[43:12] uh the parking lot with cars in it of uh
[43:16] of protesters and that are going down
[43:18] the street
[43:19] and the church the lutheran church uh
[43:22] about our
[43:23] side here also the parking lot is filled
[43:26] with
[43:27] university a parking lot filled on a
[43:30] wednesday night
[43:31] like sometimes hours is filled service
[43:34] but the parking lot is filled just
[43:36] because of people
[43:37] that are all crowding out there tonight
[43:40] so the community
[43:41] is here is hurting and that's the reason
[43:44] why
[43:45] we all came congregating church tonight
[43:47] so
[43:48] uh but we're having a promise before us
[43:50] here
[43:51] that if uh people god's people
[43:54] that are called uh by his name
[43:58] if we would just humbled ourselves
[44:00] tonight it would just
[44:01] take you to take it to consideration in
[44:04] seriousness tonight
[44:06] that if god do not intervene and
[44:09] and turn the situation around we could
[44:12] go
[44:13] weeks without church you know if it get
[44:16] any worse
[44:17] you know the the dallas toll
[44:21] across the street here was uh was broken
[44:24] into
[44:25] you know but the lord has been faithful
[44:27] to keep our building
[44:29] and we have now seen any sign of
[44:33] people trying to break into it so we
[44:35] want to thank the law for that also
[44:37] and so let's just take this to heart
[44:41] tonight
[44:42] we having we're having a
[44:45] few prayer burdens that we want to take
[44:50] before the lord
[44:51] but i have a also a quote from brother
[44:54] branham
[44:55] the message humbled that self uh
[44:58] i want to read that also before we just
[45:01] take our uh
[45:06] [Music]
[45:09] the prophet god said and god can only
[45:13] operate
[45:14] as we let him operate
[45:18] as we will yield ourselves tonight as we
[45:20] will put our hearts before the lord
[45:23] god can only operate as we will let him
[45:27] operate you know people want
[45:30] power and really they don't know
[45:34] what power is sunday we spoke a little
[45:38] bit on there when brother brennan was
[45:39] talking about
[45:40] when adam lost his power he lost his
[45:43] friendship with god he lost his
[45:45] relationship with god
[45:47] he lost his fellowship with god brother
[45:50] branham online there that that was the
[45:52] power and that is where power
[45:54] is for the church of the living god we
[45:56] don't have power
[45:57] if we don't have friendship with god we
[46:00] don't have power if we don't have a
[46:01] fellowship
[46:02] or a relationship with god so brother
[46:05] branham says you know
[46:06] people want power and they really
[46:10] and the uh and they don't know what
[46:13] power
[46:14] is see
[46:17] they don't really know what goes with
[46:21] it the way up is down
[46:24] always if you want
[46:27] power see how humble
[46:32] you can get if the people that are
[46:35] called by my name will humble themself
[46:38] if you want power with god
[46:43] to stop the situation that is happening
[46:45] in our community
[46:47] to stop situations that is happening in
[46:49] our lives and
[46:51] around our families and loved ones if we
[46:54] want power with god
[46:56] see how humble we can get
[46:59] just get away from
[47:03] all your worldly thinking
[47:07] and humble yourself
[47:10] and humble yourself before god and then
[47:14] you have got more power than the man
[47:19] that run all over the building
[47:23] and making a big loud of noise
[47:26] so you think about it tonight here is
[47:29] the community and people driving from
[47:32] other parts of
[47:33] the city tonight and coming into
[47:35] brooklyn center
[47:36] to be able to make their voice to be
[47:39] hurting
[47:40] and uh they want power but jerry said
[47:43] you are at your home
[47:45] and we can just humble ourselves take
[47:48] our thoughts from straight in the way
[47:51] and
[47:54] just put our mind on the lord brother
[47:57] branham says
[47:58] we have so much power in that position
[48:02] tonight
[48:03] than the people that are running down
[48:04] the street our prayer
[48:06] tonight can change the situation more
[48:08] than
[48:09] the violence or the uh their peaceful
[48:12] protests or
[48:13] you know whatever they they are carrying
[48:16] out tonight
[48:17] just our position and that's what we can
[48:20] offer to the community tonight
[48:22] is to call on the name of the lord
[48:25] it's not to go on facebook and make our
[48:28] voice to be heard which of course you
[48:30] have a right to do that
[48:31] if you want to but i think we can make
[48:34] our voice to be head at the throne of
[48:36] god
[48:37] this evening if we would just take the
[48:40] needs
[48:41] take the hurting families
[48:45] before the lord in prayer tonight
[48:48] he says
[48:53] the way up is down if you want power
[48:57] see how humble you can get just get away
[49:01] from all your wallet thinking
[49:04] it's it does not it does not means uh
[49:07] you know uh
[49:08] uh you know uh uh sinful thinking
[49:11] it's just it's just uh getting our mind
[49:14] center on the lord just getting our mind
[49:17] on the lord
[49:18] think on a promise tonight thing on
[49:21] god's promise
[49:23] you know he says uh we will see
[49:26] the the reward of the wicked you know
[49:30] uh they will fall on our right hand and
[49:32] our left hand they will not come night
[49:34] us you know uh the lord is a present
[49:38] help
[49:38] in time of you know trouble if we can
[49:41] just
[49:41] keep our mind on the promise of god
[49:43] tonight he says get all your wallet
[49:46] thinking
[49:46] and humble humble yourself before god
[49:50] and then you have got more power
[49:53] than the man that run all over the
[49:55] building and make
[49:56] a big lot of noise see because you have
[50:00] been
[50:00] able to conquer yourself
[50:04] and commit yourself to christ you see
[50:08] to humble yourself before him
[50:11] that's really power
[50:16] you show me in a church that's humble
[50:20] really humble not on our
[50:23] net not arrogance say because we said we
[50:26] are in the message
[50:28] now arrogance said because of the
[50:29] building that we have or anything
[50:32] but really humble and to be humble
[50:35] is to come in obedience to every word of
[50:38] god
[50:40] not arrogance at church
[50:44] just as sweet humble church
[50:49] i will show you a church that has
[50:53] the favor and the power of god in it
[50:58] that's right that's the thing it takes
[51:04] that's what it takes humanity humbling
[51:06] ourselves before god
[51:08] letting god just work through us
[51:12] to heal us letting god just work through
[51:15] us
[51:16] to deliver us allowing god to work
[51:19] through
[51:20] us to preach the word allowing god to
[51:23] work through us to believe the word
[51:25] allowing god to work through us
