[33:21] together as it it's time to go up to the
[33:24] house of God or worship or to the
[33:27] British because they worship a man who
[33:29] can walk up into that group of evil and

[34:21] was a visited and there was another
[34:25] voice that came along
[34:28] amen in fact we have 74 sickness brother
[34:33] Graham said one day you heard five boys
[34:37] never thought I didn't want to comment
[34:39] about them he said I better leave that
[34:42] alone for a while but he listened to the
[34:46] Rome rules didn't want his life the
[34:51] closest had he had why didn't I kill
[34:57] thou speakest like a movie and it was a
[35:03] hope you Grace would be pretty instead
[35:06] of dying it changed the course of human
[35:10] beings impact but he heard a voice of
[35:14] God he had fellowship with it so many
[35:18] turn how did he know that his wife is
[35:20] wrong remember it was says Amen oh watch
[35:25] this church I'm going to comment on the
[35:28] last step of the first part of it I've
[35:31] already talked how they made about these
[35:34] both Marcus service already how did he
[35:39] know that his wife was wrong as she had
[35:43] heard the same essence together but
[35:46] always is that way always that because
[35:48] this moment I think God gives to the
[35:50] husband or kids in the problem probably
[35:53] gives you to the bride is that right to
[35:56] the husband and I'm going to give to the
[35:58] wife also forbidden women were inside
[37:48] what's that what's that what's that
[38:17] it's not as law an advocate here

[38:28] God correct
[38:30] he walked indisputable knowledge but
[38:34] here in Hades voice beginning to
[38:39] direction away from the voice of God
[38:43] amen look at the tales that it produced
[38:49] when Adam heard the world wars every
[38:53] sickness every did rather a hard
[38:58] evidence that immediacy
[39:04] carbon/carbon was given this very moment
[39:08] of unity auditory the very West three
[39:15] sons his youngest son I got jumper South
[39:19] Yungas shot and then already conceding
[39:23] 15 hours I believe me is not worth the
[39:26] thought he had the science is beautiful
[39:32] my dear should be gentle the world and
[39:35] at night did nothing to stop me and be
[39:39] about 21 hours to live attribute to the
[39:41] I'm glad you didn't bother about that
[39:44] taken care of even on that he did also
[39:48] be small but if you waited
[39:51] oh nice would not have been and having
[39:56] continued in the voice of God all chaos
[40:00] that we had oh oh oh that's been
[40:06] brothers were lost with a healthy to get
[40:09] political and that is a little bit about
[40:12] the city yeah remember both oh man now

[40:20] dealing is me on the neck left man and
[40:24] that man is now that all that kind of
[40:27] thing what actually
[40:59] [Music]

[43:13] bride crazy for his son God deserves
[43:19] your name partners slavery Cossack
[43:24] Genesis chapter 15 and verse out and he
[43:28] brought him forth abroad and said look
[43:32] now toward it are with an anthem of the
[43:38] song now this is bigger Silver Star
[43:42] Abraham 10 all the stars as if Abraham
[43:46] is to go out and preach the stars and
[43:49] seek literally to the star anise ace of
[43:52] the Google Calendar yes that'll be able
[43:57] to live with him and he said to him so
[44:00] shall thy seed be King James version of
[44:06] the Bible any we're not telling no star
[44:10] but I want you to relax on teachers and
[44:16] Abraham is doing without pollution
[44:28] fiscal evasion to the because you won't
[44:31] really up there and it is not just a
[44:34] slightly bizarre again feeling to start
[44:40] with a husband you can see the river
[44:43] long ha hey that's what we need to do is
[44:47] focus your eyes and see the kingdom of
[44:52] God
[44:56] I think a lovely everything moral made
[45:13] and we can't even imagine our genetic
[45:19] pollution and drive a ball Priscilla's
[45:26] arse stars I'm going to have any seizure
[45:32] as there are of you isn't it they men
[45:39] you may have no idea what Abraham is
[45:46] confirmed he has no son he has a child
[45:51] again Sarah is barren nothing is going
[45:57] home but Abraham has to see nothing oh
[46:04] maybe we need to start talking and
[46:07] speaking of making and rather than
[46:09] negativity I yeah the Spanish version of
[46:14] the Bible which I was preaching this
[46:18] Condors 100 brother claims door and he
[46:23] was interpreting and I was running over
[46:25] to this window looking out him and then
[46:27] saying this versus the keep getting
[46:29] version and the Donner rocket understand
[46:33] my mistake because it's not the way
[46:36] survival easy amen
[46:39] survival reason just a little bit of
[46:41] copy that you smart again look at the
[46:44] Stars and many have they are show with
[46:49] more see Bea Haven so I ran in Abraham
[46:53] is a brief estar and the way that this
[46:58] Spanish language said Amen if he goes
[47:01] over a and stars and it's got a
[47:04] revelation his heart that God is
[47:07] speaking to me
[47:09] God and God to save a ram I'm in love as
[47:13] far as they are so salad horse you see
[47:18] what kind of they did they we haven't
[47:21] have to have in what you hear oh I think
[47:25] about of truth and in your club brother
[47:27] Napa said God spoke to Abraham and
[47:30] totally there now your get a particular
[47:32] lattice all that man is talking about
[47:36] and if God is telling Abraham about its
[47:40] baby
[47:41] it's coming me is why it is berry
[47:45] there is no I had offspring and all but
[47:50] God is telling a favor
[47:51] hey and if your chances are if you're
[47:56] just the word hey that's your hearing
[48:01] eyeball and I am Telling You as your see
[48:05] our mamas are then you must hear the
[48:10] voice of God no man any we're going back

[48:25] heard from God I gotta told me.there you
[48:29] and I are going to have season like the
[48:34] star that is you know and then as far as

[1:19:03] we have heard the word of God tonight I
[1:19:06] know Jordan was trying to find out with
[1:19:13] some of the things out there how they
[1:19:16] were following the service and now but
[1:19:21] the thing that is necessary tonight is
[1:19:24] the other I believe something where
[1:19:28] Peter said tonight that the Holy Spirit
[1:19:31] my have spoken to your heart or my have
[1:19:36] quick into your mind tonight or he might
[1:19:39] have just been that word for you I mean
[1:19:42] to your remembrance tonight you know I
[1:19:44] was just thinking about it one better
[1:19:45] Twitter started reading the scripture
[1:19:47] yeah we are talking about the book of
[1:19:51] art saying he goes right into the book
[1:19:54] of us tonight to read and reading about
[1:19:57] John coming with a message of baptizing
[1:20:01] and that alone - not just caught my
[1:20:06] attention I said water art that God will
[1:20:09] just use that reading of the scripture
[1:20:12] tonight to just confirm we right steady
[1:20:14] in the book of Acts and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:17] led a seven of God tonight to bring that
[1:20:20] message to us and speaking on year-in
[1:20:24] the voice of God correctly I was sitting
[1:20:26] there writing my notes and I just
[1:20:28] thinking about hearing the voice of God
[1:20:30] addressing your situation because the
[1:20:34] message is preached and as he preached
[1:20:36] the message the Saints were able to make
[1:20:39] sacrifice tonight to come in and support
[1:20:42] their pastor to be able to preach to us
[1:20:44] tonight this is not their service time
[1:20:47] their service is actually tomorrow but
[1:20:49] it will make a sacrifice just to be able
[1:20:52] to to support him create an atmosphere
[1:20:55] that he can be able to minister to us
[1:20:57] there is no need for us to be able for
[1:21:00] us to complain even if the Sun was not
[1:21:03] coming up right all we need to do is to
[1:21:06] just put our heart before the Lord and
[1:21:09] and
[1:21:10] and trust that God was able to say
[1:21:12] something just the title of the message
[1:21:15] hearing the voice of God correctly and
[1:21:19] it's enough to be able the Holy Spirit
[1:21:22] can just pick that up and deal with our
[1:21:25] hearts are we hearing the voice of God
[1:21:27] addressing our needs are we hearing the
[1:21:29] voice of God addressing situation in our
[1:21:33] life Abraham heard the voice of God he
[1:21:36] came to Sarah and he told Sarah the
[1:21:38] exact thing that he heard but she heard
[1:21:40] something different and and and she
[1:21:43] brought he got into the picture and and
[1:21:46] and until when God came down and spoke
[1:21:50] to her when she heard just what Abraham
[1:21:53] heard it changed her body and got her
[1:21:55] ready to bring for the promised son if
[1:21:58] we a year in the
