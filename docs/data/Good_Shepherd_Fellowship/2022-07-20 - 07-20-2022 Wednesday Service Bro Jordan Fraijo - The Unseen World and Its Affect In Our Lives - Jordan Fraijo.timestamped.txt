[30:04] the reason why we're amazed
[30:06] is because of our sins that were washed

[32:38] lord we're so thankful father that we
[32:40] have a blood that's washed our sins away
[32:44] lord not just
[32:45] our sins in the past father
[32:48] lord not just our mistakes and failures
[32:50] that are perhaps happen today father the
[32:54] lord he the song says oh

[33:19] lord we just ask you come down this
[33:21] evening father lord and have your way
[33:23] father lord lord we all reveal your
[33:25] presence here in the midst of your
[33:27] people
[33:29] lord just come take full control the
[33:31] rest of this service father send me to
[33:33] the side just use me father
[33:36] lord whatever it is you want to speak to
[33:38] your people father lord may ears be open
[33:41] to hear father lord may the holy spirit
[33:44] and the individual be there to receive
[33:46] from you father
[33:47] lord may eyes come open
[33:50] truth father
[33:56] for you are worthy
[33:58] in jesus most wonderful and precious
[34:02] amen amen
[34:09] thank you musicians you may be seated
[34:12] [Music]
[34:15] my goodness
[34:17] when his presence comes by
[34:22] no wonder
[34:24] there at the building of solomon's
[34:26] temple
[34:27] said that the priests and the
[34:30] ministers they got up to minister
[34:33] and the presence of the lord
[34:35] was so great
[34:38] that they just had to step down and step
[34:39] out of the way
[34:41] you see because
[34:45] it's not about
[34:46] the minister
[34:49] it's not about the minister's message
[34:53] it's not about
[34:55] you
[34:56] as the listener
[34:58] it's not about any one of us as an
[35:00] individual
[35:02] it's not about our opinions
[35:05] it's not about how we feel
[35:07] it's not about how we're dressed
[35:10] none of those things
[35:13] now we there's many of these things that
[35:15] we do
[35:16] in preparing ourselves to come here
[35:22] but all we're doing
[35:25] is doing our best
[35:27] to prepare
[35:28] ourselves and set ourselves to the side
[35:32] so that he can come down and take full
[35:34] control
[35:37] so it's not
[35:39] about being seen or being heard
[35:42] it's about what ali who did there with
[35:44] job
[35:46] he said there's been a whole lot of
[35:47] preachers preaching
[35:49] there's a whole been a whole lot of
[35:52] of the congregation either
[35:54] agreeing with their amens or with their
[35:57] with their rebuttals
[35:59] not liking the message
[36:02] but it wasn't about any of that
[36:05] the point was
[36:07] to get god on the scene to minister
[36:10] directly to his people and that's what
[36:12] it's always been about
[36:14] so when he's on the scene saints all we
[36:16] have to do is is let go
[36:19] and let him have his way
[36:21] that's why his presence is so sweet
[36:23] that's why the when his presence drops
[36:25] and you feel it you know it yes
[36:28] and that's when you have that's where
[36:29] your choice comes in
[36:31] you have a choice to make
[36:33] is do i stay within my own bounds of
[36:35] propriety do i stay within my own
[36:38] uh ideas of of what uh worship should
[36:41] look like what what am i going to do
[36:45] or do i just surrender and let him have
[36:47] his way
[36:49] you see because we that's the thing is
[36:51] even
[36:53] whether
[36:54] in
[36:57] whether under the presence of the lord
[36:59] or any other situation in our lives so
[37:01] many times
[37:02] we are so afraid to be out of
[37:06] control you see and
[37:09] there's but there's only two options
[37:12] there's only two options
[37:14] and that's to go on be under the control
[37:17] of the holy spirit
[37:20] and if you're not under his control then
[37:22] you got to ask whose control am i under
[37:24] yes
[37:25] so if you find yourself resisting his
[37:27] control
[37:29] then where does that leave you
[37:32] you see so many times we think no it's
[37:33] just me that's just that's you know and
[37:36] i get it we all worship in different
[37:37] ways
[37:39] some of us are more expressive because
[37:40] that's how he made us
[37:41] some of us are a little bit more quiet
[37:43] because that's how he made us
[37:46] but you let him take control and you'll
[37:48] still act in ways that you never
[37:49] expected
[37:51] you see that's it's the same way that's
[37:53] why it's called coming under that the
[37:56] inspiration and like intoxication of the
[37:59] spirit
[38:00] it's because just like those who come
[38:02] under the intoxication of alcohol or
[38:05] under some type of influence of a of a
[38:07] of a drug
[38:10] is that when they are actually
[38:12] under the full influence of the
[38:14] intoxication or influence of that drug
[38:18] they no longer have any control of their
[38:22] own
[38:24] that's why they're not allowed to drive
[38:27] they are not allowed
[38:29] on the road because they are not making
[38:32] their own decisions that which they are
[38:35] intoxicated and under the influence of
[38:37] is what's making their decisions
[38:43] and that's the place god's wanting us
[38:45] all to come to
[38:48] is come under the intoxication of the
[38:50] spirit of god
[38:52] let him have control
[38:54] and you won't have to worry if you're
[38:56] making the right or wrong decision
[38:58] because you won't be making any
[38:59] decisions
[39:01] anymore
[39:04] so just let go
[39:05] just let go
[39:07] saints you don't have to all pray for me
[39:10] tonight
[39:11] um kind of as the term they say kind of
[39:14] flying by the seat of my pants
[39:18] i kept my fingers crossed real tight
[39:20] with
[39:21] life and schedules um
[39:23] on sunday because the dan wasn't feeling
[39:25] well but he still was here in church
[39:27] he said well i think i'm feeling a
[39:28] little better and i said oh great
[39:30] because you're preaching wednesday
[39:33] and
[39:34] i got a text about five o'clock or so
[39:37] somewhere around there and let me know
[39:39] he wasn't gonna make it but
[39:42] you know
[39:44] it's not once again like i said it it's
[39:46] just not about us
[39:48] and if we can just lean into the
[39:50] presence of god then
[39:53] then the right things will be said and
[39:56] if you're pulling you'll get what you
[39:58] need out of the service tonight
[40:00] you know i just got a little thought and
[40:02] we'll kind of walk down it i don't want
[40:04] to keep you too late or too long or or
[40:06] or stretch anything out but if you'll
[40:08] just jump in with me and and pull from
[40:10] that end then i'll i'll do my best on on
[40:13] this end and we'll both just let god
[40:15] have his way and just have a wonderful
[40:17] time
[40:18] if we'll go ahead and turn to ephesians
[40:20] 6 12
[40:21] i'm doing i'm going to take a little
[40:23] thought that i've actually ministered on
[40:24] before in the past but it's been quite
[40:26] some time
[40:28] and don't worry i got i brought all my
[40:30] notes from the previous time i
[40:32] ministered and it took about two to
[40:34] three hours but i'm gonna do my best to
[40:36] pare that down by in to about a short
[40:39] synopsis
[40:41] ephesians 6 and 12
[40:43] well-known scripture
[40:44] let's read it
[40:46] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[40:48] blood
[40:49] but against principalities against
[40:51] powers against the rulers of the
[40:53] darkness of this world
[40:55] against spiritual wickedness in high
[40:58] places let's just pray
[41:00] heavenly father lord
[41:02] we've come together here as your
[41:03] scriptures said if two or three would
[41:05] gather together in your name that you
[41:07] would be here father so lord
[41:09] we've done that and we can claim it as a
[41:12] promise that lord here we are so we know
[41:14] you're here also father
[41:16] lord we felt your presence father so
[41:18] beyond even just being able to claim it
[41:20] as a promise your word we felt you we we
[41:23] know you're here father so lord we're
[41:25] just here to hear from you ask you just
[41:27] take these few
[41:29] thoughts father this little scripture
[41:31] just anoint it to the hearts your people
[41:33] father lord and just take and make it a
[41:36] blessing father i pray or we just
[41:38] surrender ourselves to you always ask
[41:40] for our brother dan who's not feeling
[41:42] well or that you'd reached out to him
[41:44] father for lord especially with all he
[41:46] gives to this congregation father
[41:48] pouring out of himself or that you just
[41:50] raise him up father lord quickly and
[41:52] just a quick recovery that he'd just be
[41:55] feeling better father right away
[41:57] but we lay all these things in your
[41:58] hands in jesus name amen you may be
[42:01] seated
[42:02] i just want to take a little thought
[42:05] and what i had titled it
[42:08] was the unseen world
[42:10] and its effect on our lives
[42:15] and with a kind of a
[42:19] what are we allowing to influence us
[42:22] and we don't even know
[42:25] you know
[42:26] here in ephesians 6 and 12
[42:28] as we read it
[42:31] there is a lot of references to
[42:34] physical struggle
[42:36] but as you read through it you realize
[42:37] that none of the things that you're
[42:39] wrestling against are that of which you
[42:42] can contact with your hands your with
[42:45] your ability to touch feel see here
[42:49] and so right away
[42:52] what that's doing is letting you know
[42:54] that it's beyond your own ability
[42:58] to wrestle
[42:59] it's beyond your own ability to resist
[43:03] it's beyond your own ability to do
[43:05] something about this
[43:08] you see because that's what we're always
[43:10] trying to do is well point me where's
[43:12] the problem point me in that direction
[43:14] and and i'll just keep fighting it until
[43:16] i figure it out
[43:18] you know whatever it is i'll you know in
[43:21] in construction working construction if
[43:23] you had something that you wanted to
[43:24] move
[43:25] and it wasn't moving well you just got a
[43:26] bigger hammer
[43:28] right you didn't actually
[43:30] stop and think about it and how what's a
[43:32] better approach
[43:33] you just applied more force
[43:36] and hoped that it worked out
[43:38] and that's how most of us approach most
[43:40] of the things in our lives even
[43:42] spiritually speaking
[43:44] is we're like well
[43:46] what i what what i'm trying isn't
[43:47] working but maybe if i just do it a
[43:49] little bit better a little bit stronger
[43:51] to you know
[43:52] apply myself a little bit
[43:54] more it'll it'll work out better
[43:57] and then we go do the same thing
[43:59] and then when we come back around we're
[44:00] like wow
[44:02] this is still a problem
[44:03] i wonder why
[44:07] it's because you're still trying to
[44:08] handle a spiritual problem
[44:12] through your own abilities
[44:14] you see and that was never the way it
[44:16] was supposed to be that's why this
[44:18] outlines exactly
[44:20] that we're not fighting flesh and blood
[44:23] it removes us from the arena immediately
[44:26] that's right see if it was something
[44:28] that we could go after so something like
[44:30] in the old testament the lord said okay
[44:33] go and take the land
[44:34] well that's easy you say wow that's
[44:37] pretty scary that's hard you know go
[44:38] into physical battle
[44:40] but you can see your enemy you know who
[44:42] he is you can identify him right off the
[44:44] bat
[44:45] right
[44:46] that's a philistine i'm an israelite
[44:49] that's the enemy when he's dead i've won
[44:54] simple right yes
[44:57] but it's not that way
[44:59] it's not even like during the ox age
[45:01] during the time when so many christians
[45:03] were giving their lives
[45:05] where the ultimate
[45:08] win was to give your life for christ
[45:11] in a physical manner
[45:14] you would go there was many in the
[45:16] arenas as you read the stories back
[45:17] through history where they would be in
[45:20] the arena putting christians to death
[45:24] and
[45:25] those that were the spectators
[45:30] of the acts in the arena
[45:32] were so overcome
[45:35] by the
[45:37] by the
[45:37] courage of the christians
[45:40] that they would convert to christianity
[45:42] in the stands and walk out into the
[45:45] arena and give their life alongside them
[45:49] their christian
[45:50] walk
[45:51] lasted from their decision to serve
[45:53] christ to their walk into the arena
[45:58] that long he said wow that must have
[46:01] been hard to do
[46:02] it had its
[46:04] areas that were hard sure you still have
[46:07] to make that decision
[46:10] but it's nothing like what we face today
[46:14] and that's not to make that any less of
[46:17] them
[46:18] but god is working us up to a place
[46:22] we're going back to the beginning
[46:26] you see
[46:27] we're in a reversal we went all the way
[46:29] out and now we're going we and we went
[46:32] to the furthest point
[46:35] and christ came and gave his life
[46:37] and from that point on we've been
[46:39] heading back to the original
[46:43] right
[46:44] we've got to the place where we're
[46:46] saying now we're going back to eden
[46:49] we're already in that area that where
[46:50] it's folding over the time versus
[46:53] eternity where we're already in that
[46:55] place
[46:56] where god's able to come back and
[46:58] commune with men
[47:00] lift to ear like he did with adam
[47:03] so here we are in satan's eden
[47:07] already in a state
[47:09] where if if you're sensitive to the
[47:10] moving of his presence
[47:12] you can already enter into that same
[47:14] place adam was at
[47:16] walking with god
[47:18] amen we're back there
[47:20] so you got to think then where where are
[47:22] the next steps because it's it's going
[47:24] to be in a reverse pattern
[47:27] so if
[47:28] if in the original
[47:30] you had god beginning
[47:32] right
[47:33] brother madam talks about that little
[47:34] bit that god had to break off that
[47:36] little bit of logos to drop off
[47:38] to actually begin creating
[47:41] because god who filled all space in time
[47:43] and eternity and everything
[47:45] in that form was even too great in that
[47:48] form
[47:50] to do this little work and he broke off
[47:52] that logos light
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] and began working and began working and
[47:57] began working and and here's he's in
[48:00] heaven and the angels are worshiping and
[48:02] and lucifer is the head of the choir
[48:04] right
[48:06] and the war in heaven happened
[48:12] and
[48:13] and the angels that followed lucifer
[48:16] fought against
[48:17] michael and his angels
[48:19] and were beaten and cast down
[48:21] to earth
[48:24] brother branham tells us
[48:26] he said
[48:29] those
[48:30] who fought against you were there
[48:33] amongst those who fought against lucifer
[48:34] and his angels
[48:36] you were there to tell him no
[48:41] and god the father was so
[48:44] proud of you
[48:47] that he said i'm going to let you do
[48:49] that one more time
[48:52] i'm going to
[48:53] put satan down on earth
[48:56] in a place in a space that is all his
[48:58] own
[48:59] that he thinks he has full control
[49:02] that he is in control of every aspect of
[49:04] life of government
[49:07] that he holds fear both in the animal
[49:10] population and through humanity
[49:14] you see because that's how satan has
[49:16] always worked
[49:17] is through fear
[49:20] it's to cause cast doubt and fear on the
[49:22] people that's even what he did
[49:25] with eve
[49:28] he caused doubt which causes fear
[49:32] they always run hand in hand
[49:34] he calls he cast doubt on god being a
[49:37] good god that would want eve to have
[49:39] everything that she should have
[49:41] by telling her
[49:43] why doesn't god want you to have this
[49:46] aren't you equal
[49:49] shouldn't you know both good and evil
[49:51] who is god to make that decision for you
[49:56] and now there's that little bit of doubt
[49:58] and now a fear of what's what's
[50:01] what's god hiding from me that i should
[50:02] know
[50:05] right that little bit of reasoning
[50:07] right
[50:10] and that fear took control
[50:13] now think about it now
[50:15] is if we're already
[50:17] in that stage
[50:19] in that place where we're folding over
[50:21] in time and eternity and you're walking
[50:24] with god we're about to head back into
[50:27] that place of
[50:28] eternity
[50:31] they were coming back to that place also
[50:35] where you're going to have to come back
[50:38] and do warfare
[50:41] just like in the beginning just like you
[50:43] did at that time with michael when satan
[50:46] was cast down
[50:48] but this time instead of satan being
[50:49] cast out of heaven
[50:51] he's going to be cast from his very own
[50:53] kingdom
[50:57] you see
[50:58] and it's not going to be michael doing
[51:00] it
[51:03] it's going to be
[51:04] michael through his bride
[51:08] go back read the message
[51:11] billy branham said
[51:12] god is allowing it
[51:15] so that the devil he's not going to need
[51:18] to come down and beat the devil himself
[51:20] but he's going to empower this little
[51:22] bride
[51:23] to do it for him
[51:26] he's going to show the devil i don't
[51:28] even need to do this
[51:29] my wife can do it
[51:32] you're so little and you're so
[51:34] insignificant
[51:36] i just send my wife to take care of you
[51:41] and but that's the place we're heading
[51:43] back to
[51:44] so these are the things that we need to
[51:46] be equipped with
[51:48] back to the original back to the
[51:51] the original where it was not a war a
[51:53] physical warfare
[51:55] but a spiritual warfare
[51:58] and that's what we're coming back to
[52:00] that's why
[52:01] you know
[52:02] as
[52:03] we head into this age and we look all
[52:05] around
[52:06] as you see more and more and more
[52:11] devices
[52:12] and mediums by which the devil can
[52:15] contact you
[52:16] you see because he's always lagging just
[52:19] a little bit behind the lord
[52:23] is when god begins working
[52:26] satan's always just trying to copy him
[52:28] that's right it's taken satan over 6
[52:31] thousand years
[52:32] to get to the point where he can share
[52:34] visions with his followers
[52:38] it's taken him six thousand years to get
[52:41] to a point
[52:43] where he can store up messages and share
[52:45] them with you at a later time
[52:48] god's been doing that from the beginning
[52:52] was as smart as the devil thinks he is
[52:55] it took him that many years to reach it
[52:58] and you know it was only by god's design
[53:04] in the last hundred years
[53:06] 150 years that we've seen technology
[53:09] just explode
[53:12] all over the place right yes
[53:14] the devil thought aha
[53:17] i got him now
[53:19] right
[53:22] i now have a way
[53:23] to contact the children of god
[53:26] every day every moment every hour and
[53:29] bombard them with my message
[53:36] but you know it was all in god's plan
[53:40] do you know why because he was sending a
[53:43] prophet to this last stage
[53:46] that he wanted his voice
[53:48] to continue on
[53:50] after he was gone
[53:53] and so he
[53:54] allowed that technology to be developed
[54:00] it wasn't because all of a sudden the
[54:02] devil got one up on god
[54:04] right
[54:05] the tape the radio the telephone
[54:08] the tape recorder the television
[54:12] the the car
[54:13] the airplane
[54:14] we we all see these as perhaps modern
[54:17] advances in science
[54:21] but they're not
[54:23] they were god allowing men
[54:25] to catch a revelation of something of
[54:28] which he would have a purpose and a use
[54:31] for what they would use that revelation
[54:33] to invent
[54:35] how hard would it been for the the
[54:37] prophet of this last day
[54:39] to go seven times around the world
[54:41] in a horse and cart
[54:48] he would have spent his whole life doing
[54:49] it and just barely maybe made it
[54:54] not only did he personally in physical
[54:57] form go around the world seven times
[55:02] but his voice
[55:04] by way of what people like to call
[55:06] scientific technology
[55:08] continues to wrap around this world and
[55:12] have influence far beyond that which
[55:14] anyone could have could even begin to
[55:17] imagine during his time on earth
[55:21] so here we are back again with the devil
[55:24] and you know we give we continue as a
[55:26] people of god to give the devil way too
[55:28] much credit
[55:32] we do
[55:33] every single day
[55:37] is always be careful with this
[55:39] technology be careful of that technology
[55:40] be careful
[55:41] yeah yeah you should be careful and you
[55:44] know how you should be careful
[55:48] increase your walk with the lord
[55:51] allow the holy spirit to be your guide
[55:54] whether you're walking down the street
[55:56] or walking down the pages of
[55:58] of a website or google or watching a
[56:02] youtube video
[56:04] that's right if the holy spirit is your
[56:06] guide
[56:09] there's no fear
[56:10] there's no fear
[56:14] he'll guide you lead you and guide you
[56:17] in all paths of righteousness
[56:21] no matter the
[56:22] the the way in which you get there
[56:26] there's no need to live in fear
[56:31] live in faith
[56:34] you see
[56:35] because
[56:36] we can put all
[56:38] the hindrances
[56:41] physical hindrances on sin we like
[56:44] but if the desire is still there for you
[56:47] it'll just be a matter of time like the
[56:49] children of israel
[56:52] you know
[56:52] under the bulls and goats for years and
[56:55] years and
[56:57] they had a good heart look at david
[57:00] a man after god's own heart
[57:02] do you think he started out in the
[57:04] morning like you know what
[57:06] today i feel like murdering somebody
[57:09] you know what today i feel like
[57:10] committing adultery
[57:13] no
[57:14] no
[57:15] he was a good man
[57:17] he was a godly man
[57:21] he wanted to do that which was right
[57:26] but he didn't have that keeping power
[57:32] and
[57:33] if all you do is stand there by way of
[57:35] good intentions
[57:37] you'll find yourself in the same place
[57:38] as david over and over again
[57:43] good intentions
[57:45] you'll even read your bible
[57:48] you'll you'll be praying
[57:51] but never surrendering
[57:54] never asking for the guidance of the
[57:56] holy spirit
[57:57] for the application
[57:59] of the reading and the praying
[58:02] you see there's something talking about
[58:03] the unseen world here and i'm just going
[58:05] to use a little bit of my own experience
[58:07] and i'm trying to keep an eye on the
[58:08] clock you know this is just a a little
[58:10] bit of a me and you
[58:12] talking here this evening
[58:14] and
[58:16] so let me just share from my own
[58:17] experience a little bit
[58:20] you know the idea of the unseen world
[58:22] comes from my background in in lab in
[58:25] the laboratory medical laboratory
[58:28] is most of the things
[58:30] by which we live and breathe
[58:33] are so small in my new
[58:36] they can never be seen by the the
[58:38] natural eye
[58:40] what we see
[58:42] is the end product of all those little
[58:45] things working together
[58:47] right
[58:48] like
[58:49] i see you you see me
[58:52] do you see blood cells no do you even
[58:55] see skin cells which is what everyone
[58:59] you would think if you would see
[59:00] anything that's what you would see
[59:07] they're everywhere
[59:08] by the trillions
[59:12] in in numbers you cannot even count
[59:19] in fact when we look at we just for the
[59:20] most part most people like it's skin
[59:23] as a whole it's just
[59:25] skin
[59:27] but if you take that skin
[59:30] and put it under a microscope
[59:33] it's not just one
[59:35] piece
[59:37] it's these little minute cells
[59:41] each one standing in their position
[59:44] each one doing their duty to protect the
[59:46] body
[59:49] and it's when even one of those cells
[59:52] is damaged hurt or removed
[59:55] that now
[59:56] there comes possibility
[1:00:00] for harm to enter the body
[1:00:03] that's how important each every and
[1:00:05] every individual cell is
[1:00:09] that's where things like cancers come
[1:00:11] from it's one
[1:00:13] of your cells
[1:00:15] it's not a foreign body to start with
[1:00:17] it's one of your cells stepping out of
[1:00:20] line
[1:00:22] and yet it's so small it's so minute
[1:00:26] that some of these cells in order to see
[1:00:27] them just recently i was in the lab
[1:00:30] and sitting at a microscope
[1:00:33] and you first
[1:00:35] the the microscope it's just what they
[1:00:37] call a simple light microscope i'm just
[1:00:39] going to share this guy every time i do
[1:00:41] i think it's so good
[1:00:43] it and it's so
[1:00:44] applicable to what we know of scripture
[1:00:47] okay
[1:00:49] is that
[1:00:50] first of all the area the areas that you
[1:00:52] look through have an automatic with a a
[1:00:54] 10x or 10 times magnification
[1:00:58] okay it's like binoculars you're looking
[1:01:00] like binoculars that you're looking
[1:01:01] through at the top i'm i'm sure we're
[1:01:03] all very um familiar with at least what
[1:01:05] microscopes look like
[1:01:07] and then down below you have
[1:01:10] on the microscope what they call
[1:01:11] objectives
[1:01:14] and each objective is of a greater power
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:18] typically i think you have a a 10x a 40x
[1:01:22] and a 100x
[1:01:24] which means you multiply
[1:01:27] the the binoculars that you're looking
[1:01:29] through at the top
[1:01:31] by the number of the objective and
[1:01:33] that's how many times it's multiplied
[1:01:36] what you're seeing
[1:01:37] so even the smallest one when you look
[1:01:39] at through it through the microscope is
[1:01:41] a hundred times
[1:01:43] larger in the microscope than it is
[1:01:45] actually physically
[1:01:48] and just to give you an idea
[1:01:50] is when you look at something at 100
[1:01:52] times larger
[1:01:53] some of these cells are still so small
[1:01:56] all you can do is barely make out their
[1:01:58] shape
[1:02:02] now you move up
[1:02:04] you use that 10x initially just to kind
[1:02:06] of find out where they're at
[1:02:08] on your slide
[1:02:11] to start identifying
[1:02:12] in what plane
[1:02:14] on the microscope what plane in the
[1:02:16] field they're at where are they located
[1:02:19] once you've located them now you can
[1:02:22] begin fine-tuning in
[1:02:23] you'll drop to the the 40x now that
[1:02:27] which you're looking at is
[1:02:28] 400 times larger than it is
[1:02:32] to the natural eye
[1:02:34] 400 times
[1:02:38] and even at 400 times larger
[1:02:41] many of these cells are still not large
[1:02:44] enough to fully identify
[1:02:48] to really get a true identification
[1:02:52] of what you're looking at you have to go
[1:02:54] to
[1:02:55] 100 x which is 1 000 times larger
[1:03:00] now there's something significant
[1:03:02] with this light microscope when i say
[1:03:04] light microscope what that means is that
[1:03:07] you're looking down
[1:03:09] the slide is a piece of glass that
[1:03:12] whatever you're wanting to look at is is
[1:03:14] a thin very thin layer of maybe just one
[1:03:17] or two cells thick is laid across that
[1:03:19] slide
[1:03:20] and underneath is a light shining up
[1:03:23] through it
[1:03:24] so that what you're identifying is
[1:03:26] whatever is that is blocking the light
[1:03:30] the light comes up around it and that is
[1:03:32] what it makes so that you can
[1:03:34] see it
[1:03:35] and you have to both focus in
[1:03:38] your vision
[1:03:40] on your
[1:03:41] oculars which is your lenses and you
[1:03:43] have to focus the light correctly or
[1:03:45] else it still won't work you won't see
[1:03:47] anything
[1:03:49] it has to all be in the right place the
[1:03:51] right time the right situation the right
[1:03:54] magnification the right amount of light
[1:03:58] because if you don't have the right
[1:04:00] amount of light you'll see shapes and
[1:04:03] shadowy stuff but it all just kind of
[1:04:05] blurs together in shadows
[1:04:08] you know that's how they were over the
[1:04:09] ages
[1:04:10] coming up dude first church age second
[1:04:13] church age luther wesley you name it
[1:04:16] they all began to focus in
[1:04:18] and the shapes were coming out of the
[1:04:20] scriptures for them
[1:04:23] but the light just wasn't quite right
[1:04:25] there wasn't enough light for them to
[1:04:27] fully identify it
[1:04:29] but it was it was it was coming to them
[1:04:30] they were seeing it they were seeing it
[1:04:32] and they were so excited
[1:04:36] but we're at age now here here's the
[1:04:39] thing that i think is so fascinating is
[1:04:42] when you get to 100x the objective is so
[1:04:45] close to the slide
[1:04:47] so close
[1:04:50] when you look at it if you were to look
[1:04:51] at the naked eye and try and see where
[1:04:54] the objective is and where the slide is
[1:04:56] to you it looks like they're touching
[1:04:59] but even at 100 times if you want true
[1:05:03] clarity
[1:05:04] you have to take a little bit
[1:05:07] of oil
[1:05:09] and put it on the slide
[1:05:11] and it's the connection of the oil
[1:05:13] between the slide and the objective
[1:05:16] that brings it into full clarity
[1:05:19] you see and that's how it is for us as
[1:05:21] well as christians
[1:05:24] is you know
[1:05:25] we've we've read the book
[1:05:27] we've read our textbook many many times
[1:05:30] backwards forwards sometimes we can
[1:05:32] quote it sometimes we we know the right
[1:05:34] quotes to tell the right people for the
[1:05:36] right situation and we feel good about
[1:05:38] it
[1:05:39] i know the material
[1:05:41] and then
[1:05:42] life hits us
[1:05:45] right
[1:05:48] and also we're like well i thought i
[1:05:49] knew all the right scriptures i thought
[1:05:51] i knew all the right quotes
[1:05:53] and
[1:05:54] it just feels so empty
[1:05:56] why does it feel so empty
[1:05:58] i'm quoting the scripture
[1:06:01] i'm quoting the scripture why is it not
[1:06:04] coming to life
[1:06:06] why am i not i try able to identify
[1:06:10] what is true for my situation right now
[1:06:14] why
[1:06:16] well check the light
[1:06:18] around the word
[1:06:20] is it is it the right light is it the
[1:06:23] right is it is it truly illuminated for
[1:06:26] you
[1:06:27] is god really showing you something
[1:06:29] there or you just parroting something
[1:06:32] that you've read
[1:06:34] have you become just a tape recorder
[1:06:36] that everything put in just feeds it
[1:06:38] back out
[1:06:41] doesn't just because the tape recorder
[1:06:42] can record something
[1:06:44] and then you can play it again doesn't
[1:06:45] mean the tape recorder has any knowledge
[1:06:47] or wisdom
[1:06:49] it was able to
[1:06:51] store some information and give the
[1:06:53] information back
[1:06:56] that's where many of especially young
[1:06:58] people in the message i can tell you
[1:07:01] from personal experience we grow up that
[1:07:03] way
[1:07:05] in the pews
[1:07:06] we know the terms we know the
[1:07:08] terminology we know the scriptures we
[1:07:11] know the quotes we know the the the
[1:07:13] what's supposed to be the the right
[1:07:15] doctrines and what are the false
[1:07:16] doctrines and what are the you know all
[1:07:19] the different isms and the message
[1:07:21] and we know the quote to use to to
[1:07:23] combat that and we know this and we know
[1:07:25] that
[1:07:29] but it takes a real revelation it takes
[1:07:32] a personal experience
[1:07:34] beyond that of just textbook learning
[1:07:38] you see
[1:07:39] and that's something even i've
[1:07:41] experienced even in the natural
[1:07:44] just very down down home here tonight
[1:07:47] and you can take this in in anything
[1:07:49] that you've learned think about it
[1:07:52] is
[1:07:54] when it comes to identifying
[1:07:57] certain blood cells
[1:07:59] and their different stages you know a
[1:08:01] blood cell is not just a blood cell
[1:08:03] you know blood cells goes through
[1:08:04] different stages of growth to maturity
[1:08:08] and until it reaches maturity it is not
[1:08:10] fully functional
[1:08:12] or capable of fully assisting the body
[1:08:20] it's like
[1:08:21] many of us we go through the same thing
[1:08:24] right we're young christians we're on
[1:08:25] fire we're we're revved up and ready to
[1:08:28] go and save the world
[1:08:30] but we don't have the right maturity and
[1:08:32] experience
[1:08:34] so a lot of times we run around just
[1:08:36] spinning our wheels right
[1:08:40] if you think i'm doing this for god i'm
[1:08:41] doing this for god i'm doing this did
[1:08:43] god want you to do that that's right
[1:08:46] or we we think we're doing all these
[1:08:48] things we we testify to somebody and
[1:08:50] we're we we are like the child that
[1:08:53] plants a seed
[1:08:55] the child you ever seen a little kid
[1:08:57] when growing a garden
[1:08:59] they go out with their mom and they put
[1:09:00] seeds in the ground
[1:09:02] and the very next morning they run out
[1:09:04] and they perch themselves over
[1:09:07] over the ground like this
[1:09:09] staring into the ground where they put
[1:09:10] that seed
[1:09:12] and unless their mother stops them
[1:09:15] they will take their fingers and dig
[1:09:17] that seed back up to find out if it's
[1:09:19] growing
[1:09:22] many of us as young christians expect
[1:09:25] the same thing when we sow seeds
[1:09:28] is we run out and we plant a seed and
[1:09:30] we're expecting we're over watching over
[1:09:32] the balcony we're watching over the
[1:09:34] watching them okay any moment now you
[1:09:37] should sprout
[1:09:39] we don't know what what
[1:09:42] conditions are for that seed maybe it's
[1:09:44] a seed that takes a lot longer
[1:09:45] germination period maybe it's not one or
[1:09:49] two days or three days maybe it's a week
[1:09:52] but it doesn't come up in 24 hours or
[1:09:54] like
[1:09:54] i knew it bad seed
[1:09:58] wasn't meant to be
[1:10:01] write them off
[1:10:02] no no no no
[1:10:04] stop it stop it calm down
[1:10:07] god had you plant a seed that's good
[1:10:10] don't worry about it paul fully covered
[1:10:12] this he said he said some have have
[1:10:15] planted some have watered but god brings
[1:10:18] the increase
[1:10:19] he said stop worrying about it plant
[1:10:22] your seeds share your water and let god
[1:10:25] do the work
[1:10:27] stop trying to do it yourself whether
[1:10:29] it's in you or somebody else
[1:10:31] if you do it you're going to dig up the
[1:10:33] seed and you're going to kill it
[1:10:36] and god's going to have to start all
[1:10:37] over again
[1:10:40] see that's where it is you're
[1:10:41] frustrating god it's like he's like come
[1:10:44] on
[1:10:45] just do the part i asked you to do and
[1:10:47] then let me take it from there
[1:10:49] stop trying to do it all yourself it's
[1:10:51] not going to work
[1:10:52] it's not going to work
[1:10:55] all right i think i kind of rabbit
[1:10:56] trailed there all right
[1:10:58] but that's that's the point is that
[1:11:02] we're so
[1:11:04] anxious
[1:11:05] to see something
[1:11:09] we did
[1:11:11] the results of it
[1:11:13] we're so out to see
[1:11:15] our own
[1:11:17] um
[1:11:20] achievements
[1:11:22] we want to see our own achievements for
[1:11:24] god and we we forget
[1:11:27] it's not your achievement for god
[1:11:30] it's what god's achieving through you
[1:11:33] but it's all god's achievements
[1:11:36] every time
[1:11:37] so that's what it is and so sometimes
[1:11:39] we're we're in these different states of
[1:11:40] maturity and although we can be of some
[1:11:43] use to the body
[1:11:45] we got to keep growing we got to keep
[1:11:47] growing we got to keep coming to that
[1:11:49] full maturity that paul spoke about
[1:11:52] that place where now
[1:11:55] you're at a place of functionality where
[1:11:57] you can really help the body in the
[1:12:00] place
[1:12:01] that god has placed you
[1:12:03] you see because each cell
[1:12:05] each type of cell has its own function
[1:12:08] in the body
[1:12:10] they don't do all the same thing
[1:12:12] they're not all red blood cells running
[1:12:13] around sharing oxygen with everybody
[1:12:16] here you feel better and you feel better
[1:12:18] and you feel better
[1:12:21] that's not what they all do
[1:12:23] some of them are just
[1:12:25] soldiers
[1:12:27] of the cross
[1:12:29] that are there as constant watchmen over
[1:12:31] the body
[1:12:33] so that when there is
[1:12:35] harm that enters the body they are there
[1:12:37] to respond
[1:12:39] they're in constant prayer and
[1:12:40] supplication
[1:12:41] they're not a part of the choir
[1:12:43] they're that prayer warrior off in the
[1:12:45] corner
[1:12:46] they all serve a different function
[1:12:49] and yet
[1:12:50] none greater or less
[1:12:54] than the other
[1:12:55] you see we all we we like to weigh
[1:12:58] things by what we can see right now
[1:13:01] because that's how we weigh achievement
[1:13:02] especially in today's age right
[1:13:03] everything has to happen quick quick
[1:13:04] quick quick
[1:13:06] you know even even our internet speed
[1:13:08] today if if if we look search for
[1:13:10] something right now and it doesn't
[1:13:11] happen in less than a hundredth of a
[1:13:13] second it's like what's wrong with the
[1:13:16] internet right
[1:13:18] but how many of y'all i
[1:13:21] i am just old enough
[1:13:23] to where i was around for the beginning
[1:13:24] of the internet
[1:13:26] some of you kids who don't remember that
[1:13:30] but all of you who remember dial-up
[1:13:34] it would take you
[1:13:35] an hour
[1:13:37] to download a video
[1:13:40] that would take that was when you
[1:13:41] watched it was less than five minutes
[1:13:46] and now if it takes five minutes to
[1:13:48] download a one hour video we're bothered
[1:13:52] you see
[1:13:53] but it's just increasing increasingly
[1:13:56] it's that the age is so rushed it's so
[1:13:59] pushed it's but even god is in that
[1:14:01] stage where he said unless i cut time
[1:14:04] short
[1:14:06] he said everything is speeding up to the
[1:14:08] end
[1:14:09] it's all coming to a culmination
[1:14:11] why because we're going back why is that
[1:14:14] you see all of the things in this
[1:14:15] natural world speeding up
[1:14:17] because we're going back
[1:14:20] to the beginning
[1:14:21] where god said my people will travel as
[1:14:23] a thought
[1:14:25] just like
[1:14:27] just like the evangelist did
[1:14:30] and went out to the um
[1:14:34] i know the story but i'm i'm blanking on
[1:14:36] the name so you help me
[1:14:38] but
[1:14:39] there he was he was the evangelist there
[1:14:41] in the new testament
[1:14:43] and he was called to the
[1:14:46] ethiopian eunuch
[1:14:49] philip thank you
[1:14:50] phillip
[1:14:53] you know he traveled as a thought and it
[1:14:56] wasn't his thought
[1:14:58] so that tells us something we always
[1:15:00] think well if i could travel as a
[1:15:01] thought well that's the problem that's
[1:15:03] why you're not traveling as a thought
[1:15:04] yet
[1:15:05] because your thoughts just go way too
[1:15:07] many places too quickly
[1:15:09] you would end up in more trouble
[1:15:11] than you could handle
[1:15:13] if you were traveling as a thought right
[1:15:14] now most of you would already been left
[1:15:17] and come back to this room five or ten
[1:15:18] times already
[1:15:21] but
[1:15:21] philip traveled as a thought
[1:15:24] in the father's service
[1:15:27] you see that
[1:15:29] is he was so in tune with what god was
[1:15:32] having him do
[1:15:33] is here he was in a major revival
[1:15:39] and he was so in tune
[1:15:41] that it wasn't even a matter of philip
[1:15:43] do you want to do this his moment philip
[1:15:45] is standing here preaching to the crowds
[1:15:47] and next moment he's on the side of the
[1:15:48] road and he looks down the road and
[1:15:50] here's this eunuch in his chariot
[1:15:53] miles and miles away
[1:15:56] just like that
[1:15:59] philip didn't go like huh i wonder if
[1:16:01] there's anyone that i have not reaching
[1:16:03] at this revival that i should be talking
[1:16:04] to
[1:16:06] lord
[1:16:07] is there anyone else
[1:16:08] where should i be going
[1:16:10] will you take me there quickly
[1:16:12] it didn't take that he was so in tune
[1:16:15] with the leading of the spirit
[1:16:18] that that him and god were thinking as
[1:16:20] one in the moment
[1:16:23] and he was so led of the spirit
[1:16:25] that when the spirit took picked him up
[1:16:27] and took him
[1:16:29] it didn't even phase him
[1:16:31] like he doesn't say philip landed on the
[1:16:33] road he was rather dazed he didn't know
[1:16:34] where he was at or what he should do
[1:16:37] it says philip landed on the road
[1:16:40] and the first thing he does
[1:16:41] is he hears the the
[1:16:44] ethiopian eunuch reading the
[1:16:46] scriptures yeah
[1:16:48] and he just walks over like he's been on
[1:16:49] the road the whole time
[1:16:51] and walks up to the chariot and says hey
[1:16:54] do you know what it is that you're
[1:16:55] reading
[1:16:58] he didn't like what he was doing didn't
[1:17:00] even slow down
[1:17:02] he went from one service of the lord to
[1:17:04] the next
[1:17:06] see this is what we're going back to
[1:17:10] god is walking us back
[1:17:13] is that we're so even within our own
[1:17:16] cells sometimes
[1:17:18] we're
[1:17:20] so worried about what someone would
[1:17:21] think or someone will do or what what
[1:17:23] they would say
[1:17:25] that
[1:17:27] when god does move on us to say
[1:17:29] something we're like oh i don't know
[1:17:31] what they think of me
[1:17:33] what
[1:17:34] well
[1:17:35] if god's moving on you to say it say it
[1:17:38] if god's moving on you to do it do it
[1:17:41] no i say make sure he's the one moving
[1:17:43] on you
[1:17:44] that you're not moving of your own
[1:17:46] volition you're not that immature
[1:17:48] christian that's just running wild
[1:17:52] but if he's the one moving
[1:17:54] and you know when he's moving right you
[1:17:56] don't
[1:17:57] you don't need to be like i don't know
[1:18:00] tonight
[1:18:01] when when we that song right as when i
[1:18:04] came up
[1:18:05] brother hillary had started leading it
[1:18:07] and you could just feel the presence of
[1:18:08] god come down
[1:18:10] was there any question as you moved into
[1:18:13] worship is god here
[1:18:14] is god moving on me right now
[1:18:17] absolutely not
[1:18:19] you just moved
[1:18:21] just like that
[1:18:23] so if you're in a situation and god's
[1:18:25] moving on you
[1:18:26] you'll know because it'll just it'll be
[1:18:28] that natural it'll be like philip
[1:18:30] being transported of the spirit
[1:18:33] you'll just be transported into the
[1:18:35] right time the right place and the right
[1:18:38] things to say
[1:18:39] you won't have to think about it because
[1:18:41] it's a promise
[1:18:42] he said when you come before kings and
[1:18:44] potentates
[1:18:47] he said don't worry
[1:18:49] about what it is that you will
[1:18:51] say
[1:18:52] i will put the words in your mouth
[1:18:55] so don't worry even if you're not the
[1:18:57] overly evangelistical type
[1:19:00] maybe god did not give you the spirit of
[1:19:03] an evangelist
[1:19:05] maybe he gave you the more a lesser
[1:19:07] spirit of a teacher or spirit of someone
[1:19:10] who who's just got a word of wisdom or
[1:19:12] whatever it is
[1:19:14] when god moves on you to share your gift
[1:19:17] with someone you'll know
[1:19:19] and all you've got to do is yield you
[1:19:22] see
[1:19:24] personally i i don't see myself as a as
[1:19:26] with an evangelistical gift i see many
[1:19:29] i've been around many people that that
[1:19:31] do
[1:19:32] and men they're on the street they're
[1:19:34] everyone they meet is just they're
[1:19:36] they're interacting they're they're
[1:19:37] drawing on them you see evangelists when
[1:19:39] they get up here and minister to us they
[1:19:42] just have a way about them that that
[1:19:44] they're they they're able to stir you up
[1:19:47] and that's what that's their gift
[1:19:50] but even without that you don't think
[1:19:53] well it's not really that's i'm not an
[1:19:55] evangelist no but god will call you to
[1:19:58] use your gift that he gave you
[1:20:00] to speak to somebody
[1:20:04] you know many times for me it's it's not
[1:20:07] in that evangelistical way but i'll find
[1:20:09] that
[1:20:10] after a
[1:20:11] certain period of time when either i've
[1:20:12] been with someone or worked with someone
[1:20:14] or been in a certain environment
[1:20:17] that also they'll start asking questions
[1:20:20] what about this what about that what
[1:20:22] about
[1:20:23] and when they ask questions
[1:20:25] i give them answers
[1:20:28] and god i've been in situations where i
[1:20:30] was about to leave work
[1:20:32] and this young man
[1:20:35] who
[1:20:36] was more agnostic
[1:20:38] no real belief
[1:20:41] he began asking me questions
[1:20:44] you know i stood there for 20 minutes
[1:20:45] talking to him
[1:20:48] in the middle
[1:20:49] of a laboratory where
[1:20:51] you know they say that the term is a
[1:20:54] that when people are are swearing they
[1:20:56] swear like a sailor but if you've ever
[1:20:58] been in the medical field especially in
[1:21:00] areas where there's no patience and man
[1:21:01] and limited management
[1:21:04] they would put sailors to shame
[1:21:08] because there is no nothing sacred
[1:21:12] that all the things that they interact
[1:21:13] with and all the things that they do
[1:21:16] nothing is holy or sacred anymore
[1:21:20] and and
[1:21:21] to be able to stand in that environment
[1:21:26] unabashed and unashamed i'm not saying i
[1:21:29] i was trying to push what i believe down
[1:21:31] anyone else's throat but as long as he
[1:21:33] was asking the questions i was given
[1:21:36] providing the answers yeah and it wasn't
[1:21:38] me i hadn't like studied up and okay i'm
[1:21:41] pretty sure and then we're in a whole
[1:21:43] different part of the world with a
[1:21:44] different set of people i'm pretty sure
[1:21:46] david someday is going to ask me
[1:21:48] questions
[1:21:50] would never have thought it from him
[1:21:52] never in a million years as they say
[1:21:57] but i lived a life
[1:22:00] that was that that was exemplary of a
[1:22:04] christian life
[1:22:05] in the best way i knew how
[1:22:07] every day when i went into work i said
[1:22:09] lord i would stop in the parking lot
[1:22:11] before going in i said lord give me
[1:22:13] favor and grace with those i work with
[1:22:16] and let me live and act in a way
[1:22:20] that is pleasing
[1:22:21] and of that which would be acceptable of
[1:22:25] a christian life
[1:22:29] you see because me and you we don't
[1:22:31] notice so much
[1:22:33] the fact that we don't do this or don't
[1:22:35] do that we just don't do it
[1:22:38] but in these environments
[1:22:40] the fact that you do not do or act or
[1:22:43] say certain things
[1:22:44] stands out like a like a beacon of light
[1:22:47] on a hill
[1:22:50] and they notice and they're going to
[1:22:52] watch you
[1:22:53] and they're going to test you
[1:22:55] so don't get upset when they test you to
[1:22:56] say thank the lord they are interested
[1:23:00] that's why if they weren't interested
[1:23:02] they just leave you alone
[1:23:05] but anytime
[1:23:06] there's a new mechanism
[1:23:08] or a new invention do you know what they
[1:23:10] do with it they test it
[1:23:12] something they've never seen before
[1:23:15] right
[1:23:16] i mean that's that's our especially as
[1:23:17] as kids the first time you see an animal
[1:23:19] you've never seen before out in the
[1:23:21] woods or a bug the first thing you do
[1:23:24] isn't like oh that's a nice bug i'll
[1:23:25] leave it alone
[1:23:27] you pick up a stick
[1:23:30] and you poke it see does it jump does it
[1:23:32] run does it what's its characteristics
[1:23:36] and not just what is its characteristics
[1:23:38] when i'm looking at it and watching it
[1:23:39] but when i poke it what does it do
[1:23:43] and that's what the whole world is doing
[1:23:44] with you too
[1:23:46] is there like well you know why
[1:23:49] because
[1:23:50] america and the west the west has been
[1:23:53] so scoured over
[1:23:55] with christianity so-called
[1:23:58] with religion
[1:24:00] everyone's a christian brother branham
[1:24:02] addressed this way back in the 50s and
[1:24:04] 60s he would ask someone are you a
[1:24:06] christian well i'm an american i didn't
[1:24:08] ask you that are you a christian i'm a
[1:24:10] baptist but are you a christian
[1:24:14] and you know that's the same question
[1:24:16] everyone else has too
[1:24:19] is they've met all the people who claim
[1:24:21] to be christians yes
[1:24:23] and they poke them before and they went
[1:24:25] they ain't nothing to them they're just
[1:24:27] like me
[1:24:29] and i ain't got no need for something
[1:24:31] some religion
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:35] doesn't do anything more for me than
[1:24:36] what i got now
[1:24:39] but when they see something so different
[1:24:42] they say maybe there's something to this
[1:24:44] but i won't know until it's been tested
[1:24:48] and you get upset because you're like ah
[1:24:50] that boss that co-worker they were all
[1:24:52] over me all day today they were
[1:24:53] bothering me that make me so upset
[1:24:56] that's something you need to work on and
[1:24:57] i don't mean the co-worker i mean you
[1:24:58] and your anger problem
[1:25:02] that's something you need to be talking
[1:25:03] to the lord about
[1:25:05] you me whatever it is
[1:25:08] they so annoy me well that's also
[1:25:11] something you need to be talking to the
[1:25:12] lord about yes because he's been
[1:25:14] long-suffering with all of us
[1:25:17] and we claim to believe this message we
[1:25:19] claim to be christians
[1:25:22] and we still have our failings and our
[1:25:24] trip ups every day every day i know i do
[1:25:30] and i know that all the prophets both
[1:25:32] current and of old when i read their
[1:25:34] stories they say they did
[1:25:37] amen every day
[1:25:39] and yet because someone who claims
[1:25:42] nothing
[1:25:44] acts in a way that is less than
[1:25:46] conducive to that of christianity we get
[1:25:48] upset about it
[1:25:53] by what means are you measuring them
[1:25:57] are you measuring by this them by the
[1:25:59] same means that you measure yourself
[1:26:02] and then second of all
[1:26:04] are you granting them the same grace
[1:26:07] and mercy that god has granted you
[1:26:13] i tell you this
[1:26:15] if you're struggling to get along with
[1:26:16] somebody at work at school
[1:26:19] at some type of public function
[1:26:23] just start
[1:26:25] treating them the way god has treated
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:28] since the day you were born
[1:26:30] amen you know what
[1:26:32] it may not change who they are
[1:26:34] completely but your interactions under
[1:26:37] them will change
[1:26:38] you know why
[1:26:39] because your approach to them will
[1:26:40] change
[1:26:42] your reaction to their actions will
[1:26:44] change
[1:26:46] and they won't know what to do with that
[1:26:51] but if you react the same way to them
[1:26:52] that everyone else does
[1:26:55] then they don't see you as different
[1:26:56] than anybody else
[1:26:59] but god is calling us higher
[1:27:01] he's calling us to a higher level he's
[1:27:03] calling us to a higher maturity
[1:27:06] you see
[1:27:08] where we enter in
[1:27:10] that's what it's all about it's about an
[1:27:12] everyday life
[1:27:14] and yet it's all being worked on behind
[1:27:17] the scenes
[1:27:19] by the unseen world
[1:27:21] you see because we think it's a
[1:27:22] co-worker we think it's a brother we
[1:27:24] think it's a sister we think it's
[1:27:26] someone against us but it's not
[1:27:28] it's that same old devil that was thrown
[1:27:31] out of heaven
[1:27:34] that's tormenting these poor people
[1:27:36] and instead of helping them
[1:27:38] you're aiding him by tormenting them too
[1:27:42] you see you thought what i said was
[1:27:44] that's that old devil trying to torment
[1:27:46] you through those people oh he he would
[1:27:48] like that
[1:27:51] but when you
[1:27:54] do anything less
[1:27:56] then approach them with the grace and
[1:27:58] love of god
[1:28:00] you are aiding and abetting the enemy
[1:28:04] in tormenting that poor soul
[1:28:08] because
[1:28:09] god expects more out of you
[1:28:14] from whom
[1:28:15] much has been given
[1:28:17] much is expected
[1:28:19] you see
[1:28:21] when jesus came
[1:28:23] and i'm just gonna
[1:28:24] i'm gonna skip way ahead here
[1:28:28] finish just saying a few things
[1:28:31] but when jesus came
[1:28:33] and he approached the law
[1:28:35] he said i came not to destroy the law
[1:28:39] but to fulfill
[1:28:40] it i came not to take away
[1:28:44] the commandments but to actually magnify
[1:28:47] the commandments
[1:28:49] why
[1:28:50] because the grace that i'm bringing
[1:28:54] and the overcoming power associated with
[1:28:56] it
[1:28:57] is great enough now to where i
[1:29:00] believe i know
[1:29:03] that if you'll accept
[1:29:05] my leadership
[1:29:07] under the tutelage of the holy spirit
[1:29:10] you
[1:29:11] can
[1:29:13] live up to
[1:29:14] the new standards
[1:29:17] that's why he didn't take these things
[1:29:19] like oh adultery don't worry about it no
[1:29:21] more all under the blood he said
[1:29:23] adultery
[1:29:24] no
[1:29:25] it's not just a physical act anymore
[1:29:28] he said
[1:29:29] if a man even looks upon a woman
[1:29:31] he's committed adultery in his heart
[1:29:34] why because we're going back to the
[1:29:36] original battle
[1:29:37] which is not a flesh and blood battle
[1:29:40] but it's a spiritual level we wrestle
[1:29:42] not about its flesh and blood
[1:29:44] against spiritual powers of the air
[1:29:47] so the only way you can beat it is if
[1:29:49] you if it's challenged at its
[1:29:51] origination
[1:29:53] you see by the time you get to the act
[1:29:56] the spiritual part is far
[1:29:58] done and over
[1:29:59] but if we can cut it off here
[1:30:02] at the spirit
[1:30:03] you don't have to have to worry about
[1:30:05] the physical
[1:30:06] you see physical is always only a
[1:30:08] manifestation
[1:30:10] of the spiritual right
[1:30:12] so that's where we can see and watch
[1:30:14] ourselves not to beat ourselves down now
[1:30:17] don't don't take it that way
[1:30:18] because that's also let me actually let
[1:30:21] me just read you a brief quote so i
[1:30:23] think it will tie into this uh here
[1:30:26] is here's brother branham in actually
[1:30:28] the message the prophet elisha in 1954
[1:30:31] and he's in a prayer line
[1:30:32] and this ties into the the unseen world
[1:30:35] and he's got a young man in front of him
[1:30:37] and he says how do you do young man do
[1:30:39] you believe me to be the servant of god
[1:30:41] many other servants are here but i am
[1:30:43] his servant immediately
[1:30:46] there's a spirit pulling from this young
[1:30:47] man this boy is in trouble
[1:30:50] he's deeply in trouble this boy is some
[1:30:53] suffering with a mental disorder
[1:30:56] okay
[1:30:58] now
[1:31:00] back then it was
[1:31:02] very little talked about in the 50s and
[1:31:04] 60s mental disorders they had asylums
[1:31:07] and things like that but
[1:31:09] today
[1:31:11] if you had to build asylums
[1:31:13] for all the people with mental disorders
[1:31:16] anxieties and depressions
[1:31:19] and
[1:31:20] and identity disorders of of
[1:31:25] identity crisis
[1:31:28] we just build a big fence around the
[1:31:30] world
[1:31:31] and keep everybody in which has to guess
[1:31:34] what we're already doing
[1:31:37] because it's gone from these physical
[1:31:39] attributes the warfare is no longer that
[1:31:43] of the ten commandments don't steal
[1:31:45] don't kill don't commit adultery
[1:31:48] worship no other god but it's going back
[1:31:51] to the original spiritual warfare that
[1:31:54] it was in the beginning
[1:31:56] on every level
[1:31:58] that's why it's so afflicting the minds
[1:32:01] of the people
[1:32:03] is it's a warfare at
[1:32:05] within their spirit
[1:32:07] and when the spirit is so torn up it
[1:32:10] destroys the mind that's right
[1:32:12] you see
[1:32:14] and that's where we're all at
[1:32:16] is we're trying to fix
[1:32:18] our we're trying to look for identity in
[1:32:20] all the wrong places
[1:32:22] we're trying to find a fix for something
[1:32:24] that's a mental or spiritual disorder
[1:32:29] in a physical realm
[1:32:31] the whole world is
[1:32:33] now the whole rest of the world is doing
[1:32:34] it
[1:32:36] because they don't want to admit that
[1:32:38] there's a spiritual application
[1:32:41] because that takes them in places that
[1:32:43] scares them to death
[1:32:48] true
[1:32:51] but to admit that it's spiritual for us
[1:32:53] should bring us great joy
[1:32:58] you know why
[1:32:59] because we are made more than conquerors
[1:33:02] the battle's already been won
[1:33:06] we just sang a song
[1:33:09] where all
[1:33:10] our sins
[1:33:11] are forgiven
[1:33:14] we can read the scripture where our
[1:33:16] identity is in christ
[1:33:19] that alone is enough to cure
[1:33:21] all the identity issues
[1:33:23] we don't need to do long deep searches
[1:33:26] into who we are
[1:33:30] we are one with christ
[1:33:33] if you'll just enter into christ
[1:33:35] you'll know your exact identity
[1:33:38] it won't be a problem no more
[1:33:42] you got depression you have anxieties
[1:33:45] you have fears
[1:33:46] they don't just go i know that it's not
[1:33:48] as simple as well just believe and and
[1:33:51] walk on like many do and then when when
[1:33:53] you still have an issue like i thought
[1:33:54] you believed yeah but god god's got his
[1:33:57] own time he's got his own
[1:34:00] situation
[1:34:01] the situation is different for everyone
[1:34:02] and god will deliver you
[1:34:04] and
[1:34:06] bring you out of that thing on his time
[1:34:08] when he's ready
[1:34:09] because he's got a purpose for it
[1:34:11] he's going to have a reason for it that
[1:34:14] trouble you went through that situation
[1:34:15] when you went through that battle the
[1:34:17] mind that you're going through
[1:34:19] he's building character he's working on
[1:34:21] you he's he's rubbing off the sharp
[1:34:23] edges
[1:34:24] like it's all these things that
[1:34:26] but yet in the end he said i will
[1:34:28] deliver you
[1:34:31] the end result is your deliverance is
[1:34:33] coming just hold on
[1:34:36] just hold on
[1:34:39] let god do the work
[1:34:42] deliverance is on its way
[1:34:46] but so many times we we just can't wait
[1:34:49] for god to do it
[1:34:51] we're in such a hurry
[1:34:54] um
[1:34:55] here it is me this young boy he's got a
[1:34:57] mental disorder
[1:34:58] now out of all the diseases that brother
[1:35:01] random faced
[1:35:03] you know he talks about the the cancers
[1:35:05] and things that grows on people's necks
[1:35:07] that he would pray and they'd fall off
[1:35:09] on the platform
[1:35:11] well that was a physical
[1:35:12] manifestation everyone in that audience
[1:35:15] could see it
[1:35:16] recognize it identify it
[1:35:18] there was a tumor here the tumor is on
[1:35:20] the ground person no longer has a tumor
[1:35:23] right
[1:35:24] or maybe some type of illness like
[1:35:26] that that relative of florence
[1:35:28] nightingale over there in england yeah
[1:35:31] where the picture shows so
[1:35:33] skin and bones
[1:35:36] and beyond hope all medical science has
[1:35:38] written her off
[1:35:40] to the point where she even when brother
[1:35:42] man went to pray for her
[1:35:44] she yeah she went her prayer her thing
[1:35:46] to ask for the random four was pray god
[1:35:49] just let me die
[1:35:51] that's right
[1:35:52] that was where she was at yeah
[1:35:56] and so everyone can look at that wow
[1:35:57] physical manifestation right
[1:36:01] and yet here's this young man
[1:36:03] trapped within his own mind trapped
[1:36:06] within his own spirit
[1:36:08] we could have a unlimited number of
[1:36:11] physical ailments
[1:36:13] you could be lame you could be blind you
[1:36:15] could be death
[1:36:18] and yet be free
[1:36:20] in the holy spirit
[1:36:23] be free to worship god
[1:36:26] be unhindered
[1:36:28] god moving on your life
[1:36:31] have no effect
[1:36:34] on your walk with god
[1:36:40] and yet this young man
[1:36:42] is so bound up in his own mind
[1:36:46] so bound up spiritually the devil's got
[1:36:49] him so tied up
[1:36:51] he doesn't even know who he is
[1:36:53] he's lacking and missing his identity
[1:36:58] even to christ
[1:37:00] or how about especially to christ
[1:37:05] and here
[1:37:06] really random praise for him
[1:37:18] he says let me just read this whole
[1:37:19] portion here
[1:37:20] you've just come from an institution and
[1:37:22] i see them giving you some kind of shock
[1:37:24] treatment they give you a shock
[1:37:26] treatments and you have an a phobia
[1:37:29] that is you see a face before you all
[1:37:31] the time and it's your mother's face
[1:37:33] that you see
[1:37:34] you're a married man you have a wife and
[1:37:36] two children jesus christ come along and
[1:37:39] delivered the man of gadara
[1:37:41] that that could deliver the man of
[1:37:43] gadara is here tonight to deliver you
[1:37:45] from this and take that phobia from you
[1:37:48] and drive the devil from you know a
[1:37:50] phobia is simply a a fancy word for fear

[1:38:16] would you bow your heads and be reverend
[1:38:18] by the way i'm speaking to the crowd
[1:38:20] this
[1:38:21] is very treacherous
[1:38:23] and dangerous
[1:38:25] keep your head bowed
[1:38:28] till you hear my voice say
[1:38:30] raise your head
[1:38:33] here he is the prophet of god
[1:38:35] entering into spiritual warfare
[1:38:38] for this young man's life you say what
[1:38:40] what do you mean this young man in life
[1:38:41] he's a fine specimen of
[1:38:44] a human being
[1:38:46] maybe he was athletic maybe he was
[1:38:47] powerful strong in body
[1:38:50] the body has nothing to do
[1:38:52] with your life
[1:38:58] here young man
[1:38:59] before i ask this blessing i'm going to
[1:39:01] ask you something will you obey me as
[1:39:03] his servant and do as i tell you to do
[1:39:06] you're going to get well
[1:39:08] the time of deliverance is at hand
[1:39:11] this is a devil doing this young man he
[1:39:14] would drive you stark mad keep you that
[1:39:16] way the rest of your life
[1:39:18] but god can restore you
[1:39:20] in your right mind and right mental
[1:39:23] condition
[1:39:28] i see another thing you've been to
[1:39:29] psychiatrists they have see somebody
[1:39:33] trying to talk to you but that's not the
[1:39:35] idea
[1:39:36] it takes more than that for you
[1:39:39] it takes the power of the living god you
[1:39:42] understand me
[1:39:43] if you don't you will in a moment
[1:39:45] bow your head
[1:39:47] in reverence and believe that god raised
[1:39:49] his son jesus to deliver you
[1:39:51] heavenly father this young man stands
[1:39:53] here
[1:39:54] fine looking young fellow standing here
[1:39:56] in the stature of young manhood
[1:39:59] and satan has come to him to tear up his
[1:40:01] home
[1:40:02] break up his family and drive this young
[1:40:04] man out into the wilds
[1:40:07] but o god who made heavens and earth
[1:40:10] who created all things through christ
[1:40:12] jesus
[1:40:14] i come as your servant
[1:40:16] in a prayer of faith
[1:40:18] for this young man
[1:40:20] knowing that just now he can't have
[1:40:23] faith for himself
[1:40:25] because of his conditions
[1:40:28] lord
[1:40:29] hear the prayer of your servant
[1:40:32] and satan
[1:40:35] is haunting at him
[1:40:36] and making his life a misery
[1:40:39] but the lord jesus that set the maniac
[1:40:42] free
[1:40:43] that was
[1:40:44] far beyond this boy
[1:40:47] you can make this boy well tonight and
[1:40:50] satan
[1:40:51] you who bound him
[1:40:52] you've escaped the psychiatrist
[1:40:55] you've escaped the medical treatments
[1:40:58] but you can't escape the power of god
[1:41:01] come out of him in the name of jesus
[1:41:03] christ go from him
[1:41:06] young man and i was speaking to the
[1:41:08] young man
[1:41:09] look here now it's over you're healed
[1:41:12] don't smoke anymore
[1:41:14] live like a real christian
[1:41:17] go giving god praise
[1:41:19] and sing his praise
[1:41:21] day and night
[1:41:22] raise up your hands and give him thanks
[1:41:24] for your healing you feel all right now
[1:41:26] don't you
[1:41:28] the boy says he's feeling fine
[1:41:30] now everything's gone
[1:41:33] when it went an evil spirit went that
[1:41:36] way with random points of direction
[1:41:41] god in heaven knows i am not a fanatic
[1:41:44] we'll be judged at the day of judgment
[1:41:47] the thing world passed
[1:41:49] out of the boy
[1:41:51] going in that direction
[1:41:53] it even felt like a wind
[1:41:55] going like that when it left him
[1:41:57] the evil powers left the boy
[1:42:01] go get to your wife and family and
[1:42:03] rejoice and be happy rejoice in the lord
[1:42:06] bring the lady he's speaking about the
[1:42:08] next person and how he goes back
[1:42:11] the first time visible that i've seen an
[1:42:14] evil thing leave someone for a long time
[1:42:18] it passed by like a bat like that going
[1:42:20] from one side
[1:42:25] and then he goes to begin praying for
[1:42:27] the next person here
[1:42:40] but speaking of the unseen
[1:42:44] you see
[1:42:47] it's like that microscope
[1:42:50] is if you don't have
[1:42:53] the right way
[1:42:55] you don't have the right influences
[1:42:57] you don't have the right anointing oil
[1:43:01] on the word
[1:43:04] you won't see it
[1:43:06] you won't even feel it
[1:43:09] see here brother branham
[1:43:11] he said i felt it
[1:43:13] i heard it
[1:43:14] i saw it
[1:43:17] you know how many other people in the
[1:43:18] room saw that
[1:43:19] probably none
[1:43:21] maybe somebody
[1:43:23] likelihood none because
[1:43:25] i don't see here anywhere in this quote
[1:43:27] where it says someone's shrieking in the
[1:43:29] crowd
[1:43:32] so i'm sure if me or you
[1:43:34] were in an auditorium and we saw a
[1:43:36] bat-like figure leave somebody's body
[1:43:39] we wouldn't just stand there like oh
[1:43:40] that's interesting
[1:43:43] that's right
[1:43:44] it would have an effect on you
[1:43:48] you see
[1:43:50] that is the supernatural unseen realm
[1:43:55] just like the physical unseen realm that
[1:43:58] you need
[1:43:59] something beyond your own sight
[1:44:00] something beyond your own feeling your
[1:44:02] own touch your own
[1:44:04] physical senses to be able to look at
[1:44:07] and identify
[1:44:09] so is it in the spiritual realm
[1:44:11] as it's passing through here nonstop
[1:44:15] you know the devil was the first person
[1:44:17] in church here today
[1:44:20] he comes to every function
[1:44:22] where the sons of god gather
[1:44:24] and he's one of the earliest ones there
[1:44:27] he'll beat all of us
[1:44:28] he's the first one in the door
[1:44:31] and it's easy for him because then you
[1:44:32] have to wait for any of us to unlock it
[1:44:34] for him he just
[1:44:35] he's here he's waiting
[1:44:39] he is
[1:44:40] one of the most on time people to any
[1:44:42] religious service
[1:44:45] and i know this because in the book of
[1:44:46] job
[1:44:47] it talks about and the sons of god
[1:44:50] gathered together
[1:44:52] before the throne
[1:44:54] and satan was there also
[1:44:58] he showed up yes
[1:45:00] you'd be like he got cast out of heaven
[1:45:02] what was he doing yeah before the throne
[1:45:05] of god
[1:45:08] is there to figure see what can i pick
[1:45:10] out of this
[1:45:12] what am i missing as i'm running the
[1:45:14] lord said what you've been doing he's
[1:45:15] like going to and fro throughout the
[1:45:16] earth
[1:45:18] so it's a lot of work down there because
[1:45:19] there's a lot of people
[1:45:21] and to touch all of them and make sure
[1:45:23] i'm keeping them all busy i gotta keep
[1:45:25] keep traveling
[1:45:27] keep traveling so up here to see if
[1:45:29] anyone up here will identify somebody
[1:45:32] for me that i am just missing altogether
[1:45:34] and god's like
[1:45:35] got one for you
[1:45:37] have you ever noticed my servant job
[1:45:41] saying he's like
[1:45:42] i notice him all the time the hedge of
[1:45:44] protection you got around him
[1:45:47] i can't even see what he's i can't see
[1:45:48] what he's thinking what he's doing i
[1:45:51] don't know what his next move is
[1:45:53] and so i can't
[1:45:55] i can't second-guess him and get ahead
[1:45:56] of him he's always one step ahead of me
[1:46:00] and it's all your fault
[1:46:02] and god's like yeah you know
[1:46:05] i like him
[1:46:06] he's kind of great
[1:46:08] and it was like well he's only great
[1:46:09] because
[1:46:10] of that hedge of protection you let me
[1:46:12] add him
[1:46:13] you'll see how ungreat he is
[1:46:16] that's what he was waiting for
[1:46:18] that's what he's that's why he shows up
[1:46:20] here every service
[1:46:21] and god's like
[1:46:23] hey
[1:46:24] hey buddy what you doing here
[1:46:27] he's like
[1:46:28] well
[1:46:29] i'm just looking to see if there's
[1:46:30] somebody i'm missing
[1:46:33] somebody that you're once again got a
[1:46:34] hedge of protection around that you're
[1:46:36] not letting me see into their lives and
[1:46:39] your plan for their life
[1:46:40] and they keep one step ahead of me so
[1:46:42] i'm hoping that if i get here to church
[1:46:44] and they let their guard down and maybe
[1:46:46] i'll hear something or see something
[1:46:49] that i can work with
[1:46:51] because whenever they're out there man
[1:46:54] they are on fire
[1:46:57] they are always trying to toe the line
[1:47:00] and say the right thing to the right
[1:47:01] people
[1:47:02] and
[1:47:03] and all those things but i figure church
[1:47:06] if they're going to let down their guard
[1:47:07] anywhere or get upset with someone it's
[1:47:09] probably going to be at church because
[1:47:11] they expect everyone else to be better
[1:47:12] here
[1:47:14] so now they're going to get annoyed
[1:47:15] because that brother knows better
[1:47:17] so if i can get in on that then that'll
[1:47:19] be something i can work with but he
[1:47:21] shows up
[1:47:22] he shows up he's it's very real
[1:47:26] now don't get scared though
[1:47:29] do what's even more real
[1:47:31] the power of god
[1:47:33] in this building
[1:47:35] you see because brother man i made a
[1:47:37] statement
[1:47:38] and i really am closing
[1:47:40] here
[1:47:42] 9 15 take five more minutes and we'll
[1:47:45] close
[1:47:46] um but
[1:47:48] billy random said someone with the wrong
[1:47:49] spirit
[1:47:51] sitting in the pews
[1:47:53] can influence
[1:47:55] five
[1:47:57] rows forward
[1:47:58] five rows back from where they're at
[1:48:01] think about that
[1:48:05] you come in with the wrong attitude
[1:48:09] without the spirit of worship
[1:48:11] you just all in a huff
[1:48:13] you don't like you don't like what the
[1:48:15] you don't like the preacher that's going
[1:48:16] to be preaching that day you don't like
[1:48:18] what the song leader is doing you didn't
[1:48:20] like how the deacon treated you as you
[1:48:21] came through the door
[1:48:23] fact is you're kind of upset with your
[1:48:24] wife
[1:48:25] from earlier that morning
[1:48:27] because of what she did and you've been
[1:48:29] in a huff since then because she's also
[1:48:32] supposed to be a good christian woman
[1:48:34] and she should be treating you a whole
[1:48:35] lot better
[1:48:40] and you get here with that attitude on
[1:48:42] you you thought influencing
[1:48:44] the wrong spear you thought i was
[1:48:46] talking about you know the drunk guy who
[1:48:47] comes in here and sits down nah he he's
[1:48:50] not even a problem
[1:48:51] the deacons catch him they give him a
[1:48:53] spot in the back they keep an eye on him
[1:48:56] we're not worried about him
[1:48:58] not at all we're worried about us
[1:49:02] coming in
[1:49:03] sitting here at the wrong attitude
[1:49:07] which is invite giving the devil a place
[1:49:09] in your life right then
[1:49:13] to then influence the rest of the
[1:49:14] service for everybody else
[1:49:19] but don't worry don't get scared about
[1:49:20] that either
[1:49:21] okay
[1:49:23] and this is why
[1:49:30] colossians 1
[1:49:33] and we're going to just going to read
[1:49:36] from verse 12
[1:49:38] through
[1:49:40] 16. or or so here i'm just going to get
[1:49:44] started and i'm going to move through it
[1:49:45] fast giving thanks unto the father which
[1:49:47] has have made us meet to be partakers of
[1:49:50] the inheritance of the saints in light
[1:49:53] keep that in mind you're of the saints
[1:49:55] in light that's going to be important
[1:49:57] who had delivered us from the power of
[1:50:00] darkness
[1:50:01] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:50:04] of his dear son
[1:50:06] now these are all present tense things
[1:50:10] none of this is futuristic
[1:50:14] so apply it today
[1:50:16] apply it right now
[1:50:18] apply it to that attitude
[1:50:20] that's right amen
[1:50:22] all these things apply
[1:50:26] who had delivered us from the power of
[1:50:28] darkness and had translated us into the
[1:50:30] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[1:50:32] redemption through his blood even the
[1:50:34] forgiveness of sins
[1:50:36] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:50:41] the firstborn of every creature for by
[1:50:44] him were all things created that are in
[1:50:46] heaven that are in earth visible and
[1:50:49] invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:50:51] dominions or principalities or powers
[1:50:55] all things will be created by him and
[1:50:58] for him
[1:50:59] all a-l-l
[1:51:04] all principalities all spirits
[1:51:07] all
[1:51:08] not just good ones
[1:51:12] but the bad ones
[1:51:14] and the devil himself
[1:51:18] god created for his own purpose
[1:51:20] and for his own good
[1:51:25] keep that in mind
[1:51:27] and he is before all things and by him
[1:51:29] all things consist
[1:51:31] and he is the head of the body
[1:51:33] the church who is the beginning and the
[1:51:34] firstborn from the dead then all things
[1:51:37] he
[1:51:38] might have preeminence
[1:51:41] that's what it's all about if you want
[1:51:43] to be able to apply all these other
[1:51:45] things
[1:51:46] then you have to apply the part where he
[1:51:49] must
[1:51:50] have preeminence
[1:51:54] that's wife he has preeminence
[1:51:58] the holy spirit
[1:52:00] christ himself in your life
[1:52:04] all these other things fall into place
[1:52:08] now
[1:52:13] i'm going to read you one last quote
[1:52:16] remember
[1:52:18] we are
[1:52:19] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:52:21] saints in light
[1:52:24] okay
[1:52:25] we already have seen where this young
[1:52:27] man troubled by an evil spirit had a
[1:52:30] physical manifestation
[1:52:32] right
[1:52:33] that if you're you had the right eyes to
[1:52:36] see it
[1:52:38] and the ability to feel it
[1:52:40] it was very
[1:52:42] real prophet described it
[1:52:45] not once but many times you describe
[1:52:47] these situations
[1:52:49] very real
[1:52:51] okay
[1:52:52] and i just told you how
[1:52:53] coming in with that wrong attitude that
[1:52:55] wrong spirit allowing it influence can
[1:52:57] influence i mean here if you sit in the
[1:53:00] middle of the church
[1:53:01] five rows forward and five rows back you
[1:53:02] got the whole place covered
[1:53:06] you even have part of the foyer covered
[1:53:07] maybe the bathroom
[1:53:10] but
[1:53:11] but here's the thing is i don't want to
[1:53:12] focus on that
[1:53:14] i want to focus here now
[1:53:16] okay
[1:53:17] i've shown you what the problem is
[1:53:20] now here's the resolution
[1:53:22] an expectation now if you'll notice the
[1:53:24] patient he's talking about he's once
[1:53:25] again in a prayer line
[1:53:27] just the spirit of the lord is here
[1:53:30] and the patient i don't know her
[1:53:32] she's from new york but a real strange
[1:53:35] feeling
[1:53:36] watch them
[1:53:37] and when they get about eight or ten
[1:53:39] feet you'll see the expression come up
[1:53:41] on her face
[1:53:42] now the lady i don't know her
[1:53:44] but you have an odd feeling don't you
[1:53:46] lady a very strange very odd
[1:53:49] now that the audience might know
[1:53:51] would you step a little closer to that
[1:53:53] mic
[1:53:54] isn't that the truth sister answers it's
[1:53:56] the truth
[1:53:58] a very odd strange feeling it's sacred
[1:54:00] what is it the light you see in the
[1:54:03] picture
[1:54:05] is now here at the platform
[1:54:09] the you might not be it might come clear
[1:54:12] you might see it but he's here
[1:54:15] i know it's here
[1:54:17] everything seems
[1:54:18] like to be like getting milky around
[1:54:21] over the building
[1:54:23] you see the prophet's vision the same
[1:54:24] one that saw that devil
[1:54:27] could see that light
[1:54:29] coming in
[1:54:30] standing there next to him
[1:54:32] manifesting itself
[1:54:34] that he could see the spirit of god
[1:54:36] out of the people and what he describes
[1:54:39] as a milky condition
[1:54:41] getting so thick
[1:54:43] when something's milky like if you ever
[1:54:44] drive through a milky fog
[1:54:47] you can barely see through it it's so
[1:54:49] thick
[1:54:50] it obscures your vision
[1:54:53] this is what happened in solomon's
[1:54:54] temple
[1:54:56] and the same spirit of god came down
[1:54:59] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:55:02] and forever he's still the same today
[1:55:05] okay
[1:55:07] and that i know it's here you see the
[1:55:09] anointing is coming on now
[1:55:12] now i read this
[1:55:17] because we've seen we've identified the
[1:55:19] devil
[1:55:20] and his power
[1:55:22] or the little power he has that's given
[1:55:24] to him
[1:55:26] but now we want to identify the power
[1:55:29] that is with
[1:55:30] us
[1:55:32] because if we are this of in we have an
[1:55:35] inheritance of the saints in light
[1:55:38] it has to be that same light that led
[1:55:40] the children of israel through the
[1:55:42] wilderness
[1:55:43] it's got to be that same light that came
[1:55:45] down and spoke to paul
[1:55:48] and struck him off his horse
[1:55:50] and said paul saul saul why should thou
[1:55:53] persecute me
[1:55:55] it's got to be that same light that was
[1:55:57] here in the meetings
[1:55:59] of a brother branham
[1:56:01] that come swirling into the room
[1:56:04] and stand beside him
[1:56:06] it's that same light
[1:56:09] that created that milky presence over
[1:56:10] the people
[1:56:14] yet it wasn't just for him
[1:56:17] it wasn't just attached to an individual
[1:56:20] that same light
[1:56:22] that same presence
[1:56:24] and i go as far as to say
[1:56:27] that if you could have looked at the
[1:56:29] beginning of the service when you felt
[1:56:31] that presence come down
[1:56:33] if god would have given you that ability
[1:56:34] to see
[1:56:35] you would have seen that same milky
[1:56:37] presence all throughout this
[1:56:40] building it's the same
[1:56:43] you see people saints it's the same
[1:56:47] it's an unseen world that by which we're
[1:56:49] being affected by
[1:56:52] but we do not have to live in fear
[1:56:55] of the unseen world that is controlled
[1:56:58] by the devil
[1:56:59] anymore the disciples had to fear the
[1:57:03] principalities and powers that the devil
[1:57:05] was in control of at the time of christ
[1:57:09] because when the devil took him up on a
[1:57:11] high mountain and said look at the
[1:57:12] nations of the world they're all mine
[1:57:15] christ said yeah they're yours
[1:57:20] and yet in that
[1:57:21] knowing and admitting to the devil these
[1:57:23] nations are yours to do it as you wish
[1:57:27] he told his disciples
[1:57:28] don't worry when you go before the
[1:57:31] leaders of these nations that the devil
[1:57:33] is in control of
[1:57:36] i'll give you the right thing to say
[1:57:39] and he and they
[1:57:41] have never and will never be in control
[1:57:45] if you'll just stay surrendered to me
[1:57:49] saints that's where we're at we've
[1:57:52] entered into that spiritual realm
[1:57:55] where we're not fighting
[1:57:58] a physical foe
[1:58:04] but all we're doing is surrendering
[1:58:07] as you surrender
[1:58:09] and god steps in and takes control
[1:58:14] he'll do your fighting for you
[1:58:16] he'll use your mouth just like he used
[1:58:17] the prophet just like he uses every
[1:58:19] minister behind this pulpit
[1:58:21] just like he uses the song leader to
[1:58:23] lead in in worship
[1:58:26] when the time comes and he wants to use
[1:58:28] you to speak to somebody
[1:58:31] when the time comes and he wants to use
[1:58:32] you to perform an action
[1:58:35] you'll open your mouth and his words
[1:58:38] will pour out
[1:58:40] that's why so many times when branham
[1:58:42] would say i have to go back
[1:58:45] and listen to the tape
[1:58:47] to know what i said
[1:58:52] so is it with me and you
[1:58:54] this is not a thing that it was only for
[1:58:56] a prophet
[1:58:58] for god to come in and take control of
[1:59:00] our lives
[1:59:02] don't hesitate
[1:59:05] because you're like well i got to think
[1:59:07] about this do i have the right it was it
[1:59:09] was that in peter was that in mark what
[1:59:11] what was the reference no no no
[1:59:14] if you try and do that you're going to
[1:59:15] trip all over yourself
[1:59:17] just
[1:59:18] step right into it just like all them
[1:59:20] uneducated disciples did
[1:59:24] and you know what the people said when
[1:59:26] they spoke
[1:59:28] they said we know
[1:59:30] that they were uneducated and unlearned
[1:59:33] but from the way they spoke
[1:59:36] we knew
[1:59:37] they had been with jesus
[1:59:39] and that was
[1:59:41] the example of our prophet today
[1:59:45] is many a people many a ministries many
[1:59:48] a denominational minister
[1:59:50] said we do not agree
[1:59:54] with your teachings of the scripture
[1:59:58] but we have never met someone
[2:00:01] that so expressed
[2:00:03] the life of christ and the love of god
[2:00:08] you know why because he just surrendered
[2:00:11] he just surrendered
[2:00:12] and he knew way more than me and you
[2:00:15] musicians if you come because i'll just
[2:00:16] keep going
[2:00:18] but he knew way more than me and you
[2:00:21] there's testimony
[2:00:24] where brothers would come up to him and
[2:00:26] and give him a hug and say brother
[2:00:27] branham i love you
[2:00:28] he said i sure wish you wouldn't say
[2:00:30] that
[2:00:34] and hear why he said i wish he wouldn't
[2:00:36] say that
[2:00:38] it goes because he didn't love him back
[2:00:41] because he knew
[2:00:43] in their heart
[2:00:45] they didn't love him
[2:00:47] it was as scripture says it was vain
[2:00:49] words
[2:00:51] with your words you don't you do dust
[2:00:53] out worship me
[2:00:54] but your heart is far from me
[2:00:57] and that spirit of christ just
[2:00:59] in him said oh i wish you wouldn't say
[2:01:02] that and say that those lies because
[2:01:05] you're going to need forgiveness for
[2:01:07] that i love you don't do that
[2:01:12] all he wanted
[2:01:13] was for them to see the love of god
[2:01:16] and accept the truth
[2:01:19] that's it
[2:01:20] he didn't wish him no harm he didn't
[2:01:21] wish them to a life in hell
[2:01:26] he said if you could just see what i see
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:30] he said
[2:01:33] i want all of you to make it he said if
[2:01:35] you'd be in there and seen what i've
[2:01:37] seen you'd know
[2:01:38] if if nothing else just don't miss it
[2:01:42] just don't miss it
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:47] don't don't settle in on all your petty
[2:01:50] squabbles and
[2:01:51] and arguments over or
[2:01:54] little things that don't matter
[2:01:58] he said just enter into the love of god
[2:02:01] love one another and let that presence
[2:02:04] take full control
[2:02:08] [Music]
