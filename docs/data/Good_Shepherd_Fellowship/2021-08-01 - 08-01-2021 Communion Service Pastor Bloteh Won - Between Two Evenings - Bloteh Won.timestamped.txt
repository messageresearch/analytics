[10:40] and address something about the
[10:42] scripture
[10:43] deuteronomy chapter 16 let's read from
[10:46] verse
[10:47] 1. observe the man of ivy
[10:52] and keep the passover unto the lord thy
[10:56] god
[10:57] for in the mount of abba the lord thy
[11:00] god brought thee
[11:01] forth out of egypt by night
[11:06] thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[11:09] the passover unto the lord thy god of
[11:12] the floods and of and the herb
[11:15] in the place which the lord shall choose
[11:18] to place
[11:19] his name there thou shalt eat no
[11:22] unleavened bread with a
[11:24] seven days shadow
[11:28] eat on living bread there with even
[11:32] the bread of affliction for thou
[11:35] cameth fought out of the land of egypt
[11:37] in haste
[11:40] thou came effort out of the land of
[11:42] egypt in haste
[11:44] just like we have said before the
[11:46] communion must be done
[11:47] in haste praise the lord
[11:51] after we have gone through all the
[11:53] praying you know when we come to the
[11:55] table
[11:56] we must be able to
[12:00] okay let's go right ahead that came
[12:03] for out of the land of egypt in his that
[12:06] that thou may i remember
[12:10] the day when thou came
[12:13] fought out of the land of egypt all the
[12:16] days of their life
[12:18] there and there shall be no living
[12:22] breath seen with thee
[12:23] in all that cost seven days neither
[12:28] shall they shall be anything of the
[12:31] flesh
[12:32] which thou sacrifice the first day
[12:36] at evening remain all the night
[12:40] until the morning so when the sacrifice
[12:43] is done
[12:44] that evening you know everything should
[12:46] be done nothing should be kept in the
[12:48] morning
[12:49] that thou may have now sacrificed the
[12:51] passover
[12:53] within any of the gates which
[12:56] the lord thy god giveth thee but at the
[12:59] place which
[13:01] the lord thy god shall choose
[13:04] to place his name in
[13:07] there shall thou sacrifice the passover
[13:11] at even at the going down
[13:15] of the sun at the season
[13:19] that thou came effort out of egypt let's
[13:22] pray together heavenly father
[13:24] we take this portion of your word and we
[13:26] just want to ask that you bless it
[13:29] as we uh uh talk about you tonight you
[13:32] are our sacrifice
[13:34] father god and we we have been taught by
[13:37] your word
[13:38] that the worshiper was never on our
[13:40] examination
[13:42] so god will look in your word tonight
[13:44] father
[13:45] is before us lord we want to examine it
[13:48] that there is no
[13:49] fault in your word as we approach your
[13:51] promise tonight
[13:52] we love you in jesus name we pray amen
[13:56] the lord bless you you may have your
[13:57] seed just before we go to the table of
[14:00] the lord tonight i want to take a little
[14:02] talk here
[14:04] like i said just to be able to address
[14:06] uh a scriptural principle
[14:09] uh i entitled between two evenings
[14:14] between two evenings
[14:19] praise the lord
[14:28] between two evenings now that
[14:31] the thought of this of this principle
[14:35] is the hour of communion uh
[14:39] paul when we read the scripture there in
[14:41] uh in corinthians
[14:43] paul says that that same evening
[14:46] the lord jesus took bread and wine and
[14:49] he blessed it
[14:50] now so the thought of eveling has
[14:53] always been conflicting around the
[14:55] church
[14:57] because of the jewish time
[15:00] and the gentile time so it has
[15:03] always been conflicting i've seen many
[15:06] brothers that have
[15:07] you know uh that uh uh
[15:10] you know you know sometimes they visit
[15:13] uh
[15:13] the country uh over here in the u.s and
[15:17] and it it kind of uh stumbled them
[15:21] when communion is half around this time
[15:24] you know because uh uh
[15:27] the thought of evening is is when uh
[15:31] the dark is about to fall
[15:34] you know that's how they think about it
[15:37] but
[15:38] i want us to look in the scripture
[15:39] tonight and a little bit in the message
[15:42] and then we would
[15:42] we was for us to be able to realize that
[15:46] the biblical evening uh
[15:49] which is the jewish evening evening when
[15:52] the passover was
[15:53] took place it's completely different
[15:55] from the kind of
[15:56] eviling that we think about
[16:00] because it it it is said and taught
[16:03] you know that night you know so when we
[16:06] read back in exeter and it's thought
[16:08] about that night
[16:09] so uh uh you know most people stumble
[16:12] that communion should be taken late in
[16:15] the evening anything
[16:16] after six o'clock when that when when
[16:18] the
[16:19] you know when their shadows that the the
[16:22] evening the night is falling in
[16:24] but actually i just want us to look at
[16:27] just some few things and i'll read a
[16:28] quote here from god choosing place
[16:30] of worship and then we go right into the
[16:33] communion
[16:34] so uh and and
[16:37] and actually as i was i was looking
[16:40] there in god choosing place of washi
[16:42] that was what i saw brother brandon read
[16:43] the scripture
[16:44] uh to preach that message and and and if
[16:48] you even
[16:49] look in that scripture let's go back
[16:51] there again
[16:52] and then we will i want us to grab the
[16:54] principle there and then we will travel
[16:57] a little bit
[17:00] wreck that in verse 6
[17:03] verse 16 uh chapter 16 verse
[17:06] 6.
[17:14] chapter 16 verse 6 but other place which
[17:16] the law that god
[17:18] shall choose to place his name
[17:22] in there shall thou sacrifice the past
[17:26] over at even
[17:29] which means even
[17:33] at the going down of
[17:37] the sun at the season
[17:41] that thou came it out came forth out of
[17:45] egypt
[17:46] now so we will see that
[17:50] the jews have two evenings
[17:54] they have an early evening and they have
[17:56] a late evening
[17:59] and the sacrifice was supposed to be
[18:01] between the two evenings
[18:06] praise the lord now
[18:09] we will look at a little bit of of of uh
[18:12] of of the jewish time
[18:16] not very good with these things but uh
[18:20] i i promise you i will improve
[18:24] amen as soon as the lord can start
[18:27] helping me i will do better
[18:32] praise god
[18:40] praise the lord thank you for being
[18:44] understanding
[18:47] now let's let's let's do something here
[18:50] uh
[18:50] sorry i have my little my little note
[18:53] here
[18:54] for the evening
[18:57] let's look at these few scriptures let's
[19:00] look at saint john chapter 11
[19:02] verse 9. sin john chapter 11 verse 9.
[19:18] it's in john chapter 11 verse 9
[19:23] jesus right there with meredith martyr
[19:28] expecting philosopher to come forth out
[19:30] of the grave
[19:31] verse 9 jesus answered are there not
[19:35] 12 owls in the day
[19:40] if any man walk in the day
[19:43] he stumbled at net because
[19:46] he seared the light
[19:50] of the world so the principle here
[19:53] is that there are 12 hours in the day
[19:56] and there are 12
[19:57] hours in the night so
[20:00] the the jewish day the first hour begins
[20:05] uh uh from from from the break of day
[20:08] when the daylight cometh
[20:12] so the the the 12 hours of the day
[20:15] the first hour will be from 6 to 7.
[20:21] so 12 hours in the day
[20:25] uh will be from six in the morning
[20:28] to six in the evening
[20:32] are we together and then right after six
[20:35] in the evening the the the night time
[20:38] starts are we together
[20:43] praise the lord so jesus said on that
[20:46] i then that 12 hours in the day so we
[20:50] want to keep that principle
[20:52] now let's look at the fulfillment
[20:56] of the passover
[20:59] which is the killing of the lamb let's
[21:02] look at
[21:03] the death of jesus matthew chapter 27
[21:09] matthew chapter 27.
[21:20] matthew chapter 27
[21:25] a lot of things that have gone over with
[21:29] with church traditions and
[21:33] as we walk in the light with the message
[21:35] of the owl
[21:37] we it is not
[21:41] in the sense of us trying to
[21:45] you know uh change things but we want to
[21:48] come to a better understanding
[21:51] it's it's our that's that's what the
[21:53] message of the hour is is to bring us to
[21:55] a better understanding
[21:57] because when we when we have a better
[21:58] understanding of what we are doing
[22:01] and make ours ourselves our our service
[22:03] our sacrifice
[22:05] acceptable to the lord we're just doing
[22:07] it because
[22:08] that's how we were taught or because
[22:10] everybody do it that way it's better to
[22:12] have a better understanding and there is
[22:14] no way you can get it from
[22:15] in the word of god so let's look at this
[22:18] together
[22:19] matthew 27 verse 45
[22:24] matthew 27 verse 45.
[22:29] the scripture was his year now from the
[22:32] sixth hour
[22:34] there was darkness over
[22:38] all the lane until
[22:42] the ninth hour now if you take that
[22:46] into our hour uh one o'clock to six
[22:50] o'clock
[22:51] uh i mean from from six to nine
[22:54] it's already our evening hour so the
[22:57] darkness will not be very significant
[23:00] for darkness to come because that's the
[23:02] time we expect for darkness to come
[23:06] okay that is in our our timepiece
[23:09] but over in the jewish timepiece
[23:13] the the sixth hour of the day is 3 p.m
[23:20] so from 3 p.m to 6 p.m
[23:24] the the the earth was completely dark
[23:27] so that that darkness was very
[23:30] significant
[23:34] are we together
[23:37] so in uh in
[23:40] in uh in the jewish time the first
[23:44] evening begins from the sixth hour of
[23:47] the day
[23:52] from the sixth hour of the day
[23:56] uh to the ninth hour of the day that's
[23:59] when the first evening begins
[24:02] so the first evening begins from 3 p.m
[24:05] to 6 p.m
[24:08] then the second evening begins from 6
[24:11] p.m
[24:12] to 9 00 p.m
[24:15] are we together so that's that's the
[24:19] that's that's the two evening uh uh uh
[24:22] uh in in the jewish sense because when
[24:25] you
[24:26] read when you actually read in
[24:29] exodus chapter 2 verse 6 where he says
[24:33] the passover must be sacrificed that
[24:35] evening
[24:37] in the in the hebrew it says that it
[24:40] must be sacrificed between the two
[24:44] evenings
[24:46] what what proved that is what we read in
[24:49] in in deuteronomy chapter 16.
[24:53] it talks about the evening and it also
[24:55] talks about the going down of the sun
[25:00] praise the lord oh you never saw that
[25:03] let's go back there again deuteronomy
[25:05] chapter 16.
[25:16] i remember years back a good friend of
[25:18] mine
[25:19] we we got on this subject but at the
[25:21] time i
[25:22] did not i i i did not
[25:26] fully grab the subject you know the
[25:29] reality now steady on it
[25:31] but we we had that was many years back
[25:33] we had a talk on it
[25:35] and and and he brought the subject of
[25:39] the two evenings
[25:41] but the way that he brought it was it
[25:44] have to be
[25:45] from our 6 p.m to to 12 noon
[25:49] i mean 12 midnight
[25:53] so we at the time we were we were we
[25:56] were struggling to be able to establish
[25:58] the two
[25:58] evenings from from 6 pm to 12 but when
[26:02] you hit 12 ui
[26:04] at morning that's not an evening
[26:12] praise the lord so i i
[26:16] i the the subject kind of just dropped
[26:19] somewhere down in my subconscious
[26:21] and that you know i've been i've just
[26:22] been reading i made i
[26:24] made a lot of research just trying to
[26:26] look into the message and see what
[26:28] brother branham said
[26:29] and uh and also looking through the
[26:31] scripture
[26:32] but just as we were we were thinking
[26:34] about praying about this
[26:36] convenience service then the talk the
[26:39] the inspiration just came to me and i
[26:41] said well okay let me look closely maybe
[26:42] the law might help me
[26:44] okay let's read this again back there in
[26:46] verse six
[26:47] of deuteronomy 16 but at the place
[26:52] which the lord thy god shall choose
[26:55] to place his name in that there thou
[26:58] shalt sacrifice the passover at
[27:02] even at
[27:05] the going down of the sun
[27:09] right there it shows the two evening
[27:12] one is the first evening the second
[27:15] evening
[27:16] is the going down of the sun
[27:21] praise the lord now and
[27:25] ask chapter three
[27:29] as chapter three
[27:40] let's go quickly
[27:56] that's chapter three
[28:02] chapter 3 verse 1 now peter and john
[28:05] went up
[28:07] together into the temple
[28:10] at the hour of prayer being the ninth
[28:14] hour
[28:14] that was the jewish evening
[28:18] sacrifice evening time of prayer
[28:22] it was about the 9th hour
[28:25] as chapter 10.
[28:35] let me try to speed it a little bit
[28:41] as chapter 10.
[28:47] this is colina's experience
[28:50] verse 3 he saw a vision
[28:54] evidently about the ninth hour of the
[28:57] day
[28:58] an angel of god coming coming in
[29:02] to him and saying unto him kalinas let's
[29:05] drop down to
[29:06] verse 30.
[29:22] colin is testifying here he says
[29:27] said four days ago
[29:30] i was fasting until
[29:33] this hour and at the ninth hour
[29:40] i prayed in my house
[29:46] [Music]
[29:48] and behold a man's stool before me
[29:51] in in a bright cloth
[29:55] now so if if you take
[29:58] the jewish sabbath the rest you take the
[30:02] jewish sabbath
[30:04] and and they were not to do anything
[30:07] from the rising of the sun to the going
[30:09] down so it was about from
[30:11] six six in the morning to six in the
[30:14] evening
[30:15] that will be from the first hour of the
[30:17] day to the ninth hour
[30:24] are we together okay
[30:28] and uh so so as we as we look at
[30:32] as we look at the the the the
[30:36] subject together uh is not
[30:39] is is not in a place of uh trying to
[30:43] to start any kind of a new doctrine just
[30:46] like i said
[30:47] it is only to be able to address the
[30:49] time
[30:51] because for many of us that
[30:54] uh look at the evening time from the
[30:57] scripture
[30:57] when you're reading the bible and and
[31:00] paul says
[31:01] and that evening you know he took bread
[31:05] and you look at the time we are doing
[31:07] communion
[31:08] sometimes a conflict people mind i've
[31:11] received
[31:12] people asking me that question you know
[31:15] uh
[31:15] uh you know and even there was a brother
[31:18] sometime that visited with us
[31:20] and he he said the same thing to me why
[31:22] are you people taking communion early
[31:26] you know he says uh why are you taking
[31:30] communion supposed to be in the evening
[31:32] time
[31:33] you know and uh so
[31:36] if you understand that uh
[31:40] uh as we we
[31:43] we are looking back just like i said you
[31:45] know for the gentile is
[31:46] always a type in shadow we look back to
[31:49] what god they
[31:50] there for the jews is a pattern you know
[31:53] but for the gentiles it starts in shadow
[31:55] we have to look back there
[31:57] so when you look back over to the jewish
[31:59] time you will realize
[32:00] that you know uh if if we
[32:04] have our communion this time of the day
[32:07] we are right in scripture because
[32:10] it is between two evenings
[32:14] let's read this quote it's all from one
[32:18] message
[32:19] and
[32:23] god only provided place of worship
[32:30] again i was over for the for the uh
[32:34] december 31st meeting somewhere and we
[32:37] were to have conveniently at nighting
[32:40] and i mean it was a huge group of people
[32:42] i mean
[32:43] there was a very big church and i was
[32:47] i just got so troubled because we were
[32:50] in the late hour of the night
[32:53] you know taking communion doing full
[32:55] washing
[32:56] and all of that and you know
[33:00] but the thing about it did is that
[33:03] in as much as we are keeping the
[33:06] ordinance
[33:07] you know i just i just kind of uh settle
[33:11] my
[33:11] thought with that you know the people
[33:14] are keeping jesus says as as much as you
[33:17] do this in remembrance of men
[33:18] they are keeping the ordinance so i then
[33:21] i wanted to be radical
[33:23] in my spirit before i start creating
[33:26] doubt
[33:27] right but i was actually troubled
[33:30] because looking at a time that we
[33:32] started
[33:33] having the convenience service about
[33:35] about 10 p.m in the night
[33:36] and i'm and i'm talking about a
[33:38] congregation of over almost about three
[33:40] to 500 people
[33:47] you know but that is
[33:50] is uh is uh you know is is uh is the
[33:54] is the level of understanding because
[33:57] we look to the evenings to be when the
[34:00] the evening shadows are falling when
[34:02] when night is coming
[34:04] but you have to realize that even the
[34:07] darkness that was in
[34:08] egypt was not the night darkness
[34:12] it was a darkness that god put on the
[34:14] land
[34:18] just like the darkness that came when
[34:20] jesus gave up the ghost it was not the
[34:23] eve
[34:23] it was not the night darkness it was it
[34:26] was darkness that came
[34:27] right at a time when it was supposed to
[34:30] be daylight like this
[34:33] so looking for darkness for communion
[34:39] i wonder if we're not looking for
[34:41] judgment
[34:43] because darkness at that time was
[34:45] judgment to egypt
[34:51] are we together now listen to brother
[34:53] branham here
[34:56] god provided a place in worship now
[34:58] christ
[34:59] was tested the lamb
[35:03] first from from the mother
[35:06] earwy married the virgin and was
[35:10] tested by what satan against the word
[35:15] when he hit eve she fell hit
[35:18] moses he failed but when
[35:21] he flew up against christ and tried to
[35:25] cut the scriptures to him wrong
[35:29] he found out that
[35:32] that wasn't moses
[35:35] amen and sure he will find that also
[35:38] that this bride is naive
[35:41] amen see
[35:44] he was tested he he turned around and
[35:48] said
[35:49] if thou be the son of god now
[35:53] they tell me you perform miracle the
[35:56] the and they tell me that
[35:59] the messiah to do that now
[36:03] if it is so you are hungry
[36:04] [Music]
[36:06] he said you having it turned these
[36:09] bread or these stones into bread and eat
[36:12] he said it is written men shall not live
[36:14] by bread alone
[36:17] your creed and so far
[36:21] but by what every word
[36:26] a part of the word we will say no every
[36:29] word that proceeds
[36:30] out of the mouth of god
[36:33] that's what men live by see
[36:37] the lamb was tested see
[36:40] if this anything he had fallen he says
[36:44] here
[36:45] he was tested to see where
[36:48] he was standing see tested in every
[36:51] manner
[36:52] tested like we are tested
[36:55] but there was no giving in
[36:58] and this bride will not give in amen
[37:02] there was no giving to him at all
[37:05] no sir that was the son of god
[37:10] watching now and the lamb was tested
[37:13] and was kept up for 14 days
[37:18] that that was two
[37:21] sabbath now
[37:24] there is there is there is uh there is
[37:26] uh there is a place here
[37:29] of two sabbath and that is the reason
[37:32] why
[37:33] the the calculation of the of the
[37:36] passover
[37:38] that that was picked up by the roman
[37:40] church even though
[37:42] they were uh they were they were
[37:44] introducing
[37:45] their their moon god worship
[37:50] the whole the whole easter comes from
[37:52] there from that worship
[37:54] uh of the moon god and and and
[37:57] and because what happened there is that
[37:59] uh
[38:00] uh at that time
[38:04] uh the rabbits are very filtered
[38:08] because roberts was represented in the
[38:10] roman kingdom
[38:11] for fatality that's where comes
[38:15] the bunny rabbit during easter
[38:19] and the easter eggs rabbit on lake edge
[38:24] i don't know how we got the two in
[38:25] easter
[38:28] but it all comes from a roman background
[38:31] now so what
[38:32] happened here is that the the the the
[38:36] calculation of the day
[38:38] because there were two sabbaths
[38:42] there were two sabbaths from i think i
[38:45] went over that one time here
[38:47] uh uh uh from the time that jesus
[38:51] uh you know was was arrested uh
[38:54] and all from the time that he was
[38:56] pirated hosanna hosanna blessed is he
[38:58] that coming in the name of the lord
[39:00] from that time to to the time he went
[39:04] over to his uh crucification there were
[39:07] two sabbath
[39:08] another time we will look at that i
[39:09] don't have time for us to go through all
[39:11] the scripture but it's right
[39:12] in the scripture it was a time in the
[39:15] jewish festival where
[39:17] a sabbath come in the middle of the week
[39:22] so because some of they
[39:27] was generally known to be saturday
[39:31] that's the reason why we came out with a
[39:33] good friday tradition
[39:38] and that's why we always get the
[39:41] conflict
[39:42] of calculating a complete three days and
[39:45] three nights
[39:47] because you will not get a complete
[39:49] calculation
[39:50] of three days and three nights if jesus
[39:53] was crucified
[39:54] friday night
[39:57] you cannot be able to get a complete
[40:00] calculation of three days
[40:01] and three nights and jesus himself said
[40:04] as jonah
[40:05] lied in the world of the belly three
[40:07] days and three nights
[40:08] saw the son of man will lie in the heart
[40:11] of the earth
[40:14] are we together okay let's read here
[40:22] and the lamb was and the lamb was tested
[40:26] and was kept up for 14 days that
[40:31] that was two sabbath or
[40:34] two ages one
[40:37] for the jews which they offer the lamb
[40:41] in type
[40:42] one for the gentiles who has
[40:46] the real lamb
[40:49] and all of them
[40:52] was made perfect by believing this line
[40:56] who come but he
[40:59] was tempted 14 days or examining 14 days
[41:04] he was the word and because he was the
[41:07] word they found no fault in him
[41:10] now see 14 days it was it was tested
[41:14] that was
[41:15] christ and notice then he
[41:18] was killed in the evening time
[41:24] should be killed the lamb was christ
[41:27] died
[41:27] in the evening time the afternoon
[41:33] so what happened here is that brother
[41:35] branham
[41:36] is is is trying to place us in the
[41:39] scripture
[41:40] but yet he's also interpreting the
[41:43] scripture
[41:45] he died in the evening time
[41:48] the afternoon
[41:52] so which is the first eve the first
[42:00] evening
[42:04] because that was the sixth hour are we
[42:06] together
[42:10] and it it all goes back
[42:13] to the to the place where the biblical
[42:18] communion time is evening the law
[42:21] supper praise the lord
[42:26] so and in time before the evening
[42:32] we will be we will be stepping out of
[42:34] scripture we will be
[42:35] we will be going back into what
[42:37] catholicism introduced to the word
[42:42] all of these all of these uh uh
[42:45] denominational system
[42:46] you know do their communion in the
[42:48] morning you know and and all of that
[42:53] because that was what uh uh uh uh
[42:55] catholicism gave
[42:57] to the world
[42:58] [Music]
[43:06] he was killed in the evening time this
[43:09] he
[43:09] i mean killing the evil time should be
[43:11] killed the lamb was killed christ died
[43:13] in the evening
[43:14] the afternoon notice he went on he says
[43:16] uh
[43:17] you say every morning i enter i enter
[43:21] the matter they get this that's the
[43:24] church
[43:25] every morning you go to the catholic
[43:27] game
[43:28] well the law let the law
[43:31] let his people go in and out
[43:34] them gates god god people in the
[43:37] catholic church the matter this church
[43:39] the presbyterian church
[43:40] all of them pentecostals show you don't

[43:48] has a
[43:49] setting place a setting gate glory
[43:53] he has a gate but
[43:57] at the place which the law thy god
[44:00] choose to place his name in
[44:03] thou shall sacrifice the passover
[44:07] at evening when did rebecca find
[44:10] isaac when did eleazar call her
[44:15] to be the bride evening
[44:20] time
