[0:42] for the letter that our brother has read
[0:45] and for the attitude of our ministering
[0:47] Brethren here with us and for the
[0:48] audience around and your applauding
[0:51] makes us feel double welcome to come
[0:53] back again and if the good Lord is
[0:55] willing and as soon as we get the
[0:58] opportunity we'll return to this city to
[1:01] stay longer until the thing is over
[1:04] until God tells us it's enough time to
[1:07] go home
[1:15] that thank you
[1:17] kindly I trust that the meeting has been
[1:19] as much blessing to you as it has to to
[1:22] us I say this where I don't have to say
[1:25] it but I say it because it's the truth
[1:29] I've had larger crowds of course in
[1:31] bigger places and we'd had larger crowds
[1:34] here if we'd had the place to take care
[1:35] of them but I never met or was in a
[1:38] nicer meeting and meet met nicer people
[1:41] anywhere in the world than I have in
[1:42] this place that's right and
[1:45] with
[1:48] thank in my heart and I trust that that
[1:53] the meeting will never die that'll live
[1:55] right on in each Church among the people
[1:58] until Jesus comes that's our purpose of
[2:01] being here to bring these meetings
[2:03] everybody's been so kind and you've been
[2:05] so nice to sit in this hot building and
[2:08] it very hot like this and and just stand
[2:11] along the sides and drooping around the
[2:13] doors and come in early and all that's
[2:16] so nice of you and we appreciate it we
[2:18] appreciate this brother I can't think of
[2:20] you being half the time here brother
[2:22] banner and all the cooperating ministers
[2:25] we just thank God for you Brethren
[2:28] you've been so good to us we just
[2:30] trust that God will just pour out his
[2:32] blessings everywhere up on all and to
[2:35] all you people there is just telling me
[2:37] they taking up a love offering for me a
[2:39] few moments ago I appreciate that I
[2:41] don't deserve it that's true I I don't
[2:44] deserve it but brother bter said all the
[2:46] debts were paid and everything and then
[2:48] when they do that then they get a love
[2:50] offering and we appreciate it and and to
[2:53] the best of my knowledge and all that I
[2:55] know every penny of it I shall spend for
[2:58] the glory of God the best that I know
[3:00] how there won't be one foolish thing
[3:02] that that money will go for because at
[3:04] that day we want to be found a good true
[3:06] faithful Steward of his welfare and some
[3:09] of you paid maybe a portion of your
[3:12] living I I wish you wouldn't do that
[3:14] there someone when they taking up a love
[3:15] offering throw a nickel or something and
[3:17] I could you know just something I have
[3:19] got some children and you know how it is
[3:22] but I wish I didn't have to do that but
[3:24] to take one but I do once in a while
[3:27] because I just you can't make ends
[3:30] but we thank you for it God bless you
[3:33] everyone now I trust that I remember in
[3:38] a meeting I used to tell of a little
[3:40] story been at my old brother sitting
[3:42] here I want to shake his hand before St
[3:44] into the ministry our ministering to of
[3:46] the word one time I was going to take up
[3:48] an offering in my church I told my wife
[3:51] I said we just got to have I never took
[3:54] an offering for myself my life and I
[3:57] said we got to have it just a little
[3:58] money I said I tell I'll take up we owed
[4:01] a debt and just had to pay it and so
[4:04] that was my uh former wife it was I was
[4:09] she died years and years ago about 14
[4:12] years ago and I was single for about
[4:15] five or six years a little boy started
[4:17] in school I remarried again God gave me
[4:21] back a perfect image of the little girl
[4:23] that he just taken from me and so I'm so
[4:26] happy about that and then
[4:30] I remember one night it's been about
[4:33] eight years ago I guess we got to a
[4:35] place where we just couldn't make the
[4:37] things going I said I'm going to over
[4:39] and take up an offering she said I'm
[4:40] going to sit down and watch it and so I
[4:43] went over and I told old brother wi
[4:46] heart go get my hat I was going to take
[4:48] up an offering and he looked at me real
[4:50] strange and he started and I looked down
[4:53] and I don't over the r where you ever
[4:54] know Sister Weber remember her and I
[4:56] Frankie's mother and she went out under
[4:58] that little old checked a and got out
[5:00] one little pocket books you know little
[5:01] snaps over the top begin to pull out
[5:03] them nickels oh I couldn't do that I
[5:06] said I was just teasing I didn't mean it
[5:09] and so brother wiart looked at me real
[5:11] strange and went and hung my head up and
[5:14] you know what brother Ryan had rolled a
[5:16] bicycle down in my house and give it to
[5:18] me many of you's been the meeting he me
[5:20] refer to that brother Ryan rolled a
[5:22] bicycle down there and he just left
[5:24] there and give it to me I pained the
[5:25] bicycle and sold it and got the money P
[5:27] to De all these
[5:32] [Applause]
[5:45] [Applause]
[5:46] my poor brother he gave me the bicycle
[5:50] really I couldn't ride the
[5:53] bicycle I did all the D he a good de
[5:57] well bless the Lord
[6:01] that's very nice so I thank you kindly
[6:04] and it is indeed With all sincerity my
[6:07] trust that I can come back to toita just
[6:10] as soon as possible now when I leave
[6:13] Africa come home the Lord willing I'm
[6:15] going out to seek his face to find out
[6:17] which move next I believe you all
[6:19] appreciate that more if you know just
[6:22] exactly where to go he sends me to toita
[6:24] we're going to stay to toita until he
[6:26] says you go somewhere else and just stay
[6:28] there till it's over
[6:30] right now the meeting's just in
[6:31] condition now to where we could really
[6:33] have a real Revival just right now you
[6:36] see all the the spooky feelings of
[6:39] people saying well it might be this it
[6:40] might be that but that's all gone now
[6:43] it's just a great big welcome feeling
[6:45] everywhere you see that's just way to
[6:47] have a Revival to really start it now
[6:49] what do you think about four to six
[6:50] weeks that this would do oh my we'd have
[6:53] a glorious time I tell you I I believe
[6:57] everything in the around would be healed
[6:59] if we can just one by one now the Lord
[7:02] has blessed us this week the lame has
[7:05] walked cripples has been healed and the
[7:08] death is heard and diseas is you know
[7:12] healed and the Lord and I want you to
[7:14] remember this especially to the pastors
[7:17] there'll be weeks after this that you'll
[7:19] hear people in your churches say well I
[7:21] that that Su trouble I had left me I
[7:24] don't know and that women and so forth
[7:27] of the different troubles that you have
[7:29] there's there's been at least I would
[7:31] say this not trying to to say anything
[7:35] wrong because I I don't want to do that
[7:37] God hold me responsible but there's been
[7:39] at least 500 people I'd say lowly
[7:42] estimating that's set in the audience
[7:44] that's never said a word about it that's
[7:45] healed right now now that's right the
[7:48] other night when the last two nights I
[7:50] have never felt such a pull on me and
[7:53] all my life now the way that feels come
[7:56] here just a minute brother when people
[7:58] are being healed
[8:00] now I just want to take this moment to
[8:02] explain this if if when I'm talking to a
[8:05] person I turn and get their attention
[8:08] like out in the audience I look at
[8:10] somebody and see maybe it looks kind of
[8:12] well I go to talking to that person and
[8:15] want to go to talk and then I'll get in
[8:16] contact with their spirit and then it
[8:18] seems like there's something starts
[8:19] pulling just like this and then when it
[8:23] lets up I get real weak that person's
[8:25] healed that's all thank you brother and
[8:28] that's that person is is
[8:30] healed they may not recognize it right
[8:32] then but they will later on they'll
[8:34] recognize they'll recognize as it's been
[8:37] done now may the good Lord bless every
[8:41] one of you and just fill you with his
[8:44] goodness and mercy and all you sitting
[8:46] along here and here I see these three or
[8:49] four chairs sitting here and
[8:52] people with different ailments suffering
[8:56] and everything uh you just be of a good
[8:58] courage and believe with all all your
[8:59] heart and God's going to make everyone
[9:01] well I don't know where there's any
[9:02] laying back under there so far that it's
[9:05] just right down here sometimes I'm miss
[9:07] seeing these people are looking over the
[9:09] top of them watching out there
[9:13] um well I don't know what else to say
[9:15] but to tell you I'm I'm so happy to be
[9:18] with you and I trust that maybe if you
[9:21] get a chance sometime when your own
[9:22] church hasn't got service next week to
[9:25] slip up the area with us we'd be happy
[9:27] to have you and write metime write me
[9:31] down home I'll be glad to hear from you
[9:34] and sometimes it's sending out these
[9:36] anointed cloths and so forth how many
[9:38] believes in sending those out those oh
[9:40] that's wonderful well I tell you if you
[9:44] just go into my office and see the
[9:46] thousands of healings takes place just
[9:48] by sending those claws just thousands
[9:50] here recently I was sent one to Germany
[9:53] to a woman that had arthritis for years
[9:56] and it was translated on the back of her
[9:57] German right in she got a hold of that
[10:01] cloth and she pinned it on her and
[10:03] followed the instructions and she said
[10:04] now devil you get out she got up and
[10:06] walked across floor she was now devil
[10:09] you get out now she just believed it
[10:13] and a little something uh I hope if I
[10:17] told this testimony just a moment before
[10:19] the audience you forgive me for it cuz
[10:22] I'm sometimes telling around different
[10:24] places I don't know if people that's
[10:25] been the meetings an outstanding one was
[10:28] one night when I was in a little a
[10:29] church meeting at caring Arkansas just
[10:31] starting and I used to take and send
[10:34] give the people H just and in the
[10:35] meetings like here here's a box of them
[10:38] I don't get a chance to minister to
[10:39] those just like this because I'm always
[10:42] when the meeting is going on in deem
[10:45] prayer
[10:46] then when I go home brother bter was
[10:49] with me the other day I've got a cave
[10:52] way back in the Hills where I go to I
[10:54] showed him where I met the angel on the
[10:56] path I was going back there all torn up
[10:58] and I'm let him on the path and he told
[11:00] me said you return back to your car for
[11:03] I've called you to be with ER Baxter and
[11:05] I went to him and we've been together so
[11:08] right on that place I go back there and
[11:10] pray hours after hours over every piece
[11:15] of goods that I send to the people now I
[11:17] don't stand anxious because they cost
[11:19] about 10 cents a piece and we send out
[11:20] around anywhere 5 6 7,000 a week I don't
[11:24] have the money to do that but I buy
[11:25] hundreds and hundreds of yards of ribbon
[11:27] and cut it off in little strips like
[11:28] this the people can pin it on their
[11:30] clothes I'd be glad to send you one if
[11:33] you don't need it right now put it in
[11:35] the Bible on Acts 19 and just keep it
[11:37] there and if an emergency Rises take it
[11:40] and lay it on your child has got the
[11:41] coup or whatever takes place and believe
[11:44] God just as a little U token of his love
[11:47] in this meeting and many things has been
[11:50] done and it's free of charge just saying
[11:52] we'd be happy to send it to you
[11:55] now I this lady I gave her a hand she
[11:59] wanted me to she said bless the
[12:01] handkerchief now a lot of people anoint
[12:03] them that's all right anything that God
[12:05] blesses I'm for it but if you watch the
[12:07] scripture Paul didn't anoint them he
[12:09] take them off of his body see just off
[12:11] of his body I believe that's right is it
[12:14] and Paul knew that you know where I
[12:16] think he got that Brethren I think when
[12:18] Elijah taking the told said take my
[12:20] staff and go lay it on the child you see
[12:22] Elijah knew that everything that he
[12:23] touched was blessed but whether the
[12:25] woman would believe it or not and Paul
[12:27] taken from his body an and aprons and
[12:29] laid on the sick and unclean spirits
[12:31] went out of them and diseases were
[12:33] healed now it wasn't Paul it was God
[12:37] that is God and honoring the people's
[12:39] faith in his servant well now the same
[12:41] God was there I'm not the St Paul none
[12:44] of us are but he's still the same Jesus
[12:46] you see it wasn't it wasn't the St Paul
[12:49] anyhow but it was Jesus now this woman
[12:53] taking it and put it in her Bible and a
[12:55] few weeks after that she was cleaning a
[12:58] lamp chimney way back there in a cotton
[13:00] country of Arkansas and the old an chimy
[13:03] broken and cut the archery in her arm
[13:05] now this is her story she got a pillow
[13:09] slip and put over it and it just got wet
[13:11] with blood she got a sheep close to his
[13:13] neighbor was two miles her husband was
[13:14] in the city and she's bleeding getting
[13:16] weaker she knew she was going to die
[13:18] shortly if something didn't happen and
[13:20] she thought of the hand Chief she went
[13:22] and got the hand Chief and laid it on
[13:24] there now here's her testimony when her
[13:26] husband came in that evening she waited
[13:29] about two mile or better through the mud
[13:31] with their boots on hung a lantern in
[13:34] the tree caught the Greyhound bus and
[13:36] come to a little rock where was holding
[13:37] the meeting and walked in with these
[13:39] boots on holding this handkerchief
[13:41] praising God the handkerchief wasn't
[13:43] even stained just a miracle just stopped
[13:45] it right like that the woman was dying
[13:48] that's the only thing that she could get
[13:49] to like that as she knew of and God
[13:51] honored her faith in doing so now we all
[13:55] we us believe that I've sent a little
[13:57] thing with it it tells you how you get
[13:59] to your pastor and get him to come and
[14:01] and confess your faults and get rid of
[14:03] everything and then lay it on there
[14:05] there's nothing in the way God will do
[14:06] it don't you believe that and now God be
[14:10] with you and thank you again from the
[14:12] pastors to the co-workers The Strangers
[14:15] in our gates the custodian sh the
[14:18] auditorium all the ushers you've all
[14:21] been wonderful and may God's richest of
[14:25] blessings be upon you all pray for me
[14:28] while I'm going Yonder to pray for
[14:31] someone
[14:32] else I want to read just a little bit of
[14:34] scripture before we start the meeting
[14:36] cuz we want to give plenty time in the
[14:38] prayer line tonight just as long as we
[14:39] can then immediately after this I got to
[14:41] catch a Greyhound bus and bump my till
[14:45] morning I couldn't get a reservation
[14:47] I've got to go home the wife was going
[14:49] to try to get here and she couldn't get
[14:51] here no one to bring her so I have to go
[14:54] in tonight to get her to come back
[14:55] tomorrow and and be in area so pray for
[14:59] me now while I read this scripture found
[15:02] in St John
[15:03] 4:46
[15:05] beginning so Jesus came again into Canan
[15:09] of Galilee where he made the water wine
[15:13] and there was a certain noan whose son
[15:15] was sick at capernium and when he heard
[15:18] that Jesus was come out of Judea into
[15:21] Galilee he went unto him and besought
[15:23] him that he would come down and heal his
[15:25] son for he was at the point of death
[15:29] then said Jesus unto him now listen
[15:32] close except you see signs and wonders
[15:35] you will not believe but listen this
[15:37] Gallant man answer our
[15:39] master and an old woman said unto him
[15:41] sir come down ear my child
[15:45] I Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son
[15:48] liveth now the man wanted Jesus to come
[15:51] pray for his son but Jesus told him he
[15:53] didn't go pray for him he said go thy
[15:55] way thy son liveth
[15:59] and the man believed the word that Jesus
[16:02] spoke unto him and he went his way and
[16:06] when he was now going down his servant
[16:08] met him and told him saying thy son
[16:11] liveth then inquired he required him
[16:16] saying beg your
[16:19] pardon then inquired he of them the hour
[16:22] he began to am in then said he un to him
[16:26] yesterday at the seventh hour the the
[16:29] fever left him see he was just mending
[16:30] getting a little better so the father
[16:33] knew that it was the same hour that
[16:34] Jesus said thy son
[16:37] liveth and himself beli and his whole
[16:40] household this is again the second
[16:43] miracle that Jesus did when he came out
[16:45] of Judea and
[16:48] Galilee let's bow our heads
[16:51] Lord now the service is almost ready to
[16:54] begin again a closing night here among
[16:58] this lovely people
[16:59] people God how did you ever bless me in
[17:02] such a way to bring me up and let me be
[17:05] able to stand and talk to such an
[17:09] audience of people lovely Born Again
[17:12] Christians oh God I just love you for it
[17:17] and there's no words that I can find to
[17:18] express my thanks that you let me meet
[17:21] these ministers and these people out
[17:23] here lovely people your people the very
[17:27] cream of the crop of the Earth's Harvest
[17:30] and not only that to meet them and to
[17:33] know them but to have fellowship with
[17:35] them through thy son Christ Jesus and to
[17:37] know that I'm a fellow citizen with them
[17:39] an heir of the same kingdom of God we're
[17:42] journeying through earth going to heaven
[17:44] where we'll associate together through
[17:46] out ceaseless ages throughs of time
[17:49] we'll be together forever not where
[17:52] we'll be sick again are not where we'll
[17:54] be in buildings and have to crawl across
[17:58] the the country to pray for each other
[18:00] but where there'll be no sickness and
[18:02] there'll be no old age or there will be
[18:05] no cripples or no blind but we'll be
[18:08] young there forever and we'll be in his
[18:11] likeness and what a glorious time
[18:13] that'll be oh Father I just feel like
[18:16] just raising my hands up and just
[18:18] screaming as loud as I can to give vent
[18:21] to the feeling that's within me of the
[18:23] appreciations of all that you've done
[18:25] bless this city Lord bless the people
[18:28] bless the the lawmakers of the city God
[18:32] grant that there will be an oldfashioned
[18:33] Revival to sweep this city Lord and
[18:36] these anointed ones that's sitting here
[18:38] in the presence tonight these Ministers
[18:40] of God represented here on this platform
[18:42] and out there in that audience oh God
[18:44] charge their life with New Vision with
[18:48] new power and may there just be
[18:51] abundance of rain from everywhere Lord
[18:54] coming into the churches hear the prayer
[18:57] of your servant now and now keep us ever
[18:59] in your will give us a great service
[19:02] tonight for we ask it in the name of thy
[19:04] Child Jesus
[19:10] amen I believe Billy has stepped out
[19:12] brother back for just a moment it's till
[19:14] they come in now have faith don't doubt
[19:18] believe with all your heart and let's
[19:20] look tonight for for the climax of all
[19:22] the meeting will you do that I believe
[19:24] if God will visit us this third time
[19:26] like he has the last two nights I
[19:28] believe it'll settle the question don't
[19:31] you all the letters are pouring in so
[19:34] just from places about how they're being
[19:37] healed and people going home and leaving
[19:39] the meeting going home and then be there
[19:41] maybe a few hours the first thing you
[19:42] know wake up the next morning maybe
[19:44] blind seeing and the or just
[19:46] everything's taking place how thankful
[19:49] the thing that people hear you don't you
[19:51] don't get to hear a third of it it's
[19:53] after a day or two do you notice Jesus
[19:56] here when he said thy son liveth well
[19:58] that was one day and the next day he was
[20:00] going down and his son had began to
[20:03] amend he said this is the second miracle
[20:06] that Jesus did seemingly we wouldn't
[20:08] call that a miracle but it was a miracle
[20:10] because anything that's out of the
[20:12] ordinary it's a miracle Jesus told the
[20:15] man that his son was going to live and
[20:18] the man believed what Jesus said is that
[20:21] right perhaps there's 100 prayer cards
[20:23] in here tonight in a few moments I'll
[20:26] call from somewhere in those prayer
[20:28] cards well then you say brother Brandon
[20:30] then if my prayer card is not called
[20:32] what about it that don't mean that
[20:33] you're you can't get healed you can be
[20:35] healed anywhere that you'll believe that
[20:37] Jesus Christ healed you see anywhere
[20:40] will you always remember
[20:42] that always remember that healing
[20:46] everything that Christ can do for you is
[20:49] already
[20:52] done amen see everything that Christ and
[20:56] God can do for you is already done now
[21:00] the next thing lays within you if you're
[21:03] a sinner Jesus has already saved you but
[21:07] you when he died to take away the sin of
[21:08] the world but you have to accept it if
[21:12] you'd say I've paid your way brother
[21:13] brandom home well it wouldn't do me no
[21:15] good unless I accepted it and Christ
[21:17] death won't help you until you accept it
[21:19] now by his stripes you were healed he
[21:21] heals you when he made the atonement for
[21:23] you but now it'll never do you no good
[21:26] till you accept it and when you accept
[21:28] it and believe it then it is yours now
[21:32] you see it's up to you now the things
[21:34] that he does he sends signs and wonders
[21:36] to to prove those things that it's that
[21:39] it can be
[21:40] done here I'd like for you
[21:57] to
