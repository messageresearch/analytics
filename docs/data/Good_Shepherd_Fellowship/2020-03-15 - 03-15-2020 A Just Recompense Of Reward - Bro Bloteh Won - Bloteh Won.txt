let's try that one more time to eat oh yes we see [Music] yes for me [Music] [Music] praise the Lord before we get into the preaching of the word Amen was thinking a little bit I said you were afraid of the worst praise the Lord but you know I'm learning to to to know some things as we as we keep learning all the time there's a testimony and I was listening to in the week and it's a tremendous testimony you know as the Word of God teaches us music song is the next thing to the Word of God that a human soul can feed on and and it's because God taught music in us music is not coming from outside music is coming from inside many of the times we struggle to express it because we we are so filled with this thing that you know the sound that is coming from outside sometimes we get distracted by other people voices sometimes we get intimidated by other people voices and all of their Bermuda is actually from the human soul science prove it there was a man that had a drowning accident yeah I think he want to you want to save a try that was draining or he fell into the lake I was just listening to that couple of days ago and it's interesting how some of those things you are not able to follow the DJ because you are just attracted by the resort and actually when he got out of the water from that drowning accident that he had he did he developed a syndrome and his syndrome was he could hear the sound and play the piano he never went to music school the effect of that drowning created music in him you can just start singing he would get to the piano and play never went to music school the second proof the medical science prove it and mainly Harvey if you if you have time check it up she's uh she's a death musician she don't yell like you like every one of us or like some of us praise the Lord but maybe she lost her hearing she was doing music from four years old and she'll also hearing I think around eleven years also and and I mean everything went bad she she couldn't hear anything but over the years she said one of her inspiration came from she was coming down the stairs and she fell and right on the floor I talked to a struck her you could stay right down here and feel sorry for yourself and just hitting or as you could try to get up so from that inner inspiration she wrote a song called try and all the songs that she sings she write her own songs she writes her own music and from that inspiration of try I want to play the video for you this morning but I mean I'm just I'm just I just want to hold myself together and because of all the things that is going through my mind but from that from that inspiration that came from in her she decided to try music again so how do mainly listening to music she when she singing she don't wear shoes she feed the music through the floor she put her bare feet on the ground when the musicians are playing she feed the music to her music is not sound music it's a feeling you can hear you have voices and you sit there and sing as if to say you don't have life but you know I realize that it don't take the music if you really want to enjoy the music you got to be happy it's not a music that makes you happy you got to have an inner happiness in you for you to be able to express it we can bring all the jazz band we can bring them we can change this thing if you don't have joy in you we can blast this place you will just be dead and poor as you are praise the Lord we're living in a world where people are looking for people to make them happy but let me tell you it's happy people that attracts happy people praise the Lord if you are looking for somebody to make you happy you will Ramin side the rest of your life because even if the most happiest person come around you you will contaminate their happiness with the zionists that is sitting down in you and everybody will be sorry praise the Lord anyway will greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen and worship is very important part of the service very very important it can it can make the preacher cranky like I feel like this morning or it can make the preacher fly through the road praise the Lord but we are glad to be in the house of the Lord and you know you know the people have got some victory you know when when you see how they are singing in the air rejoicing and worshiping the Lord and you know you can know that the camp has been wounded when you see how the people are groaning and you know India prays to the Lord but we trust that the Lord will bring us some victory amen praise the Lord the scripture says the joy of the Lord is our strength amen the joy of the Lord is our strength so we pray that he will give us some joy pills so we can be able to get some strain to face the day you know we are in we are in socially age you think about the little group of people that we are trying to be happy in this whole world working coronavirus is making everybody side and scaring the spirit of fear is upon the world that your your joy is being so suppressed by the fear demon and and I mean we trying to sing as if to say oh we're just waking up from bed is because of the spirit of the age I mean social fear is splegg in the word that I mean your little strain of joy has just been suppressed by their spirit and sometimes you just ask yourself why am I feeling like this you know sometimes it's not really you it's just the atmosphere that is all around us that we have to deal with praise the Lord and then knowing that we must not give in to it Amen we must not give in to fear we must not give in to you know demon suppression we must be able to fight our way through by sinking by lifting our hands by clapping our hands for the Lord by creating some sense of life praise the Lord amen let's stand on our feet the joy of the Lord is my strain Lessing dad a little bit here amen we have so much thing to thank God for so much thing to praise Him for so much thing to worship him for him in he deserve all of our praise and our worship Him in a mean the joy the joy of the Lord is my strength the joy of the Lord is my strength or the joy of the Lord is my strength let's do that one more time all that yes my the first begin to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them they hear him let's pray father this morning we bring I was sacrificed to you our sacrifice of praise our sacrifice of

you we appreciate you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you can have your seat praise the Lord Wednesday now we were speaking a little better and we talked about how God is in the interruption of our lives and and then yesterday when we were having our young people meeting you know our session of subject that we were dealing with as as the brothers we heard our our our speaker saying the same thing to us about how God came into how he could see God in the interruption of things that took place in his life this morning I woke up around 3 a.m. and I woke up to to this stop there was something also we were talking about yesterday that that that turn out so beautiful and and what what the thought was actually we were we were trying to look at in some sense because our subject it's not for everybody so I'm not going to tell everybody what we were talking about so trying to paraphrase it so you would not really know what we were talking about if you want to know you have to come to the meeting I mean so but what actually is we were we were trying to look at a coal equal we were trying to look at you know the the blessing of you know the blessing and and in the protection things that God poured into you into marriage relationship things that God put into there now you mean your mind we just think that we were talking about marriage world us okay and if you make that conclusion in your mind you will not be wrong you will not be right anyway so praise the Lord but yearís here is what struck me in yesterday and as as we were talking I went thinking about there because I've always thought about there but it came to me in a different way and and this will help you to bring you to where we want to talk about this morning and marriage and divorce is the faith sorry I never did a good job this morning I had I had two separate notes and I was trying to merge them together so and and and I mean a lot of other things were happening around me by marriage and their vasa the prophet of god said this and we want to we want to read it to you now it is after the beginning now there is a double coveting first it was just a coveting adenine Eve was co-equal one man one woman now that were co-equal and the Bible says God made man Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 in His image male and female are we together so they work all equal amen but when the four came in Genesis chapter 3 because like Paul says Eve was deceived so she fell from that Paul equalness with man Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and the scripture says and your husband will have the rule over you but here is he here is it now you grab this now yes yes it here that the work that was given to the man because you will see this very same thing Adam fell from the image of God as being the son of God with Dominion and power amen and and and the power of the spoken word he fell from there and Jesus came to redeem him to bring him back to that call' equalness that's what the work of redemption is for god is bringing us back to work adam fell from so the work that is given to the man under the covenant of marriage is to be able to lift the woman up to that call equal position praise the Lord and a way to do it like Paul says in efficient is by love and a woman the way to be able to to get to that place is by submission now we're living in a world that that you hear over and over the equality and pay equality and job equality the word is trying to produce that out of God's Lord amen they are trying to produce that they are trying to get a word to that place of offer of edom condition without God's law it will now work that way praise the Lord many in homes and marriages I suffering because we're trying to achieve that out of God's principle and it's not going to work that way praise the Lord now but as I was thinking on that I woke up this morning I started studying a little bit on coal equalness and and and my mom was driving today and I asked myself where I'm not I'm not teaching they're preaching on the marriage seminar this morning pretty soon the young people would think I'm trying to expose their secret so so so I then I went I went in and then I started playing the message I was listening to listening to a subject and it just became so it came so powerful now you think about it now because I was thinking about you know just like I said in the beginning what we said you know God is in the interruption that that the interruption was on my mind I thought that's what I was going to go into but then I'm looking into cold equalness and then something also came up that's what I want to share with you but this morning I want to talk on it just recompense of reward I mean it just recompense of reward and pretty soon we will see the the the coal equalness and and what I was studying there the word equity came out a stranger the word equity came out because you know I've been really trying to understand this word equity without with all of the you know things that is happening but that's what we want to look at this this morning if the lord help us we may not be able to get through it I just saw we'll try to lay the foundation but I just reckon pains of reward amen I was also looking at the word Richard retribution we also have to do with recompense but let me step like this and says the principle of God God's principle girl's principle is like gravity effect praise the Lord God's law that he made just like gravity is also God's Lord but I'm saying in a way so we can be able to understand it that no matter where your faith level is your understanding is your level of education whether they believe God or they don't believe God or their ideas or their I mean whatever it is we all are affected by gravity amen the law of God affect every one of us that's why have our feet on the ground that's what is keeping you in your seat now if it only takes the Word of God for God's law to affect your life some people will be sitting and some people will be floating praise the Lord but because no matter what your choice is no matter what your state of life is the Lord of God still has an effect on us that is the reason why or every one of us our feet is glued to the floor nobody floating this morning amen so the principle of God's law the way to be able to understand it like you you take the lord of reproduction your whatsoever a man soul is that's what he will read now that is not only applied to a crease that is apply everywhere of our life because that is God's law just like the way gravity is affecting us that we are holding to the ground praise the Lord no matter what is happening you know you know the the plaque is in the air but yet instead gravity is having its effect upon our lives that is the way the laws the principle of God Lord is praise the Lord thinking about just recompense I was trying to find one of the one of the easier way to be able to explain it Wednesday night I spoke a little bit about how the how the age or the ages we we receive the benefit from the ages that were before us good and also bad and that is the end that is what we want to look at this morning praise the Lord because you can have spiritual growth without sacrifice you can have spiritual growth you can you can grow any things of God you can grow in understanding your relationship with God without sacrifice praise the Lord you can enjoy the the benefit the realness of God without sacrifice praise the Lord I was praying this morning I said Lord you got to help me because I'm caught up between these two thoughts but I want the grace of God to be able to help us so we can be able to get something out of it praise the Lord now so you will see that a lot of God in the Old Testament as the scripture would teach us you know the Lord that came out like an eye for an eye you knowing a tooth for a tooth in all of the earth you will realize that it is the Lord of God this whole thing about co-equal nets in equity is their term the measure of wrong must be equal to the measure of punishment amen the measure of wrong now let's go back to Genesis I just think I broke the ice because I saw myself getting through your spirit right now let's go back to Genesis think about what wrong did Adam and Eve did they are wrong the perfect atmosphere and perfect creation that they were dwelling in never had to go to work I mean an immersion and I mean you don't have to train them a lot before you could play with them they were right there to play with what wrong you think about it that when you talk about cold equalness you talk about equity it must be there the same amount of wrong is equal to the amount of punishment if you flip the coin around also you will realize that in God who blessed man and God will be merciful let me bring another story to you they teeth on the cross just before his last birth before he would give up the ghost all the wrong he has done I mean that man he was facing a capital punishment he was a notorious criminal but what right did he do for him to have the equal payment that this thing you would be with me in paradise equity it has to be equal it have to be equal that a man have to do something right to be able to inherit the kingdom of God over all the wrong that he have done and a man had to have done something wrong so wrong so bad that he could lose the privilege of speaking to the Wayne what was the wrong if it was just an easy wrong of offending God like a brother said it was just to say God I'm sorry it was just to see Lord I'm sorry Eve to Adam I mean tell Adam and I'm sorry that I did this and Adam go back to God and said god I'm sorry but you well you will realize that whatever was done hi Sasha wait and what was that just one word broke him out of God's Word just a lie that was told young people are you yelling me this morning praise the Lord just a lie that was told just unbelief that enter into the human spirit you will see why God closed the Bible he said if any man were our one word to this or take one word out of it 20 nose back to Genesis the seriousness that God put to his word the seriousness the he put to his word praise the Lord are we together but just recompense of reward therefore we ought to gave the most earnest heed amen to the things which we have heard we have to remind ourselves where the word the word is turning in the things that are happening we are now like children in the DAK we have been reading the prophecy of God's Word we know that we are coming right down to this time how we have to take the most earnest heed to the things that we have heard how we need to sit down in our home a letter on our bed and starts to remind ourself how we need to take the most earnest he to the things that we have heard least at any time that you slip away praise praise the Lord you know that that word slipped away reality does not mean that you and I remember it but you will not for the same value it will not have no weight to you amen it will not have no no value to you there will be nothing you know in that word that is able to conscious you of the owl that we are living in are we together praise the Lord think about it there are men on the cross that is you think about it and I can tell you this morning I will firm about God's Word that there is one thing that you need to do to get it just recompense there is one thing that you need to do to get God's favor to please God amen scripture says with our faith no man can please God but read a fifth chapter in a book of Hebrew Paul he brought our things in a walk with God amen no one or big God he caught something there was one thing he did in his life all the law of seeing that we all were born we were all born in sin ship that in inhibiter going down here to help but those men found something that they did and it brought them to a just recompense praise the Lord I'm I'm kind of for working with you I'm I'm struggling this morning just to be able to to catch you to where my touch I be able to work with you praise the Lord and young people I'm after you this morning amen praise the Lord the ones that I stay playing Church I'm after you this morning glory be to God and I believe that the Lord is after every one of us this morning praise the Lord they just reckon pains even in the business word you know the the the housing market will tell you you need to get to a certain level in your pyramid for you to have setting a man of equity you just don't buy a house and then I mean after one two years then you expect to get equity out of the house you know you need to get to a certain level of commitment praise the Lord Amen the just recompense of reward so we see here through the Word of God that back to the beginning when God express his thought of bringing for his children let us make man in our image the scripture says male and female created he them you know for a long time I've had one subject in my mind that I was I was looking for an opportunity to preach on a wedding and that subject that I was going to preach if I had the opportunity I was going to speak on rape era I be out of from from the rape of a man God brought a woman and in the way I was going to title that message was rest in brokenness a woman is a man rest in brokenness praise the Lord because the man is broken amen he's broken God had to break his side with hamon break the rapes and take the woman out and she came out whole so he's broken and she's hold he had to be broken for her to behold praise the Lord Amen and she has she has she has a lot of abilities a lot of abilities we mean can multitask more than maintain we mean are very hard workers whether you want to believe your net but it's proving there be a hard workers more than a man can praise the Lord it's because of the way that God made him the way that God made him the way a woman is made with her brain works I mean she can be cooking talking on the phone pressing at the same time in order there I don't want to get into death amen but social strength social strength if if you know if things would just be kept in their place amen and we will just understand this beautiful picture of what God is doing it's now what it's not about what you are doing or what you think it's all about what God is doing praise the Lord and with all the ability and all that strength and all that smartness here God keep pointing to her you came out of that brokenness and you must submit to that brokenness you must take all of that strength that you have back to that brokenness now that's word it's difficult because in this present world she's assuming that she has all this ability by herself amen and there was just something in the man's mind when when when he becomes the man by marriage that he's demanding it praise the Lord how do I find myself to this to this place but God right there in the beginning created them male and female in his image when he express himself in the form of his creation he expressed himself male and female that was a spiritual being amen cool equal right there I mean in that way the word the same you see that is the reason why the seven of God some of his sayings are so powerful and then sometimes people I think it's in a way of analyzing you know God seven or the Prophet as notice it's because I mean the word of the law comes to the Prophet take this same a chain is only as strong and its weak you see because Adam was already broken so he never needed to be broken again what needed to be broken was the strength that came out of his brokenness when the enemy got to Eve it was easy for Adam to fall because he was already broken or something got a revelation of death when he went to those Philistines he says out of the strong comes the sweet and those Philistines were confused what is he talking about I mean he have just killed a lion and then on his return he was so hungry interstate and right there in that in the score of the the airline I mean he pulled the Lion apart and writing in the score of faith that the bees have have settled down there and put someone in there and that was the thing they had sistene at him in that Johnny above the strong praise the Lord my goodness may the Lord help us but it just recompense God rewarded himself when he expressed himself let us make man in our image he rewarded himself by having both the male and the female called equal at the same place praise the Lord because that's the Lord of God that's the Lord of just recompense therefore a man to be rewarded with sufficiently for for a man to be rewarded with eternal life there is something that's supposed to be done you you think about an eternal life for you to have eternal life there is something that's supposed to be done they are equivalent to eternal life now you tell me what could you do in time to be equal with eternal life what could you do what could you do in time what could you achieve in time even if you have from the day of creation to the end of creation to live what could you achieve in time that is the reason why the Lamb how to write your name in the Lamb book of life from the foundation of the world praise the Lord and all you have to do is to just recognize say all you have to do it so you can't believe it when you recognize it and believe it you come to the equivalent or having eternal life praise Allah why are we together amen do you realize there Joseph was sold into slavery went down there as a young 15 year old boy so innocent yeah I mean he's just so trouble can't understand all of these things that is happening in the RAI his life what did Joseph do what did he do it won't sense for him to have gone through out of there and what did he do in the nurseries for him to come out of there praise the Lord came favor will fortify listen to me young people praise the Lord you sit down under this word you hear the preaching of the gospel and you tell yourself that you are still young and you are still a child you are not you are responsible for everything you are hearing praise the Lord once ever gather him to the toll to Potiphar fortifying Eisen and he took this boy name and he realized that his house has been blessed he puttin me trash of everything praise the Lord and yearís yeah what a fine wife with a lustful demon but you see God please those things dear to grab our attention amen there were all the things that might have happened Joseph was up he was a Hebrew and the people knew because he had to learn the language they knew that he was not from Egypt no doubt they hated him for his nationality the scripture did not recorded that they were other half hard things he went true but there was one thing they won't think young people that you would do that was thinner before God there is one thing that you would do out of your innocent heart out of what you have heard and what you have learned there was something you would do that would please God so much that he would decide to bless you in your schooling decide to bless you with a good job beside Oh bless your future just because you did something called with all the troubles and other things that he had I believe for Potiphar and an Egypt into trust J Joseph with his house he might have put money on a counter he might have tried to amend just try to find evil in this board in every way but the scripture did not record it none of the ad what scripture recorded was the temptation he had with Potiphar's wife praise the Lord and see how the Bible describing the Bible said when Joseph was caught in the hour of temptation he never said no you are not my wife in and III mean the thing there was that attracted heaven to that teenager was when he told that woman about his God praise the Lord now I know I'm not thinking about your husband I'm not afraid of your husband I'm not afraid of what the other man in the compound was saying whether that the thing that I'm troubled about here is that this is an evil against my god I'm noticing God in the time of his trial being conscious of God nobody was there the house was quiet praise the Lord the house was quiet he was there alone and I'm telling you he could have done evil it would slip under the rod and nobody would know about it beside the one with the just recompense beside that reward justly and we together I'm not making sense of what I'm talking about what I'm talking about amen the reward of blessing should be equal to the obedience praise the Lord and you see the evil of our church what gospel and prosperity gospel when they talk about blessing and you will be blessed and you will prosper they don't talk about your obedience to the Word of God they talk about how you can get me my next new car how the man of God needs to be I mean you just need to flower me with your money you know and God will bless you praise the Lord now they are not talking about a just recompense amen they are ruling the house of the people into a temporary a gambling it's just like a man that goes through a slot machine he takes his high-end money and Troy in the machine in a spray that you become a villa near when his house rain is now pay his phone bill is not paid he takes all of that money through into the slot machine to turn it around in aspect to become a middle name yes that's the way prosperity gospel has turned the people to be they have nothing to do with the just recompense you have to realize that the just recompense is to warn towards the one that is just and there is only one God are we together praise the Lord that thing there little young Joseph there hey please God so much that carry him to the dungeon was not a problem praise the Lord you know you you just think about it in his mind he's true for God Jehovah God I won't defy myself because of the God of my father's here said she told out on him and then and now he's thrown in praising praise the Lord how how dad I mean how they are thinking we throw about the heart of this young boy what have a dog he been a human equal think well maybe if I would have agreed to her happy in the prison well you see he did what was right heaven stamp it already no matter that thoughts of confusion I went in his mind that down for Tots their own claim thought his decision at that moment please God pray sir but just record things you can have spiritual growth without sacrifice amen WebM says that's why we're not getting nothing from the service because we don't want to sacrifice praise the Lord Sunday school is becoming too burdensome for people I mean it looks like we come and spend a lot of time but you won't mind spending eight hours at work or even spending more than they are doing nothing praise the Lord as long as we can get here before the Sun service starts you create in your mind that you are on time you are not on time amen you are not on time you are just becoming your own pleaser you are just becoming self worshipper God is better so come to the house of God pray before the service that's the sacrifice that we make for a good service that's why we put into a good service what are the Wednesday night or the Sun and imma make no different to a one with a heart of expectation I want to see God coming on the scene no one are we sit back and we just criticize we put the service on the scale what it was a good service on that because you're not even prepared you not pray up praise the Lord we're not prayed up what are we sacrificing praise the Lord Luke chapter 7 Luke chapter 7 show us a beautiful yeah beautiful scene right in there chapter the first one talks about the see Tyrion amen a man that Jesus commended Jesus commended his attitude this man he was a Gentile this man he was in the best place of his life praise the Lord the scripture says this was his seven it was not even his son so for a matter of fat he could have choose not to care because he had a lot of sevens amen he could have choose not to care but you see that those are the things that attract good for him to even please to put those things in the scripture there were a lot of things that happen in that day but just that attitude of the man please God that the Holy Spirit had to compare look and compare the writers to put that story in the book its attitude please God he says I'm a man of authority and no one Authority is praise the Lord Amen we're talking about just recompense this was a man that Jesus said you're seven that very moment Jesus speak he went back in the Acts and he said where it was about eleven o'clock he says that's right that was it that time he spoke he got a just recompense because he did something that brought him to that equal level forget his Resort at the same time praise the Lord are we together and what he did being a Gentile being a man of authority you re right there in the same chapter 7 when you go down you will see another displayed of Simon this one was a Jew he was a Pharisees he sat in his house and he invited Jesus to his house this man was a man of authority at this particular time the Roman was ruling over the Jews a man of authority having men honor his control he left his house he went to find Jesus there acted to you of living his house making effort to go and found Jesus let a Pharisee sitting right there with white garment on him his my fellow city proud spirit giving Jesus an invitation for him to come to his house just to ridicule him and his Gentile having an attitude and man of authority he says no you said I hear myself going I'm not sending a letter I'm not sending anybody I'm going there [Music] Authority we want power we want spoken word but are we ready to submit ourselves I was ready to submit ourself obedience to the simpliest Inc read your Bible and pray obedience to the simpliest thing be the church on time we want Authority we want the devil to recognize our voice when we speak praise the Lord are we together amen you see God or all of the power that is that is in the woman that came out of that brokenness girl see in summation that's how she gets power that's how her power is displayed in submission it is the same thing of the church that's how the church power when we submit our self to the word when we obey the where we do what the word says not being arrogant in our spirit I think that we have right to anything we are just saved by grace praise the Lord he went out he saw Jesus he submitted himself he submitted himself he humble himself he never went with title he never went with anything praise the Lord just like I said this was his seven it was not his son he grew up here less but with the attitude that this is a human just like me we don't have to go to the same church he don't have to believe the message he said he will be if he needs help why not happy that attitude Jesus say I have now seen such a thing I have not seen such a faith that a man of your level your caliber will come in humble himself young people praise the Lord love the Lord with all of your heart out of your mind out of your strength praise the Lord give your heart to the things of God give you a strength to the things of God give your mind to the things of God just record things equal you want you know what I realized as I was stating this let me find a place to close here just like you look at the word equity when you look at the word iniquity iniquity is the same as equity but it means not enough equity praise the Lord it means that we have been taught and know from the scripture that iniquity is norine that is not right and you are doing it that's iniquity praise the Lord so in another sense it means that you don't have enough equity to what you know what you know is up here and your level is down here because of what you are doing praise the Lord amen just like I said I'm trying to find a place to close here so I'm trying to jump over some of mine my notes here but as I was looking at that this morning I mean it just kind of a hit me praise the Lord you know it kind of hit me because the thing about it is is data this is God's law also the scripture says the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world amen so God Genesis were looking at because the beginning is the foundation and God in His Lord something had to die for something to live praise the Lord it's in his law something had to die for something to live praise the Lord amen and that was the thing that pleased God with abl sacrifice because he caught it it mean a please God with every sacrifice because he caught the Lord of God so he sacrificed and lamb and God was pleased in the scripture says he got a just recompense that his voice cry out of the earth he was counted as righteous because he caught that Lord amen we have a vowel and society violence is living because something had to die righteousness had to be killed divorce is living breathing jumping up and rejoicing why because people have laid the standard down they had killed God principle something have to die for something to live disobedience to parents and all of these things violence in the mind of young people it's living it's all over the place why like if like a preacher said he said they have forsaken the Almighty God for the mighty dollars thinking that getting the child the next iPhone we ease the attention down it would take the after station away from them and you're working and want to catch the children above all the new things and everything they laid down the principle of godliness and praying in their home and and and being in church they kill all of those things in their life can you make violent strong you make evil to rain because something have to die for something to live it's a lot of God how would you get it just record please praise the Lord the young rich ruler came to Jesus and said will master what can I do since all of these things I have done from the days of my youth I've been in church amen Jesus told him if you want the recompense of eternal life sacrifice sacrifice amen because something have to die for something to live for a victorious prayer life the joy of the law to live in your life something have to die you have to kill something you have to work on temper you have to work on bitterness you have to work I mean you have to kill those things wash them from your life for joy and happiness and a smiley face to come something just like I said I can get through this because there there are some things yeah that I want us to look into you know that we don't we don't take we take for granted but just like taking looking at iniquity you know things there we just we give ourselves reasons to do that we must not be doing with the Spirit of God in our hearts and it's still small voice speaking to us and warning us we think if I was several reason to do things and we are expecting for God to reward us yes he will because he gave the just recompense but you see afar I love this example someone gave this example if I take a dollar and give it to to brother Joseph he works you know and give him a dollar well he would take it for me not really because he don't have a dollar he would take it from him because you know of what he thinks of me praise the Lord of what he thinks of me and another person will also you know what what do I want to do with a dollar praise the Lord and you see that is the way it is is is is is holy God in content praise the Lord the way we take the Word of God amen you'll find people they gave them seven or that was an Old Testament scripture that has the Old Testament thing we are on a grace I mean they gave himself all of this reason why they must not live a holy centerfire life they must not get himself into decency give themself all of the reason why there must not be any church or I have to pay my bills I have to work in I mean you give yourself all of this reason it all goes back to how much the Word of God means to you how much the commandment of God means to you praise the Lord amen how much the commandment of God means to you you know it's I mean itself it's a it's all we think because we him on the way we are may we equate to we quick to idolize people and we also quick to make them a devil its quick to idolize them and we very quick to make them a devil you know but you think about it God will give us grace and we have four runners who have people like our parents you know God would give us grace for us to come in contact with people you know that are older than us they have been serving God even before some of us were born and sometimes we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't learn we'll make use of the resources that God give us that's the reason why he gave us a body with two hands and ten fingers and he gave us ears and all of these things are part of the body for us to benefit from praise the Lord you young people young couples we are living in challenging times amen living in challenging times the future is getting darker getting confusing the only hope we have is this hope that we hold in our heart that he promised never to leave us never to forsake us that he will be with us we hold their hope in our hearts praise the Lord I mean until God can be able to relay to you what you have done that pleases him found something to do find something that you can enjoy doing for the Lord even if it is just enjoying being in church praise the Lord because the scripture says he reward them that diligently seek Him he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him and he gave just recompense praise the Lord and I would leave you like this and what is the Holy Ghost give me for now in the Old Testament when the baby was born the wash to see how it behaves then the father being a great businessman but this time maybe in his 40s or 50 year in half the time to teach his baby himself in them days they didn't have public schools as they have now so they got what they call a tutor or a razor a school teacher and this school teacher was the best he could find so that he did be truthful and tell the father the truth about it and then when this ball got to a certain age say he was mention if that boy was just a renegade no good drink here for the father business all he thought about was filthy and running with women drinking gambling hurts riding that board will always be a son but he was never placed in position which means he was never trusted to have hers to all his father huh but if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business praise Lord amen net net net not an i7 not not trying to behave good when eyes are on him but he was good I mean he was trying to do something get up and face his bed get up and face his own bed don't need to be told amen what's that in a coat oh okay because I'm looking for it I'm trying to see where I read it it but if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business and he proved to be right then they had a ceremony he didn't know about it he didn't know when I mean he just growing up with an interest amen they took the bar out into the street in and and and put a rope on him and they set him up on the scaffold so there the city could see they made a feast and a Jubilee you know Jesus made it seem so beautiful in the story of the prodigal son I close right here and it's so easy it's so easy for us to make the story of the prodigal son me and you praise the Lord this guy that I mean that means serving the Lord and and be doing right I mean he's the he's the one I've been in the house this guy the bachelor and came back he's the prodigal son but you see it was it's all the story of redemption remember there is a part of you that I've always been before the father Jesus says they're angels is always before the Father beholding his face that is the older son the younger one is that part of you that was born in sin shipler in iniquity come to the word speaking lies so in you holds the mystery of the prodigal son yes amazing grace will not sound sweet in your ears for Amazing Grace will sound sweet in your ears you must say I once was lost but now I'm found amen so what happened is when grace found you and make you to know that you are a son and you have a representation before the Father and bring you to the place where now you are taking interest to behave as a song live like a son then God can trust us and he can place us you think about it you think about it the t-phone the cross found the right word to say Amen Joseph in the house of Potiphar on the right were to say just recompense and you hear people even in the room of the church that's not fair that's not fair what is not fair do you know what fair is do you know really what is fair praise the Lord what could have been fair was for God so just wept out of the whole thing but it was still not fair to him praise the Lord it was not fair to him because he had this great plan of redemption in his mind so let's start worrying about what is fair and what is not fair that's not loving God I see for an increased desire to do what is right saying god I leave myself down on the altar if there's anything you mean that is not of equity get it out those things that I'm allowing that I know I'm now supposed to do musicians you can come forth I'm trying to stop myself and I keep finding myself going and if I don't do it I will we'll keep you year-long longer than we want to praise the Lord you know the idea where some people think you know they I just put seven people that needs to be in church just for the church to keep going on every one of you needs to be interred every time there is a service but it just does some choose to to to sacrifice in other things that is hard to give [Music] [Music] [Music] guarding his greatness he had to take the form of falling elements to come and redeem us and bring us back to that place of co-equal Ness because we are we are his attributes we are sons and daughters if we were just had that grace in revelation to know that the way up is down and all we actually do is to just help lift someone up help encourage someone help empower someone [Music] it's not trying to find a big me and a little you but it's we all coming up growing up together to be sons and daughters of God sons and daughters of God that's the highest calling more than a preacher [Music] you [Music] you just think about it how you won at one wrong choice [Music] one wrong choice [Music] and making a choice to do the right thing making a choice to see the right thing give Harry white house sounds back [Music] I can't help but think about many hobby that young lady I told you about in her in her music she wrote called just try there's a line there she says I mean I listened to that just the morning I just wept she said who do I have to blame for myself because the only thing that can handle me is myself see if God can just help us to get ourselves in the right mindset just in the right mindset [Music] some of you have seen the video of pastor Nick he's an Australian passed a bond with our lives how that boy at nine years or try to commit suicide I think now or eleven years old because he just hated himself you know thinking about how he's going to lay he don't have a legs he can be like other boys but you see if if we can learn to face our fear and don't make other people your fear don't make them your problem you are your own problem [Music] because God has been so good to us if we just think about his goodness above all our negative thoughts and negative feelings and just be able to embrace that goodness embrace that mercy and say Lord you have been so good to me it's not just a word as music it's not just a word music it's a feeling it's a melody that goes through your body that's what people can sing and cry people can sing and prophesy people can sing and travel [Music] yes my car Lord I live it up calm and queer this thirsty of my soul [Music] bread of heaven Femi - I know yes my come fill it up and make me whole yes my car I live my life up I live it off ah man queen this desire of my rat of heaven feed me till I want to yes my cup fill it up and make me many of us are just so bored with fear effort of what people would say they're fed up doing wrong and fret up and we just bought of ourself with fear and all fear will do your fear will just limit you from saying God it was limiting you from seeing the possibilities that are before you [Music] and because so fear we have to reduce ourselves to how people want us to live and reduce ourselves to how people what what I want us to do but God has not given us the spirit of fear [Music] [Music] young people just like we said yesterday your calling is a son of God it's a daughter of God and when we learn to put our calling above our ambitions if we learn to put our calling above whatever we want to beat in and whatever we want to be and knowing that is the greatest thing that we can we can be a son of God a daughter of God and Titan and it starts to take joy in the fact that I know I'm a son of God and I know I'm a daughter of God and being proud of it [Music] Heavenly Father Lord and sometimes when we are caught between this line of thoughts trying or God to make a picture out of it can be difficult but we just want to trust you we want to thank you this morning for giving us otter and slaughter father I prayed and that's the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit we take her Godfather the words we have said this
