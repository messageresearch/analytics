I only know [Music] the great [Music] creator. [Music] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. God bless you musicians. That'll be all for now. And uh if we can just have a seat for a moment. God bless you all and it's good to see you all. It's always heartwarming, you know, coming together for a common cause. Praise the Lord. Yeah. Because if a preacher came and there was nobody here, there wouldn't be service. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It would be a very strange thing. If a preacher just walked in and there was nobody, not even a single person, and he just stood there, just started preaching and blasting. That would be very very strange and I hope we never get there because if we ever get there then that would mean all humanity have turned him down. &gt;&gt; Now the worlds have to listen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So but God would always have a people &gt;&gt; after his name. &gt;&gt; So you are all warmly welcome uh in the midst of all the struggles. um the the pressure the pressure of the time we are living in. Uh we still find time that when we know the church doors are opening, we find time to make it into the house of God &gt;&gt; and um our our sacrifices in the Lord would never be a vain. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. So let's keep that in mind as we fight this common cause. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um it was nice seeing brother Ben um yesterday. I know I spoke with him after I spoke with sister um he was in so much pain but uh it was good to see him behind there. &gt;&gt; Uh praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a testament that the Lord our God still heals. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Um I I tried getting Radan. Um it's not been easy getting him. Um but he texted back. Um where he is I think u the network is not it's not as good as it is here. Praise the Lord. He sends his greetings to all of us &gt;&gt; and then um he wants me to let you know um that he appreciates your prayers. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is doing well. &gt;&gt; Yes. So um I didn't see any prayer requests coming. Actually there was one uh from my wife sister Fatu. uh she lost a cousin, a first cousin um under a very I would say strange circumstances and uh that has been happening for some time as she retroed uh she just went to the bathroom and uh they had to go carry her out and that was all. It's just how it tells us how fragile this life is. That is why every day you have is an opportunity to make sure that if there is anything to make right, you are making it right &gt;&gt; because you can never tell what would happen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So she asked prayer. It was so sudden and so unexpected. It's like everybody in the family is down and they are sick. So I would want us to um lift lift lift them up in our prayers tonight before we go to the word and also um just uh pray for the church of the living God. Um we've been here for a while and a lot of the times not a lot of the times some of the times things just happen behind there. uh we don't get to see it inside here. I remember one time a colleague was asking me where is your church? I said it's in Brooklyn Center. And then he goes, "Why of all places the church is in Brooklyn Center?" I said, "What do you mean?" Said, "Brother is the worst place." I said, "Yes, that is where the church is supposed to be because it's the worst place." So God has a reason for keeping this church where it is. We may never get to know everything but um sometimes things happen around there and um I just want us to remember the church. Uh God has been protecting us that God will continue to protect this little group. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I also uh remember the servant of God uh brother one the services are going well that the Lord would use him as his mouthpiece um to to to bless the the saints on the other side of the world. Um shall we just go before the Lord in prayer? our Lord and our Savior Jesus. Once again, your children have gathered. Father, we have gathered at the post of our duty because without anybody in the pew, there wouldn't be service tonight. And Father, we are so grateful that you have granted us grace to come before you tonight. In the course of the week, Father, we may have seen things we're not supposed to see. We may have lent our ears to things we're not supposed to hear. We may have thought of things we're not supposed to think of. We may have gone to places we're not supposed to go. We may have done things we're not supposed to do. In all these, Father, we have inflicted our souls in one way or the other. We have come, Father, for a total cleansing tonight. And we pray, dear Lord Jesus, that you would wash us by the washing of your word and purge us tonight, Father, and deliver us, oh God, from every plan of the enemy. And may you foil every every every evil, Father, the enemy has fashioned against us. and every wall there is in our lives Father which you have not erected. Father we pray may they crumble in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father come oh God and glorify yourself in our midst tonight. Father we want to hear the voice of God. &gt;&gt; It is not in plenty. We just want to hear that still and narrow voice calling out our names tonight and speaking to us. We humbly beseech you father come and take your place in tonight's service because you have made us a promise that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you'll be in their midst and you are here tonight we want to thank you for your servant father. Oh God, we tried getting him, Father, but he's been very difficult because of the poor internet service on the other side, but Father, he texted back. He's doing very well and he sends his greetings. We want to thank you, Father, for his life and for using him, Father, &gt;&gt; to minister unto your people on the other side of the world. We pray that you would grant him utterance. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would use him in any way it pleases thee, Father, to draw the souls of men and women unto thee. And even as we have gathered tonight, Father, we also have needs in one way or the other. And we pray that you meet us exactly, Father, where we have the most need that our coming together would not be in vain. Your daughter, father, sister two has lost a first cousin under a very strange circumstance which almost is becoming a norm because this is the third time this has happened in the same fashion. Father and everybody in the family is kind of broken down. We pray for strength. We pray that you would keep them. We pray that you will deliver them. Bring them out, Father, from that tragedy, Father, from that that storm the enemy has unleashed upon them. And we pray, oh God, go to their rescue and comfort them. Comfort them, Father. You give them comfort. We pray in the name of Jesus. We also want to thank you for this this little assembly. over the time father once in a while things just happen out there we meet people people just walk in and before the service starts they are walking out some walk in and the mid midway the service they are walking out and there are some we even stop in the foyer we don't allow them to come in father you have protected this little assembly and we continue to ask for your divine protection we pray spread your wings upon us father for every single moment we come here. Father, we pray, oh God, that you would hide us in thy most sacred place, even as we fellowship with thee. And Father, we pray tonight, Lord, get us out of our comfort zones tonight. Get us out of the shells into thine inner courts tonight. And let us partake of your blessings, Father, in Jesus name. bless our gathering together and let it all be to the glory of your holy name in Jesus name father we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand on our feet for the reading of the word? We are reading from Ecclesiastes 2 4-11. Ecclesiastes 2 4-11. I read, "I made me great works. I builded me houses. I planted me vineyards. I made me gardens and orchards. And I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits. I made me pools of water to water there with the wood that bringeth forth trees. I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all s. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem. also my wisdom remained with me, and whatsoever mine eyes desired, I cut not from them. I withheld not my heart from any joy. For my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my portion of all my labor. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do, and behold, all was vanity, &gt;&gt; and vexation of spirit, and there was none, there was no prophet under the sun. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his word. Shall we be seated? &gt;&gt; What we have read tonight sounds like the life of a wonderful person, a very successful life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. for a team tonight for the little study we have. I have titled it the ultimate duty of man. The ultimate duty of man. Now what does the word ultimate mean? We're talking about the ultimate duty. We all have duty towards God. What is the ultimate? The word ultimate means the final or fundamental fact of principle. To break it further down, it is the final or the fundamental. In other words, it forms the necessary core of central importance. Is the most important piece. The most important piece. And it is so important that when you take it out, there is nothing left. When you take that piece out, you have nothing left. It's just like fire. We know fire burns. Fire has heat. When you take the heat out of fire, it is not fire. It's no longer fire. It is something else but fire. So we are talking about the ultimate duty of a man. Have that at the back of your mind as we travel together tonight. The Bible is saying that all is vanity. Now what is vanity? Vanity means a quality of being worthless or futile. It is worthless. Wordless means worthless. It is good for nothing. It is useless. It is hopeless. It doesn't count to begin with. It holds no value. In other words, no matter what achievement it is, it is simply what? Empty. Is what? Empty. Praise the Lord. That is what the word vanity means. Now to sum it all up, we are talking about a man that was rich in everything, whose fame traveled the whole world. It hit all the four corners of the earth. If you talk of popularity, he was more than popular. He was rich in gold and in diamonds, in silver. He had cattle. He has sheep, men servants, made servants. And he himself has said in his word, anything he wanted, he got it. Married to 300 wives, 700 concubines, a thousand in all. He had it all. This does not sound like the life of somebody that was struggling. It doesn't sound like the life of a loser. Somebody that was trying to get ends to meet. No, &gt;&gt; this was somebody that had it all. &gt;&gt; I believe there were days that some of his wife even wives even got so disappointed. Thousand. I mean, how do you even tell who they are? And then maybe he miss somebody. Oh, what a beautiful lady. Where does she come from? is your number 37. Oh, and the woman maybe didn't get so disappointed. I mean, he had it all. Think of it. And then a man like this would come and tell you that everything, everything, all the gold, all the diamonds, all the silver, all the fame, the wisdom, all he had was nothing but an empty pride, empty achievement. It was worthless. It was useless. It didn't count. It didn't matter. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Ecclesiastes 12 6 to8 12 6 to8 I read all ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the picture be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the system. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, sayeth the preacher, all is vanity. Now verse seven, just got verse seven. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. Now, a short while ago, we're just talking about my wife uh the first cousin, how he she lost they lost her just suddenly suddenly without warning. Just last week, Wednesday, we have all students association something on how do they call it YouTube, not YouTube on our WhatsApp. and I just went therely enough to see people communicating. I don't post anything. Um then I was just following and they said this is the worst this group has seen for years. And then somebody says what is it? He said no I can't say it. He said no you better say it now. If you don't say it then when else and then he spilled it out. He said there is a helicopter crash and there are actually five uh lawmakers, highprofile citizens on that helicopter with three soldiers and they all perished. And then uh there was somebody we knew actually he was a classmate. And then you wonder that when they got up that morning, &gt;&gt; they bid their families goodbye and said, "You know what? I am going to Abasi." That was the village they were going to and I'll be back. And then only to hear that, oh, they went and they never came back. &gt;&gt; There was somebody that entered. Somebody entered the minister of interior and the the finance minister came just say you you can't go come down. He said I have to be there. No, you can't go. There is a meeting and I need you to be in that meeting. Then he came down. &gt;&gt; There was somebody that did not tell his family he was traveling. He said, "I am going to the office &gt;&gt; and I'll be back as usual." And then he just went and stood by the helicopter to say goodbye to them. When this person dropped, he said, "Oh, if there is a space there, why don't I go with you?" And then he stepped in. This life is very very fragile. We spend all our time. We spend all our resources. We spend day and night. I am not saying work is bad. No, work is good. I am not saying money is bad. It's the love of it that we have a problem with. &gt;&gt; Now we spend all our time, all our years chasing for things that do not matter. Things that don't benefit our souls. Things that are worthless, they are completely useless. And the things that matter the most, we leave them undone. We chase the shadows of life. Every shadow we see, we are chasing it, hoping to catch the real thing. But the real thing will never catch it. We are just racing with the shadow. And the most important thing, the most important thing, I don't want to go ahead of myself. We leave it undone. You don't know when it will be the last day. Nobody here knows. Like somebody said, I'm not afraid to die, but it is the method of the death that I'm afraid of. While there is life, while we are enjoying the grace of God, while we are still here, we are still in our sanity. Let us get close. Let us get close to the Lord our God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because as we have read tonight, it is all what? Vanity. It's all vanity. Now verse 13. Verse 13. Verse 13. 123. Now let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. The conclusion. Fear God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole duty of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear God &gt;&gt; and keep his commandments. This is the whole duty of man. The reason why God sent his only begotten son to come and die for you and me is so we have the fear of God and keep the commandments of God. The reason why God has sent his Holy Ghost, the comforter to lead us in the way is to have the fear of God and keep his commandments. The reason why God has kept you and me alive, we should have been dead. I don't know about you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I should have been dead long ago. If I have to put pen to paper, I can probably list up to 12 times. Up to 12 times, not less. I have said it time and again. &gt;&gt; It wasn't as if I got close to death, but I was right in it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe God has done same for every one of us here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason why God has kept you and me alive until this day &gt;&gt; is because he wants us to keep his word. &gt;&gt; Keep the word. Have the fear of God in you. There are people can look at you. There are people who say there is no God. There are people who say there are no Christians anymore. They can look at your lives and they can see Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the light of the word shine through you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The reason why God has delighted in you and me is so would have the fear of God in us &gt;&gt; and keep his word. If you are going to school, go to school. School is good. If you are working, work hard. work is good. Whatever you are doing, so long as it does not contradict the word of God, it is good. Do it. But remember, remember that all is validity one day we are going to leave them all here and we are going to go. We need to pray for the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; The wisdom of God would make you to number your days. &gt;&gt; It makes you apply your heart onto wisdom. The wisdom of God. It doesn't mean if you are numbering your days, it doesn't mean you're going to die tomorrow. If you're going to be 100 years, you'll be 100 years. But what it means is that it helps you check your life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you know that tomorrow is not guaranteed. &gt;&gt; We can talk about today. We can talk about yesterday. Nobody knows what tomorrow holds. We need the wisdom of God because everything we are chasing for, everything we are running for, everything we are struggling for, everything we are toiling for, all the days we have sleepless nights over, &gt;&gt; they are all what? Useless. The conclusion of the whole matter, fear God and keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; That is the only thing &gt;&gt; that matters. Now the fear of God is to keep his commandments. The fear of God is to keep his commandments. And keeping his commandments shows how much of the fear of God you have in you. In the message the message of grace 1961 0827 the grace of God reached over in Noah's time. Noah just an ordinary man he and his family. But because Noah feared God he believed God. The fear of God would make you to believe God. The fear of God would make you to keep the commandments of God. You can't fear God without believing. How can you fear something you don't believe? You've got to fear God. Solomon said, "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." Now just to fear God, you are beginning to have wisdom. &gt;&gt; The fear of God. Noah feared the Lord and he believed the Lord and that and that's what God honors is your faith in him. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the fear of God would constrain you to believe in God. And if you believe in God, you would fear God. &gt;&gt; Respects the message 1961 1015e. The prophet of God said over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the 13th verse, it is written like this. See, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. &gt;&gt; Fear God and keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this is the full duty of men. The conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God. And you cannot have respect until you have fear. You've got to have fear of God. Solomon said also in the proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Now that don't mean that you are afraid of God. But that means that you are giving him respect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And reverence. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when you respect God, you fear God. &gt;&gt; You fear that you might displease him in some way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You fear lest you would do something wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you constantly are checking your life. &gt;&gt; You just look at yourself or you get home and you ask yourself, "How did I behave today?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; At work, &gt;&gt; before my colleagues, at school, &gt;&gt; in the mall, &gt;&gt; because eyes are watching, &gt;&gt; people are looking at you. You are influencing lives &gt;&gt; but you don't know about it. &gt;&gt; If somebody should tell you that you are an influence probably that would help you but often times they don't tell you. &gt;&gt; All they do is watch. All they do is observe &gt;&gt; and you can either influence them in a good way or in a bad way. You are constantly checking your life. I fear my mother. The prophet speaking. I fear my wife. I fear my church. I fear all the all all of God's servants. Unless I should put a stumbling block &gt;&gt; somewhere in their way. &gt;&gt; I fear the people. I fear the people of the city. Unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian. See, before you can have respect, you've got to have fear. And God demands it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God demands it. &gt;&gt; He demands respect. God does. He demands it and fear brings it. And we know that fear brings respect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the fear of God as the prayer of God is saying would make you to respect God. &gt;&gt; And if you respect God, you would fear him. If the fear of God is being reverent or respectful to God, what does that mean? What does that mean? To be reverent or to be respectful to God. What does that mean? Does it mean just coming to church, fold your arms, sit down, you can't even shout and sing and praise the Lord, sit down quietly? or you walk sanimoniously. You can't even step on an ant. I mean, what does it mean to have respect for God? The fear of God would make you to keep the commandment of God. Now, you can't be disobedient to his commandment and be respectful to him at the same time. &gt;&gt; No. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Keeping the commandments of God is not keeping the law. &gt;&gt; It is not keeping the law. The law came by Moses to Israel. And there were so many men that could keep the law. They dreaded the law. The law, if the law was good, Christ would not have come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The law doesn't mean keeping the law is not keeping having the fear of God in you or keeping the commandments of God is completely different as we are going to see here in in in a jify. The law came by Moses but grace that came our way through Christ Jesus our Lord. Under the law, you were the main focus. &gt;&gt; The law &gt;&gt; dealt with works. Your ability &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Your ability to stay away from trouble, your ability not to go against the law. It's like we have lost in Minnesota. Don't go over, let's say, 30 miles on this road. You have a car that can go 200 miles per hour. How do you control yourself behind the steering wheel? Stealing is an offense. You walk into a store, you see something you like, you don't have the money and there's nobody looking and you know you can take this in and get away with it and nobody will see it but you have that self-control that dignity at least &gt;&gt; to say no I will not do it because it is not right. It is works under the law. Man was the main focus. Your ability, your work, your works. But under grace, Christ is the main focus. That is what grace has given us. under grace. Christ is the main focus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the law brings you to the letter. The Bible says the &gt;&gt; letter &gt;&gt; and that is what the law brings you to &gt;&gt; but grace brings you to the spirit of Christ and the Bible says the spirit gives life under the law a man is rewarded for his works but under grace it is God's righteousness imputed &gt;&gt; to a man because he has believed under grace. Our works are as filthy rags in the sight of the father. They simply stink. The law depends on works. In other words, what you can do, your personal righteousness, which is your ability to keep the word, but grace gives you his righteousness because God knows we can't keep the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No man. And the people dreaded the law because there were things you could do and you be stoned to death. So they were not keeping the law because they liked it. They kept the law out of fear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And fear does not serve God. The law looks at where you fail. That is what the law does. It looks at where you fell. But grace looks at where you stood back on your feet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The law takes record of wrongs, but grace &gt;&gt; gives you a clean slate. &gt;&gt; That you never did it to begin with. &gt;&gt; But the Lord would list them. You did them 70 times. Seven times. We have the record. But under grace the blood wipes the slate clean &gt;&gt; that the father looks at it says I don't see anything. &gt;&gt; That is what grace has done for you and me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Our brother preached talking about who was standing the gap on Wednesday. I've continued also on Sunday. Yes. Under the law, we were condemned to death. For the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; And all of us were as good as dead. &gt;&gt; But grace brought somebody &gt;&gt; who stood in the gap for you and me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That he gave his life as a ransom. &gt;&gt; He paid a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. a price we could never pay. &gt;&gt; He paid the price &gt;&gt; to set us free. &gt;&gt; We are not bound by the law. &gt;&gt; We are a free people. &gt;&gt; Grace has set us free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just a wonderful thing to be a son and a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest commandment?" And he said, "Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thine soul, and with all thine mind." And the second is like unto it. Love thy neighbor as thyself. He took the law and he broke it down. The dreadfulness of the law. He took it and broke it down into love. Into love. Because the only thing that can serve God &gt;&gt; is love. &gt;&gt; Fear does not serve God. &gt;&gt; If you are serving God because you fear to go to hell, the foundation or the premise is wrong. &gt;&gt; It ought to be a love affair. and love a friend. &gt;&gt; You loving God with all your heart, &gt;&gt; with all your soul, with all your mind, and loving your brother and your sister as you would love yourself. &gt;&gt; It's a love affair. And he said, "On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; On these two commandments. And what are these commandments? &gt;&gt; Love. He was asked, "What are the what's the greatest commandment? &gt;&gt; Love the Lord thy God." And the second is like unto it. Love thy neighbor. And on these two commandments, love for God, love for your neighbor, hangs all the law and the problems. It is only love that can make it in &gt;&gt; because God himself is love. &gt;&gt; Keeping the commandments of God is keeping the word of God. It's no longer in dos and don'ts. You do it out of love. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; It's no longer, oh, I can't do this. It's just love. It becomes a part of your life. &gt;&gt; It is not a burden. It's not burdensome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That what people see as a burden to you &gt;&gt; is joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just a way of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you just live it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get to that place, &gt;&gt; you know you are getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; But when it is still a burden, if it is still a burden, then there's a problem somewhere. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be. You should just be proud who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; You should rejoice in who you are. &gt;&gt; The life you are living. &gt;&gt; You should take joy &gt;&gt; is serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living for the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is loved driven. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have to for it, you will die for it. If you have to die for what you believe, if you have truly believed, you will die for it. What else matters in this life apart from you serving God and doing the will of God which God has brought us here for? What else matters? If I have to tell a lie to live another 100 years, after that 100 years, what else? If I have to cheat to live another 100 years, after that 100 years, what else? &gt;&gt; Life is not about how long you live. &gt;&gt; It's what you do with your life. If I have to live a thousand years, die and go to hell, it will be better for me to live 10 years, die and go to heaven. In this miserable condition &gt;&gt; that we are living in. &gt;&gt; In this miserable condition, the world in its entirety is a miserable place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is because we do not have the eyes to see what is on the other side. Fear has taken a hold of us &gt;&gt; that we put premium on things that do not matter and on things that do not pay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a love affair. It ought to be a love affair. The word is all that matters to you as a son of God or as a daughter of God. For man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. God gave us his word to feed on &gt;&gt; to feed on the word of God. And if you are truly feeding on the word, you would know that there is nothing that compares to it. &gt;&gt; You can just sit down and read your Bible and have such a joy and fulfillment that nothing else compares to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know deep down in you that your soul is satisfied. &gt;&gt; You know it. &gt;&gt; You know it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Heaven and shall pass away. The only thing that would not pass away &gt;&gt; is the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the word is in you, it means you are not passing away. &gt;&gt; The word of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; And if that word is in you, you are eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is in you, if you are living by the word, &gt;&gt; you are an eternal being. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not creatures of time. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we just stepped into this time &gt;&gt; and we are going to step out of it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we are already seated in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; It is not to say we are going to. No, &gt;&gt; we are already &gt;&gt; seated in heavenly places through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't entertain this side attractions. It's like traveling from here to let's say New York and you are driving on the road. You will see a lot of sign bulbs, a lot of diversions, but you always see the sign the road where you are going. You would always see a sign that is leading you that way. You have a choice to divert where you don't want to go. You are holding the steering wheel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes miss the road. &gt;&gt; You don't intend to. &gt;&gt; No man in his right mind will say, "Oh, this is the way. I can see the sign, but you know what? I'm going to take this diversion, so I can just get lost." No. No man does that. &gt;&gt; But sometimes It happens. &gt;&gt; And when it happens, even your GPS will not keep quiet. &gt;&gt; It will tell you make a U-turn. Make a U-turn. Make a U-turn. Till you make that U-turn, it will not stop talking to you. &gt;&gt; And that is how it is. &gt;&gt; When a child of God, when you fall, you will never rest until you come back to life. &gt;&gt; God would never hold his peace. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will never &gt;&gt; hold his peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until you get back in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think this life is about us. No, it's not about you. &gt;&gt; It's more about God than it is about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not even one of God's children is going to get lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care who that person is. I don't care what they are. I don't care what they are doing. If they are a child of God, &gt;&gt; the honors is on God to bring them back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have said a couple of times here &gt;&gt; that I went in a direction and I went so far and so deep &gt;&gt; that I couldn't see my way back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But here I am tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God can never lose any of his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have that at the back of your mind. If that is the only thing you take tonight, &gt;&gt; keep it in your heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is in you, &gt;&gt; you are eternal. Yeah. &gt;&gt; As much as God is, &gt;&gt; it is not you that is eternal. &gt;&gt; But there is an eternal God &gt;&gt; inside there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God told Moses, take off your shoes &gt;&gt; because the ground on which you stand is a holy ground. &gt;&gt; It was not the ground. &gt;&gt; In the 40 years Moses was in that wilderness following the sheep, He probably may have passed there &gt;&gt; five times a year times 40 that's 200 times. &gt;&gt; What changed that day? &gt;&gt; It was because the presence of a holy God &gt;&gt; came down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the presence of a holy God in you &gt;&gt; makes you holy. &gt;&gt; The presence of a holy God in you makes you pure. Amen. &gt;&gt; The presence of a holy God in you makes you righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An eternal God in you makes you eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the word that is eternal, not you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And heaven and earth shall pass away. &gt;&gt; But that word that is in you, &gt;&gt; that word is not passing away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said also. Yes. So now Paul can say it is no longer I that liveth &gt;&gt; but Christ &gt;&gt; that lives in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. When God has taken a hold of that vessel. It is no longer you. is no longer you &gt;&gt; because sometimes you even want to trace back &gt;&gt; to that old you &gt;&gt; and then you can't even find your way out &gt;&gt; because Christ has taken a hold of that life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, it's a good place to be. is a very good place to be. Keep the commandment of God. Let the word of God find an anchoring place in your soul. Let that word keep you. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; The word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Let that word keep you. &gt;&gt; Do not let a day pass by. Don't I don't care how busy you are. I don't care how broke you are. I don't care how tired you are. Do your best. I'm just admonishing you. Don't let a day go by without you seeking the face of God. The only way you and I can overcome &gt;&gt; is to get ourselves buried in the word. &gt;&gt; Live in the word. The word is our protection. &gt;&gt; Once you are in the word, &gt;&gt; there is nothing you have to fear &gt;&gt; because you are in the word and the word is what takes care of you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel of Christ is the power of God onto salvation and that is the word. The word is quick and powerful and we ought to submit ourselves to the word. Be obedient. Be obedient to the word. Live for the word. The Bible says obedience is better than sacrifice. Believe in the word. Sometimes we treat God as if he's a liar. Now, if I told you, "Oh, brother or sister, just go to any car park in Minnesota and then select for yourself the most expensive car, any car of your choice." Are you going to believe me? And then I'm going to pay for it. Will you believe it? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You can't believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm driving a Toyota 4Runner. I thank God for the truck. And I'm telling you to go and take a car of your choice. Any car you want. There must be wrong with this. Something wrong with this brother. You will not do it. I know you will not do it. And if you did it, I'll be surprised. But let somebody like Elan Musk tell you, "Oh buddy, I love you so much. You're a very nice guy. You know what? I'm going to do something good for you. Go anywhere in Minnesota. Go to any car, Lord. Any car you want, take it. &gt;&gt; Just give me the bill." &gt;&gt; That night, you not sleep. &gt;&gt; You will be waiting for daybreak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and you will get to the dealership before they even come. &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody has given you their word. &gt;&gt; Somebody, a man, an ordinary man &gt;&gt; has given you his word. Now if you know the source of a word, it tells you how important that word is. It tells you how powerful that word is. What I may say that wouldn't be powerful. Another person will say the same thing and you will die for it. Why? Because it is coming from a trusted source. And sometimes we treat God as if he is a liar. &gt;&gt; Everything God has said in his word, he has kept it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everything the word of God, the word of God has said has come to pass. &gt;&gt; And those that have not yet come to pass is just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; He spoke this world into existence &gt;&gt; by his word. &gt;&gt; And we treat the word as if it is of no power, &gt;&gt; is of no essence. There is power in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, there was um there was a lady I was trying to get to get that information actually somewhere from the south here in the US. the lady at 19, a lady of color, she was working at um Target. And then this lady entered an elevator. And guess what? In the elevator, there was a Caucasian woman that also entered the elevator. So, two of them. Now, as they were going, the lady looked at her and said, "You're a beautiful black girl." And then she laughed. They said, "Why don't you compete for uh Miss America and go for a beauty pageant? You will win." And then she said, "What is going on?" And not too soon, she reached her floor and left. But before then the lady gave her her number and guess what the lady went into the beauty pageantry. I am not a fan of it. She was giving this information. I think it was at a graduation something to that effect and she was encouraging the people. So let's follow the story. I want us to pick the nugget out of it. So she went for this contest the first year, it didn't work out. She tried it the second year, it didn't work out. She tried it the third year, it didn't work out. The fourth year, the fifth year, it didn't work out. &gt;&gt; And then at this time, she took a phone and she called the woman. Do you remember blah blah blah blah blah? Oh yes, that black beautiful girl, I remember you very well. You told me to go for a beauty pageantry and I went for 5 years. I have not won. The lady said, "Keep going. You win." And they dropped the phone. She went the following year, the sixth year. She didn't win. She won the seventh year and then she won the beauty pageantry for that state and also won the beauty pageantry for the first time in the military. Now this was just a total stranger. &gt;&gt; Yeah. a woman she never knew before that she met in elevator for probably 30 seconds &gt;&gt; who told her something and then she took it and then she just did not work with it for a year. She worked with this for seven years. She never gave up till it came to pass. And then I wonder we have been walking with this God &gt;&gt; for how many years now? &gt;&gt; Some of us for one year, &gt;&gt; some of us for 5 years, some of us for 10 years, some for 20, some for 30 years. And we can't even believe in this God. The way this woman took the word of another stranger, another woman on her elevator, we can't believe in this God. In spite of all the signs, all the wonders, all the goodness of the Lord, &gt;&gt; we have learned so much about God and yet it doesn't look like some of us are getting anywhere. It's like it's like it's like too much confession &gt;&gt; and very little or no experience with God. You want to have an experience with God. &gt;&gt; You want to have a true experience with God. Forget about what any brother says. Forget what about what any sister says. Forget just you want if you have not had that experience with God, you want to be certain &gt;&gt; about it. To be a Christian is an actionable word. It must be seen in you. It must be seen in you. If two strangers can just meet in the course of 30 seconds and that changes the life of somebody. Just think about it. You and me for the years of service we have the years of service we have in the Lord. How far How far should we have gone by now? &gt;&gt; Just look at your life. Search your heart. You know yourself. You know yourself. Search your heart. Ask yourself. How far have I come? How far have I come? How far have I come with the Lord? It's not so much about coming to church. It's good to come to church, but you should be able to get into the word. Your fellowship should be with him. We all need an experience with God. &gt;&gt; The word of God is quick and powerful. There is power in the word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm getting to the close. I mean very I I'll be closing in probably 5 minutes or 10 minutes. So please bear with me. So the word of God is our armor. The word of God is what protects us and takes away fear. Now the devil operates with by fear. &gt;&gt; We all know that &gt;&gt; the devil operates by fear. And the danger of fear is that when you have fear in you, you have actually given the devil &gt;&gt; a seat at the table. &gt;&gt; Because that is the fuel because you see fire fire burns or it rages because it has oxygen. When you take oxygen out of the fire, the fire dies. &gt;&gt; And that is the same way the devil operates on fear. &gt;&gt; When you take fear out, you've taken the devil out. &gt;&gt; But so long as you are harboring fear, you can rebuke the devil. You can bind him. You can cast him out and he'll be sitting down. &gt;&gt; He's not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he oppressed with fear &gt;&gt; and you have it. &gt;&gt; So pretty much you have invited him &gt;&gt; and you can't have God and have Satan at the same time. &gt;&gt; God oppressed by faith. So when fear dominates your life, it's like you put God out. &gt;&gt; You put God out because God and Satan cannot be on the same table at the same time. &gt;&gt; It's either God &gt;&gt; or is Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is what moves God. &gt;&gt; Faith in the word &gt;&gt; is what moves God. &gt;&gt; Fear God &gt;&gt; and keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; For this is the ultimate duty &gt;&gt; of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Having the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, having the faith of God in you, fear should never be our portion. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, when you fear something, it's like you are beckoning it to come. &gt;&gt; That is what fear does. And if you have fear in you, you torment yourself, put yourself under so much pressure and that is no good for for your walk with Christ. And we have not truly known this God. Sometimes we have not truly known this God we are talking about. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you fully come to the realization of this of who this God truly is and who you truly are, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Things will be much different. But as I said a while ago, it's like we talk a lot about him, yet we still have not known him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We talk a lot about him. It's a good thing. That is what our conversation should be about. But we ought to experience this God. We ought to have that experience with this God. We have no reason whatsoever. We have no reason whatsoever to disbelieve in this God. The musicians can come over as we get ready to bring the curtains down. It is not an easy thing to keep the commandments of God. Yes. Because the devil knows what happens when you keep that commandment. And the devil is going to fight you every day of your life to make sure that you lose confidence in that word. And if you lose confidence in the word of God, the word that has come to set you free, the word that has has has prescribed I mean has determined your destiny, the word that keeps you, the word that heals you, &gt;&gt; heals your soul, heals your spirit, heals your body, the word that would carry you out of ear, &gt;&gt; the word that means everything to you when you lose confidence in that word is as good as nothing. The devil is going to make sure that you lose confidence in that word because the devil knows the power there is in the word. That when you submit yourself to the word of God and the word takes a hold of your life and you are really in you mean business with God that your life would never be the same again. and the devil will have no place in your life. [Music] Praise the Lord. The ultimate duty of a man, fear God. Have the fear of God. Fear God and keep his commandments. [Music] And we are not called to an institution of dos and don'ts. No, it's completely a love affair. That whatever you are doing for Christ is out of love. You choosing to walk with him is out of love. It's not because you are expecting him to do something else for you. Out of love. We are not serving God because of our bill tickets. because of some earthly achievements. Of course, there are things we pray for that has nothing to do with our salvation and the Lord does them. But the main thing, what matters most is your soul salvation. If your soul is saved, God can add to it. But if your soul is not saved, it doesn't matter what you have. Solomon says it is what? [Music] It is useless. It is hopeless. It is of no value. It doesn't count. [Music] The only thing that matters is what is going to take you and me out of here. Have the fear of God and keep the commandment of God. Serve God with your whole heart. With your whole heart, with your whole mind. Serve God. Do the best you can for the kingdom of God and for the people of God. He that puts his hand to the plow and turns back is not worthy of me. Praise the Lord. I just want us to go before the Lord in prayer tonight and I want us to talk to God. Praise the Lord. We are not saying it's wrong to work. We are not saying it's wrong to go to school. We are not saying it's wrong to do business or make money. There is nothing wrong with that. But knowing the most fundamental reason why God has brought us here is the most important thing. Praise the Lord. I just want us to pray. Talk to God tonight in your own small way and ask God to help you because we all want to be in the pages of his word. We want to serve God the best we can. We want to keep the word of God. We want to walk according to his word, dress according to his word, speak according to his word. We want to live by the word because God has given us his word to live by. The ultimate duty of a man, fear God and keep his commandments. That is all that matters and that is all we are called to do. Praise the Lord. Shall we pray? Father, we thank you for tonight. We are so grateful, Father, for how far you have brought us. Oh God, we thank you, Father, for speaking to us tonight, Father, according to your word of life. that we are here to serve one purpose and that is to serve you and that the ultimate duty of a man is to fear God and keep his commandments. We can look at the years we have wasted. &gt;&gt; Years we have spent chasing shadows, Lord. Years we have spent doing things that have nothing to do that has nothing to do with our salvation. Nothing to do with the kingdom of God. Father, we pray it tonight, oh Lord God, &gt;&gt; that you have mercy upon us, Father, and may you forgive us, Lord, in all our shortcomings, in all the wasted years, Father, we pray for mercy. Have mercy upon us, Father. &gt;&gt; Forgive us, oh God, and help us. &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. &gt;&gt; We pray this tonight in the name of Jesus. Do not let our walk with you, Father, be in vain. We have come this far because there is something in us that is drawing us this way. And Father, we need a true experience with you, Father. We know that coming to church is just not enough. &gt;&gt; We need to have that true experience with you. And we pray in the name of Jesus that you would grant it to us according to the multitude of your grace and your presence. Oh God, &gt;&gt; help us, Father. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; This life is so fragile. &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life, Father, &gt;&gt; worth dying for. our only &gt;&gt; and we pray oh God &gt;&gt; that you will teach us wisdom &gt;&gt; teach us wisdom help us fatherus [Music] &gt;&gt; for we need you Lord we need you &gt;&gt; more than ever beforeus &gt;&gt; time is closing in on us &gt;&gt; on every side Lord &gt;&gt; we We are looking up today from whom our help comes. Father, &gt;&gt; for our help does not come from men, our help comes from you and from you alone. &gt;&gt; We pray thee, Father, tonight. Do not let us depart &gt;&gt; from your word of life. Help us to live by it, Lord. Father, we are so grateful tonight. &gt;&gt; We are so grateful. Thank you so much and praise be to thee. &gt;&gt; For a time of fellowship, Father, we have had together. Thank you, Father. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. Father we thank you for bringing this service to an end tonight.
