[48:59] give you a

[49:09] that that is around us amen where Israel
[49:13] is becoming a a burdens some
[49:15] Stone uh to to the
[49:18] word praise the Lord so let's read uh uh

[49:30] one the burden of the word of the Lord
[49:34] for
[49:36] Israel say the Lord which stretcheth
[49:39] forth the heavens and layth the
[49:41] foundation of the earth and forth the
[49:44] spirit of man within him behold I will
[49:47] make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto
[49:52] all the people round about when and they
[49:56] shall be in The Siege both against Judah
[50:00] and against
[50:02] Jerusalem and in that day will I make
[50:06] Jerusalem a burdensome a burdensome
[50:09] stone for all people all that burden
[50:14] them themselves with it shall be cut in
[50:17] pieces though all the people of the

[50:23] in that day said the Lord I will smart
[50:26] every rehears that uh uh with
[50:29] astonishment and his rather with Madness
[50:32] and I will open my eyes upon the house
[50:36] of Judah and will smart every h of the
[50:39] people with blindness let's bow our
[50:42] hands together and pray Heavenly Father
[50:45] Lord
[50:47] Jesus these words Lord was spoken by the
[50:50] prophet Zacharias hundreds of years ago
[50:55] and the Lord father we are living in a
[50:58] period of Time Lord when we are
[51:01] seeing that Lord
[51:05] uh Jerusalem is becoming a cup of
[51:09] trembling and father we see everything
[51:12] that is happening in the Middle East
[51:14] Lord father it's not a fairy tale it's
[51:18] not a fairy tale
[51:19] Lord lives has been
[51:23] lost babies
[51:26] the
[51:28] eding father we just want to pray
[51:32] tonight Lord as
[51:34] David has requested that we pray for
[51:37] Jerusalem the Peace of
[51:39] Jerusalem and father so we we stand with
[51:42] with your with your word and with your
[51:44] people tonight and say oh God bring
[51:48] peace to your people father but just
[51:52] like the prophet Zachariah said
[51:55] they are burdened with the word of the
[51:59] Lord what is happening is not their
[52:02] choice listening to a young Israeli
[52:05] woman she says I don't want to be
[52:07] wearing this jacket I don't want to be
[52:09] carrying an
[52:11] arm but I have to stand for my
[52:14] land and Lord God you have placed that
[52:17] burden upon
[52:20] them the prophet said is the burden of
[52:23] the word of the Lord
[52:26] upon
[52:27] Israel and that's the same thing tonight
[52:30] Lord we as your children your redeem the
[52:33] Bride of Jesus Christ we are also
[52:35] burdened Father we have our burden
[52:40] Lord father is for a
[52:42] rapture we are burden Lord God for your
[52:46] soon coming Kingdom Lord we are burden
[52:49] Lord to go back to Eden Lord
[52:52] father Lord Jesus we just want to ask
[52:56] tonight oh God you are the one that said
[52:59] in your word come unto me all you that
[53:04] labor and have heavy
[53:07] lading and I will give you rest father

[53:13] want to find rest in your word we want
[53:16] to find comfort in your word father
[53:19] speak to us the few minutes that is
[53:21] before us may something be said of
[53:24] internal value you there will be a
[53:27] blessing tonight we love you we
[53:29] appreciate you father once again Lord
[53:32] Jesus we pray lifting up all of our kns
[53:36] in your
[53:37] hands all of our needs in your hands
[53:39] Lord the thans oh God that are so heavy
[53:42] for our lips to alter for our hearts cry
[53:46] to you we say oh
[53:49] God yeah our prayer tonight bless your
[53:52] children father in Jesus name we pray
[53:57] amen amen the Lord bless you you may
[53:59] have your
[54:03] seat I I would not go actually in the
[54:06] direction that I spoke on uh Sunday uh
[54:10] uh we had a privilege to close the the
[54:12] meetings
[54:16] there praise the
[54:18] Lord and we we certainly had a good
[54:24] service
[54:25] now you will realize that this
[54:29] statement uh uh that Zachariah used
[54:32] verse
[54:33] one the burden of the word of the Lord
[54:37] for Israel this is uh the second time he
[54:40] used that is in Malachi chapter 1 and I
[54:44] will I will come to that in the
[54:46] future uh uh I will come to that in the
[54:49] future because uh
[54:52] uh I'm inspired by that phrase the
[54:55] burden of the word of the Lord and uh uh
[54:59] I will come to that in the future but
[55:01] tonight we will we just go over some few
[55:05] things here and uh uh during the
[55:09] meetings most of the brothers were
[55:11] making comment about Jerusalem and about
[55:14] Israel so I was studying the night I was
[55:17] actually actually preaching the message
[55:19] uh uh uh a burden for change something I
[55:23] spoke here a long time ago go a burden
[55:26] for change so I was actually steuding on
[55:28] the word burden I was looking at the
[55:31] word
[55:33] burden now that word it has a root
[55:37] meaning there some some very deep root
[55:40] meaning and and as I was looking at it
[55:43] it was it was uh
[55:50] uh generally we know that uh burden is
[55:54] it speaks of L Lord and uh
[55:58] uh one of one of the meaning here I
[56:01] think this I think this one should be
[56:03] from the Hebrew it says uh uplifting to
[56:07] that which the soul lift itself
[56:11] up and uh it could also means tribute
[56:15] and now it has this Al this this meaning
[56:18] also that means
[56:20] utterance you know utterance when you
[56:23] when you speak out and that is the
[56:25] reason why it take a truth burden to
[56:29] pray praise the Lord if you are not
[56:32] burden and you go to pray you just get
[56:36] all mixed up it take a truth burden
[56:39] because you you are you are actually
[56:42] altering what is on your heart so it has
[56:46] that meaning also uh of uh of
[56:50] altering oric called
[56:53] burden and uh uh uh when I was looking I
[56:57] was you almost spending the night up
[57:00] just looking at this and meditating on
[57:02] the on the different word you know
[57:05] uh I saw also that uh uh burden has uh a
[57:12] meaning that had to do with uh
[57:16] forgive to
[57:18] Fage to give to go on to help to to hold
[57:24] up
[57:26] uh
[57:29] honorable and uh even even it takes it
[57:33] takes the meaning of
[57:39] marriage up lofted marriage
[57:43] magnified to
[57:47] Pardon and all of that so I was I was
[57:51] looking at that all through the night
[57:52] and uh uh just just getting myself ready
[57:56] and then I started looking through the
[57:58] scripture and then I I started reading
[58:00] this so I got into the channel also of
[58:06] talking about Jerusalem so tonight what
[58:09] we will do we will stay right right in
[58:12] the chapter here that we read and and uh
[58:15] before I spoke I did a little
[58:18] introduction on a cup of trembling so
[58:21] that's what I would like for us to do
[58:23] tonight we will will look at that uh uh
[58:27] the Bible says behold I will make
[58:29] Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all
[58:33] the people round about when they shall
[58:36] be in Siege both against Judah and
[58:40] Israel and in that day I will make
[58:43] Jerusalem a burdens some Stone now you
[58:47] see uh uh
[58:49] uh
[58:51] uh when when we have War events going on
[58:55] and things are happening around the
[58:57] world you know uh every Bible reader and
[59:01] people that are familiar with the
[59:02] scripture we run strictly to the Bible
[59:04] we start to look for prophecy you know
[59:07] is this the Fulfillment of this is you
[59:09] know is this what is coming to pass
[59:12] sometimes people do it out of fear
[59:14] sometimes people do it uh uh you know
[59:17] out of uh curiosity you know wanting to
[59:20] see the because it's a beautiful thing
[59:22] to be able to see the word coming to
[59:24] pass pass Amen to see the word of God
[59:27] coming to pass which of course every day
[59:29] if we open our eyes and look at the
[59:31] things around us will realize that
[59:34] scripture is being fulfilled every day
[59:37] praise the Lord Every Day scripture is
[59:40] being
[59:41] fulfilled amen so uh uh uh and then you
[59:46] you will find uh you know uh all the the
[59:49] different YouTube channel and YouTube
[59:52] preachers and everybody is getting it
[59:54] around jerus
[59:55] and you know and and everybody but we
[59:57] have to
[59:59] realize as we reminded the church there
[1:00:02] we have to realize that uh uh uh uh when
[1:00:06] when Jerusalem when Israel is having a
[1:00:10] political disturbance that's that's what
[1:00:14] brother B Because if you look in
[1:00:16] Leviticus you will realize that uh
[1:00:19] Israel was always gathered by a trumpet
[1:00:25] when something was happening they will
[1:00:27] blow a trumpet well if it was a feast or
[1:00:30] it was for war they had different
[1:00:32] trumpet so they will blow the trumpet
[1:00:34] and the people will gather together to
[1:00:37] be able to deal with what is happening
[1:00:40] so over over the the the years uh you
[1:00:44] realize that God has always used
[1:00:48] political disturbance to gather Israel
[1:00:52] together praise the Lord amen he have
[1:00:56] always used political disturbance so
[1:00:59] political disturbance uh uh uh has been
[1:01:02] uh you know brother bam taught us that
[1:01:04] it's a trumpet that gather Israel
[1:01:07] together and and and even with what is
[1:01:10] going on there now I mean there are a
[1:01:12] lot of uh uh you know uh hundreds of uh
[1:01:16] uh Jewish recruits have been called
[1:01:18] together PE uh Jewish men are flying
[1:01:20] back to the Homeland to go and defend
[1:01:23] their Homeland praise the Lord amen so
[1:01:27] whenever you see that uh uh uh uh but we
[1:01:32] realize also for us the church for us
[1:01:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ uh uh what
[1:01:40] gather us is religious
[1:01:44] disturbance spiritual
[1:01:47] disturbance when we are having things
[1:01:49] that are happening around our life
[1:01:52] around our family it is it is also a
[1:01:56] call for us to come back to our homeland
[1:01:59] which is the word of
[1:02:01] God praise the
[1:02:04] Lord so God will allow things in our
[1:02:08] lives or things around us just to be
[1:02:11] able to grab our attention so uh we we
[1:02:14] cannot lose our
[1:02:15] Focus amen are we
[1:02:18] together now and with Israel being a
[1:02:22] type of the church when they are going
[1:02:25] through those things we can look at what
[1:02:27] is happening in the
[1:02:29] physical and then we think about ourself
[1:02:32] in the spiritual yeah praise the Lord so
[1:02:36] I I just thinking about that and and and
[1:02:39] looking through the different news field
[1:02:42] and and and you know uh and and hearing
[1:02:44] some of the report of of of all the
[1:02:47] atrocities that is that is taking place
[1:02:50] there I think in my
[1:02:52] mind that's the same same thing that is
[1:02:55] happening
[1:02:58] spiritually praise the
[1:03:00] Lord that's the same thing that is
[1:03:02] happening
[1:03:04] spiritually they are having a a physical
[1:03:07] effect and we are having a spiritual
[1:03:14] effect people are getting call on God
[1:03:17] and people are backsliding man Hearts is
[1:03:20] turning away from the Lord and and and
[1:03:22] and all of that
[1:03:25] praise the Lord
[1:03:26] amen so you see it's so it's so easy and
[1:03:30] and just like I said those those are
[1:03:32] real things that are happening is is now
[1:03:34] moving is now
[1:03:38] makeup entire families have been blown
[1:03:41] is is is blown out they are caught under
[1:03:43] the
[1:03:46] robels praise the Lord listen to a uh uh
[1:03:50] uh uh a report of uh uh uh uh uh twins
[1:03:56] babies their their their parents were
[1:03:58] killed and they were left in the home uh
[1:04:00] uh uh you know by thems for for hours I
[1:04:03] almost 16 hours by
[1:04:10] themsel Praise the Lord now you can look
[1:04:14] at all of those uh uh uh you know uh uh
[1:04:19] reporting all of those things and and
[1:04:22] and and as hmon we we we we feel sorry
[1:04:25] that those things are
[1:04:27] happening but uh just like the prophet
[1:04:30] said yet and we read uh over here from
[1:04:33] Zacharias this is the burden of the word
[1:04:36] of the
[1:04:38] Lord God has placed his word on those
[1:04:42] people as his people praise the Lord and
[1:04:47] he said he's going to make make them a
[1:04:49] cup of trembling now so what I did was
[1:04:53] that U uh I decided to go back and uh
[1:04:57] and and and look at types or through uh
[1:05:01] the scripture uh it's Wednesday night I
[1:05:04] won't keep you too long and uh so uh I
[1:05:07] went and look back and and and just look
[1:05:09] at tipes through the scripture you know
[1:05:12] uh uh David said my cup runneth
[1:05:17] over praise the Lord you find in the
[1:05:20] psalm where David talks about uh uh uh
[1:05:24] uh thy cup of
[1:05:26] Salvation you know he he he uh he he
[1:05:30] talks about all of this you know so we
[1:05:34] find out that uh if you if if we go back
[1:05:37] the first time you you'll realize this
[1:05:39] is used is in Genesis chapter
[1:05:43] 14 and it brings us to the story of
[1:05:47] Joseph being in
[1:05:51] prison praise the Lord amen amen amen
[1:05:54] amen you'll find Joseph being in
[1:05:59] praison and uh uh uh this is this is
[1:06:03] over in the King James if you do a
[1:06:05] search in the King James and you you use
[1:06:09] the uh you search the word cup that's
[1:06:12] the first scripture that will show but I
[1:06:15] was looking through another uh reference
[1:06:18] Bible and the first time cup was show
[1:06:22] was when Abraham was into entertaining
[1:06:24] the
[1:06:27] Angels praise the Lord amen when when
[1:06:30] Abraham was entertaining the angels that
[1:06:33] reference put it in the sense that
[1:06:35] Abraham told Sarah to give them a cup of
[1:06:38] milk Jesus says not even a cup of water
[1:06:43] will go without being
[1:06:47] reward praise the Lord you you you think
[1:06:50] about that you hear that it sounds uh
[1:06:52] you know something that is is very uh uh
[1:06:56] uh you know common we say it all the
[1:06:59] time it sounds so common to us but you
[1:07:02] know uh uh the word of God is the Deep
[1:07:05] Thoughts of God yes amen these
[1:07:11] words uh have just been pulled out to
[1:07:14] give us an idea what was in God's
[1:07:19] mind praise the Lord so let's let's show
[1:07:23] a littleit on a type how God play out
[1:07:27] the cup of
[1:07:30] trembling say he's telling uh isra by
[1:07:34] the prophet Zacharias you also check in
[1:07:36] the book of Isaiah you will also see
[1:07:38] that you know uh uh uh Isaiah also
[1:07:42] prophesied that there will be the cup of
[1:07:44] trembling you know so uh uh but then if
[1:07:47] you if you look at it and look at the
[1:07:49] types you will realize that here is
[1:07:53] Joseph in prais
[1:07:55] him God has told
[1:07:58] Abraham Genesis chapter 15 your seed is
[1:08:02] going to sojourn into a Strange
[1:08:05] Land and after 400 years I will come
[1:08:09] down and I will bring them out I will
[1:08:12] bring them to this very land where you
[1:08:14] are as a stranger which is the land of
[1:08:17] Canaan I will bring them here this is
[1:08:19] their
[1:08:20] land but before I bring them back to
[1:08:23] their land they will so join they will
[1:08:25] they will go go away praise the Lord
[1:08:30] hallelujah now we see INF fulfillment of
[1:08:34] that uh of that scripture now God has
[1:08:37] spoken so when God speaks his word
[1:08:41] becomes a
[1:08:44] burden that's right the prophet says the
[1:08:48] burden the
[1:08:51] burden of the word of the Lord
[1:08:55] so God's word now becomes a
[1:08:58] burden for that prophecy to come to
[1:09:03] pass the sons of Jacob had to sell their
[1:09:09] brother praise the Lord because that
[1:09:12] word can never fail it must come to pass

[1:10:05] will not do the wrong thing and sleep in
[1:10:07] peace right why because you are under a
[1:10:10] burden to be a church without spot or
[1:10:19] wrinkle are we
[1:10:21] together am so he went away and he's
[1:10:24] there and uh uh these people are
[1:10:27] speaking the Egyptian language is
[1:10:28] sounding to him just like uh something
[1:10:35] different praise the Lord now God have
[1:10:39] said your seed was so drawn in a Strange
[1:10:41] Land to Joseph it was not that
[1:10:46] prophecy to Joseph what have I done to
[1:10:49] my
[1:10:52] brothers to him he he's he's feeling
[1:10:55] rejected why why do they hate
[1:10:58] me praise the
[1:11:01] Lord
[1:11:03] amen now God is going to keep him there
[1:11:07] and Grant him favor because the word of
[1:11:09] God should come to pass so God will
[1:11:12] grant him favor and then he will he uh
[1:11:15] in in for for for some reason uh pipy
[1:11:18] will love this boy and bring him over to
[1:11:21] his house you have to know that pipy was
[1:11:23] was was uh he was he was he was a high
[1:11:25] Commander amen he was a big man in the
[1:11:29] Egyptian uh Army so uh uh cleric or Army
[1:11:34] whichever his position was now he will
[1:11:37] he will love Joseph he will bring Joseph
[1:11:39] home and he would for some reason he
[1:11:42] would just trust this boy the Bible says
[1:11:45] everything that was in his house beside
[1:11:47] his
[1:11:48] wife he put everything on Joseph on no
[1:11:53] doubt they they they they they tried to
[1:11:56] trap him no doubt they tempted him no
[1:11:59] doubt they wanted to see if he was
[1:12:01] expired no doubt they did
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] everything but the burden of the word of
[1:12:09] the Lord kept him faithful yes sir it
[1:12:12] was not himself it was the burden of the
[1:12:15] word of the Lord that kept him faithful
[1:12:19] it's the burden of the word of Malachi 4
[1:12:22] that will keep you Faithful
[1:12:24] thank it's not your religious upbringing
[1:12:28] it's not how much you prayed or how much
[1:12:30] is because God has spoken by his Prophet
[1:12:33] that there will be a
[1:12:35] bride
[1:12:38] Hallelujah so the burden of the word of
[1:12:41] the Lord kept him
[1:12:43] faithful thank you
[1:12:45] Lord and so much that when py wife
[1:12:49] thought she had an occasion to Define
[1:12:53] this young boy she realized that he was
[1:12:56] a virgin and she wanted to defile him
[1:13:00] praise the
[1:13:02] Lord now you have you have to read
[1:13:04] between the line this man is a senior
[1:13:08] officer of the land of Egypt for Joseph
[1:13:12] to be pulled into the
[1:13:16] dungeon he was charged with capital
[1:13:21] punishment praise the Lord amen if he
[1:13:24] was guilty he was supposed to be
[1:13:27] executed they were not supposed to
[1:13:30] imprison
[1:13:32] him the reason why Joseph was impr
[1:13:35] praising is because Pipi did not believe
[1:13:38] his
[1:13:43] wife if it was true that Joseph
[1:13:48] attempted that it was not a case to
[1:13:50] Jorge this is a foreigner yeah
[1:13:54] he was going to be
[1:13:56] executed
[1:14:00] amen praise the Lord but once again the
[1:14:03] burden of the word of the Lord Pro
[1:14:06] itself faithful yes sir than
[1:14:10] Jesus
[1:14:12] GL and Joseph is put into prais him oh
[1:14:17] Joseph young
[1:14:20] Joseph never enjoyed his say his teenage
[1:14:25] years praise the
[1:14:27] Lord all the fun thing his friends are

[1:14:45] favor with
[1:14:50] God now he's hon this burden is dead in
[1:14:53] praising and uh and uh uh
[1:14:59] uh one good thing that is happening to
[1:15:02] Joseph I think is that he's just
[1:15:06] enjoying the benefit of his
[1:15:09] gifts he's
[1:15:12] dreaming praise the Lord I believe he
[1:15:16] dreamed about his father he dreamed
[1:15:18] about his brothers and he he wake up in
[1:15:22] the morning he real he's in prison oh
[1:15:25] it's a
[1:15:29] dream oh I wonder how they doing and as
[1:15:33] the years would go by and and and and
[1:15:36] and and that that that that that anger
[1:15:39] that that that bitterness the lot of
[1:15:41] question that he had in his
[1:15:45] mind just to realize that he have just
[1:15:49] escaped capital punishment that he could
[1:15:52] be killed
[1:15:54] he beginning to see that
[1:15:56] uh there is
[1:16:00] something he
[1:16:04] remember Jacob told might have told
[1:16:07] him about the God of our fathers yes
[1:16:11] sir praise the Lord
[1:16:19] amen and as time went back we know the
[1:16:22] story there in Praise
[1:16:24] two of
[1:16:28] pharaoh man of his
[1:16:31] house Pharaoh cup Bearer The Butler and

[1:16:46] out communion because that was
[1:16:48] commum the bread and the
[1:16:51] wine okay
[1:16:55] that's the reason why if we don't
[1:16:57] discern the lost's
[1:16:58] body we die
[1:17:05] spiritually so communion is not is not a
[1:17:08] fun
[1:17:09] thing it's something that has its
[1:17:13] spiritual meaning to the church because
[1:17:15] it has its root way back
[1:17:19] there we're not doing communion tonight
[1:17:21] so let's move on
[1:17:24] and uh so y the the the the
[1:17:28] Baker and uh and and and the cup Bearer
[1:17:33] both of them have a dream God allowed
[1:17:35] them to have a
[1:17:37] dream praise the Lord and why they are
[1:17:39] dreaming Joseph is also
[1:17:44] dreaming praise the Lord because he
[1:17:46] didn't not just read their mind to get
[1:17:48] that interpretation God Reve it to him

[1:18:23] had his dream also and and and Joseph
[1:18:26] will interpret the dream to both of them
[1:18:29] in as much as it was hard to tell the
[1:18:32] baker that in 3 days you will be killed
[1:18:36] Joseph had to say
[1:18:40] it because that's the interpretation
[1:18:42] there is just no other way to say it but
[1:18:45] to say that your dream means that in 3
[1:18:48] days you will be
[1:18:51] hanged
[1:18:53] and the cup Bearer Joseph would tell him
[1:18:55] that in three days you will be back in
[1:18:58] the palace now for this men to be put in
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:04] dungeon amen that was that was
[1:19:08] uh how crown prais
[1:19:12] him you read the book of Psalm the Bible
[1:19:14] says there were chains and shackles

[1:19:34] no this was a praising for serious
[1:19:38] criminal almost like a life

[1:20:18] sentence praise the
[1:20:21] Lord oh sometimes we read these things
[1:20:24] we just think that they are Bible

[1:21:04] goodness praise the Lord look he was not
[1:21:08] a
[1:21:11] Believer I don't believe that he
[1:21:13] believed
[1:21:16] Joseph praise the Lord amen because we
[1:21:20] quick to make everybody believer this
[1:21:22] man was not a Believer he was an
[1:21:25] Egyptian he knows the Egyptian
[1:21:29] laws whatever he did was not stated in
[1:21:33] the Scripture it was not important for
[1:21:36] us because what was important for us is
[1:21:40] that we had a life sentence on our
[1:21:44] lives amen we were born in sin shaped in
[1:21:49] iniquity coming to the word speaking
[1:21:51] Lies We we have a life sentence that
[1:21:54] were hanging over us
[1:21:59] right praise the Lord

[1:22:13] myself Lord out of our
[1:22:21] praising
[1:22:24] glory be to

[1:22:35] days you will die to him to I'm already
[1:22:38] dead I'm
[1:22:41] condemned for me it is better let me

[1:22:46] is life in
[1:22:50] prison praise the Lord
[1:22:54] and to the back Joseph was just this
[1:22:57] young man is out of his mind don't give
[1:22:59] me false
[1:23:00] hope praise the
[1:23:02] Lord
[1:23:07] amen but whether he believe it or
[1:23:10] not he he was not burdened with the word
[1:23:13] of the Lord it was Joseph that was
[1:23:15] burdened with the word of the Lord so
[1:23:18] whether he believe it or not the word of
[1:23:20] the Lord will not fail
[1:23:24] Amen in 3 days he's uh he's uh uh uh uh

[1:24:11] back in the presence of pharaoh he will
[1:24:14] be shaken yes
[1:24:17] sir that's were the sense of the cup of
[1:24:21] trembling
[1:24:23] amen he will be shaken back in the
[1:24:33] presence praise the Lord amen because
[1:24:36] the word of the Lord that was given to
[1:24:40] Abraham that Joseph is now burdened with
[1:24:44] is slowly
[1:24:48] unfolding that's what would take Joseph
[1:24:51] out of praising
[1:24:59] praise the
[1:25:00] Lord I believe he goes back and and and
[1:25:03] and right in the morning H Pharaoh just
[1:25:05] call I call his name bring me my tea oh
[1:25:08] my
[1:25:14] God if it is you how you how were you
[1:25:16] going to
[1:25:19] behave praise the Lord I believe this
[1:25:21] guy was sh all over
[1:25:27] himself praise the
[1:25:31] Lord filled with fear and uh uh uh
[1:25:36] excitement everything miess up he even
[1:25:39] forgot that he promised
[1:25:42] Joseph that I'm going to tell the king
[1:25:44] about he forgot completely
[1:25:50] right praise the Lord
[1:25:58] amen now we realize here there's uh uh
[1:26:02] we we we we seeing here
[1:26:04] how uh uh an interpretation of this
[1:26:09] dream now this man will will will will
[1:26:12] later remember Joseph when Pharaoh
[1:26:15] starts to talk his dream that will be
[1:26:17] years down the line praise the Lord when
[1:26:21] Pharaoh starts to talk about his dream
[1:26:25] and then he will remember that there's a
[1:26:27] Hebrew boy that interpreted my dream and
[1:26:30] and and Joseph will be brought out of
[1:26:32] praising praise the
[1:26:35] Lord are we
[1:26:41] together and then we will see it in
[1:26:44] another way now you have to realize
[1:26:47] now in the type in the way I'm bringing
[1:26:50] it to you the the the the cup of
[1:26:53] trembling was not in Joseph
[1:26:58] hands it was in the hands of the Gentile
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:05] Egyptian praise the Lord but it is
[1:27:08] Joseph
[1:27:11] Dream are we
[1:27:14] together it's his
[1:27:17] dream is the gift that he
[1:27:20] had have taken this man out of prison
[1:27:23] and have put him to the place where he
[1:27:25] is now the next time we will see there
[1:27:28] also almost my time is almost gone here
[1:27:31] but I have the rest of the year to
[1:27:33] preach this the next time we will see
[1:27:35] this
[1:27:37] also
[1:27:40] is when Joseph interpretation of pharaoh
[1:27:48] dream the seven
[1:27:50] years there will be be seven years of
[1:27:53] farming there will be seven years of
[1:27:55] surplus before seven years of farming
[1:27:57] Pharaoh all of your your your fat cows
[1:28:00] that you seen in your dream it it
[1:28:03] represent seven years of
[1:28:07] surplus and then right after that seven
[1:28:09] years there will come seven years of
[1:28:15] farming praise the Lord amen for the
[1:28:18] matter of fact the reason why Pharaoh
[1:28:21] believe Joseph is because he could not
[1:28:24] remember his dream he was troubled by
[1:28:26] The Dream but he could not remember
[1:28:31] it praise the Lord amen Joseph dreamed
[1:28:35] his dream and told him his
[1:28:42] dream praise the Lord if this man can
[1:28:45] tell me my dream he definitely have the
[1:28:51] interpretation are we
[1:28:54] together now
[1:28:55] so right there we we know the rest of
[1:28:58] the story Joseph now is put in charge I
[1:29:00] mean if if if you have this
[1:29:02] interpretation if that's what it's going
[1:29:04] to be you are the best man and and by
[1:29:06] that he he rose to be the second man in
[1:29:13] power 7
[1:29:16] years of
[1:29:20] suplus Egypt
[1:29:22] Prosper Egypt Prosper they feel I mean
[1:29:28] Prosper when the seven years of farming
[1:29:32] started they had enough food in
[1:29:35] Pharaoh's
[1:29:37] Storehouse and there was one thing that
[1:29:40] the gift of Joseph
[1:29:42] did what Joseph did was that as the even
[1:29:47] the people in Egypt when they started
[1:29:50] experiencing the farming
[1:29:52] the gift of Joseph honor wisdom and by
[1:29:55] by by uh Divine Direction he made the
[1:29:59] people in
[1:30:01] Egypt Pharaoh owned
[1:30:05] everybody because when the people came
[1:30:08] to ask Joseph for food he says well give
[1:30:10] me your field I'll give you x amount of
[1:30:13] food he give your
[1:30:14] field when that food finish he come he
[1:30:17] says give your
[1:30:19] house when the house finish he say you
[1:30:22] and your family belong to the Pharaoh
[1:30:23] are you
[1:30:25] okay praise the Lord and that's the very
[1:30:28] same thing that our Joseph should do to
[1:30:32] us that everything we have our life our
[1:30:36] family must belong to our king that's
[1:30:39] the same thing our Joseph is doing amise
[1:30:42] the
[1:30:48] Lord that's what our Joseph is doing
[1:30:53] praise the
[1:30:54] Lord that when we have a need and we ask
[1:30:57] him and he Supply that need we must
[1:30:59] surrounder those things to God but what
[1:31:02] happen when he Supply it then we turn
[1:31:05] our back and we think we have the word
[1:31:06] to
[1:31:11] ourself praise the Lord and we gone away
[1:31:14] from God and we G unless we go into
[1:31:17] trouble everybody in Egypt every
[1:31:20] household belong to
[1:31:26] Pharaoh praise the Lord amen Pharaoh
[1:31:29] owns the life of the
[1:31:36] people that's what the gift of our
[1:31:39] Joseph should do to
[1:31:43] us our life our
[1:31:47] health praise the Lord because when we
[1:31:50] get sick who do we go to our
[1:31:52] Joseph yes sir but then when we get well
[1:31:56] we don't have time for Joseph anymore we
[1:31:58] don't know our
[1:32:05] King if we GA the
[1:32:08] Revelation that everything that we have
[1:32:12] even the birth that we
[1:32:15] breathe we owe it to
[1:32:19] him praise the Lord
[1:32:22] amen everything that we
[1:32:26] own that was that was what the gift of
[1:32:29] Joseph did to to Egypt that's the reason
[1:32:32] why the name Joseph was
[1:32:36] reverence the Bible says when Joseph
[1:32:39] traveled down Egyptians
[1:32:42] bow that scripture every knee shall bow
[1:32:45] every tongue shall confess it started
[1:32:48] from
[1:32:50] Egypt
[1:32:57] until There Rose a pharaoh that they
[1:33:00] didn't know
[1:33:01] Joseph that's another
[1:33:04] story praise the Lord
[1:33:08] amen but the whole land the whole word
[1:33:11] the oppressing word at that time was all
[1:33:14] running to Egypt for
[1:33:17] food and Joseph Brothers will come yeah
[1:33:21] to Egypt for
[1:33:24] full the Lord took almost that 14 15
[1:33:28] years to work on
[1:33:30] Joseph to take the hurt and take the
[1:33:34] bitterness and take everything from his
[1:33:37] heart praise the Lord
[1:33:40] amen I believe every night he dream he
[1:33:43] dreamed about his father he dreamed
[1:33:45] about his brothers he's asking question
[1:33:47] in in in his mind ignoring that this
[1:33:50] this this this this family will affect
[1:33:52] the whole world are they going to die
[1:33:55] are they going to come here what's going
[1:33:56] to happen he don't
[1:34:03] know that's the reason why when he saw
[1:34:05] them
[1:34:07] coming when he saw them coming praise
[1:34:11] the Lord why Joseph saw them this is the
[1:34:14] prime minister he's supposed to be lock
[1:34:16] out in his house but he was expecting
[1:34:19] his brothers that's the reason why he
[1:34:22] was in the
[1:34:23] field this was not a worker he don't
[1:34:27] have no reason being in the field but
[1:34:29] the expectation for his brothers every
[1:34:31] day he comes down in the field he
[1:34:33] looking among the foreigners to see if
[1:34:36] he will see his

[1:34:43] Lord when he saw
[1:34:47] them he command the soldier arrest those

[1:39:05] Jesus said if you drink of this cup on
[1:39:08] waterly yes sir you shall be
[1:39:11] guilty of the Lord's

[1:39:54] it it's a cup of
[1:40:00] trembling and these guys put the cup
