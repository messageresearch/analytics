[0:42] and the judge of all
[0:44] the earth he shall be and with equity
[0:46] and perfection will he judge mankind
[0:48] and there will be no evading that
[0:50] judgment no turning of that justice
[0:53] there will be no tempering of it he that
[0:56] is unjust will be unjust still
[0:58] he that is filthy will be filthy still
[1:01] the unchanging one will not change
[1:02] then for he never has and never will
[1:06] those feet of brass will crush the enemy
[1:08] they will destroy the antichrist
[1:10] the beast and the image and all that is
[1:12] vile in his sight
[1:14] he'll destroy the church systems that
[1:16] have taken his name only to corrupt its
[1:18] brilliance and crush them along with the
[1:19] antichrist
[1:21] all the wicked the atheists the
[1:23] agnostics the modernists the liberals
[1:26] will all be there death hell and the
[1:28] grave will be there
[1:30] yes they will for when he comes the
[1:32] books will be opened
[1:34] that is when even the lukewarm church
[1:36] and the five foolish virgins will appear
[1:38] he will separate the sheep from the
[1:40] goats when he comes he will take over
[1:42] the kingdom
[1:43] for it is his and with him will be the
[1:46] thousands
[1:47] times ten thousands his bride who will
[1:49] come to minister to him
[1:51] glory oh it is now or never
[1:54] repent before it is too late wake up
[1:56] from amongst the dead and seek god to be
[1:58] filled with his spirit
[2:00] or you will miss eternal life do it now
[2:03] while there is time
[2:05] for his voice was as the sound of many
[2:08] waters
[2:10] now what do the waters represent hear it
[2:13] in revelation 17
[2:15] 15 the waters which thou sawest
[2:18] are peoples and multitudes and nations
[2:20] and tongues
[2:22] his voice was as the sound of multitude
[2:24] speaking what is it
[2:26] it is the judgment for these are the
[2:28] voices of the multitudes of witnesses
[2:31] who by the holy spirit all through the
[2:32] ages have testified to christ and
[2:34] preached his gospel
[2:36] it will be the voice of every man rising
[2:38] in judgment against the sinner who would
[2:40] not take
[2:40] warning the voices of the seven
[2:43] messengers will be heard loud and clear
[2:45] those faithful preachers who preached
[2:47] the saving power of jesus
[2:49] who preached water baptism in jesus name
[2:51] who preached the infilling and power of
[2:53] the holy ghost
[2:54] who stood with the word more than they
[2:56] stood with their own lives
[2:58] all of them were the voice of jesus
[3:00] christ by the holy ghost down through
[3:02] the ages
[3:03] john 17 20 neither pray i for these
[3:07] alone but for them also which shall
[3:09] believe on me through their word
[3:12] have you ever thought how terrifying it
[3:14] is to a man drifting helplessly toward a
[3:16] cataract
[3:17] think now of that roar as he approaches
[3:19] his sure and certain doom
[3:21] and just exactly like that is coming the
[3:23] day of judgment when the roar of the
[3:25] multitude of voices condemns you for not
[3:27] having paid heed heir it was too late
[3:30] take heed this very hour for at this
[3:32] moment your thoughts are being recorded
[3:34] in heaven
[3:35] there your thoughts speak louder than
[3:36] your words like the pharisee who claimed
[3:39] so much with his mouth but not listening
[3:41] to the lord
[3:42] his heart became corrupt and evil until
[3:44] it was too late
[3:45] even now this could be your last call to
[3:48] hear the word and receive it unto
[3:49] eternal life
[3:51] it will be too late when you approach
[3:52] the roar of the many voices of judgment
[3:54] and doom
[3:56] but have you ever noticed how sweet and
[3:58] relaxing the sound of water can be
[4:01] i like to fish and i like to find a spot
[4:03] where the water is whispering in ripples
[4:06] i can just lie back and hear it speaking
[4:08] peace and joy and contentment to my
[4:10] heart
[4:11] how glad i am to be anchored in the
[4:12] haven of rest where the voice of the
[4:14] lord speaks peace
[4:15] as the word of the waters of separation
[4:17] has declared
[4:19] how thankful we should be to hear his
[4:20] voice of love and care and guidance and
[4:22] protection
[4:24] and someday we will hear that same sweet
[4:26] voice speak
[4:27] not in judgment but in welcome to us
[4:29] whose sins have been remitted by his
[4:31] blood
[4:32] whose lives have been spirit filled and
[4:34] whose walk was in the word
[4:37] what could be more precious than to hear
[4:38] the multitudes of welcoming voices
[4:40] and be surrounded by those multitudes
[4:42] who have believed unto eternal life
[4:45] oh there is nothing like it i pray that
[4:48] you will hear his voice and harden not
[4:50] your heart
[4:50] but receive him as your king oh if you
[4:54] would only see it it was the waters that
[4:56] destroyed the world
[4:58] but it was the same waters that saved
[5:00] noah and also saved the whole earth for
[5:02] noah
[5:03] listen to his voice the voice of his
[5:05] servants as it calls to repentance and
[5:07] life
[5:09] five in his right hand were seven stars
[5:13] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[5:16] now of course we already know from verse
[5:18] 20 what the seven stars actually are
[5:21] and the mystery of the seven stars are
[5:23] the angels messengers of the seven
[5:25] churches
[5:27] now we couldn't make a mistake here on
[5:29] any account as he interprets it for us
[5:31] these seven stars are the messengers to
[5:33] the seven successive church ages
[5:35] they are not called by name they are
[5:38] just set forth as seven
[5:39] one to each age from the ephesian age on
[5:42] down to this laodicean age
[5:44] each messenger brought the message of
[5:46] truth to the people
[5:48] never failing to keep it the word of god
[5:50] to that particular church age
[5:52] each one held to it they were steadfast
[5:55] in their loyalty to the original light
[5:57] as each age pulled away from god his
[6:00] faithful messenger turned that age back
[6:01] to the word
[6:03] their strength was from the lord or they
[6:04] never could have stemmed the tide
[6:06] they were safe in his care for nothing
[6:08] could pluck them out of his hand
[6:10] and neither could anything separate them
[6:12] from the love of god
[6:14] let it be sickness peril nakedness
[6:16] famine
[6:17] sword life or death they were truly
[6:20] yielded to him and kept by his
[6:22] omnipotence
[6:23] they were not concerned about the
[6:24] persecution that came their way
[6:26] pain and derision was but caused to give
[6:28] glory to god
[6:29] but they were counted worthy to suffer
[6:31] for him
[6:32] and in thankfulness for his salvation
[6:35] they burned with the light of his life
[6:36] and reflected his love
[6:38] patience meekness temperance gentleness
[6:41] faithfulness and god backed them up with
[6:44] wonders
[6:45] signs and miracles they were accused of
[6:47] being fanatics and holy rollers
[6:50] they were denounced by organizations and
[6:51] held in mockery
[6:53] but they kept true to the word now it is
[6:56] not hard to stand up and keep true to a
[6:58] creed
[6:59] it is easy for the devil is right behind
[7:01] all that
[7:02] but it is something else to be true to
[7:04] god's word and go back to what the word
[7:06] originally produced after pentecost
[7:10] not long ago a man said to me that the
[7:12] roman catholic church had to be the true
[7:14] church as it had been true to what it
[7:16] believed over all the years
[7:18] and kept on growing and not changing
[7:20] that isn't so at all
[7:22] any church with the government behind it
[7:24] and with its own creed which isn't the
[7:26] word at all
[7:27] and with no manifested ministry to cause
[7:29] the devil to get aroused could surely
[7:31] carry on
[7:32] that was not a criterion but when you
[7:34] think of that little group
[7:36] whose members were saw on asunder fed to
[7:38] lions
[7:39] persecuted and driven from pillar to
[7:41] post and yet stayed true to the word now
[7:44] definitely that would have to be god
[7:47] how they survived their battle of faith
[7:48] and carried on still
[7:50] that is the miracle and this comfort is
[7:54] not for the seven church age messengers
[7:56] only
[7:57] every true believer is in the hand of
[7:58] god and can draw from his love and power
[8:02] and receive the full benefit of all that
[8:03] god is to the believer
[8:05] what god gives the messenger and how he
[8:08] blesses and uses the messenger
[8:10] is an example to all believers of his
[8:12] goodness and care to all members of his
[8:14] body
[8:15] amen 6. the two-edged sword
[8:20] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[8:22] two-edged sword
[8:23] in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is
[8:27] quick and
[8:27] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[8:29] sword piercing even to the dividing
[8:32] asunder of soul and spirit
[8:34] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[8:36] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[8:38] the heart out of his mouth went the
[8:41] sharp two-edged sword which is the word
[8:43] of god
[8:44] revelation 19 11-16
[8:48] and i saw heaven opened and behold a
[8:50] white horse
[8:51] and he that sat upon him was called
[8:53] faithful and true
[8:54] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[8:56] make war
[8:58] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[9:00] his head were many crowns
[9:02] and he had a name written that no man
[9:04] knew but he himself
[9:06] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[9:08] in blood and his name is called the word
[9:11] of god
[9:12] and the armies which were in heaven
[9:14] followed him upon white horses
[9:16] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[9:18] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[9:20] sword
[9:21] that with it he should smite the nations
[9:24] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[9:26] iron
[9:26] and he treadeth the wine press of the
[9:28] fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[9:31] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[9:33] thigh a name written
[9:34] king of kings and lord of lords
[9:39] john 1 48 nathanael saith unto him
[9:44] whence knowest thou me jesus answered
[9:47] and said unto him
[9:48] before that philip called thee when thou
[9:50] was under the fig tree i
[9:52] saw thee there it is when he comes that
[9:55] word will come against all nations and
[9:57] all men
[9:58] and none will be able to stand against
[10:00] it it will reveal what was in
[10:02] every heart as he did with nathanael the
[10:05] word of god will show who did the will
[10:07] of god and who didn't
[10:09] it will make known the secret works of
[10:11] every man and why he did them
[10:13] it will divide asunder that is what it
[10:16] says in romans 2
[10:18] 3 and thinkest thou this o man that
[10:21] judges them which do such things and do
[10:23] us the same
[10:24] that thou shalt escape the judgment of
[10:26] god then it goes on to say how god is
[10:29] going to judge men
[10:31] here it is in verses 5 to 17 the hard
[10:34] impenitent heart will be judged
[10:36] the works will be judged the motives
[10:39] will be judged
[10:40] there won't be any respect before god
[10:43] but all will be judged by that word no
[10:45] one escaping it
[10:47] those who hurt and wouldn't listen will
[10:49] be judged by what they heard
[10:51] those that rested in it saying they
[10:53] believed it but didn't live it will be
[10:54] judged
[10:55] every secret will come out in the open
[10:57] and be shouted from the housetops
[10:59] oh we will really understand history
[11:01] then there won't be a mystery left from
[11:04] all the ages but do you know that he is
[11:07] revealing the heart secrets of men and
[11:09] women in this age in which we are living
[11:12] who else could reveal the secrets of the
[11:14] heart but the word himself
[11:16] hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is
[11:19] quick and powerful and
[11:21] sharper than any two-edged sword
[11:23] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[11:25] soul and spirit
[11:27] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[11:29] discerner of the thoughts and
[11:30] intents of the heart it is the word
[11:34] it is performing where unto it was sent
[11:37] for it
[11:38] the word is full of power it is the same
[11:41] spirit that was in jesus
[11:42] the word that is present again in the
[11:45] church in this last age
[11:46] as a last sign trying to head the people
[11:49] off from judgment
[11:50] for they that reject him the word are
[11:53] now already come into judgment
[11:55] crucifying him afresh
[11:57] hebrews 6 6 if they shall fall away to
[12:01] renew them again unto repentance
[12:03] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[12:05] son of god afresh
[12:06] and put him to an open shame
[12:10] now paul said that the word came in
[12:11] power as well as voice
[12:13] the word preached actually demonstrated
[12:16] itself
[12:17] like a flaming cutting sword it went to
[12:19] the consciences of men
[12:20] and like a surgeon's knife it cut out
[12:22] the diseases and set captives free
[12:25] everywhere these early believers went
[12:27] they went preaching the gospel
[12:29] word and god confirmed that word with
[12:31] signs following
[12:33] the sick were healed devils were cast
[12:35] out and they spoke in new tongues
[12:38] that was the word in action that word
[12:40] has never failed in the mouths of
[12:42] believing christians
[12:44] and in this last age it is here stronger
[12:46] and greater than ever in the true word
[12:48] bride
[12:50] oh little flock you little minority hold
[12:52] on to the word
[12:54] fill your mouth and heart with it and
[12:56] someday god will give you the kingdom
[12:59] seven his face like the sun
[13:03] and his countenance was as the sun
[13:05] shineth in its strength
[13:07] matthew 17 1-13
[13:10] and after six days jesus taketh peter
[13:13] james and john his brother
[13:15] and bringeth them up into an high
[13:17] mountain apart
[13:18] and was transfigured before them and his
[13:21] face did shine as the sun
[13:23] and his raiment was white as the light
[13:25] and behold there appeared unto them
[13:27] moses and elias talking with him
[13:30] then answered peter and said unto jesus
[13:32] lord it is good for us to be here
[13:35] if thou wilt let us make here three
[13:37] tabernacles
[13:38] one for thee and one for moses and one
[13:41] for elias
[13:42] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[13:45] overshadowed them
[13:46] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[13:48] which said
[13:49] this is my beloved son and whom i am
[13:52] well pleased
[13:53] hear ye him and when the disciples heard
[13:56] it they fell on their face and were sore
[13:57] afraid
[13:59] and jesus came and touched them and said
[14:01] arise and be not afraid
[14:04] and when they had lifted up their eyes
[14:06] they saw no man save jesus only
[14:08] and as they came down from the mountain
[14:10] jesus charged them saying
[14:13] tell the vision to no man until the son
[14:15] of man be risen again from the dead
[14:17] and his disciples asked him saying why
[14:20] then say the scribes that elias must
[14:22] first come
[14:23] and jesus answered and said unto them
[14:26] elias truly shall first come and restore
[14:28] all things
[14:29] but i say unto you that elias has come
[14:31] already and they knew him not
[14:34] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[14:35] listed
[14:37] likewise shall also the son of man
[14:39] suffer of them
[14:40] then the disciples understood that he
[14:42] spake unto them of john the baptist
[14:46] now in matthew 16 28 prefacing matthew
[14:49] 17
[14:50] 1-13 jesus had said
[14:54] there be some standing here which shall
[14:56] not taste of death
[14:57] till they see the son of man coming in
[14:59] his kingdom
[15:01] and the three apostles did see just that
[15:03] the order of his second coming
[15:05] they saw him transfigured there on the
[15:07] mountain top his raiment was blazing
[15:10] white and his face shone like the sun at
[15:12] its zenith
[15:14] and there as he appeared stood moses and
[15:16] elijah on either side
[15:18] that is exactly how he is coming again
[15:21] truly elijah will first come and turn
[15:23] the hearts of the children
[15:24] bride back to the father's apostolic
[15:26] word doctrine
[15:28] malachi 4 5-6
[15:31] behold i will send you elijah the
[15:33] prophet before the coming of the great
[15:35] and dreadful day of the lord
[15:37] and he shall turn the heart of the
[15:38] fathers to the children and the heart of
[15:40] the children to their fathers
[15:42] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[15:44] curse
[15:46] israel is already a nation she is
[15:49] established now with her army's navy
[15:51] postal system
[15:52] flag and all that pertains to nationhood
[15:55] but there is still to be fulfilled the
[15:56] scripture that says
[15:58] or shall a nation be born at once isaiah
[16:02] 66
[16:03] 8 that day is coming soon
[16:06] the fig tree has put forth her buds the
[16:09] israelites are waiting for the messiah
[16:11] they are expecting him and their
[16:12] expectations are about to be fulfilled
[16:15] israel will be reborn spiritually for
[16:18] her light and her life are about to be
[16:19] revealed to her
[16:22] in revelation 21 23
[16:25] and the city had no need of the sun
[16:27] neither of the moon to shine in it
[16:29] for the glory of god did lighten it and
[16:31] the lamb is the light thereof
[16:33] this is the new jerusalem the lamb will
[16:36] be in that city and because of his
[16:38] presence there will be no light needed
[16:40] the sun won't rise and shine there for
[16:43] he is the sun and light thereof himself
[16:46] the nations that come into it will walk
[16:48] in his light
[16:49] aren't you happy that day is upon us
[16:51] john saw that day coming
[16:53] even so lord jesus come quickly
[16:57] malachi 4 1-3 for behold the day cometh
[17:02] that shall burn as an oven
[17:04] and all the proud yea and all that do
[17:06] wickedly shall be stubble
[17:08] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[17:09] up saith the lord of hosts
[17:12] that it shall leave them neither root
[17:13] nor branch but unto you that fear my
[17:16] name shall the son of righteousness
[17:18] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[17:20] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[17:22] the stall
[17:24] and ye shall tread down the wicked for
[17:26] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[17:28] your feet in the day that i shall do
[17:30] this saith the lord of hosts
[17:32] there it is again the sun shining out in
[17:35] all its strength
[17:37] oh the strength of the son of god
[17:38] shining in the midst of the seven golden
[17:40] candlesticks
[17:42] there he stands the judge the one who
[17:45] suffered and died
[17:46] for us he took the wrath of divine
[17:48] judgment upon himself
[17:50] he tread the winepress of the fierceness
[17:52] of the wrath of god alone
[17:54] as we have already stated to the sinner
[17:56] his voice is as the sound of the
[17:58] cataract
[17:59] or the surf pounding in waves of death
[18:01] upon the rocky shores
[18:03] but to the saint his voice is as the
[18:05] sound of the sweetly singing brook as
[18:07] you lie at rest
[18:08] satisfied in christ shining upon us with
[18:11] his warming rays of love he says
[18:14] fear not i am he which was which is
[18:17] which is to come i am the almighty
[18:20] beside me there is no other i am the
[18:23] alpha and omega the
[18:24] all of it he's the lily of the valley
[18:27] the bright and morning star
[18:30] he's the fairest of ten thousand to my
[18:32] soul
[18:33] yes that great day is ready to break and
[18:35] the sun of righteousness will arise with
[18:37] healing in his wings
[18:40] the victorious christ
[18:43] revelation 1 17-18
[18:47] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[18:49] dead
[18:50] and he laid his right hand upon me
[18:52] saying unto me
[18:53] fear not i am the first and the last
[18:56] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[18:59] behold i am alive forevermore
[19:01] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[19:04] death
[19:06] no human being could stand the full
[19:08] effect of that vision
[19:10] his strength utterly gone john fell at
[19:12] his feet as though dead
[19:13] but the hand of the lord in love touched
[19:15] him and the voice of blessings said
[19:18] fear not don't be afraid i am the first
[19:22] and last i am he that liveth and was
[19:25] dead
[19:26] and behold i am alive forevermore what
[19:28] is there to fear
[19:30] the judgment that fell upon him at the
[19:32] cross at the grave
[19:34] and when he descended was for us he
[19:36] absorbed the full brunt of the wound of
[19:38] sin and there is therefore now
[19:39] no condemnation to them which are in
[19:41] christ jesus
[19:43] see for a surety our attorney is our
[19:46] judge he is both attorney and
[19:49] judge as judge the case is settled
[19:53] it is finished there is now therefore no
[19:55] condemnation
[19:57] why should the church fear what promise
[19:59] has he
[20:00] ever failed to manifest before us why
[20:03] should it fear punishment or death
[20:05] it has all been overcome here is the
[20:07] mighty conqueror
[20:09] here is the one who conquered both
[20:10] worlds of the seen and unseen
[20:13] not like alexander who conquered the
[20:15] world at the age of 33
[20:17] and knew no other way to turn for
[20:18] further conquest
[20:20] so he died a victim of sin and riotous
[20:22] living
[20:23] not like napoleon who conquered all
[20:26] europe but finally was defeated at
[20:27] waterloo and banished to elba
[20:29] only to find himself conquered but
[20:32] nothing could conquer
[20:34] christ he that descended has now
[20:36] ascended above all
[20:37] and unto him has been given a name that
[20:39] is above every name
[20:41] yes he conquered death hell and the
[20:44] grave and has the keys thereof
[20:46] what he loses is loosed and what he
[20:49] binds is bound
[20:50] there is no changing of it there was no
[20:53] conqueror before him and there is none
[20:55] beside him
[20:56] he alone is the savior redeemer he is
[20:59] the only god
[21:00] and lord jesus christ is his name
[21:04] don't fear john don't fear little flock
[21:07] all that i am you are heir to all my
[21:10] power is yours
[21:12] my omnipotence is yours as i stand in
[21:14] your midst
[21:15] i have not come to bring fear and
[21:17] failure but love and courage and ability
[21:19] all power is given unto me and it is
[21:21] yours to use
[21:23] you speak the word and i will perform it
[21:26] that is my covenant and it can never
[21:28] fail
[21:31] the seven stars and candlesticks
[21:34] revelation 1 20. the mystery of the
[21:38] seven stars which thou sawest in my
[21:40] right hand
[21:41] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[21:44] seven stars are the angels
[21:46] messengers of the seven churches and the
[21:48] seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[21:50] the seven
[21:51] churches we have already discovered the
[21:54] truth of these two mysteries
[21:56] or we haven't revealed who these seven
[21:57] messengers were
[21:59] but by the help of god we will and that
[22:01] mystery will be accomplished
[22:03] the seven ages we know they are listed
[22:06] in the word and we will deal with each
[22:08] so as to come up to this last age in
[22:10] which we live
[22:12] but in one last closing glimpse of this
[22:14] chapter
[22:15] see him as he stands there in the midst
[22:17] of the golden lamp stands with the seven
[22:19] stars in his right hand
[22:21] oh it is breathtaking to see him
[22:23] standing there in his supreme deity he
[22:26] is the judge the priest the king the
[22:29] eagle
[22:30] the lamb the lion the alpha the omega
[22:33] the beginning and the end the father son
[22:37] holy ghost he which was which is
[22:40] which is to come the almighty be all and
[22:43] all
[22:44] there he is the author and finisher
[22:46] worthy is that lamb
[22:48] he proved his worth as he bought our
[22:50] salvation by himself
[22:52] now he stands in all his power and all
[22:54] his glory with all things committed unto
[22:57] him as judge
[22:59] yes there he stands amidst the lamp
[23:01] stands with the stars in his hand
[23:03] it is night for that is when we use
[23:06] lamps for light
[23:07] and that is when the stars are seen
[23:09] shining and reflecting the light of the
[23:10] sun
[23:11] and it is dark the church is walking by
[23:14] faith in the darkness
[23:16] her lord departed this earth but the
[23:18] holy spirit still shines out through the
[23:20] church
[23:21] giving light to this old sin cursed
[23:23] world
[23:24] and those stars reflect his light also
[23:27] the only light they have
[23:28] is his light how dark it is how
[23:31] spiritually cold
[23:33] yet when he comes into the midst it is
[23:35] light and warm
[23:36] and the church is empowered and through
[23:38] him does the works that he did
[23:41] oh that we might get a glimpse of him as
[23:43] did john
[23:44] what manner of people we ought to be
[23:46] standing before him at that day
[23:48] if you have not already given your life
[23:50] to him may you turn your heart to god
[23:52] this moment
[23:53] and kneel down right where you are and
[23:55] ask his forgiveness for your sins
[23:58] and surrender your life to him then we
[24:00] will attempt to approach the seven
[24:02] church ages together and as we do
[24:05] i pray that god will help this unworthy
[24:07] servant to reveal his word to you
[24:11] chapter three the ephesian church age
[24:15] introduction to the church ages
[24:19] in order for you to fully understand the
[24:21] message of the church ages
[24:22] i would like to explain the various
[24:24] principles that allowed me to arrive at
[24:26] the names of the messengers
[24:27] the length of the ages and other factors
[24:29] involved therein since this study was to
[24:33] be the most serious one i had ever
[24:34] undertaken up to this time
[24:36] i sought god for many days for the
[24:38] inspiration of the holy spirit
[24:40] then only did i read the scriptures on
[24:42] the church ages and delve into the many
[24:44] church histories
[24:45] written by the most unbiased historians
[24:47] that i could find
[24:49] god did not fail to answer my prayer for
[24:52] while i read the word and the histories
[24:54] i was enabled by the holy spirit to see
[24:56] unfolded a pattern that runs through the
[24:59] centuries and right into this present
[25:01] last day the key given me of the lord
[25:05] whereby i was able to determine the
[25:06] messenger for each age
[25:08] is a most scriptural one in fact it
[25:10] might be called the keystone of the
[25:12] bible
[25:13] it is the revelation that god never
[25:15] changes and that his ways are as
[25:17] unchangeable as he is
[25:19] in hebrews 13 8 it says
[25:22] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[25:24] today and forever
[25:26] ecclesiastes 3 14-15
[25:30] i know that whatsoever god doeth it
[25:32] shall be forever
[25:34] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[25:36] taken from it
[25:37] and god doeth it that man should fear
[25:40] before him
[25:41] that which hath been is now and that
[25:43] which is to be have already been
[25:46] and god requireth that which is past
[25:50] here it is an unchanging god with
[25:52] unchanging ways
[25:54] what he did at the first he will have to
[25:56] keep on doing until it is done for the
[25:58] last time
[25:59] there will never be a change apply that
[26:02] to the church ages
[26:04] the kind of man that god chose for the
[26:06] first age and how god manifested in that
[26:08] man's ministry
[26:09] would be the example for all other ages
[26:12] what god did in the first church age is
[26:14] what he wants to do in
[26:16] all other ages now we know exactly from
[26:19] the word which was recorded by the holy
[26:21] spirit
[26:22] how the first or original church was
[26:24] founded and how god manifested himself
[26:26] in her
[26:27] the word can't change or be changed
[26:29] because the word is god
[26:32] john 1 1. in the beginning was the word
[26:36] and the word was with god and the word
[26:39] was god
[26:41] to change one word of it as did eve
[26:43] bring sin and death
[26:45] even as it says in revelation 22 18-19
[26:49] if any man shall add unto these things
[26:52] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[26:54] are written in this book
[26:56] and if any man shall take away from the
[26:58] words of the book of this prophecy
[27:00] god shall take away his part out of the
[27:02] book of life
[27:03] and out of the holy city and from the
[27:05] things which are written
[27:06] in this book thus what the church was at
[27:09] pentecost is the standard
[27:11] that is the pattern there is no other
[27:13] pattern
[27:14] no matter what the scholars say god has
[27:17] not changed that pattern
[27:19] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[27:21] on doing until the church ages close
[27:24] though scholars may tell you the
[27:26] apostolic age is over don't you believe
[27:28] it
[27:29] such a statement is wrong on two counts
[27:32] first of all
[27:33] it is wrong to suppose there aren't any
[27:35] more apostles
[27:36] just because the original 12 are dead an
[27:39] apostle means ascent one
[27:41] and there are many sent ones today but
[27:43] they are called missionaries
[27:45] as long as men are being called and sent
[27:47] forth with the word of life
[27:48] there is an apostolic age going on
[27:51] secondly
[27:52] they refer to an age of manifested holy
[27:54] ghost power
[27:56] as being over since the bible has been
[27:57] completed
[27:59] that is untrue there is not even one
[28:02] scripture that suggests that
[28:03] but many conclusively state otherwise
[28:06] here is our proof that both of these
[28:08] charges are false
[28:10] acts 2 38-39
[28:13] then peter said unto them repent and be
[28:16] baptized every one of you in the name of
[28:18] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[28:20] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[28:22] holy ghost
[28:24] for the promise is unto you and to your
[28:26] children
[28:27] and to all that are afar off even as
[28:29] many as the lord our god shall call
[28:33] the promise of power with which the
[28:34] apostles were indeed at pentecost is to
[28:37] you
[28:38] jews and to your children jews
[28:41] and to all that are afar off gentiles
[28:44] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[28:46] call
[28:47] both jew and gentile until he stops
[28:51] calling the pentecostal message and
[28:52] power will not cease
[28:55] what the church
[29:00] [Music]
[29:34] you
