[1:12:35] in there they don't look to see where
[1:12:37] it's coming what they
[1:12:39] do but I I'm so glad today you're
[1:12:43] Eagles and you're not chickens right
[1:12:46] you're just not eating anything that a
[1:12:48] minister would say are you hearing me
[1:12:50] just because he's a minister amen amen
[1:12:53] you know and I I'm glad because I know
[1:12:56] you're trained because if you're not
[1:12:57] trained I could easily get you all
[1:13:00] pumped up and I can say Jesus is coming
[1:13:03] on a helicopter ah glory to God
[1:13:07] right Hallelujah and you takeing note
[1:13:10] Jesus coming on a helicopter after the
[1:13:13] church I'm going to ask brother chm what
[1:13:15] type of helicopter is he coming
[1:13:19] on but I thank God we know better than
[1:13:23] that amen I I thank God you know uh
[1:13:26] brother Brandon said uh predestination
[1:13:29] it's not a good word to you I feel real
[1:13:31] good this morning brother Brandon said
[1:13:34] predestination is not a good word to use
[1:13:36] before untrained audience yes sir that's
[1:13:39] right he said predestination leans on
[1:13:41] the full knowledge of God and it looks
[1:13:44] to election oh my how many you thank God
[1:13:46] that you've been elected amen so brother
[1:13:49] Brandon say predestination is not a good
[1:13:51] word to use before an untrained audience
[1:13:54] because some people people think because
[1:13:56] they are predestinated they could do
[1:13:58] anything they want they they can stay
[1:14:01] out of church they don't have to come to
[1:14:03] church they they could just just stay
[1:14:05] home to do what they want and still go
[1:14:07] into Rapture no brother that's not true
[1:14:10] amen the Holy Ghost would love to go to
[1:14:13] church right oh man somebody said
[1:14:15] brother CH you acting like evangelist
[1:14:17] now amen I'm going to preach you amen
[1:14:19] the Holy Ghost can't wait to go to
[1:14:22] church a lot of time people think
[1:14:24] because
[1:14:25] predestinate predestinated they feel
[1:14:28] like well I could slide a little bit you
[1:14:31] know I you know I could do it it's okay
[1:14:35] God understand you know I'm weak and he
[1:14:38] understand and no no go no God there's a
[1:14:41] higher calling now God is calling for
[1:14:44] Perfection amen see the Bible say he
[1:14:47] that knoweth uh to do good and doeth is
[1:14:50] not to him what it is sin so the bride
[1:14:53] she's being predestinated she know
[1:14:55] what predestination is I pray I pray you
[1:14:59] understand me this morning now Paul
[1:15:01] wrote here in First Corinthians uh the
[1:15:04] 15th chapter he says he said in verse 50
[1:15:07] it says now this I say Brethren that
[1:15:11] flesh and blood
[1:15:13] cannot uh flesh and
[1:15:17] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[1:15:21] neither do corruption inherit corruption
[1:15:25] but watch verse
[1:15:26] 51 behold I show you a mystery a mystery
[1:15:31] is something that has not been revealed
[1:15:33] right right but behold I show you a
[1:15:36] mystery we shall not all sleep now I I
[1:15:40] know the the world you know when I was
[1:15:42] in the system you know that especially

[1:16:06] and folks get to look on their faith we
[1:16:08] all got to lay in the cast that's not
[1:16:10] what Jesus said the Bible said that
[1:16:12] there are some that won't even taste
[1:16:14] death so how could everybody be dead and
[1:16:18] the Bible said the dead in Christ shall
[1:16:20] rise first and we that are alive and
[1:16:23] remain so there's going to be some
[1:16:25] people that's going to be alive are you

[1:17:30] long time but I believe that we are at
[1:17:32] the threshold I believe we're so close
[1:17:35] it has got to be and you you think about
[1:17:37] the prophet of God those seven visions
[1:17:39] that he had and he talk about melum and
[1:17:42] stall them and then he goes on and he
[1:17:44] said right before the end time you young
[1:17:46] people write it down see if it don't
[1:17:48] come to pass if it don't I'm a false
[1:17:50] prophet he said just before the end time
[1:17:53] there'll be a woman or perhaps the Roman
[1:17:55] Catholic Church she either be president
[1:17:58] or vice president he said Mark that down
[1:18:00] church let me tell you what that was in
[1:18:03] 1933 and 87 years later kimela hars are

[1:18:11] swear as the vice president of the
[1:18:14] United States of America and let me tell
[1:18:17] you what that was the sixth Vision if if
[1:18:19] I'm right amen but the last vision is
[1:18:22] what America is blown to peace and you
[1:18:26] think I'm going to play Church no you

[1:18:51] laying in a hotel with my wife enjoying
[1:18:55] life I'm going to be in church I may not
[1:18:58] be here but somewhere I'm going to be in
[1:19:00] the presence of the Lord man during the
[1:19:02] co time I went down to Florida and I
[1:19:05] wanted to go to a church but believe it
[1:19:07] or not the churches was closed because
[1:19:09] of the co it was
[1:19:13] miserable that Sunday I didn't go to
[1:19:16] church I felt like I took step backward
[1:19:19] you don't feel like that sometime some
[1:19:21] people miss church and they feel like
[1:19:23] they're okay you know this out of church
[1:19:25] a couple sunds you know amen but I thank
[1:19:28] God I'm going to church amen Oh Glory to
[1:19:31] God hallelujah but let me tell you now I
[1:19:33] heard a lot of folks say well we don't
[1:19:35] have to go to church we are the church
[1:19:37] you keep on keep on believing that okay
[1:19:39] the Bible that don't nect to S yourself
[1:19:42] are you hearing me yes sir we are living
[1:19:45] in in in the phases of the Rapture but
[1:19:49] he says behold I show you a mystery we
[1:19:52] shall not all sleep
[1:19:56] but we shall all be changed how we going
[1:19:59] to be changed Church in a moment in a
[1:20:03] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:20:08] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:20:11] be raised
[1:20:13] Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:20:16] chained for this corrupt must put on
[1:20:19] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:20:23] immortality
[1:20:25] amen can the church say amen amen so you
[1:20:29] look where Apostle Paul said we are
[1:20:33] changed how many you think God we had a
[1:20:36] prophet Amen to go into the Revelation
[1:20:40] and give us hope amen
[1:20:45] because when when you think the Bible
[1:20:47] says we're going to change what in a
[1:20:51] moment of a twinkling of an eye and
[1:20:54] brother Brandon said it's just like
[1:20:56] quick as you could blink your eye we'll
[1:20:59] be changed
[1:21:01] gone so so so is that's going to catch
[1:21:06] us by
[1:21:08] surprise we know what's coming if you
[1:21:11] don't understand the phases where you at
[1:21:15] then you're going to get all scribbl up
[1:21:18] now reason I said that you said brother
[1:21:19] and children where are you going with
[1:21:21] that I know for a known fact for about
[1:21:23] six years ago I was ministering at this
[1:21:26] church and like three or four sisters
[1:21:28] came up and the last sister came up and
[1:21:31] when she came up there was no you know
[1:21:35] last night I felt like everyone that
[1:21:37] came up they were sincere I really do
[1:21:41] all my heart and I believe if you
[1:21:43] believe it's going to come to pass if
[1:21:46] you don't doubt in your heart it's going
[1:21:48] to come how many you believe that it's
[1:21:49] going to come to pass and it's already
[1:21:52] working now so I feel like everyone that
[1:21:56] came up here I believe that you was
[1:21:58] touched by God but let me tell you what
[1:22:01] when those sisters came up the last
[1:22:03] sister she came up with her arm dropped
[1:22:05] down and her head hang down in the laps
[1:22:07] of her shoulder and she looking all sad
[1:22:10] then I come down to her to know her and
[1:22:13] I says my sister I said what what is
[1:22:15] your heart desire she says I don't
[1:22:20] know I said what does your heart desire
[1:22:23] sister she said I don't know I said I
[1:22:27] said what you mean she said I don't
[1:22:29] know she said y'all said That's supposed
[1:22:33] to be a Rapture and we're still
[1:22:36] here and she
[1:22:38] said I don't know
[1:22:41] anymore and she turned around she said I
[1:22:44] don't know no more I don't even love my
[1:22:47] husband no more and I'm like oh my God
[1:22:50] so I was making sure my microphone
[1:22:53] wasn't on then I look back at the the
[1:22:54] husband he was on the up there on the
[1:22:57] platform praising God and she said I
[1:22:59] don't even have feeling for him anymore
[1:23:02] and I wonder today how many spiritually
[1:23:06] losing feeling right for your husband
[1:23:10] you you lost that desire you're not
[1:23:12] looking for him anymore he's he's going
[1:23:14] on a journey but you're not looking
[1:23:16] anymore you're not you're not waiting
[1:23:18] for him so people don't understand the
[1:23:22] the phases of the Rapture now brother
[1:23:23] Brandon said when the angel descended
[1:23:26] what with the book in his hand when a
[1:23:28] mighty angel now Church of the Living
[1:23:30] God I didn't know and I'm sure you
[1:23:32] didn't know amen the coming of the Lord
[1:23:35] was in a way that no one ever imagined
[1:23:38] it would be the Lord descended from
[1:23:41] Heaven what he veiled himself in human
[1:23:45] flesh he stepped right into a prophet
[1:23:48] and he did that Ministry of Christ on
[1:23:50] the earth William Brandon was not Jesus
[1:23:53] Christ but the spirit of Christ was in

[1:35:27] coming since the father fell asleep all
[1:35:31] things continue as they were from the
[1:35:35] beginning you ever heard people say

[1:35:46] when you mention the word rapture people
[1:35:48] just look at you

[1:36:16] people you in the Rapture Jesus is
[1:36:18] already
[1:36:20] come are you hearing me so the people
[1:36:23] feel like Jesus is already here why

[1:44:23] sheep of Israel he only died for the
[1:44:25] lake are you the lake of God that's why
[1:44:28] the Bible said in 2 Timothy 2:9 it said
[1:44:31] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:44:33] standards are sure the Lord knows them
[1:44:36] that are his how many is

[1:45:30] that yeah you would know that my dad is
[1:45:33] the president he got the highest office
[1:45:36] in in the in the United States he's the
[1:45:38] president and let me tell you what I'm
[1:45:40] not just talking about President Joe B
[1:45:43] but I'm talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:45:45] Christ He's My
[1:45:47] Savior and what is the church God has
[1:45:51] got to get the church
[1:45:53] he want to have
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:59] preeminence God was in Christ and he had
[1:46:02] full control everything Jesus said I
[1:46:05] would do nothing except the father shows
[1:46:09] me and that's right so brother Brown say
[1:46:13] second purpose was to have
[1:46:17] preeminence and his
[1:46:20] bride in other words God want to have
[1:46:24] full
[1:46:26] control God want you to become a a love
[1:46:29] slave can I use that word that he got
[1:46:32] full control of your mind your thought
[1:46:36] like he had Paul he had such control of
[1:46:39] apostle Paul and Paul said I am
[1:46:42] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:46:45] live the life that I not live in the
[1:46:47] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:46:50] God who loved me and gave his life for
[1:46:52] me and that's the way we got to be in
[1:46:54] this hour amen I'm living because Christ
[1:46:58] is living in me so let me tell you what
[1:47:00] church when God could get us to a place
[1:47:03] brother brownon said what he want to do
[1:47:05] he said the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:47:08] waiting on the revelation of the Rapture
[1:47:12] what is a revelation it's something that
[1:47:14] has been revealed to you A lot of people
[1:47:17] don't have a revelation on thing they
[1:47:19] know they going to church amen they said
[1:47:21] I believe that God sent a prophet amen
[1:47:23] and that's the only thing I found out
[1:47:26] brother Steve in this message people has
[1:47:30] come out but they got to a place the
[1:47:33] only thing they can see is a prophet
[1:47:37] right cuz the way that some people
[1:47:40] present it yes only thing they can see
[1:47:42] is a prophet they can see as a prophet
[1:47:45] they can see as a prophet so the
[1:47:47] minister can't take them
[1:47:49] beyond the face of a man that show what
[1:47:53] the man came for yes he came to what to
[1:47:57] turn our hearts not to him but to turn

[1:48:45] to go into the kingdom of God without a
[1:48:48] revelation first of all Christ has got

[2:05:56] will test you every every son that
[2:05:58] cometh to God must be must be proven
[2:06:01] people say they're ready to go in the
[2:06:02] Rapture and a lot of people say well I'm
[2:06:04] in the top of the pyramid with that
[2:06:06] Capstone love really okay amen but God
[2:06:09] said I want to test you right right
[2:06:12] about a year ago I had someone to
[2:06:15] threaten to kill me I've never had that
[2:06:17] in my life and I'm not going to go into
[2:06:19] full detail it was close and you you
[2:06:21] could ever imagine and it wasn't my wife
[2:06:27] okay and it threatened to kill me but
[2:06:30] the thing about the Lord showed me that
[2:06:33] years ago show me the person face how
[2:06:35] they raised up against me but that day
[2:06:39] when I was threatened it bothered me a
[2:06:41] little bit and I said to myself I don't
[2:06:45] even want that person around me
[2:06:47] anymore let's keep them far off keep
[2:06:51] fall
[2:06:53] off are you hearing me amen but then
[2:06:56] after a while I start thinking about the
[2:06:59] stature of a perfect man when you
[2:07:01] talking about faith virtues knowledge
[2:07:03] temper patience and you talking about
[2:07:05] brotherly kindness brothers can't hardly
[2:07:07] get along with one another and they
[2:07:09] talking about we in the Capstone I told
[2:07:11] a lot of preacher it's okay for you to
[2:07:14] preach the seven seal a lot of churches
[2:07:16] I go to not a lot of church but sometime
[2:07:18] when you preach the mystery we don't
[2:07:20] need all that right that's because they
[2:07:22] don't understand and I feel if you got
[2:07:25] the Holy Ghost I believe you are able to
[2:07:27] preach the mystery why why talk about
[2:07:31] the mystery when you got Envy in your
[2:07:34] heart why talk about the open of the
[2:07:37] seven seal when you got Envy in your
[2:07:39] heart are you hearing me you need to get
