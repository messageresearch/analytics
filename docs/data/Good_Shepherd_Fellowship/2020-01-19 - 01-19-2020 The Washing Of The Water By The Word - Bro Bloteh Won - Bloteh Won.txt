singing for after the service so thank you musicians yes last Sunday after service I had to talk to the sisters a little bit and it was all about doing our convenient service we try to practice the three ordinance that was left with the church by our Lord Jesus that is baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ convenient the breaking eating of the bread and all sort of the wine and then also for washing and then it was it was brought praise the Lord let's just pray this prayer request year Heavenly Father Lord garden we want to pray father for this family India lost Oh God just this morning father Lord in there and actually in Lord guarding a young life of 28 years of God has been taken from the earth I believe Lord God and it's hurtful Lord God to all the families that I weigh

comfort to everyone of whom [Music] we love you Father we appreciate you Lord father is so comforting there in such a time we can learn to draw strength from your word we can have the courage Lord and strength to come into your presence of God Lord Jesus we even now once again remember Danny's wife sister fat Eliza they mourn their loss to God I also did happen sometime this week we just pray father Lord bless them Oh God in Jesus [Music] principal and so as I was saying normally when we do have the convenient the sisters would go over into the cry room for the fourth watching so and to find out that sometimes it can be disrupting because they have to take care of the children and and I think it's a big sacrifice you know I think it's a big sacrifice most of the time we are in the service and a little try you know it's bad because of something maybe hungry and try to be faceted maybe want to play and it's so easy you know for for us to feel offended because it looks like we've been disrupted but it's a lot of sacrifice and on the part of those parents whether is the father or the mother that we take the child out there just for our comfort praise the Lord just for us to be able to enjoy the service or enjoy the preaching of the world without a child fussing a mother will go back there and try to attain to the child and him even focus on what what has been preached I believe that's a big sacrifice amen if someone can be able to to seek your comfort praise the Lord and and we should commend them for that but the other day when we come over to the communion and and just as I said all the time you know is it's all part of the service when we get down to that time of foot washing so most of the time with the brothers we stay right in here and you know I stay here and go down and do the foot washing and then I come back and get ready to leave the service I don't know what's going on back there and but I think the sisters are shared they are concerned they also want to be part of that praying moment when they're watching want another feed they want to be able to pray with one another and and not having the children to be disturbing and sometimes you know some of the families I I knew to to communion how I'll say I'm I'm very proud of this local church meaning has come to really experience the for the completion of all the ordinance in this local assembly and many would take a First Communion in this local assembly meaning you know or partake or for watching in this local assembly and and and as a church I'm very proud of that that we can be able to encourage you to to to fulfill that part of the word jesus said you know were happy at them that know these things and do this and so there's a blessing that goes with it so we we spoke with the sisters and and they all share their concern so our next coming up communion service we will have the sisters using using this space for the effort watching and we pretty much do with the same we have the bathing all to the front and some of the sisters will stay at the back and helping to keep the babies quiet while some come forward and do the for watching and then go and help the other sisters and then we the brothers will go out there in in the foyer and we will do our foot washing there and we will keep you in prayer until they are done and then the becomes will let us know and then we will come right back in here and close the service praise the Lord so we will try to approach it like that and see if we can be able to reduce some of the disturbance a and because you know you walk out of here and you go out there looks like this place is separated from out there but it's all part of the building it's all part of the service you know that is the reason why in the cry room we try to put a monitor that if if if a sister is back there she can be able to follow the service right in the foyer we have a monitor there because it's all part of the service and sometimes we take you know the attitude when we get right out of that door we think we are out of the service and sometimes we find a label here to be able to talk and then it's a small building when you start talking we hearing everything you are saying anyway so we want to kind of work on that we have just a few hours to spend yet and we want to be able to enjoy the best that we can in the service of the Lord praise the Lord so what you know thinking on that last night in knowing I was going to talk about that a little bit I choose this morning to speak a little bit on watching of the water by the word praise the Lord and because I was growing over there in my future I'm thus in John chapter 13 and Jesus said to Peter what I do unto you you know that he says but you will know year after you know so I kind of a pause on that a little bit last night and meditated on that and then I said well I would just change my course of what I want to speak on and I would speak on on on that a little bit the washing of the water by the word like Paul say in the book of Ephesians so let's stand to our feet musicians thank you and we'll have you back in a little bit so we can be able to water this world with some praise and we're just into I was feeding on all the word efficient Chapter five Ephesians chapter 5 I had to go back and last night and look for a very old notebook that I used many years ago teaching on the Tabernacles and I was growing - I was looking for setting tabernacle approach because I wanted to use that tonight I mean this morning I don't have a ball here I could have done some writing now for you but I would just take my time this morning and believe that the Lord would kind of a bless what we have to do praise the Lord Amen this is sufficient chapter 5 let's read from verse 25 and the scripture reads husband love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it there he might sanctify and cleanse it waive the watching of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that issue be holy and without blame praise the Lord let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we have read your sacral world we now ask you Father for inspiration to speak and Lord also inspiration to be able to hear from you this morning speak to our hearts Lord in a way that only you came in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord Allah bless you may have your seat so like I said well I was I was just looking over the convenience and lowering that I was going to talk a little bit about this foot washing thing that we we have talked with the sisters and I mean when I was approached on it I told the sister that I was so blessed that that you know that we got to know what was happening back there because I've always been thinking I don't go back to anything and we try to keep it decent because the sisters are bearing and the annealing and you're watching one another feet and it must be just among them so we don't go there to see what is happening and but we were glad to know that I needed some help and we do our best to be able to keep it decently and in order so this morning we want to talk a little bit on the washing of the water by the word so like I said I just want to just look at a little bit of a tabernacle order because this this this order actually came from the Old Testament the entire order of feet watching it came from the Old Testament so I want to look at that a little bit this morning and let's go to st. John chapter 13 there was word Jesus literally taught his disciples he said you call me Lord and Master and wish of course I am and if I a Lord and Master watch your feet you ought to watch one another feet praise the Lord amen since John chapter 13 reading from verse tool and supper being ended the devil having now pulled into the heart of Judas Iscariot so much Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garment and took a tower and gather himself after that he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wet them with the towel wherewith he was gathered then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto Him Lord dost thou wash my feet and Jesus said unto Him what I what I do that knoweth not now but - I know yeah after and Peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus said unto him if I wash the net they have no part with me amen Jesus first said unto him what I do now you don't know it amen but you will get to know it year after praise the Lord amen and just like we said last week this was a dispensation where Grace and Lord was embracing amen all of the things that were done under the law will find their fulfillment in this dispensation with our Lord Jesus being the fulfillment of the Lord praise the Lord like the scripture says no man is saved by the Lord no man can be justified by the law but the Lord had an expression of what God's desire was for his people and now he will come right under the dispensation of grace to be able to fulfill his desire that he was expressing honor the Lord now so we see here and the end the conference goes further from there Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my not my feet on it but also my hands in my head and jesus said unto him he that is watch needed not save to watch his feet but his claim every way and yeah I claim but not all praise the Lord now so Jesus bring out another plain that he that is watch need now safe to watch on his feet he have to work because he has already been watch now when you look through the scripture the first time the Bible who actually speaks our feet watching will be Genesis chapter 18 amen and it will be Abraham receiving those three men praise the Lord is it is is it's amazing that Abraham the father of our faith some of the things that adhere to our faith was fulfilled in his life amen because he's the father of our faith Genesis chapter 15 there was were a God necessary give Abraham communion there was the very beginning of communion when Abraham returned back from the slaughter of the king and and he was able to redeem the people back a girl came in the form of mecca's Erik and break bread and gave Abraham wine and bread are we together now so you see these things if they were not important God would not put it in the foundation amen this was just after the ark after God has brought a judgment to that antediluvian age and now he was going to start another dispensation he called a man Abraham that he gave a promise and right in the life in God dealing with Abraham he laid out these things praise the Lord but then talking on Todd is right there in in in the life of Abraham so they are very fundamental to the priest and faith but that was the first time Genesis chapter 18 verse 4 when those men came Abraham washed their feet and then he served their meal praise the Lord amen the last time the scripture will talk about watching I would get to there praise the Lord let me net even go back the last time will be Revelation chapter 7 verse 14 there will be when the foolish virgin we have to watch her guy I mean in the blood of the Lamb there will be the last watching that will be done before we go into the Millennium and what actually it is is there will be those Bible believing god-fearing Christians there will not go in the rapture and we have to stand against the beast in his deception because they will refuse to take the mark of the beast and we have to die for the effect and the scripture calls there in Revelation 7:14 that they are watching the arad in the blood in the blood of the Lamb now it's not the literal lambs blood because they will be killed but what will be the blood that they will be watching they will be standing for the word of God amen they will be standing for truth that in know in that time praise the Lord Amen so that's when the scripture point out the last form of watching but we want to get into this watching of the water by the word what what what was actually Jesus are bringing to to his disciple what was he introducing to the church praise the Lord are we together let's stay together praise the Lord amen amen amen now when you go over to to the book of Exodus when you go over to the book of Exodus you will realize right at the time of the Exodus God sent Israel a prophet and there was Moses praise the Lord he sent Israel a prophet and this very man Moses was the man that ran from Egypt one time because I mean he killed an Egyptian and he ran awaiting and he choose to change his profession to start raising sheep and God had to meet him and send him back to go and face his fear amen God likes for us to face our fear while he likes us to face our fear because he don't want us to be afraid he sees fear net so he always sent you to go and face your fear praise the Lord Amen now so they're over in Exodus chapter 28 in Exeter chapter 28 we will do a little kind of for Bible studies this morning just bear with me now we have to go back and forth a little bit exodus chapter 28 the scripture says and take down onto the errand that brother and his sons with him from among the children of Israel that they may minister unto me in the priesthood office even air Aaron and neither in a bear hole and eleiza and última Aaron songs now what I read the scripture for is to show a principle year now God is telling Moses take Aaron in his sons from among the children of Israel of a true from the sons of Jacob the priesthood was given to Levi when Jacob distributed the blessings amen when he distributed the blessings to his sons he gave the priesthood to live on but he received that God honor this dispensation of an accident where God is calling the people how to start dealing with him he raised a prophet and now he's telling the Prophet now the Prophet is the one that is going to call the priests who now even though there was a tribe that the priests who was giving to all of the blessing of Jacob but now all of this dispensation Moses the Prophet he's the one now going to corridors a calling now to the Ministry of the priests who is going to be honoring a prophetic call are we together now so because why this is important the reason why this is important is because when a biram when those men stood against Moses in the wilderness they were not wrong in the way that they conceived it in their mind because they were also of the tribe of Levi and I calling to the blessing of Jacob the priesthood was given to the tribe of Levi and we together so when they complained to the people their complain was Moses is of the tribe of Levi I'm of the tribe of Levi why is Moses making itself so special praise Allah but when you come to this scripture you will see why Moses was was making himself in his brother special because the Lord had told him to call Aaron in his sons to the Ministry of the priesthood which ministry was above that is the reason why if you read the Old Testament you will see there's a difference the Old Testament have a place where it talks about a Levitical priests who and it also speaks of the priests who of Aaron praise the Lord are we together now so that is the reason why you will see there it took a prophet of the New Testament for in a book of efficient to be able to rightly place the fight for ministry it was Paul that spoke about the calling of a pastor the calling of an evangelist the calling in Jesus day they were all called disciples or Jesus in it or they were all known as an apostle but it took Paul to be able to rightly define those ministry why because it's a prophet that do the calling are we together praise the Lord Amen now let's drop down the little bit in the same Exodus chapter 28 let's get down to verse 40 praise the Lord amen and it's a place here I want to hold us a little bit before we get them to to their verse 40 now remember what we want to talk about yet is the watching of the word about the word amen now over in verse 40 and for the one you will see were reading from verse 39 it was all about Moses dressing Aaron and his sons but let's go over to verse chapter 29 the next chapter it will bring us right into what we want to look at this morning I hope now to keep you long but just bear with me amen I'm not on this fall for a long time I mean real trying to do a strip show teaching verse 1 in chapter 29 and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them to minister unto me now God is telling Moses what he should do to these people Aaron in his songs Amen for them to be able to minister unto me in the priest's office take one young bullet into ram without blemish and on living bread and cake on living tempered with oil and white and in waffle on living anointed with oil and wheat in flour shall they I'll make them and thou shalt put him into one basket and and bring them in the basket with the bullet and the to RAM now verse 4 and Aaron and his sons shall they bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt wash them with water amen now remember now Jesus told Peter say he that is watch need not whole body to be wash again he wanted me his feet to be now so keep that in your mind while we look at the scripture together and another thing I want us to remember here Aaron was Moses senior brother amen Aaron was Moses senior brother so what will happen here is that this man when they were called to the priesthood office Moses would take a vision like a bathtub and you will have to bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle is covered with curtains he will have to put him down into this busy and he will wash him praise the Lord amen he will he will wash them and and as you as you go along and they shall take a garment and put it upon Aaron and a coat and rub and then you go down he will also have to anoint him so the the Moses the Prophet we have to watch the priests who he will have to dress them and he will have to anoint him now remember nanny in verse one this is what the Lord told Moses this is what you should do unto them for them to be priests in my office amen and just like Peter said in in in first Peter chapter two we are priests and kings even though our offices of priests and kings could be different because there were different things that they did in the tabernacle but yet all the priests the people that self in the tabernacle had to come through this order for them to step into their service they had to be watch praise the Lord they had to be watch I will tell you something something very funny not too funny but it's funny anything you know last Wednesday we when we were speaking we read that we read a code and and I had a comment on the court and and and says brother branham was not talking about bathtub but he said do you know in nineteen in 1872 the Medical Association of the United States turned down bathtub so I went back and started to make a research on it those things don't fly by mean so easy I went back and I started to make a research on it and they were there were some very very exciting research that I came across but one of them there were that was there was a bit funny to mean instead when the first started breaking the bathtub they have to get the Senate bathtub so in the house in in the in the house the people that are leading the country have to have a Senate bathtub so they had they had a bathtub in the Sun like I can give you the document you can read they had a beard and and and and the Senators had to go and take a bath praise the Lord and pretty soon every senator started putting bathtubs in their houses and and little on them then when it was approved then you know it started spraying so actually there was there was some reason why you know the Medical Association was looking at it because remember those days they did not have bathtubs oh yeah they have outhouses you know bathrooms were not attached to the homes like like beyond now you know bathrooms were away from the home because you know and people would go and take bath you know and all of that and then walk to their house and or death but it was it was interesting when I was looking into there praise the Lord I don't want to read the article I might just get myself I get get myself out of it but I just wanted to use that grab your grab your attention a little bit amen praise the Lord amen now so well so Moses will have to wash them in water like the scripture says and he will have to dress them and he will have to anoint him for them to be able to go into the priesthood office now it has a very very important significance that even even Paul is trying there toward the church the law that Christ had for his church to be able to certify his church cleans his church by the washing of the water by the word amen praise the Lord now you will see why the Apostle says we must net forsake the assembling of the scenes because that's what we do spiritually when we come to church praise the Lord now let's let's let's go a little bit together you now so when when the priest is watch after his watch let's drop down to verse 19 chapter 29 and thou shalt take the other RAM in Aaron and his sons Sons shall put their hands upon the head of the RAM and they're shy killed the RAM and take the blood take of his blood and put it upon the tip of their right ears the right ear of Aaron and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons and upon the tongue of the right hand and upon D a great toll now the priests after he's been watched he's been dressed he's been anointed he has to come and identify himself with his set with the sacrifice wishes the RAM amen you lay his hands upon the RAM and you know the RAM will be will be killed and then the blood will be taking with you no tip on his ear for what he years and his right hand for what he handles and also on his big toes for the places that he goes because now he's he's a seven that stands between God and the people praise the Lord he cannot be involved in every gossip he cannot be involved in you know scandal hen or masonry people money you know they cannot just he cannot just go you know every word because he's standing there is only one mediator between man and God scripture says that may Christ Jesus but the the priest who was a type of the Ministry of Jesus Christ that was standing between the people and the congregation I mean the people and the tabernacle let me say their way which is the right way anyway are we together praise the law so we see here that was the first form of watching the first form of watching was their entire body watching but to the tabernacle when he leaves from the door of the congregation where his watch before he gets to the tabernacle there is another lover amazing where he has to wash his feet before he goes in the tabernacle the first watching is the general body watching that's what we do by our confession when we accept the Lord Jesus Christ repent of our sin we have a general body identifying with Christ by baptism it's a general body watching that's the reason why sprinkling will not work poori will not work it has to be emerging if we will keep the tabernacle other are we together now so when the priests leaves from there let me let me bring their scripture up just now so we can be able to read they're together that speaks about the the lover at the tabernacle I just trying to nap carrying you in - you know these are the things that I wanna study hard to finish him in so I'm just trying to just stay right around you so we can we can be able to just deal with what we are dealing with praise the Lord let me let me get back a little bit just like I said you know we appreciate the sisters you know sisters or brothers you know that help take care of the children back there we appreciate all of their and it's a great blessing to us you know when we can when we can come on a social sense of discipline we have to know that is is our service to God and just like I said when we come to church like this God is our audience amen you are not the audience and I'm the speaker he's the audience he looks in at us what are we appraising what are we are sleeping or whatever we are doing he's the one that is looking at us I must be able to do my part by bringing the Word of God to you amen and you must do your part by receiving the Word of God and he knows if I'm sincere on that he knows if you are sincere on that because he's our audience praise the Lord our worship is on to him and like the scripture says unto Him the gathering of the people will be so this unto him that we are gathered now some time ago we had a sick issued in church and brother fell off in church and pretty soon everybody I mean most especially some of the brothers the sisters there were you know medically inclined went to help the situation but the part of it that I wanted to address and I was hoping to take my time to address it was how we deal with the children praise the Lord when we have a situation like that it's an uproar in church you know it's not something that is suspected in church but we must be able to handle the children we have to know that every spirit I mean every sickness is an evil spirit praise the Lord amen and we must be able to protect our children from those things and pretty soon all the little children was down there trying to see what was happening there was not decent parents is our responsibility it's our responsibility we must not have those things happening this is this is the Church of the Living God and like the scripture says is only the sick that needs a physician so for the matter of fact what I am wearing a necktie or net I come here I'm sick I'm needing the great physician to help me every one of us we have one need or another praise the Lord we don't have a card out there that tell people to fill up and tell them tell us about their situation your medical condition before they come in church we don't have that why because we believe there is a bombing dealer amen there's a bombing dealer there's a great physician among the people we believe that the shout of the King is in the camp praise the Lord and we have seen God moving in different ways and doing the things that please him but you see this is that thing if we if we can just have those those you know simple respect and things you know in a book of quarantine I was thinking about that last night Paul said to the church he says this we are put in other when I come now for something to get in order they have to be at this other praise the Lord amen I knew every every one of us were surprised by what happened I thought that was not the best time to address it and but it was something that needed to be addressed even when we come to praying for the sake when someone come up to be pray for because the praying praying for the sake is just casting our spirit you know when when their spirit leaves the person that evil spirit leaves the person the medical science gave them nice name but they are demons no matter what name the medical science might give them their demons by the scripture they were called Devils you see that's the reason why we labor we try to do the best that we can to be able to keep a good atmosphere in this place amen it's not a place for eating if you want to feed the Tri take them back to the cry room praise the Lord or god bless you thank you for everything that you do to help us save the Lord the best way we can okay let's continue right here in this so you have to be watch and then let me take this scripture quickly and then I can be able to find a place here too Exeter chapter 40 Exodus chapter 40 let's do this together now I have I have exited chapter 40 on mine now in my notes but I place it there in it in a different order and I will show you that when when we read they're together Exeter chapter 40 let's read from verse one and the Lord speak unto Moses saying on the first day of the first month there shall set of the tabernacle or the tents of the congregation and thou shalt put there in the Ark of the testimony and cover the ark with evil on a land deal in your mind and thou shalt break in the table and set in other the things that are to be set in order upon it and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamp there off and thou shalt set the author of gold upon the incense before the Ark of the type of testimony and put and put the hanging of the dog to the tabernacle on the line though in your mind and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering they're there for the burnt offering before sorry the door of the tabernacle of the tank of the congregation and thou shalt set the lover before the tent of the congregation and the altar and shall forth water they aim down the lava was the one that washed their feet before they just go right into the tabernacle now so but as you read this what a beautiful year is is Moses's ending this exeter talking about a tabernacle and the order of the tabernacle but see the beauty the beauty God instructed Moses and his instructed Moses to set the tabernacle from the inside outside do you notice that amen he's setting up the tabernacle and he's telling Moses that when the tabernacle is set up it must be set up from the inside outside is a tithe and a sign that God these with the individual from the inside outside praise the Lord it's miss it's not the works of the flesh amen and you will realize there are three doors to the tabernacle amen the first door is avail the second one is a door with coatings that tear one is a gate praise the Lord now you tell me these three doors is three entries which one is difficult a veil a dog and a gate a gate is difficult there's this flesh get you have bars and iron fresh the Lord if you strong maybe a little bit stronger than me you can step that door open any will we shove caused the door it was not actually a door like this it was just a doorway with cottage and then the veil was a flesh of badgers king that was what was behind that was what was surrounding the Ark of the Covenant it was a flesh of badgers king praise the Lord but yet in a way that God to Moses inserting of this Tabernacle he gave him an order that looks like the reverse why because as humans as we deal with one another we look at the aquapod but when God biess with a man he deals with him from the inward part because when the heart is not converted no matter how you try to conform your flesh so God start setting the tabernacle from the inside he start dealing with your heart he start making you conscious of his word it's not conforming to church is being conscious of God's Word that there is a living God so it's from inside out that he deals with the man so now we see the lover is death that is for the footwork so you see when he comes from watching watching being watched by the Prophet and an address he had to walk a distance to the tabernacle so when he gets to his feet is dead it now he has to watch it because Israel was was was taught how to keep the tabernacle cleaning I mean it was all about centrifugation it was all about holiness holy holy on to the law so he had to do a fourth watch now this this watch that Moses watched the priesthood it was not a dealer watch I mean it was not a dealer watch it was a one time watch when a man is called into the priests hole but of watching of the feet was a dealer watch every time they come to do sacrifice they have to wash their feet before they go into the tabernacle until Israel took it as a tradition at their homes you remember the foot wash flunky and man I was employed to be right there and wash and wash the people feet amen when that woman that came whipping at Jesus feet because he saw that she his feet was not watch and it was a sense of welcome when you are welcome back bye bye bye your hosts they wash your feet they take out your your garment because it's dusted they put a rub on you and then you go right into the hole so Israel took that as a tradition from the tabernacle order and it became a way of life for them are we together now so that was what Jesus was referring to when he told Simon that he that is watch kneeling there to be watching himself his feet why because it represents our daily walk before the Lord our daily walk before the Lord when we accept the Lord Jesus and confess him by faith and being baptized identify with his body in water baptism we don't need it again praise the Lord unless it was not done scripturally are we together but we we all need the constant feet watch or is not bringing a bucket to your house every day to watch your feet we are watch by the water of the word because the word brings is cleansing I went together praise the Lord's in John chapter 15 now remember now is in John chapter 13 Jesus speaking to the disciples he says he are all clean but not all because he knew one will be true him praise the Lord Amen and I was I would speak on that a little bit why we keep talking about the communion here you see we try to encourage our self to walk in the light of the scripture are we together amen praise the Lord and just like I testified to you the last time we have seen many that has been healed and people that has I mean that has gained victory in certain area of their walk with Christ just by taking their ball step and identifying themselves with the word and also I've seen people I tried to make fun of that getting in the worst condition of their Christian walk praise the Lord I knew you're a young lady that was struggling with drinking amen and really never got totally deliverer of the habit praise the Lord let me tell you something this word of God is blessed this word is anointed God has already said my word we never go back or never go out and return to me praise the Lord so there is an anointing that backs the word amen and if our hearts are not right if we are not sincere I have seen people struggling I mean I talked to people in my office and we're talking and I said look if you were just be sincere with God and take this thing and take this thing before the Lord and say Lord I come out identify myself with your word because I know you are the healer I know you are the deliverer I've seen them walking in victory why because God would back his word and I've seen people that just try to play Church and just try to play you know and just try to be a part you must understand what you're doing praise the Lord don't go to church because you just want to go to church you must understand what they believe you must understand what this came for you must understand what they are doing praise the Lord as you just find yourself in a place that is I mean it's just there you know what I mean they're just there for whatever it is are we together and if you think there's a place where we are stepping out of the scripture bring it let's talk about it we want to walk in the light of truth amen now so let's look at this now sin joint chapter 15 verse 3 Jesus is year 15 3 now here a claim true the word wish and her spoken unto you praise the Lord amen so there he he speaks on to the disciples he told Peter if I don't watch you you don't have no part with me praise the Lord he says all not only my feet wash my entire body Jesus ain't know what I'm doing on to you is a type of the lavish washing you are just about to enter into your ministry and I realized this was just before Jesus will leave so the responsibility of the church is now on the shoulders of the Apostles they are not about to take over the ministry so Jesus is empowering them he's watching them for them to enter the tabernacle just our offering service that is the reason why he and John they can walk to the gate of beautiful and tell them a silver and gold we have no but what we have we give you in the name of Jesus rise up and walk because they were watch to go right into service praise the Lord I don't I don't you know I don't hum to people but I just believe that these are these are scriptural biblical principle sometimes we put everything into the work of the individual no man is saved by works amen what we need we need God's grace to help us to obey God's Word praise the Lord there is another principle that comes up instant first John chapter 1 first John is before the book of Revelation let's go there if you can't get on time just follow the reading that the brothers and sisters will put up for us first John first John chapter one so leave you a little bit here let's read from verse five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin now Jesus had just told the disciples that the words that I have spoken unto you have cleanse you praise the Lord but here John is also saying for us to have assets to the blood to be cleansed by the blood you know the church were today we claim the blood we bathe ourself in the blood in and in and we rebuke the devil with the blood of Jesus Christ and we say all of those things just just just ask a mentor talk but yes the structure of principle if we walk in the light and what is the light the Word of God is the life the Word of God revealed is the light of God David said your word is a light unto my path if we walk in the light as he is in the light as God is revealing it as God is revealing his word when we walk in the light of God's Word then the scripture says the blood cleanses us amen the blood cleanses us it's just like when Adam and Eve seen in the beginning God came down the Bible says he took a lamb slay the lamb and took their fake lives of them and rub them in their lamps King go when I allowed them to go from his presence until they had a blood that was speaking on their behalf so as Adam and Eve will be walking away from the presence of God that blood of the Lamb will be drop him speaking mercy speaking and that's what John is saying here when we walk in the line when we walk in obedience to God's Word then the blood cleans his paws amen praise the Lord so we see being watched by the water by the word by the blood he all comes to one thing I mean it all comes to one thing it all comes bring us back to the Word of God obeying the Word of God are we together I have a code out there I wanted to share with you praise the Lord oh yeah they becoming us to fulfill all righteousness see Aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be watched with water therefore when Jesus before he could be anointed as our high priest he was watched with water and then anointed and then and they're not anointing or Paul upon him to anoint him like Aaron was anointing with oil he was anointed with the Holy Ghost for John bare wrecker seen the Spirit of God discerning like a dog and going upon him and a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to do it so the Bible said that Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost went about doing good things praise the Lord amen he was born the word because the scripture says a virgin shall conceive that is the Word of God for the word needed to be anointed to go into service praise the Lord are we together and there sometimes that is the place where is hard for many of us to be able to reconcile what happened on the river Jordan and sometimes it's difficult it brings many of us to the place were we struggle in we don't know understand John said before I saw Allah a dog coming out of heaven upon him to anoint him praise the Lord it's hard for many to even believe that Jesus received the Holy Ghost but the scripture said it The Book of God said it praise the Lord and well yeah we struggle with all teachings the border was just a vessel the bother was a vessel that was produced by the word because the scripture says a virgin shall conceive that was the word amen and in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God so in some form that word was God amen but not in totality are we together not in totality because the word without the Spirit it will not be able to carry out his commission and we together so the word needed to be anointed when it came at a time where John ministry has ended and he must leave the same the Messiah needed to come on the scene and then he was anointed to go right into service healing the sick raising the dead praise the Lord there is a reason why there will be no record that will record Jesus opening the blind eyes raising the dead before Johnny there is no record there is no record of him healing the sick before Jordan his ministry started our Jordan in after Jordan when John said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I went together praise the Lord you know Wednesday night we spoke on the blind man at the pool that Jesus spit on the ground and and and and and put some clay in his head and told him to go and watch the Bible says the name of the pool was sin and Jesus sent him to go and watch and like I said Wednesday night I thought about it the man is already blind you pour clay on his eyes and you said he should go and watch how is he going praise the Lord but that's when God want us to take a step of faith believing on his finished work that's when he want us to take step of faith now holding to a church crutches a hole into a religious King we must be able to take a step of faith and say God have said it he said go and watch and a man found his way whichever way he got down there he got to the pool and he watches eyes and the scripture says he started to see man appearing in his eyes like trees now how can you come to that man like the Pharisees and tell that man that Jesus had a devil he told him he's a being here all of this when I bought right in your hands I never seen a man that make a blind see if he said that well he's a good devil praise the Lord so you see that is the reason why we encourage to read our Bible and prayed every day because and in any affiliation with the word is a form of watching every time you interact with the word if you take the word as a meditation on your you are watching your mind from all the negative talks and all their unclaimed Thompson that goes around every fall every time you interact with the word it's a form of watching praise the Lord you see because the the major above has already been done amen by your confession of faith and accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and being identified with him in Baptism there are major above has already been done and now give you faith to enter out with the word praise the Lord because faith cometh by hearing the word and every time as you feed on the word what are you listening to it on the radio or you read your Bible I mean it's a form of watching it cleans our minds to change our desire they give us what we want a closer walk with God praise the Lord amen watch by the water of the world musicians you can come forth praise the Lord a man running away from the presence of the Lord we love you more than our family we love you more than I will our wife we love the Lord Jesus now more than our children our father mother sister brother husband why we love you Lord Jesus make that so real in our hearts Lord pour in the oil of gladness this week Lord in our soul give us a bath in a watching of the water by the word of God dividing unto us the truth praise the Lord that's what we want we want to love him [Music] amen that's what we do that's what we do that's all we encourage our self to do to walk in truth walk in truth is not a self-righteousness it's not a you know one practicing religion it's falling in love with God loving God with all of our heart all of our mind all of our strength and as you walk earnestly in a little of truth that you know you walk in that light his blood keep placing you and you grow from grace to grace praise the Lord [Music] we can take an emotional message and and and get you all right up and and and and shouting you know and streaming to the top of your voice [Music] praise the Lord but you know you can that you can only jump as high as you can lace praise the Lord [Music] if the Lord give us grace who a time goes by we would look into a lot of the tabernacle things we shall all types of our day but I would tell you last night as I was sitting at my table studying when I read that I exited chapter 40 it reminded me of something and it came so beautiful I never saw like I've ever seen it I know I've said it a lot of places before but to just see it that God was Charlie Moses because if you go back to Exeter in the same Exeter from the building of the tabernacle is the auto car that was set first and then the holy place next and then the holiest of holy but then God was telling Moses this is my right order this is my order the tabernacle is set from e2 out because that's how he D with us praise the Lord like I said Wednesday night if God can touch your heart if God can can can deal with your heart if God cannot deal with your heart there is no way you can get away from a habit there is no way you can get away from from anything you struggling in this flesh you can go on you can go on on a resolution you can go on the practice you can go on the twelfth day plan 24th day play but let God knocks at your heart and you open the heart door to him [Music] you see how the changing power of God praise the Lord now same power when he said let there be light and light was able to separate darkness and product less into a place that same power will come through your life praise the Lord I'm telling you God will deliver you and you will even ask yourself you will not find a way to go back to your habit because when God deliver he does not leave a trace [Music] let's sing this hymn together whoa are you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord amen it's a good thing to know that we have a constant watching we have a constant I to me every time you take you read that word of God mix it with faith say Lord I believe your word as you're watching is your cleansing it's going to help you it's going to strengthen you in your walk with God praise the Lord it's strange that many times we come to the communion sometimes people would love to stay away because the thing that you know maybe they don't want to be part of it that night for one reason or another but don't stay away even if you don't want to be part come and pray with those that are being found praise the Lord Amen because just being in his presence this morning feeding on the Word of God and realized that the word is watching us
