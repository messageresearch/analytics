[2:44] a man so praise the Lord we're gonna go
[2:49] right to prayer tonight I just heard my
[2:55] boys I guess we've got a 60-second delay
[3:02] States both Steve Cassidy just wanna let
[3:06] you know that I got your voicemail our
[3:08] brother an interviewee had a couple of
[3:11] interviews for a job for prime
[3:13] therapeutics
[3:15] I guess he found out
[3:18] they decided not to fill that position
[3:20] deciding on another direction so I
[3:23] believe the Lord decided there was a
[3:26] different direction so let's just
[3:27] remember about steam press best even
[3:30] woods also looking for work and also for
[3:33] the aerial and just I remember that
[3:36] those three brothers in prayer also one
[3:41] of my colleagues at work Kerry Ganzer
[3:45] one of my buyers she told me before she
[3:48] left work today that her dad his name is
[3:51] Larry she found out that he and a couple
[3:56] of the symptoms he had a fever and
[3:59] diarrhea and so she was gonna go and see
[4:04] him this evening and we just needed to
[4:07] remember him in prayer he's um he's in
[4:09] his mid-80s and he's had heart issues
[4:12] and so all smooth what he just been
[4:16] really picking on people elderly and
[4:19] have different conditions so we just
[4:23] want to lift him up in prayer tonight
[4:25] perhaps you have someone who's not
[4:28] feeling well perhaps there is a burden
[4:31] on your heart for a loved one let's just
[4:35] go right to prayer tonight look just let
[4:37] the Lord know once again by an uplifting
[4:39] hand you have something special because
[4:41] he sees those hands that's brother
[4:44] Branham said he says we defy gravity by
[4:47] raising our hand to acknowledge that we
[4:51] have a need God allows us to have a part
[4:54] in this great drama by urging us to
[4:58] bring our cares and casting them on him
[5:01] so let's just borrow its Heavenly Father
[5:04] Lord just wants you put aside the
[5:08] activities of the day and just seems
[5:11] like in my own mind just things whirling
[5:13] back and forth and pray that you'd
[5:15] settle my Sabir Lord tonight Lord Jesus
[5:18] and as we gather around your table
[5:21] tonight
[5:22] Oh father Lord there's a place of rest
[5:28] and it's in your presence Lord Jesus
[5:32] Oh Lord so Lord we just want to gather
[5:37] in your presence Lord Jesus that you
[5:40] could just speak to our hearts tonight

[5:45] Steven woods you want to pray for
[5:47] brother Ariel we also have a good friend
[5:52] of the Omi's her husband Brian needs a
[5:56] job we just want to lift him up to you
[5:58] to your Lord father

[6:05] there Lord Father we pray for Carey's
[6:08] dad Larry she's a wonderful daughter to
[6:13] him and she wants to make sure he's okay
[6:15] so Lord I told her that we'd be praying
[6:19] for him so Lord do you know him he's a
[6:22] Christian man too so I know he believes
[6:24] that you're still a healer too so we
[6:27] want to put our little licks of fire and

[25:02] with the organ and tonight I wonder I
[25:12] want for us to look at something and
[25:16] appreciate many of you coming on for the
[25:19] service on Sunday but what I want to do
[25:24] tonight we may not be able to get
[25:28] through everything being in a Wednesday
[25:30] night but we want to just go over some
[25:33] few things here
[25:34] so let's just start with a reading a
[25:42] quart of blood Branham and then I will
[25:45] introduce what I want to I want to speak
[25:47] on tonight and so you can be able to
[25:50] have you know a thought of where we are
[25:54] going what shall I do with Jesus 1963
[26:01] and he said the dynamics of this church
[26:09] will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[26:16] the dynamics of this church which mean
[26:20] this last is church this rapture in
[26:24] church will be the refilling of the Holy
[26:29] Spirit that we have we have worked in a
[26:34] small measure why the hair stone is
[26:39] coming
[26:40] to unite with the body but when that
[26:46] head and the body you nice together the
[26:49] full power of the Holy Ghost will rise
[26:53] her up just exactly like Amen so yeah we
[27:01] have a promise that it's telling us that
[27:08] the dynamics of this church and we will
[27:11] look some other few coats what Bourbon
[27:16] says we have the mechanics you know we
[27:19] have the mechanics and and and science
[27:22] us has made us more guilty because they
[27:25] have given it to us in every phone you
[27:29] know on our cell phones on our iPads we
[27:33] have it on every phone you know so we
[27:36] have we have the mechanics but we need
[27:39] the dynamics to be able to click in that
[27:43] word praise the Lord
[27:45] so we will talk a little bit tonight and
[27:48] any reason why we we spoke on some of
[27:57] the things we talked about Sunday I will
[27:59] show you a little bit here let's read
[28:02] the word and we will just aim if you
[28:06] stand in your home if not that's okay
[28:09] praise the Lord
[28:11] fill John chapter 7 Saint John chapter 7
[28:20] praise the Lord thank you for careful
[28:23] lady not seen his present praise tonight
[28:44] praise the Lord sin John chapter 7 let's
[28:48] look at verse 37 the scripture says and
[28:56] we read in the last day that great day
[29:01] of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[29:06] saying if any man thirst let him come
[29:11] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[29:16] me as the scripture have said out of his
[29:22] belly shall flow rivers of water but
[29:29] this he speak but this speaking of the
[29:35] Spirit which they that believe on him
[29:38] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[29:42] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[29:46] yet glorified Philippians chapter 1 you
[29:54] can have your seat while we read that
[29:59] order Philippians chapter 1
[30:13] so tonight a little bit we want to talk
[30:15] on what we will we will title tonight
[30:25] the flooring of the Holy Spirit let's
[30:28] look at Philippians chapter 1 yeah you
[30:30] can have your seat that's it
[30:32] thank you
[31:00] let's reverse 12 Philippine chapter 1
[31:16] but I who issue understand presence they
[31:21] are the things which happen unto me have
[31:26] fallen out rather on to the furtherance
[31:29] of the gospel so that my balance in
[31:33] Christ are manifested in all the
[31:39] policies in in all all the places and
[31:43] many of the Brethren in the Lord
[31:46] waxing confidence by my bounds a much
[31:50] more bored to speak the world without
[31:53] feeling let's drop down to verse 19 for
[31:59] I know that this shall turn to my
[32:05] salvation through your prayers and the
[32:10] supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ
[32:15] let's pray father we just want to commit
[32:20] law the the service in your hand so god
[32:23] I prayed then you will just take the
[32:26] word now father and bless it come and
[32:29] break it to our house tonight we love
[32:31] you Father and we just appreciate your
[32:34] goodness law that we can have this
[32:37] opportunity father to be gathered around
[32:39] your word to build our faith Lord we
[32:43] love you
[32:43] so we commit our self in your hands in
[32:46] Jesus name Amen
[32:48] praise the Lord I was just looking at
[32:51] another scripture just before I was
[32:56] called there's over in Jude Jude on the
[33:01] one chapter we will read verse 20 but
[33:08] yeah Brad wins bill up yourself on your
[33:13] most holy faith praying in the Holy
[33:17] Ghost Amy now so that's what we want to
[33:21] do we want to build up our most holy
[33:23] faith brother Branham said this in
[33:25] adoption message 1960 he said
[33:30] and this is what we're trying to do that
[33:33] kind of four letters to speak on some of
[33:35] the things that we spoke on them on
[33:37] Sunday he says this he says God trying
[33:42] to place his church in position to
[33:47] manifest himself that is the reason why
[33:51] we're Branham says Adam was giving the
[33:54] bride to reproduce himself so Christ was
[33:58] also the second Adam was also giving the
[34:01] bride to reproduce himself so for God to
[34:05] do that he has to put his church in
[34:08] other praise Lord he had to gather us
[34:12] from all our you know our our family
[34:21] background he has gathered from all our
[34:24] trash church tradition and even when we
[34:28] come to the message of the hour you know
[34:31] he has to just put us in place this is
[34:34] God trying to place his church in
[34:36] position to manifest himself getting one
[34:40] there he can work through like this
[34:46] saying there's my spirit flowing
[34:51] Freeling God want to get that man you
[34:56] want to get that woman where he can say
[34:59] they my spirit flow freely
[35:03] that is an EDM position praise the Lord
[35:07] that is an Eden position there is what
[35:14] we Accord home and yes that's the place
[35:17] that he's bringing us a place where he
[35:19] can get and says there my spirit flow
[35:23] freely now you as would think about this
[35:27] okay let's just read a little bit here
[35:29] trying to get ahead of myself here there
[35:34] it is he says there I can work here and
[35:39] he would get another one over here and
[35:42] place him
[35:43] I can place him adoption placing
[35:47] manifesting they all the same praise the
[35:50] Lord Amen the manifestation of the sons
[35:54] of God is the adoption of the sons of
[35:56] God praise the Lord you know I'm just
[36:04] I'm caught up in myself a little bit let
[36:08] me share something with you yeah
[36:11] Genesis chapter 1 let's go to Genesis
[36:14] chapter 1
[36:33] Genesis chapter 1 verse 3 Genesis
[36:40] chapter 1 verse 3 the scripture says and
[36:49] God said let there be light
[36:55] praise the Lord
[36:57] and God said let there be light
[37:03] now when God said let there be light he
[37:11] spoke the word amen but the word that he
[37:18] spoke was not light it was the word but
[37:25] when the word was manifest then there
[37:28] was light
[37:31] praise the Lord
[37:35] God said let there be light he said it
[37:38] and there was light that was the
[37:42] manifestation we read there we read
[37:46] something on
[38:01] on Sunday I want to get back to that a
[38:04] little bit he says brother branham said
[38:16] it I kind of wrote it down in my note
[38:20] here he says you know the word he says
[38:30] the word manifested is the light when
[38:36] you see it prays alone so the word until
[38:42] the word it's manifested that's when it
[38:45] becomes the light but when he when the
[38:49] word is spoken it's out of God's mouth
[38:51] but when that word is now manifested and
[38:55] it says when God made a promise you know
[38:59] he gave us a promise that is his word
[39:02] but when that promise comes to pass then
[39:06] that is the light of the word that he
[39:10] has said praise the Lord amen
[39:18] so we go back to our court again I was
[39:21] reading this and it just come in mind
[39:23] you came through my mind their
[39:25] absorption placing manifesting take him
[39:29] out here that's God speaking down
[39:31] talking to a son or a daughter
[39:33] take him out here and put a ceremony on
[39:36] him and Alber been him called their
[39:38] ceremony this in him with an injury tell
[39:42] him something that's how God does
[39:46] ceremony that's that's the that's the
[39:48] adoption ceremony give him or her
[39:51] spiritual dreams praise the Lord
[39:57] now you see where Brennan he he
[40:01] demonstrated these this spiritual
[40:04] adoption in in in so much that sometimes
[40:08] our mind is so caught up in the in in
[40:12] the
[40:13] physical things that he talks about but
[40:16] for the church we have to realize there
[40:18] is that is a spiritual thing just like
[40:22] when the prodigal son came back home
[40:24] amen
[40:26] when he came back home remember now the
[40:29] father was always looking over for him
[40:33] the father was thinking about him in the
[40:36] father mind my son will come back home
[40:39] amen but when the Sun came that was
[40:43] light that's why the father was
[40:45] rejoicing because his thought has been
[40:48] manifested amen
[40:52] so to death manifested Todd the father
[40:55] is now putting him before everybody you
[40:58] know getting the best rock making the
[41:00] feasts and everything now brother
[41:01] branham is saying here God is putting us
[41:05] to the place all of these things that
[41:07] he's bringing us true is to place us to
[41:11] the place where he can say dare my
[41:14] spirit flow freely now it is net we will
[41:18] never get to the place of sinless
[41:20] perfection the place where he's breaking
[41:23] us is at a place word we can be able to
[41:26] step aside and let the word has
[41:31] preeminence where we will not struggle
[41:35] with the word our struggle you know we
[41:37] when we know that is our own thoughts
[41:41] and our own desire we can lay it aside
[41:44] and let God word have the preeminence
[41:48] he's looking for their son their
[41:51] daughter where he can see their my
[41:53] spirit flow freely praise the Lord he
[41:57] said there it is I can work in years he
[42:00] get another one over year and he plays
[42:03] him I can place him adoption place him
[42:05] manifestation take him out here and put
[42:09] a ceremony on him visit him with an
[42:11] angel tell him something now if he told
[42:15] the truth now if he's just making up
[42:20] something it won't work who is he
[42:23] talking about that son
[42:26] if the Sun is saying the truth what is
[42:28] the truth saying what the word says
[42:31] praise the Lord
[42:33] if he's just making up something and
[42:35] trying to support it with code brother
[42:37] branham said brother Branham say brother
[42:39] Branham say and not saying what the word
[42:42] says if he's just making up something it
[42:47] won't work
[42:50] that won't work we have got a lot of
[42:55] that phrase alone but I mean
[43:00] manifestation of the sons of God when
[43:04] God manifests himself and he sent him
[43:07] out praise the Lord I would just I was
[43:13] just reading the scripture as I was
[43:16] thinking about this and listening into
[43:21] something - yes that that's a beautiful
[43:23] story being in a book of art if I only
[43:29] stay on this that would be okay but I
[43:32] have to get my thoughts together that's
[43:34] a beautiful story there in a book of ads
[43:36] you think about it when they were going
[43:40] to call the church was going to to to
[43:45] call men to be deacons praise the Lord
[43:49] the Bible says they saw the need and he
[43:53] said let's choose men that afford of the
[43:56] Holy Ghost
[43:57] praise the Lord now and some of these
[44:00] men that he choose they were actually
[44:04] preachers Phillip was a preacher he was
[44:08] an evangelist and Stephen as well but
[44:15] you think about Phillip year choosing
[44:19] him as a deacon and what was their work
[44:23] to be able to take care of the widows
[44:26] and distribute food you know and just
[44:28] just just to be able to help the Apostle
[44:32] says so we can give ourselves to praying
[44:34] and in the word now and if you if you
[44:39] realize no one who actually look and see
[44:43] that you know what because I mean the
[44:47] the scripture did not give us a lot of
[44:49] details but you will see there from the
[44:52] way that God there with this man look at
[44:54] feeling let's let's just take Philip for
[44:57] instance he was one of these D comes in
[45:01] a green evangelist the Scripture speaks
[45:05] of him being a very great evangelist but
[45:10] he was attaining to the needs of the
[45:14] believers I believe now only the widows
[45:17] and all the people he was also helping
[45:20] the young people he was also doing all
[45:22] of this and God was preparing him now in
[45:26] Philip mind he knew he had a call and
[45:30] and he was trying to bring his ministry
[45:32] out in those different ways but watching
[45:35] see because the little things that he
[45:40] was doing God used that to train him the
[45:45] next time we will see Philip in the
[45:48] Bible will be at a time word God will
[45:51] lead him by the spirit praise the Lord
[45:55] now if he did not learn to hear the
[45:58] voice of God in those little things how
[46:01] would he have known when God was sending
[46:03] him in a desert to meet an Ethiopian
[46:06] inner how would he have known I mean he
[46:10] would be confused you know better
[46:12] Brandon talks the story about the plane
[46:14] comes down and he want to go and put
[46:16] some mail and something is just telling
[46:18] him go down the street it just not so
[46:21] easy for you to understand the
[46:23] leadership of God until you a dream you
[46:27] must be trained to hear the voice of the
[46:29] Spirit and in the little things that he
[46:35] tells us to do that's where he treats us
[46:40] and because God was so pleased with the
[46:45] little things their faithfulness that
[46:48] Philip was doing he had a gift he was a
[46:50] preacher just as
[46:52] Peter was a preacher he was a preacher
[46:55] just as James was a preacher well you
[47:00] see he was not struggling for the puppet
[47:02] he was carrying out his ministry in
[47:04] another way on a training form and God
[47:08] trained him with that until he could
[47:11] hear the voice of the Spirit go away in
[47:13] the wilderness he never even went to the
[47:16] temple gate where there are people he
[47:18] went to the will and that's why there
[47:20] was nobody and he just they're standing
[47:25] up okay Lord I'm here I'm one of them
[47:30] I'm one up to him he's just standing up
[47:33] thinking his son by himself and here's
[47:36] the make I'm the reason why he was
[47:38] carried out there by the spirit here
[47:41] comes the Europeana
[47:43] why because he was streamed to hear the
[47:48] voice of God they that wait upon the
[47:51] Lord he shall renew their strength
[47:54] praise the Lord he learned to wait on
[47:57] God that he has strength enough to wait
[48:00] on God when nothing was happening when
[48:02] nobody was right around he quit until
[48:06] God will bring to pass what he wanted
[48:10] him to do praise the Lord he saw the man
[48:15] coming I don't you know I don't believe
[48:18] Phillip Jesse stop stop stop stop he
[48:21] just stand right there
[48:22] he said how do you understanding while
[48:24] you're reading because he knew he could
[48:29] feed the poor just like John Kofi the
[48:33] pool when Jesus was coming in a water he
[48:35] could feed a boat that's the man and you
[48:38] understanding while you're reading it
[48:41] may just slow down the charity yeah oh
[48:44] no and I just believe that man also
[48:49] could see there how did he know I was
[48:51] reading how did he know I was reading
[48:56] just like brother Branham walking down
[48:59] there you know and and and and and and
[49:02] and all warm I said how I possum it's
[49:05] there should be the reason why God
[49:07] brought me down here how does she know I
[49:09] was a preacher there my spirit flow
[49:14] freely praise the Lord the air my spirit
[49:20] flow freely you see because the thing
[49:23] about it just like we read him Jesus
[49:28] said in this promise you know God even
[49:32] before the Holy Ghost was giving he's
[49:35] promising he's he's promising his church
[49:38] you know what the Holy Ghost will be to
[49:42] the believers out of your belly
[49:45] will flow you see the Holy Ghost is
[49:50] giving to be give out that's what the
[49:55] Holy Ghost is giving for Toby give out
[49:58] you see we we I mean I you know we I was
[50:05] telling somebody you know we want to be
[50:08] stingy with this Holy Ghost I mean we
[50:13] just we just get so concerned about our
[50:15] needs all I need to do this oh oh god I
[50:18] need a Holy Ghost for this in my life
[50:20] the Holy Ghost is giving you see
[50:22] actually we are not reservoirs we are
[50:27] China for the spirit to flow through
[50:30] I mean verbatim says God is placing us
[50:38] so he can say not there my spirit stay
[50:42] there but spirit flow freely it's to
[50:46] flow I mean it's to flow freely and
[50:56] that's what he's doing all of these
[50:58] things now you just think about it now
[51:00] he he he places I was talking to one
[51:03] older sister today then she would just
[51:06] check in on meaning you know any I mean
[51:08] we were just were just talking I mean
[51:11] they don't have you know internet
[51:15] privileges and
[51:17] so far so I mean you have to read their
[51:19] Bible they have to re message boxing you
[51:23] know they don't have a lot of the
[51:25] benefit that we have you know I mean if
[51:28] they have internet they have to pay for
[51:29] data and it's it's a bit expensive there
[51:32] so we were just talking and and I just
[51:36] feel like she's you know she she needed
[51:38] to be encouraged a little bit you know
[51:40] and I was telling her some of these
[51:41] things you know how God has prepared us
[51:45] for this hour we don't have a fire
[51:51] furnished like the Hebrew boys we don't
[51:52] have a lion den this is our time this is
[51:56] God placing us in this situation to
[51:59] bring the best out of us to bring the
[52:04] best out of his sons and daughter just
[52:06] like Daniel in his days just like shared
[52:09] ramesha Ben and Abednego just like Paul
[52:12] in the praising he's putting us allowing
[52:14] us to go through this situation to bring
[52:17] the best out of his children there my
[52:21] spirit flow freely and he continued but
[52:27] I mean manifestation of the sons of God
[52:31] when God manifests himself and sent him
[52:35] out and then he goes for and what he
[52:38] said is true
[52:40] what he does is truth what he does he
[52:46] manifests Christ now you see that he's
[52:49] using all of these heads and what he
[52:52] says and what he does and sometimes it's
[52:55] so easy for it to be kept in the line of
[52:58] the ministry or for a preacher no is it
[53:02] it's just it's for the entire body I
[53:07] mean it's for the entire body I'll come
[53:10] back to that code let's drop a little
[53:11] bit Pergamos Church he says this awesome
[53:15] he said God speak to his messenger the
[53:19] messengers speak to the leaders and and
[53:23] then that's what take place
[53:26] he keeps the messenger in him alight in
[53:31] God so Bob the messenger and the people
[53:34] alike in God for what reason the holy
[53:38] spirit flowing true the group of them so
[53:42] one person is therefore speaking his
[53:45] position of speaking is not greater than
[53:47] the position of hearing praise the Lord
[53:52] I mean it will just be so confusing if
[53:55] the ears could talk as the mouth praise
[54:01] the Lord it would be confusing God have
[54:03] the mouth to talk he has a year to
[54:05] listen and not just how his body is but
[54:09] the purple is for the Holy Ghost to flow
[54:12] through the group of them both the
[54:15] messenger and the leading there my
[54:23] spirit flow freely let's come back to
[54:25] our colleague in what he does he
[54:27] manifests Christ how do you judge him by
[54:32] the way he stays with the word how you
[54:36] Josh dad adopted son that adopted
[54:40] daughter the one that God is putting in
[54:42] position by the way they stay with the
[54:46] word now about their emotion by the way
[54:49] that they stay with the word by the way
[54:59] he stayed with the word right with the
[55:02] word seed that's how you know all men is
[55:06] by the way he stays with the word that's
[55:10] how you know every son of God every
[55:13] daughter of God by the way they stayed
[55:15] with the word because the word corrects
[55:19] our errors amen
[55:22] so even if we we strayed from the word
[55:26] what brings us back to the world it's a
[55:29] spirit by the way he stays or she stays
[55:32] with the word if they speak not
[55:37] according to the word there is no life
[55:40] in them since the Bible see leave them
[55:44] a way praise the Lord amen
[55:48] so let me let me flip over a little bit
[55:51] here Paul over in a boat of Philippine
[55:54] years you have to remember there Paul
[55:56] wrote this letter to the brothers over
[55:59] in in Phillip out there when he was
[56:04] imprisoned in Rome
[56:06] this man was impressing and and
[56:12] everything that he was going through
[56:13] there in Rome and he's writing a letter
[56:18] to these believers there are some few
[56:21] things that he brought out here that are
[56:23] very very important he's encouraging
[56:27] them and telling them the different
[56:28] things he's hearing and how you know
[56:32] there was something he said that really
[56:34] caught my mind here I mean over there in
[56:38] verse 19 let's read that again
[56:46] there my spirit flow freely fresh Lord
[56:54] sometimes it's just good to catch
[56:57] ourself and acts ourselves you know what
[57:00] whatever you are doing is that spirit
[57:02] flowing freely always that you know it's
[57:05] his is there his spirit flowing freely
[57:08] or is that just your spirit flowing
[57:10] freely amen
[57:12] he says here verse 19 for I know that
[57:16] this shall turn unto my salvation
[57:20] through your prayers and the supply of
[57:26] the Spirit of Christ now his tie in
[57:30] prayer and the supply of the Spirit of
[57:34] Christ which is the Holy Ghost Mia so
[57:37] Paul is encouraging these believers I'm
[57:40] hearing the different thing that is
[57:41] happening out there some people are
[57:43] preaching you know Christ for strive and
[57:45] different things that is happening up
[57:47] there that there is contention among the
[57:50] brothers he says but I know that you
[57:54] know this that he speaks of his
[57:56] salvation is bringing me out of this
[57:58] tuition you know true your prayers and
[58:02] the supply of the Holy Ghost now so you
[58:06] know in this in this period of time the
[58:12] one other thing that is on the minds of
[58:14] most of the believers is you know it's a
[58:17] we are really in a place world we are
[58:20] playing out the ten virgins
[58:21] you know everybody is thinking about the
[58:23] Holy Ghost I mean everybody is trying to
[58:25] make sure that they have the Holy Ghost
[58:26] everybody's you know trying to ask for a
[58:29] refilling of the Holy Ghost but like
[58:30] like we just rare bourbon and since that
[58:33] is the the dynamics of this church
[58:36] because because the Holy Spirit is to
[58:39] flow through us you can never have
[58:41] enough of the Holy Ghost you need it
[58:47] every day we are not just a bottle that
[58:53] God pour his spirit in and then he
[58:55] closed the top and and and is is just
[58:58] seal that's not the type of seal that
[59:01] Paul spoke about being sealed with the
[59:03] Holy Ghost until the day of redemption
[59:06] that's not a seal that God cannot refill
[59:09] us again because the dynamics of this
[59:13] church will be the refilling of the Holy
[59:15] Ghost and that's the thing that we're
[59:17] quick in the word in our life every day
[59:24] so you see that is the place word the
[59:28] church gets it wrong if they just keep
[59:31] the Holy Ghost to a setting experience a
[59:33] spoke in tongues when I received the
[59:35] Holy Ghost yeah you spoke in tongues but
[59:37] you need to walk right you need the Holy
[59:39] Ghost to think right you need the Holy
[59:42] Ghost to live right and we need and and
[59:45] we need to live right every day so we
[59:48] need the Holy Ghost for everything
[59:50] a refilling you see and year Paul is
[59:57] commanding these believers there and say
[1:00:00] I know that God will bring me out my
[1:00:03] salvation through your prayers and the
[1:00:06] supply of the Holy Ghost now you see
[1:00:09] that is the reason why not
[1:00:11] in the upper room how did they receive
[1:00:14] the Holy Ghost the Bible says they were
[1:00:15] in wanna call amen and why were they
[1:00:19] doing they were waiting on the promise
[1:00:21] they were praying amen that's how they
[1:00:28] received the Holy Ghost
[1:00:29] so the flow of the Spirit comes true
[1:00:32] prayer it comes true prayer a brother or
[1:00:43] a sister whenever we put a loved ones on
[1:00:47] our heart to pray for them what are we
[1:00:50] doing we are we allowing the spirit to
[1:00:53] flow through us to be able to help their
[1:00:58] brother to be able to help that sister
[1:01:02] what the brother Branham said he said
[1:01:04] when that man that brother Cao was
[1:01:07] strolling and he called the brothers
[1:01:09] what did he says he says let's find a
[1:01:12] promise identify with our promise and
[1:01:14] let the Holy Ghost go after him so God
[1:01:26] is is is bringing up a church he's
[1:01:29] bringing up a people he's training or
[1:01:32] disciplining us just for us to be a
[1:01:34] channel through which the Holy Spirit
[1:01:38] with flow he says out of your belly
[1:01:45] even before the Holy Ghost was giving he
[1:01:47] told him out of your better will flow
[1:01:49] out of your ballot will flow rivers of
[1:01:56] water praise the Lord
[1:02:04] you know the beautiful thing there when
[1:02:07] you wash there Jesus speaking to them he
[1:02:11] says as it is in the scripture as it is
[1:02:16] in the scripture referring to the Holy
[1:02:19] Ghost by pointing it out in the Old
[1:02:22] Testament so we can find types in the
[1:02:31] Old Testament where there were flowing
[1:02:35] of rivers of water when Moses smacked
[1:02:39] the rock the water came pouring out of
[1:02:45] it and the scripture says that rock that
[1:02:48] followed him was Christ and then when
[1:02:52] brother Branham talks about the five
[1:02:54] spiritual element that followed the
[1:02:57] church he says we have the smitten Rock
[1:03:00] and what is to follow the church signs
[1:03:03] and wonders so the smitten rock
[1:03:06] represents signs and wonders and then
[1:03:09] how can the church do signs and wonders
[1:03:11] if we don't have the Florine of the Holy
[1:03:14] Spirit that's what the scripture says
[1:03:22] science and wonders will follow them I
[1:03:24] believe just like the rock follow Israel
[1:03:28] it was not a rock that was rolling it
[1:03:31] was the presence of God's wonders in the
[1:03:34] camp the rock was now on two feet oh it
[1:03:39] was just rolling behind them all Aaron
[1:03:42] and Moses have to be pushing and we need
[1:03:44] to carry this rock praise the Lord it
[1:03:48] was a manifestation of God that was
[1:03:52] performing his signs and wonders that
[1:03:55] even though they were a small group but
[1:03:58] they were an invisible army no nation
[1:04:02] could bring them down because God was in
[1:04:06] a camp of his people and that is the
[1:04:09] same thing that we are facing today amen
[1:04:13] the feeling of the economy can bring us
[1:04:15] down because God is in the camp of his
[1:04:17] feet
[1:04:19] we have our braising 7 divine healing we
[1:04:24] have our smitten rod signs and wonders
[1:04:28] we have our prophet which is the message
[1:04:32] of the hour because the prophet and the
[1:04:34] messenger is at the word and the
[1:04:35] messenger is the same praise the Lord
[1:04:40] so we have all of these things and
[1:04:43] that's what makes the shout of the king
[1:04:45] is in a camp the dynamics of this church
[1:04:52] would be the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:57] the reason why we are now reaching out
[1:05:02] is because we just think that we have
[1:05:06] you know Burnham says it's just like
[1:05:08] that little fish but a scared you know
[1:05:11] in the ocean trying to drink very small
[1:05:14] water the day and hoping that you know
[1:05:17] this thing will not go dry it's right in
[1:05:21] the ocean I mean we are right in the
[1:05:23] presence of Almighty God the Creator of
[1:05:26] heaven and earth and yet instead we are
[1:05:29] trying to take his word sparingly we are
[1:05:33] trying to zip on his word and snack on
[1:05:37] his word by little up and literal days
[1:05:39] and little coat and later days we must
[1:05:42] be letting that word to flow through us
[1:05:44] I was talking to a brother last night
[1:05:47] having we're having we're having Bible
[1:05:50] studies in the church last night were
[1:05:51] scared I'm not waiting for that building
[1:05:53] to finish I'm telling you I was over
[1:05:57] there with a verb writing and burst even
[1:06:00] wounds and we were just having having
[1:06:02] some time did and you know when you know
[1:06:05] and and and the Lord is just dealing
[1:06:07] with Bob riding you know really dealing
[1:06:10] with his heart I mean he's testifying of
[1:06:12] what what I mean the Lord is helping him
[1:06:14] truly and I mean you just just almost
[1:06:17] crying last night and but but this is
[1:06:21] what is happening he's telling me he
[1:06:25] says you know he's I mean the Lord is
[1:06:26] kind of a dealing him on Christ and him
[1:06:29] crucified you know
[1:06:30] I mean he's the Lord is showing him
[1:06:33] there you have to look at what Christ
[1:06:34] have done you know which of course it's
[1:06:37] a very strong powerful revelation but
[1:06:39] scared I mean it's very very powerful
[1:06:41] you know trying to be able to receive
[1:06:47] everything through the cross and and I
[1:06:49] mean he's talking about there and then
[1:06:51] he's telling me that is it it's telling
[1:06:55] me analysis this is what you should be
[1:06:57] preaching as I say yeah I said no you
[1:07:03] supposed to be saying you know he said
[1:07:07] oh no he said to me he says this is what
[1:07:09] I should be hearing as you know you
[1:07:14] should be letting it out you know
[1:07:18] you should be letting it out God showing
[1:07:20] you that all of his redemptive blessing
[1:07:24] comes through the cross I should not
[1:07:26] tell you it again you already knows it
[1:07:28] now you go and tell and I believe that
[1:07:32] is the reason because sometimes we get
[1:07:35] so worried water you know we have all
[1:07:37] our our our ducks in the road whether we
[1:07:41] know all the dirt rain water we know you
[1:07:44] know in Auto base oh when he told us
[1:07:49] let's just talk about how the fire got
[1:07:50] life you know what God is doing in my
[1:07:56] life how he's dealing with me you and
[1:08:04] you know every time you talk about
[1:08:07] Christ you are let you I allowing that
[1:08:10] spirit to flow through praise the Lord
[1:08:15] that is the reason why Jesus would say
[1:08:17] that you left me because I mean lot of
[1:08:20] spirit high flow true
[1:08:22] he needs the refilling he got to go back
[1:08:25] to the mountains and arrest a little why
[1:08:27] for God to fill him out because we are
[1:08:34] China's we
[1:08:38] we are not reservoirs we are now bottles
[1:08:41] we are China for God's Spirit to flow
[1:08:45] through us praise the Lord
[1:08:49] amen and what's my time here now okay
[1:08:58] having a few minutes praise the Lord
[1:09:05] let's look at this together where BAM
[1:09:08] says looking unto Jesus he says Moses
[1:09:12] look one day he seen the pillar of fire
[1:09:15] and he attracted his attention this
[1:09:20] great theologian he had run with all of
[1:09:23] his geological training in his honor
[1:09:26] standing by his mother of sorry of the
[1:09:31] word itself of how there he was to
[1:09:37] deliver the children of Israel but when
[1:09:39] he tried in his way he fell when he
[1:09:45] tried in his will he was born a
[1:09:48] deliverer but how was he supposed to do
[1:09:50] it by letting the spirit to flow praise
[1:09:55] the Lord Amen now you see that is the
[1:10:00] reason why you know brother Branham said
[1:10:02] this I mean it's very beautiful as
[1:10:06] simple as it is
[1:10:07] he says when when when you feel a burden
[1:10:10] to do something he says go and do it
[1:10:13] if you feel which means God is not in it
[1:10:16] just leave it don't don't feel bad
[1:10:19] amen if God is in it if God is behind it
[1:10:23] he would bless it and as long as he keep
[1:10:25] blessing it keep doing it but if he's
[1:10:28] not blessing it take your hands of it
[1:10:32] praise the Lord
[1:10:37] so you see here at Moses he feel and you
[1:10:42] know in a dorm his mother had terribly
[1:10:46] instructed him on what to do and and
[1:10:49] what he would do
[1:10:51] and what God has raised him up for all
[1:10:55] this knowledge as good as it is and it
[1:11:01] is good but yet it had to be set off
[1:11:07] that was only mechanics oh the message
[1:11:13] the seven hundred seven seals are the
[1:11:17] knowledge of the message baptism in
[1:11:19] Jesus name
[1:11:20] wonderful doctrine we have decent saying
[1:11:23] you know all of those things are all
[1:11:26] good all mechanics we need this constant
[1:11:31] refueling for that word to live through
[1:11:34] us we need constant refueling for that
[1:11:40] word to live through us
[1:11:42] you see when that's word flow through us
[1:11:45] and our spirit flow through us you know
[1:11:48] it has a way of cleaning out the trash
[1:11:51] and leaving the real green in amen
[1:11:54] that's what we need he says there's only
[1:11:58] mechanic my kami is in what run the
[1:12:01] automobile is the dynamics that run run
[1:12:05] it amen
[1:12:06] he says back down here the mechanics
[1:12:09] don't run the church we can get the
[1:12:13] church order just like I said on Sunday
[1:12:17] brother Branham says it was God dealing
[1:12:20] with the individual that's what the
[1:12:22] church all over for we can have all of
[1:12:25] that but if it is not a revelation to
[1:12:28] the individual if God have NASA working
[1:12:31] on you as a tabernacle as a temple as a
[1:12:36] temple material I mean you will come to
[1:12:42] church and observe everything and you
[1:12:44] can even have that come on
[1:12:46] quietness in your own spirit my candid
[1:12:51] don't run the church is the dynamics is
[1:12:52] the Holy Ghost that get into this world
[1:12:56] is the Holy Ghost that quick in the
[1:12:58] world I mean
[1:13:02] what actually is the quickening power is
[1:13:05] the word Paul said in Hebrew for 12 the
[1:13:09] word is sharp and quick that's where
[1:13:12] that word quickening power is from it's
[1:13:16] sharp and quick even to the dividing
[1:13:19] asunder
[1:13:29] you
[1:13:31] turn turn on the light 1964 he said in
[1:13:36] this hour brother when we wonder what's
[1:13:40] the matter with our revival was the
[1:13:44] matter he says we got the material and
[1:13:48] everything we got the mechanics we got
[1:13:52] the word we have identified the
[1:13:55] messenger of the age we have the
[1:14:00] material we got the mechanics but word
[1:14:05] is the dynamics were is that dynamics
[1:14:10] that dynamics I will react o it over and
[1:14:13] over is refilling it's the refilling of
[1:14:20] the Holy Ghost we need it every day for
[1:14:24] is to be able to quick in the word and
[1:14:26] make his promises real to us in
[1:14:30] difficult situation in decisions that we
[1:14:33] have to make we need their refilling too
[1:14:36] quick in the word there my spirit flow
[1:14:42] freely say we got everything we got the
[1:14:45] mechanics but where is the dynamics
[1:14:46] that's what we need to move Jesus Christ
[1:14:50] in on the scene we need a dynamics we
[1:14:57] can overemphasize the importance of the
[1:15:02] Holy Ghost amen and the truth about it
[1:15:07] there is there you can keep it to one
[1:15:09] experience no you can keep it to one
[1:15:13] experience I mean that is the mistake
[1:15:16] that we made that is the mistake people
[1:15:18] make pentecost made a mistake when they
[1:15:22] talk speaking in tongues as the evidence
[1:15:24] of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and
[1:15:31] because
[1:15:32] they did their they could not see the
[1:15:35] flaw that was happening in the church
[1:15:37] they could not see when Satan came right
[1:15:39] in their mess and started speaking in
[1:15:41] tongues because witches speak in tongues
[1:15:44] as well they couldn't see that well Ram
[1:15:50] talks about honor their revival he sees
[1:15:53] the very time the Holy Ghost was coming
[1:15:55] down he says there was and there was
[1:15:56] there was a contrary spirit coming down
[1:15:58] as well because the two spirit runs in
[1:16:00] parallel they saw how many was filled
[1:16:06] with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:07] but he never also saw how many will
[1:16:09] possess with the devil if they would
[1:16:14] have kept the the evidence of the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost as a constant refilling they would
[1:16:20] have followed the move of God they would
[1:16:23] have following God left their revival
[1:16:25] and moved to another revival that would
[1:16:27] have follow it because it's a constant
[1:16:30] it's a constant flow you know just like
[1:16:36] we share on Sunday God wrapped
[1:16:38] adenine Eve in a bleeding skin because
[1:16:41] the atonement is constant we walk in the
[1:16:46] light as he is in the light every time
[1:16:49] they took a step there was blood that
[1:16:51] was dropping with every step that they
[1:16:53] were going away from God and that blood
[1:16:56] speak better things because it was a
[1:17:00] type of the Lamb of God so we need that
[1:17:06] constant floor amen
[1:17:10] that's the dynamics of this church
[1:17:13] praise the Lord Amen don't ask don't ask
[1:17:18] me whether you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:17:19] have it you just need more of it praise
[1:17:22] the Lord
[1:17:23] you just need more of it brother Branham
[1:17:25] give us a time is just like that one you
[1:17:27] get one taste of it you one more that's
[1:17:29] what people gets drunk you know that's
[1:17:33] what it gets drunk because there is just
[1:17:35] something in that fermentation
[1:17:37] you know you taste one you want more and
[1:17:40] before they realize they are speaking
[1:17:42] something different they can't even find
[1:17:46] their steps to the
[1:17:47] whom and that's what the Holy Spirit is
[1:17:52] you can keep it to one experience it has
[1:17:58] to be a constant life it's got to be
[1:18:00] something that lived through us praise
[1:18:04] the Lord
[1:18:05] there my spirit flow freely and that's
[1:18:09] what he's doing
[1:18:10] putting the church together dealing with
[1:18:13] us the different ways giving us
[1:18:16] different assignment different trials
[1:18:19] you know putting us back together
[1:18:25] the problem is Ned whether we fail or
[1:18:29] nad what really matter is after we feel
[1:18:34] what did we do next
[1:18:35] that we can't allow ourself to continue
[1:18:38] to fail and continue to fail no because
[1:18:42] that seed is the word that corrects the
[1:18:46] error and whenever the word comes and
[1:18:50] corrects the error it brings us back to
[1:18:53] the Father you just think about it
[1:19:01] you know you think about it
[1:19:04] I was talking with a brother then he
[1:19:07] asked me he says you know we talk on the
[1:19:11] prodigal son we talked about we talked
[1:19:15] about the prodigal son we talked about a
[1:19:17] prodigal son we never said nothing about
[1:19:19] the guy that was in the house that was
[1:19:22] before the father I said because most of
[1:19:25] the time we make the practicals on two
[1:19:28] different person
[1:19:29] when the prodigal son is just this guy
[1:19:33] remember jesus said your angel is always
[1:19:37] before the father that is a type of the
[1:19:41] older son this one
[1:19:44] bypassed the two funny is the type of
[1:19:47] the youngest son that strayed and came
[1:19:50] back to the Father so it's not two
[1:19:53] different person it's not brother Jordan
[1:19:55] is to all the father because he was I
[1:19:56] mean the younger the older brother
[1:19:59] because he was born in the message no
[1:20:00] it's not too different person it's the
[1:20:05] picture of salvation where there is one
[1:20:08] that is before the Father a
[1:20:10] representation of you and that prodigal
[1:20:17] son is this one that back past the two
[1:20:20] funny that was born in same shipler in
[1:20:24] iniquity it's also almost like the three
[1:20:27] counsel believer having another type of
[1:20:29] wit for Sunday it's also like the three
[1:20:33] kinds of believer it's not three
[1:20:35] different person sitting in the church
[1:20:36] it's just your body spirit and soul
[1:20:41] don't look over your shoulder you added
[1:20:43] three kinds of believer this body is an
[1:20:52] unbeliever it will remain an unbeliever
[1:20:54] it would die an unbeliever that's the
[1:21:01] reason why at the resurrection they must
[1:21:04] pick up a glorified body because it
[1:21:09] would die an unbeliever praise the Lord
[1:21:16] I was looking at I was looking at
[1:21:17] something the other night for what I
[1:21:20] want to talk about on Sunday and we just
[1:21:23] hope that the law would give us grace
[1:21:24] amen praise the Lord so you see that and
[1:21:27] I and I told him because it was a
[1:21:30] conversation we were having and I saw
[1:21:32] where he was going with their
[1:21:34] conversation and I says well trust the
[1:21:40] law to can afford just help us right
[1:21:42] here and as soon I told him that he saw
[1:21:45] it he saw it and he says exactly that's
[1:21:48] it why we talk about the prodigal son
[1:21:53] it's all about the product custom
[1:21:55] because that's what we are
[1:21:57] or we were in this place bypassing our
[1:22:06] cheer for me was when we went away with
[1:22:09] God with a precious gift we went away
[1:22:13] with the father why you were born I was
[1:22:18] in Africa with the father with that with
[1:22:21] my owner goose praise the Lord Amen but
[1:22:30] there was a seed that led to button he
[1:22:34] lost everything but he never lost his
[1:22:36] sonship praise the Lord
[1:22:41] so now remember you just watch the the
[1:22:45] audience watch the congregation that
[1:22:47] Jesus had when he was dealing with that
[1:22:50] he had the Pharisees he had a strap this
[1:22:56] man that was steadying the law and the
[1:23:01] book of Deuteronomy has already taught
[1:23:04] them how to deal with a rebellious son
[1:23:10] how he should be he should be brought
[1:23:13] before the elders he should be stoned to
[1:23:15] their because he said disgrace to the
[1:23:17] father and that's what was going to
[1:23:22] happen to the entire human race if Jesus
[1:23:25] did not pay the price we were going to
[1:23:28] be stoned with hailstones of fire go who
[1:23:34] have just wept everything out but he
[1:23:38] couldn't do it so God has to rewrite his
[1:23:43] own Lord and as much as it was against
[1:23:50] the Lord because their father that Jesus
[1:23:54] was talking about he was a wealthy man
[1:23:58] he was a respectful man if he was not
[1:24:03] respectful nobody would care about his
[1:24:05] son nobody would care about his name but
[1:24:09] he was one of the arrows
[1:24:11] of Israel so so so so Jesus had to
[1:24:14] rewrite the Lord and how did he do it
[1:24:17] because in his in his message in his
[1:24:21] salmon
[1:24:21] he brought the father down from from on
[1:24:24] high
[1:24:25] he ran the father through the street to
[1:24:28] go and meet the son at the gate because
[1:24:31] that's where they will have stone him
[1:24:41] praise the Lord the dynamics of this
[1:24:45] church is the refilling of the Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost there my spirit flow freely that's
[1:24:54] what the father want to say he looked
[1:25:02] down on you and work he want to sit
[1:25:04] there my spirit flow freely when he look
[1:25:08] at you I mean in a shopping-center he
[1:25:11] want to sit there my spirit flow freely
[1:25:13] he want to look at our young people and
[1:25:16] said dear my spirit flow freely god
[1:25:28] bless you we'll continue on a Sunday
[1:25:42] what I say God bless here looks like you
[1:25:44] still want me to continue let's sing
[1:25:55] that song again flow through me Holy
[1:25:56] Spirit flow through me amen before we go

[1:30:06] sometimes we get so organized and I will

[1:30:12] right and make the sentence right
[1:30:14] we just need to just let loose let's go
[1:30:17] just bring this request is true our
[1:30:19] hearts and true our mind and what our
[1:30:22] mind can just run over the places I mean

[1:30:27] need to measure their the name you know
[1:30:29] the I see people sometimes I want to

[1:30:33] brother brother brother the Lord knows
[1:30:37] the person just pretty true let the Holy
[1:30:40] Spirit just flow true we just get sold
[1:30:43] him on organized and we want to drag God
[1:30:48] through that slowness of our human
[1:30:50] spirit
[1:30:52] if he loved through us we will love the
[1:30:55] unlovable we will love the person that
[1:30:59] is difficult that for us to love if he
[1:31:02] if it is he he's the one loving through
[1:31:05] us
[1:31:07] if he's the one living through us he
[1:31:10] would give us victory everything there
[1:31:13] my spirit flow freely
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:23] that's the hour we are living in it's
[1:31:25] the hour of the manifestation of the
[1:31:28] sons of God is not going to come it's
[1:31:30] already here because we have all the
[1:31:34] mechanics all we need is to just let the
[1:31:37] spirit flow through us Lord reminding of
[1:31:42] your word Lord quick in that word to
[1:31:45] mean in an hour that is needed that's
[1:31:47] what brother Branham said he said in an
[1:31:49] hour where the word is need the Holy
[1:31:51] Spirit will remind us I've seen there
[1:31:54] over and over when I'm staring in and
[1:31:58] and there is just something on my mind I
[1:32:00] said Lord I know there is something
[1:32:02] about this in the world all I need to do
[1:32:04] is to just go about and be reading just
[1:32:08] go about praying before I come to the
[1:32:10] end of what I'm doing he's going to
[1:32:12] remind me because that's what the Holy
[1:32:15] Ghost is giving for it's giving to
[1:32:17] remind us is giving to guide us is
[1:32:20] giving to lead us is giving to teach us
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:28] some people did I mean I mean they have
[1:32:30] already graduated so they don't need to
[1:32:32] be taught
[1:32:37] but that's one of the requirement for
[1:32:40] adoptions you have to be taught you have
[1:32:42] to sit on a tutor

[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:09] and get to me
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:19] praise the Lord amen
[1:41:23] you know I've seen people that the Lord
[1:41:28] has dealt with and you know Bob
[1:41:32] Brennaman even talks about that in
[1:41:34] Hebrew exposition you know he was
[1:41:36] talking about our preacher dieback
[1:41:38] slided you know and and he said when he
[1:41:41] got back he talked to the man and after
[1:41:44] God took him from the scene
[1:41:45] you know everybody started going around
[1:41:47] and saying you know he lost the Holy
[1:41:51] Ghost and he didn't had the Holy Ghost
[1:41:53] where BAM says no he says I know their
[1:41:56] man I knew when he received the Holy
[1:41:59] Ghost praise the Lord he said so what
[1:42:02] happened is that people have a genuine
[1:42:05] spirit of the Holy Ghost but they try to
[1:42:08] stick to that experience and that goal
[1:42:12] with that constant refilling so now if
[1:42:16] the devil challenge you down the road
[1:42:18] brother scared you'd say oh I thought I
[1:42:20] received the Holy Ghost now if I'm doing
[1:42:23] this now which me I did not receive the
[1:42:25] Holy Ghost
[1:42:27] there is a general experience of the
[1:42:30] Holy Ghost but we need a constant
[1:42:33] refilling and he will keep refilling us
[1:42:36] until we get out of here
[1:42:40] praise the Lord you know he would keep
[1:42:43] refilling us until we get out of here he
[1:42:46] says so God make that gem you experience
[1:42:50] as a seal that I know that you know he
[1:42:54] did with me but as we go down the road
[1:43:00] he needs to refill us everything
[1:43:03] everything as we walked a lot bless you
[1:43:05] we will see you on Sunday if the Lord
[1:43:09] Jesus Terry
