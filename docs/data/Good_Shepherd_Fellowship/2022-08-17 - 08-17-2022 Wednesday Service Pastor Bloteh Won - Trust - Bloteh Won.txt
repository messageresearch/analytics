looks like [Music] a beautiful singer amen praise the lord hallelujah let's look at the first timity chapter one first timing chapter one tonight i thought i was kind of a capping on the subject of harmony with the father and the son but i will tell you that i'm learning from this uh uh i'm learning from this and you know there's it's it's just like there are times in your life where you have trials there are also times where in your life the windows of of understanding and revelation open and things that's just pouring out praise the lord it stopped pouring that and what is what gets embarrassing sometimes it comes when you are right in the middle of the highway there is no way to pull pull aside and start writing i said oh god this thing is just it's just uh it's just been a blessing that uh uh first time in chapter one let's read here paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and lord jesus christ which is our hope amen he is our hope praise the lord amen he is our hope unto trinity my son my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord heavenly father we will ask your blessings tonight and we will pray to god that you are blessing to your word come on father and teach us lord teach us in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seat now uh tonight i will try to to explain myself because uh it looks like i've got on one of these rabbit trail and it's hard to get off and and and sometimes it looks like what i mean what what uh what brother one is preaching harmony and father and the son and my god my god where are you and and uh my father my father character of israel now let me let me let me try to help you see the the inspiration i'm looking at here brother branham shared and as we've been reading and uh the the harmony that existed between the father and the son is going to be the same harmony that we exist between the bride and christ now father and son relationship is a parental relationship bride in christ relationship is a miracle relationship are we together amen and and i think that was that was that was a beautiful thing where uh brother jarrod shared that uh one time we were down there in a husky and uh we were talking some things and and he shared this very very beautiful concept you know how that uh a parent will never be able to know a child like a father you will never know your daughter as a wife for her to be known as a wife it would take her husband you will always know her as your daughter and you will never know a mother will never know her son as a husband you can only say he's a good son you can say he's a good husband he was never a husband to you praise the lord man those are some of the things that when it sticks it don't leave you when it sticks it don't leave you praise the lord amen and [Music] and so when you look at these two form of relationship you you you try to see and understand what was the prophet of god saying to us they are two different form of relationship it is not like as the father and his wife her harmony in their relationship so with the son and his wife have harmony no that's not what he's saying he's saying as the father and the son the son could do nothing except that which the father have shown him that harmony that existed between the father and the son and what we try to show all through the different types we've been using is that right from the beginning the first form of relationship that came was elohim god and adam the son praise the lord so for adam to be successful in his relationship with eve he had to have a successful harmony with the father that's where the time starts from it don't start from christ it starts from the first sun and something something hit my mind as i was meditating last night saint john chapter one see john chapter 1. i want to take my time tonight and recap because you see you can you can just you get in your own mind to you that you have you have a lot of revelation you are just in your own mind and you just come here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and sometimes people just looking where is he going can you please stop and tell us where is this vehicle going so i want to just recap here and that's the way i will i think that you will be able to be in the understanding of what we're trying to bring to the church saint john chapter 1 verse 18. i have a bunch of quotes tonight i would read i i just i had a i had a good different sets of them that i wanted to take my time because i get caught up in my emotions and i really don't uh read those quotes to be able to establish what we're trying to bring to you but in john chapter 1 verse 18 jesus said no man has seen god at any time god is a spirit no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he have declared him hold your place there let's go to psalm chapter 19 if mine bible memory is right psalm chapter 19 just hold your place there psalm chapter 19. i just i just want to show you something here psalm chapter 19 verse 1. the heavens declare that's the word i want you to pay attention to jesus said the purpose of the son was to declare the father if that was the purpose of the first son that would be the purpose of every child praise the lord amen that would be the purpose of every son of god every daughter of god so he says here david said the heavens declared the glory of god and the farming men show his handiwork now so jesus is saying no man have seen god he's a spirit but the only begotten came to declare make known the father and what the paul said the whole creation was groaning for the whole creation was groaning for the manifestation what is that manifestation declaring the father the manifestation of the son of god was not was not for us to make big names not to make our name was not to make any man's name that manifestation was to declare the father that's the reason why when brother brandon preached uh uh joshua a parallel efficient when he preached that entire series all he was talking about the way adam manifested that that thing that he lost that's what was going to be restored back to the church now so you see the the the reason the purpose of the message of the hour the reason why god would send a prophet to reveal all bring back all the loose ends reveal the the mysteries that were healing from the foundation of the word god's purpose in his mind of producing a son was to declare himself praise the lord if we cannot show god to a dying word we we don't have a message we don't have a message if the message is just just good for us to make us critical amen and think that everybody in the world is a separate seed and everybody is going to hell and we're going in the rapture if if that's your concept of the message you have not got the revelation yet you have not got the revelation the purpose of god verb says why the god gave adam a wife to produce himself why would god have a bride to produce himself praise the lord so how will god achieve that right from the beginning so in in terms of father and son god used the prophets of every age verb says in the message uh uh god's transforming power he says when god turned the work over to to adam he says god never did any work again he raised up men in every age to do his work praise the lord so uh uh the the the the the type what i want you to keep in your mind here when we're talking about the father and the son you you take it right down from elohim and adam you can bring it down go there with noah as a son amen praise the lord so in in in every age god will raise up uh uh a prophet noah to bring the people through the flood abraham was dead you know uh to establish a covenant with god moses was there to bring the people out of the land back to the promise that god gave to abraham praise the lord so just like how god would deal with the prophet as a son god will now use the prophet and deal with a people so now it will be as the father achieved the harmony now so this son now that has a ministry will now uh uh get harmony with the people that he's uh that he's called to lead praise the lord amen noah achieved it he was able to bring the animals to harmony that they were in the act there was no fighting the lion was not eating the goat amen so he was able to achieve that harmony in his own church praise the lord moses got a tough time when he got got to egypt the people resented him but when they started to see him declaring the father amen they knew that a man could not turn water into blood knew that a man could not say let there be frogs and frost fill all the place so when they when they saw moses declaring the father harmony starts to create harmony now starts to quit the very people that was resenting him start now to follow his instruction slay the lamb put the lamb on your doorpost we will be out of here what did there because they saw him declaring the father they wouldn't have trust moses for nothing if they never saw an attribute of the father are we together praise the lord but see how god will work this thing out as he evines in using different men in different dispensation he will also give the prophet of an age the ability to be a father to a son like moses will be to joshua sure are we together amen like moses will be to joshua so moses will now be a father spiritual father like elijah will be to elijah praise the lord amen so you you'll see that all through the ages now now you will you will now realize why i read this the verse that that we read timing my own son this was the first prophet to the gentile age paul and now all that the same thing that god did through the dispensation through the dispensation he's going to do the same thing now dealing with the gentile church but you have to realize that the gentile age has only two major prophet why because it's the return of the alpha and the omega so it's going to be at the beginning of the gentile age where paul will be a prophet to the gentile church right amen now it's it's it's it's it's amazing peter the apostle the one that was giving the key you realize that that in in scriptural design peter never used this kind of a language to call any man his son sure in scripture design you never see it he did not had a dispensational responsibility praise the lord amen look at something paul said here in philippians chapter 4 verse 9. philippians chapter 4 verse 9. he says those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and see in me do and the god of peace shall be with you the things that you have learned of me watching my life the things you have received of me who is this man what authority he has he was the same one that says follow me as i follow christ praise the lord amen now you see the the reason why people struggle around the end time messenger is because the alpha and omega goes together if you don't understand how god works in the alpha ministry you're going to struggle with the omega ministry you're going to struggle those things that you have learned of me you have received you have seen in me praise the lord are we together oh yeah it's so easy i mean if you were in that time and paul is saying that you could you could you could closely come to the place and say you want these people to worship him praise the lord you could come closely to say he want the people to worship him now so this is how i lose track of of myself and then i started i started going all over the place so what i want us to to be able to follow is not just to preach or to make uh uh make you excited but to be able to to to grab the concept sure to grab what the spirit is saying to the church so here is it in the alpha ministry we see the the prophet of the age the apostle paul he says i'm a messenger i'm a prophet unto the gentiles paul himself said it praise the lord amen maybe you maybe you get confused but then why he's called an apostle he was an apostle by gift but by calling he was a prophet to the gentiles amen brother branham was an evangelist by gift that was what was in his commission due to the work of an evangelist but he was a prophet by calling to the age as a reason why he could not get away from rebuking people because it was part of his nature it was part of what he was now so uh so that's what i want us to see that's what i want us to see moses was able to have a faithful son joshua caleb came along to support him verbum talks about the relationship of caleb and joshua praise the lord elijah was able to have a faithful son in so much that he received a double portion are we together now when when when god achieved it it's a success that's the reason why god told elijah no they are 70 they have not bowed down right amen they are 70 if you are an obedient son there will be a success but if god cannot get a man in the age the whole age is doomed the whole age is dumb go and read books they will tell you that the father of divine healing is william branham go and read books not message books all of these are pushing here that uh caramastic is doing and uh you know trying to descend and all of that when when when god started using brother branham it brought a completely different light look at men like ff bosworth every boss was preached everybody was retired he has retired from preaching before he even met brother branham one time he brought a brand administrate he came back to the ministry he said this is the thing that we were looking for out of these years he came out of retirement so you see to every age it's almost like to every home the way the home is balanced there must be a ahead of the home the father there must be a head of the home are we together so uh uh you know this this this is the way that god has worked through through the ages it's a principle that he that that he have worked and then and then i went about talking about uh the cry of the hebrew mother the cry of the father and the cry of the son we spoke about the three christ when a child is about to be born the hebrew mother go into travel and she cry praise the lord it shows that your birth is important your birth speaks about your foundation it speaks about your beginning praise lord amen it speaks about your beginning let's uh peter said we are born again by the sea incorruptible amen that that must be the beginning of our birth the beginning of our birth must never be following our parents to church praise the lord if that is the beginning of your birth there will be a time where you will struggle the beginning of your birth must never be the the excitement oh we are in the message the message the message and you just follow all the emotion if the seed is not there if the seed incorruptible is nothing you will struggle you will struggle so it is that cry of the mother why because the cry of the mother prophesied over the sun when she cried oh judah just making that noise in the way she screamed oh that's a kind the things that she says in that travel your birth is very important your beginning is very very important praise the lord that's the reason why jesus said we must be born again it's a matter of must it's a matter of [Music] must because our birth is very important now the cry of the father will now relate with the cry of the mother they are see incorruptible they are beginning they are birth that that that have taken place in you now the cry of the father now is the position positionally place you so honor the mother you have out of this care when you are born again god place you in the ministry he place you in a church he place you around people you have all of this kid as you are coming up you are coming brother branham in the message he talked about noun you are honored a teacher your father is giving you one try a year and trusting you with this and and all of this and and and then there come a time where the father must positionally place you praise the lord amen not knowing our our place where we are positionally placed sometimes it can make people to to room about it can make people to desire to be like other people i learned this thing today as i was i was thinking about something you know i was i was uh meditating or doing uh uh i think i was listening to a message or something like that but i i learned this today and uh and and it all came from the word of being a hypocrite that word hypocrite goes back to being an utter brahman says that's what the pharisees were amen now realize now i'm trying to take my time now i want to i want to grab you into into uh what what i've been i've been talking about and you will realize that what and what i learned that really hit me today you see that's the reason why all and most of the movie stars when they come to the end of their career they become they become so lost they become so confused you know and most of them have a very bad end why because out of their life they have acted like somebody else their career has made them to act because the the writer of the of the movie tell you that this role that you are playing this is the way this woman behave then you move from this movie and go to the next movie she tell you this is the way that this guy behave so all of your life you are acting like someone else so you grow up into death acting like this person acting like that person when they finally come to the end of their career they don't even know themselves because they have never been themselves they have never been themselves they have just played people all of your life so when they finally they finally come to themselves they don't know themselves they don't know their their actual self because they have acted like susan they are acted like jennifer they are out there all the different lifestyles and it's a terrible thing it's a terrible thing to add like people praise the lord so the cry of the father genesis 49 that's what jacob did he was placing the sons into the promise calling them one by one and and you know and and placing them but whatever that he was placing them was under the very same prophecy that's the reason why your birth is important your beginning is very important praise the lord now most of the time uh uh uh you know this this scripture ignoring our call in election or making our call in election show is they have always been taken in a way where we have to do something to make our call and election show what can you do for somebody to call you what the samuel did for god to call him and he thought that it was eli calling him it's always is is it's with a more deep sense of knowing who call you who call you how did you get to this how did you get to this place who called you what is the thing that is calling to your heart are you are you just coming because you are following or there is a desire there is a voice you are hearing it's making sure we call even though little samuel could not identify he thought it was ela but it was god calling him and because it was god calling him his journey was setting when he came to the place to realize that i'm not called by a man i'm not called by the church i'm called by god brother branham says i thank god he got a hold of me before the church that's the reason why your birth is very very important it's very important now so the father cried is placing the son the cry of the son my father my father the chariot of ezra the cry of the sun is confidence in the father is dependent jesus said the son can do nothing the father the son is is declaring that without you i can do nothing my father my father david reigned his clothes and said oh journey turned and and and saw they were pleasant in their life they were just they were swiftly like eagles they were stronger like lions the ego and lion anointing we are not the first people that learn it israel knew it yes because it was identified with their tribes the four tribes the the four sets of of israel trapped each one of them were identified with this it was a symbol to the tribe so the crowd of the mother is your birth that's what happened when you're going through some things they say oh god oh god help me oh oh god help me you know what you're doing you're saying my god my god why have that forsaken me praise the lord so i just i wanted to bring us i wanted to bring us to a place and uh just to kind of recap on these things so you can you can be able to grab where i've been trying to go with all of these thoughts but you have to realize that the purpose of the son was to declare the father and that's what we call manifestation praise the lord manifestation and that's the reason why god has to bring a son of man ministry in this age once again to declare because is is the manifestation time so the purpose of the message is to declare the father that some do not care how you criticize it it does not worry about what you will say about it but when it comes out it comes to declare the father the heavens declared the glory of god david said it's like the sun coming out like a strong man out of his chamber and that is the same reason now so brother branham would now or he would now he will now teach us and and make us to realize you know that before the sun is brought out and positioned on the place by the father he goes on a teachership so god will use different things in our life to teach us amen he will teach us by the way of sickness for us to know that he's a healer he will teach us by the way of being broke to know that he's a provoder so he will allow you know when when when when uh when the when the church were has the idea that you don't have to go through this thing if you are a christian you you will not have to be broke if you are a christian you will not have to be sick i mean they they they don't really understand the teaching of the father yes absolutely now so when the son goes through these things what is he learning he's learning to trust the ability of the father all the father want him to learn is to trust the ability of the father see brother brandon says if god tell me tomorrow go to the graveyard and and and pray for george washington he said i'm going to go there why because he's trusting the ability of the father he's not trusting the good christian life he lives you have to learn to trust the ability of the one that have called you you got to trust that he can keep you on to the day you have to that's i mean that's that's everything that he's teaching us when those things are established in us then now the same harmony that existed between the father and the son is now existing between the bride and christ that is the only way we can give christ the preeminence that's the only way we can give christ the preeminence giving christ the preeminence does not means that the first person that comes to church so when you drive in the parking lot there is no other car you say yes i'm giving god a preeminence i'm the first no that's not giving god the preeminence even though brother brahm taught us we must give him the first place yes amen we must give you in the first place now if you if you try to do all of those things mentally you just try to do them mentally i wake up i gave you in the first place i prayed i i i before i eat my food i gave in the first place if you try to do all of those things and and the relationship is not you are not trusting him you are just doing it to win his favor then you're not in harmony you still not in harmony you are just doing it to win god's favor winning his favor is different from trusting him it's different from trusting him praise the lord now so you see all of these things uh uh that's that is the harmony and verb say issue exists between the bride and christ so it's a responsibility it's a responsibility trust is a responsibility okay if i take my key and says somewhere i heard you are driving take my key the car is outside i give you my car praise the lord as lord as as uh it looks like a wonderful thing you are excited but there is a whole lot of responsibility that has been given to you praise the lord the message is a responsibility for god to call you in this age to trust you with himself praise the lord you see that was the same thing he did to joseph when mary was pregnant he had to it was not enough for joseph to rely on what mary said right god had to send the same angel the angel gibra came down and spoke to mary that i mean spoke to joseph this thing that that merit is talking about is of me praise the lord so it was a responsibility now that was on joseph he took that responsibility over his marriage vow with merit he took that responsibility of bringing the christ child more than mary is my wife praise the lord so it's not just joining church we have jesus on our hands we have we have the life of christ on our hands we have been given a responsibility and the father have trusted us yes he had trusted us that we would not feel him praise the lord amen and he's trying to bring us to the place for us to trust him for us for for for mortals men like we are we we know ourselves we know our failures but can we trust him praise the lord are we together so we have a responsibility on our hands let's let's just read some few things tonight yeah as i try to uh capture you a little bit into into total deliverance listening to this brother burnham says i wonder he said this morning it was a morning message but uh this is evening as christians if if we have yelled ourself now if you go back and study and look at the word yield it all goes to trust for you to yield yourself is to trust yourself in the hands of god if if if we have heal our own will and yield ourselves so completely to god tell god can trust us trust us the place that he has put us can god trust us to the place where he has put us sure praise the lord most of the time when we look at this we look at it with the thought of just church and position in church no your place in the family your place at work amen the it that he caused you to move tall i wonder this morning of myself if i could be so headed to god till god could trust me who trusts brother neville could trust our trusty board our deacon board all our members of our church we all have a place and we got a duty praise the lord the minister has got a place of duty to stand and preach the unsociable riches of christ without compromising if he is called to be a preacher praise the lord he wouldn't share one thing or spare one thing sorry for one person if he's called to be a preacher and the and the member of the church he's called to be a member of a setting group then he will not compromise if the church believed that we should not gamble then then that member should never touch a deck of cards we don't believe in drinking we should turn our hair completely from drinking if we do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of the church should never touch such a thing god gave complete deliverance praise the lord amen so almost in one sense he's also bringing us to the place to for us to be able to to realize the other he's he's he's trusting that his work can bring us to this place his word can bring us to this tender sure praise the lord because he said in his word he's going to get a bride with a spot or wrinkle he's not depending on our ability no perfect strength perfect weakness brother branham says is the other way around we must be depending on his ability not on our own ability he would do it if we will completely surround ourselves to him if we were completely deliver ourselves into his hands then god can live in us christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself the same word declared declare himself from us as uh as we get as we get ourself out of the way praise the lord amen ever pressing water from the rock as as we march lord we know that the smitten rock is right along in by us the ever-pressing water from the right goes with the church all intent of god lose to us this morning or this evening faith in this god that's with us brother branham says lose to us that's where the church needs to come to rise up to that place i mean as soon as little things start to happen to us in that we get so afraid we get so afraid he says i will never leave you i will never forsake you what is he trying to do to bring us to the consciousness of the ever-present god that's when the miraculous happen for you to be conscious that god is ever present whatever situation you are in to just realize that you are in the presence of the ever-present god he promised that he will never leave you lose to us faith in god that's with us i know you will just as we can find favor with you that you can trust us with it trusting us with that faith praise the lord god is trusting you and myself with a faith to believe his ever present when the word and a religious word is worshiping a god that is distance they always talk about a god that is in heaven you must be talking about a god that is right here he's right here right now praise the lord god is trusting you with that faith he's losing it to you praise the lord it's not the wind blowing and the trees dropping over your house and then you start thinking all sorts of things in your head they are climbing over my house but i mean even if they are claiming god is ever present he's right there he's releasing their faith to you to believe in the ever-present god he's trusting us he said as i was i was speaking and i i i said something so i uh studying when i came across this it was it was very interesting he says yeah he's talking dead in the church others he says we do find there's a lot of impersonation of spiritual gift but i don't believe that that's so here in our church i'm thankful for that we don't believe in an impersonation at all i believe we have genuine gift but we must know how to control those gifts praise the lord we must know how to control those gifts and many times people struggle you know people struggle people that are that are blessed with gifts and and where people struggle is when we think when we when we ever get in our mind that our gift is is superior than the word if you keep your gift under the word yes sir and you always check it with the word yes absolutely praise the lord because there there are some people uh and and and and i mean god has blessed us with many of many of the of that in this church it's just that we have not tried to major on it amen we have not tried to measure on it but most of the time when when when people try to major on gifts that's when the gift starts to detect to the word you know it starts to detach to the word what does that mean it means that a person get a vision and pretty soon now it gave me an inspiration to start preaching there are people in this church that are doing this that are doing that well now that gift is dictating to me but it can be used the right way and when you when when you go to doing something good just just like you are working for a bus in in in you and you started out on the first of your job and you are willing to take others then the boss have confidence in you and will keep raising you up to a higher office all the time now brother brennan is talking about spiritual gifts here but then he's also bringing a scenario of your boss having confidence in you your boss now starts to trust you that now he can raise you to a higher office and that is the same way that that god deals with us that's what he's bringing here now i believe that time time has struck the branham tabernacle to know to to take the gift of god to take the gift that god gave us that god can trust us with something even greater then what we have got right now so when these things were manifesting around brother branham being a prophet he started observing them you know he started seeing those men uh there was a time where he even had to talk to brother neville and says the people are putting too much pressure on you brother and evil and pretty soon you are giving in to always give them an answer he said you don't have to do that there was another time he was away and a child died in tabernacle those brothers would give came around they prayed and the child came back to life so you see it it's all that sense of growth but it all comes from harmony they sing a ministry with discernment and ministry of the praying for the sake and identifying it that is from god they can come under that ministry as children and starts to learn praise the lord they can come honor that ministry as children and starts to learn he says god can trust us with greater things if we manage and respect the little things that we have praise the lord and then just like we talk about gifts we'll also talk about the offices of the local church praise the lord and all of those things because uh is is the responsibility that god is is giving to us as a church i know some people that have uh have in their mind i mean it's just only the pastor that you are answerable to you are completely wrong you are completely wrong if there's a brother that is taking an office in this church we as a church voted him into office and that's the reason why we bowed our heads and we asked is there anyone that have any reason praise the lord and if you don't know uh uh uh i mean the 99 can vote for that brother but if there is one or two person we still like to know why and sometimes we talk because maybe the 99 don't know that sure are we together now so you see all of these things so uh i'm just only saying that you know uh uh uh because i mean we uh we uh we are where we are and we are trusting the lord to take us to where he want us to be and we have to realize that god is training us brother branham says in the message adoption the same series we're talking about he said god knows his trust in job he was talking about job god knows how much he can trust you he knows how much he can trust me praise the lord he says but what i'm speaking of now is placing of sons so it's all on trust is the father trusting the son to positionally give him an inheritance is the son also trusting the ability you are not trusting what the father has placed in your hands but you are trusting the ability of the father that's why the practical son could come back home even though he lost everything the father had given him but the ability to always be a son to the father he did not lost adoption he said how was our inheritance given to us through what predestination predestination is full knowledge how did god know he could trust you to be a preacher his full knowledge so it is not from an act that you did before he started trusting you he trust goes back it's not that you did something no he trust goes back that before you were even born he trusted you and this god that trusted you before you were even born right you mean he trusted you when he knew that you would fail he still trusted you when he knew you will fail praise the lord so if there is any good that will come out of or why can't we trust him why can't we just trust him like that lady says i trusted the lord until the last cut brother and said no you got it wrong you have something you are holding on to you should have trusted god after a court yes many of us we have things that we are holding on to we hold on to church membership we hold on to how long we've been in the message we hold on to all of these things yes sir can we trust god can we trust god can we let go and let god have his way can we let go and let god have his way i mean all of all of this is coming down to days all of the things that is happening in the world all the things that is happening around the message and all the things that it's all coming down to this can we trust god are we looking to the ability of the father for the spouses that he gave us are we looking to the ability of the father for the parents that he gave us are we looking to the ability of the father for the children that he gave us or are we trusting our skill of raising children amen are we trusting our ability of of fracturing our wives or making our husband the way we want him to be it all comes down to this that's not you know i'm i'm just i'm just kind of struggling with my work i don't want to get into emotion tonight i want you to see it i want you to see what we drive into i want you to see what we're driving toward it's for it's for you as a son of god as a daughter of god completely surrounding yielding yourself to god it does not mean that you will not have tried you will not have my battle but if if if you are in that mindset whether why you trust god even the time of the stronger pressure on you you say lord into your hands i commit my spirit and see how god will lift you out of that praise the lord the same god i kept down here in the lion's den that kept daniel alive before living lions he can keep you alive in the midst of spiritual alliance because the devil is a rolling lion seeking for whom to devolve and the spiritual lion is more dangerous than the physical lion the same god i took shadrach meshach and abednego through the fire they trusted god they did not they then a figure and calculated how it would end because they were not going to calculate they said king even if he don't deliver us even if he don't deliver us can we trust god we have taken too many things in our hands too many things in our hands praise the lord and most of the time we mess it up before we want to give it to god and it's not that he can't fix it but because we have messed it up we struggle with the thought that is it's poor already right we struggle with that thought that is poor so we're not even believing in in the confidence that god is able to to make a a an eden out of a chaos situation right the harmony existed between the father and the son will be the same that we exist between christ and the bride amen the purpose of the son was to declare the father praise the lord the purpose of the first son was to declare the father and that's the purpose of every son every son is not only in the sense of the male gender for every son in the sense of every child of god what we are called to is to declare the father yes is to declare the father and the father is putting us through different things there was there were there were two things that brother brandon brought out i will take that on sunday so we can we can look at this look at this again because you know i'm like i said i want you to be able to see the picture of what we uh we are we are trying to bring to you praise the lord amen i believe we are in in the time you know like brother brahm says where where the church the church in general is is is facing treacherous water right okay there are things that will happen things that will that will uh uh you know uh will come our way that we will be exposed to and all of that but can we still trust god can we still trust and believe that god sent a prophet you know as i keep staring on this i was looking at also the songs of the prophet you know that that came up in the time of elijah a group of men that were called the sons of the prophet but they had no no regard for the prophet elijah so so who sounds the way where did they get their title from sure we'll look at that as as we look at this but uh you you have to you have to realize that you know and just like timothy had i mean paul had timidity as a son you also realize that he referred to titus as a son so it was not just one man so there is not one man that is a son to the prophet brother bran no is the ministry is the faithful fightful ministry that will rightly divide the world of truth that would be submissive to what the prophet said amen the fightful ministry that will find the importance to say what the prophet have said that's the son that's the place of the sun right praise the lord that's the place of the sun it's it's very amazing when you study the scripture you study the scripture you realize that uh paul he rebuked the the jewish brethren's natural not to pressure not to pressure the gentile people that are being safe you know into the covenant of circumcision and all of that but you know what he did he taught he told titus he told titus to obey them why because titus was now going to be a pastor of a jewish church it's right in the scripture sure now he's the prophet of the age you you you say you say wow that's the reason why brother brandon consists i preach why paul preached if you can see it and understand it in the alpha ministry you will not struggle with it in the in the omega ministry sure because that's how god works what you see is to be able to trust the son that god has raised in the age right think about it jesus the son of god a virgin shall conceive he was raised he was raised upon uh uh uh and and then he was there i mean he uh he he opened the blind eye said you know what what do men say is that i the son of man and everybody standing peter honor inspiration thou art christ son of the living god you realize that all during his ethnic ministry they really struggle to accept who he was they came to conviction after his resurrection he was raised in the dead he was healing the sick all of that he was doing the year as they walk with him and all the things that they saw they still struggle to believe and accept who he was after he was crucified they all went back to their tents went back to fishing and everything but when he resurrected now they could go to an upper room to go and wait for the holy ghost praise the lord god have a purpose of raising a son in this age the son of man ministry the son of man being revealed praise the lord that is the place that brings the church that is the place that brings the the the bride the people that are caught up under that ministry because he's the son just as god deals with their son the word that he gave us now can have a preeminence he can say just like paul said the things that you have seen in me the things you have received the things you have learned of me do and the god of peace because i mean we we at a place where there is there is just there is just so much trouble because of uh you know uh uh what others want to make of brother branham it posts orders to the place also where we become killers right and think that while we are in the message we don't need the prophet amen oh yeah we you do let me tell you you do yes because he was that wave chief the son that came to maturity so we can learn how he got there we can learn how he got there that's what we are trying to bring to you we can learn how he got there yes can you trust the ability brother branham says will god allow me to to to do all of this and mislead you can we trust the ministry of the prophet can we trust the things that he said to us amen we have to realize is this divine mysterious truth that we literally turn our heart back and if he will be able to do it we have to trust it for our heart to go back to the apostolic father we have to trust the divine mystery truth we have to have to trust the divine mystery truth that being revealed to us praise the lord so i thought that this this wednesday night i will i will just be slow i will you know you know tie my hearts down and now run over the place and just try to to recap what i've been trying to bring bring to you i know i don't have enough ability to to bring it in the best way the other people that can do better than me but i i'm trying my best anyway amen i'm trying my best anyway if that harmony issue exists if that how many you exist praise the lord that harmony he says that harmony is existing you know between the bride and christ we know it's a very important ingredient for any form of relationship right you know any form of relationship the sons of the prophet never had harmony so they had a death in the part what they were giving the people was death because they were not in harmony with the father right they were not willing to learn honor elijah ahab has already bailed a seminary for them where they were gathering and what they were doing they were reading the laws of moses yeah they were reading the laws of moses that's the reason why when uh when aha went to them and found out whether he should go to roman gillet and show him in a word that yeah it's true this place is for us right they were willing to take instruction from the lord of moses but yet they were not they were not able to identify a prophet that was in their midst they were not able to identify a prophet that was in their midst praise the lord are we together no amen yeah don't uh if you if if we're going to trust god you have you have to realize now you have to realize this is where it's very important to you for you to believe to be able to achieve a harmony between christ the bridegroom and the church as a bride you must also believe that god was able to achieve it between the father and a son in your age so to despise that and say it's uh i don't believe in you know uh brother branham and what do people say about brother brown how are you going to get there right that's the reason why god did not express eve immediately he make adam he work with adam achieving their harmony with adam because when eve come on the same the harmony will flow the same harmony that existed between the father and the son will now be between the bridegroom and the bride eve praise the lord i hope that i was able to to help you tonight to be able to look at some things but the major ingredients tonight is trust the major ingredients for this harmony is trust musicians can come for tonight if we can just bring our house before the lord okay um [Music] if we don't learn from that sun we'll just be impersonating we'll be impersonating a manifestation you hear a group of people that say we are in a manifestation of the sons of god and having all the trouble all the trouble in their homes all the trouble in their lives you are just impersonated because you don't want to learn a song is never positionally placed until he has been trained and a way to train is to learn [Music] change my heart oh god [Music] to go

something i really blessed my heart today as i was listening to him let me read that to you before we pray here he said brother branham what does that mean god bless you back there son what does it mean if i put my hands up and say well if i raise my hands you know what it does it breaks every law of signs by the lord of gravity of the earth and make your haze hold down gravity will put your hands down and if you raise your hand it goes to show that there is a supernatural power in you that have brought you to that decision and you have raised your hands towards heaven from whence christ has ascended and shall descend to make witness to him there's something within you tell you you were wrong and you want to be forgiving that's what it means to put your hands up if you feel that way tonight as we raise our hands to the lord let's speak to him tonight if there is anything that is that is that is scaring you or fearing you or intimidating you you can trust god tonight that he can break he can break that power of fear you can trust god for your children tonight wherever they are wherever they are they can be they can be lost in sin they can be whatever they are doing you can
