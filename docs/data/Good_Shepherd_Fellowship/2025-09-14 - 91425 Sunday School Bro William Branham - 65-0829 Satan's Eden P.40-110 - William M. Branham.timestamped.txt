[2:41] [Music]
[3:08] 6,000 years or six days that God built
[3:11] the earth. Now, it took God 6,000 years
[3:14] to establish it, plant it with good
[3:16] seeds, and to bring forth everything
[3:18] after its kind. Everything must come
[3:22] forth of its kind. all his seeds were
[3:24] good and so it must spring forth after
[3:26] its kind. God took 6,000 years. Finally,
[3:30] when he got it all made and finally we
[3:33] uh finally arrived with its headquarters
[3:35] of the earth in a beautiful spot laying
[3:39] east of Eden called the Garden of Eden.
[3:43] God made the world's headquarters in the
[3:46] Garden of Eden in Egypt. Right at the
[3:49] east end of the garden was the
[3:51] headquarters and over the whole
[3:54] situation, he put his son and his son's
[3:58] wife over all of it.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Right? It's what God did. He put them in
[4:03] full control. They could speak to the
[4:05] winds and it would cease to blow. They
[4:08] would speak to the tree and it would
[4:09] move from here to there. The lion and
[4:12] the wolf fed together and the lamb laid
[4:15] down with them. There was no evil. It
[4:18] was perfect peace, perfect harmony,
[4:21] everything in perfection. And when God
[4:25] had it under his control, and it notice,
[4:27] he had his he had his world, he had all
[4:30] in operation, he had everything coming,
[4:33] everything eaten, vegetation, nothing to
[4:35] die, nothing to be ruined, nothing to be
[4:37] spoiled, nothing. It was just perfect.
[4:40] And over it all he placed his beloved
[4:43] children, his son and his daughter, a
[4:46] husband and wife to control it. God was
[4:50] so satisfied and he rested from all his
[4:53] works at the seventh day and hallowed
[4:55] this seventh day Sabbath for it because
[4:58] God looked it all over actually been
[4:59] 6,000 years and molding it and fixing it
[5:02] out making it come into existence and
[5:04] put the mountains up and make the
[5:05] volcanics pushed the mountains up and
[5:07] the things that taken place in the
[5:09] eruptions dried it off and fixed it the
[5:11] way you had it and it was a beautiful
[5:13] place. There was nothing like it. the
[5:16] great paradises of God, the great
[5:18] dinosaurs and whatever more crawling
[5:20] through it and of the great animals. No
[5:23] harm in them. They were just as gentle
[5:25] as a little kitten. They had nothing at
[5:27] all. No, no sickness, no sorrow, not one
[5:31] disease germ on the earth.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a place. The great bird
[5:36] swinging from tree to tree. And Adam
[5:38] could call him by name and they'd fly up
[5:40] on his shoulders and and coup to him and
[5:43] uh oh what a wonderful place God had and
[5:47] then made one of his attributes
[5:51] from his own body. God has attributes in
[5:56] his body like you are an attribute of
[5:59] your father
[6:01] and you notice you was in your
[6:04] grandfather's grandfather's grandfathers
[6:07] but in that say we'll take it down to
[6:09] like you and your father now you did not
[6:13] know anything when you were in your
[6:15] father the germ of life comes from the
[6:18] male the male has the blood cell the
[6:21] woman has the the
[6:23] Now therefore the blood cell has the
[6:26] life in it. And then when you were in
[6:29] your father you actually know nothing
[6:32] about it but yet science and God's word
[6:36] proves that you were in your father but
[6:38] you know nothing about it. But then the
[6:41] father long to know you and with the
[6:45] union of connection with mother then you
[6:48] were made known to father.
[6:51] Now you are your father's attribute.
[6:55] You look like him and you got parts of
[6:58] your body that looks like your father.
[7:01] Now that's the way God was in the
[7:03] beginning. Every son of God and every
[7:05] daughter of God was in God at the
[7:08] beginning. You don't remember it now,
[7:10] but you were there. He noticed
[7:12] &gt;&gt; and he wanted you to become so he could
[7:15] contact you, speak with you, and love
[7:18] you and shake your hands. Don't you want
[7:20] your own boy? Isn't it a great day when
[7:22] you're a boy and can come home and set
[7:24] out at the table? When he comes back
[7:26] from the battlefield or something,
[7:27] another scarred up. How you fix the
[7:29] dinner, you kill a fatted calf or
[7:31] whatever more and prepare for him. It's
[7:34] your own flesh and blood
[7:36] &gt;&gt; and he was in you. You didn't know him
[7:39] then, but you knew he was there. And so
[7:42] God knew that we would be here,
[7:44] &gt;&gt; but then he put us in the flesh so we'd
[7:47] be contacted. an order he could contact.
[7:49] He become one of us
[7:51] &gt;&gt; when he become Jesus Christ the son of
[7:53] God himself the fullness of the
[7:55] manifestation of God. Therefore that was
[7:58] God's purpose to display his attributes
[8:01] in fellowship. When I was in my father I
[8:04] knew nothing about it. But when I become
[8:05] his son and was born of him I was an
[8:08] attribute a part of my father and you
[8:12] are a part of your father. And as
[8:14] children of God, we are a part of God's
[8:17] attribute that was in him, made flesh
[8:20] like he was made flesh. So we can have
[8:22] fellowship one with the other as a
[8:24] family of God upon the earth. That was
[8:26] God's purpose at the beginning.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the
[8:31] beginning. He had everything under
[8:32] control and he turned man over into the
[8:35] Garden of Eden on free of all ages. He
[8:37] say, "Son, it's yours." What a beautiful
[8:39] place. God was so satisfied that he just
[8:42] went back and rested from all of his
[8:43] works. Every tree never brought forth
[8:46] thorns and thistles. No berries ever
[8:48] come off of a thorn tree. Everything was
[8:50] perfect. All seeds were perfect.
[8:53] Everything was in perfect condition.
[8:56] Then when he went to take a little rest,
[8:58] his enemy slipped in with the seat and
[9:02] took it over by misinterpreting
[9:05] his program to his children.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. when he put trust in his own child
[9:12] as you put trust in your daughter when
[9:14] she goes out at night with a man. When
[9:15] you put trust in your son when he has to
[9:17] go with a drinking boy or smoking boy.
[9:20] See, he put trust in his son that he
[9:23] would not do anything wrong and would
[9:26] keep every word that he said. But the
[9:28] enemies slipped in like that greasy
[9:30] slicker that would take out your
[9:32] daughter and misbehave himself or or
[9:35] some woman would take go out with your
[9:37] son and the same thing. See, he slipped
[9:39] in. The enemy of God slipped in and
[9:43] misinterpreted the word to Eve. Now,
[9:48] he by this fall, it has took over and
[9:53] possessed the Garden of Eden himself. He
[9:56] took it over and now he has had 6,000
[10:00] years of deceitful rule.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] deceiving the people, God's children, as
[10:07] he did then, because they were based on
[10:10] free moral agency to act any way they
[10:13] wish to and believing if they would act
[10:16] right or trusting they would act right,
[10:18] then they come with the wrong act and
[10:20] sold their birthrights as Esau did for
[10:23] the world.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Satan won it. And he took it
[10:27] over. And he's had 6,000 years to build
[10:30] up his Eden as God had 6,000 years to
[10:35] bring his Eden to a close. And by
[10:37] deceit, the seed of the word of the
[10:39] people now established his own Eden in
[10:44] this earth in sin. God's Eden was
[10:47] established in righteousness.
[10:50] Satan's Eden is established in sin
[10:52] because Satan is sin.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; God is righteousness.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; God's kingdom was established in
[11:00] righteousness and peace and life. And
[11:02] Satan's establishment is in sin
[11:06] &gt;&gt; and religious sin.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Know how he deceived deception as he
[11:12] said he would. He promised to do this.
[11:14] Did anybody know that? Let us turn to
[11:17] Isaiah if you want some of these
[11:19] scriptures. If you I ought to quote more
[11:20] of my guests. Let's turn to Isaiah the
[11:23] 14th chapter. Just a moment. Let's see
[11:25] what Satan said here just a moment. And
[11:28] Isaiah 14, we'll read it
[11:31] and watch what this fellow done. Isaiah
[11:34] 14, beginning with the 12th verse. How
[11:37] art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[11:40] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[11:42] down to the ground which did weaken the
[11:45] nation?
[11:47] For thou hast said in thy heart, I will
[11:49] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[11:52] throne above the stars, that's sons,
[11:54] stars of God, and I will set also upon
[11:58] the mount of the congregation, the side
[12:02] of the north. Now I will ascend above
[12:04] the heights of the clouds, and I will be
[12:06] like the most high.
[12:09] Now compare that over here with our
[12:10] other scriptures over in Thessalonians a
[12:12] while ago how he said he sits in the
[12:14] temple of God exalting himself above all
[12:16] is called God so that he as God is
[12:19] worshiped as God upon the earth. There's
[12:22] the God of this world that I preached to
[12:24] you about last Sunday. Here he is today
[12:27] in deceit.
[12:29] that treacherous hour, that tremendous
[12:31] time that we're living. It's the most
[12:34] glorious time of all the ages because
[12:37] we're facing the great millennium again.
[12:40] We're facing the Eden again. But right
[12:43] at this age, all the deceit and every
[12:45] tactic that he's ever used and been able
[12:47] to deceive with, he's gathered it all
[12:49] together and reinforced himself and come
[12:52] down like God
[12:55] and put himself in place of God,
[12:57] religious, and can quote the scripture
[13:01] and can tell you scripture
[13:03] just as Satan did to Eve in the Garden
[13:05] of Eden, but leave out one spot of it.
[13:08] It's all he has to do. make that gap
[13:11] where the poison doctrine of the devil
[13:13] could pour through like the thinking
[13:15] man's filter we was talking about the
[13:16] other night.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Now he said he would exalt himself above
[13:20] the most high. He would ascend above the
[13:22] clouds of the stars and he would sat
[13:24] there like God and be above the most
[13:26] high. And he has succeeded in carrying
[13:30] out his threats.
[13:32] He has certainly had a marvelous success
[13:35] in carrying out his threats by the
[13:38] people letting him explain away in every
[13:42] age the value of God's promised word to
[13:45] that age.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; That's exactly how he's done it. Never
[13:49] age he explained it away. In the days of
[13:51] Noah, he explained that it was
[13:52] impossible for it to rain from heaven
[13:54] for there's no rain up there. Great
[13:57] scientific gospel that he preached in
[13:58] the Garden of Eden. He could shoot the
[14:00] instruments to the moon and prove
[14:02] there's no moisture up there.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; But God said there would come a rain.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; But Satan succeeded and poison the mind
[14:11] of the people by scientific research
[14:12] that it could not be done. But it was
[14:15] done. God said it would be done and it
[14:17] was done.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now in the days of uh of Jesus, he
[14:23] did the same thing. He poisoned their
[14:25] minds again by deceit. see
[14:27] misinterpreting the word. If thou be the
[14:30] son of God, now let me see you do
[14:32] something about it. Jesus didn't clown
[14:34] for him. He never did. God's not a
[14:37] clown. He don't have to answer anything
[14:39] as Satan asked. He only had Jesus said,
[14:42] "It is written, thou shalt not live, man
[14:43] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[14:45] every word that proceeds out of the
[14:47] mouth of God." He didn't have to clown
[14:49] from him. He didn't have to make bread.
[14:51] He could have done it, but he'd been
[14:52] listening to the devil, so he didn't
[14:54] have to listen to the devil. And again,
[14:56] it is a religious sin as at the
[14:58] beginning. So deceitful. Watch it now.
[15:01] It's not just purely old everyday sin,
[15:04] committing adultery and getting drunk
[15:06] and using God's name in vain. That's not
[15:08] it.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; No. You remember years ago, many of you
[15:12] hear the old-timers. Remember that
[15:14] sermon I preached on the disappointments
[15:16] of judgment?
[15:18] &gt;&gt; The harlot, she ain't going to be
[15:19] disappointed there. She knows where
[15:21] she's going. The drunkard ain't going to
[15:23] be disappointed there. the bootlegger,
[15:25] the gambler, the liar, the thief, he's
[15:29] not going to be disappointed. But that
[15:31] man who thinks he's right,
[15:34] &gt;&gt; there's the disappointment.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; That's that fellow said, "Come
[15:37] say,"Lord, haven't I preached the
[15:38] gospel? Have not I cast out devils in
[15:40] thy name?" Jesus said, "Depart from you,
[15:43] from me, you that work iniquity. I never
[15:45] even knew you." There's the
[15:46] disappointment. See, that deceitfulness,
[15:49] that's what I'm constantly, that's where
[15:51] I'm so misunderstood.
[15:53] It's not that I want to be different. I
[15:55] don't want to be different. But I've got
[15:57] to be honest.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; I have a message and that must go to the
[16:00] people. Makes it very much misunderstood
[16:02] amongst the people. They think I'm
[16:04] against everybody. They only know I'm
[16:06] for everybody and trying my best to
[16:08] bring them what's the truth just as it's
[16:10] laid on my heart and the way it's laid
[16:12] in the Bible here. And God proves that
[16:14] to be the truth.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing else can be done
[16:18] about it. So me either look at it or
[16:20] they don't. See, they don't want to see
[16:22] it because they have already sold out,
[16:24] &gt;&gt; sold their birth rights to some
[16:27] organization, some denomination to try
[16:30] their birth rights to get to heaven upon
[16:31] the basis of some organized religion,
[16:34] which Satan is ahead of every bit of it.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; God never did have an organized
[16:38] religion.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Never did. And they sell out to that
[16:42] where they a bunch of man interpret the
[16:45] word and say it means this and it means
[16:46] that. God needs no interpreter. He does
[16:49] his own interpreting.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need anyone else to tell him
[16:52] how to do it. He's sovereign. He said
[16:55] how he would do it. And that's why he
[16:56] must keep his word.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; When he said these signs shall follow
[16:59] them that believe, he meant just that.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever he said would take place, he
[17:03] said it would happen in these last days
[17:05] that he would do certain things and he
[17:07] done it.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; He has to ask nobody whether it's time
[17:10] or not. He knows what the time is, what
[17:12] the plan is. Amen.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan, this deceiver as spoke of in
[17:17] Matthew 24:24 was so much deceit. Now,
[17:20] we find that by his gospel programs of
[17:23] knowledge, better education, higher
[17:25] ethics, civilization, and so forth has
[17:28] bewitched.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; The people that wants to serve God into
[17:34] believing his lie.
[17:36] Eve did not want to do that.
[17:39] But he showed her how it was more wisdom
[17:42] in it.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; She didn't know. She wanted to know. She
[17:46] didn't understand. But she wanted to
[17:48] understand. And God told her not to try
[17:50] to understand.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; How can I understand any of these
[17:53] things? I cannot understand them. I
[17:55] believe them. I don't have to understand
[17:57] them. God is faith and not
[17:59] understanding.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; We just believe what he said. Now
[18:03] compare God's Eden to Satan's now after
[18:07] 6,000 years of perverting of the true
[18:10] interpretation of God's promised word to
[18:12] the age. Let's compare it now and see
[18:15] where we get like he did to the church
[18:17] in Christ time in Jesus trying to keep
[18:21] uh keep back uh God's loyal sons from
[18:26] knowing the truth. That's God's God put
[18:29] his son here his attributes to
[18:31] fellowship with him by hearing his word.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; What if your father told you and you are
[18:37] a loyal son to your father and he told
[18:40] you son don't you go in that water out
[18:42] there swimming because he's gators in
[18:44] that water and a fellow comes back says
[18:46] surely such pretty water is that there's
[18:48] no gators in it. who you going to listen
[18:51] to. If you're a genuine son, you listen
[18:53] to your daddy.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; And a genuine son or daughter of God
[18:57] takes God's word first. I don't care
[18:59] what anybody else says about it. They
[19:01] take God's word first.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Poison in the cup
[19:06] &gt;&gt; and they believe it.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Having faith in all his word, his seeds
[19:11] brought a Eden of holiness, love, and
[19:15] eternal life.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; That's what God's eating produced.
[19:19] holiness
[19:21] and
[19:23] &gt;&gt; it brought a Eden of holiness, of love,
[19:26] understanding, perfection, and eternal
[19:29] life. That's what God's planning, his
[19:31] word, his seed. That's what his church
[19:34] will be at the end. It'll be the same
[19:36] thing.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Notice here's a thought. Don't forget
[19:39] it. I'll get to it some other time or
[19:41] some other message. But you know, God
[19:43] said, "Let every seed bring forth of its
[19:46] kind."
[19:47] Is that God's commandment?
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what good is any preacher or
[19:51] anybody else trying to make that word
[19:53] say something else?
[19:55] &gt;&gt; See, every word of God is a seed. Jesus
[19:58] said so.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; A seed of sore. So, so if Mark 16 is
[20:03] God's word, it'll bring forth of its
[20:05] kind. If Malachi 4 is God's word, it'll
[20:09] bring forth of its kind.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; And every other promise must bring forth
[20:13] of its kind. You see, see Satan out here
[20:16] in disguisement. He's trying to say it
[20:18] not. It's not so.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it?
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; See, Satan say, "Oh, that ain't for this
[20:24] day. That that that's some other time.
[20:26] That don't even mean that." Every seed
[20:28] must come forth of its kind.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; That's how God establishes Eden. Is that
[20:33] right?
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Here it is. That's how God establishes
[20:37] his church.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Every word after its kind. Man shall not
[20:42] live by bread alone, but by every word
[20:44] proceeding out of the mouth of God.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; See, Satan, he'll take something else.
[20:50] But God said, every seed after its kind,
[20:55] &gt;&gt; if the promise said, "These signs shall
[20:58] follow them that believe." Now, the
[21:00] church says, "Join the church, recite
[21:02] the creed, know the catechism." There's
[21:04] not such things in the whole Bible.
[21:07] Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "These signs shall
[21:10] follow them that believe. In my name,
[21:12] they shall cast out devils.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; If they take up serpents or drink deadly
[21:19] things, it won't harm them. If they lay
[21:21] their hands on the sick, they shall
[21:22] recover."
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Who is any man to deny that?
[21:27] &gt;&gt; See, every seed will bring forth of its
[21:29] kind. If you are a seed of God, an
[21:32] attribute, a son of God, then the word
[21:34] of God is sown in you.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and then when you hear the
[21:38] word of God, my sheep hear my voice, a
[21:40] stranger, they won't follow.
[21:44] You get it? Then every seed comes forth
[21:46] after its own kind. Now we find out that
[21:49] every seed bringing forth of its kind,
[21:51] there was no death in the new in that
[21:53] Eden. There will be no death in the new
[21:56] Eden.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; There was no nothing else but holiness,
[22:00] purity, and eternal life. Now by
[22:03] unbelief and all of God's word has
[22:07] brought the seed of unholiness in
[22:10] Satan's Eden.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; We are now entering in where Satan is
[22:15] taking the throne as the antichrist in a
[22:19] a
[22:23] sin,
[22:24] &gt;&gt; perverted religion.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; He started not upon I am Satan. I am the
[22:31] great angel. No, not upon that, but upon
[22:34] perverting God's word.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; And that's how he's brought his kingdom
[22:38] in every age. And now in this great
[22:41] deceitful age, ready to take his throne
[22:43] by his people,
[22:45] &gt;&gt; he's built himself an intellectual
[22:49] educated scientific Eden,
[22:54] &gt;&gt; right? Scientific preachers, scientific
[22:57] church, scientific theology, everything
[23:00] is scientific. Everything's on basis of
[23:03] knowledge. The whole church is built
[23:06] upon knowledge.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; It ain't built up on faith. One time I
[23:10] went into hold a meeting to a man's
[23:12] church. It was a great auditorium in the
[23:14] west, a fine man. And he denied these
[23:17] things that we're talking about. He was
[23:19] I liked him. Fine man, old man. When his
[23:23] congregation went out, it seated about
[23:25] 6,000 people. When his congregation went
[23:27] out in the afternoon service, about
[23:29] 1500, they were all fine dressed
[23:32] intellectuals. I sat there and watched
[23:34] them. He preached a very good sermon.
[23:36] The man did. And then he asked if
[23:38] anybody wanted to accept Christ just to
[23:39] raise up their hands. And no one raised
[23:42] up their hands. And finally, a woman
[23:44] raised up her hands. He said, "All
[23:45] right, now you're a Christian." And made
[23:47] her for baptism. And then when he went
[23:50] out, he dedicated the baby, kissed the
[23:52] little baby and made a prayer over it
[23:54] and dismissed the audience. When his
[23:56] congregation went out, all fine,
[23:59] scholarly, educated people, then I
[24:01] stayed on the side to shake the man's
[24:03] hand and wishing God speak as he went
[24:05] out. And when I did, here come my crowd
[24:07] in. They couldn't let him in while his
[24:09] crowd is there. Here come mine in
[24:10] wheelchairs, stretchers, straight
[24:12] jackets, insane, and everything else.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; See the difference?
[24:18] That's it. That's the thing I'm talking
[24:20] about. See, it's something different.
[24:23] When by scientific knowledge, you can
[24:26] make an understanding gospel. You he
[24:29] that believeth on Jesus Christ shall not
[24:31] be condemned. See, but these signs shall
[24:34] follow them that believe. See, he fails
[24:36] to put that in there. See, she believeth
[24:38] on Jesus Christ. She's saved. If these
[24:41] signs follow the believer,
[24:43] &gt;&gt; and he that heareth my word, not just
[24:46] may not hear it with his ears, but
[24:47] understand it.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anybody can hear it. A
[24:51] prostitute can hear it and remain a
[24:52] prostitute. See, a drunker can hear it,
[24:55] a liar can hear it, and still remain a
[24:57] liar. But he that understandeth my word
[25:00] and believeth on him that sent me has
[25:02] everlasting life. There you are. See,
[25:04] and no man can do that except God for
[25:07] orain him. Jesus said, "No man can come
[25:10] to me except my father draws him and all
[25:11] the father's given me will come to me."
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all the sovereignty and
[25:17] fornowledge of God.
[25:19] He lives alone and nobody tells him what
[25:21] to do
[25:22] &gt;&gt; now by unbelief and though taking all
[25:25] the word of God has brought a seed of
[25:29] unbelief, unholy, sinful hatred and
[25:34] eternal death is in this sinful
[25:38] intellectual church age.
[25:40] Now you got it. And this day that when
[25:43] the whole world is religious,
[25:47] did you know that
[25:48] &gt;&gt; the whole world is religious?
[25:50] &gt;&gt; And in this religious age, big churches
[25:53] on every corner. Everything, the whole
[25:56] thing winds up in Satan being worshiped.
[25:58] Here it is right here in the Bible.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. And in this intellectual
[26:04] theological seminary that's brought out
[26:07] an intellectual person that's been
[26:10] trained how to speak, what to do, how to
[26:13] make their emotions and everything like
[26:15] psychology three to four years to know
[26:18] how to deal with a man's mind. See, it's
[26:22] the spirit of God is not something that
[26:25] you is schooled into you. Amen.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; It's something that's predestinated into
[26:29] you by the hand of Almighty God.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Your experiences cannot be schooled or
[26:35] taught into you. It's predestinated by
[26:38] God's hand and God's forn knowledge into
[26:40] you.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, they brought forth
[26:43] this great Eden that they now live in a
[26:45] church world's Eden. They're all uniting
[26:47] together now at the great ecumenical
[26:48] council and going to have the world
[26:50] church all coming under one head where
[26:53] Satan will be thrown just exactly. And
[26:55] the last call's going out to catch the
[26:57] bride before she gets into that. For
[26:59] once in that she's tucked the mark of
[27:02] the beast and doomed.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; She'll never come out of it. That's
[27:06] where he said, "Come out from among
[27:07] them, my people, before he goes into
[27:09] him." See, come out from among and be
[27:11] separated. Now, hatred and death and
[27:15] eternal separation from God in this
[27:17] Eden, lust, filth, perversion. How? by
[27:23] sewing the wrong seed.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of the vision I seen before I
[27:28] ever met the Pentecostal people of that
[27:31] man going around the world and white.
[27:32] You've heard me tell it many times. The
[27:34] one coming behind him sewing seeds of
[27:36] discord, but he wanted barely in Eve in
[27:40] the Garden of Eden by the lust of Eve
[27:45] for sin.
[27:48] The lust for Eve of sin. And if Eve
[27:51] lusted for knowledge,
[27:55] it was sin. And when we lust for
[27:57] knowledge, want a PhD LLD, it's sin to
[28:01] do so.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; That's strong statements, but that's the
[28:06] truth.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; No matter how strong it is, is still the
[28:08] truth.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. the lust for knowledge,
[28:11] understanding. The thing of it is is
[28:14] today we don't try to establish the word
[28:18] of God in the people's hearts.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; We're trying to establish ourselves.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Churches are trying to establish the
[28:25] doctrine of the church in a person's
[28:26] heart.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; We are commanded to establish the word
[28:30] of God. Paul said, "I didn't come to you
[28:32] with enticing words of man that your
[28:34] faith might rest upon the knowledge of
[28:35] man, but I come to you in power and
[28:37] manifestations of the Holy Ghost that
[28:39] your faith might rest in God."
[28:42] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Man must establish yourself. We find it
[28:46] amongst Let God do something first.
