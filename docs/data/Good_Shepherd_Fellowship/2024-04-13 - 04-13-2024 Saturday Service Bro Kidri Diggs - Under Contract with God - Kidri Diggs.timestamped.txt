[51:50] 17 let's just back up let's just start
[51:52] at verse one everybody all
[51:54] right amen verse one and when Abraham
[51:57] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[52:00] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[52:04] the almighty God walk before me and be
[52:07] thou perfect and I will make my Covenant
[52:10] between me and thee and will multiply
[52:14] thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his
[52:17] face and God talked with him saying as
[52:21] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[52:24] and thou shal be a father of many
[52:27] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[52:30] be called Abram but thy name shall be
[52:33] Abraham for a father of many nations
[52:36] have I made thee and I will make thee
[52:40] exceedingly exceeding fruitful and I
[52:44] will make nations of thee and Kings
[52:47] shall come out of thee and I will
[52:49] establish my Covenant between me and
[52:53] thee and thy seed after thee in their
[52:56] generation for an Everlasting Covenant
[52:59] to be a god unto thee and to thy seed
[53:04] after thee and I will give unto thee and
[53:09] to thy seed after thee the land wherein
[53:13] thou are a stranger all the land of
[53:16] Canaan for an everlasting possession and
[53:19] I will be their God Amen Hebrews chapter
[53:25] 6 Hebrews 6
[53:31] and verse 13 Hebrews 6 and 13 the Bible
[53:36] says for when God made promise to
[53:39] Abraham because he could swear by no
[53:42] greater he swear by himself saying
[53:44] surely blessings I Will Bless thee and
[53:48] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[53:50] after he had patiently endured he
[53:53] obtained the promise for men verily
[53:55] swear by the greater and an oath for
[53:59] confirmation is to them an end of all
[54:02] Strife wherein God willing more
[54:04] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of
[54:07] Promise the immutability of his counsel
[54:11] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[54:15] immutable things in which it was
[54:18] impossible for God to lie we might have
[54:21] a strong consolation who have fled for
[54:24] Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set
[54:29] before us amen may the Lord add a
[54:33] blessing to his word amen you can um
[54:36] have your seats by the grace of
[54:39] God
[54:45] hallelujah you know by God's grace
[54:48] tonight you
[54:49] know uh just around the thought the
[54:53] Lord's just really been kind of dealing
[54:55] with me
[54:56] um my subject tonight is the Everlasting
[55:00] Covenant the Everlasting Covenant now
[55:07] um one thing about this before we get
[55:11] into if it's God's grace before we get
[55:14] into the actual Covenant let's
[55:17] understand what God did first first of
[55:20] all when you look at the Covenant he
[55:23] said God made it very very clear he said
[55:26] Abraham now I'm going to do something
[55:29] and I'm going to give you a covenant and
[55:31] this Covenant is going to be between you
[55:33] and me can I get amen God told Abraham
[55:37] he said what I'm going to do is going to
[55:38] be between you and me and then but God
[55:42] didn't stopped there he said and to your
[55:44] seed after you so what I want us to
[55:47] understand tonight that this Covenant
[55:49] what God did every promise that he gave
[55:53] to Abraham he also gave to us
[55:57] hallelujah hallelujah and he called
[55:59] Abraham the father of Faith Hallelujah
[56:02] and and he said you know I'm going to
[56:05] establish this Covenant now nobody did
[56:09] it Hallelujah but God hallelujah Every
[56:12] Blessing every every every multiplying
[56:15] and everything that Abraham possessed in
[56:18] his life came from God hallelujah but it
[56:22] was a part of the Covenant that God gave
[56:24] to Abraham but I want you to
[56:26] understand tonight that what God did for
[56:29] Abraham he also established with his
[56:32] seed after him Hallelujah and you know
[56:36] when we look in the Bible you know God
[56:38] uh uh he's he's you know is one of my
[56:41] favorite words God is very strategic
[56:44] Hallelujah he's strategic amen God
[56:49] is he's very direct God is intentional
[56:53] he knows exactly what he's doing God God
[56:56] doesn't do anything by perhaps or maybe
[57:00] that was just by chance no he's
[57:02] strategic Hallelujah if God ever heals
[57:05] you he meant to heal you if God ever
[57:08] bless you he meant to bless you but I'll
[57:11] say it like this God saved me he meant
[57:14] to save me Hallelujah that's just who he
[57:18] is God Don't Make Mistakes God don't do
[57:21] a maybe or might be he's very
[57:24] intentional Hallelujah so I can say
[57:27] tonight if you're here listening to the
[57:29] word of God you're here by
[57:34] purpose Hallelujah this not no
[57:38] coincidence oh it's Sunday I'm going to
[57:40] church no there was a purpose before the
[57:43] foundation of the world and God saw you
[57:46] here but let's understand something
[57:48] church when we think of the Covenant
[57:51] between God and man now in the beginning
[57:55] God always laid need something out for
[57:57] the believer amen and and when he first
[58:00] started he gave adam a covenant too amen
[58:03] he told Adam hey everything around here
[58:06] is yours just don't touch
[58:09] that am I in the book right Hallelujah
[58:12] he said everything is your just don't
[58:14] touch that if you don't touch that I
[58:16] continue to bless you everything will be
[58:18] all right you'll continue to be a God
[58:20] but the day you touch it is the day you
[58:23] die those were the circumstances of his
[58:26] Covenant so as long as Adam stayed with
[58:29] the with the Covenant between him and
[58:31] God everything was all right but one
[58:33] thing about man man always messes up his
[58:37] part of the
[58:39] agreement man always mess up his part of
[58:42] agreement but God hallelujah is so
[58:46] strategic Hallelujah you look at what
[58:49] the devil the devil say hey I'm going
[58:51] get in creation I'm going to mess up
[58:53] everything but he couldn't mess up the
[58:55] Covenant
[58:56] right Hallelujah because it was just a
[58:58] part of God to redeem man so God would
[59:02] allow things to happen so he can show
[59:04] you what's really in your
[59:07] Covenant Hallelujah see I I give you a
[59:10] little one onone right now on real
[59:12] estate Hallelujah you know if if you if

[59:24] and he got a price and the buyer see the
[59:26] house and you know what the buyer got to
[59:28] do the buyer got to meet the seller's
[59:31] desire Hallelujah he can't just come in

[59:40] contract Hallelujah and you know what
[59:42] happens that seller lays out he say hey

[1:00:16] ridiculous things and God just wants to
[1:00:19] remind us don't you realize what your
[1:00:22] life is worth don't you realize what the
[1:00:25] salvation I've given you is worth don't

[1:06:03] life of Abraham and see what God did
[1:06:06] because he said I'm going to what I do
[1:06:08] for you I'm going to do for your seed
[1:06:11] after you and we look one of the first
[1:06:14] things God did Hallelujah he built up in
[1:06:18] in the midst of Abraham going through
[1:06:20] trials what was God doing God was
[1:06:22] building up his confidence
[1:06:25] woo Hallelujah you ought to be confident
[1:06:28] when God gives you a promise see when
[1:06:31] God first gave Abraham the promise
[1:06:33] Abraham didn't believe so what God did
[1:06:36] God allowed him to go through things to
[1:06:38] build up his confidence that was in the
[1:06:40] Covenant Hallelujah but church I want
[1:06:43] you to realize one thing about our God
[1:06:45] he's so
[1:06:48] strategic Hallelujah he's so strategic
[1:06:51] I'm going to say something going to
[1:06:52] shake your boots right now God is so
[1:06:55] strategic he will say things he'll speak
[1:06:58] promises about you in your life knowing
[1:07:01] you don't believe it
[1:07:07] yet he said Abraham you going to have a
[1:07:10] son by Sarah Abraham didn't even believe
[1:07:12] it but did that change the
[1:07:15] contract did that change the promise did
[1:07:18] that stop God from bringing him to it
[1:07:20] hallu so it don't matter whether you see
[1:07:22] it or not you can't stop the Fulfillment
[1:07:25] of what God told you Hallelujah it will
[1:07:28] come to
[1:07:29] pass Hallelujah that contract has been
[1:07:36] confirmed Hallelujah he said he'll speak
[1:07:39] things in your life knowing you will
[1:07:41] even believe yet he comes to Abraham and
[1:07:43] Sarah say hey y'all going to have a
[1:07:45] child the first thing they start doing
[1:07:46] they start looking at they their own
[1:07:49] circumstances Sarah say I'm old shall
[1:07:52] have pleasure with my Lord did that stop
[1:07:54] the contract
[1:07:56] did that make it
[1:07:57] void did that make it out of date did it
[1:08:00] expire no God said no you see you see
[1:08:04] and then Abraham come Abraham say but
[1:08:08] I'm old I'm this I'm that did that stop
[1:08:11] the promise no Hallelujah so don't worry
[1:08:15] about Hallelujah if you don't see it
[1:08:17] right there stay with
[1:08:18] it stay with it because it's up to God
[1:08:21] to bring it to pass Hallelujah because
[1:08:23] look this is the thing about the old
[1:08:25] contract God comes and he says AR he
[1:08:28] comes and says hey the last people I had
[1:08:30] on contract they fail they couldn't do
[1:08:33] their part Adam and Eve couldn't do
[1:08:35] their part they they were under contract
[1:08:37] and they couldn't do it he said but this
[1:08:39] time it's going to be
[1:08:44] unconditional this thing is going to
[1:08:46] stand Hallelujah it'll stand in a
[1:08:49] hurricane it'll stand in a snowfall
[1:08:52] it'll stand in a tornado it'll stand
[1:08:54] when you lose your job it'll stand when
[1:08:56] CS is in your body hallelujah it's
[1:09:01] unconditional God has us under a
[1:09:03] contract that has nothing to do with
[1:09:06] what we can
[1:09:09] do somebody ought to be saying
[1:09:15] hallelujah cuz you can make
[1:09:18] mistakes but the contract still stands
[1:09:22] the Covenant is still there that's right
[1:09:23] did Abraham make mistakes
[1:09:26] yes pretty of them but all those
[1:09:29] mistakes couldn't stop him from
[1:09:31] fulfilling what God said about him
[1:09:34] Hallelujah and church as we look and we
[1:09:37] see what God what God did in the word of
[1:09:42] God Church let's go back let's go back
[1:09:45] to
[1:09:47] Genesis Genesis
[1:09:49] 17 I want you to understand something a
[1:09:52] lot of times we look at the word of we
[1:09:55] look at the revealed word what we have
[1:09:58] and we're quick to say you know God did
[1:10:00] this through brother Brown God did this
[1:10:02] through Moses god do this to Paul you
[1:10:05] need to ask yourself am I
[1:10:10] se am I Bri H so Hallelujah if brother
[1:10:14] brandham did Hallelujah so can I if if
[1:10:19] if if if Paul did it so can I if if if
[1:10:23] if Sarah did it so can I Hallelujah
[1:10:26] church that's what we need to fall back
[1:10:28] on Hallelujah who you are who we are
[1:10:32] amen see we're not connected Hallelujah
[1:10:36] by uhuh let's just say Jews and Gentiles
[1:10:39] yeah I'm a gentile you say hey no I
[1:10:42] can't trace my bloodline back to a
[1:10:44] natural Seed of Abraham no that ain't
[1:10:46] what we're
[1:10:48] doing we're not doing this by natural
[1:10:50] tra we're not looking up your an your an
[1:10:53] ancestral uh de and all that no we ain't
[1:10:56] doing that we are royal seeds of
[1:11:00] Faith right and when you H you tap into
[1:11:03] the Holy Spirit and you believe on
[1:11:05] Christ Hallelujah the prop of God say
[1:11:08] then you know you are Abraham's seed
[1:11:11] Hallelujah because Abraham could see God
[1:11:14] for who he was when everybody else
[1:11:16] didn't even know hallelujah look at the
[1:11:18] promise of Abraham Church Hallelujah
[1:11:21] Abraham saw one God when there was three
[1:11:27] right y'all don't let that go over your
[1:11:29] head now don't let that go over your
[1:11:31] head that's why we not Baptist that's
[1:11:33] why we're not Catholic that's why we're
[1:11:35] not Presbyterian because Abraham saw
[1:11:38] three coming and he saw one Hallelujah W
[1:11:42] that's in the promised church for us not
[1:11:44] to be
[1:11:46] confused because even though Abraham
[1:11:49] Hallelujah he couldn't see himself
[1:11:51] bringing forth a child he still knew who
[1:11:54] God was
[1:11:56] that's right cuz you remember Hallelujah
[1:11:58] when the three came to Abraham Abraham
[1:12:01] looked at all three of those men coming
[1:12:03] maybe we should say the father Son and
[1:12:05] Holy Spirit Hallelujah you see those
[1:12:07] three coming Abraham looked at all three
[1:12:09] of them bowed down and say yes my
[1:12:12] Lord why did he do that that was in the
[1:12:16] sea Hallelujah that was in the
[1:12:22] Revelation and that's why we can follow
[1:12:25] this message of the yah Hallelujah
[1:12:28] because Abraham saw God for who he
[1:12:32] was and you notice how it went through
[1:12:35] the generations you had Abraham Isaac
[1:12:39] Jacob and Joseph Hallelujah you look at
[1:12:42] all that coming down through the seed
[1:12:44] amen let's just start with Abraham one
[1:12:46] thing that came out of that seed was
[1:12:48] what faith faith is in your contract you

[1:12:54] have to take God that his
[1:12:56] word you just got to believe it

[1:21:25] righteous with the wicked he said if I
[1:21:26] can find 50 will you just have mercy God

[1:22:13] prayers of
[1:22:15] Abraham God could not deny those prayers
[1:22:18] that was going up for the family and now
[1:22:21] the prophet comes and he says all that

[1:24:15] keep and if that man Hallelujah would
[1:24:18] have took Sarah and Mar Sarah it would
[1:24:20] made the promise of God Bo now what you
[1:24:23] need to do is go back to the promise

[1:24:27] Ghost the scripture says hallelujah and
[1:24:30] the promise is unto you and unto your
[1:24:36] children and unto those who are a far
[1:24:40] off Hallelujah church we have promises
[1:24:43] and things that God has given to the
[1:24:45] seed after Abraham that we need to tap
[1:24:49] into right
[1:24:52] Hallelujah but what I love about Church
[1:24:54] don't get nervous I'm about to close
[1:24:56] what I love about it when we see what
[1:24:58] God did for Abraham we ought to be able
[1:25:01] to go back and say Yes
[1:25:04] Lord cuz the promise and I keep
[1:25:06] repeating this the promise is for you
[1:25:09] and your seed after him how many believe
[1:25:13] Abraham was
[1:25:15] blessed anybody ever made
[1:25:19] mistakes ever ever ever did somebody
[1:25:22] wrong what did God say he say I'll make
[1:25:25] your enemies your foot

[1:25:40] lie all God want to do is make sure

[1:25:44] promise and then he takes the person who
[1:25:47] was right and make him

[1:25:58] him man you told my
[1:26:01] favor you do my favor somebody
[1:26:04] apologizing to you for what you
[1:26:08] did the man apologized to Abraham for
[1:26:11] what he did why because God keeps his
[1:26:16] word oh my look my daughter the one who
[1:26:22] came here with me or her job they they
[1:26:26] they pretty much uh set her up to get
[1:26:28] rid of her cuz she's a Christian you
[1:26:30] know how that work there'll be somebody
[1:26:32] looking at you jealous of you or
[1:26:33] whatever the case is and all you doing
[1:26:35] is just working for the Lord Mighty own
[1:26:37] business they don't like it cuz you
[1:26:39] clean looking you ain't got no makeup on
[1:26:41] you ain't got no butterfly eyelashes way
[1:26:43] out here in front of your nose and all
[1:26:45] you ain't got none of that stuff you
[1:26:46] just you just living for God you know
[1:26:48] what I mean and I you know I ain't
[1:26:50] saying that to to laugh but what I'm
[1:26:52] saying there's a there's a certain look
[1:26:53] in character that a woman looks at a
[1:26:56] Christian woman and
[1:26:57] say in their heart of hearts that's what
[1:27:00] they desire to be real Beauty Hallelujah
[1:27:03] and you know what you know she don't do
[1:27:05] all that other stuff and what they did
[1:27:07] was they had some some coupons and
[1:27:09] different things and everybody was using
[1:27:10] them when she used it it was
[1:27:13] wrong everybody else used it now when
[1:27:15] she used it uhoh we got we got to we got
[1:27:18] to uh hold her to charge we got to do
[1:27:20] something about this so the manager told
[1:27:23] her say hey you can't come back to work
[1:27:24] till we have a talk so she comes and
[1:27:27] comes back to work the manager sits down
[1:27:29] with her and and and she begin to pray
[1:27:31] she say Lord you know I'm just trying to
[1:27:34] live for you and give me some extra
[1:27:36] dollars and uh uh whatever your will is
[1:27:38] Lord I I accept it so she get in how
[1:27:41] often we do that do you ever go in
[1:27:44] before a trial or go in before something
[1:27:46] and say Lord whatever your will
[1:27:49] is church I do that when I walk in the
[1:27:52] bank Hallelujah I walk in the bank I
[1:27:55] don't be afraid of them telling me no
[1:27:57] because they can only tell me what God's
[1:27:59] will
[1:28:00] is if they say no that's God's Will and
[1:28:03] they say yes that's God's will that's
[1:28:05] the attitude we need to take Hallelujah
[1:28:07] when you go into things put God first
[1:28:11] because God has to honor his Covenant
[1:28:13] Hallelujah he said in blessings I Will
[1:28:16] Bless
[1:28:17] thee and multiply I will multiply thee
[1:28:20] Hallelujah so when I go into a place I
[1:28:22] expect multiplication
[1:28:25] because that's what happened with
[1:28:26] Abraham Hallelujah and if it don't
[1:28:29] happen that means it was God's will for
[1:28:31] me not to get it Hallelujah see then you

[1:32:37] you start back up
[1:32:40] again you talking about favor is in our
[1:32:44] seed so she didn't have to take days off
[1:32:47] for Thanksgiving she didn't have to take
[1:32:49] days off for Christmas she didn't have
[1:32:51] to take days off for New Year God gave
[1:32:54] her time
[1:32:57] off praise the
[1:33:00] Lord and when she came back when she
[1:33:03] started back that's my longarm oh my run
[1:33:06] out of time when she came back after not
[1:33:10] being there for those what almost month

[1:33:30] your enemies Hallelujah is God's
[1:33:33] enemy he said I'll curse those that
[1:33:35] curse you I'll bless those that bless
[1:33:38] you and she didn't have to plead her
[1:33:40] case that manager went to everybody else
[1:33:43] and say this is what we're going to do
[1:33:44] for Kiara she didn't have to say a
[1:33:50] word why because that's passed down for
[1:33:54] the seed after him Church you don't have
[1:33:57] to fight your battles God
[1:34:00] will it's in the seed so let's look as
[1:34:04] we go down we see what happens and I'm
[1:34:07] going run this down real real fast I'mma
[1:34:09] close as we look and we see what
[1:34:11] happened went from Abraham building a
[1:34:13] faith God changed his name to a father
[1:34:16] of Nations and Abraham steps into it why
[1:34:19] because God put a word out there God put
[1:34:22] a word out there on only for him
[1:34:24] Hallelujah and then he said you're going
[1:34:26] to have a child with Sarah only Sarah
[1:34:29] Hallelujah and you know what he had the
[1:34:31] child now here comes Isaac Hallelujah
[1:34:33] and then more of what's in that seed
[1:34:35] start to come out you don't have to
[1:34:37] worry about perfect love he was already
[1:34:38] in the
[1:34:40] seed Hallelujah remember the Bible says
[1:34:44] hallelujah he who lays life down shall
[1:34:46] gain it hallelujah what did Isaac do he
[1:34:49] laid his life down Hallelujah Glory he
[1:34:52] said hey Dad we got the altar we got the
[1:34:55] wood we got all this stuff but where's
[1:34:57] the sacrifice and Abraham speaks over
[1:34:59] his son and says God shall provide
[1:35:01] himself a sacrifice but what I want you
[1:35:03] to understand Isaac had already laid his
[1:35:05] life
[1:35:06] down Hallelujah and if you lay your life
[1:35:09] down you'll gain it again why because
[1:35:11] that's the promise of Abraham Hallelujah
[1:35:14] but you know what church there's a part
[1:35:16] in that seed that we look at that comes
[1:35:18] after Abraham boy it look bad
[1:35:24] bad and it's called
[1:35:29] Jacob I was saying the other night I was
[1:35:32] preaching yall know Jacob was the first
[1:35:34] one who was
[1:35:36] tricking that's the saying they got in
[1:35:38] the world boy she she out there tricking
[1:35:40] he tricking everybody tricking Jacob was
[1:35:43] the first one who was tricking cuz every
[1:35:45] time you turn around he was tricking
[1:35:46] somebody out of
[1:35:47] something trick trick his brother out
[1:35:50] his birth right birth right trick his
[1:35:51] father out the blessing he went the
[1:35:53] father Lord trick him out of some Camel
[1:35:55] trick trick trick trick trick trick
[1:35:57] Jacob was Jacob was the master of tricks
[1:36:00] and you know what his nature his nature
[1:36:03] at that time didn't fit with the
[1:36:07] promise but he was a
[1:36:10] part and just like all of us we were
[1:36:13] born in sin shapen in iniquity but God
[1:36:17] had to had to Hallelujah had to bump
[1:36:22] into us with this truth
[1:36:24] Hallelujah because this truth was the
[1:36:26] only thing that could change our nature
[1:36:29] Hallelujah this truth was the only thing
[1:36:32] Hallelujah that could turn us into a new
[1:36:34] creation Baptist Doctrine couldn't hold
[1:36:36] us Pentecostal Doctrine couldn't hold us
[1:36:39] Catholic Doctrine could hold us so God
[1:36:40] had to bump into us with something that
[1:36:42] could change us so we could match the
[1:36:45] testimony of what he told
[1:36:47] Abraham Hallelujah and he says look your
[1:36:50] name is Jacob which is a planter and
[1:36:52] Jacob was tricking trick and
[1:36:54] tricken then he had to get to a
[1:36:57] place where he got sick of who he
[1:37:01] was that's in the Seas
[1:37:03] yes that's in the cover right you have
[1:37:07] to get sick of that owe you you have to
[1:37:12] get sick of your
[1:37:13] flesh and that's what Jacob did he got
[1:37:16] sick of who he was and his past begin to
[1:37:20] bring up old
[1:37:22] fears now he's he's God told him said I
[1:37:25] want you to go back to your Homeland go
[1:37:26] back where you came from and on his way
[1:37:28] back his past met him he said Esau's
[1:37:34] coming and you know the last thing you
[1:37:36] heard from
[1:37:39] Esau I'mma kill
[1:37:42] you I'mma kill you Jacob you stole my
[1:37:46] Birthright I'mma kill you cuz remember
[1:37:50] he left home because of Esau
[1:37:53] and his last testimony his last memory
[1:37:56] of his relationship with Esau was he was
[1:37:58] running for his life now God is telling
[1:38:01] him I want you to go meet that
[1:38:06] fear I'm getting into the just of
[1:38:10] closing all of us in here tonight we
[1:38:14] have to meet that in which we are afraid
[1:38:17] of now I'm talking about in your service
[1:38:20] to
[1:38:21] God you got to meet that and Conquer it
[1:38:25] because that's in the Covenant hallu and
[1:38:28] Jacob had to look at himself and say you
[1:38:31] know what this is not who I want to be
[1:38:33] Hallelujah I don't want to be afraid of
[1:38:35] my
[1:38:38] past but one there one thing about some
[1:38:40] people that're in church they'll come
[1:38:44] and pay TI and do all these things and
[1:38:46] still be a slave to their
[1:38:49] past I can't we can't go in that

[1:40:03] saved me he saved me from my own fleshly
[1:40:06] desires W that's the power of the
[1:40:10] Covenant Hallelujah see the blood of
[1:40:12] bulls and goats couldn't change your
[1:40:14] desire so God hallelujah he made a
[1:40:16] covenant with his blood Hallelujah his
[1:40:20] is his blood he's on the other end of
[1:40:21] that Chinese piece of paper h Hallelujah
[1:40:24] Glory oh my church you know you have

[1:41:46] better Hallelujah you better get down to
[1:41:49] business with God and make sure you've

[1:41:54] what it was about for Jacob it was about

[1:41:59] about being changed that's the promise
[1:42:01] of Abraham than Hallelujah Jacob had to
[1:42:05] look at his past remember AR he was Esau

[1:47:25] the Covenant he said you know what I'm
[1:47:26] going to do now he said you're no longer

[1:48:12] seed Hallelujah a bride she's going into
[1:48:16] the
[1:48:17] chamber
[1:48:19] Hallelujah not the church with a pride
[1:48:22] oh my in my
[1:48:24] closing as we look at that whole journey
[1:48:28] from Abraham and his seed after him last
[1:48:31] one we want to look
[1:48:32] at look what God did through
[1:48:38] Joseph he overcame
[1:48:41] jealousy he overcame envy and hatred he
[1:48:44] overcame being lied on he overcame
[1:48:47] bondage being thrown in jail W he
[1:48:51] overcame he overcame disappointment cuz
[1:48:53] he was forgotten in jail hallelujah oh
[1:48:56] my and he overcame his own self-
[1:48:59] bitterness Hallelujah he didn't get
[1:49:01] bitter in the midst of going through his
[1:49:03] trial look at all the things Hallelujah
[1:49:06] that's promised to the seed after
[1:49:09] Abraham you can overcome he overcame
[1:49:12] lust demons parer's wife was chasing
[1:49:17] him y'all realize that that woman was
[1:49:20] chasing him it wasn't just one day she
[1:49:24] you man come has a hard day
[1:49:30] worship man M don't be doing his work
[1:49:32] she come up
[1:49:36] again just like how those men and those
[1:49:38] women those worldly ones out there
[1:49:40] chasing God's children right because
[1:49:43] they they want something clean and
[1:49:45] genuine
[1:49:47] hallelujah oh my Jacob I mean Joseph he
[1:49:51] overcame that Hallelujah
[1:49:53] he overcame all the things that he was
[1:49:55] going through he overcame Hallelujah
[1:49:57] being put in jail even though he was
[1:50:00] innocent he overcame bondage he overcame
[1:50:03] his own mind battles probably saying
[1:50:06] Lord what did I do to deserve this but
[1:50:09] in the midst of it all he was telling
[1:50:10] people I can't sin against my
[1:50:13] God hallelujah that's the aborah have
[1:50:17] seed to stand strong in the midst of all
[1:50:20] adversity
[1:50:24] keep in mind it ain't you doing it it's
[1:50:27] the grace of
[1:50:29] God because he said Hallelujah I'll
[1:50:32] never leave you nor forsake you
[1:50:34] Hallelujah and you look at how the
[1:50:37] promise of Abraham was reflected out
[1:50:39] through the sea after him and they
[1:50:42] obtained the promise Hallelujah just
[1:50:45] because of what they came just because
[1:50:48] of being deceived after Abraham and you
[1:50:51] can see everyone reflected
[1:50:53] the god of my
[1:50:55] father
[1:50:57] Hallelujah the god of my father that was
[1:51:00] the testimony the god of my
[1:51:04] father
[1:51:05] church that went all the way down to our
[1:51:09] day cuz remember before Elisha got the
[1:51:13] promise what did he do he called out the
[1:51:17] god of his
[1:51:18] father Hallelujah and Elijah Hallelujah
[1:51:22] on Mount camon what did he do he called
[1:51:24] out the god of his father see Abraham
[1:51:28] seed has a right to call on the god of
[1:51:31] their
[1:51:34] father because it's in the seed it's in
[1:51:38] the Covenant Church we're in a covenant
[1:51:40] with God and I want each and every one
[1:51:42] of us to go back and look at the life of
[1:51:45] Abraham and what God gave to him at
[1:51:48] every promise remember the prophet of
[1:51:49] God said he said he said the right midle
[1:51:52] attitude will bring every Divine promise
[1:51:55] to
[1:51:58] pass if we can believe it if we can
[1:52:02] believe it Hallelujah just like women
[1:52:05] that are Barren HJ God opened up Sarah's
[1:52:08] wom why because that's a part of the
[1:52:10] promise Hallelujah I know a sister who
[1:52:13] was baren after she got prayer she had
[1:52:15] twins
[1:52:22] I know I I know a sister say she wanted
[1:52:24] a
[1:52:27] she remember remember that one that the
[1:52:31] the the the boy or the child was blind
[1:52:34] uh and the prophet say they didn't even
[1:52:36] have eye sockets he said he started to
[1:52:39] pray this is the testimony so he started
[1:52:41] to
[1:52:41] pray but he stopped right in the midst
[1:52:44] of the prayer and he said what color
[1:52:47] eyes you want
[1:52:53] W oh my and been Paul's testimony he
[1:52:57] said he said dad asked him what color
[1:52:59] eyes he want and and and the person said
[1:53:01] blue he said he looked and saw a blue
[1:53:03] Street coming out the
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:09] sky oh my
[1:53:11] Hallelujah that ain't just for our
[1:53:15] Prophet that's what the see children of
[1:53:18] Abraham
[1:53:23] look I might not never need squirrels
[1:53:25] but I got a
[1:53:27] promise Hallelujah I might not never
[1:53:29] need to talk to a storm but I got a
[1:53:31] promise Hallelujah and it's so in in
[1:53:34] fact right now when I was flying out
[1:53:36] here hallelujah and he was he was
[1:53:38] watching it I was flying out here from

[1:53:43] was blowing so bad they delayed the
[1:53:46] flight they said no we can't we can't
[1:53:48] this was the pilot the pilot words he
[1:53:50] said we can't fly right now because the
[1:53:52] winds are so bad and it it's going to be
[1:53:54] a very bumpy ride all the way down there
[1:53:56] so we just waiting till all the planes

[2:01:17] you for your word
[2:01:20] hallelujah yes Lord
[2:01:22] Lord
[2:01:26] amen you know when Brother D was talking
[2:01:29] there we were close right
[2:01:32] here and he was talking about something
[2:01:35] that uh is getting away from the
[2:01:39] church and he he mention fasting I just
[2:01:42] I just wrote a little thing down here
[2:01:45] just to remind myself of how much even
[2:01:48] science medical
[2:01:50] doctors are beginning to discover the
[2:01:53] benefit that's right of
[2:01:56] fasting praise the Lord that even uh
[2:02:00] they beginning to realize that's one of
[2:02:02] uh uh the best meod that most of these
[2:02:05] doctors are introducing into their uh uh
[2:02:09] weight loss you know program you know
[2:02:12] fasting and different different things
[2:02:14] but you will realize that for the
[2:02:18] believer it's it's more of or
[2:02:23] discipline
[2:02:25] right it's not about starving
[2:02:29] yourself it's
[2:02:33] just it's just coming into that place
[2:02:36] and and uh uh you know U taking on some
[2:02:40] Godly discipline where you can just set
[2:02:43] a set a set a time aside that you just
[2:02:46] you just want to be with the
[2:02:48] Lord you know brother Brandon taught us
[2:02:51] that it is not something that you just
[2:02:53] you just jump into and you just take it
[2:02:55] you got to pray about it because all
[2:02:57] hell is going to be against you praise
[2:02:59] the Lord you know people give themsel
[2:03:02] you know over to uh fasting and and
[2:03:05] sometimes they come out with uh with
[2:03:07] different things you know you got to be
[2:03:09] ready for it but it has to be something
[2:03:12] that uh is more of a of a spiritual
[2:03:15] discipline to the believer you know like
[2:03:18] I said to to most of the people you know
[2:03:20] uh the religious word has set a time
[2:03:23] clock to fasting brother Bram said no he
[2:03:27] said it's how much he said your body
[2:03:29] needs food and water to be able to
[2:03:31] sustain itself so if you discipline
[2:03:33] yourself to spend uh just 3 hours before
[2:03:36] the Lord or just uh uh uh to to to Asain
[2:03:40] from breakfast uh give up your breakfast
[2:03:43] and just spend that morning time with
[2:03:44] the Lord or uh stay from the morning
[2:03:47] till noon just what your body can be
[2:03:50] able to take
[2:03:52] because it's something that you have to
[2:03:53] grow
[2:03:54] into if you just uh set yourself aside
[2:03:58] and say well I want to fast s to say and
[2:04:00] you don't have the spiritual strength to
[2:04:03] be able to endal you will just be PL in
[2:04:05] your mind and pl in your body but it's
[2:04:09] all about
[2:04:12] discipline praise the
[2:04:15] lord well we want to thank the Lord for
[2:04:18] the word tonight reminding us all the
[2:04:20] things that is with in the Covenant amen
[2:04:24] all the benefit that can come with the
[2:04:25] Covenant we can look in the life of
[2:04:27] Abraham we look in the life of Isaac we
[2:04:30] look in the life of Jacob and even in
[2:04:33] the life of Joseph because the promise
[2:04:35] was to Abraham and his seed praise the
[2:04:40] Lord we thank the Lord tonight we can we
