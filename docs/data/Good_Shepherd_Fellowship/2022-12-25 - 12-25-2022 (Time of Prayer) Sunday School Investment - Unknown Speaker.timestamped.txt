[1:41] foreign
[1:52] come to change his Creed
[1:56] then that's for the turtle come
[1:59] I wonder if the same God isn't just as
[2:03] able today to rise itself in Isaiah
[2:07] rise us up somebody
[2:10] that can tell us that our solemn Feast
[2:12] becomes esteem
[2:15] we should be ready for the Rapture at
[2:18] this time of the age
[2:20] look where we're at
[2:23] something needed
[2:25] I'm not back to the word
[2:28] we're promised over in Malachi that we
[2:30] would be brought back to the word there
[2:32] is no faith
[2:33] and so let's remember that
[2:36] now
[2:37] but the the price that this young fellow
[2:41] was asked to pay was too great he had to
[2:44] sell out all of his worldly possessions
[2:46] in order to have this eternal life
[2:50] you might not have a dime
[2:52] but yet you do hold things that it's
[2:57] worldly possession
[3:00] for instance I've been balling our women
[3:02] out so much about bobbing their hair and
[3:04] wearing sexy dresses and things
[3:07] how can you dance in the spirit and call
[3:10] yourself Pentecost and live with such a
[3:12] spirit is that on you
[3:14] how can you man call yourself rulers of
[3:17] your home and permit such
[3:23] I want you to take inventory
[3:27] you know it's the truth
[3:31] and there you are see you're asked to
[3:34] sacrifice you say wait a minute brother
[3:36] Branham I'm an American citizen I'm
[3:39] pentecostalam I belong to the assemblies
[3:42] or the the other groups of water is I
[3:44] have American right for this and being a
[3:46] Christian I have a right because I
[3:49] accept the sacrifice
[3:50] that's what's a matter with America
[3:53] that's where she's in the twist today
[3:55] Every Nation wants a messiah
[3:58] and when God sent Israel a messiah
[4:03] there's all prayed for a messiah
[4:06] in the days of the coming of the Messiah
[4:09] Israel wanted a general that would come
[4:12] out and stop
[4:14] room to another country at the same time
[4:17] Rome wanted a messiah
[4:20] that would come and make him a new a
[4:23] great military regime that would would
[4:25] take Egypt and all the rest of the
[4:27] Nations and sought them out each one
[4:29] wanted a messiah
[4:32] and today we find the same thing
[4:35] uh Europe
[4:38] well for instance Russia they want a
[4:40] messiah that can take him to the Moon
[4:42] before everybody else gets there
[4:45] India's wanting a messiah and they won't
[4:48] want to feed him without working for it
[4:51] America what's that they want an
[4:54] intellectual genius
[4:56] they've got a crooked vote machine to
[4:58] give him one
[5:00] God always lets you have your desires of
[5:03] your heart now you got it what are you
[5:04] gonna do with it
[5:08] when all of them is crying for a messiah
[5:11] God sent him on but one morning General
[5:13] one want to uh an educated machine and
[5:16] also forth but God sent him a baby
[5:21] he sent him a savior he know they needed
[5:25] a savior
[5:26] what a fresh you got their Messiah today
[5:30] what would we do
[5:32] see God knows how to give it
[5:34] what if people of age that's praying for
[5:37] a messiah and we're praying for a great
[5:39] something to happen
[5:41] we are with Pentecostals are praying for
[5:43] a great stuff to happen I wonder what
[5:45] would take place if it really happened
[5:48] and maybe he answers your prayer and you
[5:50] don't know it and you wouldn't receive
[5:52] it if he answered it
[5:54] it wouldn't come in the color that she
[5:56] prayed for
[6:02] that's what they've always done
[6:05] and if they come again it would come in
[6:07] the same color it would come in the same
[6:09] package
[6:12] to roll the top of it
[6:15] therefore God deals with an individual
[6:17] he didn't deal with all Israel there
[6:18] today don't whatever's deal with this
[6:20] Jewish boy see it doesn't come in the
[6:23] way that we want it to come now this Jew
[6:26] had seen something uh it was different
[6:30] That's What attracted his heart
[6:33] there was something that he had he had
[6:36] seen that was in Jesus that other man
[6:38] didn't have
[6:40] he noticed priests and his rabbis didn't
[6:43] have the thing that this that this young
[6:45] fella had called Jesus who the people
[6:48] believed to be a prophet
[6:50] he was a different man
[6:53] that serious Rabbi stand up and the
[6:55] Pharisees argue their idea that there
[6:57] was Angel in spirit and the Sadducees
[7:00] come around and prove there is no angel
[7:02] in spirit and they had their differences
[7:05] caught in between that verse the church
[7:09] is caught today
[7:10] does it take denominational groups does
[7:13] it take a group of man does it take a
[7:15] group of women it takes one person's
[7:18] surrender to God to his work
[7:22] Jesus Christ was God made flesh
[7:25] in order to die that the word he in the
[7:27] word was the same the word could just
[7:29] flow through him there's no doubt at all
[7:31] God's trying to get somebody through the
[7:33] sanctifying power of Christ to yield to
[7:36] that word that he and the word can
[7:37] become one again then he can use his
[7:39] word to that person
[7:42] but you see this this young fellow saw
[7:45] something in this man that was different
[7:46] from other man
[7:48] you know there was different because
[7:51] one time it was asked this man don't
[7:54] speak like ordinary man
[7:56] There's Something About This fellas
[7:58] different
[7:59] never a man speak like this because when
[8:01] he spoke God was there to answer what
[8:04] he's saying
[8:06] as I've said many times this week man is
[8:09] still man they're praising God for what
[8:11] he did looking forward to what he is
[8:13] doing going to do that's us
[8:15] but you're ignoring what he's done
[8:18] always man does that
[8:20] Jesus said you claim to be the the
[8:23] children of the prophets and you're the
[8:24] one put him in the grave
[8:26] and you garnish your tombs
[8:29] see we're thinking what God did the only
[8:31] day of Pentecost and through the early
[8:33] age and then we're saying God's going to
[8:35] come with a great something and the
[8:37] first thing you know Pastor I spine will
[8:38] never know it
[8:40] history always proves itself right and
[8:43] it repeats itself we pass Let It Go
[8:46] Right by and don't notice it now this
[8:48] young man had seen something different
[8:52] he seen that there was a difference in
[8:55] this Jesus
[8:56] he wasn't like ordinary man you've seen
[8:59] what that man could do that God was with
[9:01] him he saw that his life though it was
[9:04] contrary to his own church teaching but
[9:06] he saw that man that God was with him
[9:09] like Peter said enter on the day of
[9:11] Pentecost he said uh I believe it was in
[9:14] Acts the third chapter he said amen of
[9:17] Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man proved of
[9:21] God
[9:22] a lot of Miracles and signs that he did
[9:24] the year with Wicked hands is indicting
[9:27] that generation for rejecting him you're
[9:30] the wicked hands have crucified the
[9:31] Prince of Life
[9:32] now
[9:34] we find out now that
[9:36] we are coming in our age and any Bible
[9:40] teacher knows that the last age of
[9:41] Pentecost is Lady ausia
[9:44] Leo seal means woman
[9:46] and the Greek
[9:50] time that when women take over
[9:52] I've got nothing against women
[9:55] as long as they stay in their place
[9:59] if God could have given a man anything
[10:01] better you better give it to him
[10:03] but when she gets out of the place she's
[10:05] watering his blood
[10:07] Solomon said so he's the wisest we ever
[10:09] had
[10:11] but it it's women in politics
[10:14] didn't 25 years ago the lord gave me a
[10:16] vision showing that the women through
[10:18] permitting the bull were to elect elect
[10:20] this Ricky we got up here now
[10:24] a modern Ahab sitting there with Jezebel
[10:27] turning his neck and you women fashion
[10:29] yourself at the same way she's a model
[10:32] of the world
[10:34] there's a lot of similarity to to Israel
[10:37] you know they come in and Tuck a land
[10:39] and drove out the occupants and set up
[10:41] their own uh system there and and that's
[10:43] the same way America did drove back the
[10:45] Indians and set up our system Israel had
[10:48] a great uh man among them they had like
[10:51] Solomon and David and great warriors we
[10:54] had great men Washington and Lincoln but
[10:57] finally there comes something to the
[10:58] throne that through politics is brought
[11:00] in there and it wasn't a Abby is a
[11:02] pretty good guy himself but that woman
[11:04] behind him
[11:06] you know the Bible speaks that same
[11:07] thing in the last day here and you
[11:10] loving your political you Democrats
[11:12] loving your political stand more than
[11:15] you did your Bible and God and you
[11:17] elected that I'm not a republican I'm a
[11:19] Christian
[11:21] Hallelujah
[11:23] I'm here for one thing
[11:26] talk about selling birth rights we have
[11:29] did it right
[11:30] that's right certainly you have and now
[11:31] you've got it what are you going to do
[11:32] with it you had to do it to fulfill this
[11:34] scripture and the people seen that now
[11:38] notice now the rich Lady of sin Church
[11:42] Jesus reveals in Revelation 3. uh gives
[11:46] this age this lady of seeing Pentecostal
[11:49] age the same opportunity this rich man
[11:52] did
[11:53] the same one caused lay your sin knocked
[11:56] at the door showed that our organized
[11:59] life had put Christ outside because
[12:01] Christ is the word
[12:02] in the beginning was the word and the
[12:04] words with God and the Word was God and
[12:06] the word still God
[12:08] and the Lord was put outside for our
[12:10] organizational system
[12:13] that's why I'm here with these
[12:15] businessmen
[12:17] God help him if they'll never organize
[12:19] but you're not far from it
[12:22] you just remember that I love you and
[12:25] you're giving me a spot this has been a
[12:27] place for my Ministry but I foresee it
[12:29] coming the handwriting's on the wall
[12:33] now don't do that
[12:35] you'll take the same chaos the rest of
[12:37] them did
[12:39] the devil's been trying to kill your
[12:41] leader for a long time if you can get
[12:42] rid of him
[12:43] something will take place it's just man
[12:46] they have to have their own ideas of it
[12:51] you put a charter you're not long ago in
[12:52] your paper
[12:54] should have done that that identifies
[12:55] you as an organization we we're a group
[12:58] of Brethren who don't matter what the
[13:00] man believes we're fellowshipping trying
[13:02] to get him let your light shine they'll
[13:04] see the light
[13:05] Hudson Taylor said not long ago that
[13:08] there was a missionary boy come said and
[13:10] India said Mr Taylor I have just
[13:12] received Christ he said Shaw go down and
[13:15] get my bachelor of Art and so forth and
[13:17] train he said no I'll go testify
[13:20] so I think that's a good idea see we're
[13:23] trying to see if you do your wide
[13:24] yourself right into something you get
[13:26] off out here you get a lot of
[13:27] educational programming it takes God
[13:29] right out of it
[13:31] when you get glamor God don't like
[13:33] glamor Hollywood's full of Glamor
[13:36] Hollywood shines the gospel glows
[13:38] there's a lot of difference between
[13:39] shining and glowing
[13:42] [Applause]
[13:46] Hollywood signs with lights and class
[13:49] and the gospel glows in humility
[13:52] quite a difference see
[13:55] now you remember that my brethren and my
[13:58] sisters don't don't shine glow
[14:03] now we find this young fella given this
[14:06] opportunity to do this and he he turned
[14:10] it away because there was too much of a
[14:12] prize to it
[14:14] and I think that's the same thing today
[14:16] we we don't want to we don't want to
[14:17] admit now we don't want to say that we
[14:20] don't but our lives are proven
[14:23] it's proven it it's exactly right
[14:26] but the the lady you'll see putting out
[14:29] of the church that he was knocking on
[14:31] see trying to get back in and Leo seal
[14:33] putting out because that they they were
[14:37] rich
[14:38] they had need of nothing
[14:40] they were just as uh just as uh rich as
[14:43] they could be and so they said we are
[14:46] rich we have need of nothing and God
[14:49] said you are naked
[14:52] poor miserable blind don't know it
[14:56] that's a trouble when they don't know it
[14:58] if a man's eye on the street in that
[15:00] condition naked and blind well most
[15:03] anyone had a human heart would go to
[15:04] that man say Sir you're naked you're out
[15:07] you're you're exposed and you come on in
[15:10] but if a man turn around said yeah you
[15:12] turn into your own business
[15:13] right now what are you gonna do for that
[15:15] fella and you're one of the church
[15:18] thinks that it's so it's so cold and
[15:20] it's it is and it's self-righteousness
[15:23] I'm telling you you're thinking you've
[15:25] got to bring in the word you say let's
[15:26] contrary to our Creed what are you sold
[15:28] out man
[15:29] your birth rights yes
[15:32] yes one instead of being glamor we ought
[15:35] to be glowing instead of having 500 or
[15:38] 600 of what it is you're at a breakfast
[15:40] that's all right I have nothing against
[15:42] it I I'm just hearing the name of the
[15:44] Lord Jesus
[15:46] instead of that there ought to be a
[15:48] glowing Among Us so the Holy Spirit
[15:50] maybe it's only a dozen glowing in the
[15:54] beauty of the Lord the Lord Jesus to be
[15:57] so up honest until the glory of the Lord
[15:59] would be in US
[16:01] but we want to shine
[16:03] more members see the church has always
[16:06] counted membership God counts character
[16:09] not membership as I said this week
[16:11] elaesar has sweated it up
[16:14] trying to find character
[16:16] and when he found Rebecca then he had an
[16:18] awful time maker stand still until he
[16:20] could get her dressed
[16:23] that's the same thing it is with the
[16:25] church we find the character in the
[16:26] Pentecostal church but to get her
[16:28] dressed and you go to say something
[16:30] about it then everybody rise up we won't
[16:31] have him no more we don't have this
[16:33] thing
[16:35] you find what you got character to work
[16:37] on but then you you can't make them
[16:38] stand still long enough
[16:41] bring him back
[16:43] to where they once fell from you
[16:45] Pentecostal Church come right out of
[16:48] denominationalism that's why God brought
[16:50] you out for
[16:51] was to be his church what did you do you
[16:54] turned right back around went right back
[16:55] in the thing you come out of
[16:58] like a dog to its vomit
[17:01] and it hog to its Waller
[17:04] the people did the same thing and now
[17:06] there's not much difference in you
[17:08] playing oh I hope you don't think that
[17:11] I'm trying to be mean a rude I'm only
[17:15] sent here my days may be few
[17:17] I'm standing in the name of the Lord
[17:19] Jesus to tell you what's the truth
[17:23] you mark my words if they don't come to
[17:25] pass
[17:27] you're trying to shine Stop It Go Now
[17:31] Rich the lady Arceus church has done the
[17:33] same thing that the rich wrong ruler did
[17:36] because the price was too great
[17:39] he just couldn't accept the word of the
[17:42] Lord what for him to do
[17:43] he would rather take his way uh with the
[17:46] glamor of the day because he had plenty
[17:48] of money and he could go out in the
[17:50] societies of of the other people and
[17:52] live up his time well that's about the
[17:55] way we've gotten we could be an
[17:57] organization like the rest of them and
[17:59] Pentecost is not an organization it's an
[18:01] experience we can be this other we're
[18:03] just like the rest of them you get more
[18:05] members but what have you got when he
[18:07] got him
[18:09] see
[18:10] mustn't do that that's wrong what do you
[18:13] do when you're doing the same rational
[18:15] mistake of this young rich man did see
[18:18] yes they put him out because of their
[18:22] love of the world now let us uh
[18:24] investigate uh some of these people uh
[18:28] back there and what they did let's look
[18:30] at the where we're at today
[18:32] I know of someone said not all goes I
[18:36] told you what uh you've been a preacher
[18:38] while you're around them businessman I
[18:39] told him I was a Assurance salesman of
[18:43] eternal life so uh there is and that's
[18:47] what Jesus was tying this young man had
[18:50] seen something any now that was
[18:52] different and he knowed he had eternal
[18:54] life so instead of going to his Rabbi he
[18:56] come to that person that he's seen was
[19:00] exactly God's Vindicated word
[19:04] God in Christ was the same because
[19:06] Christ said it's not me that doeth the
[19:08] works it's my father and as I preached
[19:11] or at the central families or the first
[19:13] family of the night how God's great
[19:15] nature projected Jesus see all the rest
[19:17] of nature was Fallen he couldn't take a
[19:19] profit because he was born to sexual
[19:21] desire
[19:22] and it's a fallen nature but God in his
[19:25] love projected one without
[19:28] sin and therefore this one was so
[19:31] perfect with the father just a body that
[19:33] was your call the son that the word was
[19:36] him John explains it in the first
[19:38] chapter in the beginning was the word
[19:39] the word is with God and the Word was
[19:41] God and the Word was made flesh
[19:44] see uh we now the word of the Lord came
[19:48] to the prophets
[19:50] but Jesus was different from that he was
[19:53] the word
[19:54] the prophet only could say what uh what
[19:58] was put in his mouth to Satan but Jesus
[20:00] was that word at the entire word of God
[20:03] could flow through him without any he
[20:06] could create stop the winds and the ways
[20:09] and what more because it was God
[20:11] always in the word now God's trying to
[20:14] find a church that he can project his
[20:16] word through
[20:18] you see God watches over his word to to
[20:20] to vindicate it and how can he vindicate
[20:23] it when we deny that it's the truth
[20:27] right
[20:28] so these priests with their word though
[20:31] in their own way of thinking they were
[20:33] exactly right Pharisees Sadducees
[20:34] erodians whatever they were
[20:37] it's come to that time again
[20:39] each one in his own thinking they just
[20:41] do what's right like it was the day of
[20:42] judges
[20:44] but there's an ultimate somewhere and
[20:46] that ultimate is God's word
[20:48] because he wants the word now we find
[20:51] that they love these things better than
[20:53] they love God the Bible said they would
[20:56] now we're living in that day now if a
[20:58] prophecy said a certain thing we see it
[21:00] happening then we we got to know where
[21:02] our mistake is we got to know where we
[21:04] got to bypass
[21:07] now the Book of Revelations a third
[21:08] chapter teaches this
[21:10] that we would be in this age and here we
[21:12] are now how about some of those if we
[21:16] had time to stay on this long time but
[21:19] let's hurry to get through cause power
[21:21] to been gone an hour ago but look here
[21:23] this is first of course the word of God
[21:26] now let us examine some of the policy
[21:29] holders of this eternal life and see
[21:31] what it costs them
[21:33] holders of the Eternal Word
[21:36] uh brother Brandon you said Eternal Word
[21:39] yes sir
[21:40] Eternal never did begin
[21:43] Eternal has no end and a word is a
[21:45] thought expressed
[21:48] that was God's thinking before there was
[21:50] a world or Star a moon or anything that
[21:52] was God's thinking what he would do and
[21:55] when he spoke the word it's eternal
[21:57] because he can produce nothing but
[21:59] something Eternal that's the only way we
[22:01] have eternal life is when we get rid of
[22:02] this perverted life and get eternal life
[22:04] that's God Zoe the word right in you and
[22:06] then the word comes right through you
[22:08] and manifests itself and that's what
[22:09] this Rich fellow seen at this Jesus
[22:11] could stand there and he identified the
[22:13] scriptures Jesus said himself if I do
[22:16] not to work for my father then don't
[22:17] believe me
[22:18] search the scriptures free and then you
[22:20] think you have eternal life and there
[22:22] they want to say who I am
[22:24] they're the one testifying me
[22:26] see but they had it so created up like
[22:28] we have today until they couldn't see it
[22:30] now watch Noah
[22:33] was called by the word of God and he
[22:35] took out an investment in God God's Word
[22:39] of Promise
[22:40] he purposed no matter how how bad it
[22:43] looked and how much the rest of the
[22:44] world didn't believe it nor made that
[22:46] investment
[22:47] he invested in God though it was
[22:49] contrary to science
[22:52] we could stay there a long time
[22:54] nor would any more priests on the
[22:56] countdown Sunday afternoon see where
[22:58] we're living all right notice it was
[23:02] contrary to their religious belief it
[23:04] was contrary in the scientific research
[23:06] of that day that there was any rain in
[23:07] the skies it never had rain so therefore
[23:10] he had to take a stand and to make an
[23:14] investment and he did so in the promise
[23:16] of God Satan Tried Him in every way that
[23:18] he could yet he held on to his
[23:20] investment and it paid off at the end
[23:23] time by Saving his life
[23:25] now businessman what better investment
[23:27] could you make in that
[23:29] at the end time where we are and even
[23:31] science itself now comes around is with
[23:33] us and tells us to just try to midnight
[23:36] hours fixing to strike
[23:37] and what goods are big things going to
[23:39] do what goods are great denomination a
[23:41] million more and so forth like this and
[23:43] build them like that when eternal life
[23:44] is waiting out yonder and we have the
[23:46] opportunity and we're invited to receive
[23:49] this Christ
[23:50] uh God could take you and position you
[23:53] in his word in such a place that when
[23:54] you speak the things that that it's
[23:57] foresaw and foretold and so forth could
[23:59] work right through you
[24:00] every time exactly right
[24:03] never fails can't fail well you say I've
[24:05] seen I tried yes I know and you see it
[24:07] fail for his impersonation but when you
[24:09] see something genuine it cannot be of
[24:12] course it's gone
[24:13] and God sets these things for an example
[24:15] that others might see
[24:17] how do you say how does it come but all
[24:19] night fasting that's good all night
[24:22] prayer meeting is still good but
[24:23] obedience to the words where it comes
[24:25] obeying the word
[24:28] amen all right all right it paid off for
[24:31] saving his life let's us investigate
[24:33] another investment that a man by the
[24:36] name of Daniel he knowed he was going to
[24:39] church was going down amongst worldly
[24:41] people so he know that the whole thing
[24:43] would turn that way that's exactly what
[24:45] we see now Pentecost has got on amongst
[24:47] the world
[24:50] singing a brother Glover sitting here
[24:52] um I believe he's with the four square
[24:53] people and um I was talking one day with
[24:56] brother shakaran and uh that a noble
[24:59] person uh brother uh McPherson brother
[25:03] Roth McPherson we were setting in and
[25:05] they were talking I went over to
[25:07] somebody's place that had been
[25:09] associated in some kind of a Latter-Day
[25:11] rain or something and one of the
[25:13] teachers was abraiding me about it why
[25:15] did I come to the temple first and then
[25:18] later on or keep waiting I said well I
[25:20] just remember that the Lutheran was a
[25:22] lot of rain to the Catholic and Wesley
[25:25] was a lot of rain to the Luther
[25:27] and Pentecost was a ladder rain to the
[25:30] Wesley
[25:31] Miss McPherson was a lot of rain to the
[25:33] Pentecost
[25:34] it's all later Rings curing is hungry if
[25:38] they can't find something to eat they'll
[25:39] eat in the garbage can but God will
[25:40] produce the food if they're just ready
[25:42] to take him
[25:43] and Mr McPherson that Noble lady raised
[25:46] up and she said that is true brother
[25:48] Branham she come from a good Pentecostal
[25:49] background she said I said to Roth as
[25:52] long here that our Temple is far got
[25:56] away from that something that Mrs
[25:58] McPherson was telling him about and
[26:00] they've got to making doctors and PhD
[26:02] and lld what is it but a bunch of a
[26:05] million dollars worth of sand and white
[26:07] elephant on their hand what you need is
[26:09] a return back to the principles and the
[26:11] sincerity of the Gospel back to the real
[26:13] Pentecostal things that produces twice
[26:16] in the life of Jesus
[26:18] that's right
