trouble this morning we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus uh sorry for coming in a little bit late and uh but uh we just want to thank the lord for giving us the privilege and opportunity to be here this morning and we agreed to us many that are following the service online this morning and see our dear brother here god bless you thank you for coming to visit with us and if there's any other visitors in the kids we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ we will first start uh by bringing greetings from my brother and sister wesley from illinois sister carol older sister hussman went to be with the lord and so they asked that we pray for the family and sister carrick also needs our prayers she's experiencing a little bit of pain on her back neck her neck or so so she asked that we remember her in our prayer but her brother-in-law over there in south dakota he was a minister a preacher and i think there was something that kind of occurred me now you know when i was talking with brother wesley and he was just you know telling me some of the last moment that he had he was down in his health and on hospice and his wife was taking care of him and and all of that but uh just before he uh slipped out of this world you know being on auspice and everything that is happening to him [Music] he said out to them and uh he said like brother wesley said to me he asked them to bring him melada because he's seeing all his people over there and he want to claim up and go and meet them and then right after that there was such a kind of a sweet atmosphere that came through the room and he went out with that praise the lord amen i think that's that's a beautiful beautiful thing and and for many years to being down there in south dakota and i mean he was preaching to a little group there and his family at home but uh staying faithful to the word of god praise the lord sometimes we try to judge faithfulness by the crowd that we have you know faithfulness by you know the preacher that we have or the people that we are associated with but it's it's god that george is faithfulness because he's the faithful one amen he's the one that uh that uh you know the local us to be faithful because he's the faithful one he counted us worth it because he is the word of one amen and he is the one lord that await our righteousness because he is the righteous one so we just pray that the lord will be able to to comfort them and strengthen the family as as the moon the lost and many families that are mourning they are lost in such a difficult time praise the lord amen i was uh i was kind of carried away by the book of lamentation we've been reading book lamentation at home and i just i was just carried away by uh you know what was happening there with the prophet jeremiah seeing israel going into captivity and what was becoming of the nation what was becoming you know of the daughters of zion you know the the people that was one look at as the princess of the earth was now being ravaged you know when jeremiah talks about the children begging for bread in the street you know in my mind just couldn't get off of that seeing most of the food depots around the united states and cars lining up for food and seeing the homelessness that is coming to this great nation that once stood up in the world and every nation around the world look at america and to look in the news and see people lining up with with cars you know for food food airports and and it's not only shown in in america they're shown around the world you know when and uh uh it shows that uh you know god's word never failed amen heaven and earth will pass away but this word of god will never pass away praise the lord that's that's our anchor that's that's our trust that's the thing that we live for amen is the word of god praise the lord i just just been consumed by that but the most thing about it did is the other that that was that was just that was hitting me in warsaw year is all of these things happening in the land but here is a man a prophet of god that just sit back and when he look at the things happening the only thing he can do is to just weep and we have we have people just being unconcerned you know i mean everybody is just caring for themselves as long as nothing is happening to me i'm healthy and fine you know i get a job i've not lost my job yet and and we just think the whole world is just in our living room just to be able to step out a little bit and think about what are people [Music] in somalia going through what are people in yummy going through hungry children [Music] if you have a thought like that and you buy your head to eat your meal to think that somebody have not got a meal to eat the whole book of jeremiah of lamentation was written from a weeping prophet a man that was just weeping he just looked at little children innocent what have they done to be weary max [Music] kind of for being taught but they tore up with their and sometimes it's hard to get out of there to be able to do anything or look at anything and uh but i'm not preaching on lamentation this morning i'll try natto i mean but that's where my spirit is that's where my heart is that's where my heart is when the world become vulnerable like this then there are people that there that take the advantage of other people and abuse them in different ways but i pray that the lord will just be able to help us this morning and give us grace let's just stand on our feet [Music] let's sing that chorus with the musician a little bit here that's what we come for we come to worship him [Music] lord i give you my heart lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every birth that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your lord i give you my heart oh lord i gave you my heart i give you my soul i live for you all oh every birth that i take every moment on my way [Music] your way [Music] let's take our bibles the lord bless you thank you musicians we may have your seat amen let's take our bibles and and read from the word of the lord and praise the lord second corinthian chapter five second corinthians chapter five we will review versus the ending and then we will go into our subject this morning i pray the lord will be able to give us grace amen ii corinthians chapter five for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved we have a building we have a building of god and house not made with hands in tanner in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we will be on clothes but clothed upon that mortality might be swallow up of life praise the lord now he that have rough us for this same thing is god who also have given unto us the earnest of the spirit wherefore we are always confident nor in death whereas we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seed we just want to take a little subject on this uh i don't know whether it's a little longer but uh there's a few things i want for us to cover if this tabernacle if this every tabernacle be dissolved amen if this every tabernacle be dissolved if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i actually had on my my mind my heart to to speak on the message the end of all flesh so i was standing on on flesh and uh because noah is the one that said that in the days of noah god said to noah the end of all flesh has come so i was looking at that and then i get to looking at the different kind of a flesh that we have so that's what we will be looking at this morning and then if the lord gave us grace we'll look at that thought of the the end of all flesh has come praise the lord but what i was going to go with that taught is that just like the apostle paul says here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved and and uh uh not many people uh you know are thinking on the preparation of leaving this body if i leave this border what am i going to wear what where am i going to you know what is going to we we all our preparation and investment and everything that we are making most of them is for this earthly life amen praise the lord and jesus said let not your heart be troubled believe in god and believe also remain i go and prepare the place for you in my father's house uh many mansion and then paul said if this house amen if this house of this earthly tabernacle be dissolved and jesus says in my father's house i mean imagine i go and prepare the place for you so uh uh that's that's a little bit of there that we want to look at this morning and trusting that the law will be able to help us out speaking on wednesday night i i pretty much a little bit dashed into talking about feel of that and i was not able to back myself up because i that was not what i was talking about so uh i just i just thought i said well okay let's let's look at that a little bit maybe the grace of god would be able to help us but let's go to genesis chapter one genesis chapter 1 we look at the creation of man praise the lord genesis chapter 1 verse 26 let's look at that and and be able to build our case here because there's a beautiful picture that is written there in genesis chapter one and god said let us make man in our image i want for us to look at this a little bit because uh uh a great uh uh dieter teaching and godhead's teaching has been i mean has been driven from the scripture the teaching of the trinity and all of that has come right from the scripture god said let us make man in our image but look at that word image if uh if it is if if the us represent more than one the image supposed to be images if the us represent more than one personality oh am i wrong is it it's i'm am i wrong i'm not looking at it wrong maybe it is me praise the lord but i i just it just caught my attention and i thought that i think it it's worth looking at again and god said let us make man in our image and in our likeness not images not likenesses but one image and one likeness because there is one god praise the lord are we together and let them let's make men but let them supposed to be like him praise the lord he says let us and let them praise the lord well maybe there maybe the translator of the bibles needed to check on their english but i believe god ordained it that way because there's a mystery that is hearing right in the pages of the book and let them have dominion over the fish of the seed and over the files of the earth and over the cattles and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth verse 27 so god created man in his image again in the image of god created he male and female so that's the damn that he was referring to one man but in that man it's a male and a female praise the lord and in the image of god created he him male and female created he them praise the lord and i read the scripture this morning to to to to start the conversation and tell you it was when god made that declaration that's what makes the devil hate you when god make that declaration that let us make man in our image in our likeness it makes the devil hit your very appearance he hits your very appearance he hit he hit the very dead it was announced he was born if you have a he had it in his power he will sweep you right on that maternity bed and squeeze your breath out of your body the devil hit your every existing because there was no creature of god no creature of god that was ever made in the image of god format of father angels were made before man was made in this way because god was not god until there were angels to worship him so he made the angels to worship him and great lucifer and all of his hosts are there and he's the chief injured and he thinks he's in charge and out of the sudden god said let us make man in our image and our likeness he said what is there going to be somebody that's going to be more than me somebody that is going to be more closer to god than me i'm not trying to make you excited i'm trying to make you to realize why you have the trouble you have it's because the devil hit your very existence and if it was not the mercy of god you would not be sitting down here you have been six feet under the earth are we together whenever you read genesis 26 1 26 and 27 forget about the doctrinal part you must ever remember that when god made that declaration that's where my life trouble begins praise the lord psalm chapter eight psalm chapter eight let's read verse one we're gonna do a little bit of two uh bible reading this morning so hold your pen and paper because uh we're going to do some some bible reading and i'm going to run all over the place this morning praise the lord amen young people are we having our meeting this afternoon okay so i don't need to be in a hurry now so uh praise the lord i'll try not to keep you alone if i can if you allow me nato amen psalm chapter 8 verse 1 the scripture says to the chief musician the son of david oh lord our god how excellent is thy name in all the earth who have set thy glory above the heavens first to out of the mouth of babes and suckling have that ordained strength because of thine enemy that thou mighty steal the enemy and their adventure praise the lord verse 3. when i consider the heavens the works of thy fingers the moon and the sky which thou have ordained what is man what is man that thou are mindful of him what is man why you make him in your image and in your likeness what is he caring what what what is man caring all we see is this flesh you know and shh and yeah i bought it and you know and whatever it is but what is man and the son of man that thou visited him praise the lord amen paul got inspired in in hebrew chapter 2 let's look there we'll continue to talk from there hebrew chapter 2 david years talking about the creation of god he says when i consider the heavens and all the things that you have made the works of your fingers and all the things you have made what is man that you are so mindful of him praise the lord paul in hebrew chapter 2 verse 5 we can start reading hebrew chapter 2 verse 5. for unto the angel have he not put in suggestion the word to come whereof he speak he never put his creation in the charge of the angels verse 6 amen but one in a setting place testified speaking about david saying what is men that thou are mindful of him amen and i mean you can just pause there and don't ask the question what is man ask the question lord who am i that you've been so good to me what is about me that you've been so good to me all this man that they were mindful of him or the son of man that they have visited him verse 7 thou make him a little lower than the angels praise the lord that is what we will look into a little bit this morning by the help of the lord that making him a little lower than the angels but yet you crown him with glory and honor and you did set him over the works of that hand adam was make the god the amateur god of the earth to have dominion over the earth and you were made the same praise the lord amen you make him a little lower than the angels the angels have one body the man was made in a lower form lower body that we called we would see in the scripture paul call it the terrestrial body amen but yet he was crying with glory in honor and god has set him to the place to be able to dominate the earth have dominion amen verse 8. that i have put all things in suggestion under his feet for in death he put all in suggestion on him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put on him praise the lord verse 9 but we see jesus who was me a little lower than the angels praise the lord amen he was made a little lower than the angels to redeem you and myself praise the lord amen he was made a little lower than the angels to redeem you and myself praise the lord faithful abraham but bam says when god made the first man in the garden of eden did you notice he made him both male and female he was a man made in god's image a spirit he he uh he put him in flesh that is genesis chapter 2 verse 7 genesis the next chapter after he already made him male and female and and there still was no man to tilt the sword so then he created a man out of the dust of the earth not in his image the first one was in his image genesis uh 1 26 2 7 is in the dust of the earth but then god came down little lower than the angels jesus god came down in a form of man by jesus christ to redeem man that fell from the image from the image of the earth and he was made in the image of the earth oh god can't you see what what gospel means what god when god became man so man became god we are sons and daughters of god so he was made jesus this jesus made a lower little lord than the angel is because god made man in his image and man fell from that image so god has to come in the image of man to redeem us back to the image of god amen that's the place that we are going are we together amen let's continue to read in hebrew there amen are we together praise the lord amen verse nine but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with glory and honor dead but that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him of whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering you can read the rest it will be a blessing to you so we see here that the the thought on our mind right down from genesis 1 that we read what is man what is man what what is man that they all are so mindful what is human let's say that way amen what are we humans what are we humans the only creatures that have a soul amen so as we look at this we realize that there were there were things god made man in his image and we know that that man was a spirit man he was not a flesh man the man of genesis chapter 126 was a spirit man i would say in poor language because we will get there and you realize the man of genesis 1 26 was a celestial body amen now in genesis 2 7 that was where god made the terrestrial body so man man is having in him the the the the mystery of the different bodies that god uses if this athlete tabernacle be dissolved if this terrestrial body there is a cerestral body that's what genesis is showing us there was a cerestral body before a terrestrial body are we together this is not this is this is what what we what we have here what we see here what we are living through is not all about life there is a more glorious amen just like we said wednesday night to go without thinking of fear to go with not one more thought of thinking evil about anybody praise the lord amen when god made man in his image in that celestial body in the image of god the bible said he made man men could not fall in their body there was no sin in their body because there it was a perfect image of god praise the lord but when that body was placed in an ethnic body you see paul talking about the house of our affluent tabernacle be dissolved amen many times we think like uh you know we will we will get rid of this body it's almost like you want to just get out of it and kick it so you fold up so much pain it's not going to be like that it's going to be dissolved it's going to be dissolved oh my god just help us this morning amen i'm trying to tell you a little bit that you better be nice to your body give you some bath good haircut amen because it's going to be the same one you will well just out of brand new state amen [Laughter] praise the lord amen amen i don't want to get my life inspired on me but i'm trusting that the lord is going to help us this morning praise the lord we just have a uh a little more few things here to cover kids ketu spinel uh we want to read that here he says we have three different bodies with wording one is a human body the other is a celestial body the other is a glorified body we have three bodies that we do in first corinthians chapter 15 let's look there together first corinthians chapter 15. let's look there together if we don't get through this we'll make another time to get through it amen and let me just first start reading here from verse 15 i mean from verse one moreover brethren i declared unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also you have received and were in years 10 by which also yeah i save if you keep in memory what i preach unto you unless ye have believed in vain praise the lord amen for i deliver unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scripture and and that he was buried and that he rose again the 10-day i call into the scripture and and that he was seen or see first then of the twelve now that's something i'm i'm trying to get to you here um after that he was seen of about 500 brethren at once now paul is is telling us a little bit here about after jesus jesus uh are resurrected amen he died for our sin and he was buried and he rose again but when he rose again now now you think about this now paul you're talking about he says [Music] what i deliver unto you first all the things that's verse 3 which i also receive and how that christ died for our sin now before he died he lived on this earth amen and and and he healed the sick he raised the dead and and and and and people saw him he was in one kind of a body he was born of a virgin amen he was in a terrestrial body he had a body word he could be hungry he had a body word he went to the grave of lazarus and he wept but he's saying here that when when jesus resurrected see if i saw him first stephen and then the twelve saw him and then after there were about 500 brethren that saw jesus when he resurrected amen praise the lord they saw him when he resurrected are we together now i want you to keep this picture in your mind because we're going to travel through the scriptures a little bit so you can see it see that but yara said when he resurrected he was not in a terrestrial body but yet these 500 brethren could see him are we together now as we travel here he says and a scene of 500 at once of whom the greater path remain unto this present but some has fallen asleep which means some of them are still alive after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also praise the lord and paul also saw him but paul saw him in a different kind of a body so paul him i mean [Laughter] saw paul saw paul saw him amen paul saw him in a different kind of a body a different form paul never knew jesus after the flesh because he never met jesus in the flesh amen that's another subject because that's where we were going to speak on the end of all flesh because you got to go beyond the flesh to really know jesus in this day so he said at last you know i saw him at least of the apostles now so we we we see paul identify few things here some saw him when he was alive some saw him when he resurrected praise the lord are we together and uh i'm a little bit ahead of myself but that's okay let's go to let's go to uh saint john chapter 20. let's go to saint john chapter 20. i'm just going ahead of myself here let's look at verse 1 john chapter 20 verse 1 praise the lord the first day of the week on the line that were first day because it's going to repeat again and i want for you to catch it when it repeats itself the first day of the week cometh merit magdalene elliot uh when it was year back onto the sepulchre and see you have the stone taken away from the supplical amen now i i want you to to watch that the first day of the week praise the lord amen i want you to just keep your eyes on there because it's going to repeat and we're going to see a kind of a sequence here when we go over in the book of luke and and the scripture goes on she run it and and and comment to simon peter and to the other disciples that is that is at the resurrection uh verse three peter therefore when uh went forth the disciples and they came to the supper curve and so they ran both together and then we we see [Music] all of the things that took place there verse six then come as samuel peter following him and uh went into the supreme court and seeing the laney uh cloth lies he says uh the and the napkin which was about his head was lying there and uh are we together now so we see here i'm trying to okay this will go all the way down verse 11 but mary's two without at the circle weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the soccer curve and and see two injuries in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus her lame now the body was not there but she saw two angels in that position okay so it's not that they were standing at his head and his feet the body was not there but they were in that position where the body was laid and uh [Music] and the and they said unto her woman why whipped there she said unto them because they have they have taken away my lord and i know that way they have let him and when she had said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew that that it was jesus jesus said unto her woman why whip it there home seek it down she's she's supposing him to be a gardener said unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where they have let him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary call her by name amen so when he called her by name then there was there was it caught her attention a familiar voice amen she heard a familiar voice so it caught her attention the same voice that said lazarus come forth jesus said unto her mary she turned herself and said unto him rabbonin which is to say master and jesus said unto her touch me net so out of excitement realizing that it was the lord she was springing on him and she said he said touch me not touch me not praise the lord for i am not yet ascended to my father but god to my brethren and said unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god i just love that scripture amen praise the lord amen and mary magdalene came and told the disciples oh my goodness i see this woman running out of breath she's running out of excitement and and scared to death and running praise the lord and she got there are we together and mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the lord and that he has spoken these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day amen this was happening on the same day now you have to realize jesus told her don't touch me amen don't touch me i have to go to the father i got to go and present this sacrifice to the father praise the lord are we together amen do you have your seatbelt on praise the lord glory be to god amen we have to talk about these things if we're talking about the rapture we got to talk about these things because it's not going to be too long we'll be swapping bodies [Laughter] [Music] that is the only future we have as believers that's what we are living for amen that's what we are living for that is the thing that make us fight in our trials when the trials is tough and the devil is trying to make you to give up you looking for a new body you're looking at a future you're looking at a better resurrection so they make you to stick right in there and say lord gave me grace lord be merciful to my failure and give me grace [Music] praise the lord because what is in this word too late for amen now we are wearing max we might start wearing helmets and boots on our feet glory be to god but yet god is promising you a new body are we together amen now watching us as we as we will read this it's just so beautiful it's just so beautiful when you dab in the scripture yeah the bible says the first day of the week the same evening when the doors were shot their disciples assembled themselves together because of what mary was saying when she rushed over to them everybody we were just there we left you there what you what do you mean i said truth and close the door close the door when the doors were shot are we together the doors were shot where the disciples were the sample for fear of the jews came jesus and he stood in the amaze that those were shot mary testifying all of these things to them praise the lord the bible says then jesus steps in now if you take this account and you compare it to luke 24 you will realize before jesus stepped in here he met those other two men on the road of emmaus praise the lord and if you take the time that he resurrected and told mary don't touch me i'm going to the father he went to the father and he came back the same day he met the two men on the road of emails the same day he entered into the room [Music] according to luke account he ate bread and fish the same day he died in one body resurrected in another body and told merit don't touch me because mortar and immortality don't mix in their body he extended in that body and came back in another body that can go through the walls but can still eat bread [Music] and he told thomas come and touch me look at my hand come and touch me it has wounds but it can't bleed the wounds are dead but he's not bleeding put your hand on my side you can see the wound where the juke disappeared or no bleeding oh man my goodness me you know why i came to church late because i just couldn't sleep [Laughter] oh my goodness me he's showing the war the bible says he came down thy evening he showed himself to the disciple when you read luke account over there in luke 24 the bible says every one of them oh my goodness this is the spirit is it the injured of the lord he said he said the lord in the spirit he said no look at my wounds i mean the body come and touch it they were not convinced he said okay your first bread your face food bread and fish praise the lord when he met the man on the road of in myers he says are you a stranger yeah what are you talking about he says oh you guys i told you all this thing the scripture will come to pass law of heart and all of that and debate him to come in it was about supper time he took car he took the bread and he broke it and the bible says in the eyes so open they knew that it was the lord amen and after supper they asked him to stay the bible said he vanished so he's dwelling in a body where he can appear and disappear he's rolling in the border where he can go through the wall and you don't have to get brother jordan to do some work here he can go through the war brother steve you don't need butterfly then how you call it something butterfly to pass the wall are we together but what i want us to appreciate and see here is the terrestrial body their celestial body and the glorified body praise the lord now when when when they got dead and they realized the stone was rolled away they saw the napkin they saw the the saw the cloth and everything that he was wrapping was lying there but his body was not there are we together his body was not there but then when he when he appeared to mary and he called her name and said mary she woke up to the reality she says oh my master she got excited he said no don't touch me amen now for all to to uh uh uh try to rush to embrace him or spring on him or whatever she wanted to do out of excitement not only that she recognized him by calling her name that brought her to recognize him but she could also identify that that was her law because if this person would have said mary and then they turn out to look completely different praise the lord if they turn out to look completely different she will say wait a minute where do you know me from but she recognized his voice and she also recognized his appearance praise the lord now follow me now catch the talk because the body is not in the tomb but here is the body appearing here and she's and he's saying don't touch me amen but she identified that's her law praise the lord this was the same thing that took place on my transfiguration when moses and elijah appeared to peter james and john they were in a body they could be identified but they could not be touched are we together amen praise the lord life story why they know moses they know elijah and moses and peter james and john recognized him and we recognized jesus after he returned back in his glorified body amen the bible says it does not yet appear what we shall be but we will have a body like his body for we shall see him as he is praise the lord so we will have one like that and he was eating and so forth that's in a glorified body pizza amen praise the lord don't don't don't worry if you have questions just line them up amen if you have questions just line them up send them to the dickens we will go through it amen praise the lord glory be to god so we realize here we have we have uh uh three bodies there there there are three bodies uh you know in the scripture the bible talks about paul talks about it there let's let's look there in in uh in corinthian i kind of slip up a little bit here and let's just read that from the scripture here and kind of a back it up with the word of god are we together amen or should we just stop here amen well i don't know what you were expecting to hear this morning praise the lord amen i don't know what you were expecting to hear this morning but i come to bring you the word of the lord amen i come to bring you the word of the lord i want to i just want to cut the reading down here because we could read and and read on and read on but read first corinthians chapter 15 when you get home let's drop down here to verse 35 but some men will say how are the dead raise up and with what body do they come how is the dead raised and what body do they come are we together the mystery of the body has always been the question the mystery of the body has been the argument between the pharisees and the sadducees that's what the sadducees did not believe in resurrection is it is because of this question praise the lord if this is a corruptible body if this is a corruptible body and we know all the things that this body goes through the lies that it tells the lies they believe the lies it feels and and everything and david says insane my mother conceived me coming to the world speaking lies and everything that this body goes through do you see why sometimes we have the idea that i can't wait to get out of this body praise the lord amen and sometimes i'm i mean you you you go through things until you just feel like giving yourself a slop how can i be foolish you just tell yourself when when will you ever learn saints when will you be smart oh my goodness i can't even believe i'm doing this jesus have mercy i remember when i first came to the lord i used to hit the brick wall i get so mad until i hit the brick wall because the question has always been what body if there is a resurrection what body will we be in now let's follow this a little bit here the beautiful reading here by the apostle paul he says thou food yes i am one i don't know what about you thou food that witch thou sow it is not quicking except it dies saint john chapter 12. that's what jesus said a separate corner we fall to the ground and die it do not come up so paul is quoting the same thing on an inspiration thou food that which is soul is not quick in except it died that and that which thou saweth thou saw with net their body that shall be but dead green it may it made chains of wheat all of some other green but god gave it it a body as it have pleased him and to ever see his own body let's take this literally brother wesley is not here but he could have been the one to better explain this to us and uh uh if you if you take a seed and and you put it in the ground the seed is in your hand is that the the life is covered by a shell it's in that seed you have it it has a body okay the sea has a body i was just telling someone and talking about the seed is not held with the shark and and and what and and and and some of the the you know the the the errors that we made through through the through the years you know what because that seed that you put to the ground according to what paul says the scripture and according to nature that she has to die amen a diet a dramatized in the earth it brings forth a little plant and that plant transports the life of that seed in all the stages that's exactly what brother branham taught us in uh uh the seed is not here with the shark that every stage was a transportation of the sea that's the reason why from every age god has an elect people he has a bride because those people were part of the transportation of the seed of the life the life was transporting through the pollen through the stem through the shark all of those stages the life was going trying to get back to the original sea now that sea dies and rotting in the earth but when the plane comes up and puffed forth another sea it looks exactly like the sea that goes to the ground that's why you don't you don't uh plain corn and get okra i mean we plain corn and then we get corn praise the lord so yeah for the same year to us every seed has a body he says all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of a flesh of man another kind of beast that's why we don't eat humans because human flesh is flesh but it's not an eatable flesh amen and another flesh you know a fish that's when you i mean sometimes you fried and they taste sweet you know another flesh of burst turkey there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the skies and once ties different from another side in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in this honor praise the lord things we struggle with things we did that we regret off it goes in the ground with that but when it comes up amen it is sown in this honor it is sown it raised in glory sown in weakness and it raises in power are we together it is so a natural body ray is a spiritual body there is a natural body there is a spiritual body then he talks about you know uh uh you know the first the first adam and uh and quaking in spirit year praise the lord amen are we together now so when we look at this when we look at this i would i would just try to to kind of slide off yet a little bit and to be able to get your attention we will we'll get back to that so we we we realized here right from genesis one what is man that's that's my question what what what i am who i am that god has been so good to me amen that's that's the thought that is on our mind and as we traveling here to see that god made man in his image in his and his likeness and then he came and made man out of the dust of the earth genesis 2 7 and he breathed into the nostril of man and man became a living soul and show us two different beings there so we travel alone and we kind of are looking at all of this but we realize also the scripture allowed us to see here that paul in the bible the apostle paul he talks about something i want to i'm going to get away a little bit here praise the lord amen and and what i want to look at here is the other paul talks about something over in the book of second corinthians 12. and what he talks about here he talks about being caught up in the tear heavens this whole thing about soul body and spirit the whole thing about father son and the holy ghost was what god expressed in genesis 1 26 when he used that word let us praise the lord the hebrews they called that a priority of god it does not make him three distinct person but it makes him one person with attributes one person with many attributes and many ability praise the lord but all of these attributes that god have he choose to to to kind of manifest them or or classify them in a sense of showing it through a fatherhood a son shape and a holy ghost manifestation in a way he displayed them in in a dispensational form a father dispensation a sun dispensation and a dispensation of the holy ghost which is the same god praise the lord amen is there father son in the holy ghost yes there is it's truth it's their soul body and spirit yes we have it we have a soul body and spirit this is our this is my body you know and and and uh uh uh i have a sword and a spirit and all of that so so you will see how it runs through the scripture paul here talking in corinthians chapter 12 verse 2 i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or without the body i cannot tell god know it such and one caught up to the third heavens so yeah paul talking about a tear heavens now if he talks about it tear heaven the question comes to us is that a first yes there is is that a second yes there is praise the lord because if there is a ted there should be a first there should be a second and there should be a tear are we together praise the lord and now so all of this will help you to realize paul in ephesians chapter 1 he says yet blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus who have put us in heavenly places in christ jesus he's identifying the believer's position praise the lord which of course is in the first heavens amen that is the first heaven but i will show to you here as we as we go together praise the lord are we together am i am i beginning to make you bold praise the lord amen i mean there are things we want to look at here revelation chapter 4 let's just look at that john in revelation chapter 4 the scripture says year look at revelation chapter four as a scripture that i have in revelation chapter four as a quote up there that i want for us to also read through and this will this will this will help us are we together you know what i mean that sometimes we get so talking about things on earth you know and and i mean pulpits fill with with everything that is going on in politics and who win and woo cheating and all of that you know all of those things is for this earth you know it's for this earth i was going to preach a message called choose your rotten apples because brother branham says politics is rotting so whichever one you choose is your rotting apple praise the lord you know so i mean those things we are here should we be concerned about it yes the best way you can be concerned about it is to pray about it [Music] is to just pray about it is is not to get yourself working out and tweeting and posting and getting in all the debates because you cannot change it it's driven by prophecy prophecy is driving what is [Music] happening and we will take our time and come to church and just spend hours and be talking about the politicians and be talking about you know what i said in georgia you know what it said in california you know what he's saying instead of doing that i would rather preach the book of lamentation and be able to identify what we are going through in the book of lamentations i can show you verse by verse and tell you your position is to be a weeping scene to be one that is crying and say oh god is this word is this is it the kind of a word my children would grow in well sorry i'm not a politician so i can help you with anything on politics this morning amen revelation chapter 4 the bible says and after this i look and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a voice as it were a trumpet talking with me we said come up heather now that word come up hither we know it means to be cut away i mean come up higher is a word that means to be cut away just like elijah was taken by the cherub he was taken up higher now so you will see that just as there were three heavens listening to this god also allowed three men to visit those three regions let's read a little bit here praise the lord john said immediately that i was in the spirit i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne john left the earth now christ had left the earth in the form of the holy spirit and had returned back into about it again today the body sits there as a memorial as a sacrifice we get into that a little bit down here we will see now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work here which is revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3 shows the end of the church ages so immediately after john has seen the end of the church ages he was raptured amen he was caught up caught up in the spirit now watch and see you now and uh uh uh so in the end of the age i will show you what's going to be year after after the church ages he said john i can't talk to you down here year normal because i have left there amen i have come up higher come up here with me amen and i will show you what's going to take place year after all mine caught up in a vision caught up into glory his experience must must have been something like that of paul in second corinthians 2 second origin 12 2-4 if if you are putting it down paul was caught up one day and uh he was caught up in a vision too did you know that and he saw things that wasn't expedient for him so even talk about 14 days he was caught up into death never even mention it but listen at the difference between them what paul saw he was forbidding to speak of it or to tell it out to the public oh my i i don't believe he could do it why a little trip i took one day i have never got over it and will and never will he saw things that he couldn't he couldn't talk about i guess he didn't have words too he was caught up in the dead heavens though up in the tear heavens how different when john was caught up and and he seen jesus said write it in a book what you have seen and give it back send it back to the churches paul was forbidden to speak and john was even asked to put it in the book so that it could go all down through the edges so now what what are we picking up here talking about the tear heavens the second heaven and the first heaven the lord amen it's right and it's right in your bible now so we see here that uh uh when you when when you talk about that it's almost like you get over to revelation chapter 20 and you talk about the first death and the second death praise the lord just like we have two births we have our first birth and we have our second birth is that not what the scripture says jesus saint john chapter 3 you must be born again praise the lord john said there in in saint john that we are born of the seed incorruptible which is the word of god so we have a first birth and we have our second birth our first birth is by our natural parents that brought us over to the earth praise the lord the new birth comes by the word of god amen now we cannot talk about a celestial body a terrestrial body a glorified body and we don't talk about birth and death because to go from one body to another body there is an agent called death that you have to travel through that's why the scriptures show us there with our lord jesus there is an anger there is an agent there is a chanter praise the lord and that is that's what happened when we go from one birth to another birth i mean the new verb is not church membership the new verb is not church identification the new verb comes just like paul said when the sea is put into the ground they have to die for it to come for it to have a new birth for it to be quaking it has to die praise the lord and you know that's what this puppet is set here for see the pulpit with a little cross before it it is your stomp stone for your new birth this puppet is your tombstone for your new birth judgment begin in the house of god that's what the scripture says that's why the word of god is preached for to bring you a new birth to pull your spirit to this altar to pull those nature of loss and anger and things that are all that was given to us by our first birth to bring them right to this altar and bury them that's why the blue pit is fall praise the lord amen glory be to god i mean we can talk about all of these changes of the body and having large cuts i can line up to you and just get you excited but the way there is a way by birth and death revelation chapter 20 let's read that quickly we'll be able to identify our first death and second death first resurrection and second resurrection are we together you want to enjoy a new body without death even our lord jesus for him to step in as a celestial body and tell mary don't touch me he went by the way of death then you want a heavenly body call a teal funny body without death revelation chapter 20 verse and i saw thrones and they they sat upon them and judgment was given to them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus christ and for the word of god and wish her now worship the beast neither his image and have not received his mark upon their forehead all on their hands and and and delayed and reigned with christ a thousand years the millennium and the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is their first resurrection praise the lord this is their first resurrection blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no power the second death has no power what is the scripture saying peter said judgment begin in the house of god if the righteous will be scarcely saved where were they unguarded and sinners appear so which means we taste our first death by the word of god we tease our first death by the experience of the baptising of the holy ghost by the fire of god that comes and consumes sin in the light burned acceptance of jealousy and anger from the heart of the believer [Applause] we experience our first death right here when we give our heart not in part when we give our heart not in part not just to become a church member but to be a son of god to be a daughter of god when we give our heart completely then you experience your first death which is your second birth your first death is your second birth [Music] praise the lord amen and that's what the church needs that's what the believers need for the hour that we are living in that's what paul meant when he said make your call and election show he said make sure that you have died brother make sure that you have died and born again that's what he meant praise the lord are we together blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no power but they shall be priests of our god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years praise the lord so we have a first birth a first death a first resurrection praise the lord i could be a little bit extreme with that but i will leave you for now praise the lord because paul said they're talking about the new birth in in the book of ephesians he said we were once we were once sinners dead in sin but he have quickened us he has quickened us wish there were one deadly sin he have quickness by grace are we saved in christ jesus that's what he said in the book of ephesians so young people i want you to grab this this is your body your your your bible school or your sunday school for you to grab it and remember it we have a first birth a first death the first resurrection and there is a second birth there is a second death there is a second resurrection we can get into the the equation of it amen praise the lord we come into the world we all here were born by parents we all here experience the first birth the evidence that you experience the first birth you are looking at me i'm talking to you amen we all experience the first birth we were born by our parents praise the lord amen and for us for us to experience the first resurrection we must go by the way of the second death praise the lord we must go by the way no of the second birth not second death we must go by the way of the second birth which is to be born again praise the lord that's what i wanted to get to with with all of these things this morning i realized that i'm far past my time now i have to look for the place to close here amen but that's what i want to get your attention because as we look through this and see the amazing thing that the scripture tells us that if this ethnic tabernacle be dissolved you know paul actually did not use the word be distraught but be dissolved is because the same way god changed his max amen that's the same way he used us like brother branham talks about the future home amen he says heaven and earth will pass away there be a fire that comes down and consume the elements of the earth but it's going to be the same earth that god is going to renovate so it's going to be this same body that god is going to renovate it's a changing of the body is one body sucking the other one so it was not in a form like jesus was lying in the grave and mirror magdalene saw him outside no his body was not there but he have took on another body that she could not touch but yeah he came down in another body that he could eat and they could touch him have scars on him but can't believe he didn't say thomas come come come and see see my take time now take time don't don't don't do it hi because it will pay me take time you see it says no come and put your hand in it because that body can't feed pain praise floyd praise the lord it's the joy that you have serving god in this body the joy that the saints the martials of the ages had been fed to the lion they were feared to the lion and the lion ravaged their body before that lion could touch them they stepped into another body and they saw that body being ravaged but you would come down and pick up that body again you would come down and pick up that body but bam say even if it's just a spoonful of dust that is left of your body you'll come back and speak to it and say scotty come up and you just step right in it my goodness if this athlete tabernacle be dissolved we have another one there is a mystery there in the manifestation of this body i'll leave it for another time but uh uh yeah our time is up here so i wanted to run you through uh the first day of second death and first birth second birth and also get down to uh we get down to the region of the lust where we talk talk about just like we talked about the the the first heaven and the seventh the the second heaven wonder pull out here from uh from peter we'll find time to talk about that also and and and shows the reason why brother branham couldn't preach about hell recently that i was reading the book of isaiah and and there was something that came out in the scripture you know how the reason why the subject of hell has been uh you know such not a confusion is because the the the the stripes the one that wrote the bible the word that it took held from hades you know in in in in in in the asian day it meant something there are two words there there is hades that means the grave and and and sean and uh which of course this word also came from a place where they used to go uh and and and burn the bodies you know and and and give bodies to idols and burn and all of that so we will look into that if the lord gave us grace we'll take time and look into it but this is all in a place to bring us to the place to give us an idea why god take a special interest in you amen because you have a living soul that living soul move from one body to another that's the only thing you carry all the things the cells and then and the elements we get from our parents they stay with this body god breath into man and he became a living soul what is man that thou are so mindful of him why because that breath that he breathed into man was a part of himself that he did not give to the angels he never gave it to the birds he didn't give it to the animals but he gave it to his son a part of himself and to know that every day we carry a part of god in us as we go to work as we go to school another time when someone make you angry think about the part of god that is in you before you respond back to them think about the part of god that you are caring when god draws that part of himself to himself you'll be a dead body they will call the ambulance you will be called as ice what is man that thou i'm mindful of him sometimes we fill our mind with our achievement we look at how all the things that we have acquired and the things and we just think that's what make us what we are but i'm telling you this morning there are many people that are better than you that are lying down looking at the ceiling they don't have the strength to move their hands with all the degrees they have they cannot pronounce a word but you have the grace of god this morning amen listen to our feet who am i lord who i am yeah who i am who i [Music] am [Music] i can see now [Music] a part of his word oh a so revelation of who i am who i am i can't see now oh i am a part of my savior [Music] a revelation of let's try that one more time i am [Music] [Music] my [Music] a revelation of [Music] that day he set me free and make my heart his buried troll my life is no longer mine i'm a praising out of love divine and now i live to praise [Music] oh [Music] i i'm a part of this world it's a revelation [Music] to redeem his laws bride the king of cake became my savior with mystery of love has pressed to me thy christ and [Music] my [Music] i can see now [Music] oh [Music] one more time [Music] i can see now oh [Music] a part of his a word [Music] so thank you jesus thank you father thank you precious lord thank you lord thank you jesus heavenly father we just want to be grateful to you lord that we can be able to look in the pages of your word we can be able to look in the mirror of your word father to be able to see your likeness to be see to be able to see one that is made in your image lord father how long this word and god all of its signs and everything law that it gives try to change our identity father lord he tried to give us a nationality he tried to give us a tribe he tried to give us lord oh god something that is completely different from you but father we are so glad that lord you have called us lord just like you call mary by name just like you call lazarus by name and lord father and to help us to be able to recognize your voice to realize of god lord we are now what the world says we are we are now water godfather that is titles of men since we are fathers they call us middle class they call us fanatics they call us uh uh well different names lord they try to put name tags on us but god we can look in your word this morning and realize that we are sons and daughters of god we can look in your word this morning father and realize that god we have a heavenly father we have a kingdom above we have a word to come oh jesus i pray father lord most especially father our young people to god law that is growing in the world of technology father god lord and and and we can feed our minds with all the names of the movie styles and the different things on the in the internet lord and yet oh god father that would just help us to lost our identity father i pray to god that we all will realize lord just like our natural birth was important for us to be here the second birth is also
