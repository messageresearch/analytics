[0:00] [Music]
[0:20] many people do that same thing they
[0:22] thinking that he's with
[0:24] them now I want to place this little
[0:27] light to you to show you how infallible
[0:29] the word of God is we all here this
[0:31] afternoon who are Christians believe
[0:33] that Jesus Christ was God's word
[0:35] manifested we believe he was virgin born
[0:38] he was a Tabernacle in which almighty
[0:40] God tabernacled in here on Earth not
[0:42] just a prophet not just an ordinary man
[0:44] but God himself manifested in the form
[0:48] of a man he was Emmanuel God With Us we
[0:51] believe that with all of our heart and
[0:54] now notice when Martha or Mary rather
[0:58] and Joseph
[1:00] thinking Jesus was with them they were
[1:03] just perceiving he was with them
[1:05] thinking it just must be all right he's
[1:07] bound to be with us but they were sadly
[1:09] mistaken he wasn't so many good people's
[1:12] like that today they think they see the
[1:15] hour approaching they know something's
[1:17] fixing to happen What do they do they go
[1:19] join Church thinking he's with them they
[1:23] shake hands with the preacher thinking
[1:25] that's all they had to do he's with them
[1:27] confirmed or baptized a certain way way
[1:30] that's all they have to do thinking
[1:32] Jesus is with them brother sister just
[1:35] like Mary and Joseph of old real sincere
[1:38] people yet they are mistaken your life
[1:42] proves whether Jesus is with you or not
[1:44] your life shows where he's occupied here
[1:46] or where he still in his Heavens or on
[1:48] whatever you are the works that I do
[1:50] shall you do also how could you have
[1:52] Christ in you and then the very spirit
[1:53] in you deny his word take up a Creed
[1:55] instead it can't do it he would defeat
[1:59] himself by his own word amen just
[2:01] because somebody put a wrong
[2:03] interpretation to it you got a Bible you
[2:05] can read like anybody else be sincere
[2:08] David said put him always before your
[2:10] face know that when we're meeting this
[2:12] New Year we're meeting it in the power
[2:14] of the resurrection of Christ he's
[2:16] always before me I shall not be
[2:18] moved notice how infallible the word is
[2:21] Mary and Joseph now of you my dear
[2:24] Catholic friends that said Mary was the
[2:25] mother of God Mary wasn't even the
[2:28] mother of Jesus let alone Be Mother of
[2:30] God how could she be amen not one time
[2:32] did he ever address her as mother that's
[2:34] right not at all that's right they come
[2:36] to him one time and said your mother and
[2:38] brothers wait outside he looked on his
[2:40] congregation said who is my mother who
[2:42] is my brother looked to his disciples
[2:44] said the ones that does the will of my
[2:45] father that's same as my
[2:47] mother on the cross when he was dying he
[2:51] also spoke the same thing he said to
[2:53] John John he this man son behold your
[2:57] mother not mother behold th son woman
[2:59] woman behold your son amen not she was
[3:03] no mother of God she was just a barred
[3:05] wom that God used no more than any other
[3:08] woman that God take an ocean to use he
[3:10] might use your the womb of your heart to
[3:12] declare his son if if you just let him
[3:14] do it see not no mother of God it had to
[3:18] be a sensation even be a seed of Mary it
[3:20] wasn't even a seed from Mary it was the
[3:21] whole thing was God the Creator if the
[3:24] first Adam back there was created
[3:25] without father and mother the second
[3:27] Adam was the same man anything less than
[3:29] that wouldn't put equal with
[3:32] him the same God created a body that he
[3:36] himself dwelt in how we find look how
[3:39] look if Mary was the mother of God how
[3:40] she slipped up there she said thy father
[3:44] and I have sought thee with
[3:46] tears denying the Virgin birth thy
[3:50] father Joseph and I have sought thee
[3:52] what's that 12 year old boy 12year old
[3:56] child saying don't you know that I must
[3:59] be about my father's business debating
[4:01] with them denominations up
[4:03] there not if he was with about Joseph
[4:06] business he' been down the carpenter
[4:07] shop Joseph wasn't his father God was
[4:10] his
[4:11] father don't you know ought to be about
[4:13] my father's business up there 12 years
[4:16] old with them learned priest not a day
[4:18] in school but yet they were astonished
[4:20] at the wisdom look at the he was the
[4:23] word when he was born he was the word
[4:26] he's still the word
[4:30] notice the word will not take
[4:33] counterfeit she said thy father and I
[4:35] have sought thee with tears said don't
[4:37] you know that I must be about my
[4:38] father's
[4:39] business rebuked his own mother while he
[4:43] was a word there would be a question in
[4:45] somebody's mind if Mary here who once
[4:47] said the Holy Ghost overshadowed and
[4:49] brought forth the son and then here
[4:51] calling Joseph the Father the word's
[4:53] infallible amen it can't fail you know
[4:56] not that I ought to be about my father's
[4:58] business and he was about the father's
[5:01] business not not Joseph business making
[5:03] doors and and Carpenter things he was
[5:06] about his father's business
[5:07] straightening out the religious politics
[5:09] he had in that day know you not that I
[5:11] must be about my father's
[5:13] business yes you're many people today
[5:16] and a lot of These Fine churches are
[5:18] going into that counselor church not
[5:20] going in they're already there amen
[5:22] they're perceiving it that's just
[5:24] exactly the thing to
[5:26] do friendly nice why can't we all come
[5:29] together
[5:30] while they've been trying all for years
[5:31] to make all Methodist Baptist and all
[5:33] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals just
[5:35] Tred to make all of them Pentecostals
[5:37] you can't do that but a counsel is the
[5:39] answer for you that's the answer what
[5:41] the Bible says they will do yes and
[5:44] that's just exactly what they've done
[5:46] friendly churches yes sir a get together
[5:49] fine let's have Fellowship Bible said
[5:51] how can two walk together L they be
[5:53] agreed some of them deny the Virgin
[5:56] birth 80% of the Protestant churches
[5:57] deny the Virgin birth
[6:00] amen and they deny the baptism of the
[6:02] Holy Ghost they deny the signs of his
[6:04] coming the resurrection power they
[6:07] denied he's the same yesterday and
[6:09] forever how can you when God put all
[6:12] this chaos in the world because a woman
[6:15] one day doubted one little phase of his
[6:18] word Satan told her the truth all the
[6:21] one
[6:21] thing but that was the thing that caused
[6:24] all the trouble now all this heartache
[6:26] and sadnesses you had to look at because
[6:29] one little phase of it was doubt you
[6:32] think one little phase of Doubt will
[6:34] ever take us
[6:35] in that's the reason Jesus is coming for
[6:38] a Chase virgin pure fill with the Holy
[6:41] Ghost
[6:43] hallelu not of the world but oh the
[6:46] power of
[6:48] God oh how wonderful to know that there
[6:51] is a possibility to get into this group
[6:55] how do you do it you'll never do it by
[6:57] joining an organization you'll do when
[7:00] you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into
[7:02] the mystical body of Jesus Christ raised
[7:04] with him in Resurrection free from death
[7:07] and
[7:08] sin that's the only way
[7:10] Darkness great denominations a great
[7:13] group of men gets together and set their
[7:14] ideas about it that throws you right
[7:16] back into a Twist like it was at the
[7:18] beginning no hopes at all in that case
[7:20] you're simply gone and all of the seem
[7:23] to be so uh stirred up about this
[7:26] brandly churches think that God will be
[7:28] with them run the millenniums go to
[7:30] start when the council all gets together
[7:32] up there and all the economical moves
[7:34] and so forth and they join in what are
[7:36] they doing making an image into the
[7:38] Beast a power that we all the
[7:41] undenominational and so forth that won't
[7:43] join him with them will be shut out I
[7:45] just watch and see if that
[7:47] happens I've got it wrote down here the
[7:49] very day we the Lord let me see that
[7:52] 1933 and here it is just exactly where
[7:54] it where it said just coming the same
[7:57] way how the pope would leave Rome and so
[7:59] forth
[8:00] now they are good people but mistaken
[8:03] Joseph and Mary was fine people but real
[8:07] mistaken but what was it God used a
[8:09] 12year old boy to show that that word
[8:12] has to stay pure exactly what it was
[8:15] what it sent the first place he was
[8:17] virgin born and that's what he
[8:19] was thinking he was with them when they
[8:22] joined the churches and ser for but it
[8:24] wasn't now but to the elected now that's
[8:28] a Darkness I can stay on that for
[8:30] another hour but to the elected precious
[8:34] and called saints of God I say to you
[8:37] this coming year Shalom God's
[8:41] peace the our is here if I could have
[8:44] been back there before the days that the
[8:47] world was created and looked down and
[8:48] seen the whole thing and the father had
[8:50] said to me what day would you want to
[8:51] live I'd say now right now amen this is
[8:54] the hour this is the greatest hour that
[8:57] the church has ever moved into just
[9:00] before the coming of the bridegroom all
[9:02] the real Church of the Living God ought
[9:04] to be on fire burning with the light of
[9:06] the Gospel being Vindicated among them
[9:08] Rise and Shine for the lights come to
[9:10] you the light of this day Isaiah was the
[9:13] light of his day Noah was the light of
[9:16] his day why he had the word
[9:19] manifested and the gospel the Bible
[9:22] words for this day is the light of the
[9:25] day amen what a glorious time that we're
[9:28] living now
[9:30] good morning peace darkness is gathered
[9:32] what's it gathering for to show the
[9:34] light Isaiah 16:1 Rise and Shine for the
[9:38] light has come to you that's the reason
[9:41] I say
[9:42] shalom the light has come to you God's
[9:46] peace to the elected woman to the
[9:49] elected lady those who got before the
[9:53] foundation world called out and ordain
[9:55] to that the rest of will never see it
[9:59] never know nothing about it the Bible
[10:01] said so Jesus said no man will come to
[10:04] me except my father draws him first and
[10:06] all the father has given me will come
[10:09] amen that's there stood Judas light
[10:12] shining up here but back in his heart
[10:14] was dark seed when The Showdown come the
[10:16] darkness showed here was little old
[10:18] woman all blacked out up here in front
[10:20] but down here was a predestinated seed
[10:23] and when the light come it scattered the
[10:24] darkness and showed forth amen we know
[10:27] messiah's coming in when he does he'll
[10:30] show us these things Jesus said I am
[10:33] he but Judas doubted it yet supposed be
[10:37] walking in the light see the light up
[10:39] here doesn't matter it's the light down
[10:41] here that counts the light up here A
[10:44] Walk in fellowship and everything else
[10:45] but when the real power of God comes in
[10:47] it can't come back to this dead seed
[10:50] it'll reflect off in the denomination
[10:52] but when it's back down here a genuine
[10:54] predestinated seed when that light comes
[10:56] down here shows all the darkness away
[10:58] from you and put you in fellowship with
[11:00] Christ he was the one who gave you the
[11:02] life before the foundation of the world
[11:05] otherwise you'll never see it but God
[11:08] said now to you predestinated seed
[11:11] Shalom amen God's peace rested up you
[11:15] because we're near the end now we're
[11:17] right down near the end we're going to
[11:18] talk about that group for a while Shalom
[11:22] God's light has come the word light is
[11:24] Vindicated again so that you can see the
[11:27] manifestations of the promise of God God
[11:29] for this
[11:31] day search the scriptures in them you
[11:35] think you have eternal life they testify
[11:37] of the day that we're living
[11:39] in what is the light of the day what did
[11:42] the Bible promise for this day see what
[11:45] hour it is no wonder had Jesus rebuked
[11:47] him for not believing John he was the
[11:49] light because the prophet said he would
[11:51] come and there he was the manifested
[11:53] light they didn't see it they didn't
[11:55] understand it they thought it was the
[11:57] Messiah and they thought something else
[11:59] and this and other they fail to see it
[12:02] Jesus come on two lights can't shine the
[12:04] same time there can't be a church light
[12:07] and God's light shine at the same time
[12:10] it's got to be God's light puts out the
[12:12] church light that's exactly what's
[12:14] taking place
[12:15] today God separating churchism from his
[12:20] life of the promised word of this hour
[12:22] that we're living in that's the truth
[12:25] pray you might not want to believe that
[12:27] but you just wait and find out if it's
[12:28] so or not don't wait you better get in
[12:30] right now while there is a chance to get
[12:32] in the word is light when it's
[12:35] Vindicated until the word a promised for
[12:38] the day is a Vindicated then it is not
[12:42] light it cannot be if God said let there
[12:44] be light no sun come into existence
[12:47] there's no sign of light but when God
[12:49] said let there be light and there was
[12:50] light when God promised the messiah
[12:53] messiah come and his word was fulfilled
[12:54] and he was the light of the hour when he
[12:57] promised Noah and he promised the others
[12:58] and all there was a light of the hour
[13:01] and there's a light of the hour today
[13:03] that's Jesus Christ in the power of his
[13:05] resurrection his word that's promised
[13:07] for this day The Works that I do shall
[13:09] you also greater than this will you do
[13:11] for I go to the father Greater Works
[13:14] amen greater things than he did you
[13:16] believe
[13:16] it I believe it it seems humbled it
[13:20] seems like it goes over the top of
[13:22] people's head look when he was here on
[13:24] Earth how could you do Greater Works
[13:26] I've translated that many times more but
[13:29] the same thing greater he said in St
[13:32] John 14:12 Greater Works than this shall
[13:34] you do did you notice when he went to
[13:37] make water into wine he took water first
[13:39] the already created substance and turn
[13:41] it into wine when he fed 5,000 people he
[13:45] took a fish that once swam in the water
[13:47] broke it handed out and multiplied
[13:49] creation he took bread that was once
[13:52] sweet baked into bread broke it hung it
[13:54] out to the handed out to the people and
[13:56] it returned back again multiplied
[13:59] creation but in the last days why there
[14:03] is no sign of creation he speaks it into
[14:06] creation anyhow show if you the same God
[14:09] that was in the beginning he can create
[14:11] squirrels he can create whatever he
[14:12] wants to because he's God greater things
[14:16] than this will you do for I go to my
[14:17] father the word's infallible it has to
[14:21] be manifested it has to be
[14:24] fulfilled greater than this shall you do
[14:26] not multiplying by speaking out into cre
[14:30] creation notice at the word now when he
[14:33] promised what where we at then what day
[14:36] are we living in what is the hour the
[14:38] manifesting of the word of God like it
[14:40] is in all hours you got the message on
[14:42] the seven Church ages watch exactly how
[14:45] each one of those beasts that went out
[14:47] and the beasts that followed him watch
[14:48] exactly if it didn't hit down to the
[14:50] reformers age and every age just exactly
[14:52] the way it was supposed to be exactly
[14:54] what the word said and so will the Holy
[14:57] Spirit manifested they just exactly what
[15:00] the Bible said it would be we see the
[15:02] shadowing in the heavens and on Earth
[15:04] and all the things and the counsels and
[15:05] things getting ready and we see in the
[15:07] midst of all of that the Glorious Gospel
[15:09] of Jesus Christ promised for this
[15:13] day manifesting itself we're living in a
[15:17] wonderful time Shalom to you who have
[15:21] word down in your heart chose before the
[15:24] foundation of the world to hear the word
[15:26] for this day you don't it's a bad year
[15:29] for you ahead if you are it's a great
[15:31] world for you ahead or a great day great
[15:33] year coming now New Year not to turn a
[15:37] new page a lot of people try to turn a
[15:38] new page on New Year turn it back the
[15:41] next
[15:42] day like a little story I was reading
[15:44] the other morning a woman hollered into
[15:47] her husband who' got up early and went
[15:50] out and got the morning paper and was
[15:51] reading the morning paper he said she
[15:53] said is there anything new in the news
[15:56] he said no just the same thing only
[15:59] different people that's about the way it
[16:01] is today same thing we got a new
[16:04] organization same old doctoring this ped
[16:07] around somebody got a little phase of it
[16:08] going this way that way this is a new
[16:11] day hallelujah amen this is a day that
[16:14] we should rise and shine in the power of
[16:16] Jesus Christ gross Darkness settling up
[16:19] on the earth there should be a new day
[16:21] for us yes indeed doing it just the way
[16:24] he does it but turn to his word and see
[16:28] the Promise that's promised for this day
[16:30] and you don't know where you're living
[16:31] in daylight or not changing the calendar
[16:34] doesn't change the time it only changes
[16:37] the calendar now closely
[16:40] listen do as David did put your future
[16:45] in his hand how what am I know what to
[16:47] do brother bham put your future in his
[16:50] hand no matter what comes or goes trust
[16:53] him he is the word now know David said
[16:59] his time is in my
[17:00] hand trust in him all the time always
[17:05] trust in him he knew who help the future
[17:09] David did that's reason you could say
[17:10] this there's only one holds the future
[17:14] that's God so you hold the future let
[17:16] him hold you all right some people says
[17:19] but brother bandom I have tried and I
[17:22] have tried but wait a minute patience is
[17:25] virtue patience is Holy Spirit virtue
[17:29] you they that wait upon the Lord shall
[17:31] renew their strength you saying how can
[17:35] I wait any longer just keep on
[17:39] waiting when you've done all you can do
[17:41] to stand then
[17:43] stand just stand how am I going to do it
[17:46] stand he said it's a truth and it's a
[17:48] truth he said it'll happen how I don't
[17:51] know but it'll happen he said so he
[17:54] promised it if he promised it it's going
[17:56] to happen that's all it can't wait waste
[17:59] so I just remember God took thousands of
[18:02] years to fulfill his promise of a coming
[18:05] savior 4,000 years God took to fulfill
[18:10] that promise but he know from the
[18:12] beginning just when it was going to
[18:14] happen he knew no one else did he just
[18:17] said it would happen and when it
[18:19] happened the people was in such a
[18:20] delusion till they didn't know how to
[18:22] accept it if that same thing hasn't
[18:24] repeated again it always does never
[18:27] fails both sides
[18:29] what did he do during these years he
[18:31] showed types of him coming he showed it
[18:33] in Joseph if you'd look at Joseph's life
[18:37] hated of his
[18:38] brothers loved of his father why because
[18:42] he was spiritual because he saw Visions
[18:45] the rest of them didn't see Visions they
[18:47] were Patriarchs but they didn't see
[18:49] Visions interpret dreams but they were
[18:51] jealous of him and he was sold almost
[18:54] for 30 pieces of silver raised up out of
[18:56] the ditch where he's supposed to be
[18:58] killed set at the right hand of pharaoh
[19:00] and when he left the throne the trumpet
[19:02] sounded bow the knee Joseph his coming
[19:04] just exactly what Jesus was done set at
[19:07] the right hand of God and when he leaves
[19:09] the throne the trumpets will sound and
[19:11] every knee shall bow and confess to
[19:13] Jesus Christ the son of God exactly he
[19:15] showed it in types of David when he's up
[19:17] on a rejected King looking over
[19:19] Jerusalem weeping how often I've heard
[19:21] you as a hen would Brew but you would
[19:23] not down to the age he showed it in
[19:25] types knowing that someday the last type
[19:28] would be fulfilled and the full
[19:31] manifestation of his promised Messiah
[19:33] would be there and when the full promise
[19:36] come though he typed
[19:39] it amen day after day year after year he
[19:44] typed it and when it come to the reality
[19:48] they didn't believe it am he's done the
[19:51] same
[19:53] thing typed it and showed it in the
[19:55] church ages and everything to the hour
[19:57] that we're living
[19:59] and people are in grow Darkness amen
[20:03] seem like they just can't comprehend it
[20:06] such a sad thing no more than see the
[20:09] young man out here fine big fine bill
[20:12] fell with his hair what C up like the
[20:15] women do and leg of Tarts on and a big
[20:17] long sweater hanging down purple shoes
[20:19] on masculine oh
[20:22] my what a horrible thing to call a man
[20:26] amen amen glory to God what a thing to
[20:29] call a man that's right see some woman
[20:32] supposed to be Danish and loving come
[20:34] out with a pair of men's trousers on her
[20:35] cigarette in her mouth and bobbed hair
[20:38] what a thing to call a
[20:40] woman Jesus called Mary
[20:43] woman should be call that just a
[20:46] female notice and they hour why
[20:50] sometimes people who claim and think
[20:52] they're sincere but a gross Darkness has
[20:54] got them in this the Bible said it would
[20:57] be like that read Isaiah six and find
[20:59] out if the women wasn't to do that way
[21:00] in the last days just exactly if what
[21:04] the Bible said they would be it's the
[21:06] word of God Jeremiah and different ones
[21:08] spoke of this hour that we're now living
[21:11] because they seen the end from the
[21:12] beginning so we see these things and
[21:14] gross Darkness upon the people yes it
[21:17] took God thousands of years thr showing
[21:20] types and everything and finally they
[21:23] did not know him when he come though he
[21:25] was portrayed and Joseph and David and
[21:28] Elijah all down through there he was
[21:30] portrayed with them and yet we can't
[21:33] understand why they didn't see it and
[21:35] there it was right in the scripture out
[21:37] of Bethlehem of Judea he would be born
[21:40] they find that in the scriptures how is
[21:42] to be born a virgin a virgin shall
[21:44] conceive and bear a child they call his
[21:46] name Emanuel why they kill him for
[21:47] because he made himself God Amen and he
[21:50] was God sure they made he said he make
[21:53] himself God equal with God saying I'm a
[21:55] Son of God well he
[21:57] was I said he should be called counselor
[22:00] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[22:03] Everlasting father
[22:05] wonderful that's what he was why didn't
[22:07] he understand that no wonder he said you
[22:09] to search the scriptures they said we're
[22:11] moses' disciples said if you was moses'
[22:13] disciples you'd know me Moses wrote of
[22:16] me and they didn't know it and the hours
[22:19] upon the people again when they'll go to
[22:21] their Creeds and things instead of the
[22:23] lovely Jesus that's right these great
[22:26] big things come up and bring them right
[22:27] into more Darkness more Darkness God
[22:29] declaring it in his word by signs and
[22:31] wonders in the heavens and the showing
[22:33] forthtelling things that happens just
[22:34] exactly to the hour and to the minute
[22:36] what did take place in that they
[22:38] continually walk right on the same way
[22:40] looks like they just can't help it good
[22:42] people yes sir doing the same thing now
[22:46] as they did then we are creatures of
[22:49] time God is creatures of Eternity God is
[22:52] a creature of Eternity he never did
[22:54] begin he never will end so why not just
[22:56] commit yourself to him look up and shine
[22:59] with the joy of the light of God's word
[23:02] that's shining today why can't people
[23:04] see that friends listen I'm your brother
[23:08] I love you wouldn't it be easy for me
[23:11] just to in tolerate when and go ahead
[23:13] and say oh well I compromise on this ion
[23:15] I'm not made out of that no sir when
[23:18] it's a word it's a word God help us to
[23:21] stand for that thing which is true yes
[23:23] sir it would be fine sure you get more
[23:26] pats on the bank but what I will I do
[23:28] stand there that day them bony fingers
[23:31] point my face and say you know better
[23:34] but you fail to tell us oh I'll be like
[23:37] Paul I'm not shun to declare to you the
[23:39] whole counsel of God
[23:40] know Let it go where it may be that's
[23:43] truth God knows it and he backs it up
[23:45] and says it's the truth turn to what the
[23:48] brother bam you You' be foolish to do
[23:50] such a thing turn to Christ and he is
[23:53] the
[23:54] word turn to Christ get away from Creeds
[23:57] get back in their I don't care you might
[23:59] started your Creed 500 years ago that
[24:01] you just that don't mean one thing to
[24:03] God them Sadducees and Pharisees started
[24:05] along before you did and were condemned
[24:09] call you try to place your evidence of
[24:12] the Holy Spirit upon different actions I
[24:15] believe in the manifestations of the
[24:17] Holy Spirit what does it do the
[24:19] Pentecostal says speaking in tongues is
[24:21] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost I've
[24:23] seen witches and wizards speak in
[24:25] tongues I've see them speak in tongues
[24:28] and drink blood out of a human skull and
[24:30] prophesy and deny there was such a thing
[24:31] as God I've been in a witch C where they
[24:34] lay a pencil on the table and make it
[24:35] jump up and down and write in unknown
[24:37] tongues and interpret it right that
[24:39] don't have a thing to it yet I believe
[24:40] God speaks in unknown tongues to his
[24:42] people let you put so much stress on
[24:45] that why should there be an interpreter
[24:47] why should have to be a message to the
[24:48] church and you other people you say the
[24:50] fruits of the spirit that's how we know
[24:52] love joy that's how we got the evidence
[24:54] it is that a Christian Science has got
