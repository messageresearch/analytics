[40:38] there is room at the cross
[40:41] amen uh we sank it Wednesday night as we
[40:44] were opening the service and again I
[40:46] wanted to also uh uh announce Wednesday
[40:50] night we had a prayer meeting because I
[40:54] got a I got an aent text from a brother
[40:58] I think I said it uh uh during the
[41:01] service and it was for a minister
[41:04] brother uh uh in the Colorado area that
[41:08] was uh pretty much on life support uh
[41:13] and uh uh in the state of colan so uh
[41:17] when the brother sent me the voicemail
[41:20] he sent it to me in around uh maybe
[41:22] around 12: or 1:00 a.m. in the morning
[41:25] and uh uh it was it was his son that
[41:29] wanted us to pray urgently so that was
[41:33] what I took uh the Wednesday night to be
[41:36] able to bring their prayer requests and
[41:38] and and different other needs that we
[41:40] pray for uh uh but then they pleased the
[41:43] Lord for the dear brother Toko to go to
[41:46] be with the Lord amen so uh
[41:50] uh he passed uh I think the next morning
[41:54] and uh uh
[41:58] uh his uh uh son testified in the text
[42:04] that uh that I read that uh uh he had
[42:09] such a smile on his face uh he was
[42:12] smiling as if if uh whether he was
[42:16] seeing something or there but he had
[42:18] such a smile on his face and uh that was
[42:21] the last expression that he had but he
[42:24] went to be with the Lord amen and we
[42:27] thank the Lord for that praise the
[42:31] Lord
[42:34] amen if there is any other thing that
[42:38] comes to my

[44:50] blessing to you
[44:51] amen it's uh it's it's it's been a
[44:54] blessing to me and I pray that the Lord
[44:57] Lord will make it a blessing to you
[44:59] title it Revelation chapter 4 that's the
[45:03] title after
[45:06] this door open in heaven that's what
[45:10] Revelation chapter 4 says after this I
[45:13] look and behold a door was opened in
[45:16] heaven so I'm titling this after
[45:22] this and a door open in
[45:25] heaven praise the Lord
[45:28] and then I ask a question what is
[45:32] this what is what is this after this a
[45:35] door open what is this what what
[45:37] actually it is praise the Lord what
[45:41] actually it is now if you if if we stay
[45:45] in context with the scripture after this
[45:48] is speaking about after the church
[45:54] ages because this is Revelation chapter
[45:57] of
[45:58] four praise the Lord are we together so
[46:02] we have just come out of the church ages
[46:05] so John is saying after this after what
[46:10] after the church
[46:14] ages are we
[46:16] together
[46:19] amen do you see the
[46:22] picture praise the Lord
[46:27] if we read something from Feast of the
[46:30] trumpet and uh uh if we read something
[46:34] from Feast of the trumpet you will you
[46:36] will see this and uh uh Feast of the
[46:46] trumpet this is the complete revelation
[46:49] of Jesus Christ there The Book of
[46:52] Revelation The Book of
[46:54] Revelation opens in verse one the
[46:58] revelation of Jesus Christ that's how
[47:01] the book open so it's is the complete
[47:04] revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven
[47:08] seal had the mystery head of what it all
[47:15] was and is supposed to open in the last
[47:19] day at the
[47:21] laition
[47:23] age at the end time
[47:27] thank be to
[47:30] God that finishes the message to the
[47:34] church so after the laish age the
[47:37] message to the church is finished but
[47:40] time has not finished yet that finished
[47:42] the message to the church that finishes
[47:46] it when they look
[47:49] back when they look back and see what
[47:53] has
[47:54] been and see where it all brought up to
[47:59] that finishes it the age of the church
[48:03] now I put this little quot here because
[48:07] after this make us to look
[48:11] back for us to be able to identify where
[48:14] we
[48:15] are as we look into what we want to look
[48:18] into this morning John said after
[48:22] this I look and behold a door was open
[48:26] in heaven so yeah brother bam is saying
[48:29] there the you know after the laisha age
[48:32] it brings an end to the church ages he
[48:34] says uh uh an an end of time thank be to
[48:38] God that finishes the message to the
[48:43] church when they look back and see what
[48:46] has been look back and see what has been
[48:49] in the church ages what God has been
[48:52] doing in in the church ages and that's
[48:55] exactly what we are doing when we when
[48:57] we talk about the book of Acts we are
[48:59] looking back to see what God did in that
[49:02] church ages when we talk about the time
[49:05] of Luther we are looking back to see
[49:07] what God did we talk about the time of
[49:10] the reformers we are looking back amen
[49:14] and then when we look back and see what
[49:17] God did in their Church age it gave us
[49:20] an idea of what he's doing now
[49:24] amen are we together
[49:28] praise the
[49:30] Lord so John says uh after this I look
[49:37] and behold a door was open in
[49:42] heaven what is
[49:47] that Josh how are you I didn't see you

[50:02] say let me just tell you immediately
[50:03] what I was
[50:05] saying let me just let you know the
[50:10] gossip praise the Lord but good to see
[50:13] you boy good to see you
[50:17] amen with treasure I was I was having
[50:20] some talk with the deacons yesterday and
[50:23] uh uh it was supposed to be an hour
[50:26] meeting we end up with almost 6
[50:29] hours praise the
[50:34] lord we end up almost 6 hours and uh
[50:39] uh as soon as we we were done I was
[50:42] supposed to stay to study a little bit I
[50:44] was so hungry I just packed my box and
[50:46] went
[50:50] home I called my wife I said is there
[50:53] any food she said I just F soup I said
[50:55] okay I'm on my way
[50:58] because uh praise the Lord but it was it
[51:01] was just a good time uh uh you know with
[51:05] uh with the deacons and and uh and one
[51:09] of the things we would we also talk
[51:11] about is in a sense of uh uh talking
[51:15] with uh about uh you know our growth I
[51:19] might I might approach some of that next
[51:22] week uh uh also kind of for looking for
[51:27] the time uh where we can uh have a
[51:31] church meeting and we have not had one
[51:34] for for the long time but uh we might
[51:37] plan to have one and just to bring
[51:39] ourself up to date you know I was
[51:42] telling the deacons I says uh uh you
[51:45] know when you when you when you read the
[51:48] Bible you think about a church could see
[51:51] you saying I just read your text message
[51:54] to the church thanking God for your
[51:57] daughter so and uh we pray that God
[52:07] will you talk you talk about the
[52:10] church you realize
[52:15] that we are people from different
[52:19] backgrounds different upbringings many
[52:22] of us from different
[52:24] churches we come together as a the
[52:27] body and uh we have a word the word of
[52:31] God is our
[52:35] standard and it's just like the Bible
[52:37] you read the Bible you
[52:40] read verses in the
[52:42] Bible and sometimes just one verse in
[52:46] the Bible can hold the life of an entire
[52:51] person praise the Lord just one verse in
[52:55] the Bible can hold the life of an entire
[52:58] person the Bible talks about John being
[53:01] at River Jordan and saw Jesus coming but
[53:05] it was not just joining
[53:07] Jesus there were a lot of people at the
[53:09] River Jordan amen before he got to the
[53:13] River Jordan there was something he did
[53:14] in the
[53:16] morning before Jesus left to come to
[53:19] John he came uh uh uh uh he came from
[53:23] somewhere you see so and and that is the
[53:26] same with with us we come together as a
[53:28] body as a church and and uh uh uh
[53:32] realizing what the word of God says we
[53:35] put expectation on ourself and and then
[53:38] uh as we go together you know we we Tred
[53:42] our best to keep the church by the word
[53:44] of God we try to do everything to keep a
[53:46] stander of the word of God and uh we try
[53:49] to you know not to get ourself uh
[53:52] engaged into things and uh living wrong
[53:55] and and FES and fights and all of that
[53:58] but you see it's it's just like our our
[54:01] our own
[54:03] life you know we all grow up and we have
[54:07] we have different Corners you know
[54:09] different changes you know I always love
[54:12] this this uh uh scripture uh David said
[54:17] in the sign except the Lord build the
[54:20] house the Builder worketh in vain I love
[54:24] it because
[54:27] for for a
[54:31] family and uh and and and also for the
[54:35] church God is building a
[54:39] house amen and and and that is the
[54:43] beautiful thing that is there is because
[54:45] God is building a house and every one of
[54:49] us we are just a stone in his hands we
[54:52] are just a break in their house and the
[54:56] beautiful thing about building a house
[54:58] is
[54:59] there uh you
[55:02] need a
[55:05] designer praise the
[55:07] Lord because you want you want your
[55:09] living room setting space you want your
[55:11] bedroom setting space you want a curve
[55:14] you don't want people to come right in
[55:16] the house and see you in the kitchen so
[55:18] put the kitchen this way T the break
[55:20] this way so you see that's it we have
[55:22] different turns that we have to turn
[55:25] when we are building the
[55:27] family it's easy if you are building a
[55:30] fence you just run it straight down the
[55:32] road just run it you know along the line
[55:36] but if you are building the house you
[55:37] got to turn the corner so we turn
[55:40] different Corners uh uh uh in our own
[55:43] family we turn different Corners as we
[55:46] grow together in the church we turn
[55:48] different Corners you know uh uh we
[55:50] dedicate babies when they were born and
[55:54] then when they get to an age of uh of uh
[55:57] showing a good conscience towards God we
[56:00] we baptize them in the name of the Lord
[56:02] Jesus Christ and uh you know uh for the
[56:05] few that we did baptized here in this
[56:07] church they're going to grow
[56:10] up and the set turning in uh turning of
[56:13] Corner in their life they will stray
[56:16] they will do things they will go away
[56:18] from
[56:19] church it's all part of growth praise
[56:23] the lord we have this sin L perfection
[56:27] in our
[56:28] mind and uh and and pretty soon it
[56:32] brings our faith into question when we
[56:35] start to experience those things praise
[56:38] the Lord but it's all part of our growth
[56:43] just like we dedicate babies if the Lord
[56:46] T it we're going to lay some to the
[56:50] Grave praise the Lord just the same as
[56:54] we bless marriages
[56:56] if the Lord T some will make some
[56:59] decisions and they may not
[57:02] continue it's it's all part of
[57:05] life it's not what we want it's not what
[57:10] is not the standard but sometimes people
[57:14] make
[57:17] choices are we
[57:19] together
[57:21] amen and I I say that to say is there
[57:25] I'm completely of of my note here Josh
[57:28] you don't want put me into that because
[57:30] I was trying to talk to the deacons and
[57:33] you know and and make them to to see
[57:35] their to me to me it's a sound of
[57:40] growth you might not see it as a sign of
[57:43] growth but I see it as a sign of
[57:46] growth praise the Lord amen I remember a
[57:51] good friend of mine it was a son that
[57:52] got married last week when I was gone
[57:55] and and uh uh there was a time where uh
[57:59] there were bunch of college students
[58:01] that was that were flooding into the
[58:03] church young people you know uh all of
[58:05] these guys they were all University
[58:07] student they stay up all night steuding
[58:09] you know uh they came to the message and
[58:12] these boys were steuding you know it
[58:14] came a certain time they started asking
[58:18] questions they were just pouring
[58:20] questions man challenging things you
[58:23] were
[58:24] preaching you have to go go back and and
[58:27] study your notes you know they were
[58:29] challenging and the pastor came to me my
[58:31] good friend he came to me and he says he
[58:34] said brother one what's going on you
[58:36] know what's what's happening I told him
[58:38] I says well it's growth he said what can
[58:40] I for growth these boys have becoming
[58:42] rebellious you say growth I say it's
[58:45] growth there is one time in life where
[58:47] you tell them to do they will do another
[58:49] time they will ask you why a sound of
[58:53] growth praise the Lord amen amen if you
[58:57] want to grow with us just s stick stick
[59:01] close praise the Lord let's get into
[59:04] what we want to talk
[59:06] about so uh uh uh we looking at this
[59:10] Revelation chapter 4 and John says after
[59:14] this we identify there that was the
[59:16] church edges I want to identify this
[59:19] open door he says after this look and
[59:22] behold a open a door was opened in
[59:25] heaven
[59:27] now in our natural mind is easy uh for
[59:32] you to see it like a vision you know you
[59:35] having a dream and the door just swing
[59:37] wide
[59:40] open but I want for us to study a little
[59:42] bit amen take your Bibles let's just go
[59:49] along let's look at uh St John chapter
[59:53] 10 St John chapter 10
[59:58] praise the
[1:00:03] Lord now St John chapter
[1:00:13] 10 St John chapter 10 let's read from
[1:00:16] verse 6 this Parable speak Jesus unto
[1:00:19] them but but they understood they
[1:00:22] understood not what think they uh
[1:00:26] this Parable speak Jesus unto them but
[1:00:29] they understood not what things they
[1:00:31] were which he speak unto
[1:00:34] them there St John chapter 10 am I
[1:00:38] reading from St John chapter 10 verse 7
[1:00:41] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[1:00:45] verily I said unto you I am the
[1:00:50] door of the sheep G Jesus here
[1:00:54] identifying himself as the door all that
[1:00:57] came all that ever came before me are
[1:01:02] teeths and rubber but the Sheep did not
[1:01:06] hear them verse 9 I am the
[1:01:10] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[1:01:15] be saved and shall go in and out and
[1:01:19] find
[1:01:21] pasture The Book of Revelation is what I
[1:01:24] just said it The Book of Revelation is
[1:01:27] what the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:31] praise the
[1:01:33] Lord the revelation of Jesus Christ so
[1:01:37] we have to pay attention to
[1:01:39] that that most things in everything in
[1:01:43] the Book of Revelations identify Jesus
[1:01:46] in one way what he's doing in his
[1:01:50] church are we together now so we see
[1:01:54] here in uh uh St John chapter 10 that
[1:01:57] he's identifying himself that I am the
[1:02:00] door to the sheep for
[1:02:09] amen so if he is the door to the sheep
[1:02:13] for follow me now and you you'll grab
[1:02:15] the picture of where we are getting here
[1:02:18] and John is saying I see a a door
[1:02:23] open then we realize there that uh
[1:02:27] this Open
[1:02:29] Door is a further revelation of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ it's an opening of Jesus Christ
[1:02:38] it's an understanding of Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ do you grab the picture amen okay
[1:02:47] further Revelation just keep that in the
[1:02:49] back of your mind I will come to it
[1:02:51] let's uh let's look at this you look in
[1:02:54] Genesis chapter 7
[1:02:56] you realize we will not read that I
[1:02:58] would just only emphasize you realize
[1:03:00] that there was an open door for seven
[1:03:04] days the ACT door was
[1:03:06] open amen amen praise the Lord for seven
[1:03:10] days God had the ACT door open before he
[1:03:13] finally shut it and then the rain came
[1:03:15] down keep that in the back of your mind
[1:03:18] also let's take our Bibles again and
[1:03:20] look at Acts Chapter 14 verse 27 acts
[1:03:26] chap 14:
[1:03:34] 27 Acts Chapter 14 verse
[1:03:50] 27 Acts Chapter 14 verse 27 we we just
[1:03:55] pick up some few verses here and that
[1:03:57] will give us an idea of what we want to
[1:03:59] look into verse 27 here it says and when
[1:04:02] they were come and had gathered the
[1:04:04] church together they rehearse all that
[1:04:08] God has done with them and how he had
[1:04:15] opened the door of Faith onto the
[1:04:21] Gentiles praise the Lord so yes Peter
[1:04:25] the coming now to this uh uh uh Council
[1:04:29] uh uh in Jerusalem and now Peter is
[1:04:32] going to he he's going to testify he's
[1:04:34] coming from kena's house what God has
[1:04:37] done there and now he's saying God has
[1:04:40] given them an Open Door of Faith so we
[1:04:43] know it's not a natural
[1:04:45] door God have given them an
[1:04:48] access amen God have given them an
[1:04:52] opportunity to take the gospel to the
[1:04:54] Gentiles so it's an Open Door
[1:04:58] amen praise the Lord so an Open Door in
[1:05:01] heaven is not an natural door it's not a
[1:05:05] natural
[1:05:07] door Jesus is the
[1:05:10] door are we
[1:05:14] together 1 Corinthians chapter 16 1
[1:05:18] Corinthians chapter
[1:05:23] 16 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:27] 16:9 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:30] 16:9 I think the young people back there
[1:05:33] said if more faster than me for a great
[1:05:37] door
[1:05:38] and if an effectual is
[1:05:42] open unto me and there are many
[1:05:47] adversary now Paul testifying here that
[1:05:50] a great door and and and this this great
[1:05:53] door that he's talking about also also
[1:05:56] is an Avenue to take the
[1:06:01] gospel
[1:06:03] amen and having you to take the gospel 2
[1:06:07] Corinthians chapter
[1:06:18] 2:12 furthermore when I
[1:06:21] came to trust to preach Christ's gospel
[1:06:25] at door was open unto me of the Lord so
[1:06:29] it's the same thing he had an Avenue
[1:06:31] there were places that he went and he
[1:06:34] never had an Open Door they chase him
[1:06:37] out of the synagogues they ran him out
[1:06:39] of the city but uh uh he's testifying
[1:06:43] here that God did give him an open door
[1:06:46] to preach the gospel are we
[1:06:51] together collu let's take this one and
[1:06:54] then we go now into our subject just
[1:06:56] trying to use there to lay the
[1:06:58] background here and give you an idea
[1:07:01] collusion the book of collusion chapter
[1:07:03] 4
[1:07:12] verse3 amen amen but are praying also
[1:07:16] for us that God will open unto us a door
[1:07:20] of
[1:07:22] utterance is the same thing give giving
[1:07:25] us an open door so we can share the
[1:07:29] gospel amen amen we're looking for an
[1:07:33] open door so we can share the
[1:07:35] gospel and I will I will share some
[1:07:38] things with you uh I I feel the same
[1:07:42] here uh I feel the same been looking for
[1:07:45] an open door and uh uh
[1:07:49] uh we we we do that uh you know uh
[1:07:55] sometimes we want to just keep setting
[1:07:58] things in prayer but we've been we've
[1:08:00] been kind of for looking for open doors
[1:08:03] to see whether we could be able to share
[1:08:05] the word with uh with some communities
[1:08:10] that are around the city I'll will leave
[1:08:12] it as
[1:08:13] that and we just pray that ask that you
[1:08:16] pray for us that God will give us an
[1:08:19] Open Door amen now so we when you when
[1:08:22] you see this now uh we just use those
[1:08:26] verses to be able to create the picture
[1:08:29] John saw an Open
[1:08:31] Door in a vision is described as an open
[1:08:35] door but then we going to
[1:08:37] see what that open door is he says a
[1:08:41] door open in heaven and We Know that
[1:08:45] heaven from the fourth seal Heaven is
[1:08:48] consist of the
[1:08:50] word praise the Lorden amen
[1:08:55] Heaven is consist of the
[1:08:58] word now so uh so an Open Door in heaven
[1:09:03] will be a further
[1:09:06] revelation of Jesus Christ a further
[1:09:09] Revelation now I would just show you it
[1:09:12] right there in uh in uh uh Revelation
[1:09:15] chapter 4 let's go back to Revelation
[1:09:17] chapter
[1:09:24] 4 I show you as as we go after this I
[1:09:28] looked and behold a door was opened in
[1:09:31] heaven and and the and the first verse
[1:09:34] which I heard was as it were of a
[1:09:40] trumpet talking to me how can a trumpet
[1:09:42] be
[1:09:44] talking
[1:09:46] amen a trumpet supposed to be making
[1:09:48] sound but this one the trumpet was
[1:09:51] talking so right here it make us to know
[1:09:54] that this trumpet was a gospel trumpet
[1:09:58] amen amen it was a gospel
[1:10:01] trumpet which said the trumpet said unto
[1:10:04] me come up hither and I will show I will
[1:10:08] show thee things which must be year
[1:10:12] after so things which must happen after
[1:10:15] the church
[1:10:16] ages after this is the church ages but
[1:10:20] the trumpet is saying come up come up
[1:10:24] which of course is calling to us for
[1:10:27] spiritual growth amen amen praise the
[1:10:31] Lorden it's coming to us for spiritual
[1:10:33] growth you see God cannot give us any
[1:10:37] more in his word if we are not
[1:10:40] doing much with what we
[1:10:44] have God can't give you Revelation
[1:10:46] that's why Jesus said he can't cast his
[1:10:50] uh peace before
[1:10:51] swam God cannot give you precious things
[1:10:55] if you are not doing well with what you
[1:11:01] have are we
[1:11:04] together so it's a call it's a call
[1:11:08] stepping out of the church a stepping
[1:11:11] out of just the place of being the
[1:11:13] church member stepping out of the place
[1:11:15] of just being complacent with our Sunday
[1:11:18] service and the Wednesday service no
[1:11:21] stepping up let's come up higher amen
[1:11:24] amen amen
[1:11:25] amen are we
[1:11:28] together let's come up
[1:11:30] higher is a place where we can tear
[1:11:33] ourself the truth in love
[1:11:37] amen are we
[1:11:41] together so he's calling us to a higher
[1:11:44] form of relationship a higher form of
[1:11:48] commitment higher form of devotion now
[1:11:51] immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:11:54] behold oh a throne was set in heaven and
[1:11:59] one sat on the throne now you will see
[1:12:02] this is where it it help us to see that
[1:12:05] is a further revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:09] because here is going to explain the
[1:12:18] godhead the Bible says there was a
[1:12:21] throne one throne and one sat in heaven
[1:12:28] so there is no room for the teaching of
[1:12:31] Father Son and the Holy Ghost because
[1:12:32] there is just one throne and one sat
[1:12:35] upon the
[1:12:37] throne and this one that sat upon the
[1:12:39] throne is going to be looked at as the
[1:12:42] Jasper and and and SN Stones which is uh
[1:12:47] jaspa that's the 12 Stones and and it
[1:12:49] means the Alpha and Omega it means the
[1:12:53] beginning and the end
[1:12:56] is he's the one sitting on the throne so
[1:12:59] a a farther another revelation of Jesus
[1:13:02] Christ we're going to see it in in in
[1:13:05] Revelation Chapter 2 and 3 the church
[1:13:07] edges we saw Jesus in the midst of the
[1:13:10] can
[1:13:12] stake he identified himself in the midst
[1:13:15] of the church now we are at another
[1:13:19] level now where he's going to identify
[1:13:21] himself on the
[1:13:23] throne amen
[1:13:26] amen are we together
[1:13:33] amen are we
[1:13:36] together praise the Lord so we see this
[1:13:40] is a open
[1:13:41] door there is a uh uh uh an access has
[1:13:45] been given to us this is an
[1:13:49] opportunity just like the door of the
[1:13:52] Ark was
[1:13:54] open it was open for those that wanted
[1:13:56] to go in Praise the Lord
[1:14:01] hallelujah Moses I mean Noah
[1:14:04] responsibility was to preach the message
[1:14:07] he was not weeping the animal in neither
[1:14:10] were he told to whip the people
[1:14:13] in are we
[1:14:16] together we can whip you in that's what
[1:14:19] I'm going to that's what I'm want to say
[1:14:20] we can whip you in it's not
[1:14:23] righteousness to whip you in you have to
[1:14:26] grab
[1:14:27] it see the importance and step into
[1:14:32] it amen that's the only way it's going
[1:14:34] to be a blessing to
[1:14:41] you a window of opportunity if we can
[1:14:45] call it like that we always say a window
[1:14:47] I got a window of opportunity you hear
[1:14:49] people say just step inside just step in
[1:14:51] the company step your foot through the
[1:14:53] door
[1:14:55] they are not telling you say open this
[1:14:56] door and go outside they telling you say
[1:14:59] just the opportunity that is there step
[1:15:02] in it amen that's what is
[1:15:08] happening glory be to
[1:15:11] God a little bit
[1:15:14] uh so and and and and and and that is
[1:15:17] the way it is that's the way that God
[1:15:21] deals with us
[1:15:25] just like how John we will deal with
[1:15:27] John's subject but just like how John is
[1:15:30] seeing an open door here and and and and
[1:15:34] uh and and the trumpet is calling him
[1:15:36] come up higher John step out of the
[1:15:38] church Ages come and let me show you
[1:15:41] things after after the church ages let
[1:15:43] me show you things things that you're
[1:15:45] going to step into things that you're
[1:15:48] going to Marvel at things that are going
[1:15:51] to be so wonderful amen
[1:15:55] praise the Lord there is more to
[1:15:58] Christian life than don't lie don't
[1:16:00] steal don't fornicate don't fight there
[1:16:03] is more to Christian life than
[1:16:05] that this Bible is so filled with uh a
[1:16:09] bountiful of
[1:16:11] riches mystery things that we can
[1:16:16] learn amen praise the Lord amen the guy
[1:16:21] that wrote that that bill the the the
[1:16:25] the
[1:16:26] compass he was a a US Navy officer they
[1:16:30] have the the Navy they have a a plaque
[1:16:33] there in honor of him that buil the
[1:16:36] compass for for seed that he used for
[1:16:40] seed he was reading his
[1:16:44] Bible a verse struck
[1:16:49] him praise the Lord it was a verse in
[1:16:53] the Bible that struck him
[1:16:58] and being the Navy officer being trained
[1:17:01] to observe on the
[1:17:04] sea that verse Inspire
[1:17:07] him to build a compass how to travel on
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:16] sea praise the Lord
[1:17:22] amen there are a lot of things in the
[1:17:24] word
[1:17:25] M that we can talk about praise the Lord
[1:17:30] amen then it's it's almost like every
[1:17:32] Serv we got to be fighting with people
[1:17:34] it looks like it look like they were
[1:17:36] talking to me today or they were talking
[1:17:37] to somebody
[1:17:40] today we have to be enjoying the
[1:17:43] word
[1:17:46] amen but you see that's the way that God
[1:17:48] does it he won't give us anymore he
[1:17:50] won't take us to the next level
[1:17:55] if our mind and heart is not conditioned
[1:17:57] to move on with
[1:18:00] him if we are still playing around and
[1:18:02] you know uh uh controlled by habits and
[1:18:05] different things I
[1:18:08] mean the preaching of the Gospel will
[1:18:10] just become intellectual we just come
[1:18:12] and tell you stories and Fascinate your
[1:18:16] mind but we're not really moving in the
[1:18:18] spirit to the next
[1:18:22] level until we are rightly
[1:18:26] using what is in our
[1:18:29] hands the the the the truth that we know
[1:18:33] we have to put it to
[1:18:36] use amen Paul says we must exercise
[1:18:41] ourself in the truth that's what he said
[1:18:44] we must exercise ourself said that in
[1:18:47] the book of Hebrew let's let's move on
[1:18:49] here let's move on you see that's that's
[1:18:52] what happened that's what happened you
[1:18:54] are you are you are so inspired to bring
[1:18:59] something but you you still feed the P
[1:19:03] you stay feel the pool you stay feel
[1:19:06] things pulling you back
[1:19:09] to to talk about all of these things
[1:19:13] amen
[1:19:17] amen Revelation chapter 3 Revelation
[1:19:21] chapter 3 let's go back in Revelation
[1:19:25] chapter 3 there's another open door we
[1:19:27] want to identify Revelation chapter
[1:19:49] 3 Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 uh is
[1:19:53] that verse 20 no Revelation CH
[1:19:56] 3:8 Revelation CH
[1:20:07] 3:8 Revelation chapter
[1:20:16] 3:8 I know th Works behold I have set
[1:20:20] before thee an open door and no man can
[1:20:24] shut it
[1:20:25] for thou have a little
[1:20:28] strength and have kept my
[1:20:31] word and have not denied my
[1:20:36] name praise the Lord amen amen th H have
[1:20:41] kept my word and have not denied my name
[1:20:44] now you have to realize that this is the
[1:20:47] Philadelphia Church age amen the age of
[1:20:50] Brotherly Love praise the Lord amen this
[1:20:55] is the age of the great
[1:20:58] reformers so God is saying here that uh
[1:21:03] uh I've set before you an Open Door what
[1:21:06] was this open door this open door was
[1:21:08] the door that Martin Luther stepped in I
[1:21:11] mean lter of the of the uh the reformer
[1:21:14] lther this was the door that he stepped
[1:21:16] in to defy catalyzing when he when he
[1:21:20] nailed the thesis on the door it was the
[1:21:23] door that he it was that open door that
[1:21:26] he stepped
[1:21:27] in because this was all
[1:21:31] under the Philadelphia Church age this
[1:21:35] was the age of great
[1:21:37] reformers this was called the missionary
[1:21:41] age it was that open door that was open
[1:21:45] that's why John Wesley John H H uh smade
[1:21:49] and all of these gu cells they were all
[1:21:51] running around the coast they they would
[1:21:53] just get on the next ship they want to
[1:21:55] take the gospel to this place they want
[1:21:57] to get on it I mean that's it was this
[1:22:00] open door now see what the Bible says
[1:22:02] the Bible says that uh uh for thou have
[1:22:06] a little
[1:22:11] strength this is God's
[1:22:13] word but that little strength was
[1:22:16] anointing men in different parts of the
[1:22:20] word to take the gospel amen
[1:22:25] some of them were were having insight
[1:22:27] into the word they were writing book and
[1:22:30] and and and Charles pin and and and uh
[1:22:33] uh uh uh John G leges and all of these
[1:22:37] guys they were all operating on this
[1:22:42] verse they were all operating under this
[1:22:46] anointing and Open Door see another
[1:22:49] thing there let's identify the Bible
[1:22:51] says you have a little strength and have
[1:22:54] kept my word and have not denied my name
[1:23:00] what was happening here the name of
[1:23:02] Jesus was returning back in
[1:23:05] baptism okay good you see the name of
[1:23:09] Jesus Christ because why in the Dark
[1:23:12] Ages it was
[1:23:15] killed and and and calm introduced the
[1:23:18] church to Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] yeah
[1:23:25] are we
[1:23:27] together but you see here God has has
[1:23:31] has has promised God had had an
[1:23:34] anointing that will restore that will
[1:23:36] bring back the name of Jesus back in the
[1:23:40] church amen amen amen thank you Lord
[1:23:46] amen are we together
[1:23:49] amen amen amen
[1:23:55] so you see there was an open
[1:23:58] door and this open door was an
[1:24:02] opportunity that all these great
[1:24:04] reformers use to carry the gospel
[1:24:09] out
[1:24:14] amen the the the move of of Luther out
[1:24:17] of the the the the Catholic Church
[1:24:20] remember he was a
[1:24:21] priest his move out of the Catholic
[1:24:24] Church uh weaken the grape of the king
[1:24:28] over the
[1:24:30] church praise the Lord because at that
[1:24:34] time the church and the and and and the
[1:24:36] and the state was
[1:24:40] one they were they were preaching what
[1:24:42] the king wanted them to preach but when
[1:24:44] when they make their
[1:24:46] move God gave them an open door now
[1:24:50] think about it now we're talking about
[1:24:51] history we're talking about church
[1:24:53] history and things that God did in the
[1:24:58] ages but as long as Mercy is stay with
[1:25:03] us the mercy of God Is An Open Door to
[1:25:07] you every day of your
[1:25:11] life when God gave you his Mercy he has
[1:25:15] opened door for you to step
[1:25:19] out and become better am
[1:25:30] are we
[1:25:34] together we are talking about church
[1:25:36] history we talking about our uh uh uh uh
[1:25:42] further Revelation progressive
[1:25:44] revelation I mean all of those things I
[1:25:46] mean yeah that's that's what we are
[1:25:47] talking about but uh we we we we I don't
[1:25:50] want to Hank you in the air I don't want
[1:25:52] to lost you I want to bring the word
[1:25:55] down to
[1:25:57] you amen amen we have to take it and
[1:26:01] apply it to
[1:26:05] ourself if God would give an age take
[1:26:09] the church out of persecution death and
[1:26:12] gave the age an open door for people to
[1:26:16] come back to a fresh breath of
[1:26:19] Truth praise the Lord amen
[1:26:25] he would do the
[1:26:27] same for every one of
[1:26:31] us praise the Lord amen whenever you
[1:26:35] think about the mercy of God that's what
[1:26:38] the mercy of God
[1:26:41] is his mercy endureth
[1:26:45] forever he always give you an Open Door
[1:26:50] praise the Lord for you to step out of
[1:26:53] horri
[1:26:55] situation am and become
[1:27:07] better praise the Lord amen so you see
[1:27:12] here we identified uh St John chapter 10
[1:27:15] Jesus says I am the door
[1:27:19] amen we see how he's he's giving the
[1:27:23] people for an Open
[1:27:27] Door well Revelation chap 10 Revelation
[1:27:30] 3:2 let's read
[1:27:40] it behold I stand at the door and
[1:27:43] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:27:47] the door I will
[1:27:50] come into him and will soup with him and
[1:27:54] he with me praise the
[1:27:59] Lord are we together
[1:28:02] amen
[1:28:04] now over the period of time that verse
[1:28:08] which of course is is is a personal
[1:28:11] application behold I stand at the door
[1:28:13] and knock he's knocking at our heart
[1:28:16] door that is the personal
[1:28:19] application but it also represent the
[1:28:22] age
[1:28:25] amen because Philadelphia age he gave
[1:28:29] them an open door to come out of the the
[1:28:33] the the the system and uh uh uh come out
[1:28:38] and with that little strength and now
[1:28:40] here he standing at the
[1:28:46] door praise the
[1:28:52] Lord and this this is the Lish age he's
[1:28:56] standing at the church door Christ you
[1:28:59] have to remember he was kicked out of
[1:29:01] the
[1:29:02] church
[1:29:04] amen he was kicked out of the church the
[1:29:07] the they brought in all Jupiters and and
[1:29:10] and all their idols and give them
[1:29:12] Christian names and and burn candles to
[1:29:15] them a lot of Celebration even even our
[1:29:18] Easter and Christmas they are all out of
[1:29:20] uh uh Roman idolatry and all of those
[1:29:24] things were introduced to the church
[1:29:27] Christ was completely kicked out of the
[1:29:30] church
[1:29:36] amen why because Rome
[1:29:39] knows that knows that Israel had a
[1:29:43] Commandment that yeah oh Israel the Lord
[1:29:46] our God is only one God and thou should
[1:29:48] not worship any graving image so they
[1:29:51] knew that the Jews Will Never B bow down
[1:29:54] to worship their Nero or their Caesar or
[1:29:57] none of their governor they knew that
[1:29:59] the Jews would never do
[1:30:02] that praise the Lord and this new faith
[1:30:05] that is born under Judaism that is now
[1:30:09] called Christian that is giving lot of
[1:30:11] allegiance to This Man Called
[1:30:14] Jesus they knew that Christians also
[1:30:16] will not bow down to worship their
[1:30:21] Idols praise the Lord so all they have
[1:30:24] to do is to just be part of
[1:30:27] it and that's how Constantine came he
[1:30:30] wanted to go for the wall he asked the
[1:30:32] church to pray for him he came in and
[1:30:35] and decid to become uh h h a part of the
[1:30:38] church but he was not
[1:30:42] converted praise the Lord and he used
[1:30:46] his Roman
[1:30:47] Authority and slowly started turning the
[1:30:51] church
[1:30:52] away from Christ
[1:30:55] to
[1:30:58] Caesar praise the
[1:31:01] Lord so Christ was kicked out of the
[1:31:04] church now so here Lish Revelation 10:20
[1:31:09] is introducing us to a period of time
[1:31:11] where Christ is coming back into his
[1:31:15] church amen amen the fullness of the
[1:31:19] word is coming back into the church but
[1:31:22] the church has to let it in in amen
[1:31:26] amen praise the Lord he said behold I
[1:31:29] stand at the door and
[1:31:31] knock praise the
[1:31:35] Lorden so he started knocking at the
[1:31:37] church door how was he knocking at the
[1:31:40] church door by ausa Street sending the
[1:31:43] gifts back to the
[1:31:45] church amen amen knocking the church
[1:31:49] door but they did not let him in they
[1:31:53] call a
[1:31:57] ISM so you know what happened at the
[1:32:00] very time this scripture was fulfilling
[1:32:04] and the church refused to let it in then
[1:32:06] Revelation 18:4 also Echo come out of
[1:32:10] all my
[1:32:13] people so Revelation 18:4 by prophecy
[1:32:17] happened at this very very
[1:32:22] time come out of for my people and don't
[1:32:25] be partaker of a
[1:32:30] sin are we
[1:32:32] together that's all church history read
[1:32:34] the church age book you you understand
[1:32:36] that now so H uh I mean I mean I mean
[1:32:40] those things are done I'm I'm I'm just
[1:32:43] I'm just you know hanging around here
[1:32:46] just because we are looking at this open
[1:32:49] door so we see here that uh uh uh
[1:32:55] uh we have used all of this to establish
[1:32:59] with you that the open door was a
[1:33:03] further Revelation a further
[1:33:06] understanding a further revealing of
[1:33:10] Christ they are more things that he was
[1:33:13] going to reveal to the
[1:33:15] church are we
[1:33:20] together amen
[1:33:33] let me let me share something with you
[1:33:35] here and uh maybe that would give you a
[1:33:38] little a little bit of anchor in what we
[1:33:41] are looking at I'm very well sure I
[1:33:43] won't be able to get through all this
[1:33:45] today but
[1:33:48] uh uh
[1:33:54] the call is to come up higher
[1:33:56] amen is to come up higher I believe that
[1:33:59] is the spirit call to the believer amen
[1:34:02] God is expecting us to come up above you
[1:34:05] know uh uh where we are you know there's
[1:34:08] one thing that God do that uh uh love
[1:34:11] for his people is uh complacency amen
[1:34:15] When the People starts to become uh
[1:34:18] complacent and you know and uh uh
[1:34:21] complacent said it's a little sense of
[1:34:22] backsliding
[1:34:25] you know and and that's why the mama ego
[1:34:27] will tear the net she will destroy the
[1:34:29] net because she want her babies to
[1:34:32] exercise their wings amen and not to get
[1:34:36] too comfortable with the net she want

[1:39:27] right praise the Lord amen why because
[1:39:30] he was going to bring them into things
[1:39:32] yes that's why he told them in Matthew
[1:39:34] chapter 4 you have heard chapter 5 you
[1:39:37] know you have heard that that I mean
[1:39:40] thou shall not kill that was the Old
[1:39:41] Testament but now I said if you even
[1:39:43] think evil against your brother without
[1:39:46] a
[1:39:49] CA thou shall not commit adultery he
[1:39:51] said if you even lost a the
[1:39:54] woman why he was bringing them through
[1:39:57] an Open Door
[1:40:00] amen he was bringing them through to
[1:40:03] another step
[1:40:08] amen praise the Lord amen I mean that's
[1:40:11] the way we all that have grown we we
[1:40:14] have all come through that you know I
[1:40:15] was thinking about that the last time
[1:40:17] and I I I was driving I was just
[1:40:19] thinking about it you know uh uh even uh
[1:40:23] they little the lest one yet Among Us
[1:40:25] who is that let's let's take uh
[1:40:29] uh uh Karen no Olivia yeah we we love
[1:40:33] her but not her
[1:40:35] now I mean the one that can talk and and
[1:40:39] tell her says you are a baby she said no
[1:40:42] I'm not a
[1:40:44] baby and tell redeem that you are a baby
[1:40:49] she would say no I'm not a baby now but
[1:40:52] a one that is older than her will still
[1:40:55] see her as a baby no you are a baby say
[1:40:59] no I'm not a
[1:41:01] baby praise the Lord what am I saying is
[1:41:05] that uh uh wherever level we are we can
[1:41:09] be able to identify that growth to us
[1:41:15] it's a growth the little child is saying
[1:41:18] she's not a baby because she knows she's
[1:41:20] not sucking uh uh you know uh mil and uh
[1:41:24] you know so so that's so that's why she
[1:41:26] saying I'm not a baby I'm not a
[1:41:28] baby but you're the older one you can
[1:41:31] see that she's a baby she needs to what
[1:41:34] grow up amen so okay you say you are not
[1:41:37] a baby stop doing
[1:41:40] this well you say there to be able to
[1:41:43] challenge her growth right you say there
[1:41:47] to be able to help her to
[1:41:50] identify that when I say you are a baby
[1:41:52] it's because you you are still doing
[1:41:55] this praise the Lord and that is the
[1:41:58] same way with every one of us we need to
[1:42:00] grow up but at the place where we are
[1:42:03] there is some sense of contentment where
[1:42:06] we feel like we we are grown I mean you
[1:42:09] need to grow up I mean what do you mean
[1:42:11] what you mean I need to grow
[1:42:13] up what do you mean I need to grow up I
[1:42:16] have my own house are you paying my
[1:42:20] renten praise the Lord I mean that's
[1:42:23] that that is the
[1:42:24] action that is the way you can think in
[1:42:27] your mind praise the Lord but you see
[1:42:32] the voice that is talking to John is
[1:42:35] coming from above and if that voice from
[1:42:39] above is telling you to grow a means you
[1:42:41] come and meet me if you think you have
[1:42:43] grown come into the heavens
[1:42:53] we
[1:42:56] together and sometimes that is that is
[1:42:58] the thing with us in our own individual
[1:43:08] work praise the Lord
[1:43:12] amen that is the thing with us in our
[1:43:14] own individual
[1:43:21] work if
[1:43:26] we it's almost like couple of weeks ago
[1:43:29] we were talking about
[1:43:32] uh
[1:43:34] uh the tree of light evening from the
[1:43:36] Tree of light Moses said right there if
[1:43:38] I read these things to you this curs is
[1:43:40] to you and you say in your heart that it
[1:43:43] do not pertain to me he says you are you
[1:43:46] are drinking with the
[1:43:48] drunken and uh uh so it is it is this
[1:43:54] place where sometimes it is it is the
[1:43:57] toughest thing and the more hard thing
[1:44:00] you know uh uh to be able to instruct
[1:44:06] somebody that has the question to
[1:44:09] everything you know it's hard to have a
[1:44:11] conversation with someone like
[1:44:13] that you know that has the answer to
[1:44:17] everything and also it's is it's it's
[1:44:22] difficult because you are not being fair
[1:44:25] to yourself you are not giving yourself
[1:44:28] an opportunity to
[1:44:32] learn praise the Lord amen you are not
[1:44:36] giving yourself you might even know it
[1:44:38] you might even know it better than I can
[1:44:40] explain
[1:44:41] it but maybe my
[1:44:44] explanation will give you another way to
[1:44:48] look at that think
[1:44:54] praise the Lord
[1:44:56] amen so even when a child is telling you
[1:44:59] something allow them to talk allow them
[1:45:01] let them explain let them explain how
[1:45:03] they can do
[1:45:04] it and join them into the joy of their
[1:45:09] explanation praise the
[1:45:13] Lord if you don't get anything from
[1:45:16] there you might enjoy a little
[1:45:20] childishness if you don't get anything
[1:45:23] from what the child have said you might
[1:45:25] enjoy a little
[1:45:29] childishness praise the
[1:45:33] Lord now so we looking at this uh open
[1:45:37] door
[1:45:39] here want to take you into another
[1:45:42] another curve now but uh if I start that
[1:45:45] it will be it it will be hard for us to
[1:45:48] to close there but I just I just uh
[1:46:00] uh Ephesian
[1:46:03] chapter Ephesians chapter
[1:46:07] 3 Ephesians chapter three I I'll close
[1:46:10] my notes for now
[1:46:12] um looking at the whole lot let me let
[1:46:15] me see I can use this and just find a
[1:46:18] place to close
[1:46:19] here praise the Lord amen
[1:46:28] uh praise the Lord I'm laughing because
[1:46:33] uh I have a brother a pastor friend that
[1:46:36] do follow our service he might he might
[1:46:39] be following us and
[1:46:43] uh you always you always get after me
[1:46:46] when he call me say brother it was it
[1:46:48] was a good talk but you kept the people
[1:46:50] too long
[1:46:57] so so we were out last week in uh in New
[1:47:03] Jersey with brother Valentine he and
[1:47:05] brother Valentine over in North
[1:47:08] Carolina so uh uh uh I heard the pastor
[1:47:12] was you know trying he was making some
[1:47:14] emphasis talking about marriage and
[1:47:16] different things and you know making the
[1:47:18] emphasis you know we we are the message
[1:47:20] of the hour the the message of the hour
[1:47:23] so when I came on the ppit I says well
[1:47:26] I'm going to preach the message of the
[1:47:28] hour then they didn't grab what I was
[1:47:31] saying but I meant I was going to stay
[1:47:32] in an
[1:47:36] hour
[1:47:38] so so
[1:47:41] uh so as as we went as we went ahead you
[1:47:45] know I kept I kept emphasizing you
[1:47:47] believe the message of the hour
[1:47:48] everybody say amen I okay I try to
[1:47:50] preach the message of the hour you know
[1:47:53] and I I I tried and uh uh it's hard to
[1:47:56] stay in an hour I went a little over an
[1:47:59] hour because I was preaching with an
[1:48:02] interpreter so I told them he take one
[1:48:04] hour I take one
[1:48:06] hour so then after the service you know
[1:48:09] the brother called he was talking with
[1:48:11] the other brother how the service oh
[1:48:13] yeah you know yeah brother wanton preach
[1:48:15] and was he says how long did he preach
[1:48:17] no he's still out okay tell him he's
[1:48:19] doing well
[1:48:23] you know we good friends we we we we
[1:48:27] enjoy teasing one another we enjoy
[1:48:31] Ephesians chapter 1 let's look in
[1:48:32] Ephesians chapter
[1:48:37] 1 let me let me use this in close I'm
[1:48:41] I'm I'm all over the
[1:48:43] place I can't keep
[1:48:46] still Ephesians chapter 1 let's read
[1:48:48] verse
[1:48:51] three blessed be the God and
[1:48:54] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[1:48:58] blessed us with all spiritual blessing
[1:49:00] in Heavenly
[1:49:02] places now you see John there was told
[1:49:06] to come up
[1:49:09] higher why because it's the believer's
[1:49:12] position now Paul here is telling us
[1:49:15] that our blessing is in Heavenly
[1:49:18] places our blessing is not so much in
[1:49:22] you know how much we can be able to
[1:49:24] labor to do but our blessing is so much
[1:49:27] in our spiritual position
[1:49:32] am our spiritual
[1:49:35] position there was no way on Earth the
[1:49:38] heavens that Joseph will have ever been
[1:49:42] a prime minister of
[1:49:44] Egypt until he form his spiritual
[1:49:48] position and what was his spiritual
[1:49:50] position he had to be sold into Egypt
[1:49:53] yes he had to go to praise
[1:49:56] him to find his way to the throne that's
[1:50:00] righten so you see his Blessing of being
[1:50:04] a prime minister came from his physical
[1:50:08] position his spiritual
[1:50:10] position physically it was not looking
[1:50:12] nice it was not looking
[1:50:14] beautiful that her own Brothers will
[1:50:17] will sell him but spiritually he came to
[1:50:21] understand that you made it for evil but
[1:50:24] God made it for
[1:50:31] good you see so our blessing is in our
[1:50:36] spiritual
[1:50:38] position
[1:50:41] amen he has blessed us with all
[1:50:44] spiritual blessing in Heavenly
[1:50:48] places in Christ
[1:50:50] Jesus Ephesians chapter 6 this is a
[1:50:53] common one if you've been around this
[1:50:55] church a long time you might have heard
[1:50:57] me saying
[1:51:06] this praise the
[1:51:09] Lord or if you want me to be a preacher
[1:51:12] of the message of the hour you really
[1:51:14] got to get down to Serious fasting and
[1:51:18] praying
[1:51:20] because I'm a believer I'm not yet
[1:51:23] converted
[1:51:26] dear amen I believe it but I'm not yet
[1:51:29] converted
[1:51:31] earnest earnest confession is good for
[1:51:33] the
[1:51:36] soul I'm a
[1:51:38] Believer but I'm not yet converted so if
[1:51:42] you want one hour you got to get down to
[1:51:44] fasting and praying you ready got to
[1:51:45] pray say Lord change that
[1:51:50] man are we together now let's let's
[1:51:53] let's look right
[1:51:58] here Ephesians chapter
[1:52:03] 6 verse 10 finally Brethren be strong in
[1:52:07] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:52:09] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[1:52:13] may be able to stand against the wise of
[1:52:16] the devil for We rise up not against
[1:52:18] flesh and blood but against principality
[1:52:21] against against power against rulers of
[1:52:24] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:52:28] wickedness in high places that word high
[1:52:31] places is the same as Heavenly
[1:52:34] places so you see word your blessing is
[1:52:38] is where your battle
[1:52:42] is the enemy attack your spiritual
[1:52:45] position because he knows when you take
[1:52:47] that place with Christ Heaven is your
[1:52:50] God Amen Heaven is open so he fights you
[1:52:54] not to take their
[1:52:58] place God says I give you all spiritual
[1:53:01] blessing in Heavenly places but he also
[1:53:05] says your spiritual wickedness in high
[1:53:12] places praise the Lord
[1:53:16] amen so you see it when John was C
[1:53:20] called to come up higher
[1:53:24] is because he was going to step
[1:53:27] into a further
[1:53:31] Revelation a splendor Revelation
[1:53:34] Revelation chapter 4 right after that
[1:53:36] comes the opening of the
[1:53:38] book think about
[1:53:42] that I'll give you an example and I
[1:53:44] close here if I can close I'll close
[1:53:48] you praise the Lord if I can close I
[1:53:51] will close you
[1:53:53] I told the I told the people last week I
[1:53:55] says please learn to eat a little thing
[1:53:59] before coming to
[1:54:00] church praise the Lord amen don't don't
[1:54:05] don't don't blast your stomach you will
[1:54:07] sleep just get something you know just
[1:54:10] to keep your blood going and uh some it
[1:54:13] keeps you awake because I mean one of
[1:54:15] these days the the Holy Ghost will fall
[1:54:17] and we will not
[1:54:19] leave I mean those that we want to leave
[1:54:22] will leave I mean when when that
[1:54:23] presence fall we will want to enjoy
[1:54:26] it you know it robs us of being time
[1:54:30] conscious so you have to come prepared
[1:54:33] you know snack on a little thing and
[1:54:35] come you know it's
[1:54:36] good it's good now so think about this
[1:54:41] you read the book of Isaiah go home and
[1:54:44] just read the first fiveth chapter in
[1:54:47] the book of Isaiah see how his messages
[1:54:51] were he was talking to the people of
[1:54:54] Israel you know and but Isaiah chapter
[1:54:59] 6 was word he had that visitation of the
[1:55:04] Angel when yuah
[1:55:08] died and he went into the temple and the
[1:55:11] Bible says uh you know he broke into a
[1:55:13] vision and you know he saw the sarapin
[1:55:16] and and know he cried and confessed his
[1:55:18] sin and then God came and touched his
[1:55:20] life look at chapter
[1:55:24] 7 from right then on his ministry
[1:55:28] changed he's no longer into talking
[1:55:32] about Israel
[1:55:33] politics he's talking about a virgin
[1:55:36] shall
[1:55:37] conceive he's looking at 700 years and
[1:55:41] he's
[1:55:46] prophesying why because the experience
[1:55:50] in the temple Has Lifted him up he's
[1:55:53] being lifted out of the
[1:55:59] politics and he's talking about a virgin
[1:56:02] shall conceive and as he goes on he
[1:56:04] talks about the mesiah he talks about
[1:56:07] the
[1:56:13] Millennium that's what happen when the
[1:56:15] believer come up higher yes when we step
[1:56:18] out of our complaints and argument and
[1:56:21] you know and and fusses and excuses and
[1:56:24] just and just step up a little bit the
[1:56:27] platform
[1:56:32] change you start to see things different
[1:56:36] yes and the things that were problem to
[1:56:39] you becomes
[1:56:41] nonsense is it because of this nonsense
[1:56:43] I was doing all of this your eye open
[1:56:46] you start to see things different why
[1:56:48] because you have stepped up a little bit
[1:56:53] just like I said well some water some
[1:56:55] other thing we force out of
[1:56:56] tets squeeze the
[1:57:00] tets pr you you brush your teeth you
[1:57:02] didn't even wash the
[1:57:17] sink the Lord bless you musicians you
[1:57:19] can
[1:57:20] come let me start
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:30] right praise the Lord
[1:57:36] amen but think about
[1:57:38] it think about it how many time we pass
[1:57:43] the open doors that are set before us
[1:57:48] yes how many times God put an Open Door
[1:57:53] and we pass by it an open door to
[1:57:56] testify to
[1:57:57] somebody and we pass by
[1:58:01] it an open door to help
[1:58:05] somebody and we pass by it
[1:58:16] amen how many times
[1:58:20] we instead of stepping in the door we
[1:58:22] snap it
[1:58:25] close because we we become so particular
[1:58:28] about
[1:58:33] ourself someone gave thems for you to be
[1:58:37] here and if you give yourself you could
[1:58:40] help not only
