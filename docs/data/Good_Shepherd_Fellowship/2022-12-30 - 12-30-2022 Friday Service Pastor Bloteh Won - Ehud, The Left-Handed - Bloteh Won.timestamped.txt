[16:33] come here right now to visit
[16:36] we will have a certain Dominion set an
[16:39] attitude a certain dress code
[16:43] but we are children of the king
[16:47] we've come Lord to bring our sacrifice
[16:49] of Prayer
[16:51] and you are the same one that is
[16:53] responsible to accept that sacrifice
[16:55] it's the same one that is willing Lord
[16:57] to cleanse it and accept it
[17:00] what an honor
[17:02] that we can come Lord just as we are
[17:04] trusting your grace of father
[17:07] that we would never leave you the same
[17:10] the prayer of Father for those that are
[17:11] afflicted by the hands of the enemy so
[17:14] am I lying in the hospital
[17:18] are in hunger this moment
[17:21] some will father in diverse conditions
[17:24] but they are all trusting you father

[17:28] this evening we that are healthy
[17:32] we would never forget those who go that
[17:34] are in me of your kindness your healing

[17:49] they told their family that it was going
[17:50] to be back and they never made it back
[17:52] home
[17:54] and here we are father
[17:55] coming from our very homes
[17:58] and we've told friends and family that
[18:00] we will be back and we are trusted that
[18:02] you would take us back
[18:04] the last Friday in the year you brought
[18:07] us a father for January
[18:09] and we are at the end of another year
[18:11] you've taken us part of two different
[18:13] trials and temptation
[18:15] but you've never let us down
[18:17] we are so grateful for that
[18:20] we pray on fire that you would just help
[18:22] us
[18:23] we've come here Lord to see you not to
[18:25] see men
[18:26] we love the fellowship lord well our
[18:28] greatest desire the Lord is to know you
[18:31] in the fullness of your righteousness
[18:36] it's all right to say where can I go
[18:39] when I need a rescue for my soul
[18:42] the neighbors I come
[18:45] and there are friends that I love so
[18:46] deep but Lord where can we go we need
[18:49] rescue for our soul we've come a father
[18:53] in our secret place Lord you say we that
[18:56] do it in the sacred place of the most
[18:57] high they say which I'll buy under the
[18:59] shadow of the Almighty
[19:01] we have come Lord in our secret place
[19:03] this moment

[19:08] Grace to be here and may that Grace Our
[19:11] Father see us through the Lord all our

[19:24] there'd be any doubt in our heart
[19:27] help us Lord
[19:29] you look all over the internet
[19:31] many are debating no father who is
[19:37] and is amazing to see Lord that many
[19:39] years ago we were dependent or we were
[19:42] depending on scholarships
[19:44] and worldly education
[19:46] and we thought they could bring man to a
[19:48] better place
[19:49] but now with those same education Lord
[19:51] May cannot even be able to Define who a
[19:53] woman is
[19:54] what a condition love
[19:57] our children are in schools
[20:01] and we are trusting the school father to
[20:02] educate them
[20:06] what kind of education are they getting
[20:07] today
[20:10] when they cannot be able to
[20:11] differentiate
[20:13] what it meal or a female is
[20:18] and we are afraid to use certain
[20:19] terminology
[20:22] what a condition Lord
[20:24] we are trusting you father
[20:26] because it is you who have made that
[20:28] promise
[20:29] you say Lord those that you have caught
[20:32] those that are your own you will not
[20:34] lose one and that is with that part of
[20:37] promise that we are here today Lord to
[20:40] bring our children our family our
[20:42] relatives our loved ones
[20:48] because we know father you've never
[20:50] failed us
[20:52] when we look back father even throughout
[20:55] this year

[21:04] different turn

[49:35] special
[49:36] service that we call for just a time of
[49:39] prayer a little bit different from our
[49:43] regular
[49:45] uh 31st night service we would have
[49:50] so we trust that the Lord will be able
[49:53] to
[49:54] strengthen each and every one of us
[49:57] tonight I really wanted to
[49:59] to use all the night to sing but I don't
[50:01] have voice
[50:03] praise the Lord
[50:04] I told Brother Harry I was so tired from
[50:07] the services over there in South Africa
[50:10] I don't have message to preach so I was
[50:12] just going to sing sorry I forgot mine
[50:17] my knee a piece
[50:19] I got uh I got in and then uh
[50:25] I realized that a
[50:37] at the last service over in South Africa
[50:41] thank you for your prayers
[50:43] uh keeping us in prayer
[50:48] I was so tired
[50:50] that I taught the services were ending
[50:52] Sunday night so I kind of uphold
[50:56] everything into it then they told me
[50:58] there was another service on Monday
[50:59] morning
[51:00] and I was supposed to fly back
[51:03] uh Monday evening
[51:05] so I just went went back to the hotel I
[51:08] was so tired
[51:10] and uh I was lying down trying to follow
[51:14] the service here at home and then I went
[51:17] into sleep
[51:19] I woke up
[51:21] I watched the last part of the service I
[51:23] lied down
[51:24] and uh
[51:26] I was just trying to get my myself
[51:28] together
[51:31] so I prayed and you know went back to
[51:34] bed I said Lord I uh I just I would just
[51:37] trust you for whatever would happen
[51:39] tomorrow
[51:41] and then when I got on the pulpit yeah
[51:43] for some reason I Was preparing myself
[51:46] in the morning looking over my notes and
[51:49] all of that and then I realized that my
[51:53] iPad did not have power
[51:56] so I was left with uh ten percent power
[52:00] in my upper to preacher one hour 30
[52:03] minute service
[52:06] so when I read
[52:09] up to uh
[52:12] five percent three percent of power
[52:15] I realized that I just have to trust the
[52:17] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to be
[52:19] able to preach the rest of what I was
[52:21] going to preach but the Lord blessed the
[52:24] service amen
[52:25] and then when I got home I thought that
[52:29] uh I would just
[52:31] I would just I won't bother with my iPad
[52:33] I will just power it when I get home so
[52:36] when I get home I just took it from my
[52:39] bed I just power it put it in my bag and
[52:42] uh and kept it
[52:44] so uh I was you know preparing
[52:48] everything
[52:49] and then when I want to take my iPad
[52:52] it can it's it's power power is full but
[52:55] then it can turn on
[52:58] so I say well then I don't know what's
[53:00] going on but uh
[53:02] I just believe that
[53:05] we're going to have a good time tonight
[53:06] amen
[53:10] praise the Lord so I well I just thought
[53:14] okay I will leave it for a while so I
[53:16] left it
[53:17] all through the dead and I was kind of
[53:20] preparing myself
[53:21] and uh
[53:24] I got to the house and I just try to
[53:26] power it on it's it's coming on but it's
[53:29] just not turning on I said well okay
[53:31] uh
[53:33] well that uh
[53:35] those Electronics they are very limited
[53:37] amen but the holy spirit is not limited
[53:40] amen
[53:42] so we have a little thought we want to
[53:45] share with you tonight but before we get
[53:48] into that
[53:49] uh we just we just uh
[53:53] tell you that we had a we had a good
[53:55] good service the Lord really blessed the
[53:58] meeting in uh in a special way
[54:01] and in an extraordinary way
[54:05] so it was it was really really a
[54:08] blessing and I mean just like brother
[54:11] brother ajaro was sharing his testimony
[54:14] of him coming here uh on the weekend and
[54:18] everything that was happening with the
[54:20] weather and the flight we had a little
[54:22] bit of that before we left we sat down
[54:25] at the airport for about two three hours
[54:28] trying to watch and see how the weather
[54:30] would go
[54:34] for some reason the brothers got the
[54:37] the flight schedule a bit wrong so they
[54:41] were already at the airport while we
[54:43] were here at the airport sitting in the
[54:45] planes seeing if we would leave they
[54:47] were at the airport they were waiting
[54:49] for us
[54:51] so then
[54:53] uh Pastor Lockheed Anthony call and said
[54:56] brother one where are you I see I'm in
[54:58] Minneapolis
[55:00] says are you now on the flight yet I'm
[55:03] sitting on the flight brother but uh
[55:05] it's not going anywhere until they can
[55:07] be able to clear the weather and make
[55:09] sure that we are gone so we sat there
[55:12] but the Lord was able to have us to
[55:14] leave and we left
[55:17] and then we took off and go to New
[55:21] Jersey and then it was now another 13
[55:24] hours flight so he told me he said text
[55:27] me and let me know when your flight take
[55:30] off
[55:31] we we're really pray for the miracle
[55:33] because I don't have no plan B
[55:36] I said well okay
[55:39] but I got so tired that I fell asleep
[55:41] and and I forgot to text him so he don't
[55:44] know where I'm coming and uh
[55:48] so when I got to Johannesburg we send
[55:50] him a text and let him know that we were
[55:53] there he didn't responded
[55:57] and then I call him
[55:59] the funny thing there he told me he says
[56:01] when you told me you were staying in
[56:03] Minneapolis I felt sick
[56:06] hit
[56:07] because I was just thinking what are we
[56:09] going to do after the covet and
[56:12] everything they never had a meeting so
[56:15] this meeting was going to be one of
[56:16] their big meetings they were going to
[56:18] have
[56:19] so the real report put time into it one
[56:22] of the young Brothers here uh uh erected
[56:26] a Convention Center that has been up to
[56:30] about
[56:32] some 4 million Reigns to put up
[56:36] for their meetings and for other
[56:38] meetings that they would like to have so
[56:40] there was just a lot that went into the
[56:42] little meeting
[56:44] but the law was was very very gracious
[56:47] you know brother Brandon says when we
[56:49] sacrifice
[56:50] he says God bless what God bless is the
[56:53] sacrifice amen and I believe what God
[56:56] will bless tonight is the sacrifice that
[56:58] you have made to be here
[57:00] it's not the preacher it's not the
[57:03] singer it's the sacrifice that you have
[57:05] placed on the altar tonight
[57:07] that's what God is going to bless praise
[57:10] the Lord
[57:11] so uh the order of the service tonight
[57:14] we will we will bring you a little word
[57:17] of encouragement but we will really want
[57:20] to spend some time in praying that's
[57:22] what I wanted this meeting tonight
[57:24] so we will pray and pray for different
[57:27] needs and and uh
[57:30] if you have a special burden prayer
[57:33] request that you didn't give to the
[57:35] victims you can write it and give it to
[57:36] them we'll pray for different families

[57:49] also we will give
[57:52] time for those that want to testify

[1:02:49] praise the Lord let's take our Bibles
[1:02:54] praise the Lord
[1:02:59] let's go to the Book of Judges tonight
[1:03:13] I might be able to share some few things
[1:03:17] I took place during the meetings uh this
[1:03:20] gone weekend
[1:03:21] but one of the outstanding things that
[1:03:23] took place was uh
[1:03:27] and more on the field
[1:03:35] praise the Lord
[1:03:37] let's read the scripture then then we
[1:03:39] will
[1:03:42] we will
[1:03:44] Judges chapter 3
[1:03:59] .
[1:04:01] I had this thought of mine on my heart
[1:04:05] when I was thinking about this meeting
[1:04:07] I was actually going to speak on Courage
[1:04:12] I wanted to talk on Courage
[1:04:15] how fake is is courage
[1:04:18] that's what I was going to speak on
[1:04:21] but then thinking about courage I was
[1:04:23] thinking to to actually
[1:04:25] speak from the book of
[1:04:28] judges to realize the different
[1:04:31] characters that God used during the Book
[1:04:34] of Judges
[1:04:36] and ah
[1:04:39] which of course it shows how God can use
[1:04:44] his people when they make themselves
[1:04:47] available
[1:04:48] because most of the people that God used
[1:04:51] in the Book of Judges they were not
[1:04:52] expecting
[1:04:54] that God would use them
[1:04:57] praise the Lord
[1:04:58] so I I thought about that I was I was
[1:05:01] thinking about this
[1:05:02] and then while I was reading through the
[1:05:06] Book of Judges there was of this uh the
[1:05:09] strange character that we're going to
[1:05:11] read about tonight caught my attention
[1:05:14] so when I went back and started looking
[1:05:17] at my notes that I want to use tonight I
[1:05:21] realized that I preached this message in
[1:05:24] this church 10 years ago
[1:05:29] the date says May 11.
[1:05:32] 2010
[1:05:34] that was that was the last time I
[1:05:36] preached this particular subject not the
[1:05:39] message because there is no message that
[1:05:41] is typically preached the same
[1:05:43] but I preach on this subject 10 years
[1:05:45] ago in this church so I don't know how
[1:05:48] it's going to be tonight
[1:05:50] praise the Lord so let's read from
[1:05:52] judges chapter
[1:05:55] three I couldn't believe in myself when
[1:05:57] I went back and and look at the data I
[1:06:00] said wow
[1:06:01] uh that's that's a long time
[1:06:04] Judges chapter 3.
[1:06:12] let's read from verse 13.
[1:06:17] all like it was always said from verse
[1:06:20] 12 and the children of Israel did Evil
[1:06:22] again in the sight of the Lord
[1:06:25] and the law strengthened eglon the king
[1:06:28] of more against Israel because they had
[1:06:32] done evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:06:36] and he gathered unto him the children of
[1:06:39] armor and amalek and went and smart
[1:06:42] Israel and possess
[1:06:44] the city of palm trees
[1:06:48] and the children of Israel serve eglon
[1:06:51] the king of more 18 years
[1:06:55] and when the children of Israel cry unto
[1:06:58] the Lord
[1:07:00] the Lord raised them up a deliverer
[1:07:03] Edward the son of giram a benjamite
[1:07:07] a man left-handed
[1:07:10] so many years ago I preached on the
[1:07:13] message at who the left-handed man
[1:07:16] but we want to look at it a bit
[1:07:17] different tonight
[1:07:19] Benji married a man left-handed and by
[1:07:23] him the children of Israel
[1:07:25] sin and presented unto Eglin the king of
[1:07:28] more
[1:07:30] but Heir who made him a begum which
[1:07:34] which had two edges
[1:07:37] of a cubit length and he did try Gail it
[1:07:41] under his upon his right time
[1:07:50] and he brought the presence onto Eglin
[1:07:53] the king of more
[1:07:55] and their ground was a very fat man
[1:07:58] and when he had made an end to offer the
[1:08:02] present he sent away the people that
[1:08:06] bear the presence
[1:08:09] they just by our hairs and pray tonight
[1:08:12] and then we will continue our reading
[1:08:13] Heavenly Father
[1:08:15] almighty God we We Gather here tonight
[1:08:18] precious Lord
[1:08:20] realizing oh God we have this night
[1:08:24] going into the last date of the year
[1:08:28] and so father we we just we just taught
[1:08:32] to set this time aside
[1:08:34] as a church and your people that have
[1:08:36] come together tonight no doubt they have
[1:08:39] there are many laws that are streaming
[1:08:42] into the service tonight and father also
[1:08:45] precious Lord Jesus those that travel
[1:08:48] and some have to work Lord father
[1:08:51] they're unable to be here tonight dear

[1:08:59] that are with us Lord even though their

[1:09:06] the Lord God you will bless us together
[1:09:08] father bless us together as we want to
[1:09:11] make this time just a time of dedication
[1:09:14] Lord not after the traditional last
[1:09:18] service of the year but father a time
[1:09:21] that we just want to pull ourselves
[1:09:23] together we want to take an inventory of
[1:09:26] precious Lord and father we want to put

[1:10:16] in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:10:20] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:10:22] your seat
[1:10:25] so as uh as I said or I was saying
[1:10:30] one of the outstanding things that took
[1:10:32] place in the meetings there in South
[1:10:34] Africa
[1:10:38] on Sunday morning I taught to preach a
[1:10:41] message I preached the same message she
[1:10:42] had in a different way but I preached a
[1:10:45] message on the Rachel weeping for her
[1:10:47] children which of course was my
[1:10:49] Christmas message here but I was taking
[1:10:52] it from the place of looking at God
[1:10:55] giving his people the promise
[1:10:58] and then all of those women in the
[1:11:01] lineage of the Patriot Abraham and and
[1:11:04] in his group and how Sarah was Byron and
[1:11:07] Rachel was burying uh Rebecca was
[1:11:09] barring and they were all out of uh
[1:11:12] those uh uh Hebrew mothers but then when
[1:11:16] he came to the Gentile women we saw how
[1:11:19] Sarah had to bring Hagar in uh to help
[1:11:23] the promise uh Rachel have to bring
[1:11:26] bihal in to help the promise and they
[1:11:28] were all Gentile women you know so we
[1:11:31] talked about that thought and we will we
[1:11:34] were actually talking about why God uh
[1:11:37] what what seems like a hidden thought in
[1:11:40] God's mind when he allowed barrenness
[1:11:43] even though he promises people that
[1:11:45] there will be no Barren among them but
[1:11:48] God Allah barrenness we spoke the same
[1:11:50] year so I was talking on that uh on on a
[1:11:55] Sunday morning
[1:11:57] and now with some of the supporting
[1:11:59] churches that came for the meeting we
[1:12:01] were a little over the thousand two
[1:12:04] thousand people
[1:12:05] and uh uh some of them drove from out of
[1:12:10] time so one of the drivers that brought
[1:12:12] some of this group of people they came
[1:12:14] from Kimberling is one of the the gold
[1:12:18] mining city in South Africa
[1:12:20] and uh the pastor retired Pastor there
[1:12:25] Owen Palm asked me to greet the church
[1:12:27] and many of the other brothers so uh
[1:12:31] they they rented some buses and you know
[1:12:34] to drive the people down so uh the
[1:12:38] drivers who stay you know and wait after
[1:12:41] the meetings and take the people back so
[1:12:43] one of the drivers was hanging out in in
[1:12:46] his vehicle around the the facility so
[1:12:50] he was just sitting and trying to listen
[1:12:52] to the meeting and while I was uh you
[1:12:56] know preaching I started to talk about
[1:12:59] uh I felt uh during the preaching that
[1:13:03] almost at the end I just felt something
[1:13:05] to to
[1:13:07] um uh dedicate the last part of the
[1:13:10] service to the young people you know so
[1:13:13] I started talking about Rachel weeping
[1:13:16] for her children how
[1:13:19] if there is one crowd that is heard
[1:13:21] around the message is parents crying for
[1:13:24] their children to have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:25] you know parents crying for their
[1:13:27] children to come back and serve the Lord
[1:13:29] so I took that as a type of Rachel
[1:13:31] weeping for her children and then I
[1:13:34] started talking about uh you know how
[1:13:37] Moses got so concerned about his
[1:13:40] commission and then he forgot about the
[1:13:42] coveting and sometimes that's what
[1:13:44] happened you know we as fathers we get
[1:13:47] so concerned about paying the bills and
[1:13:49] and the needs of the home and we have to
[1:13:52] work and in order that and sometimes we
[1:13:55] we we we it's almost like an oversight
[1:13:59] is almost like it's in our blind spot
[1:14:02] and then we get consumed by there by
[1:14:06] those needs and sometimes we thought we
[1:14:09] we forsake our children and sometimes
[1:14:11] even even as as preachers you know when
[1:14:15] we want to go out and win win the whole
[1:14:18] world you know we talk a little bit
[1:14:20] about that yeah
[1:14:21] so I was dealing with that and I started
[1:14:23] talking a little bit on family life you
[1:14:26] know uh you know husband and wife and
[1:14:29] this particular driver
[1:14:31] he was telling one of the brothers where
[1:14:33] I turned out to be one of the ministers
[1:14:35] that hired him
[1:14:37] he was saying that he left Kimberling
[1:14:41] with uh with his house in trouble and he
[1:14:45] and his wife were going through you know
[1:14:47] some some home strife and they were
[1:14:50] having some confusion and they were
[1:14:53] right on the brink of a divorce
[1:14:56] and his mind was he was going to make
[1:14:58] this trip to Johannesburg or actually
[1:15:02] the uh the meeting was in Pretoria it's
[1:15:06] going to make this trip over to Pretoria
[1:15:08] and then after the meeting whatever
[1:15:10] money he was going to raise he was going
[1:15:12] to put in a divorce
[1:15:15] so uh I didn't know nothing about it and
[1:15:18] we were we were we were just we're just
[1:15:20] preaching whatever the law put on our
[1:15:22] heart I don't know what God took from
[1:15:25] that meeting
[1:15:26] and there with that man sitting in the
[1:15:29] bus as he was listening
[1:15:31] so while he came after that he told the
[1:15:34] brother he says he says he says I never
[1:15:38] told you what I was dealing with so
[1:15:40] there is no way I can believe that you
[1:15:43] told that preacher
[1:15:44] what I was dealing with because I never
[1:15:47] told you
[1:15:48] he says but everything that that man is
[1:15:51] saying on that Pope
[1:15:53] is exactly what I'm dealing with in my
[1:15:55] home
[1:15:57] he said let me tell you I came here just
[1:16:00] to raise money and end my divorce
[1:16:03] he says but I think I'm leaving from
[1:16:06] here like a brand new man I'm going to
[1:16:08] get my wife we're going to sit down and
[1:16:12] we're going to suck our problem out
[1:16:14] [Laughter]
[1:16:17] oh praise the lord well all the glory be
[1:16:20] to glory amen amen we'll bring the rest
[1:16:23] of the the testimony to you on Sunday
[1:16:25] let's get into what we want to do
[1:16:28] tonight tonight it's a serious business
[1:16:29] amen we we are denying our self-sleep
[1:16:33] and rest tonight because we we want to
[1:16:36] nail this devil down tonight amen yeah
[1:16:39] when you want to nail this devil down
[1:16:41] because we are trusting God to go into
[1:16:44] into a year
[1:16:46] of a favor and Grace and all the things
[1:16:50] that God will will bless us with praise
[1:16:53] the Lord
[1:16:55] now so just like I said
[1:16:58] there's another scripture that I want to
[1:17:00] read sorry I have my phone on the
[1:17:02] airplane mode on iPad couldn't come on
[1:17:05] so I'll use my phone tonight
[1:17:07] praise the Lord
[1:17:08] and uh
[1:17:12] are we together
[1:17:14] okay
[1:17:24] let's turn to uh First Corinthians
[1:17:27] chapter 12.
[1:17:31] First Corinthians chapter 12. that's
[1:17:33] that's another scripture that I wanted
[1:17:35] to read tonight
[1:17:47] man I'm telling you those South Africans
[1:17:51] like in their own words you know they
[1:17:54] say they can abuse preacher they really
[1:17:55] abuse my body they mean
[1:17:58] praise the Lord
[1:18:00] he really really abused my body I took
[1:18:04] five Services out of six
[1:18:08] so you know that I'm really
[1:18:10] I'm really burned out but uh we're going
[1:18:13] to trust the Lord
[1:18:17] let's let's turn into First Corinthians
[1:18:19] chapter 12.
[1:18:29] let's read from verse 23 First
[1:18:32] Corinthians chapter 12 reading from
[1:18:34] verse 23.
[1:18:37] and those members of the body which we
[1:18:40] think to be less honorable
[1:18:44] praise the Lord
[1:18:47] upon this we be so more abundant honor
[1:18:53] and our uncomplied parts
[1:18:56] have more abundant complete comeliness
[1:19:01] for our calmly paths have no need
[1:19:04] but God
[1:19:08] have tempered the body together
[1:19:11] having given more abundant honor
[1:19:15] to that part which like
[1:19:19] that there should be no sarcasm in the
[1:19:22] body
[1:19:23] but that the members should have the
[1:19:27] same care one for another
[1:19:31] just uh yesterday
[1:19:34] and uh
[1:19:38] yes yesterday I was over at the hospital
[1:19:43] and uh in the morning
[1:19:45] there was a
[1:19:48] um I'm down in in surgery
[1:19:52] and there was one of the patients there
[1:19:56] there
[1:19:57] with everything said and done that was
[1:19:59] going to give uh
[1:20:04] their body parts for
[1:20:06] uh for to donate their body parts and
[1:20:10] what
[1:20:11] they would normally do in the hospital
[1:20:12] is there they will have a you know a
[1:20:15] kind of a parade they will parade the
[1:20:18] person through the hospital and then all
[1:20:22] the hospital staffs will just land on
[1:20:24] both sides of the wall
[1:20:25] you know when it's a way to to tell the
[1:20:29] person thank you for giving life you
[1:20:32] know because uh uh either
[1:20:35] you know they will not survive their
[1:20:38] surgery or they are in a state that they
[1:20:41] will not come out of and they have
[1:20:43] decided to give you know some of the
[1:20:46] organs for people that are in need
[1:20:49] so we were there engine that after
[1:20:52] having the meeting and then right there
[1:20:55] the uh
[1:20:57] you know we were told that they were
[1:21:00] going to have that right in the in right
[1:21:03] down in the surgery area
[1:21:06] so I it's it's it's a it's a thing that
[1:21:09] I've uh you know I've really been uh
[1:21:13] I've seen a couple of times really did
[1:21:16] not understand what it was uh in the
[1:21:19] time that I will understand it
[1:21:21] uh uh was was just around the time we
[1:21:24] were we were believing God for uh sister
[1:21:30] and uh and the amazing thing was the
[1:21:33] other I was in the hospital again when
[1:21:36] the very person that was paraded was
[1:21:39] going to be the one that uh uh you know
[1:21:42] blessed our sister with the liver
[1:21:45] so uh uh but what brings that to my mind
[1:21:50] tonight for me to say they are not to
[1:21:52] put you into a side state
[1:21:56] but what brings that to my mind is
[1:21:59] because it's one of those uncommonly
[1:22:01] parts of our body
[1:22:04] you don't see it you know you don't see
[1:22:06] the liver we don't see the heart we know
[1:22:08] we have a heart we know we have a liver
[1:22:10] we know we have those organs in our body
[1:22:14] you know uh yet with these parts of our
[1:22:18] body that we see and we pour great honor
[1:22:21] on we want a good haircut you know we
[1:22:24] yeah you know we we get to the salon to
[1:22:27] do our heading and the different things
[1:22:30] that we do with this part of our body
[1:22:33] that we do see we put a whole lot of our
[1:22:36] Honor on it you know but those are
[1:22:41] uncommonly parts of our body that's what
[1:22:44] Paul is kind of for talking about here
[1:22:46] is using the human body as a type of how
[1:22:51] the body of the church is praise the
[1:22:54] Lord so what may seem as a weak part of
[1:22:57] the body God greatly esteem it amen
[1:23:03] in the very same chapter here Paul will
[1:23:06] let us know that God you know uh the
[1:23:10] weak part of the body is very necessary
[1:23:12] to God so if there is if there is one
[1:23:15] that is state is that is still
[1:23:17] struggling in faith and uh you know
[1:23:19] having having you know uh things that
[1:23:22] they are dealing with in their life you
[1:23:24] are you are very much necessary praise
[1:23:26] the Lord because I'm telling you if we
[1:23:28] all were perfect we would not have to be
[1:23:30] here
[1:23:31] praise the Lord there will be a rapture
[1:23:33] we will be gone the reason why there is
[1:23:36] a church on Earth is to be able to have
[1:23:38] the weak ones brother Brown said that
[1:23:40] was the reason why the the the the Ted
[1:23:44] pool was giving
[1:23:45] he said the temple was giving for the
[1:23:47] weak ones praise the Lord so I mean you
[1:23:50] strong ones you are already raptured you
[1:23:52] are in the Rapture you know you get FFA
[1:23:55] we the weak ones we will hold to the
[1:23:57] temple and God will bring us through
[1:24:00] praise the Lord so I want to talk about
[1:24:02] a character tonight
[1:24:04] I want to talk about a character lately
[1:24:07] when I was standing on this character
[1:24:09] that we just read about in uh Judges
[1:24:13] chapter 3.
[1:24:15] there was a portion there that kind of
[1:24:17] blew my mind
[1:24:19] and uh and that's what I want to bring
[1:24:22] to you tonight so I pray that the Lord
[1:24:25] will
[1:24:27] will just bless the thought
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:32] I pray that the Lord will just Bless The
[1:24:35] Talk The Bible says over here in uh
[1:24:37] Judges chapter 3
[1:24:40] verse 15 but when the children of Israel
[1:24:43] cry unto the Lord I wish we would do the
[1:24:45] same tonight we live for our voice and
[1:24:48] cry unto the Lord amen the Lord raised
[1:24:51] up a deliverer
[1:24:53] and hold the son of jira and Benjamin a
[1:24:58] man left handed
[1:25:01] praise the Lord
[1:25:03] a man left-handed
[1:25:07] now I was reading something here in my
[1:25:10] notes if uh if the
[1:25:14] our sisters will be able to to help us
[1:25:17] uh back there
[1:25:20] let me let me get it here
[1:25:24] but bam says in the message why Christ
[1:25:26] speak
[1:25:28] he said many times when you look at the
[1:25:31] scripture
[1:25:32] in our own way of looking it seems very
[1:25:36] hard
[1:25:38] but if we but if
[1:25:43] if we study it a little while
[1:25:46] we will find out that the all-wise God
[1:25:50] knows
[1:25:51] just what he's doing
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:56] and he knows how to do these things
[1:26:00] and how to deal with men
[1:26:04] he knows what he meant
[1:26:08] he knows him we done
[1:26:11] he we only know from the intellectual
[1:26:15] standpoint amen the intellectual side
[1:26:19] he knows what really in a man
[1:26:23] praise the Lord so when we look at this
[1:26:26] read the scripture
[1:26:28] you know and local in our own way
[1:26:31] sometimes it's hard and then uh
[1:26:35] uh when that when I read the scripture
[1:26:37] back before or speak on this subject uh
[1:26:41] a brother one time uh uh I took the
[1:26:44] thoughts from my brother one time he was
[1:26:46] saying you know God was so mindful of us
[1:26:50] in this age
[1:26:51] that he give brother Brandon the salmon
[1:26:54] based on left-handedness
[1:26:57] because brother Brandon preached a
[1:26:59] message letting off the pressure
[1:27:02] because of a well-be gun
[1:27:05] that was given to Billy Paul
[1:27:08] and the gun was a left-handed gun
[1:27:13] praise the Lord
[1:27:15] so brother Brian was going to refurbish
[1:27:17] the gun rebuild the gun to to be a
[1:27:21] right-handed gun so he can he can be
[1:27:24] able to use it to to hunt and it makes
[1:27:27] the gun to blow off there was so much
[1:27:30] pressure that was put in the gum that it
[1:27:33] blew up so it was from there that
[1:27:35] brother Branham preached a message
[1:27:36] letting off the pressure so this brother
[1:27:39] was saying that God was so mindful of
[1:27:42] left-handed people
[1:27:45] that he had to create a situation with a
[1:27:49] well a big gun for brother Brandon to
[1:27:51] preach a message just from that
[1:27:53] standpoint so that that got stuck in my
[1:27:56] mind and I realized there was somewhere
[1:27:58] in the Bible that he talks about
[1:27:59] left-handed so I said well I'll go on
[1:28:01] the hunt and build a message at that
[1:28:04] time but this time it's a little bit
[1:28:06] different
[1:28:07] because when you study the scripture and
[1:28:11] you go back into the history of this
[1:28:14] he was now on it left-handed
[1:28:18] but he was handicapped
[1:28:28] he was now only left-handed
[1:28:30] but he was handicapped
[1:28:33] and that is and that is the part of the
[1:28:36] the scripture that counted for that kind
[1:28:39] of blew my mind
[1:28:45] and it's and you if you also runs
[1:28:47] through the message you realize that
[1:28:48] Broadband never preached on this
[1:28:50] character
[1:28:51] he never preached on the character so
[1:28:53] you're not going to find a quote what
[1:28:55] better brand use this character but
[1:28:57] we're going to read a few quotes tonight
[1:29:00] that will still keep us in the context
[1:29:02] of the message amen
[1:29:04] I will still keep us in the context of
[1:29:06] the message
[1:29:09] what's strange enough is that when you
[1:29:11] come down to the end
[1:29:13] of the tear chapter the last verse in
[1:29:17] the third chapter which of course it was
[1:29:19] only one verse one verse in the Bible
[1:29:21] about this God shame God
[1:29:24] that's the one that brother Brown
[1:29:25] mentioned but Brown speaks few things uh
[1:29:28] through the message about shame God but
[1:29:30] he did not mention anything about uh uh
[1:29:33] uh at home so we want to trust the Holy
[1:29:36] Spirit tonight and and look into this we
[1:29:40] want to look into it a little bit
[1:29:42] if you remember while we were talking
[1:29:45] about uh the harmony between the father
[1:29:48] and the son when I was dealing with uh
[1:29:51] David and Saul I mentioned something
[1:29:54] about uh uh sword and Saul was a
[1:29:58] benjamite
[1:30:00] and there was something unique about the
[1:30:02] benjamites
[1:30:04] the benjamites in the Bible
[1:30:07] the Bible says that they were
[1:30:09] left-handed
[1:30:11] the Bible mentioned that the Benjamin
[1:30:13] were left-handed
[1:30:15] but it it turned out to be that they
[1:30:18] were either left-handed or they were
[1:30:19] Ambi ambidextrous they could use both
[1:30:22] hands
[1:30:23] you know there was something that was
[1:30:26] very very uh peculiar with the
[1:30:28] benjamites
[1:30:30] they were they were they were they were
[1:30:33] there were men that were also very
[1:30:36] skilled
[1:30:38] in using the ball
[1:30:40] praise the Lord the benjamites were very
[1:30:44] very skilled using the board
[1:30:48] praise the Lord
[1:30:50] so uh
[1:30:52] you we will realize that
[1:30:55] uh
[1:30:57] uh and and and just before I came uh as
[1:31:01] as I was home in and I was looking
[1:31:03] through this
[1:31:06] there is there's there's another part of
[1:31:09] uh my notes that uh I couldn't I
[1:31:12] couldn't Trace back up in my icon
[1:31:15] I did a a kind of a research on on
[1:31:19] left-handed many years ago when I was
[1:31:22] studying this
[1:31:24] there are a few
[1:31:26] uh a few of the word uh percentage of
[1:31:30] people that are left-handed
[1:31:33] and uh
[1:31:40] so I decided to just go back in and uh
[1:31:43] and just make some few few research uh
[1:31:47] you know on on we will not go into the
[1:31:50] science of of all of that tonight but it
[1:31:53] is just it is proving that uh there is
[1:31:57] there is certain skill set that comes
[1:31:59] with the left-handed people
[1:32:01] proving that you know certain skill set
[1:32:04] that comes to them and uh
[1:32:08] uh you I mean you can see a big part of
[1:32:11] that in sports uh
[1:32:13] those that were left-handed uh became
[1:32:16] one of the world's best boxer tennis
[1:32:19] player
[1:32:20] and even in all line of sports
[1:32:24] they have they have a certain skill set
[1:32:27] even though they are it's very small
[1:32:30] group of people that uh that are
[1:32:33] left-handed and I mean there is there is
[1:32:36] just a lot of signs a lot of reasoning
[1:32:38] around the whole left-handed thing but
[1:32:42] we will not will not make that you know
[1:32:45] a kind of a big issue tonight we just
[1:32:48] want to go and and go right into the
[1:32:51] inspiration of what God was doing here
[1:32:53] praise the Lord I want to go right into
[1:32:56] the inspiration of what the Lord was
[1:32:58] doing and why and what he want to grab
[1:33:01] our attention on
[1:33:03] so uh let's look I think there's a
[1:33:07] scripture here that really brings there
[1:33:09] out
[1:33:11] let's look in first Chronicles chapter
[1:33:13] 12.
[1:33:18] let's look in first Chronicle chapter
[1:33:20] 12.
[1:33:51] first Chronicle chapter 12 we'll read
[1:33:53] from verse 1 now these a day that came
[1:33:56] to David
[1:33:59] why he yet kept himself close
[1:34:03] because of Saul the son of Keith
[1:34:06] and they were among the Mighty Men
[1:34:09] helpers of the war
[1:34:12] they were armed with boats they could
[1:34:15] use both the right hand and the left
[1:34:19] hand
[1:34:20] hurting stones and shooting arrows out
[1:34:23] of the ball
[1:34:25] even of sore brethrens the benjamites
[1:34:29] praise the Lord
[1:34:31] so it was something that was uh that was
[1:34:34] very you know that was very peculiar of
[1:34:37] the benjamites you know they were they
[1:34:40] were they were you know
[1:34:42] uh I think also if you look in George's
[1:34:46] chapter 20 you know it's also mentioned
[1:34:49] there uh about these men's you know
[1:34:52] being being left-handed but yeah the
[1:34:54] Bible says they were using both left
[1:34:56] hand and right hand and uh they were
[1:34:59] they were they were Hollows of stones
[1:35:01] and that that that uh I mean that that
[1:35:04] mean how how they control you know how
[1:35:07] they could throw their stones and they
[1:35:09] were also people that were good in
[1:35:12] shooting bow and arrow if you remember
[1:35:14] David told journey to and he says I
[1:35:17] think uh your father David have an ought
[1:35:20] against me
[1:35:22] Johnny don't say how how I mean why
[1:35:24] would my dad want is looking for your
[1:35:26] life David said let's not make an
[1:35:28] argument argument about it but I would
[1:35:30] not be at the feast tonight you go to
[1:35:33] the feast
[1:35:34] and you just tell you know look at the
[1:35:37] the atmosphere when it is truth should
[1:35:40] mean
[1:35:42] an arrow
[1:35:44] you know and David told journey to where
[1:35:47] he will be
[1:35:48] you know so Jonathan Wayne sat at the
[1:35:51] face and and uh Saul realized that David
[1:35:54] was not there he got angry journey to
[1:35:57] knew that what David was saying was it
[1:35:59] was true he came out he took his board
[1:36:02] he was able to shoot for it to learn
[1:36:04] exactly to where David was so that was
[1:36:07] just how you know that that was how
[1:36:09] these Benjamins were they were very good
[1:36:11] people that could that could shoot the
[1:36:13] ball amen
[1:36:15] I wanna that's not why God took the
[1:36:18] first is Messenger to be a Vegemite Paul
[1:36:22] was a benjamite remember he was saw
[1:36:27] he was a benjamite
[1:36:29] so he could he could also shoot shoot
[1:36:32] the arrow of the word amen
[1:36:35] praise the Lord he could also shoot the
[1:36:37] arrow of the word I'm trying to kind of
[1:36:40] for uh uh deal with my nervousness
[1:36:42] tonight uh
[1:36:46] yeah there were some things that I laid
[1:36:49] in my notes I can ask us tonight so I'm
[1:36:52] just trying to you know free myself from
[1:36:56] from my own trouble praise the Lord
[1:36:59] and uh
[1:37:02] like I said I was thinking on speaking
[1:37:05] on Courage
[1:37:06] to look up the different men that God
[1:37:09] used
[1:37:11] in the Book of Judges
[1:37:13] you can you can think about it uh you
[1:37:17] know the book judges
[1:37:21] out of out of the the
[1:37:24] Hebrew
[1:37:27] the the book actually means deliver is
[1:37:31] speaking about people that God raised at
[1:37:34] a setting point of time to deliver his
[1:37:36] people
[1:37:38] it's not George is in a sense of in a
[1:37:40] way that we will understand judges in in
[1:37:43] the English sense but it means that God
[1:37:46] raised these men up and uh and and after
[1:37:49] they deliver the people they judge them
[1:37:52] they'll the the you know the rule over
[1:37:54] them for the period of time until you
[1:37:57] know the people went back into their
[1:37:59] problem but uh just like I said if you
[1:38:02] look through the scripture and you you
[1:38:03] read the Book of Judges you see the
[1:38:05] character of the other people that God
[1:38:08] used in this kind of a situation there
[1:38:11] is one thing that was that was uh uh
[1:38:14] outstanding in this book when you read
[1:38:17] the Bible says there was no prophet
[1:38:22] so every man bit
[1:38:25] what
[1:38:26] was right
[1:38:28] in their own eyes
[1:38:30] praise the Lord
[1:38:31] now uh I mean with the age and time that
[1:38:36] we are living and we can we can compare
[1:38:38] that and says well we are almost in this
[1:38:41] in the same uh state of time where
[1:38:44] everybody is doing you know what is
[1:38:46] right in their own eyes but it should
[1:38:48] not be the same with you and myself
[1:38:51] praise the Lord because we don't have a
[1:38:55] prophet as a man here we fast but we are
[1:38:57] following the prophet message
[1:39:00] praise the Lord so we must never be able
[1:39:04] to uh uh just do the things that we
[1:39:07] think is right in our eyes the reason
[1:39:09] why God sent us a prophet is to give us
[1:39:12] instruction how to do things
[1:39:16] because if it is just left with us I
[1:39:19] mean we will do things uh uh and
[1:39:21] sometimes those things that we would do
[1:39:23] they would be to our own hurt
[1:39:25] you know so that's one of the things
[1:39:28] that stands out in the Book of Judges
[1:39:31] but with the character of this man if
[1:39:34] you if you follow the reading and you
[1:39:37] you realize that uh
[1:39:39] the Bible says when he was going down to
[1:39:42] the king of Moab
[1:39:44] he took a digger
[1:39:46] now he placed it on his right side
[1:39:53] and what actually he did was he put it
[1:39:57] in a way that it looks like a right hand
[1:40:03] foreign
[1:40:08] you think about it he's going toward the
[1:40:12] king of more the people that is ruling
[1:40:15] over them
[1:40:17] for 18 years
[1:40:21] praise the Lord
[1:40:23] amen
[1:40:25] you know that in the day of the Soul
[1:40:28] when man fought with swore
[1:40:30] uh
[1:40:32] if a man was right-handed he put his
[1:40:35] sword on his left side
[1:40:38] because that was the way he would take
[1:40:40] it out and then he will fight
[1:40:46] so he put the Digger
[1:40:48] on his right side
[1:40:51] but I believe he did it in such a way
[1:40:55] that he could put his Rob on it
[1:40:58] now he was going to meet the leader of
[1:41:01] the Moab
[1:41:02] you think about it picture it in your
[1:41:04] mind the least mistake
[1:41:07] that the armies the God and the people
[1:41:10] around the king will realize that this
[1:41:13] man had a weapon
[1:41:18] praise the Lord
[1:41:20] so just put it in the context of a
[1:41:23] picture in your mind the least mistake
[1:41:26] that he they will they will detect that
[1:41:29] he had a weapon on him
[1:41:31] that was going to cause his life
[1:41:35] praise the Lord
[1:41:37] my brother Branham says something here
[1:41:45] total Deliverance
[1:41:47] he said when God sent a man to do
[1:41:50] anything
[1:41:51] God completely equipped him
[1:41:55] with everything
[1:41:57] that he has need off
[1:42:02] praise the Lord
[1:42:03] praise the Lord you think about it now
[1:42:06] when you think about God equipping a man
[1:42:11] it's easier for us to think about giving
[1:42:14] him you know uh uh all the the physical
[1:42:18] ability and giving him all the but what
[1:42:22] I want to bring to to you uh uh uh this
[1:42:26] evening is there in uh money even made
[1:42:30] clear by prophecy but Abraham says that
[1:42:32] God designed his man he gave them their
[1:42:36] nature
[1:42:38] he gave them their nature the very
[1:42:40] nature that they have
[1:42:43] he also gave them the attendance saying
[1:42:47] he placed certain weaknesses in their
[1:42:50] lives
[1:42:52] that he God is going to use
[1:42:57] a man here whichever way that he became
[1:43:01] handicapped
[1:43:03] that uh you know uh the history would
[1:43:07] say
[1:43:08] actually in in Hebrew the brother are
[1:43:11] very beautiful
[1:43:13] whichever way whether it was by accident
[1:43:16] or he was born that way but yet
[1:43:20] it was a way that God
[1:43:25] designed him to be equipped
[1:43:29] if he had two Flying Hands like you and
[1:43:32] myself
[1:43:33] where was he going to hide that digger
[1:43:37] I'm sure God was was going to use some
[1:43:40] other way to inspire him
[1:43:43] to be able to bring Deliverance
[1:43:47] to his people
[1:43:50] so when God sent a man
[1:43:53] he equipped the man
[1:43:57] the way that we think of a man being
[1:44:00] equipped that's not the same way that
[1:44:02] God thinks
[1:44:04] praise the Lord
[1:44:07] do you see why Paul here in the book of
[1:44:10] Corinthians is encouraging us to realize
[1:44:13] that the uncommonly parts of our body
[1:44:16] are very important
[1:44:19] the reason why God will allow us we've
[1:44:21] been dealing with that here for a while
[1:44:23] the reason why he will allow things in
[1:44:26] our life and and uh you know uh that the
[1:44:30] things that will keep us on our knees
[1:44:32] things that will make us humble it is
[1:44:36] God's design
[1:44:37] he knows what we are made out of he
[1:44:40] knows exactly what to set us
[1:44:45] to bring us to perfection
[1:44:49] Paul says he poured this tone in my
[1:44:51] flesh Paul testified to it that if I've
[1:44:55] been not hard to deal with this ice
[1:44:56] problem maybe I would have exalted
[1:45:00] myself above all the brethrens
[1:45:04] he says but God
[1:45:07] gave me this problem that keep buffing
[1:45:09] me
[1:45:11] it keeps bothering me
[1:45:16] and I prayed about it and I prayed he
[1:45:19] says and the Lord says Paul my grace
[1:45:22] is sufficient
[1:45:24] and my strength
[1:45:26] is made perfect in the weakness that I
[1:45:30] place in your body
[1:45:32] praise the Lord every time you come to
[1:45:34] that weakest spot that's when you need
[1:45:37] me the most
[1:45:43] praise the Lord
[1:45:46] so it's not only the word is not only
[1:45:49] the mystery that God used to equip us
[1:45:53] he also used our nature
[1:45:57] he used the way we are made
[1:46:02] praise the Lord
[1:46:06] when God sent a man to do anything I
[1:46:10] don't know what God sent you to do but
[1:46:11] you think about it he completely
[1:46:13] equipped him with everything that he has
[1:46:18] need of
[1:46:19] if God called a man to be a preacher he
[1:46:24] puts something in him to preach with
[1:46:28] if he call him to be a teacher he puts
[1:46:31] something in him
[1:46:33] to teach with
[1:46:35] if he call him to be a prophet he puts
[1:46:38] something in him to see visions
[1:46:42] and to be a prophet
[1:46:44] God always com completely equate his man
[1:46:50] and that's just what he's done when he
[1:46:55] sent Moses to Egypt and I will also say
[1:46:58] that's what he's he's doing right here
[1:47:00] when he sent this uh uh there who over
[1:47:03] there to iglam over tomorrow
[1:47:08] to bring Deliverance to his people
[1:47:13] you know uh uh
[1:47:16] you know the story there over in uh uh
[1:47:21] how you call it now the same judges of
[1:47:24] of Jeff Ty
[1:47:25] how he was rejected
[1:47:29] now so you see here that this man in the
[1:47:33] state that he was
[1:47:35] I don't believe that Israel who have
[1:47:38] ever taught
[1:47:39] that this is the kind of a man that we
[1:47:41] want to be our judge
[1:47:43] just like they could not think that Jeff
[1:47:46] time because
[1:47:48] he was now born of a mother that was
[1:47:51] Hebrew that kicked him out of the camp
[1:47:53] but that was just the man that was fit
[1:47:56] for the job
[1:48:01] praise the Lord
[1:48:03] you know where I'm trying to travel
[1:48:04] tonight I'm trying to travel in the area
[1:48:07] of your weaknesses
[1:48:09] I want to exploit your weaknesses
[1:48:11] tonight
[1:48:13] praise the Lord
[1:48:15] amen because you see that is it is those
[1:48:18] uncommonly parts that we cover
[1:48:23] praise the Lord
[1:48:24] amen because we think that they are not
[1:48:28] necessary we all love to talk about you
[1:48:31] know how I read a message in the
[1:48:34] Revelation that I get we don't talk
[1:48:35] about our weaknesses so often we also we
[1:48:39] always cover them
[1:48:41] because we think they are shameful
[1:48:44] we think that uh you know when we start
[1:48:47] talking about it people might think you
[1:48:50] know we're not really a Believer but
[1:48:52] that's the place I want to travel
[1:48:54] tonight
[1:48:56] that's the place I want to travel
[1:48:58] tonight
[1:48:59] because I believe that every one of us
[1:49:03] do it in those areas
[1:49:05] sometimes amen
[1:49:07] and that's the place I want us to travel
[1:49:09] tonight and hoping that God will be able
[1:49:13] to to uh to bless us you will be able to
[1:49:17] give us even for the grace and because
[1:49:20] it is it is is the it's the most place
[1:49:22] that Satan also likes to deal with us he
[1:49:26] likes to remind us of those weaknesses
[1:49:28] because he feels like every time he goes
[1:49:31] in those areas and bring those things to
[1:49:34] our mind and we weaken our faith and we
[1:49:36] condemn us
[1:49:37] it would trouble us
[1:49:40] praise the Lord
[1:49:42] Hallelujah
[1:49:44] amen
[1:49:47] so I pray that the Lord will be able to
[1:49:49] help us tonight amen
[1:49:52] praise the Lord
[1:50:00] brother Branham says as he continuing
[1:50:01] here in total Deliverance then just like
[1:50:04] if you are a Christian God Don't Make
[1:50:07] Any Halfway Christian
[1:50:09] God make a complete Christian he God
[1:50:13] Don't Make a halfway preacher but a
[1:50:16] preacher can be halfway
[1:50:19] and God make his children Christians but
[1:50:23] sometimes they are halfway Christians
[1:50:27] but it's not God's intention for them to
[1:50:31] be that way
[1:50:33] in their own ways God makes up with the
[1:50:38] plan of God for their lives and that's
[1:50:41] what makes them the way they are
[1:50:44] God don't want them to be half with
[1:50:47] Christians or have with preachers
[1:50:50] compromising on every side or he want
[1:50:54] them to be completely standing in the
[1:50:58] bridge
[1:50:59] praise the Lord he want us to be
[1:51:02] completely standing in the bridge
[1:51:05] Hallelujah
[1:51:07] amen
[1:51:10] praise the Lord
[1:51:13] now so we see here
[1:51:15] that uh
[1:51:18] this is this is all God's doing
[1:51:21] you know it's it's all he's doing is uh
[1:51:24] uh the prophet of God also speak here in
[1:51:27] spiritual adoption he says the tutor
[1:51:30] always point the child to the father
[1:51:33] and to have him to to believe the father
[1:51:37] and then the teacher
[1:51:39] was a trainer
[1:51:42] this morning as I was looking
[1:51:47] I have my dear little company I see my
[1:51:50] little son
[1:51:52] when he you know he troll
[1:51:55] his little tantrum at the table in that
[1:51:58] Broadband is going to talk about here
[1:52:00] there uh how media trying to correct
[1:52:03] Joseph and it's also in the use of him
[1:52:07] yet I realized where this is going
[1:52:10] uh he's going to talk here in the use of
[1:52:13] hand you're trying to me they're trying
[1:52:15] to choose uh train Joseph in using his
[1:52:18] right hand and now using his left hand
[1:52:20] but what I want to take here in in this
[1:52:24] talk is is the place of tutorship
[1:52:27] Birmingham taught us how
[1:52:30] in adoption the father will always get a
[1:52:34] tutor for his children
[1:52:36] and the reason why the father we get the
[1:52:39] tutor is because he want the child to
[1:52:42] get to the place where they can be able
[1:52:44] to appreciate their inheritance
[1:52:48] he is also teaching the child the
[1:52:50] different things what the father desire
[1:52:53] is but it's all about the inheritance
[1:52:55] it's all about what what the father had
[1:52:57] given to us
[1:52:59] and uh and I believe that is the place
[1:53:02] where we are
[1:53:04] you have to remember things so brother
[1:53:06] Brown says we are going we are going to
[1:53:08] go into uh dark times we are facing
[1:53:12] Troubled Waters and and the different
[1:53:14] things that is happening uh around the
[1:53:17] world around the message around the
[1:53:20] Christian faith and the hour that we are
[1:53:22] living in
[1:53:23] so it's very important for us
[1:53:27] Sons and Daughters of God to be able to
[1:53:30] understand what what is the Father's
[1:53:33] mind
[1:53:33] concerning us
[1:53:37] praise the Lord the different things
[1:53:39] that we go through the different things
[1:53:41] that we deal with how do God looks at
[1:53:44] them
[1:53:45] the struggle that we go through
[1:53:48] praise the Lord
[1:53:49] because I'm telling you if you keep
[1:53:51] listening to the devil the devil is
[1:53:53] never going to tell you anything
[1:53:55] positive about what you are dealing with
[1:54:00] praise the Lord
[1:54:01] but God said in his word I know the
[1:54:03] thoughts that I think towards you
[1:54:07] and my thoughts is to bring you to
[1:54:10] unexpected end
[1:54:11] so no matter what we are going through
[1:54:13] no matter where we are dealing with in
[1:54:16] our life we have to understand that God
[1:54:19] is part of God's design
[1:54:22] to be able to bring us to the place that
[1:54:25] he wants us to be
[1:54:28] it is not there to give us a setback
[1:54:31] it is not there that whenever we get in
[1:54:34] this area of weakness or get in this
[1:54:37] area of Temptation then it becomes a
[1:54:39] setback oh I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:41] oh I'm not a child of God
[1:54:46] praise the Lord
[1:54:50] but I think it's more out of place of
[1:54:52] word
[1:54:56] God wants to grab our attention
[1:55:00] and they are just like I said over and
[1:55:02] over he has brought us into a
[1:55:05] partnership
[1:55:08] and many times are we you know we
[1:55:10] believe the Bible says repent and be
[1:55:12] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[1:55:14] of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:15] so sometimes they have always been
[1:55:18] taught that when we go down to the water
[1:55:20] then we are baptized all the the sinful
[1:55:24] nature leaves under the water
[1:55:26] no that's just a symbol
[1:55:29] all right
[1:55:31] that is just a symbol those those sticky
[1:55:34] nature they are stay there in our hearts
[1:55:37] and in our mind
[1:55:40] but when we come out of the water
[1:55:42] understanding that now is the time where
[1:55:45] God wants for you and him to be a
[1:55:48] partner to deal with those things one at
[1:55:50] a time whether he will expose it by the
[1:55:52] word of God all you would discover that
[1:55:56] this is an area that I need need God
[1:56:01] praise the Lord
[1:56:03] but you know what I've happened many of
[1:56:04] the times we think that those things
[1:56:06] will spiritually goes away
[1:56:10] we expect them to disappear
[1:56:13] oh yeah sometimes they will sometimes
[1:56:16] God will deliver them Deliver Us from
[1:56:18] them
[1:56:19] but sometimes they have some things that
[1:56:22] he want our hands on deck
[1:56:25] praise the Lord he want us to be able to
[1:56:28] identify it he wants us or to have such
[1:56:32] an anger against this thing
[1:56:37] praise the Lord
[1:56:39] he want for us to deal with faith most
[1:56:42] especially just like the turn of Israel
[1:56:45] they're over in the promised land there
[1:56:47] uh uh uh Judges chapter one The Bible
[1:56:51] says that because you have compromised
[1:56:54] these uh people of the land are going to
[1:56:56] be torns in your sign
[1:57:01] God told them to get rid of it those
[1:57:04] things that we compromise with those
[1:57:06] things that afternoon the knowledge of
[1:57:09] the truth we get ourselves in sometimes
[1:57:12] they just don't go away
[1:57:14] right
[1:57:17] we don't have these uh uh Supernatural
[1:57:21] night over over flying nothing you know
[1:57:23] and because sometimes you come to the
[1:57:25] meeting and and the presence of God will
[1:57:27] be so strong you enjoy the service you
[1:57:30] know you lift your hands also you wait
[1:57:32] you feel that sweetness around you and
[1:57:35] and you know you you could have the mind
[1:57:37] that I believe that God will deliver me
[1:57:40] praise the Lord
[1:57:44] then after a week or two you realize
[1:57:47] that that thing stays start creeping on
[1:57:49] you
[1:57:52] you don't start smelling it or you start
[1:57:54] feeling it
[1:57:59] not if you don't understand the
[1:58:01] principle of redemption that God told
[1:58:03] the children of Israel he says I have
[1:58:05] given the land to you
[1:58:07] amen
[1:58:09] he says I will send Muhammad to push
[1:58:11] them back he says I will drive them off
[1:58:14] the land he and he also tell them you
[1:58:16] have to fight for every inch of ground
[1:58:21] praise the Lord
[1:58:23] so you can't sit back and say God you
[1:58:25] said you will deliver them you were you
[1:58:27] would give us the land it's the land
[1:58:28] flowing we're milking only yes it is
[1:58:33] he said you were pushed back then yes
[1:58:35] God will push back the enemy
[1:58:37] but he also said you should fight
[1:58:41] for every inch of ground
[1:58:49] praise the Lord
[1:58:53] how God is going to use
[1:59:00] what seems to be like a disability
[1:59:07] praise the Lord
[1:59:10] maybe this young man coming up
[1:59:14] people might have laughed at him
[1:59:23] he might have had a lot of people that
[1:59:25] are you know bother him teasing
[1:59:27] or they are even if there was nobody
[1:59:30] teasing him sometimes you have that
[1:59:32] complex
[1:59:34] because it looks like you are different
[1:59:35] from everybody
[1:59:38] so you deal with that mental complexion
[1:59:45] his age is not mentioned but there is
[1:59:48] enough years of Oppression year 18 years
[1:59:53] 18 years that is an age of a teenage boy
[2:00:00] so if we just say for that example to
[2:00:03] think in our mind that from the time he
[2:00:06] was born
[2:00:08] he was honored the suppression
[2:00:12] of the moabites
[2:00:15] that's all he saw
[2:00:19] he saw the air farmer the Harvest being
[2:00:23] being taken away from them
[2:00:27] he saw how these moabites were coming to
[2:00:29] their town if he had a sister or he had
[2:00:32] a cursing or how the the girls in their
[2:00:34] place was ravaged
[2:00:38] just a sense of suppression
[2:00:41] that he dealt with
[2:00:44] for 18 years
[2:00:47] I wonder what was going on in his mind
[2:00:52] praise the Lord
[2:00:54] I wonder what was going on in his mind
[2:00:59] maybe that Ezra had an army or they just
[2:01:01] had a little group of men that were
[2:01:04] coming together and talking about
[2:01:05] Deliverance
[2:01:07] maybe he never felt like he could fit
[2:01:10] among them
[2:01:16] maybe he'd get him on there and he just
[2:01:18] said hey you go just go home go and stay
[2:01:21] home stay beside your mama
[2:01:23] we don't want anybody to hurt you you're
[2:01:25] already dealing with a whole lot
[2:01:29] praise the Lord
[2:01:32] but you see yet in his state of weakness
[2:01:37] there was something that was building in
[2:01:40] his heart
[2:01:41] and what is that courage
[2:01:45] courage is is uh is an unconscious faith
[2:01:51] because brother Branham said faith is
[2:01:53] unconscious
[2:01:56] praise the Lord
[2:01:59] he says faith is unconscious
[2:02:03] what we call we have faith
[2:02:06] he says it's on a conscious level
[2:02:09] and many times when they are faith we
[2:02:11] think we have is put to the test we fail
[2:02:17] and because it's on a conscious level is
[2:02:20] limited
[2:02:26] he says by the time faith is really
[2:02:29] expressed it comes from a subconscious
[2:02:33] moment
[2:02:35] where the person is just overtaking
[2:02:38] and like like like like
[2:02:40] I would just pick up
[2:02:46] and the Bible says he killed how many
[2:02:48] men whether it was in One bank or more
[2:02:50] than one day it comes from a
[2:02:52] subconscious place
[2:02:54] and I believe that's that's where
[2:02:56] courage comes from
[2:03:00] when a person take courage
[2:03:04] courage don't comes from reason
[2:03:08] well we reason in our mind and we
[2:03:11] calculate and you know and yeah and we
[2:03:13] make plans and and all of that you know
[2:03:16] uh you know how much it would cost
[2:03:17] meaning how many time I can put in it
[2:03:20] and all of that you can make all of
[2:03:22] those planes I don't know whether you
[2:03:24] have been there I've been in that place
[2:03:25] you make all of those planes it looks so
[2:03:29] beautiful in your mind
[2:03:30] but yet you don't have the strength
[2:03:33] to carry it out
[2:03:37] when you are just by yourself you are
[2:03:39] living it in your head
[2:03:41] to be able to bring it out there is no
[2:03:44] strength
[2:03:48] a man in the Bible that I've had courage
[2:03:53] that will courageous to do things
[2:03:56] they came from a very
[2:03:59] subconscious place
[2:04:03] I hope there are some things that I
[2:04:05] could I could read to you tonight
[2:04:08] on that uh
[2:04:11] but uh
[2:04:13] technology is failing me
[2:04:17] I was speaking a little bit on that this
[2:04:20] this uh weekend
[2:04:22] there uh uh in South Africa I was my
[2:04:27] first service
[2:04:28] the brother that opened the meeting he
[2:04:30] preached on the message uh caused faith
[2:04:33] that this word is not worthy of so I
[2:04:35] thought okay I would come behind him
[2:04:37] with a message of faith and I trusted
[2:04:39] the Lord and uh but I was I was actually
[2:04:42] talking from a place where signs
[2:04:46] has been able it's it's a kind of a big
[2:04:49] Discovery what they did was that they
[2:04:52] took they as they took the Titanic
[2:04:57] and and the and the earthwork that
[2:05:00] destroyed the Titanic because the
[2:05:03] Titanic had
[2:05:04] five levels
[2:05:08] so the five levels of the Titanic
[2:05:10] they're locking there to our five senses
[2:05:16] praise the Lord
[2:05:18] and and what they did also is that
[2:05:23] they were able to to to to see their
[2:05:26] when the ship was
[2:05:29] was heading out to the Sea
[2:05:32] there was a little portion of the
[2:05:35] iceberg that was on top of the water
[2:05:39] the one that was floating on top of the
[2:05:41] water
[2:05:42] but what the the captain of the ship or
[2:05:45] the engineers of the ship did not
[2:05:47] realize
[2:05:48] there there was a a huge peace
[2:05:54] of their asper because what happened is
[2:05:57] that the ship was built in such a way
[2:06:00] that if if the lower level is scratched
[2:06:04] they could stay still
[2:06:07] and they could live on the rest of the
[2:06:09] full level
[2:06:14] if the fourth level of the ship
[2:06:19] was hit they could all gather on the
[2:06:23] fifth floor
[2:06:24] and the ship will stay still
[2:06:27] but what the iceberg did is that it hit
[2:06:30] it in a way they hit it just like this
[2:06:32] it never hit it like this
[2:06:36] so all five level
[2:06:40] of the ship was hit
[2:06:44] so there was no level that was left for
[2:06:47] survival
[2:06:53] and it was all because
[2:06:56] they either underestimated
[2:07:03] how that Iceberg was so science is
[2:07:07] comparing that now with us and they are
[2:07:10] trying to let us know that
[2:07:13] with what we see with our five senses
[2:07:17] and what we are conscious to
[2:07:21] this is science telling us this is
[2:07:23] something brother Brandon told us since
[2:07:26] 1955. I wish I could I read the quotes
[2:07:29] here to you tonight now science is now
[2:07:32] discovering that that uh uh uh the
[2:07:37] things that we see with our natural eyes
[2:07:39] that we are conscious to they are making
[2:07:41] us to realize that uh uh we we our our
[2:07:45] Consciousness is very limited
[2:07:50] and most of our live action and reaction
[2:07:54] is driving from our subconscious level
[2:08:00] the way we react to things
[2:08:05] is all driving from our subconscious
[2:08:08] level
[2:08:13] it's from that subconscious level
[2:08:17] we make decisions and we react to things
[2:08:20] there are sometimes
[2:08:22] help us to move on or sometimes makes us
[2:08:25] to fail
[2:08:29] praise the Lord
[2:08:31] amen
[2:08:33] so you will realize as we are sitting
[2:08:35] here tonight
[2:08:37] and as a Son of God as a daughter of God
[2:08:39] you've been hearing the word and the
[2:08:41] word being preached to you and and you
[2:08:44] know sometimes you enjoy the preaching
[2:08:46] of the word sometimes you struggle to be
[2:08:48] able to see where the word is going and
[2:08:50] all of that but you will see just like
[2:08:52] even you look at brother Brandon
[2:08:54] Ministry let me just bring that in a
[2:08:55] little bit here you look at brother
[2:08:57] Brandon Ministry you will realize that
[2:08:59] in in in in in in in in most of the time
[2:09:02] brother Branham honored the gift and
[2:09:04] he's dealing with people they are like
[2:09:06] he said he says I live most of my life
[2:09:08] in another room that the word knows
[2:09:10] nothing about
[2:09:11] so brother Branham the the preaching of
[2:09:14] the word
[2:09:18] goes mostly for our subconscious state
[2:09:22] then our conscious state
[2:09:26] sometimes the preacher will say
[2:09:28] something that will grab your attention
[2:09:30] you would dwell on that and you will go
[2:09:33] on preaching but you will just be
[2:09:34] captured in that thought
[2:09:43] praise the Lord
[2:09:47] and that is the same way courage is
[2:09:52] something that comes from in
[2:09:55] our subconscious state
[2:09:59] now if a person has been to the place
[2:10:01] word they I mean they're being bullied
[2:10:04] they've been rejected and you know no
[2:10:06] one tried to see their area of strain
[2:10:09] and encourage them a little bit they can
[2:10:11] have beautiful I mean wonderful ideas in
[2:10:14] their mind
[2:10:15] praise the Lord they are thinking about
[2:10:18] this they are thinking about this but
[2:10:19] yet they don't have the courage
[2:10:21] to be able to express it
[2:10:27] I wonder if I say this they will yell at
[2:10:29] me again
[2:10:31] I wonder if I try this I will be
[2:10:33] accepted
[2:10:37] sometimes people go through different
[2:10:40] things in their lives
[2:10:44] whenever the brands also said that he
[2:10:46] says when we deal with things
[2:10:49] and we don't deal with it rightly
[2:10:51] whether it's a mistake in our lives or
[2:10:54] is wrong that we have done he talks
[2:10:57] about that woman that was caught in
[2:10:59] adultery where her husband was on went
[2:11:01] for war he says uh because she never did
[2:11:05] there with her rightly he said it just
[2:11:08] went and sat down in her subconscious
[2:11:10] reign
[2:11:12] that's why it was running her mad
[2:11:17] every time she see that nobody is coming
[2:11:21] she was reacting to what was sitting
[2:11:23] down in her subconscious area
[2:11:31] praise the Lord so whether on the
[2:11:33] positive side or on the negative side
[2:11:40] so what might have been going through
[2:11:42] the mind
[2:11:43] of our character tonight what was he
[2:11:45] thinking about
[2:11:47] 18 years
[2:11:52] now my question to you tonight
[2:11:57] before we go into praying
[2:11:59] all of the things that you have seen
[2:12:02] around the message
[2:12:04] the one that you can call the good
[2:12:06] things the one you can call the bad
[2:12:08] things
[2:12:09] as you go on
[2:12:11] and on
[2:12:14] what have you been thinking what how how
[2:12:17] how
[2:12:19] are those things being chattering your
[2:12:21] faith
[2:12:22] how are they been dealing with you
[2:12:25] as your local things if you are in this
[2:12:28] assembly you look at things around the
[2:12:31] assembly you look at the church
[2:12:33] and all of that just let me just keep it
[2:12:36] home here
[2:12:37] you know what are the things that are
[2:12:39] going through your mind
[2:12:41] you everything we about to close another
[2:12:43] year
[2:12:47] all the messages that are being preached
[2:12:52] which direction are we going
[2:13:00] where as a church are we going where
[2:13:02] where I mean where do we find ourselves
[2:13:08] also there are areas where we can we can
[2:13:11] claim some victory we can thank God for
[2:13:13] this service we have this preacher came
[2:13:15] or he preached a wonderful message it
[2:13:17] was a Revival we enjoyed
[2:13:20] but what about all the things that have
[2:13:21] been happening
[2:13:26] praise the Lord
[2:13:31] possible other things that have been
[2:13:32] happening
[2:13:42] how are you channeling all the things
[2:13:45] that you see around your individual life
[2:13:49] how are you channeling it
[2:13:52] says sinking your shape
[2:13:56] or is it building strength in you
[2:14:00] for you to be able to deal with the King
[2:14:03] of England
[2:14:10] is it is it it said creating strength is
[2:14:14] it is inspiring you
[2:14:16] are you grabbing some inspiration
[2:14:18] because I believe it was not just one
[2:14:21] Bank
[2:14:23] that air who designed that digger
[2:14:27] that he will be able to go he reached to
[2:14:30] the gate greet the people and says I
[2:14:32] have a present for the king
[2:14:34] and then everybody and everybody no one
[2:14:36] thought that he had a digger that he was
[2:14:38] going to to kill their King and and take
[2:14:41] over them
[2:14:43] I don't think it was just one night
[2:14:45] service
[2:14:49] for all the 18 years of Oppression
[2:14:54] he was channeling
[2:14:56] the beating he was channeling the crying
[2:14:59] he would hear in the city
[2:15:01] the rape he will see the destruction
[2:15:06] that the moabits will come and take
[2:15:07] their things all of those things he was
[2:15:10] chattering it
[2:15:13] and it was it was for him it was
[2:15:15] building from strength to strength
[2:15:21] from strength to strength
[2:15:26] he was saying Lord
[2:15:28] how we going to come out of this
[2:15:33] Lord what can I do
[2:15:36] to deliver my mothers and my brothers
[2:15:39] one contribution can I make
[2:15:42] to change what is taking place in this
[2:15:44] place
[2:15:46] seeing all of those things that's what
[2:15:49] was coming to his mind
[2:15:51] goes to bed
[2:15:53] the best blanket and put it over his
[2:15:55] head
[2:15:56] he's thinking in his mind what can I do
[2:16:00] what can I do
[2:16:03] I might not live till tomorrow
[2:16:05] if the enemy come upon us tonight Lord
[2:16:08] what can I do to deliver this house
[2:16:11] what can I do to become an impact
[2:16:20] what can I do to strengthen the brother
[2:16:23] or to strengthena sister
[2:16:34] Lord if this is the place you have
[2:16:36] called me to self
[2:16:37] if this little group is where you have
[2:16:40] called me to self to be part of this
[2:16:42] body what can I do to make it better
[2:16:50] he goes to bed and that's what he's
[2:16:52] going through his mind
[2:16:55] that's what is going through his mind
[2:16:58] he's thinking thinking about it
[2:17:02] thinking about it even though
[2:17:05] it seems like he's handicapped
[2:17:07] it seems like he's left-handed
[2:17:10] even to the Jewish mind left hand there
[2:17:13] was something completely different
[2:17:18] if we just take it in light of the way
[2:17:20] the scripture says he's left-handed
[2:17:25] even to the Jewish mind that alone is
[2:17:27] something completely different
[2:17:33] what can I do
[2:17:38] courage
[2:17:42] praise the Lord
[2:17:46] even though we know that something had a
[2:17:49] seven laws
[2:17:50] but a lot of the things that he did
[2:17:53] it was
[2:17:54] from Courage
[2:18:02] and just like something we can do the
[2:18:04] same
[2:18:05] because we have a God that promised he
[2:18:07] will never leave us he will never
[2:18:08] forsake us
[2:18:12] we have an unfailing promised world with
[2:18:14] us
[2:18:16] God says as the mountain is surrounded
[2:18:19] Jerusalem so the Lord is about his
[2:18:21] people
[2:18:25] we have used some of our
[2:18:27] Petty situation
[2:18:29] to reduce our God to nothing
[2:18:33] some of our petty situations
[2:18:37] we have made those situations to Cloud
[2:18:39] our mind
[2:18:42] we are bury our faith
[2:18:45] honor those situations
[2:18:49] praise the Lord
[2:18:51] and then it seems like our God is going
[2:18:53] far away from us
[2:18:57] when Paul said the lord it's 90 even in
[2:18:59] the mouth
[2:19:00] and thou We Believe with your heart and
[2:19:02] confess with your mouth
[2:19:04] that's what the scripture says Romans
[2:19:06] chapter 10.
[2:19:10] courage
[2:19:13] all of those deliverers that rose up
[2:19:18] in the Book of Judges it was courage
[2:19:23] they came out of Courage
[2:19:26] because they can no longer bid
[2:19:29] the suppression they can no longer bid
[2:19:34] the things that was keeping them from
[2:19:37] enjoying
[2:19:38] the land that was flooring with milk and
[2:19:41] honey
[2:19:42] the blessings that God has given to them
[2:19:45] they could no longer enjoy it
[2:19:49] because of fear doubt
[2:19:52] and all of that
[2:19:54] but when they respond told their
[2:19:56] subconscious faith of Courage they were
[2:19:59] able to step out they were able to they
[2:20:01] were able to break themselves
[2:20:07] praise the Lord
[2:20:10] oh I hope that this coming year will be
[2:20:12] a year of Courage for you
[2:20:14] I hope the coming year would be a year
[2:20:16] that you would you you'll be able to get
[2:20:18] some courage and you'll be able to step
[2:20:21] out as a Son of God and as a daughter of
[2:20:23] God and bring some of those situations
[2:20:25] under control
[2:20:30] because you have what it takes
[2:20:35] you have what it takes brother Brown
[2:20:37] says why the church needs it already
[2:20:39] have it
[2:20:41] he says that faith is lying dominant
[2:20:43] it's lying there we we're making no use
[2:20:45] of it
[2:20:47] we are allowing Petty things
[2:20:53] he says we'll make the mouth to speak
[2:20:56] when Aaron says Moses says I can't speak
[2:20:58] who make the mouth to speak
[2:21:04] my question would be who gave us the
[2:21:06] nature we have
[2:21:08] whether it is temper whether it is lying
[2:21:11] tongue water it is uh uh uh you know my
[2:21:15] battle Lost full speed whatever it is
[2:21:17] we'll make this body
[2:21:21] I can't I just cannot put him put it
[2:21:24] right
[2:21:28] praise the Lord
[2:21:32] who make this body that just came for
[2:21:35] the right
[2:21:43] if he promised to take out a Stony heart
[2:21:46] is he a lying tongue that he can take
[2:21:48] away
[2:21:56] we just need courage
[2:21:59] we just need courage and I think that's
[2:22:02] one of the things that have gone away
[2:22:03] from the church
[2:22:06] that's one of the things that have gone
[2:22:07] away
[2:22:08] from the Christian church
[2:22:11] when it used to be were the the
[2:22:15] old fathers and and all believers would
[2:22:18] come together
[2:22:19] and people will grow courage
[2:22:22] to be able to share their weaknesses
[2:22:25] church pray for me
[2:22:27] I've been going through this the devil
[2:22:29] being bothering me through this
[2:22:31] that courage has gone from the church
[2:22:35] praise the Lord
[2:22:37] we are all wearing the max
[2:22:40] and every song that we try to make the
[2:22:42] max up
[2:22:43] we're masking ourself
[2:22:47] I don't have the courage to say Lord
[2:22:50] I need more of God
[2:22:55] I need the Holy Ghost
[2:22:58] I need God to deliver me from this habit
[2:23:03] that's just courage
[2:23:08] praise the Lord
[2:23:13] oh but we are so we are so we have just
[2:23:16] power the complex and what people will
[2:23:19] think and what people will say and what
[2:23:21] people would do
[2:23:24] that is so hard for us to find a man of
[2:23:27] Christ
[2:23:34] every character
[2:23:40] through the book
[2:23:42] is courage
[2:23:48] praise the Lord
[2:23:52] it's just gone
[2:24:02] just like I was sharing with you after a
[2:24:05] meeting we
[2:24:06] we shot down and you know the brothers
[2:24:08] were going through the different things
[2:24:09] and talking about
[2:24:12] you know how
[2:24:14] how we have failed
[2:24:18] in some areas
[2:24:21] is because
[2:24:23] even to get the courage and said you
[2:24:27] know the young people down our children
[2:24:29] down and tell them the things that we
[2:24:32] deal with right the struggle that we had
[2:24:37] things that we deal with
[2:24:40] because uh uh you know they always see
[2:24:44] the leaders and parents and and fathers
[2:24:47] like strong men
[2:24:48] they don't know how to deal with
[2:24:50] weaknesses because the interpretation
[2:24:54] there is that I never seen my father
[2:24:56] crying so I'm not supposed to cry
[2:25:01] I'm not supposed to cry
[2:25:03] it's not meant to cry
[2:25:07] it's not a man to say sorry
[2:25:10] come on now yep
[2:25:13] and if they don't see you doing it they
[2:25:16] will just think that it's not supposed
[2:25:18] to be sold
[2:25:22] there's not supposed to be so
[2:25:25] children learn from example
[2:25:31] most of the things that we learn from is
[2:25:34] the thing that we capture we see it we
[2:25:37] we suck it in like sponge what are some
[2:25:40] of the things they are teaching us don't
[2:25:42] do this don't do this it just go over
[2:25:44] your head
[2:25:47] as they are saying as you're shaking
[2:25:48] your head you're dropping it to the
[2:25:50] ground yes yes yes you just throwing it
[2:25:53] down
[2:25:54] but once you learn is the ones that you
[2:25:57] see
[2:25:59] can It capture your mind it goes
[2:26:02] straight down in your subconscious it's
[2:26:04] still there
[2:26:09] that's the reason why Paul said these
[2:26:11] things were for your examples
[2:26:13] the things you see in the scriptures
[2:26:15] they were for your example
[2:26:21] because we don't see those things
[2:26:25] they are no longer in church
[2:26:29] they are no longer in church
[2:26:36] and what you don't realize we don't
[2:26:38] realize is that we are killing the
[2:26:41] children in that way we are not
[2:26:43] inspiring them
[2:26:47] we are not inspiring them
[2:26:49] they don't see anything to follow after
[2:26:53] all they see is that we come to church
[2:26:55] we sit in our seats
[2:26:59] praise the Lord
[2:27:02] we sit there we you know we we just you
[2:27:05] know follow the service say amen and all
[2:27:07] that
[2:27:09] courage
[2:27:13] courage
[2:27:20] praise the Lord
[2:27:23] I pray that God will give us some
[2:27:25] courage tonight
[2:27:27] praise the Lord
[2:27:29] I even coming out here this evening
[2:27:31] would just now be uh another dry
[2:27:34] religious evening
[2:27:36] where we will have the courage to be
[2:27:37] able to break some grounds we have the
[2:27:39] courage to be able to pour out our
[2:27:41] hearts tonight in you know and really be
[2:27:44] able to spend some time with the Lord
[2:27:46] you know and and just put our house out
[2:27:49] because I realized that we will have the
[2:27:52] service on on Saturday I mean I can keep
[2:27:55] you Saturday night and and I expect you
[2:27:57] to come Sunday morning again for church
[2:27:59] I mean that would that would just stress
[2:28:02] you out so uh or as we'll just have the
[2:28:05] service you know let's just sing let's
[2:28:06] just pray that's nice 12 o'clock we pray
[2:28:08] and go home because we got to come back
[2:28:10] to church on uh uh uh on Sunday morning
[2:28:15] but I wanted for us to come together
[2:28:16] tonight
[2:28:18] praise the Lord
[2:28:20] and just and just try to
[2:28:25] become sparring partners tonight
[2:28:30] you know what sparring partners are
[2:28:34] is uh it's almost like the you know the
[2:28:38] boxer
[2:28:40] he has a sparring partner when he gets
[2:28:43] in the ring with him
[2:28:45] they just don't joke
[2:28:47] even though they are training
[2:28:49] but but they hit one another high
[2:28:53] barbam says that's the reason that's the
[2:28:55] way that Smith was
[2:29:01] the second Smith the one that trained
[2:29:03] him in boxing the prophet of God said
[2:29:05] when he gets in the ring with that man
[2:29:07] the man will will punish him so much
[2:29:09] until he will go over the rink
[2:29:11] he thought that the man hated him
[2:29:18] preparing him to be the champion that he
[2:29:21] was
[2:29:26] praise the Lord
[2:29:27] to be the champion
[2:29:30] that he was the Lord was so good to us
[2:29:34] he kept us
[2:29:38] his grace and his Mercy was Richmond to
[2:29:41] us
[2:29:44] even as a church
[2:29:46] as a people we can be grateful to the
[2:29:48] Lord
[2:29:50] but you see we just can't continue this
[2:29:52] way
[2:29:56] we can't continue this way because
[2:29:58] memorials are very important
[2:30:00] all through the scripture you will see
[2:30:02] God
[2:30:04] left memorial for his people
[2:30:08] he said when you're going across Jordan
[2:30:09] gather those stones
[2:30:12] tomorrow when your children ask you what
[2:30:15] is the meaning of those stones
[2:30:17] you can tell them
[2:30:19] the Lord brought us through their water
[2:30:22] we cross on dry Lane and We Gather the
[2:30:26] stones there
[2:30:30] Memorial is very important
[2:30:37] praise the Lord
[2:30:40] I pray that the Lord will give us a Time
[2:30:43] tested Memorial tonight
[2:30:46] amen
[2:30:47] you gave us a Time testing Memorial I
[2:30:50] mean there are things we deal with in
[2:30:51] our lives and and uh you know all that
[2:30:54] uh the Lokes unbearable and looks uh I
[2:30:58] mean we sometimes we get tired we get
[2:31:00] frustrated about about of these things
[2:31:03] and you know the way that uh uh but
[2:31:06] sometimes you gotta you gotta step back
[2:31:08] a little bit
[2:31:10] I mean if it's if it is yourself you
[2:31:13] know a scene driven habit you just need
[2:31:15] a holy ghost to burn it
[2:31:17] right you know if it's the same driven
[2:31:19] habit you just need the Holy Ghost to
[2:31:20] burn it that's all you need with that
[2:31:25] but I mean uh when I'm talking about uh
[2:31:28] areas that it looks like we are somehow
[2:31:31] weak we are somehow vulnerable in all of
[2:31:34] that you know it looks like uh you know
[2:31:37] we can make out our mind on some on some
[2:31:39] pain so where we are at all the devil is
[2:31:41] keep troubling us about whether you have
[2:31:43] the Holy Ghost or you don't have the
[2:31:45] Holy Ghost and then sometimes you got to
[2:31:47] look at those things in your life
[2:31:50] he says Lord
[2:31:53] I don't understand what's happening
[2:31:58] I've been watching this pattern in my
[2:32:00] life
[2:32:02] it just looks like this thing come
[2:32:04] around after every couple of weeks or a
[2:32:07] couple of months
[2:32:10] praise the Lord
[2:32:15] and I believe that's what the hell who
[2:32:17] was doing
[2:32:19] he was thinking
[2:32:21] How can I
[2:32:24] how can I make a difference
[2:32:29] whatever I can do Lord
[2:32:31] even if it will cost my life
[2:32:34] can you imagine
[2:32:37] going into the enemy camp
[2:32:42] praise the Lord
[2:32:43] maybe he might have thought well I'm I'm
[2:32:45] even rejected by my people so what's
[2:32:47] what is the need let me just die
[2:32:49] I'm tired of seeing this thing
[2:32:52] so let me just go if my life with any in
[2:32:56] it let my life end
[2:33:00] you always say I have a message for the
[2:33:02] king
[2:33:06] I have a message for the king
[2:33:11] put himself in such a way
[2:33:13] very cool net
[2:33:15] suspect or detect but you see the thing
[2:33:18] that it was not it was not his
[2:33:20] craftiness
[2:33:24] it was God looking at the desire of his
[2:33:27] heart
[2:33:29] God looking at the desire of his heart
[2:33:33] wanting to do something for God offered
[2:33:36] God's people
[2:33:37] it was not his craftiness
[2:33:40] because you tell me look at the look at
[2:33:42] the description of the figure that he
[2:33:44] carried
[2:33:48] the Bible said he tied to his right time
[2:33:52] I mean in order that way I mean you are
[2:33:55] you are going into a place of of people
[2:33:58] that are trained to protect the king you
[2:34:01] mean they will not suspect you
[2:34:03] but when a man Waits pleases the Lord
[2:34:08] that's what the scripture says when a
[2:34:11] man Waits pleases the Lord
[2:34:18] I mean even as young people
[2:34:21] you know we use the word young people
[2:34:23] young people so sometimes you just get
[2:34:25] in our brain we think we are young we
[2:34:27] are young people wherever we meet young
[2:34:29] people we stay young people
[2:34:35] praise the Lord
[2:34:39] but if you realize you you found out
[2:34:41] that God never made babies
[2:34:45] when he brought the first son of God
[2:34:48] he was he was a he was a son
[2:34:53] when he expressed The First Daughter of
[2:34:55] God she was a lady
[2:34:57] ready out to carry out God's Commission
[2:35:05] praise the Lord
[2:35:07] we we've used that terminology sometimes
[2:35:09] they get in our head and we just think
[2:35:11] oh yeah we are still young people you
[2:35:13] know that's why young people deal with
[2:35:15] that's why young people you start having
[2:35:17] your children you keep dealing with it
[2:35:18] you will keep you be a young people
[2:35:20] having babies
[2:35:30] but you see the opening of the word
[2:35:32] it brings
[2:35:34] maturity
[2:35:36] why because brother Branham say it's
[2:35:38] Brian material
[2:35:41] is brown material
[2:35:43] it brings such responsibility
[2:35:49] to God's people and God's bride when you
[2:35:51] really start getting in the word I mean
[2:35:53] you really start getting in the word
[2:35:55] listening to the voice of God trying to
[2:35:59] grab God's mind
[2:36:02] not just following a religious order of
[2:36:04] listening to a message or trying to say
[2:36:07] Lord what is the spirit saying to me
[2:36:10] when you really start doing that you
[2:36:13] realize how how much maturity it will
[2:36:15] bring to you
[2:36:22] how much maturity it will bring to you
[2:36:25] the way it will impact your life
[2:36:36] it's a message to have come to get a
[2:36:37] bride
[2:36:38] ready
[2:36:42] and this word can get us ready for any
[2:36:44] situation
[2:36:52] my mind
[2:36:55] thing I want to do with you tonight
[2:36:57] just like Edward 18 years
[2:37:01] I don't know how many years she's been
[2:37:02] believing the Lord
[2:37:04] how many years God really been dealing
[2:37:06] with you how many years this message has
[2:37:08] realized that coming true to you
[2:37:10] it started becoming more personal to you
[2:37:15] and with all of the things that have
[2:37:17] happened around your life
[2:37:19] you're Uprising you're down falling your
[2:37:22] you know mistakes
[2:37:25] what have you brought to you
[2:37:29] what courage
[2:37:30] are you getting from me
[2:37:33] even with this entire year that is about
[2:37:36] to close on us
[2:37:38] all of the things that you have gone
[2:37:39] through
[2:37:44] all of the things that you have gone
[2:37:45] through when you reflect on the entire
[2:37:48] year
[2:37:49] what kind of for inspiration is it
[2:37:51] bringing to you
[2:37:55] praise the Lord
[2:37:58] you know like Bertram said we don't wait
[2:38:00] for the end of the year and start making
[2:38:01] New Year resolution no
[2:38:04] what push us in the coming year
[2:38:07] is all that we have gone through this
[2:38:09] year
[2:38:11] as we sit back and reflect on these
[2:38:13] things
[2:38:15] praise the Lord
[2:38:19] what are we drawing our courage from
[2:38:25] some of the things that we are dealing
[2:38:27] with
[2:38:31] some of the things that might have
[2:38:33] looked like uh uh discouraging moment in
[2:38:37] our lives was just God wanting you to
[2:38:40] sit down and pay attention
[2:38:46] he just wanted you to sit down
[2:38:50] and have a moment with him
[2:38:54] because since there is nothing too high
[2:38:56] for the god that we serve
[2:38:59] what situation we are dealing with in
[2:39:01] our life that God that that God can take
[2:39:03] take over
[2:39:06] if we talk about God that opened the
[2:39:08] rare seed
[2:39:13] with uh with uh pharaoh and his uh uh
[2:39:17] Horseman behind those people
[2:39:19] they are walking on their feet
[2:39:26] 40 years in the wilderness and God
[2:39:28] sustained it even their clothes
[2:39:32] then what situation we are dealing with
[2:39:34] that God cannot change
[2:39:42] praise the Lord
[2:39:46] one of our problems brother Brandon
[2:39:48] reminding us is that uh you know we are
[2:39:50] looking to God
[2:39:52] when actually God has raised us up in
[2:39:54] this hour and he's looking to you and
[2:39:57] myself
[2:40:03] we are waiting on God when God is just
[2:40:05] wanting you to put that word into action
[2:40:09] just put that word into action
[2:40:13] say Lord I know that this is your word I
[2:40:16] know this is where I'm going to stand on
[2:40:17] this word
[2:40:18] I'm going to do exactly what your word
[2:40:20] says
[2:40:32] we know right from I mean all true or
[2:40:34] all through the Book of Judges there
[2:40:36] something life brought out such a
[2:40:40] revelation that it was it was the
[2:40:42] anointing of the law that was making the
[2:40:44] difference whenever the anointing comes
[2:40:46] on him he could he could pick up again
[2:40:48] and that was the same thing with all of
[2:40:51] the people in the Book of Judges it was
[2:40:53] whenever the spirit of the Lord comes
[2:40:55] upon them
[2:40:56] God comes and blessed their courage
[2:41:00] female like Gideon how scary he was
[2:41:05] when they say when he said somebody
[2:41:06] that's a cow God God proved to him he
[2:41:09] said no I want another sign again Lord
[2:41:12] okay the woo has gone wet let it get dry
[2:41:14] you know he carried God through all of
[2:41:17] this
[2:41:18] but yet God was looking at the fear that
[2:41:22] Gideon had but yet God called him a
[2:41:26] Mighty Man
[2:41:27] of yellow
[2:41:31] so all of those characters they had an
[2:41:34] area
[2:41:36] where God's strength
[2:41:38] was made perfect
[2:41:45] they make themselves available
[2:41:49] God was able to step on this
[2:41:52] sick and use what seems to be a weak
[2:41:56] area in their life
[2:42:02] think about it tonight
[2:42:04] you will never want to take a man like
[2:42:06] that
[2:42:07] to set him as a leader
[2:42:12] but he got down there
[2:42:14] he used the deaca right through the
[2:42:16] king's stomach set him in his chair
[2:42:20] locked the door went through
[2:42:23] and he was gone
[2:42:25] the Lord gathered him watch over him
[2:42:28] protect you until he was gone
[2:42:34] and then also he grew the courage to go
[2:42:36] and call the rest of his brothers
[2:42:39] say come and see what the Lord has done
[2:42:45] courage when God
[2:42:48] take him
[2:42:50] if a weakness
[2:42:54] taking something that looks like a
[2:42:55] disability
[2:42:57] no excuse
[2:43:01] the life of excuse It's not wanted of
[2:43:04] the Gospel
[2:43:11] praise the Lord
[2:43:17] that's where my heart was tonight
[2:43:20] that's where my heart was tonight
[2:43:23] to kind of encourage you so I mean it's
[2:43:27] just it's just not to thank the Lord as
[2:43:30] we thank the Lord for his goodness we
[2:43:32] thank the Lord for his grace and his
[2:43:34] love and mercy but also what I wanted us
[2:43:37] to do is to be able to look at
[2:43:41] those areas where it looks like they are
[2:43:44] discouragement to us
[2:43:46] and we think that
[2:43:48] should have been better than this
[2:43:51] I believe that you can do better than
[2:43:54] that that's what I believe
[2:43:56] I think I should have been Above This
[2:44:00] I mean I've been I've been hanging
[2:44:02] around this mountain too long
[2:44:07] praise the Lord
[2:44:09] and all of all of my my experience
[2:44:12] around the message what uh uglet or
[2:44:14] whatever it is some people have gone
[2:44:16] through terrible terrible things sat on
[2:44:20] a wrong Ministry wrong impression and
[2:44:22] different things they have gone through
[2:44:23] but all of those things that God has
[2:44:26] taken us through yet his grace has kept
[2:44:29] us
[2:44:34] and sometimes the other things
[2:44:37] they were just that would just spring
[2:44:39] out of you
[2:44:40] says man God has been so good to me
[2:44:47] it will just spring out
[2:44:49] give you such a faith and you don't you
[2:44:51] realize it's just been lying there
[2:44:54] he just need courage
[2:44:58] just need you to be courageous
[2:45:07] praise the Lord
[2:45:10] like I've said before the early church
[2:45:12] their emphasis
[2:45:15] was on the raising Christ among them
[2:45:21] that was their emphasis
[2:45:24] their emphasis was to see the very same
[2:45:27] thing that that was in Jesus ministry to
[2:45:30] see it manifesting among them
[2:45:32] there was the emphasis of the early
[2:45:34] church
[2:45:48] I mean since I realized that they have
[2:45:51] just changed changed my my mind a little
[2:45:55] bit of the way that I look at sometimes
[2:45:57] the subject
[2:45:59] sometimes people we try to make an
[2:46:01] emphasis you know love
[2:46:04] now one time the world will spare out
[2:46:06] there in the book of Acts
[2:46:09] now that they did not love one another
[2:46:11] the Bible says they saw their things
[2:46:13] they brought it to the feet of the
[2:46:14] apostle
[2:46:16] but you see their emphasis was not just
[2:46:19] on
[2:46:20] you know uh trying to make one another
[2:46:23] feel good
[2:46:28] their emphasis was
[2:46:30] Jesus Christ
[2:46:33] living in their mess
[2:46:36] because they saw the resurrected Christ
[2:46:40] they saw him
[2:46:44] the Bible says all their eyes behold
[2:46:46] while he ascended
[2:46:48] and they they now want they never wanted
[2:46:51] that thing to leave them
[2:46:56] they wanted that image they wanted the
[2:46:59] feeling they wanted the atmosphere to
[2:47:00] stay with them all the time
[2:47:08] I pray that God will be able to give us
[2:47:10] some courage
[2:47:12] for us to be able to step out
[2:47:16] a sons of God as daughter of God we can
[2:47:19] I mean we can see things we can complain
[2:47:21] we can have an argument about how this
[2:47:24] state is not right
[2:47:26] and how this other one is not right and
[2:47:29] things must not be like that
[2:47:33] but the courage to go out
[2:47:36] and do something about it
[2:47:40] the courage to be able to step forward
[2:47:46] and do something about it
[2:47:51] the musicians can come tonight

[3:54:50] the Lord I mean if if we you we can just
[3:54:53] create an atmosphere and go around the
[3:54:55] room and just be able to see an error in
[3:54:58] our life where we need God to step into
[3:55:02] where we need God to step into
[3:55:05] that's what I'm talking about tonight
[3:55:08] that's the closeness that we want from
[3:55:10] him the courage to be able to say Lord I
[3:55:14] need you
[3:55:15] Lord I need you
[3:55:22] I need you
[3:55:26] Lord you know I need another touch let's
[3:55:28] sing there before we go back into
[3:55:30] praying
[3:55:35] Lord you know I need a brand new touch
[3:55:41] my strength yesterday
[3:55:44] my strength from yesterday
[3:55:48] is gone
[3:55:52] but if you give me another touch
[3:55:55] but if you give me Lord
[3:55:59] and not a touch
[3:56:04] I would have the strength to carry it
[3:56:10] all
[3:56:13] let's sing that one more time
[3:56:15] Lord you know I need a brand new touch
[3:56:23] straight from yesterday
