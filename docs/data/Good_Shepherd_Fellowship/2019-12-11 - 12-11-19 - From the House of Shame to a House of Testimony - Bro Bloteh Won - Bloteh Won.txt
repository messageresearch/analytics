Bibles over to st. John chapter 4 praise the Lord be having the little thought on my mind a many means in John chapter 4 tonight praise the Lord amen and as that's what we need to do since we need more prayer in house he men I've been praying God pulled down the spirit of supplication on these people let them be praying at the back of their wheel sprain in their kitchen let tears be dropping in a Superman there might be brief some good ingredients you can guess we're just praying today some tea has gone in the phone but if you were not praying then you'll be telling lies amen praise the Lord in John chapter 4 it's a familiar story that we all know but I want I just want to pick up a little thought here tonight I've been kind of a thinking on this I was I was driving one time and they start drop on my mind I want to talk a little bit from the house of shame to the house of testimony amen moving from the house of shame to the house of testimony praise the laws in John chapter 4 and just for the scripture reading tonight verse 5 then cometh he to the city of Samaria which is called Sychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob well was there Jesus therefore being weary with his journey sat dust on the well and it was about the sixth hour the Lord bless you may have you see Amen let's continue to read there come at a woman of Samaria to draw water and jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciple would gone away on to the city to buy meat then cheese then then said a woman of the world then said the woman of Samaria unto Him how is it that thou being a Jews acts dream of me which I'm a woman of Samira praise the Lord and every time I think about this I think about the effect of a generation problem amen the world this woman said this because of what she has heard she was not there when the Jews and the Samaritan separated but because of what she heard on the news and her parents seen in the different things a kind of a bill they are feeling in her even though she was a daughter of Abraham amen she was a seed of God praise the Lord standing right before her Messiah but year because of how much this earthly world affect us sometimes and sometimes we come so close and but we we are affected you know we lean on the same times we you know we think about the past and all of these things praise the Lord let's just read a little bit down jesus answered and said unto her if they are lower the gift of God and woo it it is that said unto give me to drink they I would have acts of him and he who have given the living water and the woman said said unto Him sir they have nothing to draw with and the well is deep from things then have Dow that living water that greater than our Father Jacob which gave us the well and and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle how much important there was to gain praise the Lord that was Jacob's Well they could identify themselves back to the promise of Abraham he men because they had they had a witness of Jacob's Well India myths now what I wanted to pick up tonight is their Jesus the scriptures say in verse 6 and that Jesus therefore being weary of his joining he sat doors on the world and it was about the sixth hour that was about the evening time he meant now brother Branham picked there from there to be able to give us a kind of a story or a vision of this woman life because of the colourful life that she was living she had to wait for the evening time she had to wait when all the young the married women and all the virgins and all the nice people the college graduates and every one of them go to draw their water she had to wait for the evening time praise the Lord so in in all or through the day she stay in the house of shame because of the lifestyle that she was living praise the Lord she was in the house of shame she could not associate with with with with the women of her age and even though she was she was a Samaritan living in Samara but because of the life because of her policy of her five men going through her life amen promising her that they will marry her and they disappear in III I just don't believe that you know justjust like brother branham said he top it with the church age he said every age because the age the church is a type of the womb of a woman he says like every woman is born a virgin he said every age was was virgin to God amen when that when the denominational doctrines increased are coming into the age that's when the age was defined but when God started dealing with the messenger of every age it was on the pure virgin word of god praise the law and that is the way every child was born every child was born a virgin unto God until one day they told a lie or restore something or they did something wrong that affected the spirit even though we were born in sin shipler in iniquity not I was saying that our parents in are we together Amen so so she was she was born she I mean she never just grew up right there than thinking about just running around with men and just you know living any kind of a lie something happen amen something happened somebody destroy her trust somebody broke her trust praise the Lord and whenever Trust is breaking people goes into a house of shame praise the Lord this and this and this woman this young pretty girl if she was not ready five men will not be running after her amen praise the Lord they were all attract her to her beauty her beauty the beauty that would say I perceive that you are a prophet that's beautiful when a person can perceive that this is the truth when a person can be able to perceive that this is the Word of God this is not church grease it's not just to be identified with a church but this is the Word of God that's the most beautiful thing that can happen to an individual some people just want to be they just want to be part of a church but it can perceive anything today everything is it's not different churches Church but there is something in the heart of a son of God or a daughter of God when they see the beauty of truth even if it condemned him it's beautiful praise the Lord I mean when you when you follow the composition she's talking with Jesus that gave me water you don't have nothing to draw and sad you have nothing to draw in are you greater than our Father jesus said unto her verse 13 whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whatsoever drinketh of the other water - I give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life praise the Lord he's talking about water talking about everlasting life and seeing this woman in her condition trying to sneak out and sneak right back into her shame but there was something in her when he says something ever everlasting life she says sir give me that water that is the beauty of the child of God the thing that attracts you to a lie beyond this life the thing that attracts you that convince you that this world is not your home that's the most beautiful thing that can ever happen to you are we together tonight sure give me this water and how we did that our church that neither come hither it's sneaking out and sneaking back in if I can just have that water that would be in me that would bring satisfaction jesus said go call the husband Jesus sent her right back to her shame it's becoming good tonight amen that's what happened when the people begins to pray praise the Lord then the preacher can preach effortless it's your prayer that is preaching to you tonight and I mean praise the Lord go and call your husband and come hither my goodness talking about he just told me something interest something so I can just lock myself in I don't have to come to this well and draw it anymore because she's looking over her shoulder when she comes in and she goes straight to the well because all in her mind they are looking at me I wonder what they are saying praise the Lord so she wanted this water world she can she can just she can just stay right in her Sheen but no Jesus wanted to take her from the house of shame to the house of testimony praise the Lord and that's what he want to do to you tonight amen that's what he want to do that's the reason why he redeem us to take us from the house of shame because our first birth put us in the house of shame praise the Lord and until we meet Jesus we will leave the rest of our life in the house of shame we just be looking for a time to slip out quickly and come back praise the Lord we can do when you are in the house of shame you don't do things in confidence because you are always considering what other people are thinking even if nobody is looking your mind tell you somebody is looking at me you can never do anything in confidence praise the Lord if you if you are doing anything that you have to look over your shoulder before you do it and there's a problem there is some kind of a confidence problem praise the Lord oh there was something that you don't want for somebody to see or nobody to look at you or who's looking praise the Lord go call your husband I believe she might have just to back everything I was trying to hide the very thing that put me into this situation he goes right there amen because if you if you kill the head of the serpent an entire body would die you deal with the problem right from the head he went right to the problem because he was just not he was just now playing games with her he said I must go by the will of Samira it was a daughter of Abraham in Samara he wanted to bring her out of shame and I believe that's what God is doing he's not playing games with our life praise the Lord God sent this message to give you confidence because it tells you where you were where you came from and where we are going back to that's why God sent a prophet to give you a life of confidence that's why he promised the Holy Ghost people can brag about their degrees they can brag about their school the goal they can brag about how much money they are paid in but if you know that's the Son of God that you have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and they want to intimidate you on the job and are intimidated all my goodness if you just know how much you caring how much you are contributing to this word praise the Lord he went right down there to to the problem go and call your husband and a woman answered and said I have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast said they have well said I have no husband praise the Lord they have well said I have no husband for there have five husband and he won't they are now had is near the Houseman praise the Lord indeed they were there truly amen praise Lord yes there's that's the identification of a child of God because that's that's what he promised to the church the Spirit of Truth all in our you know our our mistakes in and and foolish things we get ourself involved in there's a spirit of truth there are predestinated see is a spirit of truth that's the thing that condemns you that's the thing that convicts you because in you where you know and you know and praise Lord you are you are stammering and seeing or there because truth is boiling inside and the woman said unto him sir I perceive amen praise the Lord I perceive the very same thing that happened to the Shimon our woman when she saw the Prophet passing she perceived that were perceived it's a word beyond the ordinary I mean it's a word it's almost like a visionary word praise the Lord now like a vision from the Lord but it's almost like an envision you know like you close your eyes and then you start to see someone I perceive and this time you're now looking with your your eyes is your praise the Lord the one that the little children says the devil was telling me to take it back and answer and something was telling me not to take it you perceive from your soul yeah this is the truth praise the Lord I mean now you see that that did not have anything to do with her physical condition even if she was right from the bed of adultery that didn't have anything to do with her physical condition praise the Lord Jesus never give it to her - you always had it she needed the right moment she needed that time for that thing to come up she needed to be in the environment praise the Lord if people would just keep themselves in an environment of reading God's Word praying being in fellowship that God that is in you will come out praise the Lord oh it looks like oh that DA that brother it looks like he loved the Lord and sometimes people just look like he lost I wonder how to do it they just keep himself in the right atmosphere amen that's all she needed start talking about Jacobs well I perceive high-profit praise the Lord she never went home to take shower she was not in her best dress she never even knew he was coming she were caught right in that state I perceived you our prophet our father taught us Russian she's going right into the scriptures the word praise the Lord we're branches word that you feel when you read that word and makes it with faith and every time you say amen to the word the word that you feed on one of these days who realize that it will materialize and become real praise the Lord but then you might be needed out there are we together now so we realize you she said our Father shares you know we should wash if she's now she started to wash it well what is happing to ride him the atmosphere has changed for her to perceive that he was a prophet she starts to feel the sense of holiness she wants to start worshipping praise the Lord but what is trying to hold her back from worshiping is hashim all the things that she knows she have done all the things that are the life that she knows trying to hold her back but but worship is coming from inside of her praise the Lord and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father praise the Lord he worshipped you know network amen then Jesus got in it you know talking about worshiping or there well you see what happened he have exposure to the atmosphere liber Branham call it contacting hot spirit he mean and she was able to allow Jesus to come into her house of shame which Jesus said go and call your husband he never started becoming arrogant and trying to be defensive praise the Lord she said I have no husband now you might look at that and think yeah well well Jesus said she was living with a man so she lied to the Lord she was caught up trapped into a situation praise the Lord but yes she was able to open up and allow Jesus to come into her house of shame remember birdman talked about those in doors he said they are setting those we will not want to allow him to come into but he want to come into every dose of our lives praise the Lord he want to come coming in you know that's there that's that's the kind of a man he he was like I was preaching last Wednesday it's only the the one that is him that don't need a physician he took my tea right down there and he started eating with publicans and sinners he were identified himself praise the Lord there is no way that he's embarrassed to enter that is the reason why you know you find people you know pray Lord you know you know my problem he yes he knows but he want you to invite him into their problem talk about it talk about it call the problem by name it has a name it has a name call the problem by name when you call the problem by name you are inviting him into it in a human mind we change that all my goodness you know what this this this thing is you know what it says it's so it's so abominable it's almost like the Bible says you know what if we are guilty one we are guilty you know so if you're taught is guilted about thinking about it your Moffatt must be guilty about talking about it but that is the way to bring him into it it's not embarrass that's the reason why he could sit right there in Simon house and that woman can come in and and and fall right there and start praying is that he was not embarrassed the people that were looking the spectators were embarrassed but he was not embarrassed and sometimes that's what the devil does he makes us embarrassed of our situation thinking that you know making us to believe that no you can bring that thing to God no you can be in that situation and go to the house of God while he's trying to do keep you in the house of shame praise the Lord Jesus said God is a spirit and did a worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth praise the Lord amen oh my goodness I can I can imagine Jesus saying all of these things and then and she's she's she Feeny forgetting about her embarrassment she's just feeling good amen God is spirited I worship him must worship Him in spirit and in truth she dropped anything I know the Messiah cometh praise the Lord she never said this thing wishing feet I know them as I cam II know I know the Messiah cometh which is called Christ and he would tell us about these things the word should make you aside you must be happy for the things that you know and the things that you believe see with excitement now with guessing praise the Lord that is the reason why when Jesus said I just speak it unto you I am here the Bible said running from the house of cheem the woman that were just watching watching who's watching would I mean she was brick she broke loose praise the Lord she broke loose come and see the man I have told me all the things that I've done she's not even afraid to talk about all the things that she have done she's not a friend to seen it because she has stepped out of the house at the house of shame now she in the
