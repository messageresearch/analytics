[47:06] crossing jordan and positionally placing
[47:10] and uh
[47:11] [Music]
[47:14] so we would like to just stay on that
[47:16] taught read something from uh
[47:18] from the word like we did and also
[47:21] from uh uh
[47:23] from the prophet
[47:24] uh message
[47:26] and uh on ephesian parallel joshua
[47:30] and then we will ask uh
[47:32] trust that the law will be just be able
[47:34] to take a thought from there i will i
[47:36] won't love to keep you very long so
[47:38] you'll be able to drive and get uh home
[47:41] before
[47:42] uh the fullness of
[47:45] the snow of the night comes so
[47:51] now but uh
[47:53] uh
[47:54] like brother branham said and we all
[47:57] know we read that a little bit how how
[48:00] the book of ephesians parallel the book
[48:02] of joshua
[48:03] and and we were talking about this uh uh
[48:07] position on employing
[48:09] now where i was trying to go with this
[48:11] thought and and wanted to encourage
[48:14] encourage you
[48:15] is to realize that uh
[48:18] [Music]
[48:20] even the old god
[48:22] uh uh
[48:24] promised the children of israel you know
[48:26] give them that land and uh through the
[48:28] promise he gave to their father abraham
[48:31] but we realized that
[48:33] they had to fight for every inch of
[48:35] ground
[48:36] praise the lord and that's what i want
[48:39] to to to encourage us
[48:42] uh you know that's what i want to
[48:44] encourage us
[48:46] that
[48:46] that god will be able to give us grace
[48:49] that we will be able to to fight
[48:52] for every inch of ground praise the lord
[48:56] uh uh
[48:59] sunday morning we we spoke a little bit
[49:02] and talking about how god
[49:04] uh
[49:05] uh
[49:07] from from the from the birthstone of the
[49:10] mothers of israel have their naming and
[49:13] you know their inheritance their
[49:15] position was already declared
[49:18] jacob comes and then he he prophesied
[49:21] about his sons placing them into the
[49:24] promise
[49:25] you see so the thing the thing that
[49:27] thought about it there is the
[49:29] the father he will represent god our
[49:32] father the mother will represent our our
[49:35] birth in the church when we come to the
[49:37] knowledge of truth yeah there are there
[49:40] are some things i was just reading
[49:42] something in the in the office
[49:44] i wanted to go in that direction i says
[49:46] no you know these are some of the things
[49:48] where you get in and then you start
[49:49] preaching the whole series
[49:51] but uh
[49:53] [Music]
[49:55] what i was actually looking at and
[49:58] that caught my attention is that thing
[50:01] about the prodigal son tonight just
[50:03] before we get into what i want to share
[50:05] with you when you think about the story
[50:07] of the prodigal son
[50:08] you realize that he grew in his uh in
[50:11] his father's house and and he had uh
[50:15] you know made to take care of him and
[50:17] you know the father gave him the best
[50:19] but you realize that he really never
[50:22] knew himself
[50:23] all the time he was in the father house
[50:26] he really never
[50:28] taught
[50:28] or ever imagined himself eating in the
[50:31] pig pan
[50:35] he never imagined himself going without
[50:38] a meal
[50:41] he might have experienced the love of
[50:44] his father
[50:45] in a different way
[50:48] but he had never experienced the mercy
[50:51] of his father
[50:52] because remember you got to remember
[50:55] that he thought in his mind i'm going
[50:57] back to my father as a seven
[51:01] now realizing that he can never lost his
[51:04] son's shape
[51:07] you see
[51:08] he he never did lost his sonship but
[51:11] there are things that uh uh uh he lost
[51:14] his position from being the pr a prince
[51:17] here you see he was feeling peaks
[51:22] okay that's what brother branham would
[51:23] call living honor our privilege
[51:28] as children of god
[51:30] now we realize that i mean uh
[51:33] [Music]
[51:35] 2022 is here we don't know what the year
[51:37] holds but we know him the whole time in
[51:40] eternity
[51:41] that's where our joy is praise the lord
[51:45] but uh uh i mean there there are
[51:48] different things that law might allow
[51:51] to happen or different things the law
[51:53] might allow us to go through
[51:55] and but we we believe that every trial
[51:58] that he reports in our way the scripture
[52:02] says he will be there to see us true
[52:05] but what what we want to prepare our
[52:08] ourself for uh you know when and
[52:11] trusting that the grace of god will be
[52:13] able to help us to realize that we have
[52:16] a position just like paul says here
[52:19] paul
[52:20] brother branham says ephesians paralyzed
[52:22] joshua now uh joshua placed the people
[52:25] into their natural promise
[52:28] now paul is placing the church into her
[52:31] spiritual promise but see the way that
[52:34] he's doing it
[52:36] he's taking the church i wonder i will
[52:38] take you through the book of efficient
[52:40] if i can be able to do it quickly before
[52:42] my teddy meetings is out
[52:44] and
[52:46] you will see him he's taking the church
[52:48] right from the mind of god
[52:51] amen
[52:52] he's taking the church from heavenly
[52:55] places he's talking about
[52:57] uh
[52:58] uh
[53:00] what was in the mind of god even before
[53:03] we were ever born
[53:05] and uh uh
[53:08] he had blessed us with all spiritual
[53:10] blessing in heavenly places in christ
[53:13] jesus
[53:16] i call him as he has choosing us before
[53:19] the foundation of the word
[53:22] praise the lord
[53:24] you see there's there's uh he has
[53:26] choosing us before the foundation of the
[53:28] world that we
[53:29] should be holy with our blame before him
[53:33] in love now that's what brother branham
[53:35] would call the picture that god took of
[53:38] us
[53:40] in his mind
[53:43] so paul is bringing us
[53:46] all the way from there
[53:48] and he's going to bring us now
[53:50] into our our our natural birth and then
[53:55] he's going to bring us into the church
[53:57] we'll we will see that a little bit here
[54:00] now so brother branham said this let's
[54:02] just read this uh from the ephesian
[54:04] parallel joshua
[54:06] he says
[54:12] that this book of ephesians perfectly
[54:14] parallel the old testament joshua
[54:17] ephesian the book of efficient the book
[54:20] of efficient draw is together
[54:23] positionally placed the church now i
[54:27] have typed it with joshua if you notice
[54:30] israel was brought up out of egypt
[54:35] and there's three stages in the
[54:38] adjoining
[54:40] the first stage
[54:42] was leaving egypt the next stage was in
[54:46] the wilderness and then the next stage
[54:48] was over in canaan he says now canada
[54:51] does not represent the age of the
[54:54] millennium it only represents the age of
[54:58] the overcomers
[55:01] now so that's where the focus is
[55:04] if we represent the age of the
[55:06] overcomers then there are things that we
[55:09] need to overcome
[55:11] there are things that we will overcome
[55:14] praise the lord
[55:16] not only that we need to overcome but
[55:18] there are things that we will overcome
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:27] because the power is not in yourself the
[55:29] power is in the word
[55:35] praise the lord
[55:36] so can a year represent the age of the
[55:39] overcomer the dispensation of overcoming
[55:47] the dispensation of overcoming
[55:54] because in canada they killed and burned
[55:58] and took cities and there will be no
[56:00] death in the millennium but
[56:02] another thing that it does it brings up
[56:07] justification by faith
[56:09] after they believed in moses and left
[56:13] egypt sanctification
[56:15] following under the pillow of fire and
[56:18] the atonement of the sacrificial line in
[56:21] the wilderness and then entering into
[56:24] the land that has been promised
[56:28] now
[56:29] what is
[56:31] the lane
[56:32] told the new testament believer the land
[56:36] the promise is the holy ghost the holy
[56:39] spirit
[56:40] praise the lord
[56:43] and he says also this he says did you
[56:45] know this joshua before
[56:47] the cross jordan
[56:49] joshua said go through the mess of the
[56:52] camp and claim your cloth and sanctify
[56:56] every one of you let no man come at his
[56:59] wife within three days you will see the
[57:02] glory of god
[57:05] so it's that place of sincerity that we
[57:08] started talking on
[57:10] on the wash night before we came over to
[57:12] sunday you know uh uh uh because that
[57:15] that was the portion that inverted
[57:17] brandon's vision about uh if you can be
[57:20] sincere you know that's the only way he
[57:23] could escape the second bite you know
[57:25] that's the only way he could rebuke the
[57:27] serpent and they get away from the
[57:28] people if he will be sincere
[57:31] so uh you know so that that is just out
[57:34] of there that we're trying to prepare
[57:36] ourselves to you know trying to put our
[57:38] mind on and
[57:41] so he says
[57:43] you will see the glory of god
[57:46] it is process of getting ready to
[57:50] inherit
[57:52] the promise
[57:54] praise the lord
[57:56] amen
[57:57] to inherit the promise and i tell you
[58:00] young people don't tell
[58:02] the god of heaven
[58:04] make
[58:05] this word
[58:07] real to you
[58:09] amen
[58:10] we can have good music we can have you
[58:14] know good church and good people around
[58:16] us but until god
[58:19] make this world make this message real
[58:22] to you that's the thing that will hold
[58:24] you in the hour of temptation
[58:27] it has to be a person
[58:30] you have to see
[58:31] jesus christ coming from out of the
[58:34] world it's not just the message i mean
[58:36] the message no it has to be the person
[58:40] of jesus christ
[58:44] praise the lord
[58:45] especially with all the things that are
[58:47] happening around
[58:49] and and in in in all the the you know
[58:51] the the confusion and and you know and
[58:55] disappointment and everything that is
[58:56] hopping around i mean it has to be
[59:00] jesus christ making himself real to each
[59:03] and every one of us
[59:06] because he's a living god amen
[59:09] he's a living god
[59:11] living among his people
[59:13] so here we see
[59:15] we see paul
[59:17] let me go back and forth a little bit
[59:20] now we read here in
[59:23] ephesians
[59:25] 1
[59:26] verse 3 again blessed
[59:29] be the god and father of our our lord
[59:32] jesus christ who have blessed us
[59:35] with all spiritual blessing
[59:38] in heavenly places
[59:41] praise the lord
[59:42] amen
[59:44] now let's go to ephesians chapter six
[1:00:01] let's go to ephesians chapter six
[1:00:17] i think i've shared that with you before
[1:00:21] now in ephesians chapter six
[1:00:26] or having
[1:00:30] that should be verse 10.
[1:00:35] having my two
[1:00:49] actually in verse 12.
[1:00:53] ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 for we rise
[1:00:56] or not against flesh and blood
[1:00:58] but against principality against power
[1:01:03] against the ruler of darkness of this
[1:01:06] world against spiritual weakness
[1:01:10] in high places
[1:01:12] now so the same word that is used for
[1:01:15] heavenly places
[1:01:17] is the same word that is used for high
[1:01:20] places
[1:01:22] praise the lord
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:24] let me show you something also
[1:01:27] isaiah chapter 12.
[1:01:38] isaiah chapter 12 or chapter 14
[1:01:45] isaiah chapter 14.
[1:01:55] now this is just an hesitation tonight
[1:02:01] we know isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 is
[1:02:04] familiar how are thou falling from
[1:02:05] heaven oh lucifer son of the morning
[1:02:09] how are they cut down to the ground
[1:02:13] which did weaken the nation
[1:02:16] for thou have said in the heart i will
[1:02:19] ascend
[1:02:21] into heaven i will exalt my throne above
[1:02:24] the stars of god
[1:02:26] i will sit
[1:02:28] also
[1:02:29] upon the mount of the congregation
[1:02:32] in the sides
[1:02:34] of the north
[1:02:36] praise the lord
[1:02:37] now watch that position now
[1:02:40] lucifer the son of the morning
[1:02:42] the one that turned to be
[1:02:44] the devil the second
[1:02:46] and uh he's desiring expressing that
[1:02:49] desire to sit in the side of the north
[1:02:51] let's go to the book of sam
[1:03:03] psalm chapter 48
[1:03:14] psalm chapter 48.
[1:03:21] let's read from verse one great is the
[1:03:23] lord and greatly to be praised
[1:03:26] in the city of our god
[1:03:29] in the mountain of his holiness
[1:03:32] beautiful situation
[1:03:34] the joy of the whole earth
[1:03:38] is mount zion on the side of the north
[1:03:45] did something catch your attention
[1:03:50] praise the lord
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] is that not the same side of the nerf
[1:04:00] that lucifer says i was sent to heaven
[1:04:04] and i will sit in the side of the nerf
[1:04:09] and yet david is identifying
[1:04:13] that the side of the nerf is the city of
[1:04:16] the great king
[1:04:21] praise the lord so you see it's the same
[1:04:23] thing here also inefficient
[1:04:26] paul is saying all your spiritual
[1:04:28] blessing
[1:04:30] is in heavenly places
[1:04:32] but yet it's the same place
[1:04:35] where spiritual weakness
[1:04:37] principalities
[1:04:44] you see that's the reason why brother
[1:04:45] branham says we we we're not we're not
[1:04:47] in the picnic people
[1:04:51] we are in the battlefield
[1:05:01] we are in the battlefield
[1:05:07] i mean we we don't have to experience
[1:05:09] some of the worst things that other
[1:05:11] people have experienced drugs and and
[1:05:13] and different things in their lives
[1:05:16] before we realize that that there is a
[1:05:18] devil i think so far now you must know
[1:05:20] that there is a devil
[1:05:30] praise the lord
[1:05:36] now young people this is this is really
[1:05:38] for you yeah are you are you seeing the
[1:05:40] picture are you seeing the comparison
[1:05:45] or should we read that scripture again
[1:05:48] did something cut your attention you see
[1:05:50] that's that's how when you read the
[1:05:51] bible it's it's not a newspaper you know
[1:05:54] you you read the scripture you are
[1:05:55] looking you you are listening and you
[1:05:58] and you see things like that come on you
[1:06:00] say wait now
[1:06:03] i read this thing somewhere
[1:06:05] the side of the north
[1:06:19] you think about it just like israel in
[1:06:21] their natural promise god give uh you
[1:06:24] know uh uh told abraham bless him i will
[1:06:27] bless you
[1:06:29] you know i i will bless your seeds uh uh
[1:06:33] uh like the stars of heaven like the
[1:06:35] sand by the sea show you know i will
[1:06:38] bless you and we ever you know curses
[1:06:40] you will be cursed we ever bless you
[1:06:42] will be blessed
[1:06:49] but you see even the land i was giving
[1:06:52] for them they had to fight for every
[1:06:54] inch of ground
[1:06:56] even though it was their lane it was
[1:06:58] given to them god promised it to abraham
[1:07:01] your seed shall sow john into strange
[1:07:04] land i will bring he said i will bring
[1:07:06] them back
[1:07:10] but yet they have to fight
[1:07:13] for every inch of ground
[1:07:20] you have the spiritual blessing like
[1:07:22] paul says right here inefficient
[1:07:25] when god took a picture of you
[1:07:27] it was for you to be holy
[1:07:29] without blame
[1:07:36] praise the lord
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] now you are a my my trigger in the back
[1:07:42] of your mind but then why am i born and
[1:07:45] singing
[1:07:48] why am i born in sin why did i come to
[1:07:51] the word speaking lies
[1:07:58] the reason is is because
[1:08:00] god is going to take you through a
[1:08:02] journey
[1:08:03] to bring you back to what he had
[1:08:06] of you in his mind
[1:08:08] he's going to take you through a journey
[1:08:12] because the picture that he took of you
[1:08:14] was had nothing to do with your first
[1:08:17] birth
[1:08:19] so now your first birth is going to be
[1:08:21] the beginning of that journey for you to
[1:08:23] go back to that picture he had of you in
[1:08:26] his mind
[1:08:27] that's the reason why you know uh uh he
[1:08:31] will require you to be born again that's
[1:08:33] the reason why he will require you to
[1:08:35] confess your sin receive the holy ghost
[1:08:38] you know get closer to god
[1:08:40] and let god change your life and all of
[1:08:42] that because
[1:08:45] he took a picture of you and he can lost
[1:08:47] you
[1:08:50] praise the lord
[1:08:52] he's going to do everything to bring you
[1:08:54] back to the way he thought of you in the
[1:08:56] beginning
[1:09:02] you see when we are safe
[1:09:04] it's almost like we came from a deep
[1:09:06] slate
[1:09:07] and we don't even know where we are we
[1:09:09] are still waking up to the reality
[1:09:12] of things around us we think we know
[1:09:14] what is going on you have no idea
[1:09:17] you are still waking up
[1:09:20] to the reality
[1:09:22] of things around you
[1:09:32] in the city the sound of the not the
[1:09:34] city of the great king
[1:09:37] that's where she don't say i will i will
[1:09:39] make my seat
[1:09:42] in the side of the north
[1:09:57] he had bless you with all spiritual
[1:09:58] blessing heavenly places
[1:10:01] yet principalities power spiritual
[1:10:04] weakness
[1:10:05] in high places
[1:10:07] is your battle
[1:10:11] so you see brother branham says that's
[1:10:13] that's what the uh can mean for the
[1:10:16] believer the dispensation of overcoming
[1:10:20] they are things that we will have to we
[1:10:22] have to deal with they are things that
[1:10:24] we will have to overcome
[1:10:26] and god will give us grace to overcome
[1:10:30] praise the lord
[1:10:32] it's not by power
[1:10:34] is not by might
[1:10:37] it's by the grace of the almighty god
[1:10:40] praise the lord
[1:10:42] like i've always said whenever
[1:10:44] god is dealing with you on something is
[1:10:47] is is an opportunity god is making you a
[1:10:50] partner
[1:10:52] to be able to identify something in your
[1:10:54] life he wants you to be a partner in the
[1:10:57] process
[1:10:58] of getting he have already paid the
[1:11:00] price
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:03] he have already paid the price
[1:11:06] for our past sin our present sin our
[1:11:08] future sin he have already cashed it
[1:11:11] it's already paid
[1:11:13] but how to bring us to that place
[1:11:17] of possessing this this uh this body
[1:11:21] of living
[1:11:23] a victorious uh christian life
[1:11:27] or living a life like an adopted son
[1:11:31] or an adopted daughter
[1:11:34] praise the lord
[1:11:38] was it sounds so strange to me i was
[1:11:40] listening
[1:11:42] to well the radio preacher and he was
[1:11:44] talking about adoption
[1:11:47] he was comparing it with
[1:11:49] uh
[1:11:51] the natural adoption that we know you
[1:11:52] know go and take somebody's child no
[1:11:55] it's it's different is the father
[1:11:58] that is investing in the in the child in
[1:12:00] the son or in the daughter
[1:12:02] to be able to trust him with an
[1:12:04] inheritance
[1:12:09] see that's the reason why when you when
[1:12:11] you look at the
[1:12:13] the
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] the story of the prodigal son
[1:12:18] jesus
[1:12:20] go right back in the book of luke you
[1:12:22] will see jesus he had he had two crowds
[1:12:26] in his congregation
[1:12:30] he had the pharisees on one side
[1:12:32] and he also had the publicans on one
[1:12:35] side
[1:12:36] and he decided to throw this story about
[1:12:39] the the
[1:12:41] the practical son
[1:12:46] praise the lord
[1:12:49] for god to bring you
[1:12:51] in loudly short age
[1:12:55] he never brought man that david
[1:12:59] he never brought men and solomon solomon
[1:13:01] will have heart problems
[1:13:04] he was in the age of decency he had
[1:13:06] housing wife
[1:13:08] if he was in this age what is tripping
[1:13:09] himself naked he would just he would
[1:13:11] just get crazy and die
[1:13:18] god couldn't trust him with this age
[1:13:23] but god trusted you
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:34] oh fine brother solomon like a crazy man
[1:13:36] on the street
[1:13:41] it says sound funny but it's true
[1:13:46] and that's one thing that we can be
[1:13:48] proud of
[1:13:49] as as sons and daughters of god you know
[1:13:52] sometimes the devil just beats our head
[1:13:55] and try to make you to feel like you
[1:13:57] don't walk you know
[1:13:59] nothing good can come out of you he's
[1:14:01] doing that because he's afraid of you
[1:14:07] praise the lord he's afraid of you
[1:14:14] he know what it is when the son of god
[1:14:18] comes to recognize himself
[1:14:22] when a daughter of god comes to
[1:14:24] recognize themselves
[1:14:26] the devil know what it is
[1:14:29] to be able to trust this word of god
[1:14:32] yes
[1:14:33] he know what it is
[1:14:36] can you imagine uh jonah being caught in
[1:14:39] the in
[1:14:40] in a in the the the
[1:14:42] the belly of a well
[1:14:44] and he right in that place
[1:14:48] being swallowed by the fish
[1:14:52] and yet he's finding a way to knee down
[1:14:55] and pray
[1:15:03] and i mean and you know
[1:15:05] jonah is not he's not lord i rebuke this
[1:15:08] fish lord get me out of this fish bella
[1:15:11] lord
[1:15:12] that that's not what he's doing
[1:15:15] all he did
[1:15:17] was to be able to find a promise
[1:15:20] the lord you told solomon
[1:15:23] that whenever your people get in trouble
[1:15:28] and they get on their knees to pray
[1:15:32] and they turn their face to the holy
[1:15:34] temple
[1:15:36] you say you hear from heaven
[1:15:38] now all he did
[1:15:40] he just found a promise
[1:15:50] to realize that
[1:15:52] all
[1:15:54] the prophecy
[1:15:55] paul spoke about perilous time
[1:15:58] where man will be high-minded
[1:16:01] disobedient to parents very unthankful
[1:16:04] that that's the spirit that we're
[1:16:05] dealing with
[1:16:08] that's the spirit that we're dealing
[1:16:10] with and i'm telling telling you that uh
[1:16:13] i mean
[1:16:14] jesus sorry is going to get worse
[1:16:20] you're all about the fussing on the on
[1:16:22] the airline you hear the road rages
[1:16:25] every day somebody's people are fighting
[1:16:27] with gun brother branham say if it
[1:16:29] continues like that if every every human
[1:16:32] will pack a gun
[1:16:37] and what it is is that
[1:16:40] he says the holy ghost is living
[1:16:45] is
[1:16:46] living
[1:16:48] it's only going to be in the hearts of
[1:16:50] the believer
[1:16:55] but yet
[1:16:59] god trusted you
[1:17:01] to live in such a time like this
[1:17:06] this is the beauty
[1:17:08] of serving god
[1:17:11] it's the beauty of believing the message
[1:17:14] of the hour
[1:17:16] it's the beauty of knowing what we know
[1:17:24] to look at the time that we are living
[1:17:26] in
[1:17:28] and with everything that is happening
[1:17:31] and yet we can be in church on wednesday
[1:17:34] night
[1:17:37] there is no church bus that go around
[1:17:39] and pick everybody up and give everybody
[1:17:41] free riding you know and then when we go
[1:17:44] there and then we distribute groceries
[1:17:45] at the doorway and everybody take
[1:17:47] groceries you know and we know that our
[1:17:49] thursday is count out because we're
[1:17:51] having food to eat
[1:18:01] when you get on your knees
[1:18:04] to pray
[1:18:06] and you can be able to sing son and lift
[1:18:08] your hands to god and pick up god's word
[1:18:10] or all player tip of the prophet you
[1:18:13] must be proud in your heart
[1:18:15] to be a child of god
[1:18:21] don't be proud about your look all about
[1:18:24] your clothes have a proud in your heart
[1:18:27] to know that i'm a child of god
[1:18:43] praise the lord
[1:18:46] god is faithful
[1:18:49] he's the one that have promised
[1:18:52] and he's more than able
[1:18:55] to be able to bring us through
[1:18:59] praise lord
[1:19:02] he more than able to be able to bring us
[1:19:04] through
[1:19:06] we will have battles
[1:19:09] we will have
[1:19:12] challenges
[1:19:14] we will have problems
[1:19:17] for the matter of fact brandon 1956
[1:19:21] just imagine 1956
[1:19:26] when brother branham was about to preach
[1:19:27] the message the junction of time
[1:19:32] he said it's not going to be any better
[1:19:38] he said the only hope that i see for
[1:19:39] this word is the coming of the lord
[1:19:44] it's going to be darker
[1:19:46] darker
[1:19:48] and harder
[1:19:55] praise the lord
[1:19:59] but you see that message you read the
[1:20:01] uh the prophecy when the enemy come as a
[1:20:04] flaw
[1:20:05] the spirit of god will raise up a
[1:20:06] standard
[1:20:11] but branham says they will get it will
[1:20:13] get it will be so much of a pressure on
[1:20:15] god's people
[1:20:19] and it's just in that time
[1:20:21] the supernatural will start to break out
[1:20:29] god will start doing special things for
[1:20:31] his children
[1:20:36] all we have to do is just hold on to his
[1:20:38] name
