[37:13] we give you thanks amen and amen
[37:16] it's just so wonderful to be here once
[37:19] again this morning Saints
[37:21] why don't you all just have a seat for
[37:23] just a moment
[37:26] my goodness
[37:31] Saints we could we could walk out of
[37:33] here right now we could be dismissed and
[37:35] walk out and we've already had Church
[37:39] I I felt it from the very start this
[37:42] morning
[37:43] the presence of God I could feel it back
[37:45] in the office and don't take that in any
[37:48] way special to me what I mean is
[37:50] everyone here came with their flame of
[37:52] fire and the fire from this Sanctuary
[37:54] was so great I could feel it back there
[37:58] it's nothing special about me or special
[38:00] about the song leader but God was so
[38:04] pleased with each and every one of you
[38:06] this morning he came down with his
[38:09] presence and he's here he's here
[38:14] it tells me that all of you came ready
[38:17] you came ready to meet your God came
[38:21] ready to meet your father come and
[38:24] commune with him
[38:26] and God recognized that by coming down
[38:29] communion with you
[38:30] it doesn't have to do with the building
[38:33] it doesn't have to do with the people
[38:35] that you that are in the building has to
[38:38] do with the fact that you brought the
[38:40] presence of God with you this morning
[38:42] and he was so pleased look down on our
[38:44] worship look down on the praise they
[38:46] said I gotta go down and meet them this
[38:48] morning
[38:49] he said I can't stay away from them
[38:52] it's just too perfect
[38:55] my goodness
[38:57] we want to get a
[39:00] few formalities out of the way and just
[39:02] and then just move on with the service
[39:04] we have a visitor in our midst and
[39:06] you've um our sister Grace
[39:09] I don't know I'm probably saying that
[39:11] incorrectly but
[39:13] it's wonderful to have you here thank
[39:14] you
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:18] you feel welcome here with us
[39:20] we have a prayer request from our sister
[39:23] Bila asking prayer for her sister-in-law
[39:26] Who's down with covet her brother is
[39:28] doing well now it says thank God for his
[39:31] mercies so we see this thing and just
[39:33] moving around it no surprise to God the
[39:36] devil's got a little bit upset because
[39:39] he's lost in one spot and he'll lose
[39:41] again so let's just take a moment just
[39:43] pray for this this should be the
[39:45] sister-in-law Heavenly Father Lord we
[39:47] come before you once again this morning
[39:49] Lord you father we don't come asking
[39:53] anything amiss but we come asking upon
[39:55] your promises but he said by your
[39:58] stripes we are made whole he said if any
[40:01] two or three are gathered together in my
[40:03] name there I'll be also he said if we
[40:05] can agree upon any one thing father you
[40:08] said you'd come and
[40:09] and bring it to pass father
[40:11] so Lord we just come asking for the
[40:14] healing of sister be the sister-in-law
[40:16] this covet viruses struck her and father
[40:20] just giving her a little trouble but
[40:22] would he has asked for a full
[40:23] Deliverance father believing the Lord
[40:25] that you've already done the work father
[40:27] Lord just waiting for the praise report
[40:30] to come forth out of it we give you
[40:32] thanks for that in Jesus name amen
[40:36] you know Saints this morning I
[40:39] was sitting in the back office and
[40:42] watching and listening to your praises
[40:45] and watching brother Joshua here lead
[40:47] our service and I watched Little Grace
[40:50] Get Up and sing that song and
[40:53] you know there was such a
[40:55] sense of
[40:58] I don't want to say Pride it's maybe the
[41:00] wrong term but just such a
[41:04] oh just something about it just saying
[41:05] Lord wow look at what you have done
[41:09] I'm so glad to be that I'm able to be a
[41:12] part of this
[41:13] you know you know I was talking about
[41:16] Ariel last week and we were just talking
[41:18] about different stages that we've seen
[41:20] the church go through and coming through
[41:22] and and sometimes
[41:25] we look at ourselves right now
[41:27] and we look at our current problems and
[41:29] we're like wow I can't believe we're
[41:30] still having all these problems and this
[41:31] and that and these little things you
[41:33] know they're just a constant part of
[41:35] life and and whatnot and we get maybe a
[41:39] little bit frustrated more than we
[41:40] should because we feel like maybe
[41:42] ourselves or other people or the church
[41:44] should be in a different place
[41:46] but I we began to just talk about where
[41:50] God has brought us from
[41:52] you know not even even individually but
[41:54] even as a church
[41:56] is that
[41:58] you know I haven't been here that long
[42:00] I've just been here about four and a
[42:02] half years
[42:03] or so
[42:04] yeah even in that amount of time
[42:09] there's been such a change
[42:11] such a change
[42:13] God has done such a work here
[42:17] you know we were talking about it and we
[42:18] were saying you know
[42:21] the number of people we have here on a
[42:24] Wednesday night and this is to anyone
[42:25] who can't make it on Wednesday you work
[42:27] you're far you're distant you got
[42:28] whatever you got going on that's not it
[42:30] the point
[42:32] but the the handful of people we see
[42:33] here on a Wednesday used to be a very
[42:36] full Sunday morning
[42:39] and yet look at us here this morning
[42:43] the building's almost full
[42:45] [Music]
[42:46] that's not anything we did
[42:50] it's not any one man's achievement this
[42:54] is what God has done
[42:56] this is what God's done only God
[42:59] could bring so many different people
[43:02] from so many different places so many
[43:05] different walks of life and bring them
[43:07] together in unity in one place
[43:11] like this
[43:12] I wanted to I said a couple of we meant
[43:16] to do this
[43:17] a few years ago after covet ended and we
[43:19] thought we were going to have some
[43:20] anniversary services and things and I'm
[43:22] not going to make it very long just real
[43:24] quick I just want to make a point I sent
[43:27] three pictures to the back there
[43:30] and I took paper I took a few pictures
[43:32] of this building before we renovated
[43:36] this is the sanctuary
[43:38] for those of you who weren't here back
[43:40] then even four years ago even two years
[43:43] ago
[43:44] this is a sanctuary facing from that way
[43:47] in is the sanctuary
[43:49] keep going go to the foyer
[43:52] just one more that is what the foyer
[43:55] looked like
[43:57] you can go ahead and take it down
[43:59] you see Saints this is what happens
[44:03] when God is working
[44:05] when God is working on our lives when
[44:07] God is working on a church when God is
[44:09] working on anything
[44:11] it's no time at all
[44:13] but what someone who knew you in your
[44:16] past
[44:18] would come back to visit
[44:21] and look around
[44:22] and not be able to believe it's the same
[44:25] place they once visited before
[44:28] it's almost unrecognizable
[44:32] even to me I look at the pictures and I
[44:34] go I know I was there
[44:36] I help make the changes
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] but it's still almost like a double take
[44:45] is how is how is it even possible that
[44:48] that is the same place
[44:50] and yet that's what God is doing with
[44:52] each of us every single day
[44:54] every single moment
[44:56] so let's not forget that about ourselves
[44:58] or about the people next to us
[45:00] [Music]
[45:02] many of us are habits
[45:04] or if we remember people as they were in
[45:07] their past
[45:08] and we treat them such
[45:10] but I ask you open your eyes again take
[45:14] a good look and see what God has done
[45:17] and you'll realize
[45:19] you should be treating those people
[45:21] differently because they're not the same
[45:23] people they once were
[45:25] you're not the same person you once were
[45:27] God is working God is changing us and
[45:30] that that's just so inspired me this
[45:32] morning to look out and see
[45:35] God is working there's life in the
[45:37] church
[45:38] there's there's positive change
[45:41] happening coming it's it's it's just so
[45:45] amazing
[45:48] let's not get hung up on the fact that
[45:50] we still have things to work on
[45:53] let's focus on the fact of how far God
[45:55] has brought us
[45:57] all right
[45:59] now get off of that and move on with the
[46:02] service
[46:03] it just I love it so much I love it so
[46:06] much
[46:07] I love to see God and what God's doing
[46:11] it's just so unbelievable
[46:15] um let's sing that song One More Time
[46:17] that what was the first not the song we
[46:19] were just singing the one before brother
[46:21] Joshua
[46:22] He Knows My Name
[46:24] you can give me the words that
[46:29] help me with it Saints my singing skills
[46:33] aren't as good as some
[46:42] foreign
[46:50] [Music]

[50:43] [Music]
[50:50] when I go
[50:59] foreign thank you musicians
[51:03] [Music]
[51:04] let's just go ahead and stand for the
[51:06] reading of the word
[51:08] sayings I just want to if you can put
[51:09] that chorus back up for me real quick I
[51:11] want to point something out
[51:15] He Knows My Name
[51:18] you see
[51:20] He Knows My Name
[51:24] means that he has a personal
[51:26] relationship with you
[51:28] because he knows your name individually
[51:33] he knows your name your first name your
[51:36] middle name your last name your nickname
[51:39] he's Auto got it all down in the file
[51:43] there's many of you I may only know you
[51:45] by your first name
[51:46] I may know you by your family name
[51:50] I may not know your name at all
[51:53] but he knows all those things
[51:58] there's many a people who here today who
[52:01] have a middle name
[52:02] I may know your first name and your last
[52:04] name
[52:05] I don't have a clue what your middle
[52:06] name is
[52:08] but he knows
[52:10] he takes it very personally
[52:12] he's got it recorded down and when he
[52:15] hears
[52:16] you see here's something
[52:20] how many of you when you pray
[52:22] Lord
[52:24] you may not know who this is this is
[52:27] this is Jordan
[52:29] Eli fryjo just so you know that way you
[52:33] know who to record down
[52:36] probably not many of us
[52:37] we don't start our prayers out that way
[52:40] you know why
[52:41] because it's like this
[52:43] I spent over four and a half years here
[52:46] in customer service on the phone
[52:48] there's many a people I never met in
[52:50] person I never saw their face
[52:54] but I talked to them so often and I knew
[52:56] where they were at
[52:58] that when I heard their voice on the
[53:00] phone
[53:01] I knew their name
[53:04] they didn't have to say it
[53:07] I knew where I was calling and even
[53:10] though there was maybe 10 15 people at
[53:12] that location their voice was so
[53:14] distinct and I'd heard it so many times
[53:17] I knew exactly who I was talking to
[53:19] whether they told me or not
[53:22] boom they would answer the phone and say
[53:24] hello and I would say so and so Matthew
[53:27] and they'd be like ah
[53:30] on the other end
[53:32] I said I know your voice
[53:35] and I know your name
[53:37] and that's how God is with each of us
[53:40] that's how personal his relationship is
[53:42] with you no matter how distinct or
[53:45] indistinct you think your voice is the
[53:48] minute your voice is heard in heaven
[53:50] he hears your prayer he says aha Stephen
[53:53] Cassidy aha a brother Max uh brother
[53:57] Stephen Woods
[53:58] that's who it is
[54:00] Jordan freyjo I I hear that voice
[54:03] and all you said is Lord
[54:06] that's it
[54:08] it doesn't take him he doesn't have to
[54:10] need a whole conversation to thinking
[54:11] okay going through the database see if
[54:13] we can get a voice recognition on this
[54:15] guy oh I now I know who it is no
[54:20] first word out of your mouth
[54:22] in fact he said I know your voice so
[54:26] distinctly
[54:28] that you through your groanings I can
[54:32] identify you
[54:34] he said you may not have the words to
[54:36] pray
[54:38] but I know you so well
[54:41] that just your groanings
[54:44] through your cry
[54:46] through your tears
[54:48] any utterance you make
[54:51] I know who that is
[54:53] and I know what you're going through
[54:56] and just that enough is to bring enough
[54:58] to bring him on the scene
[55:00] that's how he knows your name now that's
[55:03] one wonderful thing
[55:05] but the next line
[55:06] he knows my every thought
[55:10] now some of us are like yeah my he knows
[55:14] what I'm thinking and thinking you know
[55:16] when I'm in my heart and I'm praying for
[55:19] other people and in my thoughts and you
[55:21] know just praying in my heart for for
[55:23] this one and that one he can hear my
[55:25] prayer that's a wonderful thing
[55:28] because you can be praying anywhere at
[55:30] all times doesn't matter what's going on
[55:32] but the more amazing thing to me is he
[55:36] knows my every thought
[55:41] every thought
[55:44] the more amazing thing to me isn't that
[55:46] he hears my prayers and he answers them
[55:49] and he recognizes them and he hears me
[55:51] and meets me where where I need him
[55:54] the more amazing thing to me is all the
[55:57] thoughts that I wish he wouldn't hear
[56:00] that he does
[56:03] and he doesn't condemn me for them
[56:07] but for those same thoughts
[56:10] he begins moving on the scene
[56:13] because he knows my every need
[56:19] it doesn't shock him
[56:21] it doesn't dissuade him it doesn't make
[56:24] him rethink his choices about me
[56:30] because he doesn't just hear my every
[56:32] thought
[56:33] he knew my every thought before I even
[56:35] thought it
[56:37] and he still
[56:39] was my maker and formed my heart
[56:43] he still was the one who said I'm going
[56:45] to make him exactly that way
[56:47] knowing the thoughts he'll have
[56:50] you you may be in yourself maybe you
[56:52] you've had some thoughts and straight
[56:55] off in places you shouldn't
[56:57] you think wow I sure don't want anybody
[56:59] to ever know about that
[57:01] and you think that you're hiding from
[57:03] God
[57:04] because you never said it out loud
[57:07] well I'll tell you what you're hiding it
[57:09] from the devil as long as you don't open
[57:10] your mouth
[57:11] brother random told us that he said the
[57:13] devil can send things to your thoughts
[57:16] but he doesn't know what you're thinking
[57:19] but God
[57:22] not only can he speak to you
[57:24] to your heart
[57:26] you see he speaks directly to your heart
[57:28] the devil can speak to your mind and you
[57:30] have to allow it to drop to your heart
[57:32] God will come and speak to your heart
[57:34] already knowing your thoughts
[57:36] before you thought them
[57:38] so don't let the devil come back to you
[57:40] after he whispered something horrible to
[57:42] you and you think it was you and tell
[57:44] you if God only knew you were thinking
[57:46] those things
[57:49] he wouldn't want anything to do with you
[57:50] let alone all those people at church
[57:55] man
[57:57] did you just put on a brave face and
[58:00] wear a really nice suit on Sunday
[58:02] smile and Shake everyone's hands and
[58:04] they won't know and you'll just be able
[58:07] to slip in and out
[58:08] but you don't belong there no way I mean
[58:11] look at the thoughts you're thinking
[58:14] some of you are maybe thinking wow how
[58:16] does he know I think that
[58:18] Saints
[58:19] I'm a man just like all of you I'm human
[58:23] I've been there
[58:25] I've been a young man
[58:27] I'm Still a Young Man compared to many
[58:30] of you yes
[58:31] in fact when I say that they're like you
[58:34] are a young man
[58:35] but I've been a a boy I've been a
[58:38] teenager I've been a part of the youth
[58:42] I know the struggles you're going
[58:44] through
[58:46] and I say my hat is off to you this
[58:48] morning
[58:49] as a youth today not even a youth of
[58:53] five years ago or ten years ago not a
[58:56] youth of just a few
[58:57] years ago what I can remember
[59:01] it wasn't that long ago for me but I
[59:03] look at the progression
[59:05] of the availability
[59:07] of The Temptations of sin
[59:11] even for me it was less
[59:15] today you can't hardly Escape it for a
[59:17] moment
[59:19] you have to be so on guard
[59:21] so on point
[59:23] you have to be so yielded to the moving
[59:25] of the holy spirit in your life
[59:27] or else just like that it'll catch you
[59:34] and the devil knows it and last Sunday
[59:36] we talked about it the raising of a
[59:37] standard and I tell you God knows what
[59:41] you're going through and he knows what
[59:42] you're facing
[59:43] don't think you're facing it alone or
[59:45] God don't know
[59:48] God knows and he has got the answer for
[59:52] you he's not here to condemn you here to
[59:55] tell you you did wrong because you
[59:57] already know if it was right or wrong
[59:59] God's here to say despite what you think
[1:00:02] you've done
[1:00:03] my grace is still enough
[1:00:06] you just have to be willing to accept it
[1:00:07] it doesn't even have to do you think
[1:00:10] well I'm not worthy yeah you're not
[1:00:12] right none of us are
[1:00:15] all right let's okay let's read the
[1:00:17] scripture I can let you have a seat
[1:00:18] instead of keep you standing the whole
[1:00:19] time
[1:00:21] um let's just start I'm going to read
[1:00:23] Malachi 3 2 through 4 and I'm going to
[1:00:26] give them a minute to get it up here for
[1:00:28] those of us who
[1:00:29] maybe don't have our Bibles readily
[1:00:31] available
[1:00:32] that way we can just all follow along
[1:00:34] and I'm ready for that
[1:00:36] Malachi 3 2 and 4.
[1:00:39] but who may abide the day of his coming
[1:00:43] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[1:00:46] for he is like a Refiner's Fire
[1:00:49] and like Fuller soap and he shall sit as
[1:00:53] a refiner and pure and purifier of
[1:00:56] silver and he shall purify the sons of
[1:00:58] Levi and purge them as gold and silver
[1:01:02] that they may offer unto the Lord an
[1:01:05] offering and righteousness then shall
[1:01:07] the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be
[1:01:10] pleasant unto the Lord as in the days of
[1:01:13] old and as in the former years let's
[1:01:16] pray Heavenly Father Lord we just
[1:01:18] dedicate ourselves back to you once
[1:01:20] again this morning asking you to come
[1:01:22] and have your way father Lord Lord has
[1:01:25] asked that you would come and meet the
[1:01:26] needs of your people father whatever
[1:01:28] that might be father you just take this
[1:01:30] service and whatever Direction you would
[1:01:33] find necessary father Lord not anything
[1:01:36] of ourselves but let me let us put
[1:01:39] ourselves out of the way father
[1:01:40] surrendering ourselves to you both
[1:01:42] speaker and hearer that you would have
[1:01:44] your way we ask you bless the reading of
[1:01:46] your word may it have an effect in the
[1:01:48] lives of your people we pray in Jesus
[1:01:51] name amen you can't have a seat
[1:01:54] this morning I just want to take a a
[1:01:56] little thought
[1:01:58] and and title it refined shaped and
[1:02:02] tempered
[1:02:04] and you know
[1:02:07] earlier in this week me and me and my
[1:02:10] wife we were talking about a situation
[1:02:12] of some friends we know back in the
[1:02:14] Phoenix area
[1:02:16] where
[1:02:18] new parents
[1:02:20] their first pregnancy and the baby was
[1:02:22] was born and it had a lot of
[1:02:24] complications and is in the NICU and
[1:02:26] they don't know
[1:02:28] what
[1:02:30] exactly will happen but they're trusting
[1:02:32] in God and we we're just talking and
[1:02:34] said how is it or what is it
[1:02:38] how how do you face these situations
[1:02:41] when they come
[1:02:42] how do you prepare yourself
[1:02:45] and even why is it as as Christians
[1:02:48] maybe we feel like we've done everything
[1:02:51] right we've we're trying to serve God
[1:02:53] with all our heart we've put ourselves
[1:02:56] out there and and just trusting that
[1:02:59] that God Will Make A Way and and then
[1:03:02] all of a sudden something in life like
[1:03:04] this happens
[1:03:05] nothing we could preconceive nothing we
[1:03:08] could plan for nothing you could even
[1:03:10] prepare yourself for
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:14] and it's just natural it's it's very
[1:03:16] human to to run into a situation like
[1:03:20] this and and say Lord why
[1:03:23] what did I do wrong
[1:03:25] what where did I go wrong would I have
[1:03:28] done something better could I have maybe
[1:03:31] maybe it's I could have you know in this
[1:03:34] case maybe the mom will have a ton of
[1:03:36] questions for herself and you know maybe
[1:03:38] I could have taken better care of myself
[1:03:39] is there some way we could have caught
[1:03:41] this and is there you know all these
[1:03:44] questions that surge through our minds
[1:03:48] and we say Lord I
[1:03:51] why is this
[1:03:54] and many times in life we'll go through
[1:03:57] things
[1:03:58] troubling things hard things
[1:04:02] that we may not
[1:04:06] immediately get an answer for
[1:04:09] or we'll get an answer in the fact that
[1:04:11] God Will Make A Way
[1:04:14] and what do I mean by that do I mean
[1:04:15] that there'll be some miracle and all of
[1:04:18] a sudden everything will be put right
[1:04:19] for what we consider right no
[1:04:24] that's not
[1:04:25] that's not scriptural
[1:04:29] it just isn't it'd be wonderful it'd be
[1:04:32] a great testimony
[1:04:35] it's what we would call a great
[1:04:36] testimony
[1:04:37] some great miracle of of someone being
[1:04:40] raised from the dead or someone with a
[1:04:42] deformity all of a sudden becoming whole
[1:04:44] in body
[1:04:45] we'd say look at this great testimony
[1:04:46] look at this miracle
[1:04:48] but you know an even greater Miracle
[1:04:50] than that
[1:04:52] is God's ability to bring us through it
[1:04:55] while facing that trial
[1:04:59] no matter the outcome
[1:05:02] you see because it takes far more faith
[1:05:05] to say God
[1:05:07] I trust you no matter what
[1:05:10] than it does if every time you said Lord
[1:05:14] fix this
[1:05:16] and he just did exactly what you wanted
[1:05:18] him to do
[1:05:19] because if so after a while it'd be like
[1:05:23] no problem you'd start just walking out
[1:05:26] into the street in the middle of traffic
[1:05:28] because
[1:05:30] no problem
[1:05:32] if I get hit by the car I fall down I
[1:05:34] die whatever I'll just raise back up
[1:05:37] but God didn't want us to act like that
[1:05:40] in life
[1:05:42] he wanted us to learn to trust him
[1:05:44] despite the fiery trials
[1:05:48] you know and
[1:05:50] many times like this scripture here in
[1:05:52] Malachi for he is like a Refiner's Fire
[1:05:55] and then it's skipping to verse three he
[1:05:57] shall sit as a refiner and purify our
[1:05:58] silver and he shall purify the sons of
[1:06:01] Levi and purge them as gold and silver
[1:06:03] that they may offer unto the Lord an
[1:06:05] offering of righteousness
[1:06:07] now many times when we think about it in
[1:06:10] the Refiner's Fire and we think God
[1:06:12] coming down his fire from heaven and
[1:06:14] bringing judgment we always think about
[1:06:16] it as many times it's preached as the
[1:06:19] the the shaft and the the sticks and the
[1:06:22] rubble being burned up
[1:06:24] and we always type that to an end time
[1:06:26] type when the the bride has been taken
[1:06:29] away and God comes down and purges the
[1:06:32] Earth
[1:06:33] but we don't realize
[1:06:35] that the reason why the Earth as a whole
[1:06:39] and sin and Hell Fire comes down to
[1:06:43] cleanse it because all those people
[1:06:45] rejected the fire in their life
[1:06:50] so it's not that you get to skate by
[1:06:52] free and clear
[1:06:54] and never get touched by the fire
[1:06:57] but you're making a conscious choice of
[1:06:59] saying Lord cleanse me let that fire
[1:07:03] Purify Me Now
[1:07:07] but many of us many times want to direct
[1:07:10] the Lord as on where and how that fire
[1:07:12] should affect us
[1:07:15] and that's what I would like to take a
[1:07:17] look at here this morning now
[1:07:20] this morning I know a scripture for the
[1:07:22] most part always touches on
[1:07:25] silver and gold as precious metals
[1:07:28] and
[1:07:29] there's a correlation between them and
[1:07:31] between the way all metals are are
[1:07:33] shaped and and used and refined but this
[1:07:37] morning I actually want to take a look
[1:07:39] at the process of refining
[1:07:42] iron ore and making it something useful
[1:07:45] you know because scripture also talks
[1:07:47] about
[1:07:48] the iron on iron and sharpening one
[1:07:52] another
[1:07:53] but in order to get to a place where we
[1:07:56] can be in a useful place where we can
[1:07:58] sharpen one another we have to be
[1:08:01] taken from the Earth
[1:08:03] where we were born
[1:08:05] processed shaped molded refined and
[1:08:10] tempered before will be of any use where
[1:08:13] God can use us appropriately
[1:08:15] now
[1:08:17] I actually have a few images I don't
[1:08:20] know if they're able to bring them up if
[1:08:21] you can bring up that first image
[1:08:23] there we go
[1:08:25] so
[1:08:27] this is all different types of iron ore
[1:08:31] that's brought up from the ground
[1:08:34] and it's in its shape and you can see
[1:08:37] here it's all different colors
[1:08:40] and that is all dependent on where it
[1:08:42] comes from what the Earth around it is
[1:08:45] like how how it's mined what the
[1:08:49] concentration of different sand and clay
[1:08:51] and all the different minerals are
[1:08:54] around it that influence it at that
[1:08:56] point in stage in the mining process if
[1:09:00] you just go to the second picture
[1:09:02] and this is just a tumble of it
[1:09:06] all in here there's there's iron in here
[1:09:10] but it's dirty it's got the Earth is all
[1:09:13] embedded in and around it it's really of
[1:09:16] no use
[1:09:19] if you were to see this you just say oh
[1:09:20] that's a pile of rocks
[1:09:22] you wouldn't be like wow look it I can
[1:09:24] see the spoons and I can see the
[1:09:26] utensils I can see shovels in there
[1:09:29] good morning yeah lawnmower lawnmower
[1:09:32] blades everything that we can think of
[1:09:34] your car
[1:09:36] the body of your car it's sitting right
[1:09:38] there
[1:09:39] most of us be like that is a pile of
[1:09:41] rocks useless
[1:09:44] if someone said hey I'm I I heard you
[1:09:47] need a new car I'm going to bring you
[1:09:49] some parts over and they drop this off
[1:09:51] in your driveway
[1:09:52] you would not be impressed
[1:09:54] not at all you can go ahead and take
[1:09:56] that down
[1:09:57] but you see just like the iron ore
[1:10:01] starts there so do all of us
[1:10:03] in fact none of us start with any
[1:10:05] advantage in life in regards to this
[1:10:08] process because scripture tells us we're
[1:10:10] all born in sin and shaped in iniquity
[1:10:13] come to this world speaking lies now it
[1:10:17] doesn't say well if you were born in
[1:10:18] church and you have really good parents
[1:10:20] this don't apply to you or
[1:10:22] you have the shaped in sin and born in
[1:10:25] iniquity but you don't have the Lie Part
[1:10:26] like 30 off no
[1:10:32] if you're if you're born to parents in
[1:10:34] the world if you're born to it doesn't
[1:10:37] matter where you're born it doesn't
[1:10:38] matter who your parents are doesn't
[1:10:40] matter what part of the world you come
[1:10:41] from doesn't matter your background
[1:10:46] the baby born in church
[1:10:48] raised up right never to the outside
[1:10:52] world looked like they'd done a thing
[1:10:53] wrong
[1:10:55] perfect kid
[1:10:57] is the same pile of ore
[1:11:00] as the person
[1:11:01] born to the the parents that are
[1:11:04] drunkers drug addicts
[1:11:06] murderer you name it when God looks down
[1:11:10] he sees that same pile of ore in both
[1:11:12] places
[1:11:14] and it's so important for us to realize
[1:11:16] that it's important for those of us
[1:11:18] maybe who are born in church
[1:11:20] to go I'm no better
[1:11:23] I'm no better
[1:11:25] to God I look no different
[1:11:29] the process he's going to have to work
[1:11:30] in me is just the same
[1:11:34] and it's good for those of you who maybe
[1:11:36] life hasn't been so kind to
[1:11:39] to look over and realize to God I'm the
[1:11:43] same pile of ore
[1:11:46] as this other person God don't see me
[1:11:49] any different he doesn't see me any
[1:11:51] worse he doesn't see me any dirtier
[1:11:54] he says there I see something in there
[1:11:57] and maybe wrapped up in the dirt and
[1:12:01] filth of this world
[1:12:03] but there is something in there that I
[1:12:05] can bring out that is something that I
[1:12:07] identify with
[1:12:09] that I can have that has a purpose and a
[1:12:12] use in my kingdom
[1:12:14] you see you're not just any kind of dirt
[1:12:19] you're a dirt
[1:12:21] that has a precious metal your dirt that
[1:12:25] has a usefulness locked up inside of you
[1:12:28] and it just takes God to reach down and
[1:12:31] begin working digging you out of the
[1:12:34] earth that you were born in
[1:12:37] and begin the process
[1:12:39] now
[1:12:41] I'm gonna
[1:12:43] you don't have to turn with me but I'm
[1:12:45] going to read very quickly through
[1:12:47] Hebrews 12.
[1:12:49] and I'll skip around a little bit
[1:12:50] because I want to hit this
[1:12:52] um
[1:12:54] because I think it's
[1:12:56] applicable to this
[1:12:59] um Hebrews 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing
[1:13:01] all we are also are compassionate about
[1:13:03] what's so great a cloud of witnesses let
[1:13:05] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:13:07] which does so easily beset us so here
[1:13:10] Paul says sin easily besets us
[1:13:15] so if any one of you think wow I really
[1:13:18] I I
[1:13:19] fell for that really easy I want a
[1:13:22] sucker I am well Paul said it's that's
[1:13:26] nothing
[1:13:27] special to you
[1:13:30] eat sin easily besets everybody
[1:13:36] so don't let the devil convince you that
[1:13:38] it's you're special
[1:13:41] and the fact that you felt
[1:13:44] for one of the devil's tricks means that
[1:13:46] you're not a son of God doesn't mean
[1:13:49] that at all
[1:13:50] Paul himself he's identifying himself in
[1:13:52] this he said we're all easily set upon
[1:13:57] to begin with
[1:13:59] so
[1:14:00] you're that pile of ore surrounded by
[1:14:02] dirt you look dirty it's because you're
[1:14:05] dirty doesn't mean that God isn't
[1:14:08] working God isn't doing anything you
[1:14:10] know when that pile of Aura is sitting
[1:14:12] there it's mineral content dirt content
[1:14:15] clay content isn't any different than
[1:14:17] when it was buried in the Earth
[1:14:19] but a process has been started
[1:14:22] all right looking unto Jesus the author
[1:14:25] and finish of our faith who for the joy
[1:14:27] that was set before him endured the
[1:14:29] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:14:32] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:14:34] God for consider him that endured such
[1:14:37] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:14:40] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:14:43] minds so Paul's telling us he said when
[1:14:45] you feel like
[1:14:47] everything's going wrong and temptation
[1:14:50] is on the rise you can't seem to
[1:14:53] make your way out of a paper bag
[1:14:56] seems like every time you turn around
[1:14:58] you're falling down again
[1:15:00] he said
[1:15:03] consider
[1:15:05] Christ
[1:15:07] and the contradictions and the things
[1:15:09] that he suffered and went through
[1:15:12] consider
[1:15:14] the trials that Christ went through
[1:15:18] he didn't he wasn't plagued with all the
[1:15:20] things that we were plagued with
[1:15:24] in that
[1:15:25] he was perfect to begin with
[1:15:28] he didn't have to go through those
[1:15:29] trials tribulations suffering
[1:15:33] but he was going to be the firstborn
[1:15:35] among many brethren
[1:15:37] he was going to show
[1:15:39] if you'll just follow my lead you too
[1:15:42] can overcome
[1:15:45] every single day
[1:15:46] every day every moment every second
[1:15:51] and that's good
[1:15:53] because many of us need that overcoming
[1:15:56] power every second there's about one
[1:15:58] moment we had that thought we said Lord
[1:16:00] help me and oh my goodness that's
[1:16:02] horrible
[1:16:03] I didn't I mean to think that about so
[1:16:05] and so I didn't mean to
[1:16:07] think think
[1:16:10] whatever it was
[1:16:12] and these thoughts pop up all the time
[1:16:16] because we're constantly being bombarded
[1:16:17] and influenced by the world
[1:16:21] so you see it boom it hits the eyes
[1:16:23] travels to the brain
[1:16:26] words images whatever they are we can't
[1:16:29] hardly Escape them you should be you
[1:16:30] could at least go to your own home close
[1:16:32] the door and get away
[1:16:35] but the world is in such a way
[1:16:39] that now your phone you pick it up and
[1:16:41] you think oh I'm just going to catch up
[1:16:42] with somebody online
[1:16:45] I'm gonna check my email I'm gonna I'm
[1:16:47] gonna check Instagram I'm gonna check
[1:16:49] Facebook the in and of itself as a
[1:16:52] single singular thing especially if you
[1:16:54] have family or friends that are in
[1:16:56] different parts of the world you can see
[1:16:58] wow this is a way for me to stay in
[1:16:59] touch with them and you open it up and
[1:17:01] boom there's an advertisement boom
[1:17:03] there's something else boom boom it's
[1:17:05] just like a minefield
[1:17:08] you you can't hardly get away from it
[1:17:13] but Christ said don't worry I knew
[1:17:16] that's the way it was going to be at the
[1:17:17] end time
[1:17:20] that's why
[1:17:22] they ran him when he talks about going
[1:17:24] beyond the curtain of time and he says
[1:17:25] when we get there at the end
[1:17:27] when we get there at the end
[1:17:29] and they come around and the Saints of
[1:17:32] all the Ages come asking and say what
[1:17:33] age were you from
[1:17:35] you know there's Paul
[1:17:37] James Peter you name it the all the
[1:17:40] saints who went through the Dark Ages me
[1:17:42] and you think wow
[1:17:44] put on Iraq pulled us under
[1:17:47] arms limbs popped out of their sockets
[1:17:50] saw it in half while still alive
[1:17:52] tortured
[1:17:54] I'm glad I didn't live back then
[1:17:59] but they faced it one time
[1:18:02] they faced it one time
[1:18:05] and then it was over
[1:18:08] today in this age young people
[1:18:13] every single moment you're at school
[1:18:15] you're at work you're in the the break
[1:18:18] room at work
[1:18:21] and it boom Another One boom it so
[1:18:24] happened so much and so rapidly that we
[1:18:27] become a bit calloused to it
[1:18:29] like it doesn't even phase us as much
[1:18:31] anymore like we're not shocked we're not
[1:18:34] my goodness what was that
[1:18:36] I can't believe I saw that no it's just
[1:18:38] oh
[1:18:40] you you walk through the store
[1:18:43] you don't you're not shocked you don't
[1:18:45] go running from the store I can't
[1:18:46] believe I saw that person that way or I
[1:18:48] can't believe someone did that I can't
[1:18:49] believe someone said that I can't
[1:18:51] believe that that person
[1:18:53] cuss someone out over the phone I can't
[1:18:56] believe this is a a place of a public
[1:18:59] place this is a place of business and I
[1:19:01] can't believe they would act that way
[1:19:02] we're not surprised or shocked at all
[1:19:04] anymore
[1:19:06] when we see that
[1:19:08] kids in school
[1:19:10] you shocked if one of your classmates
[1:19:12] starts cussing
[1:19:13] no not at all right
[1:19:17] zero
[1:19:19] go back even go back 15 10 15 years
[1:19:24] and you would have been sent to the
[1:19:26] principal's office for speaking that way
[1:19:28] it's not that people didn't know about
[1:19:31] it
[1:19:32] but there was still some level of
[1:19:34] propriety
[1:19:35] amongst professional places
[1:19:39] where that teacher when they walked out
[1:19:41] of school and went to the bar that night
[1:19:43] probably cussed up a storm
[1:19:45] but within the classroom they expected a
[1:19:47] certain level of etiquette
[1:19:49] you see but today
[1:19:51] if you were to send someone to the the
[1:19:53] principal's office for the same things
[1:19:56] they'd be like you're crazy
[1:19:58] this is freedom of speech
[1:20:01] the kid has rights
[1:20:07] and that's where we're at
[1:20:11] so that's the level when I said each
[1:20:13] generation it's 10 times worse
[1:20:16] now those of you who are any good at
[1:20:18] math 10 times worse each time
[1:20:21] isn't just another isn't a value of 10
[1:20:24] but that's a multiplier of 10.
[1:20:27] is we realize that
[1:20:29] from one generation to the next
[1:20:34] is that's 100 so you the first time you
[1:20:37] get 10 and 10
[1:20:38] that's 100
[1:20:42] 10 times that 100 is one thousand
[1:20:46] and I know this is really simple and
[1:20:48] maybe like come on I can do the math
[1:20:50] well 1010 times that 10
[1:20:53] 000.
[1:20:55] now how many times how are we all ready
[1:20:57] what three four
[1:21:01] that's only four generations and you
[1:21:03] went from 10
[1:21:04] to 10
[1:21:07] 000.
[1:21:09] that's where scripture talks about in
[1:21:11] The Book of Revelations that that from
[1:21:13] the river Euphrates those thousands upon
[1:21:16] thousands
[1:21:18] will be released
[1:21:20] and they've been released they're here
[1:21:24] they're here
[1:21:26] and that's why God was raising the
[1:21:28] standard
[1:21:30] you see it wasn't meant to be easy this
[1:21:33] last age wasn't meant to be an easy age
[1:21:35] and that's where going back the the
[1:21:37] Saints of the other ages will come to
[1:21:39] you and say which age are you from you
[1:21:40] say laodicea I was there in the very
[1:21:42] last age the bright age
[1:21:44] and there'll be that man who stood there
[1:21:46] who who was tied up and fed to the Lions
[1:21:48] and be like wow
[1:21:50] how did you make it
[1:21:52] how did you survive the constant
[1:21:55] bombardment
[1:21:57] of sin
[1:21:59] of demon power and influence
[1:22:02] where there was no place to escape
[1:22:07] how did you make it
[1:22:10] so know this you've been chosen you
[1:22:15] individually
[1:22:18] individually you have been chosen
[1:22:21] for this time
[1:22:23] this age
[1:22:25] because God knew that as he begun the
[1:22:29] refining process in your life there was
[1:22:32] characteristics about you
[1:22:34] that were perfect to meet the to meet
[1:22:38] the challenge of the age
[1:22:40] all right
[1:22:42] so he saw that when you were a pile of
[1:22:44] rocks
[1:22:46] God saw that in you
[1:22:48] all right
[1:22:50] for ye have not yet resisted unto blood
[1:22:52] striving against sin and ye have
[1:22:55] forgotten the exhortation would speaketh
[1:22:57] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:23:00] not to thou the chastening of the Lord
[1:23:02] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[1:23:05] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:23:07] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:23:10] receiveth if ye endured chasting God
[1:23:13] dealing with you as Sons for what son is
[1:23:15] he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:23:19] but if ye be without chastisement where
[1:23:22] of all our partakers then are you
[1:23:25] bastards and not Sons
[1:23:28] furthermore we have had followers of our
[1:23:30] flesh with corrected us and gave them
[1:23:32] reverence and we gave them reverence
[1:23:35] shall we not much rather be in
[1:23:36] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:23:38] and live for they barely a few days
[1:23:41] chastened us after their own pleasure
[1:23:43] but he for our Prophet that we might be
[1:23:45] partakers of his holiness
[1:23:48] now no chastening for the present
[1:23:50] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[1:23:54] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:23:57] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:24:01] them which are exercised thereby now
[1:24:05] Paul didn't sugarcoat any of this
[1:24:08] Paul was very real with everybody
[1:24:12] he didn't
[1:24:13] try to make it sound better or nicer
[1:24:17] he didn't try and be like just come to
[1:24:19] Jesus and everything will be all right
[1:24:22] you no more problems in your life it's
[1:24:24] all love and peace and rainbows and
[1:24:26] dancing on in the clouds
[1:24:29] like
[1:24:31] that was never the promise for the
[1:24:33] believer
[1:24:34] never
[1:24:37] and that's where Christianity has gone
[1:24:40] today
[1:24:41] is they said wow how do we increase
[1:24:43] membership let's just tell them God
[1:24:46] loves everybody God don't care
[1:24:50] how you are how you act how you dress
[1:24:53] how you speak God just loves you
[1:24:59] it's not true God does just love you
[1:25:05] but if he loves you
[1:25:08] he's going to correct you he's going to
[1:25:10] chasten you
[1:25:11] what does that mean is he's going to
[1:25:13] come
[1:25:14] around and be like what are you doing
[1:25:18] you're a Son of God you're a daughter of
[1:25:20] God
[1:25:22] why are you acting this way
[1:25:25] it's time to straighten out
[1:25:27] time to get your act together
[1:25:29] and he begins processing you processing
[1:25:32] you and refining you
[1:25:34] now
[1:25:37] keep this Hebrews especially here
[1:25:39] through
[1:25:42] Hebrews 12 6 through that 11. keep that
[1:25:45] in mind as we begin going through this
[1:25:47] process here
[1:25:49] there's a whole lot more here in the
[1:25:51] book of Hebrews uh the last verse I want
[1:25:54] to read in chapter 12 is verse 29.
[1:25:58] for our that's actually read 27-29 and
[1:26:02] this word yet once more signifyeth the
[1:26:04] removing of those things that are shaken
[1:26:06] as the things that are made and that
[1:26:10] those things which cannot be shaken May
[1:26:12] remain
[1:26:13] wherefore we're receiving we receiving a
[1:26:17] kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[1:26:19] have Grace whereby we may serve God
[1:26:22] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:26:25] for our God is a consuming fire
[1:26:30] now let's just go ahead and I want to
[1:26:32] talk about
[1:26:34] the different stages of iron refining
[1:26:38] now the first stage which we've already
[1:26:40] seen is the mining stage
[1:26:43] is where someone
[1:26:45] saw potential in the Earth
[1:26:48] that there is a there is a deposit of
[1:26:51] iron ore in this place in the earth that
[1:26:55] has enough value to be worth spending
[1:26:58] resources and time on to remove
[1:27:04] so it's not just anything it's just not
[1:27:06] they don't just randomly pick a place to
[1:27:08] dig and hope that they find something
[1:27:11] but there's people that are trained
[1:27:15] and have knowledge and understanding and
[1:27:17] wisdom
[1:27:19] who know what they're looking for
[1:27:21] they know what the mineral content of
[1:27:23] the earth should look like they know
[1:27:25] when they run their test
[1:27:27] whether or not this is a profitable
[1:27:30] thing to do
[1:27:33] and our God is not a a lazy businessman
[1:27:38] he doesn't just poke around and dig in
[1:27:40] in random places
[1:27:42] he knows where that iron deposit was
[1:27:45] placed because he put it there
[1:27:48] okay
[1:27:49] so if God even begins to work in your
[1:27:52] life even just a little bit
[1:27:55] if you feel God moving in on your life
[1:27:57] you feel the presence of God in your
[1:27:58] life whether it's in a in a church
[1:28:00] setting or even at home you're reading
[1:28:02] your Bible and it just so happens maybe
[1:28:04] just that one time you know you you
[1:28:07] didn't even want to
[1:28:09] you didn't feel like it
[1:28:11] but you happen to be sitting in your
[1:28:13] room or sitting maybe maybe you're
[1:28:15] sitting out in the living room no one
[1:28:17] else was there and you were bored
[1:28:19] and maybe it was your dad's Bible or
[1:28:22] your wife's Bible or your husband's
[1:28:24] Bible
[1:28:25] it was it wasn't even your Bible
[1:28:29] and you're sitting there and you're like
[1:28:30] I don't even know what to do I don't
[1:28:31] have nothing to do I
[1:28:33] don't you know he's kind of one of those
[1:28:36] moments and you're just kind of
[1:28:39] I'll just do anything anything and you
[1:28:41] see the Bible laying there and you pick
[1:28:42] it up you think oh this is random
[1:28:46] and you open up and you read a verse
[1:28:49] you didn't even really pick where you
[1:28:51] opened it you just opened it because you
[1:28:52] don't even know your Bible that well you
[1:28:54] haven't picked it up in so long
[1:28:57] maybe you've never picked up the Bible
[1:29:00] and you pick it up and you open up and
[1:29:01] you read a verse and something about
[1:29:03] that verse catches your attention and
[1:29:05] you close it up
[1:29:06] you set it down and you walk away and
[1:29:08] you don't ever think about it again for
[1:29:10] quite some time
[1:29:12] that wasn't you
[1:29:13] you thought it was you you thought it
[1:29:16] was random
[1:29:18] you thought you were just bored
[1:29:20] you said I have nothing better to do
[1:29:23] you weren't even that purposeful about
[1:29:25] what you read
[1:29:26] you open the book
[1:29:29] you read a verse you read a couple of
[1:29:31] lines you closed it up
[1:29:34] God's beginning to work
[1:29:38] don't think that you picked that up of
[1:29:40] your own choosing
[1:29:42] you see
[1:29:43] because never never and I mean never
[1:29:49] like
[1:29:51] never
[1:29:54] will the devil
[1:29:56] ever influence you to pick that book up
[1:30:03] that's the last thing he ever wants you
[1:30:05] to do
[1:30:06] because he understands
[1:30:09] the power of the word of God
[1:30:12] whether you understand it or not
[1:30:16] when you pick it up and you read from
[1:30:19] that word it's influencing you
[1:30:22] immediately you may not think so
[1:30:25] you may think whatever
[1:30:27] you walk away
[1:30:29] God's starting something
[1:30:31] God's doing something
[1:30:35] and this may be at any different stage
[1:30:37] in your life
[1:30:39] maybe you're saved maybe you've been
[1:30:41] baptized maybe you've been Sanctified
[1:30:43] maybe you've gone through the just the
[1:30:46] step of justification you've gone
[1:30:48] through that step of sanctification but
[1:30:50] you're still waiting on the Holy Ghost
[1:30:54] and maybe you're in a point in your life
[1:30:56] where you're kind of a little bit
[1:30:57] lackadaisical
[1:31:00] and you picked that Bible up
[1:31:02] you began to read God's doing something
[1:31:05] he's continuing the refining process
[1:31:09] you see at any stage in it most of us
[1:31:13] will look at that refining process and
[1:31:15] be like I don't see anything different
[1:31:17] yet
[1:31:18] in fact I see very little hope for that
[1:31:21] material
[1:31:23] almost none at all
[1:31:26] but you see
[1:31:27] we're not a mining specialist
[1:31:32] we don't see the vision for that product
[1:31:37] we don't look at it and go and see what
[1:31:40] that that other what that mining
[1:31:42] professional sees he says I see
[1:31:43] potential there
[1:31:45] and it's worth it for me first of all to
[1:31:47] dig it up out of the ground
[1:31:49] then from there transport it to a place
[1:31:52] where I can begin processing it
[1:31:55] and that's kind of the next stage is is
[1:31:58] the refining process and there's a an
[1:32:00] image there that shows a furnace here
[1:32:05] if you can put that up for me and just
[1:32:06] leave it up here but this is what they
[1:32:09] call a blast furnace
[1:32:11] so first of all in the mining process is
[1:32:15] you saw that larger pieces of ore that
[1:32:17] was pulled out of the ground that's not
[1:32:19] what goes into this glass furnace over
[1:32:22] in Arizona copper mining is a very big
[1:32:24] thing and I've been a had the
[1:32:26] opportunity to go to a few of these
[1:32:27] mines on tours and things and what they
[1:32:30] have is they have these massive tumblers
[1:32:34] where they take all this large ore
[1:32:38] and they dump it in and with that in
[1:32:42] that tumbler what they have is hardened
[1:32:44] typically hardened steel ball bearings
[1:32:49] inside those tumblers
[1:32:51] and they tumble it around
[1:32:55] until every last piece of that ore has
[1:32:58] been broken down and smashed into fine
[1:33:01] pieces fine particles
[1:33:04] they're getting it ready to go into the
[1:33:07] furnace
[1:33:08] they're getting it ready for processing
[1:33:10] and sometimes that's the stages of life
[1:33:13] that we're in you know we're really
[1:33:14] struggling to we we don't we don't want
[1:33:17] to admit that we need God in our lives
[1:33:19] we don't want to admit that you know we
[1:33:22] got rough edges or what we're doing
[1:33:24] anything wrong or anything is a problem
[1:33:26] we don't we don't need religion we don't
[1:33:28] need church we don't need well I can
[1:33:30] tell you this you don't need religion or
[1:33:32] church
[1:33:33] but you do need God
[1:33:38] yeah
[1:33:40] Now by God's grace when he starts
[1:33:42] working in your life
[1:33:44] you can hope and pray that he'll have a
[1:33:47] fine church for you to go to to be
[1:33:49] strengthened at
[1:33:52] but
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ is the answer
[1:33:57] and so what he starts doing in your life
[1:33:58] is he puts you into this
[1:34:01] life tumbler
[1:34:03] and because you're resistant it begins
[1:34:06] tumbling you around
[1:34:08] and you just feel like your life is
[1:34:10] getting all broke up
[1:34:12] you feel like everything is going wrong
[1:34:14] you're getting smashed to pieces you
[1:34:16] can't hardly catch a break
[1:34:19] every time you turn around something
[1:34:20] else is
[1:34:22] going wrong something else is messed up
[1:34:24] something else is where you're going
[1:34:26] through a process
[1:34:28] God started the process
[1:34:31] he's going to take you through the
[1:34:33] process he's going to finish the process
[1:34:36] once he gets his hands on you he's not
[1:34:38] going to let go
[1:34:40] that's why scripture says not one in the
[1:34:43] palm of his hand will be lost
[1:34:45] once he's got you there
[1:34:47] you can run you can try and resist you
[1:34:52] can do everything you think you're going
[1:34:53] to do and God just says no way
[1:34:56] you're mine now
[1:34:59] and you think back and be like man you
[1:35:02] know you'll be doing something that one
[1:35:03] little scripture that you read
[1:35:05] maybe you read Thou shalt not lie
[1:35:08] that's it we didn't even read any of the
[1:35:10] other Commandments used for it Thou
[1:35:11] shalt not lie
[1:35:13] and up until this point in your life
[1:35:15] you've told so many lies
[1:35:18] and you know how many of them bothered
[1:35:20] you none of them
[1:35:23] in fact you thought I am so good at this
[1:35:27] and they are all so stupid
[1:35:31] I am so good at this they don't even
[1:35:33] have a clue well you know it's most of
[1:35:34] the time most people do have a clue
[1:35:36] they're just giving you a lot of Grace
[1:35:38] and you don't ever get away with
[1:35:39] anything
[1:35:41] it's not true but now you read that
[1:35:44] scripture Thou shalt not lie just a few
[1:35:46] words
[1:35:48] and all of a sudden you go tell a lie
[1:35:49] it's not even that big a lie
[1:35:51] and that comes back to you thou shall
[1:35:53] not lying it starts bothering you and
[1:35:54] bothering you and you're like oh my
[1:35:56] goodness
[1:35:57] like it's not even that big a deal
[1:36:00] like I don't know why this is bothering
[1:36:02] me God's working
[1:36:04] God's working
[1:36:06] it to everyone else they don't even
[1:36:07] notice
[1:36:08] all they do is still see all your lies
[1:36:12] but they don't see God began the process
[1:36:14] he's begun that refining process where
[1:36:18] he's he's causing a turbulence he's
[1:36:20] causing uh something to come into your
[1:36:22] life and start breaking that stuff up
[1:36:25] start breaking up that Earth that that
[1:36:27] iron is buried in
[1:36:28] and when he gets you all broke up and
[1:36:30] ready
[1:36:31] he brings you over to the blast furnace
[1:36:34] now the purpose of the blast furnace
[1:36:36] is to take that iron ore that's got all
[1:36:40] those impurities in it and separate it
[1:36:42] out through Heat
[1:36:45] they have a few things that they add to
[1:36:46] it to help that heat process but the end
[1:36:49] result is you can see here that
[1:36:53] from the top is where that ore is
[1:36:55] getting dropped in and as you start
[1:36:57] dropping into the furnace the lower you
[1:36:59] down into the furnace the hotter it is
[1:37:03] and what's happening is that the holiday
[1:37:05] rate again is the less impurities can
[1:37:08] survive
[1:37:11] and the iron which is heavier than the
[1:37:15] impurities
[1:37:16] is getting melted out and drops down to
[1:37:19] the bottom and all the impurities get
[1:37:23] pushed to the top
[1:37:25] and what happens then is that they take
[1:37:28] and once it's reached that point where
[1:37:29] they consider it pure enough
[1:37:31] they take it out the bottom and they
[1:37:34] pour it into molds let's go to the next
[1:37:36] image
[1:37:37] we're going to go through this a little
[1:37:39] bit quick
[1:37:42] okay
[1:37:43] so they pour it out into molds
[1:37:46] and those molds create what they call
[1:37:48] ingots
[1:37:49] and all they are is roughly formed
[1:37:53] iron
[1:37:55] pure as pure iron as what they can get
[1:37:58] through this process
[1:38:00] it still has a few little impurities but
[1:38:03] it is as pure as it can get now how many
[1:38:06] of you would look at that and be like
[1:38:07] aha
[1:38:09] now I see it
[1:38:10] I could use some of that well I don't I
[1:38:13] did have someone deliver some to my
[1:38:14] house tomorrow
[1:38:17] wait
[1:38:18] Simon would you you want to borrow iron
[1:38:22] just to sit in your room
[1:38:24] no
[1:38:26] you don't have any plans for it anything
[1:38:28] like that okay me neither
[1:38:31] unless you just want a big giant
[1:38:33] paperweight
[1:38:35] but it to me that has no use yet
[1:38:39] no purpose
[1:38:41] has no value to me
[1:38:43] as
[1:38:44] as a person
[1:38:46] and I'm not going to do anything with it
[1:38:48] zero
[1:38:50] and yet this is the stage where we're at
[1:38:52] God's working on us
[1:38:55] he's began cleaning us off
[1:38:57] maybe at this point he's got to a place
[1:39:00] of justification
[1:39:02] he's working on the sanctifying process
[1:39:06] but we're still just a lump of iron
[1:39:09] you know Iron people may not realize it
[1:39:12] but iron is extremely soft
[1:39:15] iron is
[1:39:18] it's very malleable
[1:39:20] bendable
[1:39:22] it can be pushed around it can be
[1:39:25] hammered on
[1:39:26] and one of those characteristics also is
[1:39:30] that whichever way it hit it gets hit
[1:39:32] it'll just stay there
[1:39:35] you know it's like a young Christian we
[1:39:38] come in and you know we're feeling so
[1:39:40] good and and maybe we don't have that
[1:39:43] many years in the scripture and in the
[1:39:45] Bible not much of an experience
[1:39:47] but we're on we have been on fire for
[1:39:50] God if we've gone through that furnace
[1:39:52] and we're like whoo
[1:39:54] I'm ready
[1:39:56] I'm ready
[1:39:57] now I'm ready
[1:39:59] and to us we are feeling really good
[1:40:01] because the last we saw of ourselves we
[1:40:03] were that pile of rocks
[1:40:05] and now we look at ourselves and we're
[1:40:07] like
[1:40:08] wow this church is so blessed to have me
[1:40:13] just wait I just really now I pick up my
[1:40:17] Bible because I want to
[1:40:19] I just want to read that thing every day
[1:40:21] and that's good it's not still not
[1:40:23] because you want to but God's
[1:40:25] influencing you to want to
[1:40:27] he really is at any point of the stage
[1:40:29] where we think it's well it's because I
[1:40:31] want to
[1:40:32] oh there may be there may be a stage
[1:40:34] where that comes to that
[1:40:36] you ain't really there yet God's still
[1:40:39] working
[1:40:40] he's still working on me he's still
[1:40:41] working on you
[1:40:43] and at this stage though we read you
[1:40:46] know I think brother random talks about
[1:40:48] a man who read the Bible one day and it
[1:40:51] says
[1:40:53] um
[1:40:54] one day it it told him to eat and be
[1:40:57] merry for tomorrow you die
[1:41:00] and so he goes out and he throws a party
[1:41:02] and he gets all drunk
[1:41:04] and the next day he reads the Bible and
[1:41:07] it tells him not to be a drunkard
[1:41:10] and he says I don't get it
[1:41:12] it seems like it's contradictory
[1:41:15] he was in an iron stage
[1:41:18] you see he was so excited
[1:41:21] he forgot to actually go through and see
[1:41:23] what did it mean what was the scriptures
[1:41:25] around that that applied to that
[1:41:30] but you see it came in and it influenced
[1:41:33] him and he was so excited he just ran
[1:41:34] off and did it and he couldn't end up a
[1:41:36] little bit bent over and took someone to
[1:41:38] come straighten that thing back out
[1:41:41] and he's like wow I'm confused now
[1:41:44] and that's many of us when we're in that
[1:41:46] stage of our Christian walk is one
[1:41:48] minute you know we we think we got it we
[1:41:51] think we understood what God meant and
[1:41:53] we go out and we go start correcting
[1:41:55] people and telling them hey you
[1:41:57] shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be
[1:41:58] thinking that you shouldn't be acting
[1:41:59] that way don't you know you're a
[1:42:01] Christian
[1:42:03] and and luckily for us most of them are
[1:42:06] going to be people who are quite
[1:42:07] gracious and experienced and have been
[1:42:11] walking with the Lord a while and they
[1:42:12] just say oh thank you brother I'll take
[1:42:14] that into consideration I appreciate
[1:42:16] that
[1:42:18] you know because they got some Grace for
[1:42:19] us because they've been there before
[1:42:21] and sometimes iron runs into iron
[1:42:24] and they they butt heads and they both
[1:42:26] go away a bit bent
[1:42:29] you know a little bit deformed like ah
[1:42:32] that hurt wow he hurt my feelings he you
[1:42:34] know
[1:42:36] he should know better than that if he
[1:42:38] was a Christian the other guy's like
[1:42:39] well if he was a Christian he wouldn't
[1:42:41] have treated me that way he wouldn't
[1:42:42] have talked to me that way he wouldn't
[1:42:43] have said those things
[1:42:45] doesn't he know who I am
[1:42:48] neither of them learned anything because
[1:42:50] they're in that stage but God's still
[1:42:52] working
[1:42:53] God's still working
[1:42:55] it's not you haven't surprised God at
[1:42:58] all if you have a good wonderful Pastor
[1:43:01] he's not surprised at all he's just
[1:43:03] watching it and he said all right God's
[1:43:05] working I just got to have patience
[1:43:08] God's doing what he's doing
[1:43:10] he doesn't need me to jump in there and
[1:43:12] try and straighten them all out and you
[1:43:15] just let God do his thing
[1:43:17] you see because if you take at this
[1:43:19] stage and you think you're going to
[1:43:20] straighten them all out
[1:43:22] and that'll be the end of it
[1:43:24] you straighten them out and tomorrow
[1:43:26] they run into something again and
[1:43:27] they'll come back bent
[1:43:29] why because that's the nature of the
[1:43:32] iron right now it's pure iron
[1:43:35] it's got some dirt removed
[1:43:37] it's getting cleaned up
[1:43:40] but that's just the stage in the process
[1:43:42] at that
[1:43:44] no take heart if you're in this stage
[1:43:47] you come out of the world God's cleaned
[1:43:50] you up a bit and you're on fire you're
[1:43:52] excited and yet you feel like everything
[1:43:55] that hits you you just can't seem to
[1:43:57] recover from it
[1:43:58] he's like am I even a Christian like I
[1:44:01] did this and I I feel like I backslid
[1:44:04] and now I can't seem to come back from
[1:44:06] it and I just I'm just bent
[1:44:09] I can't
[1:44:10] it's like
[1:44:11] you know you ever have an injury of some
[1:44:13] kind or or you know
[1:44:16] if you're real young it probably hasn't
[1:44:18] happened to you
[1:44:19] but you get a muscle and you get a big
[1:44:21] giant knot in your back back here and
[1:44:24] it's like this and you're walking around
[1:44:25] well
[1:44:27] all you need is for someone to work that
[1:44:29] knot out and you'll be fine
[1:44:31] but until that happens man is it painful
[1:44:35] and it affects the way you walk and the
[1:44:38] way you act and it affects your attitude
[1:44:40] all those things
[1:44:43] and that's where many people are in the
[1:44:44] stages they get a little not in their
[1:44:47] life
[1:44:47] a little bit of Ding A little bit dinged
[1:44:50] up and the ding don't come out very easy
[1:44:54] the bend in their life and everyone sees
[1:44:56] them and they're all they seem to be
[1:44:58] walking a little crooked and you're like
[1:44:59] you okay there you all right anything I
[1:45:02] can do for you I'm like no I'm fine
[1:45:07] but you're fighting that vowel in and of
[1:45:09] yourself too because you look around you
[1:45:12] like Lord I thought I had an experience
[1:45:14] I thought I got baptized I thought
[1:45:17] everything should be better now
[1:45:20] oh it's better
[1:45:21] but now instead of the rocks and the
[1:45:23] dirt being embedded in you
[1:45:25] and being a part of your everyday life
[1:45:27] now when you come in contact with them
[1:45:30] and they have a little bit of effect on
[1:45:32] the the outside
[1:45:34] they affect your life a little bit
[1:45:35] because you hit something hard and it's
[1:45:37] going to ding you up a little bit you
[1:45:39] hit something else a little bit of dirt
[1:45:41] and it gets embedded on the outside
[1:45:43] and now you're like wow I shouldn't I
[1:45:46] shouldn't be doing that anymore I
[1:45:48] shouldn't be affected by that anymore
[1:45:52] and he's like Lord
[1:45:53] was my experience even real
[1:45:56] I said yeah it was real don't worry
[1:45:58] about it that's just on the outside
[1:46:00] I'm still working on you
[1:46:02] and that the inside that's mattering the
[1:46:04] most right now
[1:46:06] let's let's jump to the next picture
[1:46:08] here
[1:46:10] we go
[1:46:12] we're gonna hang out on this one a while
[1:46:15] now
[1:46:17] what they do
[1:46:19] to bring iron to a place that it's
[1:46:22] usable
[1:46:24] and make it
[1:46:26] strong enough
[1:46:28] and flexible enough
[1:46:30] is they take it to a forge
[1:46:33] they take these ingots of iron
[1:46:36] and they begin working on them
[1:46:39] now right away you can tell this is not
[1:46:42] a pleasant experience
[1:46:47] especially if this is applying to us
[1:46:50] because we thought we'd been through the
[1:46:51] furnace once already
[1:46:53] we thought we are good to go
[1:46:56] I'm sanctified
[1:46:58] I'm so squeaky clean already what's all
[1:47:03] this for
[1:47:04] what's the purpose Lord
[1:47:07] I accepted you as my savior I let you in
[1:47:10] I I gave up all the drinking I gave up
[1:47:13] the cigarettes I gave up the cutting my
[1:47:16] hair I get whatever it was I gave up the
[1:47:19] the worldly music or whatever
[1:47:22] Lord I did all these things why why am I
[1:47:26] going back through this why do I feel
[1:47:28] like I'm getting put back through the
[1:47:29] furnace
[1:47:32] he said yeah you're now barely finally
[1:47:35] in a stage where you're workable
[1:47:39] now we can begin the process of turning
[1:47:41] you into something that's useful
[1:47:45] you see because iron that pure iron form
[1:47:48] is going to have a few things added to
[1:47:51] it because what they want to end up with
[1:47:53] is steel
[1:47:56] and the difference between Iron and
[1:47:58] Steel
[1:47:59] is a bit of character
[1:48:01] now I call it character because it works
[1:48:05] out real well
[1:48:06] because the element added is carbon
[1:48:10] and the the periodic symbol for that is
[1:48:12] a big giant C so you can call it Christ
[1:48:15] you can call it character
[1:48:18] you can kind of just fill in the blank
[1:48:20] right there
[1:48:21] but it's applicable
[1:48:23] because what that does is as they begin
[1:48:25] hammering it now here's the wonderful
[1:48:28] thing I just just a side note is that
[1:48:31] although they know science knows that
[1:48:34] this works and is applicable and makes
[1:48:38] this iron turn to steel and become
[1:48:42] something that is extremely useful
[1:48:46] and Powerful
[1:48:48] strong
[1:48:49] flexible
[1:48:51] all those things
[1:48:54] they can tell you what it looks like
[1:48:56] when they're done
[1:48:58] well they what they still say today is
[1:49:01] they don't feel the fully understand why
[1:49:03] this happens
[1:49:07] and this is true for all of us
[1:49:09] is because God begins working on our
[1:49:11] life
[1:49:12] brings us over to the forge
[1:49:15] of his word
[1:49:18] puts us into the furnace starts heating
[1:49:21] us up
[1:49:22] and what they do is you see where it's
[1:49:24] red hot that's what they say you have to
[1:49:27] bring it to the point of the critical
[1:49:29] point just before it starts to melt down
[1:49:32] again
[1:49:34] and you know how many times they do this
[1:49:37] over and over and over again as they
[1:49:43] begin pounding the shape out on the
[1:49:45] Anvil
[1:49:48] and you know what's doing that the Anvil
[1:49:50] is already made
[1:49:52] of Steel
[1:49:54] the hammer head is made of steel
[1:49:59] so it's
[1:50:00] those who already have had experience
[1:50:04] God is using
[1:50:06] to move in your life
[1:50:09] and being helped to shape you
[1:50:13] and build you into something useful for
[1:50:15] the kingdom of God
[1:50:17] you see
[1:50:19] this is where in Hebrews
[1:50:24] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteness
[1:50:26] and Scourge us every son whom he
[1:50:29] receiveth if he endure chastening God
[1:50:32] deal with you as a with his sons for
[1:50:35] what son is he whom the father
[1:50:37] chasteneth not
[1:50:40] thank you
[1:50:41] now no chastening for the present seemed
[1:50:43] to be joyous but Grievous
[1:50:46] it this isn't going to be pleasant
[1:50:49] just as a heads up
[1:50:51] if you thought
[1:50:53] I'm going to join the church
[1:50:56] I'm going to get baptized except Jesus
[1:50:57] Christ is my personal savior
[1:51:00] because I don't want to have to face
[1:51:01] anything hard again in life
[1:51:05] you picked the wrong place
[1:51:09] that's all I'm saying
[1:51:13] because that was never a promise
[1:51:16] now I can remember my own experience
[1:51:20] I was 16 years old
[1:51:22] when I got baptized
[1:51:24] and I was so nervous and excited
[1:51:30] and I went up and I went into the water
[1:51:33] got baptized in Jesus name
[1:51:36] came out of that water and I felt like I
[1:51:39] was floating on clouds
[1:51:42] I did
[1:51:44] it was one of the most wonderful
[1:51:45] experiences I've ever had in my life
[1:51:48] I felt that way for at least two weeks
[1:51:53] like there's nothing anyone could say to
[1:51:56] me that could bring me down I just felt
[1:51:58] like I was walking around on clouds and
[1:52:00] dancing like nothing could go wrong
[1:52:05] it was wonderful
[1:52:07] what I didn't realize
[1:52:09] I was just in that iron stage
[1:52:12] God was just getting ready to work on me
[1:52:16] here I was and I was like I have made it
[1:52:21] he said well you're in a good stage to
[1:52:23] get started
[1:52:25] so he said I'll let you enjoy it for a
[1:52:27] moment let you sit there and cool off
[1:52:29] and become a little bit more solid so I
[1:52:31] can become working on you again
[1:52:34] and he did
[1:52:36] and he has
[1:52:38] and he still is
[1:52:41] like Saints
[1:52:42] the reason I know God is working on me
[1:52:46] is because despite all the times like I
[1:52:49] feel like I've been put in the furnace
[1:52:51] I'm still here
[1:52:55] see if God had decided I have no purpose
[1:52:58] for you
[1:53:00] you're just scrap
[1:53:02] you're not a part of the iron that I
[1:53:04] need
[1:53:05] you're not a piece of Steel that I need
[1:53:09] you just refuse
[1:53:11] to be set aside
[1:53:13] you know how you would know you just
[1:53:16] thrown back into the furnace to be
[1:53:17] melted down again
[1:53:20] tossed to the side
[1:53:23] that's what brother Brandon talks at it
[1:53:24] it's the same concept where he says that
[1:53:26] woman who's cutting out a pattern for a
[1:53:28] dress
[1:53:31] it's the same material
[1:53:34] but God is choosing
[1:53:36] to place his pattern over you in your
[1:53:37] life
[1:53:40] so if he's still working on you
[1:53:42] you know how you'll know
[1:53:44] because despite what you go through how
[1:53:47] tough or how hard it is no matter how
[1:53:50] close to failure you think you came
[1:53:53] God's doing it on purpose
[1:53:55] because he's got to bring you to the
[1:53:57] critical point every time
[1:53:59] to the point where you almost lose to
[1:54:01] all shape
[1:54:02] to the point where you lose all your
[1:54:04] identity when you get metal iron to a
[1:54:07] critical point
[1:54:09] it loses one of its main characteristics
[1:54:11] which is magnetism
[1:54:15] most anything metal you ever take a
[1:54:17] magnet you put it on your fridge you put
[1:54:18] on the side of your car
[1:54:20] sticks just like that
[1:54:22] the magnets real strong you can't hardly
[1:54:24] pull it off
[1:54:26] and that is just you know in fact when
[1:54:29] they're going through metals to
[1:54:30] determine what they are they'll take a
[1:54:32] strong magnet over it
[1:54:34] and anything that picks up and connects
[1:54:36] to it metallic it's probably ironed
[1:54:39] that's how they know
[1:54:41] in fact in big giant shops when they're
[1:54:43] doing separation that's how they do it
[1:54:46] that's how they identify it
[1:54:48] but when you're brought to this critical
[1:54:50] point
[1:54:51] everything you think
[1:54:53] that is a part of your identity gets
[1:54:55] taken away
[1:54:57] because God's working
[1:54:59] and he's reshaping you and reshaping
[1:55:02] your identity
[1:55:03] do the character shaping process of the
[1:55:06] word
[1:55:07] he's bringing you through one step at a
[1:55:09] time
[1:55:10] so you thought wow that last trial was
[1:55:13] really hard
[1:55:14] that last lesson was really hard I
[1:55:17] almost didn't make it
[1:55:20] but you did
[1:55:22] you know why God took you all the way to
[1:55:26] that critical point
[1:55:27] then brought you out and began working
[1:55:29] on you hammering on you working you
[1:55:32] through he's molding you into the image
[1:55:34] in his mind
[1:55:36] he is a preconceived idea of you
[1:55:41] of how you should look
[1:55:43] how you should act and how you should
[1:55:47] then
[1:55:48] react to the things in the world
[1:55:51] you see and little by little he doesn't
[1:55:55] do it all at once
[1:55:56] it would be too much you wouldn't be
[1:55:58] able to handle it
[1:56:01] you wouldn't make it
[1:56:03] but little at a time he's working on you
[1:56:06] and so he's allowing things to happen in
[1:56:08] your life that you'll be going along
[1:56:10] you'll think life is great life is going
[1:56:12] just the way you planned it and boom
[1:56:15] something you couldn't have planned for
[1:56:16] didn't plan for happens
[1:56:19] maybe you get sick
[1:56:22] maybe a loved one passes away
[1:56:25] maybe all your friends turn against you
[1:56:29] maybe you start making a stand for God
[1:56:32] and your friends just start leaving you
[1:56:34] out
[1:56:36] and you say I didn't do anything
[1:56:37] different
[1:56:39] I don't even treat them any different
[1:56:40] when I'm around them I don't even talk
[1:56:42] about God
[1:56:44] why don't they invite me anymore
[1:56:46] why don't they want to hang out with me
[1:56:48] anymore
[1:56:49] God's working
[1:56:51] God's working
[1:56:52] you can't help the iron can't help but
[1:56:56] as it's being worked on begin to show
[1:56:58] some of the characteristics of Steel
[1:57:01] of what is being molded and worked and
[1:57:04] shaped into
[1:57:07] and so was it with us
[1:57:09] is that as God is working in our life
[1:57:11] and you go out even if you don't say
[1:57:14] anything
[1:57:15] there's going to be a presence carried
[1:57:17] with you you may not even be
[1:57:20] all that aware of it
[1:57:23] but the people who've been around you
[1:57:24] before they are
[1:57:26] yeah
[1:57:27] they're like man
[1:57:28] she's he he she used to be so fun
[1:57:32] now there's just such a stick in the mud
[1:57:34] they don't want to do anything
[1:57:36] you know because you show up and used to
[1:57:38] do all the things that they used to do
[1:57:39] you used to say all the things they
[1:57:40] usually laugh at all their jokes
[1:57:44] used to think they were real funny in
[1:57:46] fact used to tell the jokes
[1:57:48] you were the funny guy
[1:57:51] you were the one they came to and they
[1:57:52] were down because they knew you had all
[1:57:54] the jokes
[1:57:56] now you don't have any more jokes
[1:57:59] and on top of that you don't laugh at
[1:58:00] their jokes
[1:58:03] you're not eating fun anymore
[1:58:09] so now they're like you know what let's
[1:58:11] just not invite them like
[1:58:14] and you're going like what happened
[1:58:16] what did I do
[1:58:19] you didn't do anything
[1:58:21] God's working
[1:58:23] God's working in your life
[1:58:25] God's working on who you are
[1:58:27] God's molding you he's shaping you he's
[1:58:30] placing you over and over again in this
[1:58:32] furnace
[1:58:33] taking you to that critical point last
[1:58:36] time you thought that was as far as I
[1:58:37] could possibly go but with each time the
[1:58:40] characteristics of the iron are changed
[1:58:42] and you get closer to become Steel
[1:58:44] you can resist a higher level of heat
[1:58:49] and God knows that
[1:58:51] he said no each time I build your
[1:58:53] character the next time I can take you a
[1:58:55] little bit further
[1:58:56] a little bit closer to my own character
[1:58:59] he said because the the example was of
[1:59:03] Christ
[1:59:04] our example was of Christ
[1:59:08] and Christ
[1:59:11] though he didn't want to
[1:59:16] was willing to set his own identity to
[1:59:18] the side
[1:59:21] take up the cross
[1:59:24] walk up
[1:59:26] to Golgotha
[1:59:29] allow himself
[1:59:32] to be nailed to that cross
[1:59:35] and made a shame
[1:59:38] for all of us
[1:59:41] see and that is
[1:59:43] the character
[1:59:45] of the steel
[1:59:47] that God is working on each one of us to
[1:59:50] get to
[1:59:52] you can see this in the life of the
[1:59:54] disciples
[1:59:55] look at each one of them as God Jesus
[1:59:58] started working on them
[1:59:59] he called them he was patient with them
[2:00:03] and little at a time
[2:00:05] he started asking a little bit more of
[2:00:06] each one of them
[2:00:08] all the way to the point where they had
[2:00:11] to come to the same characteristics of
[2:00:13] Christ going to the Cross some of them
[2:00:16] quite literally
[2:00:19] but they didn't get there overnight and
[2:00:20] one go
[2:00:23] Peter on the night of the crucifixion
[2:00:28] he had a lot of work to do he was still
[2:00:30] very much in an iron state
[2:00:33] because
[2:00:34] when the servant said hey aren't you one
[2:00:38] of them he said no and he cursed
[2:00:43] he said
[2:00:45] I'm going to prove to you I'm not one of
[2:00:47] them because you know one of them would
[2:00:48] never curse
[2:00:50] so out of fear I'm going to curse
[2:00:57] to prove to you
[2:00:58] I'm not what you think I am
[2:01:00] and Jesus Jesus never rebuked him
[2:01:04] in fact Jesus told him
[2:01:06] beforehand Peter before
[2:01:10] the crows Thrice
[2:01:14] before the crows you'll denied me
[2:01:17] Thrice
[2:01:18] three times not once
[2:01:20] not twice
[2:01:22] three times
[2:01:24] someone who'd walk with Jesus there were
[2:01:26] three and a half years
[2:01:28] had seen the dead raised had seen blind
[2:01:31] eyes come open they had seen leprosy
[2:01:34] healed
[2:01:37] one minute a leper next minute perfectly
[2:01:40] clean
[2:01:41] the worst possible disease of their time
[2:01:47] this is why brother Barnum said miracles
[2:01:49] never made a believer
[2:01:53] many a people throughout the ministry of
[2:01:55] brother random throughout brother
[2:01:56] random's Ministry saw cancers
[2:01:59] they were sitting on the platform behind
[2:02:01] him
[2:02:02] as he prayed for people and Cancers
[2:02:05] visibly on the neck
[2:02:07] fell off onto the platform
[2:02:12] and yet at the end of his ministry
[2:02:14] they said he's preaching false Doctrine
[2:02:21] it's not about the miracle
[2:02:24] God's simply doing that because he's
[2:02:25] looking he's beginning a mining process
[2:02:28] and in the mining process
[2:02:30] you dig up all the dirt around the Oar
[2:02:32] too
[2:02:33] it all gets loosened up and moved
[2:02:35] everything's getting shaken just like
[2:02:37] the scripture says everything's getting
[2:02:39] shaken and loosened up
[2:02:42] because God's coming after his own
[2:02:45] he doesn't care about the rest of it
[2:02:47] if they get a little benefit from it
[2:02:50] fine if they don't fine
[2:02:54] he doesn't even care
[2:02:57] what he's after is you and me
[2:03:00] you see God will take and shake up a
[2:03:03] whole city
[2:03:05] to get one soul
[2:03:08] if you ever see a large mining operation
[2:03:10] a pit mine have how many of you have
[2:03:13] ever seen a pit mine
[2:03:15] how many of you have ever seen a picture
[2:03:16] of a pit mine
[2:03:21] it looks like a massive gaping hole in
[2:03:25] the ground some of them are miles
[2:03:27] across and up to hundreds of feet deep
[2:03:35] and they are the ugliest things you will
[2:03:38] ever see
[2:03:42] and yet
[2:03:43] they're doing it because they have no
[2:03:46] concern
[2:03:47] for the Earth mountains valleys rivers
[2:03:51] around it
[2:03:52] they're after one thing
[2:03:54] they're after the ore that contains the
[2:03:57] metal that they're after
[2:03:59] and that's what God's doing here
[2:04:02] he's not concerned about the rest of the
[2:04:04] world he's not concerned about the rest
[2:04:06] of the earth he's got a plan to fix that
[2:04:09] anyways
[2:04:10] he's after you
[2:04:12] if he's got to disrupt the entire place
[2:04:15] to get you he will
[2:04:18] so have you ever been in a stage in your
[2:04:20] life where you just see like it seems
[2:04:23] like the whole place is shaking it seems
[2:04:25] like everything's falling apart
[2:04:27] God will do it for one Soul one
[2:04:31] he'll shake a whole city he'll shake a
[2:04:34] whole country for one soul
[2:04:37] that's how important you are to him
[2:04:40] you see that's why here at the end it's
[2:04:42] speaking about it he said everything
[2:04:45] that can be shaken will be shaken
[2:04:48] why because he's coming here to the end
[2:04:50] he said I can't lose a one
[2:04:52] so I gotta shake them all loose
[2:04:54] and get them ready for a Rapture to get
[2:04:57] out of here
[2:04:59] that way I can renovate this Earth I'm
[2:05:01] not worried about the Earth how many of
[2:05:03] you have ever seen or been a part of a
[2:05:04] home renovation
[2:05:06] or a building renovation you've seen it
[2:05:09] happen you walk through a place let's
[2:05:11] say road construction
[2:05:13] when they start road construction
[2:05:16] are they Pleasant and nice as with the
[2:05:19] road that they're trying to remove and
[2:05:20] change
[2:05:21] no
[2:05:23] they don't even care
[2:05:24] that asphalt could have been there for
[2:05:26] the last 30 years and still looked
[2:05:28] pristine and pretty with a nice white
[2:05:30] line on it
[2:05:32] but that is not their focus they're
[2:05:35] moving it because they have another
[2:05:36] purpose
[2:05:37] it is no longer has any purpose or any
[2:05:40] meaning it's just in the way
[2:05:42] and that's the way God sees everything
[2:05:44] else when he's coming after you
[2:05:47] he's not going to treat it kindly or
[2:05:49] nicely or or baby it or or be careful
[2:05:52] not to disrupt it
[2:05:55] he's going to do whatever it takes to
[2:05:57] get to you
[2:05:58] so the further and deeper you run and
[2:06:00] the more you hide
[2:06:02] and the more people that he has to
[2:06:04] disrupt that's on you
[2:06:07] because he's coming after you
[2:06:09] he's not going to stop until he has you
[2:06:12] so you can think you can run you can
[2:06:14] think you can hide
[2:06:15] you can think I I can be so bad
[2:06:19] I can
[2:06:21] involve myself so deep in sin God will
[2:06:24] never want me
[2:06:25] and then people will just leave me alone
[2:06:30] it it's not going to work I'm sorry you
[2:06:33] can do that if you want to but I highly
[2:06:36] highly suggest you don't
[2:06:41] it just means you're going to have to go
[2:06:42] through more refining process
[2:06:46] that's all
[2:06:48] the flame of the fire is going to be
[2:06:50] much harder to purify and bring out the
[2:06:54] character God's looking for
[2:06:56] so refining molding
[2:06:59] now we're into the forging of and
[2:07:02] tempering of Steel
[2:07:04] so we already see in the forging process
[2:07:06] that's being worked on it's being
[2:07:09] processed and we're working on it
[2:07:11] because God has got a very specific
[2:07:15] characteristics that he wants for the
[2:07:17] finished product
[2:07:19] now
[2:07:22] I'm going to read you something here and
[2:07:24] this is just informational
[2:07:28] metal forging is known to produce some
[2:07:30] of the strongest manufactured parts
[2:07:31] available as the metal is heated and
[2:07:34] pressed minor cracks are sealed and
[2:07:38] empty spaces found in the metal are
[2:07:41] closed up
[2:07:44] so God's working on you and you still
[2:07:47] have things in your life
[2:07:49] that aren't just right you got spaces
[2:07:52] that he's not fully inhabiting
[2:07:55] space is in your heart
[2:07:57] that you haven't fully surrendered
[2:08:00] and he's looking to to work that out and
[2:08:03] feel every last space
[2:08:07] with his love with his character with
[2:08:08] the fruits of the spirit with the moving
[2:08:10] of his holy of the holy spirit in your
[2:08:12] life
[2:08:13] he said we're going to keep working till
[2:08:15] we work out every crack until we work
[2:08:18] out every pocket
[2:08:20] and nothing is left but Jesus Christ
[2:08:25] in addition the hot forging process
[2:08:27] breaks up any impurities in the metal
[2:08:30] and redis redistribute such materials
[2:08:33] across the metal work this results in a
[2:08:35] vastly reduced inclusions in the forged
[2:08:38] parts
[2:08:39] inclusions are compound Metals embedded
[2:08:41] inside steel throughout Manufacturing
[2:08:46] even though impurities should be managed
[2:08:48] during the initial casting process this
[2:08:51] process the hammering the forging the
[2:08:54] fire
[2:08:56] this process will further refine the
[2:08:58] metal
[2:09:02] another way that forging strengthens
[2:09:04] metal is through the altering of its
[2:09:06] grain structure this has to do with the
[2:09:08] materials grain flow as it deforms like
[2:09:11] other forming processes a fable
[2:09:13] favorable grain structure can be created
[2:09:16] making the forged metal sturdier
[2:09:21] so it doesn't have to do with anything
[2:09:23] other
[2:09:24] than the process of the forging under
[2:09:27] the hands of the master
[2:09:29] that begins changing the characteristics
[2:09:32] of the steel
[2:09:34] the iron
[2:09:35] into the steel and the steel step by
[2:09:38] step
[2:09:39] into something stronger and something
[2:09:41] sturdier
[2:09:43] no
[2:09:46] definition here
[2:09:48] of either tempered or tempering
[2:09:51] is to dilute
[2:09:53] qualify or soften by the addition or
[2:09:56] influence of something else
[2:09:57] meaning
[2:09:59] to moderate tempered Justice with Mercy
[2:10:05] to soften a material such as a hardened
[2:10:07] steel or cast iron by reheating at a
[2:10:09] lower temperature
[2:10:10] to make stronger and more resilient
[2:10:12] through hardship
[2:10:13] the example would be troops that are
[2:10:16] tempered in battle
[2:10:17] now troops that are tempered in battle
[2:10:19] when someone says that troops are
[2:10:22] tempered it means that they no longer
[2:10:24] jump run or become skittish over the
[2:10:27] slightest thing
[2:10:29] they've been tempered to react
[2:10:32] differently
[2:10:34] they faced battle before
[2:10:36] and they know the difference
[2:10:38] between what they should be concerned
[2:10:40] with and what they should not
[2:10:44] and where the soldier that is fresh and
[2:10:46] new on the field every little noise he
[2:10:48] jumps and every little noise he's afraid
[2:10:51] and every little noise he's looking for
[2:10:53] something to shoot at
[2:10:54] the tempered troops they don't worry
[2:10:56] about it that's nothing to be afraid of
[2:10:59] when you see
[2:11:01] in fact the ones that are the most
[2:11:03] experienced
[2:11:05] they'll tell the new recruit the time
[2:11:07] for you to be concerned is if you see it
[2:11:10] see that old Soldier over there if you
[2:11:12] see him moving move with him
[2:11:15] I
[2:11:16] and God's does the same things in our
[2:11:18] lives
[2:11:19] you see puts us with people who are
[2:11:21] experienced
[2:11:23] and sometimes on our own we get really
[2:11:26] uptight about certain things and you
[2:11:29] know in our stage we've become maybe a
[2:11:30] little legalistic and every little thing
[2:11:33] is an annoyance to us
[2:11:35] and God says hey hey look it you see
[2:11:39] that brother over there
[2:11:40] he's been through a lot of experiences
[2:11:43] watch him a little bit ask him for some
[2:11:46] advice
[2:11:48] because he'll let you know brother don't
[2:11:50] let that bother you
[2:11:52] it's not a big deal
[2:11:54] just just pray for that person just pray
[2:11:56] for that individual what you you had a
[2:12:00] little mishap you had a you felt like
[2:12:02] you backslid a little bit brother it
[2:12:03] happens to us all every day
[2:12:05] just get up and keep moving don't worry
[2:12:07] about it don't let the devil hold that
[2:12:09] over you keep moving
[2:12:11] no
[2:12:13] tempering
[2:12:14] is done to steal as well
[2:12:17] because
[2:12:19] what they do let's go ahead
[2:12:23] and go to that second picture
[2:12:26] is as the steel is worked once it gets
[2:12:28] to a place where it's in the right shape
[2:12:32] it's exactly in the shape of the tool or
[2:12:34] the end product we want it to be
[2:12:36] they heat that steel back up to that
[2:12:38] critical point
[2:12:40] once they get it to that critical point
[2:12:42] they plunge it into oil
[2:12:45] to cool it extremely rapidly because
[2:12:47] it's going to have an effect on the
[2:12:49] structure of the steel
[2:12:52] and it locks that structure that of the
[2:12:56] steel in a position where it's extremely
[2:12:58] strong
[2:13:00] I don't know if you've ever heard the
[2:13:01] term of hardened steel
[2:13:04] but if you're in any type of
[2:13:05] manufacturing or used type of any type
[2:13:07] of equipment more than likely you have
[2:13:10] hardened steel parts on some of that
[2:13:12] machinery
[2:13:14] your car is going to have hardened steel
[2:13:17] is part of some of its parts
[2:13:20] now hardened steel and in and of itself
[2:13:23] is not the end point though
[2:13:25] because although now it's very hard
[2:13:29] it's got the right shape it looks right
[2:13:33] it looks like the finished product
[2:13:36] but God's not done yet
[2:13:39] you see because if you take something
[2:13:41] that's hard in steel if all you need is
[2:13:44] a bolt or something to hold something
[2:13:46] together it'll probably work
[2:13:48] in fact they use hardened steel all the
[2:13:50] time in different types of applications
[2:13:55] one really good that also all of us will
[2:13:57] be able to identify with is they use
[2:13:58] them in snow blowers
[2:14:01] they take a hardened steel Bolt
[2:14:04] and they put it
[2:14:06] where the blades of the snow blower are
[2:14:07] where it connects back to the engine
[2:14:10] but that hardened steel has very
[2:14:12] specific
[2:14:14] um
[2:14:15] ratings for how hard it should be
[2:14:19] because it's made to break under
[2:14:21] pressure
[2:14:23] and that is one of the things about
[2:14:25] hardened steel if all it is is hardened
[2:14:29] it's very strong
[2:14:31] but when it's put under too much
[2:14:33] pressure it just breaks and shatters
[2:14:36] and the reason they do that is because
[2:14:38] they're trying to protect something else
[2:14:39] in the linkage
[2:14:41] so if all of a sudden your snow blower
[2:14:44] hits a big giant rock
[2:14:45] and binds it up they don't want to
[2:14:47] destroy the motor
[2:14:48] so that hardened steel bolt has got a
[2:14:51] certain limit to its pressure that it'll
[2:14:54] hold
[2:14:55] based on its characteristic and it's
[2:14:57] made that when that pressure hits it
[2:14:59] when it gets to a certain point it
[2:15:00] doesn't just bend
[2:15:02] and still hold but it just snaps
[2:15:05] snaps off
[2:15:08] because it's not tempered
[2:15:12] it's not tempered
[2:15:16] now the tempering process
[2:15:20] is
[2:15:22] let's jump to the next image
[2:15:26] if they actually put that finished
[2:15:28] product back into the fire
[2:15:30] but now they're very careful with it
[2:15:33] they're not looking to take it back to a
[2:15:35] critical point
[2:15:36] but they're looking to just bring it to
[2:15:38] the place where they slowly warm it to a
[2:15:41] very specific temperature
[2:15:43] and they're doing that and they're
[2:15:44] watching for a very specific
[2:15:45] characteristics to form in the blade
[2:15:49] and most of the time if they're doing it
[2:15:51] in Old traditional ways over an open
[2:15:54] coals or fire however that is is they're
[2:15:57] looking for a very specific color to
[2:15:59] take place in that blade and when it
[2:16:01] does they take it back out and they cool
[2:16:04] it again
[2:16:06] what that tempering does
[2:16:09] is it takes that blade
[2:16:12] and it makes it changes its structure
[2:16:15] one more time
[2:16:17] and it gives it just a little bit of a
[2:16:20] softness
[2:16:21] on the inside of the blade
[2:16:25] so they hardened it and that's good
[2:16:28] because the edge of that blade they want
[2:16:30] to be hard
[2:16:31] and maintain
[2:16:33] a a edge
[2:16:36] a sharpness to it
[2:16:38] but if it only stays hard the first time
[2:16:41] you go to use it it'll shatter
[2:16:46] but now they're going to temper that
[2:16:48] blade
[2:16:49] and just the holy spirit will come and
[2:16:52] start working on your life
[2:16:54] he said you've been through a lot
[2:16:57] you've been hardened through through the
[2:16:59] battles you've been through
[2:17:01] and many of men have been through this
[2:17:04] and come to these stages they know the
[2:17:07] word
[2:17:08] they they've been fighting they're
[2:17:10] they're struggling they're they've got
[2:17:12] up they kept moving on they're growing
[2:17:14] in God's grace
[2:17:15] and they get to a place where they just
[2:17:17] become real hard
[2:17:20] you know brother Branham came to that
[2:17:22] place
[2:17:27] he did
[2:17:28] in his ministry
[2:17:31] and he came to a place where he had it
[2:17:33] was so his heart had hardened against
[2:17:37] the people
[2:17:42] and
[2:17:44] he was using the word to cut the people
[2:17:48] to pieces
[2:17:51] and I don't say this to this disparage
[2:17:54] or to or take anything away from the
[2:17:56] prophet of God
[2:17:58] but I'm showing you this is a process
[2:17:59] that God works in everybody
[2:18:02] no one
[2:18:03] is exempt
[2:18:06] each person has to go through this
[2:18:08] each person has to go through each stage
[2:18:10] because God wants a finished product
[2:18:14] that he can wield
[2:18:16] knowing how it will perform
[2:18:19] knowing that it will go forth to perform
[2:18:22] his word and not just perform something
[2:18:24] you want or something you think and that
[2:18:26] you won't be so rigid
[2:18:28] in the enforcement of what you think is
[2:18:31] the right thing
[2:18:33] that if you hit any resistance you're
[2:18:35] going to break and fall apart you're
[2:18:37] going to come unglued you're going to
[2:18:39] cause pain and suffering the people that
[2:18:41] shouldn't
[2:18:43] you see because Harding steel when it
[2:18:46] breaks it's not a clean break
[2:18:49] it doesn't just
[2:18:51] that's it but when it breaks under
[2:18:54] pressure it shatters and all those
[2:18:56] little pieces go find everybody
[2:18:58] everywhere undiscriminately hurting
[2:19:01] everything and everyone in its path
[2:19:07] and sometimes we come to that stage in
[2:19:09] our life
[2:19:12] where we think we've got it just so
[2:19:15] we know the word we know the scriptures
[2:19:18] we know the message
[2:19:21] and we know your problems
[2:19:23] and we're going to let you know and
[2:19:25] we're going to straighten you out and
[2:19:27] when you don't straighten out we're
[2:19:28] going to come back and let you have it
[2:19:32] we're going to cut you real deep
[2:19:34] because the word of God is like a
[2:19:36] two-edged sword Discerning to the heart
[2:19:39] and Marrow of the bone
[2:19:43] and we think that's our job
[2:19:45] and it's not
[2:19:47] because it says the word of God is not
[2:19:50] you
[2:19:52] that's God's job
[2:19:54] it's our our job to be yielded to the
[2:19:57] moving of the Holy Spirit and as a
[2:19:59] minister or as a lay member as a
[2:20:02] Christian as you Minister one to another
[2:20:04] is to share the word of God as God give
[2:20:07] you utterance and let the word of God be
[2:20:10] the sword that goes to the heart of the
[2:20:12] believer and does the work
[2:20:15] took too many times we get to the point
[2:20:18] in our life
[2:20:19] where we think we have all the answers
[2:20:22] and we're going to straighten them out
[2:20:24] because we think we
[2:20:26] are that sword of God
[2:20:29] and God does want to use you
[2:20:32] but you're not ready
[2:20:34] you're not ready you're going to do more
[2:20:36] damage than help right now
[2:20:40] because
[2:20:41] you have all the right words
[2:20:44] but you don't have the right character
[2:20:46] yet God still has got one more stage to
[2:20:49] put you through
[2:20:50] to where you're even now a vessel of
[2:20:53] Honor that can be used in the King's
[2:20:55] Service
[2:20:57] you're an instrument a tool in his hand
[2:21:01] that he can wield
[2:21:03] in a way that is so precise
[2:21:05] because the characteristics he built
[2:21:07] into you are so specific
[2:21:13] but we can say they're in the prophet's
[2:21:14] life
[2:21:16] where he actually had to remove himself
[2:21:18] from Ministry
[2:21:20] when when the angel of the Lord rebuked
[2:21:22] him because it wasn't that he wasn't
[2:21:24] preaching the word
[2:21:27] he was preaching the word
[2:21:29] he was preaching exactly from this Bible
[2:21:33] 100 the truth
[2:21:38] you won't go and find where even through
[2:21:40] that stage where he preached anything
[2:21:41] that was a lie
[2:21:43] or said anything that was untrue
[2:21:48] but it was the spirit and the character
[2:21:50] by which it was applied
[2:21:53] the skill by which that word was being
[2:21:55] applied that was incorrect
[2:21:58] and God came to him and said you need to
[2:22:00] stop doing that
[2:22:04] he said you need to stop condemning the
[2:22:06] people
[2:22:07] that's not your job
[2:22:11] it's your job to preach the word
[2:22:13] let the word fall where it may
[2:22:16] and you let God do the rest
[2:22:19] and you just
[2:22:21] remember where you came from
[2:22:23] see that's the problem is we get to this
[2:22:25] point
[2:22:26] where we look like the instrument that's
[2:22:29] going to be the finished product
[2:22:31] we look just like it
[2:22:34] you know I got an article here and I'm
[2:22:35] not going to read it but I'm going to
[2:22:36] tell you and they're talking about the
[2:22:38] difference between a functional sword
[2:22:41] and we're going to use a sword as the
[2:22:43] end product here because it I feel like
[2:22:45] it applies
[2:22:46] versus a decorative sword
[2:22:51] is they say none of the characteristics
[2:22:53] of what people think make up a sword are
[2:22:57] true of a functional sword
[2:23:01] a sword is not heavy
[2:23:04] most swords
[2:23:06] weighed between in total
[2:23:09] two to three pounds
[2:23:11] two to three pounds
[2:23:15] a really heavy sword
[2:23:17] you see those swords perhaps you've seen
[2:23:19] plenty of pictures of swords some that
[2:23:21] are they call it somewhere they call
[2:23:23] two-handed swords Claymores
[2:23:26] they were five feet tall
[2:23:31] four four pounds
[2:23:34] but it's the characteristics it wasn't
[2:23:36] the weight of the steel
[2:23:39] or the size of the object
[2:23:42] that makes it useful
[2:23:44] but it's the character of the object
[2:23:47] that makes it useful
[2:23:49] see a heavy sword is unwieldy
[2:23:53] scripture speaks of it
[2:23:56] is that in your experience and and you
[2:23:59] go out and your experience isn't right
[2:24:01] and you're floundering around and you
[2:24:03] feel like you can't it you don't have
[2:24:05] any control that's all over the place
[2:24:08] it's because it's unwieldy you're still
[2:24:10] too heavy you need work
[2:24:13] that
[2:24:16] is not functional they can't be used
[2:24:21] same thing maybe you're the right weight
[2:24:23] maybe you're the same right shape maybe
[2:24:25] you look perfect
[2:24:28] but you've been hardened
[2:24:30] but not tempered
[2:24:33] you know the first time you go
[2:24:37] and are put into service for use
[2:24:40] you're more likely to hurt the person
[2:24:41] you using you than the person you're
[2:24:44] being used against
[2:24:47] you're more likely to cause harm to the
[2:24:50] user than harm to the enemy
[2:24:54] because when you hit something solid any
[2:24:56] resistance
[2:24:58] you're going to shatter into a million
[2:24:59] pieces
[2:25:01] just
[2:25:03] gone
[2:25:09] and that's where God is still working
[2:25:12] he's coming and he's saying you know
[2:25:14] what
[2:25:15] you're close
[2:25:16] but we got one more step
[2:25:19] you don't need I don't need to take you
[2:25:21] to that critical stage anymore I don't
[2:25:22] need to melt you down to nothing
[2:25:25] but I'm gonna come in and soften your
[2:25:27] heart
[2:25:29] I'm gonna give you a heart like mine
[2:25:32] that when you look out upon the sinner
[2:25:34] you've been armed well with the
[2:25:36] characters of of the word and you know
[2:25:39] the scriptures you know the message you
[2:25:41] can quote it up and down now
[2:25:43] but now we're going to soften your
[2:25:45] spirit
[2:25:46] in such a way that when you yield when
[2:25:49] you wield that word that has been built
[2:25:52] into you over all these years
[2:25:55] you're going to do it in a way that's
[2:25:57] going to be precise
[2:25:58] you're going to do it in a way that only
[2:26:00] Cuts away the necessary things
[2:26:03] but doesn't touch anything else
[2:26:06] you're going to do it in a way that
[2:26:08] maybe you meet a little resistance
[2:26:10] you're not even phased
[2:26:13] you see because a heart and blade if it
[2:26:14] hits
[2:26:16] it can chip
[2:26:18] maybe you try to put yourself into
[2:26:20] service before you were even hardened
[2:26:22] you look like the right shape but you're
[2:26:24] still as malleable as the
[2:26:27] iron that you came from
[2:26:29] and what happens is you'd ever take
[2:26:31] something that isn't been hardened and
[2:26:34] tempered
[2:26:36] and you hit it or you try to have you
[2:26:38] ever taken like maybe a steel bar
[2:26:40] digging bar or something like that and
[2:26:41] try to pry something out of the ground
[2:26:43] or move it
[2:26:44] and instead of the thing moving your bar
[2:26:46] just bends like
[2:26:48] or the shovel you're using it just bends
[2:26:51] why and then you take it out and it
[2:26:53] stays bent
[2:26:55] it wasn't hardened and it's not tempered
[2:26:58] because tempering of the steel
[2:27:01] produces a trueness
[2:27:04] they say they a blade that's true
[2:27:09] the trueness of the blade
[2:27:11] is reflected in its ability
[2:27:15] to be bent
[2:27:17] and to be flexed
[2:27:19] and come back perfectly to its original
[2:27:22] state
[2:27:25] see that's how God wants us to be
[2:27:29] God wants us
[2:27:31] when he goes to start using us
[2:27:35] and we run into something difficult or
[2:27:37] hard or we we come into a situation is
[2:27:41] not to overreact and get all bent out of
[2:27:44] shape and stay that way
[2:27:46] or it's not to come into something and
[2:27:47] and we we just shatter the pieces and we
[2:27:51] fall apart
[2:27:53] but God wants us
[2:27:55] to be such that when he takes and starts
[2:27:57] to use you
[2:27:59] is that you're not easily influenced
[2:28:01] you're not rigid
[2:28:04] but you're not easily influenced either
[2:28:06] you'll come into a situation and God can
[2:28:09] use you to kind of work through it
[2:28:12] knowing at the end point it'll come true
[2:28:14] again
[2:28:17] because sometimes it takes
[2:28:21] someone knowing how to yield something
[2:28:23] correctly
[2:28:24] you know a sword you may think of it as
[2:28:26] only ever a weapon that can cause harm
[2:28:30] but they also used to use it
[2:28:34] simply to chase people away or to
[2:28:37] maneuver something or correct someone
[2:28:43] because you don't always have to use the
[2:28:44] sharp edge
[2:28:47] see that's where experience comes in
[2:28:51] and God brings someone to you or put
[2:28:53] someone in your life or a situation
[2:28:56] and
[2:28:58] if your first reaction is condemnation I
[2:29:01] would say you're probably still very
[2:29:02] much in that hardened condition
[2:29:05] you need to be tempered
[2:29:07] by the Holy Spirit
[2:29:10] to put that final
[2:29:12] bit of softness back into you
[2:29:15] where you have that sharp edge of the
[2:29:17] word
[2:29:18] it's not that you you don't
[2:29:21] hold true
[2:29:23] is that you know
[2:29:26] like
[2:29:27] if I bend a little bit one way or the
[2:29:29] other because I can see I need to work
[2:29:32] with this person
[2:29:34] I need to be a little bit flexible and
[2:29:36] see how God's moving
[2:29:40] that it's fine it's not going to leave
[2:29:42] me all bent
[2:29:44] when I come out of this I'll be true
[2:29:47] again
[2:29:51] when God is using me and bringing
[2:29:54] difficulties into my life I'm not going
[2:29:56] to shatter and fall apart
[2:29:59] God's put a temper in my soul
[2:30:02] that'll hold me true
[2:30:06] the way they test this
[2:30:09] is they take a sword
[2:30:11] or whatever blade it is
[2:30:13] and they lock it the tip in a vise
[2:30:18] and then they take it and they bend it
[2:30:22] all the way over
[2:30:27] now
[2:30:30] if it's been hard and not tempered at
[2:30:33] some point in that bending process it's
[2:30:36] going to snap and break
[2:30:39] if it's never been hard hardened and it
[2:30:43] still has bits of it now this can happen
[2:30:45] even if your whole maybe you've had some
[2:30:49] experiences but your whole experience
[2:30:50] isn't right
[2:30:53] there can be Parts in that blade that
[2:30:55] are that haven't gone through the
[2:30:57] process correctly you've tried to skip
[2:30:59] steps
[2:31:01] parts are hard parts are soft a little
[2:31:04] bit is tempered
[2:31:06] and what happens is if one part stays
[2:31:09] straight the other part bends the other
[2:31:11] part is a little bit springy
[2:31:13] send result is you got a blade that
[2:31:16] looks like a dog's leg
[2:31:18] that flops
[2:31:22] or you bend and
[2:31:25] they go to let let go and it doesn't go
[2:31:27] back to full straight again it just
[2:31:28] stays bent
[2:31:32] well I tell you many of us will go
[2:31:34] through these things as well
[2:31:36] many of us
[2:31:38] will experience these things but I tell
[2:31:40] you this that if God is working
[2:31:44] once he starts the work he never tosses
[2:31:47] it to the side
[2:31:48] where many a blacksmith and sword Smith
[2:31:52] when it gets to this point in the blade
[2:31:54] shatters he says play and the blade is
[2:31:57] bent it just gets tossed on a heap
[2:32:00] don't worry God won't do that with you
[2:32:03] he'll just start you over again
[2:32:06] he'll stick you back in the furnace
[2:32:08] start melting you down that part that
[2:32:10] broke he'll put you together heat it up
[2:32:12] into that critical point again and
[2:32:13] Hammer you back together
[2:32:16] because God never starts anything he
[2:32:19] doesn't finish
[2:32:21] me and you get excited and get ahead of
[2:32:23] the of the of the the
[2:32:26] game sometimes
[2:32:29] but God's just letting you see you're
[2:32:31] not quite ready yet
[2:32:33] he'll let you see this as stages because
[2:32:35] he wants you to see your growing
[2:32:37] many times as we're growing
[2:32:40] we don't see the growth
[2:32:43] we can see how everyone else we think is
[2:32:45] stunted but we don't see our own growth
[2:32:50] and this has been true of all of God's
[2:32:53] children
[2:32:54] you can go all the way back to the
[2:32:55] father of Faith Abraham
[2:32:57] and
[2:32:59] God did this with him over and over
[2:33:02] again
[2:33:04] all the Servants of God you can see it
[2:33:06] but look at Abraham
[2:33:08] you know Abraham had a pretty easy life
[2:33:12] all the way up into the point
[2:33:15] where
[2:33:17] he gathered all his things and
[2:33:19] possessions together and headed out into
[2:33:21] the wilderness
[2:33:26] I don't see any scripture that talks
[2:33:29] about Abram having a difficult light
[2:33:30] before that I'm sure he had the all the
[2:33:33] difficulties of of life that everyone
[2:33:35] does
[2:33:36] but nothing
[2:33:38] extraordinary
[2:33:41] it wasn't until he said
[2:33:44] Lord I don't really know who you are
[2:33:47] but I know you're calling me
[2:33:49] and so I'm gonna go and I don't even
[2:33:51] know where I'm going and he started out
[2:33:55] that's when all his troubles began
[2:33:59] you know we a lot of times we focus on
[2:34:01] all Abraham's blessings
[2:34:04] right
[2:34:05] Abraham the father of Faith look at how
[2:34:08] God blessed him here and God blessed him
[2:34:09] there but it was through the fiery
[2:34:12] furnace and the forging of Abraham's
[2:34:14] character that God brought him through
[2:34:18] to the man
[2:34:19] who God could speak to you and say
[2:34:21] Abraham
[2:34:22] take Isaac your only son
[2:34:25] and sacrifice him to me and Abraham
[2:34:28] didn't mock he didn't nothing just all
[2:34:30] right Lord away I go
[2:34:34] he didn't even tell Sarah
[2:34:36] he said Isaac we're going on a trip
[2:34:40] to a mountain
[2:34:41] to sacrifice to the Lord
[2:34:43] he didn't explain it
[2:34:46] it didn't bend him out of shape
[2:34:49] he didn't fall apart he didn't start
[2:34:51] lying to Sarah
[2:34:54] because he's been through all that
[2:34:55] before
[2:34:57] and now he'd built up to a place where
[2:34:59] God knew Abraham
[2:35:02] you're in a state that you're usable
[2:35:04] and now you're true
[2:35:07] the trueness of the blade I've been
[2:35:09] shaping is there
[2:35:10] and I want you to see it too
[2:35:15] and so I'm going to ask you to do
[2:35:16] something that if I would have asked you
[2:35:18] this a few years ago
[2:35:20] you would have run in the opposite
[2:35:22] direction
[2:35:23] you would have said no way
[2:35:25] anything else
[2:35:28] you see because Abraham had faced some
[2:35:31] tough stuff already
[2:35:32] he came out
[2:35:34] and he had to separate his he came out
[2:35:37] and his father passes away
[2:35:41] now he's out without any support any
[2:35:42] friends
[2:35:44] it's just him and the family he brought
[2:35:46] his he brought lot along with him a
[2:35:48] relative
[2:35:50] and he thought wow at least I have a lot
[2:35:52] to lean on you know with my dad passing
[2:35:54] away he can provide me some emotional
[2:35:56] support and all that
[2:35:57] and just with a matter of time of that
[2:35:59] all sudden lot and his group are having
[2:36:03] problems with Abraham and they split off
[2:36:04] and separated away
[2:36:06] now a lot doesn't have now Abraham
[2:36:09] doesn't have anybody
[2:36:11] he said The only person I had to lean on
[2:36:14] the only other guy I felt I could talk
[2:36:16] to and get counsel from and just kind of
[2:36:19] have a little bit of you know
[2:36:20] camaraderie someone who knows my past
[2:36:23] and we can you know talk about the good
[2:36:24] old times
[2:36:25] he don't want anything to do with me
[2:36:28] in fact he thinks so badly of me he'd
[2:36:31] rather hang out close to Sodom and
[2:36:33] Gomorrah
[2:36:36] like our contention was so bad that's
[2:36:39] where he would rather be
[2:36:42] we couldn't settle this
[2:36:45] so we had to separate
[2:36:48] and now this place of promise that God
[2:36:50] he felt God had called him to
[2:36:53] there's a drought it dries up there's no
[2:36:55] food
[2:36:59] you would think well God called me here
[2:37:01] shouldn't God provide for me
[2:37:05] he will
[2:37:07] and he always does
[2:37:09] if you stand still long enough
[2:37:12] but Abraham was still going through
[2:37:14] those things he was the forge
[2:37:16] it was still happening
[2:37:18] character was still being formed and
[2:37:20] built he goes running off to Egypt he
[2:37:22] goes running off
[2:37:24] and starts telling lies about who is his
[2:37:27] wife is his sister and if it wasn't for
[2:37:29] God's grace he would have come back
[2:37:30] without a wife
[2:37:35] but God was showing him even in the
[2:37:38] midst Abraham even when you mess
[2:37:41] everything up
[2:37:43] my promise has nothing to do with you
[2:37:47] I made a promise to me
[2:37:51] so when you're going through life
[2:37:53] and you feel like you're reaching a
[2:37:55] critical point
[2:37:58] where you feel like I don't see any way
[2:38:00] out of this
[2:38:03] I've gone down to the point where I
[2:38:06] don't even think God can save me from
[2:38:08] this
[2:38:12] what I've done is too bad
[2:38:15] the thoughts I've had are too evil
[2:38:18] the places I've been are too horrible
[2:38:21] the experience and the loneliness and
[2:38:23] the depression I'm in are too deep
[2:38:28] God's just breeding you all the way to
[2:38:30] that critical point
[2:38:33] so he can bring you out
[2:38:35] and you'll come out and go Lord You're I
[2:38:37] know you're faithful
[2:38:39] and you know what he says good now
[2:38:42] you're ready for the next one
[2:38:44] you know
[2:38:46] when
[2:38:47] just to lighten it up just a little bit
[2:38:50] is
[2:38:52] when I was 18 years old I was a month
[2:38:56] away from turning 18.
[2:38:58] the church that we I grew up in I was
[2:39:00] born and grew up in
[2:39:02] my my dad made some very
[2:39:05] large changes and he had
[2:39:08] addressed the pastor and some things
[2:39:10] that he felt were wrong and what was
[2:39:12] going on in the church
[2:39:15] and I appreciate my dad
[2:39:17] because he'd been doing going back and
[2:39:18] forth with the pastor for over five
[2:39:20] years
[2:39:21] you know I didn't have a clue
[2:39:24] I saw times when he looked pretty
[2:39:26] distressed
[2:39:28] but
[2:39:30] that wasn't so unusual because
[2:39:32] he has a lot of
[2:39:34] physical injuries and so he always looks
[2:39:36] like he's a little in a little bit of
[2:39:37] pain
[2:39:39] and so a little more pain wasn't unusual
[2:39:42] but it came down to a point
[2:39:45] where he said
[2:39:47] he let the pastor know I don't feel
[2:39:50] like me and my family can stay here any
[2:39:53] longer
[2:39:54] I feel like God is leading me on
[2:40:00] and
[2:40:01] I remember that day quite well
[2:40:05] because there was a somberness over the
[2:40:08] home when I got home from work that day
[2:40:11] and
[2:40:12] we were all sitting waiting for my dad
[2:40:14] because he had made the call to the
[2:40:16] pastor that day and after that he had
[2:40:18] gone down to a Rose Garden there in the
[2:40:20] city and just kind of walked around and
[2:40:22] paced around for hours like any of us
[2:40:26] probably would do when under that amount
[2:40:28] of strain
[2:40:30] and then he came home and he let us all
[2:40:31] know
[2:40:33] in variation
[2:40:35] just to shorten it his that we would be
[2:40:38] moving on
[2:40:39] now the church that we were in was a
[2:40:43] not to disparage anyone but
[2:40:46] quite legalistic in its ways and they
[2:40:49] have some beliefs and I just keep
[2:40:51] praying for them as a church as a whole
[2:40:53] and as the people and all these people
[2:40:54] were my friends
[2:40:56] to give you an idea I was I was
[2:40:58] homeschooled
[2:41:01] um all my friends were from the church
[2:41:04] when I started working I worked for my
[2:41:06] dad
[2:41:07] the people who most of the people who
[2:41:08] worked for my dad were other young men
[2:41:09] from the church
[2:41:13] um
[2:41:14] and so
[2:41:16] being a little on the legalistic side
[2:41:18] there
[2:41:19] when you left the church it was a maybe
[2:41:22] not an openly preached thing but no
[2:41:24] openly recognized thing that you were
[2:41:25] leaving the word
[2:41:27] and that you were not to be associated
[2:41:28] with and so on and so forth
[2:41:31] and
[2:41:36] and so when my dad said those things
[2:41:39] you know I I'm so glad that God gave me
[2:41:43] a a such a Godly father
[2:41:46] that although he never taught us to
[2:41:49] worship the man in any place of
[2:41:53] authority
[2:41:55] we were also taught to respect people in
[2:41:58] places of authority
[2:42:00] and never once was a disparaging word
[2:42:02] brought against those people in
[2:42:04] Authority despite the fact that maybe
[2:42:05] they weren't doing the right things
[2:42:09] and that was so helpful in this
[2:42:12] because my dad had never lied to us
[2:42:16] about anything
[2:42:18] and so when he said
[2:42:20] this is what's going on
[2:42:23] kept it very simple
[2:42:25] we're going to be I feel the Lord's
[2:42:26] leading us on
[2:42:28] to somewhere else
[2:42:32] we didn't distrust it for a moment
[2:42:34] but yet in the same moment you knew
[2:42:38] you never ever
[2:42:40] speak or interact with any of those
[2:42:42] people ever again
[2:42:44] and so there I am that
[2:42:46] a month away from turning 18
[2:42:50] and all of a sudden I went from
[2:42:52] friends now my family was the family in
[2:42:55] the church
[2:42:56] who
[2:42:57] nobody ever thought would do anything
[2:42:59] wrong
[2:43:01] in fact I found it quite comical that
[2:43:03] about two weeks before that they had
[2:43:04] moved me everyone had very specific
[2:43:06] seating
[2:43:07] and they'd moved me from one spot in the
[2:43:09] church where I'd sat
[2:43:11] since for about five years that same
[2:43:13] seat
[2:43:14] they moved me across the church between
[2:43:16] two other young men because they said
[2:43:18] they needed someone with some character
[2:43:20] to help them behave during service
[2:43:24] so I found that a little bit comical
[2:43:26] later not right away but you know
[2:43:30] but immediately that that is what comes
[2:43:33] over you and
[2:43:34] my dad being having a little wisdom and
[2:43:37] knowing that we would need some relief
[2:43:41] he had scheduled for us to take a little
[2:43:43] trip that weekend he'd been in contact
[2:43:45] with a pastor a little a pastor of a
[2:43:47] little group down in Texas
[2:43:50] as we loaded us all up that weekend and
[2:43:52] we left town
[2:43:54] because
[2:43:55] the experience you would have later is
[2:43:58] if
[2:43:59] you ran into somebody they would either
[2:44:01] run in fear
[2:44:03] or give you these looks of hate
[2:44:06] um
[2:44:07] or just be so confused
[2:44:10] so confused
[2:44:14] and it's hard every time that you do
[2:44:16] that by God's grace we've seen great
[2:44:18] things since then but at the time it's
[2:44:21] quite traumatic
[2:44:23] and you know then we went to this place
[2:44:26] in Texas and short long story short as
[2:44:28] we thought we were going to move there
[2:44:30] we thought that
[2:44:32] was going to be our place we thought God
[2:44:34] had provided a church for us
[2:44:37] within a year's time
[2:44:39] a couple of the other families from the
[2:44:41] church we were from had also left and
[2:44:42] joined us and they thought they were
[2:44:44] going to move to that little church in
[2:44:45] Texas too
[2:44:48] and
[2:44:49] it turns out that the pastor of that
[2:44:51] little church hadn't been honest with my
[2:44:53] dad
[2:44:54] he'd been married before
[2:44:56] he had and so at his wife and they had
[2:45:00] children from those marriages
[2:45:02] and he told the other families that
[2:45:07] he had told my dad and my dad had hidden
[2:45:09] it from them
[2:45:11] and we all had our homes for sale at the
[2:45:13] time
[2:45:14] we were all trying to sell my brother
[2:45:15] had sold his home and already moved
[2:45:18] my older brother
[2:45:20] and just like that
[2:45:22] that coming to light there was many
[2:45:25] people in the little church there it was
[2:45:26] a group of maybe 20 about 30 people
[2:45:30] or so mixed congregation
[2:45:33] and
[2:45:34] it split that little group up
[2:45:37] it's the group of people who we thought
[2:45:39] were the only people we had Fellowship
[2:45:41] all of a sudden we're no longer
[2:45:42] interested in fellowshipping with us
[2:45:45] and this was like I said within less
[2:45:47] than a year's time
[2:45:48] of the first
[2:45:50] and
[2:45:52] so just like that all of a sudden now we
[2:45:54] were all alone
[2:45:56] the people who we thought were our
[2:45:58] friends and a little bit of Fellowship
[2:45:59] we had
[2:46:00] now looked at us very differently it got
[2:46:03] straightened out but even with that it
[2:46:05] caused a separation
[2:46:07] you know they went there the way and we
[2:46:09] went went ours and
[2:46:11] it was always a little bit different
[2:46:13] then after that when you would meet them
[2:46:15] and you know I think that has been it's
[2:46:18] been oh my goodness I'm
[2:46:23] it's been almost 16 years
[2:46:27] so it's not that way anymore with those
[2:46:30] families that are still
[2:46:32] attending message churches and serving
[2:46:36] the lord you know we've grown past that
[2:46:38] but at the time it was just felt like
[2:46:40] one thing after another one thing after
[2:46:42] another it felt I very much felt like
[2:46:45] that iron on the forge and God's hammer
[2:46:49] just coming down and coming down and
[2:46:51] coming down and coming down you know it
[2:46:54] you know in your heart
[2:46:58] you know in your mind in the scriptures
[2:47:00] and everything that God's working all
[2:47:02] things for you it's good
[2:47:04] but it's so hard to see the good
[2:47:06] sometimes
[2:47:09] within that same year
[2:47:13] before even the split in the churches
[2:47:15] there or the last I think it was right
[2:47:17] after actually so
[2:47:19] I was we were my brother had moved to
[2:47:21] Texas and he took what was a part of the
[2:47:23] one side of the little split and our
[2:47:25] family now we're still most of the
[2:47:27] family still back in Arizona looking for
[2:47:30] um
[2:47:32] somewhere else to Fellowship we don't
[2:47:34] know where we're going we're trying to
[2:47:36] Fellowship a little on our own and let's
[2:47:38] watch a few Services here and there and
[2:47:41] we tried to you know go visit other
[2:47:43] churches in the area but they a lot of
[2:47:45] people view you very suspiciously when
[2:47:46] you come from a prior group that they
[2:47:49] have
[2:47:51] preconceived ideas about
[2:47:53] and you feel like there's nowhere to
[2:47:56] turn
[2:47:57] and during that same time I had a cousin
[2:48:01] who was just six months older than me
[2:48:03] who
[2:48:04] was was killed
[2:48:06] in inner gang violence wasn't serving
[2:48:08] the lord
[2:48:10] and it just seems like at those times
[2:48:13] Saints it's like one thing after another
[2:48:15] just
[2:48:17] over and over and over
[2:48:20] and I can tell you this young people
[2:48:24] you know we started going to the church
[2:48:27] up in Phoenix at the end of that year
[2:48:28] just because we knew we needed somewhere
[2:48:30] to Fellowship
[2:48:32] the church was two and a half hours away
[2:48:34] from where we lived with no traffic
[2:48:37] so we made it up on Sunday so those of
[2:48:40] you who traveled those of you who are
[2:48:41] far those of you who got to make an
[2:48:43] effort to get places I I know
[2:48:45] I know exactly what it's like
[2:48:48] when you're not when you're at church
[2:48:51] it's the place you are there it's a
[2:48:54] refuge you feel like you're drawing
[2:48:56] strength but you don't want anyone to
[2:48:58] know what you're going through
[2:48:59] because so many times most people don't
[2:49:02] even understand
[2:49:05] I can tell you this
[2:49:07] he understands
[2:49:09] you know I tell people all the time
[2:49:12] I would go to church and and get there
[2:49:14] early
[2:49:15] not because I was so dedicated to church
[2:49:20] okay don't don't get me wrong there
[2:49:23] but I had such a spirit of depression
[2:49:26] afflicting me
[2:49:29] I had so many things going on I you know
[2:49:32] you
[2:49:33] the devil just comes at you at those
[2:49:35] times
[2:49:37] with anything to cause a distraction to
[2:49:40] the pain that you're feeling
[2:49:43] and you feel like you're in a state that
[2:49:46] you'll never climb out of
[2:49:49] and you're just holding on for dear life
[2:49:54] with every last bit of strength you got
[2:49:58] and no one else knows because on the
[2:50:00] outside you look so good
[2:50:03] your family looks so good you look so
[2:50:05] dedicated you're driving two and a half
[2:50:06] hours to church
[2:50:08] wow what dedication
[2:50:10] they tell you
[2:50:12] you're like thank you
[2:50:16] you show up early
[2:50:18] because
[2:50:19] all week long you're only
[2:50:22] your only Fellowship has been you and
[2:50:24] the other people going through the same
[2:50:25] struggles you are
[2:50:27] which is no help at all sometimes
[2:50:31] in fact you don't even want to tell them
[2:50:33] sometimes because you know what they're
[2:50:34] already going through and you don't want
[2:50:36] to add to it
[2:50:39] he said they don't if I add to them this
[2:50:42] thing that I'm struggling with I'll just
[2:50:44] crush them more than they're already
[2:50:45] crushed
[2:50:47] how am I going to share with them that
[2:50:49] how much I'm struggling with this
[2:50:53] things I can remember that depression
[2:50:56] being so deep that
[2:50:58] having suicidal thoughts
[2:51:02] so don't think you're alone don't think
[2:51:04] that anything you go through or any
[2:51:06] situation you you're alone and no one
[2:51:08] else has ever been through that
[2:51:10] or everyone else looks so good that they
[2:51:12] must be just no in fact the better they
[2:51:15] look
[2:51:16] probably the the deeper their struggle
[2:51:19] because we're so good at trying to hide
[2:51:22] things
[2:51:23] putting on a brave face in a nice suit
[2:51:25] and a and a real nice shirt and you know
[2:51:29] showing up and and smiling and laughing
[2:51:31] and just you know how was your week my
[2:51:33] week was great
[2:51:37] inside you're all tore up
[2:51:39] inside you're like I just hope I make it
[2:51:41] till next Sunday
[2:51:43] I hope I can make it till next Sunday
[2:51:45] and I make it back here and I don't
[2:51:46] become another statistic
[2:51:51] but Church getting to church early
[2:51:54] for me
[2:51:56] was
[2:51:57] church was the one place even amongst
[2:51:59] family
[2:52:01] right I could go sit in church close my
[2:52:03] eyes and cry
[2:52:05] and no one would ask you why
[2:52:10] you know why this oh wow that brother
[2:52:11] he's really being moved on by the spirit
[2:52:13] God bless him
[2:52:15] and they don't realize
[2:52:19] God is moving
[2:52:22] you don't feel like it
[2:52:24] God's moving
[2:52:26] but it's that one place you can just sit
[2:52:28] down and say Lord I need you
[2:52:31] I don't know how I'm going to make it
[2:52:32] another date
[2:52:35] father I
[2:52:36] if I thought quitting was an option I
[2:52:39] wouldn't be here
[2:52:41] if I could just crawl into a hole
[2:52:43] somewhere and not come out
[2:52:45] are be done
[2:52:47] it all be over
[2:52:48] you know we tell ourselves these things
[2:52:50] about
[2:52:52] boy I made it because I took a hold of
[2:52:55] the word of God and and I took a hold of
[2:52:58] this specific scripture and and it
[2:53:00] brought me and and I was able to hold on
[2:53:02] to that thing and it brought me through
[2:53:05] and you know I I read this and I read
[2:53:07] that or I took this type of mindset
[2:53:11] to stop it
[2:53:12] stop kidding yourself
[2:53:15] you know I like to tell myself all the
[2:53:17] time I
[2:53:18] the reason why I'm still alive today is
[2:53:21] because
[2:53:22] I couldn't bear the thought of my family
[2:53:24] having to suffer through one more
[2:53:26] tragedy
[2:53:29] I couldn't suffer the thought of maybe
[2:53:32] not seeing seen as being weak or not
[2:53:34] being brave
[2:53:36] I couldn't suffer the thought of the
[2:53:38] pain that others would go through on top
[2:53:41] of the pain I knew they were already
[2:53:42] going through
[2:53:45] and that makes me feel better about it
[2:53:48] but the truth is the reason why I'm
[2:53:51] still here today
[2:53:53] because God was working in my life
[2:53:56] and he took me to that critical point
[2:53:58] and then brought me back
[2:54:01] he took me to that critical point and
[2:54:03] brought me back again
[2:54:05] he took me to a critical point and
[2:54:07] brought me back again
[2:54:09] you see because a few years later
[2:54:13] I've been in church I've been through
[2:54:14] things that had been surviving things
[2:54:17] my younger brother who
[2:54:21] he got baptized at 12 years old but
[2:54:24] whatever it was
[2:54:26] he could just never quite overcome
[2:54:30] he would have good days and bad days
[2:54:31] good months and bad months ups and downs
[2:54:36] the
[2:54:40] it was to a point where
[2:54:43] luckily he was the last born and the
[2:54:45] youngest and my parents just they just
[2:54:48] suffered through it
[2:54:51] but I had my younger sisters got married
[2:54:54] and one of my sisters moved out of the
[2:54:57] house and went and lived with someone
[2:54:58] else from the church
[2:55:01] because that was the
[2:55:02] volatility in the home
[2:55:06] one minute he was happy and helping and
[2:55:08] the next minute he was angry and and
[2:55:10] ready to go to war
[2:55:13] he'd cuss you up and down and threaten
[2:55:15] that in the middle of the night he had
[2:55:16] plans to kill everybody
[2:55:23] no I I've been plenty of places where if
[2:55:26] you took that to the ministry they'd say
[2:55:27] well put him out brother
[2:55:30] if he isn't going to live the life and
[2:55:32] live the word you got to make a decision
[2:55:34] you're going to be for the word are you
[2:55:36] going to allow your your son and your
[2:55:38] daughter to keep living in your home
[2:55:40] like that defiling the home
[2:55:46] but you as a parent got to say Lord
[2:55:48] what is it you're what you're doing how
[2:55:51] is it that you're working
[2:55:52] father help me to be long-suffering help
[2:55:55] me to Lord if this is the cross you've
[2:55:57] called me to bear
[2:55:59] help me to bear it
[2:56:02] and Saints
[2:56:05] he was got to the point where he he
[2:56:08] attempted suicide more than once
[2:56:13] he ended up beginning
[2:56:16] arrested for an altercation
[2:56:19] went to jail
[2:56:21] he went to just the county jail
[2:56:24] for a period of time and my parents
[2:56:26] continued just trying to love him
[2:56:28] making sure they made in contact with
[2:56:30] him made sure he had a little bit of
[2:56:32] money while he was there to you know for
[2:56:35] the different things and so who you
[2:56:38] would realize despite everything you
[2:56:40] might have done
[2:56:41] no matter how far you think you've gone
[2:56:43] we still love you
[2:56:46] no matter which path you choose in life
[2:56:49] we love you anyways
[2:56:51] we want the best for you in your life
[2:56:54] I can remember being with him in the car
[2:56:55] one time and saying Gyra
[2:56:59] I think this life is the best life you
[2:57:02] could live
[2:57:03] this life lived for Christ
[2:57:06] but even if you don't choose that
[2:57:09] I want to help you live the best life
[2:57:12] you can live
[2:57:13] here on this Earth because if you don't
[2:57:15] choose Christ this is all you're going
[2:57:17] to get
[2:57:18] so how could I not want anything but the
[2:57:20] best for you then
[2:57:23] if you can't have the best that I have
[2:57:25] then at least I want the best for you
[2:57:27] you can have
[2:57:29] the very best because that's my heart I
[2:57:31] love you I don't want to see you suffer
[2:57:33] I don't want to see you struggle I don't
[2:57:34] want to see you none of those things
[2:57:37] you see I feel like God has started a
[2:57:40] little bit of tempering in my life
[2:57:45] because there'd been plenty of times
[2:57:47] when I that was not my reaction
[2:57:49] I can tell you that
[2:57:52] it's like someone pushes you you push
[2:57:54] them back you think you're tough I'm
[2:57:56] tougher
[2:57:58] you want to go to war let's go
[2:58:02] that's what the heart and steel will do
[2:58:05] right
[2:58:07] no bending no yielding
[2:58:09] no you know what
[2:58:11] it's all right I love you anyways
[2:58:14] I think God was working and
[2:58:17] you know we won't know a lot of things
[2:58:19] this side of glory and I'm sorry I'm
[2:58:20] doing it again this week I'm holding you
[2:58:22] all really long
[2:58:25] but
[2:58:29] you know coming out of jail
[2:58:33] I just feel like this is so applicable
[2:58:35] to this what we're talking about this
[2:58:37] morning
[2:58:39] and maybe it'll help some of you realize
[2:58:41] it's it's real saints it's real
[2:58:45] we come here and we stand before you and
[2:58:47] maybe you don't you just see a a brother
[2:58:50] that is well known in the church or
[2:58:52] someone who you think I'll must be
[2:58:54] things must be going well for him let's
[2:58:56] not struggle with anything
[2:58:58] I tell you it's not true
[2:59:00] it's not true
[2:59:04] I've been where each one of you have
[2:59:06] been
[2:59:07] I've had the struggles that each one of
[2:59:09] you have faced
[2:59:11] and I can tell you this I'm here by the
[2:59:14] grace of God
[2:59:15] you see
[2:59:17] because he came out of jail going back
[2:59:20] to school quick
[2:59:22] he came out a different person
[2:59:26] from that point
[2:59:28] you know he didn't go back to church
[2:59:30] right away I think there was a lot of
[2:59:31] Shame involved
[2:59:34] like we all would he hadn't been to
[2:59:36] church probably in a good couple years
[2:59:39] but he came the most helpful most loving
[2:59:43] son my parents had ever seen
[2:59:45] you know my dad is always at this point
[2:59:47] he'd always had some issues he'd fallen
[2:59:49] in his back has racked his legs are
[2:59:52] wrecked as a
[2:59:54] physically he's a mass
[2:59:56] and Gyro would go to work with him every
[2:59:57] day
[2:59:59] and be like Dad don't lift that let me
[3:00:00] do that for you Dad
[3:00:02] let me let me carry that for you let me
[3:00:04] let me help you with that don't don't do
[3:00:06] that Dad
[3:00:08] my dad would just so overjoyed
[3:00:11] seemed like the sun they had never had
[3:00:13] had come home
[3:00:15] it seemed like all the work they'd put
[3:00:17] in was paying off
[3:00:20] and I'm gonna bring it
[3:00:22] might tell the last part here
[3:00:25] some of you know it some of you don't
[3:00:28] but this was in 2000
[3:00:32] 2017.
[3:00:33] a year before I got married
[3:00:35] before I came up here we were planning
[3:00:37] the wedding already
[3:00:39] I'd ask Jairo to be one of my groomsmen
[3:00:42] I was
[3:00:44] so happy
[3:00:47] so pleased
[3:00:49] you didn't walk around the house anymore
[3:00:50] attentively thinking okay what mood is
[3:00:52] he going to be in when I run to him next
[3:00:55] there was so much peace in the house
[3:00:59] it was like a whole nother person
[3:01:03] and we had so much hope
[3:01:05] when he was in jail at one of the
[3:01:09] for any of you who might or might not
[3:01:11] know
[3:01:12] you get time slots for your visitations
[3:01:15] whether that's in person or on the phone
[3:01:17] or in by video
[3:01:20] and he had had a video visitation with
[3:01:21] my parents
[3:01:23] and
[3:01:26] um it didn't work and whether it works
[3:01:29] for you or not your time slot is your
[3:01:30] time slot and it didn't work and it
[3:01:33] failed and he was trying to talk to them
[3:01:35] and just
[3:01:37] quit working and he lost his time and he
[3:01:40] got mad and he punched that screen and
[3:01:42] he shattered it
[3:01:44] and
[3:01:46] the system being what it is it's a
[3:01:48] broken system
[3:01:49] it's a broken world
[3:01:52] they added that as a charge that he
[3:01:54] would face later
[3:01:56] to the charges he already had
[3:01:59] and initially he had gone back and
[3:02:00] served a little bit of time finished it
[3:02:02] up come back out no he was out
[3:02:05] and it was about three months after that
[3:02:08] he had his court date
[3:02:10] it was on a Wednesday
[3:02:15] and
[3:02:18] Saints we thought we were through the
[3:02:20] thickest of it all
[3:02:24] we thought the hammering and the forging
[3:02:26] and the heating was over
[3:02:29] we thought finally we were going to have
[3:02:30] a little release
[3:02:34] and
[3:02:36] it was a Wednesday and my dad took the
[3:02:38] day off to go with him
[3:02:40] they got to the courtroom
[3:02:42] and they told him well
[3:02:45] for breaking this item they didn't give
[3:02:49] you an option to pay for it and give you
[3:02:51] an option of a fine
[3:02:54] the only option was another 30 days in
[3:02:56] jail
[3:02:59] and he heard that and he was so
[3:03:02] despondent so
[3:03:05] taken down my dad told me Jared don't
[3:03:07] worry about it it'll be 30 days to be

[3:03:24] you mind if we stop by the bank on the
[3:03:26] way home
[3:03:27] and I said yeah no problem
[3:03:29] stop at the bank gyro goes into the bank
[3:03:32] a little bit later he comes out and my
[3:03:33] dad said you can take care of what you
[3:03:34] need to he said yeah I took care of what
[3:03:35] I needed to
[3:03:38] they come home
[3:03:39] that night and we're all getting ready
[3:03:42] in fact my dad was preaching that night
[3:03:43] if I remember correctly
[3:03:46] and
[3:03:49] came home got ready for church I came
[3:03:52] home
[3:03:54] I got was getting ready for church and
[3:03:56] Jairus that wasn't really going but
[3:03:59] you know my mom and dad went to walk out
[3:04:01] that night and he came over to my dad
[3:04:02] and it wasn't that unusual anymore for
[3:04:04] this to happen
[3:04:06] and he said dad he gave my dad a hug and
[3:04:08] said Dad I love you and I said yeah I
[3:04:09] love you too jira and we'll see you when
[3:04:12] we get back tonight
[3:04:14] I said okay Dad
[3:04:15] same thing my mom and Mom love you
[3:04:19] and they left a little bit later I was
[3:04:21] walking out and he saw him in the
[3:04:22] kitchen there and I said Sarah see you
[3:04:24] when I get back and he said yeah yeah
[3:04:25] see you when I get back
[3:04:27] went to church my dad ministered
[3:04:31] I left first and I was coming home I
[3:04:33] came straight home
[3:04:34] when I got home
[3:04:36] I walked into the house and the lights
[3:04:37] in the kitchen were on and I thought wow
[3:04:40] Gyros must be in the kitchen I walked
[3:04:41] back there and he wasn't there
[3:04:43] I looked down the hall and his bedroom
[3:04:44] door was open was which was unusual for
[3:04:47] him if he was inside
[3:04:48] if you close the bedroom door and I said
[3:04:50] well I went and looked in the bedroom he
[3:04:51] wasn't there
[3:04:52] was just something I just got this
[3:04:54] feeling and I said something's wrong
[3:04:57] something is wrong
[3:04:59] and I went back to the kitchen and there
[3:05:01] was some French doors with blinds on
[3:05:03] them window divided lights and there was
[3:05:06] a porch outside and then just be on the
[3:05:07] porch a little tree we had planted and
[3:05:10] the dirt
[3:05:11] and it just started raining that night
[3:05:12] just lightly raining
[3:05:15] and I
[3:05:17] came into the kitchen and I looked
[3:05:19] through those windows and I looked a
[3:05:21] little bit further and the light in the
[3:05:23] porch was on
[3:05:24] and I looked through and just beyond
[3:05:26] that porch laying on the ground
[3:05:31] there was my brother
[3:05:37] he'd taken the only gun in the house
[3:05:39] that wasn't locked up
[3:05:41] he put it to his head and pulled the
[3:05:43] trigger
[3:05:52] it didn't make any sense to me then
[3:05:56] it doesn't make any sense to me yet
[3:05:57] today
[3:06:00] I know God has a purpose in it all
[3:06:10] I know God's working
[3:06:14] I know maybe it was his the two times
[3:06:16] before that when he tried to take his
[3:06:18] life
[3:06:19] and he was he wasn't right with my
[3:06:22] parents he wasn't right with God
[3:06:25] he was angry at everyone in all of life
[3:06:28] in the world
[3:06:30] God spared his life
[3:06:32] to let him get right
[3:06:34] that's that's what I believe because
[3:06:37] that's what makes helps it make more
[3:06:38] sense to me
[3:06:41] even to my parents
[3:06:44] say why
[3:06:46] is it you see it's a double-edged sword
[3:06:49] is that
[3:06:52] he if he would have passed away when he
[3:06:55] was angry
[3:06:57] it would have been unbearable
[3:07:00] but then passing away when it seemed
[3:07:03] like everything was moving in the right
[3:07:04] direction
[3:07:06] makes it feel like there was so much
[3:07:08] hope
[3:07:09] and now it's gone
[3:07:12] but you see I spoke at his service
[3:07:16] and I said
[3:07:18] Saints
[3:07:22] both in life and in death
[3:07:26] I serve a god who's rich in grace and
[3:07:28] mercy
[3:07:30] and that is what I still cling to yet
[3:07:32] today
[3:07:34] you see
[3:07:35] God knew maybe years before that maybe
[3:07:40] he wasn't able to take his life before
[3:07:41] that because God knew we weren't ready
[3:07:44] he said no they won't be able to Bear it
[3:07:45] yet
[3:07:47] if I take him home now
[3:07:49] it'll be too much for them to bear
[3:07:55] but God will continue shaping your
[3:07:57] character
[3:07:59] working on you day by day
[3:08:01] tempering you and even that I know has
[3:08:05] tempered parts of my life
[3:08:07] because suicide is one of those things
[3:08:10] that all of Christendom and everyone in
[3:08:13] the message
[3:08:15] doesn't know what to do with
[3:08:20] there's pastors out there who've been in
[3:08:22] the message for 30 years plus
[3:08:26] who their only concept of someone who
[3:08:28] would take suicide is don't tell anyone
[3:08:31] that it's even possible for that person
[3:08:32] to have been saved
[3:08:35] because they're worried that it might
[3:08:37] somehow affect their young people from
[3:08:40] getting an experience with God
[3:08:43] thinking that I can just check out a
[3:08:45] life and I'll and and write it off
[3:08:48] they forget the fact that if God has
[3:08:50] something still for you to do neither
[3:08:53] anyone else or yourself can take your
[3:08:55] life
[3:08:57] God is in full control Saints
[3:09:00] and God doesn't care how you go when he
[3:09:03] goes if he's done with you
[3:09:08] God will take you home when he's ready
[3:09:10] until he's ready you ain't going
[3:09:12] anywhere
[3:09:14] we know that look at the prophet
[3:09:16] look at the prophet
[3:09:20] there in that iron stage of the of the
[3:09:23] the forming of his character he said I
[3:09:26] can't handle this anymore
[3:09:29] he tried twice Saints
[3:09:31] he tried twice if it wasn't for God
[3:09:34] intervening we wouldn't have had a
[3:09:37] prophet of God
[3:09:39] he took a loaded gun this man grew up
[3:09:41] with guns since his birth
[3:09:44] he didn't make a mistake with it
[3:09:49] he put that gun to his head and pulled
[3:09:51] the trigger for every single round in
[3:09:53] the gun
[3:09:55] he didn't stop until he had gone through
[3:09:57] all of them
[3:09:58] and it wouldn't go off
[3:10:00] and then he threw it across the room and
[3:10:02] it went off
[3:10:05] he was on an electric pole with high
[3:10:07] voltage power
[3:10:10] and he said it's too much for me to bear
[3:10:12] this critical point you've brought me to
[3:10:14] I can't stand it
[3:10:17] it's too much
[3:10:20] Lord I don't know how you thought I was
[3:10:21] going to make it through this one
[3:10:25] and he took his rubber gloves off that
[3:10:27] were protecting him
[3:10:29] and he put it to that high voltage line
[3:10:31] he said the next thing I remember I was
[3:10:33] laying out on the ground at the face of
[3:10:35] the pole and the shadow of the pole with
[3:10:38] the crossbars formed across
[3:10:44] God said no
[3:10:46] you're in the process and I have a great
[3:10:49] work for you to do
[3:10:51] and your character is going to have to
[3:10:52] be such
[3:10:53] that it's going to have to be exemplary
[3:10:55] before the people
[3:10:57] because you're going to be a wave Chief
[3:10:58] and get an example to them of a life
[3:11:01] live Christ in this age
[3:11:05] you don't get to just check out
[3:11:08] so Saints
[3:11:09] if you think you can just skate out
[3:11:13] on this because it's too hard
[3:11:15] if you think you can just check out
[3:11:17] because it's too hard
[3:11:20] you can run
[3:11:23] but the trials that will come
[3:11:25] to bring you back
[3:11:27] the foraging of the iron will happen
[3:11:31] so it's up to you to choose will I yield
[3:11:34] myself to the Masters
[3:11:38] hammer and anvil
[3:11:42] who I yield myself to the heat of the
[3:11:44] Furnace
[3:11:46] well I willingly take on the character
[3:11:49] of Christ
[3:11:51] to reduce the number of times I need to
[3:11:54] be put back into the furnace
[3:11:56] am I going to be hard-headed and God's
[3:11:58] going to have to beat it out of me the
[3:12:00] whole way
[3:12:01] that you have a choice on
[3:12:04] it's up to you
[3:12:06] this process is going to happen
[3:12:08] nonetheless
[3:12:11] give me the very last picture
[3:12:14] or not the very last one the one with
[3:12:16] the finished product there
[3:12:17] I just want to see you see
[3:12:20] Saints the end product
[3:12:22] is something that's useful
[3:12:25] now this is not going home stage this
[3:12:27] isn't Rapture stage this isn't end of
[3:12:31] life stage
[3:12:32] this just means now that you can be put
[3:12:34] to work
[3:12:35] you can actually be used in the Master's
[3:12:37] service
[3:12:39] depending on how you've been made and
[3:12:40] what you've been made for at his table
[3:12:43] in his workshop at War whatever he
[3:12:46] purpose he made you for
[3:12:48] now you're in the right shape and
[3:12:50] condition to be useful
[3:12:52] oh there will be things in life that'll
[3:12:54] still come where you'll need to be
[3:12:55] sharpened from time to time you'll lose
[3:12:58] your shine and need a little bit of
[3:13:00] upkeep
[3:13:01] but now you're ready
[3:13:03] now you're ready to be put to use in the
[3:13:06] Master's Hand if the musicians will come
[3:13:13] Saints
[3:13:18] whatever stage you're in
[3:13:23] isn't what matters
[3:13:25] what matters
[3:13:26] is to be able to recognize
[3:13:29] that the Master's working on you
[3:13:34] God's doing something
[3:13:38] to realize that you've been placed in
[3:13:40] the Master's Hand and he's forming you
[3:13:42] he's working on you he's shaping you
[3:13:45] he's building your character
[3:13:47] we all are in different stages and areas
[3:13:51] some of us are still in the rough we're
[3:13:54] still in the ore condition some of us
[3:13:56] have
[3:13:57] been actually purified a little and
[3:13:59] Sanctified we've become that iron and
[3:14:01] now the holy spirit is working on us
[3:14:03] it's bringing us to that next step of
[3:14:06] Grace that next step in the
[3:14:10] in the
[3:14:11] statue of a perfect man
[3:14:13] little by little
[3:14:15] it's bringing you all the way to that
[3:14:17] place of Christ
[3:14:19] where you willingly
[3:14:22] will go to the cross
[3:14:24] Jesus didn't go to the cross for himself
[3:14:28] but he went to the cross for you and I
[3:14:32] and the importance of that that I want
[3:14:34] to stress right now isn't the fact that
[3:14:36] he went the cross for you and I
[3:14:38] but it's the example that he gives you
[3:14:40] of what the character of Christ should
[3:14:44] be
[3:14:45] is that it becomes down to you
[3:14:49] you or your brother
[3:14:51] or you or your sister
[3:14:55] that you'll pick up the cross
[3:14:58] you'll pick up the trial
[3:15:00] you'll pick up the struggle you'll pick
[3:15:03] up the fight for all of them
[3:15:07] Jesus should have said I I don't need a
[3:15:09] deal with this I didn't sign up for this
[3:15:14] this isn't my sin
[3:15:17] why do I need to be yielded to this
[3:15:21] why do I need to come under burden for
[3:15:23] this
[3:15:24] this is not my burden
[3:15:27] but he didn't he just said
[3:15:29] not my will but thine be done
[3:15:32] see now he was in the condition where he
[3:15:36] could be used by the father
[3:15:39] all that conditioning that three and a
[3:15:42] half years of ministry was all for this
[3:15:45] one point
[3:15:47] bringing him to the point where God
[3:15:49] could use him in his service for you and
[3:15:51] I
[3:15:52] and that's the point God wants to bring
[3:15:54] us
[3:15:56] is where it's no longer about you it's
[3:15:59] no longer about your problem it's no
[3:16:01] longer about your issue it's no longer
[3:16:04] about you but God has brought you to
[3:16:06] such a tempered place where his
[3:16:09] character is so shining through
[3:16:11] all of the draws and the impurities have
[3:16:14] been beat out on the Anvil of God's word
[3:16:17] all that's left is the character of
[3:16:19] Christ saying Lord if there's anything I
[3:16:22] can do for my brother let me
[3:16:25] and even as Stephen
[3:16:27] preached his heart out
[3:16:31] did everything he could the last thing
[3:16:34] you see is the softness and the
[3:16:36] temperament of Christ in his life saying
[3:16:38] father hold this not to their charge
[3:16:40] they know not what they do
[3:16:44] give me the words to this song
[3:16:48] see that's what it's all about it's God
[3:16:50] dealing with us God working on us
[3:16:52] bringing us all the way to that point
[3:16:54] that character of Christ
[3:16:56] where now he's able to use you for
[3:16:59] others
[3:17:00] that's the whole thing I know it's a
[3:17:03] common saying a life lived for Christ a
[3:17:06] life lift for others and you hear it all
[3:17:08] the time
[3:17:12] but that's what it means
[3:17:14] it means putting yourself under burden
[3:17:17] or somebody else
[3:17:19] not because you have to
[3:17:22] or you're saying Lord let me bear their
[3:17:25] burden because they're too weak to do so
[3:17:28] father let me get under and put my
[3:17:30] shoulders to the wheel
[3:17:31] and help push this thing out of the rut
[3:17:34] it's in
[3:17:37] God will work with you all the way to
[3:17:39] that point
[3:17:40] but that's where he's working you too
[3:17:43] and don't worry he'll get you there
[3:17:47] he'll get you there
[3:17:49] you ain't there yet
[3:17:51] he's got a plan
[3:17:54] sing this song
