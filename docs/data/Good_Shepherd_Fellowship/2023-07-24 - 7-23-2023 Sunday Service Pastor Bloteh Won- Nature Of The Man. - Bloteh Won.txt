praise the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord Jesus and just before we okay let's let's just uh uh let's just take take the word this morning let's read a scripture here and I'll have you sit down I have a lot of them to share every one of them will pretty much mean the same thing to us but uh uh uh I want for us to take care Hebrew chapter 3. let's take Hebrew chapter three we want to use Hebrew chapter 3 just for the reading of scripture this morning and then we will get into what we want to speak again we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus good to see each and every one of you we want to thank you for supporting the meetings last week and thank you brother bill for the sacrifice of taking brother coli back and we we appreciate that praise the Lord and uh we want to just trust the Lord that he will he will be able to come and help each and every one of us this morning praise the Lord you love the Lord he's good let's let's take Hebrew chapter three and uh and the Bible says here wherefore holy brethrens partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priests of our profession Jesus Christ praise the Lord Wednesday Wednesday night we were speaking on on Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ this morning we are reading about the apostle and the High Praise of our profession Jesus Christ let's pray together father we have just read a verse in your word and oh God you said [Music] Heaven and Earth may pass away Lord but not one drop of your word we ever fail dear Lord we want to just pray that you come and meet us this morning and take your word break it to our hearts so father and just pray that you will help me and help the Saints also Lift us up together Lord Jesus as we lift your name Up in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you praise the Lord so we see Paul here uh uh calling our lord Jesus the apostle and high Priests of our profession Christ Jesus and so there's uh we want to continue in our our subject like I said on on uh on Wednesday night we we will go into talking about the nature of the ministry so that's the reason why I read that verse because Jesus is our Apostle amen he is the Apostle of all Apostles praise the Lord in a book uh impeded letter Peter called him the chief Shepherd praise the Lord Paul being the apostle Peter being the shepherd Peter calls him the chief Shepherd so he's the chief Shepherd he's the pastor of all pastors and uh and he's the Apostle of all Apostles he's an apostle because he was sent by God to bring us Redemption and Apostle is the one that is sin praise the Lord the one that is saying is the Apostle now I was trying uh realizing that we we just came through uh last weekend services and uh just trying to be thankful for for for our assembly and the years that the Lord has has kept us together as a church I'm hoping that we can be able to have a a Saturday and and what I want to do is the other uh I want I want you to bring questions of any kind if you have any uh whether you want to bring it that day or you want to just write it and give it to the deacons that would be good we want to use that for uh a question and answer section it would not be streamed online I don't want it to be stream online and also we will use that to talk about some things that is that's that's concerned in the church uh we we they might recall it and then uh uh just keep it in the in the in the Church online icon but we would not I would not want it to be streamed and uh because we'll be talking in-house things so we try to work on a date here and uh and one of the reasons is because just as we went through while uh last week's service and we have brother Stephen giving us a little bit of a history of the beginning of the church and where we are and some of the few things that happened it was very short then I thought it was going to be but it was okay praise the Lord and I think the law designed it that way because the the the the power went off so we were we were having service in the deck but you know there's a scripture for that the Bible says the people that sat in darkness great light shine amen so uh but with that being said and uh trusting the Lord for uh uh the the years and time that is before us I want people to ask questions if you if there are things that you want to know and understand how the church is wrong and how things are done and why this is done and why why you preach long as that question praise the Lord I will be glad I will be glad to answer you why I preach long praise the Lord and and just just ask what any question that you have on your mind and when your question is if your question is so personal we'll pull you aside and we'll talk to you praise the Lord and uh so we are working on a date here but I will hope that is it will be sometime in in August coming up year so we can be able to cross that in and uh and then continue to move praise the Lord because we realize uh uh there's a there's a new crop that is growing here in this assembly and uh from from from Ace many years of experience we have people that are moving from different places we inherit you as a Saints of this church you inherit us as Pastor things and I don't like the way you you used to it being done and we're not doing things like the way you think that it's supposed to be done so let's just find a time to talk about all of that there's that would be the purpose of that service there Saturday and at the end of it we had a we have a prayer meeting praise the Lord so again that if you you have a question anything comes to your mind just write it down give it to the deacons they will give it to us and then we will we'll try to find answer to be able to address it I call into the word praise the Lord I call into the word now so in that same manner I'm taking this subject we started with prisoner of love we will get back to that but I thought that I should go this way uh upon the president of Paul and the Apostle and in that way is going to help us to address few things too that have to do with church order and uh and and and the ministry and and different things around around the local church praise the Lord so this will be more like a Sunday school if you want to call it a Sunday school or a Bible studies but the purpose there is to be able to start to address some of the few things that have to do with the local church and then maybe from your questions you'll be able to give us an inspiration to be able to look at some other things that uh uh uh maybe we that is in our blinds you know our blind spot praise the Lord but we want to say we we love and appreciate each and every one of you that comes here that make this little place a home church and we we thank you for your prayers and we will thank you for your presence and your support whenever you can make it we we don't we don't take it for granted praise the Lord Noah had the grace to preach to animals I don't think I have that Grace so I neither do I have the grace to preach to empty benches I'd rather be on the street corner than preaching to empty benches so we don't take your presence for granted we we respect your presence and and also to each and every one of you that support this church with your Finance through ties and offering we also appreciate that praise the Lord amen but as we look through this subject there are some few things that we would like to would like to address amen and uh I'll read something year that we get into that but I will first I will first start and said you know uh you know the the song leader and uh the musicians we we work with them as uh as people that uh uh actually that are on the under my Ministry and we we see every one of them in some in some way or another as ministering to the church through singing and through playing music and uh and so we try to keep a close eye but you see the uh sometimes we we we get you you know carried away I know brother Lawrence talking about the you know the name of Jesus and and people being persecuted there is a complete difference between persecution and The Squeeze you know persecution is something that uh the church from the day the church was birthed the the church the Bible says Paul says all those that take up the name of Jesus will go through persecution praise the Lord The Squeeze is a period of time it's a period of time where uh you know you look through the Bible it's almost like going through the wine press okay it's a period of time that is set where uh you know we we know with things that are happening around the world no doubt you know we we know that we we want to we do not want to cast things off you know and and say so well you know maybe it is 50 years from now we know that week we can we can see things that are happening we know we are coming right into that time but you see when when you're talking about structural things you want to be uh you want to be very definite why because sometimes when we say things across the pulpit it put things on people's mind okay people thinks on people's mind that's the reason why whether we uh we uh we are testifying or even when we are praying and we we have to watch uh you know the uh those things that that comes in as our personal coming we have to wash that because sometimes people think some people mind and you keep you you put them to a place where they keep thinking and thinking you know well what what it is the word whether it is not the word and then we want to watch all of that but just like I said I have a place right here uh that I wanted to address some of that praise the Lord amen that I wanted to address some of that because I mean even uh I know the deacons try to hand me in the the the the prayer needs when they come in and uh actually uh which which of course is a good thing we can take that time to to be able to bring those things to the Lord and but as we were study together as we look in these things you will realize the other uh in some way the the those things sometimes must be taken up during the service during the song service or the deacons should be able to take them off but it is all because our sun service time uh there's a time I loaded for that and and sometimes when we use the song service time uh just for every other thing that we have to use it for and not being conscious of the time before you before the sun Savvy leader realize you don't even have a time to sink you know and and then we come you know it just it just become a kind of for pleasure so I think that's one of the reasons why the you know we ask that these requests come over to us so we can be able to give a little time of worship and and and and all of that praise the Lord praise the Lord because sometimes uh like I've seen over the years we take personal needs and then and then we started prayer service you know if we're if we are to pray for the need we must just pray for the for the need we must not start a prayer service you know there is a time for a prayer service praise the Lord now so we we want to talk about this we want to talk about this I hope that we what I want to establish here is the other uh uh hoping that we all will realize that this is for the benefit of this local church okay brother Branham says and and we all know there are three things that makes you a member of a local church we will address that and but I was just thinking about it this morning I mean even as as an individual you know as an individual or or in in our homes and in our family one of the principles think is is our present now if you were in that present year this morning not in a sense of you sitting in your seat but if you were not present in this body we will say the person passed his life okay beyond your obligation and your initiatives beyond your obligation even as a human the first thing that uh you need to be a human is to be present in this body that's the first thing that is Major you have to be present in this body and there there are things that you you are obligated to do you must eat and drink to keep this body alive then there are other things that are initiatives you like it you can take that if you like it you can take bath you can brush your teeth or you know and and other things you can find a job if you want to you know or you can just sit down and uh but what you are obligated to do to keep yourself alive is that you must eat and you must drink if you don't eat and drink you'll be dead you will not be in this body your presence will not be filled and that is the same thing that that I have to do with being a member of a local church the first thing that is most important is that you must support that church with your presence praise the Lord and then your tide is an obligation you know because it's established in the word of God you know you're offering Talent offerings are obligation but in the way that it is Set uh uh what you gave us an offering is like an initiative okay you could give a dollar you could give 10 cents you could give you know uh uh even the rare ones and if you put it there we can keep it together and and maybe he can meet some need of the church you know but that's that is that is the way it is said so you just think about it you know there is no way that you can be alive if you are not present in this body if you are not present in the body I mean there is no way that you can be alive now so uh let's turn our Bible to Ephesians chapter four we want to start out from there this morning we will be addressing the the nature of the ministry that's where we stop on Wednesday night will be addressing the nature of the ministry I read a quote from Christ is the ministry of God Christ is revealed in his own word and brother Branham said God has selected the man for the age and selected the message and even the nature of the man the nature of the man you know that's that's going to be the the messenger of the age God was was uh uh you know paid very good attention to his nature so we want to look at uh there but to be able to do it Ephesians chapter 4 is where Paul speaks about the faithful Ministry so we want to we want to start from there this morning praise the Lord we want to start from there this morning and uh Ephesians chapter four we start from verse one ah therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that yeah walk warfing of the vocation wherewith yeah I called you walk wealthy of the vocation wherewith yeah I called we have a vocation our vocation is our calling we have a vocation our vocation each and every one of us here our vocation our primary purpose well being on Earth is to be a son and a daughter of God that's your vocation every other thing you do is your avocation your job is your avocation your school is your avocation and our family life is our avocation but what we are called to do walking worthy of what we are called to do just imagine when God placed Adam and Eve in the garden they are sole purpose was to be son and daughter of God praise the Lord and uh Adam went about and and found the need of naming the animation naming the trees and you know giving names to everything and and that uh uh but all of that came out of his position out of his calling because he identified himself as a son of God he knew that he was an amateur God so then he took the right to go about and do the other thing name the animals name the trees he wouldn't have done that if he did not know his position if he didn't know that he was a Son of God in the first place praise the Lord so Paul is saying in everything we do we must walk worthy of this one thing that you are a child of God that's your vocation you must be able to fit it in every part of your life is not only for the church door is for every part of our life we must walk worthy of our vocation praise the Lord with all loneliness and meekness and long-suffering forbearing one another in love enduring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bound of peace praise the Lord so we come from you know different walks of life every one of us have different uh uh uh you know if we all should give our testimony definitely there will be a different way that God call every one of us what will be similar is that he call us he met us at different times and and all of that but what would be similar is that he call us and then uh in their calling that he call us Paul is saying that we must Endeavor we must do everything that we can to be able to keep the spirit of unity the unity of the spirit in the bound of peace because there are two things they are poor we talk about here is the unity of the spirit and the unity of the faith there can never be the unity of the faith without the unity of the spirit so just in the way that the Apostle Paul presented this you you have to know that he's a wise master builder and in the way that he presented this is just to be he's telling us our duty our sons and daughters of God what we must work for because we I mean every one of us have different appetite praise the Lord God is a god of varieties but yet when he bring us together with our our differences and and and he wants for us to work for one thing is the unity let the spirit let the the the the the unity of the spirit of peace reign among his people and that's the reason why the Bible says if a brother will offend you go and meet him labor try to do something because you want to keep the unity of peace you want to keep the unity of spirit of peace praise the Lord amen if we see something and and and and I mean uh uh we think that it's not according to the message I mean you'll be you'll be completely wrong to just shove your shoulder why because the church is one body we might come from our individual home but this is one body God looks at a good shepherd on 6900 humble Avenue as one body that he said in the corner of this street to be a lighthouse are we together now so the Apostle Paul goes ahead there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God the father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is giving Grace I calling to the measure praise the Lord I call into the measure of the gift of Christ amen even though we are one one body but then that to every every one of us is giving Grace according to the measure so every one of us have a measure of Christ the Bible says no one can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost and if that is your confession this morning then the Holy Ghost is dealing with your heart at least you have a measure to know that Jesus is Christ if that is the only measure you you have it's a measure praise the Lord is a measure the same way that uh a teaspoon of the ocean has every element of the ocean in it even though it's a teaspoon but every element that is in that great ocean is still in that measure of teaspoon praise the Lord so in God's eyes he don't look at your measure more than this person measured no he looks at the component he looks at what each measure have that's what makes every one of us we are the same in the eyes of God are we together praise the Lord wherefore he said when he extended up on high [Music] and give gifts to men knowing that each one of us have a measure when he ascended up her praise the Lord amen when he ascended up of her let's see how David described their let's go to Psalm chapter 24. let's see how David described that we're coming back to to Ephesians here Psalm chapter 24 let's see how David describe their David yeah that that scripture is talking about the extension When Jesus ascended uh uh uh going up Harbor Abraham says he he he he led captivity catches but it also speaks between the days when Jesus was crucified we know that uh uh uh there was a prophecy that corruption will not touch his body so when Jesus died on the cross Peter let us know that he went down to the region of the lost and he preached to souls in prison praise the Lord so even though his body was on the cross but his Spirit was busy now David in the psalm says it like this Psalm 24 the Earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof the world and there that were dead in for he have founded it upon the seed and established it upon the floor who shall Ascend into the hills of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that have a clean hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his sword unto vanities known so deceitfully praise the Lord he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him there seek their face o Jacob Salem lift up your hairs all ye gates and be ye lifted up ye Everlasting those and let the king of glory and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the law strong and might take the law Almighty in battle praise the Lord amen we know that by scripture and by the message of the hour under the old Covenant uh uh uh uh that's that's where we have Paradox Paradise what word the the righteous was going but every one of them were somehow on the influence of uh or the enemy have some some influence on them praise the Lord they were pretty much in the same ring the Bible would let us know about uh Hades you know the uh the Old Testament talks a lot about that but after Jesus died and he resurrected then we realized that uh Paradise was now taking over to the sixth dimension amen and uh uh Jesus parable there of Lazarus and uh and uh and the rich man and now when uh when Lazarus died it shows that he went down and he was in a place and when a rich man died he was also in a place but Jesus said here that uh uh there was a gulf between them praise the Lord there was a gulf between the both places now you have to realize now that this was before the death of Jesus so it was not describing the sixth Dimension because the sixth Dimension has not come yet are we together amen did I throw you over did I left you behind that the parable that Jesus gave about the the the the the Lazarus and the rich man it was only to describe the region that was existing before the Ascension of Jesus praise the Lord amen now in that in that I think that's Luke chapter 16 if you want to look at it in that uh you was you realize that Jesus said the the rich man said ask Lazarus and the only thing that was separating the two regions was a gulf but he was saying ask Lazarus praise the Lord are we together but after Jesus died that was what the Apostle Paul referred to here after Jesus died he led captivity captives so then Paradise Lazarus in all the Old Testament sins were now move away over to the sixth dimension are we together Jesus parable there was not describing the sixth Dimension that's what I wanted to to make us to understand nobody was not describing the sixth Dimension it was describing before the sixth Dimension are we together I want to mm-hmm okay now so there is there is one more let's look also at psalm 68. Psalm chapter 68. I'm not a teacher I'm just trying to build uh a background to be able to enter our subject amen even though I'm not a teacher but by the word I I must be able to teach whatever is we want to hold to in this church as as a Doctrine amen let's read Verse 18 Psalm 68 18. foreign they have ascended on high there are LED captivity captives they all have received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the Lord God my word among them praise the Lord are we together now so uh okay when when brother Branham preached a message the mighty conqueror he says the the the the the important of the the the Ascension of Jesus you know the importance of his Ascension was to create a clear path also the Bible says uh uh he overcome he destroyed principalities and Power praise the Lord he triumphed over principalities in power he was so to get in the heavens and and just make a clear path of every uh uh Supreme spirit praise the Lord amen now uh uh Daniel let us to know that in a time of Daniel Daniel talked about the prince of pressure the the head uh uh uh uh Daniel respond amen the prince of passion even even even stop her uh uh the angel Gabriel uh Angel Michael has to come to the rescue of Angel Gabriel to get doubt their prince of of the power of the air now so we realize that that's those are spirits that are over every nation amen every nation has a spirit every Kingdom have a spirit every age has a spirit brother Branham said if the Prince of Persia held back down in prayer he said walk with the prince of laudisha do praise the Lord amen so we know that uh there is a spirit that is influencing the people into the Last Day activities but you see the Ascension of Jesus Christ was to release the believer from that influence that's why the Holy Ghost is for praise the Lord that's that's what the Holy Ghost is giving to the church for now so but but this is this is where this is where the uh my mind went to for reading this to you the Bible says he has centered up on hide here David is prophesying he led captivity even before Jesus died and ascended he he had received gifts for men yea for the rebellious so it is not only people with the Holy Ghost that are gifted not only people with the Holy Ghost that I gifted praise the Lord amen we have gifted people Alvin even the rebellious even their rebellious now so this also brings us to the place where it make us to to to to to to think and and and and realize with the age that we are living in remember Jesus said the true spirit will be so close that if possible the elite will be deceived praise the Lord so just like how we have uh uh uh A Gifted uh uh children of God we also have gifted rebellious ones and they can use their gift and bring chills on your body but they are not converted now brother Branham will teach us in the anointed one at the end time how man can have truth anointing praise the Lord they can have true Godly anointing but yet wrong that was one of the first thing he stumbled with in his ministry when he went to the Pentecostal people uh he'd never seen uh uh Gifts of tongues and interpretation it was not in the Baptist Church when he got upon a Pentecostal people he saw the gifts uh somebody speaking in tongues another man interpreting he says wow this this this looks like heaven but on a vision he could seize that the man I was interpreting was living against his marriage vow but yet he was interpreting and his interpretation was was right to the point Barbara and says I'm confused he says I'm confused well how how can this be I'm seeing on a vision that this man have a wife here that he's living with another woman praise the Lord even though in the early part of his ministry God was now starts to help him to understand what Paul spoke about in The Book of Hebrew you know God will start addressing there the rain fought upon the just and the unjust amen so you see all of those things brings us to the place as children of God we have a vocation that we must walk worth it off and their vocation we cannot just allow men to lead us wrong praise the Lord that's the thing that brings us to the place where we have to look at these things vary very closely that's I mean there's we we have a big concern uh uh you know some somebody said you know when when all the musicians fail uh the last bus stop where they stop is to sing the name of Jesus praise the Lord because while they know the church is going to buy it just put the name of Jesus in the music the people who buy it praise the Lord but you also have to watch the spirit that is behind it amen you have to wash the spirit you have to wash the life that is behind these people it is not because it says Jesus it means Jesus praise the Lord it could say Jesus and spell Jesus and make something completely different but what I want what I wanted to grab your attention on as we are going into talking about the gifts and the nature of the gifts is this prophecy when Paul repeated his prophecy in Hebrew he never spoke about the place of the rebellious why because he was talking to the Church of the redeemed he was only going to address the five for Ministry but he was caught in he was caught in uh what David is saying right here he gave gifts to men he received gifts when Jesus is centered on high that's why he told the disciples wait in the upper room he went to receive gifts to give to man and the Bible said even to the rebellious that's the reason why we can find people they can preach the word they can they can bring you to your knees without the overcoming power praise the Lord amen so I mean it is it is our responsibility our sons and daughters of God just like it's my responsibility to look into the word to step it and then if I'm if I'm bringing history to you I want to make sure I have the facts I make sure I study I make sure I look at those things and I know that you know to the best that I've gathered together I'm bringing I'm bringing truth to you praise the Lord I know we want to worship I know we want to sing I know we want to praise the Lord but you have your responsibility also to look into those things take your time look at some of your favorite gospel musician go back read about their lives praise the Lord because it's a word of entertainment you don't need the Holy Ghost to entertain you don't need the Holy Ghost to entertain no you just need a bold face either to make people laugh or make people cry that's the reason why that I mean preachers must not be entertainers we don't come to entertain you but that's the age that we are living in that's the age that we are living in and if you are not really looking into these things you could be feeling your spirit with a lot of things just because equal Jesus does not mean there is Jesus right are we together I just wanted to drop this in here so uh uh uh we we can be together it's a scripture that has been very outstanding to my mind every time I look at it he received gifts for the rebellious also that the Lord my word among them praise the Lord are we together back to Ephesians chapter four amen are we together we are back to Ephesians chapter four verse 8 wherefore when he has centered upon high he led captivity captives and give gifts to men Paul was quoting psalm 68. now that he has centered what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he went down to the region of the Lost praise the Lord he went down to the region of the lost brother Branham which says he kicked the door he took the keys of of death from the hands of Satan amen he went down to the lowest part of the Earth this is the law that is strong and mighty in battle amen so I mean there is no there is no law place that you can get to that God cannot reach down to amen if he went down to the lowest part of the earth he can come and pick you up from wherever you are amen now that he extended what is it about that he also descended first to the lower part of the earth he that descended is the same also that extended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things praise the Lord and he gave some apostle and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ amen these gifts are given for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry now what Ministry is that is the ministry of Jesus Christ are we together that Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ uh you know I sit there to say that there is just only one Ministry just like Paul says there is one Faith one baptism amen and and one Spirit you know one hope so there is only one Ministry and that Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ and all of these uh uh uh Ministries here all of these uh uh gifts that I give in to to this man that we want to address this morning and they all come honor that Ministry of Jesus Christ praise the Lord I would just I will open a little a little parenthesis here for you I've seen many times you find people in church and uh maybe they are ministers and or different things you know I mean you you see that a lot in the churches out there you know uh someone has a Praying Ministry and someone has a you know uh a giving Ministry and someone has a you know all of those different things as wonderful as they are you know uh uh in in the same body we can never have individual Ministry it does not work like that no whatever Ministry that God gives it must be a body Ministry and it must all come under one hand the ministry of Jesus Christ the Lord amen you'll find people that are missionaries and and we talk about that too as we go on I realize I'm losing my time here but you'll find that and then uh uh prednisone they are running an individual Ministry I goes to that church but I have my Ministry it does not work like that no it does not work like that if your ministry is not good enough to be subject to the local church then it's better you just be on your own praise the Lord because I mean there are a lot of things that we can we can share also there uh uh in that in their sense and uh uh yeah in that sense but just just to be able to help you you know to you know to to uh to for us to be able to just just grab a mentor picture in our mind there is just one Ministry and that's the ministry of Jesus Christ praise the Lord so these gifts are giving for the Perfection of the sins for the working of the ministry and for the edifying of the Body for the edifying of the body that's what we must do we must edify one another we must encourage one another Paul said in Hebrew we must provoke one another amen that's what the gift is giving for if you have any gifts in you it must be there to edify they must be there to encourage people to provoke people to get closer to God the the gifts are not given as a remote control praise the Lord we have to download your daily life and then control you what you have to do and what the gifts are not giving for that praise the Lord amen if there is anything wrong the gifts must correct because the word corrects the error that gives is giving to clean the church praise the Lord and then also that we cannot subject ourselves to the correction of the give then there is a problem also because it's not just to just pet you on your back and encourage what you are doing no it is there for the edifying of the Saints and it is also therefore the perfecting of the sins the edifying of the body of Jesus Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith yes amen until we come to the unity so you see we must strive for the unity of the spirit until we can come to the unity of the faith praise the Lord we must strive for the unity of the spirit we must strive to to keep an atmosphere in this place we must leave our attitudes outside praise the Lord everything would just not be pleasing to you but you must also ask is a pleasing to God when it's not pleasing to God in your mind that's when you should have problem with it when I think that what is being done yet is now pleasing to God I must have serious problem with it then come and show us that I don't think this thing is pleasing to God because in the word I see it this way it must not be about being pleased into any individual because if we want to please everybody we will end up pleasing nobody one person we want to be pleased is the Lord Jesus Christ are we together amen are we together can I stop preaching because I really have not started yet now let's uh let's let's go to Genesis chapter 3. if I'm really trying to take my time I don't want to be I don't want to be caught up in my flesh this morning I'm trying to slow my emotional wheels down Genesis chapter 3 . foreign verse 23 therefore the Lord God sent him send him Adam him from the Garden of Eden to tell the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man Adam and he placed at the east of the Guardian of eating cherubins with flaming salts which turn every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life praise the Lord So Adam fell we know the story God came down and and and then he gave adam a cloth of skin to dress but what he what is he going to do now is that he's going now to protect this street of life because Adam is now in a falling State he's no longer having a right to the Tree of Life God is now going to protect the treat of life with cherubims now this this will be about the first time turbines are used in the scripture cherubings so yeah cherubins are placed with flaming sauce Cherry beans a place where flaming Souls praise the Lord are we together cherubins are placed with flaming Souls now so uh uh let's let's just stop in their mindset so we can be able to to gather some things here also praise the Lord and uh let's take Psalm 104 Psalm 104 Psalm 104 . sorry if you if you love the emotion of a Preacher I'm not emotional this morning I want to lay all of these things down then I can start to preach Psalm 104 the Bible says here let's go directly to verse 4 who maketh his angels spirits his minister uh flaming fire praise the Lord amen now you will see that uh uh uh now what what what what I want to establish with this is that over in the in the in Genesis we saw God putting cherubins to guide the treat of life and the Bible says they were giving flaming Souls amen now David here on the inspiration picked this up because Paul is going to talk about it in Hebrew so I want for us to see it here before we travel there to Hebrew praise the Lord so David year now he's going to pick this up now see the way that David said it he says who make it his angels Spirits his Minister a flaming fire praise the Lord now what we want to talk about is the nature of the ministry in in Genesis we're seeing God put in cherubins to protect the way to the treat of life praise the Lord and these cherubimes are angels praise the Lord amen so what David is dealing with here is that David is going he's he's showing us in the same sense that the spirit that is on these angels are the same spirits that are on ministers praise the Lord are you are you are you seeing that who make his angels spirits his ministers flames of fire there in Genesis they were giving they were giving uh Fleming swords to guide the way to the treat of life are we together amen I want I want us to to to uh to be able to uh uh uh uh to picture that are you with me okay now so uh let's take uh Ezekiel chapter one if you read Ezekiel chapter one if I just if I just take everything one at a time we will we will we will just be completely out of time but if you read Ezekiel chapter 1 and Ezekiel chapter 10 you will find that word the cherubims at this tribe they have they have four phases they had the face of of a man the face of an ego the face of a lion and the face of an ox they have four faces so so their uh uh uh uh Ezekiel speaks of it praise the Lord and then also in uh Ezekiel chapter 10 he talks about those uh uh uh uh cherubins in Revelation chapter 5 John who identified the same cherubins around the throne praise the Lord and and he will call them living creatures are we together he will now call the same cherubims around the throne that is that Ezekiel sawed he will call them year living creatures and then when they are identify they are also identified the same as an ego a lion an ox and a man praise the Lord so if God made his Angel spirits and his Minister uh flames of fire then we realize that it is the same spirit that has upon these living creatures God is now going to give as an anointing to guide his word to protect his word among his people he gave gifts so he's going to bring that same Spirit now because realize now that uh on the days of Pentecost God is going to come down endured among his people praise the Lord amen so as he's coming down to do it among his people he's bringing the anointing he's breaking the spirit of the living creatures to protect his presence to protect his word it's not going to be cherubims in the New Testament Church but these Spirits are going to come upon men are we together why because David prophesied about it he make his Angel spirits and his ministers flame of fire is is just that it's it's a it's a spirit that minister it's not the man that minister is the spirit is the gift it comes true that China a minister to you and all I have to do is to guide the way to the Tree of Life so now we we have we have identified that these Ministries that Paul is talking about here over inefficient form he gives us some are giving apostles praise the Lord some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers praise the Lord now there are five Ministries but yeah when we look at the living creatures they are full praise the Lord amen now before many years back I thought it was a five-fold in a sense like uh five four that's that's the way I used to think in my mind five full ministry why because it was five Ministry for anointing so I thought it was fivefold no but it's five-fold five that are working under the same leadership of the Holy Spirit so don't go go from here saying five-fold don't be like me praise the Lord amen now so we have five Ministries we have four anointing are we together we have just read where brother Branham is identifying that the man praise the Lord he says yet again I read that from Christ it's revealed in his own word God has selected the man for the age he has selected the message and even the nature of the man and what he will go over in that age what he could put over how he could wave the nature of that setting man praise the Lord so here is God having fall nature one is a nature of an ego the other one is the nature of our a lion and he has uh uh the representation of an ox and he also represented man among the living creatures around his throne praise the Lord amen now so bring in those gifts to give gifts to man he's going to find man that he have called that he have predestinated and he's going to give them now we are born with our nature we are born in our Natural Life praise the Lord but uh uh uh you know just like the way Paul said to the Corinthians the gift of the Prophet is subject to the prophet amen it is it gives us the saints that when God gives a man a gift a do not go contrary to your nature it don't go contrary to your nature it has to go in line with your nature are we together so I'm still laying Foundation so we see here that we have five Ministry and we have five full anointing praise the Lord amen I will I will get into this and then I will read some few things here to you just to be able to to uh place it back in the message and and uh uh find a place to close here now so we see here that Paul says so Psalm was giving apostles now apostles is the is the first uh uh Ministry and in all true Paul letter he identified there as the first you go in the book of Corinthians he said first he gives some Apostle he used that word first he gave some Apostles so apostles were the kind of for first first gift that was identified and it all comes from uh uh Jesus sending out the disciples after they've been taught praise the Lord amen the Bible call him the Apostle of our profession he was sent by God Apostle is one that is sin praise the Lord amen one that is sent so that's how he become the Apostle of our profession which means also our confession praise the Lord so we put him to work when we confess our needs then he can go to the father and intercede for us he can work on our behalf he's the Apostle of our profession praise the Lord but first Psalm was giving Apostles Apostles are the the ones that were sent brother Branham says is generally used as missionaries praise the Lord but even the pastor can be missionary amen someone going out for a particular Mission but when you come under this uh uh uh work of the ministry this gift in the faithful the ones that go out and establish churches establish work establish people in the faith that's their work praise the Lord amen that is their work so after that we have their prophets some Prophets praise the Lord so we have the we have the the the ego amen and we have the The Lion Okay the some giving uh Apostles uh the apostles will come under the anointing of the Lion praise the Lord they will come on the their the anointing of the lion is because this man they are they are men they are that uh that are bold amen they are established you see the Apostle Paul he could go into a place I mean even if it will cause his life they were they are men that are born they have the nature to be born many times people would think is the Evangelist no it's not an evangelist is the apostle they are men they are bored they goes in to region they are able to confront false Doctrine because they have the word amen they are able to confront false Spirit that's the reason why Paul could deal with the things in the Corinthian Church he says a man sleeping with his father-in-law his mother and as communicate him he could deal with those things the nature of the Apostle is a bold nature they are not coming just with dry face they are coming with the principle of the word they can be able to run you from uh Genesis to Revelation and say this thing is not in the word as chapter 15 when some men started creating a Doctrine word they wanted to force the Gentiles to be circumcised they call the apostles come together let's talk about this let's look at it in the word so you see God gives men that has a a gift to be able to confront false Doctrine false teaching false Spirit false manifestation of gifts in the church they can confront it we are not doubting your gift but your gift must come in order are we together now so the next one is that he gave some Prophets praise the Lord and some evangelists the evangelists and the prophet comes under the same nature they are people of High inspiration the evangelists can come behind the pulpit he prayed and he just go he just go he's he's uh he's burning he's burden now to be able to just to just attack any evil and condemn sinning and you know and bring the people back to the word he's honored that so the prophet and evangelists share the same nature they are people that can rise High under their anointing no they are the Apostle in the otherwise he's a solid man histolic he comes and he laying the word down to you just like this just he just laying the word down but the the the the Prophet by vision he can he can go high into uh uh uh inspiration praise the Lord amen now you will see that Paul the Apostle you will also realize that he was a prophet amen he was a prophet so he had a dual Ministry he was a prophet because the word of the Old Testament New Testament was given to him he had the word he could be able to balance the Shadow and the Fulfillment of The Shadow we see right here he took a scripture in psalm to be able to address the fight for Ministry how he ascended so that's he that's he was a prophet are we together but he was also an apostle praise the Lord amen we will find out that in the seven Church ages the age began with a prophet and it ends with a prophet praise the Lord amen and when brother Branham came that's the reason why Brother Band said he says I was never a successful Pastor why because he had a gift of an evangelist and a prophet praise the Lord that's the reason why he could preach the way he was he he preached you know he was he was he was he was very strong on certain things in rebuking immoralities and calling things out and all of that that was just his nature are we together praise the Lord so the prophet and the evangelists operates under the ego's anointing they are people of High inspiration are we together and then some he gave pastors the pastor is honor the ox anointing he's the bedding Bearer amen he's the bed and Bearer and the teacher is honor immense anointing are we together so we have the four phases of the cherubim The Lion The Eagle the ox and the man those four faces those four anointing God gave it as a gift to his church to be able to protect his presence his word in the local church are we together amen now when we go back to Psalm to realize that the Bible says he give gifts to man even to the rebellious the word that said brings us a people that is redeemed you see that's the reason why in the church ages they were able to find those men that call themselves Jews and they were not why because they were taught in the word they were not just cared about emotions they were looking at a man and they were bringing him back to the word no matter what he says he can say I used to be with Paul I slept with Paul they would bring everything you said back to the word praise the Lord why because they knew that yeah they were there were men that were gifted but also they are rebellious spirit now this will go back to our old testament uh time Saul Saul was anointed to be king praise the Lord the Bible says Saul was numbered among the prophets and inspiration came on in he shouted he got excited by the end he had a spirit of rebellion he could no longer be subject toward the word of Samir he was only doing what he thought was right in his mind he didn't care it did not bother him he wanted to he wanted to you know we've been looking in the uh reading the book of of Samia there so it just bring the picture right to my mind I was just thinking about it that day Saul was was was raised up as a captain he was anointed to defend Israel against the Philistines when Saul got so bad under his anointing he left the Philistine he started fighting his own he wanted to kill his son Jonathan from being on David's side he started running after the elite you are you are raised up to fight against the enemy why fight against the people you are called to lead praise the Lord when we have issues we deal with him praise the Lord and we must deal with them according to the word Hallelujah and when we deal with it according to the word we must place it under the blood they don't become our personal issues when we start attacking one another and campaigning against one another those things are not done in a Church of the Living God you can meet men and then we sit down tell me your displeasure and I mean if our offend you assist our brother says I'm very sorry I'm sorry that I did that praise the Lord it will be another thing if I make a sermon out of it and come behind the pooping and start attacking you praise the Lord so you see the the the the the the holy spirit is trying to guide us about these things that's the reason why he wants us to identify the nature of the ministry praise the Lord are we together if you have questions you can add it to your questions so you see that's that's the fight for this that's all preacher that makes makes this thing beautiful one time he says you know like just like Brett Brown said he says those those five families Traders God dress word he says see how beautiful it is it is just like the five fingers and you can you can place it right here I struggle over it during the week but I got it praise the Lord amen this is the apostle you have to realize that uh in the fight for Ministry in the five foot Ministry the apostle is uh uh is the highest office let me say it that way why why I say it that way because Jesus begin with the apostles amen and he is also called The Apostles of our profession now there are just no one Ministry above another but if you want to keep it in chronological order amen before there were pastors placed in local church Apostles went there to start the work let me make it that simple amen so the Apostle you know uh uh have the have the uh how did I call it I said it right just now amen now so the apostles they they are the one there that are in chronological other and uh uh but when it comes to a local church the pastor is the Adam when it comes to the ministry the apostle is the other but when it comes to the local church the pastor is the Adam every other Ministry comes on praise the Lord amen you see that in the life of brother Branham he never went over to people churches and started telling them don't you know I'm the prophet of the age and all he respected what the people did because in the local church the pastor is the Adam praise the Lord take for example even if we had an apostle that came over here to to to Brooklyn Center and started this church and he's the Apostle of the church he started the church now the church has voted his pastor that apostle the pastor become the Elder of the apostle are we together I just wanted to drop that little one in so yeah I was telling you about about this now now the the pointy finger is the evangelist praise the Lord the pointy finger is the Evangelist he said he will tell you right to your face you better be born again amen the Evangelist will tell you right to your face you must repent have you been baptized he would knock his finger on your face he's anointed that way now the the the the middle finger is the prophet he balance he oversees praise the Lord amen and he's he's the tallest singer too you know that this is the pastor finger because he does the wedding he's the marriage finger I'm I'm taking this from uh brother Harry Beckett over in South Africa he says you see the fight for ministry right there he says uh he said this is the teacher he gets in area where other fingers can get line praise the Lord he walks on teen line so God designed it that way God designed it that way brother banham says here Revelation the book of symbol he said Paul said I am a prisoner of the Lord Jesus but he said I magnify my office in the Lord how the love of God constrained him to go among the unclean gentiles who were considered dogs but Paul said I magnify my office now so so what is that what what is that that brother Brandon is driving to to see us here you know because it was his office Peter Peter was uncomfortable with the Gentiles but Paul he could go there to them he magnified his office are we together so that that is the understanding that brother Branham is trying to bring to us here he says that Paul said a magnify my office because he's giving me the the opportunity to go Minister told the dogs otherwise the Gentiles he's just using that amen why Peter was struggling to be accepted Paul never struggled in nature makes him to step in the circumstances he was called to do that right praise the Lord he was called to do it one brother said he said they're so beautifully I can't remember which one of them now but he said it this way he says uh uh many other times we are looking for our gifts and our calling or our gifts in the body he said you have to realize that you are born with your gift the Holy Ghost only come and activate it your gifts are the things that you do and then you don't feel embarrassed about it right it just flowed naturally you enjoy doing it if you are doing something you have to look over your shoulder whether you are looking for a man to see you or you want to be I please her or you are embarrassed about it it's not a gift you are you are just doing it it's good that you are doing it but if it is your gift you get right in there you you don't you don't think twice about it because it's part of you give and calling out with our repentance that's what the scripture says so it's in you most of the time we we we wanted to we want an angel to come and tell us we want an angel to blow the trumpet and says my son this is your gift but it's right there in you the things that you love to do for the Lord with nobody telling you you enjoy it not the things that you love to do to make yourself sane or you love to do what I I mean to talk to uh to get something or another but it flows because it's part of you the more you the more you get in love with God and you live a consecrated life it just flow out of you praise the Lord some people they don't think twice so even as as you know tell somebody about Jesus or tell somebody that they are a Christian they don't have to think twice it just come out of them but when you have to start calculating and start thinking which Bible verse just leave it just forget about it alleviate because you make a mess well that is just parenthesis Paul says I magnify my office amen now you'll find the same thing there over in the book of uh uh Joshua the Bible says the law magnified Joshua before the people the people have just come from honor Moses Ministry word they have seen the supernatural the supernatural now God will do something in the ministry of Joshua to wean the people heart so they will not be comparing Joshua to Moses and you find that many times people come from on a certain Ministry and they move to a certain place it's not about I think I mean they they have so enjoyed that Ministry they like the way things done and pretty soon the human nature put you to the place where you start comparing praise the Lord sometimes it's a good thing sometimes it's a bad thing because if you get stuck in that you will never see what God is doing in that local place you will be in this place and then you'll be having church somewhere else because that's what you are used to all the time but what will happen sometimes is that God will use the local Ministry to do something where he can just grab your attention and in that way he magnified that Ministry to you now you can trust it praise the Lord I I don't have to come and preach and says I mean you got to believe me you may have been all here that's why you don't believe me I mean you got to believe me I'm telling you the truth y'all got to believe you are just you are just wasting water on door back the way God does this is that the ministry labor with the people and God will do something he would do something that would just magnify their Ministry and right there you start to trust that ministry that's the way it works that's the way it works praise the Lord amen now if when God established a Ministry before the people I don't I don't have to look for uh uh you know uh uh to to to to to find somebody to pray for every Sunday before you can believe that really and you know I'm really spiritual no when the ministry is magnified before the people what God will do most often you will see that and for for a long time uh you know you know as a preacher you thinks about it because you go out of your local church and then Supernatural things will happen then you ask yourself why why is it not happening back home because you don't need it amen because the reason why God would do those things is not to vindicate the man the reason why God would do that is to vindicate his word so if God has already by the grace of God granted you favor with this person amen that you can believe what they preach to you God don't need to perform Miracle every Sunday no he don't need to well if you need miracle then God might bring Miracle your way if you say Lord accept this brother heal the sake I can't believe him then God might bring it your way if he pleases the Lord or maybe he's not just the person to pass to you because the truth about the matter there is the other not every man is designed to Pastor you that's just the truth about the matter are we together so Paul says here I have a a magnify my office because he could identify that he was called to the Gentiles are we together let me just read one of two things here and then uh uh uh this will help us as we look out of this now now okay this is one of the things that I would have read to you earlier brother Brown says here he says Church order he talks he says now remember the Deacon is a policeman and a deacon office is actually more straight than most any office in the church amen I don't know of any any office any more straighter than the Deacon office because if you read the scripture you will see that the same qualification for a pastor is the same qualification for a deacon that's why butter Brandon means when he says the decom office is the most straightest office praise the Lord amen a man is not choosing as a deacon because he's a friend to the pastor no there's a scriptural qualification is the most straightest office now he says that's right because he got a real job and he got and he's God's man he's he's God's man just as much as the pastor is God's man certainly he is he is God Seven praise the Lord now uh so we see here that uh uh uh over in the book of Arts where deacons were introduced the Bible says that the apostles says so we can give ourself to the word and to prayer choose a man that are filled with the Holy Ghost so they can take care of the Affairs of the people now so that's what brother Branham means it's an office that comes between the people and the ministry amen praise the Lord instead of the pastor being at the baby showers the baby birthday amen praise the Lord birthday party all the pastor didn't come to my birthday party he will not have a baby shower scripturally he must give himself to the word and to prayer praise the Lord that's what he must do he must give himself to the word and to pray yeah then the deacons must be able to step in and and be able to serve the people in uh in in in the roles of their activities praise the Lord then he also says this now listening to this now gives and calling now let's uh uh Ellie spiritual experience now let's get back to what they are God set them aside God placed them in the church I think I will find a place to close right here is a good place to close God gave Sarah as he will is that right not as I will but as he will now if God want me but I'm talking himself God want me to be a lay member of the church I would rather he says I did be better off a lay member then I will be a preacher amen all right I would rather be a lead member and then I will be a preacher you see so this message has produced some of the smartest preachers on the Earth praise the Lord because I mean you can go and talk about serpent seed and people will just say wow wow I never heard that it's in the Bible praise the Lord and then maybe your ministry can start from there praise the Lord I know many that that over the years that have even come into conflict you'll find brother Branham dedicating baby and he says Lord I dedicate this boy may he be a minister and definitely people cling to that and they think brother Branham give that child a Ministry well I wish all the brothers here will be minister praise the Lord then let's get the work doing praise the Lord amen I mean I mean that's that's pretty much the same where Moses said I wish every every man here will have have the spirit and then the work will become easier so people comes into that into those conflicts they watch over their child the child grow you know brother Brian pray over you to be a pastor then that thing get in the child head praise the Lord about the Bible to put it under the child and to stop propping him up praise the Lord well I mean I mean school days we get we get we get uh we get excited you know we we like to witness for the Lord you know and and we go with this and then we lead souls to Christ you know we testified about God and and and and I mean you just you just have that burden at that time God puts you to a place because he knows Elites are there they are going to respond to the word but you know the part the Apostle Paul says every man should wait on his ministry that comes different because you lay souls to the Lord does not make you a Ministry make you a minister are we together amen it's an anointing it's a burden that comes now I'm saying this now let me go right ahead brother Branham says I'd rather be a limit than to be a preacher he says see because I will only bring reproach somewhere along the line when a man is not called to do it you will bring reproach along the line praise the Lord amen I mean I remember being so terrified to be a preacher to stop preaching even though I was I was preaching but to stop preaching I don't know what I'm saying but I'm saying it anyway you know as I was going out to the hospital and and going over to the the praising and all of that but just to take on the ministry that was very very terrified until I was at a place what I was I was praying and asking the Lord some let something happen let something happen something bad should happen praise the Lord because I was I was terrified I mean I was terrified I was terrified and then so what happened there we had we had group of brothers that we were meeting and and we used to encourage ourselves back 1993 we would meet and but then the thing about it there is that every time it will fall back on me what we are doing you know what what we are doing okay what what does this say and what happened also God God blessed me and at the time I was traveling at that time the only my only property I had was just message books the few message books that I had that was my only property that I had on Earth so when I got and met those Brothers you know yeah we had a little material that we could work with and all of that so uh we started we we joined ourselves to a Pentecostal brother that we met in a church and this guy was a fire restrict evangelist my goodness he can get on the street and I mean that oh my goodness the guy can he can preach and I mean we were there there was some scriptural truth that we spoke about you know he he just couldn't see it at the time so but it was all all because of my fear I never wanted to to to to start leading people in the sense of a Ministry but by the grace of God we knew what the verse is you know and there were some few things that you know we would sit down and talk about now he had his understanding because he was from United Pentecostal church and he believed that uh you know that we didn't know how the Holy Ghost because we were not speaking the tongues so there are things that were that will happen in the church you know you give the he has some of uh you know some some people with him that came back from the same church and there was something that happened early one morning around seven o'clock in the morning I saw this this brought it over to my house he was ordering us at the time he came over to my house and Bam out the door we came I came outside I said what's wrong he said brother I need to talk to you he pulled me the side because he he knew that I had some some uh how can I call it now some influence over the brothers he knew that in some way they were looking towards me you know so he pulled me the side and then he told me what happened he told me what happened and uh and I want to go into the detail of that and uh and then when he told me there he just told me he says he told me he said he said you know I have always struggled when you told me that giving callings without repentance that a man could have a gift without the Holy Ghost I've always struggled with that but now I believe it this is now I believe it amen praise the Lord because I mean with the way that he was electrified in his gift I mean he's an evangelist the way he was electrified in his gift I mean we met because we're at a Pentecostal church and he was preaching and I mean me and the brothers thought well I mean we were the firing line I mean we were shouting preaching you know so after that he made contact with us but to just realize the things that he was caught in at the time he just he just told me so now it put me to the place where you have to do something I just told him you know I respect everything you know we talk we pray along with him just just a young young man at a time but then I just told him I said well because of this just to realize that you knew all of this and you never said nothing about it we can't continue together so we we will break away down we are on our own what are we going to do so then by the grace of God we started working with the brothers and started working with the brothers and and uh by God's grace the church was birth at the time now so I want to say this because brother Brandon said you would bring you would bring reproach somewhere along the line he said and it will be some something that will bring reproach if if he's called to be a deacon it's better for me to be a deacon then I will be to be a minister but if he's called call me to be a minister I did better off a minister then I will be to be a land member is wherever God has called us and set us in the church for his seven then we fit better praise the Lord amen then we fit better are we together praise the Lord we will stop here we we still have more to cover on the subject but I I wanted to use this time just to talk about the nature of the ministry and even to talk about the nature of the ministry I was I would say this you know as I'm as I'm dealing with nature you know uh uh God gave us Natures for different things that he call us to do okay let me let me read something to you I said that was the last one I read to you but something just popped in my mind yet it's not part of my nose there but it will it will it will bless you just to see how God deal with us as his children amen just to see how he deal with us as his children of this this thought came to my mind if I can find it now and I would share it if I can't find it then I would have to do it another time [Music] because I mean there are things that we we want to we want to watch you know we want to watch I would not want to paraphrase it if I can find it then I will I will I'll try to read it another time I know I have it here but maybe I did not put a subject on it which of course is a bad thing that I do all the time it's hard for me to be able to to find things that way if I don't put a subject on it praise the Lord but every one of us I mean the things that we we are called to do do for the Lord uh we want to make sure that uh by the grace of God we are walking we are walking in the light of God's word uh we know we are following his instruction you know because he never fails yeah he never fails praise the Lord God call us and uh okay no that's that's not what I want to read but uh I I will get it and then I will bring it to you that would that will make it perfect sense I don't want to to start something here then and uh and just paraphrase but uh uh we are all called you know when and God these with us I call into our nature I mean even even as our young people you know uh uh uh you know we choose our path of career and things that we go into you want to watch all of that you know you want to watch all of that because when we started this series we spoke about uh Paul being called caught between his calling and his ambitions he had an ambition to be a Pharisees he had an ambition he wanted a place of authority praise the Lord he never even had an idea that he he was he was predestinated to be a prophet of an age he was predestinated to be an apostle to the Gentiles he were predestinated to be the one that would bring the New Testament book so he got he got caught between there he struggled between that all of his lives the road of Damascus made a difference for him amen and that's what we all need we need the road of Damascus you might not have a light kicking you off at us but you need a place where God have to bring you to attention praise the Lord or as you will just wander in your Christian Life you were carried oh I know uh brother Brandon is a message the messenger a baptized in Jesus name all you can talk about this other message you talk about this all the preacher talk about this other uh subject but you are never settled you are never settled where you are setting in your spirit what you are called to do you are just all over the place praise the Lord so we talk about the faithful Ministry but it's not only the fight for Ministry we know that they are nine spiritual gifts praise the Lord Paul talks about the people that I give to us you know a gift of help a gift of administration and all of those other things the thing that we want to find out is how am I a blessing to the body how am I a blessing to the body praise the Lord amen how am I a blessing to the body if we find a statement that has been prominent around the church salvation is an individual affair that's a that's a prominent statement around the church but it's not scriptural in the sense that we think about it it's true salvation is an individual affair but not you as an individual is he as an individual it is his effect salvation has never been your faith ability it is his affair so most of the time when people think salvation is an individual affair they take it in a selfish way I don't have to mind while other people saying I don't have to do what other people say I'm going to serve God the way I know it it does not work like that it does not work like that he is the individual it is his affair now you as an individual when has salvation become our effect when we were all lost he's the one that came to save us he's the one had an appointed time that came down to save us then when have it become our Affair that we think we can Champion it it is his affair praise the Lord so he deal with us as a body that's the reason why he never throw us down from Earth from heaven you jump in the jungle you go here no he brought us through a family he gave us father and mother for us to be breath on Earth that's the same way he deal with his church he brings us through a body that we can be connected to spoken word is the Original Seed that's what the prophet said life comes through the body it comes through the body and that's how God deals with us are we together let's buy our house together now pleasing let me be pleasing to you sorry for taking your time but don't worry I have more of your time to take let's buy our house together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus trying to talk about poor appraising her a prisoner of love by the Holy Spirit Lord to just go this route now oh God we can't just bring a sermon Lord just to preach a good message Lord father but we have a responsibility to to challenge the people we have a responsibility to establish to people we have a responsibility law to call the people to come up higher to get out of our shares and and get out of our flesh and come

your Prophet said your body was the sickest body father Lord on Earth he said the body of the Lord was the sickest body but after the opening of the seals Lord your prophet never use that statement because the fullness of the word was to bring healing to the body if your body is the sickest body you can heal the sick you raise the dead Lord you can restore miscellane called Godfather and that's what we want to do we want your word to bring healing we want to be established in your word we want to be established in truth Lord because we know that God this message is the Pillar of Truth we just don't want to be floating around Lord only believing oh I believe brother Branham as a prophet about us in Jesus name no we want to find our place it's either we part of it or we are not you don't have a loose member Lord you have all your members in place [Music] we just we love you we appreciate you God may you Lord father thee with our hearts Lord thee with our hearts you know where we

father the richest man on the earth we must be a Son of God we must be a daughter of God and we want to walk worthy of that father your Prophet said a life of excuses is not worthy of the Gospel we want to lay as our order for our excuses as the father help us Lord when you met Paul on the road of Damascus he said Lord what will you have been do what were you happy dude I thought I was doing my
