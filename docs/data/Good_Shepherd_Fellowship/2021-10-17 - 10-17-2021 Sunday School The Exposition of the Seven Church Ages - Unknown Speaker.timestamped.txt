[3:18] but also it is virtually repeated in an
[3:20] age that is over a thousand years later
[3:23] revelation 2 9
[3:26] i know thy works and tribulation and
[3:29] poverty but thou art rich and i know the
[3:32] blasphemy of them which say they are
[3:34] jews and are not but are the synagogue
[3:36] of satan
[3:38] to begin with the word jews does not
[3:41] describe the religion of the jewish
[3:43] people
[3:44] it refers only to the people of judah
[3:46] and has the same precise meaning if i
[3:48] were to say i am irish born
[3:51] these people were saying that they were
[3:52] actually jews real jews by birth
[3:55] they were liars
[3:57] they were not jews by birth and they
[3:59] weren't jews by religion
[4:01] if all this is true what were they
[4:04] they were a deceived people who were
[4:06] already part of the church
[4:08] they belonged to the false vine
[4:11] they were not of the true church but of
[4:12] the false church because god said
[4:15] they were the synagogue of satan
[4:17] now the word for synagogue is not the
[4:19] same word we use for church
[4:21] in the bible church means the called out
[4:24] ones or the summoned ones
[4:26] the psalmist said about these elect
[4:29] people
[4:30] blessed is the man whom thou choosest
[4:32] and causest to approach unto thee that
[4:35] he may dwell in thy courts
[4:37] psalms 65 4
[4:40] but the meaning of synagogue is assembly
[4:42] or gathering
[4:43] this can be good or bad but in this case
[4:46] it is bad
[4:47] for these are they whose assembling is
[4:49] not of god but of their own selves
[4:52] isaiah said of them
[4:54] behold they shall surely gather together
[4:56] but not by me whosoever shall gather
[4:59] against thee shall fall for thy sake
[5:02] isaiah 54 15
[5:05] and since these were surely against the
[5:07] true vine god will one day deal with
[5:09] them in destruction
[5:12] now why do we have a people mixed in the
[5:14] framework of the church and calling
[5:16] themselves jews
[5:17] the reason is this
[5:19] since they were liars they could make
[5:21] any claim they wished they could say
[5:23] what they wanted as though it were a
[5:24] fact and then stick to it
[5:26] and in this case they could be lying
[5:28] with a very powerful thought in mind
[5:31] was it not so that the early church was
[5:33] almost if not entirely composed of jews
[5:36] making them the original members of his
[5:38] body
[5:39] the twelve apostles were jews and the
[5:41] later apostles were either jews or
[5:43] proselytes
[5:45] thus for men to swear they were jews
[5:47] would give them a preeminence and a
[5:48] claim to originality
[5:50] tell a lie stick to it
[5:52] never mind fact or history
[5:54] just say it and keep saying it to the
[5:56] people and soon the people will receive
[5:58] it
[5:59] now did you catch something there
[6:01] isn't that the same spirit right in the
[6:03] church today
[6:05] isn't there a group that claims that
[6:07] they are the original and true church
[6:09] and that salvation is found only in her
[6:11] don't they claim that they have the keys
[6:13] of the kingdom which they received from
[6:15] peter
[6:16] don't they claim that peter was their
[6:18] first pope and that he resided in rome
[6:20] when there is absolutely no historical
[6:22] fact for it
[6:24] and even her most educated and knowing
[6:26] adherents believe her lies satan's
[6:29] synagogue
[6:30] and if satan be her father and he the
[6:32] father of lies then it is not strange
[6:35] that those in his synagogue are liars
[6:36] also
[6:38] consider the thought of blasphemy
[6:41] these of satan's synagogue were not
[6:42] blaspheming god in this instance though
[6:45] that goes without saying
[6:47] but they were blaspheming their true
[6:48] church
[6:49] certainly as cain persecuted and killed
[6:52] abel because he cain was of that wicked
[6:54] one
[6:55] and as the dead formal judaic followers
[6:58] jesus said they were of their father the
[7:00] devil tried to destroy the christians in
[7:02] the first few years of the first age
[7:05] now this same group the false vine
[7:07] is even more strongly attempting to
[7:09] destroy the true believer in the second
[7:11] age that antichrist spirit is
[7:14] growing the group that inched its way
[7:17] ever so slowly into the church by its
[7:19] deeds
[7:20] nicolaitanism no longer fears exposure
[7:22] but is openly organized in a group of
[7:24] its own assembling and is coming against
[7:27] the true church in undisguised hostility
[7:30] now when i say this was an organized
[7:32] antichrist church
[7:34] i am giving you the truth from
[7:35] authenticated history
[7:37] the first church founded in rome we will
[7:40] trace its history in the pergamon age
[7:42] and already turned the truth of god into
[7:44] a lie by introducing a pagan religion
[7:47] with christian names and meaning
[7:49] by the second age it was so pagan though
[7:52] claiming to be the true church that
[7:54] polycarp came about 1500 miles at a very
[7:57] old age to plead with them to turn back
[8:00] they would not do it
[8:01] they had a solid hierarchy and a solid
[8:03] organization
[8:05] and a complete departure from the word
[8:07] this then is satan's synagogue
[8:10] full of blasphemy in which were already
[8:12] the siege of the doctrine of
[8:14] nicolaitanism and which would shortly be
[8:16] the actual seat or power of satanic
[8:18] religion
[8:19] and this is exactly right for revelation
[8:22] 2 9 b
[8:24] does not say these people are of satan's
[8:27] synagogue but it says they are satan's
[8:30] synagogue
[8:32] this spirit of antichrist is not new
[8:34] this is not something that just came in
[8:36] the church ages
[8:38] it has been here all along to get a
[8:40] clear understanding of how it works how
[8:42] it goes against god and takes over in
[8:44] the church look at the old testament and
[8:47] see it there
[8:48] let us examine this spirit as it was
[8:50] manifested in israel as she came out of
[8:52] egypt to be the church in the wilderness
[8:55] just as the early church started out
[8:57] under the pure ministry of the holy
[8:59] spirit with signs and wonders and
[9:01] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[9:04] and interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[9:07] healing
[9:08] so in the days of israel when they left
[9:10] egypt they were under the leadership of
[9:12] the spirit of god manifesting in gifts
[9:15] god was the leader of the people
[9:17] actually he was their king
[9:19] he was a father king he took care of
[9:22] israel like a man cares for his family
[9:25] he fed them fought their battles
[9:27] smoothed away their difficulties and
[9:29] settled their problems
[9:30] he just busied himself over them
[9:33] they were the only nation to which he
[9:35] was truly god
[9:37] but one day they got to looking around
[9:39] and they saw the philistines and other
[9:41] nations with kings over them
[9:43] it caught their eyes and they decided
[9:44] that they ought to humanize their
[9:46] leadership so they wanted a king
[9:49] now god was going to humanize the
[9:50] leadership himself in the person of the
[9:53] lord jesus christ but they got ahead of
[9:55] him
[9:56] satan knew the plan of god so he put it
[9:59] in the hearts of the people to get ahead
[10:00] of god
[10:02] the
[10:02] word
[10:04] when they approached samuel and asked
[10:06] for a king
[10:07] samuel was so dismayed that his heart
[10:09] almost failed him
[10:11] god had been leading his people through
[10:12] this consecrated scripture vindicated
[10:14] prophet and he felt that he had been
[10:16] rejected he gathered the people and
[10:19] pleaded with them not to turn away from
[10:21] the god who had carried them like
[10:22] children and prospered them and blessed
[10:24] them
[10:25] but they persisted
[10:27] they said to samuel
[10:29] you have never been wrong in your
[10:30] leading you have never been dishonest in
[10:33] your financial dealings
[10:34] you have done your best to keep us in
[10:36] line with the word of the lord
[10:38] we appreciate the miracles wisdom
[10:40] provision and protection of god we
[10:42] believe in it we like it
[10:45] and furthermore we don't want to be
[10:46] without it
[10:47] it's just that we want a king to lead us
[10:50] to battle
[10:51] now of course when we go out to battle
[10:53] it is still our intention to have the
[10:54] priests go ahead with judah following
[10:57] and we will blow the trumpets and shout
[10:59] and sing we don't intend to stop any of
[11:01] that
[11:02] but we want a king who is one of us to
[11:05] lead us
[11:06] and god said to samuel
[11:08] see they have not rejected you
[11:10] but they have rejected me from ruling
[11:12] over them how tragic that was
[11:16] little did they realize that when they
[11:18] were asking god to let them be like the
[11:20] rest of the world they were rejecting
[11:22] him
[11:22] because god had ordained that his people
[11:24] act different from the world
[11:27] they are not of the world and they don't
[11:29] look like the world and they don't act
[11:30] like the world
[11:32] they are crucified unto the world and
[11:33] the world is crucified unto them
[11:36] second corinthians 6 17-18
[11:39] wherefore come out from among them and
[11:41] be ye separate saith the lord and touch
[11:44] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[11:47] you and will be a father unto you and ye
[11:50] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[11:52] lord almighty
[11:54] you see the one difference between
[11:55] israel and the rest of the nations was
[11:57] god
[11:59] put god to one side and israel was like
[12:01] any other nation
[12:02] when samson cut off his hair he was like
[12:05] any other man
[12:06] put the leadership of the holy ghost
[12:08] aside and the church is nothing but the
[12:10] world with god's name attached to it
[12:13] the world and the church are all of the
[12:14] same lump just like jacob and esau were
[12:17] of the same parents but the spirit of
[12:19] god makes the difference
[12:22] it doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[12:23] christian
[12:24] anyone can do that
[12:26] the point is whether or not you have the
[12:28] spirit of god in you for without that
[12:30] spirit you are reprobate you are none of
[12:33] his
[12:34] amen
[12:35] not too long ago i asked a lady if she
[12:38] were a christian
[12:39] she said to me
[12:40] i'll have you know sir that i burn a
[12:42] candle every night
[12:44] what in the world has that got to do
[12:46] with it
[12:46] i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a
[12:48] pentecostal
[12:50] that hasn't a thing to do with it it is
[12:52] the holy ghost or parish
[12:55] while starting way back there in the
[12:57] first church the people got to thinking
[12:59] and reasoning how to improve on god
[13:01] the deeds of the nicolaitans began
[13:03] showing themselves
[13:05] then a group formed
[13:06] they drifted away from the pattern of
[13:08] the word
[13:09] all it takes is just one word changed
[13:12] and that little levin then leavens the
[13:13] whole lump
[13:14] he that offends in one point of the law
[13:16] is guilty of all
[13:18] eve just changed one word
[13:20] that will do it
[13:22] and when that satan-centered group was
[13:24] formed it began to hate and to fight the
[13:26] true believers insisting that they the
[13:29] aliens were the church of god
[13:32] notice how organization breeds hatred
[13:34] it destroys fellowship it makes
[13:36] bitterness
[13:38] that is what myrrh means this is what
[13:40] smyrna was full of bitterness
[13:43] a root of bitterness defiles many
[13:46] so more and more defilement was coming
[13:48] in
[13:49] every age would feel its scars
[13:52] the smernian church had drifted far from
[13:54] the original it had become a hybrid it
[13:57] had hybridized itself the way eve did
[14:00] you know that a hybrid is what comes of
[14:02] two species mixing
[14:04] the result is no longer pure like the
[14:06] original it is mongrel
[14:08] well when eve allowed the beast to
[14:10] mingle his seed with hers
[14:12] she produced a creature called cane that
[14:14] wasn't pure human
[14:16] he was of the wicked one
[14:18] notice how different he was from abel
[14:21] notice how different he was from seth
[14:23] he hated god and would not obey the word
[14:25] and persecuted and killed the righteous
[14:28] he set himself up above the word of god
[14:32] the church too has departed from what
[14:33] she originally was
[14:35] she is a hybrid
[14:37] that is the church nominal is a hybrid
[14:40] people say
[14:41] i am a baptist
[14:43] it wasn't so in the beginning
[14:45] i am methodist
[14:47] it wasn't so in the beginning
[14:49] instead of the straight word of god
[14:51] instead of the spirit-filled men in the
[14:53] church who were led by spirit given
[14:55] revelation
[14:56] there are now creeds and bylaws
[14:59] and the educated guesses of educated men
[15:02] learning has taken the place of
[15:03] revelation
[15:04] reason has replaced faith
[15:06] program has replaced spontaneous praise
[15:09] in the holy ghost
[15:11] it wasn't so from the beginning
[15:13] the whole specie has changed
[15:15] it has become a hybrid church
[15:18] now then when the church becomes
[15:20] hybridized will it produce pure
[15:21] christians
[15:22] it can't
[15:24] the life or seed that brings christians
[15:26] to birth is not in them
[15:28] like brings forth like
[15:30] the baptists bring forth more baptists
[15:32] and they act like baptists
[15:34] methodists bring forth methodists and
[15:36] they act like methodists
[15:38] not one is known by the power of god nor
[15:40] can they be for it's not there
[15:42] they are known by their ceremonial
[15:44] worship of god and their creeds and
[15:46] dogmas
[15:47] talk about a hybrid
[15:49] do you know the most famous hybrid in
[15:51] the world it has been with us for ages
[15:54] it is the mule
[15:55] it is a cross between a donkey and a
[15:57] horse
[15:58] he is a funny kind of an animal he can't
[16:00] reproduce himself
[16:02] he has no life that can do that
[16:05] yet talk about work
[16:06] he can outwork the horse or the donkey
[16:09] but watch his nature
[16:11] he is stubborn and you can never trust
[16:12] him he is a perfect picture of hybrid
[16:15] religion a cross between truth and
[16:17] darkness
[16:18] for the horse is a type of the true
[16:20] believer and the ass a picture of the
[16:22] unrighteous one
[16:23] mix them and you have a sterile formal
[16:25] religion
[16:26] it hasn't the seed of life it is dead
[16:30] it can talk about truth but it can't
[16:32] produce it
[16:33] it doesn't have god in its midst yet it
[16:35] gathers together and talks about god and
[16:38] all the while systematically denies the
[16:40] power
[16:41] they will deny the word in the very name
[16:43] of the lord
[16:44] and there is never any hope for them
[16:46] do you realize that no organized
[16:48] religion ever had a revival never
[16:51] once they organized they died they can't
[16:54] ever come back no sir
[16:57] i can show you that in type
[16:59] in exodus 13 13
[17:02] and every firstling of an ass thou shalt
[17:04] redeem with a lamb
[17:06] and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou
[17:08] shalt break his neck
[17:10] and all the firstborn of man among thy
[17:12] children shalt thou redeem
[17:14] see the ass can be redeemed
[17:17] every miserable sinner can be redeemed
[17:19] by the blood sacrifice of jesus christ
[17:21] or in rejecting christ be rejected
[17:23] himself
[17:24] but you don't redeem the mule there is
[17:27] no redemption for him there is no blood
[17:29] for him
[17:30] there can't be because the mule takes
[17:32] refuge in the church while the ass takes
[17:34] refuge in the blood
[17:36] the mule has no seed in him that can be
[17:39] quickened but the ass has seed
[17:42] why just a few weeks ago i read an
[17:44] editorial
[17:45] yes it was an editorial by an unsaved
[17:47] businessman not by a christian
[17:50] he said that he was amazed at the
[17:52] churches
[17:53] he could not understand them
[17:55] they had seminaries filled with
[17:56] professors who taught the word of god in
[17:58] order to destroy it
[18:00] now then this man could not figure that
[18:02] out he was appalled by it
[18:04] he said that he could understand the
[18:06] atheist or communist or free thinker or
[18:08] someone else doing that
[18:10] but when the church itself destroyed the
[18:12] word of god it was tantamount to
[18:14] premeditated murder
[18:16] there is your hybrid religion
[18:18] wake up america before it is too late
[18:22] when the church gets away from the word
[18:24] it will believe anything it is like eve
[18:27] when cain was born she said
[18:29] i've gotten a man from the lord
[18:31] now do you realize that she really meant
[18:33] that
[18:34] she thought that she had a man from the
[18:36] lord
[18:37] you see once she had been deceived by
[18:39] taking the word of satan instead of the
[18:41] word of god she then thought that
[18:43] whatever she said was right
[18:46] if she said that she had a man from god
[18:48] then she had a man from god
[18:50] but god has set laws in his universe
[18:53] a good seed can only bring forth good
[18:55] fruit and the evil seed can bring forth
[18:57] only evil fruit
[18:59] now each seed though different will
[19:01] utilize the same earth nourishment
[19:04] moisture and sunshine
[19:05] but it will bring forth after its own
[19:07] kind
[19:08] notice the history of the cane line
[19:11] notice the history of the south line
[19:13] only one difference between them
[19:15] the original seed nothing else
[19:19] if you look at this statement of eve
[19:20] real close you will notice that she had
[19:23] more of an understanding than most
[19:24] realize
[19:25] she did not attribute the son to satan
[19:28] for that would have made him equal with
[19:30] god
[19:31] only god could create the egg in the
[19:33] womb of mary satan couldn't do that
[19:36] eve knew that satan can only pervert
[19:39] so he beguiled her with the wrong seed
[19:42] it was the serpent seed that brought
[19:44] forth cain
[19:45] it was adam's seed that brought forth
[19:47] abel and seth
[19:49] those seeds went through exactly the
[19:51] same process
[19:52] but the children were different for they
[19:54] were from different seeds
[19:57] she believed that cain was from god she
[19:59] accepted the devil's lie as the truth of
[20:01] god
[20:02] that is exactly what we have now
[20:05] churches set themselves up as fountains
[20:07] of truth but the truth is not in them
[20:09] yet their begotten children swear by
[20:11] them and will even kill to uphold their
[20:13] error
[20:15] if you think that is an exaggeration
[20:17] read all of second timothy chapter three
[20:20] and the first five verses of the fourth
[20:21] chapter
[20:23] second timothy four one through five
[20:26] i charge thee therefore before god and
[20:28] the lord jesus christ who shall judge
[20:30] the quick and the dead at his appearing
[20:32] and his kingdom preach the word
[20:35] be instant in season out of season
[20:38] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[20:41] long-suffering and doctrine
[20:43] for the time will come when they will
[20:44] not endure sound doctrine but after
[20:47] their own lusts shall they heap to
[20:49] themselves teachers having itching ears
[20:51] and they shall turn away their ears from
[20:53] the truth and shall be turned unto
[20:55] fables
[20:57] but watch thou in all things and your
[20:59] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[21:02] make full proof of thy ministry
[21:05] when the church allowed herself to move
[21:07] away from the original like adam and eve
[21:09] death set in
[21:11] there is no strength in her she has
[21:14] become a monstrosity
[21:16] the minute the church moved toward form
[21:17] and ceremony and toward priesthood by
[21:20] organizing the ministers into a group
[21:22] that decided leadership apart from the
[21:24] holy spirit and his word
[21:26] that very moment death entered and she
[21:29] started to get sick
[21:30] and as she got sick she changed to a
[21:32] powerless group of people whose only
[21:34] weapon was argument
[21:36] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[21:38] for her hopes were built on program and
[21:40] not on faith in his word
[21:43] they sewed programs so they reaped
[21:45] program
[21:46] they sowed perversion so they reaped
[21:48] perverted children
[21:50] you tamper with god and you reap exactly
[21:52] what you injected
[21:54] man ought to learn that from nature he
[21:56] has tampered with nature
[21:58] he has injected his own ideas into
[22:00] nature and rearrange the molecules etc
[22:03] and now he is reaping a whirlwind
[22:06] just look how they have bred the chicken
[22:08] it is so highly bred that it is a laying
[22:10] machine that lays itself out it is no
[22:13] good for food and is soft and poor
[22:15] eating
[22:16] they inject substances into the meat we
[22:18] eat and because of that the human body
[22:20] is changing so that women are getting
[22:22] narrower in the hips and broader of
[22:24] shoulder and men are getting just the
[22:26] opposite
[22:27] now if you fool with nature and get a
[22:29] monstrosity and a backfire what will
[22:31] happen if you change the truth into a
[22:33] lie
[22:34] the answer is you will breed an
[22:36] antichrist godless system of religion
[22:38] that is so perverted it will not look
[22:40] like or produce what the original did
[22:43] the only answer that god has for a
[22:44] situation like that is the lake of fire
[22:47] that poor smernian age was dying
[22:50] when it died it never came back
[22:52] no age ever comes back no revival ever
[22:55] comes back
[22:57] it can't have the life of god in it by
[22:59] natural generation
[23:00] it takes a regeneration from above
[23:03] this last age started with the fires of
[23:05] a pentecostal revival and they organized
[23:08] it right back
[23:09] instead of taking the word they took
[23:11] their own ideas and did just what every
[23:13] age has done
[23:15] substituted the manual for the word
[23:18] just you step outside that manual and
[23:19] see what happens
[23:21] you are out brother
[23:23] and they will persecute you and blame it
[23:25] on god
[23:26] and how they love their organization no
[23:28] wonder
[23:29] they are second generation pentecostals
[23:32] and since god doesn't have grandchildren
[23:34] they are just children of their fathers
[23:36] known by their creeds and form of
[23:38] worship
[23:39] they can talk about what used to be but
[23:41] they can't produce it
[23:43] once they have the lightning but about
[23:45] all that is left is the thunder
[23:48] but let them talk to you about the
[23:49] glories of their movement they will say
[23:52] yes sir i want you to know that this is
[23:54] a move that no man started it came
[23:56] spontaneously the spirit fell all over
[23:59] the world
[24:00] yes sir we got what they had at
[24:02] pentecost this was not of men but of god
[24:07] then why didn't they keep it that way
[24:09] if god started it how come god couldn't
[24:12] keep it and finish it
[24:14] if god didn't write a handbook of creeds
[24:16] and formulas and dogmas to start it then
[24:18] what right did they have to do that
[24:21] god poured out his spirit upon baptists
[24:23] methodists nazarenes adventists
[24:26] presbyterians brethren church of god
[24:29] several so named etc
[24:32] all these brethren were brought up on
[24:34] different doctrines bylaws church
[24:36] manuals etc
[24:37] god swept it all to one side
[24:40] he destroyed their dispensational
[24:42] theories and restored the gifts of the
[24:44] spirit
[24:45] proving he is the same yesterday and
[24:47] today and forever
[24:48] but did those pentecostals learn their
[24:50] lesson about organization
[24:52] no sir
[24:53] they organized right back and have
[24:55] written their own textbooks bylaws and
[24:58] church manual fellowship book etc with
[25:01] one idea in mind
[25:03] which is to prove that they now have all
[25:05] the truth know all the answers and are
[25:08] therefore the elite of god who know the
[25:10] way and can show it unto others as god's
[25:12] appointed guides
[25:14] but they haven't got it
[25:16] they have hybridized themselves like the
[25:18] very groups they came out of
[25:20] if they want to be in the bride
[25:22] they are going to have to come out
[25:23] exactly as did their forefathers
[25:26] they are like all the rest the revival
[25:29] is over
[25:30] they are trying to live a name and are
[25:32] dead
[25:33] they took organization all the while
[25:34] talking about the spirit of god
[25:37] they talk about the evidence of the holy
[25:38] spirit but they forget that the devil
[25:41] can talk in tongues too
[25:43] the utter confusion of babel is in their
[25:45] midst and they call it the spirit of god
[25:48] once again we see man telling god
[25:50] instead of god telling man
[25:53] now you might desire to scold me right
[25:54] here for what i have said
[25:56] all right they call themselves
[25:58] pentecostal and full gospel let them
[26:00] prove it
[26:01] at pentecost the fire came in a cloud
[26:04] and separated over each of them like a
[26:06] tongue and fell on each one
[26:08] where is the fire
[26:10] they spoke in tongues at pentecost and
[26:12] the people who listened understood
[26:14] where is that
[26:16] the whole multitude of believers acted
[26:18] like one family
[26:19] pentecostals are as badly divided as any
[26:22] group in history
[26:23] no man durst join himself to the early
[26:25] church but only god added
[26:28] they have as many goats among them as
[26:30] any
[26:30] they claim to be full gospel but they
[26:32] can't prove it
[26:34] their churches are as empty of power as
[26:36] any of them
[26:37] if they are full gospel then we had
[26:39] better admit the bible made a mistake
[26:41] when it describes the full gospel men at
[26:43] pentecost
[26:45] they sing
[26:46] there's been a great change in me
[26:48] they are right
[26:49] but the change has not been for the
[26:51] better
[26:52] it is time to get back to god
[26:55] they have a name that they live but are
[26:57] dead
[26:58] tongues isn't the evidence of revival
[27:01] it is the evidence of death
[27:03] tongues proclaimed the evidence that the
[27:05] ceremonial religion of the jews was over
[27:07] that a new era had begun
[27:09] tongues today is ringing down the
[27:11] curtain on the gentile church ages and
[27:14] the gospel is going back to the jews
[27:16] people are talking about tongues
[27:18] heralding in a great spiritual move
[27:20] they have missed the boat
[27:22] the truth is that it is writing the
[27:24] finish to all of man's ideas programs
[27:27] and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is
[27:29] being ushered in
[27:31] wake up people of god
[27:33] wake up
[27:35] if you don't think this is true just
[27:37] listen to this
[27:38] all over the world in both pentecostal
[27:40] and fundamental groups they are
[27:42] organizing the businessmen
[27:44] they have invaded the pulpit without a
[27:45] call from god
[27:47] they have styled themselves the fishers
[27:49] of men and the founders of a move of god
[27:52] and they say the gifted ministry of
[27:54] ephesians 4 10-13
[27:56] that god gave the church has failed so
[27:59] they are taking over
[28:01] here we are right in the midst of the
[28:03] fulfillment of prophecy called the gain
[28:05] sayings of korra
[28:07] and they don't even know that they have
[28:08] fulfilled it
[28:10] they are blindly going on preaching
[28:11] experience for truth
[28:13] may god have pity on them may their eyes
[28:16] be opened before it is too late
[28:18] oh listen to me
[28:20] when did the prestige of money social
[28:22] leadership business ability or sheer
[28:25] mental prowess ever qualify a man for
[28:27] spiritual leadership or give any weight
[28:30] to the word of god
[28:32] and when in any way materiality or human
[28:34] values begin to show as the media by
[28:36] which god works instead of the holy
[28:38] spirit alone
[28:40] then we are fighting against god not for
[28:42] him now i want this on record right here
[28:46] i am not speaking against elders in the
[28:48] church no sir
[28:50] and that elder can be as poor as any man
[28:53] was ever poor or be the richest man in
[28:55] the world as long as he has an elder in
[28:58] heart and deed
[28:59] i would not hesitate to ordain any man
[29:02] that has the real spiritual
[29:03] qualifications as an elder or deacon
[29:06] regardless of his finances or social
[29:08] position
[29:10] but when you see a social or financial
[29:12] structure come into the church that
[29:13] divides the folks in any way
[29:16] that is not of god
[29:18] it is another sign of the time in this
[29:20] physically rich but spiritually
[29:22] impoverished laodicean age in which we
[29:24] are now living
[29:25] i know thy poverty
[29:28] did you notice that their poverty is
[29:30] linked up with the synagogue of satan in
[29:32] that same verse
[29:33] yes it is the rich powerful organization
[29:35] that has the wealth and always pushes
[29:37] out the little people that serve god
[29:40] when the spirit of god moves in the
[29:42] hearts of men who is it that leaves the
[29:44] buildings and property
[29:46] the little flock always loses out to the
[29:48] big organization
[29:49] and where do the people then go
[29:51] they worship in homes old store
[29:53] buildings and basements just as they did
[29:56] when they went to the catacombs
[29:58] these people were poor in this world's
[30:00] goods certainly
[30:02] but they were rich in spirit
[30:04] i know they're blasphemy
[30:07] now it isn't the thought here that these
[30:09] liars are blaspheming god
[30:11] though that goes without saying
[30:13] but they are blaspheming the true church
[30:15] it is always thus
[30:17] the jews of jerusalem blasphemed the
[30:19] church at the beginning
[30:20] the gentile polytheists did likewise
[30:24] if anyone is going to be evil spoken of
[30:26] it will always be the true seed
[30:28] in nero's day the christians were blamed
[30:31] for every calamity even for the burning
[30:33] of rome
[30:34] in communist countries the little flock
[30:36] is always the first to be exterminated
[30:38] though actually insignificant in size
[30:41] though the christians are fine loyal
[30:43] people who do only good they will always
[30:46] be persecuted to the end that they might
[30:48] be physically destroyed
[30:51] the reason this is so
[30:52] is because they are a rebuke to the
[30:54] godless
[30:56] like a sore thumb they stand out before
[30:57] the wicked
[30:59] and though the righteous intend no harm
[31:01] to the wicked but want to do only good
[31:03] invariably they find they are embroiled
[31:05] as was john the baptist with herod
[31:08] for john did not want to harm either
[31:10] herod or his wife but to save them from
[31:12] the wrath of god
[31:14] this was not only thoroughly
[31:15] misunderstood and absolutely withstood
[31:18] but john was put to death because of it
[31:21] and for all the good the people of god
[31:23] do
[31:24] they are still put to public shame and
[31:26] to death
[31:27] surely there must be some sinister force
[31:29] behind a people who would be so void of
[31:31] conscience
[31:32] that they would return evil to those who
[31:34] did them good
[31:35] yes there is such a force it is satan
[31:39] the answer lies in the next verse
[31:42] [Music]
[32:04] you
