========================================

[Music] it's certainly a privilege to be here tonight i am so happy that god permitted us to do it i am a little shy of cameras i like go ahead take them that's hard i just watch them i'm conscious of them and that's all it's all right now it's rather warm we've had two tremendous messages from the lord and now i thought tonight seeing that many of my friends are here that has to drive a long ways some of them from way down in kentucky see brother welch evans and his family here from tifton georgia i met people out here from california there's some here from germany and different places coming into this one little spot to serve the law and i see sister nelly cox i believe that her mother-in-law and amber here which will perhaps go back many miles tonight in kentucky georgia down into tennessee up in ohio my friends here one friend heard brother ted dudley always from phoenix arizona there's many of them here others if i could just call their names come here to visit with us today 90 of them i haven't got to even touch their hands i see my friends from chicago just all around how many people's in here from out of town raise your hands 90 of the audience now it's made up of different friends from different churches around over the country and i preached a long time this morning prayed for the sick till 1 30. so i got just a little bit hoarse and i have to preach a little while to kind of get in what we call second gear before there's brother lee vale of no more shucky's hands one of my associates baptist church oh hi is that you ben i hadn't heard you say amen yet or i don't know jim oh no brother ben and i know he's out of town so don't don't just where are you from now brother ben in indiana board in indiana we're so glad to have everyone here and now i'm not going to keep you very long because of the tremendous miles you have to drive i wish i could take each one of you home with me tonight i really mean that got to leave it about three three three and four o'clock in the morning and i i wish i could take you along i see my friend here from arkansas his wife aren't you the man that the lord spoke to and told these things in here the other night i thought you were just as a look around you see new and old friends so god knows the intents of my heart that i like to get to see and take you home with me and have a good chat but one day we'll do that where we won't have to say we got to hurry up got to pick up the children somebody's sick that'll all be over them that great day i hope we meet many more times now it's my intention while i'm waiting on the lord now to find my direction now tuesday i'm going to need prayer worse than i ever needed in all my life i'm going to ask you if you'll pray for me i'll need your prayers be sure to pray for me the way the wind turns tuesday may mean a great thing to me and to the church and to the cause of christ so be sure to pray for me now then until i find just which direction to go and what to do i'm waiting on the lord during that time i'll be around the tabernacle you're in and out preaching praying for the sick doing anything that i can do we want to someday if the government doesn't stop us we want to build a church here amen a nice church or we can have seating capacity a main floor balcony and so forth so it'll be a real nice church air conditioned so that people can set in comfort listen to the services if they let us do it we hope so now pray for us and now tonight we're going to approach the subject that i promised this morning the lord willing to talk on tonight and it's going to be more or less teaching because of the voice i want to speak tonight on five definite identifications of the true church of the living god five definite vindications of the true church or identifications rather of the true church now before we approach this great and mighty subject i'm going to ask for a word of prayer i'm going to ask our pastor brother neville if he'll come up and offer prayer over the word of god while we turn all of us to saint matthew the 16th chapter the 18th verse to begin with saint matthew 16 and 18 while brother neville is making his way for the prayer of consolation our heavenly father we're thankful tonight for this another privilege and opportunity that's granted to us through thy great everlasting mercy we're thankful tonight for the tug and the call and the leadership of the holy spirit we appreciate our god that you're that god that came down to be in us and he is with us to the end of this world father the great problems and the trials of tomorrow will seem nothing as long as we're able to hold thy hand and walk through with me truly we pray lord that thou give us a deep seated compassion one for the other knowing that whilst one is in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing that we too one of these days shall go through like circumstances god give us the spirit of jesus in us till we feel for each other enough until there will be unity between us until we can serve thee together yes father we thank thee tonight for this another a privilege that's granted to us to be able to sit under the teaching of thy servant whom thou didst ordained whom thou didst elect to this position whom thou did see fit to allow us to have the privilege of being in the under the very benefits of this ministry bless him and us both with the with this ministry that he has upon him yes father we pray that as these days that are approaching in the coming week when we would call upon thee now in this intercessory manner saying within our hearts that god since you told us that whatever things we say it shall be even as we speak it if we will but believe and trust and obey thee therefore lord these ensuing days which are to be the testing upon my brother and our brother and thy servant o god we command him to be richly in the name of the lord jesus and pray that thou shalt enshroud him will the heavenly protection and resurrection that he has never known before you lord my god we pray that thou stifle every intellectual power that shall lie granted [Music] may his mouth be opened with words of wisdom when there is any opportunity to speak yes oh lord we thank thee our god the thirst made a provision for all of thy servants through the ages yes and the holy ghost has been adequate to furnish the the uh oration that would stand in the presence of learned and intelligent men yes lord we ask your father to let us walk humbly and softly and before the o lord jesus only let us do thy will and feel thy presence be with us now and o god we pray that thou perfect praise on the inside of us until it will come forth not a force but praise will come forth from us with anointing o my lord tonight finish this wonderful day in which thou has come and has healed the sick and has redeemed the lost and has been with us to sanctify the hearts of the impure yes now lord tonight take over in this service and bless our brother's throat and bless the word as it flows forth may we have receptive hearts and minds and oh god now accept our praise for it in jesus name amen amen amen can you hear me all right back in the back can you hear me [Music] i wish to read now out of book of matthew 16th chapter and the 18th verse i'll begin with the 17th verse and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven i say unto thee that thy art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it may god add his blessings to his word the word church on each one of these subjects that i have chosen tonight to try to speak to you on one of it is what is the church who set it up what is its message how do we become a member of it and can we get to heaven without being a member of it uh each one of those texts could last for hours call me i wish to read now out of book of matthew 16th chapter and the 18th verse i'll begin with the 17th verse and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven i say unto thee that thy art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it may god add his blessings to his word the word church on each one of these subjects that i have chosen tonight to try to speak to you on one of it is what is the church who set it up what is its message how do we become a member of it and can we get to heaven without being a member of it now each one of those texts could last for hours combing back and forth but i wish to just hit a few fundamental points to show what the real church is and i i want you to have your bibles now the first place the word church itself means the called out now israel was not the church of god as long as they were in egypt they were the people of god and then when god called them out of egypt they become the church of god because they were the called out now that still remains the same today the word church means the called out one those that have been called out separated made different now in the old testament the known church was called the kingdom of god god's kingdom now i'm taking this from chronology of the bible the old testament the church was called the kingdom of god in other words god is a king and the church is his domain god's kingdom old testament in the new testament it's called the messianic empire oh i like that messianic and otherwise the messiah's empire where the messiah rules and reigns no denominational barriers or nothing the messiah rules in his empire isn't that wonderful thinking amen messianic empire therefore the church is not an organization the church is not a gathering of people the church is the people of god that's been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom this would stand quoting a few months ago wife and i were going to the shopping center and we found a strange thing there was a woman on the street that had a skirt on but we actually found one and the wife said to me well look at that i said she must be a christian she's so much different it's a shame then the question arose why is it bill that we as christians and this faith that we believe in why is it that we constrain our women to wear dresses that act that way does not people of other churches they wear those clothes like that the immoral clothes and why is it you couldn't say they were immoral i said that is true i can judge no one but to see them by their fruits they are known they may not actually commit the crime but on them is the spirit that's driving them to immorality now jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart amen now when that sinner has to answer for committing adultery who will be the guilty one the woman that presented herself you may be as pure as a lily as far as virtue is concerned but if you have presented yourself before the people in an immoral way though you're innocent of the act you've caused a man to thank evil of you when it's your fault jesus said you'll be guilty of committing adultery and an adult and this will never enter heaven but as i travel around the world i find every nation has its own spirit and all nations are controlled by the devil all governments are ruled by the damn amen the bible said so they fight the war and they will till jesus comes and then he'll set up a kingdom that there'll be no war but satan said all the kingdoms of the world was his and he'd do with him whatever he wanted to right in the face of jesus christ and there are all satan's instruments satan's kingdoms satan told jesus i'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship me jesus noted fall heir to him in the millennium so he said get thee hence satan he knew that god would give him all of the kingdoms and there will be heroes and there'll all be one kingdom when you go into germany you find a german spirit you go into england you find an english spirit you go into sweden you find a swedish spirit you go into france you find a french spirit you come into america you find american spirit i stopped at san angelo at rome some time ago and wanted to see the catacombs and to my surprise and to a rebuke as an american standing before the catacomb gate where you entered in said to the american women please put on clothes and honor the dead before entering here when a nation sinks that loan it's terrible when we get to that place so you see because i asked the woman one time are you a christian she said i'm an american of course i am that has nothing to do with it brother bosworth asked one one night said are you a christian sister said i'll give you to understand i burn a candle every night like that had anything to do with christianity burning the camel christianity doesn't consist of such things as that and the church of god doesn't consist of such makeup as that now what makes the women we never compel them women to do that we never compel our man not to drink not to swear we just preach the gospel and lay down the pattern of the bible many man that comes to the pentecostal face and the hole in his face come in and profess to be when they're not in their heart many women does the same thing we don't tell them they have to do it we just give them the pattern tell them what the bible says and if they're born of a heavenly spirit then their spirit is no more americanized it's no more germanized it's heavenly eyes we're the kingdom of god because we are in another kingdom amen am i a kingdom of god or decency holiness and power exists we have access to our king we have an interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but that one man christ jesus so we are living in a kingdom and it is called in the chronology of the bible the messianic messianic kingdom in other words where the messiah rules in every life in his dominion ruling the lives of his people are called out people from every walk of life gathering them together in a group and calls it his church or is called out ones isn't that a beautiful thing now israel was the people of god until we find in acts 7 38 if you're putting it down that then they were called the church of god because they were called by god out of egypt out of the world out away from other churches out away from other religions to walk with god alone and now the church of god today is the same thing called out of every thing of the world called out of every religious cult called out of every religious denomination called out of every religious organization to walk with god not being governed by a bishop but being governed by christ in this messianic kingdom that we live in christ is the king christ is the one now christ is the head of this christ is ahead of this messianic kingdom and you can not organize a kingdom of which christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head amen because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of a man and make an organization to which christ will govern therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god is going contrary to the king and if they're going contrary to the king it would be against the king so if it's against the king it would be an antichrist that's pretty rough if i had just a little more voice we make that clear it is a antichrist and if you bear with me a few minutes i'll prove that amen an antichrist spirit tries to take a a people and call them from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of god amen people has always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there that i'm striking at it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people god's people is his called out people i believe they're never denomination they could be catholic they could be protestant they could be jewish they could be any kind of a church but the real church is the mystical body of jesus christ now you cannot organize the mystical body of christ now every person that comes to christ comes out of the world comes into christ comes into his mystical body and you are a member of that body when you are brought into this church called out and are baptized into this mystical body you get it not method it's not bad it's not pentecostal not nazarene not pilgrimal and it's not catholic but the body of jesus christ we'll pick that up a little deeper and other questions in a few minutes as we go on into the deeper parts of it but the body of christ is the church now he likes it in many paradigms like in a husband and wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer and the bridegroom is no longer two people they are one she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones i family a man or woman is called to the mystical body of christ by the holy spirit they become a full member of this body when they're filled with the holy ghost because god took the spirit out of christ raised up his body and placed it on his throne and sent back the holy spirit to make up the mystical body of christ which will be united at the married supper at the coming of the lord you cannot organize it it is a mystery jesus said the nicodemus the wind blown worthless thou cannot tell which way come or where it's going so is everyone that's born of the spirit amen you can't understand it it comes from somewhere it isn't methodist it isn't baptist it isn't pentecostal it isn't any organization it is a birth born into the kingdom of god now trying to organize it then brings it to antichrist because anything that's against the teaching of christ is antichrist now where did this organization started jesus when he was on earth never organized any church he spoke of a coming church but he never organized any church there never was a church organized for hundreds of years after the death of the last apostle and the first organized church that ever was on earth was a roman catholic church now i have the pre niacine fathers fox book of martyrs the writings of josephus timmerman's early ages and many other great ancient writers and nowhere nowhere is it ever written on any page of history where there ever was an organized church until the roman catholic church is organized and it become an organization which was contrary to god now if such a thing was coming oh wish i could get this over to you if such a thing was coming it would be such a great antichrist should not god foreknow it if he's the infinite god if he's infinite would he not know that these things was coming and if it's such a horrible thing would not he warn his church beforehand yes now i hope you have a better understanding of why that i'll strike not at the people in the organizations but the organizations and their disposition it can be nothing else but antichrist in every one of them now you say wait a minute i thought you didn't preach them about the bible let's let the bible say it then let us turn now and read a while [Music] you
