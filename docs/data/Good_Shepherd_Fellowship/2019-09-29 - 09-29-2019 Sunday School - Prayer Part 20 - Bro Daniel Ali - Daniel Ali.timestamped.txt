[0:00] um
[0:05] we we are not going to go through
[0:07] everything we did
[0:10] um
[0:11] so a lot of the things will be new
[0:14] sorry a lot of the things will be old
[0:18] and um
[0:19] but
[0:20] i see new things coming in here and
[0:22] there
[0:24] so let's keep trusting the lord
[0:27] and see what goes on here so today
[0:33] um i want us to look at
[0:36] a few things
[0:39] so reading from matthew 4
[0:43] four
[0:58] but he answered and said it is written
[1:01] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:05] every word that proceedeth
[1:07] out of the mouth of god praise be to god
[1:12] now
[1:13] naturally
[1:18] the food you eat
[1:21] determines
[1:23] how much water you drink
[1:30] the food you eat will determine how much
[1:32] water you drink
[1:36] there are some foods when you drink you
[1:38] eat
[1:39] probably for the whole day you will not
[1:41] even you don't feel tasty
[1:42] let alone drinking
[1:47] so there must be something in your belly
[1:52] to trigger that taste
[1:54] so you can drink
[1:58] praise be to the lord
[2:01] so what you feed on
[2:04] what you feed on talking about spiritual
[2:07] things now will determine how much
[2:10] prayer
[2:11] you give yourself to
[2:16] the things you feed on
[2:19] spiritually
[2:20] will determine how much prayer you give
[2:23] yourself to
[2:28] there are things you will eat and for
[2:30] the whole day
[2:32] you don't feel thirsty
[2:34] there is a life you will give yourself
[2:36] to
[2:37] and prayer wouldn't mean anything to you
[2:45] and you can say oh okay i don't even eat
[2:48] if you don't eat you can only drink for
[2:50] so long
[2:51] it will get to the point
[2:53] you will see the water but you never
[2:55] feel like drinking it
[2:56] why because there is nothing in your
[2:59] system calling for the water
[3:04] but if you have god inside
[3:06] there
[3:08] if you give yourself to the word
[3:12] the word
[3:13] as we have said time and again
[3:16] the word and prayer goes hand in hand
[3:20] the word of god in you would call for
[3:22] that prayer
[3:25] but if you choose to live a sinful life
[3:29] guess
[3:30] what
[3:32] prayer wouldn't even mean anything to
[3:34] you
[3:37] man shall not live by bread alone
[3:41] but by every word
[3:43] that proceedeth
[3:44] out of the mouth of god
[3:51] the living word
[3:54] living in you craves for prayer
[3:59] there is every reason why we should live
[4:02] in the word of god
[4:05] living by the world lives you above your
[4:08] edge
[4:11] praise be to god
[4:13] just envision yourself
[4:16] climbing the stairs
[4:19] that's what happens with every step you
[4:22] take in the world
[4:25] the more you live in the world
[4:27] the father above you rise
[4:34] above your flesh
[4:38] and where else should we be
[4:41] because the bible says that we should
[4:43] pray in the spirit always
[4:46] always praying in the spirit
[4:49] so if the word of god living in the word
[4:52] would lift you
[4:54] above your earth
[4:57] get you out of the flesh
[5:01] and get you into the spiritual realm
[5:05] into the inner courts of god
[5:08] where you can commune with god
[5:12] then it tells you
[5:14] that there is every good reason why
[5:17] we should live in the world
[5:25] anytime you have been confronted maybe
[5:28] struggling in the flesh or the disease
[5:30] of the flesh
[5:32] it's an indication
[5:34] that you have no reason
[5:35] above yourself
[5:39] if you find yourself
[5:41] struggling with yourself
[5:43] struggling with the things of this life
[5:46] is an indication that you have no reason
[5:48] above that flesh
[5:50] above your earth
[5:53] praise be to god
[5:56] as you live in the word
[6:01] obstacles things that are meant to be
[6:04] obstacles
[6:05] things that the devil would throw at you
[6:10] would end up becoming a springboard
[6:16] when the temptations come
[6:19] the temptations are meant to do evil to
[6:22] you
[6:23] to ruin your testimony
[6:26] but you know what
[6:27] the temptations come and they end up
[6:29] becoming one a springboard for you
[6:32] because you are living above it
[6:36] praise be to god
[6:43] now we've been talking about prayer
[6:45] talking about prayer remember we are
[6:48] doing a revision of a thought
[6:51] so we've been talking about prayer
[6:52] prayer prayer
[6:54] but
[6:55] there is something i want us to look at
[6:57] today
[7:00] apart from prayer
[7:04] where you go to god in communion
[7:08] with a request or a supplication
[7:11] there comes a moment in your life where
[7:13] you have to speak
[7:20] so we are not talking about prayer again
[7:22] here
[7:25] apart from prayer
[7:30] where you go to god to talk to god in
[7:33] prayer
[7:35] lay your request before god
[7:38] pour out your heart before god
[7:40] make your supplications before god or to
[7:43] just lift his holy name up to just
[7:45] praise him
[7:47] apart from that
[7:49] there comes a time
[7:51] when you just have to speak
[8:03] the bible says
[8:05] in job 22 8
[8:08] you can just note that down
[8:10] that we shall decree a thing
[8:14] and it shall come to pass
[8:18] and i try to find out what the white
[8:20] decree
[8:22] means even though i've heard it a
[8:23] thousand and one times
[8:26] so a decree
[8:29] is an order
[8:32] from an authoritative source
[8:38] a person of authority speaking
[8:42] either a politician
[8:45] either a king
[8:49] what have you a person in authority
[8:52] when they speak
[8:55] they give an order it is a decree
[9:00] and you all have to obey it
[9:04] and the bible says that we shall decree
[9:06] 18 and it shall be established
[9:13] now
[9:15] when you go to the book of revelations
[9:18] it says that we have been made
[9:20] kings
[9:21] and priests unto god
[9:28] it doesn't matter how feeble you are or
[9:30] how feeble you think
[9:33] it doesn't matter how weak you think you
[9:35] are
[9:38] in the spiritual realm
[9:41] we are authorities
[9:45] in the spiritual realm
[9:47] you are an authority
[9:52] if we shall decree a thing it shall come
[9:54] to pass
[9:56] then
[9:57] no ordinary people just decree something
[10:00] if you say something outside nobody even
[10:01] knows you
[10:04] but let the governor decree something
[10:06] and everybody knows that no it's coming
[10:08] from a person in authority
[10:11] that is how we are children of god that
[10:14] is how we are in the spiritual realm
[10:18] even though nobody hears us when we
[10:20] speak out there
[10:21] and nobody would ever even hear us
[10:24] or may never even know us
[10:27] but in the spirit when we give others
[10:30] our others are being obeyed
[10:33] for we are made kings and priests unto
[10:36] god
[10:37] we are kings
[10:39] we are priests
[10:41] and you cannot be a king without a
[10:43] dominion
[10:44] we have a dominion
[10:46] just as an early king would give an
[10:49] order and his order would be obeyed
[10:53] that is how when we also give an order
[10:55] in the spirit
[10:57] that is how our others have been obeyed
[11:00] you know i didn't think of it just as i
[11:02] was driving uh with the family to check
[11:05] this morning and then it just struck me
[11:07] and i said oh if i thought about it
[11:09] earlier
[11:10] i could have done a better job at it but
[11:12] it just hit me and i said you know what
[11:15] i'll just go i'm just going to fit it in
[11:17] anyhow
[11:18] this brings us
[11:20] to where brother one has been talking
[11:21] about
[11:24] the authority of the
[11:26] church the binding power
[11:30] that whatsoever you bind on earth shall
[11:32] be bound in heaven
[11:34] and whatsoever you loose on earth shall
[11:36] be loosed in heaven
[11:38] the binding power
[11:40] we are authorities
[11:42] when we speak
[11:44] just know that you have made a decree
[11:49] praise be to god
[11:54] moses
[11:56] when he led the children of israel out
[11:58] of egypt
[12:00] and they got before the red sea
[12:04] and the enemy was coming after them
[12:06] when he turned and looked at
[12:08] them he made a decree
[12:11] and remember a decree can also be a
[12:14] judgment
[12:15] he looked at them and he said
[12:18] these egyptians you have seen you would
[12:20] never see them again the judgment was
[12:23] passed
[12:26] and it was established
[12:31] it was established
[12:33] there comes to that time
[12:35] where you don't have enough time to pray
[12:40] in the midst of the storm
[12:45] just imagine
[12:47] the devil holding a two i mean somebody
[12:49] holding you with a knife in your truth
[12:53] you think you can tell him just hold on
[12:56] let me go and pray and come back so you
[12:58] can take off my head no
[13:00] that is the time to speak
[13:03] that is the time to speak
[13:08] and when god was waiting on moses to
[13:10] speak
[13:11] moses was also waiting on god
[13:14] and god asked him moses what is in your
[13:16] hand what do you have say the road
[13:18] talk to the sea
[13:21] moses stretched it
[13:23] on the red sea and away
[13:26] a highway was made in the red sea that
[13:29] the children of israel crossed
[13:32] and pharaoh and his troops in an attempt
[13:34] to cross all of them god drowned
[13:38] not a single one of them escaped
[13:43] those egyptians the israelites saw they
[13:46] never saw them again
[13:49] moses made a decree
[13:50] and it came to pass
[13:53] praise be to god
[13:54] so remember
[13:56] there is that time there is time for
[13:58] prayer and we should give ourselves to
[14:00] prayer every single day of our lives
[14:04] there is no reason why a christian
[14:07] should go through the day from morning
[14:09] till evening and not pray
[14:13] it should never happen
[14:17] if it has happened before
[14:19] that is okay let it go
[14:21] but from today onwards
[14:24] just tell yourself that enough is enough
[14:27] give yourself to prayer
[14:30] but as we have said time and again
[14:33] it comes to that time
[14:35] where you realize that no
[14:37] there is no room
[14:39] there is just not enough time to go and
[14:42] pray and you have to speak
[14:45] and the bible does not play with words
[14:49] a man can play with words
[14:51] i can play with words
[14:53] god does not play with words he says
[14:56] exactly what it what he means and he
[14:58] means exactly what he says
[15:01] we shall decree a thing and it shall be
[15:03] established
[15:04] praise be to god
[15:06] that is a promise
[15:09] praise be to god
[15:12] joshua
[15:15] joshua was one of the 2 million who left
[15:17] egypt
[15:20] and he saw it
[15:24] when moses passed judgment on the
[15:26] egyptians
[15:28] and then he was he just today didn't
[15:30] know what what next to do
[15:32] until god spoke to him and asked him to
[15:35] stretch his throat on the rose on the
[15:36] red sea
[15:39] joshua saw it
[15:42] and when
[15:45] god took joshua
[15:48] after the death of moses
[15:50] and he said as i walked with moses so
[15:54] shall i be with you
[15:58] joshua knew where he stood
[16:00] praise be to god
[16:03] that when the opportunity came his way
[16:06] and they were fighting the enemy
[16:08] and joshua needed time
[16:10] to finish the work
[16:12] he looked at the sun
[16:14] he didn't hesitate
[16:16] he spoke to the sun
[16:18] just stay where you are praise be to god
[16:21] hey turn and look at the moon don't move
[16:23] stay where you are until i finish with
[16:25] my work
[16:27] and they obeyed
[16:30] it comes to that time
[16:32] where you just have to speak
[16:36] for it is not time
[16:38] to pray
[16:41] because there is just no time
[16:45] just speak
[16:48] speak
[16:50] you know
[16:51] god does not move by fear
[16:54] we have allowed fear to torment us so
[16:57] much to hold us to the ground
[17:00] so much
[17:03] no shake yourselves off
[17:06] sometimes you tell yourself oh what if i
[17:08] speak and it doesn't happen
[17:11] that is what fear can do
[17:13] what if you speak and it happens
[17:17] it's better to try and feel than to fail
[17:20] to try
[17:26] take god at his word
[17:29] it is not for us
[17:33] to bring the word of god to pass no
[17:36] is god's duty to bring his way to pass
[17:40] and he made that promise
[17:42] you shall decree a thing and shall be
[17:44] established
[17:46] take him by his word
[17:49] and speak believing
[17:52] praise be to god
[17:53] we are narrowing it down
[17:56] mikaya
[17:58] when the king of israel wanted to go to
[18:00] war against rama gilead
[18:02] and he gathered his prophets together
[18:05] about 400 of them
[18:07] and he asked them to prophesy they told
[18:09] him oh go god has given you victory go
[18:13] god has given you victory they were just
[18:15] prophesying oh you walk over the enemy
[18:17] you do this you do this
[18:20] yahushua was not satisfied
[18:22] he asked ahab
[18:24] are this all the prophets
[18:26] is there no any other one he said there
[18:29] is one he doesn't speak good of me he
[18:30] said don't worry about that let's bring
[18:32] him in
[18:34] and they brought
[18:36] they brought micaiah
[18:39] oh praise be to god
[18:41] he said as long as the lord lives
[18:43] whatever he lays on my heart that is
[18:45] what i'm going to tell you
[18:48] hey
[18:49] i told you right
[18:50] you see already you see what he has
[18:52] started already
[18:53] praise be to
[18:54] god
[18:56] as long as the lord lives whatever he
[18:58] tells me to do that's what i'm going to
[19:00] do
[19:02] now
[19:03] when he prophesied contrary to what the
[19:07] 400 prophets had prophesied
[19:11] the king of israel was not happy with
[19:12] him
[19:13] and he said you know what
[19:15] take this guy here put him in prison
[19:18] feed him with the bread of affliction
[19:21] till i come back
[19:23] and i'll decide what to do with him
[19:25] and i love what mikhail said
[19:28] praise be to god
[19:29] it comes to that time when you just have
[19:32] to speak
[19:33] he said look if you go and you come back
[19:35] in peace the lord has not spoken by me
[19:39] praise be to god
[19:41] if you go and you come back in peace the
[19:43] lord has not spoken by me
[19:47] and indeed he went he never came back
[19:51] speak
[19:53] just speak
[19:58] it was not time for makaya to start
[20:01] wailing and crying knowing how wicked
[20:03] the king was and then stop fasting and
[20:05] praying he just spoke
[20:09] you would go but you not come back in
[20:10] peace
[20:12] and it was established
[20:15] it was established nothing could change
[20:17] it
[20:22] we can talk about elijah
[20:25] i'm not going to go into the details
[20:26] because we all know the story
[20:28] when he got fed up with the prophets of
[20:30] baal
[20:33] he shut the heavens
[20:35] by his word
[20:39] but he just shut the heavens
[20:42] that that is not going to be rain and
[20:44] they will not be due until i called for
[20:46] it he didn't pray
[20:49] he just spoke
[20:52] and it was established
[20:54] nothing could change it
[20:57] so much so that
[20:59] until god wanted to even when god wanted
[21:02] to send our reign
[21:04] did you realize that god didn't overlook
[21:06] the words of his prophet
[21:09] he didn't just send the reign no
[21:13] he so came to his prophet he said you go
[21:17] go tell the king there's going to be
[21:19] rain
[21:22] he didn't trample over the west of his
[21:24] prophet
[21:26] he didn't undermine his prophet
[21:31] he spoke
[21:35] there would not be rain
[21:37] they will not be due until i called for
[21:39] it he just spoke
[21:42] and it was established
[21:48] you may say oh we are talking about
[21:50] bible characters we are talking about
[21:51] bible characters god has been doing it
[21:55] the fact that you don't see it or you
[21:57] don't hear it doesn't mean it's not
[21:58] happening
[21:59] i have shared this story here before
[22:02] about a little girl in accra um right
[22:05] andrew should know that place in temer
[22:10] who was in the house by herself
[22:13] the parents had gone to work
[22:16] and a man just
[22:18] opened the door she thought it was
[22:20] probably her father or a mother coming
[22:22] in and before she realized it was
[22:25] and a complete stranger
[22:28] and then he locked the door behind
[22:31] ready to take advantage of the little
[22:33] girl
[22:34] and right there and then tell me in a
[22:36] situation like this how are you going to
[22:38] pray oh just wait and let me pray and
[22:41] then whatever you want to do to me no
[22:43] she looked at the man in the eyes i
[22:45] strike you with blindness in jesus name
[22:48] and right there and then the man went
[22:49] blind
[22:52] right there and then the man went blind
[22:54] and then he's 10 he was looking for his
[22:57] way out
[23:01] and those guys that were telling me the
[23:02] story they were doing their national
[23:03] service when they came to the northern
[23:05] part of ghana
[23:06] and they said the girl later was saying
[23:07] that she was sorry i said sorry for what
[23:11] this is a situation you can never be
[23:13] sorry for
[23:17] she struck him with blindness
[23:22] we are children of god
[23:25] we are made kings and priests unto god
[23:28] and you can never be a king without a
[23:30] dominion
[23:31] and just as when a king speaks
[23:34] his voice is head
[23:36] across
[23:38] his area of jurisdiction that is the
[23:40] same way when you speak as a child of
[23:43] god
[23:44] your orders are ahead whatever decree
[23:47] that it is that you make
[23:49] it is head
[23:51] in the kingdom
[23:52] that you control remember you are
[23:54] controlling the kingdom
[23:58] praise be to god
[24:00] this is a story again i shared i'm just
[24:02] going to chip it in before our time is
[24:04] over
[24:05] about a doctor
[24:07] he wasn't even a believer
[24:10] a doctor
[24:12] who did a heart operation
[24:15] and one
[24:16] um
[24:17] i don't know anything about medicine but
[24:19] according to the story
[24:21] um i heard this on the radio
[24:23] um
[24:24] that when when the heart is being
[24:26] operated upon
[24:30] all the doctor would do is tap the heart
[24:33] and the heart will begin to pump
[24:36] so
[24:37] the doctor had a friend who was a pastor
[24:39] who was interested
[24:41] so he invited this pastor over and they
[24:44] all entered into the operation room
[24:47] and then the doctor did his oppression
[24:48] operated on the heart and when he got
[24:51] through it he tapped the heart
[24:54] thinking the heart was going to pump the
[24:56] heart was not pumping
[24:57] he tapped it again it was not pumping
[25:00] he looked into the ice of the pasta the
[25:02] pasta looked his eyes
[25:04] he said well this has never happened
[25:05] before
[25:07] this is happening for the first time
[25:10] and then
[25:12] according to the story
[25:14] this
[25:15] man who had come to the end of his book
[25:17] knowledge
[25:19] he had come to the end of his book
[25:21] knowledge
[25:22] he did everything he had to do there was
[25:24] no response remember this is not a
[25:26] christian we are talking about but he
[25:28] never gave up
[25:30] he never gave up
[25:32] he went very close
[25:34] to the dead man's ears
[25:36] the man was literally dead
[25:39] he went to his ears and he spoke into
[25:42] his ears he said tell your heart to beat
[25:44] again
[25:45] praise be to god
[25:47] and right there and then his heart
[25:49] started pumping
[25:50] started pumping and the man came back to
[25:53] life
[25:58] what are you talking about
[26:01] that apart from prayer that comes to
[26:04] that time
[26:06] in your work with god when you are faced
[26:08] with situations
[26:11] you just have to speak
[26:16] stay your grounds
[26:17] stay your grounds
[26:20] it is not time to back off
[26:22] stay your grounds just speak and go
[26:25] forward
[26:29] and remember
[26:33] that we shall decree a thing
[26:35] proverbs 22 28
[26:38] we shall decree a thing and it shall
[26:41] come to pass
[26:44] when you speak
[26:45] believe
[26:47] praise be to god
[26:51] okay so our time is over
[26:53] we are going to go to the lord in prayer
[26:56] but let me just use a minute of your
[26:57] time
[26:58] you know um
[27:00] over the past few weeks
[27:02] um
[27:03] you know every church service has
[27:11] sections
[27:13] the meditational part of the service is
[27:15] very very important
[27:17] that is why the prophet of god said we
[27:19] should come in at least 30 minutes
[27:23] to time
[27:25] 30 minutes ahead of time
[27:27] it is not to sit and take sensors or
[27:30] count people as they come in or go out
[27:32] there is the time to just sit
[27:35] and commit yourself into the hands of
[27:37] god just prepare your heart
[27:40] try to get in line
[27:42] confess your sins your iniquities your
[27:44] weaknesses your faults
[27:45] not just for yourself but for your
[27:47] brothers for your sisters you are
[27:49] praying for the pastor you are praying
[27:51] just trusting god
[27:53] that is how very how much how very
[27:56] important this meditational part of the
[27:58] service is
[28:00] is very very important but we as a
[28:02] church
[28:03] have used part of it
[28:06] for the sunday school
[28:08] so you still have 15 minutes
[28:11] of that time that after sunday school
[28:14] you can still go to god and then seek
[28:16] the face of god prepare your heart
[28:18] prepare commit the service to this into
[28:20] his hands commit the song 72 cents just
[28:22] trust god the more you put in the
[28:24] service the more you get out
[28:27] it's just like an investment if i if you
[28:29] and i buy shares and i buy 10 10 shares
[28:32] from a company and you buy a thousand
[28:34] shares
[28:35] we're never going to get the same
[28:36] dividend
[28:37] you'll get more than i do
[28:39] it's just simple math right
[28:41] good
[28:42] but um what we see is that normally
[28:45] after the
[28:47] sunday school
[28:48] um
[28:49] you are free to walk out there take i
[28:51] mean drink water use the restroom come
[28:53] back
[28:54] but it is not okay to just go out there
[28:57] you know just
[28:59] while away time stand and converse um
[29:02] that doesn't look very good
[29:05] so uh it will be a very good thing
[29:07] after sunday school
[29:09] based on what you hear
[29:11] just talk to god you know
[29:13] for the next part of the service
[29:16] praise be to god
[29:17] god bless you or shall we pray
[29:19] our lord and our savior jesus we thank
[29:21] you so very much for how far time has
