[0:18] that's a paradox
[0:20] if it isn't tell me how you did it
[0:24] it was a paradox why because he
[0:28] is the word and the bible said the word
[0:30] of god
[0:31] is sharper than a two-eighth sword and a
[0:33] deserter of the thoughts and intents of
[0:36] the heart
[0:36] that prove that he was the word amen
[0:41] the same yesterday and forever it was a
[0:43] paradox
[0:44] when philip went around the hill and
[0:46] found nathanael and brought him back
[0:48] into the presence of jesus and jesus
[0:50] told him where he was the day before
[0:52] that was a paradox amen
[0:55] showed that he was the word behold an
[0:59] israelite in whom there's no god said
[1:00] when did you know me rabbi
[1:02] you said before philip called you when
[1:03] he was under the tree i saw you
[1:06] a paradox
[1:09] amen it was a paradox when a little
[1:12] businessman of the city of jericho a
[1:14] critic of the lord jesus
[1:16] climbed up in a sycamore tree to hide
[1:18] the scene pass by
[1:20] and when jesus of naza was coming
[1:21] walking down the street and stood right
[1:23] under the tree where it was
[1:24] and raised up there and called him by
[1:27] his name
[1:29] zacchaeus come down i'm going home with
[1:32] you for lunch
[1:34] amen a pass
[1:37] he had never seen the man all the days
[1:40] of his life he'd never laid eyes on him
[1:42] it was a paradox when maybe uh
[1:45] several hundreds of people yes maybe 15
[1:48] 200 people
[1:49] coming out of the city of jericho making
[1:52] fun of him and laughing at him when he
[1:53] left the city that afternoon
[1:55] or that morning rather as he was going
[1:57] out of the city
[1:58] when people were throwing over ripe
[2:00] vegetables at him
[2:02] and i could hear a priest say hey they
[2:04] tell me you raise the head
[2:06] hey you prophet you call yourself a
[2:08] prophet that
[2:09] we got a whole graveyard full of over
[2:11] here just man
[2:12] good man please like i am
[2:15] go up here raise them up let's see you
[2:18] raise the dead
[2:19] didn't even hear a word they said one
[2:21] hailing one thing in one another
[2:23] a way back over there against the wall
[2:26] some 250 yards
[2:28] a poor old beggar shivered in the cold
[2:30] air with his sleeve said oh jesus our
[2:33] son of david have mercy on me
[2:35] it stopped him in these tracks
[2:38] hallelujah a call from joshua
[2:42] not very far not not a 10 mile from
[2:45] where he was standing right there
[2:47] stopped the sun one day
[2:52] [Applause]
[2:55] the same kind of faith that joshua had
[2:58] amen because he know
[3:00] if he was the son of david he was a
[3:02] manifested messiah
[3:04] and he could give him back his sight
[3:06] [Music]
[3:08] a paradox oh my certainly was a paradox
[3:12] yes sir god it was a paradox
[3:16] how god could become man to die
[3:20] god life eternal life could become
[3:23] god natural life to die
[3:27] to save man to bring him back to eternal
[3:29] life
[3:30] that was a paradox how that the great uh
[3:33] god that filled all
[3:34] space and all eternity could come down
[3:37] and be a man in order to die to save
[3:40] uh his own creation how god became one
[3:43] of his own creations
[3:44] to save because he created his own body
[3:47] jehovah the father
[3:49] dwelt in fullness in jesus christ his
[3:52] son
[3:53] jesus was the body of god god was
[3:56] representing the tabernacle the flesh of
[3:58] jesus christ and how that one had filled
[4:01] all
[4:02] space and all eternity become one man
[4:06] amen you see what i mean there
[4:09] that god could do that to die and oh
[4:12] that was a paradox in itself
[4:15] how he could make himself that way in
[4:16] order to suffer death for the
[4:18] whole human race but oh what a paradox
[4:21] when a man had been crucified
[4:25] put to death pushed a big roman spear
[4:28] about
[4:28] six or eight inches wide through his
[4:30] heart and blood and water gushed out
[4:33] and they took him off the cross dead
[4:35] wrapped him in
[4:36] and cloth and laid him in a tomb he was
[4:39] so
[4:39] dead to the roman centurion said he was
[4:42] dead everybody there said he was dead
[4:43] the moon said he was dead the stars said
[4:45] he was dead the sun said he was dead
[4:47] the earth had a nervous prostration it
[4:49] said he was dead
[4:50] yeah and on the third day to raise up
[4:53] the life again
[4:56] that's a paradox hey man he said i have
[5:00] power to lay my life down i have
[5:02] power to take it up again a genuine
[5:06] paradox of god
[5:07] his resurrection one it was a paradox of
[5:11] god
[5:11] when jesus chose fishermen un
[5:14] instead of trained priests to carry his
[5:17] message
[5:19] looked like when he come here to come to
[5:20] the great pharisees and sadducees and
[5:23] said
[5:23] brethren you are the man who down to the
[5:25] ages has kept this denomination clean
[5:29] i come to take you down your fathers
[5:31] will be proud of you
[5:32] when they could look down over the rims
[5:34] of heaven and wherever they was
[5:35] i doubt it jesus said you're your father
[5:37] the devil so then
[5:39] uh broke down and said will we be happy
[5:41] they'd be happy to know this
[5:42] i've come now to take up where you all
[5:44] have brought it to it was a paradox when
[5:46] he condemned every one of them and told
[5:48] them they were of the devil
[5:49] and went down on the sea of galilee and
[5:52] picked up ignorant fishermen who didn't
[5:53] even know how to write their own name
[5:56] and given the keys to the kingdom of
[5:58] heaven instead of giving
[6:00] this is a high priest how could a man
[6:04] to a religion that's tried what they
[6:07] thought tried
[6:08] in their traditions and things to keep
[6:09] up the things of god
[6:11] and here he comes and selects another
[6:13] group down on the riviera when man is
[6:15] trained and educated and
[6:17] went through seminaries and schools and
[6:19] everything else then he comes right back
[6:21] around and ignores that it takes an
[6:23] ignorant fisherman and gives him the
[6:24] keys to the kingdom
[6:28] amen what makes a paradox is when
[6:31] somebody believes god and takes him at
[6:34] his word
[6:35] god's word spoke the world into
[6:37] existence that's the same thing you have
[6:39] to believe tonight
[6:40] is god's promised word
[6:44] look at that poor little woman standing
[6:46] down there at the well
[6:47] she said we know when messiah cometh
[6:49] he'll tell us these things
[6:51] he had told her what her trouble was she
[6:53] said sir i perceive that you're a
[6:55] prophet
[6:55] we know when the messiah cometh he'll
[6:57] tell us those things watch
[7:00] god talking to a heart
[7:04] glory to god a
[7:07] god talking to a prostitute
[7:11] amen and asking a favor bring me a drink
[7:16] think of it talk about a paradox what a
[7:20] paradox that that
[7:21] seed of eternal life predestinated
[7:24] before the foundational world
[7:26] could group out in such a thing as that
[7:28] by the desire of the flesh
[7:30] how that poor little woman probably
[7:31] turned on the street
[7:34] down in her heart she was predestinated
[7:35] to eternal life when the lamb was slain
[7:37] before the foundation earth
[7:39] according to the bible our names are put
[7:41] on that book jesus said no man can come
[7:43] to me except my father draws him and all
[7:45] the father has given me will come
[7:47] the scatter the light watch when that
[7:49] light hit those priests and all their
[7:51] intellects what happened
[7:52] they said he's beelzebub a fortune
[7:53] teller a devil
[7:56] he said you're your father the devil
[7:57] that's where it come from but when this
[7:59] little immoral woman
[8:01] talking to god and how could that
[8:03] predestinated seed be anchored in such a
[8:07] a bowel person is that it's a paradox
[8:11] but watch when the light struck it
[8:13] said sir i perceive that you are a
[8:16] prophet
[8:16] now prophet's where the word of the lord
[8:18] comes to the prophet see
[8:20] and that was her sin and he the prophet
[8:22] had the word
[8:23] so she said i perceive that you are a
[8:25] prophet now we know that when messiah
[8:27] cometh you'll do these things he said
[8:29] i'm he that speaks to you brother
[8:31] she left that the way she went
[8:34] her testimony saved her city psycho
[8:38] now that was a paradox when god when
[8:41] jesus did that
[8:42] yesterday it was a paradigm when god put
[8:44] his spirit
[8:46] in the pentecostals the poor fishermen
[8:49] and
[8:49] uneducated people instead of campuses
[8:52] the high priest
[8:53] and oh how he put his gospel
[8:56] it was a paradox when god chose the way
[9:00] that's called
[9:01] heresy crazy people staggered jumping
[9:04] carrying on acting like they were insane
[9:07] they called him crazy it's a paradox
[9:10] when god would bypass the great high
[9:12] synagogues
[9:13] the great sanhedrin courts and the great
[9:16] high scholar priest and pick up a bunch
[9:19] of ignorant unlearned fishermen
[9:21] that had no no more than just to believe
[9:23] him and to take his word
[9:25] and see the results and it pleased god
[9:27] to bypass what they call the most
[9:30] holy thing in the world to pick up a
[9:32] bunch of low trash
[9:33] it was called and the way that they were
[9:35] worshiping called heresy
[9:37] to make the way of salvation yes
[9:41] and that's the truth you can't deny
[9:45] paul said in a way it's called heresy
[9:47] that's the way i worship
[9:48] my god the god of our fathers the way
[9:51] that's called heresy
[9:52] yes it was a paradox on that great
[9:55] pillar of fire
[9:56] that come down from heaven an angel of
[10:00] the lord
[10:01] a pillar of fire led the children of
[10:03] israel through the wilderness that was a
[10:05] paradox
[10:06] that talked to moses out there in a
[10:08] burning bush and it was a paradox and
[10:10] 800 years later
[10:12] and according to the scripture in saint
[10:13] john 8 58 if you want to know where it's
[10:15] at
[10:15] your lord start up verses exodus 13 31
[10:19] and it was a paradox when after all that
[10:23] journey and all that time
[10:24] that here jesus said that before
[10:28] abraham was i am i
[10:32] am was in the burning bush i am was the
[10:35] one that talked to moses
[10:37] it was a strange thing that after his
[10:39] death burial and resurrection
[10:41] saw that little hook-nosed jew crabbit
[10:44] nasty temper and even put some of the
[10:46] church to death on his road down to
[10:48] damascus to rest those people
[10:50] and down there they had a prophet named
[10:52] ananias and was down there prophesying
[10:54] to him a prophet of the lord telling the
[10:56] word of the lord because he come to him
[10:58] and while pastor ananias was down there
[11:01] prophesying
[11:02] saul went down to get him and right in
[11:04] the middle of the day
[11:05] that same pillar of fire that come down
[11:08] and led
[11:09] israel struck saul to the ground and all
[11:12] the people standing around
[11:13] could not see it but it's right to paul
[11:15] to put his eyes out
[11:18] amen he was blind it was so real to him
[11:22] and the rest of him couldn't see it
[11:23] it's a paradox i thought what one senses
[11:27] of one person would declare it would
[11:28] declare to another
[11:29] that's the reason people can sit in
[11:31] there in a meeting and look at the work
[11:33] of the lord and get up and walk out and
[11:34] make fun of it
[11:35] and the other holds to it with all the
[11:38] heart it's a paradox now
[11:39] god can take
[11:44] to see how god does it even in this day
[11:46] it was a paradox for paul
[11:48] you know paul never did see jesus in
[11:50] physical form
[11:52] he had to accept the revelation just
[11:54] like peter did
[11:55] peter never know jesus by physical form
[11:57] he said who does man say i the son of
[11:59] man am
[12:00] someone said while you're moses and some
[12:02] say you're elias and jeremiah's
[12:04] he said that's not what i asked what do
[12:05] you say peter said the heart the christ
[12:08] the son of the living god
[12:09] he said blessed art thou simon the son
[12:12] of jonas
[12:13] flesh and blood does not reveal it to
[12:15] you but my father which is in heaven has
[12:17] revealed it upon this rock
[12:19] i'll build my church gates of hell
[12:22] cannot prevail against it
[12:24] there you are a paradox when he was
[12:27] standing there and didn't know him in
[12:28] human flesh
[12:29] but he noted by his works in revelation
[12:31] seemed to fulfill exactly what the
[12:33] scripture is
[12:34] that's the same kind of a paradox that
[12:36] brings a man from some old cold form of
[12:38] creed
[12:38] into a living god the paradox to see the
[12:41] same man read the same bible and deny
[12:44] what the other will believe it and
[12:45] accept the evidence of it
[12:47] it's a paradox when he can see it
[12:49] working on the other fellow sure you
[12:50] ought to know
[12:51] that it's the same god his creed's wrong
[12:54] if it's contrary if god's vindicating
[12:56] his word then your creed's wrong
[12:59] amen don't mean to be so rude but that's
[13:03] the truth
[13:04] of paradox i said 30 minutes
[13:07] and it's just exactly that
[13:11] i got about six pages of note your head
[13:15] paradox do you believe in it hey man
[13:19] i believe it i'll stop let me tell you
[13:21] something
[13:22] listen uh here's some time ago
[13:25] down in the south where i come from
[13:29] i was having a little bit of ice cream
[13:32] one day
[13:33] an old druggist friend of mine a real
[13:35] old born again
[13:36] saint he was a real man i hadn't seen
[13:40] him for some time i was going through
[13:41] the city
[13:42] i stopped to see him and i seen his name
[13:45] up there and i thought well there
[13:46] he's got this busy shirt he's been there
[13:48] for years i went up
[13:50] went in and darry was sitting there
[13:51] looking out over his little glasses you
[13:53] know
[13:53] and i looked over his little glasses and
[13:55] hung down on his cheek
[13:57] and he said well if it isn't brother
[13:59] brandon and he raised up and come put
[14:01] his arms and
[14:02] how many come back and he told his son
[14:04] said go get us some some ice cream
[14:06] we said there's have a cup of coffee i
[14:07] said no sir i talked you to death if he
[14:09] give me a cup of coffee i said it makes
[14:11] me nervous i said i'll just take some
[14:12] ice cream
[14:13] so we got some ice cream out and the
[14:15] girls is back there and so forth in the
[14:17] store
[14:18] and we sat and had a little fellowship
[14:19] around the ice cream he said
[14:22] brother branham i want to tell you
[14:24] something he said
[14:25] i've been a little reluctant to tell
[14:26] other people we got to talk about the
[14:28] lord and his goodness the old fellow
[14:30] crying and
[14:31] tears running down his cheeks and he
[14:33] said i want to tell you something he
[14:35] said
[14:36] it may seem strange to to you he said
[14:39] but i believe that a person like you
[14:40] would understand it
[14:42] i said well go ahead brother what is it
[14:44] he said back in during the time of the
[14:46] depression
[14:48] he said my grey-headed son there was
[14:50] just a young man
[14:52] and said we were here in the this
[14:53] business then
[14:55] and he said uh but people were poor and
[14:58] didn't have nothing to eat and
[15:00] want to get an order to get medicine or
[15:02] something they had to go and stand in
[15:03] line and many of you remember that
[15:04] sure you knew stand in the line to get a
[15:06] little okay from the county
[15:08] that you could get these drugs or get
[15:10] something to eat and he said
[15:12] i was sitting here one day reading my
[15:14] bible and
[15:16] and said somebody come in the door and
[15:17] my son got up young went up to the front
[15:20] and said i heard him say no we can't do
[15:22] it
[15:23] and said i listened close i laid my word
[15:25] down
[15:27] and i listened close and the man said
[15:29] sir
[15:30] he said my wife's about to faint when he
[15:33] looked he said he'd seen the woman
[15:34] ready to be delivered of a baby the
[15:37] young couple
[15:38] the young man said to him he said i i
[15:41] stood in that line there said it's
[15:43] all a city block long and said my wife
[15:46] just can't
[15:46] stand there any longer said i wonder
[15:49] i've got the prescription from the
[15:50] doctor
[15:51] she must have the medicine right away
[15:53] said will you feel it and then i'll take
[15:56] her home and then i'll go stand in the
[15:57] line
[15:57] i'll i'll get the the order for it if
[16:00] you and this
[16:01] boy said sir that's against the rule
[16:03] share we we can't do it he said well
[16:05] i didn't know he said thank you very
[16:06] much son turn to walk away
[16:09] and he said justice started well
[16:12] somebody said
[16:13] to him that down his heart said joseph
[16:16] and mary was turned away one time too
[16:19] and said i raised up and said wait son
[16:21] just a minute
[16:22] it said the fella stopped no one got the
[16:26] prescription
[16:27] he got back behind there and fill it
[16:28] while he waited holding his wife for the
[16:30] hand and she was so
[16:32] faint she was just leaning over on his
[16:34] shoulder he said i walked out there and
[16:36] i
[16:36] he said i'm sorry i have to do this sir
[16:39] he said that's all right he had his head
[16:40] down
[16:40] and just handed out and when he laid it
[16:43] in
[16:44] his hand he said brother oh so
[16:47] jesus then i laid it right in his hand
[16:51] said brother brown there he was just
[16:52] exactly the way the picture shows it
[16:54] and said i i couldn't talk and the man
[16:58] turned around walked out of the building
[17:00] he said you believe that brother branham
[17:02] and i said i believe it with all
[17:04] that's on the inside of me certainly
[17:09] saint martin of course if you've ever
[17:11] read of saint martin
[17:13] he was a soldier and he was
[17:16] he was is followed his father's
[17:18] footsteps he always felt the call of god
[17:21] only i think his people wasn't exactly
[17:23] religious and
[17:25] one day he was coming as a bad winner
[17:28] the history says and he was
[17:30] an old beggar laying out at the gate
[17:33] and he was freezing to death and many
[17:36] people who could have fed that old man
[17:38] or give him some clothes
[17:39] he was crying holding his hand up just
[17:41] an old whiskered
[17:43] dirty man laying at the gate of the city
[17:46] and he's saying help me somebody i'm
[17:49] freezing
[17:50] the the night i'll die somebody give me
[17:53] a garment
[17:54] saint martin doesn't give all he had
[17:56] away he just
[17:58] as a soldier he had his coat on he stood
[18:01] for one side and watched and see if
[18:02] somebody wouldn't do it
[18:03] the people come and gone and nobody
[18:06] would help him
[18:07] then he reached up there and looked at
[18:08] the old man he had compassion on him
[18:10] pulled his own coat off and took his
[18:11] sword and cut it in half wrapped parted
[18:13] around his shoulders
[18:15] tucked the other half and wrapped the
[18:16] old beggar in it so he lived through the
[18:18] night
[18:18] went walking on the people laughed and
[18:21] said what a funny looking soldier
[18:23] with only half a coat on that night
[18:26] while he was sleeping in the bed he woke
[18:29] up somebody walked into the room
[18:30] he looked standing across the room and
[18:32] there stood jesus with that old piece of
[18:34] garment
[18:34] is wrapped around him he knew by that
[18:37] he was a man saint martin was one of the
[18:40] man who contended back there for the
[18:43] faith that was once delivered to the
[18:44] saints
[18:45] he believed in the miracles of god he
[18:47] believed in speaking with tongues he
[18:49] believed
[18:49] and all the testament that was wrote by
[18:51] the apostles
[18:52] he believed in and contended for it as
[18:55] long as he lived in god performed
[18:57] miracles
[18:58] he knew when he seen that old beggar
[19:01] wrapped in the piece of garment
[19:02] of his own coat that the word of god was
[19:05] fulfilled
[19:06] in so much as you have done unto the
[19:08] least of these my little ones you have
[19:10] done it unto me
[19:11] you say the man didn't see it i believe
[19:13] i received it
[19:14] i believe he got it i believe that it
[19:17] hits there
[19:17] i believe that was jesus he looked at it
[19:20] was a revelation of god
[19:21] made manifest because he carried out
[19:24] talk about a paradox
[19:25] there's coming one when the dead in
[19:28] christ shall rise
[19:29] and we which are alive shall be changed
[19:32] in a moment in the twinkling of an
[19:33] eye to be caught up together to meet him
[19:35] in the air yes
[19:37] oh how god keeps his word in this
[19:39] intellectual age
[19:40] how he's the same yesterday today and
[19:42] forever how he can still discern the
[19:44] thoughts of the human heart
[19:46] i can still change man i can still keep
[19:49] every word that he promised in this day
[19:51] he's the same yesterday and forever how
[19:54] he can still
[19:54] manifest and let him take the picture of
[19:56] that same pillar of fire
[19:58] that powered israel the same one that
[20:00] was with the lord jesus the same
[20:02] one was down there it was saw on the
[20:04] road the same one that come in and
[20:05] delivered peter
[20:06] out of the prison that same angel of god
[20:09] is shared tonight and doing the very
[20:11] same thing it did what it was
[20:13] here on earth manifested in human flesh
[20:16] why
[20:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[20:20] forever do you believe in a paradox
[20:24] i believe that god's wanting people to
[20:26] believe in a paradox
[20:28] i went way over my time i believe it
[20:30] could be a paradox right here
[20:32] amen i believe that god is willing and
[20:36] wanting to take his people and show
[20:38] himself
[20:39] if he can only get a man or a woman boy
[20:41] or girl to lay down their own thoughts
[20:44] and become a prisoner to him and believe
[20:46] believing
[20:47] he says word in the beginning was the
[20:50] word and the word was with god and the
[20:52] word was god and the word was made flesh
[20:54] and dwelt among us
[20:55] and now he's in you the hope of glory
[20:59] the same yesterday today and forever he
[21:01] said in saint john 14
[21:03] 12 he that believeth on me the works
[21:05] that i do shall he do also
[21:07] he promised in saint luke that as it was
[21:10] in the days of sodom
[21:11] when the elected church abraham's group
[21:14] would receive a sign like abraham
[21:16] received and lotz group
[21:17] would receive a sign like locked in it's
[21:20] a very strange thing that we've had all
[21:22] these great reformers of luther and
[21:24] wesley
[21:24] but never did we ever have a man out
[21:27] there with his name
[21:28] ending in h.a.m a messenger to the world
[21:34] g-r-a-h-a-m
[21:36] that's six letters a-b-r-a-h-a-m is
[21:40] abraham
[21:40] we've had moody sankey spinning knox
[21:42] calvin but never a ham
[21:44] father to the nations we got one now
[21:47] that's a paradox
[21:49] you know that and look he's doing just
[21:51] exactly called him out of sodom
[21:53] but remember abraham had a messenger up
[21:56] there to his group too
[21:58] amen what kind of a sign did he do with
[22:01] his back turned to the tent
[22:02] said i'm going to visit you according to
[22:05] the
[22:06] time i'm a promise according to time of
[22:08] life he said where's your wife sarah
[22:10] said she's
[22:10] the tent behind you and when he said
[22:13] that sarah laughed to herself he said
[22:15] why
[22:16] did cell laugh saying these things can't
[22:18] be
[22:19] see jesus said as it was in the days of
[22:22] lot so
[22:23] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[22:24] man the works that i do
[22:26] god's word becomes so if ye abide me
[22:30] my words abide in you ask any of them
[22:33] you will and it will be made manifest to
[22:35] you
[22:36] a paradox to see a promised god
[22:40] a promise of god that's been made for 2
[22:43] 000 years and church ethics has drawn
[22:45] the people so far away
[22:46] but in the midst of all of it god comes
[22:49] right
[22:49] down and burst that word right back into
[22:52] his church
[22:53] just exactly it is a paradox do you
[22:55] believe him
[22:57] let us pray
[23:00] if there's people in here tonight that
[23:02] would want to see a paradox performed on
[23:04] you to change your heart
[23:06] from unbelief to faith in god would you
[23:08] raise your hands and say lord remember
[23:10] me
[23:10] remember me god bless you oh let's look
[23:13] at the hands heavenly father
[23:15] there is so many hands i wouldn't be
[23:19] able to say god bless to each one
[23:21] but thou knowest them all change their
[23:24] thinking lord
[23:25] oh let it happen a paradox they've
[23:27] always kind of stooped around
[23:29] they've halfway believed maybe maybe
[23:31] some of them even belong to church but
[23:33] yet
[23:34] they have never met that time that when
[23:36] they had that supreme
[23:37] freedom believed and know that what god
[23:41] promised god was able to do yet we
[23:43] profess to be the seed of abraham
[23:45] who staggered not the promise of god
[23:47] through unbelief of a strong giving
[23:49] praise to god
[23:51] now father god i pray thee in jesus name
[23:54] to have mercy upon them
[23:56] oh god come down among us tonight
[23:59] move upon us and show us that you're
[24:02] still a
[24:03] god of miracles make a paradox lord
[24:06] and show that your word still can
[24:08] discern the thoughts of the intents of
[24:10] the heart
[24:11] you're still the same one that was
[24:13] manifested out there that abraham called
[24:15] elohim the lord god creator the
[24:19] all-sufficient one
[24:20] the self-existing one oh
[24:23] god you're still eternal god the same
[24:26] yesterday today and forever
[24:28] and the blood of your son has sanctified
[24:31] a church and
[24:32] cleansed it that the word oh if they
[24:34] could only tuck it without adding creed
[24:36] lord
[24:37] but now he said i am
[24:40] the vine ye are the branches
[24:44] the branch bears the fruit of the vine
[24:47] for the life
[24:48] of the vine or the branch comes from the
[24:52] vine
[24:53] how we thank thee for this lord how
[24:55] perfect it is
[24:56] and in this day of unbelief and
[24:58] superstitions
[25:00] and all kinds of creed yet you're the
[25:02] same god that stopped the sun for joshua
[25:05] you're the same one was on the stick
[25:07] that moses stretched over the sea
[25:09] you're the same one that could call rice
[25:11] fleas frogs
[25:13] whatever it was by the mouth of moses
[25:15] you're the same god that could put
[25:16] rain in the skies you're the same one
[25:18] that's going to rain far out of the
[25:20] skies
[25:20] you're the same yesterday today and
[25:23] forever
[25:23] oh lord god show us thy glory tonight by
[25:27] saving and filling every person that
[25:30] raised their hand
[25:31] granted lord may it just not be another
[25:34] self-starched prayer may it not be
[25:36] another self-starch way
[25:38] of raising up a hand under a little
[25:40] influence of of something but may it be
[25:42] from the
[25:43] depths of their heart that the people
[25:45] cries out oh
[25:46] lord god created me a faith that
[25:49] can believe you and can accept every
[25:52] word and punctuate every promise with an
[25:54] amen
[25:55] granted father i committed to you now
[25:58] in the name of jesus christ amen
[26:02] all right
[26:08] it's ten o'clock we don't have to have a
[26:11] prayer line up here we have it out there
[26:14] you believe it how many in here
[26:17] that believes that he's the same
[26:18] yesterday and forever that believes that
[26:20] that little woman had touched his
[26:22] garment
[26:22] with her finger then he was he was
[26:25] physical
[26:26] she touched his garment there's a
[26:28] paradox
[26:30] he could not feel it and he turned
[26:32] around said who touched me
[26:34] and she couldn't hide herself and he
[26:37] told her her troubles
[26:39] and her faith healed her and the bible
[26:41] says today
[26:42] in hebrews that he is a
[26:45] high priest that can be touched by the
[26:48] feeling of our infirmities
[26:49] how many sick people believe that raise
[26:52] your hand
[26:53] [Music]
[26:57] all right you believe it and just see
[27:01] now
[27:01] if that's true you say brother brown how
[27:03] does that come
[27:04] just believing the word just the way
[27:06] it's wrong
[27:08] don't take any here say what this guy
[27:10] says it's this way and this guy says
[27:12] that we
[27:12] believe it just the way it's wrote if
[27:14] he's got to judge you by the way it's
[27:16] wrote then why
[27:16] take somebody else's interpretation for
[27:18] it because that's where it's going to be
[27:19] judged
[27:20] just that's that's his standard he's
[27:22] watched over his word
[27:24] there's nothing wrong with it that's
[27:25] just exactly the word
[27:27] that's what we will be judged by is this
[27:29] is god's word
[27:31] and if you abide me that's the faith
[27:34] my word abide in you cause he is the
[27:37] word
[27:37] then ask what you will
[27:41] now you touch his garment say lord jesus
[27:44] i believe with all my heart that we're
[27:46] living in the last days
[27:48] i believe you are the same god that
[27:51] performed all these miracles that
[27:53] our pastor has showed us tonight in the
[27:55] word
[27:56] i believe that you are the high priest
[27:59] lord let me touch your garment
[28:01] then you speak to this brother if it
[28:04] claims
[28:04] that you speak through him and then he
[28:07] doesn't know me
[28:09] but you know me and then see if he isn't
[28:12] the same god of miracles and there'll be
[28:14] a
[28:14] paradox again an unsearchable thing that
[28:17] man can not discern and tell
[28:23] will you believe it if he will
[28:26] do it then we know it'll be a paradox is
[28:29] that right
[28:30] i was going to have a prayer line that
[28:31] got so caught away on that time
[28:33] i just got away from it and time's just
[28:36] about gone
[28:38] you believe let's start over i can't i
[28:40] have to separate you
[28:41] let's start on this side here somebody
[28:43] this way how many over here knows that i
[28:45] don't know you're north about to raise
[28:47] up your hands and you're sick you know
[28:48] what
[28:48] you won't ask god all right some of you
[28:51] believe
[28:52] just just take this
[28:55] with all your heart lord jesus
[28:59] the same yesterday and forever let me
[29:02] touch your
[29:03] heart my faith is moving to you y'all
[29:06] are on the right hand of god
[29:07] setting in majesty and your holy spirit
[29:10] that was in you is your tonight
[29:13] let me just touch by faith lord
[29:18] then see if he is still the author of
[29:22] paradox to bring things to pass that's
[29:25] absolutely
[29:27] [Music]
[29:29] unknown
[29:34] just be reverend here
[29:38] see this right here it's a colored lady
[29:41] sitting right back over here
[29:47] she's bothered with a kidney condition
[29:52] she's just had an operation
[29:53] [Music]
[29:56] i don't know the lady i'm a stranger
[29:59] is that right lady but that is true
[30:01] isn't it
[30:03] do you believe that the same god that
[30:06] could tell
[30:06] that little woman had touched his
[30:08] garment over there
[30:10] and on the other side of the lake
[30:13] do you believe that that's the same god
[30:15] you couldn't touch me physically you
[30:16] know
[30:17] so i didn't i don't know yet so there is
[30:19] a high priest
[30:20] because he said he was a high priest is
[30:23] that right
[30:24] and you believe it when you were there
[30:26] praying for to be
[30:27] you something struck me and immediately
[30:30] i called
[30:31] about it is that right all right this
[30:34] operation you had
[30:35] didn't seem to be too successful you're
[30:36] not getting well
[30:38] to and you're alarmed about it and you
[30:40] come here tonight for that same
[30:43] purpose if the lord jesus will reveal to
[30:45] me who you are like he did simon had
