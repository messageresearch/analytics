[41:12] beginning of God but I would just say in
[41:15] the beginning praise the
[41:18] Lord on my Note this said the beginning
[41:21] of God but I was said in the beginning
[41:23] the thought kind of struck me tonight I
[41:25] will share that with you
[41:27] is uh uh we know that God is infinite
[41:30] amen we know that he's infinite we know
[41:33] that he has no beginning he has no end

[41:45] explain myself tonight before I go home

[41:51] I'm going to come up on the other side
[41:53] praise the
[41:54] Lord so we just just want to thank the
[41:57] Lord and uh uh we want to uh greet uh uh
[42:02] brother shedra for coming to be with us
[42:05] tonight good to see you my friend Happy
[42:07] New
[42:10] Year Praise the Lord he kept promising
[42:13] me he will come and then uh uh so I kept
[42:16] looking on the road to see him and never
[42:18] saw when he enter praise the Lord or El
[42:22] I was going to call him in the office
[42:23] for us to talk a little bit but word is
[42:27] good to be in the house of the Lord so
[42:28] tonight I I want to talk on the on the
[42:32] uh the
[42:34] beginning just as we are beginning the
[42:36] year and the the reason why and the way
[42:40] I'm going with this is just to say
[42:43] there uh uh when
[42:47] God before he be he became God we know
[42:51] that he was the great intern of spirit
[42:54] and uh uh
[42:57] he was the great internal Spirit he was
[43:00] Elohim we have to know that God uh
[43:06] uh God When when when when he became an
[43:10] object of worship there was a beginning
[43:13] and that's what we will look into
[43:15] tonight but before we do that I just
[43:18] give the background of what why I came
[43:20] up with this subject and I thought that
[43:23] uh like I said as as as a church as a
[43:27] people as children of God uh we will
[43:30] realize that uh the great in of God for
[43:34] him to come down and express himself he
[43:37] had a beginning there was a beginning to
[43:40] death God himself don't have a beginning
[43:44] we know that uh he's self-existent we
[43:47] know that uh uh he don't have a father
[43:50] you know our mother no beginning of time
[43:53] no beginning of day that is the Great
[43:56] internal Spirit but in expressing
[44:00] himself uh uh there was a beginning and
[44:03] there was what Moses referred to when he
[44:07] said in the beginning God created the
[44:09] Heaven and the
[44:11] Earth but uh uh if you remember uh on on
[44:15] Sunday night while we had our our uh how
[44:21] we can call it crossover service last
[44:24] service of the year coming into the new
[44:26] year we were speaking on something and
[44:29] uh that is that is the
[44:31] attraction uh uh what we were asking
[44:34] ourself what is our attraction for this
[44:37] year what are we attracted to and uh uh
[44:42] and then in talking about that I read a
[44:46] scripture uh uh I read a scripture over
[44:50] there in in uh St John where Jesus said
[44:54] if I be lifted up
[44:56] I will draw all men unto me and uh uh
[45:00] and then I was also talking about uh uh
[45:04] the drawing
[45:06] principle I spoke about the five
[45:09] kingdoms that we have we have uh uh uh
[45:14] from from the kingdom of God to the hon
[45:17] Kingdom and then the animal kingdom the
[45:20] plants Kingdom and also the mineral
[45:23] Kingdom and uh if if you realized that
[45:26] night I don't know whether I was uh
[45:29] because I was tired or or so I I I saw
[45:33] myself a little bit struggling on on the
[45:35] subject to be able to bring there
[45:37] rightly but as I was uh uh uh thinking
[45:41] about there
[45:43] today uh meditating
[45:46] today for some reason I went right back
[45:49] to the same place again uh uh looking at
[45:53] that word when Jesus said if I be lifted
[45:57] up I will draw all men unto me and it's
[46:01] it's because of that scripture I was
[46:03] trying to Brak the the the the principle
[46:07] of drawing the principle of uh of of how
[46:12] God you know draw us onto him and uh and
[46:16] then as I was looking at there there was
[46:18] a scripture also in the Book of James
[46:22] that that spring out to me uh James said
[46:27] draw night unto God and He will draw
[46:30] night unto
[46:32] you praise the Lord amen draw night unto
[46:37] God and He will draw night onto you so
[46:41] all of that you know uh uh brought me to
[46:43] the place that I thought that it would
[46:45] be it would be it would be beautiful for
[46:47] us to just look at a little bit on their
[46:50] principle of drawing before we go any
[46:53] further tonight so just like like I was
[46:56] talking about those five kingdoms you
[46:59] will realize that uh uh uh it has it has
[47:04] an ascending order it has a descending
[47:07] order and uh uh but as we talks about
[47:11] drawing tonight you will realize that uh
[47:15] uh for the minus to come
[47:19] up uh for us to be a benefit from them
[47:23] like I said the plant kingdom has to
[47:26] reach
[47:27] them okay the pl Kingdom has to reach
[47:30] down in the soil of the earth to be able
[47:32] to draw the mineral up and uh uh the the
[47:37] potassium and and uh and and all the
[47:40] different minerals electrolytes and all
[47:42] of that uh uh brother Brandon will
[47:45] always call them the 16
[47:47] elements and uh they are all in the
[47:50] earth God placed them in the earth and
[47:53] uh and and he structure it is way way
[47:56] that the plant will have to reach down
[47:58] and draw them and then uh uh the animals
[48:02] will also have to reach down to the
[48:04] plant and draw them out of the plant and
[48:07] sometimes we go and eat plant and
[48:10] vegetables and and all of that uh uh and
[48:13] then we get down to the animon kidum and
[48:16] uh and then also almighty God step down
[48:20] into their human kingom but as I was
[48:25] thinking about uh that whole
[48:27] drawing uh uh principle
[48:31] today my mind uh got uh a little bit uh
[48:36] stuck on their thought when I was
[48:39] reading the book of James draw night
[48:41] onto me and I will draw night onto you
[48:45] you know because of the way that uh uh
[48:49] the grace of God has helped us with the
[48:51] opening of the word in the sense of uh
[48:55] uh the understanding of the word
[48:57] sometimes your mind gets to that place
[49:00] where uh you you get a little bit uh uh
[49:04] you you you really trying to try to
[49:06] figure out uh the best way to be able to
[49:10] understand this because the truth of the
[49:12] of the matter there is that it is not we
[49:15] first that draw onto God he's the one
[49:18] that reached down onto us and he's the
[49:21] one actually that is drawing us onto him
[49:25] praise the Lord Lord so then I started
[49:27] looking through uh uh different things
[49:30] in the scripture instead in this
[49:32] afternoon to be able to make a little
[49:35] sense of that so we will just read few
[49:37] quotes here before we get into our
[49:40] subject tonight if you would just bear
[49:42] with me we will start with unconditional
[49:45] Covenant this one just nailed it for me
[49:48] it nailed it it really helped me uh uh
[49:52] he's talking about elshad he's talking
[49:55] about God being elsh there the breasted
[49:58] one he says watch I
[50:01] am the breasted one just draw n unto me
[50:07] now so if you take the sense of the
[50:10] breasted one and uh uh uh uh the baby uh
[50:15] will be will be crying the baby will be
[50:18] hungry it will have to take the mother
[50:20] you know to just get close to the little
[50:23] one then you see the little one swinging
[50:25] in the head to be able to grab the
[50:27] breast or grab the bottle to be able to
[50:30] breast field so for us to ever draw
[50:33] night onto God is because he has come
[50:39] close praise the Lord is because he has
[50:43] come
[50:44] close there is no way in our human self
[50:48] we can draw night to
[50:50] him just the same way there is no way
[50:53] the minus from the earth can can can you
[50:56] know can can can can can come up can
[50:58] draw up by thems except the plant roots
[51:01] gets down in the earth to be able to
[51:04] draw them
[51:06] up so he's the breasted
[51:09] one praise the Lord he is the breasted
[51:13] one and that is the reason why we don't
[51:16] take uh uh you know Glory when God is
[51:19] blessing you in your prayer life or you
[51:22] are reading the word and you are
[51:23] enjoying the word and he's opening your
[51:26] understanding in the word you don't
[51:28] think that it is yourself because you
[51:30] spending many hours no it's because he's
[51:34] around his present is
[51:36] around and that's that is that is the
[51:39] Consciousness that I want to come to and
[51:42] I and I also want to bring you to that
[51:44] is because he present is around let's
[51:47] look at this other one great Shining
[51:48] Light he says and if you
[51:51] notice God only reveal himself to those
[51:54] who search
[51:56] and long to see him draw night unto me
[52:01] and I will draw night unto you said the
[52:04] Lord and sometimes God let things happen
[52:09] that's that's what I want for us to
[52:11] understand because it's he drawing n to
[52:14] be able to Brink you so what will he do
[52:16] he will allow things to
[52:20] happen God let things to happen so that
[52:24] we will draw
[52:25] unto
[52:27] him for God has surely ordained that
[52:31] certain even must take place and they
[52:35] will unfold just as his great time take
[52:41] it
[52:42] off praise the Lord so he will allow
[52:46] things to happen we might not understand
[52:50] it but it is him drawing us n to him
[52:54] he's conditioning
[52:56] Us Praise the
[52:58] Lord he's conditioning us so we can get
[53:02] into that channel to draw night onto
[53:08] him let's take another thought here also
[53:12] and I think it will be it uh it will be
[53:16] good for prayer meetings to be going on
[53:19] all the day long around
[53:21] here just everywhere for you cannot get
[53:26] anything from God until you get closer
[53:30] to God you know it is written in the
[53:34] scripture draw night unto me and I will
[53:37] draw night unto you praise the Lord amen
[53:42] and if we are here now uh and if we are
[53:47] here now for one so purpose that is to
[53:50] draw not unto God let do that with all
[53:54] that is within us draw nigh unto God now
[53:59] if you look at the scripture other there
[54:02] draw nigh onto me and I will draw now
[54:05] onto you it almost sound like God is
[54:07] saying you have to move first before I
[54:12] move praise the Lord no the real sense
[54:16] is that you move because he has moved
[54:19] you
[54:23] amen it's almost like God saying to Adam
[54:26] Adam Adam where are
[54:29] you no God knew where Adam was Adam
[54:32] never knew where he
[54:36] was praise the
[54:38] Lord
[54:41] amen it was not it was not a a a
[54:45] question of seeking for Adam it was just
[54:48] a question of Awakening him do you know
[54:51] actually Where You
[54:54] Are
[54:56] do we know where we are tonight praise
[54:59] the
[55:00] Lord let's take one more and then uh we
[55:04] will we'll turn over
[55:07] here blos that's the greatest time of
[55:11] anybody's
[55:13] life is just to sit down and
[55:18] meditate take everything off your
[55:21] mind if you would do that there wouldn't
[55:25] be so much nervousness around the
[55:29] country if we who just think on
[55:33] God draw night unto me and I will draw
[55:39] night unto you praise the
[55:44] Lord now so uh uh uh we we we also
[55:51] know uh the thought what brother bam say
[55:54] when when you are talking about him
[55:56] that's when he comes night so if you
[55:59] follow that that trench of thought you
[56:02] will see that he he he drive us to that
[56:06] place the way of drawing that unto God
[56:10] is thinking about his
[56:14] promises thinking that he is
[56:18] able praise the Lord
[56:22] amen it's I mean it's it's it's is just
[56:25] is just is just thinking on him
[56:27] meditating upon his
[56:32] word because that's what brings his
[56:34] presence night on on uh unchangeable
[56:39] word of God you
[56:42] know is as you think of him that's when
[56:47] he draw closer to
[56:49] you so just think about
[56:53] that if you you draw nigh to
[56:57] God is keeping him on your
[57:01] mind meditating upon his
[57:05] word counting him uh able to do
[57:10] everything that he have promised to
[57:13] do praise the Lord so well I pray that
[57:16] uh the Lord will be able to help us
[57:18] because Jesus said you know uh uh if he
[57:22] be lifted
[57:23] up He will draw
[57:26] Us Praise the Lord and you know that's
[57:30] the principle of drawing you know
[57:32] drawing don't go down drawing goes
[57:35] up praise the Lord if you ever had to
[57:39] pull water from the well you know that's
[57:42] that's the way it goes you know the
[57:44] bucket goes down and then you keep
[57:45] drawing like this you got to pull the
[57:47] bucket up so Jesus said if he be lifted
[57:50] up He will draw all men onto unto him
[57:55] so uh that is that is that is that for
[57:58] for that uh for that talk tonight I want
[58:01] to talk on uh uh the beginning the
[58:04] beginning of God I actually took this
[58:07] thought uh uh in the in the in a short
[58:11] subject I spoke on
[58:13] uh uh while I was
[58:16] away and then uh uh it started uh uh you
[58:20] know uh coming back to my mind and
[58:24] thinking about
[58:27] it now you will realize that uh
[58:32] uh John when he wrote his
[58:36] book in the beginning was the word the
[58:39] word was with God and the Word was
[58:43] God Sunday we spoke a little bit on the
[58:47] the genology of Jesus
[58:50] Christ I'm hoping that this coming
[58:53] Sunday we can continue
[58:55] on uh on talking about the subject of
[58:57] the king uh there is there's a whole lot
[59:01] that we couldn't get to last Sunday so
[59:03] maybe by the grace of God if the Lord
[59:05] help us we might continue in that
[59:07] direction but I want you to realize that
[59:11] uh it was only Matthew and Luke that
[59:16] took uh uh the genealogy of Jesus Christ
[59:21] and both of them came in a very unique
[59:24] way
[59:25] and by the grace of God we going to look
[59:27] at that Matthew approach was very unique
[59:32] like I said his approach was all about
[59:37] uh presenting our Lord as the
[59:41] king I believe that the Holy Spirit had
[59:44] that on him for him to bring everything
[59:48] about the kingship of Jesus Christ and
[59:51] we're going to look at that as the Lord
[59:53] would trust us as the Lord will help us
[59:56] now Luke on the approach was
[59:59] different and uh uh uh uh Luke talk
[1:00:05] about the savior he he talk about the
[1:00:09] visitation of of the of uh the angels to
[1:00:15] uh the the the the uh the Shepherds on
[1:00:19] the hill and we realize that Luke
[1:00:23] experienc was much earlier you will
[1:00:25] realize that Luke in his
[1:00:29] account he spoke about the people that
[1:00:34] witness Jesus earlier experience he's
[1:00:38] talking about the Shepherds on the hill
[1:00:41] he spoke about uh uh uh after 8 Days
[1:00:47] Jesus had to go uh uh to the
[1:00:51] temple to be circumcised under the
[1:00:54] Covenant of Abraham they had to
[1:00:57] circumcise the little boy and there was
[1:00:59] a blind woman Hanah that was in the
[1:01:02] temple and there was also this old
[1:01:05] Prophet Simeon that was in the temple
[1:01:08] praise the Lord now so you were realized
[1:01:11] that uh all of these people they have
[1:01:14] their own peculiar
[1:01:17] experience about this child that was
[1:01:21] born so Luke had a very very detailed
[1:01:25] you know he talks very very detail in uh
[1:01:29] in in his
[1:01:31] account
[1:01:32] Mark and uh and John never played around
[1:01:37] you know uh uh uh you know the birth of
[1:01:41] Jesus we know that MK he was burden with
[1:01:45] uh with Jehovah 7 you will realize that
[1:01:48] most of the prophecy that Isaiah spoke
[1:01:51] about Jehovah 7 Mark went in their
[1:01:54] direct
[1:01:56] John on the writing was completely
[1:01:58] different that's what I want for us to
[1:02:00] dwell to tonight and there is a reason
[1:02:03] why we will get to it John on the
[1:02:07] writing was
[1:02:09] influenced by his experience on the
[1:02:12] atland of p on the island of
[1:02:16] pmos John never wrote his account until
[1:02:19] he came back from the island of
[1:02:23] pmos praise the Lord
[1:02:28] amen he never wrote his account until he
[1:02:32] came back from the island of
[1:02:35] pmos now so this introduction that John
[1:02:39] wrote here in the beginning was the word
[1:02:43] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:02:46] was God John took this introduction from
[1:02:50] his experience on the atland of on the
[1:02:53] island of pmos there was something that
[1:02:57] happened and that's what I want for us
[1:03:00] to to uh to follow tonight by the grace
[1:03:03] of God
[1:03:05] Amen because when Moses wrote his
[1:03:08] account he wrote his account from an
[1:03:11] instruction of the Lord From The Vision
[1:03:14] when God took him upon the mountain and
[1:03:17] the 40 days he spent upon the mountain
[1:03:19] God be begin to show Moses by Vision
[1:03:23] what uh uh the the the beginning was
[1:03:28] like you have to know that Moses was was
[1:03:33] landed praise the
[1:03:35] Lord and I believe uh uh he was able to
[1:03:39] to to to take
[1:03:41] notes instructed by the
[1:03:44] Lord as he was showing him everything
[1:03:46] from the
[1:03:49] beginning and because it was a vision it
[1:03:52] was uh there there was there was love
[1:03:54] lot of it that was not tooo
[1:03:58] clear but God gave him an account to let
[1:04:01] us to know how the beginning
[1:04:05] was the creation of the
[1:04:07] word now John says here in the beginning
[1:04:10] was the word the word was with God and
[1:04:14] the Word was God the same was in the
[1:04:18] beginning with God all things were made
[1:04:22] by him and with without him was not
[1:04:26] anything made that was made now let's
[1:04:31] let's let's try to find where John took
[1:04:33] this let's go to the Book of
[1:04:40] Revelation I've been promising you that
[1:04:42] we might we might do a revelation series
[1:04:46] uh I'm I'm still praying about
[1:04:51] it and uh we uh
[1:04:54] might go back and there take the church
[1:04:56] is book take the Book of Revelation and
[1:04:59] just and just read and and uh I think it
[1:05:03] will be good for every one of
[1:05:06] us are we together let's read Revelation
[1:05:09] chapter 1 as we will uh uh uh bring an
[1:05:14] introduction here Revelation CH 1 verse
[1:05:17] one the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ which God gave unto him
[1:05:24] we have gone over this before the
[1:05:27] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:05:30] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:05:34] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:05:38] he sent and
[1:05:40] signified by his Angel unto his servant
[1:05:44] John so we know John who bear record of
[1:05:48] the word of God and of the testimony of
[1:05:51] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[1:05:54] saw so we know that if there is one book
[1:05:59] that Jesus himself wrote is the Book of
[1:06:04] Revelation praise the Lord he is the
[1:06:07] author of the book of Revelation John
[1:06:10] was only his scribe John was told to
[1:06:13] write the things that he saw and the
[1:06:17] things that he heard so John had his
[1:06:21] little book or tablet or whatever it is
[1:06:25] and uh as as he was seeing things he was
[1:06:28] writing it praise the
[1:06:32] Lord and uh uh
[1:06:35] uh so we see
[1:06:38] here that he he he signified by his
[1:06:42] Angel onto his seven
[1:06:45] John John who bear record of the word of
[1:06:48] God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:06:51] and all things that he saw blessed bless
[1:06:54] blessed is he that
[1:06:56] readeth and they that hear the words of
[1:06:59] this prophecy and keep those things
[1:07:01] which are
[1:07:02] written there in for the for for the
[1:07:05] time is at hand John to the seven
[1:07:08] churches which are in Asia Grace be unto
[1:07:12] you John you are instructed to write
[1:07:15] these things and send it to the churches
[1:07:18] that are in
[1:07:22] Asia praise the Lord
[1:07:24] now so we won't have all the time to
[1:07:27] read everything here but that that's a
[1:07:30] place I want to bring you and where I
[1:07:32] want to bring you tonight is for us to
[1:07:34] be able to see that uh John as as as as
[1:07:39] a scribe here writing everything that
[1:07:42] the Lord Jesus is instructing him now
[1:07:45] another thing I want us to also
[1:07:47] underline is that the book started by
[1:07:51] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] and I believe that it's it's it's it's
[1:07:58] using that
[1:08:00] introduction
[1:08:01] because the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[1:08:06] continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:08:08] did not end when he ascended
[1:08:11] up praise the
[1:08:14] lord we know that the ministry of Jesus
[1:08:16] Christ contining in the book of Acts
[1:08:20] with the
[1:08:22] apostles and here we find that the
[1:08:25] revelation of Jesus Christ when I spoke
[1:08:28] on this there in South Africa I entitled
[1:08:30] it the continuation of the revelation of
[1:08:32] Jesus Christ and we are the continuation
[1:08:35] of the revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:38] praise the Lord because that's the
[1:08:40] reason why we are redeemed that's the
[1:08:42] reason why he call us so we can continue
[1:08:46] what uh he's doing in this day are we
[1:08:52] together pray praise the Lord praise the
[1:08:55] Lord amen amen now so you will see here
[1:09:00] that
[1:09:03] John as he's called to do this
[1:09:08] work Jesus one time told the disciples
[1:09:13] we we spoke about that what what what is
[1:09:15] what it is to you that if this man stay
[1:09:18] till I come you know there kind of for
[1:09:21] Romans that went around no John is not
[1:09:23] going to die
[1:09:24] but we know that uh you know Jesus was
[1:09:26] pointing to this time because uh this
[1:09:29] will be the time where John will see the
[1:09:32] coming of the Lord he will see it and he
[1:09:36] will experience the coming of the Lord
[1:09:39] now so we realize here from Revelation
[1:09:41] chapter 1 that John saw Jesus in the
[1:09:46] midst of the seven golden can Stak and
[1:09:48] the Seven golden canle steak is
[1:09:50] representing the seven Church ages
[1:09:55] praise the Lord
[1:09:57] amen so when we say that he's here we
[1:10:00] must believe that he is here because in
[1:10:03] Vision John saw Jesus in his in the
[1:10:07] midst of the
[1:10:09] church praise the
[1:10:12] Lord you know what John remember John
[1:10:15] remember when Jesus said in s John
[1:10:18] chapter 14 I will never leave you I will
[1:10:21] never forsake you in a vision when he
[1:10:25] saw Jesus in the midst of the seven
[1:10:28] golden candle Stak he realized that uh
[1:10:31] uh everything that Jesus said to them
[1:10:34] while he was in the flesh came more real
[1:10:38] to
[1:10:40] John praise the Lord it was more real to
[1:10:44] John in this experience than when Jesus
[1:10:47] was in his physical body walking with
[1:10:50] them on the shore of
[1:10:52] gathering
[1:10:55] praise the Lord I'll show you a few of
[1:10:57] them before we close tonight I think I
[1:10:59] get five minutes to do there five or 10
[1:11:03] minutes I'll try my best now so John saw
[1:11:06] out of that this is where I want to
[1:11:08] bring us tonight as as uh as we will so
[1:11:13] as when John saw Jesus in the midst of
[1:11:16] the seven golden can
[1:11:20] s if you look at chapter 2 that's
[1:11:24] Revelation 2
[1:11:26] verse1
[1:11:29] Jesus is now going to tell
[1:11:35] John to introduce him to all the church
[1:11:40] ages so at at the beginning of every
[1:11:43] Church age Jesus gave his introduction
[1:11:47] he introduced
[1:11:49] himself to the church
[1:11:52] ages praise the
[1:11:54] Lord are we
[1:11:58] together he told John he says unto the
[1:12:01] angel of the Church of Ephesus you must
[1:12:04] write these
[1:12:06] things write these things say he that
[1:12:10] holdeth the Seven Stars let the angel of
[1:12:14] the Church of Ephesus know that the one
[1:12:17] that is sending this message is the one
[1:12:20] that is holding the Seven Stars and the
[1:12:22] Seven Stars are the seven messenger of
[1:12:25] the seven Church
[1:12:27] ages are you seeing the
[1:12:30] picture so when you get to the beginning
[1:12:33] of every Church age age Jesus introduced
[1:12:38] himself said John this is my
[1:12:40] introduction to this church
[1:12:43] age Revelation chapter
[1:12:46] 3 verse
[1:12:48] 14 laisha Church
[1:12:52] age
[1:12:59] unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:13:03] laition right John pick up your pen
[1:13:07] write
[1:13:08] this onto the angel of the laisha church
[1:13:14] age praise the Lord amen send this
[1:13:18] message and let him know who send the
[1:13:22] message
[1:13:24] praise the Lord are we together and then
[1:13:28] in the introduction he was says unto the
[1:13:31] angel of the laisha church write these
[1:13:34] things said their
[1:13:37] amen the one that is bringing the
[1:13:40] message to this church age is the amen
[1:13:43] now he introduced himself to the last
[1:13:47] age as I am the
[1:13:51] finality praise the Lord
[1:13:54] I am the
[1:13:56] amen he could not introduce himself to
[1:13:59] the Ephesian Church age as the
[1:14:04] amen praise the Lord he had to introduce
[1:14:07] himself to the loudish church age
[1:14:10] because that that is the last
[1:14:15] age he introduce himself as the
[1:14:21] amen praise the Lord
[1:14:24] amen these things said the
[1:14:27] amen they
[1:14:29] faithful and Truth
[1:14:34] witness this one that is bringing the
[1:14:37] message this one that is speaking to the
[1:14:39] church
[1:14:40] age he is the
[1:14:42] amen he is their faithful and Truth
[1:14:49] witness then he
[1:14:52] said the
[1:14:54] beginning of the
[1:14:58] creation of
[1:15:00] God Amen praise the
[1:15:04] Lord
[1:15:06] amen now you now you it's it's almost
[1:15:09] like uh you know when you you uh someone
[1:15:13] is dictating and you are writing you
[1:15:15] know uh sometimes you find that you know
[1:15:18] uh uh uh you are preaching and someone
[1:15:20] is interpreting and sometimes they they
[1:15:23] interpreter get very excited because he
[1:15:26] he hears something he wished that he was
[1:15:29] not interpreting because he might go
[1:15:31] running around or rejoicing or maybe
[1:15:34] making note on that thing that he have
[1:15:37] heard praise the Lord John heard Jesus
[1:15:42] introducing himself to our
[1:15:46] age as the amen the truth and faithful
[1:15:51] witness in the beginning beginning of
[1:15:54] the creation of
[1:15:57] God praise the Lord now do you see why
[1:16:01] you see why and where John got his
[1:16:04] introduction as in the beginning was the
[1:16:08] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:16:12] Word was
[1:16:14] God John took it from your
[1:16:17] age he took it from the introduction of
[1:16:20] our
[1:16:21] age he okay when Jesus introduced
[1:16:25] himself to the Lish Church age he
[1:16:28] introduced himself as the beginning of
[1:16:31] the creation of
[1:16:33] God I can just only imagine in my mind
[1:16:37] that when John heard that he made a
[1:16:40] little star over there he said I have to
[1:16:42] look into this I never heard him saying
[1:16:45] this when he was a mon
[1:16:48] Us Praise the
[1:16:51] Lord that he say
[1:16:53] he is the beginning of the
[1:16:58] creation of
[1:17:02] God praise the
[1:17:07] Lord
[1:17:10] amen the beginning of the creation of
[1:17:15] God that's how Jesus introduced himself
[1:17:18] to our age what is
[1:17:20] that the beginning of the creation of
[1:17:25] God not the creation of the
[1:17:29] creatures not God
[1:17:33] creating or the beginning of creation no
[1:17:37] the beginning of the creation of
[1:17:41] God God creating
[1:17:46] himself God gave himself a beginning the
[1:17:50] one that don't have no beginning he's
[1:17:53] giving himself a
[1:17:58] beginning are we together you see that
[1:18:01] is the reason why I'm I'm coming to this
[1:18:04] is is not to be mysterious it's not to
[1:18:07] you know turn your head around your
[1:18:09] shoulder no the reason I'm I'm coming to
[1:18:12] this is even great
[1:18:16] Elohim he gave himself a good
[1:18:21] beginning we wouldn't have had a word
[1:18:25] that is standing like this if God never
[1:18:30] started
[1:18:32] right the beginning of everything is
[1:18:36] very
[1:18:38] important praise the
[1:18:41] Lord
[1:18:43] amen the beginning of
[1:18:46] everything here said the scripture is
[1:18:48] allowing us to know that God
[1:18:50] himself gave himself a
[1:18:54] beginning why because the beginning is
[1:18:57] the
[1:18:58] foundation the beginning is the
[1:19:04] birth praise the
[1:19:07] Lord
[1:19:09] amen and if
[1:19:12] God will start creation if he will if he
[1:19:15] will start anything anything that he he
[1:19:19] in his mind that he hide in his mind to
[1:19:21] express
[1:19:24] for him to start he begin with the word
[1:19:30] hallelujah praise the Lord Brother B
[1:19:34] says if you want to start a church start
[1:19:36] with the
[1:19:37] word you want to start a family begin
[1:19:40] with the
[1:19:43] word that's what he
[1:19:46] said because God
[1:19:48] himself began with the word in the
[1:19:52] beginning was was their
[1:19:54] word praise the Lord is that what the
[1:19:58] scripture says in the beginning was the
[1:20:02] word so God himself begin with the
[1:20:07] word it shows that when we begin with
[1:20:10] the word we never going into
[1:20:12] filise
[1:20:16] God are you getting the
[1:20:19] picture praise the Lord
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:27] that's the beginning of the creation of
[1:20:35] God so when John came back from the
[1:20:38] island of
[1:20:40] pmos and he will start writing his own
[1:20:44] record of all that he experienced with
[1:20:48] Jesus he never started from Bethlehem or
[1:20:52] from Nazareth
[1:20:53] he never started from H A
[1:20:57] Manger he never spoke about the the wise
[1:21:00] man
[1:21:01] nothing John said I heard him saying he
[1:21:05] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:21:10] if I would start my record I would say
[1:21:12] in the beginning was the
[1:21:17] word praise the
[1:21:21] Lord
[1:21:26] John got
[1:21:28] there from Jesus introduction to our
[1:21:34] age the beginning of the creation of God
[1:21:38] what is that what's the meaning of
[1:21:41] that praise the
[1:21:44] Lord
[1:21:47] simple that's what brother bam says the
[1:21:49] Theologian will call the
[1:21:51] logos is the great internal Spirit one
[1:21:54] time he fill all space he fill every
[1:21:59] word but he condemns himself into a body
[1:22:04] called the logos hallelujah
[1:22:07] hallelujah praise the
[1:22:09] Lord
[1:22:12] amen and that was his
[1:22:16] beginning why because he was breaking
[1:22:18] into
[1:22:21] time
[1:22:23] and and anything and everything in time
[1:22:27] has a beginning so if God will come to
[1:22:31] time he has to give himself a
[1:22:37] beginning it was called the lust but it
[1:22:41] had it had a shape it had a
[1:22:44] form what was that
[1:22:47] form see what John said in uh in in in
[1:22:50] St John chapter one
[1:22:53] John saw all of these things in the
[1:22:56] vision St John chapter one whether he
[1:22:59] says all things were made by
[1:23:03] him amen and without
[1:23:07] him was not anything made that was made
[1:23:10] in him was
[1:23:13] life and the life was the
[1:23:19] light so thou bore
[1:23:23] in the beginning was a body of
[1:23:27] light the
[1:23:30] lust it was not a it was not an
[1:23:32] invisible form
[1:23:34] no when God was Spirit he was invisible
[1:23:38] now he's coming to time he had to be
[1:23:42] visible so the lust was a body of
[1:23:48] light are we together
[1:23:51] amen amen
[1:23:55] amen now you will see the importance of
[1:23:58] why that experience in
[1:24:02] Houston the experience that brother
[1:24:04] brandham had in Houston with d
[1:24:09] Bess the picture we have with the pillow
[1:24:12] of fire over brother brandham
[1:24:19] head praise the Lord Paul met the pillar
[1:24:23] of fire on the road of
[1:24:24] Damascus it's only written it's only
[1:24:27] recorded in the
[1:24:28] scripture but God in his Providence
[1:24:32] never allow it to be
[1:24:35] photographed why because Jesus Christ
[1:24:39] introduction to poor age was not the the
[1:24:43] beginning of the creation of
[1:24:47] God the reason why we have that in our
[1:24:51] age is because that's how he introduced
[1:24:54] himself to our
[1:24:59] age praise the Lord that's why brother
[1:25:02] Bram said over and over he says that
[1:25:05] that photo is not about me I just happen
[1:25:08] to be
[1:25:12] there he says that is about the angel of
[1:25:16] the Covenant that led the children of
[1:25:18] Israel and it even goes back to the
[1:25:21] beginning
[1:25:25] he says that logos was a form of an
[1:25:28] amber color
[1:25:31] light that was the form that God took
[1:25:34] from the
[1:25:36] beginning praise the
[1:25:38] Lord do you know what I realized
[1:25:41] recently I realized that the wise men
[1:25:44] were following the pillow of
[1:25:47] fire if you go and stud of the message
[1:25:50] you see many times brother Bram he
[1:25:52] referred to the wise men following the
[1:25:55] same sty he said is that same light that
[1:25:58] led the children of
[1:26:00] Israel hallelujah it's the same pillow
[1:26:03] of
[1:26:04] fire so you see the form that God took
[1:26:07] from the beginning came to identify him
[1:26:11] when he took a body form amen
[1:26:16] amen are we
[1:26:20] together now don't don't don't don't
[1:26:23] don't get carried away with uh with
[1:26:25] everything I'm saying my my emphasis
[1:26:28] here is that if God the great Elohim God
[1:26:32] the great intal
[1:26:35] God the one that had
[1:26:38] no date of
[1:26:42] birth if he would give himself a
[1:26:47] beginning to start
[1:26:49] time think about it now
[1:26:54] that's that's the reason why I feel that
[1:26:57] the thought is
[1:26:58] important to start time to drop into
[1:27:03] time for God to materialize
[1:27:07] himself and start to make things and
[1:27:10] start to create things start to make
[1:27:12] shape and form and all of that for God
[1:27:15] to do
[1:27:18] that he have to have a
[1:27:21] beginning
[1:27:23] the beginning is very
[1:27:25] important how we begin is very
[1:27:32] important praise the
[1:27:36] Lord that was what John captur on the
[1:27:40] island of pmos he saw it that he is the
[1:27:44] beginning of the creation of God that's
[1:27:48] what he said he is the beginning of the
[1:27:52] creation of
[1:27:53] God and John would come and said in the
[1:27:56] beginning what the word the word was
[1:27:59] with God the Word was
[1:28:03] God all things were made by him that's
[1:28:06] verse three let's look into colossian
[1:28:10] chapter
[1:28:12] 1 let's look into the book of colossian
[1:28:14] chapter 1 and see something
[1:28:21] here
[1:28:24] that that will be after your book of
[1:28:44] Philippian lay my Foundation here and
[1:28:46] then I'll start preaching amen now so
[1:28:48] you see over here in Philippian chap I
[1:28:51] mean I Chapter 1 sorry after the book of
[1:28:54] Philippian we read from verse 12 giving
[1:28:57] thanks unto the
[1:28:59] Father which have made us meat to be
[1:29:02] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:29:04] Saints in light who have delivered us
[1:29:07] from the power of darkness and has
[1:29:10] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:29:12] dear son in whom we have the Redemption
[1:29:15] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:29:18] of our sins so we realize that all of
[1:29:21] this he's talking about Jesus Christ are
[1:29:22] we together amen is that right do you
[1:29:26] realize he's talking about Jesus Christ
[1:29:29] amen then he continue on still talking
[1:29:32] about Jesus Christ he said who is the
[1:29:35] image of the invisible
[1:29:38] God the first born of every creature the
[1:29:42] first born is the
[1:29:46] beginning
[1:29:47] so Paul is using the same language
[1:29:52] that John heard
[1:29:54] Jesus introducing
[1:29:58] himself to the laisha church
[1:30:02] age he's using the same
[1:30:06] language let's let's go ahead a little
[1:30:08] bit again and you you will see that he's
[1:30:10] using the same language and and the
[1:30:12] reason why he's he used that same
[1:30:14] language who is the image of the
[1:30:17] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:30:19] creature for by him were all things
[1:30:22] created is it not the same thing that
[1:30:24] John said in St John chapter 1 all
[1:30:28] things were made by him and without him
[1:30:31] was nothing made Paul is saying the same
[1:30:33] thing here Paul was not on the island of
[1:30:36] pmos but Paul saw the pillow of fire on
[1:30:39] the road of
[1:30:44] Damascus praise the Lord and when he saw
[1:30:47] the pillow of fire he said who are thou
[1:30:50] Lord he says I'm Jesus whom you are
[1:30:56] persecuting praise the
[1:31:01] Lord amen oh I have no doubt in my mind
[1:31:06] that Paul from that time he kept asking
[1:31:09] how how how how it say that you are the
[1:31:11] pillow of fire is isn't that the same
[1:31:13] pillow of fire that met Moses in the
[1:31:16] burning
[1:31:17] bush praise the
[1:31:20] Lord I have no doubt in my mind that
[1:31:24] Jesus told him I am the beginning I'm
[1:31:27] the firstborn of every
[1:31:29] creature Hallelujah that's the beginning
[1:31:32] of
[1:31:35] God are we
[1:31:38] together when Moses said in the
[1:31:41] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:31:48] Earth that was the way he saw it in the
[1:31:51] vision
[1:31:55] when the vision got to Paul the vision
[1:31:57] got a little bit more
[1:32:00] clearer then what Moses saw
[1:32:03] it praise the
[1:32:05] Lord
[1:32:07] amen now just just keep in context what
[1:32:11] we're talking about is the
[1:32:13] beginning the important of the beginning
[1:32:18] the important of how we begin our year
[1:32:23] hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen we
[1:32:27] must not begin the year with some
[1:32:30] fale let's begin the year with the
[1:32:33] word hallelujah let's begin the year
[1:32:36] because you see in that beginning the
[1:32:40] beginning of
[1:32:41] God is the beginning of
[1:32:45] Praises because brother brandham said
[1:32:47] when
[1:32:48] God became God
[1:32:53] now he became an object of
[1:32:57] worship praise the Lord amen so let's
[1:33:00] begin with worship that's the reason why
[1:33:03] when Jesus taught the Lord's Prayer he
[1:33:06] said when you prayed said Our Father who
[1:33:10] are in heaven hallow our
[1:33:13] worship you must you must have your
[1:33:15] beginning with worship because the
[1:33:17] beginning of God was the beginning of
[1:33:20] worship
[1:33:23] amen praise the Lord when he began he
[1:33:27] created angels to worship him because
[1:33:29] now he has taken the
[1:33:31] form that he could be
[1:33:35] worshiped praise the
[1:33:38] Lord amen you see that's the reason why
[1:33:42] angels are attracted to the
[1:33:46] word the angels of God they are
[1:33:49] attracted to the word because that was
[1:33:51] the first form that God took he took the
[1:33:54] form of the word called the logos the
[1:33:56] pillow of
[1:33:57] fire it's just language is all the
[1:34:02] same we must not make it
[1:34:06] complicated praise the
[1:34:09] Lord so here is John I mean Paul here
[1:34:12] using the very same language that John
[1:34:15] use who is the image of the invisible
[1:34:18] God the first Bor of every creature by
[1:34:21] him were all things created that is in
[1:34:25] heaven that is in Earth visible h h h
[1:34:28] and and invisible whether they be Throne
[1:34:31] Dominion principality power all things
[1:34:34] were created by Him and for
[1:34:38] him that was the same thing that John
[1:34:40] said in in John
[1:34:43] 1 all things were made by him and
[1:34:46] without him was nothing
[1:34:48] made
[1:34:50] Hallelujah
[1:34:53] praise the Lord amen you see there the
[1:34:55] Alpha and Omega principle H Paul was the
[1:35:00] messenger to the alpha age
[1:35:04] amen John heard the introduction of
[1:35:07] Jesus Christ to the Omega
[1:35:10] age and we are we are the one here to
[1:35:13] witness
[1:35:14] it we are the benefactor of it
[1:35:17] hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen
[1:35:24] the beginning of God is the beginning of
[1:35:26] worship brother Bram say here let me
[1:35:28] read this and and uh then maybe I can
[1:35:32] start preaching or we close either
[1:35:36] one he said here in the
[1:35:39] message uh sep and
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:49] Seed he said talking about when the
[1:35:52] morning start sang together and the sons
[1:35:56] of God shouted for Joy way back before
[1:36:01] the foundation of the world what is the
[1:36:03] foundation the
[1:36:04] beginning right praise the
[1:36:08] Lord
[1:36:10] amen because brother brandham said when
[1:36:13] God took that form all his attribute you
[1:36:17] and myself was represented in that form
[1:36:20] amen amen
[1:36:22] yes why because God was expressing his
[1:36:26] thoughts he was about to express you and
[1:36:30] myself so we condescended with
[1:36:33] God that's why Jesus who said I came
[1:36:36] from God I will go back to
[1:36:39] God he never only came from God When
[1:36:42] when when when he was born by married he
[1:36:45] came from God when God condescended and
[1:36:48] became a body of light and you and
[1:36:51] myself was there God praise the
[1:36:56] lord we condescended with
[1:36:59] him we came from thought form praise the
[1:37:03] Lord you can't remember it that's why
[1:37:04] you looking at me like that that's okay
[1:37:07] praise the
[1:37:10] Lord that's okay brother bam said what
[1:37:13] happened he says that was the very same
[1:37:16] time when God took that
[1:37:19] expression then you you and myself as
[1:37:22] sons of
[1:37:24] God we shouted for
[1:37:27] Joy praise the Lord amen
[1:37:32] amen and that is the reason why every
[1:37:36] time the word is expressed in truth it
[1:37:39] must bring us a sense of
[1:37:42] Joy because that was our first
[1:37:48] expression a child of God that was
[1:37:51] expressed from the mind of God you
[1:37:54] cannot be offended at the word whether
[1:37:57] the word call your name whether the word
[1:37:59] correct
[1:38:01] you praise the Lord the only attitude
[1:38:05] that you express in the beginning was to
[1:38:08] Rejoice was to shout hallelujah praise
[1:38:12] the Lord amen amen and brother Bram said
[1:38:15] yeah he said when the morning star sang
[1:38:19] together and the son of God shout for
[1:38:22] Joy way back before the foundation of
[1:38:24] the word how do we know that wasn't that
[1:38:28] wasn't at the same
[1:38:31] time that the lamb was
[1:38:36] slain that when God in his great
[1:38:39] thinking seing us shouting and
[1:38:43] rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus
[1:38:49] Christ praise the Lord
[1:38:57] it is it's only the last day spirit that
[1:39:00] can freeze us up from rejoicing in the
[1:39:04] word praise the Lord
[1:39:07] amen but as more as we come to this
[1:39:10] reality to know that we're not just
[1:39:13] finding ourself here in church we came
[1:39:16] in the condensation of
[1:39:18] God as God was making himself known
[1:39:23] expressing himself in types and Shadow
[1:39:26] you and myself we were condescending
[1:39:28] with
[1:39:30] him hallelujah praise the
[1:39:33] Lord hallelujah amen that's the reason
[1:39:37] why Jesus can you imagine Jesus was
[1:39:40] telling his disciple don't
[1:39:43] Rejoice because demons has been cast out
[1:39:47] or you healed the sake he said Rejoice
[1:39:50] because your name is in in the book all
[1:39:52] those join every one of them there just
[1:39:56] saying what name in the book praise the
[1:39:58] Lord he never understood it until on the
[1:40:02] island of
[1:40:04] pmos on the island of
[1:40:06] pmos when he broke into the into the
[1:40:09] vision of Revelation chapter 5 who is
[1:40:12] wored to take the book and to lose the
[1:40:15] seals thereof amen praise the Lord even
[1:40:19] when Jesus said it that they none of
[1:40:21] them I
[1:40:23] mean I mean that's that's that's a thing
[1:40:25] that excite the people today we want
[1:40:27] some kind of a manifestation oh yeah you
[1:40:30] know go God healed say hallelujah praise
[1:40:32] the Lord but yeah when the truth of the
[1:40:34] word is preached the El it respond to
[1:40:37] the truth of the
[1:40:40] word praise the lord we rejoice in the
[1:40:45] word because that's where we find Our
[1:40:47] Truth
[1:40:49] identification
[1:40:54] Hallelujah are we together
[1:41:00] am you see the the the impact of the
[1:41:05] vision the impact of the
[1:41:09] vision when brother bam was preaching a
[1:41:11] lot of these things during his
[1:41:15] ministry it did not impact to the
[1:41:19] people he was talking about I mean we
[1:41:22] are we are living in a a netic age and
[1:41:26] man is going to go crazy and uh you know
[1:41:29] the uh uh uh uh the people that are
[1:41:31] going to go you know be losing their
[1:41:33] mind he's talking about uh the drug
[1:41:36] world and and and and and and the kind
[1:41:39] of evil spirit and the sex spirit that
[1:41:41] will come upon the word and and and I
[1:41:43] mean all of those things that were just
[1:41:45] like I mean this William brandham you
[1:41:47] pray for the sick I mean you are just
[1:41:49] shouting at people all the time time
[1:41:51] they they kept thinking about it like
[1:41:53] that but now you and
[1:41:55] myself we are seeing the reality of what
[1:41:58] he spoke Hallelujah because he was
[1:42:00] speaking on a
[1:42:02] vision a prophet preached on a
[1:42:06] vision praise the Lord and when we see
[1:42:10] those things then it hit our mind oh
[1:42:13] yeah well that's that's what that's why
[1:42:14] the message says he said those things
[1:42:16] many years
[1:42:18] back that Jesus there telling all of
[1:42:21] this St John chapter uh 24 Jesus told
[1:42:24] them and said there will be false Christ
[1:42:29] and false
[1:42:30] prophets many will come in my name and
[1:42:33] say and say having you know they will
[1:42:36] prophesy they would do many Jesus told
[1:42:38] them all of that it never affected
[1:42:41] John until he got the
[1:42:46] vision when he got the vision of
[1:42:49] Revelation
[1:42:51] then over
[1:42:52] in first
[1:42:56] John he said little children you have
[1:42:59] heard that the Antichrist will come let
[1:43:03] me tell you he's not coming he's already
[1:43:07] here why he was speaking from a
[1:43:10] vision but Jesus told them that when
[1:43:13] Jesus was in his physical body they
[1:43:16] couldn't grab
[1:43:19] it they never hon to
[1:43:22] it but when John experienced it on the
[1:43:26] island of pmos he saw the Beast Spirit
[1:43:29] he saw Revelation chapter 13 He Saw
[1:43:32] Revelation chapter 17 he saw Revelation
[1:43:34] chapter
[1:43:35] 18 he saw all those things in the
[1:43:38] vision when he came back to the church
[1:43:42] he said little
[1:43:44] children the Antichrist is not something
[1:43:47] to
[1:43:48] come it's already here
[1:43:52] is the spirit that will deny you of
[1:43:56] Christ coming in your
[1:44:00] flesh because he said every spirit that
[1:44:03] do not confess that Jesus has come in
[1:44:05] the flesh is not of God is of the
[1:44:09] Antichrist praise the
[1:44:12] Lord you know the way the church word
[1:44:15] interprets
[1:44:17] that they say oh if you did not believe
[1:44:20] that Jesus Jesus Christ came then you
[1:44:22] that's that's the Antichrist that's not
[1:44:24] what John
[1:44:26] said because when Jesus was here it was
[1:44:29] not Jesus In the
[1:44:31] Flesh it was God In the
[1:44:36] Flesh when Jesus was here it was the
[1:44:39] fullness of God in flesh Jesus in the
[1:44:43] flesh is the
[1:44:48] church Christ in you the hope of
[1:44:52] glory that's Jesus In the
[1:44:55] Flesh so John is saying from his
[1:44:58] experience on the island of pmos that if
[1:45:01] you are not confessing daily that it is
[1:45:04] no longer I that live but Christ live in
[1:45:07] me if you are not confessing that and
[1:45:09] you are only confessing I'm weak I'm
[1:45:12] lazy oh the
[1:45:14] devil John is saying you are under an
[1:45:17] influence of the
[1:45:19] Antichrist
[1:45:21] you must be confessing every day through
[1:45:24] your tough battle oh greater is he that
[1:45:27] is in me that he that is in the word is
[1:45:30] no longer I that live but Christ that
[1:45:32] liveth in
[1:45:37] me John said if you not confessing there
[1:45:40] you under an antichrist
[1:45:45] influence that is the impact of the
[1:45:48] vision that's the reason why I said on
[1:45:50] tell this word impact
[1:45:54] us it's not just to know the quot and
[1:45:57] know the story about the message but the
[1:46:00] purpose of the word is to affect our
[1:46:03] life it affected John so much that when
[1:46:07] he came
[1:46:08] back his story was completely different
[1:46:12] he could not talk like the rest of the
[1:46:14] disciple they were talking about oh we
[1:46:16] were on the sea of gilee oh we were on
[1:46:19] this sea of G he said no my people no
[1:46:23] what I saw on the island of
[1:46:25] pmos that man that was with us the
[1:46:28] messages he preached to
[1:46:31] Us Praise the Lord we were all looking
[1:46:34] for The Healing Ministry we were just
[1:46:36] only interested when he was Healing The
[1:46:38] Sick but the words that he spoke to
[1:46:48] us John got and A New
[1:46:53] Beginning he got a very new beginning he
[1:46:57] was impacted by the
[1:47:02] vision he could no longer Trace himself
[1:47:06] back to the days of Galilee to the
[1:47:09] fishing trips and and and and all of
[1:47:12] those stories he could not Trace himself
[1:47:14] back to it because say he was caught in
[1:47:16] the
[1:47:19] vision
[1:47:29] praise the
[1:47:33] Lord I'll tell you Happy New Year
[1:47:36] again happy New
