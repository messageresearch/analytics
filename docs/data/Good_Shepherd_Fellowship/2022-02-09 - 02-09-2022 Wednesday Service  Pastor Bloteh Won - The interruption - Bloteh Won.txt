do sing a song that's what i wanted to start from tonight but we will have our seat we wax uh the things back there we will play the uh revelation chapter 9 we will read the entire chapter together through an audio reading and then we will get right into what we want to share with you tonight if the lord as we trust the lord to help us god bless you musicians that will be all for the music sorry i wanted to grab something and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh the man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions and they had breast plates as it were breast plates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jason and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tales were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts i want to want to kind of share something with you uh it taught for us to read through revelation chapter nine just to kind of for give you uh an idea of where i want to go tonight or what i want to point out what i want for us to see now in the uh revelation chapter 9 kind of have a description yet of of different beasts out of the bottomless pit come the locusts and these locals having you know power and different forms on the figured year we all know that uh you know these are uh demon powers you know because uh uh solomon said in the book of proverbs that the locals do not have kings you know he says the locals do not have kings but yet you know they are very uh they travel in order they don't have a king set over them but yet these locals here over in revelation chapter 9 has a king you know so it is not a natural locus this is uh this is a spirit that is that is described praise the lord now uh uh let's uh i want to read something from uh from the book of dania praise the lord daniel chapter 10 i actually brought my my coffee bible because i was i was looking at something and i thought i was going to you know kind of forget uh uh the picture for you and then and then kind of for sure out to you now when you look in the bulk of down here you realize that in the similar way that john is seeing this dania also had an experience praise the lord you realize that from down here chapter 10 to the closing chapter of daniel god was going to revert to down here the things concerning his people and the things concerning the end what was going to happen uh that we that that that is you know term as the seventh week of daniel god was going to revert it to dany and we all know that it was in this period of time that daniel had you know uh [Music] this experience of an angel coming to his rescue after spending you know uh spending many days before the lord and uh uh an angel telling daniel from the very day that you altered your voice you know i was on my way but the prince of peshawar held me back and and he had to fight that now so uh the picture here that we're trying to bring to you or that i really want you to for us to see tonight is uh you know just like brother brandon said back there in uh and he said you know uh out the only future that we can look forward to is the coming of the lord that does not means that we shouldn't go to school and we shouldn't play in our life praise the lord but he led us to know that the word government is going to just go bad and worse and worse and worse there is nothing of this word that you can expect you know that is going to get better praise the lord and so i'm caught up in a torch here and and that's that's what i want to show but uh uh let's start up here and trust that the grace of god will be able to help us praise the lord brother branham said in the message how can i overcome and and he said i want to start with this quote he said now i choose this because i think that it is a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die praise the lord and just like i said on sunday i don't know about you but i believe that uh i've been having a revival i believe that uh we are having the revival praise the lord when the word is beginning to come and and we are beginning to get conscious of ourselves and and look at ourselves in the mirror of god's word and ask god for grace in era of our life that is a revival praise the lord amen is not under the term uh that the church would call revival where we would put big billboards out and we would we would spread flyers around the community and and you know and and invite people to come but when we start to look at ourselves and say lord i need more of you amen i need you to help me in this area of my life i need to get closer to you i want to stop my lying i want to stop my cheating lord i just i just need you and that that is a revival so he says he was talking on this subject how can i overcome he says i choose it because i think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die we have got to keep in revival constantly revive every day paul said he had to die darling that christ could live and we must never let that revival die in us amen we must never let the spirit of revival died we must never get to the place where we think that uh we don't need god amen we we we need him we need more of god praise the lord so as he talks on this subject and he's actually bringing a form of teaching to the church he was going to teach on something he felt like he was not ready so he took this subject and he started bringing it to the church and and there are some few things that he talks about that we will look into but uh let's go back to revelation revelation chapter we read revelation chapter 9 let's go to revelation chapter 10. praise the lord now you read revelation chapter 9 just like we did the audio reading you realize that it runs right into chapter 10 and it's and it starts wave and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close with a clown and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as a pillow of fire now john year is seen uh the great plague that brother branham will explain to us that under the sixth seal he's seeing the plague coming upon the word okay and and and right in that time that he's seen it something happened there is like an interruption revelation chapter 10 is actually an interruption to to to this time of joshua that is uh at a time of judgment or the time of plague that is coming upon the word now you watch now if you realize you read revelation uh uh chapter 10 the entire chapter john goes from uh uh we will call it uh verse one he says and i saw verse two and he verse verse three uh and cry with a live voice verse four and and you will realize all through the entire chapter chapter every verse is a conjunction unless verse 7. every verse is a conjunction he goes to end and and and and and but then when he gets to verse seven he says but praise the lord in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound praise the lord i i pray that that the law will will help us to to be able to grab what we want to bring tonight to you now so you see here that uh you know the the uh uh the the original strips of the bible we know it was a straw that rose won into other is the scholars that that gave us a book and broke it into chapter now so uh uh if you if you if you have his coffee bible you can look at that when you get home you realize that scuffy when he wrought his on the bible when it gets to chapter 10 he says it's a parenthesis he says chapter 10 is a parenthesis which means we are in this time where the plagues are falling but something comes on the scene some things happen southern amen praise the lord now that they are they have you you'll find this all over in the bible i spoke on the one time i would do do a review you will realize that over in the book of genesis the bible is talking about jacob and his sons and then how how they saw their brother and and and and joseph is about to go to egypt but suddenly right in between there in that story nowhere appeared the story of tema sure amen it's talking about how the rubin and the uh uh jacob songs they saw their brother the the ishmael and i carry him and the story is going on but right in the midst of the story of joseph going to egypt right in the middle comes the story of uh uh judah and tema praise the lord and every time is is i mean it's it's just like that okay you find it all you find it all alone you even see it in jesus ministry praise the lord he's going to to uh to uh uh uh he get a call to go to jairus daughter house because a little girl has died and on his role to jairus house come a woman with a blood issue from nowhere and interrupt his travel now brother branham is going to talk about the interruption that's that's what i want to get to tonight that's what i want to get to tonight so i think i think by the grace of god i've i've got your attention so i think we we we get a picture of what we want to talk about so you see here in chapter nine it talks about it starts off with the fifth angel and and it's it is talking about all of these uh brother branham called it under the sixth heal he says these are all about the plex the judgment that is going to come upon the word you know where he says uh it's right on the revelation chapter 9 he says there was there will be sicknesses where doctors will have no kill praise the lord because uh uh under revelation chapter 9 that's what the bible says in those days men shall seek death and they shall not find it praise the lord and and and all of these things you know and and it is going to be you know is we are going to go from one thing to another so don't get troubled and when he says oh another variant of coronavirus has come up again oh don't get troubled about it it should not trouble you praise the lord amen it should not trouble you don't get afraid and says oh i mean when would this thing finish amen god knows exactly what he's doing amen now so as you as you see the scene well what i want to i want to bring to you tonight as we are looking at it closely as you see the scene what happened here is the other uh uh let me let me do something there was something i wanted to bring out of the bulk of uh [Music] down here let me just are we together now brother branham in the church age one thing he make us to understand is the other uh uh the church ages overlaps right okay brett branham help us to understand that the church ages overlap now so uh there's a period of time but there is in one sense there is no there is no definite time praise the lord because just at the end of one church age another messenger is rising on the scene praise the lord now that that is that is a principle that is a principle it's not just a saying it's a principle because the age ages overlaps yes okay also he said uh in this how can i overcome a message also he says now the laodicea church age that's the last church age there's going to be some overcomers in there do you feel like you are one of them praise the lord amen someone you feel like you are one of them okay there's going to be some overcomer in their watch year watching now he says watch so watch they remember each church age the one preceding it inherits praise lord this is also a principle one age overlapping into another age is the principle as the same year are we together each church age the one preceding it inherit all that the other one offer the good and the bad praise the lord amen now if you go back to to daniel chapter nine i believe so uh where he where he had that their vision you realize that the uh the the angel told him uh uh uh i fought with uh the the prince of pressure okay and he says i have to go back because the prince of gracias is coming now and it will take many years before the the the greeks empire or whatever time their period will come praise the amen he's he's just he's he's in that battle but yet he's telling uh danny i have to go back because just after this one there is another one we have to fight every kingdom brings its battle praise the lord is just like with the believer's life when you get from one thing another one stats there is no dual moment in the believer's life praise the lord when you get from one thing another thing comes on you know if it is not this it is that it's either this or that it's either all the time is this and that praise the lord so brother branham says here remember each age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offer wash up year now and it's after they done receiving all this power these new names and and and everything written that he promised and uh eat the heating manner now so in in context here he's he's talking about the promises okay in in context what he's talking about is that this loudly should age we we we inherit all the blessing of all the ages praise the lord just as also we inherit all the devil of all the ages have come and settled down here are we together praise the lord now okay now so we uh uh we will realize here with our subject over in revelation uh scripture over in revelation chapter nine going to revelation chapter 10 what we want to deal with brother brahm talks a little bit about it here in the sixth seal he says now he says we find out now john said i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal there was an earthquake then all nature was interrupted amen as we really read down you realize that brother branham says this is the sexu is the interruption of all things but we have to realize that god some of the finest moment where god comes on the scene is in the interruption that's what revelation 10 is praise the lord with me he says the sixth year there was there was an earthquake then all nature was interrupted see god god been doing great things like healing the sick and opening the eyes of the blind and doing great work but we found out here that nature took a tumble praise the lord amen god was about to reveal to dania just like i said the seventh week concerning his people and even the time of the end but right in the midst of that there was a spiritual wall that was going on i mean daniel was praying but there was wars that were going on in the heavens praise the lord and then little dania will come to know that from the day that he set his face his heart to pray his prayer has already ascended up but there were just spiritual powers that was warring against him it was not church members it was demon forces people it's not church members amen it's not people in your household it's demon powers praise the lord but goes on he says what is it he says what can bring these things but the word what can make these things to happen praise the lord he says but the word they can do they can do nature any way they want to year is hey they are they they are the the one who bring on the sex seal they uncover and and open it up is the power of god to interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature praise the lord so if if if we think if the scientists think they have figured out what is going on they have no idea if they think that they have faith we finally know i was reading one report came out of israel this is uh uh uh uh you know uh uh uh vitamin d deficiency you know uh uh are the worst people that uh you know that that are affected by kova i mean all sorts of things praise the lord lord church we are getting ready to get out of here amen praise the lord that's there's a there's a power that is coming to sweep god's people out i hope you are watching just like elisha was watching amen praise the lord hallelujah now so brother branham says the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature praise the lord but you will realize that the the seventh seal is spoke about in revelation chapter eight i mean uh sorry revelation uh yeah that's word uh revelation chapter 10 8 praise the lord so you see that why these interruptions and why all of these judgments are going on and the different things that revelation chapter 9 described right in the midst of that and martial in your step on the scene praise the lord right in the midst of all of those confusion and and all of them you know and all of the you know uh uh like brother branham who says hydrosites that will be coming on the earth and men will be going neurotics and all you know losing their mind and doing things right in the midst of that you see that's the reason why this rapture is going to take place and the world will know nothing about it because i mean these things are just going to be pouring down and pouring down and pouring down and the people that spend all their time in in uh you know feeling their minds off of the media and all the negative things that is out there praise the lord they will just be sweep away into some kind of a fear and you know just be so scary because these things are spirit everything that is described here in revelation chapter 9 they are spirits the rapture is going to be one of the the biggest interruption that will take place amen praise the lord because in the twinkling of an eye we'll be out of here let's go a little bit here now i'm grabbing my thoughts a little little by little he says there you are now turn right over turn right over here to the pledge and see all nature interrupted in the sixth place or the sixth hill open now verb is preaching the message look after he preached the seals he's going to also make emphasis on that he said i just finished a series of services on the last seven seal and finding that in the sixth seal that there's a great interruption in nature the moon the stars uh the earth bleached forth and he says the church is porsche israel is parched and everything is pushed under the seventh seal amen so that the millennium can step in there has to be a cleansing first praise the lord and that's what and and that's what the church today that's what i want to point you to that we need a cleansing before anything can be gained from god we have got to have a pausing praise the lord and and and that's the revival that is going on praise the lord he says is to keep that revival in us praise the lord and when we look and see things that is now under the present condition existing in the way they are we can see that we have got to have something happen before god can continue his program and approaching praise the lord now so uh uh so you see here over in in revelation chapter 10 right in the midst of all of this things that are happening john said and i saw the mighty angel that stepped down praise the lord now so you see it ties in with what paul said about the rapture the lord himself shall descend amen with a shout the voice of the eyed angel and the trump of god we know and brother branham says he did the three as he was descending praise the lord amen he did the three in his descending so what i wanted to bring to you tonight is to see that is is to be able to see god in the interruption when things looks like it don't make sense when it looks like it's completely out of order and you cannot get a hold of it there's a mighty injury that is descending oh praise the lord oh man praise the lord can i preach tonight do i have time to preach amen when it looks like oh i can bring i can just bring some beautiful story out of the bible remember jesus was preaching and maybe praying for the sake of preaching you know he was in in the house and and and uh you know and these guys wanted to bring their their their friend to the meeting you know everywhere jesus was there was there was just so much crowd praise the lord i like the way someone said it he says that even the message jesus was preaching was not even recorded we didn't know what he was saying the only thing was recorded was the interruption these guys were over the roof removing the building i mean removing the roof because they want to bring their friend down for jesus to pray praise the lord and he please god not to give us the message that jesus was preaching but to recall the interruption in his bible praise the lord what a day what a time that we are living in how god will hide himself in the foolish things praise the lord paul says in the foolish things the things that do not make sense that god will want to save an entire generation but then ask noah to build a boat praise the lord he's going to save an entire generation he says oh all flesh has come to his end my spirit will no longer strive with men praise the lord i brought bran who talks about the the the signs that they had in those days and they could throw whatever they could throw to the to i mean to the to the moon and realize there is nothing like water that what what is this god saying well yet god would take the foolish thing of the word he would take a man if you are saying that there will be rain for 40 days and 40 nights a boat will be the safest place are you trying to tell us it does not make sense noah praise the lord amen god will send a man down to egypt to bring his people out and the only thing that he would give him is a stake in his hand praise the lord and that's the reason why moses get right there before pharaoh and throw the stake down they just hasted their teeth is that all you have just let my people go that you came shouting through this place is that all you have praise the lord is that all you have james and jim bruce come come and show this man it's just a cheap magic that he has but that man went into the presence of the almighty god praise the lord and you see the strange thing about it or the wonderful thing about it is that there was nobody there to take to record it on their phone nobody had a recording effect praise the lord those are some other things that are difficult to believe there is no there is no scientific evidence you don't have a picture and you're telling us that you met god in the form of a pillar of fire you are saying that a king swore came in your hands praise the lord you said an angel met you in the cave who was there do you have an audio recording praise the lord amen i mean even even all the others of of uh of israel that went with moses charging themselves up when they got bearing and then uh you know and moses threw the stake on the ground it turned to separating and and pharaoh and all his men started to laugh i can see all of those guys calling in dayton this guy he just want for them to punish us this was the same god that increased our burden he has come back again praise the lord those were believers so people are supposed to be saying come on moses preach they are sitting in the seat of scum for hasting their teeth he just he's just bringing trouble on us praise the lord but pretty soon to watch moses stick swallowing the stake of jameson gembros praise the lord and watch him picking it all back and walking out of pharaoh palace with james and jambo seven in moses hands praise the lord god use the foolish things his ways are past fanning out praise the lord his ways are past finding out all of these men have you know they have left their career left the syndicates and the the the the different organization and uh to follow this new message or new ministry this guy that john had just introduced as the lamb of god they were enjoying all the different meetings that were happening praise the lord but yet jesus left them and then he will come you know to to his disciples i mean you would think that he should try to make it easy for these guys to continue to follow him he should try to make it easy and i mean he should preach messages that should just be reasonable because i mean they were unlearned people but he coming in and and he looks like a ghost on the on on the seed and the wind and the wave their boats is all turning over god is in the interruption that's the reason why this message will never make sense praise the lord it will never make sense to the intellectual it will never make sense to the people that want to reason it out because god sent it to catch your people away praise the lord you realize that sometimes it's in some of the the the the greatest interruption of your life where god becomes so real to you all we think about it the mighty angel comes down right in the midst of the interruptions the earthquake the deaths the scorpion bites and everything that is happening is right in that time that the mighty angel comes down with one fault on the lane and one foot on the sea praise the lord i have few minutes left let me get back to some of my notes since you want me to preach praise the lord you know i was listening to uh listening to the prophet and studying a little bit and i got i got caught up in this thought and i thought i'd just share it with you tonight if the lord gave us grace on sunday we will we preach more on that but just for us to be able to see the other uh the time that we are living in and the things that are happening around us praise the lord amen and that's the reason why i encourage you to appreciate the grace and the way that god is dealing with you personally the way god is making himself real to you and the way he's speaking to your heart and opening your understanding to the word and he's helping you in the different areas of your life because uh uh this this is the move of god that's that's the way that god did with men through all the ages praise the lord amen that was how he did with men through all the ages and and the ones that were able to to uh uh uh uh uh train himself to listen to the voice of god and and train themselves to be able to listen to that small voice and bring the the you know uh uh their body in obedience to god's word pretty soon uh uh they started experiencing more of god in their lives you have to remember that abraham the father of faith he was not born in the faith he was born by by parents that were that were idol worshipers but abraham said he heard the voice of god how did he heard it how did he heard it how was he able to distinguish that this is the voice of god from the rest of everything that he was hearing there was something convincing to his heart that i need to get out of here that i need to get out of here where am i going he don't know but there was just a press on his heart something that just keeps repeating and every time it repeats it's more louder it's more convincing it's more striking to him yes he can get it off his mind praise the lord and when he obeyed that voice then the next time the law spoke to him he can now connect him with the voice that brought him out of his father's house to realize that this is the same voice that i heard he was not born in the message his father was another worshiper bible says the way god dared with the father of faith that's the way he deals with all the seeds of abraham praise the lord that's the time that we aim we'll have all of these things happening don't be surprising tomorrow if they put something else on the news praise the lord and to just just to realize how demonic this thing these things are and the way they are plaguing people's mind so there's there's a new violence and and 5 million people going to die how how did they know how did they know how did they came with that estimation of the people that would die but it's a message of fear praise the lord verb talks about listening to the devil listening to the devil lies it's a message of fear it's it's it's armor and spirit yes you have to know that the uh the last house rather it's a pure house is is is an angel of death it's all to plague the people's minds and just make them hopeless oh i mean they just said i'm going to quit my job i would just stay home and and and then pretty soon you stay home you become depressed because you are just glued to the to the television praise the lord now i'm not you you know what i'm going with this amen i'm not trying to braid a a radical group that said we don't believe in anything called coronavirus that's that's not where i'm going with this praise the lord where i'm going with this is that the the media don't have our lives amen god has our lives and we must listen to god we must obey god's word he tells us to respect the authority we respect the authority media does not determine our future because our future is the rapture is being determined by god since we are right in that moment we are right in that cycle praise the lord when when when israel was was uh in india time of an exeter i got to close this thing there was something that just kept bugging my mind to get to talk about but i realized that we are out of time tonight so uh when when israel was i mean there was they were india time of an exit i mean all of these things were happening the plagues were happening you know all they said there was frog and man they said there's frog all over the time and and the next day the news came out again they said there was fleet all over the time and i mean it was just happening from one from one thing to another praise the lord but in gushing the mighty angel came down and there was light in goshen praise the lord and he had to go through all of that are we together if we are together let's start with the word praise the lord let's stay with the world for those that are with us and more than them that are against us praise the lord we can hold to his promises his word never fail praise the lord brother branham says we can look through history and see that the people that god has made himself real tall were the people that stay with his word the people that took god at his word praise the lord it's recorded that uh uh in the roman empire there's a this uh that's uh this guy that did a very good exposition and uh i was i was i was listening to a very wonderful exposition and he gathered from different sources and and these people they were not even christians they were just historian like that gave a different view of what you know uh uh the thoughts about jesus the way people taught about jesus and it's it's so it's so amazing when you when you when you you look through that you realize that uh even during the roman empire they were they were so amazed because of all of uh the the the press that they pulled on the christians and the way they deprived them praise the lord they had the lowest form of life praise the lord most of them were slaves they were slaves saying that and and uh uh i mean they were they were living in the ghetto of ancient rome praise the lord but rome was so surprised to see how the christians that was the thing that was that was buffering their mind how are these people they are able to take care of the widows the fatherless because i mean there was just a great great abuse roman had a power i mean uh they had a whether it was a policy or the way they believe you know uh what the thing about uh uh you know uh a woman and and and all of that i mean there was just a lot of abuse taking place but it was completely different these believers came out you see just like how it is recorded in the book of us that was the reason why they choose those seven men because it started having all of these people coming you know uh uh uh women uh children that didn't have parents you know their parents were killed or something like that but the the elder church in the kind of a paul and law state that they were living praise the lord in rome it was it was known among them even at a time where they were experiencing something like we are experiencing today epidemic praise the lord those christians that were living in the slum in the ghetto of rome it was almost like they were in gushing because they were able to take care of the ones that were safe they were able and and it is not because they had you know smart knowledge or good medicine but it is all because of the prayers and the presence of god that was among those people they knew that their life was just at the mercy of their owners they were living at the mercy of those people that was their slave master they could beat them by any time abuse them and kill them at any time praise the lord and you can just imagine brett brown gave us a picture of dad teaching to moses he says aaron amram will come from work with his back bleeding after being whipped he would come home have a little to eat he would slip away into his attic and start to cry to god and start to cry to god but branham said from one man a revival starts to break home starts to pray then people start to cry god send us a deliverer sent us a deliverer prayer was the weapon of the early church they spend time with god praise the lord the early church spend time with god the people the church prospered the early church started getting weak when constantine stepped in because he was not a believer all he wanted to do he wanted to have favor with those early christians that was living in islam he wanted them to support him never wanted them to rebel against his rulership so he left he said oh i'm a christian now i'm going to build you people a beautiful church that's where the church started to slack now the people have church pews where they can come and sit they come and sleep when they never have church building in their little slum they were on fire for god praying almighty god when there was one that was sick they never had access to all the big hospitals they had to pray for god to come on the scene i wanted the prophet god said it he said new church make the people statue praise the lord and pretty soon they start becoming stylish their worship and their walk and their prayers everything now starts stepping out of order praise the lord since this is our time this is our age this is our hour that we are living in if you have not uh come to the place to really appreciate what has been given to us call the message of the hour you're just wasting your time hanging around because it's not helping you it's not helping you musicians you can come we trust the lord if he continues to lead us that way we will speak revelation chapter 10 on sunday but i just wanted to see i just wanted you to for us to see how god works in the interruption of our lives praise the lord you have to realize the other

know why you know i should be saving the lord and stealing myself from from from the word and out of is lost and all of these things i'm consecrating myself but it looks like things just happening don't look at the things that are happening look for the appearance of the mighty angel because god never failed praise the lord he never failed he interrupted the heat for the hebrew boys he interrupted the heat [Music] when he thought it was throwing them in a furnace of fire it was looking like a wind bath because the mighty angel came down he interrupted the lion the lions was about to
