[1:17] brother daniel jr have a testimony
[1:20] brother you're welcome
[1:24] [Applause]
[1:33] god bless you saints
[1:36] yeah i just wanted to give president
[1:38] thanks to god today for
[1:40] all the obstacles he has saved me from
[1:43] and the one that he just saved me from
[1:45] as well again
[1:47] growing up
[1:48] i was not living the type of path in my
[1:50] life that i should have been living
[1:52] and throughout it i caught a lot of
[1:54] cases in my life from the cases in my
[1:56] life
[1:57] from the things that i was going about
[1:59] doing
[2:00] and through it all
[2:03] god gave me mercy on each and every one
[2:05] of them
[2:07] each and every one of them like
[2:10] i would be sitting down sometimes in
[2:11] jail and selling something with somebody
[2:13] and would be like what was your charge
[2:15] i'll go about explaining it to him and
[2:17] he'll just look at me and go like man
[2:19] you shouldn't even be here right now you
[2:20] should just went straight down for that
[2:23] i'll be like man it's all presents to
[2:24] god for real like when you really want
[2:26] to look at it
[2:28] and it's like
[2:29] my last case that i just recently went
[2:31] through
[2:32] it's so amazing how god worked
[2:34] in that situation
[2:36] because it's like
[2:38] what i got convicted for this thomas
[2:41] like could have really affected
[2:42] something that i'm on probation for in
[2:43] the past right now
[2:45] if certain things would have happened
[2:48] but
[2:49] i'm going through each and everything
[2:50] i'm going through and i'm asking god to
[2:53] please see me through the police help me
[2:54] through this situation and please
[2:56] to please help me to stay on this new
[2:58] path that he he has for me that i'm
[3:01] trying to continue to live
[3:03] and court's coming up so i asked god the
[3:05] day before court and even beforehand
[3:07] when i'm still praying i asked god when
[3:09] i go to court can he please be the judge
[3:11] can he please be the jury could he
[3:13] please be the bailiff can he please be
[3:15] the prosecutor the defense attorney all
[3:17] of them
[3:18] for no man's willingness to be done but
[3:20] his will and his will to be final
[3:23] so i go in there and there was a deal
[3:26] that i was supposed to be getting
[3:28] and everything seemed like that's what
[3:29] was supposed to happen when i went back
[3:31] to course i was just ready for it to be
[3:33] all over and this is my last case that
[3:35] i'm going through my last and final case
[3:37] so i'm just ready for it to be done
[3:40] i went there the defense attorney that
[3:43] was representing me has said
[3:45] that the person who i'm in the case with
[3:48] does not want me to get the departure
[3:50] that we had just came from talking about
[3:52] the last time a departure meaning
[3:53] probation so once i get probation
[3:56] in a sense the case is over i just have
[3:58] to stay law and everything is completely
[4:00] fine i don't have to go do any form of
[4:02] jail time or anything like that
[4:05] god given me mercy
[4:07] so he told me that the person who i was
[4:09] in the case with does not want me to go
[4:11] about getting the departure and that
[4:12] they just want me to see it through and
[4:14] for everything just to go about
[4:15] happening the way it's supposed to
[4:17] happen and i told them that's not what
[4:18] we talked about the last time like
[4:20] things not seeming right this this now
[4:22] we kept going back and forth
[4:24] and then he had told me you know what
[4:27] that is what had happened but it's like
[4:29] this or you could try a straight plea a
[4:31] straight plea is when you just plead
[4:33] guilty to each and every charge that you
[4:35] had and just leave it up to the judge to
[4:36] make the decision for you on how he
[4:38] wants to go about handling it if he
[4:40] wants to give you a departure or if he
[4:43] wants to
[4:44] say no and just have you see the whole
[4:45] entire case through and i'm over here
[4:48] still trying to go back and forth with
[4:49] the public defender and they hit me and
[4:52] isn't this what you've been praying
[4:53] about
[4:54] haven't you asked god to be the judge
[4:56] haven't you asked god to be the jury
[4:58] have you asked him to be the bailiff the
[4:59] prosecutor the defense attorney
[5:02] once that hit me
[5:03] i stopped talking to this man completely
[5:05] and the only words i said to him then on
[5:07] was
[5:08] you said you want me to take it straight
[5:10] please say yeah that would be a gosh i'm
[5:12] like saying no more let's go
[5:14] so we go inside the courtroom
[5:17] and we're all just sitting down
[5:19] while i'm sitting down i'm ready to go
[5:22] i'm just waiting for everything to
[5:23] happen
[5:24] the prosecutor pulls a defense attorney
[5:26] out
[5:27] and talks to him for a little bit
[5:30] now i i haven't said that that the
[5:32] prosecutor the person who he was
[5:34] defending
[5:35] had basically said that those words
[5:38] that the person said to him
[5:40] that
[5:41] how they would not like for me to get a
[5:43] departure and they want their words to
[5:46] be heard by the judge
[5:48] he said i cannot go against my client
[5:50] and i have to make sure that person's
[5:52] words are heard but i will not push
[5:54] towards you not getting a departure but
[5:56] i have to make sure that their words are
[5:58] heard
[6:00] he said that
[6:01] so
[6:02] while i told my defense attorney that oh
[6:05] yeah let's go do it and then he was
[6:07] pulled out by the prosecutor
[6:09] my defense attorney came back in pulled
[6:11] me out and said
[6:13] they're trying to
[6:15] they're trying to like ask if you're
[6:16] willing to take an ankle
[6:19] and if you take the ankle that
[6:21] the prosecutor himself will push towards
[6:23] you getting a departure as well with me
[6:25] and if he does that you're definitely
[6:26] going to get that departure ankle
[6:28] meaning that it's just a
[6:30] more serious charge if i end up messing
[6:32] up once again on the probation that i'm
[6:34] going to be getting
[6:36] so i told him you know what let's go and
[6:39] do it
[6:40] but you know how amazing god is
[6:42] it's like
[6:45] that same man who said i have to make
[6:47] sure
[6:48] that my client's voice is heard and it
[6:50] could affect me getting a departure and
[6:53] that he won't go against his client
[6:55] was the same man five minutes after i
[6:57] told my defense attorney
[7:00] let's go do it after i had thought
[7:02] hasn't it been something you've been
[7:03] praying about that god should be the
[7:05] judge after i told him that we went in
[7:07] no more less than five minutes i was
[7:09] pulled back outside
[7:11] just to be told
[7:12] that the prosecutor is willing to help
[7:15] me get a departure as well wow
[7:17] and through the whole entire thing never
[7:19] once did he ever say
[7:22] those words that his clients told him to
[7:24] say throughout the whole thing
[7:27] to tell you how people
[7:28] are used by god and they don't even
[7:31] realize what has happened
[7:37] so
[7:41] like i said saying that that was my last
[7:43] and final case and i just want to give
[7:45] god the glory for it
[7:47] to know that through it all he has shown
[7:48] me through and he has given me mercy and
[7:51] he has shown me his strength
[7:53] and i just thank him for it
[7:56] i thank you
[7:58] [Applause]

[42:00] somewhere on wednesday night the lord
[42:03] gave us
[42:04] a wonderful service a wonderful
[42:08] blessing
[42:09] of his presence there was
[42:12] there's a sister that called me after
[42:14] the service and share how the law was
[42:16] able to minister to her
[42:18] and we just thanked the law for that
[42:21] and it was not
[42:22] it was now more
[42:25] of the preaching there was more of
[42:30] some of the things that she
[42:32] had on her heart and she was dealing
[42:34] with and reading through and the holy
[42:36] spirit coming back
[42:38] and uh
[42:40] you know and
[42:42] and re-echoing those things it's always
[42:44] a blessing
[42:46] praise the lord
[42:47] you know when the lord can come
[42:49] through the preaching of the word
[42:51] and then he can come in and bring the
[42:54] very thoughts that are on our heart the
[42:56] very things we were thinking the very
[42:58] things you were reading through the week
[43:00] and the very song that we were singing
[43:02] i've seen it many times here
[43:04] many times
[43:07] praise the lord
[43:09] many times yet i've seen that
[43:12] amen there's there's something i wanted
[43:14] to i wanted to share with us
[43:19] this is something that
[43:21] i came across many years ago
[43:24] many years ago and
[43:27] i actually actually got
[43:30] a copy of that
[43:32] it was uh
[43:33] something like a statistics that was
[43:35] written
[43:36] back in
[43:38] and i think it was written back in the
[43:41] uh
[43:42] around
[43:43] around uh 1993
[43:45] also
[43:46] and and it became a very big curve
[43:51] and now the reason why i want to
[43:55] read this
[43:57] is to be able to help us to see
[44:00] some of the things
[44:03] that the grace of god
[44:06] without our effort
[44:09] has rescued us from
[44:12] praise lord
[44:14] amen
[44:15] some of the things
[44:17] that the grace of god
[44:19] has rescued us from now this statistic
[44:22] was actually put together i was looking
[44:24] at it last night
[44:26] and i mean it's just
[44:27] it's just uh
[44:30] too many information
[44:33] so
[44:33] i would just i would just read few of it
[44:37] just to use it i'm using it as a bit on
[44:40] the hulk
[44:42] so as you know me
[44:48] i like to fish that way
[44:54] so just just uh let's share this
[44:56] together
[45:10] like i said it just so many years
[45:13] that uh
[45:15] now this it picks up year with the 1993
[45:19] [Music]
[45:21] issue
[45:23] divorce and out of werelock childbirth
[45:28] transforming
[45:30] the life of american children
[45:34] in the post-war generation
[45:37] more than 80 percent of children grew up
[45:41] in a family
[45:43] with two biological parents
[45:45] who were married to each other
[45:48] by 1980
[45:50] only 50 percent could expect to spend
[45:53] their entire childhood
[45:57] in an intact family
[46:01] if current train if the current train
[46:04] continues
[46:06] less than half of all children born
[46:08] today
[46:09] will live continuously
[46:12] with their own mother and father
[46:14] throughout childhood
[46:17] most american children will spend
[46:19] several years
[46:21] in a single mother
[46:23] in a single mother family
[46:26] some
[46:27] will
[46:28] some will break up
[46:32] then intact
[46:34] but which may
[46:35] by which i mean two biological parents
[46:38] family
[46:39] an increasing number of children will
[46:41] experience family breakup two
[46:44] or even three times during childhood
[46:49] now this this statistics was only on
[46:51] america
[46:52] now you think about other parts of the
[46:54] world
[46:56] okay
[46:57] this person was just using the data on
[47:00] america
[47:01] but you think about other parts of the
[47:03] world
[47:07] i call into the growing body of
[47:11] social scientific evidence children in
[47:13] family disrupted by divorce and out of
[47:16] wedlock birth do worse than children
[47:19] in in tax family
[47:21] on several measure of well-being
[47:25] children
[47:26] in single-parent
[47:28] family
[47:29] are six times as likely to do
[47:33] poor
[47:35] they are also likely to stay poor longer
[47:41] 22 percent of children
[47:43] in one parent family will experience
[47:47] poverty during childhood
[47:50] for seven years or more
[47:52] as compared with
[47:54] only two percent of children
[47:57] in two-parent family
[48:00] a 1988 survey
[48:02] by the national center of health
[48:04] statistics found
[48:06] that children in single parent family
[48:09] are two or three times as likely
[48:13] as children in two-parent family to have
[48:16] emotional and behavior problems
[48:20] they are also more likely
[48:23] to drop out of high school
[48:26] or
[48:28] you know
[48:29] drop out of high school take uh
[48:34] get
[48:35] pregnant as teenage
[48:37] drugs abuse and to
[48:39] and and to be in trouble with the lord
[48:43] compare with children in a tax family
[48:46] children
[48:47] from this raw family
[48:51] at a much
[48:52] higher rates of physical
[48:55] or
[48:55] sexual abuse
[48:57] now
[49:00] the way the place is quiet i think my
[49:01] bed has has got a fish
[49:05] i've i sure think i can feel it
[49:09] i can feed the pool
[49:13] let us stand up for the reading of the
[49:15] word
[49:17] i can feed the poor
[49:20] i can feed the poor
[49:24] praise the lord
[49:26] i can feed the poor
[49:29] first corinthians chapter three
[49:34] we read that on uh
[49:37] wednesday night i will come back to that
[49:39] i will
[49:41] come back together um
[49:46] that we were reading a little bit and i
[49:47] will
[49:48] try to help you to see what i'm looking
[49:50] at
[49:51] like i said this is a statistics it's
[49:53] not the word of god
[49:55] okay it's not a word of god don't say
[49:57] amen to it
[50:02] don't say amen to it you should only say
[50:04] amen to the word of god
[50:06] this is just
[50:08] a public statistics
[50:10] that was gathered from different data is
[50:12] not the word of god it's not a divine
[50:14] saying
[50:18] praise the lord
[50:21] and because it's not god's word i don't
[50:23] expect it to come to pass in my life
[50:25] [Laughter]
[50:28] praise the lord amen it's only god's
[50:31] word that will not afford vowed will
[50:33] surely accomplish what they have said
[50:36] praise the lord
[50:37] so uh but there's a reason why and just
[50:40] like i said the reason why
[50:42] is to be able to
[50:44] appreciate
[50:47] is to be able to appreciate
[50:50] what
[50:51] the grace of god is doing in our lives
[50:55] amen
[50:56] what god's grace is doing in our life
[50:59] what did i say we are reading from
[51:03] first corinthians 3.
[51:13] okay first go into in chapter three
[51:17] uh
[51:18] first is that uh
[51:26] praise the lord
[51:29] let me
[51:32] just bear with me here i'm more nervous
[51:34] than you
[51:39] praise the lord
[51:44] we first read from second corinthians
[51:46] chapter five let's read that one first
[51:49] corinthians chapter three is where paul
[51:51] is talking about him being the master
[51:53] builder we read that on
[51:55] on wednesday night
[52:00] but we start up with uh
[52:07] we start up with uh
[52:09] uh paul bringing the argument that uh
[52:12] it's not apollos it's not paul
[52:15] we are just liberals is the main god
[52:17] that is doing the work is the lord above
[52:19] amen so don't put men into your view
[52:23] you know
[52:25] you know god will always use men god
[52:27] will use men to deliver you god will use
[52:29] men to persecute you
[52:31] he will always use man
[52:33] amen he will use some to encourage you
[52:35] he will use some to discourage you
[52:38] praise the lord
[52:39] so don't keep man in your view let's
[52:42] keep our eyes on the lord jesus second
[52:44] corinthians chapter 5 let's just read as
[52:47] we'll repeat this
[52:49] and
[52:53] then we will come back
[52:55] wherefore we liver
[52:57] we are labor
[52:59] that whether present or absent
[53:01] we may be accepted
[53:05] we may be accepted of him
[53:09] pleasing that word accepted there has
[53:12] the sense of pleasing that we are
[53:15] all maybe pleasing of him
[53:17] for we must all appear before the
[53:20] judgment seat of christ
[53:22] that everyone may receive
[53:26] the thing done in his body that was our
[53:29] emphasis
[53:30] this body in uh
[53:33] first corinthians chapter three is the
[53:34] temple of god
[53:36] so god did not just made this body for
[53:39] men to go about and use their body for
[53:42] anything and everything
[53:44] this body was made because in god's mind
[53:48] he wanted to use this body to be able to
[53:52] manifest his attributes to express
[53:55] himself
[53:56] for god to express himself that's why
[53:59] the prophet said everything that saved
[54:01] god's purpose there is a resurrection
[54:03] that is bound to wake so that's the
[54:05] reason why god made this body you
[54:08] remember god made man in his image and
[54:10] man was a spirit man
[54:12] you know he was a spirit man just like
[54:14] god genesis 2 7 then man came to the
[54:17] dust i mean god came to the dust of the
[54:19] earth and then he took the dust and he
[54:22] mowed man and and then
[54:25] uh
[54:26] breath into man the breath of life man
[54:29] became a living soul but it did not stop
[54:32] there
[54:34] after a while then god put that man to a
[54:36] deep sleep and again he broke into the
[54:39] man and took up a wreck
[54:42] and he went into the silence
[54:45] and he found a woman
[54:49] he went into a silence he he
[54:52] he formed the woman out of the dust of
[54:54] the earth put three sacred vets you in
[54:56] that woman to lock up the plane of
[54:58] redemption
[55:01] because there was a plane of redemption
[55:03] in god's mind the lamb was slain from
[55:06] the foundation of the word so god formed
[55:09] the woman
[55:11] to be a weaker vessel but yet he locked
[55:14] out three sacred vets you in her
[55:17] for the plan of redemption
[55:19] so you see
[55:20] the the you know uh everything that that
[55:23] god gave us he he he really made us for
[55:26] the purpose
[55:30] praise the lord
[55:32] amen
[55:33] the bible says he created a man in his
[55:35] image and in his likeness
[55:39] david said all the psalmist said uh you
[55:41] know fearfully and wonderfully
[55:44] which means man was made with lot of
[55:47] reverence god was reverent
[55:50] when he was making man
[55:54] he was reverence when he was supporting
[55:57] our cells our
[56:00] our intestines our heart in everything
[56:04] everything
[56:05] that is the reason why the the the human
[56:08] body the inside of our human body i mean
[56:10] you can bring the tabernacle out of
[56:12] there
[56:14] you can look at the the heart the two
[56:16] valves that are pumping the two valves
[56:18] that are that are receiving you can tie
[56:20] the full gospel to it
[56:24] that's the reason why he promised to
[56:25] write the tables on our heart
[56:32] let's bow with his heavenly father
[56:34] we want to thank you for your presence
[56:37] lord and and we kind of said privilege
[56:40] that you will associate with us
[56:43] in this way father by your spirit
[56:46] get in the hold of our house lord i pray
[56:48] that god you
[56:49] bless the service lord as you begin you
[56:51] have already begin to do
[56:53] just come out of the pages of your word
[56:56] meet us lord meet us
[56:58] uh at the very point of our needs lord
[57:00] god the little ones lord father the
[57:03] young people oh god father even
[57:07] the
[57:08] the elders lord
[57:10] we pray that we all be in your hands now
[57:12] we are all your children are you forced
[57:14] to needing from you in jesus name we
[57:17] pray amen the lord bless you you may
[57:19] have your sin
[57:23] so here paul is saying that we will all
[57:26] be at the judgment seat every man
[57:29] uh
[57:30] will receive the thing done in his body
[57:34] according to that which he have done
[57:37] whether good or bad
[57:39] now this does not have to do anything
[57:42] with the final judgment no
[57:44] this this is uh uh i call in if you said
[57:48] it is is is called the bema seat
[57:51] you know is is the seat where uh
[57:54] rewards are handed over
[57:57] and
[58:00] so we've been talking about rewards
[58:02] we've been talking about the rewards of
[58:05] crown looking at the different
[58:07] different uh rewards of crown uh in in
[58:11] the scripture i had this one yet in that
[58:13] i really did not touch the philippian
[58:15] chapter one uh philippians chapter four
[58:17] verse one let's just look at that one
[58:19] then we will uh digress back to what we
[58:23] are talking about
[58:24] philippians chapter
[58:26] 4
[58:29] philippians chapter 4.
[58:39] philippians chapter four verse one
[58:41] therefore
[58:42] my brethren
[58:44] uh
[58:46] therefore my brethren is the la beloved
[58:50] and long for my joy
[58:53] my crown
[58:55] to stand fast in the lord dearly beloved
[58:58] okay
[59:00] uh
[59:01] let's look at first testimony in 2-9
[59:08] i know there's a thought that i tied
[59:10] that wave
[59:11] and
[59:13] for you remember brethren's our labor
[59:16] and trial
[59:17] for labor and night and day because
[59:20] we will not
[59:23] be
[59:24] chargeable on to any of you
[59:28] that i said 219.
[59:32] 219
[59:33] first thessalonians 2 19.
[59:40] for what is our hope our joy our crown
[59:43] of rejoicing okay that's that's the word
[59:46] i was looking for crown of rejoicing
[59:49] do you
[59:50] realize that god can give a man crown of
[59:53] rejoicing
[59:56] you know god can actually reward a man
[59:59] and gave him a crown of rejoicing
[1:00:04] and
[1:00:12] he says for what is our hope our joy our
[1:00:15] crime of rejoicing and not even here
[1:00:19] in the presence of our lord jesus christ
[1:00:22] at his coming
[1:00:24] now
[1:00:25] a man can have a crown of rejoicing but
[1:00:28] here paul
[1:00:30] is uh alluding to the fact that
[1:00:33] our
[1:00:34] our staying in the faith
[1:00:38] you know if we if we hold fast to the
[1:00:40] faith
[1:00:42] to the coming of the lord
[1:00:44] that would be the crown of rejoicing
[1:00:46] this is almost like you go to the book
[1:00:48] of uh first second john you hear john
[1:00:51] using this statement he says
[1:00:54] he says i rejoice to see my children
[1:00:58] walking in the truth
[1:01:00] it's a crown of rejoicing every time the
[1:01:03] apostle will come back and he will meet
[1:01:05] the people that he had preached to you
[1:01:07] know carrying on in the face
[1:01:09] is it rejoices heart
[1:01:12] that's that's actually what rejoice the
[1:01:14] heart of a preacher to have people to
[1:01:16] preach talk
[1:01:18] you you cannot pay a preacher
[1:01:20] you know when a preacher travel the
[1:01:23] things that make his joy i mean his his
[1:01:26] trip joyful is to have people to preach
[1:01:29] to him
[1:01:31] praise the lord
[1:01:32] i'm telling you if i don't have people
[1:01:34] to preach i would go mad i would go
[1:01:37] because some of the things that is in my
[1:01:39] head
[1:01:43] praise the lord
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] so that's actually what paul you know
[1:01:49] was was speaking about to have people
[1:01:52] waiting for the coming of the lord to
[1:01:54] have people serving god
[1:01:56] you know he says it's a crown of
[1:01:58] rejoicing
[1:02:00] i feel crowned in my heart the apostle
[1:02:03] paul says to see you waiting for the
[1:02:05] coming of the lord
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:13] you know it's almost like you go to a
[1:02:15] place
[1:02:16] you're not very sure never got an
[1:02:18] address no contact
[1:02:20] and and and right at the airport or
[1:02:22] right in the market you just you just
[1:02:24] see someone that you know that that is a
[1:02:27] believer
[1:02:28] oh my god what a relief it brings
[1:02:31] man that's a believer in this era wow
[1:02:34] you know i mean everything just yes
[1:02:37] everything just changed
[1:02:43] praise the lord
[1:02:46] to see people of like precious faith is
[1:02:49] a crown of rejoicing
[1:02:52] so as we look at this
[1:02:54] as we look at this
[1:02:56] we will
[1:02:58] you know we will
[1:03:00] trust yeah i want to start start from
[1:03:02] where i stopped on wednesday night
[1:03:05] because i mean uh
[1:03:07] uh
[1:03:08] the presence of the law was so blessful
[1:03:11] to us that we couldn't we couldn't even
[1:03:13] preach we just only read but random
[1:03:16] testimony in there from the the sixth
[1:03:18] seal
[1:03:19] now so uh
[1:03:21] uh
[1:03:22] and so like i just like i said what the
[1:03:25] reason why i read that statistics is for
[1:03:28] for us to be able to appreciate
[1:03:31] what the grace of god is doing in our
[1:03:33] life because i call into the statistics
[1:03:36] that is the path that is set
[1:03:39] for many to walk into
[1:03:42] and what is happening here is that the
[1:03:44] grace of god has snatched you from that
[1:03:46] path
[1:03:48] god has says no you are my own
[1:03:51] praise lord
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:57] now all you need to do is to just
[1:03:59] embrace that grace and hold fast to it
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] because the society is saying this is
[1:04:05] what you will become
[1:04:09] and every devil in hell is swearing by
[1:04:11] their life
[1:04:14] that this is what you will become amen
[1:04:20] this is what your life will become this
[1:04:22] is what your marriage will become this
[1:04:24] is what your children will become
[1:04:28] and the grace of god is saying no they
[1:04:30] are mine
[1:04:31] they have been purchased by the blood
[1:04:33] a price have been paid
[1:04:37] how we should appreciate that grace
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:41] how should we appreciate that grace
[1:04:54] praise the lord
[1:04:55] now brother branham uh we that the sixth
[1:04:57] ceo uh we're reading that on on
[1:05:00] uh uh
[1:05:02] wednesday night he was talking about uh
[1:05:05] uh that dream of uh you know of the
[1:05:08] recording injured i kind of broke it
[1:05:10] here because it was a kind of a long
[1:05:12] reading wednesday night i'll go back to
[1:05:14] it he says the recording injury and
[1:05:16] that's the reason why i'm going back to
[1:05:18] it
[1:05:19] and the recording angel stood and said
[1:05:21] well brandon
[1:05:23] i never thought i they have to walk that
[1:05:28] so then
[1:05:29] i was scared why was he scared
[1:05:34] praise the lord amen
[1:05:36] why was he scared
[1:05:38] do you remember where paul says
[1:05:41] i don't i don't want to preach and then
[1:05:43] at the end
[1:05:47] i see myself at castleway
[1:05:52] the man i was that was the prophet to
[1:05:54] the gentile that had the mystery of the
[1:05:56] new testament
[1:05:58] is saying that
[1:05:59] i don't want to preach all of this and
[1:06:02] at the end i've been i've being a cast
[1:06:03] away and your brother batman is
[1:06:05] expressing the same thought
[1:06:10] he says so then i was here
[1:06:13] so you see every preacher
[1:06:15] every son of god hold that in their
[1:06:19] heart
[1:06:20] that's the reason why
[1:06:22] we we we we approach the word of god
[1:06:25] with with grace and with reverence
[1:06:32] ignoring that i mean is is not only only
[1:06:35] the the the people that you are
[1:06:37] preaching to
[1:06:39] you're also preaching to yourself
[1:06:42] and that's the reason why many times the
[1:06:44] way a preacher receives a message he
[1:06:47] cannot deliver it that way
[1:06:49] sometimes you will think that i really
[1:06:51] want to bring it to the people no
[1:06:53] because the first thing there is that
[1:06:55] god starts to deal with you
[1:06:59] praise the lord and maybe there is just
[1:07:02] a little portion for the people
[1:07:08] amen praise the lord
[1:07:14] so he said so then i was here and i
[1:07:17] started walking up through there and
[1:07:18] just just as i made the first step i i
[1:07:22] stopped i looked
[1:07:24] at his face and i thought i want to i
[1:07:26] want to get a good look at him uh
[1:07:30] this way then i stopped
[1:07:32] i had my hands like this i felt
[1:07:35] something slip in my hands here it was
[1:07:38] somebody else's arm i look around and
[1:07:41] and
[1:07:42] there's two hope
[1:07:44] those big those those uh big black eyes
[1:07:48] and and and that that
[1:07:50] head hanging down
[1:07:52] her back and and white robin looking up
[1:07:56] at me like that
[1:07:57] praise the lord
[1:07:59] he says and i said open and and i felt
[1:08:02] something hit my arms look around
[1:08:06] there was me there that dark eyes
[1:08:09] looking
[1:08:10] up
[1:08:11] and they had black head hanging down and
[1:08:13] white robe and i sent me there and they
[1:08:16] look uh and they look at one another
[1:08:21] i got them in my arms and and
[1:08:24] oh
[1:08:25] i woke up
[1:08:28] it says i sat down in a chair and i
[1:08:30] cried you know i thought oh god i hope
[1:08:33] that comes like that
[1:08:35] both
[1:08:36] associate with me
[1:08:38] in life
[1:08:39] and bringing
[1:08:41] children and things like that okay
[1:08:43] that's that is the online place and
[1:08:45] there's a reason why i read that
[1:08:48] is is uh i will follow the talks here
[1:08:51] and brother branham here uh in this in
[1:08:54] this uh uh a dream he's having is is is
[1:08:58] also representing what we have we have
[1:09:00] uh uh i read about uh every man
[1:09:04] receiving the reward of what is done in
[1:09:06] their body and yeri said he's seen here
[1:09:10] that uh
[1:09:12] the two
[1:09:13] sisters that associated with him in his
[1:09:16] life as his wife
[1:09:18] uh because uh hope was the first wife
[1:09:21] and and when she passed away
[1:09:24] then uh uh uh true a vision yeah she
[1:09:27] told brother brown don't be single you
[1:09:29] have to get married billy you have to go
[1:09:31] on you have to find a woman to raise my
[1:09:33] son billy paul and burt benham got
[1:09:35] married to meet him and uh
[1:09:38] but there are there are some things that
[1:09:41] we will not
[1:09:43] appreciate
[1:09:45] unless the grace of god help us to look
[1:09:47] at some things so i want to read a few
[1:09:48] of them to you
[1:09:50] right here brother branham talks yet
[1:09:52] about his first visit to the pentecostal
[1:09:55] people
[1:09:57] at the uh
[1:10:00] martial arkham meetings he said so i
[1:10:02] remember when i first come around the
[1:10:05] pentecostal people years ago it was at
[1:10:08] mishawaka he said there
[1:10:11] there was two group of them
[1:10:13] one was called the the the pa
[1:10:18] of w and and uh another one the pe and
[1:10:21] the jc uh jc
[1:10:23] there was a jesus name people and uh and
[1:10:26] and the pentecostal i think it was
[1:10:28] oneness because the pentecostal after
[1:10:31] azusa street split it into two groups
[1:10:34] it split it into the united pentecostal
[1:10:38] and also the assembly of god amen
[1:10:42] there was the two groups that are
[1:10:43] denominated from the real pentecostal
[1:10:47] revival
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:50] now so he says i believe
[1:10:53] their convention
[1:10:56] in enough lane because there
[1:10:59] there was segregation i want you to
[1:11:02] notice that word there was segregation
[1:11:04] so
[1:11:06] the the the colorado veterans
[1:11:09] who attend the meeting
[1:11:12] i watched them all day how
[1:11:15] peculiar
[1:11:16] no more church man of mine i was sitting
[1:11:19] there
[1:11:21] and we baptized we know
[1:11:23] we tried to to add kind of
[1:11:26] churchy in church
[1:11:28] but this fellow didn't have any baptist
[1:11:31] man at all
[1:11:33] all in a church manner
[1:11:36] what is the beginning of the year so i
[1:11:38] can i can i can i can take the liberty
[1:11:41] and express some things there
[1:11:43] you will realize that the first church
[1:11:45] order that brother branham gave
[1:11:47] the first church order if you study
[1:11:49] church order verbum talks about uh you
[1:11:52] know the the sunday school
[1:11:53] superintendent coming giving the sunday
[1:11:55] school report and all of that all of
[1:11:57] that was a baptist order
[1:11:59] if you rehab in the baptist church if
[1:12:02] you have stayed around the south in
[1:12:03] baptist you will know
[1:12:05] that
[1:12:07] as brother branham was bringing this
[1:12:08] church although there were there were
[1:12:10] things that that was the best that he
[1:12:12] knew
[1:12:13] that is the reason why when you go back
[1:12:16] and you look at the church order or the
[1:12:18] dedication before the seals you found
[1:12:21] out that
[1:12:22] there were major things that brother
[1:12:24] branham major on
[1:12:28] and why the reason why i say that is
[1:12:31] because
[1:12:33] many don't appreciate the progression
[1:12:37] the progression
[1:12:40] the way brother branham progress
[1:12:46] the bible says even our lord jesus
[1:12:48] learned
[1:12:49] by the things
[1:12:50] that he suffered amen
[1:12:55] praise the lord
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:58] now so that was just a parenthesis
[1:13:03] uh
[1:13:05] now so what i want us to to see here is
[1:13:09] the other let's read the next the next
[1:13:12] quote live story then
[1:13:14] maybe you you might grab it or you might
[1:13:16] not why there
[1:13:19] there were
[1:13:20] there where the trouble started right
[1:13:22] there he's talking about uh uh
[1:13:25] he and his mother-in-law uh
[1:13:28] sister hope mother
[1:13:30] uh she said william william branham do
[1:13:32] you mean to tell me
[1:13:35] that you did take my daughter
[1:13:37] out among a bunch of trash like that
[1:13:41] i said well look uh
[1:13:45] mrs brownback they are not trash he said
[1:13:48] that's a bunch of holy ruler now so what
[1:13:50] was happening here you know to be able
[1:13:53] to appreciate
[1:13:54] this was a time where uh there was there
[1:13:57] was
[1:13:58] segregation okay and and uh
[1:14:02] i mean the the
[1:14:04] the the people in the south or the black
[1:14:06] and the white they were not migrating
[1:14:08] even in in churches
[1:14:10] so
[1:14:12] now brother branham
[1:14:15] seeing what is happening here among the
[1:14:18] the pentecostal people that there is
[1:14:21] something in there i want you to
[1:14:22] appreciate
[1:14:23] and you have to remember that william
[1:14:26] simon was a black man that you know that
[1:14:28] god you know started using uh at the
[1:14:31] azusa stream meeting and and and this
[1:14:34] there has always been any ages there
[1:14:36] were many people that that associated
[1:14:38] with with a pentecostal move just only
[1:14:40] because i'm a bunch of black people were
[1:14:42] there they never had no revelation they
[1:14:44] never had no birth
[1:14:46] okay
[1:14:48] but
[1:14:48] this is what is happening now
[1:14:51] so
[1:14:52] you can you can realize here that from
[1:14:54] this court brother branham realized what
[1:14:58] is happening among those pentecostal
[1:15:00] people
[1:15:01] and uh uh remember he's a young preacher
[1:15:04] now then god is dealing with his heart
[1:15:06] and he come and share that with his uh
[1:15:09] with his young
[1:15:10] wife and and uh
[1:15:13] hope and and you know and hope is
[1:15:15] supporting him you you remember brother
[1:15:17] branham we'll talk about how hope would
[1:15:19] read the bible to him and he would say
[1:15:21] yeah that's true you know and and he
[1:15:23] says read the next chapter oh yeah
[1:15:25] praise the lord you know because of his
[1:15:27] poor education and all of that now so uh
[1:15:30] uh she going now to support her husband
[1:15:35] in that revival
[1:15:38] i'm trying to bring you to why
[1:15:42] god is involving her in his reward
[1:15:48] praise the lord
[1:15:50] because the reward is what is done in
[1:15:52] this body
[1:15:55] why is god involving her in the reward
[1:16:00] because at this major junction of her
[1:16:03] life
[1:16:06] she was willing to stand with the
[1:16:08] prophet of god
[1:16:11] willing to support she may she may not
[1:16:14] understand her or she know i mean she's
[1:16:15] in love with this man and and that i
[1:16:17] mean he keeps talking about vision he
[1:16:19] keeps talking about all these spiritual
[1:16:21] things
[1:16:21] [Laughter]
[1:16:24] praise the lord
[1:16:26] can you imagine
[1:16:28] a man wake up and then he's just telling
[1:16:30] you all this spiritual thing and your
[1:16:32] hair's standing on your back
[1:16:35] praise the lord
[1:16:37] you're asking yourself i wonder he knows
[1:16:39] how how many table of spoons i put in
[1:16:41] the soup
[1:16:44] as you are cooking
[1:16:48] oh my goodness bill
[1:16:50] man a vision can't stop
[1:16:54] praise the lord
[1:16:55] it's just few that we had on tips
[1:16:58] but just imagine the things that were
[1:17:00] happening to him daily
[1:17:05] praise the lord
[1:17:06] when you see the picture of brother
[1:17:08] branham rome in tucson he had two twins
[1:17:11] bed
[1:17:13] the picture
[1:17:14] of the room he was sleeping before he
[1:17:16] went behind the curtain of the time his
[1:17:18] two twins bear why because of his nature
[1:17:21] of having vision
[1:17:25] media never wanted to disturb him
[1:17:34] praise the lord
[1:17:36] remember one other vision brother
[1:17:38] branham talks about he says i was just
[1:17:40] coming out of the vision and i heard
[1:17:41] mida and the children talking i needed
[1:17:44] to get them to school
[1:17:48] that was the kind of a life that he
[1:17:49] lived
[1:17:51] and here is a woman that was standing by
[1:17:53] the man like that
[1:17:58] that would stand by a man like that and
[1:18:00] support his lifestyle
[1:18:03] brother brahma comes from missionary
[1:18:05] work he comes home
[1:18:07] and then i mean uh casey's wife spent
[1:18:10] just a day or two and then he goes
[1:18:12] hunting
[1:18:17] you see while um social media flipped
[1:18:19] when joseph was was you know as a young
[1:18:21] boy was you know and she said well you
[1:18:23] are now always here and and all of that
[1:18:26] but it gives you
[1:18:29] it gives you an idea
[1:18:33] because these are the things that god
[1:18:36] rewards
[1:18:42] are we together
[1:18:44] these are the things that god reward god
[1:18:47] associating them with his reward
[1:18:56] hope supported him as a major junction
[1:18:59] of his ministry
[1:19:02] because he needed to experience the
[1:19:04] pentecostal people because he was he was
[1:19:07] going to breach the edge from the
[1:19:09] pentecostal over to the seals
[1:19:14] praise the lord amen
[1:19:17] and and and media
[1:19:20] you know
[1:19:21] supported him through the rest of the
[1:19:23] ministry
[1:19:32] are we together
[1:19:37] praise the lord
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:41] now let's take another one here
[1:19:46] uh
[1:19:47] truth easter seals now he's talking now
[1:19:50] about uh
[1:19:51] donnie herron prophecy
[1:19:53] i don't want to bring the whole story to
[1:19:55] you you know about it
[1:19:57] if you want to know more you can come
[1:19:58] we'll talk about it you want my quotes
[1:20:00] ask the people back there they will send
[1:20:02] it to your email because they are has
[1:20:05] choosing the narrow path the harder way
[1:20:09] that has walked in
[1:20:11] your own choosing when brother brandon
[1:20:14] read this he made an emphasis he said
[1:20:16] you remember moses how to do his own
[1:20:19] choosing
[1:20:20] it was moses own choice to leave the
[1:20:24] palace
[1:20:25] and go down
[1:20:27] and associate himself with the hebrew
[1:20:28] people
[1:20:29] it was his own choice it was not a dream
[1:20:32] it was not a vision
[1:20:33] it was his own choice
[1:20:38] are we together amen
[1:20:44] praise the lord
[1:20:48] because there
[1:20:50] there has chosen the narrow path the
[1:20:52] harder way there that has walked in
[1:20:54] their own choosing
[1:20:59] now
[1:21:01] now this man
[1:21:03] now watch how he wrote it
[1:21:07] you can see it wrote
[1:21:09] in foreign words
[1:21:12] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:21:15] decision
[1:21:16] and it
[1:21:18] and
[1:21:19] it is my way bless god is my way he said
[1:21:25] because
[1:21:26] of this momentous decision a huge
[1:21:30] portion of heaven await thee now watch
[1:21:32] the connection here now he had never
[1:21:36] heard about the vision what vision it
[1:21:39] was beyond the curtain of time
[1:21:44] so what is he doing here he associating
[1:21:48] danny hendren prophecy
[1:21:50] with
[1:21:51] the visit behind the curtain of time
[1:21:55] are we together amen
[1:21:58] praise the lord
[1:22:00] am i am i making you bald
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:05] did i miss the road somewhere
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:11] praise the lord
[1:22:13] people let's get into the word amen
[1:22:16] let's get into the word
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:19] it's no time to talk fairy tales
[1:22:22] god want to take us into another level
[1:22:25] of our walk with him amen
[1:22:27] he's now only satisfied of us being
[1:22:29] church member
[1:22:30] he want to take us this is the age of
[1:22:32] inheritance this is the age where we
[1:22:34] must possess
[1:22:36] praise the lord god is depending on us
[1:22:39] to be sons and daughters of god
[1:22:41] it will only come by us knowing the
[1:22:43] things that we are entitled to
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:47] so
[1:22:48] don't sleep on me now amen
[1:22:51] praise the lord
[1:22:53] now so he's he's connecting these two
[1:22:56] things
[1:22:57] now you have to remember
[1:22:59] what what we are driving at
[1:23:02] brother bram says in the message how can
[1:23:03] i overcome he said these are the things
[1:23:05] that pastors see
[1:23:07] you know watching where the people are
[1:23:09] and where they are supposed to be
[1:23:11] praise the lord i think we are hanging
[1:23:13] around this mountain too long it's time
[1:23:15] to go into the lane amen
[1:23:17] [Laughter]
[1:23:19] it's time to go into the land young
[1:23:20] people
[1:23:21] praise the lord
[1:23:23] amen because there is blessing on the
[1:23:25] other side that we have to enjoy there
[1:23:27] is blessing on the other side when you
[1:23:29] take your position as a son of god no
[1:23:31] matter what the devil does there's
[1:23:33] blessing on the other side that we have
[1:23:34] to enjoy amen we have grapes as big as
[1:23:37] our blood
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:41] so you don't have to throw blood just
[1:23:43] take one grip and send it on the devil
[1:23:45] face
[1:23:46] it's as big as your blow
[1:23:49] now so he's connecting these things uh
[1:23:52] uh uh he he has not heard about the
[1:23:55] vision you remember the vision a huge
[1:23:58] portion of heaven awaits thee
[1:24:00] what a glorious decision there has made
[1:24:05] praise the lord
[1:24:06] now when brother branham talks about the
[1:24:09] vision behind the curtain of time in the
[1:24:11] message having confidence he prayed this
[1:24:14] prayer now watch this now he says may
[1:24:16] every person that that
[1:24:20] this year
[1:24:22] on this ground
[1:24:23] may i
[1:24:25] meet them
[1:24:26] everyone
[1:24:28] over there in that glorious place
[1:24:32] wherever it was
[1:24:34] or whatever it was lord let me meet them
[1:24:39] in that place i love them and they love
[1:24:42] me and you told me
[1:24:45] all that you ever love
[1:24:48] and all that love you
[1:24:51] has gathered you
[1:24:53] to be with you
[1:24:55] now the reason why i'm putting all of
[1:24:57] these together
[1:24:58] is because
[1:25:00] this is not your reward
[1:25:04] this is brother branham's reward
[1:25:06] it's not our reward
[1:25:12] you see
[1:25:13] because
[1:25:14] people
[1:25:15] you hear people saying it
[1:25:18] you know
[1:25:18] brother brown says all all that love him
[1:25:20] and all that he loved will be there
[1:25:23] that was not said to you it was said to
[1:25:27] him
[1:25:29] this huge portion of heaven is his
[1:25:31] reward
[1:25:32] god is rewarding him
[1:25:37] or maybe you didn't understand me i will
[1:25:39] help you i will break it down so it can
[1:25:41] be a little bit clear see
[1:25:44] when when eliezer
[1:25:46] went to look for a wife for isaac
[1:25:50] he swirled onto abraham
[1:25:52] amen took an art with abraham
[1:25:56] and then after he left he found his
[1:25:59] ground of uh his little closet and he
[1:26:01] said lord god of my father abraham oh
[1:26:04] god please leave me lord let me not made
[1:26:07] a mistake father lord o god i pray the
[1:26:10] lord god you will bless me as i travel
[1:26:12] lord father god as he prayed as he
[1:26:15] prayed as he prayed he broke into a
[1:26:17] place he said lord
[1:26:19] may the woman that come out and gave me
[1:26:22] water to drink
[1:26:23] and gave my camber water to drink
[1:26:26] praise the lord now you might not you
[1:26:29] might not realize that but l.a is a
[1:26:31] trouble with some men
[1:26:33] it's in the text
[1:26:35] but that's another thing let me not
[1:26:37] stray
[1:26:39] let me now straight
[1:26:41] so he said this prayer to god
[1:26:45] he said this prayer to god
[1:26:48] now
[1:26:50] when uh uh
[1:26:54] when uh
[1:26:58] he got there
[1:26:59] and rebecca came out
[1:27:02] and and she gave
[1:27:05] uh the candle water to drink
[1:27:08] now you realize
[1:27:10] that uh
[1:27:12] uh
[1:27:13] that was an answer
[1:27:16] to eliezer prayer
[1:27:18] are we together
[1:27:20] so god in another sense was
[1:27:24] rewarding eliezer
[1:27:26] by
[1:27:27] not not fulfilling the prayer in a
[1:27:32] symbolic way
[1:27:33] but uh
[1:27:35] uh you know fulfilling it in a way word
[1:27:39] is is it's a direct thing that he has
[1:27:41] prayed for now
[1:27:43] god rewalling
[1:27:45] eddie easier
[1:27:47] by bringing his prayer to pass is
[1:27:51] completely different
[1:27:53] are we together
[1:27:54] completely different
[1:27:56] than uh
[1:27:58] because rebecca actually is going to be
[1:28:01] a wife for isaac
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:05] eliza is going to get isaac wife
[1:28:08] so god fulfilling his prayer
[1:28:13] in one sense is rewarding
[1:28:16] his faithfulness his dedication
[1:28:20] but yet the bride is going to be isaac's
[1:28:26] bride and what i want you to see is that
[1:28:31] the the the the reward of eliezer and
[1:28:35] the bride of isaac
[1:28:38] god is rewarding ali
[1:28:41] but his commitment his prayer putting
[1:28:44] his heart before god
[1:28:49] let me take another example
[1:28:53] paul
[1:28:54] told timothy
[1:28:57] and says
[1:28:59] there's a gift
[1:29:02] you know
[1:29:03] that
[1:29:04] is upon your life
[1:29:07] because of your grandmother
[1:29:11] praise the lord
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:14] because of your grandmother and your
[1:29:16] mother loyal there's a gift that is that
[1:29:19] is upon your life
[1:29:21] now
[1:29:22] so you see what i'm coming with this
[1:29:24] thought is at a place where
[1:29:26] parents are forerunner
[1:29:30] eliezer was a forerunner
[1:29:32] of isaac
[1:29:34] to get a bride for isaac
[1:29:38] and because he gave the bribe for isaac
[1:29:40] he could not make the bride his own
[1:29:43] he was only a forerunner
[1:29:46] are we together
[1:29:48] amen
[1:29:48] the same with parents parents are
[1:29:50] forerunner there are a lot of things
[1:29:54] that
[1:29:55] we enjoy in our lives
[1:29:58] all because of the blessings that comes
[1:30:00] from our parents
[1:30:04] praise the lord you might you might not
[1:30:06] know if you might not uh uh either your
[1:30:08] parents or your grandparents
[1:30:12] because the law of god are visiting the
[1:30:15] iniquities still is these things
[1:30:20] visiting the iniquity of the generation
[1:30:22] and generation to come
[1:30:25] he visit the iniquity and he also
[1:30:27] blessed the people
[1:30:31] praise the lord
[1:30:37] there is uh
[1:30:44] if you you follow the
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] brother branham was talking to
[1:30:53] i'm trying to get the brother name
[1:30:57] he was the one that was growing the
[1:30:59] fruits
[1:31:00] were he was he was blending
[1:31:04] the season and where brother branham got
[1:31:07] that thought
[1:31:08] of uh if this sea ever pulled forth
[1:31:10] again
[1:31:11] it would bring his original crop
[1:31:15] okay
[1:31:16] when brother branham was visiting him
[1:31:19] and uh
[1:31:21] uh
[1:31:22] you know brother bam talks about being
[1:31:24] on his farm and seeing you know one tree
[1:31:26] bringing many fruits and you're asking
[1:31:28] how how did you how did this happen he
[1:31:30] says oh no they were great you know but
[1:31:33] if they ever bring food again you know
[1:31:35] they will
[1:31:36] and uh
[1:31:38] uh
[1:31:39] is that john sheriff if i remember the
[1:31:42] name and uh
[1:31:46] so brother branham as he was talking
[1:31:49] to the man
[1:31:52] he uh
[1:31:54] he broke into a vision and and told the
[1:31:56] man he says you know that god has
[1:31:58] blessed you
[1:32:00] because
[1:32:02] of
[1:32:02] your father
[1:32:05] he says your father was a great
[1:32:07] supporter of missionaries
[1:32:10] he supported missionaries whenever the
[1:32:12] missionary came true you know he he took
[1:32:15] care of them and you know whether his
[1:32:17] father or his grandfather trying to get
[1:32:19] the story together
[1:32:20] and uh
[1:32:22] uh so you see jerry said he's enjoying
[1:32:26] you know uh uh because he he was blessed
[1:32:28] he was he was wealthy and you ever said
[1:32:31] he's enjoying all of this
[1:32:34] but
[1:32:35] actually
[1:32:36] is a reward
[1:32:41] from his grandfather whether the father
[1:32:43] or the grandfather
[1:32:46] praise the lord
[1:32:48] amen
[1:32:50] god blessing him because uh uh you know
[1:32:53] his uh his uh his father or his
[1:32:56] grandfather was a great supporter of
[1:32:58] missionaries so you see that that is the
[1:33:01] thing with with four runners
[1:33:05] john the baptist was a forerunner of
[1:33:07] jesus ministry
[1:33:10] but he came he preached
[1:33:12] behold the lamb of god
[1:33:14] that that takes away the sin of the word
[1:33:16] the thing that he talks about before the
[1:33:18] blessing comes for him to be opening the
[1:33:20] blind as john hare was cut off
[1:33:26] even though he was a forerunner
[1:33:28] he prepared the house of the people but
[1:33:30] he never sat down to enjoy the ministry
[1:33:35] that's another group of people
[1:33:38] that are receiving the blessing of the
[1:33:40] the lame walking the dead and and all of
[1:33:42] that
[1:33:44] are you grabbing the concept of where
[1:33:45] i'm going with this
[1:33:50] the lord amen
[1:33:52] god
[1:33:53] is gracious to us and in helping us
[1:33:56] because
[1:33:58] some of our parents have sleep has not
[1:34:00] praying for
[1:34:02] us and then sometimes we are not
[1:34:05] conscious of that
[1:34:07] we are not conscious
[1:34:09] we we attribute it to our smartness
[1:34:14] we think because we are smart
[1:34:18] you have not been rewarded for the
[1:34:20] things that are done in your body the
[1:34:22] things you are enjoying
[1:34:24] is your forerunners
[1:34:26] that have laid the path for you
[1:34:30] praise the lord
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] because you're still filling your cup
[1:34:35] yet
[1:34:37] whatever you're putting inside stick is
[1:34:39] it's coming up
[1:34:42] are you grabbing the concept of where
[1:34:44] i'm going
[1:34:46] praise the lord
[1:34:50] that's the reason why god gave us
[1:34:52] foreigners
[1:34:53] that's why he gave us parents
[1:34:58] and put people's people in our lives
[1:35:03] people that we meet in and people that
[1:35:05] care for us and people that love us and
[1:35:07] people that we pray for us
[1:35:22] so if you put all of these together
[1:35:25] you realize the other you know when i
[1:35:27] when i thought about it i i was thinking
[1:35:30] the other you know how how lazy it and
[1:35:33] how people you know all i have to do i
[1:35:36] just have to love brother brandon
[1:35:37] because
[1:35:38] brother branham says you know them that
[1:35:40] love him and them that he love will be
[1:35:42] there that's why i love my prophet
[1:35:45] jesus says the end that love me will
[1:35:47] keep my commandments that's what he said
[1:35:50] that's what jesus said
[1:35:52] so you can print brother branham gown
[1:35:54] and put it in front and put it behind if
[1:35:56] you're not living by the world that is
[1:35:58] not your reward it's not your promise
[1:36:08] it is his reward
[1:36:15] praise the lord amen
[1:36:23] because of the stain that he talks for
[1:36:25] the world
[1:36:26] now he's gone this is our time what
[1:36:29] stand are we taking
[1:36:32] oh we are only depending on his stain
[1:36:37] how are we standing for god in our time
[1:37:01] dumbbells of what you have because it's
[1:37:02] somebody else's benefit that you're
[1:37:04] enjoying
[1:37:07] keep working for what you have
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:13] somebody's left over that you are
[1:37:15] enjoying so
[1:37:17] praise the lord
[1:37:19] i wanted to bring that thought across
[1:37:22] matthew chapter five let's go there
[1:37:33] matthew chapter 5
[1:37:36] jesus
[1:37:40] our lord jesus
[1:37:52] in matthew chapter
[1:37:54] 4
[1:37:56] if i'm right
[1:37:59] the bible says
[1:38:01] and jesus
[1:38:02] began to preach
[1:38:06] that the kingdom of god was a hand amen
[1:38:12] praise the lord
[1:38:14] are we together
[1:38:20] matthew chapter 3 verse 1 in those days
[1:38:22] john the baptist preaching in the
[1:38:24] wilderness said repent
[1:38:27] the kingdom of heaven is a hand
[1:38:31] praise the lord
[1:38:32] matthew chapter 4 verse 1 jesus went
[1:38:35] into the wilderness
[1:38:36] and then
[1:38:39] he was tempted by the devil
[1:38:42] praise the lord
[1:38:46] and then in verse 17 the bible says and
[1:38:48] from that time after he came out of the
[1:38:50] wilderness he begin to preach
[1:38:53] saying repent for the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:57] is a hand
[1:38:58] now he's talking about this kingdom of
[1:39:01] heaven
[1:39:02] he's talking about this kingdom of
[1:39:05] heaven
[1:39:07] you will realize that
[1:39:09] matthew
[1:39:11] is uh
[1:39:12] is one of the person
[1:39:14] that used there is two expressions on
[1:39:16] this the kingdom of heaven and the
[1:39:18] kingdom of god
[1:39:20] okay
[1:39:22] but
[1:39:23] matthew is one of the one that that
[1:39:27] specifically used the kingdom of heaven
[1:39:31] praise the lord
[1:39:32] now watch my train of thought here now
[1:39:35] now he's preaching here
[1:39:37] talking about the kingdom of heaven is a
[1:39:40] hand
[1:39:42] and then
[1:39:43] when he gets into
[1:39:47] chapter 5
[1:39:50] the scripture said and seeing the
[1:39:51] multitude he went up into the mountain
[1:39:54] and
[1:39:56] and when he and and and when he was set
[1:39:59] his disciples came unto him
[1:40:02] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[1:40:04] now you have to remember when you come
[1:40:06] when you come to the end of this
[1:40:08] teaching that goes all the way over into
[1:40:10] chapter 6 and chapter 7 the bible says
[1:40:14] all the people that sat around it says
[1:40:16] wow we have never heard this kind of a
[1:40:19] teaching
[1:40:20] we have never heard a doctrine like this
[1:40:23] because there were you were here jesus
[1:40:25] said it was said unto you but now i say
[1:40:28] unto you
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:32] you have heard an eye for an eye but now
[1:40:34] i say unto you
[1:40:38] now this is where he lay out of that but
[1:40:40] let's follow the trend of thought
[1:40:42] because we will find ourselves caught up
[1:40:45] into our subject right here jesus come
[1:40:47] along he opened his mouth and he started
[1:40:50] talking about blessed are the poor in
[1:40:52] spirit for they shall you know for
[1:40:55] theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[1:40:57] are
[1:40:58] they the moon for they shall be
[1:41:00] comforted blessed are the made for they
[1:41:02] shall inherit now he brings out all of
[1:41:05] these beatitudes
[1:41:07] and uh
[1:41:08] and and many of the time
[1:41:11] i i mean i don't know about you but i've
[1:41:13] taken the time to really try to to
[1:41:16] follow the talk and see what was these
[1:41:18] things that jesus was bringing now
[1:41:20] remember that he's teaching now about
[1:41:23] the kingdom of heaven
[1:41:24] you know uh
[1:41:26] on earth he teaching about it and that
[1:41:28] was something that was completely new to
[1:41:31] the to the jews they were looking for
[1:41:33] the kingdom that was promised to david
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] they were looking for the kingdom that
[1:41:39] was promised to david
[1:41:41] where the son of david would
[1:41:43] ruin on the throne and yet jesus coming
[1:41:46] and he's bringing out of this thought
[1:41:48] and then as he gets over
[1:41:51] he gets over to verse 12
[1:41:54] verse 13 blessed i yeah when man shall
[1:41:57] revert you then persecute you and shall
[1:42:00] say a man of evil against you
[1:42:03] falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:42:06] exceedingly glad
[1:42:08] for great is your reward
[1:42:12] praise the lord so
[1:42:14] could this blessing that he was
[1:42:16] pronouncing be a reward to the people
[1:42:19] that would go through that the meek
[1:42:23] blessed are the meek
[1:42:25] could he be talking about some form of
[1:42:27] reward
[1:42:28] that was going to come through the
[1:42:30] baptism of the holy ghost for people
[1:42:32] that would suffer for the namesake of
[1:42:34] christ
[1:42:36] because he gets through talking on death
[1:42:38] and then the next thing he's talking
[1:42:40] about great is your reward in heaven ye
[1:42:43] are the sword of the earth you are the
[1:42:44] light of the world he goes on and he
[1:42:47] says uh uh
[1:42:52] thing that i've come to destroy verse 17
[1:42:55] the loss and the prophet noah come to
[1:42:57] fulfill them he goes down
[1:42:59] and talk
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:04] then you realize he goes down and talk
[1:43:06] and then
[1:43:07] i'm trying to
[1:43:09] to catch another talk here sorry
[1:43:12] i had all of these things lined up here
[1:43:15] kind of for punishing myself a little
[1:43:17] bit
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:21] now so you see he gets down there in
[1:43:26] verse 46
[1:43:33] he gets there in verse 46
[1:43:36] and then he talks about
[1:43:40] if you love them we should love you what
[1:43:42] reward have you
[1:43:44] do now the publicans do the same and
[1:43:46] then he goes down into chapter six and
[1:43:49] he keeps talking about reward and reward
[1:43:52] and reward and reward
[1:43:55] now so jesus
[1:43:57] is is is is uh uh uh uh talking about a
[1:44:01] dispensation
[1:44:03] that is coming upon the word a time
[1:44:07] where god
[1:44:09] is going to associate himself with man
[1:44:12] you have we have to know that god had
[1:44:14] this great plan of redemption in the
[1:44:16] back part of his mind
[1:44:18] amen praise the lord
[1:44:21] it's his plan of redemption but yet he
[1:44:23] have choosed to use man through all the
[1:44:26] ages
[1:44:28] or in the old testament he used those
[1:44:31] men to lay out types and shadow
[1:44:37] of what will be fulfilled under the new
[1:44:39] covenant
[1:44:42] are we together amen now so here we see
[1:44:45] now at the beginning at the beginning at
[1:44:48] the very beginning his first major
[1:44:51] crusade he had
[1:44:54] right coming from out of the wilderness
[1:44:57] after he had faced the temptation with
[1:44:59] the devil the first major crusade where
[1:45:02] he has everybody there on the mountain
[1:45:05] he starts bringing this thought
[1:45:08] of blessing
[1:45:09] a dog that suffer for the gospel sake
[1:45:12] blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:45:15] someone asked brother brandon about a
[1:45:16] polling spirit he said it's just someone
[1:45:18] like lazarus he said you remember
[1:45:20] lazarus that was that was that was uh uh
[1:45:23] uh you know uh the one that was uh the
[1:45:25] the dogs were making his say you know
[1:45:28] his uh
[1:45:29] his the sword on his feet and when he
[1:45:32] died he find himself in abraham bosom
[1:45:35] barbarian gave that as a type of people
[1:45:37] that live poor in spirit you know uh
[1:45:41] it means that they go through one
[1:45:43] affliction and another affliction they
[1:45:44] suffer in their body sickness and
[1:45:47] different things but their faith is
[1:45:49] strong in god
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] praise the lord so jesus is talking all
[1:45:56] of this
[1:45:57] and in another sense he's trying to let
[1:46:00] this these people know that look god
[1:46:04] do not forget our labor of love
[1:46:07] he's making them to realize that
[1:46:10] whatever part that god has ordained for
[1:46:12] you if you walk in that path he will
[1:46:15] reward you for it
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:21] there are some we will see in this life
[1:46:24] and some will go and wait for us
[1:46:27] on the other side
[1:46:32] are we together
[1:46:34] see how he's building his ministry at
[1:46:36] the very beginning of this ministry he
[1:46:39] he's making the disciples
[1:46:42] to have a life of expectation
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:48] you remember whether peter says lord
[1:46:50] what will become of us
[1:46:53] we have left
[1:46:55] churches
[1:46:57] we have left loved ones
[1:47:01] praise the lord
[1:47:02] he says in this life
[1:47:04] and the life to come
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:14] praise the lord amen
[1:47:19] the rewards of things
[1:47:21] that are done in our body
[1:47:26] praise the lord
[1:47:32] and that's the reason why god
[1:47:34] has this dealing with us
[1:47:37] through the stages of grace
[1:47:40] where he justified us and he brings us
[1:47:42] to a place
[1:47:43] where we can be a centrify vessel
[1:47:46] a vessel that is ready for service
[1:47:49] praise the lord
[1:47:51] he can trust you with a trial or he can
[1:47:53] trust you with a duty
[1:47:56] whichever way it comes
[1:47:59] praise the lord
[1:48:01] if we can rightly handle it
[1:48:06] he says there will be a reward
[1:48:12] praise the lord
[1:48:14] now so jesus as he goes along here he
[1:48:18] also starts to make you know uh
[1:48:21] the disciple realize he says i mean you
[1:48:24] you have to be careful now one of the
[1:48:26] reason why jesus said this i was just
[1:48:29] reading that this morning on the
[1:48:31] pharisees the pharisees they were a set
[1:48:36] they were a set
[1:48:37] that came up
[1:48:39] just before john the baptist in that
[1:48:41] four in that 400 years after malachi
[1:48:45] there were a set of religious people
[1:48:48] that came out and they were measuring on
[1:48:52] works
[1:48:54] they were measuring onwards
[1:48:57] your gown has to be at a certain length
[1:49:01] they're curved got to get certain inch
[1:49:06] you got to be
[1:49:07] i mean they were watching of hands
[1:49:09] watching the pots and all of that
[1:49:12] so they were they were very big in those
[1:49:14] things and and and you remember that the
[1:49:16] the pharisees believed in angels
[1:49:20] one of the uh they are they are they are
[1:49:21] teaching about angels they also believe
[1:49:24] in devils that's the reason why they did
[1:49:26] not enjoy john the baptist calling them
[1:49:29] devils
[1:49:32] praise the lord
[1:49:33] amen
[1:49:34] so they believe that in in i mean in
[1:49:37] this physical life if if you know if you
[1:49:40] are wealthy you i mean or you have money
[1:49:42] or something is happening to you it
[1:49:44] means that angels is blessing you if you
[1:49:46] are going through tough time it means
[1:49:49] that demons are afflicting you
[1:49:55] praise the lord
[1:49:56] now so you see
[1:49:58] jesus
[1:49:59] having this crowd
[1:50:04] he says
[1:50:06] chapter 6 verse 5 when god
[1:50:08] prayeth thou shall not be as the
[1:50:12] hypocrites uh
[1:50:14] for the love to pray standing in the
[1:50:16] synagogues and these were the things
[1:50:18] that the pharisees love
[1:50:20] they love to be known as religious
[1:50:23] people people that are on fire for god
[1:50:27] my prayer life you know the boss about
[1:50:29] it
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:35] standing in a singing gas or in the
[1:50:36] corner of the street that there may be
[1:50:38] sin of men
[1:50:40] verily i say unto you
[1:50:42] they have their reward
[1:50:46] praise the lord
[1:50:48] he said verily i say unto you they have
[1:50:50] their reward
[1:50:55] praise the lord
[1:51:06] verse 6 but now when their prayers enter
[1:51:10] into the closet
[1:51:12] and when thou has shut the door
[1:51:16] pray unto thy father
[1:51:20] in secret
[1:51:23] pray unto the father
[1:51:25] in secret
[1:51:27] praise the lord
[1:51:29] now so
[1:51:30] jesus is
[1:51:32] struggling with a taught year
[1:51:34] of talking about rewards and how men are
[1:51:37] seeking rewards and how men you know
[1:51:40] that's that's why the prosperity gospel
[1:51:42] is all about it's all about physical
[1:51:43] reward big cars and big house and god
[1:51:46] will bless me and god will bless you you
[1:51:48] know and he will you will bless you and
[1:51:50] you will bless you it's just all about
[1:51:51] it amen what kind of for what you were
[1:51:53] gold chained or whatever they put on
[1:51:55] themselves that's all the prosperity
[1:51:57] gospel is about jesus is not kicking
[1:52:00] against the idea of reward
[1:52:03] he's not kicking against the subject
[1:52:05] he's trying to show here that the
[1:52:08] preachers of those days which which were
[1:52:11] the mega church preachers
[1:52:13] were wrongly preaching the subject
[1:52:22] now yeah god is going to reward you
[1:52:28] praise the lord help that brother
[1:52:32] he said god is going to reward you
[1:52:36] but it's not going to be in some cases
[1:52:40] a public reward
[1:52:45] it's going to be a secret world
[1:52:51] brother badam said in adoption he said
[1:52:53] he will pull you to the corner
[1:52:57] praise the lord
[1:52:58] he will pull you to the conan and start
[1:53:00] to bless you with spiritual dreams
[1:53:02] [Laughter]
[1:53:05] oh because you dedicate yourself to
[1:53:07] praying and living a clean life and
[1:53:10] taking filtered thoughts from your mind
[1:53:12] god will pull you to the corner and
[1:53:13] start to bless you with spiritual dreams
[1:53:17] and start to send angels to minister to
[1:53:19] you
[1:53:20] it's a reward
[1:53:22] it's a reward of a man that have fought
[1:53:25] battles
[1:53:27] for spirits
[1:53:30] denied himself go sleep
[1:53:32] and wake up in the night and say lord i
[1:53:34] need you
[1:53:43] praise the lord
[1:53:44] while we talking about prayer here let
[1:53:46] me let me get a little breach
[1:53:48] a little parenthesis here i was i was
[1:53:50] reading was i was uh
[1:53:53] it's actually clean is clean in the snow
[1:53:55] yesterday and i was listening to a book
[1:53:58] and uh and this this uh
[1:54:01] this thing came up
[1:54:03] and i decided to go and make some
[1:54:04] research to find it it was a prayer
[1:54:07] or referred
[1:54:09] this is back in
[1:54:11] the 1800s
[1:54:14] a prayer of humbleness
[1:54:20] he used the thought of the of the
[1:54:22] beatitude yes that's what catch my mind
[1:54:24] because that was what was on my mind he
[1:54:26] said oh jesus
[1:54:29] making humble of heart hear me
[1:54:33] from the desire of being esteemed
[1:54:35] deliver me oh jesus it was written in
[1:54:38] latin and he kept it on his board
[1:54:40] he prayed that prayer every day
[1:54:43] from the desire of being the stain
[1:54:45] delivering oh jesus from the desire of
[1:54:48] being loved deliver me
[1:54:51] from the desire
[1:54:53] of being a store deliver me from the
[1:54:55] desire of being honored
[1:54:57] deliver me
[1:54:59] from the desire of being praised
[1:55:01] deliver me
[1:55:03] from the desired of being prepared to
[1:55:05] others
[1:55:07] deliver me
[1:55:09] praise the lord
[1:55:11] oh you can see how i was cleaning snow
[1:55:16] you know how my snow cleaning was then
[1:55:18] i mean i came out my finger was so numb
[1:55:22] because i was so caught up in my mind i
[1:55:24] said oh god
[1:55:25] see the prayer you see the cry of a
[1:55:28] man's heart
[1:55:30] deliver me from being praised
[1:55:33] lord let me go unnoticed
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:49] from the desire
[1:55:51] of being consoled
[1:55:53] from the desire of being approved
[1:56:00] amen
[1:56:01] the desire of being
[1:56:03] despise
[1:56:08] the fear of being despised
[1:56:11] the fear of suffering
[1:56:13] rebuke
[1:56:16] praise the lord
[1:56:19] in another sense he said lord
[1:56:22] let me stay in rebuke
[1:56:25] let me stand rebuke when correction come
[1:56:27] away give me the heart to embrace it let
[1:56:30] me stand rebuke lord
[1:56:35] should not be afraid
[1:56:36] when i'm corrected
[1:56:48] from the fear of being forgotten
[1:56:53] nobody call me
[1:56:56] let it come in
[1:56:59] there i got you a bunch of hypocrites
[1:57:07] praise the lord
[1:57:08] sometimes god will put you in that place
[1:57:13] praise the lord
[1:57:14] is because his eyes are on you
[1:57:17] and he wants you to look at him
[1:57:20] you are looking around too much he wants
[1:57:23] you to lift up your eyes up unto the
[1:57:26] hills
[1:57:38] from the fear of being ridiculed
[1:57:43] from the fear of being wrong
[1:57:45] some people are so afraid
[1:57:47] of being wrong
[1:57:50] they are so afraid of being wrong
[1:57:54] until they can pick up anything for
[1:57:55] their defense
[1:58:00] they are ready to pick up anything they
[1:58:01] are ready to make any kind of a story
[1:58:04] for their defense because they are so
[1:58:06] afraid
[1:58:07] of being wrong
[1:58:12] from the fear
[1:58:14] of being wrong
[1:58:15] deliver me
[1:58:26] from the fear of being suspected
[1:58:37] those people they are two speeches
[1:58:45] you know what this man is dealing with
[1:58:48] he's dealing with inner character
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:52] he's dealing with the silence
[1:58:57] with the silence
[1:58:59] that is inside
[1:59:02] and that's one thing i learned
[1:59:04] we all have silence in us
[1:59:07] because silence is part of god
[1:59:11] but
[1:59:12] we don't we don't use our silence most
[1:59:15] of the time the best way
[1:59:18] when jesus says enter into your closet
[1:59:20] it means go into silence
[1:59:22] go into secret
[1:59:24] silence must be spent with god because
[1:59:27] god is the god of silence
[1:59:31] amen
[1:59:32] he brings the snow he don't make noise
[1:59:37] praise the lord the sun come up you
[1:59:39] don't hear trumpet blowing
[1:59:42] there is no horn that goes through the
[1:59:44] street
[1:59:45] to announce the sun comes up
[1:59:51] praise the lord but you see many times
[1:59:54] people turn
[1:59:56] to the silent within
[1:59:59] when they feel bad
[2:00:03] then that's when they draw to themself
[2:00:05] you will never make use of the the
[2:00:08] god-given silence that god gave you the
[2:00:11] silence that god gives you is a time for
[2:00:14] you and him
[2:00:15] it's it's not a time when you are
[2:00:17] feeling bad and you get out of this
[2:00:19] thought they think they are what they
[2:00:21] think they are what
[2:00:23] it's just a bunch of negative energy
[2:00:29] praise the lord
[2:00:33] that silence is in every one of us
[2:00:36] it's in us
[2:00:38] there is a time where you just want to
[2:00:39] be quiet
[2:00:41] praise the lord you just want to be
[2:00:43] quiet
[2:00:45] and some people think it's a problem
[2:00:47] when you are quiet
[2:00:49] because they are never quiet
[2:00:51] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:01:02] there's a time where you just want to
[2:01:04] draw back
[2:01:07] you just want to relax
[2:01:10] you want to get inside
[2:01:12] of yourself
[2:01:14] praise the lord
[2:01:16] that's the time where god comes tonight
[2:01:20] that's where he comes tonight
[2:01:22] because what he realized now you have
[2:01:24] shut the windows
[2:01:26] you have closed the door
[2:01:28] you're getting into the closet
[2:01:31] and say the lord jesus oh god
[2:01:33] oh lord
[2:01:35] father yeah am i
[2:01:37] i don't know but lord am i
[2:01:39] yeah the thoughts can't even come
[2:01:43] praise the lord but because people are
[2:01:45] afraid of silence the first thing they
[2:01:47] get in their room like the door like the
[2:01:49] window they get on your phone you are
[2:01:51] not stay quiet
[2:01:53] the choir that you are looking for you
[2:01:55] are not quiet you get more busy
[2:01:57] because there is a lot of energy that
[2:01:59] comes from this train that drains your
[2:02:02] mind the brain energy
[2:02:04] when your brain losses energy your body
[2:02:06] is useless that's the reason why when a
[2:02:08] man goes brain dead
[2:02:10] there is nothing they can do
[2:02:15] there is nothing they can do if they put
[2:02:16] all the machine on you and your brain
[2:02:19] cannot communicate the doctors cannot
[2:02:21] help you
[2:02:30] and the devil has brought something to
[2:02:33] send us brain dead
[2:02:39] praise the lord
[2:02:41] amen people that works i mean now i mean
[2:02:43] works are
[2:02:44] uh on a computer
[2:02:47] and i work on the computer i know what
[2:02:48] it is
[2:02:50] i mean you just get tired that light is
[2:02:52] just drawing your strength drawing your
[2:02:54] stream
[2:02:58] so you are told to get up go go and walk
[2:03:01] just get away from it
[2:03:02] just go and walk refresh your mother
[2:03:04] there is there is just so much
[2:03:06] energy that pulls your mind
[2:03:20] the fear of being suspected
[2:03:25] that order may be love
[2:03:27] more than i
[2:03:29] jesus grant me
[2:03:30] the grace to desire it
[2:03:34] what a prayer
[2:03:36] what a prayer
[2:03:39] that a man will exercise himself in
[2:03:42] what a prayer
[2:03:57] main option of this world order may
[2:03:59] increase
[2:04:01] and that i decrease
[2:04:04] is he joined the baptist
[2:04:09] no it's not john the baptist
[2:04:12] but it's the same spirit of god
[2:04:15] the same spirit i can say
[2:04:17] may i decrease
[2:04:20] and let him increase
[2:04:22] praise the lord
[2:04:24] the same spirit
[2:04:26] the same spirit
[2:04:29] that made johnny turn to realize
[2:04:32] that david was the next king
[2:04:35] that he went against his own father
[2:04:38] that's one of the thought i had on my
[2:04:40] note i don't know why i did not write it
[2:04:42] down
[2:04:43] but when when when david
[2:04:47] would call
[2:04:48] uh mashiboshet to the table he was not
[2:04:51] rewarding him
[2:04:56] it was a reward to his father
[2:04:59] because of the kindness of jonathan
[2:05:03] so he's bringing this man to the king's
[2:05:05] table
[2:05:09] he's now enjoying
[2:05:11] the same thing with solomon he gained
[2:05:13] peace with all the nations around him
[2:05:15] because of his father david's
[2:05:18] sake was not that he made deals or he
[2:05:21] fought walls
[2:05:23] he was enjoying a blessing that he did
[2:05:26] not labor for
[2:05:29] that he did not live before
[2:05:37] stop knocking your chest
[2:05:44] praise the lord
[2:05:54] and all of these things i mean i was i
[2:05:56] was uh
[2:05:57] yeah going through that and and and all
[2:05:59] of this uh marty chapter five just just
[2:06:02] brought my mind together on all of that
[2:06:04] so you see
[2:06:05] here let me find a place to close here
[2:06:07] now
[2:06:08] you see so these are the things
[2:06:12] you know these are the things
[2:06:14] that uh
[2:06:15] like we said our salvation is is a don't
[2:06:18] deal
[2:06:20] you as you accepted the lord jesus with
[2:06:23] all of your heart
[2:06:26] praise the lord
[2:06:28] if you accept the lord jesus in your
[2:06:30] heart you accept him as your lord and
[2:06:31] savior god promise you it's a free gift
[2:06:36] but we're not talking about the free
[2:06:38] gift
[2:06:40] we are talking
[2:06:42] about
[2:06:43] the reward
[2:06:46] praise the lord
[2:06:49] the reward
[2:06:51] that we have in this life
[2:06:55] and in the life to
[2:06:56] come praise the lord
[2:07:00] yes jesus starting his ministry on the
[2:07:02] very subject of it to prepare the minds
[2:07:05] of the people
[2:07:07] there is a kingdom that is coming here
[2:07:10] on earth
[2:07:14] the kingdom of heaven
[2:07:16] the kingdom of god
[2:07:18] he said that kingdom is in you
[2:07:22] it's coming here god coming to rome on
[2:07:25] the hearts of his people
[2:07:30] he would take them through different
[2:07:31] things
[2:07:35] and as they submit to him he will reward
[2:07:37] them
[2:07:40] praise the lord
[2:07:42] he will reward him
[2:07:50] wednesday night we read and which of
[2:07:52] course we have looked at that before
[2:07:54] looking at the three
[2:07:56] god-given elements gold savers and
[2:07:58] pressure stones
[2:08:00] and looking at the three
[2:08:02] main me element
[2:08:04] now remember paul says there will be
[2:08:06] trial by fire
[2:08:08] amen
[2:08:11] and if the fire can't turn it god will
[2:08:13] burn it
[2:08:16] but the individual will be safe
[2:08:18] why because you already have salvation
[2:08:21] but everything that he was doing
[2:08:24] was just works
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:29] now so you see paul carried this thought
[2:08:32] let's look in the book of romans
[2:08:35] i will leave you here
[2:08:37] pretty soon
[2:08:38] my time is up here
[2:08:41] romans chapter 4
[2:08:46] romans chapter 4 that's where he brought
[2:08:49] the thought of abraham
[2:08:53] the brother taught of abraham and it's
[2:08:55] and it's a thought it's a subject that
[2:08:57] is normally compared with what james
[2:08:59] said in the book of james faith and work
[2:09:04] romans chapter 4
[2:09:08] you know the scripture there so verse 3
[2:09:10] for what sarah the scripture abraham
[2:09:12] believed god and it was accounted unto
[2:09:15] him for righteousness now to him that
[2:09:19] worketh
[2:09:21] is the reward
[2:09:23] not reckon of grace
[2:09:26] but
[2:09:27] of depth
[2:09:30] praise the lord
[2:09:32] amen
[2:09:33] so paul is saying if you are trying
[2:09:37] to work
[2:09:38] which of course is is more in the place
[2:09:40] of trying to be men pleaser and looking
[2:09:43] for the name and trying to build
[2:09:45] something of yourself he says you are
[2:09:48] just working to pay your debt
[2:09:51] and who can pay the same debt
[2:09:56] you are just working to pay your debt
[2:10:04] praise the lord
[2:10:05] but if it is the grace of god that is
[2:10:08] working through you amen
[2:10:12] amen
[2:10:13] if it is grace that is working through
[2:10:15] you you are appreciating the grace of
[2:10:18] god that is dealing with your life and
[2:10:20] helping you to see this place and oh
[2:10:22] lord and your father i i wish that i saw
[2:10:25] the earlier i'm sorry lord give me grace
[2:10:27] saying you know help me lord and you are
[2:10:29] you are appreciating the grace of god
[2:10:31] that is dealing with your heart and it
[2:10:33] is moving you to different level
[2:10:38] then the reward
[2:10:40] is righteousness
[2:10:44] in that way god counts you righteous
[2:10:47] now that you don't make mistakes but you
[2:10:49] make mistakes you accept your mistakes
[2:10:52] praise the lord you take it to the lord
[2:10:54] and say lord help me give me grace
[2:10:59] god come there for righteousness
[2:11:03] then the person that is always
[2:11:05] justifying themselves
[2:11:09] looking for every reason to be right
[2:11:16] but
[2:11:24] you're just bleeding like a goat
[2:11:26] you're just not saying bad you're just
[2:11:28] saying but
[2:11:29] if you keep saying it you hear yourself
[2:11:31] saying bad just like a god
[2:11:42] are we together
[2:11:45] amen
[2:11:47] do you see the things that god have
[2:11:48] freely given to us
[2:11:52] the things that he has freely
[2:11:55] appropriated to us
[2:11:58] the thing that he has given to us that
[2:12:00] we can enjoy
[2:12:03] embracing the grace of god
[2:12:07] embracing god's grace
[2:12:11] because it's only the grace of god
[2:12:14] that would deliver us from what this
[2:12:16] word is determined
[2:12:18] that our life will be
[2:12:21] praise the lord
[2:12:23] amen
[2:12:26] when people say we are following a man
[2:12:29] praise the lord
[2:12:31] glory be to god
[2:12:34] and the thing that i mean is it's
[2:12:36] it's an old testament thing it's an
[2:12:38] old-timer than you where and you sisters
[2:12:40] you're making yourself look old and
[2:12:42] you're in all of that he carried about
[2:12:44] and said what do you want to say
[2:12:50] now you cannot stand up to that
[2:12:51] challenge
[2:12:54] praise the lord
[2:12:56] you just have to appreciate the grace of
[2:12:58] god
[2:13:01] lord is only because of your grace
[2:13:04] that they can't see it
[2:13:07] praise the lord
[2:13:09] it's only because of your grace it's
[2:13:11] nothing to stand on the housetop and
[2:13:13] start arguing
[2:13:16] let's see let's see the rapture will
[2:13:17] show who is who the rapture will show we
[2:13:20] as well
[2:13:25] what is all of that
[2:13:28] praise the lord
[2:13:31] if you are on the other side of the
[2:13:32] fence you will say the same thing
[2:13:38] praise the lord
[2:13:46] but remember
[2:13:48] that god is rewarding us
[2:13:51] of the things
[2:13:52] that we do in this life
[2:13:56] the thoughts we allow to go through our
[2:13:58] mind
[2:14:00] the way
[2:14:02] the things we give our body to
[2:14:06] he don't forget our labor of love
[2:14:09] praise the lord
[2:14:14] setting yourself even being in the house
[2:14:16] of god the dedication you gave
[2:14:19] to be in the house of god
[2:14:23] to be in the service of the lord
[2:14:29] look god knows the end from the
[2:14:31] beginning
[2:14:32] we have to realize he's a god that you
[2:14:35] cannot impress
[2:14:38] you can't impress god you can't do
[2:14:39] something and he says god wow i never
[2:14:42] thought about it
[2:14:45] you can impress god
[2:14:49] praise the lord
[2:14:53] but you know
[2:14:56] just like
[2:14:57] what eleazar taught in his mind
[2:15:01] and what he said in the backside of the
[2:15:04] desert
[2:15:06] to realize
[2:15:08] that god pick up his thought
[2:15:11] and lay it in rebecca's heart
[2:15:15] praise the lord
[2:15:17] a paralyzed him
[2:15:19] he never had no other option
[2:15:23] god pick up his thought
[2:15:25] and lay it in rebecca's heart
[2:15:30] and that's the thing that please the
[2:15:31] father
[2:15:33] when you can pick up the mind of god
[2:15:37] and the father can see that's exactly
[2:15:39] what i was thinking
[2:15:41] that's the thing that moved god on the
[2:15:43] scene
[2:15:44] and now you're trying to impress him you
[2:15:46] can't impress him
[2:15:49] but just when in all the business
[2:15:54] just to grab that divine movement
[2:15:57] and to know that god put you to that
[2:15:59] place for a purpose
[2:16:01] just to be
[2:16:03] a quiet witness
[2:16:09] and then you were there he said i don't
[2:16:11] even know why i was down there
[2:16:14] i don't even know
[2:16:17] you mean all the time just went by and
[2:16:19] you didn't know
[2:16:21] that you were placed here to be a son of
[2:16:23] god
[2:16:24] to be a daughter of god
[2:16:28] oh were you just sitting down there and
[2:16:30] says i wonder they can see my necktie
[2:16:42] is that why you were placed
[2:16:44] here for people to see your necktie
[2:16:48] you mean a whole 24 hours were given to
[2:16:50] you just for you to show your necktie
[2:16:53] or for you to display your anger
[2:16:59] just for i will show them who i am the
[2:17:01] thing i before i'm going to show them
[2:17:02] what you mean that's why god gave you
[2:17:05] the day
[2:17:08] i thought it was for you to show who he
[2:17:10] is
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:17] let me see your good work
[2:17:19] and glorify your father
[2:17:22] you think about it think about that
[2:17:24] language of jesus lest man see your good
[2:17:27] work and glorify your father in so much
[2:17:30] that you hire yourself that they don't
[2:17:32] even see you
[2:17:35] for you to do good work and take
[2:17:37] yourself from the picture
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:43] let me see your good work now mercy
[2:17:46] you're doing good
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:55] for you to take yourself out of the
[2:17:56] picture
[2:17:59] no just just thank the lord it's just
[2:18:01] the lord
[2:18:03] amen
[2:18:10] oh glory be to god
[2:18:13] you see why god will have a church
[2:18:16] where he will have the preeminence
[2:18:20] you see the people that would make the
[2:18:21] rapture
[2:18:22] the people that put god first
[2:18:26] that give god the preeminence
[2:18:29] putting him to his right place
[2:18:34] that's why god delayed the rapture all
[2:18:36] of these years
[2:18:39] because we were all about building big
[2:18:41] churches and making our names
[2:18:49] but since this is the time where christ
[2:18:52] is going to have the preeminence
[2:18:55] in the people
[2:18:57] there's a group of people that will lift
[2:18:58] him up
[2:19:01] and he said if i be lifted up
[2:19:04] i would draw all men onto me
[2:19:08] musicians you can come
[2:19:26] let's buy our hands lord my heart is
[2:19:28] open

[2:22:41] that has snatched our life
[2:22:44] like david said if the lord has not been
[2:22:46] on our side
[2:22:54] but we can say that the snail is broken
[2:22:57] and we have escaped
[2:23:06] when the holy spirit can come in and
[2:23:08] just expose the enemy
[2:23:12] the things he's planning for our lives
[2:23:14] and
[2:23:15] and
[2:23:17] the things that he want to bring us
[2:23:18] through but the grace of god
