with happy Father's Day so if I don't greet you next week I've already done it praise the Lord yeah so his next one is going to be Father's Day am i right yeah I'm right okay okay so we want to just thank God but I had this thought on my mind I'm going to get out of our bulk of our series and I just wanted to use this stuff you know and just encourage us as brothers sons and daughters of God and just believe in that logo we bless blessed in in helpers this morning I also remember another prayer need as from sister birra and she called me nothing there's a brother back in Nairobi at their church dad I went to be with the Lord so she actually remember the family as well and our sister is helping a nurse that working with the patients and helping the situation that we are dealing with she came in contact with with the Vera so she's away from her children so sister birra is helping the children why the white and the nurse recover so we just want to pray for our sister and also pray that the Lord will be able to bring that nurse true and I spoke with her yesterday she told me the lady is doing well this lady is is recovering so we want a time girl for there and thank God that she can be at the right place and at the right time that our family needs a help praise the Lord so let's just turn to our Bibles first Kings chapter 17 we want to read from here for some you yeah I think I needed praise the Lord praise the Lord in you know when you when you grow up together and you get to know one another life just become so nice you know it's become so easy praise the Lord for some you chapter seventeen let's read from verse one just for the scripture reading now the Philistines gathered together their army to battle and we gather together in Chaka which belongeth to Judah and page between show her and I as occur in infra didim and so in his men and the men of Israel would gather together in page by the Valley of Elah and and there the battle and and set the battle in raid against the Philistines and the Philistine stood on the mountain on the one side and Ezra stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them a valley of decision and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was his cubed and as and he had an helming of brides upon his head and his arm with coats of mail and weight and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze and had Greve of brides upon his legs and the target of brides between his shoulder I mean this guy was wear dress and the staff of his spear was like the weaving beam in his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of onion everything about him is just six and one bear in the shape a share went before him and he is told and cry on to the army of Israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in the red not I a Philistine and year sevens of soul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight me and kill me then we then will we be your seven but if I prevailed against him and kill him then shall ye be our seven and self and the Philistine said I defy the army of Israel this thing give me a man that we may fight together Romans chapter 8 you may have your seat while we read their portion of the world Romans chapter 8 praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 let's read from verse 18 for I reckon they're the sufferings of this present time and not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus what what hope work what comfort from your word the Lord our present suffering in a sense the things that we have to deal with in this age the spirit that are warring against us the things that are on the news they can never be compared to the glory that with us so why should we feel our mind with him why Lord should we get our spirit or wrap up in these things that are just temporary help us Lord we can live for our hair so Godfather because our Redemption draws nigh but Lord also like the Apostle Paul said it can now be compared to the glory that will be revealed in us because the creation is waiting to see that glory and that glory is when we are some daughters of God begin to manifest ourselves begin to live like a son of God like a daughter of God father we just ask him grace this morning Lord come and help us Lord as we approach this word this morning we want to just ask your blessings in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord this morning well if this was a holiday I would dedicate this message to the brothers but maybe you can I won't just speak on a little talk give me the man give me a man praise Lord I'm just trusting that the law would just be able to keep me in a channel of of what I have just like brother Scott said it was good for us to get out there yesterday then invasive with the brothers and we just started talking about few things how to prepare ourselves to come back and we will be bringing you those report when we really establish our thoughts and but moreover what I was really looking forward to that beside the things we had to talk about a really wonderful us to have a time of Prayer like like we did yesterday and and and just like I said we are looking looking forward to more of there where we can come together as brothers as men of the church and have I mean we have gone away from our main Bible studies I mean it's long overdue so and we are hoping also that when we get back to church I was sharing with the brothers you know yesterday morning and I was thinking about it you know you wake up in the morning you try to put something on your mind and you thinking sometimes those thoughts stay on your mind and you try to slip back into into sleep so I don't know why it was it was like a dream right between sleep in a way trying to meditate and I was just thinking about the meeting and thinking about us coming back and it was just like a thought that came back to me the way to come back is the way of Prayer and I appreciate their you know I appreciate their and I felt like it was gold giving me in a direction that is the better way to come back because we can never find our way back if we are not praying so I hope not only the the the brothers you know the sisters the young people most especially we will have time to spend with them in having the prayer meeting not just coming and talking all the things we've been talking they are good we will catch up back on those things but we would love to spend more time in pray I want to start this morning with this little talk from Brad Branham so you can see where I will be heading this morning looking to the unseen brother Branham says we are fighting here tonight a great warfare right against wrong Word of God against modern to logic and trying to make the Word of God or bring it to the people why the enemy will try to be set it in every way now as a church with everything that is going on everything that is going on I mean in the word in the media we have to know that the things that are happening out there they they are more days I mean the go so deep is so spiritual then the newspaper can present it you know the newspaper or the media there will be either appealing to one group or another but we have to know that God has called us to the Ministry of reconciliation and to stand as a mediator mediator don't take sighs you have to stand in the middle and that's what we are called to do that is the only way we can we can get into the ministry of being to intercede for you to intercede you don't take science you have to listen to the both sides you have to bring all the story together sober bellum is giving us a picture year that we are fighting a great warfare and it's one right against wrong and majorly the word the word of God against the present society that we are dealing with praise the Lord the present age did this is the age I call in to Apostle Paul were Satan is the god of this evil age and just like the scripture says he know that his time is over and he's going to do whatever he can to rip our mind apart to to rip our homes apart he's going to do whatever he can I love the way Brennan said here he says we're trying to bring the Word of God to the people and the enemy is also trying to beset us he caused little things to happen and then people question in their mind where is God how can these things be happening to kick us off our faith and get trouble in our mind but that it is that is what is going on praise the Lord so we want to use that realizing there we have a great warfare before us it's a warfare that is between right and wrong and we are living in an in this age where right is no longer defined by God's Word right is defined by popular demand what a piece to the population is right but we know our sons and daughters of God and as Christians let every man be alive and go word with stand alone to be the truth and to be right so if you want to be right you got to take science with God's Word you got to take sides with God's Word if you can't take science with God's Word forget about it your opinion will never be right are we together because I mean actually with this warfare that we are dealing with it goes down to our roots it goes back way back to our roots and that's some of the things that we want to talk about because I believe we have that responsibility to be able to look at these things in the light of God's Word praise the Lord amen I have a you know just just talking to a few brothers you know and and you you talk to people whether out of the country or in the country like I said Minneapolis has got on hair line so that's not your talk you know what's going on in your city and people want to just roll you into everything that is happening you know and you know and I just just have the grace to be able to help them to see it more than the politics because if you don't look at it more than the politics you will never get it right you will never get it right we have to know there's a spirit there's a spirit praise the Lord amen so that's why we want to look at this morning we all know our our story set forth before us that is Goliath and that's when little David would come on the scene but year Israel was standing in the valley of decision remember that they have rejected the leadership of God under the Prophet ministry Samuel they wanted to be like all the other nations so God gave them a king after the heart soul and it was not too long and God would do that all the time he would not allow you to go very long for him to make you to know that your choice was not good for you and not too long yes a Israel is faced with this challenge and the Philistines want to rule him why because the Philistines have been ruling them through the time of the judges they knew that they could break right in dead you know and take their habits and then take their women in and and enslaved their children so I mean they were they were attempting all the time and that's what the devil does you know when he gets us into things and God deliver us he stay come around he remind you of those things he tried to appeal to your flesh because he knew one time he had access to that so he believed that he can always have access to that and where Benham says that is the thing that we must keep under the blood praise the Lord and year is Israel right in this valley of decision a great warfare before them and pretty soon the people are thinking in their mind you know because you have to remember before this time Saul has warned about Oh for Israel before this time the people has enjoyed a sense of his leadership all they saw him on the mountain prophesying with the prophets and and in all of these things but yearís said now the people were looking to see what is going to happen quiet silence all over the place every house was quarantined shut down praise the Lord I will tell you that even the coronavirus is a great warfare it's a spirit has come to just rip the word of joy take the voice of the bridegroom in the music away like in the days of the captivity quietness and this great warfare was standing before Israel and the people everybody talking in the home thinking what to do and even saw a skier for his life but just like the scripture says dear saw I mean Elias - before the cam of Israel and says just give me the man just give me a man what a great challenge and in that challenge also hold a great understanding if he only knew that God's majority is only in one man praise the Lord he was asking for God's majority just give me a man we don't have to share blood we don't have to and and and I'm telling you that's what the word is asking for the word is saying give us a man and man that can solve this problem praise the Lord but the owner man that can solve this problem is the man the Lord as Christ he's the only man that can solve this problem because he has already shear his blood pay the price to redeem the world and he will be the only man that will put an end to this not the Pope no leader he says give me the man a me so we realize if we take this back you realize that back in Genesis back to the beginning God created man male and female created he them in his image that's Genesis chapter 126 we are familiar with that chapter - God took both the male and the female that was created in His image put them in a body form now God was establishing something I put in both the male and the female in the same body all of the headship of the meal before he will let her take out the female what was he establishing he was establishing hashing God was establishing her shape it was an order that God will use all through time by bringing the man for first even though both the man and the woman was created in the image of God but when he expressed them when he manifests them he put the woman all of the headship of the man by expressing the man first in flesh and then bringing the woman out so he was setting an order and all of that he would bless an order that will always prosper before him and you can see how it was he plays Adam there in the Garden of Eden he gives him Dominion he gives power for him to control the earth being an amateur god rule the garden the animals the tree everything God was establishing a principle and he blessed it that way praise the Lord and no sense in there God was manifest in his attribute and the things that he was going to do yeah he was empowering the male he was giving him responsibility to be able to govern to be able to rule to be able to take care of the creation that he has made that's the reason why the Bible says he said let us make man in our image and God made man in His image it keeps saying there over and over because God was establishing a principle praise the Lord the principle of hair shape the principle of leadership and honor this principle that God was establishing he established a man and placed a man to the place word he will be a leader he will be a provider he will be able to manage the thing that a father has placed in his hands and Adam spent a wide in the Garden of Eden he names all the trees and he named the animal and he named all of these things just a form of leadership being a supervisor that's the reason why in a country we have a precedent in a company we had the director whoever is the head there in a little group we have a soup every word as a form of leader can you imagine a world where there is no one we can no one we can hold accountable no one we can Porto what world will be living in God was certain an order of leadership and honor this order of leadership would come great responsibility and I believe that is what we are dealing with because when we fail to to hold ourselves accountable for the place that God had put us and the responsibility that is given to us then we try to start finding excuses give me the man praise the Lord Paul tells us that the creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and what is that manifestation the very same responsibility that God gave to Adam in the beginning that he lost Christ has come to restore us back to that place through the cross through the blood he has shared and giving his spirit back on the days of Pentecost is to bring us back to that place let's look at some of these things this morning as we were just stated together lifting him out of history it seems like the home life is running out into shadow waters it used to be in a home the father the head of the house who sit down of the morning and he will speak with his family and they will all take out the old family Bible and read just a little bit and gathered around the table and have Prayer you don't see that no more and when the day was done and mom had the dishes watch they were all gathered in and read some more of the Bible and pray before they go to bed now you see their their responsibilities of hair shape and leadership that was given to Adam you realize in the Bible that after God gave Adam that responsibility and Eve was brought into the picture the Bible says that God who come down in the cool of the evening to be able to instruct them in his word instruct him in fellowship he will come down after they have gone through their best work and thing they have to do he will come in the evening and you will have fellowship with his children why because that was an expression there was an expression of what was in the father's mind for him to be able to gather with all of his attributes give us a man praise the Lord I mean as we as we approach Father's Day as we think about everything that is happening out there I will tell you the problem of today's society is because we have destroyed this principle we have got away that the family life has got away from this principle and all that is happening out there and everything that is happening in the world today is just show how far our society has gone away from God it sure how much fathers have let down their god-given responsibility praise the Lord I mean for the remnant that is in that is in Israel for the little ones that God is still dealing with your heart let's look at these things in a line of God's Word because if we feel we would get back to the same place church will be a form memory you will forget about those good old days that's how they call it when those good old days and still the same good old days because God is still the same he's not a historical God we are having all the problem that we are having in our society today is because we have left the principle of God we have fell God on the responsibility that he has given us we have left our children to be taught by the Internet we left our children to be taught by society we put our children in the hands of Hollywood to teach them that's the problem we are having because that's there is just no there is no dividing lines there is no dividing lines home life like brother Branham said has run into shadow waters you hear people talking about I mean when we were growing up what happened with when we were growing up and now they'll talk about how their parents brought them up and the things that they used to do why are we not applying in our homes why are we not a planet in this society that we ain't home life is all gone into shadow waters family structure is in crisis but the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God they are people whose life can still make a difference and that's why we are called to be we are called to be their voice we are called to be their voice less people talks about the politics let them talk about everything that is happy now they and bring them back to whom life if a man has a brain to think he would say that is truth bring them back to whom life lets people have all the arguments down there and just bring up a conversation past fathers have filled their songs they have filled their songs instead of teaching a young man how to be respectful the moment he gets 2 years old he lived from his knees and stand up we pierce his ears we put tattooed on his body we start preparing him the Bible says God make man English in His image and he breathed into man for man to become a living soul if we don't have the Spirit of God to lead us in the things that he want us to do we become a beasts not too far from the animals give us a man that's what that's that's the cry that is out there give us a man and looking for the next man to come in office you're looking for the next man to rule the world and looking for the next man that would be the voice there was a man I was hanging between heaven and earth and man I was willing to give his life and yet we would not receive it yet who they would make fun out of it but that was the only man that was saying to be able to solve this word same problem that's what our problem is that's that's the kind of warfare that is before us because it's what our society is dealing with because we have fell on our god-given responsibility we are looking for somebody to blame praise the Lord I'm just I'm just preaching my heart this morning I'm not looking to be famous that's that's that's the burden that is that is on my heart you automatically self amen verbatim saying the message here you him he said a man is not measure but how much muscle he got he says there's a beast I've seen man they weigh 200 pounds and didn't have an ounce of men in them what is what is what is man what is man David asked that question in the Sam he says what is man that you are so mindful of him the scripture use the word and God speaks to the prophets and called him the son of man that has a very deep meaning it has the meaning word God in a way that God express himself because remember this was God saying we make man in our image so that word man does not have anything to do with the width of our muscles or the intelligence of our brain it's a channel where the invisible God becomes visible and he's able to do those things that he desired to do but yet he has a body that he can be able to do them physically what is man that you visit him and the son of man are you liking yourself onto him give us a man 200 pounds and then have an ounce of man in him throw a baby out of a mother's arm I mean man has just now become I mean I mean you're you you have to be the man when when people cease their you have to be the man it just looked like some kind of for control it looks like some kind of you you have to be either our again or you have to I mean you have to stand up and be and just show something completely different from what God designed a man to be man has taken this violent form if you're to be a man you gotta raise your voice a little bit you got to show some physical emotion but remember it was Almighty God making man in His image man was something to resemble God something that is made in the image of another it has a likeness it has a resemblance and when God even before he said let us make man as a spirit God what he did he says let there be light he I mean he created a word he took darkness away I mean he brought life into the earth he created treason and I mean he was doing stuff when he expressed himself he was not destroying and sending lightning and turned out all over the place even before he said let us make man in our image he was being creative he was being productive that was the image that God was forming to express himself in yet this man will go from the hands of God being an amateur creator creating an atmosphere in a home where children will be saved and and and and the wife will be happy and family can come in and go out and be glad that was the form that was the expression that he was expressing himself not violence there was never a man like Christ Jesus never was a character like that praise the Lord well we can say there Moses did not give us a lot about Adam just told us about the garden told us about the falling in this and man fell but God was still not satisfied because all that man has represented through the ages never came close to what was in the heart of God for what a man is so God himself had to come down in the form of flesh to really be able to express what his heart of a man is so he took the form of flesh he never that's a telling years old man dropping down from heaven he came I so baby you know what Luke said about him that he ruled in wisdom and stature in wisdom and stature you look you look over in the book of Proverbs you counted how many times Solomon said my son that's that's the way man is formed man is formed by installing into him godly principles man is formed but that's not girl for me he breathed into man the breath of God is the word of God is the life of God that's not a man is formed by installing the Word of God in him how can a young man david said nor his ways by taking heed to the Word of God that's how man is formed it's not bad that the the new rap music that is outside and the new I mean that it's social warfare how they praise the Lord well it'll be to God I pray that the law would just help us here that's a responsibility that has come to us you think about it look at him a young man like Jeremiah being born in a time where Israel has gone away from God and God has already honor as I am ministry he has already said to Hezekiah how the Babylonians is going to sow so Jeremiah was born right in the time of captivity he was going to be a voice to a people that would be taken in Babylon he was going to be a voice to a people that were already in crisis I know sometimes it looks like it's just hard I mean to to kind of ignore everything that is happening out there I think the right thing to do is to get the right prospective the way you can be able to line your mind to be able to deal with the attacks and the different things that is coming through the society you have to see it that is a spirit of the age what are you like yourself in your house or I mean you stayed away from it's a spirit that is that is it want to a want to rip everyone they want to a want to get every life can you remember the days were there were no cell phones and no computer and people will only turn on Christian radio station just to get away from the politics and get away from everything they would say okay I would get into your house there's no way you run away from this but we have to look at the spirit of the age and yeah yeah are we in this age and God is requiring us to bring forth the manifestation of the sons of God how are we going to do it until we get back on our knees and start prayer meeting in our home and start crying to God to give us a real prayer life until we get back on our knees praise the Lord no man is born and he's just born in his stand-up we all start on our knees crying let's go back to our knees and start crying for there for us to write list and we got a right leg crawl we got to use our knees right lay for us to be able to stand if we were brief for the manifestation of the sons of God we will be son and daughters of God to be able to stand in this age and have the right attitude to deal with all the complex and everything that is out there I mean we got to brand ourselves in prayer I had better Badham said the other day if Jesus how to pray and thusly how much you and myself and man never been more wrong he was staring right in the eyes of his creation all he did was to heal their sick was to save their lost but yet they hated him without cause if Jesus was not praying people he was wearing a cysteine element body this F this bother who have creates a lot of complex in him but he had to subject this flesh to pray he get left the disciples when the Bible said in the early time of the morning he will raise up and prayed he would get up and pray he will leave his disciple you will find a time in the mountain go across the lake be alone concentrate himself because he needed to keep this flesh in subjection to what he was called to do and I believe that is the only way we can bring forth the manifestation of the sons of God that's talking to her brother good brother he called me and talking from one thing to another anything and I quickly saw the street he was going to get us and no I'm not going on that Street brother and I just started telling us hello bruh you have to look at this thing that is a spirit that we are dealing with if we don't look at this thing the right way it would come right in our home and we go to bear with us and wake up with us on the same bed so yeah thank you for you know I like the way you are looking at it I said well I hope God keeping this way because it's a spirit it's a spirit if you don't die yourself about it you wake up in the morning you are angry you don't know why you are angry because a spirit went to you and went went to bear with you and it woke up with you right on your bed and you have no reason to be angry with your wife you don't have no reason to be angry with your children it's all because you went to bed with an angry spirit and you woke up with an angry spirit because you were just feeding your mind with the things from the media instead of meditating on God's Word and putting your spirit before God and say God help me I want to be a son of God the scripture said by one blood God save all man that's what we are Carl toe that's what we are dealing with my to conquer 19 sister 56 where Benham says he was despised and rejected there was no beauty we should desire of him he was mine above every man he was probably a little skinny looking further dealing look like the king many times the people George people by the way the dress or by the estatua man is not George by how big he is or how strong his mother his muscles and man is George by character and character alone that's what a man is it's a representation that's why Paul in Ephesians chapter 5 he says the man like Christ the woman like the church that was what God was expressing from the beginning for her a family where he can express himself true to have a man where he can express his character true as a man as a father as a husband have a woman with where he can be able to express I'll shut that true a woman that can be a breast of one a one that can be a half of compassion he says a mother may forget her second child but I the law will never forget you he want to find a being where he can be able to express compassion true find a man where he can be able to express right judgment rule and man is George by character and character alone I've seen man I weigh 200 pounds and then he had an ounce of man about him man man is George by character what he is in his heart what he is in his heart a heart that is willing to help and Christ was not Josh by physical strain but he was George by character and never a man ever lived like him or never a man who ever died like him never a man who was sent up on high like him because he was God and God made man in His image praise the Lord he made no repetition for himself did you have a thing about it and then I made an artificial I made a repetition and man I made a false teach made a repetition and man I made a wooden I'm made a repetition for himself but a man who made the original I the man who made the original arm made no repetition for himself he become a seven he become a seven praise the Lord that is to think and the bird Bram used a word over and over he says God made man and man made slave why because man was supposed to be a seven the creator of heaven and earth he serve us by creating the Sun to bring our slide the moon by night the trees he serve us that's the greatness greatness of a man to be a seven take the tower and web down the counter be a seven Pelayo say give me a man and a go liar in this age is saying give me a man this loud isha spirit is a go liar that is saying give me a man if you are a man you are a son of God show yourself a son of God it's not by your talk it's now by the yelling and the stretching out of your shoulder show yourself a son of God praise the Lord see what better Branham says wedding supper that's one of our problem he said old brother when they went a weakling a preacher got a meal ticket in veal you ought to have the cross in view and Christ in view to know God's going to make you pay for your little all Sesa fire ways of doing go one man when people go for the seminary a degree of just thinking about it is the the other day people just go down to the county the brain via the their passport birth certificate whatsoever they just go so made himself to the county and the county does not even I mean ask them you know what a you are I mean I I mean you know any kind of a thing about you just bring your document you present everything they give you a paper and you you are now satisfied to marry people yeah you are satisfied to my other people you know so the thing is it's about I mean just have that little paper where you can put your number on a certificate and you stand it two persons there and it says you love you you're loving okay tomorrow it's a responsibility it's a responsibility well you have to set Bob and tell show them the responsibility you are engaging yourself in if you are brain for life on this earth remember that you are just as T was you are just he was the life giver is God he will hold you responsible oh if we will know that or irresponsibility what an age then we are dealing with that so that's the warfare that is out there and what are we trying to do encourage the brothers encourage the families let's go back let's go back let's let's just hold our hands and and and pray it all the young families I mean let's live it together because that's how that's what we are caught oh the manifestation of the sons of God we look at the manifestation of the sons of God we won the healing power we want to be speaking things into existence just it all begins with that character the character of controlling your tongue and controlling your mind young people that's where it begins from their character of dealing with yourself learning as a young man to pick up your Bible in the morning nobody have to remind you because you know that you're not doing it to please your dad or please your mama to please anybody you are doing it because you want to build yourself to be a man together right Josh man you know what I discovered recently we've been reading through the book of pervert it has Terry one chapter a cover the month if you read one chapter every more you become wiser read one chapter every day everyone you just go back one chapter don't you don't have to if you today's work today is the 14th chapter 14 that's what I have to read tonight because I realized I realized I'm a son that needs to make my father a proud father and for me to do it I have to learn the things that he want me to do that's the manifestation of the sons of God it's not just a miracle and in the sighs it's for God to be proud in a way you run your Josh means the way you use your tongue I mean we it's a warfare people I'm just trying to see say it this way just to bring us to that place and realize we have a responsibility even as a church for us to be successful we have to keep to our god-given responsibility we have to we have to I mean steady the world keep ourself in the atmosphere so if even God come and use a preacher to preach the word people come and I mean the one a preacher to just bring things out of the blues are you also meeting on your responsibility are you meeting on your responsibility oh yeah I can just I can just go from from your devotion your prayer life you're reading the Bible your commitment to God I can even go into tithes and offering you've been on time for church all of those things is your responsibility it's all our responsibility for us to be able to get the best from the father we want the best from God and we are slothful on our responsibilities we want our children to turn our right and we are slothful on our responsibility let's do the best we know how to do and God will come and take our back press Lord give us a man at Kadish 1956 we need some born-again Christian men and women who will when they see trouble rising now slip up now fall off now run out this way be partakers of eight but man and women who would stand and show their color what are we standing for staying for the word of God even your friends would appreciate you more if you would do that what man is he that don't appreciate a woman let her be ugh ugly as a fence making modern whatever it is let her be as ugly as she may be but let her be lady and character enough to stand for the woman moral any man now come along would take off his heart of all of our I will I will young sisters that's what we encourage you to dress right you don't have to follow the the faction of the word to ap2 boys just dress right you have to know when God bring you as a woman here he has some hosmer for you work of creation he never ran out let's do right the same thing I mean any woman we appreciate counseling the couple and how do their wedding a few days ago at a home gonna use I mean you you I mean you year year or over there you know the man says I'm looking for a golf hearing woman that's the first question you ask them you know the woman says I'm looking for the golf here remain then I told him I said have you ever thought about it you being golf hearing because you know is it's what you have in us character that we attract the next person that comes towards you you just be golf hearing and God will bring that golf here in person to you the creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that's the time that we are living in give us a man give us a son of God now you see how beautiful this story is Goliath is asking for the man Saul is hiding in his kitchen looking for the place to hide everywhere is quiet but on the backside of the desert God was preparing a man not even counting his age but preparing him by training him training him difficult trials a lie on a bed God was preparing him beating fear out of him I mean he was not playing video games it was a real stop he was out there using his hands working all the boys they just stay home now they abort Elijah I hope you are listening to me I hope you are listening to me son I'm on YouTube every one of you boys David was out there I mean he was using his hands he was learning using his hands and by using his hands he was gaining character naive ignoring what the challenge was his father never came and taught he said local ire is out there you got to start training now let's go in Jacque no but it's the common thing he was doing he was finding things to do by his hands he wake up in the morning he finds something to do something to lay his hands on and by those things he was running he was building character in him he was facing challenges trying to of problem by himself he did not know how to do it he ran and caught his dad and said then I watch you I do but he was trying that's how a man it's made by learning by learning and God was just preparing this boy oh my goodness I mean David you were just there to seeing a lion coming and taking the little sheep what would he do he's turned this waiting and he try what was in his hands and because God was trimming him God had to bless his effort he tried and he killed a lion he felt proud of himself he have done something even though nobody would believe him but he knew that something happening he knew he was in it I mean even if you tried and you in your dream in your dream it's not really even dream that you did something you'll be proud that you did the right thing in your dream but young men just growing to be lazy computer age and we all in our mind and a civil engineer and we're thinking about all of this thing I want to be a pilot rather learn to start cleaning the floor you be a good palette by learning those little things finding a responsibility telling yourself I'm responsible to do this finally something to do wrong Society where the man just feel or is the woman's work to do this is the woman's work to do this is the warmest work to do this and it just in that just turd in their mind that's the manifestation of the sons of God that the creation is waiting for when you can see a young man growing to be responsible a young woman growing to be responsible to learn decency I was I was selling this more last now I just I was just all over the place just have multiple things flowing through my mind I was only talk on the first principle to create to creation this morning and just a lot of things were just flying all over the place and just before I left the house and at first I said to myself oh it's a Father's Day you know I thought about this subject as well yeah that's a goof I love this message go check the calendar it's not Father's Day then I couldn't get myself out of the channel of this stuff so I just preachy but that's the warfare that is before us that is the warfare that is before us that is the things that we are dealing with that's the age that we are dealing with and look these are the very same people that we are praying to get out of that God was saved him like I've always said you know God adding to the church is how much he can trust us to be able to work with these people an age that is I mean they're a population that is all swallowed up in drugs when main thing to be a man I mean you got to be on drugs you got to be high that's why the thing of man is you got to experience that all of those young infant minds and after come out of that first experience that can never turn right again because the devil knows Genesis chapter 6 the Bible says the the mind imagination of man when he can just fall that my concept pollute the mind with Phil teenis with with with violence give me the man that's what Julio acts for and Paul says the present suffering person strive everything that we are going through can never be compared to the glory that awaits you and myself if we take stain for the word of God if we just if we just desire and longed to desire now it's looking at something in the scripture and else I was just thinking about that there are places where the Bible talks about do you know Paul when he talks about the office of a bishop he says if a man desire to be a bishop I was just looking at golly desires I was looking at in the book of Corinthians he says earnestly desire spiritual gifts you know so there are things of our desires that a man can have a desire and God can be so pleased you don't have the ability but just the desire and God can bless that desire and give you the ability just a desire earnestly desiring this thing just like Hanah she was trying to do just to be a mother Lord if you just give me a try I just want that experience I would hand him right back to you just that experience that desire burning desire you know what God did he did not want to give her a chai he said okay let's try to be him get him back I would give you your children but I've made a profit in Israel I would change the course of Israel lying I will bring them back to the Word of God back to the voice of our brain gifts back of revisions once again the people who hear from God because of the woman desire Roop says your God will be my god she have heard so much of what now me said she desire to go with her all the way not knowing what was before her God just blessed that what they desire praise the Lord chapter 12 Teddy Emma all my time so amen don't worry I took a little bit of a coffee so I'm feeling good hey me crazy glory be to God brother Bentham said just one more you Father you mother are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take that television out are you ready to take the deck of cuts of the table then comic books that your children are reading preparing their little mind for a blast that the devil's going to give them are you ready to establish a family altar that's the father's responsibility is this when we when we don't when we don't learn to do it in love and just do it on a good atmosphere when things start going wrong then we want to correct with vengeance it don't work that way it don't work that way it has to start from a friendship and you talk things over and you laugh about things and that's the way we help the young people and now with a straight face and across I and you talk with them I mean yeah yeah into an age that is completely different from the age that you were born in in your time that you grew up they are supposed to things that we have no idea of we will never be successful if we want to I mean if we want to treat them in you know and and and fast with them in you will not be you will not be successful you go down on your knees and start praying repent to golf on that they are not standing up to our responsibilities I believe that a young woman first boyfriend should be her dad oh I'm going to bring something to up this morning I just I just I just decided to keep it for another time I'm waiting for that church to finish these young people and myself we go into John me to wait we're going to have a good time praise the Lord amen are you ready to establish an old-fashioned altar again and do you just want to continue on that way you are if you want to continue you are not in condition of coming yet but I pray that you be like something you see the price and you are ready Lord let me die with him he knows if God answer his prayer what was growing what was going to cuss many people I have seen him right since I've been here come to the altar and the Holy Spirit come to them and they don't want to die but I'm talking about seeing God dealing with people and they stare struggling they don't want to submit to God they still struggling trying to fold themself from the hands of God and God is dealing we'll be a heart that's his love to you that is his love to you if God is dealing with your heart just just lay your heart before him just cry say God I just I just I just gave my heart to you I can't help myself want to stay alive in the word stay catch up with all the different things there they don't have a scheduled devotion for themselves but again be a special movie they are watching by series some kind of a Chinese love story when you have the greatest love story before you you can save two girls at the same time you are you are you ready to forsake everything instead of gone I mean we can go on and on and on but I'm just trying to grab us into this channel this morning what am I talking about we have a warfare before us we have a warfare physically our city went into flame that's just a physical manifestation of what is happening in the spirit of what is happening in a spirit and if we had just captured by the physical things and he just work on our flesh what what he brings to us what what what is there the fruit of the flesh when we give our flesh to it you only produce the fruit of the flesh bitterness anger you know RAF we we just so be so bitter and there we get out of our expression it's our responsibility when these things are happening pull your family together and starts to pray direct our tops don't get your mind into where all the politics and seeing young people I mean I mean it's it's your freedom you can express what you want to express you know but it's good to learn our thoughts because that giant outside they we don't have no match for him just like Ezra then I had a match for go liar we don't have no match for him but when God can bring the man Christ out of your life if he can bring that little David your little fake a little desire to do right and see the right thing and God can anoint it for you to be able to fit the deme that is out there that is what the creation is waiting for that is what the creation is waiting for lets people go crazy I talking to a friend at work people go crazy I mean talking about I just go just talk about little things I said look it is our responsibility as parents it's our responsibility because it's our children that are out there it's a sign that we are we are filling our neighborhood we are filling our community because if we were training him right in the line of God's Word creation waiting on a manifestation of the sons of God that's a great warfare between right and wrong the Word of God against the modern idea that is out there and Satan is doing his best to be said you and myself to get what besetting does it get us off course when a musical instrument is beset it's out of tune it just make noise but it's not giving the right sound and what we need we need to be told by God and a way to do it is to be tuned in prayer give us a man I mean we can get on our heart get on our knees and you starts to pray and even think about all the people out there that are hurting all the people out there you know that that are trying to make their voices to be heard and you can just cry to God oh god help them help them if you can stand in the bridge let your voice be heard in heaven let there be a voice in all the noise God can look down in your little chamber and say I'm listening to that voice he's saying God be merciful how many souls life have to be lost let's just power here we just trying to encourage our self the creation is
