lord and uh so suddenly right after the service i got a call in the morning before i left home that she was rushed to the hospital and i think that was just in time when her body went into shock so when you rush her over to the hospital the doctors knew that uh yeah the the the situation was was uh really at the place uh to really get it under control most especially with the weakness of her body and uh and also the fairness of her body so they asked the family to come and spend some time with her before uh she would cross his life so uh all during the service i was trying i was talking

on our house lord that we would love to share tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed i take a little talk tonight that i entitled last birth when i then in the hospital i got there uh uh met uh dan and his wife and and you know children did and and uh going into roman and ignoring that that uh that that could have been a situation that could happen at any time and like like the doctor said so i told them you know this is just like running to the hospital and waiting for a child to be born you know we run to the hospital and every everybody is anxious waiting for the child to be born we are we are praying oh god you know uh uh you know and you are waiting you are waiting and you are waiting and you keep waiting and then and then suddenly you hear a baby crying oh yeah the baby is here you know and uh and it's it's also the same when you have to wait for one to pass this life you keep waiting you keep waiting you keep waiting and uh uh uh the the the haha on the um on one of these uh machine you know helped to help beat uh you know move her heart and all of that but then yet life was slowly going away from the body and and then the nurse came in and told us and said uh i mean it could happen anytime and so we were there then the lot then then the nurse came later or the first time she came she came with some of this little tube you know something with some words rating on it and she said uh uh you know she gave it to i think to one the granddaughter or something like that and she's in this in this little vibe is uh uh some of you my your grandmother's last birth so that's what i took my subject from tonight and [Music] so and while we were dating and yeah then finally they announced to us that she has passed brother branham said this in the message it shall it shall even be as i told as it was told me now so i'm i just took a phrase here to be able to give my subject but uh uh what what the scene was with this with this i'm about to read just a sentence here what the scene was there was a baby that uh that that was dying so the the mother called one of the sisters in the church and uh i i i don't think she was not in the tabernacle but she called one of the sisters in the tabernacle and and they got brother branham on the phone and and it says brother brandon you know this this baby is dying can you please pray and ask the lord you know be merciful but very much he says well okay i'll pray and he went praying and asking the lord and you know and and then he broke into a vision and saw that the baby was alive so he gave the babe he he gave uh uh the sister the call and said sister thou said the lord the baby is not going to die the baby is going to live then the mother said is the mother that said this few words she said oh about five minutes ago we were watching for the last birth she says about five minutes ago we were watching for the last birth and that's how i felt when we i was in the hospital i was watching for the last birth praise the lord so we want to talk a little bit on the last birth tonight we pray that the lord will just make it a blessing amen let me read this now now question and answers here he said i was at a friend house yesterday a christian home where there was some young christians gathered and i was talking to them and something just presented itself to me and i thought of how i was looking into the wolves and and around the trees and see them dying i thought how pretty those trees are even though they are dying that is almost about fall or something like that winter coming in yet they are pretty and sometimes a tree looks better when it's dying than when it then when it is in the greenness and bits and i wonder if there's just if that just wouldn't picture out our condition to our heavenly father for he said pressure in the sight of the lord is the death of his sins how that much beautiful thing for the father to look down upon his children coming home to him and holding his position in christ coming home and holding the opposition in christ so i i got to the bad side and i was i was trying to i was holding sister mimi henson and i was trying to rob her hands and you know like brother branham said he like he did to his mama and says mama do you still love the lord he says mama couldn't talk but you could see the tears coming down her eyes and i felt like she said yes i love the lord mama are you ready to go home and he says then more tears came down i felt like mama said yes i'm ready to go home but you see sister mimi didn't know how to experience that because uh her system was so affected until it even affected her brain yeah it even affected her brain so we were just did uh watching but the nurse the nurse said uh the nurse says uh uh uh shikuya you know she says uh the only thing that might be working now is is her hearing and uh uh you know and all of that but like brother branham said here he says how beautiful a beautiful thing for the father to look down upon his child coming home and holding his or her position in christ his faith his confession i'm saved by grace i'm saved by the grace of god and stand there in the hour of death praise the lord yet we can hold our position we are safe and i believe that our father loved the guiling trade and believing and holding our testimony and it's just acing to testify when you are feeling good and healthy and strong is when you are down weak in trouble there's where your testimony counts amen praise the lord amen amen you know a child sister maybe was someone a few words but you really get to yell her talking when you visit visit her at the house you know every time i would go to visit she had a lot of questions you asked you know and we were talking and uh and you know and just fellowship she was a woman of fight you know uh and and and a prayer warrior too you know sometimes i'll i will go and visit she and brother jambibi just just to pray with them and more more likely to have them pray with me praise the lord now so uh uh you know just like i said you know it's it's it's it's like the anxiousness of uh waiting for life to come into this earth i believe this that's what the the psalmist meant when he says pressures in the sight of the lord there is anxiousness on the other side you know when when it's announced that one of the saints are coming home there's anxiousness uh to to to meet them praise the lord that's how precious it is it might not be precious to us on this side but it's precious on the other side very precious praise the lord amen and so there is something you know uh that is that is that is beautiful about life it just had to be something that god created it's just it's just so beautiful when you just think about everything let me just share another quote here with you brother branham now in this one he's he's talking about we read a few quotes about last birth but in this one he's going to talk about a young sister that just thought she had it all together you know being sassy and you know trying to live the best of her life she's a year in the message particle he says and i found out dear friends that men mentoring will now stand when you are coming down to your last birth of this body and this life is good to live by those things but you can die by them praise the lord man material many inventions and all of that i mean uh your your smartwatch can be able to tell you your your pause it can tell you how many steps you have walked he can tell you your heartbeat praise the lord but when that heart is about to stop he can never have it to beat another time again you know so all of these things they are good as we use them he says i guess in my ministry my age in the ministry i have probably stood by many dying people as anyone of my age because i have been much called on to the dying praise the lord not long ago a certain young lady in our city had had received the baptism of the holy ghost she came she came up to the tabernacle another young lady in a city very popular belonging to a modern type of a religion that denied the blood and the covering and said that we were a cut and a bunch of holy roller because that we believe in the saving grace of christ if that's if that's what it takes to be a holy ruler then yeah you count me in amen and then i'm one of them i believe in the blood amen this young lady [Music] she went on to dance and show and she and she was a sunday school teacher in their church and and the church denied the blood of christ and there was no such a thing the pastor said he says it dry 1900 years ago so they believe in this spiritual gospel and by and by the young lady got out with some boy and uh fine looking lady this uh uh little girl come up to the tabernacle she kind of addressed which means the sister now in church that's what he's talking about kind of address all factions she used to go down the street and she would let she and and and her hair come back just as tight as she can get get it without these you know whatever he called it yet and ever watch stuff that they wear down on the street he said yes that's the truth we teach against that he says god will make you pray in your ways pray the age as prayed it does as i was saying but even our holiness churches are letting them praise the lord you know that's the truth you better come back to the old hailing line again back to the gospel now we see with all of these things i mean uh uh just this other few days uh just this gone weekend uh i was just thinking about you know the weight behind what the apostle paul said when he i mean what he meant when he said perilous times shall come praise the lord i believe that uh a parallel time is upon us perilous time is upon us not too long we would think we were speaking about uh uh the diagnosis of the age and brother branham talking about uh how this age uh being described by jesus christ in revelation chapter three that uh the blind and and don't know what they then they are naked you know it's it's all the mental condition you know uh a mental condition that the church is losing its mind and and we see those things and and in the way that people try to think that they are not losing their mind is in a way that they think that they are trying to be they are trying to be modding they are trying to be you know they are trying to catch up with the time you know they are trying to uh catch up with the faction and catch up with what you know and all of those things but you realize that when you look around our cycle and you look around the you know the people the head of the banner of jesus christ you'll realize that things are happening that you cannot even imagine we have bunch of divorces sweeping into the church and people leaving their wives and leaving their husbands and different things just happening you you actually said how did we get here yeah yes brother that's right praise the lord that's right you answered how did we get here you realize that uh all of these churches when the pastor come up and say i don't believe the message that they are very nice they are very dang you see how young people just go wide go to potted and and and all the young girls that were that were being protected by the word [Music] now the lord that uh you know the lose the the virtues of their lives praise the lord you ask yourself how did we get to this place but it's perilous time that is upon us praise the lord the people are getting high-minded and all the thing there is that i'm just following my heart that's the way to say it i'm just following my heart i'm just doing me that's how they call it but it's perilous time it's the last spirit that is on them look you cannot you cannot beat this last spirit how how how can i overcome brother branham says just like every age god the god the he says every uh uh uh uh uh following age every age that succeeded from the other got the reward of the age that they that they succeeded from he said that's the same way the age that is succeeding also got the the forces that came from the ephesus age went down to the next so all the demons that fought the church right from pentecost we are dealing with a right here the spirit of ananias and sapphira the spirit of the sons of cephas out of those spirits we're dealing with right here in our day right here in the message praise the lord the bible says write that in the book of arts you find that other simon the sorceress he was just only looking for firm he wanted to be part of the part of the minister part of the ministry we have all those things right right here in our day right here in the message because it was in that move of god it has to be in this move of god he says even the holiness people are letting down praise the lord they're gone from the prayer meetings and waiting on the lord and and fasting and praying and all we are about is yes uh you know uh shapes and forms and colors and whatever it is but let's let's just stay with this thing tonight and no face this young lady she just carried on everywhere went out dancing potted and so far and and then she took shake she got of an her disease and was too far gone try some shot but it did not work and when death struck the girl she began to get uh hysteric now her mind started going now that if you read this you realize that and and you read on this subject you realize that brother branham says when you get to that place of your last birth that's when the reality of life sinks in things becomes more real to you quickly you realize that you have wasted your time quickly you realize that the dance the fun and all of those things you were doing were just waste of time praise the lord you see we are living in the shadow we are living in the negative and when you get closer to the positive then you start to realize the real you the real thing that wait for you on the other side praise the lord she started shouting the first thing she said the first thing that she said was she started calling for that other girl the one that have gone down to the tabernacle and got the holy ghost because she used to tease her so she started calling for that girl and now when she when she asked they thought she was sending for her sunday school teacher she said no i'm not that's not what and the pastor came quickly and trying to comfort her the first thing she said you deceive her you lied to me that's right get out of my room why she was at her last birth she was at her last birth praise the lord and she said you deceiver of man i'm lost i'm going to hell because you taught me dead and they get there and went out to meet god crying for the girl that had tried to tell her what was right look brother and i will say sisters when you come down to the end of this life journey you will reach you have lived a holy clean life before god be sure to remember that amen praise the lord because you realize that there is actually there is nothing really matters what really matters is the god that brought us here you realize that nothing really matters if you get there on that bed and and and i mean you you can you can even dance to the music that you love you can't even uh uh i get a smell of the food that you love no taste for the food that you love and and then and all the clothes are hanging there and you can't even wear it then you realize that nothing really matters he said you wish you have lived a holy clean life before god be sure to remember that and i hope you young people remember that now now about your church that you be long stole that doesn't mean nothing to god praise the lord amen all your stance and all your your your your your doctrine and this for you cut this person off and you caught that person or you realize it does not mean anything to god it's what's in your heart that's right god i'm going to ask you whether what church you belong to is what in your heart is what god is going to look at praise the lord we get to that place of our last birth when the the countdown is on and you just have a few minutes praise the lord like that lady said we were in five minutes we were just watching for the last birth but when brother branham gave the doubt said the lord it just flipped around and the baby became well but you see that's the way it is we on this side we are watching for the last birth but in five minutes that person just slept on the other side right in the presence of god and they are alive they are not sick they are not held by sickness praise the lord thank you lord jesus look these things are not stories they are not brother random stories that he wrote in kentucky these things are reality praise the lord it's reality amen the church israel in the church he says some of these days when the last birth is leaving our body i want to run down to the river and chase get away jordan and i was reading this and there's a song that was playing in my head praise the lord amen i want to run down to the river and says get away jordan i'm going over to see my lord i believe the morning star will come out down through the valley of the shadow of death light light of the weight and the holy ghost with stretch to grace's wing across the jordan embed our weary soul to a better land because the shallaine beyond the river praise the lord amen just like we had our first birth and we brave and then we cry out yeah yeah like the baby does one of these days we will have our last birth and then we will pass this mortal life and go in the presence of the one that brought us here but bam says brothers and sisters that's not that's not myth there's actual fight we don't know what time we are going and you will not have a chance after that last birth leave your body make it right now don't wait till the morning maybe too late praise the lord and as we we all stood there and talked to the family a little bit and just just asked to encourage them and you know uh and that machine you know that she was she was hooked to there was was kind of moving on hot but actually because i've tried to look at it and you could tell that it was you know it was it was just it was something that was that was net that was not real because they kind of switched all the you know all the little monitoring everything you just switch it off because the doctors knew what was happening praise the lord they knew that life was going out slowly and and when the the nurse came in the room and you know just gave us the last word we were in the room but they were they were also on the other side just monitoring everything and just seeing how things were happening you know so and it was you know just just standing the heading and you know uh for the nurse to say she's gone you know it was it was one of these things where you just you just you want to grab the sight of it i was just standing there and you just want to grab your side of it this is there she goes praise the lord but actually it was precious to to witness one cross in this life especially when you know that that is a believer you know that that person has lived their life for the lord you know sister mimi and and brother steve young baby like i said here before they were the first people that did receive the message in liberia uh when the brother took the message to liberia and uh and and and then uh at the time some of peter in uh uh new york connecticut there was was a youth pastor in the in the in the pentecostal church the word they were and that's that's just how the the took the message to him and it kind of created a wildfire because the upper room bible church at that time was uh was really it was a kind of a holiness church you know a church that really believed in clean living you know and and write in the address called and they believe in the gift of the spirit and all of that and but now for them to realize that uh uh you know uh uh they really didn't have uh you know the the baptism even uh water baptism right you know i mean it was it was just like mind blowing to those brothers and many of them many of them like that came out of the the some of the malachite and and many of them came out that was just how the message started in liberia and then we were then the next bunch that came to the faith so i mean they were they were very precious to me they were very precious to me and we just want to thank the lord for the life of our sister so like brother branham said it's not a myth it's it's it's an actual
