lord exeter chapter 23 thank you musicians you may have seen exodus chapter 23. exodus 23 praise the lord praise the lord let's let's just read verse verse 20 23 verse 20. i can't get my pages out praise the lord amen okay i think i guess getting him problem here exodus chapter 23 let's just read read from verse 20. behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place where i have prepared i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place where i have prepared praise the lord now you have to realize that is the angel that is doing the keeping is the injured that is doing the bringing amen is anger that is also placing you in a place that he have prepared now what you have prepared but what he have prepared beware of him obey his voice provoke him that for he will now pardon your transgression for my name is in him praise the lord but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemy and anniversary on to thy adversaries for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in on to the amorites the hittites the parasites the canaanites the harvites and the jebusites and i will cut them off amen let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we want to thank you again that we have the privileged lord to be able to read from your sacred word father god this we believe it's an inspired word father that you'd inspire men to to have wrote lord father god is not like the culture trying to teach us lord it's not a word of man's opinion it's your word and that's why we need all of your help this morning that we can be able to to say something lording and that will that will be your financial internal value and blessings to your children help us this morning god we commit ourself in your hands in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat this morning uh uh this will be uh my new year's message i i'll be speaking on the angel of the exeter the angel of the exeter praise the lord the angel of the exeter praise the lord amen there were some there were some few things that i i thought we would look in to this morning on this subject but uh uh i will i wouldn't i might not be able to go into it but i would just i would just want to take this and uh and and encourage you as we uh uh we have gone almost 10 days into the into the new year uh and uh we are having expectations we are anxiously you know trying to grasp into the year to see what it will be we can only hope that uh it will get better amen we can only hope that it might get better but when we look at prophecy and we look at a lot of the things that are happening in the rhinos the only promise that we have as children of god is to get ourselves ready amen is to get ourselves ready to meet the lord amen whether by the weight of the rapture or whether by the way of the grave we have to get ourselves ready we have to live every day as if the law was coming the next meeting and we should also make plans for our future go to school you know uh build your houses you know change your car or as you your car will break down the road and the call will give you problems praise the lord amen we must we must plan our future but we must have our soul so ready because anything can come upon us praise the lord amen and we know what uh you know what the accident was to the children of israel so we want to talk about that a little bit you know uh uh god taking his people to the promised land amen taking them out of bondage out of the egyptian bondage and carrying them over to the promised land but what i want to do all my inspiration on is the one that is leading this exeter praise the lord that's the one out that's word i want to make my emphasis because the same one that led that exeter is the same one that is leading this exeter praise the lord amen and there is something about ignoring your leader if you know your leader praise the lord then you can learn to know how he's leading you and where he's leading you praise the lord now if you have a leader or you think in your mind that this man is the leader amen and uh and and where you try you try to take your inspiration or your instruction from him when actually there is another one there there is the leader you your son you also found out that you will start having conflict praise the lord you assume founder that you start having conflict well someone is sending ntc did i greet you yes i did i can forgive my own mother-in-law okay so uh [Music] so we realize here that god has always use men for that is the purpose that man was were created man was created to be god agent to be a partner with god he says let us make man in our own image praise the lord and right on god have used men [Music] for for different purpose and and god through the ages we know about moses and abraham our father the patriarch we know about joseph how god sent him down to egypt to be able to prepare for for the children of israel and and all of that so god have always used man praise the lord but god has always been in control you know when god raised up a man or god gave a man an instruction or a responsibility he don't leave that man to himself no he gave the man the the responsibility to do a setting work but he's the one that is in control he's the one that is leading praise the lord he is the one that is leading now we know uh uh back to our scripture reference here we know that this whole exeter a story about coming out of egypt we know it goes all the way back to abraham we can pick it up from there but the the mission the exit of mission of coming out of egypt and getting over to the promised land we know the whole scene starts from exodus chapter 3. praise the lord and in exodus chapter 3 the bible says and and god fought a way to be able to get moses attention praise the lord and the way he did it was to calm down in the form of a light in the form of a burning butch praise the lord make no mistake it was god in the form of a light are we together it was god in the form of a fire the bush was on fire the bible says our god is a consuming fire it was not just a fire that god spoke through it was god are you kidding me amen it was not just god allowed the bush to be on fire so he can talk through no it was god in the form of a burning fire amen praise the lord that's the god we serve and i'm saying that to say that it must not be difficult it must not be difficult for us to believe that this almighty god we self can be able to humble himself it must not be difficult it's difficult for you and myself we struggle to humble ourselves but not god amen and because he's the creator he can make himself whatever way he wanted amen people struggle with theology to believe that jesus was god that god can be men it's the problem is with you and myself we struggle to humble ourselves all because of the same nature of pride but not god let me prove it to you this let me prove it to you do you know that god humbled himself to come by your bedside this morning to wake you up you think it was your alarm clock carry your alarm clock to the mark [Applause] take an alarm clock to the mark and see if it will wake those people up that's the god we self that's the reason why the joy in serving god is fine in humbleness that's the secret of god if you want to know him that's how you will know him you will have to humble yourself humble your thoughts your idea praise the lord you don't believe that god woke you up this morning do you have problem with that amen if you really have problem with that you should pray tonight and say lord don't wake me up praise the lord sincerely do it i will meet you on the other side are we together praise the lord but that's that's god he came down to be able to get moses attention and when he grabbed moses attention he told moses for i have come down that's right i have come down and i'll go with you and you know and we know the story there about exodus chapter three and uh uh you know and and you know that's that's what the exodus that's where it begins and moses we know the story he went down there and and you know and when moses went down because he was commissioned by god he started speaking with a personal pronoun let my people go amen he brought the message of god to the egyptian but he was talking to to pharaoh let my people go and uh you know and we we know all the story the play came and everything and they got on their way but because god have used man in in the exit and in all the great delivery we know about something you know his strength we know about david his uh his his military knowledge you know the the the strength he had to bring goliath down and all of these men of the scripture because god have used them in extraordinary way sometimes it's high you know the the the the the him and she covered the fact that it is god that is doing the work praise the lord and where we struggle sometimes and and which of course is obvious because god is a spirit amen and and and uh and uh being humans we we we have contact with our five senses you know so it's it's uh it is easy for us to follow a one that we can see praise the lord and that's the reason why god will always bring us a leader he would send us a preacher he would send us a a prophet he would send us a you know a deliverer he will always use a man but the thing there is that he is the one that is leading he is the one he is the leader praise the lord genesis chapter 3 prove it to us when god came down he met adam and eve in their situation praise the lord brought a a alarm in and and and redeemed them back to himself praise the lord and the bible says he led them out of the garden of eden but he was the one that was leading he rubbed them in the sheepskin to cover the the shame and he led him into the wilderness i mean out of the garden of eden sorry but he was the one that was leading praise the lord now look here he led them out of the garden of of eden they went out of the garden of eden king killed abel god was right there and said king what have you done he did not send them and say okay your goal because the evil you have done your goal i'm going to stay right here in this eating i made it to stay right here no they went out of eden king and abraham made a sacrifice god came down he honored abel's sacrifice he refused king's sacrifice can't care ever god called king to justice why because he was always there he was always there he was he's he was always there he's the one that is leading danger of the exeter praise the lord amen god will always get a man in his hands but he will not leave us in the hands of men praise the lord no he will not leave us in the hands of men because uh uh the arm of flesh will fail but the arm of the lord will never fail praise the lord the alma of the lord will never fail now you might you might have heard uh this and now that's that's what i wanted to go into but uh i would not you know i would not uh they're going uh drag you into there because it would take me a little bit here let's just read uh uh just a few quotes here this is from give calling in repentance 1950. praise the lord from an angel shall go before thee moses did nothing moses did nothing for the matter of fact he was a runaway soldier amen a man that was scared to death they have killed an egyptian straight into the wilderness and he changed his career you know from a military general he became a shepherd never want to do nothing with that it was the angel of god is that right what what did it looks like that led israel a pillow of fire by night and a cloud by day praise the lord i believe he's still leading on praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah we uh you know we we we we thank god for for great men that he had raised up you know we thank god for the fightful ministry that he had given to us pastors evangelists teachers and and all of them we thank god for a prophetic message that he has given to us but the one that is leading the angel of this exeter is the lord jesus christ praise the lord is the lord jesus christ so you see when people when people start having problem with the message and they start having problem with the messenger to go back to the wall to make it an excuse to go back to egypt they didn't know the leader they did not know the leader of this accident praise the lord why was koran and dayton and all of those people arguing in the wilderness why because they knew something about moses amen they knew that he was a runaway soldier so they could find all of his fault but the error they made was he was not the leader of the exeter the leader of the exeter was the angel of the coveted it was the angel of the coveting praise the lord so they can bring out moses fox they can go and gather the people talk against moses and all of that praise the lord while we humans is hard for us to learn praise the lord amen they did all of that and god came down we know the story he brought the judgment opened the earth swallowed quran and dayton and his people praise the lord just to be able to witness to the congregation that this man moses he's just an etude in my hand i am the leader praise the lord i am the one leading this exeter and that's what i want to say to you and encourage you as we're going into a year that we don't know what it's going to bring amen last year 2020 we begin the year like this never knew that we would have gone uh about 10 or so months with max on our face we don't know the next one whether that uh you know sheet or combat will be wearing over our head but whatever it is let's know who is the one leading us praise the lord amen amen moses never did nothing it was the angel of god that's right and he was the one that led israel by the pillar of fire by night the pillar of cloud by day i believe he's still leading on we know that was the angel of the coveting is that right it was the lugas or christ amen christ the logos is the sin the christ means the anointed one that's what we talk about false christs and but the lord god was that light in the beginning amen in the beginning that light when god the great internal god condemns himself to take a form so you see right from the beginning even in creation he led creation he led a life in eden he led a a a enoch into a rapture he led noah through a flaw he led abraham to a land whose maker and vader is god he's always the leader [Music] he's always the leader and he's the one that is leading today praise the lord he's the one that is leading today and that's the reason why we must keep our eyes on jesus for he is the altar and the finisher of our faith praise the lord we must keep our eyes on jesus as much as we appreciate men we must keep our eyes on jesus look around the church today when people will make excuses why they would not go to church and why they would not serve god what do they use to make excuses oh this other pastor did this oh the people in the church did this it's just all human element why can't you realize that men will fail so you have really never come to a true experience when you're using failures for the reason why you will not set a god that will never fail [Music] praise the lord people going into uh becoming eight years and and all sorts of things and you know blaming christians people that call themselves christians they are doing this they are calling themselves you just limit yourself you've been keeping your hairs down live for your eyes because he is the angel of the coveted that's the god we serve amen and like i said before that's the greatness of our god like paul says great is the mystery of godliness great is the mystery of godliness that the great god that we serve can make himself into into the form of his very creature god now wanting to leave his creation to man that is limited look he's the god that has the plane he he playing all of these things from the foundation of the world he has the blueprint in his hands praise the lord he has the plan of every dispensation every generation so he cannot just leave it to man no matter how deep that man is to god how much god revealed to him we will stay calm shut because god be with us by dispensation but he has the whole program in his hands praise the lord amen now if moses was the angel of the exeter the children of israel was going to perish when moses went on the mountain and said goodbye amen praise the lord when he walked on the mountain and said goodbye he looked over to the promised land and the bible said he said goodbye the angels took him away they were going to they were going to perish they were going to perish but the bible reads that after the seven of the lord moses died god rose up another man by the name of joshua praise the lord amen and that is the same thing we have however people claiming joshua ministry no it's the same angel of the covenant that is the reason why before joshua could step into his commission that same angel that was leading the children of israel in the form of pillow fight and pillow of cloud he came in the form of a man amen and joshua drew his sword and said are you for us or are you against us he says i'm the angel i'm the angel of the covenant joshua bowed down because he know this is the leader praise the lord that i will tell you that joshua was properly taught by moses because if joshua was not taught by moses he would be so greedy for power and since i'm the one that is in charge he would have been as stubborn as balaam when god was speaking to him he was even warring and arguing with god it shows that moses taught joshua that look the one that is leading us the one you see going over the cam in that form of light is the almighty god praise the lord is the almighty god he's the angel of this exeter you know that is the reason why we are setting we're going to make it amen great men may fall man with great ministry may fall and get out of the way but we are setting because we know the one that is leading or he knows the way. praise the lord amen just like god use moses god use great men praise the lord god used the prophet of god for this hour and that's where just like i said people are making their mistake found in little thoughts and and you know and and making excuses to them they are sold to hell because you did not identify who is the angel of this exodus obey the voice of the angel moses never performed one miracle it was the angel of god that went before moses praise the lord amen it was the angel of god that went before moses he did not perform one miracle jesus says i cannot do nothing except what the father revealed to me praise the lord let's now use men and make excuses on god's promises because god's word is show if god said anything he's more than able to bring it to pass praise the lord if you are not seeing it in your life don't use a man for an excuse it's god that make the promise go to god [Music] and i'm telling you if you meet god on the basis of his word he will bring that promise to pass [Music] praise the lord he will bring that promise to pass he is the injured of this coveted praise the lord amen he's the angel of this covenant make no mistake because i i mean it's not after you know uh uh brother branham left that we came up with this this he was here this is what he was saying he was teaching us that this is the angel of the covenant he didn't say he was the injured of the covenant praise the lord that if we want god promised to come to power we must go to his grave to pray that's not what he said he said this is the angel of the covenant moses never performed one miracle it was the injured of the law that went before him it was the pillar of fire by night the cloud by day and when you see the picture that we are going going to show you that is the picture with the hollow light over brother branham he's talking about he says i believe you will feel the same pillow of fire that was leading the people today the angel of god which we know the angel that led moses was the angel of the covenant which was christ church life today has become a life of association it's just like a club we pay our deals we have our membership and we don't want to hurt one another feelings you know we just i mean i mean it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's like a family and we say we all family you know we don't want to hurt one another feelings and uh uh you know uh and and and and we have reduced it to this without god in the midst we have reduced church life to a club without god in the mess see what the the the the the lord told moses here i sent my angel beware of him obey his voice provoke him not be word of him amen obey his voice provoke him that that's the reason why all our actions and reactions must not be because of men because if a man misbehaved to you and you react to it the one that you are offending is the leader god is trying to to amplify before moses here and grab his attention and let him know look this is the man that is leaving you this is the guy that is going to get offended when something happened in the church praise the lord do we consider how do god feel the first thing we consider our feeling when he said i never even felt good i didn't feel good and we don't even consider how do god feel when we come to church and sleep how do god feel when we come to church and become irreferent how do god feel you see because church life has been reduced to a club life we don't care of how god feels we only care how he feels i'm a member of this club i pay my deals of this club i have right to express myself in this club and we don't consider how he feels but yeah moses was told be word of him obey his voice provoke him that praise the lord for he will now pardon your transgression for my name is in him praise lord but listen to this also he said but if you indeed obey his voice if you recognize the one that is the one that is leading the one that is danger the one that is in charge if you obey his voice praise the lord amen if you obey his voice then you have to listen kingly for his voice wars are fought for principles if you want to take a stand find his promise to stand upon because that's the only thing that will hold water that's the only thing that will stand praise the lord if you just want to fight for your feelings you will make yourself feel bad you will make other people to feedback and everybody will feel bad praise the lord glory be to god amen and i mean god will not fight for your feelings god stand for his word god stand for his word god back up his word praise the lord he says if you obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy then that's when i would come on the scene and fight for you that's when i will take up your fight your fight will be my fight praise the lord what are some of the things we are fighting for what are some of the things that we are fighting for what are we standing for what are we risking this time to drive through the cold and the snow what are we here for this morning is it just to play our religion and go home what are we here for oh i believe it's because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord amen i believe that's the reason why we should be here because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord look this is time for us to put substance into our faith faith is the substance of things hoped for a lot of people have faith with our substance it's time to put substance into your faith it's time for you to sit down and ask yourself what am i doing what is all of this what does this what is the importance of this to me it's time to put substance into your faith like the apostle paul said be not deceived god is not mark for whatsoever the man's soul that's what he's going to reap please praise the lord you play with church i mean you're playing with your own soul you play with the things of god you play with your own life but when you put substance into it you get substance back if you put substance into god you will get substance back that's the reason why our our forefathers they could sink and praise god before the firings squad before the lion then because they had substance into it they could walk praising god women burned to the stake will never give up their faith because they have substance into it for me to live is christ and to die this game they have such a substance into it that the roman sword did not fear them the terror of the roman army did not scare them because they had so much substance in it that they know of that in just in the blink of an eye they will be standing in the presence of their maker it's not an idea it's a reality it's something you hold in your heart you hold it in your heart it's so real to you it's time for us to post substance in our religion praise the lord oh praise the lord my goodness if you obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy to your enemy you want for god to fight for you sin for god's word stand for god's word praise the lord danger of this exeter praise the lord amen william branham was the messenger of the age of the terror accident but the angel of this exeter is jesus christ he's the angel of the coveting he's the one that waits for us just at the river and make sure we have a safe travel over he holds our hand from mortal life to immortality when we go through that dark shadow that is called death he's the one that stands there and cross us over he's the angel of the coveting jesus christ praise the lord amen those are things that people don't understand they think oh you know we we i mean we worship a man we you know and get out no that's not it praise the lord and the ones that worshipping men are coming into crisis they are coming into crisis praise the lord you have to know who is your leader amen praise the lord and church he's the one that i'm putting your hands into his hands praise the lord amen let's just reach out and get a hold of his hands and say lord take a hold of my hands and lead me through 20 21. praise the lord no matter what comes amen it may close this church door then we all can stay home and but if your hands is in his hands if he's leading you he's leading me we will all find ourselves at the same place our end will be the same he's the injured of the covenant praise the lord amen the trinitarian teaching has been one of the greatest deception to the church word because with this teaching of separate separating god into three persons has created a lot of confusion in the human spirit because there is only one god that has manifested himself not only in three more than that god has manifested himself in different ways praise the lord it has become one of one of the things that have put the christian church into idolatry because we're having three gods there and and everybody is claiming worship praise the lord we can even get true worship to one god how can we satisfy three amen we can't even keep devotion to one we can't even keep commitment to one but those are some other things that have got us to the place where we are today around the christian faith all praise the lord are we together you love the lord that's just my my new year message trying to encourage you the one that we have to look to amen if anything with good good that will come out of this assembly is that we are looking to that one praise the lord if there is anything good that will come out of what we are doing in this local assembly is because we are keeping our eyes on the altar and the finisher of our faith we were not strayed from his divine word we were not strayed from uh the prophetic message that he has sent us but we will keep our eyes on him because even where we can understand where we cannot put the dust together if we keep our eyes on him we will never stray praise the lord we don't have a big name preacher to run after there is only one big man in the name of jesus christ amen that's the only big name preacher i know the name of jesus christ praise the lord amen that's that's just my encouragement to you this morning and i was going to go into something there in 1962 but ben was was preaching and he was talking about coming to his end he says maybe i'm laying the foundation for one to come after me that statement has created a lot of contradiction and many men has raising up to be the one to lead us praise the lord and we are still here and they are gone and there are many more that are waking up to be the one to lead us they will be gone and we will still be here praise the lord amen because just like john the baptist stood on the earth and says there is one among us of whose shoes i'm not walter to lose the latches off praise the lord amen just like john the baptist stood on earth and said behold the lamb of god amen praise the lord that takes away the sin of the word it was a repetition the messenger was placing us in the hands of the angel he was letting us know i have laid the foundation there is one that is coming after me that one was not a martyr of flesh it was the angel because that is the way that god works after he have used a man to do a work he expect that man just like adam would do everything at the end of every day adam will go back to the father and say i have named the trees what do you think about it he said it is good jesus said after you have done all that you have done count yourself to be unprofitable because it is not you that is working it is he that is working through you during the seals he made the same statement praise the lord he says never the time two messenger has been on earth at the same time when john the baptist realized that the messiah was on earth he says i must decrease for him to increase behold the lamb of god he identified the lamb of god and the bible says andrew his disciple joined the baptist disciples follow jesus because he identified the lamb of god and he went with him in the wilderness and john went to praising and the bible says in the praising he sent a message going asking is he's the one why because it was a transition the ministry was moving from one to another it was moving from one to another but you see when god uses a man so much and the people idolize him is one of the thing that is hard to get away from is your idol it's hard to get away from your idol you know why because most of the time our idols we make it ourself we use our hands just like isaiah said they go into the wood they cut down the trees they use some to roast meat and they carve some for the idols and then they bow down and worship it praise the lord they carve it with their own hands we like the things that we do we like it come and see come and see what i did come and see what i did come and see come and see what i did and when we make our idols it's hard for us to get away from praise the lord gideon broke his died idol in the morning to woke up says gideon what have you done well what have you done praise the lord why because gideon realized they are praying to this thing it's not making no it can't even move the first thing about it it's so scary it's so scary so he said okay let us learn that len we shouldn't argue we shouldn't argue don't talk for god let your god talk for yourself amen praise the lord and that's what we have done that's what we have done in religion after catholicism dominate the world it become it became the universal church you think about the kind of a reference and fear before the reformation that people had towards the catholic church to say something against the pope my goodness the kind of a terror that was on the hearts of the people when those men were not even in the service of god with all the things they were doing and all the things that were happening praise the lord when ludo came out and spoke against the church people said little are you not afraid are you not scared but what am i trying to say we have made excuses why we would not serve god why we would not live right you find people saying i mean why should i do it even the pastor then said the drinking praise the lord we will make excuses is that not the falling nature of adam always looking for somebody to pass the bottle looking for somebody to blame for your failure it's just it's just a simple adam nature the woman that you give me the woman said the serpent we're always looking for somebody to blame when god has given us a sacred word heaven and earth will pass away now one thing in this world will pass away praise the lord this morning i was thinking about speaking on uh once again i will shake the heavens and the earth that's what i wanted to speak on but i just thought we need to encourage ourselves in this way once again we need to re-echo and identify our leader amen we need to re-echo and identify the one that is leading us praise the lord amen amen i've soon closed here just a few minutes before me but we want to say as we have said from the beginning of the year happy new year i don't know how much happened is going to be but happy new year i don't i don't say it to be funny i'm just saying it just to say that we have to prepare ourselves for come what me amen and i'm not saying it to make you scary but i'm not i'm just saying it that you have to prepare yourself most especially your relationship with god there is now one that is sitting in this little building today that don't know someone that was affected by the virus and everything that's been going around now one we all in one way or the other we we hear about the things on the news we know loved ones they have been affected by this some have lost their life and different things a good friend of mine very good friend of mine another brother he was the one that invited me to south africa the first time brother roland gengar just just passed away yet in south africa i never even heard about it i just saw the post he and his son uh died from the covey and uh uh i mean i was just i was so broken uh but he tried to call me and i think four a.m on friday morning but i was i was tired so i didn't take the phone and uh uh you know i mean and i mean yeah everyone every one of us and our lives are not better than the lives of those people our lives are not better than the lives of those different ones we have to be grateful to god praise the lord and as your pastor i'm grateful to have brothers and sisters that love the lord that are committed to this little assembly you that support this church with your presence you know some of you have to work on your schedule to make sure you be in church and we know some of the families that drive an hour our plus two hours to be here and those that support this church with their fan eyes as well the attires and offering to to keep the assembling the way that we have it we we are grateful to have people you know we don't seem to want to be uh you know disobedient we don't want to be rebellious it's not that we're trying to define the the the state law when they were shut down we shut down we did everything that we know we tried to do we have this little shade here just just doing our best to be able to keep this place where we can be able to come and go we have no offense either i mean the lord blessed us we were able to set up a youtube channel and the site just before the whole thing comes so when people can make it and they can stay home and follow the service you know we we are also grateful praise the lord we are all so grateful but i will tell you we are more challenged than we were ever challenged we are more challenged than we were ever challenged i was going to preach on a message called inheritance the good and the by when you inherit things most of the people that comes to this church we inherited them people come from different church they move here you know and and we inherited you uh even this church i inherited it from brothers that uh we're standing for the word of god so all of that you know i just come by the weight of this this little hesitation introduce you to the leader praise the lord to the one that i expect will lead us we are not here to please your feelings we don't want to hurt you intentionally but there is one person that i hope that we all will be glad when he is happy is the almighty god praise the lord there is nobody that is above the word of god amen if you think i'm doing something wrong find the word to come and meet me don't come and tell me how you feel just find the word and say brother one i call into the word of god we're not supposed to do this when you do that then you trap me then you're ready for a fight amen and if it's the word of god we will all bow down on our knees and say lord jesus help us but if you come and tell me how you feel i will tell you how i feel it sounds funny but it's it's it's real it's it's truth we are getting into a place that we have not been before church life is lord people that has held the word of god they are throwing the towers in prayer life is gone from the believers christians don't pray anymore just a lot of pressure the internet has won the minds of our young people we can make it good for them but if not it's a sale that's why they call it cell phone it means a cell for one you are in your own cell that little thing that on your hands you can get your food on it you can buy your clothes on it but you are in yourself we have a generation that have heard about the supernatural heard about a little fish about the scholars and heard about all of this but he has seen little of the supernatural in the church the holy ghost is just a church identification because i mean the message i have the holy ghost when the holy ghost to our fathers was something that made them to sit in church for the love of god they just weep we are in an information age people run to google for all the answers with all of these things that is happening we have just come this morning to tell you that just as the lord told moses i will send my angel before you praise the lord and that was the leader of the accident if we are in the tear exeter and we are going into our promise of the baptism of the holy ghost then i want to say to you that that same angel he's he is our leader of this exeter praise the lord if you want to make it into the promised land you got to keep your eyes on the leader you got to obey what he says you got to obey what he says it's so easy for us to have our idea about what he says our opinion about what he says we can argue about it obeying what he says is something different because i will tell you your choices will reflect your revelation just like i said to you the other time it will show how much you appreciate the word of god it will show how much you appreciate the message the way you make decisions the way you make choices the things you do your judgments will show how much you appreciate the word of god it's not to say oh i appreciate it you know i you know i believe the message about it no the way you decide because if you appreciate the word you will consult the word first you will follow the instruction of the word praise the lord good shepherd church that's you that's your leader that's our leader the holy ghost the injured of the confident praise the lord amen the lord bless you with that with that being said again we wish you happy new year really pray that the lord make it happy and special in his own way for you something that he can do that can revive his presence in your life something he can do that can do i would draw you closer to him something that he that he would do that would make his word so sweet that you would not go a dead without reading his word something that he would do that you can't eat a meal without saying thank you lord jesus

into the family of god by the incorruptable seed the word of god now by the church membership we need something that will make god so real to us so real to us [Music] just like the bible said about job he esteemed he esteemed the lord he esteemed the lord he esteemed the word of god above his necessary needs i believe that's what we need we need an experience of god we need a birth just a simple
