another testimony here from brother steve brother steve oprah steve cassidy you're welcome sir god bless you god bless you saints um it was a few weeks back i believe was that i had requested a prayer i um it's a long story and i'll try to keep it brief but many years ago i was a criminal i'll just put it that way many years ago i was a criminal and back in 94 i decided to um do what i could to make things right and so i went back to colorado that's where the the the crimes were committed and then went back to colorado to uh uh to confess to a homicide and um anyway the the way it worked out i i actually got an attorney i just you know i talked to a lot of people i didn't know what to do and i originally called someone here and they said well you got to talk to somebody in the county where it happened and so i ended up calling someone in the county uh and oddly enough the my attorney was an attorney that i had i'd been on a case where i was a i was a juror and i didn't like her and but i didn't know that until i got to colorado to see who my this person was i was talking to on the phone and um but she really was a good attorney and so the the d.a had offered me they offered me criminally negligent homicide which basically means that someone died in the process of a crime being committed and which was what it was and i thought well that's right and so but the uh i don't know if i'm not holding this close enough anyway the um so but the crime because it happened in 1977 in 1977 it was a misdemeanor and so the d.a you know it was a mistake the d.a wanted me to have a felony but what she offered me was a misdemeanor and i thought well but that's what it was and so i accepted it and then she couldn't take it back because i'd already talked to my attorney and i decided i was going to accept it so well then when i went to court and i didn't know this for 22 years i think it was it wasn't until five years ago that i was applying for a job and when i was applying for a job i was told that i couldn't get the job because i had a felony and i'm like well i don't have a felony and i thought it was really you know bizarre and there was a website i didn't go look at the website it just assumed that you know whoever did the background check knew what they saw and they said i had a felony and so i assumed that was right and and so i contacted him i didn't know what to do so i thought well let me contact my attorney well when i when i went to contact her she was not she was no longer an attorney she was a judge and she had been a judge for many years and so i i still contacted her and she she never got back to me but a clerk of court got back to me and he's you know he said that it had been all cleared up and everything and and i'd so i never looked at the i never went out the website to see it and i just so i assumed it was there and then i assumed that the clerk of court what he said was right so i just assumed everything was right well now it's been five years later and i was looking at a job i was thinking oh i wasn't really looking long story but i was thinking about applying for this one job but they said if you have a felony you cannot work for this company and i thought you know i probably should check and make sure i really don't have a felony so i actually went out to the website and i found out that i still had a felony on my record so then i went back i thought you know and i thought so i went online that's how i found my my former attorney in the first place so i went online and then i found out that she had retired so she was no longer a judge she retired um so i was i don't know if i really want to contact her why but i ended up i contacted again and she again she never got back to me and actually before i contacted her i contacted the clerk of court because i'd read that the clerk of court is the person who clears up your record so i contacted the clerk of court and the clerk of court uh forwarded my information to some self-help group it's like it made no sense at all so i called the the clerk court and she she wasn't there i left a long message she never called me back i never heard anything so then i thought well i'll go ahead and i'll send a letter to my former attorney and then when i did weeks had passed that's when i then that's when i had the prayer request that you know that the lord would intervene and then i finally got a call or not a call i got an email from the clerker court and she said that she'd received a letter and that she was gonna you know she'd be looking into it in the next week and then she'd get back to me and that's what happened and then she did get back to me she said that it was cleared up and i went out on the website and i no longer have a felony on my record so i just want to thank the lord for that thank you jesus let's shout glory indeed we're serving a living god we want to thank god for that wonderful testimony all right let's go ahead and stand and let's sing to the glory of god amen [Music] how for me [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] we will understand [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are [Music] in the [Music]

serve amen so in john chapter 1 sin john chapter 1. let's take seen john chapter one this morning i just i want to speak some on something this morning just to encourage us most especially with the time times that we are living in and the things that are happening around us i just thought that i should be able to remind us a few things from the word of the lord in john chapter one let's read verse one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god praise the lord the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen praise the lord so uh let's let's take another verse here over in the in the book of hebrew let's take uh hebrew chapter 11 hebrew chapter 11 praise the lord amen hebrew chapter 11 let's read verse 1 as well now faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of things not seen for by it the other obtained a good report true faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear praise the lord amen and then hebrew chapter 4 hebrew chapter 4 we want to take one of the verse that would be verse 12. verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of spirit and soul and of the joints and the marron and is at the center of the thoughts and the intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight so in the sight of the word of god nothing is hate neither is there any creature that is now manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so i will ask you this morning who are you dealing with to him to whom we have to do let's pray heavenly father we will ask your blessings upon the portion of your word that we have read father for one reason we are gathered here it's law that uh you will speak through us and speak to us lord father we pray as we ask the blessing upon the word deal with our hearts this morning lord god may something be said of internal value that will draw us closer to you we just commit ourself in your hands father if there's a needed person that we know we are the one this morning we are standing in need so we ask the lord you will come our way father and come lord and minister to us alone especially with the times that we are living in and the things that are happening around us of god we are grateful that you have given us this place we can come together as people of light precious faith to be able to express our gratitude to you and oh god we pray that father the visitors in our midst law this morning you will also father god meet their niece lord we just thank you we appreciate you those that are now with us this morning we pray for the traveling once and brother ariel our brother andrews and and christine that way and few lord god that i was not able to make it into the service today that are also following online we commit them into your hands bless us now lord we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat and uh we we were not able to let you know on wednesday but uh uh some time ago we were uh praying for um a young brother joseph sonnen that used to be with us uh he went over now to d.c because of work we were praying for his dad and that was kind of for dealing with a cancer case at some time in the week i think which day it was was that on on wednesday morning i got a call from him his dad went to be with the lord so uh we want to keep him in prayer he's praying and planning to go home for the funeral and you know things that will be done so and then uh yesterday also i spoke with uh [Music] brother moses there's uh but moses in kansas uh he have come true here there's been some time back he he used to be with brother aggiero uh many years also and [Music] his his father also went to be with the lord so we will remember these brothers and the many that uh that are mourning they are lost that the lord will comfort them praise the lord amen amen amen so uh this morning uh we want to just like i said we want to encourage ourselves we want to uh uh you know talk on something just to encourage us for the time you know that we uh we are living in i want i want to focus a little bit on the on the word of god this scripture did in uh hebrew chapter 12 caught my attention for the word is quick and powerful i don't know how much power that we know that the word of god has but we want to talk a little bit about that this morning how the word of god is quick and powerful you believe that the word of god is powerful we just read from hebrew chapter 11 by the word of god the heaven and earth was created amen things which do appear things that we see with our eyes the trees and were all created by a spoken word by a word that god spoke so we want to stand with the apostle paul this morning and says the word of god is powerful but before we get to talking there uh i want to i want to take i want to take an experience here uh from the message paradox uh that uh brother branham had and it was it was uh more like a dream or the vision that he had and and the vision was was something like going across jordan where the promises laid we know that god his children you know uh a land that was flooring with milk and honey he promised them uh their inheritance he was going to bring them out of bunish and take them over to their inheritance so across jordan was where the the promises was laying but while they were on this other side of jordan they they they experienced miracle there were manna falling from heaven you know when and god turned the the water of mirror into sweet water and and and the pillow of fire was leading them they saw the opening of the red sea and everything but they are inheritance was lying across jordan praise the lord so uh uh i want to take this experience uh i read a little bit to you i might i might escape quickly and just to uh to get to the point here so it was it was uh it came just like a dream or like a vision that he had but that was what it was it was all potential it seems like i could hear a song going down to jordan someone was singing and as i drove near the river i looked back and and and and seeing which way i had come and was two-thirds of the way to jordan and i looked across jordan and i said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lays every promised land in the promised land praise the lord and we know our promises is laying in the holy ghost amen there's were our promises god put all his promises right in there and it seems like everybody was afraid what's everybody so afraid of and the voice came to me and said there is such a danger in these days there's a great hydro stain there's death when it distracts you and i believe the other uh you know that we we are just using this to be able to to uh set ourselves up yes set a stage for us to talk about the things that we want to talk about but i believe we are we are living in such such a time also where everybody is afraid and uh and and i mean there are things that are happening uh it's hardly to go a day when there is not a kind of deaf news if it is not suicide it's uh it's uh it's homicide if it is not homoside it's some kind of a killing or shooting or you know horrible things that are happening all around the world praise the lord it looks like it's just every word and people are just afraid amen there is such a danger in these days that we are living praise the lord amen and then in the vision it was more like this danger was about a mamba snake that was moving in the weeds and and we know that same old devil praise the lord they are all serpent according to revelation chapter 12 is moving in these days amen praise the lord and he's the one that is causing death he's the one that is causing fear he's the one that is causing all of the evil that we are seeing in our day in our time praise the lord and then there in the vision it was it was almost like uh but branham said he had his friend and uh uh and and i mean and there were two and and what happened he says then he turned and looked at my friend and and the way he went after my friend and as i seen my friend just jump jumping away in the head and over him and and over him and over him trying and things and the thing was tracking at him i thought oh if it ever hits him it's instant death no wonder everybody is so scared because when this thing hits you is an instant death you see it's a spirit praise the lord amen it's a spirit that is that is living in i mean that is causing this fear in in the time that we are living in it's a spirit that is causing you know death we know that the pill house when he rise he rise with death written on his back praise the lord according to revelation chapter six so uh uh but what is happening here is the other i want us to be able to take this scene and just apply it to the time that we are living in and this thing is striking in many different ways praise the lord amen some are experiencing all the things that are described and and why also some you know uh their homes are striking you know uh uh i mean uh some their marriages you know and and the enemy ignoring that his time is ahead he have no more time and i mean he's just hitting whatever he can hate praise the lord and until you keep behind the word of god or you keep honor the blood of jesus christ which will also be the same place he's going to hit you amen he's not looking for your age praise the lord because he's even having young people children on a 10 years that are on drugs he's not looking for your social status praise the lord he's not looking at your bank account praise the lord now your job title now how long you being the believer right or how long you've been going to church he's looking for the least opportunity that he can have amen and he's going to strike praise the lord he's striking anything that comes his way praise the lord you even chunk an empty key in his way he's going to strike it as long as he can make a noise to get your attention he's going to strike it amen he might even strike your your your vehicle so you can come to church praise the lord amen are we together so we see this you know that that was what was happening in his vision when he had it and uh and and and and this is friend you know uh the enemy was trying to strike him all over he says no one everybody is so australia because uh uh when this thing hits you it's instant death and uh and it's it was just striking him like that and i threw my hands up i said oh god have mercy on my brother if the acceptance serpent ever strikes him it would kill him and just then the serpent turned to me when i said that and look at me again and the voice came from above and said you have been given power to bind him amen the words all in it and i said well god what must i do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere and that's that's one of the ingredients that we're going to deal with this morning that's the most ingredient for this meal that we're going to eat praise the lord amen [Music] well i said god forgave me for my own sincerity and let me have sincerity then i raised my hands up to him and there something came over me and lift me up seems like that their whole body was charged with something i will stop there we can go on and on and on and read but uh uh i want us to look at this because i think that is one of the thing that is causing our age to be the way it is we have a government that is not sincere to the people amen and we have uh uh uh i mean even even our church leaders uh uh i mean insincerity is one of the evil in our day praise the lord amen and even as the church of the living god that is one of the things that is robbing us from the blessings that we must be enjoying that's one of the things that is causing a hindrance to our prayers is the lack of sincerity praise the lord amen the lack of sincerity and i pray that the lord will be able to help us as we as we talk about this amen so we have this thing we have promises that are lying right across jordan and uh uh in those promises blessings i promise to us for us to enjoy but how how can we you know unless we are sincere glory be to god and because of the lack of sincerity we've seen a lot of people that are holding this bible under the army and people even in the message homes and uh it's it's uh it's a sad thing to even think about and said you know and see how many marriages that is just slipping from under the people even ministers have been preaching this message their wives walking away you know going into wilderness and and i just believe is because we have not been sincere we have just hold a title on our chest amen we practiced the dress code we learned the language the prophet said the message those are the major vocabularies but we have not been sincere and because of sincerity children's have been slaughtered on the altar of insincerity praise the lord the word of god is powerful that's that's what uh the bible say the word of god is quick let's take that uh uh hebrew chapter 12 i hope i won't be i won't keep you long and uh [Music] we will just study together a little bit here the word of god is quick david said in psalm chapter 147 verse 15 he sendeth forth his commandment upon earth his word runeth very swiftly when the bible says the word of god is quick it run it very swiftly praise the lord you remember when i when when elijah the prophet came after he told ahab that there would be no rain until ah the lord god called for it praise the lord and and then after the three and a half years when elijah came back and and have met him and he told ahab i see uh a sign of rain i see uh uh uh uh you know i see the cloud like a man hand praise the lord and he told ahab that it was going to rain you know the rain will be coming and because elijah was standing on the word of god praise the lord the bible says he told a hap you know what to get to get up there down to uh jerusalem or the city of samira wherever the word but you will realize that elijah being the prophet of god he was more swifter than ahab that he was he ahab was the king so he had the best he had the best chair amen he had the best verses he had the best you know everything but yet the prophet elijah was moved faster so the word of god is swift iran there very swiftly praise the lord iran that very swiftly the word is quake praise the lord are we together amen and because the word is a living word the word of god the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the word actually is god praise the lord amen the word actually is god the word of god is is almost like uh uh like i've said before this is is like a uh a child that is playing with a football in his hands and he spin the ball in the air across the feet and is able to run and receive he's that he's the troyer and he's the receiver that's how god is to his word when god speak his word he's already on the other end to receive it and bring it to pass the word is swift the word is quick and the word is powerful praise the lord the word of god is powerful if we would just consider that if we would just consider the characteristics the ability that the word of god has that possess amen amen the word of god is alive when god's word comes alive in an individual lives it pierces right through the sinful attitude and bad habits and wrong thinking more than just being alive god's word is powerful it is constantly active just like god showed during the time of creation every day god was doing something he says let there be and the next day then god said let there be and the next day and god said let it be god's word is active he's always working on something it does things to us that nothing else can do it touch us where nothing can reach god's word has in itself sufficient energy and motivation motivational force to affect spiritual action praise the lord when it is brought to the attention of god's people paul say the word of god is quake it's powerful it's sharper praise the lord those that experience divine healing of cancer being removed from the alums and tumor from their stomach and and different experience of divine healing that they have experienced and what remove those sicknesses is the word of god the word of god is so sharp that it can cut a tumor from somebody and there will be no scar the word of god is so sharp that it can get there and even cut habits from our life and you can trace it praise the lord that's how powerful like paul said the one that we have to do the one that we are dealing with that's how powerful he is but you see religion and church and denomination and all the different reforms that have come through the ages have only limited us to to deny to man's idea of who this almighty all powerful god is praise the lord and now we look at the creator of the heavenly earth through a church idea or a church teaching but almighty god that had never forsake his people in every age he has always made a way to bring himself real to make himself real praise the lord he will always do something to prove to his people that he's a he's a he's a living god amen paul says the word pierces we have knife and razor sharp enough to pierce any material with hardly any effort at all we can cut a piece of paper there are misers there can peer steel plates in concrete world but only this book the word of god god's truth is able to pierce into the spiritual life of an individual we're not even as sergeant sharp staple can reach this world has the place to travel when the doctor cannot find it when the doctor uses all his instrument and he searched and he said we cannot find it we don't know what happened this word is able to travel like paul says in the dividing asunder and is able to get to the place where the doctor's staple cannot reach praise the lord the word of god is quick it's powerful it's sharper than the two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the spirit and the soul praise the lord for the matter of fact is only the word that can heal the spirit no doctor can heal your spirit amen all the medical signs i've ever learned to do only stop on this body no doctor can heal your spirit no doctor can deliver your soul only the word of god has the ability to heal your spirit solomon said in the book of proverbs he says a broken spirit who can heal praise the lord only the word of god is able to get down when your emotion has been broken whether by deception all by lives it's only this world that has the ability to step in there and heal you praise the lord oh let the lord help us this morning amen even wave the the brilliance of the brain surgeon people that work on nails the nervous system and all of that the spine they cannot touch your spirit that is god's reign it's a ram that only god can deal with praise the lord and when we come to church as we are this morning we are here to deal with things beyond the flesh praise the lord we hear that god will be able to use his word and address things in our spirit man and and he can be able to get right in there and and correct things cast out spirits amen that's the purpose why we come to the house of the lord glory be to god so i mean with with uh with the danger that we described from very brand invasion that we have in the land and then the things that are happening and with the word also that god has given to us the prophet god said in the church ages he says i wonder have the people realize the ministry that god has given us in this age how much important have we realized why god has to send a son of man ministry praise the lord it's now for us to build doctrines and build churches it's for god to be able because he says the end time message will address the end time problems and we meet the challenges of this age and no matter how dark it was in egypt god provided a gushing for his people the bible says in the book of exodus that the darkness in egypt could be felt that's right the darkness could be felt and i believe that we are living in the same ancient time where this darkness you know isaiah says gross darkness will be upon the people the darkness is that the darkness that is around us can be felt when a community like this experience what we have just experienced everybody can feed it and because we can feed it that's why we were not here on wednesday night praise the lord but yet also god provided a light he provided a city of light a place that was called goshen that his children the hebrews also they could see the sense of darkness on the other side but yet also they can experience the presence of light praise the lord because it takes a terrible sense of darkness for you to appreciate the light glory be to god amen and that's the time that we are living in that's the age that we are living in we have all of these things happening around us but just like i said i just i just want to encourage you this morning i want to encourage you that this word that you have in your hands what are you reading out of your bible you read it out of your cell phone or your ipod wherever you read it from those are not just made man's word this is the word of the very god that created you amen the birth that you breathe comes from this that's why jesus said men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god praise the lord our own souls of strength amen and our place of refuge is this word praise the lord young people church i want to encourage you don't play with the word of god don't play with the word of god because just like paul said let every man be a liar god word remains truth praise the lord amen if we really believe this word it will prove us truth but if you think you really believe the word and it does not seems like what you think you believe is happening in your life the problem is not the word the problem it's you amen praise the lord because when god said let there be light no matter how long it talked you and myself was not there but we can see the skies we can see the moon we can see the sun so it's not difficult for us to believe that god said let there be light we were not there we never knew how long it took but yeah we have light yes praise the lord the word of god is quick that's the reason why the psalmist said his word is settled because his word is quake when god speak his word when he promised his word to god is already done and settled we can argue about it we can find the greek the hebrew the aramaic we can argue but to god his promised word is already settled and done if god said he will have a bride a people without spot or wrinkle to god it's already done if god said there will be a rapture to god it's settled and gone praise the lord amen thank you jesus glory be to god amen one of the things that have destroyed us is the insincerity is the insincerity to what we believe praise the lord the insincerity and oh may god help us praise the lord may god help us i will go into something now like i said i just just want to encourage you you know this uh this morning so don't take the word of god lightly don't play with it praise the lord don't play with it that's the only thing that your soul needs to live it's the word of god your burger king and king burger and and roasted chicken you are eating your soul does not live out of faith it's good for your body but the only thing that is man's soul we live on is the word of god praise the lord and the more you feel on that word the more the god of heaven and earth become real to you the more you feed on that word the more you take god's word serious and realize that god does not his promises does not have problems praise the lord if there will be anything that has problem i i have problems because i'm born in sin and shipley in iniquity i need that word to change me i was i was uh praise the lord amen glory be to god you know sometimes there are things that that just sticks on your mind and and it's just hard for you to get out of it and it's it's wonderful this morning that's what i'm preaching the way i'm preaching so just bear with me amen amen i might not be too emotional this morning like other times but just bear with me praise the lord and we see all of these things happening you know around the christian church amen mega churches they have built their church on on music and then and build their church on disco light and build their church on preaching popular gospel even because they have played with the word of god all their institute are all crumbling down praise the lord man that has handled this word and most of the people that are having problem with the word with the message of the hour if it's not the word of god their problem the the serious problem is their insincerity their insincerity has created a lot of questions in their mind i'll give you an example one of my good gospel singers he used to be a gospel singer and uh very good gospel singer and then he started struggling with same-sex attraction and then he he sang a song that's from his own testimony he signed the song this is what the altar is for and in his mind this is what he said the inspiration of that song was whatever he was struggling with inside he go to the altar to pray that's what the altar is for i bring it to the altar i give it to you lord but when he leaves he still lives with the same thing and over the years he'd been struggling and in his mind but that's what the altar is for i come to the altar i confess my sin but that's not what the word of god says praise the lord he had a wife and children that did not know he was struggling with that the bible says you cannot leave the one that you have offended and go to the altar to make a sacrifice it is being sacrificed god will not accept that you have someone very close to you that you could have confessed and said this is what i'm struggling with it's the insincerity now you you are blaming god i come to the altar lord i confess my sin oh father have mercy upon me when god in his word told you that you can't jump over that order you can have something against somebody and then come to the altar now you come to the altar you are expecting god to deliver you if you just follow that simple instruction that simple instruction of leaving your sacrifice at the altar go and meet the one that you have problem with you see what i'm talking about the word of god is powerful but yet the word can also be helpless when you don't follow the other praise the lord it can help you because you are enough you are robbing god of the power to deliver you are we together praise the lord you know you study the word of god you read the message yeah brother i'm talking about acts chapter 5. he addressed the situation there of ananias and so far and over and over he says uh you know as chapter five we'll come back to the church again you know and out of there but one of the things that uh we we look at when we think about us chapter five we look at in our mind we think about the the the the the judgment we think about you know god striking ananias and so far dead but have we paused a little bit and go back and see what were they dealing with what was their problem what was their problem and i don't believe that their problem was just that their service amen there is a problem of insincerity that has been in their home the wife has been covering the husband the husband being covering the wife they don't agree with one another yet they are bearing with one another and they know that praise the lord amen glory be to god and that's the thing that is killing kill him now remember brother branham says you know they will come back to the church and i think that we have mishones to that court we're looking for the day where husband and wife will be dropping dead in the church they're already dead they are already dead their insincerity has taken god from their presence and they are going from one era to another era praise the lord amen a situation was brought to me and i was talking and i just fed i says well i have to look into this and you know prayed about it you know your heart goes out for people and you say oh god how can this beat and and wide and you know and and you just you are just you are just so touching your heart and want to help the situation and uh as i talk to some of the parties that are in the situation i realized that we have a problem on our hand praise the lord and i'm telling you that thing frees me it frees me because i did not even i never even i was not even looking at it like that until i started talking to the pastor of the church and then as we talked i just i just saw that i said bro this is what i think it is this is the problem that we have on our hand praise the lord amen oh may god help us people amen may he help us especially with the time that we are living in we are talking about a rapture we're talking about about the change those are not just slogan it's going to be the power of god in the midst of the church that is going to wake up the people to such an expectation praise the lord with all of the things that are happening around us how our sons and daughters of god we have to be equate you know people can use excuse and say so you know what a lot of people use use cove excuse now to come to church and all of that all we know there's a real situation i mean that's the reason why we take all of the the the precaution you know we got ourselves and everything but the truth about the macho dead is that we serve a god that is greater amen amen we serve a god that is greater praise the lord amen and we believe that as long as we do the right thing and have faith in god he's going to take care of us praise the lord amen and i mean it's the same you know people goes to work and then and those people down there in indiana police went to work out at the feathers place trying to work and take care of your family yeah the man comes in and and you know and and starts to shoot shooting and takes people life i mean it's it's such a day and such a time that we are living in and that is the thing that brings us to the place where we have to realize what if i'm caught up in one of this situation praise the lord where am i with where am i with god am i sincere enough praise the lord and all of these things but i mean this is just a wake-up call church praise the lord this is just a wake-up call let's read another quote down here from from paradox i have often wanted to come into a church i've longed to see it i guess where i could walk in the back door front door wherever it was look across the audience and see a perfect church all in order now that perfect church is not all about sinless perfection it's a church where the people are disciplined by the word of god that's why he says the church all in other a church where people come to church to worship god they come to church because they want to worship god and get into the word of god praise the lord he says an audience and see a perfect church all in order sin couldn't stealthy no the spirit will call it out it just wouldn't stay there like ananias and so far he says uh uh that there be seen in there in that group and the spirit quickly speak it like that no matter what it was how little it would be done amen see women men sitting there under the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly not just doing our religious duty and i mean we are so on the edge of our seating and we have we have so much important things to do well if you have it to do please excuse us praise the lord if you have important things to do we appreciate you coming we love you amen glory be to god but men and women sitting under the moving of the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly moving this someone has done something wrong in the congregation did they come quickly then confess it praise the lord now to the pastor make the heart right with god because he is the one that you have you have to deal with and you know the truth about the mata there is that every one of us think that we are sincere is god awaits sincerity sincerity is now weighed on how much you think you are sincere it's god that wages the spirit of man praise the lord oh what a church we'll have praise the lord what a church if we have our hearts all up to god and say oh god have mercy lord forgive me and we make sure that what what a service we will have praise the lord i mean it's the time that we are living in people we are living in a time where god is looking for there from his children it's looking for death from his children if we can just be sincere he knows our strength he knows our weaknesses like we always say you can't impress him because he have seen too much praise the lord you can impress him and you also can discourage him because he knows exactly where you are and the good news is that he's willing to help you if you would just be sincere he's willing to reach down and pick you up because his thoughts concerning you another thought of evil he starts concerning you is not for you to be defeated his thought is for you to be victorious but he don't want you to pretend about it no he don't want you to pretend about it he don't want us to pretend about it we must come just as we are and he can pick us up from there praise the lord oh my goodness praise the lord but one it looks like current ran through your body just now amen i fed it too message one that brother brandon says the church has long lost its respect now because thy god has filled the church but the church has failed god and how how has we felt god is all in these pretending stuff pretending stuff yes sir that's what we have failed god we can even be a witness we don't have a testimony praise the lord because the church has long lost his respect that's what people can say all sorts of things about church when the lookout church is just a big money making scheme that's all the thing about it that's the best best movie in business now you can be tax-free and that's all people think about church it's a place where we go and show the latest faction the new thing that is on amazon the church has long lost its respect now because god has filled the church but the church has failed god it wasn't because thy god have felt something but something filled god praise the lord amen and we know we know something problem we know him he had a loss problem amen he could cry to god to deliver him from the lion but he was not sincere to say god i have a lost problem deliver me if god could deliver something from a lion if god could give something a strain to pick up a city gate god don't have that power to take the spirit of lust from him praise the lord that was his problem we know that where we ought to be standing in such a condition like the church of us chapter five of ananias so far was brought before the church but instead of that we have long compromised with the things of the world we keep putting it off when i get married everything will be okay praise the lord as soon as i start working everything will be okay praise the lord if i move from this city and move over to connecticut everything will be okay praise the lord maybe i think if i go to canada it will be okay he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord amen and there's nowhere that god can meet you and that's how the church compromise we we just make a condition we just make a condition so we can pass ourselves in the things that we're doing praise the lord amen and the thing about it we have people to cover up for us why am i preaching like this glory be to god amen but the word of god is powerful this word oh glory be to god amen oh my god amen oh jesus help us lord yes amen he's more willing to help us then we want to be helped he's more willing to help us than we want to be helped convincing concern he says excuse me standing here in a platform speaking base and rejoicing because i'm so happy to be here i think that that god wants his children to be happy i believe we we can run it to a stream praise the lord and just get insincere about it we can run it to a stream god wants his people to be happy amen glory be to god i mean we can run into the stream we we can become so emotional oh let the church say hallelujah hallelujah all right praise the lord and praise the lord it can't even come out live because it's not coming from here praise the lord it's not coming from here if it's coming from there i won't even give you others [Music] you'll be shouting over your head but you think about it church i'll find a place to close here think about it think about it if god can bring us together young people family husband and wife with their heart of bearing with one another a heart of sincerity praise the lord amen it's never been told what god can do in our mess it's never been told yet amen we have not seen it yet but that's what the church is praise the lord you think about it most of every one of us that comes from here we drive about some 25 minutes 30 minutes 35 minutes 40 minutes an hour hour and 30 minutes we all drive most of us drive from out of this little place and we come here praise the lord there is not a filling station at the back of this church to pump gas into your vehicle but there's a god in heaven that can pour his spirit in your heart and can give you such a satisfaction that driving an hour to come here you don't regret there's a god that can pull such a satisfaction in your heart give you a desire for more of him even if you drive two hours you have no regret praise the lord people say wow you go down there to church wow is there no church around you have to drive all the way down there if you would just if you just have that thing inside say come and see you just come and see that's how much we must be sincere praise the lord that's how much if god can help us musicians you can come over now and i will skip over my message this morning i just kind of cut myself into this young people you have a future you have a future you're going to have a family one of these days you have a wife you have a husband you have a home praise the lord you don't want to go into your home not being sincere with god a young sister over in south africa the pastor was telling me you know she and his brother was was in you know they were coating whatever it is then he got on the subject about talking about uh you know uh uh commitment to church and the girl found out that the boy was struggling in paying ties she told him she said brother if you can pay tithe you can't take care of me if you are not faithful to god you can't take care of me [Applause] my goodness that's a girl that loved god she loved the word of god she makes that the first thing and do you know how much truth that is you know how much truth that is amen if a man can be stingy on his maker stranger on the one that gave him birth and strength you think he can take care of you [Music] what i want to say this morning and just encourage you thank you for bearing with me thank you for all your support the love that you have for our little group year little church and everything you do you people that come and clean the church and and come and you know clean around the church and find something to do you musicians and and technicians and different ones and without that i believe that god has been so good to us i believe that god has shown us his mercy time and time again amen i believe that god has kept his hands over us you know i was just thinking about that uh uh in the week year when you young people we were having you're having your fellowship down there and that was the very same time that young man was shot and we were here almost up to 4 30 5 o'clock if there was one thing that could break out and we know that i was shooting every i would be the first one to tell you let's go home i don't want to be responsible i would say brother jordan cut this thing up let's pray everybody go home but how god kept us and the fellowship went on and they prayed and everybody got to their home before we even knew they were shooting in the community god has been so good to us [Applause] oh i'm saying to you that there's there are more that god can do praise the lord amen we are believing for sister carol we believe him for for our young brother yet frederick and different situation that we are believing god for [Music] the inheritance laid across jordan praise the lord let's buy our heads together [Music] if god can help us [Music] you see many homes and some homes [Music] i don't see this to be in reverend but we have the huffman patriot on the wall we have the pillow of fire pictured on the wall but yes we don't have that pillow of fire in our heart i just read a quote the other day where brother branham was talking about that very same picture he says what i want is that that pillow of fire would be in your heart [Music] we will be sincere if god will just help us to be sincere with ourself some of the things that we are allowing in our life we know it's not helping us it's not helping us it's not carrying you any word it's not making anything better for you why are you still doing it [Music] and it's so easy for us to find someone a way to blame when we ourselves we are not taking the things of god serious in our life no time for personal devotion no time to even read god's word when right from sunday school that is the first verse the sunday school teacher teach us men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god [Music] young people the age is so challenging for us this information age with technology has just exposed us to things that our parents and grandparents did not even fight [Music] you have to be sincere if you are struggling there is help for you [Music] if you are struggling there is help for you [Music] it does not benefit me to see you every sunday and preach to you believe in god holy faith in my heart that almighty god is helping you and you're walking out of those doors struggling and i don't know you are struggling it does not benefit me it does not benefit you [Music] [Music] search me no god know my heart today let's play there let's go to the lord in prayer now let's just take this time the lord gave us a wonderful easter meeting see how the holy spirit used brother ben there was now one stone that he never turned over he preached all over the place the next sunday we came back the holy spirit pulled out again and gave us a wonderful we can have wonderful preaching wonderful messages you want to talk about mystery i can preach it from off the back of the book but it's not a show it's not a it's not for showmanship if we can preach all of those things and don't bring you in contact with jesus christ and you're not having a personal relationship where you know that god is speaking to you and god is dealing with you and god is helping you [Music] i believe if their situation in our homes we must be able to sit down and talk about it we must be able to pray and take it before god and cry and say god you are god you can help us you can deliver us we must ask for all the help that we need but sometimes we become so proud we don't want our name to be to be scandal we don't want for people to think days or say this i don't care
