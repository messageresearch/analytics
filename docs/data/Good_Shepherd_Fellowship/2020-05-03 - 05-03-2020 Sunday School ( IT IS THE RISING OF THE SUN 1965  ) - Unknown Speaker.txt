========================================

don't ever take it away no no i'll raise it up again the angels come buried him down in the valley he had been rotten and gone his bones was gone and everything else but the quickness power was still there they quickened him and brought him up and there he was standing there no she says after 800 years old month if you'd read matthew i got a scripture matthew 27 51 you could write part down when all goes back there that believed that he would come the bible said here after he come they were sleeping in the ground quickening powers up on and they were part of him them saints they were part of him because they believed on him potentially they had that life through the sacrifice of a sheep of propitiation which could never bring spirit of sheep back up on the man how about now with the spirit of the man god himself upon him how much more quickly power do we have but through the propitiation for sin was offered a lamb and type what we have is not the type it's the antitype what are we scared about and those fellows who only had a tight party to his resurrection and went down into the grave with it joel back there under his great stream everything tucked away from him the devil said let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face and then he broke he said don't you take his life and he did he all but take his life and his wife even turned against him set her breath had become strange to him in other words she should have nothing to do with it she didn't seem to love him anymore just pushed him away job you're miserable watching this cursed god and i said you talk like a spiritual oh god see hell right to what he had now he's a prophet he said i am not a sinner i have offered the provided sacrifice amen he knew where he was standing he was on the word no matter what the other said he was right there at the word then that great tremendous hour said you speak like a preacher he said the lord gave the lord taken away while blessed be the name of the lord said i come in this world without anything i'll come here naked i'll go out the same way blessed be the name of the lord broke out and falls his kids dead his poverty stricken as friends all turned against these church members everything else scraping himself was a what a miserable wretch nobody's ever made that yet still he helped in that word he was an eagle oh you can't keep the film over his eyes all the time all it was standing on that word what happened the skies peeled back the thunders began to roar the lightning began to flash and job looked up and saw a vision said i know my redeemer and the last days he'll stand up on this earth and go away from the skin worms has destroyed this body bones and all that quickening power will be there i'll see god for myself whom i shall see for myself my eyes shall be holding on another is that right go after my wreath be consumed within me go after the skin worms that's in my body now will destroy it you know skin worms don't come to you that worm's already in you your own skin once you ever notice that put you in a coffin and put it air tight the bugs are each up just the same because they're in you you are just a bunch of bugs to begin with on the inside though the skin worm my skin worms destroys me my flesh get in my flesh i'll see god and on that resurrection morning glory hallelujah matthew this great writer 2751 said after he is resurrected from the death that the old testament saints many of those that slept in the dust the earth comes up and entered into the city and appeared to me that quickening power still on the bones of elijah when there was no more bones still on job when there wasn't a spoonful of dust left in his body but the quickening power was still there if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you feel all so quick in your mortal body don't just quickly now say well i wish i lived back you're living a better time now if you all i see you're putting down some scriptures or i put on first that's only 4 16 notice how beautiful see in the the saints them that sleep in christ will god bring with me see saints in the grave resting like elijah some like elisha was see some of them be quickened some will be taken some will be in the grave they will go with it the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which alive and remaining shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air the quickly power on the living the quicken power on the dead see that same quickness power of god presented in both of these prophets look at their names are almost the same elisha elijah see the pride in the group one of his mr jesus still in his history almost the same between that he and she elijah and look cots represent here now elisha was taken up in the rapture represents the church or elijah and elisha rested until the resurrection see it's just like a bird needs two wings to balance itself the church was represented right there in those two prophets for we which are alive and remain to the coming lord shall not hinder them which are seen for a trumpet of god shall sound both wings shall come together and we will fly away to you fly away because what in the living are dead that quickening power still is notice remember remember now quicken to see what these things are what's the quickness power of this day remember we are quickened not long ago for help as i i think our lord said is so depaul what the father shows me i've held nothing back i'll tell you and in these last days when we see this quickening power upon us he even give quicken power to us to see the stick heal we have seen the quickness power working among us like it was and upon them in the early days see sit bring back my vision raise the dead see it makes the sticks wet the other day i was telling someone a little donovan works yeah i guess you all know it either hunting poor little fella is a nice little guy comes your churchill it's a very good friend of mine and he just thinks i didn't want a body i looked his ear turned all inside out and i said hi donovan you're talking about a hand like a and a cancer after donovan what's the matter is he here he said don't know brother man about six seven months you just keep getting i said why you say something bad i said ah i didn't want to bother you brother man i said do you know what it is that i have an idea i just put my hand over i never said a word two days that that there wasn't even a scar what is it the quickening power see it will quicken your mortal body his ear would eat all of his brains would have been gone see it died but the quickening power see one day when i was wearing myself about i said if you're boy you better go ahead you're 50 years old you if you go do anything you better hurry up and do it you're getting old there that morning the quickening power comes he let me look over the curtain and i've seen all of you over there he said all she ever loved and i loved you they're getting i seen them all over there like that what was it quickening power john the revelator was still full of quickness stood up and seen the end from the beginning isaiah was full of quick guitar and stood up and seen the millennium and all quickening power he had the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwelling you it will quicken your mighty bond mortal body remember the quickness power look what we see in this day the quickness power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickness power of god the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord what told you was around that pillar of fox quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and then that they didn't know what it was and when you just looked this way and it's our lord of medicine he is the one who opened those seals he is so sealed for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seal that was opened what is opening up that revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they didn't they took the picture and there he is senator supreme judge showing that he's alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quaking power did that to it quickening power lets us see is coming quickly power stretches from death to life quickly power gives the government to know what's wrong with him what to do what you have done and what you ought not have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things our lord jesus is so full of quickening power he was all of it together he was so full of quickly power he said this you destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quitting power destroy this body and i'll read this temple and i'll bring it up in three days why why'd you say that he knew that it was written of him see it is written in by the word of god which could not fail the word said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell and he knows that quickness power would raise him up that there would be one cell corrupted he said you destroy this temple i'll bring it back again in three days why it was prophecy the word of god and prophecy if it's true word of god cannot fail and the same prophecy and word of god that said it raised him up says that we are already raised with him [Music] don't worry said fear not and it is written that the spirit that is now within him now in us also quickens our moral bodies fear not friends the s-o-n is up the sun is up no now look at transfiguration with everyone represented there there was the living saints that raptured that was elijah standing there and there stood moses the dead saints repare it also both of them had quickly power whether one died and the other didn't die they're all there notice oh look what we're now seeing in these last days the same thing as he promised john 14 12. now look certainly people say you claim to have power no no we're just like them at mount transfiguration see certainly we do not claim power but we like like they was on the mount transfiguration they wasn't saying more to say seriously who i am and the disciples that's who i am see who i am you know what happened notice they've seen jesus glorified that's all they want to see represented jesus glorified and so is that today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified and how can he be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection it's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that i think our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make more than a sunday school or try to bring in hog ties push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something else like that that's not our design our desire is to see him glorified glory by what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when we and branham not even thought of and you're not even thought of so we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that's the quick gives us the quickening pot and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid uh you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it amen ah i will make it i've already made it i just want to see him manifest it how can you do it call him down no he's in you he's in you well then lord if i get myself out of the way you can manifest myself how can you do it because you ordained itself all that the father has given me will come notice the glory with all that evidence collected with us now it's pointing oh i think of that song on that resurrection morning when death cards will be broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall run you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broke death from around me and i'm alive uh easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the steel from around our lives and christ is revealed that he lives in heaven for now we are quicken with you all page after page we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise amen on that resurrection morning when death guards are broken we shall rise hallelujah oh aren't you glad i'm so glad way back down under a little old cold shed one morning the seals were broken and i raised with him my new creature is freaking in power the sun's up not long ago i told a story about a a fisherman a fellow come out and horn old fishermen taking fishing out on the west coast they went out that morning they needed to fish out there for the salmon well you know what takes place off a foggy out there i've seen my little brother eddie bisco down there missionary to the indians out there and we fished ourselves out on those coasts so this fish was kind of a green horn you know he went fishing they drifted out waiting for daylight to come in and then and they couldn't hear the fall going no more this fishman got all excited today we're drifting out to sea hey got all the excited said sit down the old fisherman quite you know he knew what he's talking about they just wait till the sun comes up and we see where we're at you say wasabi method is bad this pentecostal just wait the sun comes up we'll see where we're at he is the word wait do you see the word manifested shining across the seed the wave sheath we'll see where we're at do you love him [Music] sorry i kept it this long how many of us go stay over for a night man oh i just come back again about seven o'clock did you hear something no that's power heads is there one here or many who doesn't have this quickening power in you the sun is shined across you set this tabernacle you've listened to tape and yet the spirit is never quick in you so you could follow the word of god that you women you man could obey every word that he's written oh that's a dangerous thing what if you'd be a dead seed no life in you but there's something in you to tell you i i want to ride this morning i want to rise from the state that i'm in i don't want to be just a dead seed to be left to dirt drip wood i want to rhyme will you raise your hand say pray for me brother god bless you god bless you mom look at that there's no way at all for an altar call what we call an altar call people come up around the altar i'm not too much on it anyhow that was just added to the church during the days of the methodist religion the bible says as many as believe yes we're baptized there's a pool here full of water waiting for any kennedy who is ready to die to themselves now you might be buried in many times in the name of the lord jesus but until that seed is lying see it won't quicken it no no baptismal waters is like the dudes that fell from heaven it could fall upon the sea but there's no life there he can't live but if that real baptismal waters of death to yourself and you're ready to die out to everything that you've ever been taught by creeds and denominations which is contrary to the word and you'll walk as a son or a daughter of god and you mean it in your heart watch what that baptism of water will do to you this morning repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your wrongs your sins and you shall receive the sheath the wave offering you shall receive the dynamics the holy ghost for the promises to you and all them to all generations it'll be father god i have spoke at length and taking up much of the people's time but lord god there's no stopping to it it just seems you just have to quit walk away and rest and come back we're living in a dying world amongst dying people with a message of life and with the evidence of the resurrection dear god we are only going to be mortal once and what will it be if we let this opportunity pass us our hearts are burning our souls are thrilled these who have come in and many are hearing this message this morning yes two or three hundred lifted their hands they want to believe lord oh surely that's he's not dead lord how could they raise their hands like that there's something oh god it's old self it's that wife of job standing there saying oh lord let that job that believer walk in this morning die completely and be buried here in this baptism little waters of dewdrop that come from heaven the word of god that says it'll wash away every sin and remit it you're baptized in the name of jesus christ what for the remission of your sins sins remitted in the name of jesus christ may then father may if they're sick may they walk out well may if they're crippled may they walk out under the power of the holy spirit if they've been sinners may walk out washed and cleaned and the mechanics by going in the dynamics come from above the holy spirit and catch them away lord quicken their mortal body then we shall hear genuine new tongues powers of god love untold dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body a bride representing him on earth father they are yours they raise their hands i have preached the word now father receive them i pray in jesus christ's name amen you love him isn't he wonderful are you satisfied that you are a part of that easter resurrection that you raised with raise your hand you are included my little children as paul would have said not trying to impersonate him but the love i love you i stormed the roads and everything else to get here to get to speak with you come up out of the desert across the snow grits and so forth to get here we flying planes you drive across the country so we can get together we love one another we are part of one another don't you never let satan tell you anything else being a part of one another we are a part of him and we are fellow citizens of the kingdom enjoying these blessings together of the resurrection and now see now you are already resurrected when god raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in that last day your potential you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come into obedience to it that it obedience to what a church is the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus and it's easter with you i am jesus we are all or jesus you and i we're all resurrected together and we will rise at the last day even though our spirits leave our bodies even though the body's rough may they go to dusk may they be burnt up may they be in the bottom of the sea the bible said an angel poured out here's upon the sea and everything that died come up yeah there's nothing can hide us or separate us from that god that we love so well let's raise this up together god bless you i've kept you here a long time if that
