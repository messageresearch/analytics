see you brother good to see you tomorrow amen i have a little testimony uh it's probably a little less than two weeks now i was sitting joshua and myself and gas field all the way down uh just sitting in the living room and um i just said that the world has come to an end and that any time it will be over and joshua said yes it's true i said there is nothing in this life worth living for i said but what the devil is going to do he is going to just get people into technology into things just create an impression or let people create the impression that this world has another million years ago meanwhile the world is actually at the verge of collapse so we're just talking and probably for up to 10 minutes i can't go into all that we have no time and then all of a sudden i realized emmanuel was not in our midst so i said what is emmanuel they say he's upstairs and you know how children of these days are so addicted to technology so i said you know what go see what he's doing they went and called him down i said what were you doing he said i was writing i said no i don't believe it i said you were playing a game he said no i was writing i said gas will go to his room and bring his laptop so the one thing they brought it down and lo and behold what we were sitting down talking about he was upstairs typing it and this is the heading the end time is near now there are three paragraphs i'm just reading the first one what i want to talk on is the end time is here if there is any time to change it's now if you are reading your bible and praying keep doing that because that's what gets you closer to god but if if you are not now is the time to start so when we saw it in fact we were just blown away that what we were sitting down talking about he was in his room and he was typing the same thing upstairs so um he went and printed this i didn't ask him to and i didn't even know why he printed it until this morning when i asked for a copy then i knew why he went and printed it praise be to god and then joshua goes to work the following day and a friend who trained me i mean he's older than i am and then he came to joshua and told joshua are you prepared and joshua said prepare for what and he told joshua he said that the world is ending are you prepared and joshua said he was just blown away because we just talked about this the previous night and and joshua asked him so do you believe that then he said yes he like if you believe that why are you cussing so much then the guy said so oh so if you're a christian you don't curse and joshua said no you make the problem worse and the guy said then i have a long list and joshua says see that see that see that see what he was talking about he has a long list i said but the man is confessing to you what he has to do i said that is the spirit the age we are living in that people have a long list and they don't know they have a long list but if somebody has a long list and they know they have a long list it's a blessing i say you know what there are people that sit in church and they hear the word of god every day and they don't know they have a long list it's good to know you have a long list it's only bad not to do anything about it so are the amounts of two or three witnesses praise be to god this is not by coincidence and if it was coincidence then i want to know what the white coincidence actually means praise be to god god bless you since one of these days it will be all over [Applause] [Music] our dear brother for the testimony in jesus mighty name shall we stand up now as we welcome better one [Music] three oh [Music] all [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] on the ground [Music] and thought of me thank you jesus thank you

leaving out thank you musicians that would be it for the music this morning amen praise the lord amen let's turn to exodus chapter 15 exodus chapter 15. wednesday night we we started to talk a little bit on the um the attributes of god which of course it might take us the rest of time that we have on earth in order of integrity for us to exhaust that subject so i'm not even going to try i'm not even going to try there was something that caught our mind and that was the reason why we decided to pick up a little bit on it so exodus chapter 15. i would read verse 11 exodus 15 03 verse 11. this was mosaic moses sung the uh john said in in the book of revelation they signed the song of moses and lamb this was moses son his son right after the experience with the rescue verse 11 who is like on today oh lord among the gods who is like the glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders praise the lord daniel chapter 11. daniel chapter 11 we commented a little bit on on uh on daniel vision and in wednesday night but let's just read verse 32. i was kind of a stumbling over this verse on wednesday night i was looking for it in chapter 12 where that is in chapter 11 verse 32 daniel 11 verse 32 and such as do weekly against the coveted shall he corrupt by flattering but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do explode so we realized that year uh there there's a group of people that will be corrupted by flattery in believing that that a man on earth can be a holy man and and they will be deceived by that but there's also a group of people there have been a promise and ordained to know their god and that's that's that's the that is the the the inspiration that is that is behind what i want to share is is knowing god amen let's pray father we just want to ask your blessings now upon your word come lord father take our feeble effort of studying and praying and waiting on you lord put it aside this morning you know our limitations of god you know father lord uh how much we need you when it comes to this time we just want to ask lord father if there be anything oh god that will stop the moving of the spirit this morning we want to bring it under the blood of jesus christ oh father god i pray that your word oh god we have the liberty oh lord jesus to be able to convict to rebuke even to heal because your word possess your internal attributes bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen is going to be in the house of the lord this morning so we uh talking this morning on the attributes of god you know i was i was reading in in studying this subject looking at different cults and also studying different other materials [Music] and i came across something that made me know to also think about some scriptures on wednesday night we read from the book of job where job says acquaint yourself with god and and i kept thinking about uh let's let's look at job chapter 35 job chapter 35 but before we go to 25 let's look at 26 job 26. and as you read the book of job you you come across this expression but let's let's look at this one chapter 26 verse 14. let's look at verse 13. and i could say let's go back to verse 12. and i will say go back to verse you know and you could just go back and go back and go back but this is job having an expression he's he's actually talking about god he's talking about the creator of heaven and earth amen verse 12 he divided the sea with his power and by his understanding he uh smothered through the prowl verse 13 by his spirit he have ganished the the heavens his hand have formed the crooks stepping verse 14 this is where my thought is low these are part of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him praise the lord these are just part all that we will say i mean if every one of us are giving the opportunity this morning we can all testify of how good god has been to us we can all talk of different unique situation but it's just a little portion that's right that would be heard of him praise the lord just a little portion that will be heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand praise the lord so it's it's i mean it's it really shake you in your boots for you too for you to talk about god in in in his attributes but we would just we'll just talk this morning and and uh and the purpose of of this is just to be able to magnify the lord amen it's just to say how great is our god amen moses said among all the gods he i mean he grew in egypt he knew all the gods of the river the gods of the of the you know every all the different gods they have in egypt and uh uh god making himself known unto that prophet brought him to the place to have that expression among all the gods there is none that is like unto thee praise the lord job in his experience you read the book of job is tall it told us that there was there was not a man like job you know he was a man that was respected among his people you know he counsel people in the marketplaces he was a man that had such a reputation and i believe that job in his days taught like you and myself he taught he have god he have got a hold of god he have got a a a an understanding of god that he can be able to counsel people in their and and and give them comfort and they can hold to those things but when joe started to go through his life trial then he realized there is more of god to know praise the lord there is more of god to know because job head to his integrity and he knew that to the best of his knowledge there was not something that he knew that he did for which all of the calamity was coming upon him but yet he could not understand why a just god will allow him to go through those things but as he started going through his trial day after day the attributes of god that he never knew about started to come on display and god started making himself more clearer to job than he knew by just sitting in the church and listening to a preacher praise the lord but he knew by just you know holding to a water baptising confession sometimes they have to take those trials of our life where nobody have an answer for you to really really get to know god that's the reason why the psalmist said he he hid himself in darkness praise the lord but yet he's the god of light but he had himself in darkness so we i would just trust that the law will be able to help us this morning just like i said i read a few of this on wednesday night uh brother peterson was preaching last wednesday and then he he went into this path of talking about the full knowledge of god and it's a subject not only around the message but it's a subject that is greatly misunderstood praise the lord and and this this subject is greatly misunderstood because i look i look a little bit into church history and i realized that even back then they had that problem when it comes to the subject of full knowledge predestination in and and election and uh uh uh there's there's a concept you will you will you will pick that up there's a concept that uh uh [Music] let's let's read here from adoption we read this wednesday night i tried to shorten it from what i had uh listening to this predestination look back to full knowledge i means election election looks back to full knowledge and predestination predestination looks to destiny look back and see there he predestinated a long time ago by full knowledge he seen that i will love him so he made a proportion through his son that through him i might become from a crocodile a grain of wheat praise the lord so the error that is in this teaching is that the error there is that it pulls some waltiness in the creature that's the error that is in the teaching that it puts some worthiness that god knew that you will want to be safe or god knew that you will love him putting that wealthiness in the creature separating it from the creator that the creed that that the god of heaven saw it and because of that he elected you it's wrong praise the lord amen it's wrong and and and the the softness in death is that it have made many uh believing christians in the word and and even around the message to think that there is something i don't understand it but there is just something in me that god saw from the foundation of the word praise the lord now to make that statement is to make you another being separate from god that existed at the foundation of the word which is which is wrong it was elohim alone it was god alone the self-existing god alone by himself if anything came into existence it came out of god are we together praise the lord because just like i said we have to we have to uh we have to know and understand why the efficient parallel joshua series was preached that series was preached brother branham says to answer the same question that god cannot lost that which he had already saved praise the lord because many people that run into the crisis of this understanding they get to the place where when it starts to go through trials in their life then they start to doubt the very existence of god because our first time they thought that oh god knew i would be saved that's why i'm saying but now why am i going through this so for the mother father there is no god at all praise the lord let's read a little bit let's read a little bit i'll read this and you will see how a prophet of god will rightly pre position the word he says by fall knowledge he's seen that i will love him so he made a proportion through his son that through him i might become a crooked but to a weak now where am i where am i at now i'm safe i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destinate where will he take me toll and where am i going amen there's uh that that got you there you are he goes down and he says here amen he says and let's read a little further and then he goes there and read that scripture over in ephesians chapter one having predestinated us on to the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself are calling to the good pleasure of his will a calling to the good pleasure of his will keep that in the back of your mind we'll come back to that what did he do by foreknowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existing there was no angels no nothing just god held elohim the self-existent one nothing but him alone but in him was a savior well what he's going to say there is nothing lost nothing nor in there then he know that in this great attribute in him who project praise the lord because he's a savior so his attribute has to project something to be safe or as that thing will not be there his attribute has to project it are we together but in him was a savior well what he's going to save there was nothing lost knowing that then he know that his great attribute in him will project something out yonder that he could save then when it when it did that by full knowledge he looked down after his attribute has projected that but whether they projected it in his mind and he looked down and saw everyone that who accepted are we together we are talking about the self-existing god the god that dwelleth one time by himself and everything that is made was made by him and without him there was nothing me praise the lord amen i want to talk on himself as this self-existence the self-existing god how can you talk about self-resistance when he is just self-existent self-existing himself enough but that's is that attribute of god that makes him a god of solitariness because he's he was a god that dweller one time by himself praise the lord amen he was a god that endured one time by himself let's take this in there who is this let's chase the dick now in the beginning god word alone with his attribute as i spoke on this morning there's his thoughts his attributes is his thought there was nothing just god alone just like a great activity can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks he's going to build create now he cannot create he can take something that has been created he's talking about a natural architect now a natural architect cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form because it's god alone that can create praise the lord but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and there's his thoughts that's his desire is a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word a thought when is expressed is a word praise the lord amen chains of god what i want us to what i i'm trusting that the holy spirit would do for us this morning is to bring us to the place that when we sing the song how great they are amen we will not leave nothing in us but we will give it all to him praise the lord amen because our very existence is in him like the apostle says in the book of our abs in him we move and we have our being praise the lord and what what it does for the believer is that it make us to actually appreciate the grace of god because as soon as you realize that god do not need your worship whether you worship him or not it don't take anything from god for the matter of fact worshipping god help you better than helping god praise the lord oh yeah brother branham says god made us uh uh for fellowship he made the angels to to to worship whether the angels were made or man-made god in his existence and his power his ability they all existed with him praise the lord the angels being made to worship god never made god any greater than what he was he only brought out an attribute he expressed an attribute but god remains god praise the lord see what job says job chapter 35 you hear people sometimes they they go through trial of living and they get so angry god i'm not going to save you again as hefty said when you say that god oh my goodness why would you not accept me please please help me job chapter 35 verse 7. verse 5 look unto the heavens and seed and behold the clouds which are higher than you than doubt if thou seen it what does that against him or if thou if that transgression be multiplied what does they are unto him it's not going to affect god affects you brother branham says the unbelief only handled the unbeliever amen it does not rob god of his holiness praise the lord amen if thou be righteous what give a doubt to him be righteous what have you given extra to god you don't give nothing extra to him that is the reason why a righteousness without him is still filthy it's still filthy he has to associate with it it has to be what he gave to you for him to accept god will only accept what he gave to you he will not accept what you breathe by yourself oh god you know i've been serving you for the day of my life i've been saving you i've been suffering for you praise the lord oh i hope that this will bring us to some consciousness because you see there's a people that have been where christ will have the preeminence and christ cannot have the preeminence in the bride when the bride thinks that she has some rights and god had to play to her demands praise the lord you hear all of these words goes down the the the the the penny custer caramaxed uh uh reign that god i declare and decreed praise the lord the lord help us will talk on the on the decrees of god so job said if thou be righteous what gave it down him or what received he of the hands that wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and that righteousness may profit the son of man it might encourage somebody somebody might get inspired from your way of life but it does not change god it does not change god it does not add one thing to him it don't take anything the moment we start to realize that god operates out of our time zone the bible said he sits on the cycle he's outside he's not into your 24 hours he's not into your 306th days he's not no god he he's outside he's his internal that's the reason why he have already determined and declared what will happen in our time space and it happened just like he said that's why he knows the end from the beginning god is now on a pressure oh i have to do something before this coronavirus kill all my children he's not under pressure he's now under pressure praise the lord you see that's the reason why serving god is a love affair when it's a duty you think that you are doing this for god so he can do that for you it has to be a love affair david said even if you slay me yes i will still love you it has to be a love affair so he's the self-existent god the self-existing guy now the thing about it there is that when you look at god in in his solitary attributes it's it's been it's been misunderstood by by by malta by by him because that that is an attribute that that is that is unique to god i mean man has has put themselves into isolation wanting to be solitary isolation and being solitary is two different things praise the lord amen we'll look at that a little bit here praise the lord amen let me go down a little bit on this on these thoughts that we're reading here of this great god northeast those who have tonight internal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an injure a star a cherubin or anything that's intender praise the lord and if you have internal life you always was not your being not your being here not your physical body not your physical body there is a there is a stigma if i can say there is there is something something of the serpent that makes this flesh makes this body sometimes becomes so conscious of itself and in all the way that the grace of god is dealing with us and he's changing us and and and he's revealing himself to us there is just something of this body that just wants some kind of a praise some kind of a glory some just want to share in something it's an effect that comes from the serpent and as long as we live in this body that's what we have to wrestle against to bring this body subject to god's word that's where the fight is brother that's where the fight is and so when you look at you look at the thought let's let's read down a little bit here because this this is uh this is comforting amen and if he isn't infinite he isn't god god has to be infinite and he was only present not only seeing unimportant god if he isn't then he he can be god nor in all things all place because of his omnipresence praise the lord he dwell in the house but being on many sins he knows all things makes his omnipresent what he his own impression because he knows everything that's going on there can be a fleet but his eyes but what he knows praise the lord he knows it before there was a word i mean so paul said there that that is the god that we have we have to do we have to deal with that's the god that we are worshiping this is a god that is not limited in power he's not limited he's not learning anything new if god would just raise our faith to be able to embrace him in a way let's look at this god keep his word what happened you literally many years ago at the first reformation you held the torch light of freedom in your hands you were god's light what happened to you because you read in the bible the judge shall live by faith and you organize yourself around that one scripture and become a bunch of assolutionists and god took the torchlight out of your hands that's right the josh are laid by faith but there's more scripture than that so what better man madam showing here is that one time god was dealing with uh uh uh uh the lutheran's honor the uh luther revival when when he had that grace upon his life and uh and and god was using that to show himself his grace to the people the judge shall lay by faith he was dealing with them but what happened is that they organized themselves they took one scripture and you can take one structure you can take one cult you can take one idea and they organize themselves and became a bunch of in a sense that they cut everybody off if you are not in this movement god is not with you praise the lord it's a it's a way of creating your own self-existence praise the lord now follow me because i'm going to dwell on that a little bit because that is the thing that is killing people have isolated themselves amen creating their own self-existence the isolation isolate themselves just by and honestly this is the way i see it and everybody is wrong praise the lord uh but you see when god dwelled by himself [Music] as the great intent of spirit l elah elohim the self-existent god he had his attributes his abilities in him he had his thoughts and as god thinks about his children and he thinks about you know being the healer and being the savior showing that he's not selfish in his ways he decided to manifest his attributes praise the lord amen manifest his attribute condescend himself in the body of light that we call the logos to start the beginning the very beginning of the creation of god that's what the scripture says we went through that wednesday night and i saw but yet in his greatness also he was going to manifest his attribute as being the savior as being a healer and and all of that and we read also in collusion how all things was created by him and for him praise the lord and here in isaiah he says you know he created the good he created the evil because they were for him to manifest his attributes the bible make us to know that we are made for his pleasure we are made for him to do with us as he pleased praise the lord amen that's the reason why at least that mary knew when she said be it unto me not calling to that word liz did she know that all the things her life would have gone through all her plans that she made as a young woman was going to change from that day on because she wanted god's will and god word to be made manifest in her life praise the lord it becomes a a struggle word you start now to struggle between your own plan and in in accepting god's will because as as a young man or a young woman you have your ideas you have your ambitions you have your plans in your mind and then when god's will comes on the scene it becomes your struggle because you don't know his will you know your plans and your ambitions praise the lord amen let's take this show us the father and they will surpass us we have got a great product here but we are approaching the public wrong with it too much making us our solutions see it will sell itself just live it verb is talking about the message he's talking about his ministry he says we have a great product here if we if we just live it if we just love god and just live you know uh in love with god the product will sell itself he says but we are approaching the public the wrong way we are approaching the public the wrong way and we have made this move of god another group of isolationists that you have to be in the message it was selfish it would sell itself just live it see you are the salt of the earth the sword as long as the severed of the sword the the silver in the sword it will save if it comes in contact praise the lord but if you lose itself no matter how loud you shout and how you argued about doctrine and how you argue and condemn it's not bringing anybody closer to christ it's just only making you to feel like you are better than other people it's not changing life it's not healing the sake oh may god help us how we need the help of god the only reason why god spelled his life created his own blood cells and broke down blood sales was to bring his redeemed children back the reason why god give this grace for you to know him is that other will know him through you amen praise the lord amen that's the reason why when that birth comes in and starts to eat your life an area gets down in the soul you have sleep last night when you see young people stay on drugs when you see people in the street you see sinners you lose sleep overhead you don't become so glad all thank you jesus lord you saved me i thank you lord and you go to bed and sleep snow away when other souls are still dying praise the lord the true sense of grace will make you to prepare others lord i will have prepared you save thy men amen the true sense of grace but if he lost a savior no matter how loud we sh we we we shot down here then how much we jump up and down there got to be a life out here that backs that up and not a church life not a good shepherd life it must be the life of jesus christ not a message life praise the lord amen you know satan being an impersonator of god he have created this world of isolation that he brings people into praise the lord that yet they can be in a multitude of people and they are still isolated they can be in a room full of people and they are so i i mean that technology age has proven you find we are around the table and we are on our phones we we are connected to the fourth dimension moving right brother the presence around us that that is just an exposure of how much you can be sitting right here this morning under the sound of my voice and you are isolated you in your own word doing your own thing [Laughter] and nothing nothing in this building is connected to you it don't it don't even face you praise the lord but that's a word that the enemy has has created trying to impersonate the solitariness of god praise the lord you know you hear these things among people family church you know nobody called me nobody you know nobody loved me nobody come and visit me nobody call you who do you call praise the lord and you'll find that sometimes these people that do these things they have they have people that that they communicate with i mean if you're having a cell phone and you're paying bills and you're not calling anybody are you wasting money you're wasting money so in as much as you keep your cell phone there is somebody you talking to there is somebody you communicating with i mean even if there is just one favorable person you have that one praise the lord and i mean i can go down that road this morning but i don't want to let just stay with where we talking about but you see there's a word that the enemy has created i read a quote to you here brother brandon says listen to this he says here at that word he says i never could understand why our lord instead of as the day was over go down and talk over with a group of people or in the city he says but he always go alone to himself out in the desert way up away from the disciples and everything i wonder why he did it but i begin to understand now what begin to understand what he did he must it's setting parts of our lives must be absolutely kept alone praise the lord setting part of our life must be absolutely kept alone to ourself praise the lord i guess not that's not what he said but that's what we do a certain part of our life must be kept absolutely to ourself praise the lord when god dwelled alone he dwelled with his attributes you and myself we were in his mind and now that he have manifested us oh how he long to have that loneliness with you time with just you and the lord [Music] reconnecting touching base [Laughter] as god will come down in the cold of the evening and say adam you are doing well boy you are expressing when you name that animal lion that was just what was in my mind praise the lord amen and that's the reason why even when adam fell he still came down and said adam where are you praise the lord he still came down because he needed that lonely time with him adam was looking for his own fake lee and finding his own place to hide himself looking for all the excuses it's the woman you gave me and i was here and everything was fine and you were just building a world around him when you are alone with yourself that's what happens you look for all the excuses in the world to make you to be right and other people are wrong [Music] but when you are alone with god is completely different [Laughter] it's completely different when you get along with god then you get burdened for other people when you're alone with yourself it's only yourself a setting part of our life must be absolutely kept along with god hating life in christ he says at my house the prayer room is the bedroom i had to drop this one in there because i love it many times i have went into little homes and see their mothers and sofa come out of the bedroom wave with a little check apron on whipping her eyes crying praying secret place meeting place alone with god isolated that's god's isolation when you are with him isolating yourself without god you are with the devil because he's going to blow your mind up give you every reason and before you realize that's why people hang themselves on their own ceiling praise the lord the devil has created a religious isolation for people everybody is wrong every church got a problem they are the only righteous person they are the one following the message making a poor example and they will want to raise their kids in there and don't realize that their sons will not marry their daughters their sons will have to go and look for somebody else's daughter to bring that same old arrogant selfish spirit to rule their home oh it's a marvelous place to be when a man take when a man ever takes his life out of these other places into that consecrated place with christ alone well some people so mean they can't even get alone with himself let alone with god praise the lord but that's the place we are that's the age that we are living in with the pressure that is on this edge paul called it this present evil word this present evil word i tell you young people you better get jesus in your boat praise the lord you better get jesus in your boat and just having in the body's net is not enough one time he got in the boat of simon and he told simon let's let's launch out in the demon he said where we we have told this whole place i mean last night we never slept what do you want to prove we went up and down this place not a bite we got but if he only knew that he was talking to the creator the creator himself so having him in your board is one thing but knowing who you have in your butt [Applause] praise the lord yes sir amen when peter finally decided to throw his net he couldn't bring it back he had enough strength to throw it out but he couldn't bring it back god is not a man amen god is not a man that he should lie he's not a man that he should lie neither he's the son of man to repent over what he have said the problem there is that theologic and theological theologians has reduced god from his infinite wisdom trying to explain the ways of god and and teach people how to get rich and teach people how to be blessed and teach people praise the lord they have just re reduced god to a gambler that you have to cast deaths and cast lots and all of that so god can bless you because it's how much you give to him that's how much he will give back to you praise the lord when he was creating this universe he never needed our help praise the lord amen he gave each and every one of us a unique design that there is no one like you even if they try to impersonate they can never be like you praise the lord after he used that more he threw it away praise the lord the south africans say you are a cut of your kind and we can find them all to reproduce you praise the lord so since the god of this great wisdom and knowledge i mean it's just i was sitting in the office there and and uh i was just praying and i was just saying to the lord how can i talk about you oh i'm just going to do i'm just going to break on jesus i'm just going to live his holy name praise the lord he says his glory he will give to no man praise the lord you know it's all about him it's all about him it's he is i mean uh it's it's he's a he said he's a god center there is no one in comparison you we can't do anything to impress him praise the lord he says but brother one then why do we serve him amen because he calls us to because he calls us [Music] praise the lord and when you think about it it just makes you to love him amen david say he know my uprising he know my down setting even if i make my bed in hell where can i go from the great knowledge of god that's the god we serve now you tell me now if we get to the place where we can trust him and if we are dealing with situation where we can place it in his hands and say god help me not trying to make ways for help but believing that he's more than able he can change the situation he is the creator [Music] the creator of heaven and earth the very birth that we breathe comes from him why can't we just love him that's it why can't we just love him for who he is and the grace that he has given to us why can't we just love him while we always want to get in the place to do something impressive that's not what he's asking for he's asking for a life that is available for him to live through he's asking for a life for a young man or a young woman that would just surround her their life praise the lord just like peter giving his bought for jesus to huge and preach just like joseph giving his grave for jesus to be buried in i'm telling you there is nothing you gave to him that he does not take good care of [Laughter] there is nothing you gave him that he don't take good care of he would take too much good care of it that you the owner you will be so afraid to use it he will take too much good care of it that you'll be so afraid to pick out a cigarette in your finger or to take another whiskey to your mouth because the lord will take good care of your life amen that you'll be afraid to misuse it oh i just love him this morning i just came to tell you that i love him and i know you do the same praise the lord praise the lord amen amen they just all jesus yes i'm telling you it's all jesus is all jesus we are saved by grace amen so think that you deserve to be saved that's why god save you is to take grace out of the picture it's a web grace out of the picture praise the lord it's a thought that he had about you and he projected that thought praise the lord and for you to be a recipient how grateful we should be that's right how grateful we should be yes and if we if we appreciate the principle of esteeming others better than ourselves then we will realize that if the choice was there could you give your place to someone to be safe praise the lord what grace what a love that the father love us you see we are we we are privileged people to be able to have the kind of a ministry that god brought in this last day to open the word of god to us bring us to a level of understanding not to know god in the shadow because remember daniel says it's the people that know their god they're going to do explore amen the people that know their god they're not going to be reflects of all these things that are happening but like brother brandon says like that uh uh uh all mother on the flight going to see her daughter and he says there was uh turbulence the flight was just out of control and the old mama just bought her hair and prayed and he says that someone said to her mama are you not afraid she said no she says why since when this flight lanes i have a daughter home i'm going to meet if it please god to take me i have another one behind the curtain [Laughter] praise the lord so it's a win-win situation for a believer they have their hope in christ and i've come to this rest they have come to this place of rest i mean when we get to the place where the lord allowed a little try to perfect us and strengthen us in our world just so he can reveal himself to us and we get to the place and start complaining oh god why me praise the lord amen you know when i was thinking about this subject actually what i had on my mind studying was the difference between a bastard and a son when i was studying that the attributes of god i was looking at the difference between a bastard and a son praise the lord and the scripture makes it clear you know the scripture makes it clear the uh uh you know of how paul brings out what a bastard age and god in his in in in in his sovereign wisdom realizing that he's bringing he's bringing a bride out of this age he have lose to us his mind what was in the back part of god's mind just to bring us to that place of rest because we will go through one of the most toughest times all the devils of all ages is loose on this last age praise the lord amen we have a greater battle that have ever been fought and all the spirit of the age and and that's and and as we are going you know what i mean i mean uh uh uh 2000 came in and and brought the whole world to a shutdown and i'm telling you when we when we come out of this the world will never be the same the world is never going to be the same praise the lord i have everything that we would do on what is is greatly mon is going to be you monitor by the word england talking about uh a vast passport we are living in an age where our our life in in every step whether you like it or not i mean you cannot even get out of this out of this church door without being picked up by the camera because we're having one right day brother jordan i don't know what i should have said or not but i've said it well what am i what am i driving talk we are living in an age of great surveillance and this is to also show to you how much god is keeping his eyes on you if the world is keeping their eyes on you the eyes of almighty god is keeping the one that do not sleep and do not slumber is keeping you on the surveillance as well [Music] but that's the age that we are living in our life is on honor surveillance praise the lord do you realize how much a life dedicated to christ can speak louder than the preacher behind the pupae because our life is under surveillance people are watching they are looking they don't even know what they are looking for they are not even looking for christ they're just looking and pretty soon they realize she's different she's different oh she's different i've never seen a guy like that he's different there's just something about him he will but that's the age we are living in that's the age we are living in where our life is under surveillance the devil assign his demons and and and uh uh you wash that one he's a son of god she's a daughter of god and at the same time the angels of the lord i ain't come about them that fear his name praise the lord was it not in the age of elijah that seven eyes were open to see the angels that was on top of the mountain because he was associated to a larger ministry if god would just open our eyes if he would just open our eyes people young people we will have no reason to compromise his word [Music] for fleshly things for perishable things because right in the time of the drought that's when the weather woman and her son experienced the miracle their sock never went dry the oil never finished from the gallon it was in the time of the drought the devil brings ten thousand questions to our minds but how what's about this how about this how about this and pretty soon our mount is our minds are so flooded we've thought that we take our god from in our eyes then we start to question but god that is rich in mercy he comes by and give you a little grace and do something later around your life just to tell you i'm always there i promise to never leave you to never forsake you yes do you love him this morning praise the lord musicians you can come musicians you can come we are getting in the time church we are getting in the time where more and more is is proving to us that satan is the god of this evil age and the governments of the world is right in his hands praise the lord but we know whose hands we are in amen he's holding us in his hands he has written our names in the palm of his hands praise the lord we can never know god by knowledge there is no no amount of preaching i can read all the quotes and i can read the different definition of all of god's attributes that was one of the things that struck me in the office as i was i was studying i just closed my book and i just prayed we can never know god by knowledge [Music] we know god by revelation [Music] it please the father to reveal himself and the way you know god that's the way you're going to serve him if it's a god that you have to appease [Music] you're going to be involved in works and works and works and works making sacrifices bringing offerings but if it's a god that you love and realize that he looked beyond all your thoughts and he saw your needs [Music] he know every need in our lives you know exactly where you are this morning you know exactly the thoughts that are on your mind let's just buy our heads together while the musicians softly play whatever they are playing amen [Music] let's play the song oh i want to know you more deep within my heart [Music] no [Music] i wanna know you more live within my soul [Music] deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you to fear your heart and know your mind looking in your eyes set up within me [Music] you oh want to know you oh let's sing it now to the lord yes i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you to feed your heart and know your mind [Music] i want to one more time to the law now is that your prayer this [Music] morning i

morning i don't know what is your desire but i've been praying and asking the lord father if there is any way that i've isolated your great truth father because you said in your word a light cannot be hid on a bushel oh god oh jesus how i want to know you father how i want to know you lord is that your desire this morning do you feed that weight in your heart do you have a life to surround to him this morning that he can use not just to have a knowledge of him not just to have an idea not just to know him in the light of the church or in the light of the message and and and to be able to call the prophet but really to be to have a half an experience yes jesus father breathe that upon us lord this morning please lord jesus please with god we leave our house lord we live our lives to you father we realize oh god we are right in the time of father god where we are on a great surveillance lord and oh god we also get comfort love from your word that your eyes are out upon us o lord jesus oh father god but yet lord there is still this sense of fear lord of the unknown not knowing what tomorrow will bring to god not knowing when this whole virus thing is going to end now knowing lord father how many lives it will take away there is still this fear of the unknown dear lord we just feel like that little boy that told his mama when the lightning was striking and the tunnel rolling through the night she said honey god will watch over you god will take care of you he said mama i want a god with flesh on father that's how we feed this morning with all the uncertainty lord god and the fear of the unknown we want a god with skin on father not a god in another person but a god that we come lord and envelope our lives and god i would come and take over our being lord and give us your god thy inner assurance of father [Music] precious lord you have not called us lord father to rules cause to do's and downs lord you call us jesus to a loveless press you call us our father to a love and fear a fair lord a people of god that you want to experience your love in their hearts oh god now what we can do to justify ourself and what we can do to justify ourself lord but to be able

a try and just leave us to it you go with us through the trial you go with us through the trial father may we begin to experience you this way may we begin lord father to know you that you are the one that said you will never leave us you will never forsake us lord oh god affect our heart this morning with your love and with your presence of god that no matter what comes so father we can say like

give you my life i give you my soul i live for you oh every [Music] lord i gave you my life i give you my soul [Applause] i live for you alone every birth that i take every moment i'm awake [Music] i
