musicians that was wonderful a wonderful atmosphere i think we can we can trust the lord tonight in and and believe that he will speak to us the lord bless you genesis chapter 2 praise the lord genesis chapter 2. hallelujah let's read verse 7 genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and and breathe into his nostril the breath of life and man became a living soul amen let's go to uh second kings second kings second kings chapter we will read a little bit about that shimina woman praise the lord are we together okay oh let me know i mean they get back here let's let's look up here and read from [Music] verse 25. 25 not to get ourself in though and so so she went and came unto the man of god to mount camel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her a fire off he said that he said to geheza his seven behold yonder is the sheminate run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with their husband it's a will with the child and she's answered it is well praise the lord and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet gehesia came now to trust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord have hid it from me and have not told me praise the lord how soul is vexed within her and uh i want to i want to drop down a little bit the lord bless you you may have your seat praise lord verse 30 the bible says and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul leave it i will not leave thee and heroes and follow her as the lord liveth and as their soul liveth god breathed into the nostril of man and man became a living soul we uh we we spoke uh on the on the last sunday night that is gone sunday uh the last time we spoke we were talking on inspiration i want to continue from there god breathe and uh uh uh since it's uh uh a wednesday night i was i was hoping trusting that i would be able to do you know uh not to keep you long because uh just like i said i was looking into into that message better brandon preach on inspiration and and just like it is with the word every time it comes new to you praise the lord read it tonight go back and read it again it's going to come new to you amen praise the lord you never approach the word like you have you have known it before just approach the word like you have never known it before amen and then you will have the surprise of your life praise the lord so uh uh uh we we we said uh the inspiration of the almighty and uh we were talking about inspiration we were talking about the breath of god and how uh every scripture is given by inspiration which means every scripture every word that is written in this book is the breath of god amen i will take a portion tonight and trust that we'll be able to take another potion there was something that came to my mind right now but i had a little image i was going to show you but i never thought about it until now so i can do it now praise the lord as i thought about you know uh every every every combine every dot i will show you something that i saw i took a picture of it and uh is is the scripture where jesus said you know not one not one title will ever pass away praise the lord and i will show you there that's that that would be another time not not today because that that uh that particular statement that jesus made is is seen clearly in the scripture when you look at when jesus said you know the pharisees asked him a question and then he asked him you know uh uh who would the messiah be to david and he said he would be the son of david and he says then why david and the psalms said you know my law said unto my lord man if you look at that in the hebrew when i show it to you that is where that that turtle comes this this uh this this is an abbreviation it's a sign in the jewish language and that one sign caught the pharisees by their neck just that little sign over the hebrew word cut them by the neck and the bible says they dare not to ask him any question it was only that sign placed over that word that changed the conversation for them to answer jesus they will be admitting that he was god i will show it to you when we get there now tonight praise the lord now and but what i want to show you also i i want to take a few things back by inspiration i know i sent a whole i sent a whole lot back there to to the uh our team back there but it's from the same message and and i just i took two testimony and uh uh that that i was going to that i was going to uh uh share with you tonight and what actually i was i wanted to to deal with as we talk about this you know and brother branham will be showing us how you know that uh what took place in genesis we read that the last time you know uh uh when we were dealing with this subject he says when jesus came and he says you know he breathed upon them and said receive the holy ghost it was just the same as god breathing you know into adam you know and uh you know and and adam became a living soul praise the lord we have to realize that the first man adam you know uh uh he was made in the image of god and he he became a living soul and uh and and and we all you know it's a kind of a general sense you know we uh we we term to believe that we are all made in the image of god but we have to realize that uh that image of god fell praise the lord amen that image that god made in the beginning you know fell into a beastly nature praise the lord amen so uh in a general sense the way people or we talk about we be made in the image of god we look at our our future you know because just when god made man he had two eyes he had two ears he had two hands praise the lord we stay have the same future that adam had sure the only thing that adam did not had he never had a never because he never came from the womb adam never had a neighbor you and myself we had a neighbor because we came from a womb but everything we have two hands uh 10 fingers everything adam have it so this is what we look at all the time and we say is we manage we are in the image of god praise the lord so what we what we what we wanted to study a little bit and talking about inspiration is for us to be able to understand that how much of a blessing we have when we sit under the word of god when we receive god's promises okay we we have been we have been breath into every time we receive the promises of god because when god breathed into adam nostra the bible said he became a living soul so it takes the breath of god which is the word of god to quaking the soul for a man to come to life for an individual to come to purpose without the breath of god we don't have no purpose and if we don't have no purpose then we're not actually living that's the reason why paul can use that statement she delivered in pleasure or whoever lived in pleasure is dead while they are living praise the lord so every time we we we we are under the word whether you are reading the word or you are listening to the word actually you if you are receiving the word then you are receiving god's breath and if you are receiving the word it must bring you to life because the first time god breathed into a man he became a living soul are we together so that's that's what we want to look at that's that's what we want to look at we want to follow it a little bit in and and look at that and so in in that message brother branham took two stories you know two testimony that he talks about and it kind of for this time it gives an idea to the picture so that that's what i want for us to to look at tonight and then uh we will we will we will find we'll find time to be able to uh you know this is one of these things you get i get on it i get on the rabbit trail and it's hard to leave from amen praise the lord as you know i was sitting there listening to to the preacher hybrid daily preacher on wednesday night but the bus scout on on on sunday and i was i was listening and asking the lord and says lord is this is that a way that you want us to go here but i didn't see anything you know i i saw everything bringing me right back to this so i have to stay with it praise the lord i have to stay with faith but i saw something that was that was beautiful if uh if our sisters would put the first the first caught up everything year there is is out of the same message so i was really taking my time to to study the old brother would say i was coming see i was coming through i always loved love to hear him saying that but bram says that you notice the strange thing he was permitted to go kiss his father and mother goodbye he's talking about elisha when elijah met elijah amen he was permitted to go and kiss his father and mother gubar but the man in the bible which is the new testament was impermeated to go and kiss his father and mother goodbye in the new testament he said let the dead bury the dead follow me now brother branham as he said that i i took the other phrase that he said he says he said he says there is something to this he said but but we we can we can talk about it another time praise the lord he said there is something to this but we can talk about it another time so i said well okay this to me you talk about it another time and then he goes on talking but he talks about it sure okay he talks about it uh say luke chapter nine let's read in luke chapter nine that's why jesus spoke to that man there is a there is a big difference between the ministry of a prophet and uh and a scholar a prophet is not a scholar you know a prophet is not a prophet don't write commentaries you know people that write commentaries they are they are scholars they have their people that god has blessed with with gifts for them to be able to stay organized steady and put you know put verses put scripture together you know if you have a steady bible it was put together by a scholar okay but but a prophet is not like that you will not be able to uh appreciate the ministry of a prophet until you understand the way he's built brother branham said a prophet the scriptural office of a prophet he's a divine interpreter of the word praise the lord amen and and and and and interpreting the word is different from making common traits right yes sir a person that put commentary together they are not they are not interpreting what the scripture says praise the lord amen i want to show you a few of that uh tonight uh and and yeah and so we can just trust and see how the lord so brother branham talks about this and then he comes down listening to this now he says but he went and killed no did i say we should read the scripture that's what i said you see why i asked you to pray for me praise the lord let's read uh luke chapter 9 verse 59 and he and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go down and preach the kingdom of god and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first obey them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plot and look back is faith for the kingdom of god praise the lord follow this thought now as we read him he says but he went elisha and killed the ox that that he was applauding wave jesus said no man put his hand to the plot elijah killed the ox he was plotting away follow me a little bit the york of ox and took up the instruments and piled him in the field and made a fire and burned the instrument with fire and roasted the ox and made a sacrifice what was it it was a sign to the word that he did cut every shoreline loose he was really going into a full-time ministry he was going out then as a prophet anointed of god and he probably never would in this earth ever lay eyes on his father and mother again now so if if you if you see where he's going with the thought brother branham is just talking he's not explaining the scripture he's just talking but if you if you just look in there uh you know as as as a believer of the word and you look in between the line he's saying he might have never seen his father the mother the game then i ask myself a question is that a reason why by inspiration uh elijah allow him to go and kiss his father and his mother but there is something more than that praise the lord amen that's why he kissed them goodbye not only that but the working tools that he had he burned him in the field to make a sacrifice to god to show that he had already sow out to everything to be a prophet of the lord and and what a lesson we could get out of that tonight that every man that cometh to christ put his hand on the plow and stat and even turn to look back is now worthy of the plowing today the reason we are having such time as as we are is because there's too much halfway conversion intellectual conversion and i would say tonight is big there's it's big within the cycle of the message it's big the reason why i say is big is because uh uh you know with with the opening of the word and and the understanding of the scripture it's so easy for the person to think that because you have honors to water baptizing you know the go-ahead and you know the serpenty is so it's so easy for you to think that you are born again when it is just up here and there is nothing really has happened down here with young people that are being born by by christian parents in the message it's so easy for you to think that well you are safe when it is just up here and nothing really has taken place down here are we together he says there is two different elements in the human body that has a mind and one of them uh one of them reason and and one of them the reasoning in the mind which is intellectual and the other one is the soul which does not reason but believe the word of god so this this whole subject is going to deal with that because when god breathed into man he became a living soul and when we and when we have not come come to life when we have not come alive to be able to take a stand on god's word and stay up here praise the lord no matter how long you've been in the church no matter how long you've been around are we together amen so we that we we want to we we just want to do a little a little bible study on that and it's it's beautiful when when when i when you see things like that in the scripture you know the you know brother bram says you know uh you know why uh elijah told him to go and greet his father and mother and then jesus told his men not to go and greet his father and mother and then he explained year because this man elijah was already so out he had a conviction nothing could turn him back praise the lord nothing could turn him back but those two gentlemen there their names were not written in scripture they might have been part of the 70 that turned around and went back are we together so the emphasis here is that when we come to truth conviction it's when god is dealing with us from the soul now don't don't don't get me wrong now you will you will always be challenged until we go to the grave or go to the rapture your faith will always be challenged you always come into try the enemy will always try to block your mind with different things but there is something of a person that has been dealt with down here yeah a man a woman that has come to conviction that god has dropped down and start dealing with them inside here there is something different are we together praise the lord so can't give stay half a few minutes so uh uh you know as i see he talks about this uh uh but yet again you can see you know you can see uh uh uh the uh the the inspiration of the almighty right praise the lord you can see the inspiration of the almighty you know uh uh uh uh brother boskow was giving his his testimony and he talked about you know all the things that he was involved in as a young man but there was something that happened and from that day from that time praise the lord amen all of those disciples that was in that room just few days before that time they were all trouble they were all confused in their mind this man that we believe he he was the messiah we believe his message they were all troubled the bible the bible tells us there were many of them that that that denied jesus praise the lord there are few of them that was there in the court the bible says they all turned they all turned away but from that day that jesus breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost it was different praise the lord that experience kept them to pentecost praise the lord amen that experience kept them to pentecost now so uh let's take our first testimony in here let's take our first testimony this is uh uh uh wednesday night so we can we can testify amen praise the lord we'll leave sunday for preaching let's just testify tonight barbarian says i went to a dying child a few nights ago lying in the hospital premature baby had what is that how to be a sicilian okay baby had been dead for five days and uh you remake position all such effects had to give blood transfusion the heart had enlarged so as many times doctor said she can live two more hours and and she was backslided but why speaking to her and said sister dear he was baptized and dead and on the cradle road in the tabernacle said brother branham i have won the far away she said but oh i have gotten married i married a senior boy and you know she went on and couldn't leave and she said uh she said last summer i was just about to drown and i streamed out for mercy and she said then god want me to come back that my time was at hand said and i didn't and i didn't come and said now yeah it is a yeah it is again and and i knew you was in town so i sent for you brother branham struggling through her breath under the oxygen tent and then we went down i said sister jesus is just as willing to take you back today as he was the day he accepted you at the altar more willing because you are still his child just out of his way you are still his child you are just out of his way amen and their true struggle she turned her face towards god and tears run down her young cheek 18 months old baby leaving and one day within and prayed and the prayer of faith and in less than five five many times the woman was sitting up under the oxygen tent saying brother branham something happened in my soul i am right with god again and there when the doctors looked and it said look something happened said i believe in the morning we will just take the baby for the operation see what a difference is when the anointing of god comes down means different where she was once care thinking all just this this is it this is it but when god spoke then everything loose when god spoke the spoken word of god is the breath of god she said something happened in my soul are we together the little girl the other day that was converted she said i can't live it brother brandon that's that was reasoning but when it struck her soul something begin be become a reality then is not reasoning anymore is thank god at his word that's what happened to the believer that's what happened to the individual when something has happened down here when it is just here you can give a lot of excuses you can argue it praise the lord amen you can argue it it sees we we we we read the the the the sheminar woman like i said we just testified tonight not preaching and and you you you see the sheminar woman she was convinced of who elijah was amen she was convinced it was not an argument she was settled praise the lord can you imagine after waiting for child for all of the years that you have waited the one that she had to counsel her have died and she could compose herself yes take the child and lay the child on the on on elijah bed call her seven without yelling and making a big scene get on the hearse and travel the distance that she went praise the lord and greet him all as well sure praise the lord god that was not that was not a movie that was somebody's life praise the lord that was somebody's life and and the reason why i read that scripture tonight is because of her confession as your soul liveth as your soul liveth praise the lord god breathed into man and man became a living soul praise the lord and you see where we're going tonight are you getting the picture is a picture coming to you now let's look at testimony too testimony two is a little bit it's a little bit long uh it's a little bit long but let's let's get through it we we can be able to get to it and then we will pray yeah then uh another time we will take it but i wanted to use this and just and just be able to draw you in a little bit so you can see what what we what we what we are addressing here not long ago i heard i heard of a case where a woman that belonged to a set in church i told this two or three times uh you know this this is uh this is the story about the lady that says uh you know was talking to her pastor i'm dying you know and she says i'm lost so that's that's the reason why uh it's a famous story i might try to escape uh just to be able to get to the point she lived around the church and she married a boy dead and and the board was uh converted by the woman washing they moved away from the neighborhood she you know she was a pianist in the church she moved to another neighborhood and the lady in that neighborhood was seen as moral and clean as as they were in the other neighborhoods so uh the world ought of out of you know all of that uh baby shot clothes and got out and moved okay let's move them okay and he just gets talking about you know anybody knows that those that have uh it's only the devil that strip people in this in the bible strip them off their clothes and so then this woman she said now what a meaning my mama was just an old-fashioned uh foggy christian and if and if this all the women can be just as good standing in in the church as i am why can't i do as as they do now she was getting under the wrong influence that's what he's trying to describe that was in her mind to begin with she said i could be just as good as they and they are just as as as much taught off that's reasoning now her soul will tell her that's wrong praise the lord amen that's that's when it's almost like uh uh uh the the the um how can i call it the the human conviction that god gave us without the holy ghost is when our conscience comes in you know truth comes from the soul when jesus said men shall live by bread alone they shall not live by bread alone and every word of god it was it was uh uh speaking of the soul because the soul can only live by the word of god the soul cannot live by anything else the only thing that can bring the soul alive is the word of god which of course that's the breath of god god breathed into man and man became a living soul praise the lord your soul cannot live by argument your soul cannot live by any kind of fancy teaching it has to be truth praise the lord amen that spirit of god i was moving in the beginning was the spirit of truth the spirit that birthed into adam was the spirit of truth praise the lord it's not how i explain the word of god for it to look like it's truth no it has to be what the word of god says because the word can prove itself to be true all the time are we together now so her soul was telling her that's wrong but she pushed it aside and she went on down she went on doing it anyhow the ladies in the church most of them smoke seeker which is one of the cruel the the cruelest and worst thing that women ever done in this modern age but said but she said if the other ladies can smoke why can't i smoke so she started doing that her husband tried to tell her now honey we don't we don't do that she says uh you know i'll do it anyhow and this soul the bible said listening the bible said the soul that sinneth it shall die praise the lord the word death means to separate in other words the soul that disbelieved the word of god shall finally separate from you praise the lord shall finally because the soul supposed to live by the word of god amen so if the soul is not having the word to live by it will separate from you because now separate in a sense it's not that your soul will fly away your soul will will go somewhere else but you it's in the sense that you're going to you're going to be living and having a longing and not understanding why trying to find everything to satisfy and nothing can satisfy because there is there is there is something that has separated from you it's almost like you lost something but you don't know what you lost right sometimes you think that you know people would think it's maybe it's my friends i need to get friends you get friends you say feed that you lost something are we together i'm still bailing my case here the soul that this believe the world shall finally separate from you now if if i die now or any christian who died it wouldn't be separate from god because he that hearing my word and belief on him that sent me has everlasting life praise the lord but you who separate one from another she kept on grieving that soul finally it begins to separate from her and go away just like i said again it's not like it fly away it's always there it's there but it's not in control that's supposed to be the controlling tower that's supposed to be the place that we make decision from we make our choices from but because it's not feeding on the word it's not influenced by the word now we are just fill up with everything up here just in the life of competition we got to make decision from google we got to find some on youtube and see what you know what uh how many likes on facebook sure i'm just saying all of that just to kind of build a picture so you can see what i'm driving tall when when the son of god or the daughter of god life must be driven by the word of god sons of god are led by the spirit of god children of god in general are we together are you grappling are you grabbing the picture amen now so she's uh she's dealing with this and after a while she got to a place that a young fellow moved in the neighborhood and you know brother bram is going to talk about now she now run away from her husband you know she moved into another relationship you know and it started and just started going crazy started doing everything now she moved into another neighborhood i would drop down a little bit with this man and continue on into the church brought her brought her uh a letter to another church you know moved from one place to another place he's trying to fill in you know and all of that now let's let's drop that a little bit and it finally caught up with her she began to get some ache and pains now she she felt sick i think he mentioned that up here so she finally got shaken a second minister which is a friend of mine went to her to talk to her when to talk to her about her soul uh talked about her soul to her why she was why she gave him to understand smoking one cigarette after another uh and she said stuff and that was same for you you know and i'm just as good as you are and that very attitude proved what she was she said i belong to this church i was raised up in church you know i mean she almost in this in it is a kind of for [Music] the illusion stage she see herself even though she's sick and dying but she all feel in her mind that she's in the best form of life she can come on a conviction praise the lord she can come on a conviction i dropped down a little bit then in then in talking with the minister i said watch her and he was trying to get get her prepared so that i could pray for her and i believe the woman will have been healed i said wash her at the end of the road that's that's the only way because she's she just committed a scene and went on reasoning instead of listening to her soul but that soul will catch up with her someday praise the lord and when she come time to die yet the pastor we've heard the people in the room and everything just as normal thought she was all right absolutely believed that she was all right and when she come to that com time to die their mental faculty is operated by blood and nails that's your brain that's your mind is operated by your blood and your nails the moment that your blood starts pumping to your brain you will not be able to reason right from wrong so then your mental faculty fails the only thing you have now your soul comes back to life are we together amen because that's that's what the scripture says you know and and uh you know your your body goes to the dust your soul go before god you know and then now it cannot relate with everything that you have done in your life because it has been separated from you it's been separated from the unbeliever okay it's been separated from the unbeliever so uh uh and when she comes to that time the mental faculty is operated by blood and nails which is in the brain that will perish at your death your mental faculty and your reasoning will pass away because reasoning could not come into the presence of god it did reason with god is the soul that liveth the blood cease to go through your brain cells and your nail see seizing your her memory her reasoning began to cast away then what happened that saw that she grieved away that had been dead to her all these years to come up to her and she screamed my god i'm lost because you see there is one thing that your soul will not do to you it will never deceive you it will never deceive you god breathed into man like we read at the beginning a man became a living soul you see that's the reason why uh uh uh you know they can the science is able to make a line detector to tell if you are lying they cannot make one to tell if you are telling the truth you know why because you already have one that tells the truth that's your soul they can't make one to tell the truth because they know that the truth is in that compartment called the soul that's the place where truth belongs so now they can put that lying detector on you and go through your nerves are we together so you see the picture that we that that i'm trying to build here now in the first story this this this other young lady she has backslided amen but you see where she was she was she was right at a place of of of trying to you know she she was open to telling her testimony i went i did wrong you know i i made wrong choices i even realized that god was dealing with me you know so she was right at that place she then she really did not grieve her soul or cast it or when she was just struggling right so when she was faced with truth and she was faced with the word it was easy for her to surrender yes the word drops in she comes to life she said something happened to me something happened to me i'm back again but now in the second testimony this other young person is is just is just struggling she's doing everything to get away making wrong choices and and she's defending herself and she she's arguing about it and nobody can tell what is right and what is wrong this is my life i can do whatever i want to do with it are we together now so as we as we as we as we said all scripture is given by inspiration inspiration is the breath of god every time we receive god's word and say lord this is why your word said i believe it i receive your word we are taking god's birth into us now you see that's the thing that gave the the the believer the strength to stand on the promises it's not you practicing righteousness it's not you practicing how to stop you know stop to lie stop touching no no no all of those things will fail you will practice practice it will fail you have to accept god's provision you have to believe that jesus paid it all and i can trust him i can believe it i can surround her to it it's not practicing righteousness it's not practicing how to dress right and how to walk right and how to talk right it's taking this word it's believing this word are we together you see the picture we have we are billing about the birth of god about the birth of god as long as your soul liveth she was convinced she had a conviction she had a conviction and when that word drops in your soul it inspires you you do things beyond understanding how can your child only child die praise the lord lokahana after waiting for child all of those years she said if you give me i'll give it back inspiration you don't think about it you know it's not a premeditated thought it's something that comes from within yes you see that's the reason why people that that have pre-meditated thought they promised they are thinking about law if you bless me you know i'm going to give this they keep thinking that when that time come i become decision now yeah you know i promised i was going to give it but it's premeditated it's not inspiration you are not inspired pre-meditated so now you are now struggling whether you should do it on that right praise the lord what if the lord continue to bless us we'll continue on the top i just wanted to catch you by this story tonight because i thought that was that was a that was a good foundation to just be able to see the two you know there is two womb the human have we have one womb here meant to our mental womb it can keep things and we have another womb here that's our spiritual womb right praise the lord when when the seed of god enter it produced the life of christ if the seed enters just this warm you can argue about it you can talk about it but you always struggle to live it you will always struggle to come to tortor surrounding and god is more interested in his word dropping in our soul because that is his chamber he can be able to live out himself the lord musicians you can come let's sing a little bit of into the chamber be sweet holy spirit and then we can we can pray speak to me gently law as i close the door have on the lover let the prayer sense [Music] let's turn on our feet into the chamber

true then if we're gathered in your name we can be sure of one thing is that you're here with us father and lord that's what makes it a place of refuge father is that we know that we've stepped behind the veil into your presence and as we step into your presence then lord that's why all our troubles and trials can melt away lord in just a few moments in your presence here father with saints of like faith gives us strength we need to go back out and face another day father face another trial knowing that you're with us so we just thank you for this moment in your presence father lord as we go we ask lord that you would go with us this presence that we've come and entered into with the saints father lord we wouldn't leave it here father but each one of us would take a little lick of flame of that presence with us father to make it through the next few days until we come and meet again father lord we're so grateful for your goodness and your mercy in our lives lord we ask you to go with each each one as they go their separate ways this evening lord lord that your traveling mercies would take them safely to their homes lord lord that your presence would go with them and lord the fears
