thank you for thank you you everybody praise the Lord hallelujah amen and I was reminded also to appreciate the ones that come and claim the church for us praise the Lord amen amen so we thank the Lord praise the Lord amen good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord we thank the Lord for Wednesday night service amen the PowerHouse of his internal t amen that was that was wonderful for brother Elijah amen uh know I've been brother loger for a very long time and uh in some way we are related uh his mom is uh uh some somehow related to my dad and uh uh but uh uh we knew one another very long time and and uh uh when he started his work and uh uh back he came over to the a coast see me and uh we didn't know we were related at at the time and uh we spent some time together share with me and everything that was going on back home and I just I just uh I just felt burden that I I needed to to stand with this brother and help him so every time I go home I will spend some time with his church and and and uh and then we we been uh very good I was I was trying maybe one of these days just show you where we started from they started from they were using the brother's yeah his his compound they had a small Church there that's where we started from uh and then uh uh the B the land like he said on Wednesday night I was back home I remember uh one of my first letter I got from G sheeper Fellowship brother scat wrote me and asked uh uh which way they could help uh because they knew I was preaching I was traveling I told him I said well uh personally I think I'm doing okay for the little things that I'm doing but I think there's a group here that you can help so we recommended brother Elijah at the time so uh uh and then it just happened there just at the time they were helping him then I got my Visa to come to the state so we came and then we went back for the church dedication he's down in Wisconsin brother Peterson drove him there had service last night and and this morning and uh so we we just appreciate the Lord for that amen amen amen we could we could just go on and on and on you know we sang that song where would I be only you know and that's truth praise the Lord last week I was preaching uh I went home I was thinking about it I think uh I kind of for miscalculated my age because I remember that that would have been my my 16th birthday or 17th birthday and uh uh I had some friends that was planning to do a birthday party for me that uh uh and they really wanted to get me drunk that night but that was the very same night God came down and saved me I was on my way to that birthday party that night when I saw the friend preaching on the street stand up to listing for the wi and and uh still remember he was preaching souls in prison and uh uh and then I kick my head out of it I said well these guys are waiting for me let me go and join them and uh uh we right in the middle of the road I can't explain it I can't explain it but I will tell you I was there when it happened and I know this truth amen right in the middle of the road Something Turned me around I went right back to where that brother was preaching and my life has never been the same amen so then uh that was that would be two years or three years after when I started when I started preaching so uh we thank the Lord he been so good to us and uh we close our message on the key to the door this morning and uh and and br br ended that message I had to tell uh uh the team back there to go back to where he started the communion service and uh uh I I one the one one of the reason what I I wanted us to play that message is because uh uh I'm asking the Lord to to give me a key to ad door amen praise the Lord all it means is just an opportunity amen an opportunity to to be able to take the word to somebody to take the word to someplace praise the Lord so uh uh and about something he you know talking on communion there I was telling yesterday and and i i i b into something uh that uh I wanted to share with you while you remain in your seat let's take our Bible quickly and do a little bible study before we get into preaching this morning praise the Lord amen you love Bible studies amen I thought I thought about it that maybe next month uh uh uh or next year coming weekend we can start a kind of uh uh breakfast Bible studies maybe with the brothers or maybe with everybody amen maybe uh yeah we can we can start a breakfast Bible study but before I forget before I forget this is uh November happy birthday to all the lember people praise the Lord and we we pray that the Lord will will just bless you and keep you all in good health amen and this November we have uh uh brother Paul Fountain I think you saw if you were paying attention to to um um the things playing on the Prelude there brother Paul will be with us on the 16th of November uh uh originally we were going to have him we were planning to do a kind of a couple retreat or couple meeting or just something for couples and uh uh he and brother Barry had to fly to to uh Europe uh for the meeting Bar C so uh he asked me brother one can we change the Dee and I said well okay and uh uh good enough we did that because uh uh there there was a lot of changes around us and we couldn't just make proper planning so it was good that we allow him to go and they had a good meeting there in Euro so uh so when we talk he thought he would come in August and and yet yeah we couldn't get things I couldn't get things together in the way that is and you see and one of the reason why just like I said before uh we are a small group here and uh and uh uh all of our most of our visitors that comes through most of them and uh we have to fly them in you know people don't drive to Minnesota to go anywhere amen and uh uh even though you could go to kada but not many people go to kenada you know uh just driving in Drew so uh uh we have to fly them in and then uh making that Arrangement and uh you know and and all of that and then at the end of the day with the with our different schedule and we can get people you know to set uh the weekend aside for services is just uh uh sometimes it's not encouraging but yet it have stay now detau us from from bringing preachers because that's what the church needs amen our prayer is that God would just help us to be able to rise to the opportunity that uh uh when we you know have these meetings we will uh you know we will be able to you know uh uh make the sacrifice to come together I know many of you uh work on your schedule to be in church on Wednesday and on Sunday so making an extra change on the weekend uh you know uh sometimes times is uh is challenging but you also have to realize you know uh uh the church need all of these things you know uh uh we need the fire for Ministry we need uh you know to to as as as we grow together if not we would just be at Wednesday Sunday morning church because uh you know I we work hour scheduled is comfortable for us that way but as we grow we we we take on some challenges we take on some challenges many years ago we started having our our Memorial Day meetings and uh uh the Lord bless it for 5 years we enjoy it and then we decided okay we just we just keep it you know keep it low profile just do what we have to do in church and and and all of that but as we grow we want the Lord to to give us opportunities amen amen and uh uh so so so uh when brother Paul T he say well okay why why not I come around November I said okay maybe we can make that work and then uh uh we choose that weekend of the 16 he's also he's a basic guy I mean this this has been close to maybe four years we've been talking back and forth you know he want to come and visit we we'll bring him in and all of that but uh he's a busic guy so so we have it set for the 16 so I just thought okay why I throw something in there I spoke to him can we just do kind of a couple brunch and uh where we can just be able to encourage our couple so the 16 uh uh November 16 at 10:00 a.m. we'll be we'll have a couple brunch with uh brother Paula Fountain we send uh uh the flyer out to you many of you by text and like I said if you have any question ask me some of the reason I said that is because you know uh uh are we having you know some that that are here their wives are not here or their husband are not here and then you say well I mean it's coupled I can't go alone uh you know because uh uh I mean whether whether you are with your your spouse or not you stay a couple amen don't divide yourself you know uh don't uh uh create separation just because of a couple meeting amen you have to remember you got to keep their Union whether the person is overseas or wherever it is you know you got to keep the union so I always I always encourage people I remember we were down in July in uh uh DC doing a couple meeting Brother D and myself for the for the group up there and then uh uh you know so we got talking the same thing you know people were giving excuse I said what you know even me you know and look at even brother Deli he don't have his wife yet I don't have my wife yet you know so let's not cancel the couple meeting let's let's just go and enjoyed amen it's uh uh so yeah the uh but then also there's a price to it is $100 a couple so uh uh and we want to we want to make sure that uh uh we we you can pay it on the day if you want to if you want to pay earlier maybe you can give it to uh uh any of the trustees brother brother Stephen Steve CIT or brother Max you can give it to them and then then we put your name down and uh so okay let's uh that's that is it for the announcement any other thing we will continue to remind ourself as we go along praise the Lord I didn't want to forget about that and then uh he preached for us that evening and also on Sunday morning and I got a text from Brother Don Huffman uh this morning because I sent it over to them and and uh they're hoping to join us so we thank the Lord for that and uh so what what I wanted for us to look at here quickly before we uh we look into this is what that that caught my attention Acts chapter let's go to Acts chapter 2 let's go to Acts chapter 2 we we'll be reading from uh it say Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 3 Acts chapter 3 that's where caught my attention [Music] Acts chapter 3 caught my attention verse one the Bible says now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the 9th uh at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour you remember it was that very same Hour of Prayer the ninth hour that colinus was praying when the angel visited colinus if you remember it was that same hour the ninth hour when the veill rented in the temple when Jesus gave up gave up the ghost so that caught by the tension what I was studying yesterday and I went looking what what is about this 9 hour the Bible uh uh uh keep lining it up for us there so I came I I got a little bit distracted like I said and then you realize that the 9 hour uh in the Bible is 300 p.m. the 9 hour in the Bible is Hour 3 p.m. praise the Lord amen and it turned out to be that is uh in some way is very significant Jesus died on the cross like I said it was around the 9th hour the Bible says he gave up the ghost be uh and joy perform their first miracle at Pentecost it was the N9 hour colus uh you know was met it was around the 9 hour now so as I was looking at that I got I got confused between the the ninth hour or the hours of the day and the watch the Bible talks about the first watch the second watch and uh uh the thir watch and it also talks about the hour of the day so I got confused so I went you know and then I I I drew a clock on my little paper I you know put the time and I started calculating I man I couldn't get it right I just something something just missing here God bless you brother Moses how are you good to see you bro good to see you good friend good to see you now so I I just I just got a little bit uh so that I decided that well I need to I need to get this down I'm going to leave everything I'm doing need to get this down now the reason why just like I said I will I will tip end it this morning on on on communion and uh the reason why because uh we can apply it to communion in the sense that uh uh when we when we think about the time in the Bible the Bible says uh Paul says uh uh that is evening you know in Corinthian he says that evening Jesus Took bread and break it that's what it's called The Lord's Supper it was never done in the morning now in our term in our language when we talk about eing we look up to 6:00 p.m. praise the Lord you you take Bible term is different if you remember we spoke on a year uh before uh between two evenings I'm not going to take a lot of time on that uh but it it grabed my mind the ninth hour grab my mind and looking into the N9 hour all of this came out so I just thought I would do a review with you quickly before we go into what we want to talk about so uh uh Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 let's go there quickly we're just doing a little bible study like I said uh uh uh amen Genesis chapter 1 verse5 and and and and God called the light day and the night he called night the evening and the morning were the first day so in the Jewish calendar their day begins from the evening so the first watch the first watch starts from 6:00 p.m. in the Jewish calendar are we together amen this the first watch is from 6:00 p.m. to 9900 p.m. that's the first watch it ties in with the scripture the evening and the morning was the first day it tie in with the church ages God bring his messenger at the evening time and he takes the church through the night through the darkness to the break of a new day to a new age so the Jewish watch starts from the evening you hear the first watch it start from 700 p.m. to 900 p.m. that's the first watch second watch from 900 p.m. to 12 and the Third Watch from 12 to 300 a.m. and and the fourth was you know just just like that 3 hours between that's how the Jewish time starts are we together amen but the hour changes when the Bible talks about the ninth hour now that's where most of the time we uh you know we the first hour comes from Sunrise that's from Sunrise that uh uh from from from uh 6 a.m. to 900 a.m. that's the first hour of the day then the third hour of the day praise the Lord they go the first the third the sixth and the nth praise the Lord are we together now because if you don't if you don't place it together rightly you will miss it you see that is the reason why most of the time when people are interpreting prophecy if you take a Biblical prophecy and put it on our Gentile you have to know our calander that we are using is a is is is a is a Roman Calendar it's not a Jewish calendar if you take biblical prophecy and put it on the Roman Calendar you will get your date and time wrong are we together so the the the the the the first hour of the day is from sunrise to 9900 a.m. and then the third hour is from 9:00 a.m. to noon the 6th hour of the day you you remember in the Bible the Bible says when it was the sixth hour of the day it was complete darkness when Jesus was on the cross the 6 hour hour it was complete darkness now if you want to take it to our time you would think it was 6:00 p.m. no it was 12 no that's the reason why it was noticeable amen so from the sixth hour of the day to the 9th hour it was complete darkness and at the 9th hour the ve in the temple rented when he ye out the ghost uh uh uh uh the the vill rented now so so you see and uh if you if you apply it to communion time you will realize that because many times many times like I said we run our mind in in in Jewish in in Gentile timing praise the Lord amen and and and and then it stumbles some people you know while the Bible says in the evening why why are you doing communion in the afternoon but you really bring it to biblical timing evening starts from 300 p.m. from 300 p.m. to 6:00 is the first evening from 6:00 to 99 is the second evening so it's always between the two evenings are we together amen amen if you have any question write it down and send it to me amen write it down give it to the deons we will readdress it because I feel you are pulling and I I just end up preaching on time amen and I did not stud it enough to preach on time so you keep pulling I will not preach my message this morning but that that caught my attention so as uh as we're closing up on that communion thing this morning I just thought okay it's a good opportunity for me to for me to bring that and remind you you know well that that is the first evening there is according to Jewish time are we together amen Jesus says let's work while it is day the night cometh when no man WTH praise the Lord amen yeah so uh so that's that is that is that is the Jewish timing now you have to you have to understand when the people went to Egypt their timing was changed that's the reason why in Exodus chapter 12 God have to tell them this will become the beginning of months why God was trying to bring them out of the Egyptian calendar and the Egyptian time to his time and his landed so he says this man this man will begin the beginning of months for you as you are going out of Egypt your year will begin from now and that's the reason why Israel have two different calendar amen they having two different calendar so that is that is for your information whatever you do with it may the Lord bless you amen let's stand on our

CH 12 Genesis 12 verse1 Genesis 12 verse1 let's look at Father Abraham we we have to speed up here now because I use all the time just to greet you and talk about brunch and all of that Genesis 12:1 the Bible says now the Lord now the Lord have said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I will make Of Thee I will use you all the things I will carry you through keep you from having child for 25 years I will make of thee a nation praise the Lord you know the way I think about it is that every every inventor uh uh uh you know all all of these guys that uh that face all of these brain name things brain name shoes and brain name clothes they like to wear their brain name amen if a person will will will have a brain name and he don't like to wear it then you can see that that person is just all about money and that is the same way with God praise the Lord God love

love to word his brain name and he says here to Abraham and I will make of thee a nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou sh be a blessing I will make of thee a nation and I will make your name great every religion on the earth will seek to call Abraham their father praise the Lord amen I will make thy name great he's the maker of names amen you see that's that's that's that's one thing that you know mankind stri for while we are on this passage on Earth you know many people want to have a name I want to leave a better name when I die I want you know I want people to know my name people strive you know to add you know uh uh uh uh two three set of degrees to their name so I mean it can it can just come from being single let it at least let's the doctor get behind it you know let's let's let's uh a few degree PhD DDD get in front of it you know and and and all of that you know and and and and man strive for those things amen some people find their way into into uh uh uh Sports and all the things to make a name you know the uh uh they want to be uh uh in heart of Fame you know uh uh uh and and many things that people strive for you know uh is just uh uh to make a name but uh it's God that makes name amen it's God that makes name he's able to take a very all of the men that we talk about in the Bible they were ordinary men it was when God took a hold of their lives for a purpose amen when God took a hold of De life think about Samson think about Samson even though he's born you know on wife mother and there son an injured and all of that but that name the Philistines will likely burn down their own house I mean the whole city will run when the name of Samson was mentioned it's God that make name praise the Lord and what I want to bring to you uh you all this afternoon is there while we are here with the little time that we have on this Earth praise the Lord with everything that we strive to do that we strive to achieve may God take us in his hands praise the Lord may he take us in his hands and give us a name no matter what name you strive for on this Earth praise the Lord amen when you die it will all be replaced with a dasch everything a man achieve when you go to the their Tombstone from 1948 dash2 24 everything remains in the dash all the great names and the great achievement right on the tombstone they put everything in that Dash people come and just see 1964 2024 1964 Dash 2024 everything you achieve just become a dash but when God takes your life when he make a name out of you praise the Lord amen when God makes a name out of you many men will read Dash on your Tombstone but your name will be engraved in the hearts of many of the people that your life will affect praise the Lord when God make a name out of you he engrave it praise the Lord and things that are engraved is hard to go away are we together he's the maker of names you love the Lord oh my oh my so he told David I make a name out of you I make a name I give you a name I make a name like one of the great men out of the earth let's read one of the favorite chapter that's where I got caught up in the book of Acts here the Acts chapter 4:2 Earth where the Bible says there is no name given under heaven whereby we can be saved there is no name amen that's Acts 4:12 neither is there salvation in any other praise the Lord neither is there salvation in the church there is not salvation in uh in in in a message there is not salvation in a preacher in our parent there is not salvation in any other nothing can save praise the Lord neither is there salvation in any other for for there is none other name under Heaven under Heaven the Bible have a reason why it's here is that there is no other name under Heaven it means there all Mighty God the creator of Heaven and Earth he had to leave his throne and step down on Earth and pick up a human name and pick up a name that was common as we will soon find out under Heaven There is no need under Heaven many men try to look for names when Hitler Carri his Carri out his Revolution he was looking for the name among his people his name now has become a bad word the German don't want you say that to them when Meson did the same he was looking for the name praise the Lord hallelujah there's no name on the heaven amen the reason there is that you will realize there were many people that was named the name of Jesus even in the time of Jesus the Bible recorded that what would surprise you is that Barabas his complete name was Jesus Barabas that was his complete name Jesus Barabas the reason there is because the name Jesus was h a common name for Jewish parents to give to their children it means uh uh uh uh yusha Joshua that's what it means Jehovah's savior so many parents gave their children the name Jesus according to history year uh uh uh Jesus Barabas there was Jesus then ananas and Jesus Ben serup these were all all names that were given to their children Acts chapter 13:6 the Bible recorded of one by Jesus and that that name by Jesus mean the son of Jonas or the son of Joshua sorry it means the son of Joshua are we together how many children called Jesus Jesus Barabas you know this that that's it's it's very very interesting because when many people Bible read or think about Barabas we we think about him many times in the wrong way but when you check history you will realize many history turned to believe that Barabas became a Christian after he realized that a man took his place praise the Lord as much shall we as we were not like the name of Barabas if Jesus Took Barabas place that was the same thing that he did for you and myself so we are all Barabas you better start loving Barabas we are Barabas according to the Bible Mark chapter 15: 7 the bible says Barabas Carri on an Insurrection according to history he killed a Roman soldier and the reason why he did that it was because he was defending the Jews he never believed that this Romans must have power over them most of the time we think about barbas we think about him being oh a criminal he's a thief in all of that but actually the only account we have in the Bible Mark chapter 15 tells us that it was because of an Insurrection and you check in history it tells you that uh Barabas a volunteer revolutionary who led an attack on the Roman uh insallation he was a popular figure because the Jews hated the Roman occupation his full name was Jesus Barabas which mean Jesus Son of the [Laughter] father Jesus Son of the father ah glory be to God Hallelujah he Carri on and attack and that's the reason why when you when you hear the people says give us Barabas it was because it was in the paper that he killed a Roman soldier so they healed him for that praise the Lord to him to them he was their hero all of these Romans they are beating us and he was Brave to go out there and and and and kill one Roman siia praise the Lord they healed him that was the very same thing those Hebrews should have done to Moses when Moses stood out there and killed that Egyptian they should have realized that this man is on our side but it turned against him and out of fear Moses had to run in the wilderness but you have to realize that that H prophecy is greater than politics amen praise the Lord the the the the Jews were playing into politics but God has something the Bible that's the reason why caras had to prophesy that one man according to our Lord he quoted that right before the jury right before pilot according to our Lord woman have to die and they thought that they were hating this man they they just thought that they rejected this man but you see everything was plain in the hands of Jehovah everything was plain in almighty God hands why because in his hand he was thinking about bringing the gentile people into the Plan of Redemption glory be to God you love the Lord that's the reason why the Bible says no other name under Heaven because the name that God will have taken Among Us was not going to be an extraordinary name he was going to take one name that was so common but he will make that name because he's a maker and a giver of name he will make thy name that are the mention of thy name every knee will bind and every tongue will confess he will make that name and that's what Paul talk about in The Book of Ephesian I mean Philippian let's go to the book of Philippian praise the Lord Philippians chapter 2 oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen in Philippians chapter 2 verse five let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in a form of God taught it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men God becoming man God wearing his own brand name praise the Lord amen he make man glory be to God and he's sitting down and and driving the very car that he made praise the Lord he made man and he can take one and dress himself in it why should it be difficult for people to believe that Jesus is God praise the Lord if he can make man can he become one I we to together but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a seven and was made in the likeness of man and being formed in faction as a man faction brand name he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross where for God Amen God the spirit that was wearing the flesh wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name praise the Lord a name that was common but he made that name how did he made it come Paul coming to tell us how he made the name to give it to him giving him a name which is above every name praise the Lord the name was made through the death of the Cross humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross that's how the name was made that's how God made that name he took a man praise the Lord and put the sin of the word on him Paul will says in uh in uh in in in Hebrew Jesus learned obedience by the many things he suffer God was making a name out of him are we together listen to what Paul says here let's go on a little bit that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and all things on the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is what Jesus Christ is Lord amen that Jesus Christ is Lord that word Lord goes back to the Jewish word which means Adon it goes back to the word the unpronouncable name of God Amen that's what it goes back to so what Paul is saying here that you will see Peter said the same thing in the book of Acts this Jesus that you have God have made him both Lord and Christ praise the Lord now so let's let's uh let's let's let's just uh uh uh go on here so you you see here it was a name that name uh uh it's it's uh it's uh the Jews would call it Jehovah that's uh we called it Jehovah we you know uh through the Greek we call it Jehovah but uh the Jewish pronoun pronunciation is yahovah ye e h o v a h and what they did was uh they took some vows to put it in between the unpronouncable name to be able to give it a word because the unpronouncable name is YH VH so the Greek now put some vows letter between it so we can give it a pronunciation just to give it a pronunciation are we together but that means Lord you will realize there the uh uh uh uh uh the the the the the the Roman they called the seus Lord and they do that praise the Lord that's the same thing the Catholic Church have adopted to their popes but they do that whenever they believe that a man has attained onto deity or divinity they call him Lord praise the Lord now so uh uh uh there were there were there were call you know Cesar Lord and all of that and in the early in the in the early church the Christians struggle with that or they struggle with the Christians on that because the Christian were not called Caesar Lord and many of them was killed for that praise the Lord because they knew that this man Jesus God have exalted him to be both Lord and Christ so they were not going to give that lordship to any man are we together now so the early Christians made their confession Jesus is Lord and they actually confess that that that Jesus of Nazareth is the god of Israel Jehovah over the one true God praise the Lord so you see it is not just that it means that Jesus is Lord it means that he's my Lord just saying that Jesus is Lord is not a better identification amen now you have to realize look at the resurrection when Jesus appeared to Mary what does she said oh my Lord my God they seemed to Thomas he said my Lord my God so you see it's it is it is that place of uh uh H H identification is that place of what a person is is is is is personifying this thing to thems it's not just enough to say Jesus is Lord it must be his my Lord God he's my God praise the Lord so we see this that uh uh he's The Giver of names he's the maker of names if God Don't Make your name as soon as you go we don't miss you let me say it that way when God Don't Make your name when you go the people don't miss you praise the Lord because you have to remember if you are called Susan somebody will be called Susanna praise the Lord what will make us to relate the reason why we can talk about Susanna when we say Susanna the first person that we think about is Susanna Wesley why because God gave her a name with the character of bringing her of her children she was able to give us two of the the world best people John Wesley as a preacher in his brother as a singer and because of John Wesley we can never forget about Susanna Wesley praise the Lord God gave her a name because she's a woman that has 17 children praise the Lord and she taught them right on on her kitchen floor praise the Lord and every one of them knew when Mama was praying she took her apron and she just cover her face and all of those children sit there quietly because they knew mama was praying God gave her a name you can fight and strumble for the name that you want if God don't give it pass away that's not you go we don't miss you we love you though but we don't miss you praise the Lord I don't mean to sound harsh but I'm trying to drive this thing home amen because that is the thing that is that is in the society that's the thing that is in the society all of these uh H H social media things and people looking for name they are posing things and then and then other people young people want to be like them they want to be like be they want to be like and all the names that is Happ that person has got their name find your name ask yourself what's your name why you want to live somebody else's life they are living their life they are making money they're not sending you a dime but every day you want to check them you want to see what's the update on them what's that what praise the Lord and more you go and check on them the more that the more they make money out of you they don't know your name they don't know your address are we together or have I left you behind don't worry you'll catch up praise the Lord you love the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen praise the Lord what will be the name what will be said it's not the pronunciation of your name but what will be said when your last birth is given and your eyes close praise the Lord what will be said what what will we say let's stop living in the shadow there's a light an eving light that is shining while live in someone else's Shadow when you can come in the light of God and say Lord yeah here am I are we together you love the Lord Lord let's go to the Book of Genesis let's see God was The Giver of names now you read Genesis chapter 1 it tells you that God made man in his uh image in the likeness uh uh Genesis 1:26 and you make Man In His Image and his likeness you know in male and female and In His Image created he them and he blessed them and said be fruitful the Bible never talks about their name praise the Lord you have to realize that when Moses wrote this thing Moses was uh writing a vision so you see the Bible if you realize he did not say it in chapter one he said it in chapter five so as he was writing the vision he realize oh I did not write this one let me let me go back because it's a vision Moses is not writing his own story he's not making it up praise the Lord so in in in chapter one he talk about creating man in the image of God and in his likeness but then it's in chapter five let's read chapter five praise the Lord chapter 5 verse one two then this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man so you see he's connecting this now he finishing up the story he gave us a little bit there but he finishing up the story you have to know it's a vision a vision is almost just like dream you are dreaming and now you in church before you realize you to the mod of America now what happened how did you get to the mod of America you can't connect it and before you realize you you see yourself again right in Bloomington so okay I was just to the church mod of America no maybe I got to Bloomington before I got to the m of America so you see it's a vision he's giv us he's trying to fill in to make the story right in the day that God created man this is the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in his life in the likeness of God created he him male and female created him them that that's the same thing that Genesis 1 said are we together are we together are we together praise the Lord I think you're more writing and listening to me but it's good I think I got you to a place this morning we can close and go home and I can pick up next week male and female Creator he them and blessed them and call their names Adam in the day that they were created so this name was given right in Genesis 1:26 so when God made man then he gave him a name he's the maker and The Giver of name when he made man he gave him a name are we together praise the Lord Genesis chapter 2 we just finished reading chapter one let's go back to chapter 2 so you see how chapter one and chapter 5 is connected chapter 5 is finishing up chapter one Genesis chapter 2 are we together praise the Lord verse 20 Genesis chapter 2:20 we do all the Bible reading then next time we preach amen verse 20 and Adam gave names to all cattles and to the fowls of the A and the beasts of the field but for Adam there was not found a helpmate for him so he couldn't name he named everything he couldn't give name to a helpmate are we together Genesis uh let's read verse 23 the same chapter and Adam said this is now born of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so he named her woman that's the best he could come up with amen that is the best he could come up with I mean when he woke up and saw hey hey who's that he was so carried away to see Eve praise the Lord and he went around her what is this mine he was so carried away praise the Lord his brain was spinning looks like me men for the lion he washed the character of the lion yeah yeah he T about it the whole day he's Leo the Lion but for woman when he woke up she scared him you have never seen nothing like that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so the best thing he could come up with woman that's the best thing he could come up with are we together you love the Lord we love our wives they are wonderful people amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 20 I just have to hold myself this morning a lot of things I could say to you but I'll keep it for another time Genesis CH 3:20 because I can just say one thing to you right now the whole service will end you will never be able to hold yourself no matter how hard you try so because of that I won't say it praise the Lord amen let's read chapter 3 verse 20 and Adam called his wife name Eve I thought he gave her a name first but some something has happened something has happened she has stepped forth from where she was Amen to just an innocent girl now she's the mother of life when he step back and start thinking all everything that she went through being abused by the sepin and everything yet she she contained herself and was able to talk to him in the evening all of those things Adam sat back and said wow he call his wife Eve the Bible says because she was the mother of all living that was what he taught in his mind praise the Lord that was what he taught in his mind glory be to God because she was the mother of all living and just realize that think about it right after the four that I never said anything or he knew she was woman that's how he called her woman come up praise the Lord that's how he call her but Adam saw everything that she went through and he sat right there when he heard almighty God speaking and said your seed will bruise the S head any pain you will break he sat there and in his mind he's thinking man I name all of these things I never brought full life but this woman God never said my seed he said her seed she's the mother of all living he changed her name he changed her name from a five letter word to a three if oh may God change our names praise the Lord may God change our names you don't have to come down and call you you know uh uh uh uh uh uh something different but he just have to do something in your life that how he changed his name he have to do something he touched Jacob by the side when he changed his name it's not just going finding the name and like it and say oh I like this name I was talking to a brother was telling me about uh you know a friend uh you know uh uh uh he's called willing Brandon and change his wife name to Media Brandon him so it looks so mysterious he's willing brand him his wife need is Media brand praise the Lord he took that name he's making himself a name that's right praise the Lord William brandham never made his own name I read it to you just now he did not make his own name he's making himself a name and then he named his wife so he now he's the Prophet this is the the prophet wife we have many willing Brandon that still need to be born again right many William Brandon that is making a disgrace out of this message is not a name the life behind the name that's what the devil is afraid of are we together question and answer brother bam says right here we just want to get right in there he says now I could not say that M the Bible doesn't call my name my name William Brandon or call your name whatever it is but we are in him anyhow praise the Lord amen when we hear the word of God and say you say oh the word spoke to me God never call you by your natural name he call you true Christ there's a characteristics in Jesus Christ that the word brings out that you can identify with praise the Lord when the writer wrote and said the Lord call onto the L and said Samuel Samuel that was what Samuel heard right amen Samuel was in Sleep God was speaking to his subconscious God was speaking loud in his spirit that he could hear it to him somebody was calling his name are we together the Bible doesn't call my name or your name whatever it is but we are in him anyhow he called us by name when a character of his word when God can bring out something in the word praise the Lord that he can grab your spirit and identify it with and you say oh why the preacher spoke to me he tells the story in Shepherd of the FL he says I took from I took thee from the Sheep C I listen to it in the message proud when brother Bram talks about it he cried he tells the same story in the message proud when he related he CED I took it from a sheep called even from following sheep when I read that my heart just pulled out of me David I took you from the Sheep court and you know why it means so much to me this is said when I was reading that I thought 10 years ago oh you mind he says we are home folks and a we we can say that our little group our our little group like this we can speak to one another just like we who know uh one another for years and we ought and we do I thought 10 years ago I was walk I I was walking a line for 40 cents an hour because I

Jeffersonville Indiana and today by the grace of God still with no education I guess I know 10 million people or more around around the word praise the Lord and Y said we never met that man never met

made us now we ourself we don't make the god that we worship praise the Lord that's why I always say if you say I come to worship my God if you get different God than the one we worship here carry it we don't want it right I just can't to worship my God praise the Lord you better line up with the one that we serve here right we don't make our God he made us and he knows our temperament he knows your fragile spot if you can give yourself to him he knows exactly what to touch and your life will never be the same we think we are brave we are braving ourself we I'm taking a stand where are you standing if you are not standing with God you're not standing no matter how tall you stand if you are not standing with God you are not standing praise the Lord just trying to drive this thing down don't think I'm angry with you amen I'm just trying to nail this thing down just to be able to grab our attention living in the word in a few days this nation will choose its next president and it's not going to be the same whichever way because brother Bram said even if you put a George Washington there he can never turn it around praise the Lord but here we have people that are angry with family member angry with neighbors and Angry Angry Angry just because of a name sound they have in year just because of a name son just because of a name of a political person you see what I'm driving this thing to men has fought their way they have fought their political career and do whatever you know what do whatever they did to get to where they are we appreciate them we respect them as our leaders but find your own path look for your own name go to the name maker and The Giver of names like David said even if my name is changed from David and it's called doat he said even if I become a dmat in the house of God now at the end of the day everybody can say he was the one we rob our feet on before we enter the temple are we together let me close this thing up and and get and get going here a lot of people want to fellowship with them what happened I couldn't do it there's no way for me to do it there's nothing could happen but Jesus Christ stoop down I have no more education than I had I never did have a personality I have nothing in the word that I could contribute it to only the love of God that sto down only the love of God that stood down if we think we are believers we are safe and we can appreciate the little decency that God has given us if it were not because of the grace of God we'll be hanging our pains down looking for all sorts of identification one tattoo to another one praise the Lord take our face put it to the back also we look for whatever identification we want because we want a name praise the Lord glory be to God says when when Jezebel parents gave her that name Jessel she was just a pretty girl like all our daughters were pretty and innocent praise the Lord they took that name of one of their goddess and they called their little daughter jessibel praise the Lord now nobody want to name their daughter Jezebel the only people that do it are all the young ladies that have given them themselves over to evil spirit that learned to be witches and different things they are the one that call themselves Jesse Bear Society the Jesse bear girls and Jesse Bear all of that no person in their right mind will ever name their daughter Jessel are we together you love the Lord he told Abraham I will make thee a nation I will make Thee I will make out of you your 25 years of walking looking for a city who maker and Builder is God I will use that 25 years I will use you going down into Egypt I will use you and Lord separating your own nephew that you have brought of you have trained I will cause him to break your heart and leave you and go down to s i will use all of that to make a nation out of you and I will give you a name I will make you a name praise the lord it's not packing fewel coats on our arm brother brand said the Bible says and now we are preachers and now we are pastors it's God that make one yes if God don't make us one we'll be pking soon we will be parking soon because it can only stretch as far as it can go all of those things we see there people come you know you know the love of the Lord you know and all of that and uh uh you know we are believer I'm in a message and and then they just get so arrogant they get so arrogant because the no water baptism is in Jesus name and they are so arrogant about it praise the Lord arrogant that they have no courtesy for for people that are older than them praise the Lord brother preach the heals he tell he tell us a God in Simplicity that was how he brought the opening of the seals the thing that was that was hidden from the foundation of the word when he brought it he said God in Simplicity and that's what he have done bring us in the presence of Great Men you know the young brother that preached for us from sing brother Solomon he's a managing director of one of the biggest Insurance Company in s he have access to his president just by the phone call just by the phone call he have access to his president just by a phone call and this word has brought us in the presence of Great Men men out of the message that you can never measure to and lot of these young people will learn courtesy you see people you don't greet them to say hi hello you don't do it because we can go to Burlington and buy necktie and shirt with dressing wear suit then we put our chest up we come we sit back praise the lord it's so easy for us to find all the problem and the things that we don't like how much are you contributing how much all the young people will not find something to put our hands on to do pick up trash and clean the around won't do it I'm in a message I'm in a message God has blessed us gave you a little job you earning money you have not been able to get 2,000 in your account you think you rich it make you chcken are we together now you have to realize now I'm not angry with you I got to keep reminding you amen before you think and says who may brother W mad no one make me mad just the love love of the Lord amen oh man but was say here they work on Christ you know I have not in my travel you usually find great men and little men I go around where they are great men really great men and I know they are great men but when I start to leave them they make you think you are great they make you think you are great what is that it's character you know what it it everything they own they don't attach it to their personality it don't stick with them they don't stick with them the people that don't have nothing they are the one as soon as they start talking to you they want to tell you what they just spend money to buy what they they have just SP money to buy and soon they ready to tell you about this and about that about this and about that that's greatness when you have an attitude where people can feel welcome into your presence they are not intimidated you don't carry yourself so special that it have to come around the block go back again say I don't know no are we together but when I start to leave they make you to think you are great they are nothing but you take a little 2x4 don't know nothing he thinks he's all of it he had nothing to begin with it's great men a little man they never break or take honor they make you feel you are great that's greatness that's greatness to be able that's the reason why the church is making a poor example that's why we can win people to Christ because the way we carry ourself there is no way to relate there is no way to relate we having too much of a sense of rejection him can sense it people can sense it when they come in your presence that's why the church is making the poor example because we are quick to condemn quick to condemn we cause the damage before we start looking for repair you know that Paul told us to be wise as sein harmless as do we got to keep our spiritual guide up don't just give yourself to people giving yourself to them for what you must have a purpose you must have what you want to achieve don't just be silly with people just laughing laughing about everything what you laughing for nobody know everything is funny when they even talking about things that is against you why you dress like that then you laugh what is funny and because of that we we get on us so much pressure then we turn now to start dressing like them and behaving because we we get on so much pressure we don't want them to criticize or we don't want them to think that we are this then now you have to start dressing like them exposing yourself wearing things that are not decent enough when you supposed to be an example are we together oh my and we have preached the whole thing here now pretty much said everything I can allow you to go home he talks about how the the name of Jesus was just like the the rock that Moses had instead of the Egyptian challenging him and throwing their rug down they should have just collected that thing from Moses praise the Lord that's what Pharaoh should have done take it from him when he throw it down he say oh that all you have come come throw your own down praise the Lord his Rod swallowed their own they still did not have sense to take it from him they allow him to leave the palace with it and brother B says that's how the name of Jesus is with the church amen we call the name of Jesus we name the name of Jesus but we not having the effect why praise the Lord because it's just like the Jesus of Barabas and the Jesus of ananas and all of the one that were living there see that's that's the reason why those Jews will say is this not Jesus we know his brothers we know his sister is it not Solomon is it not J's brother and all of that because it was just a common name but it's the life behind the name that makes the difference is the life that is behind the name praise the Lord and from the day that you were born God start working on you he start making a name making a name by the things that he takes you through then one day he gots your attention to his word and he make you to tremble to his word he makes his word to attract you and then when you read his word you can see yourself in Joseph you can see yourself in Daniel you can see yourself in the three Hebrew Boys by all the things that you are going through he's making a name he's making a name for a moment and don't miss it because there will be a moment in your life where he will want that name to stand he will want that name to represent him there will be a moment in your life I don't know when I don't know but he brings you through all of these things right behind whatever name they call you the Life of Christ is behind that name waiting for an opportunity that God will glorify himself praise the Lord hallelujah want to make your own name try your best see how it ends amen see where it will end you just just just I mean not just just a whole lot here just a whole lot here let's just read 1 Samuel chapter 12 I got to find a place to close because we can go on and on and on let's find a place to close here 1 Samuel chapter 12 I'm going to read here when Israel rejected Samuel praise the Lord 1 Samuel chapter 12 praise the Lord some people think it just you know uh it says uh this person wor this you know this person in W base and and that's the kind of a name they want they want a name where you know they can be counted among the people that W something but how much do you walk before God how much do you walk before God no doubt they are men that God has blessed in this life that God has blessed because they were able to give their all to God they were able to give a life of Consecration and Devotion to God God has blessed them he has blessed them in their work he has blessed them in their businesses they are men that God has blessed and they will always tell you if it was not because of the Lord praise the Lord and yet some of us that don't have no good form of Education Grace have picked us up and has brought us to this place where we can go in and out of people of men of caliber we can go in and out of people go in their presence and just because you are a believer they respect you they open their homes to you they open their lives to you they don't even ask you for your birth certificate don't even ask you for a your they don't do background check on you you just say I'm a Believer they open their home to you yes some of those people Wicked hearted men have corrupt people home stole from their home first Samuel chapter 12 Samuel said this and and and Samuel said unto the people fear not I have I have done fear that ye have done all this wickedness yeah turn that aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and and turn you not aside for then should you go after vain things which cannot profit n deliver for they have V after after we know after we realize where God has took us from and then we we we just we just we just after perishable things what are we trying to do that will be a memorial where do we find the Fulfillment of of Life what are the thing that brings us the most pleasure Samia talking to these people they rejected this man that God set over them he says after you have done all of these things I'm telling you children don't turn away from the Lord you say you want a king the Lord says I should give you a king I'm warning you don't turn away after you have done all of these things but you see out of the bottom of the heart the mouth speaketh when we don't guide our hearts the thing we conceive in our hearts the things we we conceive the things we say the things we do in our hearts and mind it will catch up with your body praise the Lord it will catch up with your body and turn your not aside for then she you go after V things which profited that non deliver for they are vain for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name sake praise the Lord just like I've always said amen and as much as God needs you to help this assembly he can do without you if you are not here we stay have church because it is his name it's his name and even with whatever name we have is God that attached the reputation of his name to our life to call you a son to call you a daughter he's attaching his reputation he's the makeer of names people after Jacob went through all his struggle after he went through all his struggle this young man came to the place and realized I tried to fight this I fast against it I prayed against it he needed no effort to lie he don't strugle to it was it could just flow out even when he tried his best and say I will not do it it will just come out he will get mad with himself oh my goodness oh man Jacob praise the Lord but one day he met God praise the Lord he met God one evening time and his life was never the same praise the Lord his life was never the same you realize in the Bible you read over and over the Bible in used the name Jacob and Israel and in most cases it will use Jacob when he talking about something that is not right so it referred to th own nature praise the Lord amen let's look at something here in the book of Acts we try to wind up here glory be to God you love the Lord oh sweet Jesus what a wonderful Jesus Acts chapter 13 Acts chapter 13 Acts chapter 13 let's read from verse one now there were in the church that was at anti setting prophets and teacher as as Barnabas and and and Simon that was called n uh uh and Lucas was of serene now this Simon called ner if you want to if you want to just take a note on that this is the guy that tore the cross for Jesus he became part of the disciples which have been brought up with herob the Tetra and Saul as the minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them now if you want to drop down a little bit you look here in verse 9 the Bible says then Saul who also is called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him now what is significant here is that after verse 9 he was no longer called Saul check in your Bible after verse n his name was changed the Bible call him Paul from then on so the calling of the Holy Ghost calling him to the ministry brought a change to his name he was the same person call him SA or Paul he will answer but there was something that have changed in his life are we together that's when his name went on Paul Paul PA and that's how we know him only time we call him Saul when we go back to the road of Damascus God changed his name God changed this man name that he became so burden he became so burden so burning that he decided this very gospel that I kill people for I have to die for it with everything that he have learned Paul was so learned that he could have got himself a degree he could have been a Pharisees he could have been a raber they could have called him names and all of that he had all of the titles but none of that meant anything to him praise the Lord are we together so he's the maker and The Giver of names when he call us to himself to be Sons and Daughters the Bible says he will call a people for his name sake and we say we are the bride we are a son of God what name is more than that what is what name what title can be more than you being a Son of God and living as a Son of God it might not mean anything to the people on Earth but to heaven and the sins over the bister when they look down in our generation and see how the church is feeling people that claim to be believer they are falling for nothing nothing it's not even Temptation they are falling for it man has consumed there's nothing there is no challenge there it's just something that your own passion and desire is consuming you of and they are looking over the banister and looking for a man that will stand for the the name of God a woman a young person when God call you he call you by name when he call you he call you by name when God gets your attention it's because from the day you were born set forth from your mother's womb he's been furing you he's been taking you through sicknesses through trials through disappointment through all sorts of things furing you making a name that when he gets your attention and bring the mystery of redemption to you and show you Amazing Grace praise the lord it's not to make you bigger than somebody no but that name that he has factioned from your birth he's ready to step behind that name if you would just give him the chance he's ready to step behind that name it might be as common as John or Joseph or whatever it is but God is ready to step behind that name because he's been making thy name just like Genesis chapter 1 he make Man In His Image male and female and call them Adam now he's ready to call you a bride he's ready to call you a son a daughter he sent a messenger that says now I call you bride is it that something that we can be proud of that almighty God will look down find favor on us just like he did to Mery is not something for us to be proud of that we will look at things because we don't have this we don't have that and then we will be complaining we will be so depressed because of perishable things when God almighty God has chose to associate his name with your life no matter what you have gone through he has chose to associate his name with your life praise the Lord to be able to get Glory because he made you he made you and he made you for his pleasure he has used all Life Adventure all Life Adventure to make a name for himself that when you look back in your life and you see the things you went through you can look up and say my help comeing from the Lord oh God oh God where will I have been if it was not you where will have been from the day that you came forth from your mother's wom the pain you fell The Thirst you fa everything God was using all of that to be able to faction the sickness you had as a little child the parents couldn't understand but he was using that to faction he was making a name that your parents can tell you when you were a little child you had the sign we didn't know what was happening we didn't know what was happening but we prayed we prayed and suddenly God heal you what was that God was making a name that as a little child healing is associated to you we didn't even know how we'll be able to buy food for you but God make a way what was he doing making a name so when you look back in your life everything that you were going through he was furing breaking melting building making a name praise the Lord when you come to the place to be a son then he gave you a name he gave you a name praise the Lord you even read you read history you'll realize that Mary I think her dad was her her dad was there the Virgin Mary the parents were not around or maybe her mother was was old dad was dead and and she had to go through all of that look at John the Baptist 9 years old he went into the Wilderness the voice of one crying in the wilderness Isaiah said that asaiah prophesied that yet Zacharias work as a Young Man himself but the day that he tell the people that an angel visited him they kick him they kick him out of the synagog they would not believe because why he's Associated to mared all of your family Elizabeth cursing say angel visit now you saying Angel visit John as a young boy small boy he heard all the nasty thing said about his father that's what led him to the Wilderness the system that his father took care of the church his father took care of was not there to take care of him when Zacharias died when he Elizabeth die John had to go into the Wilderness and God and God will use that high life eating Locust for the young child God will use Ed that high life to give him a name that Jesus would say and more men born of woman there is no man like John praise the Lord but God used that to give him a name not to give him a Ministry because it was just six months but to give him a name until now they know there was a man standing by the River Jordan he was Fearless he didn't care who stood before him Hallelujah God didn't call us for us to promote ourself no he didn't call you to for you to Pro promote yourself when you can take yourself out of his mind out of your mind take yourself out of your mind the too much myself me myself that take yourself out of that is the greatest battle is for you to take yourself out of your mind if you ever get to the place where you cannot think about yourself then God will start burdening you with people he will start burdening you he will now faction you you will get people or things or situation to think about let the musician come because I can preach till 5:00 I have enough notes and the atmosphere is just so good praise the Lord he's the maker and The Giver of names it's God that give names God can take your name nobody will know your father I always remember this I always remember this there was one day my daddy called me called me into his bedroom he took a book you know was a personnal administrator he took a book and he flipped to the page flipped to the page Turn the Page he asked me look for page call the page number I turned to the page he said read the te paragraph when I read the paragraph I read his name C1 he said close the book son said let me tell you he said go to school my son he said God has blessed me that's something he going about telling many story I never forgot about that I never forget about that I never forget about that but many years when I will be safe and I realiz and I just thinking about it every time I think about it I smart I think about Dad said I wonder what was going through his mind trying to encourage his little son to focus on his education and he said you know people can write write history and write your name in a book but to realize that even before my life on Earth began my name was written in the book praise the Lord that God wrote our names your name and my name in The Lamb Book of Life praise the Lord the first time I thought about that I cried like a baby my name might not be written on any book on this Earth I'm glad to know my name is in the lamb Book of Life he is The Giver of names don't fail God no matter what your life is going through he's using it to make a name he's making a name not for you for himself for himself he's making a name that's what adoption is adoption is when the father take his rink and St it his name the son name is good as the son that is adoption when God has taken you through your trials and bring you to the place where when you stand look it's getting tough people laish is swimming in people are lossing their faith they are lossing their ground with God they are ling their experience with God no matter what God is taking you through don't let it to sweep you up don't let it to carry you he's your maker he's the maker of names he might be using illness he might be using one problem or another maybe the financial situation or whatever you are going through you know the reason why situation can hurt us in this life is because we think our name is temper with me me are we allow that to happen me me me because you think your name is temper
