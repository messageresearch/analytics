[2:20] yet there was no Beauty we should desire
[2:23] him when this virgin born son of the
[2:27] Living God
[2:30] become so perfect and humble and in the
[2:33] image of God until the Great Master who
[2:36] had brought his life up through the
[2:37] prophets and he was a fulfilling of all
[2:40] the prophets he was so perfect until God
[2:45] seeing
[2:47] this he smote him and cried out
[2:53] speak as Michelangelo did
[2:57] speak you say is that so St Mark 9:7 we
[3:02] find upon on the mount
[3:04] Transfiguration when there stood Moses
[3:08] the law there stood Elijah the prophets
[3:11] all the way back from the Patriarchs of
[3:14] fathers the law the prophets and all of
[3:17] them stand there we hear a voice coming
[3:19] down from the cloud and said this is my
[3:22] beloved
[3:23] Son hear ye him and if they're going to
[3:27] hear he's got to speak just a few days
[3:30] before he was smitten amen this is my
[3:33] son who I'm pleased to dwell
[3:37] in I have molded him I've been 4,000
[3:41] years bringing him to
[3:43] this and now he is so perfect I've got
[3:47] to Smite him so he can
[3:50] speak hear ye him he's the perfected one
[3:55] he he is the
[3:58] Masterpiece remember he was portrayed
[4:00] all times back to the Old Testament we
[4:03] find him being The Rock in the
[4:05] wilderness that was smitten Rock in the
[4:07] wilderness I am that rock that was in
[4:09] the wilderness but that was a
[4:13] stone that had not come to its
[4:15] Perfection yet but in tight form it
[4:19] followed the church to draw from it that
[4:23] that he could draw give life to those
[4:26] who he could give life to but he was
[4:29] that rock in in the wilderness he had
[4:31] not been made man yet he was only en
[4:34] typed Moses saw him standing on this
[4:37] rock he saw him pass by and he said it's
[4:40] the back part of a man you see the
[4:44] sculpture was presenting to
[4:48] Moses which was a potential image of
[4:52] Christ what the Great Masterpiece would
[4:56] look like when it was perfected he
[4:58] passed his he injected or or projected
[5:03] to Moses the vision of what the
[5:06] Masterpiece is go to look like it was
[5:09] the back part of a man when it passed by
[5:13] in the
[5:14] wilderness remember Angelo could only
[5:17] cry out and smite the image and say
[5:21] speak but how different it was to God
[5:23] the great sculpture when he made a man
[5:25] in his own image so perfect that it
[5:27] reflected him God SP through the image
[5:31] of
[5:32] man showing what he would do he spoke
[5:35] through the prophets as they were in
[5:37] their potential image as his bringing up
[5:41] to the head but when he come in the head
[5:42] he was all the image of God Amen he was
[5:46] portraying
[5:47] himself then smitten for us now he is
[5:51] the Masterpiece to us the gift of God
[5:56] Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we
[5:59] never forget that as we see the days
[6:01] darkening as we see the Shadows falling
[6:05] when I predicted just a few more turns
[6:07] of the sun this nation's gone do you
[6:11] know
[6:13] yesterday Fourth of
[6:16] July or Thomas
[6:18] Jefferson had signed the Declaration of
[6:21] Independence him and the other uh board
[6:24] that was with him and the liberty bell
[6:26] rang and we was declared in Independence
[6:28] as a nation
[6:30] according to history there has never
[6:31] been a democracy at any time last over
[6:34] 200 years that was 1776 July the
[6:39] 4th and we're just 11 years
[6:43] left will it make it
[6:47] no can't 11 years and if it does it'll
[6:51] break all
[6:52] history and we see the condition of time
[6:56] we see the condition of the people we
[6:59] see the condition of politics we see the
[7:02] condition of the world it can't
[7:07] stand it's got to sink like the
[7:10] Titanic it must go down for there's give
[7:15] room one nation gives room to another as
[7:19] it falls and this Kingdom Must Fall in
[7:23] ever other Kingdom to give room to that
[7:25] Kingdom that's
[7:27] coming which cannot Paul
[7:30] while we receive a kingdom that cannot
[7:32] be moved through this perfect image of
[7:35] God the
[7:37] Masterpiece God when he looked upon him
[7:40] he was so
[7:42] inspired he was so the seem the way he
[7:47] looked and to see the the form of him he
[7:51] was so inspired that it would be the
[7:54] perfect Masterpiece of a redeemer
[7:59] Jesus the
[8:01] Redeemer so God in order to be smitten
[8:05] himself because to pay his own penalty
[8:08] God and Christ became one so God could
[8:12] be smoked in the
[8:15] image he could be scarred and that's why
[8:18] Isaiah said we did Estee him smitten and
[8:21] Afflicted of God yet he was wounded for
[8:24] our transgressions he was bruised for
[8:27] our iniquity the Chas of our pieces upon
[8:30] on him and with his stripes we were
[8:31] healed the perfect image of God man God
[8:37] and IM marfia had changed from
[8:40] Supernatural to the vision and the
[8:43] vision was projected into the image and
[8:47] the image was smitten so that the
[8:49] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[8:53] death God's perfect
[8:55] Masterpiece he could not do it in Moses
[8:59] he could not do it in the prophets
[9:01] Isaiah who was saw with saws till he was
[9:04] saw to Pieces he could not do it in the
[9:07] prophets that were stoned he could not
[9:09] do it because he couldn't feel it there
[9:12] was just a potion of him but in this
[9:15] perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness
[9:18] of a godhead bodily he can not only
[9:21] project Moses he could project his
[9:23] entire being into this person and taste
[9:26] death for the whole human race
[9:29] God's perfect
[9:31] Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it
[9:35] you become the Redeemer of all ages to
[9:38] speak for those in the backgrounds who
[9:40] had been before and now all promises was
[9:44] met in him he was a Perfection of the
[9:48] Perfection all types is fulfilled in him
[9:52] our kinsman redeemer and Ruth and
[9:55] Boaz our lawgiver from Mount Sonia
[10:00] our Prophet from the
[10:02] Wilderness as he come from the mountain
[10:05] as he come from the Wilderness as he
[10:07] come from
[10:10] eternity and become man The Perfect
[10:14] Image God down through the age heing
[10:17] Away by the Patriarchs and made his
[10:18] platform and brought him up from the
[10:20] different things that he lay this
[10:22] Foundation upon upon this he begin to
[10:24] build his word the prophets and then
[10:25] finally come out to the perfect Prophet
[10:29] the perfect Foundation the perfect
[10:32] vision God
[10:35] had now in order for this to speak he is
[10:40] the
[10:41] word and for the word to speak he must
[10:44] come into the image and then for the
[10:47] image to speak has got to be
[10:50] smitten
[10:52] amen comes into the
[10:55] image and then in order to speak the
[10:58] perfect Redeemer
[11:00] all the types of the Old Testament was
[11:03] metting him as I said the other day
[11:05] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[11:08] the new yes like many of you man women
[11:14] my age we used to have around the
[11:16] country a lot of Chinese
[11:18] laundries when the Chinese first started
[11:21] in they come from the West Coast moving
[11:24] Eastward coming over from the Eastern
[11:27] country moving this way
[11:29] and uh as they did they were people who
[11:32] were not acquainted with our language
[11:34] and our ways but they were fine
[11:39] laundrymen and uh they couldn't write
[11:41] the ticket so you could get your right
[11:43] laundry back but the chinan he got
[11:47] himself a bunch of little
[11:49] cards with nothing on it at
[11:52] all so when you come for your laundry he
[11:56] would take this card and tear it in a
[11:58] certain way
[12:00] and hand you one piece and he kept the
[12:03] other
[12:05] piece and now it's a little better than
[12:08] what we have now because when you come
[12:11] back to claim what was your
[12:15] own those two pieces must
[12:18] dovetail you couldn't impersonate it if
[12:21] you had to there's no way of you can
[12:24] make copies of letters but you can't
[12:26] impersonate that tear
[12:29] it's got to fit exactly with the other
[12:33] piece Therefore your dirty clothes that
[12:37] you brought
[12:38] in you could redeem them by this ticket
[12:41] because it match the ticket that was
[12:43] turned
[12:44] in and when
[12:47] God by the prophets and under the law
[12:50] condemned us to
[12:51] sin and the law has no Grace it's only
[12:56] tells you you are a sinner
[12:59] but when Jesus came on the scene he was
[13:03] the
[13:04] Fulfillment he was the the Fulfillment
[13:07] of everything God had promised he was a
[13:10] perfect identical image of the promise
[13:14] amen therefore all Promises of the Old
[13:18] Testament was met in Jesus Christ it
[13:21] couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be
[13:23] met in hand the prophets but it was met
[13:25] in the Masterpiece it matched all that
[13:28] it said it was is going to
[13:30] be so will the church have to be a match
[13:35] to everything God has promised amen amen
[13:38] must be that piece is smitten off of
[13:42] it so if the original is the word so
[13:46] will the subject just been taken from it
[13:48] be the
[13:50] word to match its
[13:53] side therefore the Chim you could claim
[13:57] where the law condem and said you were
[14:00] dirty and you were guilty and could put
[14:03] you in the
[14:05] prison but when he came he was the match
[14:09] piece for it that could take you out and
[14:12] bring you back to to be the complete
[14:17] ticket the Redemption that God had
[14:20] promised back in the Garden of Eden thy
[14:22] seed shall bruise the Serpent's head but
[14:24] his uh heel shall bruise uh uh bruise
[14:28] its head
[14:30] now we find this perfect Masterpiece
[14:34] that God had
[14:36] completed now we notice that he was all
[14:39] that it was promised to be he all the
[14:42] promises all the prophecies everything
[14:45] that God had made a promise of thy seed
[14:48] shall bruise the Serpent's head now he
[14:51] could not bruise it with the law he
[14:54] could not bruise it with the prophets
[14:56] but he did do it
[14:59] when the woman's seed became the
[15:03] Masterpiece Christ he was a stone that
[15:07] Daniel saw Hue out of the mountain he
[15:10] was the one could Smite he's the one
[15:12] that could bruise bruise the Serpent's
[15:16] head his life matched exactly the
[15:20] life of Moses his life matched David
[15:26] let's see if it was if he's the matching
[15:28] pie
[15:29] notice David a rejected King over his
[15:33] own
[15:34] people he was one day while he was his
[15:37] own son rose up in Mutiny against him
[15:41] and he separated and divided the armies
[15:43] of
[15:44] Israel and he was David was drove or
[15:49] driven by his own people from his
[15:53] throne and on he rolled
[15:56] out there was a man who hat
[16:00] him and he's walking along there
[16:03] spitting on
[16:04] David that guard pulled his sword said
[16:07] I'll let that dog's head stay on him
[16:09] spit on my
[16:10] King David said let him
[16:14] alone God told him to do it don't you
[16:18] see a man of sorrow acquainted with
[16:21] grief he stands like a sheep before
[16:24] shears
[16:25] [Music]
[16:27] Dum he said that for perhaps David
[16:29] didn't know what he was saying but about
[16:33] 5 600 years afterwards or a little
[16:37] more the son of David was going through
[16:39] them same streets amen and he was spit
[16:45] upon but notice what happened when David
[16:47] out of his out of his when he became a
[16:50] fugitive and out of his Exile when he
[16:52] when he came back that man begged for
[16:55] peace and mercy even those who him we'll
[16:59] see him one day when he
[17:03] returns and we find out then in Joseph
[17:07] as Joseph was a peculiar Barn boy the
[17:11] last the top part of the
[17:13] foundation or the Masterpiece was to be
[17:15] built upon it come from faith and to
[17:19] love and to Grace it come to
[17:25] Perfection and so did it from the feet
[17:27] of the beginning come forth unto
[17:30] perfection in Christ notice how that he
[17:34] was portrayed in Joseph the top of the
[17:38] foundation the most perfect of all of
[17:41] them we find that Joseph was born to his
[17:46] family and he was by the legal woman
[17:50] actually which was um Jacob's
[17:56] wife and notice
[17:59] also that when he was born his father
[18:02] loved him and his brothers hated him
[18:04] without a cause why did they hate
[18:08] him because he was the
[18:11] word
[18:13] amen see the very
[18:16] Foundation see how the head of the
[18:18] foundation come look at the head of the
[18:19] body comes I watch the head of the Bride
[18:24] come he was the
[18:26] word and they hated him
[18:29] because he was a
[18:31] sear he foresaw things and told him they
[18:34] happened no matter how long it lingered
[18:36] it happened just the same and by being
[18:39] spiritual he was excommunicated from his
[18:43] Brethren they ought to have loved him
[18:46] but they hated him because he was a
[18:49] prophet he was spiritual and they hated
[18:52] him notice he was sold for almost 30
[18:55] pieces of silver thrown into a ditch and
[18:59] supposedly be dead but was tuck up from
[19:02] the ditch and in his time of Temptation
[19:05] the prison the Butler and the the baker
[19:09] we know that the butler was saved and
[19:11] the baker was lost and in Christ's
[19:14] prison house on the cross one was saved
[19:17] and the other was lost two
[19:20] thieves two
[19:22] wrongdoers and we notice he was taken
[19:25] from his prison to the right hand of
[19:30] Pharaoh that no man could speak to
[19:33] Pharaoh only through Joseph and when
[19:35] Joseph left that Throne of pharaoh the
[19:38] trumpet sounded throughout Egypt the
[19:41] blast went forth and said bow that he
[19:43] everybody Joseph is coming
[19:46] forth so will it be with
[19:49] Jesus how he was loved of the father and
[19:54] hated of them denominational
[19:56] Brethren Without a Cause he was sold for
[19:59] 30 pieces of silver as it was and put
[20:01] into the ditch supposedly to be dead on
[20:04] the cross one lost and the other and
[20:05] saved and was lifted up from the cross
[20:08] and sets at the right hand of God in the
[20:11] Majesty of the great
[20:13] spirit which have been reflected in him
[20:16] and no man can speak to God only through
[20:18] Jesus
[20:20] Christ thank of it and when he leaves
[20:23] that Throne starts forth a trumpet of
[20:26] sound and every knee shall bow now and
[20:29] every tongue shall confess amen remember
[20:32] he was a son of prosperity everything
[20:35] that he did prospered whereever his
[20:37] prisoner whever it was it come out right
[20:40] and has he promised for his children and
[20:42] they make everything work together for
[20:45] the good whe it was sickness prison
[20:47] house death Sorrows whatever it was they
[20:49] would work for the good to them that
[20:51] loved
[20:52] [Music]
[20:54] him he promised it it must be so
[20:59] it's got to be there it's figurative
[21:01] spoke to us in himn he was that perfect
[21:04] image of
[21:05] God now we see here
[21:09] also that when he comes again remember
[21:13] Joseph by
[21:15] Revelation Save the World by his great
[21:19] prophecy the world would have
[21:22] died if it hadn't been for Joseph and
[21:25] the world would would been dead if it
[21:29] hadn't been for Jesus for God so loved
[21:32] the world that he gave his only begotten
[21:34] son that whosoever believeth on him
[21:36] should not perish God is reserving
[21:41] life on and on we could go because he
[21:45] was simply the match of David he was the
[21:48] match of Moses he was the match of
[21:50] Elijah he was the match of Joseph
[21:53] everything is a portrayed or foretold by
[21:56] in the Old Testament match into that
[21:59] what is it showing a perfect Redeemer
[22:03] that we can put our old dirty clothes
[22:05] into the laundry go claim it again has
[22:07] been washed in the blood of the lamb
[22:10] praise the Lord
[22:13] hallelujah we can claim what's our own
[22:17] and everything that he died for we can
[22:20] claim
[22:21] it so he was a perfect word portrayed it
[22:25] pleased God the great sculpture to Smite
[22:29] him and to do it this way we see him in
[22:33] Isaiah here is read we all did a Ste him
[22:37] we turned our face from him there's no
[22:39] beauty that we should desire him
[22:40] everybody talking about him make fun of
[22:42] him I'm talking about him now in this
[22:44] day everybody making fun of him see we
[22:48] did esteem him we saw him esteem means
[22:51] to look at we did Este him smitten
[22:54] Afflicted of
[22:56] God yet he what did he do this far he
[22:59] was wounded for our
[23:01] transgressions amen he was bruised for
[23:03] our
[23:04] iniquity now we could go on and on with
[23:08] that but I believe you had the picture
[23:09] of what I mean now God building back his
[23:13] Masterpiece but let us not
[23:16] forget that in the beginning when he
[23:19] smoke the side of Adam he took something
[23:21] from his
[23:25] side now the smiting of Christ this was
[23:28] for a
[23:30] cause that he might take from
[23:33] him one to be a family the
[23:37] bride you might take him a bride so when
[23:41] his Masterpiece was
[23:44] perfected then he had to Smite
[23:48] it to take from him not another piece
[23:53] not another
[23:54] creation but all the same creation
[23:59] my brother don't think bad of this but
[24:02] think a minute if he took from him the
[24:06] original creation to make the
[24:08] [Music]
[24:09] bride for
[24:11] him he never made another creation he
[24:15] took a part of the original
[24:19] creation then if he was the word what
[24:23] must the bride
[24:26] be it's got to be the original word
[24:31] Living God in the
[24:36] word Kimberly South Africa once I was
[24:40] looking at diamonds how they was brought
[24:42] up out of the ground and I seen him
[24:44] laying there as well the the
[24:47] superintendent of the plant or the mine
[24:49] was one of my ushers in the prayer line
[24:52] and uh I noticed the diamonds valued at
[24:55] tens of thousands of dollars piled
[24:57] together but they didn't Sparkle even
[24:59] under the light and I said to the
[25:02] superintendent of the mindes I said why
[25:04] don't they sparkle he said sir they
[25:06] haven't been cut
[25:08] yet they must be cut then when they are
[25:12] cut then they reflect the
[25:14] light there you
[25:17] are the Masterpiece must be cut
[25:22] notice cut for what is the piece cut off
[25:25] no no the piece is cut off is made of
[25:28] betr
[25:28] needle and the victrola needle is put
[25:31] upon a a a record that's unseen music to
[25:36] the world but the needle is what brings
[25:39] it
[25:40] out brings out the true interpretation
[25:43] of the word
[25:51] [Music]
