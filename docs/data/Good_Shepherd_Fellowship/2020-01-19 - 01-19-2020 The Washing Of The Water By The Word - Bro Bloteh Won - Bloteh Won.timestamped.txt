[43:59] that was left with the church by our
[44:01] Lord Jesus that is baptism in the name
[44:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ convenient the

[46:12] that God you will come for the parents

[46:32] everyone of whom
[46:35] [Music]
[46:37] we love you Father we appreciate you
[46:41] Lord father is so comforting there in
[46:46] such a time we can learn to draw
[46:49] strength from your word we can have the
[46:52] courage Lord and strength to come into
[46:55] your presence of God Lord Jesus we even
[46:59] now once again remember Danny's wife
[47:02] sister fat Eliza
[47:04] they mourn their loss to God I also did
[47:07] happen sometime this week
[47:09] we just pray father Lord bless them Oh
[47:13] God in Jesus
[47:15] [Music]
[47:21] principal and so as I was saying
[47:31] normally when we do have the convenient
[47:34] the sisters would go over into the cry
[47:37] room for the fourth watching
[47:41] so and to find out that sometimes it can
[47:50] be disrupting because they have to take
[47:55] care of the children and and I think
[47:58] it's a big sacrifice you know I think
[48:01] it's a big sacrifice most of the time we
[48:04] are in the service and a little try you
[48:07] know it's bad because of something maybe
[48:10] hungry and try to be faceted maybe want
[48:13] to play and it's so easy you know for
[48:16] for us to feel offended because it looks
[48:19] like we've been disrupted but it's a lot
[48:22] of sacrifice and on the part of those
[48:26] parents whether is the father or the
[48:29] mother that we take the child out there
[48:31] just for our comfort praise the Lord
[48:35] just for us to be able to enjoy the
[48:39] service or enjoy the preaching of the
[48:42] world without a child fussing a mother
[48:44] will go back there and try to attain to
[48:47] the child and him even focus on what
[48:50] what has been preached I believe that's
[48:53] a big sacrifice amen
[48:55] if someone can be able to to seek your
[48:59] comfort praise the Lord and and we
[49:02] should commend them for that but the
[49:05] other day when we come over to
[49:12] the communion and and just as I said all
[49:17] the time you know is it's all part of
[49:21] the service when we get down to that
[49:23] time of foot washing so most of the time
[49:25] with the brothers we stay right in here
[49:28] and you know I stay here and go down and
[49:33] do the foot washing and then I come back
[49:36] and get ready to leave the service I
[49:38] don't know what's going on back there
[49:40] and but I think the sisters are shared
[49:43] they are concerned they also want to be
[49:45] part of that praying moment when they're
[49:48] watching want another feed they want to
[49:50] be able to pray with one another and and
[49:54] not having the children to be disturbing
[49:57] and sometimes you know some of the
[50:02] families I I knew to to communion how
[50:06] I'll say I'm I'm very proud of this
[50:08] local church meaning has come to really
[50:14] experience the for the completion of all
[50:18] the ordinance in this local assembly and
[50:21] many would take a First Communion in
[50:24] this local assembly meaning you know or
[50:26] partake or for watching in this local
[50:29] assembly and and and as a church I'm
[50:32] very proud of that that we can be able
[50:36] to encourage you to to to fulfill that
[50:41] part of the word jesus said you know
[50:44] were happy at them that know these
[50:46] things and do this and so there's a
[50:48] blessing that goes with it so we we
[50:53] spoke with the sisters and
[50:55] and they all share their concern so our
[50:58] next coming up communion service we will
[51:02] have the sisters using using this space
[51:07] for the effort watching and we pretty
[51:12] much do with the same we have the
[51:14] bathing all to the front and some of the
[51:16] sisters will stay at the back and
[51:18] helping to keep the babies quiet while
[51:22] some come forward and do the for
[51:25] watching and then go and help the other
[51:27] sisters and then we the brothers will go
[51:29] out there in in the foyer and we will do
[51:34] our foot washing there and we will keep
[51:36] you in prayer until they are done and
[51:39] then the becomes will let us know and
[51:41] then we will come right back in here and
[51:44] close the service praise the Lord
[51:47] so we will try to approach it like that
[51:51] and see if we can be able to reduce some
[51:56] of the disturbance a and because you
[52:01] know you walk out of here and you go out
[52:04] there looks like this place is separated
[52:07] from out there but it's all part of the
[52:10] building it's all part of the service
[52:11] you know that is the reason why in the
[52:14] cry room we try to put a monitor that if
[52:17] if if a sister is back there she can be
[52:20] able to follow the service right in the
[52:22] foyer we have a monitor there because
[52:25] it's all part of the service and
[52:27] sometimes we take you know the attitude
[52:32] when we get right out of that door we
[52:34] think we are out of the service and
[52:35] sometimes we find a label here to be
[52:38] able to talk and then it's a small
[52:41] building when you start talking we
[52:42] hearing everything you are saying anyway
[52:45] so we want to kind of work on that we
[52:49] have just a few hours to spend yet and
[52:52] we want to be able to enjoy the best
[52:54] that we can in the service of the Lord
[52:57] praise the Lord so what you know
[53:01] thinking on that last night in knowing I
[53:06] was going to talk about that
[53:07] a little bit I choose this morning to
[53:10] speak a little bit on watching of the
[53:14] water by the word praise the Lord and
[53:17] because I was growing over there in my
[53:22] future
[53:23] I'm thus in John chapter 13 and Jesus
[53:26] said to Peter what I do unto you you
[53:31] know that he says but you will know year
[53:34] after you know so I kind of a pause on
[53:40] that a little bit last night and
[53:42] meditated on that and then I said well I
[53:45] would just change my course of what I
[53:47] want to speak on and I would speak on on
[53:50] on that a little bit the washing of the
[53:53] water by the word
[53:55] like Paul say in the book of Ephesians
[53:57] so let's stand to our feet musicians
[53:59] thank you and we'll have you back in a
[54:02] little bit so we can be able to water
[54:05] this world with some praise and we're
[54:10] just into I was feeding on all the word
[54:13] efficient Chapter five
[54:27] Ephesians chapter 5 I had to go back and
[54:34] last night and look for a very old
[54:37] notebook that I used many years ago
[54:40] teaching on the Tabernacles and I was
[54:42] growing - I was looking for setting
[54:49] tabernacle approach because I wanted to
[54:53] use that tonight I mean this morning I
[54:55] don't have a ball here I could have done
[54:59] some writing now for you but I would
[55:01] just take my time this morning and
[55:04] believe that the Lord would kind of a
[55:07] bless what we have to do praise the Lord
[55:09] Amen this is sufficient chapter 5 let's
[55:13] read from verse 25 and the scripture
[55:18] reads husband love your wife even as
[55:22] Christ also loved the church and gave
[55:25] himself for it there he might sanctify
[55:30] and cleanse it waive the watching of
[55:37] water by the word that he might present
[55:43] it to himself a glorious church not
[55:47] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[55:52] but that issue be holy and without blame
[55:58] praise the Lord
[56:00] let's pray together father in the name
[56:03] of the Lord Jesus we have read your
[56:05] sacral world we now ask you Father for
[56:08] inspiration to speak and Lord also
[56:11] inspiration to be able to hear from you
[56:14] this morning speak to our hearts Lord in
[56:16] a way that only you came in Jesus name
[56:19] Amen praise the Lord Allah bless you may
[56:22] have your seat so like I said well I was
[56:27] I was just
[56:30] looking over the convenience and
[56:35] lowering that I was going to talk a
[56:37] little bit about this foot washing thing
[56:44] that we we have talked with the sisters
[56:49] and I mean when I was approached on it I
[56:53] told the sister that I was so blessed
[56:56] that that you know that we got to know
[56:59] what was happening back there because
[57:01] I've always been thinking I don't go
[57:03] back to anything and we try to keep it
[57:06] decent because the sisters are bearing
[57:09] and the annealing and you're watching
[57:12] one another feet and it must be just
[57:14] among them so we don't go there to see
[57:16] what is happening and but we were glad
[57:19] to know that I needed some help and we
[57:24] do our best to be able to keep it
[57:27] decently and in order
[57:28] so this morning we want to talk a little
[57:30] bit on the washing of the water by the
[57:33] word
[57:34] so like I said I just want to just look
[57:38] at a little bit of a tabernacle order
[57:40] because this this this order actually
[57:47] came from the Old Testament the entire
[57:50] order of feet watching it came from the
[57:54] Old Testament so I want to look at that
[57:58] a little bit this morning and let's go
[58:02] to st. John chapter 13 there was word
[58:05] Jesus literally taught his disciples he
[58:11] said you call me Lord and Master and
[58:13] wish of course I am and if I a Lord and
[58:18] Master
[58:19] watch your feet you ought to watch one
[58:22] another feet praise the Lord amen
[58:36] since John chapter 13 reading from verse
[58:39] tool and supper being ended the devil
[58:42] having now pulled into the heart of
[58:44] Judas Iscariot so much Simon son to
[58:46] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[58:49] had given all things into his hand and
[58:52] that he was come from God and went to
[58:56] God he rises from supper and laid aside
[58:59] his garment and took a tower and gather
[59:02] himself after that he poured water into
[59:06] the basin and began to wash the
[59:08] disciples feet and to wet them with the
[59:11] towel wherewith he was gathered then
[59:13] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said
[59:16] unto Him Lord dost thou wash my feet and
[59:22] Jesus said unto Him what I what I do
[59:27] that knoweth not now but - I know yeah
[59:34] after and Peter said unto him thou shalt
[59:38] never wash my feet jesus said unto him
[59:40] if I wash the net they have no part with
[59:45] me
[59:46] amen Jesus first said unto him what I do
[59:50] now you don't know it amen but you will
[59:53] get to know it year after praise the
[59:55] Lord amen and just like we said last
[1:00:02] week this was a dispensation where Grace
[1:00:05] and Lord was embracing amen all of the
[1:00:10] things that were done under the law will
[1:00:12] find their fulfillment in this
[1:00:14] dispensation with our Lord Jesus being
[1:00:17] the fulfillment of the Lord praise the
[1:00:21] Lord like the scripture says no man is
[1:00:24] saved by the Lord no man can be
[1:00:26] justified by the law but the Lord had an
[1:00:30] expression of what God's desire was for
[1:00:33] his people and now he will come right
[1:00:36] under the dispensation of grace to be
[1:00:39] able to fulfill his desire that he was
[1:00:43] expressing honor the Lord now so we see
[1:00:46] here and the end the conference
[1:00:49] goes further from there Simon Peter said
[1:00:53] unto Him Lord not my not my feet on it
[1:00:57] but also my hands in my head and jesus
[1:01:01] said unto him he that is watch needed
[1:01:06] not save to watch his feet but his claim
[1:01:11] every way and yeah I claim but not all
[1:01:15] praise the Lord
[1:01:17] now so Jesus bring out another plain
[1:01:20] that he that is watch need now safe to
[1:01:25] watch on his feet he have to work
[1:01:27] because he has already been watch now
[1:01:30] when you look through the scripture the
[1:01:33] first time the Bible who actually speaks
[1:01:37] our feet watching will be Genesis
[1:01:40] chapter 18 amen and it will be Abraham
[1:01:48] receiving those three men praise the
[1:01:52] Lord is it is is it's amazing that
[1:01:56] Abraham the father of our faith some of
[1:02:00] the things that adhere to our faith was
[1:02:03] fulfilled in his life amen
[1:02:08] because he's the father of our faith
[1:02:11] Genesis chapter 15 there was were a God
[1:02:17] necessary give Abraham communion there
[1:02:21] was the very beginning of communion when
[1:02:25] Abraham returned back from the slaughter
[1:02:27] of the king and and he was able to
[1:02:30] redeem the people back a girl came in
[1:02:34] the form of mecca's Erik and break bread
[1:02:37] and gave Abraham wine and bread are we
[1:02:43] together now so you see these things if
[1:02:46] they were not important God would not
[1:02:49] put it in the foundation amen this was
[1:02:55] just after the ark after God has brought
[1:03:01] a judgment to that antediluvian
[1:03:04] age and now he was going to start
[1:03:07] another dispensation he called a man
[1:03:10] Abraham that he gave a promise and right
[1:03:15] in the life in God dealing with Abraham
[1:03:19] he laid out these things praise the Lord
[1:03:26] but then talking on Todd is right there
[1:03:29] in in in the life of Abraham so they are
[1:03:37] very fundamental to the priest and faith
[1:03:42] but that was the first time Genesis
[1:03:45] chapter 18 verse 4 when those men came
[1:03:48] Abraham
[1:03:49] washed their feet and then he served
[1:03:51] their meal praise the Lord amen
[1:03:55] the last time the scripture will talk
[1:03:58] about watching I would get to there
[1:04:02] praise the Lord let me net even go back
[1:04:06] the last time will be Revelation chapter
[1:04:09] 7 verse 14 there will be when the
[1:04:12] foolish virgin we have to watch her guy
[1:04:16] I mean in the blood of the Lamb there
[1:04:24] will be the last watching that will be
[1:04:26] done before we go into the Millennium
[1:04:30] and what actually it is is there will be
[1:04:34] those Bible believing god-fearing
[1:04:37] Christians there will not go in the
[1:04:40] rapture and we have to stand against the
[1:04:46] beast in his deception because they will
[1:04:51] refuse to take the mark of the beast and
[1:04:53] we have to die for the effect and the
[1:04:58] scripture calls there in Revelation 7:14
[1:05:01] that they are watching the arad in the
[1:05:04] blood in the blood of the Lamb now it's
[1:05:07] not the literal lambs blood because they
[1:05:10] will be killed but what will
[1:05:13] be the blood that they will be watching
[1:05:15] they will be standing for the word of
[1:05:16] God amen
[1:05:21] they will be standing for truth that in
[1:05:24] know in that time praise the Lord Amen
[1:05:31] so that's when the scripture point out
[1:05:33] the last form of watching but we want to
[1:05:36] get into this watching of the water by
[1:05:39] the word what what what was actually
[1:05:42] Jesus are bringing to to his disciple
[1:05:46] what was he introducing to the church
[1:05:50] praise the Lord are we together let's
[1:05:57] stay together
[1:05:58] praise the Lord amen amen amen
[1:06:04] now when you go over to to the book of
[1:06:11] Exodus when you go over to the book of
[1:06:15] Exodus you will realize right at the
[1:06:24] time of the Exodus
[1:06:25] God sent Israel a prophet and there was
[1:06:30] Moses praise the Lord
[1:06:33] he sent Israel a prophet and this very
[1:06:37] man Moses was the man that ran from
[1:06:40] Egypt one time because I mean he killed
[1:06:44] an Egyptian and he ran awaiting and he
[1:06:47] choose to change his profession to start
[1:06:50] raising sheep and God had to meet him
[1:06:52] and send him back to go and face his
[1:06:54] fear amen God likes for us to face our
[1:06:57] fear while he likes us to face our fear
[1:07:01] because he don't want us to be afraid he
[1:07:07] sees fear net so he always sent you to
[1:07:11] go and face your fear praise the Lord
[1:07:13] Amen now so they're over in Exodus
[1:07:22] chapter 28
[1:07:25] in Exeter chapter 28 we will do a little
[1:07:30] kind of for Bible studies this morning
[1:07:39] just bear with me now we have to go back
[1:07:42] and forth a little bit
[1:07:51] exodus chapter 28 the scripture says and
[1:07:59] take down onto the errand that brother
[1:08:03] and his sons with him from among the
[1:08:07] children of Israel that they may
[1:08:11] minister unto me in the priesthood
[1:08:13] office even air Aaron and neither in a
[1:08:19] bear hole and eleiza and última Aaron
[1:08:25] songs now what I read the scripture for
[1:08:29] is to show a principle year now God is
[1:08:33] telling Moses take Aaron in his sons
[1:08:37] from among the children of Israel of a
[1:08:42] true from the sons of Jacob the
[1:08:45] priesthood was given to Levi
[1:08:47] when Jacob distributed the blessings
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:53] when he distributed the blessings to his
[1:08:55] sons he gave the priesthood to live on
[1:08:59] but he received that God honor this
[1:09:01] dispensation of an accident where God is
[1:09:05] calling the people how to start dealing
[1:09:07] with him he raised a prophet and now
[1:09:10] he's telling the Prophet now the Prophet
[1:09:13] is the one that is going to call the
[1:09:16] priests who now even though there was a
[1:09:20] tribe that the priests who was giving to
[1:09:22] all of the blessing of Jacob but now all
[1:09:26] of this dispensation Moses the Prophet
[1:09:28] he's the one now going to corridors a
[1:09:32] calling now to the Ministry of the
[1:09:35] priests who is going to be honoring a
[1:09:37] prophetic call are we together now so
[1:09:45] because why this is important the reason
[1:09:50] why this is important is because when a
[1:09:56] biram when those men stood against Moses
[1:10:01] in the wilderness they were not wrong
[1:10:05] in the way that they conceived it in
[1:10:09] their mind because they were also of the
[1:10:12] tribe of Levi and I calling to the
[1:10:16] blessing of Jacob the priesthood was
[1:10:19] given to the tribe of Levi and we
[1:10:23] together so when they complained to the
[1:10:25] people their complain was Moses is of
[1:10:29] the tribe of Levi I'm of the tribe of
[1:10:31] Levi why is Moses making itself so
[1:10:34] special praise Allah but when you come
[1:10:39] to this scripture you will see why Moses
[1:10:42] was was making himself in his brother
[1:10:45] special because the Lord had told him to
[1:10:48] call Aaron in his sons to the Ministry
[1:10:54] of the priesthood which ministry was
[1:10:57] above that is the reason why if you read
[1:11:00] the Old Testament you will see there's a
[1:11:02] difference the Old Testament have a
[1:11:04] place where it talks about a Levitical
[1:11:06] priests who and it also speaks of the
[1:11:09] priests who of Aaron praise the Lord
[1:11:15] are we together now so that is the
[1:11:22] reason why you will see there it took a
[1:11:26] prophet of the New Testament for in a
[1:11:31] book of efficient to be able to rightly
[1:11:34] place the fight for ministry it was Paul
[1:11:42] that spoke about the calling of a pastor
[1:11:45] the calling of an evangelist the calling
[1:11:48] in Jesus day they were all called
[1:11:50] disciples or Jesus in it or they were
[1:11:53] all known as an apostle but it took Paul
[1:11:58] to be able to rightly define those
[1:12:02] ministry why because it's a prophet that
[1:12:09] do the calling are we together
[1:12:19] praise the Lord Amen now let's drop down
[1:12:28] the little bit in the same Exodus
[1:12:33] chapter 28
[1:12:41] let's get down to verse 40
[1:13:03] praise the Lord amen
[1:13:17] and it's a place here I want to hold us
[1:13:23] a little bit before we get them to to
[1:13:28] their verse 40 now remember what we want
[1:13:33] to talk about yet is the watching of the
[1:13:36] word about the word amen
[1:13:47] now over in verse 40 and for the one you
[1:13:54] will see were reading from verse 39 it
[1:13:58] was all about Moses dressing Aaron and
[1:14:02] his sons but let's go over to verse
[1:14:05] chapter 29 the next chapter it will
[1:14:10] bring us right into what we want to look
[1:14:12] at this morning I hope now to keep you
[1:14:14] long but just bear with me
[1:14:16] amen I'm not on this fall for a long
[1:14:23] time I mean real trying to do a strip
[1:14:26] show teaching
[1:14:27] verse 1 in chapter 29 and this is the
[1:14:34] thing that thou shalt do unto them to
[1:14:38] hallow them to minister unto me now God
[1:14:43] is telling Moses what he should do to
[1:14:46] these people Aaron in his songs Amen for
[1:14:51] them to be able to minister unto me in
[1:14:55] the priest's office take one young
[1:14:58] bullet into ram without blemish and on
[1:15:03] living bread and cake on living tempered
[1:15:08] with oil and white and in waffle on
[1:15:12] living anointed with oil and wheat in
[1:15:15] flour shall they I'll make them and thou
[1:15:19] shalt put him into one basket and and
[1:15:24] bring them in the basket with the bullet
[1:15:30] and the to RAM now verse 4 and Aaron and
[1:15:35] his sons shall they bring to the door of
[1:15:40] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:15:43] thou shalt wash them with water amen
[1:15:50] now remember now Jesus told Peter say he
[1:15:54] that is watch need not whole body to be
[1:15:58] wash again he wanted me his feet to be
[1:16:01] now so keep that in your mind while we
[1:16:04] look at the scripture together and
[1:16:05] another thing I want us to remember here
[1:16:08] Aaron was Moses senior brother amen
[1:16:12] Aaron was Moses senior brother so what
[1:16:19] will happen here is that this man when
[1:16:22] they were called to the priesthood
[1:16:23] office
[1:16:24] Moses would take a vision like a bathtub
[1:16:29] and you will have to bring Aaron and his
[1:16:32] sons to the door of the tabernacle is
[1:16:34] covered with curtains he will have to
[1:16:37] put him down into this busy and he will
[1:16:41] wash him praise the Lord amen
[1:16:44] he will he will wash them and and as you
[1:16:50] as you go along and they shall take a
[1:16:53] garment and put it upon Aaron and a coat
[1:16:56] and rub and then you go down he will
[1:16:59] also have to anoint him so the the Moses
[1:17:03] the Prophet we have to watch the priests
[1:17:06] who he will have to dress them and he
[1:17:11] will have to anoint him now remember
[1:17:13] nanny in verse one this is what the Lord
[1:17:16] told Moses this is what you should do
[1:17:18] unto them for them to be priests in my
[1:17:21] office
[1:17:23] amen and just like Peter said in in in
[1:17:28] first Peter chapter two we are priests
[1:17:31] and kings even though our offices of
[1:17:36] priests and kings could be different
[1:17:38] because there were different things that
[1:17:40] they did in the tabernacle but yet all
[1:17:43] the priests the people that self in the
[1:17:47] tabernacle had to come through this
[1:17:49] order for them to step into their
[1:17:53] service they had to be watch praise the
[1:18:00] Lord
[1:18:01] they had to be watch I will tell you
[1:18:04] something something very funny not too
[1:18:07] funny but it's funny anything you know
[1:18:12] last Wednesday we when we were speaking
[1:18:14] we read that we read a code and and I
[1:18:17] had a comment on the court and and and
[1:18:19] says brother branham was not talking
[1:18:20] about bathtub but he said do you know in
[1:18:23] nineteen in 1872 the Medical Association
[1:18:26] of the United States turned down bathtub
[1:18:30] so I went back and started to make a
[1:18:32] research on it those things don't fly by
[1:18:37] mean so easy I went back and I started
[1:18:40] to make a research on it and they were
[1:18:44] there were some very very exciting
[1:18:46] research that I came across but one of
[1:18:48] them there were that was there was a bit
[1:18:51] funny to mean instead when the first
[1:18:53] started breaking the bathtub
[1:18:55] they have to get the Senate bathtub so
[1:19:00] in the house in in the in the house the
[1:19:04] people that are leading the country have
[1:19:05] to have a Senate bathtub so they had
[1:19:08] they had a bathtub in the Sun like I can
[1:19:10] give you the document you can read they
[1:19:12] had a beard and and and and the Senators
[1:19:15] had to go and take a bath praise the
[1:19:20] Lord
[1:19:21] and pretty soon every senator started
[1:19:23] putting bathtubs in their houses and and
[1:19:25] little on them then when it was approved
[1:19:28] then you know it started spraying so
[1:19:30] actually there was there was some reason
[1:19:33] why you know the Medical Association was
[1:19:36] looking at it because remember those
[1:19:39] days they did not have bathtubs oh yeah
[1:19:43] they have outhouses
[1:19:46] you know bathrooms were not attached to
[1:19:50] the homes like like beyond now you know
[1:19:54] bathrooms were away from the home
[1:19:57] because you know and people would go and
[1:20:00] take bath you know and all of that and
[1:20:01] then walk to their house and or death
[1:20:04] but it was it was interesting when I was
[1:20:06] looking into there praise the Lord I
[1:20:08] don't want to read the article I might
[1:20:10] just get myself I get get myself out of
[1:20:13] it but I just wanted to use that grab
[1:20:15] your grab your attention a little bit
[1:20:17] amen praise the Lord amen
[1:20:24] now so well
[1:20:28] so Moses will have to wash them in water
[1:20:31] like the scripture says and he will have
[1:20:35] to dress them and he will have to anoint
[1:20:38] him for them to be able to go into the
[1:20:41] priesthood office now it has a very very
[1:20:44] important significance that even even
[1:20:49] Paul is trying there toward the church
[1:20:53] the law that Christ had for his church
[1:20:56] to be able to certify his church cleans
[1:21:00] his church by the washing of the water
[1:21:03] by the word amen
[1:21:08] praise the Lord now you will see why the
[1:21:12] Apostle says we must net forsake the
[1:21:15] assembling of the scenes because that's
[1:21:17] what we do spiritually when we come to
[1:21:20] church praise the Lord
[1:21:25] now let's let's let's go a little bit
[1:21:32] together you
[1:21:38] now so when when the priest is watch
[1:21:51] after his watch let's drop down to verse
[1:21:53] 19 chapter 29 and thou shalt take the
[1:22:04] other RAM in Aaron and his sons Sons
[1:22:07] shall put their hands upon the head of
[1:22:10] the RAM and they're shy killed the RAM
[1:22:13] and take the blood take of his blood and
[1:22:18] put it upon the tip of their right ears
[1:22:21] the right ear of Aaron and upon the tip
[1:22:24] of the right ear of his sons and upon
[1:22:27] the tongue of the right hand and upon D
[1:22:33] a great toll now the priests after he's
[1:22:37] been watched
[1:22:38] he's been dressed he's been anointed he
[1:22:42] has to come and identify himself with
[1:22:45] his set with the sacrifice wishes the
[1:22:48] RAM amen
[1:22:49] you lay his hands upon the RAM and you
[1:22:53] know the RAM will be will be killed and
[1:22:56] then the blood will be taking with you
[1:22:59] no tip on his ear for what he years and
[1:23:01] his right hand for what he handles and
[1:23:04] also on his big toes for the places that
[1:23:06] he goes because now he's he's a seven
[1:23:11] that stands between God and the people
[1:23:15] praise the Lord
[1:23:16] he cannot be involved in every gossip he
[1:23:20] cannot be involved in you know scandal
[1:23:22] hen or masonry people money you know
[1:23:24] they cannot just he cannot just go you
[1:23:27] know every word because he's standing
[1:23:31] there is only one mediator between man
[1:23:35] and God scripture says that may Christ
[1:23:37] Jesus but the the priest who was a type
[1:23:40] of the Ministry of Jesus Christ that was
[1:23:44] standing between the people and the
[1:23:46] congregation I mean the people and the
[1:23:49] tabernacle let me say their way which is
[1:23:53] the right way anyway are we together
[1:23:58] praise the law so we see here that was
[1:24:02] the first form of watching
[1:24:04] the first form of watching was their
[1:24:07] entire body watching but to the
[1:24:11] tabernacle when he leaves from the door
[1:24:16] of the congregation where his watch
[1:24:18] before he gets to the tabernacle there
[1:24:21] is another lover amazing where he has to
[1:24:26] wash his feet before he goes in the
[1:24:31] tabernacle the first watching is the
[1:24:35] general body watching that's what we do
[1:24:39] by our confession when we accept the
[1:24:43] Lord Jesus Christ repent of our sin we
[1:24:46] have a general body identifying with
[1:24:49] Christ by baptism it's a general body
[1:24:53] watching that's the reason why
[1:24:55] sprinkling will not work
[1:24:59] poori will not work it has to be
[1:25:04] emerging if we will keep the tabernacle
[1:25:09] other are we together now so when the
[1:25:18] priests leaves from there let me let me
[1:25:21] bring their scripture up just now so we
[1:25:23] can be able to read they're together
[1:25:25] that speaks about the the lover at the
[1:25:32] tabernacle
[1:25:40] I just trying to nap carrying you in -
[1:25:44] you know these are the things that I
[1:25:47] wanna study hard to finish him in so I'm
[1:25:50] just trying to just stay right around
[1:25:51] you so we can we can be able to just
[1:25:56] deal with what we are dealing with
[1:25:59] praise the Lord let me let me get back a
[1:26:03] little bit just like I said you know we
[1:26:06] appreciate the sisters you know sisters
[1:26:10] or brothers you know that help take care
[1:26:12] of the children back there we appreciate
[1:26:17] all of their and it's a great blessing
[1:26:20] to us you know when we can when we can
[1:26:24] come on a social sense of discipline we
[1:26:27] have to know that is is our service to
[1:26:29] God and just like I said when we come to
[1:26:32] church like this God is our audience
[1:26:35] amen you are not the audience and I'm
[1:26:39] the speaker
[1:26:40] he's the audience he looks in at us
[1:26:44] what are we appraising what are we are
[1:26:47] sleeping or whatever we are doing he's
[1:26:49] the one that is looking at us I must be
[1:26:52] able to do my part by bringing the Word
[1:26:54] of God to you amen
[1:26:58] and you must do your part by receiving
[1:27:01] the Word of God and he knows if I'm
[1:27:05] sincere on that he knows if you are
[1:27:07] sincere on that because he's our
[1:27:09] audience
[1:27:15] praise the Lord
[1:27:18] our worship is on to him and like the
[1:27:21] scripture says unto Him the gathering of
[1:27:24] the people will be so this unto him that
[1:27:27] we are gathered now some time ago we had
[1:27:30] a sick issued in church and brother fell
[1:27:36] off in church and pretty soon everybody
[1:27:39] I mean most especially some of the
[1:27:43] brothers the sisters there were you know
[1:27:49] medically inclined went to help the
[1:27:52] situation but the part of it that I
[1:27:55] wanted to address and I was hoping to
[1:27:57] take my time to address it was how we
[1:28:00] deal with the children praise the Lord
[1:28:05] when we have a situation like that it's
[1:28:07] an uproar in church you know it's not
[1:28:10] something that is suspected in church
[1:28:12] but we must be able to handle the
[1:28:14] children we have to know that every
[1:28:18] spirit I mean every sickness is an evil
[1:28:22] spirit praise the Lord
[1:28:26] amen and we must be able to protect our
[1:28:31] children from those things
[1:28:39] and pretty soon all the little children
[1:28:41] was down there trying to see what was
[1:28:43] happening there was not decent parents
[1:28:47] is our responsibility it's our
[1:28:52] responsibility we must not have those
[1:28:57] things happening this is this is the
[1:29:00] Church of the Living God and like the
[1:29:03] scripture says is only the sick that
[1:29:06] needs a physician so for the matter of
[1:29:09] fact what I am wearing a necktie or net
[1:29:11] I come here I'm sick I'm needing the
[1:29:14] great physician to help me every one of
[1:29:20] us we have one need or another
[1:29:32] praise the Lord we don't have a card out
[1:29:35] there that tell people to fill up and
[1:29:37] tell them tell us about their situation
[1:29:39] your medical condition before they come
[1:29:41] in church we don't have that why because
[1:29:43] we believe there is a bombing dealer
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:47] there's a bombing dealer there's a great
[1:29:51] physician among the people we believe
[1:29:54] that the shout of the King is in the
[1:29:56] camp praise the Lord and we have seen
[1:30:03] God moving in different ways and doing
[1:30:06] the things that please him but you see
[1:30:09] this is that thing if we if we can just
[1:30:12] have those those you know simple respect
[1:30:17] and things you know in a book of
[1:30:18] quarantine I was thinking about that
[1:30:20] last night Paul said to the church he
[1:30:23] says this we are put in other when I
[1:30:26] come now for something to get in order
[1:30:30] they have to be at this other praise the
[1:30:35] Lord amen
[1:30:38] I knew every every one of us were
[1:30:42] surprised by what happened I thought
[1:30:44] that was not the best time to address it
[1:30:47] and but it was something that needed to
[1:30:51] be addressed even when we come to
[1:30:57] praying for the sake when someone come
[1:31:00] up to be pray for because the praying
[1:31:08] praying for the sake is just casting our
[1:31:10] spirit you know when when their spirit
[1:31:14] leaves the person that evil spirit
[1:31:16] leaves the person the medical science
[1:31:18] gave them nice name but they are demons
[1:31:22] no matter what name the medical science
[1:31:24] might give them their demons by the
[1:31:26] scripture they were called Devils
[1:31:36] you see that's the reason why we labor
[1:31:39] we try to do the best that we can to be
[1:31:42] able to keep a good atmosphere in this
[1:31:46] place amen
[1:31:48] it's not a place for eating if you want
[1:31:51] to feed the Tri take them back to the
[1:31:53] cry room praise the Lord
[1:32:05] or god bless you thank you for
[1:32:06] everything that you do to help us save
[1:32:09] the Lord the best way we can okay let's
[1:32:12] continue right here in this so you have
[1:32:15] to be watch and then let me take this
[1:32:26] scripture quickly and then I can be able
[1:32:30] to find a place here too
[1:32:46] Exeter chapter 40 Exodus chapter 40
[1:32:54] let's do this together
[1:33:03] now I have I have exited chapter 40 on
[1:33:07] mine now in my notes but I place it
[1:33:12] there in it in a different order and I
[1:33:18] will show you that when when we read
[1:33:20] they're together
[1:33:26] Exeter chapter 40 let's read from verse
[1:33:29] one and the Lord speak unto Moses saying
[1:33:31] on the first day of the first month
[1:33:35] there shall set of the tabernacle or the
[1:33:38] tents of the congregation and thou shalt
[1:33:42] put there in the Ark of the testimony
[1:33:47] and cover the ark with evil on a land
[1:33:54] deal in your mind and thou shalt break
[1:33:57] in the table and set in other the things
[1:34:01] that are to be set in order upon it and
[1:34:06] thou shalt bring in the candlestick and
[1:34:10] light the lamp there off and thou shalt
[1:34:16] set the author of gold upon the incense
[1:34:19] before the Ark of the type of testimony
[1:34:22] and put and put the hanging of the dog
[1:34:28] to the tabernacle on the line though in
[1:34:33] your mind and thou shalt set the altar
[1:34:36] of the burnt offering they're there for
[1:34:42] the burnt offering before sorry the door
[1:34:46] of the tabernacle of the tank of the
[1:34:50] congregation and thou shalt set the
[1:34:53] lover before the tent of the
[1:34:57] congregation and the altar and shall
[1:35:00] forth water they aim down the lava was
[1:35:02] the one that washed their feet before
[1:35:05] they just go right into the tabernacle
[1:35:08] now so but as you read this what a
[1:35:12] beautiful year is is Moses's ending
[1:35:16] this exeter talking about a tabernacle
[1:35:19] and the order of the tabernacle but see
[1:35:22] the beauty the beauty God instructed
[1:35:25] Moses and his instructed Moses to set
[1:35:28] the tabernacle from the inside outside
[1:35:34] do you notice that amen he's setting up
[1:35:41] the tabernacle and he's telling Moses
[1:35:44] that when the tabernacle is set up it
[1:35:46] must be set up from the inside outside
[1:35:49] is a tithe and a sign that God these
[1:35:53] with the individual from the inside
[1:35:55] outside praise the Lord it's miss it's
[1:36:02] not the works of the flesh amen and you
[1:36:06] will realize there are three doors to
[1:36:09] the tabernacle amen
[1:36:13] the first door is avail the second one
[1:36:17] is a door with coatings that tear one is
[1:36:20] a gate praise the Lord
[1:36:24] now you tell me these three doors is
[1:36:27] three entries which one is difficult a
[1:36:31] veil a dog and a gate a gate is
[1:36:37] difficult there's this flesh get you
[1:36:43] have bars and iron fresh the Lord if you
[1:36:52] strong maybe a little bit stronger than
[1:36:54] me you can step that door open any will
[1:36:59] we shove caused the door it was not
[1:37:02] actually a door like this it was just a
[1:37:04] doorway with cottage and then the veil
[1:37:08] was a flesh of badgers king that was
[1:37:14] what was behind that was what was
[1:37:19] surrounding the Ark of the Covenant it
[1:37:21] was a flesh of badgers king praise the
[1:37:26] Lord
[1:37:30] but yet in a way that God to Moses
[1:37:34] inserting of this Tabernacle he gave him
[1:37:38] an order that looks like the reverse why
[1:37:45] because as humans as we deal with one
[1:37:49] another we look at the aquapod but when
[1:37:53] God biess with a man he deals with him
[1:37:55] from the inward part because when the
[1:37:57] heart is not converted no matter how you
[1:38:00] try to conform your flesh
[1:38:06] so God start setting the tabernacle from
[1:38:10] the inside he start dealing with your
[1:38:12] heart he start making you conscious of
[1:38:14] his word it's not conforming to church
[1:38:19] is being conscious of God's Word
[1:38:22] that there is a living God so it's from
[1:38:31] inside out that he deals with the man so
[1:38:34] now we see the lover is death that is
[1:38:38] for the footwork so you see when he
[1:38:40] comes from watching watching being
[1:38:44] watched by the Prophet and an address he
[1:38:48] had to walk a distance to the tabernacle
[1:38:51] so when he gets to his feet is dead it
[1:38:54] now he has to watch it because Israel
[1:38:57] was was was taught how to keep the
[1:39:00] tabernacle cleaning I mean it was all
[1:39:02] about centrifugation it was all about
[1:39:04] holiness holy holy on to the law so he
[1:39:07] had to do a fourth watch now this this
[1:39:12] watch that Moses watched the priesthood
[1:39:14] it was not a dealer watch I mean it was
[1:39:20] not a dealer watch it was a one time
[1:39:23] watch when a man is called into the
[1:39:26] priests hole but of watching of the feet
[1:39:30] was a dealer watch every time they come
[1:39:34] to do sacrifice they have to wash their
[1:39:37] feet before they go into the tabernacle
[1:39:40] until Israel
[1:39:42] took it as a tradition at their homes
[1:39:46] you remember the foot wash flunky and
[1:39:49] man I was employed to be right there and
[1:39:52] wash and wash the people feet amen when
[1:39:57] that woman that came whipping at Jesus
[1:40:00] feet because he saw that she his feet
[1:40:03] was not watch and it was a sense of
[1:40:06] welcome when you are welcome back bye
[1:40:09] bye bye your hosts they wash your feet
[1:40:12] they take out your your garment because
[1:40:14] it's dusted they put a rub on you and
[1:40:17] then you go right into the hole so
[1:40:20] Israel took that as a tradition from the
[1:40:23] tabernacle order and it became a way of
[1:40:28] life for them are we together now so
[1:40:34] that was what Jesus was referring to
[1:40:36] when he told Simon that he that is watch
[1:40:39] kneeling there to be watching himself
[1:40:42] his feet why because it represents our
[1:40:46] daily walk before the Lord our daily
[1:40:51] walk before the Lord when we accept the
[1:40:56] Lord Jesus and confess him by faith and
[1:40:59] being baptized identify with his body in
[1:41:02] water baptism we don't need it again
[1:41:09] praise the Lord unless it was not done
[1:41:12] scripturally are we together but we we
[1:41:17] all need the constant feet watch or is
[1:41:23] not bringing a bucket to your house
[1:41:26] every day to watch your feet we are
[1:41:28] watch by the water of the word because
[1:41:34] the word brings is cleansing I went
[1:41:38] together praise the Lord's in John
[1:41:41] chapter 15 now remember now is in John
[1:41:45] chapter 13 Jesus speaking to the
[1:41:48] disciples he says he are all clean but
[1:41:52] not all because he knew one will be true
[1:41:56] him praise the Lord Amen and I was I
[1:42:01] would speak on that a little bit why we
[1:42:04] keep talking about the communion here
[1:42:07] you see we try to encourage our self to
[1:42:11] walk in the light of the scripture are
[1:42:15] we together amen
[1:42:17] praise the Lord and just like I
[1:42:20] testified to you the last time we have
[1:42:23] seen many that has been healed and
[1:42:26] people that has I mean that has gained
[1:42:28] victory in certain area of their walk
[1:42:31] with Christ just by taking their ball
[1:42:34] step and identifying themselves with the
[1:42:36] word and also I've seen people I tried
[1:42:40] to make fun of that getting in the worst
[1:42:43] condition of their Christian walk praise
[1:42:47] the Lord I knew you're a young lady that
[1:42:49] was struggling with drinking amen and
[1:42:55] really never got totally deliverer of
[1:42:58] the habit praise the Lord let me tell
[1:43:06] you something this word of God is
[1:43:09] blessed this word is anointed God has
[1:43:17] already said my word we never go back or
[1:43:21] never go out and return to me praise the
[1:43:26] Lord
[1:43:26] so there is an anointing that backs the
[1:43:30] word amen
[1:43:32] and if our hearts are not right if we
[1:43:36] are not sincere
[1:43:37] I have seen people struggling I mean I
[1:43:40] talked to people in my office and we're
[1:43:42] talking and I said look if you were just
[1:43:45] be sincere with God and take this thing
[1:43:48] and take this thing before the Lord and
[1:43:51] say Lord I come out identify myself with
[1:43:53] your word because I know you are the
[1:43:56] healer I know you are the deliverer
[1:44:01] I've seen them walking in victory why
[1:44:04] because God would back his word and I've
[1:44:11] seen people that just try to play Church
[1:44:14] and just try to play you know and just
[1:44:18] try to be a part you must understand
[1:44:22] what you're doing
[1:44:25] praise the Lord
[1:44:27] don't go to church because you just want
[1:44:30] to go to church you must understand what
[1:44:32] they believe you must understand what
[1:44:35] this came for you must understand what
[1:44:38] they are doing
[1:44:41] praise the Lord
[1:44:44] as you just find yourself in a place
[1:44:46] that is I mean it's just there you know
[1:44:48] what I mean they're just there for
[1:44:50] whatever it is are we together and if
[1:44:57] you think there's a place where we are
[1:44:59] stepping out of the scripture bring it
[1:45:00] let's talk about it we want to walk in
[1:45:03] the light of truth amen now so let's
[1:45:10] look at this now sin joint chapter 15
[1:45:22] verse 3 Jesus is year 15 3 now here a
[1:45:28] claim true the word wish and her spoken
[1:45:33] unto you praise the Lord
[1:45:37] amen so there he he speaks on to the
[1:45:43] disciples he told Peter if I don't watch
[1:45:47] you you don't have no part with me
[1:45:51] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] he says all not only my feet wash my
[1:45:58] entire body Jesus ain't know what I'm
[1:46:02] doing on to you is a type of the lavish
[1:46:04] washing you are just about to enter into
[1:46:07] your ministry and I realized this was
[1:46:09] just before Jesus will leave so the
[1:46:13] responsibility of the church is now on
[1:46:16] the shoulders of the Apostles they are
[1:46:21] not about to take over the ministry so
[1:46:24] Jesus is empowering them he's watching
[1:46:26] them for them to enter the tabernacle
[1:46:29] just our offering service that is the
[1:46:33] reason why he and John they can walk to
[1:46:35] the gate of beautiful and tell them a
[1:46:38] silver and gold we have no but what we
[1:46:40] have we give you in the name of Jesus
[1:46:42] rise up and walk because they were watch
[1:46:45] to go right into service praise the Lord
[1:46:54] I don't I don't you know I don't hum to
[1:47:01] people but I just believe that these are
[1:47:04] these are scriptural biblical principle
[1:47:07] sometimes we put everything into the
[1:47:10] work of the individual no man is saved
[1:47:13] by works amen what we need we need God's
[1:47:19] grace to help us to obey God's Word
[1:47:24] praise the Lord
[1:47:26] there is another principle that comes up
[1:47:28] instant first John chapter 1 first John
[1:47:32] is before the book of Revelation let's
[1:47:34] go there
[1:47:37] if you can't get on time just follow the
[1:47:40] reading that the brothers and sisters
[1:47:48] will put up for us first John first John
[1:47:52] chapter one
[1:48:04] so leave you a little bit here let's
[1:48:08] read from verse five this then is the
[1:48:10] message which we have heard of him and
[1:48:13] declare unto you that God is light and
[1:48:17] in him is no darkness at all if we say
[1:48:22] that we have fellowship with him and
[1:48:24] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:48:27] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[1:48:33] is in the light we have fellowship one
[1:48:38] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:48:41] Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin
[1:48:47] now Jesus had just told the disciples
[1:48:50] that the words that I have spoken unto
[1:48:53] you have cleanse you praise the Lord but
[1:48:58] here John is also saying for us to have
[1:49:02] assets to the blood to be cleansed by
[1:49:05] the blood you know the church were today
[1:49:08] we claim the blood we bathe ourself in
[1:49:11] the blood in and in and we rebuke the
[1:49:14] devil with the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:17] we say all of those things just just
[1:49:19] just ask a mentor talk but yes the
[1:49:25] structure of principle if we walk in the
[1:49:31] light and what is the light the Word of
[1:49:36] God is the life the Word of God revealed
[1:49:39] is the light of God David said your word
[1:49:43] is a light unto my path if we walk in
[1:49:49] the light as he is in the light as God
[1:49:55] is revealing it as God is revealing his
[1:50:00] word when we walk in the light of God's
[1:50:03] Word then the scripture says the blood
[1:50:08] cleanses us amen the blood cleanses us
[1:50:14] it's just like when Adam
[1:50:17] and Eve seen in the beginning God came
[1:50:22] down the Bible says he took a lamb
[1:50:25] slay the lamb and took their fake lives
[1:50:27] of them and rub them in their lamps King
[1:50:30] go when I allowed them to go from his
[1:50:33] presence until they had a blood that was
[1:50:36] speaking on their behalf
[1:50:39] so as Adam and Eve will be walking away
[1:50:42] from the presence of God that blood of
[1:50:45] the Lamb will be drop him speaking mercy
[1:50:48] speaking and that's what John is saying
[1:50:51] here when we walk in the line when we
[1:50:54] walk in obedience to God's Word then the
[1:50:59] blood cleans his paws amen praise the
[1:51:06] Lord so we see being watched by the
[1:51:10] water by the word by the blood he all
[1:51:15] comes to one thing I mean it all comes
[1:51:21] to one thing
[1:51:22] it all comes bring us back to the Word
[1:51:25] of God obeying the Word of God are we
[1:51:33] together I have a code out there I
[1:51:38] wanted to share with you
[1:51:51] praise the Lord
[1:51:54] oh yeah
[1:52:06] they becoming us to fulfill all
[1:52:08] righteousness see Aaron the high priest
[1:52:12] before he could ever be anointed he had
[1:52:17] to be watched with water
[1:52:20] therefore when Jesus before he could be
[1:52:24] anointed as our high priest he was
[1:52:28] watched with water and then anointed and
[1:52:33] then and they're not anointing or Paul
[1:52:37] upon him to anoint him like Aaron was
[1:52:42] anointing with oil he was anointed with
[1:52:45] the Holy Ghost for John bare wrecker
[1:52:49] seen the Spirit of God discerning like a
[1:52:53] dog and going upon him and a voice
[1:52:56] saying this is my beloved Son in whom
[1:52:59] I'm well pleased to do it so the Bible
[1:53:06] said that Jesus was anointed with the
[1:53:08] Holy Ghost went about doing good things
[1:53:13] praise the Lord
[1:53:15] amen he was born the word because the
[1:53:21] scripture says a virgin shall conceive
[1:53:23] that is the Word of God for the word
[1:53:28] needed to be anointed to go into service
[1:53:33] praise the Lord
[1:53:35] are we together and there sometimes that
[1:53:39] is the place where is hard for many of
[1:53:42] us to be able to reconcile what happened
[1:53:45] on the river Jordan and sometimes it's
[1:53:51] difficult it brings many of us to the
[1:53:53] place were we struggle in we don't know
[1:53:56] understand John said before I saw Allah
[1:53:58] a dog coming out of heaven upon him to
[1:54:02] anoint him praise the Lord it's hard for
[1:54:07] many to even believe that Jesus received
[1:54:09] the Holy Ghost but the scripture said it
[1:54:14] The Book of God said it praise the Lord
[1:54:22] and well yeah we struggle with all
[1:54:29] teachings the border was just a vessel
[1:54:34] the bother was a vessel that was
[1:54:37] produced by the word because the
[1:54:39] scripture says a virgin shall conceive
[1:54:41] that was the word amen and in the
[1:54:47] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:54:50] God and the Word was God so in some form
[1:54:54] that word was God amen
[1:54:57] but not in totality are we together not
[1:55:04] in totality because the word without the
[1:55:07] Spirit it will not be able to carry out
[1:55:10] his commission and we together so the
[1:55:20] word needed to be anointed when it came
[1:55:23] at a time where John ministry has ended
[1:55:26] and he must leave the same the Messiah
[1:55:28] needed to come on the scene and then he
[1:55:31] was anointed to go right into service
[1:55:34] healing the sick raising the dead praise
[1:55:38] the Lord there is a reason why there
[1:55:41] will be no record that will record Jesus
[1:55:44] opening the blind eyes raising the dead
[1:55:47] before Johnny there is no record there
[1:55:55] is no record of him healing the sick
[1:56:00] before Jordan his ministry started our
[1:56:06] Jordan in after Jordan when John said
[1:56:09] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:56:12] the sin of the world
[1:56:20] I went together praise the Lord
[1:56:25] you know Wednesday night we spoke on the
[1:56:29] blind man at the pool that Jesus spit on
[1:56:32] the ground and and and and and put some
[1:56:35] clay in his head and told him to go and
[1:56:37] watch the Bible says the name of the
[1:56:42] pool was sin and Jesus sent him to go
[1:56:47] and watch and like I said Wednesday
[1:56:49] night I thought about it the man is
[1:56:54] already blind you pour clay on his eyes
[1:56:58] and you said he should go and watch how
[1:57:01] is he going praise the Lord
[1:57:05] but that's when God want us to take a
[1:57:08] step of faith believing on his finished
[1:57:13] work that's when he want us to take step
[1:57:19] of faith now holding to a church
[1:57:22] crutches a hole into a religious King we
[1:57:28] must be able to take a step of faith and
[1:57:30] say God have said it he said go and
[1:57:34] watch and a man found his way whichever
[1:57:37] way he got down there he got to the pool
[1:57:40] and he watches eyes and the scripture
[1:57:42] says he started to see man appearing in
[1:57:45] his eyes like trees now how can you come
[1:57:50] to that man like the Pharisees and tell
[1:57:53] that man that Jesus had a devil he told
[1:57:56] him he's a being here all of this when I
[1:57:58] bought right in your hands I never seen
[1:58:03] a man that make a blind see if he said
[1:58:06] that well he's a good devil praise the
[1:58:12] Lord
[1:58:13] so you see that is the reason why we
[1:58:17] encourage to read our Bible and prayed
[1:58:19] every day because and in any affiliation
[1:58:23] with the word is a form of watching
[1:58:26] every time you interact with the word if
[1:58:30] you take the word as a meditation on
[1:58:33] your
[1:58:34] you are watching your mind from all the
[1:58:37] negative talks and all their unclaimed
[1:58:40] Thompson that goes around every fall
[1:58:42] every time you interact with the word
[1:58:45] it's a form of watching praise the Lord
[1:58:49] you see because the the major above has
[1:58:53] already been done
[1:58:55] amen by your confession of faith and
[1:58:58] accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:59:01] being identified with him in Baptism
[1:59:03] there are major above has already been
[1:59:05] done and now give you faith to enter out
[1:59:09] with the word praise the Lord because
[1:59:12] faith cometh by hearing the word and
[1:59:14] every time as you feed on the word what
[1:59:17] are you listening to it on the radio or
[1:59:20] you read your Bible I mean it's a form
[1:59:22] of watching it cleans our minds to
[1:59:26] change our desire they give us what we
[1:59:30] want a closer walk with God praise the
[1:59:34] Lord amen watch by the water of the
[1:59:41] world musicians you can come forth
[1:59:44] praise the Lord
[1:59:58] a man running away from the presence of
[2:00:00] the Lord we love you more than our
[2:00:05] family we love you more than I will our
[2:00:09] wife we love the Lord Jesus now more
[2:00:13] than our children our father mother
[2:00:15] sister brother husband why we love you
[2:00:18] Lord Jesus make that so real in our
[2:00:23] hearts Lord pour in the oil of gladness
[2:00:27] this week Lord in our soul give us a
[2:00:33] bath in a watching of the water by the
[2:00:38] word of God
[2:00:40] dividing unto us the truth praise the
[2:00:46] Lord
[2:00:47] that's what we want we want to love him
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:00:56] amen
[2:01:02] that's what we do that's what we do
[2:01:04] that's all we encourage our self to do
[2:01:07] to walk in truth
[2:01:10] walk in truth is not a
[2:01:13] self-righteousness it's not a you know
[2:01:16] one practicing religion it's falling in
[2:01:22] love with God loving God with all of our
[2:01:28] heart all of our mind all of our
[2:01:30] strength and as you walk earnestly in a
[2:01:35] little of truth that you know you walk
[2:01:38] in that light
[2:01:40] his blood keep placing you and you grow
[2:01:44] from grace to grace praise the Lord
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:54] we can take an emotional message and and
[2:02:00] and get you all right up and and and and
[2:02:03] shouting you know and streaming to the
[2:02:06] top of your voice
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:09] praise the Lord
[2:02:11] but you know you can that you can only
[2:02:16] jump as high as you can lace praise the
[2:02:22] Lord
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:28] if the Lord give us grace who a time
[2:02:32] goes by we would look into a lot of the
[2:02:35] tabernacle things we shall all types of
[2:02:38] our day but I would tell you last night
[2:02:42] as I was sitting at my table studying
[2:02:45] when I read that I exited chapter 40 it
[2:02:51] reminded me of something and it came so
[2:02:57] beautiful I never saw like I've ever
[2:03:01] seen it
[2:03:02] I know I've said it a lot of places
[2:03:05] before but to just see it that God was
[2:03:09] Charlie Moses because if you go back to
[2:03:14] Exeter in the same Exeter from the
[2:03:18] building of the tabernacle is the auto
[2:03:20] car that was set first
[2:03:23] and then the holy place next and then
[2:03:27] the holiest of holy but then God was
[2:03:29] telling Moses this is my right order
[2:03:32] this is my order the tabernacle is set
[2:03:36] from e2 out because that's how he D with
[2:03:42] us
[2:03:43] praise the Lord like I said Wednesday
[2:03:46] night if God can touch your heart
[2:03:48] if God can can can deal with your heart
[2:03:51] if God cannot deal with your heart there
[2:03:54] is no way you can get away from a habit
[2:03:59] there is no way you can get away from
[2:04:02] from anything you struggling in this
[2:04:04] flesh you can go on you can go on on a
[2:04:12] resolution you can go on the practice
[2:04:15] you can go on the twelfth day plan 24th
[2:04:17] day play but let God knocks at your
[2:04:20] heart and you open the heart door to him
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:27] you see how the changing power of God
[2:04:32] praise the Lord
[2:04:34] now same power when he said let there be
[2:04:37] light
[2:04:37] and light was able to separate darkness
[2:04:41] and product less into a place
[2:04:45] that same power will come through your
[2:04:47] life praise the Lord I'm telling you God
[2:04:51] will deliver you and you will even ask
[2:04:54] yourself you will not find a way to go
[2:04:57] back to your habit because when God
[2:05:00] deliver he does not leave a trace
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:10] let's sing this hymn together whoa are
[2:05:16] you

[2:09:47] it's going to strengthen you in your
[2:09:49] walk with God praise the Lord
[2:09:53] it's strange that many times we come to
[2:09:55] the communion sometimes people would
[2:09:58] love to stay away because the thing that
[2:10:01] you know maybe they don't want to be
[2:10:03] part of it that night for one reason or
