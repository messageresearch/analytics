[22:50] for once you have to be happy because
[22:52] you're a living being
[22:54] that alone is a big testimony
[22:57] all right let's go and sit we have um
[23:00] testimony here
[23:02] from
[23:06] from brother john bibi john bb you're
[23:20] welcome
[23:43] um
[23:49] for steven can you please check with me
[23:52] he's coming
[24:05] [Music]
[24:11] praise the lord
[24:22] [Music]
[24:25] not so much of the testimony but the
[24:27] circumstances
[24:29] that led to it coming from my wife
[24:35] and actually i wouldn't say it all
[24:40] if she were here probably she could
[24:44] take the other side of it but i just
[24:47] want to say
[24:49] what lord did for us all
[24:54] it was um before last thursday
[25:01] we got up in the morning after our
[25:04] morning devotion
[25:07] and then after we got through praying
[25:12] i felt that i needed to pray
[25:15] more to me i have not prayed sufficient
[25:20] but you know the
[25:24] ancient to pray it was something unusual
[25:27] to me in the sense that
[25:29] instead of longing to pray i was feeling
[25:32] the
[25:33] prayer longing i said hunger in my
[25:35] stomach
[25:38] so i say wow
[25:42] this is very unusual lord what is going
[25:45] on
[25:46] then i still feel that hunger
[25:50] to pray i say okay
[25:54] but then i have the little girl with
[25:57] with me and once again it's around
[26:00] there's nothing you can do in our
[26:02] partner i don't have anywhere to hide
[26:04] so to have from her i only have a leg
[26:08] uh a closet is dollars
[26:11] so when she's looking alright you can't
[26:13] find me she'll go
[26:14] right there yeah
[26:18] so i think it was around 11 o'clock at
[26:22] that time so by 12 o'clock
[26:26] i found i was still i was still feeling
[26:28] too heavy
[26:29] so i went in the closet to see
[26:33] pick up my bible i can read but you know
[26:36] she likes to play with our phones
[26:38] so she has played with her grammar phone
[26:41] until
[26:42] she has missed where she is so she
[26:44] started looking for me she came
[26:46] and then she brought the phone i said
[26:48] okay
[26:49] maybe go to grandma i'll set the phone
[26:52] and bring it back
[26:53] and she didn't say well she turned
[26:55] around and went to her grandma
[26:57] so after resetting the phone i went
[27:00] out to go and give look for her to give
[27:03] the phone to her
[27:04] when i got out there i saw her
[27:08] and the grandma sleeping
[27:11] i said wow but this is very unusual
[27:14] so then since i have a free chance i
[27:17] will pray then
[27:19] so i grabbed a chair my chair
[27:23] and then i faced the wall
[27:27] now when i got down to pray
[27:31] then i felt real
[27:34] hunger in my stomach i said ah
[27:38] lord what is this so i got up
[27:42] if i say i am going to eat
[27:46] before praying i might sleep over
[27:49] because who can put you to sleep
[27:51] now if i don't eat and i say i'm praying
[27:55] to you the hunger will be threatening
[27:56] you and you can't pray the way you want
[27:58] to
[27:59] so i got up i said okay i will just eat
[28:03] something little then
[28:06] you know i can pray alone
[28:10] but while i was struggling with this uh
[28:13] hungers i said what is this
[28:16] then i remember this scripture
[28:20] that they that test and they that are
[28:23] did a hunger and test
[28:25] for righteousness they shall be
[28:28] filled i say amen
[28:31] so that means not only longing but you
[28:35] can also get physically
[28:37] or spiritually hungry in your stomach to
[28:39] pray so okay
[28:41] so after i took the food i carry
[28:44] to the microwave now when i got to the
[28:48] microwave
[28:49] i said no satan get away from me
[28:53] you don't provide for me now that i want
[28:56] to pray to god
[28:57] you have come in with this hunger in the
[29:00] name of jesus christ i reject you
[29:02] so i put the food one side
[29:06] and then turn around to go and pray
[29:10] when i sat down to i knelt down to break
[29:14] i get lost i don't know how long i
[29:17] prayed
[29:19] but when i got up from praying
[29:22] then i found that i am really really
[29:25] heavily
[29:26] hungry so okay
[29:30] i took the food and then put it in a
[29:33] microwave
[29:34] and warm it the first bite
[29:38] that i took i had
[29:41] [Music]
[29:43] in my mouth i said ah but what could
[29:46] this be
[29:47] we don't cook bones because of the leg
[29:50] there
[29:51] and so this can it be bones what could
[29:54] it be
[29:56] so i use the food is already in my mouth
[29:59] and i use my tongue to search all around
[30:02] whether i can see
[30:04] sharpness you know chickens
[30:07] i didn't find anything i said well
[30:10] satan the bible says i will
[30:14] drink poison it shall do me no harm
[30:17] so this food you can't stop me from
[30:19] eating it
[30:20] i'm going to eat it so
[30:23] i swallowed it not knowing what i
[30:26] swallowed
[30:27] okay then i scooped another
[30:31] spoonful put it one side put soup on it
[30:35] and then i start searching inside to see
[30:39] if i can find anything no
[30:42] i didn't find anything i said okay
[30:44] praise the lord
[30:46] i will eat so i
[30:49] add it again now in the test spoon
[30:53] i scooped the rice and then
[30:57] going to get this the soup
[31:00] i saw this sharp
[31:04] a flash like a glass
[31:08] so when i look at it i said ah
[31:11] i then i took it gently out of the soup
[31:15] whatever i force it in my break
[31:18] i think oh yeah see that
[31:22] is easy it was a piece
[31:25] of broken uh
[31:30] no um bull we had this bull for about
[31:34] four years
[31:35] thick so so i have no idea that you're
[31:39] going to chip around
[31:41] and i don't know how it happened
[31:44] so i said i put it one size in half
[31:49] okay then i continued two years after i
[31:53] already prayed so
[31:54] when i take the food i will look inside
[31:57] look inside i don't see
[31:59] any then i will eat so
[32:02] bit by bit i ate all the food
[32:06] now when i got through eating
[32:10] the food i say well satan
[32:14] well god is on my side so
[32:18] if i have followed your hunger
[32:22] and i have gone ahead to eat the food
[32:24] this is what
[32:25] i was going to get but thank god
[32:28] he's on my side he has taken this away
[32:31] from me
[32:37] so basically that is
[32:40] what happened my wife was still sleeping
[32:44] see so when she
[32:47] got up
[32:50] no when i took the the the test
[32:53] hoop then i started looking around
[32:57] the bowl started looking around then i
[33:00] found out that
[33:01] there's a portion of it it has something
[33:04] like chickens
[33:05] rough i say oh so what i
[33:09] beat through it could be one of these
[33:11] chippings or
[33:12] you know small small chips that i may
[33:15] have mixed with the food
[33:16] okay so when she woke up i was telling
[33:19] her
[33:20] oh she couldn't she started
[33:25] training say oh honey
[33:29] you were not home and
[33:33] are coming to do something to find
[33:36] something to eat
[33:38] and i don't know when you are coming so
[33:40] i try to use a hammer
[33:43] to break you know he doesn't have hands
[33:45] enough
[33:46] to break chicken soup so
[33:49] he was trying to use the hammer to
[33:52] hammer it
[33:53] to i mean marshall
[33:56] and being that she doesn't have the hand
[33:59] so the hammer kind of
[34:01] slip from her hand and then hit
[34:05] the ball so he hit the wall
[34:08] she never realized what had happened
[34:12] see until when he saw
[34:15] the chip the lines on the
[34:19] bowl so she was trimming
[34:22] oh i said did you eat a food did you
[34:25] have the food
[34:26] i said ah why the bible says
[34:30] we shall drink what we shall do has no
[34:31] harm why worried
[34:34] so i act she was not satisfied
[34:38] i said well let's go so
[34:42] i just we just left it there then
[34:46] after i came to church
[34:49] that sunday i waited i brought the chip
[34:52] itself
[34:54] to show to brother jordan if he can be
[34:56] projected he said yeah it can be
[34:58] so i'll talk to pastor if he allows it
[35:01] then you can
[35:02] project it so that you see what i'm
[35:05] talking about
[35:06] i'm sorry i didn't bring the original
[35:08] but just how it is
[35:10] so i talked to pastor explaining to him
[35:15] so oh no you can go ahead so
[35:18] i waited then we come
[35:22] sunday brother ali came to give
[35:26] his testimony see previously he has
[35:30] already preached
[35:31] that uh us hours with moses
[35:35] and then from his accident you are using
[35:37] that
[35:38] how god has been with his children
[35:42] so when you when i heard the testimony
[35:44] oh
[35:45] nobody's testimony it is for me too
[35:49] so i say oh praise the lord
[35:52] so you see when we gather together
[35:56] when something is going to happen you
[35:57] don't know where god will come
[35:59] to bring a warning to us but for
[36:02] one sermon to bring two testimonies
[36:06] it confirms that god is amongst his
[36:09] children
[36:11] so this is what the lord has done for us
[36:15] so either as ours with moses is not
[36:18] only for anybody for us all
[36:21] praise the lord
[36:28] jesus yes it's a dimension of his name
[36:33] jesus
[36:34] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[36:36] confess
[36:37] i mean i just want to be grateful to god
[36:40] for brother john bibi
[36:41] i pray that god will continue to
[36:43] strengthen us all
[36:44] in jesus name that is the power of
[36:47] prayer
[36:49] yes um we have special here but i think
[36:52] i have to skip that because
[36:54] of the time we've gone deep into the
[36:56] pastor's time
[36:58] rather than have something to make right
[37:00] i don't know if you can do that quick
[37:01] brother then
[37:02] are you there
[37:20] yeah so um
[37:23] this morning i rather brought something
[37:25] to my notice
[37:28] and um i said i wait till next week
[37:32] but then i realized i didn't know we had
[37:34] so many
[37:36] specials here this morning else i would
[37:39] have made it next week
[37:41] so i said to myself if i can make you
[37:43] today why not
[37:45] so he said
[37:48] in the previous semester i used a
[37:50] terminology
[37:52] or a term um
[37:55] i don't give a damn yeah
[38:00] so he called my attention to it this
[38:02] morning and asked whether i knew the
[38:05] background of that time i said no
[38:10] he said it has something to do with
[38:11] swearing
[38:13] it has a swearing background or
[38:15] something to that effect
[38:17] and i saw i'm hearing it for the first
[38:19] time
[38:21] i said i appreciate it very very much
[38:25] he said i used it twice by searching
[38:28] through my heart i think probably i have
[38:30] used it over 10 times
[38:32] i don't know where under what
[38:34] circumstances
[38:36] and i have always used it in that
[38:38] context i don't care
[38:41] but it doesn't matter under what context
[38:44] it was
[38:45] what is wrong is wrong yeah there is no
[38:48] place for foolishness behind the pulpit
[38:50] here
[38:51] so i thought i should make it right
[38:53] before the church
[38:55] and let you know about it brother jordan
[38:57] i appreciate that too much god bless you
[39:00] yeah so this is what we should be doing
[39:01] for one another so i
[39:03] had a different thought about it but
[39:06] it just happens that it has a background
[39:09] i i
[39:10] i don't know so thank you so much god
[39:13] bless you
[39:14] and i'm sorry for that church that was
[39:17] very unintentional god bless you
[39:28] amen indeed we are serving in god

[39:34] correction

[48:02] we want to thank god for giving us this
[48:05] opportunity
[48:07] once again uh
[48:08] [Music]
[48:13] looks like we live in
[48:17] and it's almost like the saying that
[48:20] says the
[48:21] you know the darkest part of the night
[48:22] comes just before
[48:24] the break of the daylight and uh
[48:27] so it looks like we are constantly
[48:32] having one one sorrow
[48:35] or another or one one that is that is
[48:38] coming missing among us
[48:40] uh just on
[48:44] on friday was
[48:48] the funeral service of uh uh
[48:52] or the viewing of the brother that
[48:54] passed away
[48:55] over there in uh in dc
[48:58] and just after that
[49:02] another dear brother pants right after
[49:05] that service
[49:07] from the same church so
[49:10] uh then he's a his father to a dear
[49:13] friend of mine
[49:14] and a good good friend to brother
[49:16] brother miron
[49:18] and so that that is something that is uh
[49:21] uh going through there on the time of
[49:25] sinus so we want to keep them in prayer
[49:28] i saw him when i was there the last time
[49:30] for bernie's
[49:31] funeral and uh i
[49:35] knew him from back in nigeria
[49:38] italy brother so i just spoke with the
[49:41] son yesterday
[49:43] and
[49:47] they all sent you greetings but jarrod
[49:49] wanted me to greet the church as well
[49:52] praise the lord so but uh
[49:59] as the days goes by that the time comes
[50:01] one by one
[50:03] we will all cross this mortal ring until
[50:07] our lord take us in the body change amen
[50:12] whether we go by the way of death or
[50:15] whether we go
[50:16] by the way of the body change
[50:20] is it it makes no difference for the
[50:23] believer
[50:24] it makes no difference for the believer
[50:26] because if they've struck our body
[50:29] just in a twinkling of an eye you step
[50:32] into your new body
[50:34] praise the lord there is no dull moment
[50:37] for the believer while we weep inside
[50:40] you
[50:41] you will step into a new body where you
[50:44] will feel
[50:45] no pain in those sideness just the same
[50:48] as when we go by the weight of the
[50:50] rapture
[50:51] in the twinkling of an eye we will be
[50:53] changed that's what the scripture says
[50:56] but we are in that cycle you know
[50:59] we are in that cycle we are in that
[51:01] period
[51:04] that the scripture says in the moment
[51:06] it's a process
[51:08] you know a moment is a process a moment
[51:11] is uh
[51:12] it's a period of time and
[51:15] what is happening to the believer here
[51:17] is that
[51:18] the more we yield to this word the more
[51:21] we come in fellowship to this world
[51:24] the more we are experiencing our body
[51:27] change but from the inside
[51:29] god is working on our nature because
[51:31] that's the only thing that we take from
[51:33] this world
[51:34] you know is is
[51:37] the change of nature we are not going to
[51:40] go
[51:41] with
[51:44] our nature from our first birth we
[51:47] taking on a new nature from the word
[51:50] praise the lord
[51:51] and that's the reason why we are called
[51:54] to conform to the word
[51:56] you know to the image of the world we
[51:57] talk a little bit about that
[51:59] but uh let's let's just continue to
[52:03] remember
[52:04] many many of god's children that
[52:07] are moaning in sinus
[52:10] there's another dear brother pass over
[52:13] there in new jersey
[52:19] [Music]
[52:20] one of the sisters back home my editor's
[52:23] sister's
[52:24] sister despair she told me about him
[52:27] you know because he uh
[52:30] kind of appreciate the word to her
[52:32] [Music]
[52:34] and then i was looking forward to make
[52:36] contact but i didn't have contact with
[52:38] him until
[52:39] i got a call from back from yesterday
[52:41] and she reminded me her daughter
[52:42] reminded me
[52:44] you know that that was the brother so
[52:47] they had to see him on this side and
[52:48] look to see him in glory praise the lord
[52:51] amen we hold we hold that hope here in
[52:54] our hearts amen
[52:55] praise the lord that we have a promise
[52:58] so uh
[53:00] let's just rejoice in there believing
[53:03] that
[53:03] uh you know our day of comfort
[53:07] and blindness will all sorrow and
[53:09] everything will be taken away
[53:11] let's just buy our house together and
[53:13] just and just prayed as we
[53:15] as you remember those morning families

[53:22] confidence trained around this time
[53:25] heavenly father we bought our house lord
[53:27] oh god we
[53:29] you taught us in your word to identify
[53:32] with
[53:32] glory and also lord to identify with
[53:36] uh with those that are mourning solomon
[53:38] said it's better to go in the house of
[53:40] those that are mourning
[53:42] than those that are fisting because when
[53:44] we go we take account
[53:46] that one day we will come to that place
[53:48] and father
[53:50] it is what we do now that counts lord
[53:53] father god and what will be said of us
[53:56] when we are gone

[54:01] bed but lord we just want to

[55:37] thank you musicians that's all we will
[55:39] do for the music
[55:41] and uh let's take our bibles
[55:46] we want to read from saint john chapter
[55:48] one
[55:51] we want to read from sin john chapter
[55:53] one
[56:00] and revelation chapter 3.
[56:05] last week we were talking
[56:09] about
[56:15] we were speaking of uh
[56:20] the day of redemption the blending of
[56:24] time and eternity
[56:26] but we had a parenthesis and we spoke a
[56:29] little bit
[56:30] about dealing with shame
[56:33] and i felt convicted
[56:37] over that thought when i went home i
[56:39] kept thinking about it
[56:41] and uh and the law
[56:45] started dealing with me so i want to go
[56:46] back to death in john chapter one
[56:48] let's read uh a famous uh
[56:52] uh part of that
[56:56] book that we all love
[57:03] verse one in the beginning was the word
[57:06] and the word was with god and the word
[57:09] was god
[57:10] i want to read that again in the
[57:12] beginning was the word the word was with
[57:14] god
[57:15] and the word was god the same was in the
[57:18] beginning
[57:19] with god all things
[57:23] were made by him and without him
[57:27] was not anything made that was made
[57:31] all things was made by wu the word
[57:36] amen because in the beginning was the
[57:38] word
[57:39] the word was with god and the word was
[57:42] god
[57:43] so we know that that was the form that
[57:46] god took to make
[57:47] all things the word all things were made
[57:51] by him
[57:51] and without him was anything made
[57:55] praise the lord let's drop down a little
[57:57] bit
[57:58] [Music]
[58:04] let's drop down verse 12. but as many of
[58:07] us receive him to them give him power to
[58:10] become sons
[58:12] and daughters of god sisters do you feel
[58:15] comfortable when i say that
[58:21] praise the lord
[58:24] but as many as receiving giving power
[58:28] gives you power to become sons of god
[58:31] even
[58:32] to them that believe on his name
[58:34] listening to this
[58:35] which were born net of
[58:39] blood net of the weight of the flesh
[58:43] none of the weight of man but of god
[58:47] so there is a birth of god that is
[58:49] spoken yet about
[58:51] so what john is addressing here does not
[58:54] have
[58:54] anything to do with our natural birth
[58:58] amen the lord bless you you can have
[59:00] your seed we will continue to read
[59:02] it does not have anything to do with
[59:04] your natural birth
[59:06] so don't allow anything of your natural
[59:09] breath
[59:09] your weakness your failure to haunt you
[59:12] this morning
[59:13] because we are going to travel into our
[59:15] identity
[59:17] amen which were born
[59:20] not of blood not of the flesh none
[59:24] of the will of god but i mean not of the
[59:27] word of man but of god
[59:29] then verse 14 and the word was made
[59:32] flesh
[59:33] endured among us and we beheld his glory
[59:39] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[59:43] father
[59:44] full of grace and truth revelation
[59:47] chapter 3
[59:51] revelation chapter 3.
[1:00:13] revelation chapter 3.
[1:00:27] revelation chapter 3 let's read from
[1:00:29] verse 14.
[1:00:32] and unto the angels of the church of
[1:00:34] laodicea write
[1:00:36] these things said the amen
[1:00:40] the faithful and truth witness
[1:00:43] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:00:47] now take that phrase the beginning of
[1:00:50] the creation of god
[1:00:52] back to saint john chapter one you will
[1:00:55] see that
[1:00:56] the very one that john was talking about
[1:00:59] in the beginning was the word
[1:01:01] the word was with god he created all
[1:01:04] things
[1:01:04] he is the one identifying himself here
[1:01:08] in the age of low edition
[1:01:11] so it's the same identity
[1:01:16] are we together the same one that was
[1:01:20] made flesh and dwelt among us is the
[1:01:22] same one here as
[1:01:24] the beginning of the creation
[1:01:27] of god what was the beginning of the
[1:01:31] creation of god the word
[1:01:35] the word was the first form that god
[1:01:40] created if we would say that way
[1:01:43] condemns himself to
[1:01:46] so so this is our age
[1:01:50] the dish church age the thing that came
[1:01:54] to
[1:01:54] us in our age is the word
[1:01:59] that's the reason why the seals were
[1:02:02] open
[1:02:03] in this age the mystery of god was
[1:02:05] revealed
[1:02:06] in this age because the identity of this
[1:02:09] the identity of christ in this age
[1:02:13] is the same one from the beginning
[1:02:17] are we together that is the reason why i
[1:02:20] will make this emphasis because that's
[1:02:22] what i will be emphasizing on
[1:02:24] that is the reason why if you miss the
[1:02:27] word
[1:02:29] you miss everything
[1:02:35] because that is the identification of
[1:02:38] christ
[1:02:39] brother branham says jesus christ is
[1:02:42] identified
[1:02:45] in all ages
[1:02:48] and the identification of christ in all
[1:02:50] ages
[1:02:51] is his characteristics
[1:02:54] praise the lord his form may change
[1:03:00] because he may use a jeremiah
[1:03:03] uh an ezekiel uh
[1:03:06] uh uh uh
[1:03:12] isaiah and all of these different
[1:03:15] prophets
[1:03:16] of the old testament he may use the paul
[1:03:19] that john wesley
[1:03:22] and uh at william branham
[1:03:25] he formed a change but his
[1:03:28] characteristics
[1:03:30] remain the same and we know god
[1:03:33] characteristics by his word
[1:03:35] because that is his identification card
[1:03:40] are we together so the things that have
[1:03:43] come to
[1:03:44] us in every age
[1:03:47] god identified himself this is god now
[1:03:49] speaking to laodicea age
[1:03:51] and said this is my identification
[1:03:53] laudisha see my id card
[1:03:56] my id card is that i am the amen
[1:04:01] which is i'm the confirmation
[1:04:05] i'm the one that closes everything
[1:04:09] i am the truth and uh it's almost like
[1:04:13] when the police say give me your license
[1:04:15] let me see your license the lookout you
[1:04:19] look at your face look down again that
[1:04:21] license look at the name
[1:04:23] look at the date of birth and everything
[1:04:25] there's god's identification he
[1:04:27] identified himself to the laodicean
[1:04:30] church age and say
[1:04:31] i am the amen and the truth the faithful
[1:04:34] witness
[1:04:35] i am the beginning of the creation of
[1:04:39] god
[1:04:40] it's almost like when jesus said go and
[1:04:42] baptize in the name of the father son
[1:04:44] and the holy ghost
[1:04:47] praise the lord if you want to rightly
[1:04:49] carry out that
[1:04:51] commission you have to find out what is
[1:04:53] the father son and the holy ghost
[1:04:56] if you rightly want to identify god in
[1:05:00] your age
[1:05:00] you have to find out what is the aiming
[1:05:04] what is the truth and faith for witness
[1:05:08] what is the beginning of the creation of
[1:05:10] god
[1:05:11] the beginning of the creation of god is
[1:05:13] what john says in the beginning
[1:05:15] was the word the word was with god
[1:05:20] the word was god all things
[1:05:23] were created by him
[1:05:28] are we together
[1:05:32] now so let's let's let's read that the
[1:05:35] introduction to our age
[1:05:36] again unto the injured of the church of
[1:05:38] laodicea write this thing said
[1:05:40] amen the faithful and truth witness the
[1:05:42] beginning of the creation of god
[1:05:45] i know that works that thou
[1:05:48] i need a call on heart i would that
[1:05:50] there were cold or hard take a position
[1:05:52] that would be better
[1:05:54] so then because they were that i look
[1:05:56] warm and needle cold not hard i will
[1:05:58] spill thee
[1:05:59] out of my mouth because they are said i
[1:06:02] am rich and increase in ghouls
[1:06:04] and i have need of nothing but knowing
[1:06:07] that
[1:06:08] that thou are wretched miserable poor
[1:06:10] and blind and naked
[1:06:12] i counsel thee to buy of me
[1:06:15] go try in the fire that thou may be
[1:06:18] rich in white dreaming that thou may
[1:06:22] be closed and that the
[1:06:25] shame of that nakedness i'm going to
[1:06:27] speak on the age of shame
[1:06:30] this age is the age of shame
[1:06:35] praise the lord
[1:06:39] and white raymond that thou mayer be
[1:06:41] closed
[1:06:42] and that the shame of the nakedness do
[1:06:44] not appear
[1:06:46] and anointed eyes with eyes said and
[1:06:49] that they
[1:06:50] may see for as many as i love
[1:06:53] are trusting i rebuke and trust and be
[1:06:56] zealious
[1:06:57] therefore and repent amen
[1:07:01] so this morning we want to talk on the
[1:07:03] age of shame
[1:07:05] praise the lord the age of shame
[1:07:09] and this age
[1:07:14] is the greatest age of shame praise the
[1:07:17] lord
[1:07:20] we know it is the last age
[1:07:25] bible historians will tell you that too
[1:07:29] so
[1:07:33] and then
[1:07:37] yet in this age of shame
[1:07:40] is also the age where god
[1:07:44] brought one of the the his
[1:07:47] the greatest manifestation the greatest
[1:07:50] move of god
[1:07:51] came in this age praise alone
[1:07:55] because the the the laodicea church age
[1:08:00] to the church to the word is allowed
[1:08:02] this church
[1:08:03] age to the church is actually the
[1:08:06] pentecostal age
[1:08:08] is the age of the restoration of the
[1:08:11] gift
[1:08:12] praise the lord amen is the age of the
[1:08:16] restoration of the gift
[1:08:19] if you if you ever read about
[1:08:23] the the outpouring of
[1:08:26] uh of what happened
[1:08:30] uh during the time of azusa
[1:08:33] i mean it was it was something that
[1:08:36] uh those that had the privilege to
[1:08:38] witness it
[1:08:40] the describe it extraordinary
[1:08:43] extraordinary just like people would
[1:08:46] talk about being in the meetings
[1:08:48] of brother branham that's just how those
[1:08:51] people
[1:08:52] there during the meeting of uh the the
[1:08:54] azusa street
[1:08:56] i mean they will see the cloud of glory
[1:08:59] coming in in the service
[1:09:04] there was they will see the cloud of
[1:09:06] glory the that song
[1:09:08] the comforter is here the comforter is
[1:09:11] here
[1:09:12] i learned that was brother simon's song
[1:09:14] that he used to like
[1:09:16] you know they just sit right there they
[1:09:18] keep singing the comforter has
[1:09:20] come their comforter has come and they
[1:09:23] would just keep worshiping
[1:09:25] they keep worshiping the atmosphere
[1:09:27] discharged
[1:09:28] there were there were tongues and
[1:09:30] interpretation of
[1:09:32] tongues on the spot prophecies and
[1:09:35] and i mean the gifts were just flowing
[1:09:37] among the people
[1:09:39] it was not man it was the move of god
[1:09:43] praise the lord it was the move of god
[1:09:46] and that was the same thing that took
[1:09:47] place on a brother brandon ministry
[1:09:50] you know it was god moving from one
[1:09:52] level brother branham taught us that in
[1:09:54] the message
[1:09:55] the countdown he says luther age was
[1:09:58] using the hearse you know the hearse and
[1:10:01] uh
[1:10:02] and and the boogie you know they were
[1:10:04] using the hearse he said john wesley age
[1:10:07] horsepower increased
[1:10:10] you know and and and they made the the
[1:10:13] the vehicle
[1:10:15] what signs they the only benefit they
[1:10:17] saw how
[1:10:18] hearses were moving and if you put two
[1:10:20] hearses together
[1:10:21] it can be able to pull more than what
[1:10:23] one would pull
[1:10:25] and and if you double them they will
[1:10:27] have more power
[1:10:29] so science benefit on there to be able
[1:10:31] to give us a vehicle praise the lord
[1:10:34] and and that just more horsepower and
[1:10:36] then in the pentecostal age
[1:10:38] that was extra horsepower that takes
[1:10:41] men from on the ground and suspend him
[1:10:43] in the air that was the aeroplane age a
[1:10:45] man
[1:10:46] going into the heavens so the church
[1:10:49] that's how the church was moving it's
[1:10:51] not that the church was copying after
[1:10:53] science
[1:10:53] science was benefiting from the women
[1:10:56] what what
[1:10:57] what the church has already achieved or
[1:10:59] what god has
[1:11:00] already achieved in the life of the
[1:11:02] church it was re
[1:11:04] it was reflected in science
[1:11:08] because before anything happened on
[1:11:09] earth is already
[1:11:11] reflected in heaven
[1:11:15] praise the lord so even as you see in
[1:11:18] the natural life you see
[1:11:20] signs is advancing we have in
[1:11:23] we have in we have in syria we're having
[1:11:26] you know uh uh uh uh gps we having
[1:11:30] all of these things it is just a
[1:11:32] physical manifestation
[1:11:34] of how far the church is
[1:11:38] praise the lord you and my son may not
[1:11:41] be there
[1:11:42] but that's how far god church is
[1:11:48] are we together so when we see
[1:11:52] all of these physical manifestation it
[1:11:54] must just challenge
[1:11:56] us because it's just physically
[1:11:58] reflecting
[1:12:01] what is happening in the heavens
[1:12:07] are we together praise the lord
[1:12:11] there is more that is expected of us
[1:12:13] people
[1:12:15] than church members
[1:12:19] this is our age this is the age
[1:12:23] that expects to see the manifestation of
[1:12:26] the sons and the daughters of god
[1:12:29] there is more that is suspected of us
[1:12:31] than just saying i believe the message
[1:12:34] i'm baptized in jesus name this age
[1:12:37] is looking to see you calling
[1:12:40] the old testament scenes from the grave
[1:12:43] brother branham says we are the final
[1:12:45] voice to the final age
[1:12:47] and the final voice is the voice of the
[1:12:49] resurrection
[1:12:50] so this church is going to provoke the
[1:12:53] resurrection for a rapture
[1:12:57] that's what it's a specter of us we have
[1:13:01] to live
[1:13:02] a life that will provoke
[1:13:06] a resurrection amen a life that will
[1:13:10] provoke
[1:13:11] the healing of our body a life that will
[1:13:14] provoke
[1:13:15] strength to our body
[1:13:20] that's the day and age that we are
[1:13:22] living in
[1:13:23] that's the thing that is expected of us
[1:13:27] praise the lord
[1:13:31] we must challenge ourselves
[1:13:34] we must be like they are all saints and
[1:13:36] says i know i'm not what i'm
[1:13:38] i'm supposed to be
[1:13:41] amen i also know i'm not what i used to
[1:13:45] be
[1:13:48] praise the lord i'm having an
[1:13:50] expectation
[1:13:51] to get to where god wanted to be
[1:14:00] are we together so this is an age of
[1:14:03] shame
[1:14:05] this is an age of shame this is the age
[1:14:08] where uh uh
[1:14:11] i mean man has
[1:14:15] detolerated in their conduct
[1:14:20] praise the lord a decency has gone
[1:14:26] you know what i'm talking about i'm not
[1:14:28] going to go into all of that just
[1:14:30] i just want to uh uh play out some
[1:14:33] things here
[1:14:35] but you will realize that what what i
[1:14:38] want to what
[1:14:38] i want us to see here is that
[1:14:42] just like this age it's an
[1:14:45] age of shame this age is experiencing
[1:14:50] such a shame that no age have
[1:14:53] experienced
[1:14:54] it is just like when she was
[1:14:57] first experienced i think we all know
[1:15:00] where
[1:15:01] and when shame was first experienced
[1:15:03] that's the garden of eden
[1:15:05] because the scripture says that they had
[1:15:08] a holy veil on their face brother
[1:15:09] branham taught his dad
[1:15:11] and and they didn't they never knew that
[1:15:12] they went naked
[1:15:14] so they did not know shame amen
[1:15:18] it's just like a little baby that child
[1:15:21] don't know shame
[1:15:23] that try to stay in a state of innocence
[1:15:26] praise the lord they can run run all
[1:15:29] through the house and you see the
[1:15:31] physics oh no come back don't go there
[1:15:33] you don't have clothes on you you you
[1:15:36] know shame
[1:15:38] so you you feel embarrassed for the
[1:15:39] little child to run
[1:15:41] but the child don't know shame a little
[1:15:44] baby don't know nothing
[1:15:52] praise the lord
[1:15:55] adam and eve never knew shame
[1:15:58] praise the lord genesis chapter 3 that
[1:16:01] will be the first time
[1:16:03] that they will be exposed to shame
[1:16:07] let's read a little bit of genesis
[1:16:08] chapter 3.
[1:16:26] praise the lord
[1:16:39] genesis chapter 3 verse 6 and when the
[1:16:41] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:16:43] food
[1:16:44] and that it was pleasant to to the eyes
[1:16:47] and the tree to be desired to make one
[1:16:50] why she took off the fruit thereof and
[1:16:52] eat
[1:16:53] and gave also them to her husband with
[1:16:55] hurt and he did
[1:16:57] eat and the eyes of both of
[1:17:00] the eyes of them both were open and
[1:17:03] they knew that they were naked
[1:17:07] another sense is that they became
[1:17:10] shameful
[1:17:12] praise the lord they got a sense
[1:17:16] of shame they knew they were naked and
[1:17:19] they
[1:17:19] saw fake leaves together
[1:17:23] and made themselves april
[1:17:26] and they heard the voice of god walking
[1:17:28] in the garden in the cold of the dead
[1:17:30] and adam and his wife
[1:17:32] hate themself from the presence of the
[1:17:34] lord
[1:17:36] among the trees of the garden
[1:17:40] they were hiding themselves because of
[1:17:42] the hashem
[1:17:44] praise the lord they were dealing with
[1:17:46] shame
[1:17:47] in the wrong way
[1:17:51] are we together the way to deal with
[1:17:53] shame is not to hide
[1:17:56] it's a reality with it is to confront it
[1:18:01] is to separate because what shame does
[1:18:03] is that
[1:18:04] shame try to give you a different
[1:18:06] identity
[1:18:10] his shame tries to change your name
[1:18:14] amen he tried to change your countenance
[1:18:21] shame gives you a sad identity
[1:18:27] and you forget your name and you says
[1:18:29] i'm i'm embarrassed have you ever heard
[1:18:31] people say i'm embarrassed
[1:18:33] embarrass is not your name
[1:18:37] he says i'm i'm embarrassed and some
[1:18:41] i'm very embarrassed the first thing is
[1:18:43] very the last name is embarrassed
[1:18:47] so shame gives you a new identity
[1:18:51] so the way to deal with sheen is to
[1:18:53] separate yourself
[1:18:55] from shame and realize that whatever is
[1:18:59] making you shame
[1:19:00] is is an act it's something that you
[1:19:02] date
[1:19:03] and it's not you it's something that
[1:19:05] projected from you
[1:19:06] even god is not right
[1:19:11] are we together so they were dealing
[1:19:14] with shame here the wrong way
[1:19:17] the bible says he heard the voice of god
[1:19:19] and hid himself from the presence of the
[1:19:20] lord
[1:19:22] and the lord god called onto ottomans
[1:19:24] and said unto him where were there and
[1:19:26] he says
[1:19:28] i've heard a voice in the garden and
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] i was afraid i was afraid i'm ashamed
[1:19:38] because i was naked and i hate myself
[1:19:41] and god said
[1:19:43] who told thee
[1:19:46] praise the lord that thou were naked
[1:19:52] amen who told thee
[1:19:55] so there is another person
[1:19:58] that is identified there in the
[1:20:00] scripture
[1:20:02] who told me
[1:20:05] are we together well i'm i'm not a
[1:20:07] grammar
[1:20:09] still struggling to speak right but i
[1:20:11] think you can think over that a little
[1:20:13] bit
[1:20:14] so this is the first time that shame was
[1:20:16] introduced
[1:20:18] amen this is the first time you think
[1:20:21] about it
[1:20:22] delayed in such such an
[1:20:26] uh uh a state of ignorance
[1:20:29] or uh uh you know a state of purity
[1:20:35] pure conscious never taught about
[1:20:38] evil never thought about anything going
[1:20:42] wrong
[1:20:43] praise the lord and to realize that they
[1:20:46] have find themselves in this
[1:20:50] oh my goodness
[1:20:53] we are naked
[1:20:58] it's all that is coming to their mind
[1:21:01] this is how we have been all this why
[1:21:03] oh my goodness they ain't in the
[1:21:05] struggling for fit leaving everything
[1:21:08] but then as as the scripture when goes
[1:21:11] on
[1:21:12] we realize that god the bible says he
[1:21:14] says
[1:21:16] who told you that that was naked they
[1:21:17] have eaten of the tree
[1:21:19] he says and uh
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:22] and the man said the woman the past the
[1:21:24] bald around we know all the dead
[1:21:27] and the bible makes us to know here over
[1:21:30] in verse
[1:21:31] 21 and and unto adam also
[1:21:36] and his wife that the lord god made a
[1:21:38] coat of skin
[1:21:39] and clothed him so this is
[1:21:43] god's way of dealing with shame
[1:21:46] man's way of dealing with shame is too
[1:21:49] high
[1:21:51] amen is too high because
[1:21:56] i mean they have taken that identity of
[1:21:57] shame and embarrassment
[1:22:00] god way of dealing with shame is to
[1:22:03] identify himself
[1:22:07] with you amen
[1:22:10] make a provision are we together
[1:22:15] so he took a shift skin and he came down
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:18] and made a sacrifice and he approached
[1:22:21] them and we know he dressed them
[1:22:23] took them off of their shameful fake
[1:22:25] leaf
[1:22:26] and then he pulled a coat skin on them
[1:22:29] so genesis chapter 3 that was the first
[1:22:33] time man was
[1:22:34] introduced to shame yeah we we in the
[1:22:37] loudly short age
[1:22:38] a man is at the peak of shame
[1:22:42] praise the lord i mean he's are the pig
[1:22:46] they have done everything i mean there
[1:22:48] is not there is nothing under the sun
[1:22:51] that they have not done shameful
[1:22:56] praise the lord
[1:23:00] i'm not dwelling on the acts of shame
[1:23:02] because we know them
[1:23:04] praise the lord and we have no reason to
[1:23:08] pollute
[1:23:08] our mind with the acts of shame
[1:23:13] that's not what we are here for for the
[1:23:15] mother of fat
[1:23:16] we all deal with shame and what we are
[1:23:20] here
[1:23:21] is to approach god's matter of dealing
[1:23:24] with shame
[1:23:25] because that is the only provider way
[1:23:27] that he had made
[1:23:29] and until we we we we deal with
[1:23:33] shame in god's provided way you can
[1:23:36] never get out of shame
[1:23:40] unless god reached down his hand
[1:23:43] and bring you out of
[1:23:46] a shameful thought a shameful desire
[1:23:50] a shameful habit you can never get out
[1:23:54] all your provision and things you will
[1:23:56] make is just a fake leave
[1:24:01] god was the one that came down to deal
[1:24:05] with the first
[1:24:05] chain and he has to be the one
[1:24:08] that will deal with sheen all the time
[1:24:14] i'll take you back to saint john chapter
[1:24:17] one
[1:24:18] here the scripture says we read here
[1:24:22] in uh uh
[1:24:28] genesis chapter 3 verse 8 and they heard
[1:24:32] the voice of god
[1:24:34] walking in the garden in the cold
[1:24:37] of the day now so what did god say
[1:24:42] to address their shame his voice his
[1:24:45] word
[1:24:48] amen what the god said allowed this shot
[1:24:51] is
[1:24:52] to address a shame the beginning of the
[1:24:55] creation of god
[1:24:56] which is the word
[1:24:59] the word there was shame in the
[1:25:02] beginning
[1:25:02] the world is dealing with shame in the
[1:25:05] end
[1:25:06] because the only way to get man out of
[1:25:09] shame
[1:25:10] is to dress man by this world
[1:25:13] not by the church membership the only
[1:25:16] provision that god have
[1:25:18] to get you out of shame is to bring you
[1:25:21] under the covering
[1:25:22] of the word of god
[1:25:27] that was the way he addressed it in the
[1:25:29] first time
[1:25:31] and that's the way he would address it
[1:25:33] in all ages in
[1:25:34] every time he always deal with shame
[1:25:39] by his word
[1:25:44] praise the lord are we together
[1:25:49] amen
[1:25:53] let's read this together oh my goodness
[1:25:54] i know i'm in trouble again
[1:25:57] i know that
[1:26:06] um
[1:26:15] but branham said this in the in the
[1:26:17] church-ish book
[1:26:19] listening to this he said this in the
[1:26:22] church age book
[1:26:26] exposition of the church ages
[1:26:29] he said
[1:26:33] for in every age
[1:26:36] the church goes astray
[1:26:44] and it is not just the leite
[1:26:49] but the clergy group
[1:26:53] shepherds are wrong as
[1:26:56] well as sheeps
[1:27:01] in every age
[1:27:05] the church goes astray
[1:27:09] not just the lightest but
[1:27:12] the collegiate group the shepherds are
[1:27:15] wrong
[1:27:15] just as she then god brings
[1:27:18] himself on the scene
[1:27:22] as the chief shepherd
[1:27:25] in the ministry of these seven men which
[1:27:28] is the seven golden candlesticks
[1:27:30] the seventh church is messenger
[1:27:34] okay so just like as it was in eating
[1:27:38] adam went astray just as
[1:27:42] eve went straight
[1:27:47] are we together and that is the way the
[1:27:50] church
[1:27:50] both the clergy and the shepherds but
[1:27:53] god brings
[1:27:55] himself on the scene god don't send a
[1:27:59] man
[1:28:00] he brings himself on the scene but
[1:28:03] he will himself
[1:28:06] brother brandon said when the first son
[1:28:08] of god was
[1:28:09] lost in the garden of eden he did not
[1:28:12] send an angel
[1:28:17] no he came down himself
[1:28:21] but he took a form and what was that
[1:28:24] form
[1:28:24] the voice of god was walking in the
[1:28:28] cool of the evening
[1:28:31] that was the form he talked the voice of
[1:28:33] god
[1:28:36] calling adam adam where are you
[1:28:42] because he had a provision
[1:28:47] to be able to deliver them from their
[1:28:50] embarrassed past
[1:28:54] praise the lord amen
[1:28:58] the bible says when god dress out
[1:29:00] underneath they never went back hiding
[1:29:03] they went walking
[1:29:06] the bible says they went walking
[1:29:10] he took them from out of hiding
[1:29:14] dressed them and they went walking
[1:29:17] are we together
[1:29:21] i'm trying to make emphasis because i
[1:29:23] want to grab your attention on something
[1:29:25] yet as we travel down
[1:29:28] then god blames himself on the scene as
[1:29:31] the chief shepherd
[1:29:32] in the ministry of these seven men
[1:29:36] to lead his people back
[1:29:39] to the truth
[1:29:43] so in every age
[1:29:47] the tendency of the people going in
[1:29:50] error
[1:29:52] and even the past test glory in era is
[1:29:54] dead
[1:29:57] in every age
[1:30:01] praise the lord the way to get out of
[1:30:04] error
[1:30:05] is to listen to the voice of one of
[1:30:08] these seven men
[1:30:10] the man of our age the messenger of our
[1:30:13] age
[1:30:15] the tendency of going into error is
[1:30:18] there
[1:30:19] are we together so god use one of these
[1:30:22] men
[1:30:24] and lead his people back to truth and
[1:30:27] the abundant power
[1:30:29] of that truth like paul said the gospel
[1:30:32] never came to us in words alone
[1:30:34] but by the demonstration of the holy
[1:30:36] ghost
[1:30:38] praise the lord we have truth but we
[1:30:41] need the abundant power to be able to
[1:30:44] live that truth
[1:30:47] so he comes and lead his people back to
[1:30:50] that abundant power
[1:30:51] god in his people all of his people
[1:30:55] not only in the clergy but all of his
[1:30:59] people
[1:31:00] for if any man has not the spirit of
[1:31:04] christ
[1:31:04] he is none of his he
[1:31:07] is the word that will be
[1:31:12] the word recognized in
[1:31:15] the people that is god's identification
[1:31:19] in every age the word recognized
[1:31:23] in the people
[1:31:26] are we together praise the lord
[1:31:31] what a wonderful jesus we serve
[1:31:34] amen now this is what i want to show you
[1:31:38] is in john chapter 1 we read in the
[1:31:40] beginning was the word
[1:31:42] the word was with god and the word was
[1:31:45] god
[1:31:46] now see the word the only identification
[1:31:51] in in the book of matthew might you
[1:31:54] identify jesus christ as the king
[1:31:58] it is in the book of matthew where the
[1:32:00] wise men came where is he that is born
[1:32:02] king of the jews
[1:32:04] in the book of mark mark identified him
[1:32:07] as the the seven jehovah
[1:32:10] seven are we together
[1:32:14] in the book of luke luke identify him as
[1:32:17] the son of man
[1:32:19] it's luke that says in the day when the
[1:32:21] son of man is revealed
[1:32:25] are we together praise the lord in the
[1:32:28] book of
[1:32:30] john john identified him
[1:32:33] as what the word
[1:32:38] in the beginning was the word
[1:32:43] are we together now so you see here
[1:32:47] the identification comes in the
[1:32:49] beginning was the word
[1:32:51] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:32:53] us
[1:32:54] saint john chapter 2
[1:32:58] jesus goes over to
[1:33:02] a wedding at canada
[1:33:05] and mary and his mother says i mean the
[1:33:08] wine is finished the people are
[1:33:09] complaining the powder just out of the
[1:33:11] wine is finishing
[1:33:12] and she says you'll go to him and and
[1:33:15] one of you
[1:33:18] praise the lord are we together
[1:33:22] amen and uh and we know
[1:33:27] what happened there amen he says
[1:33:31] woman my time is not yet
[1:33:36] amen that was the correction he gives to
[1:33:38] to marry his mother
[1:33:40] woman my time is not yet but then she
[1:33:43] told them and says
[1:33:44] everything that he asks you do it right
[1:33:48] amen whatever he asks you
[1:33:51] do it but this will almost be
[1:33:56] the second time where jesus
[1:33:59] will be correcting mary
[1:34:02] the first time we know as a little boy
[1:34:05] when it went
[1:34:06] over to the sacrifice
[1:34:11] she came in and she says your father and
[1:34:13] i have been looking for you
[1:34:16] praise the lord amen and he's and he
[1:34:19] said
[1:34:20] which which of course will be the very
[1:34:21] smart very smart
[1:34:24] way for the child to talk to a parent
[1:34:26] don't you know i should be about my
[1:34:27] father's business
[1:34:30] amen amen brother branham says indeed
[1:34:34] the word jesus being the word
[1:34:37] corrected the error
[1:34:42] are we together so is the same
[1:34:45] reflection year
[1:34:46] when she spoke he said woman my time is
[1:34:49] not yet
[1:34:50] the word always corrects
[1:34:54] the error
[1:34:58] that is an identification of
[1:35:01] the word of of of the word of god in
[1:35:04] your age
[1:35:05] the identification of the word of god in
[1:35:07] your life
[1:35:08] is that it will always correct the error
[1:35:14] the world will tell you that that thing
[1:35:16] is not right
[1:35:17] this thing is not right it's contrary to
[1:35:19] the word of god it will
[1:35:21] always correct the error because that's
[1:35:24] the identification of the word
[1:35:26] that's in john chapter 2. saint john
[1:35:29] chapter 3
[1:35:31] the word again nicodemus meets
[1:35:34] jesus
[1:35:38] he comes by night and said master
[1:35:41] we the pharisees know that no man can do
[1:35:44] these things
[1:35:46] until god be with him
[1:35:50] praise the lord right there in chapter 3
[1:35:54] now the word was introduced in chapter
[1:35:56] one chapter two the word corrects the
[1:35:58] error of
[1:35:59] chapter three the word require at birth
[1:36:06] that you must be born again
[1:36:11] are we together
[1:36:14] chapter four the word brings deliverance
[1:36:17] to a woman
[1:36:23] i might make you to be interested in
[1:36:24] reading st john when you go home
[1:36:29] because you see the word going from one
[1:36:31] chapter to another
[1:36:36] are we together but what are we talking
[1:36:40] about
[1:36:41] it's the word dealing with sheen
[1:36:46] we spoke a little bit about that last
[1:36:47] week the woman of the world she was
[1:36:49] dealing with sheen
[1:36:51] she tried to cover it with religion
[1:36:54] we the pharisees
[1:36:58] or we the the the samaritans
[1:37:01] we worship on this mountain you say it
[1:37:03] is dead in jerusalem that
[1:37:05] she tried to cover hashem with church
[1:37:08] membership
[1:37:10] but she was dealing with the word
[1:37:14] the word got under her sleeves
[1:37:18] and say i have water that i can give you
[1:37:20] you will never have to come back here
[1:37:24] praise the lord the word identify her
[1:37:28] needs
[1:37:30] that's what the word is said for our age
[1:37:32] that's why god sent
[1:37:33] a prophet
[1:37:37] it's not for us to be identified with a
[1:37:39] church or identify with
[1:37:41] a movement it's for us to get for this
[1:37:43] world to get ahold of us
[1:37:50] praise the lord she says well
[1:37:54] give me some of that water so i won't
[1:37:56] come back yet again i can just stay in
[1:37:58] my little corner
[1:38:00] and i will now have to come back out
[1:38:02] again
[1:38:05] the word say okay go and call your
[1:38:06] husband oh my goodness
[1:38:11] he hit the main thing that was
[1:38:13] embarrassing here
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:17] that's that's the way the word is praise
[1:38:20] the lord
[1:38:21] i mean that is the way the word is
[1:38:24] choose not to read the bible
[1:38:26] god will use the son to preach the word
[1:38:29] to you
[1:38:35] he will use the things happening around
[1:38:37] your life
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:41] praise the lord he said go and call your
[1:38:44] husband
[1:38:45] we know the story she says i don't have
[1:38:47] a husband
[1:38:49] say oh yeah you just said the truth when
[1:38:52] he said you just said the truth see the
[1:38:54] peace that came over here
[1:38:59] then he said you high five
[1:39:03] even the one that you are with now
[1:39:08] what was the word doing the world was
[1:39:11] not
[1:39:12] embarrassing her because she was already
[1:39:15] embarrassed
[1:39:16] the word was delivering her from shame
[1:39:23] praise the lord the word was dealing
[1:39:26] with her problem
[1:39:28] to deliver her from shame when jesus
[1:39:30] said that
[1:39:31] just like i said last week the woman
[1:39:34] just
[1:39:35] brushed a lie shine in she shouted come
[1:39:38] and see the man
[1:39:39] they have told me the things that i've
[1:39:40] done the very things that she was
[1:39:42] shameful about
[1:39:43] the things that she had kept to herself
[1:39:45] all her life
[1:39:48] now she was ready to tell everybody he
[1:39:50] told me everything
[1:39:53] i believe some of her friends said what
[1:39:54] was some other thing
[1:40:00] praise the lord amen
[1:40:08] so god always sent his word
[1:40:12] in every age because
[1:40:15] since eating since she
[1:40:18] was introduced every age has
[1:40:22] dealt with their shame
[1:40:26] praise the lord abraham there was shame
[1:40:31] when he was caught
[1:40:34] that he lied
[1:40:38] that sarah was not his wife
[1:40:44] praise the lord he had to deal with that
[1:40:46] shame
[1:40:49] amen i've been
[1:40:52] like sent for him why you had to lie to
[1:40:54] me
[1:40:58] every age
[1:41:04] how to deal with shame but there is not
[1:41:06] an age
[1:41:07] that is that have there was shame like
[1:41:09] the kind of shame that we are dealing
[1:41:11] with in our age
[1:41:16] praise the lord amen
[1:41:22] we can all say praise the lord and thank
[1:41:25] you jesus
[1:41:27] that your grace has brought us out
[1:41:31] amen oh we have recognized the message
[1:41:35] of our day
[1:41:37] we we have seen it but we still live in
[1:41:40] the age
[1:41:42] we still have to go to the grocery
[1:41:44] stores we still have to
[1:41:46] do our our our work on the internet we
[1:41:49] say
[1:41:50] we we i mean we're in the age and all of
[1:41:53] these things are all around us
[1:41:57] praise the lord
[1:42:02] every day the enemy tried to throw
[1:42:07] a shame on our lap and see
[1:42:10] how you're going to deal with him
[1:42:13] sometimes it's not an act that you are
[1:42:15] in
[1:42:16] sometimes he goes to your memory
[1:42:20] and talks something that you did in the
[1:42:22] past and throw it in your life and say
[1:42:24] deal with it
[1:42:26] because every day we have to overcome
[1:42:29] shame
[1:42:33] praise the lord
[1:42:36] and then he starts working on your mind
[1:42:38] he starts he says
[1:42:40] get to your feelings and making you
[1:42:43] sorry for yourself
[1:42:44] and making you all to feel so
[1:42:46] embarrassed you don't even want to
[1:42:48] remember that it was even you that did
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:56] the lord but how did god
[1:43:00] deal with shame by taking the identity
[1:43:03] of the word
[1:43:08] praise the lord every time there was
[1:43:11] shame
[1:43:12] he took an identity of the word
[1:43:19] are we together
[1:43:25] saint john chapter 6 the word was
[1:43:28] rejected
[1:43:29] that's what jesus said on the bread of
[1:43:31] life the seven
[1:43:32] i am came right in between there
[1:43:35] i'm the bread of life i'm the i'm i'm
[1:43:38] the living water
[1:43:39] if any man drink of me he would church
[1:43:41] no more out of your bella would burst
[1:43:43] living water that's what he said
[1:43:51] saint john chapter 7 also it was other
[1:43:54] great feasts
[1:43:58] that was where he made that that uh that
[1:44:01] that proclamation that out of you will
[1:44:04] flow
[1:44:05] living water if you come and drink from
[1:44:07] him because he's the water of life in
[1:44:09] john chapter eight
[1:44:11] we talked about it last week also
[1:44:16] that was what he did with the woman that
[1:44:19] was caught in adultery
[1:44:22] saint john chapter four the
[1:44:25] the the word there with a shame saint
[1:44:28] john chapter eight
[1:44:29] it did with a shame a woman caught in
[1:44:31] adultery
[1:44:33] seen john chapter 12 he also there with
[1:44:36] hashem another woman
[1:44:39] that came and pulled an alabaster bus on
[1:44:41] jesus's head
[1:44:43] all of that is a type of the church the
[1:44:46] word in
[1:44:47] john chapter one is delivering the
[1:44:49] church
[1:44:50] of hashem all the time
[1:44:54] it's the only thing that can that can
[1:44:56] restore us back to god
[1:45:03] are we together brother branham said
[1:45:14] this
[1:45:21] god's way have been made for us he says
[1:45:23] i tell you
[1:45:35] i tell you friends there's been
[1:45:38] many men and it's tonight that's coming
[1:45:42] down to the end of the road
[1:45:45] we'll find out that
[1:45:48] that little shallow religion
[1:45:52] that you are holding onto
[1:45:55] won't work
[1:45:58] praise the lord that little shallow
[1:46:01] religion
[1:46:02] i believe the message amen
[1:46:07] brother branham is is my prophet
[1:46:13] it's just a shallow religion because
[1:46:15] there is something the word is requiring
[1:46:17] us of this
[1:46:18] age
[1:46:24] god vindicated brother branham dedicated
[1:46:27] the message around the world
[1:46:31] around the world this is a vindicator
[1:46:35] message
[1:46:36] whether you believe it or you walk away
[1:46:39] from it the message is
[1:46:40] vindicated
[1:46:46] the message is dedicated behind the
[1:46:49] curtains of time
[1:46:51] there were scenes that said we are
[1:46:53] resting
[1:46:55] on this praise the lord
[1:47:01] behind the curtains of time there are
[1:47:04] sins that said
[1:47:05] we are resting on this
[1:47:12] so it is not your decision now
[1:47:15] that is going to make god to reverse his
[1:47:20] vindication
[1:47:25] but ben says and we read he says
[1:47:29] again there's many of men tonight that
[1:47:32] are coming down to the end of
[1:47:34] of the road and we find out
[1:47:37] that that shallow religion that you are
[1:47:40] holding on to won't work
[1:47:43] nothing short of being born again
[1:47:47] nothing shocked of being born again
[1:47:52] and what is being born again at birth of
[1:47:55] the word
[1:47:57] now the birth that makes you to belong
[1:47:59] to a church
[1:48:00] a breath of the word now born the flesh
[1:48:04] now born the blood not born of man
[1:48:07] but born of god
[1:48:14] he says nothing short of that
[1:48:18] will work
[1:48:21] jesus said except a man be born again of
[1:48:24] the water and the spirit
[1:48:27] he will in once enter
[1:48:30] the kingdom of heaven praise the lord
[1:48:35] are we together mark of the beast 1954
[1:48:38] brother brandon says
[1:48:40] i found the church standing
[1:48:43] in its beauty this is revelation chapter
[1:48:47] chapter one he's describing you
[1:48:52] jesus in the midst of the seven golden
[1:48:54] candlesticks that's what he's going to
[1:48:55] talk about
[1:48:56] saw the church standing in his beauty
[1:48:58] christ
[1:48:59] just molded into it christ
[1:49:03] in bright form the church standing in
[1:49:06] building
[1:49:07] christ just molded into it
[1:49:11] and the church had a white garment
[1:49:15] and you notice it was a woman
[1:49:18] around the breast
[1:49:21] amen that's the one that john saw in
[1:49:24] revelation chapter 1
[1:49:26] christ in the midst of the golden
[1:49:28] candlestick having
[1:49:30] a lamb tied around his breast
[1:49:34] are we together
[1:49:41] around the breast aha the gummy
[1:49:45] covering over hashing
[1:49:48] so you see when christ came in the midst
[1:49:51] of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:49:53] he met the church in sheen
[1:49:58] so he gave the church himself as a
[1:50:01] covering
[1:50:04] praise the lord amen
[1:50:08] he gave the church himself as a covering
[1:50:13] covering over her sheen and it had
[1:50:17] a golem called true pulled around it
[1:50:20] that held it around the breast white
[1:50:23] speaking of the righteousness of christ
[1:50:26] and the golden cod represents the gospel
[1:50:29] the preaching of the gospel bringing the
[1:50:32] holy spirit
[1:50:33] over the church the righteousness of
[1:50:36] christ
[1:50:40] hold it there tie the strings
[1:50:44] amen the gator strange
[1:50:48] praise the lord the gospel being
[1:50:51] preached
[1:50:52] breaking the righteousness of jesus
[1:50:54] christ
[1:50:55] to do what covered the church he became
[1:50:59] sin for us
[1:51:00] that we might become his very
[1:51:04] righteousness
[1:51:07] the way to deal with shame is not to
[1:51:09] make excuses
[1:51:13] no is to find a provision of the word
[1:51:19] what has the word provided for me to
[1:51:22] deal with this situation
[1:51:24] what is in the word i would take what
[1:51:26] the word has provided
[1:51:29] let the devil blast my mind with
[1:51:31] whatever he wanted i would take what the
[1:51:33] world has provided
[1:51:35] he became shame for me so i might be his
[1:51:38] very righteousness
[1:51:43] i was together in the midst of the
[1:51:46] golden candlesticks
[1:51:47] he come as a covering to the church he
[1:51:49] covers the church
[1:51:51] by himself
[1:51:56] praise the lord that's why
[1:51:59] branham used that statement over and
[1:52:01] over this christ in bribe form
[1:52:04] because it's the church is the bride but
[1:52:06] it's christ in the midst
[1:52:15] this age of shame
[1:52:18] praise the lord and it's also
[1:52:22] the same age with all the churches
[1:52:26] and all the denomination and all the
[1:52:28] things that is there
[1:52:30] this age is also a shame of him
[1:52:36] there is no age that have been ashamed
[1:52:38] of the name of jesus christ like this
[1:52:40] age
[1:52:43] people want their their their christian
[1:52:46] life to be a secret life
[1:52:48] they want their faith to be a secret
[1:52:50] life
[1:52:54] because they don't want to offend people
[1:53:05] if the message delivers you from shame
[1:53:07] you cannot be ashamed of him
[1:53:11] praise the lord amen amen
[1:53:15] people would rather stay in their shame
[1:53:17] and hide themselves
[1:53:21] come to the liberty of jesus christ
[1:53:23] receive the grace of god
[1:53:26] the baptism of the holy ghost and yet
[1:53:30] we are ashamed of him the one that has
[1:53:32] brought his righteousness to cover
[1:53:34] our nakedness
[1:53:38] we are ashamed of him
[1:53:42] we want to make people to think that
[1:53:44] it's our way of life
[1:53:47] instead of letting them to know that no
[1:53:48] this is not me
[1:53:50] it's him
[1:53:55] it's him i'm a very disgraceful person
[1:53:59] i'm a person of shame
[1:54:03] filled with lost and filled with uh
[1:54:06] evil talks and filled with he is the one
[1:54:08] that has covered my shame
[1:54:11] why should i be ashamed of him
[1:54:20] during the time of the reformation those
[1:54:23] people were the little that they knew
[1:54:25] about christ
[1:54:27] they little didn't kneel they wanted to
[1:54:31] they wanted to go
[1:54:32] into danger areas they wanted to go to
[1:54:34] places like korea
[1:54:36] to bring the name of jesus go to places
[1:54:38] like china
[1:54:39] they wanted to go behind the iron
[1:54:41] curtain behind
[1:54:43] the the places where they could be
[1:54:46] killed
[1:54:46] because of their faith just the little
[1:54:48] they had
[1:54:50] they never knew nothing about the
[1:54:51] mystery of god they never knew nothing
[1:54:53] about baptism in jesus name
[1:54:55] all they had was i accepted jesus as the
[1:54:58] lord and savior
[1:54:59] they were not ashamed they were ready to
[1:55:01] die for their conviction
[1:55:04] but this age has received the greatest
[1:55:07] revelation of god
[1:55:11] their son of man manifesting in our age
[1:55:15] and showing grace to the world bringing
[1:55:17] a pardon
[1:55:19] and yet we are ashamed we are ashamed of
[1:55:23] him
[1:55:29] we are so conscious of our own pride
[1:55:35] we think about our reputation and we are
[1:55:38] ashamed
[1:55:39] of him that's the age of shame
[1:55:44] the enemy has flipping around
[1:55:49] because he knows that the message has
[1:55:52] come to bring us out of shame
[1:55:55] so now he's making us embarrassed of the
[1:55:58] one
[1:55:58] that has delivered us
[1:56:02] rather brag on the name of a church or
[1:56:04] brag on the name of a pastor
[1:56:10] instead of breaking on the word
[1:56:15] this is the thing that has delivered us
[1:56:17] from our shame
[1:56:21] praise the lord amen you can have the
[1:56:24] message book you can have the seven
[1:56:26] seals
[1:56:26] and the seven church edges under your
[1:56:28] arm if you never met the word in person
[1:56:31] you will have those message book the
[1:56:32] pillow of fire picture and still live in
[1:56:35] shame
[1:56:35] i've seen embarrassing embarrassing
[1:56:38] things that have been done
[1:56:41] eating in homes
[1:56:45] we leave the message book on the counter
[1:56:47] the bible on the table
[1:56:49] and we stay used in certain words we
[1:56:52] force ourselves to say we
[1:56:54] we have never heard the name of jesus
[1:56:55] christ it's an evidence that this world
[1:56:58] is not taking place in our life
[1:57:00] the identification of christ in all ages
[1:57:03] is the word of god
[1:57:08] this world must be changing us
[1:57:13] it must be changing us
[1:57:20] let's see what paul says romans chapter
[1:57:21] 8 verse 29.
[1:57:25] praise the lord
[1:57:38] paul said in romans chapter eight see
[1:57:40] paul speaks here
[1:57:41] about the image that we are conformed to
[1:57:48] are we together amen
[1:57:55] verse 28 he says for we know that all
[1:57:57] things work together for good to them
[1:57:59] that love the lord
[1:58:00] to them who i call i call into
[1:58:04] to his purpose for whom he did for
[1:58:07] known he also did predestinate to be
[1:58:11] conformed to the image of his son
[1:58:15] what is the image of his son in the
[1:58:18] beginning was the word
[1:58:21] the word was with god the word was
[1:58:24] god the word took on flesh and
[1:58:27] came among us the image that we're
[1:58:30] supposed to be conformed to
[1:58:32] is the word it's the word
[1:58:37] it's not this image
[1:58:40] for the model of fight this is just a
[1:58:42] painting
[1:58:44] it's just a painting the reason why we
[1:58:46] use it in the message is because brother
[1:58:48] branham said
[1:58:49] his first vision that he had of the lord
[1:58:52] jesus
[1:58:53] was exactly like huffman picture
[1:58:56] it's just a painting so what
[1:59:00] image are we to be conformed to the word
[1:59:02] of god
[1:59:03] the message of our day
[1:59:08] that is the image of the dear son that
[1:59:10] has come to us
[1:59:12] is not to wear our beer like this
[1:59:16] keep our head down long
[1:59:22] first corinthians chapter 11.
[1:59:26] let's do a little bible study here i
[1:59:28] will leave you in the next five six
[1:59:30] minutes
[1:59:33] praise the lord
[1:59:40] first corinthians 11.
[1:59:45] paul speaks here
[1:59:52] 11 7.
[1:59:59] we're talking about conform to the image
[2:00:03] he says for the man indeed are not to
[2:00:06] cover
[2:00:07] his head for as much as
[2:00:11] he is in the image and the glory of god
[2:00:16] but the woman in the glory of
[2:00:19] the man praise the lord
[2:00:24] amen
[2:00:26] now if you look at this
[2:00:30] we know that the bible make us to know
[2:00:33] in genesis chapter 1 that
[2:00:35] god created man in his image
[2:00:39] male and female
[2:00:42] created he did that's what the scripture
[2:00:45] says
[2:00:46] so why is paul saying here
[2:00:49] that the man is created in the image of
[2:00:51] god
[2:00:52] and a woman in the image and the glory
[2:00:55] of the man
[2:00:56] why is he saying that paul is only
[2:00:59] talking about
[2:01:00] his he's not talking about original
[2:01:04] creation because in the original
[2:01:06] creation according to genesis
[2:01:08] chapter 1 26 when god made man in his
[2:01:11] image
[2:01:12] man was both male and female
[2:01:19] so the thing that paul is addressing
[2:01:22] here is his
[2:01:25] that was the same thing he spoke in
[2:01:27] ephesians chapter 5
[2:01:29] where he says the christ is the head of
[2:01:31] the of the man
[2:01:32] the man is the head of the woman that's
[2:01:34] the same thing he's addressing
[2:01:36] here so what is he saying
[2:01:43] christ the word
[2:01:46] is the invisible image of god
[2:01:50] that is the head of the church praise
[2:01:53] the lord
[2:01:54] amen because the word is reflecting the
[2:01:57] father
[2:02:00] praise the lord so if the man submit to
[2:02:03] the word
[2:02:04] the world will have influence on him
[2:02:07] praise the lord and he will be able to
[2:02:09] project the father
[2:02:11] and then the woman will come on a
[2:02:13] subjection
[2:02:16] that's what paul is dealing with here
[2:02:18] the image
[2:02:19] is to come under the word let the world
[2:02:22] be our hair shape amen
[2:02:29] are we together second corinthians
[2:02:31] chapter three
[2:02:44] you can't change anybody the word for
[2:02:46] the man
[2:02:48] for god to deal with the inner part of a
[2:02:50] man or the woman
[2:02:51] is not in the hands of any martyr
[2:02:55] that power is in the word
[2:03:00] you want god to change your wife submit
[2:03:02] to the world
[2:03:05] you want god to change your husband
[2:03:06] submit to the world come
[2:03:08] under the hair shape of the world
[2:03:12] then god can flow through that channel
[2:03:15] and have influence
[2:03:25] ii corinthians chapter 3 verse 18
[2:03:28] paul comes again he says verse 17
[2:03:32] now the spirit of the lord now
[2:03:35] the lord is that spirit and where the
[2:03:37] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[2:03:40] praise the lord but we
[2:03:43] all with the open face beholding us
[2:03:46] in the glass the glory of the lord
[2:03:50] are changing
[2:03:53] into the same image
[2:03:56] from glory to glory
[2:04:00] even by the spirit of the lord
[2:04:03] what image the word
[2:04:07] it comes back to the word is the word
[2:04:10] that is changing us from glory to glory
[2:04:13] brother branham said is making us better
[2:04:16] husbands
[2:04:16] it's making us better wives in making us
[2:04:20] better sons of god
[2:04:21] better daughters of god that's the
[2:04:23] purpose of the word
[2:04:25] to change us for us to walk from glory
[2:04:27] to glory
[2:04:32] it's the image
[2:04:37] read the book of deuteronomy chapter 6
[2:04:42] god told the children of israel i never
[2:04:44] took
[2:04:45] any form when i came to you i never took
[2:04:48] the form of a bird
[2:04:50] i never took the form of any heavenly
[2:04:52] creature
[2:04:54] praise the lord the uniform
[2:04:57] chapter 8 eternal chapter 8 the only
[2:05:00] form that i talk
[2:05:02] was when i spoke to you from the
[2:05:04] mountain
[2:05:06] and that's where the familiar scripture
[2:05:07] comes from men shall not live by bread
[2:05:10] alone
[2:05:11] but by every word of god the word of god
[2:05:15] is the greatest form of god among the
[2:05:18] people
[2:05:24] you know why god esteemed job
[2:05:28] the book of job testified he extended
[2:05:32] the word of god
[2:05:34] above his necessary need
[2:05:41] that was the identity that was the thing
[2:05:43] that god saw in job
[2:05:45] and man that extended the word of god
[2:05:51] the regard he had for the word of god
[2:05:54] the love he had for the word of god
[2:05:58] we can just love this word in our mouth
[2:06:00] the prophet said the bible says we must
[2:06:02] submit to the word
[2:06:04] the word must be reflected in our life
[2:06:20] that is the thing that changed us
[2:06:24] from glory to glory
[2:06:27] is bringing us out of our shame
[2:06:30] we are not ashamed of him we can testify
[2:06:34] out of him
[2:06:35] we can talk about him praise the lord
[2:06:38] amen we are not dressing the way we
[2:06:41] dress because our church wants us so no
[2:06:43] you get it wrong
[2:06:46] it must be because the lord jesus
[2:06:51] praise the lord i'm dressing like this
[2:06:55] to please the lord jesus
[2:07:03] oh no in a message we can do this
[2:07:05] although in a message we can do that
[2:07:11] it becomes a slogan among us
[2:07:14] praise the lord until when we are in the
[2:07:16] camera of the message we have in one
[2:07:18] form of life
[2:07:19] when we go away from the camp
[2:07:23] then we have a complete different form
[2:07:25] of life
[2:07:27] but you have to know that you can never
[2:07:28] go away from the presence of the world
[2:07:31] because david said where can i go to
[2:07:33] hide myself from thee
[2:07:34] if i make my bed in hell be all you are
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:38] there
[2:07:50] what is the message of the hour christ
[2:07:52] is the mystery of god revealed
[2:07:54] the word among the people
[2:07:58] the world living in our homes
[2:08:10] collusion chapter 3 verse 10.
[2:08:26] praise the lord
[2:08:30] paul says this collusion chapter 3 verse
[2:08:32] 10
[2:08:34] amen
[2:08:38] oh my goodness
[2:08:54] my pages are sticking together my hand
[2:08:56] is trimming
[2:09:07] okay paul says this
[2:09:11] when he speaks of the word in this in
[2:09:13] this in this light
[2:09:15] and in this form
[2:09:21] and it's almost the same thing that we
[2:09:22] read over in
[2:09:24] john chapter one paul brings that out
[2:09:28] clear to us
[2:09:29] is by the word that everything was made
[2:09:35] amen
[2:09:44] people church
[2:09:47] that's the greatest thing that has come
[2:09:49] to us in our age
[2:09:53] this message of the hour
[2:09:56] is jesus christ in the midst of the
[2:10:00] people
[2:10:04] amen this message of the hour is jesus
[2:10:12] christ
[2:10:15] and that's where he's bringing his
[2:10:18] church
[2:10:19] also
[2:10:25] that's how god deeds washing
[2:10:30] he deals with shame by coming to
[2:10:32] identify
[2:10:34] with you praise the lord
[2:10:38] you know jesus talked about a story
[2:10:40] about a good samaritan
[2:10:42] when he walked down there and he saw
[2:10:43] that man the priest come and saw the man
[2:10:46] and realized he's not a church member
[2:10:48] even if he's a church man but he's not
[2:10:50] supposed to be in that condition
[2:10:52] so let's just leave him
[2:10:55] this tribe came the one that knew the
[2:10:57] world saw the man
[2:10:59] but when a good samaritan came he
[2:11:01] identified himself
[2:11:03] when god came in in the garden of eden
[2:11:06] he never left adam and eve he dressed
[2:11:08] him
[2:11:09] and for him to address them he had to
[2:11:11] identify
[2:11:12] that's how god deals with sheen
[2:11:18] brother brandon said you have to step
[2:11:20] into a man's shoes
[2:11:24] he said i look at that blind man there
[2:11:26] in india no shoes on his feet i thought
[2:11:28] about my father i look at my feet
[2:11:30] look at his feet my shoes won't fit him
[2:11:33] or as i would take off my shoes and give
[2:11:35] it to him
[2:11:38] the way to deal with shame is not to
[2:11:41] leave you across the street
[2:11:43] is to identify with faith
[2:11:52] but you know so many other times we we
[2:11:53] act like pharisees
[2:11:55] we don't want our white garment to be
[2:11:57] stained
[2:12:02] our garment is so white on the outside
[2:12:07] that we don't want it to be stained
[2:12:11] so we can only sit down and talk about
[2:12:14] the person
[2:12:17] praise the lord and sometimes that's the
[2:12:20] reason why
[2:12:20] it's it's even difficult when we're
[2:12:22] struggling in ourselves
[2:12:24] when we're dealing with personal shame
[2:12:29] it comes and give us an identity it
[2:12:31] gives us a new name
[2:12:33] then he says i'm just embarrassed about
[2:12:36] myself you know you talk to you talk to
[2:12:38] yourself
[2:12:38] in your mind and you know you know and
[2:12:40] you know and the devil keeps working on
[2:12:42] your mind
[2:12:45] all you have to do go to the word
[2:12:49] the word has a provision
[2:12:53] and the way the word deals with our
[2:12:55] shame is by identifying himself
[2:12:59] christ came in the midst of the seven
[2:13:00] goalie candlestick and he became the
[2:13:03] covering
[2:13:05] when the prodigal son came back the
[2:13:08] father
[2:13:09] left from on high ran down through the
[2:13:12] city
[2:13:14] and he covered his son
[2:13:18] why because the book of the tournament
[2:13:20] required that if he comes back
[2:13:22] they should stone him to death when he
[2:13:24] comes to the city
[2:13:26] so the father was willing to take the
[2:13:28] stone for the son
[2:13:30] that's how god deals with shame
[2:13:37] praise the lord
[2:13:41] brother branham irish and davos
[2:13:45] one of the most embarrassing subject
[2:13:47] that a prophet of god will preach
[2:13:51] he talks about it and he talks about it
[2:13:53] he says many of my good friends
[2:13:56] sitting down here
[2:14:00] and knowing that it was a difficult
[2:14:02] thing he had to go to god
[2:14:07] that was the same way that moses did
[2:14:09] with it
[2:14:10] he had to go to god
[2:14:15] going on behalf of the people
[2:14:19] identifying oneself with the needs of
[2:14:22] the people
[2:14:23] and said lord yes the people that you
[2:14:25] have given me many good friends of mine
[2:14:28] are caught up in this father
[2:14:31] will you be merciful give us a pattern
[2:14:36] be merciful identifying
[2:14:39] oneself with the needs of the people
[2:14:42] moses
[2:14:43] put himself in again and said god if you
[2:14:46] kill these people you have to deal with
[2:14:47] me
[2:14:48] that's the way to deal with shame
[2:14:50] because the people have become a
[2:14:52] shameful
[2:14:53] people before god complaining arguing
[2:15:04] many of us young families
[2:15:09] we're living in a shameful age sometimes
[2:15:12] you catch the young people doing
[2:15:14] shameful things
[2:15:17] praise the lord
[2:15:21] learn how to deal with shame
[2:15:24] even when you catch yourself dealing
[2:15:26] with shameful things
[2:15:30] bring it to the world because that's
[2:15:33] what your covering
[2:15:34] is
[2:15:38] praise the lord that's where your
[2:15:40] covering is
[2:15:49] sometimes we parents young parents
[2:15:52] we having high expectations for our
[2:15:54] children
[2:15:55] and those expectations put a lot of
[2:15:57] pressure on them
[2:15:59] and sometimes when they are caught in
[2:16:01] shameful things
[2:16:03] always go as a covering
[2:16:07] that that child can trust you to be able
[2:16:10] to tell you what they are dealing with
[2:16:14] if you separate them from yourself this
[2:16:16] is embarrassing it's just
[2:16:18] this is not in our family it's you make
[2:16:20] them a stranger
[2:16:25] when god saw our shame of adam and eve
[2:16:28] he came down he never left in the
[2:16:32] heavens he came down and his voice was
[2:16:35] walking
[2:16:36] in the garden adam
[2:16:39] where are you
[2:16:44] he didn't say bring yourself here you
[2:16:46] are an embarrassment
[2:16:48] i don't wear you you are an
[2:16:50] embarrassment to this family i put you
[2:16:52] over this place see see what you have
[2:16:53] done
[2:16:55] bring your naked self here god never did
[2:16:58] that
[2:17:01] he says where are you adam
[2:17:06] where you have been i've been all around
[2:17:07] looking for you boy where are you what's
[2:17:09] happening what's going wrong
[2:17:11] trying to make him comfortable for him
[2:17:14] to speak
[2:17:15] out because you will never deal with
[2:17:18] shame
[2:17:20] praise the lord
[2:17:27] with a wrong attitude
[2:17:35] because he was a holy god
[2:17:42] he came with a bleeding line
[2:17:46] recon reconciling adam back to his
[2:17:48] presence
[2:17:50] he had a bleeding line that stood before
[2:17:53] them
[2:17:54] and he wrapped him in
[2:17:57] that blouse came
[2:18:00] and the ones that were hiding could now
[2:18:03] walk before god
[2:18:06] they walk before god
[2:18:10] and brother brandon says when god looked
[2:18:12] down and saw adam and eve walking
[2:18:14] from his presence he said i would have
[2:18:17] to calm down one of these days
[2:18:19] and identify myself with my bride
[2:18:27] that's how god deals with shame
[2:18:31] that's why there was nothing enough that
[2:18:34] god could send to the laodicean age
[2:18:38] by himself he came himself
[2:18:42] in the form of a humble ministry
[2:18:46] a humble kentucky ministry
[2:18:49] he came himself
[2:18:54] took a prophet from a life of shame
[2:18:56] brother branham says
[2:18:57] the name branham was a shameful name in
[2:19:00] jeffersonville
[2:19:02] because my father was a drunkard
[2:19:05] everybody knew
[2:19:07] the branham name all we do was just
[2:19:09] drunk and fight with dance
[2:19:15] but god has to meet him
[2:19:19] and take him from the sheep god
[2:19:23] he sees one time i was so ashamed to
[2:19:27] walk through the street
[2:19:29] i was so ashamed to even tell people i'm
[2:19:32] a brandon
[2:19:35] nobody will be my friends
[2:19:38] he says now i have to even hide myself
[2:19:40] to get rest
[2:19:42] because why god identify with him
[2:19:46] cover the shame and make the thing that
[2:19:50] was shameful
[2:19:51] and glory
[2:19:54] that went around the world seven times
[2:19:58] and that's the thing that has pulled us
[2:19:59] in this place
[2:20:01] is that word that's the thing that is
[2:20:05] working on us
[2:20:09] dealing with our shame
[2:20:15] praise the lord that's the reason why
[2:20:18] brother branham says
[2:20:19] there is one person i can break on jesus
[2:20:22] christ
[2:20:26] there was no no ministry
[2:20:30] lifted the name of jesus
[2:20:34] like william branham he said i hope it's
[2:20:37] the only thing that god
[2:20:38] has against me because i brag on jesus a
[2:20:42] lot
[2:20:45] he said somebody said well then branham
[2:20:46] you brag on jesus too much
[2:20:48] he said i hope it's the only thing that
[2:20:50] god has against me
[2:20:53] but god has to take him from shame
[2:20:59] taking from a shameful family past
[2:21:06] and god turned that shame into glory
[2:21:15] and i believe he can do the same today
[2:21:18] praise the lord amen if
[2:21:21] i mean if we just if we just pass the
[2:21:23] you know pass the mark around i mean
[2:21:25] yeah
[2:21:25] i mean there are things that we will
[2:21:27] talk about today praise the lord i just
[2:21:29] hope you shut the youtube channel down
[2:21:31] because
[2:21:32] you're still writing amen now there's
[2:21:35] there are things we could talk about
[2:21:36] today that would just that mean it would
[2:21:38] just blow the whole youtube channel off
[2:21:41] because things that have never been
[2:21:42] heard but yet god has brought us out of
[2:21:45] those shame
[2:21:49] he's turning our shame into glory
[2:21:54] praise the lord he has given us beauty
[2:21:57] for arches
[2:22:01] the lord of joy for mourning
[2:22:05] and the garment of praise for the spirit
[2:22:08] of heaviness
