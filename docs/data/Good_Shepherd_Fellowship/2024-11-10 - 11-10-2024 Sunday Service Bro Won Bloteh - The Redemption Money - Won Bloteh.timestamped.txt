[57:02] Nation praise the Lord and uh uh we we
[57:06] love to strengthen our you know our
[57:09] family life encourage one another
[57:11] because there's never been a time where
[57:14] there had just been so much pressure so
[57:16] much battle on uh on home life because
[57:19] if they enemy can destroy that then we
[57:23] we really don't have church because the
[57:25] church is at home home amen just like
[57:28] our brother said on Wednesday we bring
[57:29] Church to church amen I hope you brought
[57:32] Church to church amen I hope you brought
[57:34] Church to come and have church you have
[57:36] to bring Church to come and have church
[57:38] amen praise the Lord if you don't have
[57:41] church at home you'll just be staring
[57:43] and you'll be sleeping and you'll be
[57:45] wondering what's going on so uh uh you
[57:48] know we we we want to take a leap of fi
[57:51] I know it was a late call and we want to
[57:54] take a leap of fi and and see what uh uh
[57:57] but it it turned out that the Lord is
[58:00] giving us favor I heard a few of the the
[58:03] the Saints From Grace Ministry call in
[58:05] that there will be coming so that that
[58:08] uh that help us amen that will help our
[58:11] numbers like we have like we have always
[58:14] said amen you know uh uh we we plan
[58:17] these things and then we realize that we
[58:20] don't have people to have them but it
[58:23] it's not going to deter us from doing
[58:25] what the burden that we have to do amen
[58:28] if there is just one person that will
[58:30] that will be blessed from it that is our
[58:32] desire amen just like we said last week
[58:36] it's God that gave names you try to make
[58:38] name it will fail amen God has to make
[58:43] name and he make Name by the character
[58:45] that he build in us the things that he
[58:47] take us through that's how he makes make
[58:50] name and after all it is his name praise
[58:53] the Lord this morning I want to talk on
[58:56] their Redemption
[58:58] money their Redemption money I want to
[59:02] talk about money but I was trying to
[59:04] find a way what cannot praise the Lord
[59:08] before it looks like I'm chasing after
[59:10] your money so I just say let me find
[59:14] something so I can talk about money amen
[59:18] so I can so this morning I'm going to
[59:21] talk on the Redemption money actually I
[59:24] entitled my my my S
[59:27] by of me God that word by of me God I
[59:33] want us to get you see because the
[59:35] church has traveled in the long uh uh uh
[59:40] deceitful in some sense or ignorant
[59:43] understanding of the word and it
[59:46] have either either either limit us or
[59:50] erupt us because of how we are
[59:53] understanding the word praise the Lord
[59:56] by of me gold is so easy for people to
[1:00:00] start selling hanger shaps and start
[1:00:01] selling water and start selling prayer
[1:00:05] you know like I shared with you one time
[1:00:07] I was driving somewhere and I saw the
[1:00:09] church put a billbo or prayer for free
[1:00:11] I've wonder when was prayer sale on
[1:00:15] sale
[1:00:16] amen they had prayer for
[1:00:19] free I drove I turned around I came back
[1:00:23] I said let me make sure that I see this
[1:00:26] prayer for free when was it on
[1:00:29] sale praise the
[1:00:31] Lord and uh uh so uh uh that that that
[1:00:37] concept you know will make people to
[1:00:40] think that well I mean this is the law
[1:00:43] saying by of me what what wrong should
[1:00:45] it be and and I will tell you thatth the
[1:00:48] the early church the Catholic Church
[1:00:50] Reign on most of these things that's how
[1:00:52] they soow uh Indulgence in many things
[1:00:55] to people
[1:00:56] because of this but one thing we have to
[1:00:59] understand that uh most of our truth
[1:01:03] meaning of the word was Lost in
[1:01:06] Translation and that's the reason why
[1:01:08] the Holy Ghost have to return back to
[1:01:10] the church amen and God has to send us a
[1:01:15] prophetic Ministry to be able to bring
[1:01:18] us truth
[1:01:20] understanding amen truth understanding
[1:01:24] or SSE I mean and we will we will we
[1:01:27] will we will not appreciate what God has
[1:01:29] given to us amen yeah we will not
[1:01:34] appreciate what God has given to us
[1:01:35] because if we were to buy from God think
[1:01:39] about buying pardon and think about
[1:01:41] buying Mercy do you realize that in the
[1:01:43] early church uh uh seats in the church
[1:01:47] was on
[1:01:49] price the poor people did not have seat
[1:01:52] in the church they either stay to the
[1:01:54] back so whether the man was in church or
[1:01:56] that this was his seat this was his
[1:01:59] family bench they pay for it uh uh every
[1:02:02] month it was Josh Miller uh uh one of
[1:02:04] Revival is that rebuke they out of the
[1:02:06] Church of
[1:02:09] England praise the Lord the wealthy had
[1:02:13] their seats they pay for it every
[1:02:19] month even though we don't pay for it
[1:02:22] year but I don't think we must have
[1:02:23] particular seats amen if you come here
[1:02:25] tell you love a favor place to sit sit
[1:02:28] there but if someone is sitting there
[1:02:29] then find another place to
[1:02:32] sit love the
[1:02:34] Lord amen so I mean there was lot of
[1:02:37] things that were lost in translation I'm
[1:02:41] telling you if if if we never had the
[1:02:43] word restored if God never started doing
[1:02:46] the work from Luther and bring wesle
[1:02:50] with sanctification and restore the
[1:02:52] gifts for us to be here where uh uh uh
[1:02:56] uh the Divine interpretation has come to
[1:02:59] the
[1:03:00] word I mean uh we all will be worshiping
[1:03:04] one Idol or
[1:03:06] another because there are a lot of
[1:03:08] things that are lost lot of things that
[1:03:10] are
[1:03:11] lost amen a lot of things that are lost
[1:03:15] and what the church did over the years
[1:03:19] is to make you to feel that you have to
[1:03:22] earn your salvation you can't earn it
[1:03:26] you can earn
[1:03:29] it and you see when brother Bram says
[1:03:31] the the M the Bible became a new book we
[1:03:34] not changing the word what makes it new
[1:03:37] is because Divine interpretation has
[1:03:40] come toon understand to help us to
[1:03:43] understand what is written in the in the
[1:03:46] pages of the
[1:03:49] word we say that salvation is individual
[1:03:52] Affair who is the individual are you the
[1:03:54] individual it say your Affair when did
[1:03:57] it begin your
[1:03:59] Affair he is the individual it is his
[1:04:03] affair it's not your Affair when did it
[1:04:06] became your Affair the day you join the
[1:04:10] church then when you decide not to serve
[1:04:12] God is not your Affair
[1:04:14] anymore it was never your Affair in the
[1:04:20] beginning and a lot of those things just
[1:04:23] you know they just so so you you we we
[1:04:25] you we we find ourself keep keep working
[1:04:27] and keep trying to do something instead
[1:04:30] of appreciating and embracing what God
[1:04:33] has given to
[1:04:38] us and when we fail we don't blame the
[1:04:42] word we say Lord I know I have a fallen
[1:04:44] nature but your word make a promise that
[1:04:46] I can overcome this and I take what your
[1:04:49] word says then to rely on my
[1:04:54] ability because whatever you are relying
[1:04:57] on your ability for is going to fail and
[1:05:00] God will make you miserably fail until
[1:05:04] you realize that you need his
[1:05:09] grace praise the Lord so so when you
[1:05:13] look at this word by of
[1:05:16] me the word actually carry the sense of
[1:05:23] exchange exchange Jesus used that word
[1:05:27] what will you give in exchange for your
[1:05:31] soul because that was the principle of
[1:05:34] buying in the beginning the battle
[1:05:37] system was
[1:05:39] exchange there was no money I bring this
[1:05:42] I I want to I want this glasses and the
[1:05:44] only way I can get it I give you a goat
[1:05:47] or I give you uh H
[1:05:50] something they equal the value of this
[1:05:54] so what we do is that we
[1:06:00] exchange so that is the
[1:06:02] sense that the word is so God is saying
[1:06:06] to loudish your age you think you are
[1:06:09] rich you think uh you you you need
[1:06:12] nothing but let me tell you if you can
[1:06:15] just exchange your miserably
[1:06:19] condition if you can exchange your
[1:06:21] miserably condition and let me give you
[1:06:24] character
[1:06:29] so every service we come to that's what
[1:06:31] the Holy Ghost is doing he want you to
[1:06:34] give up something in your life and take
[1:06:37] something from the
[1:06:42] word that's the father's business he's a
[1:06:46] businessman every time we come the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost comes around he want you to give
[1:06:52] up
[1:06:53] something and take something in
[1:06:57] return praise the Lord if you remember
[1:07:00] we spoke a long time ago I don't know
[1:07:03] how long it was but um on the seller of
[1:07:06] oil Jesus in the parable of the 10
[1:07:09] virgin he says go to those men they say
[1:07:11] oil go and buy of them so that's the
[1:07:14] same
[1:07:16] principle praise the Lord that is the
[1:07:18] same principle because you will realize
[1:07:21] that in
[1:07:23] the in the in in the book of Acts Peter
[1:07:27] had to rebuke that man that wanted to
[1:07:29] buy Power and he think that he could
[1:07:32] give the Apostle some money for him to
[1:07:34] be able to buy Power and
[1:07:36] join the the
[1:07:39] the the the church but Peter told him
[1:07:43] perish with your money amen you perish
[1:07:48] with your money
[1:07:57] so if the Holy Ghost is a type if the
[1:08:01] Holy Ghost is a type of oil then what
[1:08:04] will happen is that uh uh uh you can you
[1:08:08] can you can sell you can sell it in the
[1:08:10] sense of the way we understand the word
[1:08:14] sell no you can sell
[1:08:17] it but yes it's sold it's sold in the
[1:08:21] sense that because before God gave us
[1:08:24] the Holy Ghost what he put on the table
[1:08:27] to exchange repent be baptized in the
[1:08:30] name of the Lord
[1:08:31] Jesus that's what he put on the table
[1:08:34] that's the price he put on
[1:08:38] it praise the
[1:08:42] Lord so do you have the sense so the
[1:08:45] word thereby of mean has the sense of
[1:08:49] exchange or give in exchange
[1:08:56] praise the
[1:08:59] Lord you see and that's the reason why
[1:09:02] the church keep
[1:09:03] feeling All Through the Ages because uh
[1:09:07] uh H H I mean uh uh we we just want to
[1:09:09] go through some sensation we just want
[1:09:11] to go through emotion and work ourself
[1:09:14] up and we not ready to give up we are
[1:09:17] not ready to give up that old nature
[1:09:20] that old desire
[1:09:25] we don't we are not ready for I mean uh
[1:09:28] H uh the human the human nature is not
[1:09:30] ready for
[1:09:32] change God by his grace have to do
[1:09:35] something
[1:09:37] special praise the Lord
[1:09:41] amen we want
[1:09:43] change but we really don't want
[1:09:46] change we want change but we really
[1:09:49] don't want to be
[1:09:53] changed so that's the word and and
[1:09:55] that's why we going to we going to labor
[1:09:58] on this morning B of me God so I'm going
[1:10:01] to talk on the Redemption money Numbers
[1:10:04] Chapter
[1:10:05] 3 numbers chapter 3 there is this thing
[1:10:08] that the Lord told
[1:10:11] Moses and you'll realize there
[1:10:14] a in the first place brother W was not
[1:10:16] making this up in scriptural there is
[1:10:19] something called the Redemption
[1:10:21] money praise the
[1:10:24] Lord now Pras chapter 3 let's read from
[1:10:27] verse 14 if you read with me and the
[1:10:29] Lord said unto Moses number all the
[1:10:32] firstborn of the male of the children of
[1:10:35] Israel from a month or upward and take
[1:10:38] the number of their names and thou shal
[1:10:41] take the Levites for me I am the Lord
[1:10:44] instead of the firstborn among the
[1:10:47] children of Israel the kles of the
[1:10:49] Levites in still of all the the the
[1:10:52] firstling among the cattles of the
[1:10:54] children of is Moses number as the Lord
[1:10:57] commanded him all the firstborn among
[1:11:00] the children of Israel and all the
[1:11:02] firstborn male by the number of names
[1:11:06] from a month old and
[1:11:09] upward of those that were number of them
[1:11:13] were 20 and
[1:11:15] 2,000 20 and
[1:11:18] 2,200 and three scores and 13 and the
[1:11:23] Lord speak unto Moses take the Le VI
[1:11:25] instead of the firstborn J changed also
[1:11:29] so uh uh when God brought the people out
[1:11:32] of the land of Egypt he says all the
[1:11:34] firstborn are mine I'm going to kill all
[1:11:38] the firstborn of the Egyptians and you
[1:11:41] Jews all your firstborn are mine praise
[1:11:45] the Lord are we together are we together
[1:11:49] amen now so as the people traveled and
[1:11:52] God was settling down with them and
[1:11:55] trying to to build his ordinance around
[1:11:58] then he called the prophet Moses he says
[1:12:00] I've I've told I've said to you that all
[1:12:02] the firstborn were mine but now we going
[1:12:05] to do something here what we going to do
[1:12:07] is that you will take all the firstborn
[1:12:10] all the firstborn of the House of Israel
[1:12:15] and you're going to take all the first
[1:12:17] born of the sons of
[1:12:20] Levites and you're going to exchange
[1:12:23] every firstborn with a son of
[1:12:27] Levi are we together amen so a battle
[1:12:31] system was going on here God was
[1:12:34] exchanging the firstborn of Israel for a
[1:12:38] son of levite because now he's going to
[1:12:41] take the Levites onto himself for his
[1:12:45] service the going to self in the
[1:12:47] Tabernacle only the sons of Aaron were
[1:12:50] the high priest that could go behind the
[1:12:53] curtains but the other ones that were
[1:12:55] born as levit they had different work to
[1:12:58] do they take care of the Tabernacle some
[1:13:00] will put the Tabernacle up some will
[1:13:02] take it down because the people were
[1:13:04] traveling so God is telling Moses here
[1:13:07] now you're going to exchange every first
[1:13:10] born for a son of
[1:13:12] Levi are we together are you seeing the
[1:13:16] picture praise the
[1:13:18] Lord amen take the levite inste verse 45
[1:13:23] and all the firstborn among the children
[1:13:25] of Israel and the cattles of the levite
[1:13:27] in still all their their CES and the
[1:13:30] Levites shall be mine I am the Lord and
[1:13:35] for those that are to be
[1:13:38] redeemed of the
[1:13:40] 23 scoes and 13 13 of the firstborn of
[1:13:45] the children of Israel which are more
[1:13:49] than the Levites so all the firstborn
[1:13:52] were more than the sons of Levi are we
[1:13:56] together so after you swipe you swipe
[1:13:59] you Swip all the sons of Levi will go
[1:14:02] and there will still be
[1:14:04] more first born what do we do with
[1:14:09] them God is claiming his right he said
[1:14:12] all of these are mine are we together
[1:14:15] now so we go ahead and the Bible says
[1:14:18] here verse 47 thus shall e thou shall
[1:14:23] even take five shakers a pieace by the
[1:14:27] pool after the Shakers of the sanctuary
[1:14:30] shall thou take them a sh is sted G and
[1:14:36] thou shall gave the money where W the OD
[1:14:41] number of them is to be redeemed unto
[1:14:45] Aaron and his sons and Moses took the
[1:14:52] what what are you talking on your
[1:14:56] breath praise the Lord and Moses took
[1:15:00] what he took their Redemption
[1:15:06] money so the Redemption money now will
[1:15:09] be the money that is paid for all of
[1:15:13] these other first born that were
[1:15:19] left there is a Redemption money that
[1:15:21] will be paid this will build a concept
[1:15:26] in the ordinance of Israel that we will
[1:15:30] understand are we
[1:15:33] together you love the Lord are we ready
[1:15:36] for the word praise the
[1:15:39] Lord
[1:15:42] amen you know uh H uh the word of God
[1:15:46] the the message of the hour is not is
[1:15:49] not real you know I mean we appreciate
[1:15:51] when the Lord bring things to us we
[1:15:53] learn you you know but I mean uh uh uh
[1:15:57] it's really not for learning it's for us
[1:15:59] to experience
[1:16:01] God Amen is for us to experience God if
[1:16:05] we stay with all of the knowledge and
[1:16:08] don't experience God in the Forgiveness
[1:16:10] of our sin in the Deliverance of from
[1:16:13] our habits in the healing of our body if
[1:16:17] we don't experience God all we have is
[1:16:20] in in
[1:16:22] spirit there are two spirits that what
[1:16:25] against the church one is a seducing
[1:16:27] Spirit which is an evil spirit to carry
[1:16:30] the people into immorality the next one
[1:16:33] is an enticing spirit that stop you from
[1:16:36] going to the promise it only leave you
[1:16:38] with ha
[1:16:40] knowledge you can never experience the
[1:16:42] word of God in your life it's only for
[1:16:45] those in the Bible it's for time pass it
[1:16:48] cannot happen now that's an ining Spirit
[1:16:52] he's robbing you of the blessing so the
[1:16:54] word is not only for learning the word
[1:16:57] is for us to experience
[1:17:03] it that's why Paul says if my preaching
[1:17:06] is not by the demonstration of the Holy
[1:17:08] Ghost then I'm only preaching to you
[1:17:10] inticing Spirit by men's
[1:17:14] wisdom praise the lord it's all these
[1:17:17] enticing spirit that can make people to
[1:17:19] cut the prophet and they can tell you
[1:17:21] about the godhead but yet they don't
[1:17:25] have no ground for their
[1:17:27] temper praise the Lord and with all the
[1:17:30] knowledge of the word they are stay
[1:17:33] swimming in
[1:17:36] immorality that's why Paul says you are
[1:17:38] denying the power
[1:17:42] thereof because this word has power it
[1:17:46] has power to heal it has power to
[1:17:50] deliver it has
[1:17:52] power to give us a DE decent
[1:17:55] life to restore
[1:18:08] decency so we see here God is is uh is
[1:18:12] instituting something here and Moses
[1:18:14] took the Redemption money of them that
[1:18:17] were over and above them there were
[1:18:19] Redeemed by the Levites of the firstborn
[1:18:22] of the children of Israel took took he
[1:18:25] the money
[1:18:27] 1,300 3 and3 scores and 50 sheers after
[1:18:31] the sheers of the centuary and Moses
[1:18:34] gave gave the money of them that were
[1:18:37] redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons I
[1:18:40] calling to the word of the Lord as the
[1:18:42] Lord God commanded do you do you realize
[1:18:45] that the early church when the Roman
[1:18:47] system took over the Christian Church
[1:18:49] they RAR all of these
[1:18:51] things amen praise the Lord
[1:18:55] and that's the reason why families were
[1:18:57] charged the the the wealth of family was
[1:19:00] taken from
[1:19:03] them the church Target people that was
[1:19:06] wealthy when they knew they had wealth
[1:19:08] the priest found a way to convince the
[1:19:10] father how their young daughter can be a
[1:19:13] none she can she can give her life to
[1:19:15] the service of the Lord they really
[1:19:16] never wanted to girl they wanted the
[1:19:19] riches that's
[1:19:22] right praise the Lord and these are the
[1:19:24] kind of a scripture that they were
[1:19:26] pointing to
[1:19:33] them are we together but we going to
[1:19:36] look at it yet and uh and and trust that
[1:19:38] the Lord will be able to help us praise
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] Lord
[1:19:45] hallelujah amen you love the Lord amen
[1:19:49] the Lord been so good to us he's been so
[1:19:53] good to us
[1:19:55] what an awesome God we
[1:19:58] serve praise the
[1:20:00] Lord
[1:20:02] hallelujah now so this was instituted in
[1:20:05] Israel so this particular ordinance this
[1:20:10] particular
[1:20:14] ordinance will make us to understand
[1:20:18] something that I believe was long
[1:20:22] misunderstood
[1:20:25] in the Bible praise the Lord now the
[1:20:29] Bible called it the Redemption money the
[1:20:32] reason why the Bible call it the
[1:20:34] Redemption money is because in God
[1:20:38] Redemption
[1:20:39] plan he had a medium of
[1:20:44] exchange praise the Lord in God
[1:20:47] Redemption
[1:20:49] plane oh I see the the newborn in church
[1:20:55] that's a little baby back there okay
[1:20:58] she's sleeping we greet her greet the
[1:21:00] sister for
[1:21:01] me praise the
[1:21:03] Lord and uh uh uh uh so we we we see
[1:21:08] here that uh uh
[1:21:12] um in his Redemption
[1:21:16] plan he had a medium now remember now he
[1:21:21] had this plan before the foundation of
[1:21:23] the word
[1:21:25] praise the
[1:21:26] Lord and in his great
[1:21:29] mind he saw how am I going to redeem the
[1:21:33] Earth how am I going to redeem men and
[1:21:35] all of that he planted so he had a
[1:21:38] medium of exchange he has something that
[1:21:41] he would give and he would take
[1:21:44] everything
[1:21:46] back praise the Lord there is only one
[1:21:49] mediator between man and God that's the
[1:21:52] man Christ Jesus so that was God medium
[1:21:56] of exchange his medium of exchange that
[1:21:59] he will become man he will identify with
[1:22:03] our
[1:22:04] misery and then he will bring us out of
[1:22:08] it are we together so you see the
[1:22:11] Redemption money all of these things God
[1:22:14] was casting it inside us because the
[1:22:18] mind of God is so
[1:22:20] deep I know the thoughts that I think
[1:22:24] concerning you praise the Lord don't
[1:22:27] even guess because you will not come
[1:22:31] close When God says I know the thoughts
[1:22:34] that I think about you don't guess just
[1:22:37] believe it because you will not even
[1:22:39] come
[1:22:44] close Hallelujah so in his Redemption
[1:22:48] plan he had a medium of
[1:22:52] exchange so God is going to play this
[1:22:56] medium of
[1:22:57] exchange through different types and
[1:23:01] shadows amen he's going to use different
[1:23:05] example to play out the medium of
[1:23:10] exchange so that's one year the
[1:23:13] Redemption
[1:23:15] money you realize how this is done let
[1:23:18] me let let me bring this to
[1:23:20] you look at the case
[1:23:25] of Jeff in the
[1:23:28] Bible Judges chapter
[1:23:31] 11 praise the Lord amen the Bible says
[1:23:35] jeffa made a vow to the
[1:23:37] Lord and he said Lord if you give me the
[1:23:40] battle the first thing that will come
[1:23:42] out of my house I will sacrifice it to
[1:23:46] you praise the
[1:23:48] Lord not knowing th will be his only
[1:23:52] beloved daughter
[1:23:55] are we
[1:23:57] together
[1:23:59] amen you see before we even came here
[1:24:03] before you made your mistakes God
[1:24:06] already made a provision for your
[1:24:09] mistakes he knew your ignorance he knew
[1:24:13] how stupid I am so he made a
[1:24:19] provision are we
[1:24:22] together here is this man that was
[1:24:24] rejected by his brothers because he was
[1:24:27] born of a gentile woman you see how God
[1:24:31] had a gentile in mind Jeffy had a
[1:24:34] gentile mother and because of that he
[1:24:36] was rejected by his brothers and now
[1:24:39] they were in trouble and they came to J
[1:24:42] out of desperation out of
[1:24:46] desperation after being re rejected you
[1:24:49] see how rejection can affect people that
[1:24:53] sometimes in the future we make decision
[1:24:56] from the effect of rejection not even
[1:25:02] thinking he says the first thing that
[1:25:05] will come out of my house I will give it
[1:25:07] to you and if you give me this this
[1:25:12] battle and when he returned from the
[1:25:14] battle it was his only
[1:25:17] daughter only daughter only
[1:25:23] daughter praise the
[1:25:25] Lord and the Bible will lay out some
[1:25:29] things if you want to turn turn turn

[1:25:35] here praise the
[1:25:37] Lord are we

[1:25:45] little

[1:27:17] and and and
[1:27:19] everything and D on Mount moras almighty
[1:27:25] God will come down and give Abraham an
[1:27:31] exchange praise the
[1:27:33] Lord when Abraham live for his hands God
[1:27:37] says don't do it
[1:27:40] Abraham look behind you I give you an
[1:27:45] exchange you see so in God's Plan of
[1:27:49] Redemption God was not going to take any
[1:27:53] man
[1:27:54] born in
[1:27:56] sin he won't take any life born in
[1:28:01] sin he commanded Abraham and he never
[1:28:04] took
[1:28:07] Isaac he make an exchange he gave a ram
[1:28:11] now you tell me now how will God take
[1:28:14] this young
[1:28:17] woman when you read the Scripture it
[1:28:20] looks like it it appears
[1:28:23] like Jeffy killed his daughter to honor
[1:28:26] his promise to
[1:28:28] God that's how it appears
[1:28:31] like praise the
[1:28:34] Lord are we
[1:28:37] together but if thou was so it will
[1:28:41] break Revelation chapter
[1:28:44] 5 because Revelation chapter 5 says
[1:28:47] there was no man
[1:28:50] worthy that word no man means no human
[1:28:57] are we together so which mean it will
[1:29:00] break Revelation chapter 5 but let's go
[1:29:03] down a little bit and you will
[1:29:05] appreciate the word
[1:29:15] amen so the Bible says his only daughter
[1:29:19] came out beside
[1:29:21] herself he had nether son no daughter
[1:29:25] she was the only the Bible put that
[1:29:28] there
[1:29:30] meanly oh man I just feel like closing
[1:29:32] this Bible and preach oh God send the
[1:29:34] spirit of preaching on me this morning
[1:29:37] send the spirit of preaching on me this
[1:29:38] morning because I can tell you there the
[1:29:42] jeti daughter represent a bride in this
[1:29:45] age because the time of the judges is a
[1:29:49] good description of loudish age where
[1:29:52] every man is doing what what is Right In
[1:29:54] Their Eyes there is no Prophet on the
[1:29:57] land we just get a bunch of false
[1:29:59] prophet that are raising up every word
[1:30:02] praise the Lord and every man is doing
[1:30:04] what is right in the eyes and here is
[1:30:06] God is going to raise up a man that
[1:30:10] is from a gentile
[1:30:14] mother praise the
[1:30:17] Lord to show that in a time of chaos God
[1:30:21] is going to have a gentle brother
[1:30:25] he's going to have a a virgin Gentile
[1:30:28] bride that will say the same thing that
[1:30:30] Mary said listen to this young woman she
[1:30:34] said Let It Be unto me as you have vowed
[1:30:37] unto
[1:30:41] God if that's why you told the Lord then
[1:30:44] let it be unto
[1:30:48] me praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:30:51] no matter how polluted the age gets how
[1:30:54] corrupt his girl God will still have a
[1:30:57] bride amen God will still have young
[1:31:00] women that will keeps to the word of God
[1:31:03] he will have young men that will respect
[1:31:05] the word of God and keep them themselves
[1:31:07] to the word of
[1:31:09] God the age might be
[1:31:12] adulterous but God will always have a
[1:31:18] witness praise the
[1:31:21] Lord he will still have people that I
[1:31:24] will honor their
[1:31:25] body for his name
[1:31:28] sake praise the Lord are we together but
[1:31:32] follow me a little bit let enjoy the
[1:31:36] beauty of the
[1:31:37] word I love
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:42] amen I love
[1:31:45] it and she said in verse 36 and she said
[1:31:49] unto him my father if thou H has opened
[1:31:52] thy mouth unto the Lord do to me
[1:31:55] according to that which which have
[1:31:58] proceeded out of thy mouth for as much
[1:32:02] as the Lord has taken Vengeance for thee
[1:32:05] over the enemy even the children of Amon
[1:32:08] and she said unto her father let this
[1:32:11] thing be done for me just give me one
[1:32:15] thing let me
[1:32:17] alone two months I iemp to believe
[1:32:21] that's where you got your brother shower
[1:32:23] from I don't know but I turn to believe
[1:32:26] praise the
[1:32:27] Lord that I may go up upon the mountain
[1:32:31] and be well my virginity I am my fellow
[1:32:34] me and my friends will spend some time
[1:32:36] there you know and then we will just and
[1:32:39] the Bible says
[1:32:49] uh glory be to God
[1:32:55] took a c drop that is irritating my
[1:33:10] throat and he said go and and and and
[1:33:14] send and send her away for two months
[1:33:16] and she and her company to be well upon
[1:33:19] the mountain and it came to pass at the
[1:33:21] end of the at the end of two
[1:33:24] that she returned unto her father who
[1:33:27] did with her according to his
[1:33:30] vow which he have vowed and and she knew
[1:33:35] no man and it was a custom in
[1:33:41] Israel that the daughters of Israel went
[1:33:44] yearly to
[1:33:47] lament praise the Lord now if you look
[1:33:52] at this word
[1:33:54] let me travel with you a little
[1:33:58] bit praise the Lord that word
[1:34:01] lament means to
[1:34:04] rehearse and tell
[1:34:07] again they gathered together it became a
[1:34:10] custom where they gathered together they
[1:34:13] rehearsed the story it almost like the
[1:34:16] Feast of Paran when that time of the
[1:34:19] year reaches they read the book of
[1:34:22] Esther
[1:34:23] and everybody stand to their feet and
[1:34:26] every time the priest will call the name
[1:34:29] of Hammet the Jews will knock their feet
[1:34:31] on the ground it became a custom praise
[1:34:35] the Lord this became a custom unto them
[1:34:39] at that time of the year they gather and
[1:34:41] they tell the
[1:34:43] story now it's easier to go with the
[1:34:47] mind and and and think that they gather
[1:34:50] and they just cry they cry for this girl
[1:34:52] whatever her name was was and they just
[1:34:55] cried and they just cried but you see it
[1:34:58] would break the continuity of the
[1:35:00] word is going to affect Revelation
[1:35:04] chapter 5 because there was no man
[1:35:06] woring and you see and that's the reason
[1:35:09] why God was against the hidden for
[1:35:12] putting their children in the fire for
[1:35:15] sacrificing their children their virgin
[1:35:17] children to the fire why will he take a
[1:35:19] virgin G
[1:35:21] why now you see that parties of the
[1:35:24] Redemption
[1:35:31] money praise the Lord that's when the
[1:35:34] Redemption money comes into
[1:35:38] play a person makes a vow that is bigger
[1:35:42] than
[1:35:44] them so then you go to the
[1:35:46] priest you go to the
[1:35:50] temple praise the Lord
[1:35:54] because this will be sacrificing an
[1:35:57] innocent life to God if God will not
[1:36:00] take the life of Isaac that he called
[1:36:03] Abraham and said give me your only son
[1:36:06] if he would not take the life of Isaac
[1:36:08] why would he take this
[1:36:10] one why would this one matter to God
[1:36:25] glory be to
[1:36:27] God now you can do with it whatever you
[1:36:30] want that's not my message
[1:36:32] amen the reason why I'm bringing it like
[1:36:36] this is to help us to
[1:36:39] appreciate what God has given to
[1:36:42] us praise the
[1:36:45] Lord amen the interpretation of the word
[1:36:49] with Divine Vindication not only
[1:36:52] interpretation though
[1:36:54] but with Divine Vindication God in this
[1:36:57] state has come behind his word to back
[1:37:00] it
[1:37:06] up are we
[1:37:09] together now
[1:37:15] so take for example the daughters of
[1:37:19] zapi the Lord of Israel was that uh uh
[1:37:23] the the the the the inheritance of the
[1:37:25] father will only be given to the sons
[1:37:28] and he did not have
[1:37:30] sons praise the
[1:37:32] Lord but when that matter arrived see
[1:37:36] the beauty of the Bible that was the
[1:37:39] last judgment that Moses made before he
[1:37:42] left them why if Moses would have
[1:37:48] left the people will not know what to do
[1:37:51] they will follow what God told them
[1:37:54] you people are G you can never take the
[1:37:56] inheritance of your father but this will
[1:37:58] be the last judgment the last matter
[1:38:01] that Moses will sit down with the
[1:38:03] children of Israel and judge among them
[1:38:06] that it is truth if he had no Sons Let
[1:38:09] The Inheritance be given to the
[1:38:11] daughters but they can only marry a man
[1:38:14] in their tribe that the inheritance will
[1:38:17] not move to another
[1:38:20] tribe because they must not cross
[1:38:22] inheritance by
[1:38:25] we're not preaching tribal marriage here
[1:38:27] amen that's not what we are
[1:38:29] saying but we are trying to show the
[1:38:32] importance of God's word so you see God
[1:38:35] made a
[1:38:37] provision because they never had a
[1:38:39] provision for
[1:38:42] it but yeah he made a provision and from
[1:38:46] that day on do you know what it was you
[1:38:48] know what those girls went through four
[1:38:50] daughters you know what they went
[1:38:52] through to defy the ERS and bring the
[1:38:55] matter to Moses I believe they went to
[1:38:58] talk to their Uncle oh you gu you gu
[1:39:01] from
[1:39:02] here praise the Lord but they were so
[1:39:05] concern concerned they were so burden
[1:39:09] that our father was
[1:39:12] faithful the man that stood against
[1:39:14] Moses he was not counted among
[1:39:19] them if he does not have an inheritance
[1:39:22] he will not have a name in
[1:39:26] Israel and
[1:39:28] God God that saw the
[1:39:31] need he kept the
[1:39:34] prophet for that need to be rightly
[1:39:40] judged praise the Lord God saw the
[1:39:45] ignorance of Jeff time he knew and
[1:39:49] that's the reason why he made provision
[1:39:52] for a Redemption money
[1:39:56] praise the
[1:39:58] Lord you go through what it is is that
[1:40:01] you go through all all the rights all
[1:40:04] the ritual that's what they were playing
[1:40:06] out here in the book of Georges she had
[1:40:08] to do everything she go she did
[1:40:09] everything so to what the way the Lord
[1:40:13] describ it is that as concerning the
[1:40:16] ordinance she was dead it does not mean
[1:40:20] that she literally died
[1:40:23] praise the Lord the same thing to
[1:40:26] Abraham as concerning Isaac Abraham was
[1:40:30] there I mean as concerning Isaac Isaac
[1:40:33] was dead to
[1:40:35] Abraham but literally he did not
[1:40:38] die do you see that praise the Lord as
[1:40:42] concerning the Lord you will go through
[1:40:45] all the rights and everything that you
[1:40:46] have to do they will do this they would
[1:40:48] do that they would do that because it's
[1:40:50] your vow
[1:40:55] are we
[1:40:56] together well like I said do with it
[1:40:59] whatever you want to do let me preach
[1:41:01] this morning amen I see a lot of you
[1:41:03] holding me on there please don't hold me
[1:41:05] on
[1:41:07] it glory be to God don't hold me on it
[1:41:10] this morning
[1:41:13] hallelujah amen but is god making
[1:41:17] provision for you knowing that you will
[1:41:20] fail knowing that you will mess up he go
[1:41:23] the exra mind he looked beyond our needs
[1:41:27] he look beyond our thought and he
[1:41:30] provide everything that we
[1:41:34] need praise the Lord how can we come out
[1:41:38] if you look in the face of God's
[1:41:40] provider word and you reject his
[1:41:43] provision that's what brother B was
[1:41:45] saying in the message pdon this
[1:41:48] morning a pardon was
[1:41:51] offer WR on a piece of of
[1:41:53] sheet this guy did everything to track
[1:41:56] Abraham Lincoln down to get a p for his
[1:42:00] friend the pum was
[1:42:02] given he took
[1:42:04] it but the man did not appreciate it he
[1:42:09] did not value the pardon because it
[1:42:12] never came the way he wanted
[1:42:15] it praise the
[1:42:17] Lord you can only expect things the way
[1:42:20] you want it when you make your God
[1:42:24] but the one that make you will give you
[1:42:26] things the way he
[1:42:30] wanted praise the Lord he will give you
[1:42:33] things the way he
[1:42:36] wanted Hallelujah and he build character
[1:42:40] in you after you shake your head no
[1:42:43] you'll come by and say
[1:42:48] yes you love the Lord let's give him a
[1:42:51] hand of praise
[1:42:56] hallelujah praise the
[1:43:00] Lord
[1:43:03] amen glory be to
[1:43:08] God as concerning Isaac he was
[1:43:12] dead the Bible says Abraham received him
[1:43:17] as what one from from the dead
[1:43:24] according to Abraham God don't play with
[1:43:26] his
[1:43:29] word so for God to give me this boy back
[1:43:32] means that he died and he
[1:43:42] resurrected oh you love the
[1:43:45] Lord you know I keept thinking about
[1:43:48] this it keeps blowing my mind you know
[1:43:50] Redemption Redemption just
[1:43:54] beginning to get sweet all the time when
[1:43:57] you think about it it just beginning to
[1:44:00] get sweet all the
[1:44:03] time let's go telling the people an
[1:44:06] unconverted people a people that been
[1:44:09] complaining and
[1:44:11] misbehaving then he tells them love the
[1:44:14] Lord with all of your
[1:44:20] heart how how how can we
[1:44:24] how can
[1:44:26] we the reason that is that many of the
[1:44:28] time we take God's word as a commandment
[1:44:32] as a
[1:44:34] requirement but in most cases God is
[1:44:37] telling you what he's going to
[1:44:39] do I'm going to make you to love me with
[1:44:42] your
[1:44:46] heart
[1:44:49] amen that brother bam says that's the
[1:44:51] Deep call it to the Deep
[1:44:53] if God says water from The Rock he put
[1:44:55] water in the Rock to get water
[1:45:01] out so when he says love the Lord with
[1:45:04] all of your heart praise the Lord
[1:45:08] there's a James seed that he dropped
[1:45:11] down in your heart that as you as you
[1:45:14] beginning to hear the word of God it
[1:45:16] will gravitate to the word and then you
[1:45:19] will start loving God when he said love
[1:45:22] the Lord with out of your mind he's able
[1:45:24] to bring your mind on obedience from
[1:45:27] every
[1:45:34] ftiness he's not requiring it from you
[1:45:37] because he knows that by yourself you
[1:45:39] can never give it but when he speak it
[1:45:42] to your heart he's able to bring it out
[1:45:44] of your life that's the God we
[1:45:59] oh my let me take it a deep breath here
[1:46:02] as I read this I'm getting I'm lost in
[1:46:05] my breath
[1:46:07] amen you guys are pulling so
[1:46:15] hard think think thing on our ways
[1:46:18] listen to this tell me what kind of a
[1:46:20] price that you can put on eternal life
[1:46:24] if you are dying
[1:46:27] tonight with a100 billion dollar in your
[1:46:29] pocket it could not touch internal life
[1:46:33] you can buy it money is filthy in God's
[1:46:37] sight if it isn't used for his kingdom
[1:46:41] or to some good
[1:46:43] cost some will not be called to use it
[1:46:46] for his kyom but some donated for cancer
[1:46:49] research some donated for This research
[1:46:52] praise the Lord and because they do it
[1:46:55] that way God blesses
[1:46:59] it praise the Lord
[1:47:03] amen because what what is money a medium
[1:47:07] of
[1:47:08] exchange you must be able to get it or
[1:47:12] give to
[1:47:15] get are we
[1:47:19] together amen
[1:47:23] so morning is a filthy thing in the
[1:47:25] sight of God if it's if it isn't used
[1:47:28] for his kingdom or some good cause
[1:47:31] that's what our money and our greatness
[1:47:34] is before God we can buy it God is so
[1:47:39] good till he gave it to us without money
[1:47:42] or without
[1:47:44] price but yet suddenly we turn it
[1:47:49] down because we want to show our own
[1:47:54] achievement we without money and we
[1:47:57] without
[1:47:58] price are we
[1:48:01] together
[1:48:04] amen now see this I'm going to I'm going
[1:48:07] to use this to go into something a
[1:48:09] little bit yeah just to be
[1:48:11] able to speak to you as a church speak
[1:48:14] to you as a people encourage you and
[1:48:19] also you know just keep us on our guide
[1:48:22] L is to what what uh the prophet of God
[1:48:24] said yeah we got it we got it so easy
[1:48:27] who have believed our report we got it
[1:48:29] we we got it easy over
[1:48:32] here now he was making
[1:48:35] comparison he was making comparison of
[1:48:37] Other Nation he had just came from Other
[1:48:39] Nation he saw in places where people
[1:48:42] were still doing battle system you know
[1:48:44] they were giving this to get that and
[1:48:46] all of that so he just coming down here
[1:48:48] he says we got it so easy over year we
[1:48:52] are wellfed and clothed and have need of
[1:48:56] nothing is that that Revelation chapter
[1:48:58] 3 as we think
[1:49:01] brother they could teach us
[1:49:04] Christianity they have to pray and hold
[1:49:07] to God for everything they got now when
[1:49:10] brother
[1:49:13] Juma brother Juma James Jambo was
[1:49:16] preaching for us the brother from
[1:49:17] Zimbabwe if you remember he mentioned
[1:49:21] something as he just went you know they
[1:49:23] went through a time where you know
[1:49:25] people have to pray you know prayed over
[1:49:28] water and put it in their vehicle that's
[1:49:30] that was not a fairy tale that was not a
[1:49:33] fairy tale because it came to the point
[1:49:36] of time where the Zimbabwe money was
[1:49:40] useless you have to carry a a a a bucket
[1:49:44] full of money or a trunk full of money
[1:49:48] to just to go and get a loaf of bread to
[1:49:50] buy
[1:49:56] praise the Lord oh
[1:49:58] yeah because you
[1:50:00] see what makes the medium of
[1:50:05] exchange
[1:50:07] valuable is the standard that you have
[1:50:10] behind
[1:50:11] it the reason why we can count on the
[1:50:15] blood is because we have God behind his
[1:50:18] blood the reason why we can count on
[1:50:21] this word above everything and anything
[1:50:24] because God is behind his
[1:50:30] word if you don't have a good standard
[1:50:34] behind your medium of exchange it don't
[1:50:36] have no
[1:50:39] value it don't have no
[1:50:44] value that's the reason why the US
[1:50:48] money was backed by the gold standard
[1:50:53] they hide gold behind the money it makes
[1:50:57] that
[1:50:59] valuable but the Roman Church has taken
[1:51:02] all the
[1:51:05] gold but why make the US money still
[1:51:09] have value I'll share that with you
[1:51:11] because we are in critical
[1:51:13] time we are in critical
[1:51:16] time we have to preach the word of God
[1:51:18] to you not
[1:51:20] politics praise the Lord but we were Tau
[1:51:23] by the prophet that mody events are made
[1:51:26] clear by
[1:51:29] prophecy not by
[1:51:31] politics modern events are made
[1:51:34] clear by
[1:51:39] prophecy people are complaining on the
[1:51:42] economy and the think is one party or
[1:51:45] another follow me a little bit just

[1:57:21] this other place also
[1:57:24] amen and and don't think that we are
[1:57:28] trying to preach against I I believe
[1:57:31] that you know uh uh God has blessed us

[1:57:35] age and I believe that God can bless you
[1:57:39] he can give you job the right kind of a

[1:57:44] income praise the Lord I believe
[1:57:48] it glory be to God

[1:57:55] together
[1:57:59] so don't allow the devil to give you
[1:58:02] poor
[1:58:05] excuse and you wreck your own
[1:58:08] life thinking that I don't need
[1:58:11] money praise the
[1:58:14] Lord and we just run ourselves into
[1:58:17] depths and all of that that's not what
[1:58:18] I'm preaching here this morning that's
[1:58:21] not what I'm saying
[1:58:26] I'm saying that whatever God has given
[1:58:28] you trust him to keep
[1:58:32] it that's what I'm saying to you
[1:58:35] whatever he has given you and he has
[1:58:37] blessed you with trust him to keep it
[1:58:41] don't trust your certificate or your
[1:58:44] ability because it can go in a snap of a
[1:58:50] finger are we together
[1:58:52] so brother bam says money is just an
[1:58:55] exchange that's what it is it's just a
[1:58:58] medium of exchange just like the the
[1:59:00] Redemption money was it was just a
[1:59:02] medium of
[1:59:04] exchange now we go down a little bit
[1:59:07] yeah he gave us a history and he said he
[1:59:10] took this history from the facts of our
[1:59:12] faith that is the highest Catholic book
[1:59:15] that can be
[1:59:17] bought actually brother B will tell a
[1:59:20] story behind this book that Frank give
[1:59:22] it to him because you just came by it's
[1:59:24] very expensive it's it's on the elite
[1:59:26] book and he refused to give it to the
[1:59:28] guy back that's the story behind
[1:59:32] it he says and it
[1:59:35] said if there a Catholic on the ticket
[1:59:37] that's running against a Protestant if a
[1:59:40] Catholic vote for uh for that President
[1:59:43] they are excommunicated from The
[1:59:44] Fellowship of the Catholic church right
[1:59:47] if there is two Catholic running on the
[1:59:49] same office they will pick out of the
[1:59:52] Catholic uh there's more lawyer to the
[1:59:56] mother and then vote for them praise the
[1:59:59] Lord let's go ahead there a lot of
[2:00:01] things I could say but I will leave it
[2:00:02] let's go let's just stick with our talk
[2:00:05] this morning
[2:00:06] amen and see how that's deceit what they
[2:00:10] are trying to do give money away to buy
[2:00:14] what they are trying to break it they
[2:00:16] are doing it and she broke it what is it
[2:00:20] is it's on the goh step
[2:00:23] in the Catholic Church the Hier owns the
[2:00:27] gold of the
[2:00:29] word and uh uh $68
[2:00:33] million there you are throw her right
[2:00:36] back on the gold standard and you people
[2:00:40] just keep your homes and and things but
[2:00:44] you belong to the Catholic Church why
[2:00:48] because she have the go of this country
[2:00:52] just keep your homes that's what he
[2:00:56] said now he's preaching this thing back
[2:00:58] there in the
[2:01:00] sisters he's telling us these
[2:01:06] things I bring an interesting
[2:01:08] information to
[2:01:11] you he said just keep your homes and
[2:01:13] things but you belong to the Catholic
[2:01:15] Church the nation belong to the Catholic
[2:01:17] Church the whole thing is captured right
[2:01:20] in like that through through their
[2:01:24] currency because the money will not have
[2:01:26] a value unless it is H it has a standard
[2:01:30] if the enemy comes as a flood the spirit
[2:01:32] of the Lord will do what raise up a
[2:01:34] standard so you have a stand you need to
[2:01:36] have a standard that being raise up to
[2:01:39] back up your
[2:01:40] currency praise the Lord in Liberia we
[2:01:43] use a whole lot of American dollars
[2:01:46] because we don't have nothing to back
[2:01:48] our money
[2:01:49] up we have Liberian but the US dollar is
[2:01:53] what we use Zimbabwe they do the same
[2:01:56] and many other countries they do the
[2:01:59] same why because the US dollar still has
[2:02:03] something back in
[2:02:08] it are we
[2:02:15] together now the Bible says here brother
[2:02:18] and
[2:02:19] say through their currency don't you he
[2:02:22] says don't the Bible speaks of
[2:02:29] that I love ly my man is look I took one
[2:02:33] from my office say somewh I I got it
[2:02:35] from somewhere and it just giving me a
[2:02:38] little choke
[2:02:39] here praise the
[2:02:42] Lord we'll preach anyhow
[2:02:45] amen if I can talk I'll use my sound
[2:02:48] language I still have a little bit of it
[2:02:53] now you'll realize here that uh H H uh
[2:02:58] in the Book of Malachi you will hear
[2:03:00] from history that between Malachi and
[2:03:02] Matthew there was 400 years historian
[2:03:05] call it the the the years of
[2:03:09] Silence it's only called the year of
[2:03:11] Silence because people think there is
[2:03:15] nothing in history that tells us what
[2:03:17] happened but the Bible told us what
[2:03:20] happened in Daniel chapter 9 verse 25
[2:03:24] the Bible says from the
[2:03:26] rebuilding of the city to maiah the
[2:03:31] prince what time does it cover it
[2:03:33] covered the 400
[2:03:35] years because Mai was a prophet that
[2:03:38] came out of
[2:03:40] asiah so he came from the building of
[2:03:42] the temple to maiah the
[2:03:47] prince so when we think that there is no
[2:03:50] history that is living on a period of
[2:03:52] time the Bible tells us that let's look
[2:03:56] at a few of them the Book of
[2:04:00] Daniel glory be to God are we together
[2:04:05] am I boring
[2:04:06] you amen glory be to God
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] hallelujah you have to give to
[2:04:16] take that's all we are doing here that's
[2:04:19] what the gospel is all about is freely
[2:04:21] giv
[2:04:23] but you will not rightly receive it
[2:04:25] until you are willing to give up
[2:04:27] something
[2:04:33] also
[2:04:34] Daniel let's go to Daniel chapter
[2:04:40] n Daniel chapter
[2:04:48] 9 you know I'm a I'm not a good teacher
[2:04:51] so I I I really don't I I'm not able to
[2:04:54] organize myself to this I get too
[2:04:56] excited amen I get too excited so a real
[2:04:59] teacher will bring you down you know and
[2:05:02] bring you down break it down to you I'm
[2:05:03] not a teacher amen I just love the
[2:05:06] Lord
[2:05:08] hallelujah amen I just love the Lord I'm
[2:05:12] just your
[2:05:15] brother now so just like I said you read
[2:05:17] the 70 weeks you look through the 70
[2:05:20] weeks you will see that down the chapter
[2:05:22] 9: 25 know therefore and understand that
[2:05:25] from the going forth of the Commandment
[2:05:27] to restore and to build Jerusalem when
[2:05:30] was that from the time of
[2:05:32] cus from the time of cus to the time
[2:05:36] that Jesus will come that those years
[2:05:39] that seems to be like silent years God
[2:05:43] has already spoken about
[2:05:45] it praise the lord we also have a time
[2:05:50] when it seems like the the the the the
[2:05:54] the uh what will lead up to the the
[2:05:59] tribulation what will happen some of
[2:06:01] those things it looks like a silent but
[2:06:04] God already spoke about it you have to
[2:06:07] realize that Daniel was a Jewish Prophet
[2:06:10] that God Rose and gave visions and
[2:06:12] Revelation about things concerning their
[2:06:16] end are we together let's look a few of
[2:06:19] them
[2:06:21] but when when before we go down let's
[2:06:24] let's read this from the first seal it
[2:06:26] will build a picture here and then I
[2:06:27] will come back to
[2:06:29] Daniel and then you will understand it
[2:06:31] see what he says here and after the
[2:06:34] church is taken away the
[2:06:38] Rapture are you not
[2:06:40] glad
[2:06:42] amen that the worst of this is going to
[2:06:45] happen when you are taking
[2:06:47] away after the church is taking away
[2:06:53] Rome and the Jews will make a covenant
[2:06:56] with one another the Bible said they
[2:06:59] would we will find in the Bible where it
[2:07:01] said
[2:07:02] it with the holy people and not and and
[2:07:06] and I'll notice they were they will make
[2:07:08] it because this nation is going to be
[2:07:11] busted the rest of the word that's on
[2:07:14] the ghost Stander is busted and you know
[2:07:18] that if we are living off of taxes
[2:07:22] deal bails for 40 years from now he's
[2:07:26] he's talking this way back in there in
[2:07:28] 1963 where are we there is there is only
[2:07:32] one thing can
[2:07:34] happen that to call in the currencies
[2:07:36] and paid off the bounds and and we can't
[2:07:38] do
[2:07:39] that wall uh uh Wall Street owns them
[2:07:44] and Wall Street is controlled by the
[2:07:46] Jews now you see why the Jews and Rome
[2:07:49] will get into
[2:07:51] coveted because they own Wall
[2:07:54] Street praise the Lord amen oh
[2:08:00] yeah the whole New York is owned by
[2:08:05] them it's not a
[2:08:08] fil are we together so you see that's
[2:08:12] that's where they will come into a
[2:08:15] covenant because they are the strength
[2:08:18] behind the the businesses
[2:08:22] borrowing and all of that and Rome owes
[2:08:26] the
[2:08:28] god are we together follow me a little
[2:08:41] bit the rest the rest of it is is is in
[2:08:45] the Vatican and the Jews has got the
[2:08:47] rest of it in Wall Street
[2:08:51] with the commers of the
[2:08:55] word we can call it
[2:08:58] in Praise the Lord
[2:09:03] amen now what brother ban is saying here
[2:09:06] is that America cannot just change her
[2:09:09] money to save
[2:09:11] herself she can do it all of these big
[2:09:14] companies will not allow it Wall Street
[2:09:18] will not allow it many times do that to
[2:09:23] be able to save save their economy they
[2:09:25] change their money that's some of some
[2:09:28] of funny things I'm not I'm I'm just
[2:09:30] trying to bring things to you so so you
[2:09:33] can understand where we going this
[2:09:34] morning Amen Let me let me just read
[2:09:36] this quickly uh
[2:09:41] yeah and if and if they could do it this
[2:09:45] whiskey guys and all these tobacco
[2:09:47] people which billion times billions of
[2:09:49] dollars of the year and write off their
[2:09:53] income taxes for their vocal pictures
[2:09:56] and things and go out in harona there
[2:09:59] and buy millions of acres of land and
[2:10:01] thousands and and and you know and and
[2:10:04] the dig big Wells and all of the and uh
[2:10:08] uh now he's he's trying to make us to
[2:10:10] know that's the reason why they cannot
[2:10:12] do it because uh uh uh the government
[2:10:15] just don't have that power there are
[2:10:17] there are people that has they has the
[2:10:20] the Jud U your power and there are
[2:10:23] people that have the uh economical power
[2:10:26] are we together now look here now in in
[2:10:29] Daniel chapter 8 let's take uh uh Daniel
[2:10:32] chapter 8 few few verses
[2:10:35] there Daniel chapter 8 if you look at
[2:10:39] verse
[2:10:40] 22 Daniel chapter 8 you look at verse
[2:10:44] 22 if you if you go down and and you
[2:10:47] read back you will see here talking
[2:10:48] about the Grecian power but what you
[2:10:50] have to honor
[2:10:51] is that that image that Daniel saw that
[2:10:54] came from Babylon to Greece and down to
[2:10:56] Rome is the same spirit that is just
[2:11:00] changing Nations that they are ruling is
[2:11:03] the Same Spirit whatever Spirit was
[2:11:05] ruling in the head of God that's what
[2:11:07] was ruling in the breast of
[2:11:10] sa are we together now so so just just
[2:11:14] look here n and then you see here uh uh
[2:11:18] uh uh verse 22
[2:11:21] as I said
[2:11:22] now that being broken whereas four St up
[2:11:27] of it four kingdoms shall stand up out
[2:11:32] of the nation but not in his power and
[2:11:36] in the later times the the later times
[2:11:39] of the aom the later times the end
[2:11:43] times when trans when the transgressor I
[2:11:48] come to the fall just like the same
[2:11:50] thing the the sin of the
[2:11:53] amorites God was waiting for the sin of
[2:11:55] the amorites yeah Daniel is saying the
[2:12:00] the transgressor will come to their
[2:12:02] fold are we together are you seeing the
[2:12:05] picture because God cannot bring
[2:12:07] judgment on the people until the people
[2:12:10] are Reed for judgment are we together
[2:12:13] now when the transgressor I come to
[2:12:16] their four the kings of the first uh uh
[2:12:19] continents and the understanding that
[2:12:21] that sentence shall stand
[2:12:23] up this is what I want to get you and
[2:12:26] his power shall be Mighty but not by his
[2:12:31] own power and he shall destroy
[2:12:35] wonderfully and shall prosper and
[2:12:38] practice and shall destroy the mighty
[2:12:41] and the holy people and through his
[2:12:47] policy also he shall cause craft
[2:12:51] what is that
[2:12:55] Commerce
[2:12:58] Commerce so that's that's exactly what
[2:13:01] brother Bram is talking here it's is the
[2:13:03] power of
[2:13:05] Rome
[2:13:07] amen now because he has the gold the
[2:13:11] Jews has Wall Street they got to come
[2:13:13] together in a
[2:13:19] covenant let's read down a little bit
[2:13:21] bed and through his policy he shall
[2:13:23] cause craft to prosper in his
[2:13:25] hands and he and he shall be magnify and
[2:13:30] he shall magnify himself in his heart
[2:13:33] and and by peace shall destroy many
[2:13:37] that's what Paul will say when they say
[2:13:39] peace peace peace suddenly come
[2:13:42] destruction because it's all in the same
[2:13:46] time are we together
[2:13:55] he shall uh uh the strong maning he
[2:13:58] shall also stand against the Prince of
[2:14:04] Peace praise the Lord but he shall be
[2:14:08] broken without
[2:14:11] him are we together I love I love the
[2:14:14] next verse and the vision of the evening
[2:14:17] and the
[2:14:19] morning which was told is truth
[2:14:23] wherefore shut up shut thou up the
[2:14:26] vision for it shall be for many
[2:14:30] days God said close the book Daniel shut
[2:14:32] it up I'm revealing it to you but it
[2:14:35] will be for many days this is something
[2:14:38] for the
[2:14:39] end when transgress when transgression
[2:14:42] will rise up will be
[2:14:44] for are we together verse 27 and I Danel
[2:14:49] fainted and was so Sake One Vision in
[2:14:52] the night troubl

[2:14:59] I was sick for many
[2:15:01] days what are we talking about we're
[2:15:03] talking about medium of exchange let me
[2:15:06] bring something to
[2:15:07] you in
[2:15:10] 1971 are we
[2:15:13] together
[2:15:15] amen
[2:15:17] hallelujah in 1971
[2:15:32] no okay I'm I'm looking at different
[2:15:34] thing here let me get back to
[2:15:36] my to my
[2:15:43] now now you you can find all this
[2:15:46] information they are there they are in
[2:15:47] the public domain you can search for it
[2:15:49] the dollar was Peg
[2:15:52] at uh
[2:15:54] $35 an
[2:15:56] ounce and freely
[2:15:59] exchangeable into gold at that rate now
[2:16:03] that was when the dollar was backed by
[2:16:05] the gold
[2:16:06] standard amen that's when the dollar was
[2:16:09] backed by the gold stand however by
[2:16:15] 1971
[2:16:18] uh by 1971
[2:16:21] converting into gold was no longer
[2:16:25] available as US Gold resources drained
[2:16:30] away instead the dollar
[2:16:34] became a pure flat
[2:16:37] currency
[2:16:39] until the Petr dollar agreement was
[2:16:43] concluded by Richard
[2:16:46] Nixon and his uh Secretary of State
[2:16:50] cassinger in
[2:16:52] 1973 what was this
[2:16:55] agreement to save the US economy at that
[2:16:59] time the president sent his secretary
[2:17:03] down to Saudi
[2:17:05] Arabia to get into an agreement with
[2:17:07] them that the us is going to protect
[2:17:11] Saudi Arabia Supply them with army
[2:17:14] amination and all of that and all the
[2:17:16] things there but the US will will
[2:17:18] protect them if they will AG agree to
[2:17:21] sell the oil their oil in US
[2:17:29] dollar so the so the the the the dollar
[2:17:32] is not backed by the gold is now backed
[2:17:35] by
[2:17:37] oil now so you see what everything that
[2:17:40] is happening there with Russia and all
[2:17:42] of these guys you know the prophet to us
[2:17:44] watch Russia when they get down to that
[2:17:46] oil and and and is is to is to
[2:17:51] destroy the value of the US
[2:17:54] currency because when the currency got
[2:17:57] behind the oil it became an
[2:18:00] international
[2:18:04] power praise the Lord are we together
[2:18:07] just like I said this information are
[2:18:09] they are all on uh uh public
[2:18:12] domain I'm just I'm just I'm just trying
[2:18:15] to to encourage you you know share some
[2:18:19] things with you this morning just just
[2:18:21] to encourage
[2:18:22] you are we together and also so we can
[2:18:26] educate
[2:18:30] ourself are we together time is
[2:18:39] fill that's what the word
[2:18:43] says glory be to God the Bible told us
[2:18:47] we must pray for the Peace of the nation
[2:18:49] that is our duty to do we we must
[2:18:51] respect the lord of the nation that is
[2:18:52] what we're supposed to do as
[2:19:00] Believers but we must Bank on God's
[2:19:05] promises we must Bank on God's
[2:19:08] word okay let me just read few to you
[2:19:11] all of these things I will not go I will
[2:19:13] not go a lot into
[2:19:15] that so that in 1973 the in the the
[2:19:20] essence of the the deal was that the US
[2:19:22] will
[2:19:24] agree uh to military sell and and defend
[2:19:27] Saudi Arabia in Return of all the oil
[2:19:29] trade being uh uh Den noted in in US
[2:19:34] dollars so now the dollar now will have
[2:19:38] another strength behind
[2:19:40] it it will have another strength behind
[2:19:43] it by
[2:19:45] statistics you will realize that there
[2:19:48] is more $100 bill out of the US than in
[2:19:52] the
[2:19:55] US praise the Lord that's why when you
[2:19:58] go to the bank they ask you uh uh how
[2:20:01] much Bill you
[2:20:03] want and if you're taking SS money they
[2:20:05] will not give it all to you in $100 bill
[2:20:08] because they don't have
[2:20:12] it big money deals are taking place in
[2:20:15] $100
[2:20:17] bills you have 70% out
[2:20:22] of the
[2:20:23] country that's statistics you can check
[2:20:25] it out I'm not making making up things
[2:20:28] here I'm just I'm just trying to bring
[2:20:31] some reality to you so just to caution
[2:20:35] us to realize that the econom the
[2:20:39] economical problem we are having is the
[2:20:42] crisis of the US
[2:20:45] Dollars trying to destroy the value of
[2:20:49] the US dollar from behind the oil
[2:20:54] Market Russia was selling their oil in
[2:20:56] US Dollars now she's in problem with
[2:20:59] with America she want to sell her oil in
[2:21:05] rubies so it cut the value of the US
[2:21:08] dollar from from
[2:21:11] there praise the
[2:21:15] Lord by history America have always
[2:21:18] stand with Israel

[2:22:28] tender because we know that when the
[2:22:31] enemy come as a flood even the flood
[2:22:33] against our
[2:22:35] economy God will raise a
[2:22:38] stander when there were when there were
[2:22:41] drought in Israel for 3 years the Bible
[2:22:44] says that they were even eating their
[2:22:46] children God had a Brooks to take care
[2:22:49] of Elijah he had a widow woman to take
[2:22:52] care of
[2:22:53] Elijah and I don't believe it was only
[2:22:55] Elijah that he was taking care of he was
[2:22:57] taking care of all the faithful ones all
[2:23:00] the faithful
[2:23:06] ones praise the
[2:23:09] Lord this is time to build Faith Like
[2:23:11] building
[2:23:12] muscles it's time to build faith in the
[2:23:15] promised
[2:23:18] word I'm not talking about emotion of
[2:23:20] faith I'm not talking about a guest
[2:23:23] faith I'm talking about a faith that is
[2:23:26] affecting you you are seeing the effect
[2:23:29] in your own
[2:23:33] life you can get in the presence of God
[2:23:36] and get down on your knees and spend
[2:23:38] time with God and you feel so
[2:23:41] good you can read the word of God not
[2:23:44] just like newspaper you can read it and
[2:23:47] you know that I believe this thing the
[2:23:49] promises in this is solid I will believe
[2:23:52] it in what is on the news media that's
[2:23:55] what I'm trying to do this
[2:24:01] morning I'm trying to tell you invest in
[2:24:04] your faith Bank invest in your faith
[2:24:08] bank that's what I'm
[2:24:13] doing because we are in trouble times
[2:24:17] the things that are happening around us
[2:24:18] they are real
[2:24:44] amen and I lean lean that onto your own
[2:24:46] understanding let me find a place to
[2:24:48] bring this to a close and read this to
[2:24:50] you and see how we can be able to live
[2:24:53] up the name of Jesus amen that's what
[2:24:56] matters
[2:24:57] amen he says now now if we are on the
[2:25:01] gold standard we are
[2:25:03] broke and what we are go what's going to
[2:25:06] happen what's going to happen you know
[2:25:08] the rich people of this nation these big
[2:25:11] F trit and whisky men and tobacco and so
[2:25:13] forth like that is going to
[2:25:17] stand to change the the the curreny so
[2:25:20] the only thing we have to do is to
[2:25:23] borrow praise the
[2:25:25] Lord is to borrow because that's that's
[2:25:29] what was happening on the on the promise
[2:25:32] of giving them military
[2:25:34] defense the the the the subsidize some
[2:25:37] of the US
[2:25:41] deaths and all of
[2:25:43] that and then pretty soon most of the
[2:25:47] other uh or
[2:25:50] countries started falling in line and
[2:25:53] every one of them started using the US
[2:25:54] dollars so that's why it's called the
[2:25:56] petrol
[2:25:58] dollar go and read on the petrol dollar
[2:26:01] it's called the petrol dollar because
[2:26:04] it's it's backed by
[2:26:06] petroleum is backed by the oil market
[2:26:09] and that
[2:26:11] is the war that is going on all the rest
[2:26:14] that is happening is just is just Mirage
[2:26:20] is just
[2:26:22] Mirage because if the US is putting a
[2:26:25] high sanction on uh on uh uh North Korea
[2:26:30] and and and sanction on uh uh uh uh
[2:26:33] Russia and all of that uh uh uh it's
[2:26:37] it's
[2:26:39] because they can only have sanction
[2:26:41] because of the power of the US dollars
[2:26:44] so if Russia can be able to campaign and
[2:26:47] get these guys on their side where they
[2:26:49] can get get rid of the US dollar and
[2:26:51] just use their money between them the
[2:26:53] sanction does not have
[2:26:56] effect praise the Lord the sension does
[2:26:59] not have effect you can only sension me
[2:27:02] and say we're not going to pay
[2:27:05] you now because I'm not getting paid and
[2:27:09] I don't have no where else to get money
[2:27:12] from it's going to affect me that's
[2:27:13] going to affect my children praise the
[2:27:17] Lord but if I say so well you're not
[2:27:19] going to pay me I get a job at
[2:27:21] Walmart praise the Lord are you
[2:27:24] understanding what I'm
[2:27:27] saying so there are big things that are
[2:27:29] playing out
[2:27:33] there I'm trying to say get back into
[2:27:36] the
[2:27:38] word read the word listen to to to to
[2:27:42] the message study the word invest in
[2:27:45] your prayer life work on things that you

[2:28:18] economy B hands they got to get behind
[2:28:21] it and and and
[2:28:23] talk the only solution they can come up
[2:28:25] with is to tell her to wear
[2:28:29] masks praise the Lord people were dying
[2:28:33] nothing they could do they just say wear
[2:28:48] masks so you see people there there's a
[2:28:51] whole lot that is going on
