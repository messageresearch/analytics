let us take our bibles tonight let's take our bibles over in the book of genesis thank you musicians praise the lord thank you for the spirit of worship that you bring into the house of the lord thank you saints for being here tonight genesis chapter 44 genesis chapter 44. i realized when we read the scripture on on sunday and commented a little bit dead about jacob leaving his father-in-law's house and talking about the image that that richard took from her father and the scripture says rachel took her father image and then he comes down to to jacob and he says well you have stored in my gums and uh uh genesis chapter 44. let's just let's read and i will i will make it coming here this is this is joseph verse 1. joseph and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the man's sack with food as much as they can carry and put every man money in his sack mouth and put my cup the silver cup in the sock mouth of the youngest and his calm money and he did a calling as he did a calling to the word that joseph have spoken amen let's pray together heavenly father we just ask your blessings now that you will come lord and bless the portion of your word that we will we want to look at tonight lord i just pray that the inspiration father that led us to this thought will will be able to come in that channel tonight and be a blessing lord father to your children lord god as we don't want the thoughts of men we want our father god your your internal thoughts father that's the thing that heal our body that's the thing of father god that change our nature oh god is when we are we have been affected by your internal thoughts we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name amen the lord bless you you can have your seed we know that uh you know the the message of the hour is not all you know what about do and dance we know that uh uh this is uh uh the unfailing word of god praise the lord tonight just for the few minutes that is before us maybe 30 also 35 minutes i want to take a little talk that i will i will title joseph several cop joseph saver cop praise the lord joseph saver cop praise the lord now so uh uh just to be able to to fill you up uh uh uh just fill in a little bit so you can be able to grab the talk that we want to deal with tonight uh saver is uh is uh uh is god's uh how can we say this is is this precious element that represents redemption we know savor is redemption uh uh gold speaks of of deity bride speaks of judgment now so we will see a little redemptive work here that is done by joseph uh and and as you read the story uh we know that uh from the moment that joseph brothers came in town and he came and showed himself over to joseph looking for food he recognized them and i mean i mean there's never the time that i read this story and and tears don't feel immanized because i i know what it is you know coming from out of air's eye you know i know what it is after being away for the long time and but there is something uh uh as you as we read along there is something that uh uh that brought me to this to this thought and i will i will share with you as we go along praise the lord amen so as you read the story and read the bible you will realize that uh joseph has held simeon back because his brothers in telling identifying himself and telling their history spoke about their father and spoke about their younger brother and their and another brother that he did not say anything about he just said we are 12 brothers our younger brother and our other brother which of course that was joseph you know the story but as they go along and when they mention the younger brother joseph prophet on that you know to tell them that i don't believe you i don't believe your story until you bring your younger brother praise the lord now we all know the connection you know uh this guy on sunday we spoke about richard and so that was benjamin you know when uh to realize that uh joseph and benjamin share the same mother and uh and and their mother you know uh uh died during child birth joseph i mean benjamin was now only special to jacob but benjamin was also special to joseph okay he was very special to joseph [Music] so seeing seeing his brothers and now seeing benjamin create unconsciousness you know you read you read the bible the scripture says you know he's he spoke to his brothers in the hebrew tongue and everything that his brothers were saying he could understand it and and and as they were talking he's checking there and he stepped out and he go and he cried oh my goodness i can't believe it this is my brother's and the bible says he cried but he tried to hold himself i imagine run down to the sink wash his face and everything so that when that you know he was doing as much as he can to disguise himself praise the lord so his brothers went back and now they have come with benjamin after you know convincing their father you know they have come with benjamin and immediately joseph talked to benjamin but he's doing everything to to you know to keep it as a secret and his heart is beating so fast the lord so what he would do is the other now he will put his silver cup in benjamin's sack because he want to keep benjamin amen he wants to keep benjamin so they can go and bring their father uh praise the lord amen so far am i in line with the with the with the story amen praise the lord i hope i'm not telling my own tales up here glory be to god amen okay let's drop down a little bit you can read the rest of the chapter but let's drop down a little bit verse four and when they were gone out of the city and that year five of jesus said unto his they will follow up unto his sea will up follow after the men and when thou does overtake them say unto them wherefore they have rewarded evil for good it's not this in which my lord drinketh and whereabout indeed he divine it he have done evil in so doing ye have done evil in so doing sorry and and he overtook them and he speak unto them they seemed worse and they said unto him wherefore said my law these words god forbade that that seven should do a calling to this thing behold the money which were found in our sight now joseph is uh sending his his seven but this is there's a place here i want us to get praise the lord verse nine okay let's read from verse eight that's where we were behold the money which we found in our psych mouth we brought again unto thee out of the land of of kenya how then should that how then should we steal out of the uh the lost house saver or gold with whomsoever of thy seven it be found both let him die now this was the same statement that jacob made when leban comes running for his image now this is our connection now this is the place i want to get you now this is our connection this is the same statement that jacob made when lebanon came looking for his image praise the lord a man looking for his image looking for his god you know i was thinking about that i said well people would go home and says brother one the bible says it was his god you know it was an idolate i mean whatever you put before god you know whatever you treasured above the word of god is is your god amen so uh i think you are settled on there so let me not make a seminar out of that tonight but this is what i want to get i want us to to to be able to get he now he's because he's so convinced just like how jacob was convinced amen praise the lord he's so convinced and says uh uh uh uh how can we do this how can we do this just imagine we returned the money that we found in our sock we brought it back it's let's say a cop that we would steal praise the lord and he made the very same statement you love the lord i mean the word of god is so sweet amen whosoever all thy seventy be found both let him die and we also will be my lost bound man praise the lord amen verse 12 and he searched and began at the elvis and left uh and and left are the youngest and the cop was found in benjamin's suck i believe when they all saw wow i believe we put this room through but a word that is spooking is is it's wasted water it cannot be gathered it has already gone forth praise the lord amen i know i'm giving you a lot of suspense tonight i love to do it i love to do it amen what you see here is that out of inspiration now you remember now even this is this is even before god started dealing with with um with moses giving him all the ordinance and the different significance of of the instrument in a tabernacle that brings out the representation for days even before that time joseph in his mind to be able to redeem his brother in a sense to keep him because he know what he's doing the brothers don't know what he's doing i love that almighty god know what he's doing you don't know what god is doing but he know what he's doing here oh my let me get this watch off my hands praise the lord because i might get running tonight amen oh my i enjoyed this thought when it struck me by night amen praise the lord he knew what he was doing but the brothers then they had no idea he put the money in the bag and he got that oh oh what what has happened what kind of a mischief well what god is doing to us in this but joseph knew what he was doing praise the lord he knew what he was doing so he put the silver cup there and uh and and and and you see he he instructed the stiwa when you go don't go to the youngest one start from the other one so when you open the first black you see we don't have it you see that's we said it open the second i told you we don't have it praise the lord amen but now watch this the scripture said and when you go back a little bit when they came with benjamin and joseph set them on at feast joseph instructed his seven to set them in order praise the lord they came he set them at age the first born the second born and the second and then the last joseph i mean benjamin will end up by the sign of joseph praise the lord and everyone wow they're thinking in their mind wow something strange how come he's setting us by age at first they never thought about it but i still went alone oh robin you're sitting next to this guy oh oh wow praise the lord because joseph knew what he was doing but they never had an idea praise the lord you believe that god is in control tonight he believes that you know that god knows what he's doing with your life and you just don't know what what is going on but god is in control amen now so uh uh they get over there and and and they found the the cop in in benjamin sack i i i mean i could i would just pre preach the redemption of ezra tonight but there is no time i just want to bring you to a place here then verse 13 then the reindeer closed every one of them and and i mean they started rolling on the ground and you know being so ashamed of themselves but i mean uh judah has has spoken already you know that the one that uh uh either judah or rubin one of them took the word here and spoken says uh with whom they are of that seven you found it let him die now so uh uh we know the story i mean the beg the cry and he says uh you know what we we we can do this if we if we if we ever get back you know if we ever go and uh uh uh tell our father you know uh he's just going to drop dead you know and he went back and started telling all the story but this is the beautiful thing god in his providence you see the the the the the inspiration of the almighty god in his providence designing like that amen because what what is played out here was prophesying of how god will redeem israel amen of how god will redeem israel praise the lord now but because joseph is the one that planted the cup amen praise the lord just like the almighty god put him his predestinated seed in you there is no condemnation unto them that are in christ praise the lord i'm trying to do my best not to preach tonight amen are we together because because joseph i mean he had a plan in his mind so even when when rubin or judah was saying the one you find a cop with let that one die now with the case of jacob and leban none of them knew who did it praise the lord if if jacob ever had an idea that it was his wife that did it he wouldn't have said that he would have either come in her defense and say is this not your daughter and even if she takes something from you can you let it go but he was fully convinced praise the lord that's the reason why you know it teaches us the scripture whether we are angry or we are happy we have to watch our words the lord whether we are angry or we are happy we have to watch the things we say to our children to our wives to our husbands i could go in in and evening and we have to watch the things we say praise the lord but here that word never meant nothing to joseph praise the lord it never meant anything to joseph he could not hold him holding them guilty to persecute them would be persecuting himself amen they will be persecuting himself glory be to god but that's not where we where we want to go tonight we'll find another time to talk about it but what caught my mind and what you know is is the importance all through the scripture just like how joseph used a cup as a symbol of redemption to be able to keep his brother close you washed through the scripture the first time was when joseph was in prison and these two sevens of uh of uh pharaoh found themselves in prison praise the lord and then we know the story there about the dreams and all of that and joseph interpreted their dreams and the one thou that that was that was set free which means joseph in praising remember now brother branham says it's a type of christ on the cross one was was condemned and one was set free but the one that was set free he was a cop bearer he was a cop bearer he was pharaoh's cup bearer there is something about cop and redemption there is something about cup and redemption and we will look we want to look into it a little bit here so we realized here you know uh over there the bulk log was was set free you know and uh uh and the baker had to die the the buckler he was the the cup burial of of of pharaoh and uh uh and i i as i was looking at this through the scripture it kind of surprises me very very very much when nathan came to david after david has failed with belt sheba when he came to david he said to david he gave david a story about a poor man that lived in a town and this man how his little sheep he used the very same word that we use for the name of richard young which is a young female sheep and and nettle said that's sheep drinks from the same cup of the poor man now he's bringing the story to to david praise the lord now you have to remember now that this is the prophet nathan this is the prophet of god this is the man that have the word of god for david's age for david's day praise the lord now david is sitting there in the seat he's bawling he's sweating nato has come to see him there is problem in the town there's a poor man that is in trouble david is anxious we know that he was just caught up in his guilt his guilt was making him emotional his guilt guilt can put people into hurt when they're not supposed to be in hurry praise the lord and and he had the word of the lord in and he's talking to to david and he says this poor man he has a sheep and and he sleeps with his sheep the ship even drinks from the same cop and this man and david says the man that have done that the man should die and nathan said david you are the man but you will not die praise the lord now for the fact that even the prophet nature is is is giving david a vision i would call it a vision a vision of redemption the prophet nathan is giving david a vision in his mind he's he's creating a story for david to see the beautiful redemption story that would come out of david the the chaos that he found himself in praise the lord the mess that he put himself in god was going to bring a beautiful redemption story amen because from david and beersheba will come solomon who will become a type of christ so in that story there was a picture of redemption and god has always used a cup in the picture of redemption praise the lord israel was in rome jerusalem the war their walls was broken down the city gates were all tall the temple was wrong yet it took another cup bearer nehemiah's that god will burn in his heart for the rebuilding of the wall to bring redemption the next time when you sing fill my cup you will sing it in a different way praise the lord because god always use cop for redemption amen glory be to god i think i have a few minutes here so i can go go ahead a little bit here amen amen this is just a prayer meeting as you know glory be to god amen psalm chapter 116 let's look at that a little bit tonight i don't know how much reading we'll be able to do but let's look at psalm chapter 116. praise the lord amen praise the lord are we together verse 9 i walk i will walk before the lord in the land of the living i believe therefore i have spoken i was greatly afflicted i said in in my head all men are liars what shall i render unto the lord for all his his benefits towards me i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people amen having a lot of the scriptures but uh i just want to kind of create this picture tonight so uh we can be able to see this uh uh what lays in the shadow you know what lays in the shadow you you even think about jesus coming to the well and meeting the woman at the well a beautiful story in st john that we all love and he asked the woman for water the thing that was surprising is that he did not have anything he did not had anything for water but he wanted water to drink now you have to realize that the the the jewish cop you know it could run from a teacup to a board amen whatever that was fit for them to drink from that's why brother daryl wall says you better sing fill my truck instead of fill my cup praise the lord amen because whatever you give to god to fail he's going to feel it but the thing there is that it's not for him to feel it and for you to put on your shell is for you to drink it praise the lord amen glory be to god amen now so we we see here that uh jesus comes to the well and he don't you don't have a cup he don't have a bucket he don't have nothing in his hands and yet he's asking the woman for water for what to drink why because he was the chief car bearer praise the lord amen in john chapter 7 he was the one that says living water will flow out of your belly the church will also become a cupbearer as you look through the scripture praise the lord because jesus told the woman he says he says i have water that i can give you you will drink now keep keep the thought in mind now i have water i will give you that you would drink how do one drink we drink from cup so if he had water he had a cup if he had water to get he definitely had cup to save the water and when you look through the scripture there are different things you will see you will see that in zechariah 12 2 israel is called the trembling cup amen jeremiah god spoke about the cup of consolation now so we we have we have all of these things here but what what what i wanted what i want us to do is to to keep the picture in mind praise the lord joseph was the one that placed the cup or instructed that the cop will be placed in benjamin's side praise the lord because that was that was the thing that made joseph to reveal himself to his brothers that was the story after they found the cop and judah started crying on the ground and he started rolling tearing their clothes and all of that oh my goodness we we can't leave our brother yeah our father would surely die i mean i mean joseph heart is breaking praise the lord and when they are narrating all of this story as you read the bible said he stepped back he wept his eyes trying to compose himself but this is the thing that would bring redemption to jacob in his household it's the silver cup praise the lord the savior cup will bring redemption to jacob and his household because when joseph revealed himself to his brother he cried with a loud crowd he took his uh uh uh uh egyptian hairpiece from his head took all his egyptian makeup and say i'm your brother i'm i'm joseph your brother and the bible says they started coming close is that real is that you let's touch your hands and that's the very same thing the church going to do but the silver cup will be the thing that will redeem joseph i mean jacob in his household because after joseph revealed himself he says go and call your father no secret now amen no secret praise the lord oh my are we together praise the lord jesus matthew chapter 10 he says even a cup of water will not go without being rewarded even a cup of water and brother brandon comes and helps us to understand that those are the ones that will come into god's redemption or salvation plan by being kind to god's people the people that comes on a cup of water are those that were nice to god's people so you see that cup it's it's [Laughter] it's more than praise the lord oh my praise the lord amen you love the lord tonight glory be to god there sharza talked over his father throne when his father nebuchadnezzar died and he ruled the kingdom but just at the time that god would tear the kingdom apart was when he took the cup that they took from the temple when he took the vessels of the temple to drink his babylonian wine in it just like men using the vessels of god to drink all their wally wine alcohol drugs and all of the things that they are getting drunken on using this body that god has made but that cup became a cup of judgment because right there an unknown language came and it was that night it was that very night as daniel was interpreting the handwriting on the wall the meeting the persians was entering the city praise the lord jesus said even a cup of water even a cup of water it is not the cup as the natural cup is the heart that it comes from is the heart that it comes from because that is the cup that god filled with his presence is the heart that it comes from a lot of people gave cups and wonderful glasses and then i mean pressure things they put water in but their heart is not good their heart is not right they are either they are either using their best glass to show how much money they buy and want to be proud about you know what they have they want to show off he might go down to a village and a woman might take an old rustic cup but with a good heart praise lord i'll tell you a story very personal uh i was i want to i want to check that that was during the war in liberia i went to i left uh bushwild island i went down cinco i was going to check to the place my mom was living i was looking i was going to check on my mom and the whole place was wrong and i never could get information and i was coming back and you know all of that i got arrested by some guy saying well i've lost my life that night i was i was terribly beaten to death i hold some some some scars in my head you see caught in my head is is not i'm not making star it's a scar that i hold there so i mean i was i was terribly beaten i was stuck in my own blood but i mean and i got into a fight with the guy you know i was you know trying they took everything i had the money and everything and but i remember why because i talk about water now i remember when i woke up and i mean they were all gone they have run away because i i mean i was i was yelling i was crying for help crying for my life and and and the first man that ran to the place when he saw me he was so afraid because i mean i was soaked in my own block i mean i was soaked from head to toe when he saw me he was so afraid he was nervous you know and he just back up so i mean i was i was just struggling to walk and and this and this military woman came in and and she saw me she she said what's what what's happening what what what's what you know she and all i could say is give me water you know that's all i just asked i said give me water because i was so thirsty whether it was because of the bleed or whatever i just gave me water you know i was struggling over my birthing and uh back home you know at the corner of the house and we you we do have them here is is the drum outside where you keep water for your flowers but back home people use that and we use those waters for different things in their home so they had a big drum outside as we walked to her place she was trying to get story from me she wanted to know what was what was going on but all i could say was give me water you know give me water and then as we got there she just took the cup i mean it was a it was a buttercane you know i mean what a rusty or whatever it is she just dipped that thing in the water i can stay i can still remember i took that cup to my mouth i never believed i could drink like that i mean uh uh uh this will be almost like uh uh maybe uh uh one liter or two liter i just took it to my mouth and and and i mean i just drank the whole thing down i drank it down and just poured the rest on my face praise the lord it was not a nice cup but it came from a good heart it came from a good hat because you know the rest of the story she took me over to where i could be treated and and everything and uh you know took some information from me but i mean that's that's that's what it is you know uh so jesus said that you know a cup of water will never go unrewarded but then you remember also the last hour of jesus life he said father let this cup let this cup pass but not my will but your will be done there was a cop he was going to drink from you know oh i could go on and preach tonight i could go on and preach tonight but my time is is almost there he says let this cup pass and we know what that cup was praise the lord he was going to drink of all of our farts all of our thoughts was going to be pulled on him praise the lord he said not my will but let your will be done he drunk of it praise the lord musicians you can come tonight maybe the law will help us we'll we'll find a time and better talk about this but i know i've given you a lot of things to think about tonight amen giving a lot of things to think about and go home and read and read through your scripture then and going steady but you see let me say this before we get into singing and get back into praying to close up here one time the mother of james and his brother came to jesus and she said master i want to request something of you can you allow my two boys i want you to sit on your right hand and once you sit on your left hand will you come in your kingdom jesus said he said a woman it is not for me to give brother brandon the message how can i overcome he said because that was a predestinated position he said it was a position that was already predestinated and predestinated for wu for the bride [Music] it was a predestinated position but he said this is acts will they be able to drink from the same cup will they be able to drink because the people that are predestinated for this place will be able to drink [Music] in every age they will get a taste [Music] of that cup [Music] that's the reason why in every age god's people goes through trials god's people go through cruel rock testing that's why brother branham call it cruel testing another one that we create for ourself [Music] but the ones that we find ourselves in him and we can't tell why [Music] but it's a pleasure to the father because he has counted you walking to drink from the same cup well brother jordan i feel like preaching them that the preaching anointing is coming to me he have counted you walking when we complain about little things [Music] when the scriptures say count it all joy we complain we want to we think about going through a lion then want to be a daniel i want to be a a job when we are in we are right in our age right in our time we can make all the excuses oh praise the lord i never even thought i would tell you a personal story of mine but that's okay talking about joseph save a cop oh my goodness man [Music] that's just by our hostile to the lord jesus oh lord yes [Music] on all of us [Music] see [Music] yeah my heart wants you to be his top bearer he wants people to be able to drink rivers of life out of your life he want for people to get comfort people that are same testing soul will feel so tested if he's so satisfied because they have seen a sinner saved by grace it's not it's not you practicing righteousness and never want to believe that you are a sinner saved by grace but god want to use your same story to be able to bring comfort to other that are struggling in others that need more of god in your life than me the reality of god are you able to tell somebody or some of the awful things that god brought you out of [Music] are you able to drink from his cup [Music] when we just think that i mean christianity what i mean is uh i wear our best clothes come to service on wednesday night and sunday morning are you being a witness to someone out there telling them that god brought me out of this i used to be in this field i used to be in this in this awfulness that's the reason why he redeemed you so you can be a cupbearer others can be able to drink from the pureness the earnestly from your heart the truthness that comes from your soul now the makeup that we put up oh god want to get down into your heart and take every invade and every stop of spirit and clean the heart and just make it aboard make it a place where he can drink praises from he can drink worship from he can drink sacrifice from he want to make you a cup bearer all cleans my cup lord father because you cannot fill it
