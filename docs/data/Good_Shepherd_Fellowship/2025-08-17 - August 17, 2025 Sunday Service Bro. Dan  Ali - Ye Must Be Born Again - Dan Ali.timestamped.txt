[40:08] that for us it will be a way of life,
[40:11] not a burden.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be begged to.
[40:17] Wonderful Jesus, what a great and mighty
[40:19] God you are. Thank you, Jesus.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; We thank you so much.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; For our voices that have risen before
[40:29] you in songs of praise,
[40:32] thank you Lord for being in our midst
[40:35] this moment.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; For you have said in your word, what two
[40:38] or three are gathered in your name,
[40:40] there you are in their midst. And you
[40:42] are here this morning
[40:44] &gt;&gt; because your word is true.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[40:50] We are so grateful that you have
[40:52] preserved our lives and have preserved
[40:55] our souls unto thee. Have mercy upon us,
[40:59] Father. Forgive us of all our sins and
[41:02] of all our iniquities. Forgive us of all
[41:04] our stubbornness and our foolish ways
[41:07] and our choices. Lord have mercy. Grant
[41:11] us all a closer walk with thee. And let
[41:14] us walk before thee, Father,
[41:18] and never
[41:21] miss any step before you.
[41:25] The steps of the righteous are ordered
[41:26] of you.
[41:28] Let every step we take be ordered of
[41:30] you.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Touch every heart this morning in a very
[41:35] special way. You alone know
[41:38] &gt;&gt; what is on the hearts of your children.
[41:40] I have no idea.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Father, come down. Take your word off my
[41:46] lips and place it where it belongs in
[41:49] the lives of your children.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; That as many of us that have come would
[41:53] never leave your presence the same way.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Some of the saints are not here in our
[42:02] midst. Wherever they are, we pray be
[42:03] with them. Those that are following the
[42:06] service online, Father, for one reason
[42:08] or the other, we pray may your grace be
[42:10] extended to them this moment.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Your servant, Father, oh God,
[42:16] would be coming sometime in the course
[42:18] of this week. We pray that you will be
[42:21] with him as he makes his way back home.
[42:25] We pray that you will send your holy
[42:27] angels to meet him wherever he is and
[42:31] escort him safely into our midst to the
[42:34] glory of your holy name. And we know
[42:36] also, Father, the Ingongos are not in
[42:38] our midst. They are troubled. Wherever
[42:40] they are, Father, be with them. And
[42:43] Father, we pray that when their journey
[42:45] is over, you bring them safely back
[42:46] home. Also,
[42:48] Brother Ben has asked for prayers for
[42:50] his brother Joel. whoever he is and
[42:53] wherever he is and whatever it is that
[42:55] he's going through, you know all about
[42:57] it. We lift him before you, Father, as a
[43:01] church of the living God. And we pray
[43:03] that you would minister unto him,
[43:05] Father, this moment, Father, whatever
[43:07] the need be in his life. Minister unto
[43:10] him accordingly in Jesus name. And let
[43:13] him know that there is a God who answers
[43:17] prayer.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. As many of us have
[43:20] gathered, Father, oh God, we open our
[43:22] hearts before you this morning.
[43:26] Let there be a highway, Father, oh God,
[43:28] this moment
[43:30] from your throne, Father, straight into
[43:32] every single soul. And we pray that you
[43:35] would minister unto us. Praise the Lord.
[43:39] Thank you, dear Lord Jesus. We are so
[43:42] grateful that you've heard and answered
[43:44] our prayers this morning in Jesus name.
[43:48] Amen.
[43:50] God bless you, saints.
[43:52] God bless you, brother Lawrence.
[43:55] We give
[43:57] God the glory, Sister Naomi, says Joy.
[44:00] God bless you. And uh that'll be all for
[44:03] the song service for now. And uh while
[44:07] we are still standing, if we can open
[44:09] our Bibles
[44:11] to the book of John.
[44:22] God bless you all saints for coming
[44:26] &gt;&gt; and whatever your heart desires are.
[44:30] I pray that the almighty God
[44:34] would minister
[44:37] to you and grant your heart request.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[44:53] 1-7.
[44:57] John 3
[44:59] 1-7.
[45:12] I read
[45:18] There was a man of the Pharisees named
[45:20] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same
[45:24] came to Jesus by night, and said unto
[45:26] him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a
[45:30] teacher come from God. For no man can do
[45:34] these miracles that thou doest except
[45:36] God be with him." Jesus answered and
[45:39] said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say
[45:42] unto thee, except a man be born again,
[45:46] he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[45:50] Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man
[45:54] be born when he is old?
[45:59] Can he enter the second time into his
[46:03] mother's womb and be born?"
[46:06] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[46:09] unto thee, except a man be born of water
[46:14] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
[46:17] the kingdom of God."
[46:20] Verse six, that which is born of the
[46:23] flesh is flesh,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; and that which is born of the spirit is
[46:27] spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
[46:31] thee, Ye must be born again. May the
[46:35] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[46:37] his word.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Shall we be seated?
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:52] My theme this morning
[46:55] is ye must be born again.
[47:00] Ye must be born again.
[47:07] We all have our experiences with God.
[47:13] Whether you came by way of dream,
[47:16] whether you came by way of a vision,
[47:20] whether somebody invited you for the
[47:23] first time, whether you were just
[47:25] walking by the road and the spirit of
[47:27] God picked you up,
[47:32] whichever way it was,
[47:35] we have all had our experience while we
[47:40] are here.
[47:44] As wonderful as some may be and as
[47:47] simple as others may be, it doesn't make
[47:50] one more superior to the other.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Because it is God who is doing the
[47:55] calling.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; It is God who is behind it. It's not a a
[47:59] man's work.
[48:01] You are not seated here because you like
[48:04] it.
[48:06] Something is driving you. That is why
[48:09] you are here.
[48:11] As a matter of fact, some have come to a
[48:13] place in their lives with a lot of
[48:15] questions and some maybe have reached a
[48:19] point of giving up.
[48:22] But before you are aware, you are in the
[48:24] next service.
[48:27] It is God's doing and not a man's doing.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Some of us have been ordained onto this
[48:33] message.
[48:35] Forget of what people say about the
[48:37] prophet and what people say about the
[48:38] message.
[48:40] Some of us have been ordained onto this
[48:43] message to believe what we believe.
[48:48] It doesn't matter what happens.
[48:51] We are not going anywhere.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; We've been ordained onto this message.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I have
[49:02] shared that story time and again
[49:06] how I came to this message.
[49:09] that when I heard the word, I went back
[49:12] and told my Muslim friend, we were
[49:14] roommates. I said, "Muhammad, all my
[49:17] years I have been looking for something,
[49:19] but I have found it."
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God he didn't ask me what it was.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Because I knew I had found it,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; but I couldn't explain what it was.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; If the prophet was in error, Some of us
[49:39] have been ordained
[49:40] &gt;&gt; to believe that error.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And thank God it is the truth of the
[49:45] almighty God.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; We have not come to test the waters.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; We have not come to test the waters. We
[49:55] have not come to see how good is going
[49:58] to be or how bad is going to be.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; No, we are here to stay for life.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; We have not believed. Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Kindly deise tables.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; What we have believed is life.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; We have come to show our appreciation to
[50:21] God.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; That is a good thing
[50:24] &gt;&gt; and we will continue to come till we
[50:27] come no more.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows when the last day is going
[50:31] to be.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; But we are closer today
[50:38] &gt;&gt; than we were yesterday.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That is sure.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; But before then,
[50:46] ye must be born again.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; He must be born again.
[50:56] And
[50:58] if there was a time in the history
[51:02] of the church of the living God that we
[51:06] ought to emphasize this, it is now.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Because we are closer to the end more
[51:14] than ever before.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; We have heard of wars
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and rumors of wars.
[51:25] Nations
[51:27] have risen up against nations.
[51:30] If you want to start counting them in
[51:32] our day and age, we are going to take 10
[51:35] minutes of our time away. But nations
[51:39] have risen against nations.
[51:42] The Bible says that in the end time
[51:45] knowledge shall increase. Indeed,
[51:49] knowledge has increased so much till
[51:53] when I sit down and I begin to think I
[51:57] don't know what the next thing is going
[51:58] to be because knowledge has increased so
[52:03] much.
[52:05] All of us are witnesses to AI
[52:08] revolution.
[52:11] The race has just begun
[52:15] and more than 100 thousands have lost
[52:18] their jobs already. Why? Because
[52:21] machines are taking the jobs away from
[52:24] humans.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; In 50 years from now, if Christ carries,
[52:29] we will be gone.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Those that will be here, I don't know
[52:34] how life is going to be.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Seek God.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seek God.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Have a relationship with God now.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That things are good.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; That in the days of trouble,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; you know where to go.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Knowledge has abound in the end time.
[52:59] Knowledge shall abound. Knowledge has
[53:00] abound
[53:02] &gt;&gt; without a question.
[53:05] There are earthquakes
[53:07] in diverse places,
[53:10] not only on land, but even in the sea.
[53:13] The first time I ever heard of tsunami
[53:15] was when it happened in the Philistines
[53:17] and I think over 200,000 people lost
[53:20] their lives when the sea waters just
[53:22] over invaded the land and people just in
[53:26] a matter of time lost their lives. I
[53:30] believe in a deathbed repentance because
[53:33] the prophet of God talks about it.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; But don't wait for one.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Don't wait for one. It may never come
[53:42] your way.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Now that you are hearing the word of
[53:47] God, now that you are hearing the voice
[53:49] of God, if there is anything to make
[53:51] right, make it right with God.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If a man should gain the whole
[53:57] world and lose his very own soul, what
[53:59] has he gained?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; All is vanity.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; We have come to the end of the road. I
[54:10] look at it and I tell myself that the
[54:12] church of the living God has come to a
[54:14] cordisac
[54:15] &gt;&gt; and a cordisac is just the end of the
[54:18] road.
[54:19] Mhm.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages were ordained to the
[54:23] gentile church. We are in the seventh
[54:26] church age. There is no more church
[54:28] coming after this. It is the last.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; There were seven messengers.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; One is to a church age.
[54:38] The last brother has come and gone.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; There is no more prophet coming after
[54:44] him.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; We are at the very end.
[54:49] Praise the Lord.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; At the very end,
[54:54] &gt;&gt; any day
[54:56] &gt;&gt; could be that day.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] When King Nebula saw that vision, that
[55:03] dream,
[55:05] the head of gold,
[55:08] the breast and the arms of silver, the
[55:10] stomach and the ties of bronze, the the
[55:13] the the legs of iron, and the the feet
[55:16] iron mixed with clay.
[55:19] Talking about the Gentile kingdoms.
[55:23] We are not here anymore.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; We are not here. We are not here.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; We are not even in the legs.
[55:32] The church
[55:34] is in the feet.
[55:36] The feet iron mixed with clay.
[55:40] Now when you take the body of a man and
[55:45] you start from the head coming down and
[55:47] you get to the feet, where else do you
[55:50] have to go?
[55:53] That is how far you can go. That is how
[55:56] far the church of the living God has
[55:57] come. We are at a place where that stone
[56:02] was healed without a hand and it came
[56:04] and crashed the image on the feet.
[56:08] Praise the Lord. That is where we are.
[56:11] Everything is pointing to the end.
[56:15] Everything is pointing to the end. Any
[56:18] spirit that will tell you there is time
[56:20] is not the spirit of God.
[56:23] The spirit of God would tell you that
[56:24] time is running out.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And time is not only running out, but
[56:29] time has run out.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; There is a song that says Israel is
[56:37] awakening.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Proudly at the time the song was
[56:41] composed. Yes, Israel was awakening.
[56:46] Israel is wide awake now.
[56:49] I believe if the author was going to
[56:53] recompose that song, he will change that
[56:55] line.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Israel is wide awake now.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Everything is pointing to the end.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; If there was any time,
[57:07] praise the Lord,
[57:09] &gt;&gt; that men should seek the face of God,
[57:13] men should mean more business with God.
[57:16] If there was any time we have to seek
[57:19] the Holy Ghost more than ever before, if
[57:23] there was any time we have to put food
[57:25] aside and have time to fast and just
[57:28] praise the Lord, it is now.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; You don't fast because there is no food
[57:36] in the house.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Elsewhere, when there is no food, people
[57:43] will fast.
[57:47] But it becomes more difficult
[57:49] &gt;&gt; when you have a lot
[57:53] &gt;&gt; on your dining table, you have a lot on
[57:56] the center island, you have a lot in the
[57:59] refrigerator that everywhere you turn,
[58:02] the food is calling you. And then you
[58:04] want to have time to just say no to food
[58:07] and to seek the face of God. Yeah.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; And if it happens to be in your comfort
[58:12] zone
[58:14] when you just pass by maybe to go to the
[58:16] restroom and you see something, if God
[58:18] doesn't help you, that's the end of the
[58:20] fast.
[58:23] If there was a time
[58:26] that
[58:29] we should be talking about the Holy
[58:31] Ghost baptism,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; he must
[58:38] praise the Lord.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; He must be born again.
[58:43] brother told a story
[58:47] in Vancouver, British island, British
[58:50] Columbia
[58:52] of a bicycle race
[58:56] that they were going to give a prize, a
[58:59] swing bike was the prize to anybody that
[59:02] would win it. and they were supposed to
[59:04] ride their bicycle on a 12 in wide um
[59:10] trailer, whatever you want to call it,
[59:12] over 100 yards.
[59:15] And then the real bike bike riders just
[59:18] came. He said there were some that will
[59:21] go grocery shopping for their mothers,
[59:23] take the groceries, put them under their
[59:25] arm, and then they will ride back home
[59:28] without even holding the steering.
[59:30] That was how good they were. And so when
[59:33] they came, oh, every one of them knew
[59:35] they were going to win the race. And
[59:37] then this one will start and then drop.
[59:41] This one will start and drop. This one
[59:43] will start and drop. But there was an
[59:46] old CC boy as the prophet of God would
[59:48] call a mama's boy who was just standing.
[59:52] Nobody gave him a chance. But he was
[59:54] standing and he was looking at them and
[59:58] he realized the mistake they were
[1:00:00] making.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; So when it got to his time and he jumped
[1:00:04] on the bike, he just went straight and
[1:00:07] then he won the race.
[1:00:10] Brother said he did not even wobble
[1:00:13] and when he won the race the people just
[1:00:16] came around.
[1:00:18] How did you manage? How did you make it?
[1:00:20] And he said, "When you guys were having
[1:00:23] your turn, I was just watching and I saw
[1:00:28] your mistakes."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Now, just imagine it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; He saw their mistakes. It's just amazing
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; that we Christians,
[1:00:40] we see people doing the wrong things. We
[1:00:43] see their mistakes and instead of
[1:00:46] advising ourselves, using that to advise
[1:00:50] ourselves, we seek to be like them.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; We seek to be like them.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We fall for their rottiness.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; We fall because, oh, he's my brother. We
[1:01:02] believe the same thing. He has messed
[1:01:03] up. Oh, I can also mess up.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; No. Instead of using that to advise
[1:01:09] yourself,
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; instead of using that to learn a lesson,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; but when he look at, he learned a lesson
[1:01:19] from it. And they asked him, "What was
[1:01:22] it?"
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "When you guys were on the
[1:01:25] bicycle, you were looking down."
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; But when I took my turn,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I looked to the end and I held steady.
[1:01:35] Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; He looked at the end
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and he held
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; steady.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; I pray God to help us.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That we shall not look at our present
[1:01:50] dangers,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; but we shall keep our eyes
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; to the end.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; That we shall not be bothered by the
[1:01:59] present circumstances
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; of our time. We shall keep our eyes on
[1:02:05] the end
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; that we shall not be bothered by our
[1:02:10] health problems. Whatever that may be,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; we shall not be bothered.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; By what is going on in our lives,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; we shall keep our eyes to the end.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; And keep steady.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Keep steady.
[1:02:30] If the time has not gotten rough yet,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; rougher times are going to come.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the promise.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on him.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; So long as your eyes are on him,
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; He is going to see you through.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; You are a failure to begin with.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; I am a failure to begin with. Keep your
[1:02:59] eyes on him.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; What are we talking about this morning?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Ye must.
[1:03:09] Ye must. You must be born again.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[1:03:28] You must
[1:03:33] I was at work one time
[1:03:39] and a phrase came to me
[1:03:46] and the phrase goes
[1:03:49] born again
[1:03:52] with emphasis
[1:03:54] on the word again.
[1:03:58] It was so good I started following it
[1:04:04] but I got lost
[1:04:08] and then I just went about my business
[1:04:12] and as a matter of fact I forgot of it.
[1:04:15] I don't know whether it was the
[1:04:16] following week but sometime
[1:04:20] not too long after that I was working
[1:04:22] again and then the same phrase comes
[1:04:24] again. born again again with the
[1:04:27] emphasis on the word again. And then I
[1:04:32] got excited
[1:04:34] because the first time it came, I took
[1:04:36] something. So when it came again, I
[1:04:40] started following the trail.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; I didn't go too far
[1:04:46] and I left it. I think it happened
[1:04:48] three, four or five times. I'm not sure.
[1:04:51] So the last time I said no I have to sit
[1:04:54] and look at this.
[1:04:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And I sat and by the grace of God I saw
[1:05:02] something which
[1:05:05] has led us this way.
[1:05:08] It was so good. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I pray God I don't ruin it.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; If I ruin it, blame it on me.
[1:05:21] If it goes well, give the glory to God.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; I hope I don't ruin it.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[1:05:35] Ye must means you must.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; When the word must is used,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; it leaves you with no option.
[1:05:49] It doesn't seek your opinion.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't ask of your contribution.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; You must
[1:06:05] praise the Lord.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You must have that in mind.
[1:06:16] Ye must.
[1:06:18] It is of absolute
[1:06:21] necessity.
[1:06:25] Of absolute necessity.
[1:06:29] You either do it
[1:06:32] or you do it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; In the message,
[1:06:40] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:06:43] life? The prophet of God speaking.
[1:06:46] Now, I want you to know this. In the
[1:06:50] beginning, when God our father looked
[1:06:52] over this bleak earth
[1:06:54] and it wasn't nothing but one great big
[1:06:57] ball of water
[1:06:59] and God sent the Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] to the earth, the logos
[1:07:06] that went out of God and it began to
[1:07:10] brood over the earth. Now the word brood
[1:07:15] means to make love. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Or just like the dove to cool
[1:07:24] and the great Holy Spirit over the earth
[1:07:28] as a mental picture. Just trying to give
[1:07:30] us a mental picture of what that looks
[1:07:32] like.
[1:07:34] Sorry. I've been trying dealing with
[1:07:36] some little cold here and there. Uh
[1:07:41] yeah, I just make sure I wash my hands
[1:07:44] and um I put uh how do you call it?
[1:07:47] Sanitizer before my
[1:07:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I hope you're not seeing it.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:04] So now the word brood means to make love
[1:08:09] or just like the dove to cool and the
[1:08:13] great holy spirit over the earth as a
[1:08:16] mental picture. We are going to make it
[1:08:18] like wings with with his great wings
[1:08:22] around the earth brooding over it making
[1:08:26] love cooling. Come, come.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; The father has ordained you. Come. I'm
[1:08:33] coming to perform what the father's word
[1:08:36] has said.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Is this so in? The prophet of God is
[1:08:40] asking. Is this so?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are you getting it?
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I have come to manifest what the father
[1:08:48] has spoken.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Brood.
[1:08:51] And after a while,
[1:08:54] there begin to come some petroleum
[1:08:57] moving across the earth
[1:09:00] and a little bit of this and that and a
[1:09:04] little instantly comes up in the earth.
[1:09:07] What brought it? The friend of God said
[1:09:11] the holy spirit brooden.
[1:09:14] Then come along the Dalia and the Aalia
[1:09:20] and other bush.
[1:09:22] Then along come the vegetation.
[1:09:25] The Holy Spirit brooding.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Then along came after the vegetation
[1:09:33] came the trees then the plants. Then
[1:09:37] after a while bears began to fly from
[1:09:40] the dust of the earth.
[1:09:43] The Holy Spirit brooding them together
[1:09:48] and sent them into the air. Praise the
[1:09:52] Lord.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Then along came the animal life. The
[1:09:57] Holy Spirit brooding.
[1:10:00] Then what happened? Along came human
[1:10:03] life.
[1:10:05] All of our bodies was all laying right
[1:10:09] here on earth at that day.
[1:10:12] If we come from the earth and we do and
[1:10:17] our bodies are made by the earth.
[1:10:24] So the prophet of God was just trying to
[1:10:26] lay down the order of things.
[1:10:29] But I want us to take a step back and go
[1:10:32] to Genesis 126.
[1:10:34] Genesis 126.
[1:10:39] Genesis 6.
[1:10:45] Genesis 1:26
[1:11:01] and I read, "And God said, let us make
[1:11:04] man in our image,
[1:11:06] after our likeness,
[1:11:10] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:11:12] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[1:11:15] air, and over the cattle, and over all
[1:11:17] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[1:11:20] that creepeth upon the earth. Verse 27.
[1:11:25] So God created man in his own image, in
[1:11:29] the image of God created he him, male
[1:11:32] and female created he them. Praise the
[1:11:34] Lord.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that God is a spirit
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and the man he created was a spirit man.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Keep that because we are coming back to
[1:11:48] it.
[1:11:51] Now
[1:11:54] in the garden
[1:11:57] there were two trees.
[1:12:01] In the midst of the garden were two
[1:12:02] trees. The tree of life and the tree of
[1:12:07] knowledge of good and evil.
[1:12:10] The tree of life was Christ.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And man was supposed to eat from the
[1:12:18] tree of life and live forever.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But man
[1:12:28] using his right
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; to choose.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:12:34] his right to a free moral agency.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Men rather chose to eat
[1:12:43] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:12:45] evil.
[1:12:48] When you read from the scriptures that
[1:12:51] the Bible says he came to his own and
[1:12:54] his own received him not.
[1:12:58] In other words, he was rejected. You
[1:13:00] will think that it was just the children
[1:13:02] of Israel that rejected him.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; But long before he was rejected, right
[1:13:08] in the garden, he was rejected.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; The tree of life was Christ
[1:13:18] in the midst of the garden. They
[1:13:20] rejected him and instead they ate of the
[1:13:24] tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[1:13:28] And that's why the whole world is in the
[1:13:30] messages in we are in today. Praise the
[1:13:33] Lord.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:13:38] Christ
[1:13:42] was the rejected was rejected right in
[1:13:45] the garden. The Holy Spirit is Christ.
[1:13:49] Suffice it to say that the Holy Spirit
[1:13:52] was rejected.
[1:13:54] Now, brother said that the Holy Spirit
[1:14:00] has never left the earth.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; He's always been around.
[1:14:10] In the message 5510001,
[1:14:13] expectation,
[1:14:14] your Holy Spirit never left the earth.
[1:14:19] The Holy Spirit has never left the
[1:14:22] earth.
[1:14:23] Remember
[1:14:26] the Holy Spirit was breathing over the
[1:14:28] earth
[1:14:30] and cooling
[1:14:33] cooing coo everything every living thing
[1:14:36] into existence.
[1:14:39] The Holy Spirit in the midst of the
[1:14:40] garden,
[1:14:43] the tree of life,
[1:14:47] rejected right there and then,
[1:14:50] but still he did not live.
[1:14:55] And when you read Genesis 3:22,
[1:14:58] if we can just take that real quick, you
[1:15:00] can just listen. Genesis 3:22.
[1:15:04] Genesis 3:22.
[1:15:07] And the Lord God said, "Behold,
[1:15:10] the man is become as one of us to know
[1:15:14] good and evil, and now lest he put forth
[1:15:18] his hand, and take also of the tree of
[1:15:21] life, and eat and live forever."
[1:15:25] Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[1:15:29] from the garden of Eden to till the
[1:15:31] ground from whence he was taken. Verse
[1:15:34] 24. So he drove out the man,
[1:15:39] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:15:42] of Eden cherubims and flaming sword
[1:15:46] which turn every way to keep the way of
[1:15:50] the tree of life.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Man
[1:15:56] was kicked out of the garden.
[1:15:59] He was sent packing out of the garden.
[1:16:02] But God did not take his holy spirit
[1:16:05] away.
[1:16:06] He sent cherubims
[1:16:09] and flaming s to keep the way of the
[1:16:13] tree of life.
[1:16:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit has always been
[1:16:23] around.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:28] It was the Holy Spirit in Moses
[1:16:31] when he stood before Pharaoh
[1:16:34] and he said, "Let my people go."
[1:16:38] And then he called place upon place
[1:16:41] because no man could do that.
[1:16:45] It was the Holy Spirit in Joshua when he
[1:16:48] spoke to the sun and the moon and the
[1:16:50] thought.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; No man could do that. When he spoke to
[1:16:55] the moon and the sun,
[1:16:57] I believe they heard the voice of God.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The voice that created them, the voice
[1:17:03] that brought them into being. When they
[1:17:06] heard that voice, they said, "Oh, our
[1:17:08] creator has spoken." They had no choice
[1:17:10] but to obey.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; It was God, the Holy Spirit in Joshua.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It was God
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; in Elijah
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; when he said there would not be rain or
[1:17:23] deal until I called for it.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; No man could do that.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; It was God in something.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he was just one
[1:17:34] tiny man.
[1:17:36] But any time the spirit of God came upon
[1:17:39] him,
[1:17:41] he was a different character.
[1:17:44] It was the Holy Spirit at work.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Spirit in the prophets.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit has been working.
[1:17:56] We just come
[1:17:59] do exploits, take a man, work with him.
[1:18:03] He doesn't come in to dwell
[1:18:07] to stay
[1:18:10] because
[1:18:12] men
[1:18:14] had sinned.
[1:18:20] Man was supposed to eat of that tree of
[1:18:22] life and to live forever. But man chose
[1:18:28] to eat the tree of death. Death set in
[1:18:33] So even though the Holy Spirit would
[1:18:36] come down and do exploits, come down and
[1:18:40] work in men, but he wouldn't come in the
[1:18:44] man and stay or reside.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit
[1:18:53] has always been around
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:19] Now
[1:19:22] things are going to change
[1:19:26] that at the Jordan
[1:19:29] When the Lord Jesus
[1:19:33] was being baptized
[1:19:35] by John the Baptist,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost came down like a dove
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; to dwell
[1:19:44] in the man Jesus.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that has always been
[1:19:53] around.
[1:19:55] The Holy Spirit that was always working
[1:19:57] in man
[1:19:59] but would not dwell in.
[1:20:02] Now at the baptism of the Lord Jesus,
[1:20:06] here comes the Holy Ghost coming down.
[1:20:09] And then the Holy Ghost just came down.
[1:20:12] And there was a voice
[1:20:15] that spoke from heaven.
[1:20:17] This is my beloved son
[1:20:21] in whom
[1:20:22] I am well pleased.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost in the Lord Jesus
[1:20:31] that spoke with the authority that he
[1:20:33] spoke.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost in the Lord Jesus
[1:20:40] healing the sick
[1:20:42] and performing all diverse miracles. It
[1:20:45] was the Holy Ghost in him
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; because he said I do nothing.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; But what the father shows me.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It was the father in him and the father
[1:20:59] is the holy ghost.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It was the holy ghost in him that raised
[1:21:06] the dead back to life.
[1:21:09] When he stood at Lazarus's grave and he
[1:21:12] called Lazarus,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Lazarus heard the name of the father. He
[1:21:17] heard the voice of the father.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And that day is coming.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; When we shall gather together by his
[1:21:26] throne.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And hear the voice of God,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; we would know, oh, I have known this
[1:21:31] voice.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You would know that was not the first
[1:21:35] time. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You will know that oh I have done this
[1:21:39] voice all along.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; When Lazarus heard that voice,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; oh my master has spoken. He has called
[1:21:48] Lazarus come out.
[1:21:51] It was the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; the father in him
[1:21:58] that was doing all the miracles.
[1:22:02] John 3:3
[1:22:07] The Lord Jesus told Nicodemus,
[1:22:10] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[1:22:14] a man be born
[1:22:19] again, he cannot see the kingdom of God,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; except a man be born again."
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Except a man
[1:22:38] be born
[1:22:40] again.
[1:22:42] Underline that.
[1:22:44] Now
[1:22:49] then he went on to ask,
[1:22:52] can a man go back into his mother's womb
[1:22:55] the second time and be born again?
[1:23:04] Except a man be born again. Now
[1:23:10] in this flesh,
[1:23:14] in this flesh
[1:23:18] there is no again
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; in this flesh.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; From glory
[1:23:29] We have stepped in this flesh
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and we are going to live in this flesh
[1:23:36] only once
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; and we are going to step out of it
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; in this flesh.
[1:23:45] there isn't again.
[1:23:48] It is a one-time experience in this
[1:23:52] flesh.
[1:23:55] The new birth
[1:23:57] which is the Holy Ghost baptism is not
[1:24:00] consecutive to this flesh.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; You cannot be born again in this flesh.
[1:24:07] The Lord Jesus in Nazareth said that
[1:24:09] which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:24:13] and that which is born of the spirit
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; is spirit.
[1:24:18] Nicodemus was trying to confuse the two.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He had to just separate them.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is
[1:24:27] flesh. That which is born of the spirit
[1:24:30] is spirit. Praise the Lord. Now
[1:24:34] the word again means
[1:24:38] once more.
[1:24:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:43] Is used to indicate
[1:24:46] that something is repeated
[1:24:50] or returned to its previous state.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; How many are follow?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] The word again means once more.
[1:25:11] Something has repeated.
[1:25:15] In other words, it is not happening for
[1:25:17] the first time.
[1:25:20] It must have happened before
[1:25:26] else the word again
[1:25:29] would not be applied.
[1:25:34] If it has not happened before, the word
[1:25:37] again would not be applied.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; So it's happened before.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was driving with
[1:25:49] Emmanuel and Godfield. They were behind
[1:25:51] that was in my old bone shaker that um
[1:25:54] that truck that forerunner we were
[1:25:57] driving on um not bus lake somewhere
[1:26:01] there getting to 610 and um I was just
[1:26:05] behind there was traffic and before I
[1:26:08] was aware I was getting so close to the
[1:26:11] other car because the light was on and I
[1:26:14] hit my brake
[1:26:16] and pretty much they just I mean
[1:26:19] everybody Somebody almost jumped out of
[1:26:21] the car and the man was behind. He said,
[1:26:25] "Not again, Dad."
[1:26:31] I said, "Oh,
[1:26:38] when it comes to life that there's no
[1:26:40] small.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Not again, Dad. That means it wasn't
[1:26:49] happening for the first time.
[1:26:54] That means it happened before.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Apparently, I don't keep records,
[1:27:01] but he didn't forget.
[1:27:04] So, anytime you hear the word again,
[1:27:09] that means it's not the first time.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to your house again.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That means I've been there before. Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Can we go to that uh joint? That means
[1:27:22] we have been there before. Praise the
[1:27:25] Lord.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; This means a lot.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; This is where the Holy Spirit just
[1:27:30] grabbed my attention. That's why I'm
[1:27:32] emphasizing on this and I don't know how
[1:27:35] else I can emphasize on it more than I'm
[1:27:38] doing. Else I would. So keep that in
[1:27:40] mind. So in other words,
[1:27:44] it is an experience
[1:27:46] that is returning you
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; to a previous state.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; It is returning you to a previous state.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; So what does it mean to be born again?
[1:28:08] Now the new birth is the spirit of God
[1:28:10] in your soul. So to be born again is an
[1:28:14] experience
[1:28:16] that is bringing you back to life again.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; He is the tree of life
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; which man was supposed to eat and live
[1:28:27] forever
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; but instead
[1:28:30] men chose to eat from the tree of
[1:28:34] knowledge of good and evil. That was
[1:28:36] where death set in.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Man
[1:28:45] was given the choice.
[1:28:50] Choose between life and death
[1:28:53] and men chose death
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; because the very day you eat of it, that
[1:28:58] day you shall die.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Men chose death
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and they died.
[1:29:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:29:17] as we said a while ago,
[1:29:19] in the beginning, God said, "Let us make
[1:29:21] man in our own image." So, God created
[1:29:24] man. He was a spirit man.
[1:29:28] The man was created full of life.
[1:29:33] He had the life of God running through
[1:29:37] his veins.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; The spirit man had the dearly of God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Life of his life, spirit of his spirit,
[1:29:47] born of his bone, flesh of his flesh.
[1:29:51] He was the spirit man that was full of
[1:29:55] life. He was eternal as much as God was
[1:30:00] eternal. Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Man was fully aware of himself
[1:30:11] and his God when he was created, he was
[1:30:15] a mini God, vested with power and
[1:30:18] authority. So much so that even when God
[1:30:22] placed him in the flesh, that did not
[1:30:25] change.
[1:30:28] that he could just go to bed and wake up
[1:30:30] in the morning and then uh there he's
[1:30:33] trying to look for the sun and then
[1:30:34] there's a mountain in the way said no
[1:30:36] come on move go to the right and the
[1:30:39] mountains will obey
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; so man was fully alive
[1:30:50] he was alive
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we think to be alive is
[1:31:02] to have to be breathing air, oxygen in
[1:31:05] your nostrils and then you on your feet
[1:31:07] going up and down. That is no life.
[1:31:12] Without Christ, that is no life.
[1:31:17] You can be alive
[1:31:20] and yet you are dead.
[1:31:26] You can be alive and yet you are dead.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; So it is not
[1:31:34] taking in oxygen breathing in and out.
[1:31:36] No, that is no life.
[1:31:45] In sin did my mother conceive me?
[1:31:51] Every man born into this world was born
[1:31:55] directly into sin. And sin is the sting
[1:31:59] of death.
[1:32:02] Sin is the sting of death. So we were
[1:32:05] born directly into sin.
[1:32:09] As a matter of fact,
[1:32:11] any man born into this life
[1:32:14] was born directly.
[1:32:17] It was it was how do I call it? A death
[1:32:21] sentence.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; A death sentence on arrival.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; But the the the the the sin sin is such
[1:32:32] a dangerous thing. So dangerous that it
[1:32:35] did not only affect our relationship
[1:32:37] with God, but it affected all the
[1:32:40] creations.
[1:32:43] The animals that were living in harmony
[1:32:45] now started running after each other to
[1:32:47] swallow them, to eat them up.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Everything changed.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Sin is a dangerous thing.
[1:33:03] We were born
[1:33:05] directly into death. into death.
[1:33:12] And I think
[1:33:14] that the sin
[1:33:17] impaired our way of reasoning so much so
[1:33:24] that we human beings rejoice
[1:33:26] when a man is born
[1:33:29] and the day they die we cry.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Is that a normal thing?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:33:38] A baby is born. Instead of you rejoicing
[1:33:41] for that baby, you go and stand and you
[1:33:43] are crying
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; and then you wear morning clothes.
[1:33:47] All the way some the day somebody dies,
[1:33:51] you don't cry. You are you you put on
[1:33:53] white and then you are laughing and
[1:33:56] praising God and jubilating. They'll say
[1:33:58] you are mad.
[1:34:01] But probably that is the way
[1:34:04] things were supposed to be.
[1:34:07] That a man is born into death
[1:34:12] and then we rejoice
[1:34:15] and then the man comes into this life.
[1:34:18] They give their life to Christ. They
[1:34:20] repent. They receive God. They receive
[1:34:23] the Holy Ghost. They are at peace with
[1:34:25] God. And the day they leave this earth,
[1:34:28] then we are crying and mourning as if
[1:34:30] the world has come to an end. But that
[1:34:32] is what sin has done to us as a people.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; That even though we have believed in
[1:34:38] God,
[1:34:40] that we know when we stand with by the
[1:34:42] grace of God and we know that when we
[1:34:45] come to the end of the road, praise the
[1:34:47] Lord,
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; that that is not the end of life, we are
[1:34:51] going to live again. Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Yet still,
[1:34:57] yet still
[1:34:59] when somebody passes,
[1:35:02] it is not an easy feeling.
[1:35:05] It is not.
[1:35:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; So
[1:35:16] when God created a spirit man, he was
[1:35:19] fully alive.
[1:35:21] fully completely alive.
[1:35:25] When the fall happened,
[1:35:28] any man that was born
[1:35:32] according to the desire of man was born
[1:35:36] into what? Sin. Was born into death.
[1:35:41] Remember sin is the sting of death. That
[1:35:45] was why Paul could ask that all death,
[1:35:48] what is the sting?
[1:35:50] old grave. What is thy victory?
[1:35:53] Praise the Lord. Because there is life
[1:35:57] beyond the grave. We are no longer at
[1:36:00] the mercy of sin.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you sin, it's a
[1:36:05] choice you have made.
[1:36:08] It's a choice.
[1:36:12] We've been given enough power and
[1:36:13] authority
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; to bring the devil under our feet,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; to bring sin under our feet,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; to bring our desires under our feet.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; We've been given power and authority.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; We are getting there.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:36:34] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:36:36] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:36:38] have everlasting life. Now, when John
[1:36:43] was in the spirit on the Lord's day,
[1:36:47] and he saw that there was no man that
[1:36:51] was worthy to take the book from the
[1:36:53] hand of him that sat on the throne, and
[1:36:56] to loosen the seals thereof, and he
[1:36:58] started crying. And one of the elders
[1:37:00] told him, "No, don't cry, for the lion
[1:37:02] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to
[1:37:04] take the book, and to open the seals
[1:37:06] thereof." When he looked, what did he
[1:37:08] see? He saw a bloody lamb
[1:37:12] right in the midst of the throne.
[1:37:18] Right in the midst of the throne,
[1:37:23] God sent his son to die for you and me.
[1:37:28] And that happened a little over 2,000
[1:37:31] years ago.
[1:37:33] A little over 2,000 years ago. that he
[1:37:37] died before the foundation of the world
[1:37:45] on God's calendar.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It was gone. It was done.
[1:37:56] That was why when he came, brother Bar
[1:37:58] said he could have chosen to stay and
[1:38:00] raise a family.
[1:38:03] But with you and me on his mind,
[1:38:08] knowing the purpose that brought him
[1:38:09] here and that he was here to serve the
[1:38:12] purpose of God to do the will of the
[1:38:14] father. When he prayed, he said,
[1:38:17] "Father, not my will but your will be
[1:38:20] done."
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And the will of the father concerning
[1:38:23] him was that it was already done.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So long as God was concerned, that was
[1:38:30] settled before the foundation of the
[1:38:32] world.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And he had to die for you and me.
[1:38:37] The lamb was slain
[1:38:40] before the foundation of the world. Not
[1:38:42] 2,000 years ago.
[1:38:46] The atonement was made before the
[1:38:49] foundation of the world.
[1:38:52] He knew us before the foundation of the
[1:38:55] world.
[1:38:57] We were saved
[1:39:00] before the foundation of the world.
[1:39:03] God asked Job, "Where were you when the
[1:39:06] sons of God shouted for joy?"
[1:39:10] Before the foundation of the world.
[1:39:15] Before the foundation of the world,
[1:39:17] where were you when the sons of God
[1:39:20] shouted for joy?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We are seated here and we don't remember
[1:39:26] it
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; that before the foundation of the world,
[1:39:29] we shouted for joy.
[1:39:32] Yet we don't remember it.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; But the day is coming
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; when we shall know
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; that. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Before there was a foundation of this
[1:39:43] world, my soul was saved.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And there is nothing in this world of
[1:39:51] time
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; that can change that.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing can change that.
[1:40:06] Where were you
[1:40:08] when the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:40:10] before the foundation of the world? You
[1:40:11] may have accepted Christ maybe a year
[1:40:13] ago, maybe 10 years ago or 20 years ago,
[1:40:16] but before the foundation of the world,
[1:40:19] you were already in him.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:25] Everything
[1:40:27] you go through in this life
[1:40:30] can only bring you back
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; to who you really are.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; If you are predestinated unto life,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; nothing can change it.
[1:40:47] You were not only called to a finished
[1:40:50] work,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; but you are a finished work yourself.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; You are a finished work.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; You are a finished work.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I am a finished work.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We are a finished work
[1:41:13] by grace. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:17] To every child of God, there is an
[1:41:20] appointed season.
[1:41:23] When that season does not come, the
[1:41:25] devil can just play you around.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; He can just toss you from left to right.
[1:41:31] Just play you like the way we used to
[1:41:33] play soccer back home.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Just play it into the swamp. Go get it.
[1:41:40] Bring it back. And play it against the
[1:41:41] wall.
[1:41:43] Bring it back. play it till it's tearing
[1:41:46] apart. You stitch it together and play
[1:41:48] it till it cannot be played anymore.
[1:41:52] That is what the devil will do to you
[1:41:54] when that time has not come.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; But when that season comes,
[1:42:01] when that season comes and the word of
[1:42:05] God strikes your soul,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It brings you to your reality.
[1:42:14] Praise the Lord. It brings you to your
[1:42:17] reality.
[1:42:20] And nothing, absolutely nothing can
[1:42:23] change that. Just like the the the eagle
[1:42:25] in the hands coop. The eagle didn't know
[1:42:28] who he was. He was just with the hands
[1:42:31] and the chicken in the in the in the h
[1:42:33] coop scratching the ground. It was
[1:42:36] trying to pick some grains because of
[1:42:38] the beak. It wouldn't be able to pick
[1:42:40] it. And the rest were laughing at it. He
[1:42:42] didn't even know who he was
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; until one day he hear a heard a cry of
[1:42:49] mama eagle
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; screaming in the air
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; that you are not a hen you are not a
[1:42:56] chicken you are an eagle
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; you don't belong there you belong here
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; and when the baby eagle saw mama eagle
[1:43:05] in the air he just flapped the wings
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; and probably the first time it dropped
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; try to flop. Oh, it dropped again. Mama,
[1:43:14] how can I say? Don't worry.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I just want you to know that you are an
[1:43:18] eagle and not a chicken.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm coming back again.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And all the time, baby was there. Said,
[1:43:28] "Oh, I now know why.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Something has happened in here.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; I know who I am.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I know where I belong.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I am not a part of this
[1:43:38] group. just there waiting because mama
[1:43:42] is going to come again.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And praise the Lord.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Mama Eagle comes around again.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; And then he had a scream in the air.
[1:43:50] Just looked in the air. Oh, he said,
[1:43:52] "Mom, I'm here." Say, "Okay, just flap
[1:43:54] your wings this time. Try." He just
[1:43:57] tried. And then he come on 10 ft up. Oh,
[1:43:59] praise the Lord. Kept going. 20 ft. Kept
[1:44:02] going till it got lost in the sky.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; It is not your doing.
[1:44:10] It is God doing it.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; When you hear that voice
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; and that voice strikes you,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; your life will never go back the same.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You will never be the same again.
[1:44:34] He is the author and finisher of our
[1:44:37] faith.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; To be born again
[1:44:41] is an experience taking you back
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; to who you really were.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. before the foundation of the
[1:44:49] world.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; To that man, that spirit man of Genesis
[1:44:57] 126:27,
[1:45:00] that's your spirit man.
[1:45:03] That is the life of God. Brother said
[1:45:06] that
[1:45:08] we had the Holy Ghost before the
[1:45:10] foundation of the world.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And also say that eternal life
[1:45:21] is a perfect circle.
[1:45:24] It is a perfect circle.
[1:45:27] It is a perfect circle. So this is where
[1:45:31] I am.
[1:45:34] And I moved from here.
[1:45:37] It doesn't matter where life takes me.
[1:45:41] It doesn't matter whether I go down, I
[1:45:43] go up.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
[1:45:47] whether I am half dead or half alive.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But eventually,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; God has designed it.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That I am going to come back here.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; It's a perfect circle
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; because this is where I belong.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He is the author and the finisher of our
[1:46:08] faith. Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; He is the author and the finisher of our
[1:46:12] lives.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; He is going to bring you and me to an
[1:46:17] expected end.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop the program of God.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Eternal life
[1:46:27] is a perfect circle.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:36] And the Holy Ghost is the life of God in
[1:46:38] you.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And that is a mystery
[1:46:45] that God and man,
[1:46:48] God and man have become one.
[1:46:57] God and man have become one.
[1:47:00] The Lord Jesus said, "At that day ye
[1:47:04] shall know that I am in the father and
[1:47:07] ye in me and I in you." Praise the Lord.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that you become a spirit
[1:47:16] for that matter. No, we are still in
[1:47:19] this flesh.
[1:47:22] But the Bible says we are already
[1:47:25] seated in heavenly places
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus.
[1:47:33] And it is not a time to be reckless.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I have the Holy Ghost. I can
[1:47:40] misbehave. I can go anywhere. I can talk
[1:47:43] anyhow. I can sit anywhere. I can dress
[1:47:45] anyhow. No.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; It calls for caution.
[1:47:54] It doesn't mean you have to be reckless.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; When you see somebody say they have the
[1:47:58] Holy Ghost and they can do things
[1:48:00] contrary to scriptures, it shows they
[1:48:02] don't have him.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Because if you have the Holy Ghost, the
[1:48:07] Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] will direct your footsteps.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not allow you to do
[1:48:14] something that he will not do.
[1:48:18] The Holy Ghost will not send you to
[1:48:20] places where he would not go.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not make you to say
[1:48:27] things he will not say.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; He is going to dominate your life so
[1:48:32] much so
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; that people will look at your life and
[1:48:36] see God in there.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; It calls for a sovereign moment, a life
[1:48:45] that is dedicated to the word that you
[1:48:48] feed on the word and nothing but the
[1:48:50] word.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes in, you are a
[1:48:56] carrier of his life.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; It is no longer you that liveth
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; but Christ that lives in you.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; You are carrying the seed. You are
[1:49:08] carrying the life of God in you.
[1:49:10] Much like a mother that is pregnant with
[1:49:14] a child,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; once you are carrying that child, the
[1:49:19] way you used to dress, you don't dress
[1:49:20] like that anymore.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Even those that still believe in wearing
[1:49:26] pants and then they put under their
[1:49:28] belt,
[1:49:29] you can't dress that way anymore
[1:49:33] because the baby will not allow you.
[1:49:35] There is a life in you that will not
[1:49:37] allow you.
[1:49:39] Some will just wear the heel just as
[1:49:43] long as this.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You can't wear those heels anymore.
[1:49:48] Why? Because you are carrying life.
[1:49:53] So you can't wear that anymore.
[1:49:57] Some wear tight clothes, you can't wear
[1:49:59] them anymore. Why? Because you are
[1:50:02] carrying life.
[1:50:04] Some there is food they love so much
[1:50:07] that they have to eat it every single
[1:50:09] day of their lives.
[1:50:12] They will eat that and they have to go
[1:50:13] and throw it out. Why? Because there is
[1:50:17] life in them and the life in them
[1:50:19] doesn't want that food. Yeah.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; So even the food you are eating, you are
[1:50:24] eating it
[1:50:26] not to please yourself
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; but
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; because of the life in you
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; to are making that adjustment.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; There are mothers that probably they
[1:50:38] will they will not even sleep.
[1:50:41] They will go to the nightclubs and do
[1:50:42] things. But this time you are so humble
[1:50:47] that you are home. You don't even go
[1:50:50] anywhere. You don't even desire it.
[1:50:53] 8:00 you are in bed.
[1:50:58] Nothing bothers I mean you don't want to
[1:51:00] go anywhere. Why? Because you are
[1:51:02] carrying life.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And when you are carrying the life of
[1:51:08] Christ,
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; it soers you.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It takes away every pride.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; It humbles you.
[1:51:17] It will make you speak right.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; It will make you think right.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; It will make you behave right.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; It will make you dress right.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are carrying the life
[1:51:30] of God in you.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; It is no longer you that liveth, but
[1:51:37] Christ that lives in you.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] Ye must be born again.
[1:51:49] You must be born again.
[1:51:53] It is a father's good pleasure
[1:51:56] to give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:03] It is the father's good pleasure to give
[1:52:06] you the Holy Ghost
[1:52:10] because he said in his word that in the
[1:52:13] last day I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:52:17] all flesh.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask him.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't. Now, even the disciples, the
[1:52:27] 120 that were in the upper room,
[1:52:29] when the Lord Jesus told them to gather
[1:52:32] there, they didn't even ask him for the
[1:52:34] Holy Ghost.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; He told them because he knew the
[1:52:39] challenges of their time and what they
[1:52:41] were going to go through.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; He knew what they needed.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; God said, "Gather there. Carry ye
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; in the city of Jerusalem. Don't depart.
[1:52:53] until you are endued with power and
[1:52:56] authority from on high
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; and you think that you as a son or a
[1:53:03] daughter of God that you can ask for the
[1:53:06] Holy Ghost and God will not give him to
[1:53:08] you.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Then why would God make that promise?
[1:53:14] Why would God make that promise only to
[1:53:18] deny his children of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:21] knowing that that is the only thing we
[1:53:23] need to be successful in our walk with
[1:53:26] him?
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; If men being evil know how to give good
[1:53:34] gifts unto their children, how much more
[1:53:37] would our heavenly father give the Holy
[1:53:39] Spirit to them that ask him for?
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] God
[1:53:49] thinks of us more than we ever do.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; It is the father's good pleasure
[1:54:06] to give you
[1:54:09] the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:21] Except a man be born again,
[1:54:25] he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[1:54:37] Brother Brandham said
[1:54:39] that God is more willing
[1:54:43] to give you the Holy Ghost, the Holy
[1:54:46] Spirit, the same thing. Then you are
[1:54:50] ready to receive him.
[1:54:55] Sometimes you think, "Oh, I have prayed
[1:54:57] enough. I have prayed for far too long.
[1:54:59] I've been crying out to God. Oh, to
[1:55:02] baptize me, give me the Holy Ghost, and
[1:55:04] nothing is happening."
[1:55:06] Do you think you need the Holy Ghost
[1:55:09] more than God is willing to give him to
[1:55:11] you?
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; God is willing to give you the Holy
[1:55:16] Spirit more than you are willing.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; The problem is not with God.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; The problem is with men.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; It is not how long you've been in
[1:55:30] church.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; It's not how long you've been around the
[1:55:33] message.
[1:55:36] There are people around this message
[1:55:39] that probably behave worse than the
[1:55:42] people we call unbelievers.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; They have come to the knowledge of the
[1:55:47] truth and yet
[1:55:50] the word has not taken effect in their
[1:55:52] lives.
[1:55:57] It's not how long.
[1:56:00] No.
[1:56:03] When your heart is right,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Christ is going to come in any
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; inside there is not clean enough.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; There are a lot of things you have to
[1:56:18] deal with. You have to wash. You have to
[1:56:20] just allow yourself
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; to be cleansed.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Before he can come in.
[1:56:32] So God wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:56:39] more than you are willing
[1:56:42] to receive him.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:56:57] if all we have
[1:57:08] So remember
[1:57:13] that it is not our strength
[1:57:17] because we don't have it.
[1:57:20] It is not our personal righteousness.
[1:57:23] We don't have it.
[1:57:26] It is not about what we can do.
[1:57:29] because we can do nothing.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; We are dependent on him.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; And Christ died to have you and me.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of him dying so he
[1:57:46] can have you and me.
[1:57:51] You see why he will not deny you his
[1:57:53] Holy Ghost?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:58] He left his glory above.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Came into this life,
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; took upon himself a human veil, walked
[1:58:05] this earth.
[1:58:07] Everything he went through,
[1:58:10] everything he went through,
[1:58:13] his death on the cross,
[1:58:16] the humiliation,
[1:58:20] the persecution,
[1:58:23] everything he went through, the reproach
[1:58:27] because of you and me.
[1:58:30] And you think that God would give his
[1:58:34] only begotten son
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; for our sake and the same God would turn
[1:58:40] around
[1:58:42] and close the door on us.
[1:58:48] We throw God out. God doesn't throw his
[1:58:52] own out.
[1:58:54] that he stands at the door and knock
[1:58:58] pleading to come in.
[1:59:02] Why? Because we have cast him out.
[1:59:06] He is pleading to come in. If any man
[1:59:12] would open the door,
[1:59:15] he will come in and suck with him.
[1:59:20] God never throws his own out.
[1:59:24] We human
[1:59:26] who throw God out and even when we have
[1:59:29] thrown him out
[1:59:31] because he so much desires that
[1:59:34] relationship,
[1:59:36] he still cannot go. He comes back
[1:59:40] knocking at the door
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; pleading to come in.
[1:59:46] the King of glory, the Lord of laws, the
[1:59:50] Almighty God,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; knocking at the door of your heart and
[1:59:54] pleading
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; to come in.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; If you turn such a God down,
[2:00:09] if you turn him down
[2:00:12] on that day, what is going to be your
[2:00:14] excuse?
[2:00:16] For God is so good.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord our God is so good.
[2:00:24] There is a song that says, "God is so
[2:00:27] good." Yeah, I wish to sing that song.
[2:00:29] We come to the end of
[2:00:31] the Lord our God is so so good.
[2:00:41] He doesn't want any man to perish.
[2:00:46] But that we all
[2:00:49] may come onto repentance.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; If a man goes to hell, it is not God
[2:00:56] that has put that man in hell.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:01:03] God does not decide to see any man in
[2:01:06] hell.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Hell was prepared for Satan and his
[2:01:11] angels.
[2:01:13] If you go to hell, it's a choice you
[2:01:16] have made.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; But the Lord our God is so so so good.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Christ died for you and me. He rose from
[2:01:31] the dead to live again.
[2:01:33] This time in you and me.
[2:01:36] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:40] You know when
[2:01:42] he has come in,
[2:01:45] you will know it. It is not something
[2:01:48] that is hidden.
[2:01:53] If all we have
[2:01:57] of his resurrection,
[2:02:00] If all we have of his res resurrection
[2:02:03] is an empty tomb,
[2:02:08] which is good,
[2:02:12] but
[2:02:14] of what is it?
[2:02:17] If that is all we have,
[2:02:20] the evidence that he rose from the dead
[2:02:24] and is alive
[2:02:27] is the Holy Ghost baptism in you and me.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; That is the evidence that Christ rose
[2:02:33] from the dead.
[2:02:36] He rose from the dead.
[2:02:40] The evidence that he is alive today
[2:02:45] is you and me.
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; We are the evidence of his resurrection.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; We live in him. We talk like him. We
[2:03:04] walk like him. We see through his eyes.
[2:03:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:09] So do not stop at an the empty tomb.
[2:03:15] Don't stop there because more than an
[2:03:19] empty tomb is a risen savior.
[2:03:22] And more than a risen savior is the Holy
[2:03:24] Ghost. The same spirit.
[2:03:29] The same spirit that came up from 120.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; The same spirit
[2:03:36] that raised Christ from the dead.
[2:03:40] The same spirit,
[2:03:42] not a second person, not a third person.
[2:03:46] Ye must be born again.
[2:03:51] It is of utmost necessity.
[2:03:57] It is of utmost importance.
[2:04:03] And when the Holy Ghost comes in,
[2:04:07] praise the Lord.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; The devil knows
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; you don't belong to him.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:19] When he died on the cross,
[2:04:21] he died with you and me in him.
[2:04:25] Don't worry
[2:04:28] how you are going to overcome the world.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Don't worry how you are going to
[2:04:35] overcome sin.
[2:04:37] If he died with you in him, you are
[2:04:41] going to die to this world.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; It is not your choice.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; It's not your choice.
[2:04:52] If he died with you, in him you would
[2:04:56] die to sin.
[2:05:00] And if he rose from the dead with you,
[2:05:03] because when he died, he died with us.
[2:05:05] When he rose, he rose with us.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; That we are seated in heavenly places
[2:05:09] already.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And if he rose with you, you are going
[2:05:15] to rise above sin.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; You will rise above the circumstance of
[2:05:19] our time. Amen.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; You will rise above them.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Again, it is not your choice.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; It's something the Lord our God has
[2:05:30] done.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; If we can only just fall in the right
[2:05:35] frequency.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; If we can fall right in there,
[2:05:42] we will see the glory of God in a way we
[2:05:45] have never dreamed of.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] Ye must be born again.
[2:06:00] It is not about you living habits.
[2:06:03] It's not about you living habits.
[2:06:07] How do I live this? How do I stop this?
[2:06:11] It's not about you.
[2:06:15] A lot of the times
[2:06:18] people will leave something
[2:06:21] and then they go back for it.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; They left it. If you leave a habit, you
[2:06:30] can go back for it.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; But when that habit leaves you,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You will look for it and never find it.
[2:06:40] Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you want to trace the steps
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; and you can't find it because
[2:06:49] it left you and it left you for good.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; What we need some of the times is just
[2:06:59] to stay on God's grail for just a little
[2:07:03] bit longer
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; and get baked. Just get baked and stop
[2:07:09] the complaining.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Just get begged a little more.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask the devil to get
[2:07:17] out.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; The devil is going to jump out
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; because life is going to be so
[2:07:21] uncomfortable.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; He can't stand it.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] He will jump out for his dear life
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; because that life is so filled with the
[2:07:33] word
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; so filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; That word
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; is no longer you but Christ in you.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; that the devil cannot stand that heat.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; There is power in the word of God.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; There is power. So much power in the
[2:07:56] word.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know what happens when you
[2:08:00] keep feeding on the word.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; You don't know. But something happens
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; when you eat. All you know you are
[2:08:09] eating to satisfy your hungry stomach.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Is there anything that shows you the
[2:08:15] food you have eaten 10% is going to the
[2:08:18] brain, 10% to the muscles? No. You are
[2:08:22] not even conscious of it. But something
[2:08:25] is happening.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; And also when you starve yourself and
[2:08:31] you are so hungry and thirsty,
[2:08:35] your system begins to shut down. That is
[2:08:38] how it is in the spiritual realm that
[2:08:41] when you are not feeding on the word of
[2:08:44] God, men shall not live by bread alone
[2:08:47] but by every word that proceeds out of
[2:08:50] the mouth of God. If you are not feeling
[2:08:53] on the word, you are starving your soul
[2:08:56] to death.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel it.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; It is the reality.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; And when you are feeding on the word,
[2:09:10] something good is happening.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; You may not see it.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to see it.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Know ye not that ye are the temple of
[2:09:31] the Holy Ghost? For God does not dwell
[2:09:34] in temples made of human beings. We are
[2:09:37] the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; The temple of God. The temple of God is
[2:09:42] not this building.
[2:09:44] And think about it.
[2:09:47] We give a lot of respect
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; to this place, don't we?
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because this is a place we come to serve
[2:09:54] our God. We come to hear from God. We
[2:09:56] come to worship God.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; And when we walk in here, we have some
[2:10:01] reverence, some respect for this place.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, God does not reside here.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; This is not the temple where God lives.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; God lives in you and
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; we are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:16] Ask yourself,
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; do you treat yourself
[2:10:20] with that reverence
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; knowing that there is a God who resides
[2:10:25] in there?
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Do you treat that God with respect so
[2:10:31] much so that you reverence
[2:10:34] that temple, the temple which you are,
[2:10:38] knowing that there is a God in you and I
[2:10:41] will not use this God to go and do this.
[2:10:44] I will not drink because no the God in
[2:10:48] me will not like it. I will not do this
[2:10:51] because the God in me will not like it.
[2:10:54] I am the temple of the Holy Ghost. I
[2:10:56] will not go here because he wouldn't
[2:10:58] want it. Do we have that reverence?
[2:11:02] Do we have that reverence?
[2:11:05] Do we have that respect?
[2:11:12] We are the temple
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:17] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wants to come in.
[2:11:34] The Holy Spirit, the musicians can come.
[2:11:36] The Holy Spirit wants to come in.
[2:11:41] He is just sitting
[2:11:44] looking in
[2:11:49] probably waiting
[2:11:53] for one thing you have to make right in
[2:11:57] your life.
[2:12:00] He is probably sitting and waiting
[2:12:03] probably for one thing,
[2:12:06] one action
[2:12:08] you have to take.
[2:12:10] He's probably sitting and waiting
[2:12:13] for one step you have to take.
[2:12:19] Just waiting for the right moment to
[2:12:21] come in.
[2:12:22] And sometimes we get so close
[2:12:26] instead of taking that one step before
[2:12:29] we realize we take two, three, four
[2:12:32] steps backward.
[2:12:34] And now it becomes more of a difficult
[2:12:38] task.
[2:12:41] The Holy Ghost
[2:12:44] is waiting to come.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Are you getting yourself prepared for
[2:12:49] the Holy Ghost to come? Because God
[2:12:52] would not lose anyone of his own.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; He must be born again.
[2:13:02] God has to carry you back
[2:13:05] to who you really were before the
[2:13:08] foundation of this world.
[2:13:11] You must be born again.
[2:13:14] This is not who you are.
[2:13:18] God is determined
[2:13:21] to restore you
[2:13:23] to who you were before this work began.
[2:13:27] You must be born again.
[2:13:32] You must be born again.
[2:13:35] God cannot afford to lose you.
[2:13:38] By one spirit are we baptized into one
[2:13:42] body.
[2:13:44] We are all a part of him.
[2:13:50] That body of Christ is a complete body.
[2:13:55] That body cannot
[2:13:58] be deformed.
[2:14:01] It cannot be deformed.
[2:14:05] It cannot be deformed.
[2:14:08] Every part of that body will be there.
[2:14:12] That body is a complete body. Every
[2:14:15] member of the body will be present.
[2:14:19] So being born again is a must.
[2:14:25] It's not a choice you have to make. It's
[2:14:28] a must.
[2:14:31] It's not something you have to think of.
[2:14:33] It's a must.
[2:14:36] It's not something
[2:14:41] to decide on. It's a must. It's already
[2:14:46] been decided upon. It's a must.
[2:14:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Nobody can replace you
[2:14:56] in that body.
[2:15:00] To be born again is to return to your
[2:15:04] previous state.
[2:15:07] Who you used to be.
[2:15:11] Who you used to be.
[2:15:16] That son of the living God.
[2:15:20] Spirit of his spirit, born of his bone,
[2:15:24] flesh of his flesh.
[2:15:27] That is who you are.
[2:15:30] That is who you are.
[2:15:35] And God is determined
[2:15:40] more than ever before
[2:15:43] to carry us back
[2:15:50] where we belong. Praise the Lord.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Death would not reign over life.
[2:16:09] The only way death will take over is
[2:16:12] when you reject life.
[2:16:16] And because you have rejected life, what
[2:16:19] is life but death?
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:25] Harden not your heart this day when you
[2:16:27] hear the voice of God.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; God has spoken.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:35] The word of God has come to us.
[2:16:39] Search your hearts.
[2:16:44] It is no longer time to play church.
[2:16:46] Brothers and sisters,
[2:16:50] it could all be over
[2:16:54] before we get home.
[2:16:57] It is no longer time to play church.
[2:17:03] There is only one body
[2:17:06] that is going in the rapture and that is
[2:17:09] the body of Christ. We are all members
[2:17:12] of that body.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; And the only way you get in that body
[2:17:18] is to be born again.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:24] to be born again.
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:33] It is time
[2:17:35] to mean more business with God.
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:40] Age doesn't mean anything to God.
[2:17:45] Age doesn't mean anything to God. To you
[2:17:48] the young ones, age doesn't mean
[2:17:50] anything to God.
[2:17:55] [Music]
[2:17:57] When your heart is right,
[2:17:59] praise the Lord.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; God is going to come in.
[2:18:06] Age doesn't mean anything to God.
[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:18] God can come in any day,
[2:18:23] any hour, any minute, any second,
[2:18:31] any day.
[2:18:33] We are just living
[2:18:36] in a borrowed time. In a borrowed time.
[2:18:40] As a matter of fact,
[2:18:43] all the signs the Bible has given
[2:18:46] concerning the end, they are here with
[2:18:49] us.
[2:18:51] Is there anything you can think of that
[2:18:53] is left?
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:18:59] They are all here with us. We are
[2:19:01] witnesses to them. We are seeing them.
[2:19:06] We are at the very end.
[2:19:13] At the very very very end. Not to scare
[2:19:16] anybody. It is the truth that we are at
[2:19:20] the very end. If there is anything to
[2:19:22] do, you do it now.
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:27] If you have to give your life to Christ,
[2:19:29] you do it now. Amen.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; If you have to repent, you do it now. If
[2:19:36] you have to make a mess with your
[2:19:37] brother, with your sister, you do it
[2:19:39] now.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Because time waits for no man.
[2:19:46] Time waits for no man.
[2:19:52] I want us to talk to God.
[2:19:56] God is a prayer answering God.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:00] I don't know what you had on your heart
[2:20:03] before coming to church this morning,
[2:20:06] but one thing I do know that God has
[2:20:08] spoken.
[2:20:15] The word of God has come to us.
[2:20:19] I would want us to go before his throne
[2:20:21] this morning, this afternoon.
[2:20:23] Talk to God.
[2:20:25] Ask for his mercies.
[2:20:28] ask for his forgiveness.
[2:20:30] [Music]
[2:20:32] Let's pray. Talk to God
[2:20:36] that his word says that we must be born
[2:20:38] again.
[2:20:41] Pray.
[2:20:43] Ask for the Holy Ghost
[2:20:45] because he himself has said in his holy
[2:20:48] word and the word of God is true. God
[2:20:52] does not play with words.
[2:20:55] If men being evil know how to give good
[2:20:57] gifts to their children,
[2:21:00] that they will not give a stone for
[2:21:01] bread or a serpent or snake for fish,
[2:21:06] but would give
[2:21:09] any good thing they have. How much more
[2:21:12] how much more would our heavenly father
[2:21:15] give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him
[2:21:17] for?
[2:21:21] Shall we pray?
[2:21:24] our Lord and our Savior Jesus.
[2:21:29] We thank you for another opportunity to
[2:21:31] come before you, Father, and to hear you
[2:21:34] speak.
[2:21:37] I never thought of this sermon.
[2:21:40] It came to me under a strange
[2:21:42] circumstances and that was not the first
[2:21:44] time and hopefully it will not be the
[2:21:47] last that you have spoken to me, Father.
[2:21:49] In ways like this
[2:21:53] we have encouraged ourselves father this
[2:21:55] afternoon this morning this morning
[2:21:57] afternoon father your word has come to
[2:22:00] us
[2:22:01] we pray committing ourselves into your
[2:22:03] hands father
[2:22:05] we pray that you have mercy upon us
[2:22:08] father please forgive us of all our sins
[2:22:10] oh God father forgive us of all our
[2:22:13] iniquities father forgive us of all our
[2:22:16] evil thoughts
[2:22:18] forgive Forgive us, Father of everything
[2:22:21] in our lives that does not belong. Have
[2:22:25] mercy, Father, have mercy.
[2:22:28] May you temper justice with mercy and
[2:22:31] deal with us, Father, leniently. We pray
[2:22:34] in the name of Jesus.
[2:22:37] And father we pray oh God
[2:22:40] help us Lord
[2:22:42] your prophets said that you are more
[2:22:45] willing to give us the Holy Ghost than
[2:22:49] we are willing.
[2:22:51] We pray father if there are things in
[2:22:54] our lives that are not right
[2:22:56] grant us the grace to make them right.
[2:23:01] Father we place every iniquity under the
[2:23:03] blood. We place every sin under the
[2:23:06] blood. We place, Father, anything,
[2:23:09] Father, anything
[2:23:11] that is in our lives that would hinder
[2:23:14] the Holy Ghost, we place them under the
[2:23:16] blood this moment. And we pray, have
[2:23:19] mercy upon your children. Father, have
[2:23:22] mercy. Lord, have mercy upon your
[2:23:25] children.
[2:23:27] for your word has come to us and we pray
[2:23:31] anoint every soul with your holy spirit
[2:23:34] this moment
[2:23:36] father fill us with your holy spirit
[2:23:38] Lord fill us with your holy spirit
[2:23:43] we yield ourselves to you this moment we
[2:23:46] turn our lives over to you
[2:23:49] fill us with your holy spirit Lord let
[2:23:53] Christ take his place in our souls Amen.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; To use our hands and our feet.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; To use our eyes, our ears, and our lips,
[2:24:02] and our tongue, and our mouth.
[2:24:05] To use us, Father, to the glory of your
[2:24:08] holy name.
[2:24:11] That we can say with Paul, for me to
[2:24:14] live is Christ and to die is gain.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; That we can say that it is no longer I
[2:24:20] that liveth, but Christ that lives in
[2:24:22] me.
[2:24:24] Dear Lord Jesus,
[2:24:26] we are in your hands and
[2:24:29] have mercy upon your children.
[2:24:32] Have mercy, Lord. Have mercy.
[2:24:36] Bless our lives, Lord, and bless our
[2:24:39] souls.
[2:24:42] We are so grateful today, Lord,
[2:24:46] for having this.
[2:24:49] And we pray in the name of Jesus, our
[2:24:52] Lord and Savior.
[2:24:54] that father you will glorify yourself in
[2:24:56] our lives over and over again.
[2:25:00] Thank you so much and praise be to you
[2:25:04] father for having headed up this
[2:25:06] afternoon
[2:25:08] in Jesus name our lord and savior
[2:25:14] praise the lord
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus
[2:25:19] praise the lord

[2:25:28] brother I'll have you come and close
[2:25:30] this prayer session. I mean close this
[2:25:32] time service.

[2:25:45] Let us pray.
[2:25:49] Our eternal father Jehovah, we thank you
[2:25:51] for this time.
[2:25:53] We thank you God for giving us the
[2:25:56] privilege
[2:25:57] to come and listen to your word.
[2:26:00] Bless us abundantly. Oh God, may you
[2:26:03] shower us with your blessing. Heavenly
[2:26:05] Father, we thank you, oh God, for this
[2:26:09] message, oh God. May the message take
[2:26:12] prance in our lives, oh God. Father, be
[2:26:15] with us as we are about to go. May you
[2:26:18] take us through our activities of the
[2:26:21] day.
[2:26:23] Father, we thank you for this time. We
[2:26:26] thank you oh God

[2:26:32] spirit.

[2:27:25] bless you." Hallelujah.
[2:27:28] Hallelujah.
[2:27:30] Amen. We are dismissed. We're going to
[2:27:32] sing a song. If you want to join us in
[2:27:34] singing, God bless you. But we are all
[2:27:36] dismissed this morning. Look,
