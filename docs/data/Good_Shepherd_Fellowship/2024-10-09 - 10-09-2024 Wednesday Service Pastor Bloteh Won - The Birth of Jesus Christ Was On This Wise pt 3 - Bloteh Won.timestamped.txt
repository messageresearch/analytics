[1:01:32] little Direction here now you right here
[1:01:37] you will see where Jeremiah I mean
[1:01:40] Ezekiel is is uh prophesying to Israel
[1:01:44] now he's saying these things to Israel
[1:01:47] reminding them where I took you
[1:01:50] from because if you read the rest of the
[1:01:54] verse you will see that it was not
[1:01:56] pleasant what he said to Israel was not
[1:01:59] pleasant but this this beginning verses
[1:02:02] that we read was to remind Israel where
[1:02:06] I took you
[1:02:08] from and we can apply that to ourself
[1:02:11] tonight praise the
[1:02:14] Lord because every man that is born of a
[1:02:17] woman every natural birth is dcri right
[1:02:20] here in verse 16 when we are birth forth

[1:02:54] chapter let's go to verse chapter uh
[1:02:57] 14 and get a little
[1:03:01] background because Israel has gone into
[1:03:04] so much
[1:03:07] idolatry that God needed to remind them
[1:03:11] in such a graphic
[1:03:14] way he needed to give the prophet such a
[1:03:20] vision to be able to grab their
[1:03:24] attention praise the
[1:03:27] Lord but let's go back and then we read
[1:03:31] a few verses it will it will help us to
[1:03:34] be able to grab uh uh uh let's uh

[1:09:07] upon Jerusalem because of all the
[1:09:10] Abomination and all the evil that they
[1:09:13] have gone they have gone away from God
[1:09:16] praise the Lord and and and and Y said
[1:09:19] that he's bringing it in such a
[1:09:23] way and you will realize that in this in
[1:09:26] this very chapter God repeat this over
[1:09:29] and over that if I'm bringing judgment
[1:09:32] Upon This Land if these three
[1:09:36] men
[1:09:38] Noah Daniel and job if these three men
[1:09:42] were in that
[1:09:44] City St they will not be able to stop my
[1:09:50] wrath they will only be able to save
[1:09:53] themselves by their
[1:09:57] righteousness praise the Lord let's do
[1:10:00] on that a little bit before we get into
[1:10:02] what we want to talk if you really look
[1:10:04] at it you will see there there is there
[1:10:06] is
[1:10:08] similarity about uh uh uh Noah danir and
[1:10:13] job praise the
[1:10:15] Lord
[1:10:19] amen job
[1:10:22] had a trial
[1:10:25] in one sense that you can call a
[1:10:28] judgment that came on a
[1:10:34] household one
[1:10:37] man Daniel was one
[1:10:40] nation Noah was one
[1:10:46] generation praise the
[1:10:48] Lord
[1:10:51] amen there were many famales in the time
[1:10:54] of job
[1:10:56] job was the man that God
[1:11:00] Pi praise the
[1:11:08] Lord and the Bible says there was not a
[1:11:10] man like job on the
[1:11:13] earth and with all the burnt offering he
[1:11:17] did and all the kindness that he did the
[1:11:20] scripture job record will tell you that
[1:11:24] he was so resp Ed that when job got down
[1:11:28] down the street people went to him for
[1:11:32] counsel they met job for counsel advice
[1:11:35] and you know uh
[1:11:37] instruction that's how much he was so
[1:11:40] respected
[1:11:43] but it did not save his sheeps it did
[1:11:46] not save uh his houses it they not save
[1:11:50] even his
[1:11:53] children in one sense
[1:11:57] praise the
[1:11:59] Lord
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:06] hallelujah Daniel was one man in the
[1:12:13] nation praise the Lord that God will
[1:12:16] bring down to
[1:12:19] Babylon and through his uh his Earnest
[1:12:23] praying by that and by night he will
[1:12:27] bring the entire Babylon to realize that
[1:12:31] the god of
[1:12:32] Israel is a living
[1:12:36] God are we
[1:12:39] together Noah will be one man in a
[1:12:44] generation that the Bible was say and
[1:12:46] God found favor with
[1:12:48] Noah and God will instruct him to build
[1:12:52] an
[1:12:53] ark praise the Lord
[1:12:58] Hallelujah but you will realize that
[1:13:01] another thing that is common with this
[1:13:03] man also the Bible called Noah a
[1:13:05] preacher of
[1:13:07] righteousness that his uh uh uh uh uh
[1:13:12] even though his message could not save
[1:13:14] the entire generation just like Jonah
[1:13:17] message saved
[1:13:20] Nevan but Noah stay faithful to the word
[1:13:24] he stayed faithful to whatever God
[1:13:26] because the Bible said for
[1:13:28] 120 years he kept preaching the same
[1:13:34] message he never tried to make it to fit
[1:13:38] the generation of Faith you know the new
[1:13:40] group that came he he he just stay with
[1:13:44] what God told him that there's going to
[1:13:46] be
[1:13:49] rain Hallelujah and his message uh uh uh
[1:13:53] uh uh and his stand for God was able to
[1:13:56] Rob on on on his children and the Bible
[1:13:59] says only eight Souls the Bible call him
[1:14:02] the preacher of
[1:14:05] righteousness and so much that uh and
[1:14:08] the way I think about the preacher of
[1:14:10] righteousness is that uh uh when when
[1:14:13] when when when your life and when your
[1:14:16] testimony can be able to R against your
[1:14:21] household sometimes it's the hardest
[1:14:23] people to convin because they know you
[1:14:26] when you are
[1:14:27] angry they know you when you are not
[1:14:30] happy praise the Lord
[1:14:36] amen but that's part of all your
[1:14:38] mistakes when when God can be able to
[1:14:41] give a Grace word your life can rise up
[1:14:45] so much to a
[1:14:47] place that the people can know that you
[1:14:50] are you are a human you are a man but
[1:14:53] yet by the grace of God God you are
[1:14:56] doing your best to live what the word
[1:14:59] says praise the Lord because there is
[1:15:02] nothing that destroy the family then for
[1:15:05] the man to be professing one thing and
[1:15:07] living another
[1:15:09] thing praise the
[1:15:12] Lord amen oh yeah I mean your children
[1:15:16] are never going to believe
[1:15:18] you it's hard for them to even believe
[1:15:20] the
[1:15:23] preacher it's hard unless God gave them
[1:15:25] a personal revelation it's hard for them
[1:15:27] to believe the
[1:15:29] preacher because the first preacher in
[1:15:31] their life is the parents at
[1:15:34] home the Bible says he's a man of
[1:15:36] righteousness you can also think about
[1:15:39] it Daniel stand robbed against shedra
[1:15:42] mishad and abam job stand for the word
[1:15:46] even though he lost his children but yet
[1:15:48] they were redeemed for him on the other
[1:15:53] side praise Lord but yet God is saying
[1:15:57] if these three
[1:15:59] men you
[1:16:03] see when God raised up a man in a
[1:16:06] generation when God raised up a man in
[1:16:08] an age when God raised up a man in a
[1:16:11] family or in a
[1:16:13] church
[1:16:15] sometimes we get so used you know
[1:16:18] because we are friends we are brothers
[1:16:20] you know uh uh uh uh uh we know where
[1:16:22] the person was born we know their Liv
[1:16:25] you know we saw them walking down the
[1:16:26] street we see when they are broke when
[1:16:28] they were sick and all of that sometimes
[1:16:30] it's hard for us to see how
[1:16:32] God thinks about his
[1:16:35] people but just watch this pattern here
[1:16:38] is here is God bringing
[1:16:41] judgment on uh uh h h h Jerusalem and
[1:16:46] he's taking three righteous men to say
[1:16:50] even if they were living in that time to
[1:16:53] to tell you that God always used that as
[1:16:57] a Pon let's see another example let's go
[1:17:00] to the Book of Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter
[1:17:05] 15 praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter
[1:17:09] 15 I'm just trying to lay a background
[1:17:12] for what I want to say
[1:17:16] tonight Jeremiah chapter 15 let's read
[1:17:18] from verse one then said the Lord unto
[1:17:22] me this is God speaking to jerem IA
[1:17:25] though Moses and Samuel stood before me
[1:17:29] yet yet my mind could not be towards
[1:17:34] this
[1:17:36] people cast them out of my sight and let
[1:17:40] them go forth now to Jeremiah the
[1:17:44] weeping
[1:17:45] prophet crying because the the the the
[1:17:49] vision the instruction of the Captivity
[1:17:52] of the Babylon came to him and yet
[1:17:54] Jeremiah interceding for the people and
[1:17:57] God will raise up two
[1:18:02] Prophet they came right in the time of
[1:18:07] intercession praise the
[1:18:09] Lord when you look at the ministry of
[1:18:12] Moses you look at the ministry of
[1:18:14] Samuel the Bible says when there was no
[1:18:17] open
[1:18:18] Vision every man was doing what was
[1:18:21] right in their
[1:18:23] eyes it was in such a time that God
[1:18:26] raised up a man called Samuel started
[1:18:30] dealing with him from a young
[1:18:33] age praise the Lord so Samuel Ministry
[1:18:38] was was a Ministry of a bridge Samuel
[1:18:42] Ministry he came right in the time of
[1:18:45] the bridge the time of the judges where
[1:18:48] God will now
[1:18:50] change to move into a a a a ising a
[1:18:56] king because it was almost about 10
[1:18:59] generation after they left uh uh uh
[1:19:02] Egypt praise the Lord so Samuel Ministry
[1:19:06] was a Ministry also of of
[1:19:10] intercession he interceded for the
[1:19:12] people just like Moses interceded for
[1:19:15] the people praise the
[1:19:18] Lord Moses got to a place he said Lord
[1:19:22] if you will kill this people then you
[1:19:23] have to you have to first I have to die
[1:19:26] first let me let me die before before
[1:19:28] your wrath touch these
[1:19:30] people but here is
[1:19:33] God going to take these people into
[1:19:37] Babylon and he's saying even if Moses
[1:19:40] and Samuel was here
[1:19:43] interceding praise the
[1:19:50] Lord hallelujah
[1:19:58] sometimes it's hard for us to be able to
[1:20:01] put certain things into
[1:20:03] perspective but let me say this to
[1:20:07] you of all the men and all the prophets
[1:20:10] that ever went into the ministry of
[1:20:12] intercession they were all fulfilling
[1:20:16] Christ you have to remember Jesus wept
[1:20:21] over
[1:20:23] Jerusalem he wept over
[1:20:27] Jerusalem how I will have H
[1:20:31] you but a state did not stop the wrath
[1:20:34] of
[1:20:38] God a state did not stop the wrath of
[1:20:42] God the Bible says h j Esau came and he
[1:20:46] wept before
[1:20:48] Isaac Isaac could not
[1:20:50] turn he could not turn the coast around
[1:20:54] he has already giving the blessing to
[1:20:58] Jacob you see and and I believe that is
[1:21:01] just such a time that we are getting
[1:21:05] into we have we have we have heard you
[1:21:08] know God is a merciful god you know God
[1:21:10] is a gracious God and and and and you
[1:21:12] know and and all of this and and and and
[1:21:14] because of that we we get cheap prayer
[1:21:17] and cheap sandwiches you know we can
[1:21:18] just stand there make confession but I'm
[1:21:20] telling you there are some prayers that
[1:21:22] cannot be heard
[1:21:28] even Jesus cried over Jerusalem because
[1:21:31] he knew how the city was going to be
[1:21:40] ravaged when the people rejected the
[1:21:43] word they rejected the gift that was
[1:21:46] sent to them and they called it
[1:21:49] Bible praise the
[1:21:52] Lord God is saying even if you rais
[1:21:55] Moses and Samuel
[1:21:57] up to intercede for these people nothing
[1:22:01] is going to stop them from going into
[1:22:05] Babylon I have sealed their D now let me
[1:22:08] read something to you here listen to
[1:22:12] this from prophet of God I might I don't
[1:22:15] know if I I will have time to preach
[1:22:17] what I want to preach but let me just
[1:22:19] read this to you from the message
[1:22:20] Jehovah jarro
[1:22:27] see brother B says a similar thing here
[1:22:29] listen to
[1:22:32] this he says we are at the end of the
[1:22:37] road he says a president e in how in
[1:22:42] every city in every country in every
[1:22:45] village in every
[1:22:48] town in this America will never stop
[1:22:53] this ons Slaughter going on of cigarette
[1:22:56] smoking women and drunkers and so
[1:22:59] forth he's talking about how politics
[1:23:04] has been
[1:23:06] corrupted he says take a man like en how
[1:23:11] order George Washington make them the
[1:23:14] governor of every
[1:23:16] city praise the Lord make them uh uh uh
[1:23:20] you know uh uh uh the president of the
[1:23:23] US the system is already
[1:23:27] rotten it has passed
[1:23:35] Grace praise the
[1:23:39] Lord put them in every
[1:23:43] country the corruption of the country
[1:23:46] will not even allow them to survive no
[1:23:49] matter how hard they
[1:23:51] try it's just the same thing that God is
[1:23:53] saying raise up Moses raise up Samuel
[1:23:56] let them intercede for these
[1:23:59] people their wickedness has crossed the
[1:24:05] border there is so far we can
[1:24:12] go are we
[1:24:16] together we are in such a time of
[1:24:20] judgment so he says here it it couldn't
[1:24:23] be done
[1:24:25] in this America will never stop it it uh
[1:24:29] uh onslaught of going going on of
[1:24:32] cigarett smoking and and drunkers and so
[1:24:35] forth it couldn't be done you are going
[1:24:38] to have your own
[1:24:42] way there's a time where God just leave
[1:24:47] the people to
[1:24:49] themselves he just leave the people to
[1:24:52] themsel
[1:24:55] praise the
[1:25:00] Lord you are a you you are B dozing
[1:25:03] yourself right into hell that's right
[1:25:06] and you know that and you are without
[1:25:10] excuse but before a just God can pour
[1:25:14] out his judgment upon the people he has
[1:25:17] to make a way of Escape for everyone who
[1:25:20] desire to receive it
[1:25:24] this is your Daye of visitation you
[1:25:28] might now want to believe it because an
[1:25:31] uneducated Minister says it but don't
[1:25:36] pay attention to the messenger pay
[1:25:38] attention to the message you are
[1:25:43] hearing praise the Lord
[1:25:47] amen well he was not a theologian he was
[1:25:50] not a scholar you know uh I mean the
[1:25:52] only good thing in his ministry was
[1:25:54] Divine Healing that's why people will
[1:25:57] say but
[1:26:00] slowly slowly let me tell you there are
[1:26:04] many people that have sat around this
[1:26:06] message they have played it off they
[1:26:09] have played Church they have come up
[1:26:12] with a lot of excuses why they can't
[1:26:13] believe the message God will allow them
[1:26:16] to see this word for feeling right
[1:26:19] before their eyes and there is nothing
[1:26:22] you can do to change your situ ation
[1:26:25] because you have gone too far from
[1:26:30] God nothing you can
[1:26:32] do you will just see it and
[1:26:35] argue praise the
[1:26:38] Lord how many people Rush on the
[1:26:41] internet when Billy Paul passed away oh
[1:26:43] California sing hey they say California
[1:26:45] will sing Oh California all they are
[1:26:47] trying to do is to just ease Their
[1:26:51] Fear they are just trying to ease is
[1:26:54] Their
[1:26:56] Fear God's word do not
[1:27:02] fall praise the
[1:27:07] Lord you might not believe it he says
[1:27:10] because it's an uneducated Minister
[1:27:12] saying it to you but don't pay attention
[1:27:14] to the messenger pay attention to the
[1:27:17] message because the Messenger will die
[1:27:20] but the message lives on
[1:27:25] praise the Lord so you see God the very
[1:27:29] thing that he did in
[1:27:32] Jeremiah to warn the people because they
[1:27:35] have got to such a
[1:27:38] place they have got to such a
[1:27:42] place see the people they have they
[1:27:46] prosper and they went after Prosperity
[1:27:49] until they they they they they
[1:27:51] disrespected and disregard the
[1:27:55] Sabbath that's why God gave them 70
[1:27:57] years why because he wanted the land to
[1:28:02] rest he let he wanted the land to to
[1:28:06] gain a
[1:28:10] Sabbath praise the Lord
[1:28:17] amen sometimes God want your mind to
[1:28:21] rest sometimes he want your body to rest
[1:28:28] amen sometimes uh and some I even
[1:28:32] sometimes all the time he want you to
[1:28:34] respect his
[1:28:41] Sabbath are we
[1:28:44] together okay that's I I was just trying
[1:28:47] to lay a background for what we read in
[1:28:49] chapter 16 so if you read from chapter
[1:28:52] 14 coming on you will see that God God
[1:28:55] was he he was kind of for preparing the
[1:28:58] people he was he was telling them the
[1:29:00] Judgment you know the destruction that
[1:29:02] is coming on them how they have wasted
[1:29:05] his Mercy now here in chapter 16 he's
[1:29:08] telling Israel I found you when you were
[1:29:13] young when you were
[1:29:16] young he says your father is an
[1:29:20] Amorite your mother is a hittite
[1:29:24] right in Babylon you were born that's

[1:30:19] up to keep you warm

[1:30:26] God he didn't say I took you I wash you
[1:30:30] up and I wrap you and I says well you
[1:30:34] can live no he says right in your mess
[1:30:38] when you were right in your

[1:31:33] hallelujah love the Lord
[1:31:35] tonight amen amen
[1:31:39] amen glory be to
[1:31:43] God
[1:31:45] hallelujah
[1:31:48] now I think I did I did something
[1:32:13] I
[1:32:14] I I don't
[1:32:16] know I don't know what I did here people
[1:32:26] I thought it was two
[1:32:29] different
[1:32:32] um notes that I sent out tonight it
[1:32:35] looks like I only sent
[1:32:46] one oh yeah I didn't not send this one
[1:32:50] sorry this should actually be my note
[1:32:53] for tonight that was was just that was
[1:32:54] just my
[1:32:56] introduction praise the Lord that was
[1:32:59] just my introduction so if the folks
[1:33:02] back there can just look down there
[1:33:03] quickly let's just read this and then I
[1:33:06] will I will find a place to close here
[1:33:08] there is something that drw me to this
[1:33:10] now when we spoke on uh on Sunday we
[1:33:13] were talking about uh uh you know how
[1:33:16] God how the Virgin birth you know uh uh
[1:33:20] uh restored the promise that was given
[1:33:22] to David that without the Virgin birth
[1:33:25] there was not going to be a son of David
[1:33:27] on the throne amen because God has has
[1:33:31] has cursed jaah because of the
[1:33:33] wickedness that he have done and the
[1:33:35] Lord said there will not be a seed of
[1:33:37] him that will sit on the throne of David
[1:33:39] so God in his own provision has to
[1:33:42] remember his promise that the seed of
[1:33:45] the woman will bruise the head of the
[1:33:48] serpent so what what what I want to do
[1:33:50] tonight is that is is to be able to show
[1:33:53] us because if you look into what we we
[1:33:56] we want to read here you will see where
[1:33:58] where U
[1:34:01] uh oh praise the Lord glory be to God
[1:34:05] now brother B is having a conversation
[1:34:07] here he's talking about a conversation
[1:34:09] he's having with some brothers and uh uh
[1:34:13] uh kind of a paraphrase key key to the
[1:34:16] door he says someone asked the other V
[1:34:19] he said brother Brandon would there be
[1:34:21] any difference between Adam and Eve and
[1:34:22] their children if they were here today
[1:34:25] you know uh he's he's uh he out hunting
[1:34:28] with some brothers and he says they ask
[1:34:30] him if Adam and Eve was here today will
[1:34:32] there be any different physically with
[1:34:34] them brother Bram says yes there will be
[1:34:36] a difference praise the
[1:34:38] Lord so he goes on he says uh uh uh
[1:34:48] uh uh let me let me just go go ahead
[1:34:51] here this is uh
[1:34:54] said you mean Eve wouldn't wouldn't be
[1:34:57] uh uh a woman like her daughter Adam
[1:34:59] wouldn't be a man like his sons I said
[1:35:02] in many respect but not in all physical
[1:35:05] respect he said what will be the
[1:35:07] difference he said U I said they
[1:35:10] wouldn't have a
[1:35:12] neighor they were created they were not
[1:35:17] born praise the Lord amen every man born
[1:35:22] of a woman is tached to a neighbor
[1:35:26] train so brother saying that will be the
[1:35:28] difference between Adam and his children
[1:35:31] he does not have a neighbor because he
[1:35:33] was created he was not
[1:35:36] born praise the Lord amen now so seeing
[1:35:41] the description that God gave to
[1:35:43] Jerusalem where I wanted to bring our
[1:35:46] mind to is that our connection to the
[1:35:51] curse when the Bible when David said in
[1:35:54] sin did my mother conceived me praise
[1:35:58] the Lord I came to the word speaking
[1:36:01] lies that neighor strin is our
[1:36:04] connection to the
[1:36:11] curse are we
[1:36:15] together now he he says uh uh they
[1:36:19] wouldn't have a neighbor they were
[1:36:20] created right they wasn't attached to
[1:36:23] nothing Adam and Eve was not attached to
[1:36:28] anything praise the Lord they were
[1:36:31] formed right out of the earth and God
[1:36:34] breath the Breath of Life in them they
[1:36:36] were not attached to anything but you
[1:36:39] and myself we are attached to a blood
[1:36:44] stream praise the
[1:36:47] Lord
[1:36:49] amen and whatever we are attached to
[1:36:52] goes by four
[1:36:55] generation of some of your ancestors
[1:36:58] that you did not see I never saw none of
[1:37:01] my
[1:37:02] grandparents before I would be thinking
[1:37:04] about the great
[1:37:06] grand praise the Lord I didn't know how
[1:37:09] the look
[1:37:10] like I didn't know some of the habits
[1:37:13] and things that they deal
[1:37:15] with and yet I'm attached to a strain
[1:37:18] that goes back full generation
[1:37:25] if God grace does not come on the same
[1:37:28] there is no way we can be
[1:37:31] saved if God don't help you there's no
[1:37:34] way you can
[1:37:37] change because those things run down
[1:37:40] your
[1:37:42] Jin it runs down your
[1:37:47] blood praise the
[1:37:50] Lord some of the habits that we struggle
[1:37:53] with
[1:37:55] some of the way our mind the way we
[1:38:02] think some people no matter how you try
[1:38:05] to make the conversation
[1:38:09] positive they come from a very deep
[1:38:11] place of
[1:38:13] negative so strong
[1:38:25] that's the bloodline that's the
[1:38:26] bloodstream that we come from some
[1:38:29] people from a terrible place of
[1:38:31] fear terrible place of
[1:38:39] fear praise the
[1:38:41] Lord and that person read the scripture
[1:38:44] all the time the Bible says God has not
[1:38:46] given us the spirit of
[1:38:48] fear they says it they quot it God has
[1:38:51] not given us the spirit of fear
[1:38:56] but you see it it runs down so much in
[1:38:59] your
[1:39:00] bloodline they hate it when they are
[1:39:03] afraid is they are not trying to make
[1:39:05] them themselves
[1:39:08] afraid it's just in their
[1:39:13] bloodline praise the
[1:39:16] Lord some people have to practice to say
[1:39:19] the
[1:39:21] truth they are coming from such a
[1:39:23] bloodline of
[1:39:26] lie that that no this time I have to say
[1:39:29] the
[1:39:31] truth praise the Lord it might sound
[1:39:38] funny praise the Lord I don't know about
[1:39:42] you I've been there
[1:39:45] before you tell a lie and you ask
[1:39:48] yourself but why I even
[1:39:50] lie why I why I just couldn't tell this
[1:39:53] person the
[1:39:56] truth as funny as it
[1:39:59] signs it's things that you hit in your
[1:40:02] life but you don't have control over it
[1:40:04] why because it runs down your
[1:40:08] bloodstream you got attached to that
[1:40:11] through a neor
[1:40:13] stream you don't like it but you don't
[1:40:16] have control over it and if God don't
[1:40:18] help
[1:40:20] you praise the Lord
[1:40:24] like brother Bram says being the first
[1:40:26] son of Charlie Branham it had to be God
[1:40:31] to deliver him from being a
[1:40:33] drunker being the first
[1:40:36] son he says
[1:40:38] all all the Brams die with their boots
[1:40:42] their on their feet drunk in the
[1:40:50] water he says I owe it to the Lord
[1:40:56] even at the time he wanted to prove that
[1:40:58] he was not accessing he wanted to take a
[1:41:00] drink and drink it God had to come down
[1:41:04] supernaturally by a way wi and make him
[1:41:15] uncomfortable well there some of the
[1:41:17] things that we deal with and you know
[1:41:19] what happened we get so lazy we don't
[1:41:22] pay attention to this things and we just
[1:41:24] think that well yeah I'm a br I believe
[1:41:26] the message you know uh uh I never did
[1:41:28] it in the first place it's all of those
[1:41:30] things are truth they are God's word for
[1:41:34] you praise the Lord but what you never
[1:41:37] did in the first place you have to
[1:41:38] identify
[1:41:41] it you have to identify that I'm trapped
[1:41:44] in this body I'm trapped with this
[1:41:46] attitud with this nature I'm trapped
[1:41:49] with this
[1:41:50] thing I hit it
[1:42:04] but B go ahead let me just read this
[1:42:06] thing and close up yeah as long as that
[1:42:09] bear there on everything that's born in
[1:42:12] this world shows it's a renegade he
[1:42:16] brother is trying to say as long as we
[1:42:18] we have this thing here he says
[1:42:20] everything that is born with this thing
[1:42:22] is a renegade
[1:42:26] it's a sign of
[1:42:36] rebellion glory be to God we see the
[1:42:39] importance of the Virgin birth as we go
[1:42:41] along to begin with a Ser Renegade to
[1:42:43] begin with he says that's right show
[1:42:45] there's the difference they will have no
[1:42:48] neighbor they wasn't connected to any
[1:42:52] female uh to come here see God created
[1:42:57] them praise the
[1:43:02] Lord when the Bible
[1:43:05] says we are a new
[1:43:09] creation when the Bible says we are a
[1:43:12] new creation it's not from from your
[1:43:15] father and
[1:43:18] mother it's not from the life it's not a
[1:43:21] remake
[1:43:23] a new creation is not a
[1:43:27] remake God is giving birth to something
[1:43:31] new but that thing new is going to be in
[1:43:35] the
[1:43:37] midst of a
[1:43:39] Jame that you've been struggling
[1:43:44] with just like Mary she never had no
[1:43:48] attachment to she said be it unto me
[1:43:50] according to your word and what was
[1:43:53] forming
[1:43:54] her praise the
[1:43:57] Lord it did not automatic automatically
[1:44:01] change her to believe that that's what
[1:44:03] the Catholic believe that's why the
[1:44:05] thing that when Mary got conceed
[1:44:08] immediately she got an IM uh uh iMat
[1:44:14] birth praise the
[1:44:17] Lord in particular birth which mean
[1:44:21] immediately she was ch change and she
[1:44:24] lost all her sinful
[1:44:28] nature many of the times that's what we
[1:44:31] want to
[1:44:35] believe that when you when you when you
[1:44:37] are born again H H you receive the Lord
[1:44:40] you receive no no no no no no
[1:44:45] no
[1:44:48] no
[1:44:50] no that's what make Christian Life is a
[1:44:53] constant
[1:44:54] battle it's a constant battle you have
[1:44:58] to recognize the thing that is running
[1:45:01] through your bloodstream and then you
[1:45:02] bring it under the word you got to bring
[1:45:06] it under that new creation that word
[1:45:08] that is birthing in you that word that
[1:45:11] is about to take over your body you got
[1:45:13] to bring it on the word it's every day
[1:45:16] every 24 hour you got to be conscious to
[1:45:19] it
[1:45:25] you got to be
[1:45:26] conscious it's a every day 24hour
[1:45:34] battle When the Thought comes a desire
[1:45:37] comes that you know no no no no this is
[1:45:39] coming from my old BL stream buy you
[1:45:41] come right here I'm going to put a word
[1:45:44] over you I put a promise over you
[1:45:46] because I have to possess this land I
[1:45:48] have to possess this body
[1:45:57] that's the reason why I said from the
[1:45:58] beginning we have a bunch of
[1:46:01] Catholics we have a bunch of Catholics
[1:46:04] around the
[1:46:06] message praise the
[1:46:08] Lord oh I believe the message I believe
[1:46:11] I believe the message I'm a
[1:46:13] bride I'm a virgin
[1:46:18] bride you have a virgin word you have a
[1:46:21] pure word in you
[1:46:23] praise the
[1:46:25] Lord

[1:46:30] does not have a
[1:46:32] connection now watch and see what

[1:48:32] himself produced his own bloodline and
[1:48:35] Exel form himself and then he got
[1:48:38] connected to our curse to break the
[1:48:43] curse he formed himself and got into the
[1:48:46] womb of a young
[1:48:49] woman and attach himself to our curse
[1:48:55] praise the
[1:48:56] Lord that he will be born with a

[1:49:05] blood he will be born and he will be
[1:49:08] needing to be rubbed in swording
[1:49:13] cloth just to be able to release us from
[1:49:17] our
[1:49:18] curse he identify himself with our curse

[1:49:34] he became sin for
[1:49:36] us he became
[1:49:40] sin if you trace his bloodline you trace
[1:49:43] it directly to
[1:49:48] Elohim but yet he became sin for us he
[1:49:51] took assistent El body he dropped in it
[1:49:54] he could sleep he could feel hungry he
[1:49:57] could weep at the grave of
[1:50:01] Lazarus but in that blood stream was the
[1:50:04] life of

[1:51:57] what God is doing in our life we have to
[1:52:00] pay attention to what the grace of God
[1:52:02] is building and where he's giving us
[1:52:04] Grace and where we need more

[1:53:13] truth you are still lying why you don't
[1:53:16] have control over
[1:53:20] it it might have come down from some

[1:55:02] to do that no no no no just receive the
[1:55:06] word just receive the
[1:55:19] word glory be to God you find find

[1:55:44] all of that you go home you are just
[1:55:47] miserable you are just
[1:55:50] miserable because you realize that you
[1:55:53] have failed the opportunity you

[1:57:10] their
[1:57:11] head when they sit down by themselves
[1:57:14] all that is on their mind is just
[1:57:15] themselves they see themselves popping
[1:57:17] up all over the place me my me I me my
[1:57:21] me
[1:57:31] the truth about the matter is not your
[1:57:33] fault but now that the word has come

[1:58:59] praise the
[1:59:02] Lord
[1:59:04] hallelujah one of the greatest Victory
[1:59:07] we will
[1:59:09] have is when we bring his
[1:59:12] body subject to the
[1:59:15] word we worried about raising the
[1:59:18] dead worried about speaking another word
[1:59:21] and going to live in it
[1:59:25] one of the greatest
[1:59:26] Miracle is when God can help you at a
[1:59:30] giving moment when the enemy is trying
[1:59:33] to allow the Bible say he's the prince
[1:59:35] of the power of the head when he's
[1:59:37] trying to allow some kind
[1:59:39] of nature to rise you have to remember
[1:59:42] this body is not
[1:59:45] redeemed it's not
[1:59:49] redeemed praise the lord it's is not
[1:59:54] redeemed you know when your body will
[1:59:56] fully be
[1:59:58] redeemed when you call it from the
[2:00:01] earth praise the Lord for those that
[2:00:04] gone before
[2:00:06] us when they are calling their body from
[2:00:08] the earth the same way Jesus called
[2:00:11] Lazarus and said come forth praise the
[2:00:14] Lord when you call in the body from the
[2:00:17] earth it's not going to come
[2:00:20] out with any kind of for sinful
[2:00:24] nature
[2:00:26] because you will be in your original
[2:00:29] position as the
[2:00:31] word with the creative power and you
[2:00:35] will call yourself the way you want
[2:00:37] yourself to be as a Son of God and as a
[2:00:42] daughter of God but until
[2:00:46] then we have to fight every blood
[2:00:50] strein praise the Lord
[2:00:53] brother Bram talks about family strength
[2:00:54] I was going to read read there but we
[2:00:56] don't have time tonight and uh But as
[2:00:59] God gave us race will
[2:01:01] continue praise the Lord because we must
[2:01:04] possess this
[2:01:05] body you will not enjoy this
[2:01:08] message you will not enjoy the Holy
[2:01:11] Ghost until you can bring this body
[2:01:14] subject to the
[2:01:17] word praise the Lord
[2:01:22] that is the joy in serving
[2:01:25] God when we have our best
[2:01:28] choice we have our best judgment and
[2:01:32] when the word of God comes in
[2:01:36] Simplicity you can say Lord this is not
[2:01:39] good for me I'm going to take what the
[2:01:41] word
[2:01:43] says praise the Lord this thing is just
[2:01:46] going to just fulfill me for now on
[2:01:49] Earth but what the word is giving for me
[2:01:52] is going to be for now and after this
[2:01:58] life the Lord bless you
[2:02:13] tonight let's bow our heads and pray
[2:02:21] think about these things
[2:02:24] people the hour is upon
[2:02:31] us and sometimes many times we struggle
[2:02:34] oh what what I want to know the way of
[2:02:37] the Lord you know what is the word of
[2:02:39] God for me to do this and it's all
[2:02:41] because in our
[2:02:45] mind there is that human nature that is
[2:02:47] struggling for
[2:02:50] dominance there is that human nature
[2:02:52] that want to control
[2:02:55] us and the voice of
[2:02:58] God and the Holy Spirit is calling
[2:03:03] you to take a
[2:03:10] walk to walk away from there
[2:03:22] dear
[2:03:24] father I pray tonight oh God you
[2:03:29] help everyone under the sound of my
[2:03:33] voice I pray that father you will come
[2:03:36] oh God it's a beautiful thing Lord It's
[2:03:39] a beautiful
[2:03:41] thing what was the thought of
[2:03:45] Mary when she could touch her stomach to
[2:03:48] know that she was carrying a child
[2:03:52] but she never slept with a
[2:03:56] man and father that's that's the feeling
[2:03:59] that comes
[2:04:00] Lord when we know that this grace that
[2:04:03] has come to
[2:04:05] us this word that is born in our
[2:04:08] heart it never came to us through a
[2:04:18] man she could feel the baby kicking
[2:04:24] she knew that it was not just an
[2:04:27] imagination she was carrying a
[2:04:32] child Lord we can see our life
[2:04:36] change we can see father how you are
[2:04:39] helping us in certain areas of our
[2:04:43] life you are taking us Lord from immoral
[2:04:46] desires
[2:04:55] we know that this is not something that
[2:04:57] we have
[2:04:59] practiced we know that the new birth is
[2:05:07] real sometimes when we are just so hurt
[2:05:10] and it's it's it's it's just it's just
[2:05:13] it's just hard to leave us
[2:05:16] Lord and we get so bitter Lord and we
[2:05:19] get Lord God
[2:05:22] we just f with ourself
[2:05:24] Lord but when your grace comes on the S
[2:05:28] and take that burden away from our
[2:05:32] heart and we can look at
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:39] that and just say thank
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:49] you and say Lord even if you want me to
[2:05:51] to go and self that
[2:05:55] person I can do I can do it 10 times
[2:05:58] more if you give me the
[2:06:04] grace it's
[2:06:15] real but yet in that
[2:06:19] moment Mary was feeling a a a child in
[2:06:22] her
[2:06:25] womb but she had her own desire there
[2:06:28] are certain food she wanted to
[2:06:32] eat she was still carrying pains in her
[2:06:36] body there times she had a
[2:06:39] headache but yet there was a
[2:06:45] real the creator of Heaven and Earth has
[2:06:48] created himself in her womb
[2:06:52] oh
[2:06:54] God if you would just make it so real to
[2:06:57] us
[2:07:00] Lord not to look at our
[2:07:03] thoughts not to look at our
[2:07:06] feelings but let's pay attention to the
[2:07:08] word that we carry in our
[2:07:13] heart whenever we feel a move of the
[2:07:16] word in our
[2:07:18] heart may we Rejoice Lord
[2:07:22] whenever it it move us to pray may may
[2:07:25] we may we be thankful

[2:07:43] all all the mistakes and all the things
[2:07:46] that we struggle with in this
[2:07:48] body that we cannot see what your word
[2:07:50] is doing in our heart God what your word
[2:07:53] is doing in our life
[2:07:58] Lord that word is going to grow to be a
[2:08:02] Manch
[2:08:04] child and it's going to possess this
[2:08:15] body
