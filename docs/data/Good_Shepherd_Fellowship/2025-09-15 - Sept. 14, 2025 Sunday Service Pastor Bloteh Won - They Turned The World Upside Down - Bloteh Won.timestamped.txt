[43:18] [Music]
[43:22] Praise the Lord. While we remain
[43:25] standing, I want us to sing this song
[43:29] and uh
[43:33] let's do the sin has been watch.
[43:36] Yeah. Okay.
[43:38] the toll of the road will seem nothing.
[43:41] Yeah, let's let's do that. And uh I was
[43:44] thinking about this song during the
[43:47] weekend,
[43:49] you know, uh uh while I was away, I was
[43:53] a few places that I had to speak. I was
[43:56] most of my messages was on the full
[43:58] anointing, the anointing that leads the
[44:01] church. And uh uh
[44:06] and then I remember talking about uh the
[44:09] influence of the full anointing on
[44:11] healing. How sometimes God will put the
[44:14] church on uh the the anointing of an ox
[44:18] which is a burden bearing. Many times uh
[44:22] uh when when people are going through
[44:26] those things in our human mind we think
[44:29] that they don't have faith but uh uh
[44:33] it's an expression of faith a great
[44:35] expression of faith for a person to be
[44:38] going through uh tough trials in their
[44:42] life whether it is pain in their body or
[44:44] sickness or or but yet there is there is
[44:48] just something that is so anchor in your
[44:50] heart that uh no matter what you are
[44:53] going through, God is so real. And uh uh
[44:56] I beginning to to to see that, you know,
[45:00] especially having uh uh you know, my
[45:03] mother-in-law not being feeling well and
[45:06] uh uh you know, and and just to see uh I
[45:11] mean, all the effort that uh you know,
[45:14] she's putting in and my wife helping her
[45:16] and all of that. But it's something
[45:18] completely different when we come down
[45:20] to the word and we come down to to
[45:23] having our devotion. We go down to her
[45:26] room and all of that. I see something
[45:29] completely different. I see a strength.
[45:31] You know, I see I see an expression of
[45:34] faith. I see a love for the word that no
[45:37] matter the pains in her body, you know,
[45:39] sometime I will step down to her room in
[45:41] the night, knock at the door and get in,
[45:43] you know, I called and she will answer.
[45:45] I says, "Well, yeah. how you feeling? We
[45:47] talk a little bit. I said, "Let's pray,"
[45:49] you know, and I mean, she's right there.
[45:51] She's ready there to worship the Lord.
[45:54] And uh, you know, and I just thought
[45:57] about this song and I just want us to
[45:59] just sing it and worship. Now, if you uh
[46:03] I send a verse out there, uh, people,
[46:05] when we get to the end of the road,
[46:17] The saints
[46:19] have been washed in the fortress.
[46:27] All the strangers
[46:30] of Galile
[46:37] and the voice
[46:40] that suck you
[46:42] the rock
[46:47] will be heard
[46:51] into the earth.
[46:56] Hallelujah.
[46:58] are the path
[47:01] of the flowing

[49:45] me so
[49:47] to forsake me.
[49:53] I give you
[49:58] [Music]
[50:03] his people.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:13] And Satan
[50:18] claims love by
[50:24] and by
[50:26] I shall see him and praise him
[50:33] in the city
[50:37] of on

[1:07:15] were stoned. They were saw a thunder
[1:07:18] were tempted. They were slain with the
[1:07:20] sword. They wander about in sheep skin
[1:07:25] and goat skin being destitute. You were
[1:07:27] afflicted tormented. This is where I
[1:07:29] want to come. Of whom
[1:07:32] the word was not worthy. Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world was not wed of all of
[1:07:38] these Old Testament saints. When it came
[1:07:41] to the New Testament saints, they turn
[1:07:43] the word upside down.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] I just I like to play these things in my
[1:07:53] mind like that. Amen.
[1:07:55] Praise the Lord. The word was not worthy
[1:07:58] of all of these Old Testament things.
[1:08:00] They wonder in desert and in mountains
[1:08:03] and in den and caves of the earth. All
[1:08:06] these all having obtained a good report
[1:08:08] through faith receive not the promise
[1:08:12] God having provided some better thing
[1:08:15] for us that they without us should not
[1:08:18] be there perfect the Lord add blessing
[1:08:22] to the reading of his word. Amen. This
[1:08:24] morning I just want to take a little
[1:08:26] thought out of that they turn the word
[1:08:29] upside down.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to preach on.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I couldn't get away
[1:08:35] from that phrase that they turned the
[1:08:38] word upside down. Amen.
[1:08:41] For whom the world was now worthy. It
[1:08:44] turned the word upside down. Praise the
[1:08:48] Lord. Amen.
[1:08:52] It's good to be in church. Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord is good. It's
[1:09:00] wonderful.
[1:09:02] Praise the Lord. So we we have to start
[1:09:04] up here and uh uh
[1:09:12] there were there was some there was some
[1:09:13] other historical things that I that I
[1:09:15] pulled together but I felt like uh just
[1:09:19] like last week I spent much of the time
[1:09:21] on my slides than than preaching and uh
[1:09:25] just because that's not my style. So u
[1:09:29] uh I I thought that well okay I would
[1:09:32] just I would just reduce that and then
[1:09:34] uh get to uh what I want. When you when
[1:09:38] I when you have the slide like this it
[1:09:40] kind of organize your thought but uh if
[1:09:43] you are not used to this style of
[1:09:46] preaching then uh even though it's
[1:09:49] organized yet is this organized for you
[1:09:52] because your mind is uh is going
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; one way or the other. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:58] But we will get through it. Blessed be
[1:10:00] the name of the Lord.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; After all, he's the one that we want to
[1:10:03] praise, you know, we want to worship.
[1:10:06] So, we will get through it.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:11] Okay.
[1:10:13] Now, so uh uh uh reading from the book
[1:10:18] of Thessalonian and and talking about uh
[1:10:21] uh
[1:10:26] uh
[1:10:29] what was what we were talking about?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I can't even remember my own.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Playing God.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Playing God. That was the subject. and
[1:10:41] uh just trying to be able to get myself
[1:10:44] back. Uh uh um
[1:10:48] so uh I went back and started reading uh
[1:10:51] uh a little bit about church history and
[1:10:54] just looking at uh uh Paul missionary
[1:10:57] journey and that that was much of that
[1:11:00] that I had in my notes, but I I just
[1:11:01] decided to take it off and uh so we can
[1:11:04] just be able to get down to to business.
[1:11:06] Amen. Last week we said that uh uh uh
[1:11:10] one of the big Roman uh persecution came
[1:11:13] on the the group in Thessalonica. So
[1:11:16] that's that was why we fall back on Acts
[1:11:18] chapter uh uh 17 just to be able to give
[1:11:23] us a picture of how the Thessalonica
[1:11:25] church started. That's how that church
[1:11:28] started.
[1:11:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; That's that's exactly how that church
[1:11:33] started. It started in the house of
[1:11:35] Jason.
[1:11:37] Now so uh uh looking at that I came up
[1:11:42] with this that church begins from whom?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Church begins from whom and uh uh uh uh
[1:11:53] and and it's scriptural. You can see all
[1:11:54] the scripture there. We we read that
[1:11:57] also here in uh in that uh uh you know
[1:12:00] they came to the house of Jason you know
[1:12:03] to look for these men. So all in the all
[1:12:07] in the the the book of acts everywhere
[1:12:10] you will read about the church the
[1:12:12] believers gathering it was always in a
[1:12:14] home.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:18] It was several years later before they
[1:12:21] had this setting where people leave
[1:12:23] their homes and come together.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; But the early church begin in the home.
[1:12:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; So that's where we taking this thought
[1:12:37] from that church begin from home and I
[1:12:40] think it must begin from home for us
[1:12:42] also.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The service must begin
[1:12:45] from home. The way we prepare oursel,
[1:12:48] the way we prepare our mind.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; We must come praying up.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; If we come by, you know, fussing from
[1:12:56] home and arguing from home and and all
[1:12:58] of that, we bringing that right here.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; So church begins from home.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; So in Acts 12:12, the Bible says, "And
[1:13:12] they had consider the thing they came to
[1:13:15] the house of Mary, the mother of John,
[1:13:18] whose soul name was Mark, John Mark,
[1:13:21] where many were gathered together
[1:13:24] praying." Praise the Lord.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh they started here
[1:13:31] prayer meeting started here. So this
[1:13:33] very same apostle Paul the Bible say for
[1:13:36] Saul who made a havoc of the church
[1:13:40] entering into every house.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; So before he started going to house to
[1:13:47] preach, he was going to houses to
[1:13:50] persecute.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:56] Amen. Before he started going to houses
[1:13:59] to preach, he was going to houses to
[1:14:02] persecute. So he make havoc of the
[1:14:05] church entering into every house and
[1:14:09] hauling men and women committing them to
[1:14:12] prison.
[1:14:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I mean, uh, you think about
[1:14:19] it. They they didn't had a cell phones
[1:14:22] and social media those days. And, and,
[1:14:25] uh, if if they were meeting in my house
[1:14:27] and, uh, maybe this next service will
[1:14:30] not be at my house, we will have to meet
[1:14:32] at brother Johnny's house next Sunday
[1:14:36] or for the next the next service.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see they were not just
[1:14:45] sitting down waiting to be informed.
[1:14:48] They were looking for information.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; If you want to be in service, you have
[1:14:53] to look for information. Where are we
[1:14:56] meeting?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So you see how we sit back and we get so
[1:15:02] relaxed. We want to be told. Nobody told
[1:15:05] me.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I didn't receive text message. We get
[1:15:08] all the excuses to give.
[1:15:12] If you wanted to be in church this time,
[1:15:14] you have to find out where are they
[1:15:17] meeting. Sister Nami, did you hear
[1:15:19] anything? Where where they meeting next
[1:15:21] week? Well, if you hear anything, please
[1:15:23] let me know. I if I hear anything, I'll
[1:15:25] let you know, too.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's how they went about.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 6:5.
[1:15:37] You see Paul here now uh after this uh
[1:15:41] as 8 experience uh we know that chapter
[1:15:44] nine he he he met the pillar of fire he
[1:15:47] got converted and now yeah he's the same
[1:15:50] one likewise greet the church that is in
[1:15:53] their house salute my well beloved
[1:15:57] uh Epheneathus who is the first fruit.
[1:16:02] Amen.
[1:16:04] And uh I I see what he says here in uh
[1:16:08] uh uh to the Corinthian church.
[1:16:13] What have have you not houses to eat and
[1:16:17] to drink in or despise ye the church of
[1:16:21] God? Now I put this one there just with
[1:16:25] the same with the same thought line that
[1:16:28] churches were in house. But here said
[1:16:30] they are gathered in this house for for
[1:16:34] you know for service for the communion
[1:16:36] and the way the people were going about
[1:16:39] that's why he used that statement that's
[1:16:41] why he said to them I mean when we are
[1:16:43] gathered in this house it's church
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; let's not take the house setting and
[1:16:52] then we start to break the order of the
[1:16:54] service
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; are you are you are you following me
[1:16:58] what I'm saying
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; praise Praise the Lord.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You know, and and and it's it's I mean,
[1:17:02] it's it's pretty much applied today. If
[1:17:04] you are home following the service
[1:17:06] online, you are in church. You must be
[1:17:08] able to respect the the the presence of
[1:17:11] the Lord.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; You can't be in boxers and and eating
[1:17:14] biscuit, drinking Coca-Cola, and you say
[1:17:16] you following the service.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Then do that another time,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Find your own convenient time and follow
[1:17:28] the service.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; But if you are streaming online, you
[1:17:31] must know that you are in church
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; and you must be able to keep some decent
[1:17:36] order.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Because because uh uh the the the moving
[1:17:42] of the spirit is everywhere. You you
[1:17:44] just think about that if I mean if we
[1:17:46] have that attitude I mean it's it's a
[1:17:49] plus to the people that are in church
[1:17:52] because there's a group of people taking
[1:17:53] their position by the word.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] Also
[1:18:11] in chapter 16, the churches in Asia
[1:18:14] salute you. Aquilia Priscilia salutes
[1:18:17] you. Salute you much in the Lord with
[1:18:21] the church that is in their house. So
[1:18:25] you see that that was that was just the
[1:18:27] foundation of the New Testament church.
[1:18:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] Church begins from home.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We cannot have awful
[1:18:43] attitudes at home and think we can bring
[1:18:46] our best offering to the Lord.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; No, our offering starts from home. The
[1:18:52] way we prepare ourself. When we wake up
[1:18:55] in the morning, the mindset we get
[1:18:57] ourself in. All of those things make you
[1:18:59] to to to get yourself ready for church
[1:19:01] and start getting you start gearing up
[1:19:04] for service
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; when you know that church begins from
[1:19:08] home.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And you read the rest there. Salute the
[1:19:14] brethren in in Laisha. The church which
[1:19:18] is in his house, you know. Uh okay. And
[1:19:21] I put this one also there. Uh uh for if
[1:19:24] a man know not how to rule his own
[1:19:29] house,
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; how shall he take care of the house of
[1:19:33] God?
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; You see why why why they make this a
[1:19:37] qualification was because church begin
[1:19:40] from whom?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The offices in the church are not are
[1:19:49] not are not giving politically.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:54] If a man cannot rule his own house,
[1:19:57] so your house must be an example.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because church begins from home.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:20] you know, we do something a little bit
[1:20:22] here. Uh uh uh you know, most of the
[1:20:25] time if we want to we we we you know, we
[1:20:27] want to work with a brother, uh we we
[1:20:30] normally talk to the wife. One of the
[1:20:32] reason why I do that personally is
[1:20:34] because sometimes it looks like the
[1:20:36] wives are detached from the office of
[1:20:39] her husband.
[1:20:41] And then when the brother have a duty to
[1:20:43] do, the wife also have her own duty and
[1:20:46] and yeah, we know I mean or you just
[1:20:49] spending much of the time to the church.
[1:20:51] So we make sure that you are in line.
[1:20:53] You agree that your husband take this
[1:20:55] office.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; If you don't agree, no matter how much
[1:21:00] he's spiritual
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; because y'all know what's going on
[1:21:04] there.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. No, you don't have a man,
[1:21:09] you know, taking care of a church thing
[1:21:10] and a woman murmuring at the back.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; It goes in line when God called a man,
[1:21:16] God called his wife. So, she has to be
[1:21:18] involved.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I also put this there. For if
[1:21:21] a man know how to rule, know not how to
[1:21:24] rule his own house, how shall he rule
[1:21:26] the house of God. Why? Because church
[1:21:29] begins from home.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Church begins from home.
[1:21:39] Now, so we we we are talking about these
[1:21:42] uh uh uh
[1:21:45] uh testimonial brothers. The Bible says
[1:21:47] they turn the word upside down. Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; They turn the word upside down. What a
[1:21:54] testimony.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; If that's the only thing they can accuse
[1:21:58] them for. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:02] Verse six. And when they drew hh they
[1:22:06] found they found them there. They drew
[1:22:08] Jason and the setting brethren to the
[1:22:09] rulers of the city crying these that
[1:22:11] have turned the world upside down. I
[1:22:14] come hither also. They have turned the
[1:22:16] world upside down. Now they have come to
[1:22:18] our place and they are turning
[1:22:20] everything upside down.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:25] Now I want to just look a few things
[1:22:27] here. Just looking at the word that they
[1:22:29] turn upside down. What is the word? the
[1:22:32] Greek word cosmos there which means the
[1:22:35] word other.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It means the word other. And uh uh
[1:22:43] uh uh the word came out of the Greek
[1:22:47] word cosmo which means the faction of
[1:22:50] the word.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; So they turn the word other than they
[1:22:55] turn the faction of the word. The word
[1:22:57] there in the Greek word is cosmo which
[1:23:00] means there were other order the church
[1:23:04] order and everything because that's
[1:23:07] exactly what they are doing here. They
[1:23:09] went into the synagogues
[1:23:11] preaching the resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:14] Christ. So they are turning the church
[1:23:16] all the upside down because the church
[1:23:19] is preaching creeds
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; and dogma. Yeah, they are introducing
[1:23:24] the resurrected Jesus Christ.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Now you see this will give us a far
[1:23:32] better understanding.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; On 1977
[1:23:36] prediction.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because most people says, "Oh
[1:23:43] yeah, brother Brandham says the world we
[1:23:45] in." No, he talks about the word other.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:52] which have to do with the denominational
[1:23:55] system.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; The church order
[1:24:00] is not going any farther with God.
[1:24:05] Are we together? I don't want to go into
[1:24:07] that, but I just I just throw that in.
[1:24:10] That word uh there is cosmo, which means
[1:24:14] the word of the the people of the word.
[1:24:18] So, we have the people of the word. We
[1:24:20] have the word order, the church order,
[1:24:23] everything. We have the faction of the
[1:24:25] word. We have the order of the word. So
[1:24:28] all of those all of those means cosmos.
[1:24:31] Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; All of those mean cosmos.
[1:24:36] And uh that's also where our our you
[1:24:40] know our faction designer took cosmetic.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you check it out. That's that's
[1:24:47] where they took cosmetic. Now, so you
[1:24:50] will see that uh uh uh uh
[1:24:55] they turn the word upside down. So just
[1:24:57] just just you know just work this one
[1:25:00] out in your head. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; They turn the word upside down.
[1:25:11] Now, I want to take I want to take this
[1:25:13] and and and uh uh uh and see if uh we'll
[1:25:19] find a place here.
[1:25:23] Praise the Lord. Believe that this this
[1:25:26] is from believe that this he started out
[1:25:28] in the ministry and the power and signs
[1:25:32] begins to follow him. Devil begins to
[1:25:34] stream. This is Jesus now. The pre the
[1:25:37] preacher call him a devil. The devil
[1:25:40] call him the son of God.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I put this there so
[1:25:50] you can see how the turning is taking
[1:25:52] place.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; You'll soon see how the turning. There
[1:25:57] are a lot of people that are walking on
[1:25:58] their head. They don't know.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; How sure are you? The north is not down
[1:26:05] and the south is up.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about any kind of h
[1:26:13] uh uh you know uh mysterious thing. I'm
[1:26:17] I'm just trying to talk about common
[1:26:19] sense.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:28] Because here is here right here we see
[1:26:32] that in the scripture the Bible says
[1:26:33] they call him those Pharisees. We read
[1:26:35] it the other night here Wednesday night
[1:26:37] talking abouth in John chapter nine the
[1:26:40] boy that is born blind they are doing
[1:26:42] everything to be able to convince that
[1:26:45] boy that the man that open his eye has a
[1:26:48] devil.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; They are doing everything to convince
[1:26:55] the boy. The boy said whether he has a
[1:26:58] devil or not I don't know what I know.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I was blind
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; but now I can see.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; So uh uh uh uh Jesus went out. He's
[1:27:14] casting out devils. The preachers call
[1:27:16] him devil. The devil call him the son of
[1:27:19] God.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:22] just about as by today says
[1:27:26] I'm scorching preachers with some uh
[1:27:29] some mean. I don't mean there to to to
[1:27:33] be you my brothers. I'm glad. All right.
[1:27:36] But but it is you can go talk to a
[1:27:39] preacher about the signs and wonders
[1:27:42] about what God is doing. They will say
[1:27:44] that's a devil.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; And the devil would turn back and says
[1:27:48] this is the power of God.
[1:27:51] Amen. There's a difference.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And uh uh like Paul and Silas, this was
[1:27:58] uh uh in uh uh just before uh uh uh Acts
[1:28:03] chapter 17 where the Bible says they are
[1:28:06] turning the world upside down. Acts
[1:28:08] chapter 16. And that's that's what he's
[1:28:10] referring to here. They went they went
[1:28:12] into a place. Paul and Silas up there
[1:28:15] one night and all them people were
[1:28:18] saying these are imposters. These men
[1:28:21] turned the world upside down. They are
[1:28:24] imposters. The preachers and a little uh
[1:28:28] old fortune tellers stool on the street
[1:28:31] and said they are the men of God that
[1:28:34] tell us the way of life.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; That was what the little girl said.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You know, she had she had a she had a
[1:28:43] you know a fortune telling spirit on
[1:28:46] her. But when she saw Paul and Silas,
[1:28:48] she said, "These men are are God's men."
[1:28:51] Amen. These men are the men of God. They
[1:28:53] are Gods. They come to tell us about the
[1:28:55] word of life.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; So, can you see that it's upside down
[1:29:01] already?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; But we just have to find out which
[1:29:04] direction it is.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; The world is already upside down. Can
[1:29:09] you see with everything that is
[1:29:10] happening?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Is it enough? Is it not enough to tell
[1:29:14] you that it's upside down?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:18] I I'll show you show you a little bit
[1:29:20] here. I'll show you a little bit. Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; With everything that is happening,
[1:29:28] recognize it before people that profess
[1:29:32] to be Christians and believers. That's
[1:29:34] right. They recognize the power of God.
[1:29:37] They have some conscious of what the
[1:29:39] spirit means. And all we know is just a
[1:29:42] little reading, writing, aromatic, a
[1:29:45] little self-made knowledge. Amen. I tell
[1:29:48] you what we need today is an
[1:29:51] oldfashioned revival. Something that
[1:29:54] will shake us. Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Something that will turn us upside down.
[1:29:58] I think some of us need to be turned
[1:30:00] upside down. We have so much thing
[1:30:02] hanging on us. We so heavy. We need to
[1:30:04] be held by our feet and shake. Let
[1:30:07] everything fall off. Amen. I think
[1:30:09] that's what we need.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Because you need to be light to go in
[1:30:15] this rapture.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You don't want nothing holding you down.
[1:30:18] Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you what we need is an
[1:30:23] oldfashioned revival.
[1:30:29] Till man gets down
[1:30:32] and pay the price and lose sight of the
[1:30:35] word and what's around him.
[1:30:39] He can move into a spear with God and
[1:30:42] tie it there till the Holy Ghost
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; uh tie it there with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] until power comes. Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the believers needs. I need
[1:30:53] it this morning myself.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need it this morning.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together?
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:07] I will I will skip this. Let me come to
[1:31:09] this. Just like we just read this, I'll
[1:31:12] get back to what I just skipped. The
[1:31:14] devil is is the one that turned the
[1:31:16] world upside down from the beginning in
[1:31:17] the first place. God had everything
[1:31:19] perfect. Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He had everything perfect.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He the one did the turning.
[1:31:27] And because of that, God in every age
[1:31:30] raised always raised up a man to turn it
[1:31:32] back. Mhm.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; But because the the the the uh Satan
[1:31:38] civilization that we're playing Satan
[1:31:41] Eden this morning uh on our Sunday
[1:31:43] school Satan civilization
[1:31:46] make make people to to to see the word
[1:31:49] as it is that so much they don't
[1:31:52] understand that the word is upside down.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; So I I I just put in a little note here
[1:31:59] just to remind myself. The devil is the
[1:32:01] one that turned the world upside down.
[1:32:04] Man has got so used to disorder and
[1:32:07] chaos
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; until when they see order and decency.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; They are confused.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; They're so so used to disorder and
[1:32:20] chaos.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That when they see other
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; and decency,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; they take it to be wrong,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; They take it to be old faction.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; They take it to be something. Oh my god.
[1:32:36] I don't know which word it came from.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; It was here. It was here a long time
[1:32:40] ago.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; All this distance was right here.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; But man has got so used to chaos.
[1:32:54] that every other day there there have to
[1:32:56] be some form of violence and every other
[1:32:58] day there just have to be some form of
[1:33:00] chaos. That that is the word and we are
[1:33:03] getting immune to it.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; This word is getting immune to it.
[1:33:10] The spilling of human blood is is I mean
[1:33:12] it's is it's is nothing
[1:33:21] that everybody will be running I mean
[1:33:23] with social media everybody will be
[1:33:25] running and and trying to find the app
[1:33:27] to see how how the killing was done.
[1:33:30] That's a horrible thing.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; That's a life leading someone.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; What pleasure do you have going to see
[1:33:37] how it was done? Yeah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And that gravity thing stays on your
[1:33:41] mind.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; But the word is getting so immune to it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah chapter 5, Isaiah
[1:33:54] would describe
[1:33:56] the cosmo civilization.
[1:33:59] He would describe the world
[1:34:01] civilization.
[1:34:03] If you read Isaiah chapter 5, we know
[1:34:06] that uh uh he was a he was a dynamic
[1:34:09] prophet. So there is six uh uh
[1:34:13] description of the world civilization
[1:34:16] that Isaiah will describe here. He says
[1:34:18] Isaiah 5:8. You can go and read the
[1:34:21] whole thing. I just pulled these ones up
[1:34:23] just to be able to address our subject.
[1:34:26] Woe unto them that join house to house
[1:34:29] that lay feast to feast. Now when you
[1:34:31] hear this thing join house to house and
[1:34:34] lay feast to feed what do you think
[1:34:35] about
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; look at your highways
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; look at your sky strippers
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; that's what we call civilization
[1:34:46] when we have when we have when we have a
[1:34:49] sky stripper where house is joined to
[1:34:52] house and it can go 20th story and 40th
[1:34:55] story look at your highways the fees are
[1:34:59] lay on top of one another.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; But what did he say?
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; How did he describe a war?
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; When that civilization comes, you know,
[1:35:17] you you you find other places around the
[1:35:19] world, countries, they say, "Wow, this
[1:35:21] country don't they don't even have no uh
[1:35:23] uh uh uh how do you call it? Overhead
[1:35:25] bridge."
[1:35:27] that it looks like it's a it's a ter
[1:35:29] word. It's a fourth world country, five
[1:35:31] world country. Where is it on the map?
[1:35:34] No development.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Go look at this other place. See how the
[1:35:37] bridge Oh my god. See the street and and
[1:35:40] everything.
[1:35:42] Even before men got to that
[1:35:45] civilization, a prophet of God cry out
[1:35:47] and say, "Whoa."
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:55] W to them that join house to house and
[1:35:57] feed to field till there is no place
[1:36:00] that they may that that they may be
[1:36:04] placed along the midst of the earth.
[1:36:10] Amen. On that there is no place the
[1:36:13] development see all your your buildings
[1:36:15] here you know all they are just
[1:36:18] expanding building building and yet the
[1:36:20] prices of house are still expensive.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I know
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; we have a we have a homeless
[1:36:27] uh uh population
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and yet uh the buildings are growing up.
[1:36:37] Verse 11, he says, "Woe unto them that
[1:36:40] rise up early in the morning, that they
[1:36:42] may follow strong drink,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; that continue all night till wine
[1:36:49] inflamed them."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's our society.
[1:36:57] Okay? Whether whether it is wine,
[1:36:58] whether it is drugs, that's our society.
[1:37:03] And you see the thing about it that is
[1:37:05] that I say this in a very respectful way
[1:37:08] but it's truth. You realize that many of
[1:37:11] our people in the medical field
[1:37:16] many of our CEO I mean people are
[1:37:19] dealing with so much thing that they
[1:37:21] just need a a a good dose of wine.
[1:37:26] Wine helps them to get their mind.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; People there so much cannot stand the
[1:37:36] pressure out there.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; That they just have to be under the
[1:37:41] influence of something.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; It's an age where everybody is under an
[1:37:48] influence.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; But be under the influence of God.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Be under the influence of the Holy
[1:37:55] Ghost.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You get a dose of the Holy Ghost before
[1:37:57] you go out in the morning.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because I mean if you
[1:38:01] don't get honor and influence, you might
[1:38:04] not be able to stand the things that are
[1:38:05] out there.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, you you you you
[1:38:11] hear nurses talking about it.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; You hear them talking about it.
[1:38:20] Then they should intimidate you a
[1:38:21] daughter of God
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; that get on your knees and pray.
[1:38:33] W unto them that draw iniquity
[1:38:37] with calls of vanity.
[1:38:41] Praise the Lord. When you think about
[1:38:42] that, what's what comes to your mind,
[1:38:46] war unto them that draw iniquity with
[1:38:48] cause of vanity,
[1:38:51] and sin as it were
[1:38:54] a cover up.
[1:38:56] Praise the Lord. Now, Isaiah is is is uh
[1:39:00] uh is is describing on a prophecy. He's
[1:39:04] describing a civilization that is going
[1:39:06] to come.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; What the people will call modern
[1:39:10] civilization. What the people will call
[1:39:13] advancement.
[1:39:18] What unto them that call evil good and
[1:39:21] good evil.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; They put darkness for light and light
[1:39:25] for darkness. Is this not upside down?
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you see this whole thing that is
[1:39:28] upside down?
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And see these men
[1:39:34] trying to bring truth. They trying to
[1:39:36] bring the reality of God among the
[1:39:38] people. They say they turn the world
[1:39:40] upside down. No, they are turning it
[1:39:41] back into order.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; This is the thing that has the whole
[1:39:47] thing upside down.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; When you can look at good and call it
[1:39:51] evil
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; and you look at evil, call it good.
[1:39:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; W to them that are wise in their own
[1:40:02] eyes
[1:40:04] and prudent in their own sight.
[1:40:07] Daniel said, "Knowledge shall increase."
[1:40:09] Isaiah, he's just coming under what
[1:40:11] Isaiah is saying right here, an age of
[1:40:15] knowledge,
[1:40:17] intellectualism.
[1:40:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:23] W unto them that are mighty
[1:40:26] to drink wine,
[1:40:29] a man of strength to mingle strong
[1:40:31] drink.
[1:40:34] Now, so uh uh uh that the reason why I
[1:40:38] skipped this is is because is because of
[1:40:40] that year. Uh it is be not afraid. You
[1:40:43] know it was said of the disciples.
[1:40:48] I believe
[1:40:49] the brother said it. They said this man
[1:40:52] turned the word upside down. They didn't
[1:40:55] turn the word upside down. They just
[1:40:58] turned it back right.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Because it was already upside down.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already upside down. When
[1:41:08] people don't even know decency, they
[1:41:10] don't. They can't even tell whether it's
[1:41:12] hot, whether it's cold. All they want to
[1:41:13] do is just strip themselves naked and
[1:41:16] just be all over the place. Amen. You
[1:41:20] can't tell whether this is bedroom
[1:41:21] clothes or this is uh street clothes.
[1:41:23] And I mean, it's all upside down.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And then when God raised a person up to
[1:41:30] be able to appreciate decency, then they
[1:41:33] say, "Oh, this one, she's upside down."
[1:41:35] No, no, she's turning the right. Yeah,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; that is the position of God's children
[1:41:41] in all ages.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; When the devil turn the world upside
[1:41:45] down, God's people is to set it by
[1:41:48] right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why Paul says that
[1:41:54] the the creation is groaning for the
[1:41:56] manifestation of the sons of God to do
[1:41:59] what? To set it back, right?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; They just turn it. They just turn it
[1:42:11] right. They turn it uh uh back right
[1:42:14] again. It seems upside down to everybody
[1:42:17] else.
[1:42:19] It has been upside down so long till
[1:42:22] they just turn it back right again. And
[1:42:25] that's what the gospel does.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; It set our life right back again.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:33] It keep us from walking on our heads and
[1:42:36] walking sideways and set us back on our
[1:42:39] feet
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; where we can be a son of God, a daughter
[1:42:43] of God. We can know our own worth. Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You were born with your worth.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; You don't need attachment for you to
[1:42:54] walk.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; You don't need attachment. Bracelets,
[1:42:58] clothes, and and head and all that does
[1:43:00] not give you. It reduced your worth.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You have a soul in you that worth
[1:43:06] 10,000.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; When you came from the hands of almighty
[1:43:12] God, you came with a value. You came
[1:43:15] with something that worth everything.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz the life of God, the breath of God
[1:43:21] was in you.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; You don't need all of these attachment
[1:43:24] that we put on for you to walk. Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; So you see that look at look at Noah in
[1:43:36] his days.
[1:43:38] Amen. The Bible says the the the word
[1:43:41] was so evil.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; The imagination of man was wicked.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:51] The scripture says the word not wanting
[1:43:54] of this man.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were called fanatics. It
[1:43:59] looks like Noah was losing his mind. How
[1:44:02] can he talk about rain? We have not
[1:44:04] heard about rain. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; But he was going to turn the world
[1:44:09] upside down.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; He was going to do something that would
[1:44:12] shock the people.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Trying to shake them out of their
[1:44:17] iniquity and their immorality, the evil
[1:44:20] that have come upon the earth.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And he had a message for 120 years.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; To be able to shake that generation into
[1:44:32] place. See, Abraham,
[1:44:37] he turned his word upside down. For the
[1:44:40] first time that people will see a man of
[1:44:42] a 100 years old, a woman that pass
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; bringing forth childmen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ah yeah, that will be
[1:44:52] an ups down because it it it will
[1:44:54] confuse the scientist word, the medical
[1:44:57] word of that time.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When a man hold to the
[1:45:01] promise of God, amen. and believe God's
[1:45:03] word, he has the potential of turning
[1:45:06] this word upside down. He can create
[1:45:08] another one and go right into it.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; That's what the faith of Abraham did.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; He kept confessing that God
[1:45:22] promised me I'll be the father of
[1:45:23] nations.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; They tried to work around the promise
[1:45:28] and and and and compromise and bring
[1:45:30] Hagar in. God said, "No way." I said,
[1:45:32] "By Sarah, you will have a child." No
[1:45:35] matter how long it takes.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; How long it takes, God placed something
[1:45:41] in his word. Many of us, we might not
[1:45:44] reach 90 years old.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; So you can keep believing God.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; If Sarah could reach that age and God
[1:45:51] could visit her, there is no reason why
[1:45:53] for you to give up on God. Amen.
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But Abraham faith turned the world
[1:46:03] upside down.

[1:46:16] trying to make him the the the the hears
[1:46:18] of his home.
[1:46:20] God said, "No, it's not going to be
[1:46:23] Eleazar.
[1:46:25] is is going to be a son that will come
[1:46:27] out of you.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He turned his own word
[1:46:31] upside down.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Look at Moses
[1:46:36] going to Egypt
[1:46:38] now with an army.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; He only had a stick in his hands,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; but he had doubt said the Lord.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; When a man is ready to to to surrender
[1:46:52] to God,
[1:46:54] Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; You see, God has to first turn you
[1:46:57] upside down before he can use you to
[1:46:59] turn the word upside down.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; If you want to turn your world upside
[1:47:03] down and don't want to be turned upside
[1:47:05] down, it's not going to work. Because
[1:47:06] even if the if your word is turned
[1:47:08] upside down, it will be upside down to
[1:47:10] you because you are not turned yet.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; So God has to turn you upside down.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; That's why he did to Moses. He turned
[1:47:20] him upside down. talking to the backside
[1:47:22] of the of the wilderness. Shake him of
[1:47:24] of of all his Egyptian knowledge and
[1:47:27] everything.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Bring him to the to the place of faith
[1:47:31] and faith alone.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; God turned him upside down.
[1:47:42] A military general, a man that learned
[1:47:44] all the wisdom of Egypt. Now Y say he's
[1:47:46] a shepherd boy.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Hear say he's a shepherd, but God shook

[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; God shook him. God God gave him one of
[1:47:58] the most ridiculous career because
[1:48:00] shepherds were abomination to Egyptians.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. Shepherds
[1:48:07] were abomination to Egyptians.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; And with all the Egyptian knowledge he
[1:48:12] come, God say, "Okay, I will send you to
[1:48:14] the more abominable place so you can be
[1:48:16] able to learn me."
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Shock him. Turn his word upside down.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Some of us, we so heavy for God to turn
[1:48:26] us upside down.

[1:48:32] up or you holding to everything.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Don't worry.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; That wind he will use to sweep your feet
[1:48:39] up.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He will not want to turn you upside
[1:48:42] down. You will be spinning.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Keep holding.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:49:42] Praise the Lord. He just changed the
[1:49:44] whole thing that it's not uh this this
[1:49:46] is not an evangelistical thing. I don't
[1:49:48] want you to bring it in an

[1:55:53] and you believe God. Oh, this thing

[1:56:27] you. But yet you believe
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; that something happened.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; but you knew that something happened.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Your your your habits and and and and
[1:56:41] all the things you struggling with in

[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; You too.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Nobody believe. But you
[1:57:08] keep believing.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Now let's listen to what Paul says in
[1:57:12] Ephesians.
[1:57:14] He says, "While we were yet dead in sin
[1:57:19] and trespass,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; you think about it now. You are dead in
[1:57:24] sin and trespass, but yet you believe.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; How much more when you come to life?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; How much more when that seed of faith
[1:57:35] grow
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; to now possess your body?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; To now take control of your habits
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; and your thoughts.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; But while you are yet dead in sin and
[1:57:47] trespass,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness. Amen.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; If you can believe being a dead man
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; in sin,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; how much more now
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; that you have come to life?
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; How much more now that the grace of God
[1:58:00] have resurrected you that you have to
[1:58:03] hold on to it?
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; No, no man believe that this man is dead
[1:58:16] beside this man. You can't believe it
[1:58:18] more than him. If he was not there, he
[1:58:20] would get up and tell you say, "I'm not
[1:58:21] there."
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; But for the fact that he can't talk,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; you cannot believe that he's dead more
[1:58:29] than himself.
[1:58:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. People has been caught up in in in
[1:58:41] in a situation where uh uh uh you know
[1:58:44] they are not they are not gaining pause
[1:58:46] and and and and you know uh uh uh think
[1:58:49] and and they've been pronounced uh uh uh
[1:58:52] uh dead.
[1:58:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; But they were they were not dead.
[1:59:00] I I have one of my little sister that
[1:59:02] was in that situation some years ago out
[1:59:05] of an accident and uh uh uh you know the
[1:59:08] the rush up to the to to the mall and
[1:59:10] all of that and and and now people has
[1:59:12] been in that situation but because they
[1:59:14] are not there they come out.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding where I'm going
[1:59:23] with this?
[1:59:28] But when you commit it to God and let
[1:59:30] him have it, then he will do it. You
[1:59:34] just believe him. Just stand back and
[1:59:38] don't work. But believe
[1:59:41] that word grace is imputed for
[1:59:45] righteousness to believe that God will.
[1:59:50] Hallelujah.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I I I I I place this there
[1:59:54] because I I use this year just commit
[1:59:58] them to God. Now down here is a
[2:00:01] testimony of Susanna Wesley that had 17
[2:00:05] children.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And h her husband
[2:00:10] was a preacher. Samuel, he was a
[2:00:12] preacher and he was a Meodist preacher
[2:00:15] and and and and
[2:00:18] a fire brand too. He was I mean he was
[2:00:20] he was a fire brand and this guy was
[2:00:22] very legalistic
[2:00:25] in prison.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. I mean he was a strong preacher. I
[2:00:29] mean that that was what he knew at that
[2:00:31] time.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And and uh you know and and for his uh
[2:00:36] his his faith, you know, uh and and and
[2:00:39] and the way that he wanted to to bring
[2:00:42] his children. There's just a lot that we
[2:00:44] could say, but I want to dwell on Sister
[2:00:46] Susanna Wesley this morning. and she has
[2:00:48] 17 children. And with uh with them 17
[2:00:52] children uh uh back 100 years ago, she
[2:00:56] could still uh uh take from two or three
[2:01:00] hours a day in all of her busy schedule
[2:01:04] to read the gospel and to pray. Amen.
[2:01:08] For her children, read her gospel and to
[2:01:11] pray for her children. It was said that
[2:01:13] uh children knew when mama had her apron
[2:01:15] on her face that the house need to be
[2:01:18] quiet. Amen. Just like Habacu said, "The
[2:01:20] Lord is in his holy temple. Let the
[2:01:22] earth keep silence." When mama had her
[2:01:24] apron on her face, the earth need to be
[2:01:27] silenced
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; because mama was praying. Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; They knew that they grew under that. But
[2:01:32] you see, here is the thing here. What
[2:01:33] I'm dwelling on is that she was
[2:01:36] committing them to God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was committing them to God.
[2:01:43] She was committing them to God. John was
[2:01:45] one of the youngest one. And what
[2:01:47] happened is they the uh uh uh his other
[2:01:51] sisters and you know they they really
[2:01:53] had trouble in in in their marriages
[2:01:56] because of the position of their dad.
[2:01:59] That thing scared John Wesley. They
[2:02:01] actually got married late. It scared
[2:02:04] him.
[2:02:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:09] But here is the thing here is that 17
[2:02:12] children she was committing them to God
[2:02:14] and uh found time through her busy
[2:02:16] schedule. What happened? She had a John
[2:02:20] and a Charles Wesley out of there that
[2:02:23] turned the world upside down.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] with all of that uh dedication and
[2:02:33] commitment and prayer,
[2:02:37] God was able to raise up a seed.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; God was able to to to to bless these two
[2:02:47] boys. Charles was the singer. John was
[2:02:50] the preacher.
[2:02:57] Why? Because a mother
[2:03:00] committed it to God and left it there.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even though it was not
[2:03:06] looking like the the way it should look.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; It was not looking like the way that the
[2:03:16] mind would tells you.
[2:03:19] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes our trials is just
[2:03:22] like taking pain pills.
[2:03:25] Oh, being under anesthesia.
[2:03:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; I mean they they gave you the medication
[2:03:33] for pain.
[2:03:35] Your body, your mind have sense a pain
[2:03:40] in your body. It have sense an illness
[2:03:42] in your body. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; With this hit you have had or this cut,
[2:03:48] your mind tells you there is pain. But
[2:03:50] when you take the pain pills, it deceive
[2:03:53] your mind.
[2:03:56] Your mind say, "Oh, I thought there was
[2:03:58] pain.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, there is no pain."
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, your mind goes in
[2:04:05] this place to believe that there is no
[2:04:07] pain. But when the medicine starts to
[2:04:10] wear out,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then your mind is I thought there
[2:04:16] was no pain. I was expecting pain but
[2:04:19] out of a and and sometimes that is the
[2:04:21] way it is. We we commit things to God
[2:04:24] with a mindset.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; We have something on our mind. We are
[2:04:30] believing that when I pray for this,
[2:04:32] this is the way that God is going to
[2:04:34] answer it. This is the way it's going.
[2:04:36] So, we have that mind set. But then when
[2:04:40] the trial of life comes,
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; it shock our mind. Oh, I thought it was
[2:04:44] going to happen like this.
[2:04:47] So, you see, then your mind goes in that
[2:04:49] place. Well, but this is what I prayed
[2:04:53] for. This is not what I asked for. This
[2:04:56] is not what I was expecting.
[2:04:59] So, your mind goes into that place. You
[2:05:01] see, that is the reason why we must not
[2:05:04] be dwelling up here. We must make sure
[2:05:06] that it's something that is sealed down
[2:05:08] in our heart. It's a conviction just
[2:05:11] like a h a shedra me.
[2:05:15] We know that God will deliver us.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; It was in here. We know it was in here.
[2:05:21] It was something that was established.
[2:05:24] It was something that that their
[2:05:25] conviction. We know
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; that God is a deliverer.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; But now our mind is going through a
[2:05:33] shock. Why is why is this? They said the
[2:05:36] the the the the furnace is going to be
[2:05:38] heated seven times. They they are
[2:05:40] hearing it. They they are hearing that
[2:05:42] guys, you going to go to the fire.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Are you not changing your mind? Are you
[2:05:47] not changing your testimony?
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; No. If they were up here, they will have
[2:05:52] reason with one another.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; But you see, their faith was so much
[2:05:57] down here.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; They their faith was solidly their life.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; That they knew that God will deliver
[2:06:05] them.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:12] So if it does not if it does not uh h
[2:06:17] appear in the way that we think about it
[2:06:20] then our mind goes into a shock.
[2:06:23] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:26] We starts to feel this pain. I mean I've
[2:06:28] been a believer how can I go through
[2:06:30] this? I've been serving God all. How can
[2:06:32] I go through this? Oh your your your
[2:06:34] faith has to rest down.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; It has to rest down. It has to leave
[2:06:40] your first conscious and become your
[2:06:43] second conscious.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; The reason why your faith has to become
[2:06:47] your second conscious because most of
[2:06:50] your reaction comes from your second
[2:06:52] conscious.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Your subconscious.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Most of your reaction comes from your
[2:06:58] subconscious.
[2:07:00] Because the things that we deal with in
[2:07:02] life, the way they hits us, the the the
[2:07:05] the the experiences we go through has
[2:07:09] the tendency of residing in our
[2:07:11] subconscious.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; So when something appear like that, it
[2:07:15] gives you an attitude.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see when faith goes down
[2:07:21] and and and reside in your subconscious
[2:07:25] when faith sits down in your
[2:07:27] subconscious and become your reaction
[2:07:30] that's when we can we can rejoice in
[2:07:32] tribulation.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; That's when we can bless God in
[2:07:37] tribulation. Why? Because your reaction
[2:07:39] is coming from a place of faith.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] They turn the world upside down.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's our time.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; It's our time.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be fanatics about it.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; We are going to be solic.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; We are going to be solic
[2:08:10] fanatic about it. You read the book of
[2:08:12] Acts, you'll see that uh I mean some
[2:08:15] another place they got to throw Paul in
[2:08:16] a basket and get him out of the city
[2:08:18] quickly because they knew that these
[2:08:20] guys were angry.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You know that I mean that is the reason
[2:08:25] why we we we just we just choose a love
[2:08:29] to live a simple Christian life. Amen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Not becoming fanatic, you know, and
[2:08:36] insulting people on the street. That's
[2:08:37] not Christianity.
[2:08:39] becoming a bigot. That's not
[2:08:41] Christianity.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; It's not all about what we say. It's a
[2:08:49] it's is it's the way we live. That's
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; It's the ability that we have to be able
[2:08:54] to self others.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; If you want to be self,
[2:08:59] then you are God that is sitting in this
[2:09:02] temple.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you have make yourself God so
[2:09:07] we can come and serve you and worship
[2:09:08] you.
[2:09:11] Are we together?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; That is our time. This is our time. This
[2:09:14] is our age. This is the bright age. The
[2:09:17] omega age where she's turning the word
[2:09:20] upside down.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Because the the the the mind that the
[2:09:26] entire world is going on. She's looking
[2:09:28] in the seals. She's seeing what is
[2:09:30] coming. Amen. She's seeing the prophecy
[2:09:32] that are being fulfilled. She's not
[2:09:34] reading the news like the way the word
[2:09:36] is reading the news.
[2:09:38] Praise the Lord. When she hear in the
[2:09:40] news that Roger threw something by the
[2:09:42] border of of Poland, she says, "Oh my
[2:09:45] God,
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; is that the ter?" Because she's looking,
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; the man of Christ has come to send us
[2:09:52] back to the word, not to send us to CNN.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's exact.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or to Wall Street is to go back to
[2:09:59] the word.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when everybody is on a panic,
[2:10:07] she's just resting.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; She's just resting. She's just spreading
[2:10:13] her wings
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; in the written word and the spoken word,
[2:10:17] the New Testament, and the Old
[2:10:19] Testament.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; She said whatever happened just going to
[2:10:22] lift me out of here.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; She's turning her word upside down.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2:10:43] Let me just read one thing to you and
[2:10:44] then we close this morning.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. I know.
[2:10:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:00] That's what happens.
[2:11:03] I told myself I will forget about this
[2:11:05] and yes I did. But uh I still have it
[2:11:08] here. So I think I can I can be able to
[2:11:13] get back and share that with you.
[2:11:20] This was my first quote in my notes but
[2:11:23] then I end up making it my
[2:11:27] try to make it my last. That's what I
[2:11:29] wanted to rest on this morning, but then
[2:11:32] I didn't I didn't add it to my slide.
[2:11:35] So, I would just read it to you and then
[2:11:38] we we find a place to close this
[2:11:40] morning. Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to be praised.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy to be praised.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; This is our time,
[2:12:08] people.
[2:12:09] This is our time.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; May God help us. I don't know what
[2:12:18] you're dealing with, you know, in your
[2:12:20] life,
[2:12:22] but uh the first thing I want to find I
[2:12:25] want you to find out is that which
[2:12:28] direction are you are you are you
[2:12:30] standing or are you have you been turned
[2:12:32] over by this thing?
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Have this thing turned you over? It
[2:12:37] looks like uh your feet are in the head
[2:12:39] and your head is down.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because you first have to know your
[2:12:42] position. You have to know where you
[2:12:44] are.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just like God saying,
[2:12:47] "Adam, Adam, where are you asking Adam,
[2:12:51] do you know your position?
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Are you in your place?"
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; He was not looking for Adam. He's the
[2:12:56] all known God.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; But he wanted Adam to know whether he
[2:13:00] knew where he was.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm saying this morning.
[2:13:04] You have to know where you are, where
[2:13:06] you standing.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Because we have a word. We have a
[2:13:11] message.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. that have come to turn us upside
[2:13:14] down, to set us right,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; turn us away from our sin and our
[2:13:19] desires and uh and walliness and evil
[2:13:22] and set us on our feet.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't say you're on your
[2:13:26] feet. I mean, when you when you stay
[2:13:28] licking the dust like the serpent,
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; the serpent was kicked up off his feet.
[2:13:33] God said on your belly you will go.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says. God says
[2:13:38] on your belly. He if he was on his
[2:13:40] belly, God won't tell him on your belly
[2:13:42] you will go.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; And the dust,
[2:13:50] praise the Lord.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; You have to know that this flesh is
[2:13:55] dust.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; When you so involved in in in in fleshly
[2:13:58] things, you are licking the dust.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:08] the bus you will go.
[2:14:11] That's why he told he told Adam, "Praise
[2:14:15] the Lord." Let me do something very
[2:14:17] quickly here and then I will let you go.
[2:14:21] Thank you for bearing with me. Praise
[2:14:23] the Lord.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; God is good
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. We want to just thank
[2:14:31] him for, you know, just being uh who he
[2:14:35] is to us.
[2:14:36] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's an awesome God.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; He's an awesome God.
[2:14:48] Emmanuel, I sent you something back
[2:14:49] there. Can you put it up? Take this
[2:14:50] slide down. We are done with this. And
[2:14:52] then let's let's just close with this.
[2:14:58] Let's just close with this. The Apostle
[2:15:00] Paul said
[2:15:08] this this was my first quote. It was
[2:15:11] actually my uh my inspiration
[2:15:15] but then I I choose to make it the last
[2:15:17] and I didn't put it in the slide.
[2:15:21] Paul said, "Now year
[2:15:24] I know I preach the gospel.
[2:15:27] That's my duty."
[2:15:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm a preacher.
[2:15:36] He's a preacher. Bernie is a preacher.
[2:15:38] That's that's our duty is to be a
[2:15:42] preacher.
[2:15:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:45] Well, that's just what we supposed to
[2:15:48] do.
[2:15:50] But let me do something. Paul said that
[2:15:53] is beyond.
[2:15:56] Let me do something.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. I must go to church.
[2:16:03] You know, I must pay my tithe. And all
[2:16:05] of those things are beautiful. They all
[2:16:06] But let me do something
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; just beyond that.
[2:16:15] Now I have got a right to take up money.
[2:16:19] Paul said, but I'm going to make tanks
[2:16:21] just to show you I can sacrifice.
[2:16:24] He said it's honorable. Marriage is
[2:16:27] honorable among all the best undefined
[2:16:30] is good for the man to be married. He
[2:16:32] said I got a right to be married. I
[2:16:35] could be married. I got a legal right to
[2:16:38] be married, but I just won't get
[2:16:40] married. I want to do another sacrifice
