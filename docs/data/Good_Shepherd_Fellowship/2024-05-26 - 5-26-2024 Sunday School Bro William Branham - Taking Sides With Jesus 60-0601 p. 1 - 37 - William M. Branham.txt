========================================
for [Music] SC called um uh let's see Dog Patch restaurant I got one today when anyone eats there then they take the money that you gave them and send the church the tithing off of it it's somewhere at 319 West Jefferson Street I guess that's why Billy had it laying here so they could see um That's mighty nice now Brethren I don't know what your procedure of of man's meeting just what you do or how you conduct your meetings and if I get off a schedule here why off the regular routine why you call my attention to it it was purpose tonight I thought as I had uh a dinner not long ago with our most beloved Pastor brother Neville and I was saying something to him what was on my heart heart and I thought if we get a bunch of man together and the ministers our uh colleagues here of the gospel and man we could talk to one another in a way that we wouldn't talk it before the public because we're all and we're man at understand is man Christian man and that way uh usually in a congregation a group you say something and and want to lean it a little this way and want to lean it that way and and then it goes all out but where we come to try tonight to tell you what I have in my heart uh concerning the church and it's uh and it's uh place and its position and then if we get on in time I would like to speak to you just a little bit on the word if it's all right just kind of settle that so we'll get our business part or the part that I like like to express to you first and I guess maybe you let out regular time about 9:30 or something like that like each night well I'll try not to keep you long tomorrow Saturday it's a big commercial day but now uh we have to get our groceries and so forth I want to say to brother Neville publicly and I I I want to say to each one of you just like I was talking privately to you just each one because you're a group that that's uh I really think that and believe and teach that man God has made man leadership of his church it's his people see and it's uh as I was preaching down to brother um juny Jackson's last night about God fortified his his people with his word and it was a woman that broke through that line and give vent to reason and when it did God forever has always placed it for his uh for man to keep his church fortified by word now uh I want to encourage brother Neville just a little talking to him privately I noticed last night the Zer has struck me two or three times I was in the pulpit and I turned around because I'm trying to keep as far away from it as I can until I find out what the dream meant to me here not long ago few weeks ago it stuck with me for a long time I told it you're in the church about something about the message and and discernment and so forth it just didn't just wasn't coming out right to my opinion that time's over and um I may be wrong on that but I noticed that it um brother Neville was kind of weary and upset and I just want you to know brother Neville that you're only anticipating in this Fellowship in that have you just noticed what Satan's tried to do in the last few days what ministers is associated in this Fellowship just stopped for a few minutes and wonder here says brother CH sitting here tonight almost killed up there on the road see and uh I almost had my headbo off with a shotgun or with a rifle see Satan trying to take us and there you crashed right in and could have killed yourself and some woman also see just the ministers look at just the the ministering group it's Satan and he's trying to get rid of us now we are realized that we're not assembl here to talk on some kind of a business we're here to assemble to talk on the on Christ and the Holts to take a Hal and what to do for this present time and I I want to encourage you brother Neville uh be courageous no matter what comes up up what goes what takes place just don't let nothing beset you just stand there Like a Rock of Ages and God will make everything come out all right he's proved that to you of course you could have upset you that could have killed that woman and that been on your mind the rest of your days and it' been a lot of things but God was still on the throne he he lets those things work out all right it could taken us too and um so Satan fighting at the church now when I laid that Cornerstone there that morning I never felt that I'd ever be a pastor it wasn't in my callings at the beginning and my first call was to be on the field of evangelism as many years ago and started off over here in a tent just across the street and I remember when brother Roy Davis down there and his church burnt down that bunch of people was just like scattered sheep without a Shepherd had no place to go and I Mr hipsen BG was chief of police then and he called me down there he said to me I we're here to help you said I'm Catholic myself but said them people said they don't probably have the clothes is during the time of the depression said to go to other churches they feel out of place and they're good people I know many of them he said Billy if you want to start a church he said I want you to know that we're behind you and anything we can do to help you and I thanked him for it we had a tag Day first we prayed and asked the Lord and people come to to me wanted to build a church so I could have a place to go and uh we decided this place and one night long this time or a little further here in a pile of horse weeds right along in here and water this ditch and just had been a like a dump light well the Lord spoke to me definitely said build it right here not a penny of money and among us we had about about 80 cents or a dollar and that of course you would laugh at that now but brother that was some money then when something neighbor cook a pot of beans and get the neighbor hadn't had enough for two or three days come over and eat a few of them that was hard times a lot of the young fellas never seen that well that was Hardo I've seen the time that you could pass through this church a collection plate two times or three and get 30 cents I have a place packed full and beg for it it would you probably got 30 cents and had a good offering it's really rough going and we had nothing to build with yet the the desire of the people people was to build a church so he could have a place to go because in them days the message well you think it's badly thought of now you ought to know it then when there's nobody and then this water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and the blessings and things that we believe in and stand for so upon my heart I made a promise to God that we would stay here and build a tabernacle the morning we laid the Cornerstone he met me over there in a vision about 8:00 that morning when I was sitting there watching out across the Sun coming up just about this time of year and he had told me after he had met me down there on the river but that when the angel of the Lord appeared in the that light and I seen it in the distance it looked like a star and it come right down over where I was and them notable words was spoken and uh so then uh purpose then to get a place for the people to worship in now I thought myself it ain't for me it's nothing to me but yet anything that's con pertaining to God is part of me no matter if it's anything that it's uh for God's children it's for me whether it's my duty to do this or do that it's my duty to see to God's Heritage regardless of where it's at see just like you'd say well my like is a little boy say my my business is just to chop the wood not pack it in let John pack it in I don't care if snow falls or it rains let him get out and get it no it's your duty as a as a a child of that home to see that that wood don't get wet for your mother see pack it in if they say well Frank should have went and got the water it ain't my business but if Frank didn't get the water it's your business to take care of the water that's all uh that's just way it runs and that's way it runs in God's family too if somebody of them some of them said not long ago said quit preaching the way you are my goodness you go to ruin every friend you got and everything like that said let that alone I know it's wrong but my it ain't our business well whose business is it then if it's wrong somebody's got to do it so let's just do it and that's way I feel about the church the building programs and so forth has come up down up and down and there's been pro and con in the buildings and so forth one wanted the other didn't want it and this that you you find it like that you find that as you deal amongst ministers amongst businessmen amongst lodges everywhere you go where you got a group of man you you got different ideas and so therefore you've got to have one person that you put confidence in and elect that person all work with that just like in the Army you got to have one as a general that's a headquarters the captain says this he's the captain of that group but then the general can change his orders and the chief Commanding General of course is Jesus Christ in the church and his ministers are his uh captains of the companies that that's representing him here on Earth and they have tried many things the little Tabernacle here and finally I kept quiet in it just to see after I'd built it and then the Lord called me out into the field about 15 16 years ago and I left the church but still I just can't turn it out I've always kept my name attached to it so that I could be a vote sometime if the wrong thing got started in here I'd have a right to come and and stop it because I've sweated it out for many years behind this for pit 17 years in here to keep the thing straight when all kinds of isms and ins and outs and every kind of a cult and being the inner denomination everything that flew in flew in this way and by the help of God we stood here with the unadulterated gospel and she still stands the same tonight so we but this times at this church has been tried to be sold out from under me and everything else like that if my name wasn't attached to it down there why it sure would be been an awful fix tonight not and it wasn't me it was God of course that did it and then as I see it now coming into the place that it is and we're living in a great hour it's still my interest to say something about this church see because it's it's a part of me no matter whether I'm here or not it's still a part of me and it's my duty to see to it that it operates clean clear and the best I can for the kingdom of God and I'm very grateful that in these days I see it's got little satellites to it and I am grateful for brother uh C she and his Sellersburg group and brother back there that just taken brother snelling's place at udica and brother rutle up here and brother Junior Jackson and those precious boys who are fine man wonderful man of God they preach this message now they may one might disagree just literally up on something another that's only human amongst the group of the ministers yet and um if ministers have a little difference there won't be a a shadow of a difference in it maybe one might say I believe that the Millennium will come and Jesus will be on a white horse and other say I believe when he comes he'll come on a white cloud well as long as they believe he's coming that's the main thing see no matter how he's coming just they believe he's coming and making ready for it and um that way I have tried to find out and I've been studying I told it out before the congregation I've been studying the early church and I watched the way that those anointed man uh prepared uh the house of the Lord and the order of the Lord's Worship in the house and it struck me real real good and I preach here some time ago and upon the subject of Joel uh two I will restore sayeth the Lord all the years of the Palmer worm eating in a c caterpillar and caner worm and so forth and um I begin to study on that about what these men did and the way that they um taking care of the church that God had left him overseer now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it for about five minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen 12 and uh one of them had fallen and they chose methus to take his place and the Holy Spirit waited until all this was an order before it come they had to choose one to take the bishoy of of Judas that fell a transgression to fulfill the scripture and I believe that all these things has a time of lingering waiting but it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled that everything gets right everything in order waiting many times we get p impatient like a child we great get great anticipations and many times jump way ahead and that that just hinders the work until the work gets caught up you see we must just move reverently have a purpose in heart that God if he would desire to use us and such and such but wait till he makes the opening because he has to go be ahead of us remember David David going to battle that night he was weary about that fight and he laid under those mberry trees until he heard the Lord in the rumbling of the leaves going before him then he went with courage because he know that God had gone before him and if we only do that Brethren knowing the battle must come but we must wait till we see the hand of God going before us to make a way now I noticed that how the churches the evangelism started scattering out everywhere and then we'll take for instance the Paul becoming a great missionary to our people we find out that he went about wherever the Lord led him and he established the church and it was a new Faith the churches of those days like in Asia Minor all throughout Europe they they didn't believe that message and when he had the uh preach the message and many he was converted to it then there was no one if he left the people in that condition they'd wander right back out into their pagan gods and into Judaism and whatever more because the people had no one to teach them the the converts they had no place to go so Paul established churches in different parts of the country each one of these churches he left someone who was an order a man that was trustworthy a man that was known as a pastor Shepherd or uh then after this church then become other little churches come out of it young man and old man raised up and become uh churches out of that the man that was over the first church church was called the bishop and then his that went out from him his children was called Shepherds or pastors and then this group of little churches all would come back to this bishop like in the time of irenius he carried on the same thing Martin carried on the same thing polycarp carried on the same thing right on down through the age they had that and and the Apostle of the church the apostle that was the Paul and when Paul left John took over the church and when John left poar Tak it over when polycarp left irenius Tak it over and on down Martin and so forth just kept on going until the Roman Catholic Church broke the whole thing to pieces and burned him and Scattered him and the polymer worm eat this and the canker worm eat that and so forth eat that and eat that until they brought it Plum down to a stall now but God promised to restore again that same thing I have I do believe with all my heart that we're living in the last days amen I believe that there there's not too much would break this anything in my inter interpretation may be wrong of the scriptures that Jesus could not come tonight I believe it what Little's left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled before daylight in the morning and I'd see and I may be wrong on the time of that fulfilling but it's at hand the I believe that and remember Paul believed that John believe that polyart believe that irenius believe that Martin believe that all the rest of them believe what if God would have told John the Revelator now it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming John would have come back and told the church well I guess we might as well eat drink be married cus to go to be many generations see uh Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years see so see the church have been loose there have been no on the mark there have been no way and after all it's your anticipations if you fall asleep in that watch that you wake with them same anticipations because they going to hinder one thing you're going to be right there on time anyhow see what I mean now when when St Martin awakes in the resurrection St Paul all the rest of them it'll be just as fresh as if they was right in the battle battling right away cuz he went right down under those same anticipations looking for his coming and there'll be a scream coming up will come the whole church you see that'll be it so it doesn't matter see we've got to be looking for him right now even we don't know it it could be possibly it could be a hundred years from now it could be 500 years a thousand years 10,000 years I don't know nobody knows but say for instance that we live each day that he was coming that day if we live like he was coming this day when we awake if we sleep and we awake in the resurrection it'll be just as fresh as if we just fallen asleep just woke up a trumpet will sound the dead in Christ shall rise first we which alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in air see so it be just as fresh but now until that time until he comes we want to live each day like he might come the next minute because it might be the end of your life at that minute you you don't know when you're going this may be some of our last breath we have it in us now so you want to live like it is but now to carry on further we've got to put footprint here on the sands of time that others can see if Paul had went on the way he did then John wouldn't have know how to follow if John hadn't went on polyart wouldn't have know how to follow if carp wouldn't have went on irenius wouldn't have known how to follow irenius wouldn't have went on Martin would have known how to follow see what I mean each one has to put footprints on the sands of time well if I thought that there was a denomination or any other group of Believers that had anything better than we have here Brethren I would I want to emerge this little body with it right quick I've waited I have longed I have been under anticipations and believe that some great one was coming someday or maybe the great prophet that a speak will come of the Elijah I've always believed and thought maybe that maybe I'd live to see the day that when I could change when I'd see that person rise on the scene then I could take my little church and say Brethren this is the man we have looked for this man he is the one I've waited for that and if actually that has passed then I'm looking to say it from up here Brethren this is the one coming from here see and I I want to see the church kept up like that I must have stepped on something or done something and put a lot of uh more uh life in that thing so um now I would like to say this that now that this is an established church let me just stop [Music]
