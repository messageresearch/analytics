[1:08] [Music]
[1:12] Let's remain standing just a moment now
[1:14] for the word of the Lord. Let's turn to
[1:17] Amos, the prophet Amos the third chapter
[1:21] beginning with the first verse. I want
[1:23] to thank Sister Wanita and Anna Jean and
[1:27] Sister Moore for that lovely course of
[1:30] songs that brought me back. As I said
[1:32] over there and listen to it, I was
[1:34] thinking when they were with us singing
[1:36] in the campaign, Brother Jack and I were
[1:39] talking them girls were little bitty
[1:41] girls, just little 16 something like
[1:43] that girl. Now I think Sister Anigene
[1:46] has five children. Sister uh um Wanita
[1:51] is has a mother of two children and we
[1:53] are really closer to that sunset women
[1:55] and we was then about 16 years
[1:58] difference won't be long we'll be
[2:00] crossing over by glorious time now in
[2:03] Amos the third chapter let's
[2:06] read hear
[2:08] this word that the Lord has spoken
[2:11] against you oh children of Israel
[2:13] against the whole family which I brought
[2:15] up
[2:17] out of Egypt, saying, You only have I
[2:20] known all the families of the
[2:23] earth. Therefore, I will punish you for
[2:26] your iniquity. Can two walk together,
[2:29] except they be agreed? Will a lion roar
[2:32] in the forest when he has taken no prey?
[2:35] Will a young lion cry out of his den?
[2:38] He's taken nothing. Can a bird fall in a
[2:41] snare upon the earth, or no jin is for
[2:44] him? Shall one take up a snare from the
[2:48] earth and having taken nothing from it?
[2:50] Shall the trumpet be blown in the city
[2:52] and the people not be afraid? Shall
[2:55] there be evil in the city and the Lord
[2:58] has not done it? Surely the Lord will do
[3:01] nothing, but he reveals his secrets to
[3:04] his servants, the prophets. The lion has
[3:08] roared. Who shall not fear? The Lord has
[3:12] spoken. Who can but prophesy? Let us bow
[3:16] our heads. Lord
[3:19] Jesus, may this thy word, Lord, may we
[3:23] have fellowship tonight around this
[3:26] portion. We pray, Lord, that you'll give
[3:28] us a context for the text that we shall
[3:32] take from here. And may it bring honor
[3:35] to thee. Bless us as we're waiting,
[3:38] Lord, tonight upon thy word. Heal the
[3:41] sick and afflicted. Save the lost.
[3:45] uh give strength to the feeble Lord
[3:47] that's getting weak both physically and
[3:50] spiritually and give us a great
[3:52] outpouring of thy presence for we ask
[3:55] that in Jesus name.
[4:02] Amen. I wish to take for a text from
[4:04] this tonight spiritual amnesia.
[4:11] Don't forget tomorrow. It's a prayer for
[4:14] the sick. Tomorrow we expect the Lord to
[4:16] do exceeding great things. Tomorrow
[4:18] afternoon at 2 o'clock where we when we
[4:21] begin our services, the boy will be here
[4:23] to give out prayer cards and everyone
[4:25] will be prayed for that wants to be
[4:26] prayed for. And we're expecting a great
[4:29] time uh tomorrow in the Lord. Now you
[4:32] people are here visiting from out of
[4:33] town. Remember there's fine full gospel
[4:36] churches all through the city. You're
[4:38] welcome to all of them. I was just
[4:40] talking to one of my associate pastors
[4:42] outside just come in. Brother uh
[4:44] Jackson, formerly a Methodist church
[4:46] down a city or two below us. And how
[4:49] many is sure that's associated with the
[4:51] tabernacle? Let's see your hands
[4:53] everywhere. My I'm sure we're glad to
[4:55] have you down. This is the closest
[4:57] meeting I've been to Indiana for quite a
[5:00] while. Thinking about coming back pretty
[5:02] soon and putting up a tent and having
[5:04] those seven last trumpets, the Lord
[5:06] willing. So now, but remember tomorrow,
[5:10] don't forget it. Tomorrow at
[5:12] 2:00 and now our next service will begin
[5:15] next week in Tampa, Florida. Now, I want
[5:19] to speak on spiritual an
[5:22] amnesia. Now, this little fell that
[5:24] we're talking about, Amos, just for a
[5:26] moment to get our background before we
[5:28] get to the text. This was during the
[5:31] time of the great prosperity in Samaria.
[5:35] Israel had prospered. they had really uh
[5:38] went after the world and it prospered.
[5:41] Not always prosperity is a sign of
[5:43] spiritual blessings. But sometimes on
[5:46] the contrary, people think maybe you
[5:49] have to own a lot of worldly goods and
[5:52] shows that God's a blessing. That's not
[5:54] true. Uh sometimes it's the other way.
[5:57] But we find him. We don't know much
[6:00] about this little fella. He we have no
[6:03] history where he come from. We know he
[6:04] according to the scripture here. He's a
[6:06] herdsman. But God had raised him up. I
[6:10] can imagine seeing on one hot day in
[6:12] Samaria there the one of the great
[6:14] tourist cities of the world at that day.
[6:16] Something on the order of we say Miami
[6:19] or or Hollywood, Los Angeles, some of
[6:21] them places like that. Some great place
[6:24] for
[6:25] tourists. And we u just imagine you see
[6:28] him never been in such a city but he had
[6:31] the word of the Lord. He was coming to
[6:33] this great uh city where sin was heaped
[6:37] on every side. The ministers had all got
[6:39] away from the word of God and they
[6:41] hadn't had a prophet in long years. And
[6:43] so this little fell as he topped the
[6:45] hill just uh kind of north of Samaria. I
[6:49] can imagine seeing the hot sun shining
[6:52] down, his gray whiskers over his face
[6:54] and his little eyes narrowed and his
[6:56] little bald head shine as he looked down
[6:58] upon that city and his eyes narrowed. He
[7:01] wasn't looking at what tourists usually
[7:03] see to go to a city to see all of its
[7:05] enchantments of beauty. He looked and
[7:07] seen what a sight that that city had
[7:09] become. A city that once was a city of
[7:12] God and had gotten such a morally decay
[7:15] is that. No wonder this little unknown
[7:18] fella was Amos the prophet. And now we
[7:22] don't know very much about him. We don't
[7:24] know where he come from. Prophets
[7:26] usually come on the scene unknown. Lead
[7:28] the same way. We don't know where they
[7:29] come from, where they go, don't know
[7:31] about their backgrounds. God just raises
[7:33] them
[7:34] up. He wasn't much to look at, but he
[7:38] had thus sayeth the Lord. That's the
[7:41] main thing. I see. Of course, he come to
[7:44] Samaria to begin his campaign. I'm sure
[7:47] he had no cooperation from nobody. He
[7:50] had no fellowship card from any uh
[7:53] denomination. He had no credentials to
[7:55] show what group he come from. And but he
[7:58] had one thing. He had the word of the
[8:01] Lord for that city. And I wonder if we
[8:05] could transport Amos today down to our
[8:08] time. I wonder if he'd be welcome in our
[8:12] city today. I wonder if we would receive
[8:14] him or would we do just like they did.
[8:17] We find our cities in the same decay.
[8:20] And we find that sin is just great among
[8:23] the people as it was then. And I wonder
[8:26] if this little unknown man, how is he
[8:29] going to start this campaign? How
[8:31] where's he going to begin at? What
[8:33] church is he going to or who's going to
[8:34] cooperate with him? He had nothing to
[8:37] show where he come from. He had nothing
[8:39] at all. But thus saith the Lord for the
[8:43] city. He found them so decayed and so
[8:46] morally corrupted. It was a great time.
[8:48] The women in that city had become almost
[8:52] like they are in the United States. They
[8:54] had become corrupt. Everything that God
[8:56] had expected out of them, they went
[8:58] right the other way. And and we'd find
[9:01] that it was a great place where they had
[9:04] dancings on the street, the women
[9:06] immorally stripping their clothes and so
[9:08] forth like strip tees. Of course, that
[9:10] was a public amusement in them days. Now
[9:12] it's every day. Just let the weather get
[9:13] hot and you don't have to go to any
[9:15] show. You're all on the street anywhere.
[9:17] Anyhow, shame on you women to do a thing
[9:20] like that. You ashamed yourself. And um
[9:23] and then I said that to a woman here not
[9:25] long ago and she said why? She said uh
[9:28] brother Brandham said that that's uh uh
[9:31] that's just like the rest of women. I
[9:33] said but we are not supposed to act like
[9:34] the rest of the people. We are
[9:36] different. We are uh a different
[9:39] character. Reminds me of a woman said
[9:43] well brother Brandon another said I I
[9:45] don't wear those shorts and I wear
[9:46] slacks. I said that's worse. God said
[9:49] it's an abomination in his sight for a
[9:51] woman to put on a garment pertains to a
[9:53] man. It's exactly right. One said,
[9:56] "Well, they don't make any other
[9:57] clothes. They still make sewing machines
[9:59] and have goods." There's no excuse. It's
[10:02] just what's in the heart. That's what
[10:03] shows out. It it identifies itself. And
[10:07] now we find in this city it become
[10:10] morally decayed. The preachers is afraid
[10:12] to see anything about it. And uh but
[10:14] they had a little old fell coming up
[10:16] over the hill was coming to tell him,
[10:18] "Thus sayaeth the Lord. Clean this thing
[10:21] up or you're going to go into
[10:23] captivity." And lived to see the days of
[10:26] his prophecy fulfilled. He prophesied
[10:28] the days of Jeroboam II, which was just
[10:30] a outcast. Anyhow, he he favored the
[10:34] other nations. And and listen Amos
[10:36] prophesied and told him, he said, "The
[10:38] very God that you claim to serve, he'll
[10:40] destroy you." Amen. And he did. And if
[10:44] his voice would be here tonight in the
[10:46] in Birmingham, it would claim the same
[10:48] thing to the churches.
[10:50] A very God that you claim to serve will
[10:53] destroy you someday. I'm not speaking to
[10:56] this audience here. These tapes go
[10:57] around the world. Now remember that is
[11:00] true. Then he found out when he come
[11:03] into the city that all this stuff I
[11:05] wonder how he must have felt to look and
[11:08] see that decay of the people of God to
[11:10] whom he was sent. Uh I wonder if we
[11:14] would receive him now if he'd come in.
[11:16] Would we would we cooperate with him?
[11:18] Would we give him our our best? Would we
[11:21] give him our attention? Would we repent
[11:23] if he told us that we should go back to
[11:25] the word of the Lord and do the way the
[11:27] Lord said? I wonder what our sisters
[11:29] would do about their bobbed hair. Would
[11:30] they let their hair grow out again? If
[11:32] Amos come on, he'd preach it. Now, I'm
[11:34] telling you that because that's the word
[11:35] of the Lord. I I wonder if our if our
[11:38] boards have put out deacons as married
[11:40] three or four times and and so forth
[11:42] like that and trying to be deacons. I
[11:44] wonder if all these things I wonder what
[11:46] he would do to man that would let his
[11:48] wife wear shorts and get out in the
[11:50] street out there and mow the yard out in
[11:51] the yard when man is passing by. I
[11:53] wonder what he'd say to a man like that.
[11:56] Amen. He certainly blessed it with all
[11:58] that was in him. For he had thus sayaeth
[12:01] the Lord, and he couldn't do nothing
[12:02] else but that. He found them in that day
[12:05] with a bad case um of a
[12:09] disease, spiritual uneasy. And that's
[12:11] just exactly what we got today. Now, how
[12:15] did he know what was going to happen?
[12:18] How would Amos know? First, he was a
[12:20] prophet. And the next thing he knowed by
[12:23] the disease what the diagnosis was and
[12:26] he know what the results was. If a
[12:28] doctor looks up on a malignancy and sees
[12:31] that that malignance done a hold, he
[12:33] knows there's nothing but death left.
[12:35] That's all. Unless God does something
[12:37] about it. Well, when you look at a city
[12:39] and you look at a people, you look at a
[12:41] church and look at a people that's so
[12:44] far away from God. There isn't nothing
[12:46] but to diagnose. But sin, the wages of
[12:49] sin is death. that's dying.
[12:52] The diagnosis proves what it is. You
[12:54] see, when people get away from God and
[12:56] won't listen to the word. Have no more
[12:58] desire for the word. Then there's one
[13:00] diagnosis to it. The soul that sinnth,
[13:02] that soul shall die. Unbelief shall
[13:05] separate you from God. That's exactly
[13:08] right. That he knew what the disease
[13:10] what the results was when he seen the
[13:12] disease of of sin in the city.
[13:16] Now this ammones we told it is a a a
[13:21] cause you to be to a place where you
[13:23] cannot identify
[13:28] yourself. Now it's an unusual thing. It
[13:32] don't happen too often but the causes is
[13:34] from
[13:36] shock. It's somebody that don't even
[13:38] know who they are. They find it from
[13:40] war. Sometime soldiers get it. Sometimes
[13:43] people get it. Another thing causes it
[13:45] is weary. Weary will cause it. Weary has
[13:48] no virtue to it at all. Now it's skip
[13:52] weary except faith. Someone said, "Well,
[13:55] now I have to go to be shot in the
[13:56] morning. Wouldn't you wor weary?" I
[13:57] said, "No, don't think so." Why? I said,
[14:00] "We couldn't do nothing but make me
[14:01] worse." Well, what good is going to do
[14:03] to have faith? I said, "It might deliver
[14:04] me." That's right. See, so weary has no
[14:07] virtue to it at all, but faith has all
[14:09] virtue. Believe. Now weary sometime
[14:13] cause it. And another thing that causes
[14:14] it among the people is getting between
[14:17] two opinions. That'll cause amnesia and
[14:21] it uh gets you to a place where you you
[14:23] actually what you've done. You've lost
[14:25] your reasons. You've lost your mind. You
[14:28] can't make you don't know who you are.
[14:30] You can't identify yourself. You can
[14:31] walk around, eat, everything, but you
[14:33] still you can't identify yourself.
[14:36] You've got your scholarly education. You
[14:38] can same education you had, but you
[14:39] don't know where it come from. You don't
[14:41] know who you are, where you belong.
[14:44] That's amnesia. So, we're told we are
[14:48] identified uh with our families in this
[14:52] human life by marriage and with our
[14:55] wives. We marry and our families
[14:57] identified by the union of our our our
[15:00] marriage. And then um what to think what
[15:05] if this horrible thing would happen to
[15:07] you and you wouldn't be able to remember
[15:10] who you married, who's your wife, which
[15:14] is your children, who is your father and
[15:16] mother, who's your neighbor. That would
[15:19] be a a horrible thing. Then we
[15:23] identified again can identify ourselves
[15:26] in the human race by having intelligence
[15:28] and and being different from the animal
[15:30] life. The animal cannot think. He just
[15:33] goes with sounds. He has no soul. And
[15:36] but we're animal life. What makes us
[15:38] different? We're a mammal. But what that
[15:41] mammal is warm-blooded animal. And we
[15:43] are in the feature of animal. But what
[15:46] makes us different? We are identified by
[15:48] having a soul, a conscience that tells
[15:51] us what's right and wrong. Now there is
[15:54] a place when you get this amnesia you
[15:56] might get like Nebuchadnezzar was who
[15:58] exalted himself one time and God let him
[16:02] think he was an animal and he lived out
[16:05] in the wilderness and and eat grass like
[16:08] an ox and and his u his hairs grow down
[16:12] his body like eagle feathers and he
[16:14] become the heart of a beast in him. See
[16:18] that was
[16:20] ammonia because he had forgotten that he
[16:23] was a king. He had forgotten that he was
[16:25] a human being and he thought he was an
[16:29] animal. So he acted like an animal.
[16:32] Amen. Because he forgot he was a human
[16:35] being. That's so easy today. And we
[16:39] forget sometimes what the Christian
[16:41] church is.
[16:44] We act like the world. Amen. That shows
[16:47] that we got spiritual amnesia because
[16:50] you don't act like the Christian. You
[16:53] act like the world. You receive the
[16:55] heart of the world. And it causes this.
[16:59] Here we um we find that Israel had uh
[17:03] exposed uh got exposed to the world and
[17:06] it fell into this rut. And this prophet
[17:09] was sent to dig him out of it if he
[17:12] could and to tell
[17:13] them God by his grace chose Israel from
[17:18] all the rest of the families on the
[17:20] earth. Grace had did that. He had given
[17:23] them the choice lands. He gave them
[17:26] houses that they never had to build. God
[17:29] did that. Chose them. He gave them farms
[17:33] that they never bought. He He gave them
[17:37] He gave them food that they never
[17:39] planted. He gave them wells that they
[17:42] never dug. He gave them victories that
[17:44] they never won. He gave them grace that
[17:47] they never merited. God did that by his
[17:52] grace for this people. Amen. Israel, his
[17:56] chosen, his
[17:57] beloved. And he said in the Bible, he
[18:00] found her in the field as a little girl
[18:02] sitting in her own blood. And he washed
[18:04] her and cleaned her up. And what he
[18:05] done? But after God showed all these
[18:08] mercies to her, and she got rich, she
[18:12] got amnesia and she forgot all about
[18:16] where these things come from. Amen. I
[18:19] think that's a picture of USA 1964.
[18:25] It's suffering with the same disease.
[18:28] We're great powerful churches. We're
[18:30] great powerful people. We're millions in
[18:33] number. And we'll forget where these
[18:36] things come from.
[18:39] They had a bad case of it after God had
[18:42] been good to him and brought him up from
[18:43] all the heathen lands and made him a
[18:46] separated people, separated them to
[18:48] himself. He said he took a vine out of
[18:51] another country and planted over in
[18:52] another country and how he fixed it
[18:55] around to make it grow fruit and be
[18:58] fruitful. But the vine forgot where its
[19:02] blessings come from. So has God's people
[19:06] in these last days has forgotten what
[19:09] the testimony of being a Christian
[19:12] means.
[19:14] Amen. It's again this amnesia has become
[19:18] upon the people. They can't identify
[19:21] themselves. They um they forgot all
[19:23] about it. They had forgot his holiness.
[19:27] They had forgot his law. The women were
[19:29] living like the rest of the women. God's
[19:32] church and his people has always been a
[19:34] separated people, a a calledout people,
[19:37] a peculiar people, a holy nation, a
[19:40] royal priesthood, offering spiritual
[19:42] sacrifices to God, the fruits of their
[19:44] lips, giving praise to his name. Amen.
[19:46] God called his church and separated from
[19:49] the world for that very purpose. And he
[19:53] given a law and he it must be holy. He
[19:56] said, "I am holy and you must be holy."
[19:59] and without holiness no man shall see
[20:02] the Lord.
[20:03] God said that himself and he called this
[20:06] people to be this type of people. But
[20:09] they had forgotten about it. They had
[20:11] forgotten his laws and they' forgotten
[20:14] their morals. The women out in the
[20:16] street, Israelite women out there, each
[20:19] one expecting to to be conceived by the
[20:22] Holy Spirit to bring forth the Messiah
[20:25] and then acting like that. Their
[20:27] character was terrible. I want to stop
[20:30] here a minute to say it's the same thing
[20:32] among our peoples today that call
[20:34] themselves Christians. Their character,
[20:37] if you would only realize
[20:39] one time in the south, I read a story
[20:41] from down here where when they used to
[20:43] have slaves. They'd take those people
[20:45] and sell them on the market just like
[20:47] you would a used car. And then there was
[20:49] a buyer, a broker would come by and pick
[20:51] up these slaves and trade them and just
[20:53] like you would a car or something. And
[20:56] those slaves was away from their home
[20:58] country. They were from Africa. The
[21:00] boores uh kidnapped them, brought them
[21:02] over here to the islands and then
[21:04] smuggled them into the United States and
[21:06] sold them for slaves out in Jamaica and
[21:09] around. Now we find that those people
[21:12] were sad. They had been kidnapped from
[21:14] their own home. They've been taken out
[21:16] by an enemy and they were sad. They'd
[21:19] never see their husband no more, their
[21:21] wife no more, their father, mother,
[21:22] their children. They were absolutely
[21:25] they had to whip them with whips to make
[21:27] them work for they were sad people. And
[21:30] one day a broker came by a certain
[21:32] plantation. He saw a bunch of slaves out
[21:34] there working and he he went in and
[21:36] asked the owner said, "How many slaves
[21:37] you got?" Said about a hundred. Said,
[21:39] "You got any that you'd swap or sell?"
[21:41] He said, "Yep." Said, "Let me look them
[21:43] over." And he went out in the field and
[21:44] watched them and he seen him have to
[21:46] whip them around. And after he saw one
[21:48] young man they didn't have to whip his
[21:50] chest out, his chin up, didn't have to
[21:53] whip him. So the broker said, "I'd like
[21:56] to buy that slave." And he said, "But
[21:58] he's not for
[21:59] sale." He said, "Well, what's the
[22:02] difference of that slave?" He said, "Is
[22:04] that slave the boss over the rest of
[22:05] them?" He said, "No, he's just a slave."
[22:09] He said, "Well, maybe you feed him
[22:10] different." He said, "No, he eats in a
[22:12] galley with the rest of the slaves." He
[22:15] said, "Well, what makes him so different
[22:16] from the rest of the slaves?" He said,
[22:18] 'Well, this I wondered too for a long
[22:20] time. But one day I learned that over in
[22:24] the homeland where he come from, his
[22:27] father is a king of the whole tribe. And
[22:30] though he be alien and away from home,
[22:33] yet he knows he's the son of a king. And
[22:36] he he conducts himself like the son of a
[22:39] king. I thought but that if a negro
[22:42] coming from Africa and noted his father
[22:45] was a tribesman and a king over a tribe,
[22:48] what ought it to do to a Christian
[22:50] that's born again, a man or woman that
[22:53] our father is a king of heaven and
[22:55] glory? We should conduct ourselves as
[22:57] Christian man and women. We should act
[23:00] like it, dress like it, talk like it,
[23:02] live like it. Though we be an alien, yet
[23:04] we are children of the king. Amen.
[23:08] our character, our demoration. In a days
[23:11] that we're living in now, Israel had
[23:13] dropped into that same rut and was all
[23:17] so immobile. They'd forgot the laws of
[23:20] God. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[23:22] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife
[23:24] and so forth. They'd forgotten those
[23:26] laws. They they they didn't want it
[23:28] anymore. And they uh they wanted to to
[23:31] be like the rest of the world, just like
[23:33] the church has got today. One time
[23:36] Israel when he started going to have a
[23:37] king over it. Samuel told him the
[23:40] prophet which was sent to them. He said
[23:42] now have I ever told you anything in the
[23:45] name of the Lord but what come to pass?
[23:46] They said no you haven't. Did I ever beg
[23:49] you for my food and money your money to
[23:51] for me to live on? No you haven't done
[23:53] that. You never told us nothing Samuel
[23:55] but what come to pass? And you've never
[23:57] asked us for our money for your living.
[24:00] But yet we want the king anyhow.
[24:03] God said to Samuel, "Let them have him."
[24:06] They didn't turn you down. They turned
[24:08] me down.
[24:10] Israel had gotten that same shape. Now,
[24:13] they didn't want God's prophets no more.
[24:15] They didn't need him. And if one would
[24:17] come and bring them the word and try to
[24:19] bring them back to the word, they would
[24:21] reject it. Amen. They always do it in
[24:24] that manner of corruption. When the
[24:27] world and the church joins itself
[24:29] together, then they don't want nothing
[24:31] spiritual. They don't want thus, sayeth
[24:33] the Lord.
[24:35] They want what they want. They want the
[24:38] world and to say they're a Christian and
[24:40] live in the world and live with the
[24:41] world and live like the world and still
[24:44] maintain their confession of being a
[24:46] Christian. You know, the thing of it is
[24:48] it's spiritual amnesia. That's exactly
[24:50] what it is. They don't know who they
[24:52] are. They've forgotten that what they're
[24:54] supposed to
[24:55] do. If one would come today like that,
[24:58] it would be rejected just the same. They
[25:00] had a bad case of it and so have they
[25:03] today. They cannot identify themselves
[25:05] with the supernatural things anymore
[25:08] because they didn't want it. The word,
[25:10] the gospel, they didn't want it. Sin
[25:14] disease had afflicted them and they love
[25:18] that. Sin is pleasant to the unconverted
[25:21] heart. It looks good to the unconverted
[25:24] mind, but it's a way of death. There's
[25:28] nothing left but death. The wages of sin
[25:30] is death and you must reap them wages.
[25:34] You've sowed to the winds and now
[25:36] reaping the
[25:37] whirlwind. The spiritual signs and the
[25:40] preaching of an ordained messenger from
[25:42] God never stirred them anymore. The
[25:45] women could laugh right their face and
[25:46] say, "I don't have to go hear such a
[25:48] stuff as that." If that hasn't repeated
[25:50] again,
[25:53] what is it? Spiritual amnesia. Exactly
[25:56] what it is. They have forgotten that God
[26:00] in his word is the same and he cannot
[26:02] change it. Amen.
[26:04] Prophet rose on the scene in them days
[26:06] and give a spiritual sign, a spiritual
[26:08] voice and give the voice of God behind
[26:10] it and only
