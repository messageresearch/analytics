[25:35] crazy
[25:36] [Music]
[25:38] [Applause]
[25:40] he's in the heart
[25:47] amen you may be seated just a minute I
[25:49] was listening to the sermon be certain
[25:52] of God on the way here and made me think
[25:55] of Jordan preached a sermon a long time
[25:57] ago and I always stuck with me you look
[25:59] at it and it's in the previous song was
[26:01] saying that you know here they are in
[26:03] the storm and Jesus is asleep in the
[26:04] boat and they didn't call on him they
[26:08] waited until they were like absolutely
[26:09] I'd like their width ed but he was
[26:12] always there the whole time the ship
[26:15] wasn't going down Jesus was in the boat
[26:18] right it wasn't going anywhere and so
[26:21] there's two different elements in that
[26:22] one they didn't call him him until his
[26:24] like the very end and then second if
[26:26] they'd had enough faith they wouldn't
[26:28] have even needed to call on him because
[26:30] they would have known he's in the boat
[26:32] he's in the house if the ship is not
[26:34] going down the same thing for us and
[26:37] God's really been dealing with it with
[26:39] me on this is that he's here he's with
[26:41] us he's in our hearts and in our lives
[26:43] and we do go through the valley of the
[26:46] shadow of death but we won't fear we can
[26:49] decide to not fear because we know he's
[26:52] with us and how do we know because he
[26:55] said he would be that's it that he would
[26:57] never leave us or forsake us period and
[27:03] that's it and there's such a rest in
[27:05] that and being certain of God that he is
[27:07] not a man that he should lie he can and
[27:11] he will live up to his word Amen you
[27:15] know I have ambitions I have desires I I
[27:18] say things that I want to achieve and I
[27:21] don't achieve them but God doesn't do
[27:23] that
[27:24] if God said it he meant it and he will
[27:27] make it so the author the finisher of
[27:30] our faith amen praise the Lord let's go
[27:34] ahead and stand and we'll sing brother
[27:36] one you can come why don't you turn into
[27:44] you open the eyes of the blind there's

[35:00] services affair I never told you before
[35:02] I came up here I just sent up a quarter
[35:05] or two up there that I want to use for
[35:08] the service tonight
[35:18] hebrews chapter 1 let's just read from
[35:20] verse 1 God who at sundry times and in
[35:24] divers Milan speak in time past unto the
[35:29] father's by the prophets had in these
[35:33] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[35:37] he hath appointed here's of all things
[35:40] by whom also he made the word is pray to
[35:45] get a father in the name of the Lord
[35:47] Jesus Christ bless this portion of the
[35:51] word that we have just read part of calm
[35:53] now loading and break it to us tonight
[35:56] in Jesus name we pray amen
[36:00] Allah bless you may have you see
[36:11] praise the Lord
[36:16] as
[36:24] as many of you received from the text
[36:26] brother
[36:27] scat had to do cataract surgery today so
[36:32] we believe that he's recovering and we
[36:36] pray for a speedy recovery
[36:39] price of all Sunday that in title
[36:46] speaking on all that the father had
[36:50] given me but you know it is one of those
[36:54] things were you get affected by you know
[36:59] sometimes things people said or things
[37:02] you see and it just it just drive you
[37:06] you know drive your action drive things
[37:11] that you would say because of so then I
[37:15] started speaking on intellectual faith
[37:19] never even went into what I wanted to
[37:21] talk about all that the father has given
[37:24] and it just it just almost like I
[37:27] couldn't get get away from my mind or it
[37:31] just couldn't get away from me because I
[37:33] was maybe because of the trip that I
[37:35] made Saturday and with some other things
[37:38] that we have to talk with the brothers
[37:41] there in Wahpeton area may be bad that
[37:46] was what kind of all affected me a
[37:48] little bit and I admit yeah I can see
[37:53] that that brought me into death
[37:55] but looking at intellectual faith and as
[38:00] we we spoke a little bit Sunday and
[38:04] divine faith wishes divine revelation
[38:07] how I choose to to continue in this way
[38:11] so I would just take a little thought
[38:13] here tonight and let's just get it
[38:16] together believe in that logo for his
[38:20] blessing upon it
[38:21] praise the Lord so we will start with
[38:25] with this coat and we just use it for
[38:29] the service tonight as we started
[38:31] together
[38:35] christ is revealed in his own word now
[38:44] in order to study the scripture Paul
[38:50] told Timothy study it rightly dividing
[38:55] the word of God which is true amen
[39:00] Paul say rightly dividing the word of
[39:03] truth and I like the way brother Branham
[39:06] says you're rightly dividing the word of
[39:08] God which is truth he says them or there
[39:19] is three months in the scripture in
[39:22] using God's word there is three things
[39:26] that we must not do
[39:29] now the reason wider accountable fair a
[39:35] bit led to go into this just like I said
[39:38] seeing that we were speaking a little
[39:40] bit about intellectual faith I realized
[39:43] that now looking closely at this
[39:48] sometimes can be the reason why and it's
[39:51] mostly the reason why we find people
[39:54] going into intellectual faith good
[39:57] people you know the law of God but there
[40:00] is just this thing of the human nature
[40:03] sometimes we get answers amen
[40:07] we get answers and and we are serving a
[40:10] God and living God but yet he's he's a
[40:14] God that that is a spirit he is not in a
[40:18] couple body like our body that we can we
[40:21] can touch we can handle we can see
[40:24] visible with our eyes we are using the
[40:27] eyes of faith to see the God that we
[40:29] serve amen
[40:30] believing the promises in his word but
[40:33] yet we are in a falling body praise the
[40:38] Lord and this falling body has its
[40:42] fallen nature and one of the fallen
[40:46] nature of man is there
[40:48] we men are fed from that continuity with
[40:52] God he has a nature that he's anxious to
[40:58] get back to the place that he was before
[41:01] praise the Lord and that is the reason
[41:04] why when when we come across a promise
[41:07] in God's Word and and and that promise
[41:10] becomes real to us we want it now
[41:14] praise the Lord amen and and a man gives
[41:18] his heart to the Lord and and and and he
[41:20] and he realized all that God is doing
[41:23] for him and God gave the promise of
[41:25] giving of receiving the Holy Ghost and
[41:28] and and and and a new word to come in
[41:30] the rapture and the changing of our body
[41:33] you know our our immediate faith in God
[41:36] you know put us to the place where we
[41:39] get anxious we want to see this thing
[41:41] amen even our Lord Jesus we talks about
[41:44] him we talk about heaven we get anxious
[41:47] and we want to see it anxiousness it's a
[41:50] sense of the fall praise the Lord it's
[41:52] also that sense two shows that we we
[41:55] fell from somewhere and there is a
[41:58] desire in us to get back to where we
[42:01] fell from praise alone so sometimes with
[42:07] with the same suffer of anxiousness we
[42:11] return to find ourselves in this in
[42:17] these places where we will be looking at
[42:19] tonight as we as we started to get them
[42:21] they are three mass in the scripture in
[42:24] using God's Word there is three things
[42:27] that we must not do now let's study
[42:30] those for the next ten minutes well he
[42:34] might be 10 minutes mine would be more
[42:36] than 10 minutes tonight praise the Lord
[42:39] amen it might be 3 months or 10 months
[42:44] or the next 10 weeks three things that
[42:50] we must not do and all out in the land
[42:55] wherever you are across the nation be
[42:57] sure to put for this down in your
[43:00] mine if you haven't got a pencil you
[43:03] must not do these things we tell you all
[43:07] the time how how you must do now I'm
[43:11] going to tell you what you must now do
[43:13] now remember now brother branham say in
[43:16] using God's Word
[43:18] whether you are preaching it whether you
[43:21] are applying it to yourself you must not
[43:25] do these three things because sometimes
[43:29] we think is only the preachers that must
[43:32] not do this and and where where my drive
[43:39] is tonight is is to take it away from
[43:42] the preachers and apply it to our
[43:44] service of the time we do these things
[43:47] applying God promises to ourselves
[43:55] now you must net misinterpret the word
[44:01] that's the first thing because God's
[44:04] Word is of no private interpretation
[44:09] prays alone it is written in the word
[44:13] that we must now add we must now take
[44:16] away praise the Lord and now you can see
[44:21] a little bit word I talked about their
[44:24] sense of anxiousness as we go along you
[44:29] will see what what we are talking about
[44:31] well I believe it means this you know
[44:36] sometimes to suit ourselves sometimes
[44:39] you know to make ourself fit into the
[44:42] word it means just what it says praise
[44:47] the Lord
[44:48] God's word means just what it says it is
[44:55] no interpreter and you must never
[45:00] misplace the word he must not
[45:04] misinterpret we must not misplace the
[45:07] word and you must not dislocate the word
[45:11] those are the three months
[45:14] and we want to look at we want to look
[45:16] at them closely as in applying into
[45:19] ourselves
[45:20] now that one of the reason why year is
[45:22] that we we have to know they're in one
[45:25] dispensation God was above his people
[45:30] amen
[45:31] he was dream in the prophets and sending
[45:35] that the children of Israel prophets in
[45:40] and raising kings and judges and then
[45:44] another time God revealed himself in his
[45:47] son when God came in the form of a body
[45:51] and this time God is dealing with his
[45:56] people are we together so it's important
[46:01] for us to be able to look at this
[46:03] closely and as we apply it to ourselves
[46:08] because as I said in the word God word
[46:12] will not go out and return back back
[46:15] when God made a promise is surely going
[46:19] to come to pass praise the Lord
[46:23] it's surely going to come to pass so we
[46:28] just have to learn to be patient we have
[46:31] to learn to wait for God to fulfill his
[46:34] own word like the prophets said the
[46:36] vision will speak for itself
[46:38] even though Atari it would definitely
[46:41] come to pass
[46:44] are we together so we must not do these
[46:49] things we must not misinterpret the word
[46:53] we must not misplace the word we must
[46:55] net dislocate the word and if we we
[46:59] would do either of these it rolls the
[47:03] whole Bible in a confusion no it rules
[47:07] the person in the confusion it was the
[47:13] person that was there in a confusion
[47:15] they create a chaos praise the Lord
[47:23] amen the world will always mean what it
[47:26] is
[47:28] praise the Lord now if you bring it to
[47:32] the life of the individual
[47:34] and-and-and-and you will always be a son
[47:37] of God you will always be a daughter of
[47:40] God but if you are caught in this thing
[47:42] is going to put your life into a
[47:44] confusion because you're going to say
[47:47] well why is this happening to me
[47:50] why am i this way there is nothing wrong
[47:55] with the word it just what is happening
[47:58] is that the way you are processing the
[48:00] world are we together so it rolls the
[48:11] whole Bible in in a confusion to the
[48:14] person and in the chaos notice to miss
[48:21] interpret Jesus is this is an example
[48:24] now to misinterpret Jesus in the form of
[48:28] God in the man you will make him you
[48:36] make him one God out of three to
[48:42] misinterpret Jesus Christ being the word
[48:45] you will make him one God out of three
[48:48] all you will make him the second person
[48:51] in a Godhead noun so you you just see
[48:54] all the doctrines that have come out of
[48:57] the Godhead in the beginning when God
[49:02] said let us make man in our own image
[49:04] and people said well he was talking to
[49:06] the Trinity and the brother Trinity out
[49:09] of the other end and people have broader
[49:11] the teaching of Purusha out of the earth
[49:13] and all of the Aries is all because
[49:16] there is a misinterpretation somewhere
[49:23] are we together amen
[49:27] so to misinterpret that Jesus in the
[49:31] form of God in a man you make him a
[49:34] one-goal out of three order to
[49:37] misinterpret the word you make him one
[49:40] go
[49:40] three or you will make him the second
[49:42] person in a Godhead and to do that you
[49:45] will mess the whole scripture because if
[49:49] you get the Godhead wrong it will be
[49:52] difficult for you to relate to God
[49:56] because Jesus said in that day you will
[49:59] know that I am in the father the father
[50:02] in me I in you and you in me praise the
[50:10] Lord
[50:13] amen so you see the people that goes
[50:16] with the wrong interpretation of the
[50:18] word they're not just only getting the
[50:21] interpretation of the word wrong but is
[50:24] also affecting their relationship I mean
[50:30] if they gather the interpretation of the
[50:33] word that you have to pass through a
[50:35] scene or you have to pass through you
[50:38] know you have to act somebody to talk to
[50:40] the father on on your behalf if that is
[50:43] the way that the honest and the word is
[50:46] going to affect the our own relationship
[50:48] because they cannot go ball it to the
[50:50] truenicks they will always want to talk
[50:55] through somebody to God they will never
[51:00] want to they will never believe that God
[51:02] can be able to speak to them they will
[51:06] always want to hear from God through
[51:08] somebody praise Lord
[51:22] so that is the reason why we must not
[51:26] misinterpret the word I word on that a
[51:31] little bit here
[51:33] amen like brother Branham says here to
[51:42] misinterpret that word we either make a
[51:44] trinity out of it or the second person
[51:47] in the Godhead and to do that you're
[51:49] going to mess the whole structure up one
[51:55] time the zodiac was God's Bible praise
[52:02] the Lord and for the person you know to
[52:07] just to just prop because of what the
[52:10] way they see the heavens and and just
[52:13] guess you know if they will misinterpret
[52:17] the times in the season praise the Lord
[52:23] like those three wise men they saw the
[52:26] the constellation of the Stein's
[52:28] they brought them all the way down to
[52:30] Jerusalem to come and look for the birth
[52:33] of our Lord if you have not steady
[52:39] wisely you know any Naevia would not you
[52:44] if you just saw the starting and I guess
[52:46] there were many other you know
[52:49] stargazers that was looking in the
[52:51] heavens and they had their
[52:53] interpretation about it praise the Lord
[53:05] so we must not misinterpret the word
[53:08] let's dwell on this a little bit you
[53:14] didn't never get no word now only in
[53:19] understanding also in your relationship
[53:24] we've gone remember brother Branham says
[53:29] until he had the true revelation of the
[53:32] Godhead he always thought that Jesus
[53:35] loved him and the father was angry at
[53:37] him praise the Lord and people will come
[53:45] up with all of those kind of tricky
[53:50] teaching because in the India mind the
[53:53] thing that God is a man so it's better
[53:57] for you to talk to the Sun because the
[53:59] Sun knows how to apply to the father we
[54:04] are having that human mind that that
[54:06] kind of mind about God just follow me
[54:11] here a little bit this would get
[54:14] interesting
[54:20] you will get nowhere so you must not
[54:23] miss interpret and if you say there of
[54:27] certain thing you put an interpretation
[54:30] to it how many times we do that things
[54:34] happen in our life and we put an
[54:37] interpretation to way and sometimes when
[54:40] you do that you get stuck with it you
[54:44] get stuck with it because your mind has
[54:48] come to believe you your mind your mind
[54:51] is is your church member I mean your
[54:56] mind comes to believe you so you get
[54:58] stopped to dad until you tell your mind
[55:03] said no I was lying to you it's not
[55:07] really the truth how we together and if
[55:14] you say that a certain thing you put an
[55:16] interpretation on it and you apply it to
[55:19] another time where bantams taught us
[55:23] there he says you know always looking to
[55:26] what God would do now what God has done
[55:29] and not being able to identify what he's
[55:32] doing now are we together and you apply
[55:41] it to another time or is being applied
[55:44] to another time you also make an aim
[55:47] correct interpretation praise the Lord
[55:52] so we take that that makes interpreting
[55:57] the word and let's look at this all the
[56:01] code we'll come back to that
[56:02] let's look I show us the father I just
[56:05] put this one in and just to be able to
[56:09] help us get a better picture of what
[56:12] we're looking at tonight
[56:13] she was the father bourbon MCS here he
[56:16] says there's only one God and a
[56:23] different agree with the organization of
[56:26] Pentacles that's called the oneness
[56:32] like your finger is one now when we
[56:39] think about only one God we think about
[56:43] the number one we think about just like
[56:48] my fingers standing up yet put only one
[56:51] finger up I'm covering the rest praise
[56:56] the Lord
[56:57] now you have to think about it this way
[57:00] this God we are talking about one time
[57:03] fill all specs there was no time amen
[57:12] one time he feel every word this great
[57:17] internal spirit praise the Lord
[57:21] now so you see how how the hymn of mind
[57:24] all the teachings of man will want to
[57:27] narrow God down and just make him just a
[57:33] single one a small one two let's go
[57:41] ahead a little bit
[57:42] he said that's wrong absolutely it's
[57:46] wrong Jesus couldn't have been his own
[57:50] father because sometimes when you talk
[57:56] about the Godhead and we try to prove
[57:59] that there is not three gods there is
[58:03] nothing about the Trinity the word
[58:05] Trinity is not in the Bible we wait to
[58:07] throw that out there
[58:10] God is one what our mind goes to is that
[58:16] we are just looking at the number one
[58:19] and then for us to be able to prove our
[58:26] doctrine which says Jesus say I and the
[58:28] father are one
[58:33] are we together amen
[58:38] we get a Bible verse we can throw it out
[58:41] there sometimes out of these theological
[58:53] understanding in Bible believe they can
[58:56] just be a fit leaf to cover sometimes
[58:59] our ignorance oh yeah that's what I
[59:04] believe we've only believe in one God
[59:06] and we baptized in Jesus name in the
[59:08] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[59:10] name of the one God the berm said Jesus
[59:16] couldn't have been his own father and if
[59:20] God is a man then Jesus was born
[59:24] sexual desire another virgin birth
[59:31] that's said to the whole thing you see
[59:33] if he's one like your finger one then
[59:38] what then he was his own daddy praise
[59:47] the Lord
[59:49] how cool how could he have been that's
[59:53] wrong he had a father Jesus did you just
[59:59] can't see the manifestation of God
[1:00:04] unfolding himself prays alone that is
[1:00:12] the great intent of spirit that is the
[1:00:15] God though that we watch it and it's
[1:00:22] like you know we come to church and says
[1:00:23] well let's let's pray less let's invite
[1:00:25] the Lord he was here before we even got
[1:00:28] here praise the Lord
[1:00:34] oh let's let's pray so the Lord came he
[1:00:36] was here before we even he said even
[1:00:38] before we open our mouth who knows
[1:00:40] exactly what we're going to say
[1:00:48] in all of these line of thought
[1:00:50] sometimes they affect our relationship
[1:00:55] with God because of the way we process
[1:00:59] him in our mind praise the Lord
[1:01:09] and I've been kind of for studying a
[1:01:12] little bit on the attribute of God like
[1:01:14] I said last time talking about it yeah a
[1:01:18] little bit
[1:01:19] sometimes when we talk about the
[1:01:20] attribute of God we like to make God's
[1:01:25] attribute substance even you've been an
[1:01:32] attribute of God his net you ask the
[1:01:37] person is that attribute of God the love
[1:01:42] of God that is projected towards you and
[1:01:47] the grace that is given for you to
[1:01:50] embrace that law amen so it's almost
[1:01:59] like I'd like to say in this child way
[1:02:02] it's almost like the little boy that
[1:02:04] take the board and he true in the air
[1:02:07] and run across the feet to receive it it
[1:02:12] is God on this side is God on the other
[1:02:15] side
[1:02:15] I mean it's God giving the promise he's
[1:02:26] God on the other side believing the
[1:02:28] promise
[1:02:31] it's God making the promises God on the
[1:02:34] other side bringing the promise to pass
[1:02:41] praise the Lord
[1:02:43] paul dierden in item as chapter 17 he
[1:02:48] got out there and he met all of these
[1:02:51] these men these Greeks you know man of
[1:02:55] wisdom and they had this big inscription
[1:02:59] there to the unknown God and he stained
[1:03:04] around those men you know he just he
[1:03:08] could just see the wisdom and they had
[1:03:13] they have been like that it's it's
[1:03:15] almost like brother Branham said and in
[1:03:18] Jesus day they heard about what he was
[1:03:20] doing and he came down
[1:03:22] wanted to see him price alone because in
[1:03:28] their mind of the things that they have
[1:03:30] heard the man that have raised up their
[1:03:32] demand I open the blind eyes the men
[1:03:34] have in their mind saying all of these
[1:03:37] things they have put an image to that
[1:03:40] man
[1:03:40] oho when we get down there the way he
[1:03:43] would be dressed amen and man I would do
[1:03:50] such a thing should be highly esteemed
[1:03:53] so they got right there Jesus I was
[1:03:55] right there and they wanted to see him
[1:04:01] are we together tonight so he he got
[1:04:07] down there and saw the inscription to
[1:04:10] the unknown God and realized that these
[1:04:14] people had a true desire with all the a
[1:04:21] wisdom and all the things they have such
[1:04:23] other belief that there is there is a
[1:04:29] supernatural intelligence somewhere and
[1:04:36] trying to approach him praise the Lord
[1:04:43] believing that he's he's far somewhere
[1:04:45] far away if he can hang the heavens up
[1:04:51] that the Sun can come you know and in
[1:04:55] the moon you know the weather changes
[1:04:57] you know what that's a great
[1:04:59] intelligence and now with all of these
[1:05:03] things that he has placed up there and
[1:05:05] to see all the things that is happening
[1:05:07] it looks like oh man God gave us this
[1:05:11] universe he gave us this word and man
[1:05:14] has become so evil and he have just
[1:05:16] driven God far away from his universe
[1:05:19] that's why we are suffering praise the
[1:05:25] Lord
[1:05:26] can you just think about all the chaos
[1:05:29] we are having if God was not paying
[1:05:31] attention
[1:05:33] we won't have a word to lady I mean who
[1:05:41] have a word to lady that's a brother
[1:05:44] branham saying the church age bow he
[1:05:45] says he says we make God so impersonal
[1:05:48] it looks like he just made us throw us
[1:05:53] down here and sitting on his throne
[1:05:57] looking down like he's watching the
[1:05:59] movie he says no but God is governing in
[1:06:05] the offense of man he's governing in our
[1:06:09] offense he never gave us a promise he
[1:06:14] never created word just left us here and
[1:06:17] gone away he's involved praise the Lord
[1:06:29] now when Adam sharing the pain in in the
[1:06:33] Garden of Eden there was never a you
[1:06:37] know a radio message that went to heaven
[1:06:42] there was not telephone call the only
[1:06:46] man I was there hear he's the one that
[1:06:48] have fallen in there he's he's hiding
[1:06:51] himself and the next thing that the
[1:06:55] scripture tells us God come down in the
[1:06:57] cool of the evening and he asked him
[1:07:00] Adam Adam where are you
[1:07:03] Oh again the the kanima who acts and
[1:07:09] thinking if God knows there why he will
[1:07:12] ask out of were you
[1:07:13] yeah because God knew where Adam was I
[1:07:17] don't never knew where he was praise the
[1:07:25] Lord
[1:07:27] I mean God knew where Adam was because
[1:07:31] it was all part of the plan because
[1:07:33] there was a plan of redemption and God
[1:07:39] knows where we are and he want to help
[1:07:44] us to realize where we are
[1:07:49] praise the Lord I don't never knew where
[1:07:54] he was but God knew where he were where
[1:07:56] Adam was took a fake leap hide himself
[1:08:07] no wonder Jesus come right down there he
[1:08:10] have to curse that fake tree over there
[1:08:14] in in the Book of Luke because the fig
[1:08:19] leaf had just been cursed right from the
[1:08:21] beginning men always run to Aidan then
[1:08:24] to hide himself
[1:08:26] verbanski that's what religion is are we
[1:08:34] together
[1:08:35] so you see library Balaam said he says
[1:08:38] you just can't see the manifestation of
[1:08:42] God unfolding himself a loving father
[1:08:47] you can make him one you can make him
[1:08:49] tool you can reduce him down to your
[1:08:52] understanding God keeps unfolding
[1:08:54] himself praise the Lord
[1:08:59] he keeps unfolding himself he is the
[1:09:04] creator of the universe the universe in
[1:09:06] itself cannot contain God the heavens of
[1:09:10] heavens cannot contain him he's bigger
[1:09:13] than this world he's greater than
[1:09:15] everything oh yeah he can unfold himself
[1:09:24] all for himself and Komondor in your
[1:09:29] heart
[1:09:32] amen and when he comes in your life then
[1:09:35] he starts unfolding himself we want to
[1:09:42] reduce God to doctrine to crease to
[1:09:47] Dogma to what our church believe when
[1:09:50] God is greater than the end
[1:09:56] praise the Lord you know just like I
[1:09:59] said I was there on Sunday about been in
[1:10:02] an airplane you get up there
[1:10:07] the aeroplane gets so high up you go
[1:10:09] beyond the class you can even see
[1:10:11] anything trailer are still driving on
[1:10:17] the street terms of vehicles are moving
[1:10:21] up and down men are working morning
[1:10:24] afternoon shift night shift but you are
[1:10:26] beyond the clouds and you can see
[1:10:28] nothing that is happening yet because of
[1:10:31] how far you have gone into the heavens
[1:10:37] and when you starts to be same you
[1:10:43] coming down and you start losing at it
[1:10:47] you altitude then you start coming to
[1:10:51] consciousness praise the Lord that come
[1:10:57] into consciousness and sometimes you sit
[1:10:59] there when it gets over Minneapolis you
[1:11:01] want to see whether it's eg and a
[1:11:03] blooming turn and you're looking down
[1:11:05] and you you know and you guessing maybe
[1:11:07] that is the Mall of America maybe this
[1:11:09] displays you you're trying to put a
[1:11:12] picture sometimes that's the way it is
[1:11:23] praise the Lord
[1:11:30] you think about God being a loving God
[1:11:32] you tell you about God being a holy God
[1:11:34] and you think about all of God's
[1:11:37] attributes like brother Branham says he
[1:11:43] says he says love was their purest
[1:11:47] fountain of God because God is love if
[1:11:51] the thing that flows out of God he says
[1:11:57] where every time he condescended to the
[1:11:59] earth it takes all these different form
[1:12:06] we have feel your love and you know and
[1:12:09] and he says every time it gets down to
[1:12:11] man it gets more perverted what am I
[1:12:18] saying this tonight is because sometimes
[1:12:22] the way our mind thinks about things our
[1:12:30] minds is it so easy to get stuck on
[1:12:33] things
[1:12:41] and then we put on interpretation to it
[1:12:45] but then you will realize as a son of
[1:12:49] God or the daughter of God that God has
[1:12:52] projected his attribute all and you have
[1:12:55] a seat of God in your heart you can
[1:12:59] understand what is going on and you
[1:13:03] taught really this was it I really
[1:13:05] thought that this was it I thought that
[1:13:07] you know I take for example I have the
[1:13:11] Holy Ghost let me let me share something
[1:13:13] with you trying to bring this thing out
[1:13:15] go to night a brother called me today
[1:13:20] good young brother trying to check on
[1:13:23] him in I haven't talked to him for a
[1:13:25] while and I call him and he returned my
[1:13:27] call and we were talking from one thing
[1:13:30] to another and then he says he said
[1:13:33] brother one I was thinking about
[1:13:34] something else I want to share with you
[1:13:36] how to dream he says an industry MIT was
[1:13:40] it was about the rapture he says it was
[1:13:45] you know it was it was about the rapture
[1:13:46] the Saints you know it's almost like we
[1:13:50] were in that period of the rapture he
[1:13:54] says and then and and and the Lord
[1:13:56] ascended he says and and you know all
[1:14:00] the Saints are the great resurrection he
[1:14:03] says and and there was something there
[1:14:04] happen and that's where I'm confused in
[1:14:06] the drain because in the drain it's like
[1:14:11] I was change of all the rapture in sins
[1:14:17] I was changed and the Saints were
[1:14:21] ascending to heaven but I was not going
[1:14:23] to heaven but I could feel that I was
[1:14:29] changed I can feel the effect of a
[1:14:32] change on me and when he was you know
[1:14:36] narrating or dear to me and then he says
[1:14:41] it was it was almost like in his dream
[1:14:45] our Lord Jesus is well somebody is
[1:14:49] missing it is right there he woke up
[1:14:54] from
[1:14:54] training assisting I started to think
[1:14:56] well but I knew in the dream I was
[1:14:59] changed well while I was on our rapture
[1:15:04] I joined I said where brother you know
[1:15:08] what I'm you know I don't have I can't
[1:15:10] interpret dreams but I will share this
[1:15:14] with you I said the rapture is a process
[1:15:17] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the
[1:15:24] Lord himself shall descend with a shout
[1:15:27] that's the word of the hour when the
[1:15:31] shell comes and you identify the word
[1:15:35] and you identify the message of the day
[1:15:36] you you are caught up into that cycle of
[1:15:40] the rapture you have a rupturing word
[1:15:43] that is dealing with you I said was what
[1:15:46] we don't realize is that that's why the
[1:15:49] scripture says we are changed from glory
[1:15:51] to glory it's a constant process of
[1:15:55] change now just just thinking on what
[1:15:59] you said to me you had a sense when you
[1:16:02] think about the sleeping virgin they had
[1:16:06] claimed life what will produce that
[1:16:08] clean life but it didn't have everything
[1:16:11] they needed to respond to the midnight
[1:16:16] cry
[1:16:21] and we to get in so you said even God is
[1:16:26] dealing with our life he has put us on
[1:16:29] this wheel like he Zeke here and he's
[1:16:35] dealing with our life bringing us
[1:16:39] through all the stages of grace
[1:16:45] sometimes we come true and experience
[1:16:48] and you get so excited oh and you find
[1:16:51] the Lord and it's almost like you are on
[1:16:53] the housetop and everything you know
[1:16:55] what is looking brand-new and we put an
[1:17:00] interpretation to that instead of us
[1:17:06] keep believing the Lord and keep
[1:17:07] trusting the Lord and keep you know and
[1:17:09] enjoying the moment when God is dealing
[1:17:12] with our life let's enjoy the moment so
[1:17:20] when we get down in a time of trial we
[1:17:21] will also appreciate the moment we must
[1:17:28] not misinterpret the word what God is
[1:17:33] doing in our life is also a part of the
[1:17:35] word we are the rapture in people we are
[1:17:40] the people that the promise of this hour
[1:17:41] has come talk before I send you Elijah
[1:17:45] the Prophet we have received that
[1:17:47] promise it's part of the word so we
[1:17:51] cannot separate separate ourselves from
[1:17:53] the world we are part of the word Elijah
[1:17:58] or my Carmel he said to Israel after he
[1:18:02] gathered the stones he said I have done
[1:18:04] all of this I call into the world and
[1:18:07] let this be the very thing that would
[1:18:10] turn your heart back there's two right
[1:18:14] there the witness your witness the fire
[1:18:18] coming down from heaven consuming the
[1:18:21] sacrifice did the people automatically
[1:18:24] change no they then are the magnet turn
[1:18:28] instead of worshiping Jehovah so the
[1:18:30] what Elijah said was wrong no
[1:18:35] Elijah prophesied and was going to take
[1:18:38] a process of time there had to be an
[1:18:41] Elijah that would come in the picture
[1:18:42] they had to be a Jew that would that
[1:18:45] would destroy bar and jessabelle they
[1:18:47] have to be somebody that would throw
[1:18:49] Jesse beer down and it had to go to the
[1:18:51] bottle it was all part of the process it
[1:18:58] was all part of the process but if you
[1:19:00] stay right there and say Elijah said
[1:19:02] your hand would turn back and the people
[1:19:04] had never turned back
[1:19:05] so God fell God and now fulfill his word
[1:19:08] you have just put an interpretation D
[1:19:11] and misinterpreting the word what would
[1:19:15] it do it would confuse you so God is now
[1:19:17] with us God is now with us Elijah I just
[1:19:24] preached a message he said our heart was
[1:19:26] going to be turned back
[1:19:37] don't misinterpret the word don't be
[1:19:42] quite to put an interpretation to what
[1:19:45] God is doing in your life why because
[1:19:48] the story keeps on falling God keeps on
[1:19:53] falling he keeps on falling and the
[1:19:57] story is getting better amen it's
[1:20:02] getting better and as we pass the pages
[1:20:06] we're beginning to understand and we're
[1:20:09] beginning to see things more clearer and
[1:20:12] better than we did yesterday
[1:20:22] the scripture says we'll have ferry
[1:20:23] fryers why when it comes then we quickly
[1:20:30] to think that God don't love us praise
[1:20:37] the Lord
[1:20:38] God answer prayers and yes it's not the
[1:20:42] only answer God answer prayer and yes is
[1:20:49] not the only answer why when God said no
[1:20:53] he said God any answer your prayer it's
[1:20:58] because of we want to make him just like
[1:21:00] our finger we want to have this God that
[1:21:06] we can tell to do things and he do it
[1:21:09] and you did not dare not tell me praise
[1:21:17] the Lord
[1:21:24] that is that that is the reason why a
[1:21:26] divine faith received the word because
[1:21:30] he knows that God is there there is a
[1:21:39] God there is a creator I feel his love
[1:21:46] in my heart I feel him dealing with my
[1:21:47] heart I don't need to understand
[1:21:49] everything when we get our human mind
[1:21:55] into adding and and to see how you know
[1:21:58] yeah it's almost like one plus one equal
[1:22:01] to okay when I do this and and I do this
[1:22:04] the scripture says and repent and be
[1:22:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:08] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:22:11] the Holy Ghost I've repainted I was
[1:22:16] baptized but you know by that bad but by
[1:22:20] the more I know it's a preacher when we
[1:22:21] got down in the water I mean my body was
[1:22:24] shaking I felt on experience but then
[1:22:28] why is all of this happening it have to
[1:22:31] happen it's all part of the word if God
[1:22:38] is cleaning your life why shouldn't he
[1:22:39] show you some of the things that he's
[1:22:41] sticking out praise the Lord
[1:23:02] and we can look at the same image
[1:23:06] placing the word that's how that that
[1:23:08] have to do with timing I mean they have
[1:23:17] to do with timing just like we can
[1:23:23] uphold Moses into an ark
[1:23:28] I'll bring Noah to cross the Red Sea
[1:23:33] you'll all have to do with timing we
[1:23:42] have to know that what God
[1:23:45] he's the one that begins time he on he
[1:23:52] said on time God he understand time he
[1:23:56] understands seasons
[1:24:01] praise the Lord we can we can look right
[1:24:07] into the message and just stay with
[1:24:10] where brother Branham said don't
[1:24:12] misplace the word don't pornos are into
[1:24:14] into Moses edge but bring it to yourself
[1:24:22] bring it to yourself are we giving God
[1:24:26] time for him to be able to teach us
[1:24:34] and we gave in ourself time for us to be
[1:24:37] able to grow in the things that God is
[1:24:40] doing the things that he's revealing to
[1:24:43] us just like I said you know it's that
[1:24:46] the anxiousness is there and sometimes
[1:24:50] like you know sometimes like a preacher
[1:24:52] you feel it you you you get to the place
[1:24:53] word you you have an inspiration and the
[1:25:00] Lord is helping you to to see this thing
[1:25:03] instead of just saying right there
[1:25:06] instead II in a lot of God to unfold the
[1:25:10] thing for his word to you and even let
[1:25:14] the word deal with you we get so anxious
[1:25:16] ain't we get an inspiration we want to
[1:25:18] come and preach it and sometimes we can
[1:25:23] do a very good job of preaching this
[1:25:26] wonderful inspiration that is on our
[1:25:28] heart and yet and still we are never
[1:25:30] even got to the place that God want us
[1:25:33] to get because we're just all rolling
[1:25:36] right in the mind right in the mind
[1:25:48] like we have said before God could have
[1:25:51] created the entire universe one day it
[1:25:57] was not something that was difficult for
[1:25:59] him to do that he have to use six days
[1:26:02] to create he who have come aright there
[1:26:06] let there be letter B letter B letter
[1:26:08] just one letter B K who have created
[1:26:11] everything but God Himself gave himself
[1:26:17] time for his work to come out personally
[1:26:25] for it to be beautiful he gave himself
[1:26:30] time when he did the work on the first
[1:26:34] day he stepped back he stepped back and
[1:26:38] he located and he says it was good
[1:26:46] praise the Lord so we started this a
[1:26:50] little bit and but that's I just want to
[1:26:54] put you into that chain of Todd you
[1:26:59] think about misinterpreting the word if
[1:27:02] you are not called to be a preacher to
[1:27:08] go out and preach then you have no
[1:27:10] reason to preach the word you have no
[1:27:12] reason to be telling people things in
[1:27:14] the scripture when you know that you
[1:27:16] know you're not called to do it but
[1:27:20] what's about understanding the word
[1:27:31] almost like Zacharias in the temple an
[1:27:34] angel came down and told him that you
[1:27:39] are going to have a child he struggled
[1:27:44] believing what they injure said but yet
[1:27:47] it was not going to stop what God was
[1:27:49] going to do he couldn't process it
[1:27:54] through his mind with all the example
[1:27:57] that was in the scripture Abraham were
[1:27:59] fading or there is up what I was but he
[1:28:02] could not process it at that very time
[1:28:06] this was a preacher this was the man I
[1:28:08] was reading about Abraham Isaac when he
[1:28:12] came to his time he was struggling
[1:28:16] without word in his mind
[1:28:19] really let's bet is so old thank
[1:28:24] goodness that's all I thought we have
[1:28:28] passed this have you ever thought about
[1:28:32] that sometimes when you think I thought
[1:28:34] I have passed this in my walk why am i
[1:28:37] stay here
[1:28:41] why am I seeing you why is this
[1:28:44] happening to me I thought I should be
[1:28:48] fire pastor no you stay here on earth
[1:28:50] you are staying in the body of five
[1:28:53] senses
[1:28:58] praise the Lord you know they don't
[1:29:03] don't destroy the beautiful things that
[1:29:05] God is doing when he brings you by
[1:29:08] sometimes and allow you to see that I
[1:29:12] took you from here and I talk to you
[1:29:15] from here then you know and all of these
[1:29:18] things don't don't don't don't stop
[1:29:21] guarding and you know don't don't don't
[1:29:24] don't don't interpret what God is doing
[1:29:26] we're already if I was saved this would
[1:29:29] not happen to me what you saw
[1:29:39] that's one of the must that we must not
[1:29:41] do because God's Word is of no private
[1:29:46] interpretation and what God would do he
[1:29:48] never place it in the hands of enemy
[1:29:58] let's just wash the word keeps unfolding
[1:30:02] let's just allow God to do what he's
[1:30:07] doing
[1:30:08] let's become part of it let's just enjoy
[1:30:11] it
[1:30:13] like Paul says there is no trial in a
[1:30:16] pleasant time in the present time that
[1:30:19] is enjoyable but we have to be there we
[1:30:27] have to be there we have to stand with
[1:30:29] him
[1:30:36] praise the Lord
[1:30:39] that's the three months that we must not
[1:30:42] do praise the Lord
[1:30:47] we must not those dislocate the word we
[1:30:51] must now put it in the future
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] you find people most especially young
[1:31:01] people do there you know I would get out
[1:31:05] you know and then when when I get
[1:31:07] married and I will be serious
[1:31:08] don't worry in the future be serious now
[1:31:13] don't try to the future what if the Lord
[1:31:21] can bring me through this then you know
[1:31:23] I will be on fire get on fire right now
[1:31:25] you might get through a quicker praise
[1:31:30] the Lord
[1:31:30] just get on fire now say Lord just just
[1:31:33] put me on fire let me get through this
[1:31:35] quicker don't wait to get true and
[1:31:37] before you get on fire
[1:31:49] God is now setting his word as I in
[1:31:55] dealing with you by looking at his word
[1:31:59] know when God was about to deal with the
[1:32:03] earth he spoke to the earth so if God is
[1:32:07] dealing with us he's using this word to
[1:32:11] deal with us he's speaking the word into
[1:32:16] our life and into our cetera situation
[1:32:19] so we must not miss interpreted by
[1:32:23] saying oh no it is not for me no it is
[1:32:26] for these people if you believe that God
[1:32:29] is dealing with you you can say every
[1:32:34] promise in the book is mine I mean you
[1:32:40] can say every promise in the book be
[1:32:42] around to me I call into that word that
[1:32:46] was what Mary said praise the Lord
[1:32:51] they ain't gonna talk about she will be
[1:32:55] conceived and she will be overshadowed
[1:32:56] by the Holy Ghost but she was going to
[1:33:03] be despised she was going to be rejected
[1:33:06] she was going to be cast out praise the
[1:33:12] Lord and she was going to witness
[1:33:19] his precious gift being nailed to the
[1:33:22] cross
[1:33:31] let's bow our heads tonight
[1:34:05] not only in situation will we get
[1:34:09] excited over here answers to see good
[1:34:13] things coming or even sometimes when we
[1:34:17] going through trials
[1:34:21] it could be sickness it could be a
[1:34:24] financial problem or it could just be
[1:34:30] God dealing with us to bring us through
[1:34:36] a habit
[1:34:47] sometimes who would like to take a
[1:34:49] religious approach well I feel that the
[1:34:52] Lord is dealing with my heart I'm I'm
[1:34:53] going too fast and parading I'm you know
[1:34:56] I'm just gonna spend some time with the
[1:34:58] Lord and you know believe in thinking
[1:35:03] that we will impress God with this thing
[1:35:05] and God you would get the trial would
[1:35:07] will go very quickly no the trial comes
[1:35:11] to build character in our life
[1:35:20] their prophet of God said God is here
[1:35:22] and reveal in simplicity and like I said
[1:35:27] before if we can see God if we can be
[1:35:34] looking for him and trying to see God in
[1:35:39] the situation that is happening around
[1:35:43] our life we give us faith for us to
[1:35:46] trust him
[1:35:52] like job would say even if you slave me
[1:35:55] I would state trust you
[1:36:01] he could now understand what is
[1:36:03] happening but he knew that God was in
[1:36:06] control he knew that there was a God he
[1:36:10] knew that everything that was happening
[1:36:11] was net with other knowledge of the God
[1:36:15] that he have kept a true integrity
[1:36:17] before in a way if God would just raise
[1:36:25] us up to their faith raise us up to that
[1:36:29] attitude not trying to understand
[1:36:32] everything but just believe that he's in
[1:36:37] control that he's in the house
[1:36:49] because trying to understand and put in
[1:36:53] an interpretation to it it would just be
[1:36:55] an intellectual faith an intellectual
[1:37:02] faith can go so far but will not be able
[1:37:08] to kill us all the way don't
[1:37:14] misinterpret what God is doing
[1:37:23] we're Branham says because the promise
[1:37:25] delay several hundred years after Isaiah
[1:37:29] said the virgin shall conceive so the
[1:37:34] pod also saw spiritual interpretation
[1:37:36] today Israel is the virgin Jerusalem is
[1:37:41] the Virgin Zion is the virgin who bring
[1:37:44] forth and they put all this
[1:37:47] interpretation to it and when God
[1:37:50] brought his word to pass in a humble
[1:37:53] simple way they never saw it because of
[1:37:58] their own interpretation
[1:38:13] falling in love with Jesus for any long
[1:38:23] wave jeez
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:29] falling in love with Jesus that's the
[1:38:37] best thing that I ever done yeah falling
[1:38:46] in love with Jesus
[1:38:53] falling in love wedgie
[1:39:01] falling in love with Jesus that's the
[1:39:08] best thing that I ever heard Brennan
[1:39:16] evey talk to us spoke to us preachers he
[1:39:19] said you can study the word just like
[1:39:22] Paul require us to steady he said but
[1:39:26] there is one thing that we advise you to
[1:39:28] do fall in love

[1:39:40] for something to give his secret to
[1:39:42] Delilah she had a fall in love with him
[1:39:48] and that sometimes that's that's how we
[1:39:52] understand what God is doing in our life
[1:39:57] let's love him
[1:40:05] let's lobby with all of our heart out of
[1:40:11] our mind even if we can't understand it

[1:40:17] God is a good God just fill your mind
[1:40:21] with the thought that he's a loving God
[1:40:24] and think about the things that he have

[1:43:14] let's feed him from our hostel night
[1:43:20] better ban him taught us now deported
[1:43:22] period
[1:43:29] allow God to bring his word to pass for
[1:43:34] the interpretation of the word is when
[1:43:36] God bring it to pass
[1:43:41] your father all you said in your word
[1:43:47] now your spoken word is of no proper
[1:43:50] interpretation father we can get to the
[1:43:55] Bible and we can get and read a cold
[1:43:59] slaughter brother branham in and all of
[1:44:01] that
[1:44:01] Lord but we realize for God using that
[1:44:05] very word to deal with our life and how
[1:44:09] many times of God we have come shot of
[1:44:13] misinterpreting what you are doing in
[1:44:16] our lives and like the Prophet said when
[1:44:23] we do that we throw ourselves into
[1:44:25] confusion we create chaos around our
[1:44:28] life
[1:44:36] and sometimes we make wrong choices and
[1:44:42] sometimes we do things that we should
[1:44:48] not do we hurt ourselves because I said
[1:44:54] son of God I said daughter of God there
[1:44:56] is a seed in us and after the wine will
[1:45:02] realize that we misinterpret that word
[1:45:09] because it's not going to leave it's not
[1:45:14] because of what the Baptist says it does
[1:45:16] not it does not change the Bible the
[1:45:18] Bible remains the Word of God and that
[1:45:20] is the same sometimes when we
[1:45:23] misinterpret things we put our own
[1:45:25] interpretation and and and it does not
[1:45:31] change us from being a son of God or the
[1:45:33] daughter of God it just throws us into a
[1:45:41] moment of confusion

[1:45:49] life I believe you I've been rolling to
[1:45:52] your worldwide business not happening
[1:45:55] brother Branham says just stay in the
