[13:28] prayer
[13:29] you forget and you don't even pay
[13:31] attention to what you prayed for
[13:34] when i got my baby carrying faith
[13:38] the doctor told me that she they heard
[13:41] they saw
[13:42] a let's say a sound to a heart
[13:47] and then he told me that you don't have
[13:49] to worry about it but it's gonna go away
[13:52] and i was kind of like they always you
[13:55] know they may tell you that
[13:56] you won't go away but it may get worse
[13:58] you never know
[14:00] and then i went to god in prayer said

[14:04] the hospital with this sound with my
[14:07] baby having that sound
[14:09] to her heart before i leave the hospital
[14:12] i would like
[14:12] you to close that opening
[14:16] and then have a healthy baby because i
[14:18] know you always give
[14:20] as good gift you never give worse thing
[14:23] and everything like that
[14:25] and then while she was having that issue
[14:28] all the doctors
[14:29] when they come see in the morning they
[14:31] will try everybody will ask you can i
[14:33] listen to your baby's art can i listen

[14:38] day
[14:39] one of the doctors came in the morning
[14:41] she said can i listen to your baby's ath
[14:43] i say okay she listens eastern she
[14:45] listen and then she said

[21:00] it says couple testimonies a song
[21:03] my oh my amen
[21:07] amen just praying this morning that
[21:10] somehow we could just create an
[21:11] atmosphere by getting ourselves out of
[21:15] the way but glorifying his name and
[21:17] certainly our lord jesus amen when he
[21:21] hears
[21:22] his people coming back to give him
[21:24] thanks
[21:26] for what he's done for them oh my god
[21:28] that's pleasing to him
[21:30] so man so sister carol you got a
[21:34] testimony you're gonna sing too
[21:37] i want the congregation to sing
[21:40] all right
[21:55] what's that
[21:59] definitely want to hear everything you
[22:00] have to say this morning
[22:02] yep it's working okay
[22:06] well i told god if he healed me i would
[22:10] testify
[22:12] [Applause]
[22:18] some of you may already know but
[22:23] i was they gave me a test
[22:27] for uh
[22:30] the carrot that to see what the carroted
[22:33] veins were doing because
[22:35] i had a tia and if you don't know that's
[22:39] a very small stroke
[22:41] and so i went to the doctor and they
[22:44] found
[22:46] that the carroted arteries were
[22:49] almost totally blocked
[22:52] and uh with black or whatever
[22:56] you know but uh
[23:01] we asked the church to pray for us here
[23:04] and i want to tell you all thank you for
[23:06] praying because
[23:08] then the next test i had
[23:12] because he told me i needed immediate
[23:16] surgery and i had to go
[23:20] to the surgeon and so we changed doctors
[23:23] we went to
[23:24] this surgeon and he wanted to take
[23:28] his own sonogram so he took that this
[23:32] was after you prayed for me
[23:35] and they found he found
[23:39] there was blood flow and
[23:42] that there was about a fifty percent
[23:46] blockage is all
[23:48] and he said that he he didn't want to
[23:51] operate unless i needed to this is a
[23:53] risky surgery they were
[23:55] cut into your neck and uh
[23:58] cut into your arteries that
[24:02] your carroted arteries the main arteries
[24:06] in your neck and uh
[24:09] scrape them out and that sounds
[24:13] horrible anyway
[24:16] so i did not really want that surgery
[24:20] and so i asked the lord not to have to
[24:23] take that surgery
[24:25] and i appreciate all the the ladies that
[24:29] called me it was
[24:30] very wonderful to hear from you
[24:34] and and it just is such an encouragement
[24:39] to know people
[24:40] love you out there enough to pray for
[24:42] you
[24:44] and the next test i took
[24:49] it was
[24:53] i wes came back for he had to come up
[24:55] here and take care of some things
[24:57] because we could be there half the
[24:59] summer
[25:00] he had some to take care of some things
[25:03] in our home
[25:04] and make sure everything was taken care
[25:07] of while we were gone
[25:09] and so he came back and we he went with
[25:12] me to the
[25:13] appointment and there is
[25:16] one pill that i did not want to take and
[25:18] i wouldn't
[25:19] take it even though the doctors
[25:21] recommended it
[25:23] because of the side effects included
[25:26] diabetes and
[25:28] and possibly
[25:29] [Music]
[25:31] heart failure that's what you're trying
[25:34] to avoid you know
[25:36] possibly liver trouble and kidney
[25:39] trouble
[25:39] and everything you know well i had told
[25:43] them
[25:44] that they asked of course if you've ever
[25:47] had
[25:48] kidney trouble and i told them that
[25:51] one time they told me i had kidney
[25:54] failure
[25:55] and i asked the church here to pray for
[25:58] me
[25:59] and on monday it came up completely
[26:02] normal on the test
[26:05] just after being prayed for on sunday
[26:07] here
[26:08] and i told the doctor that and then
[26:12] when he asked me this one medicine they
[26:16] thought would help
[26:18] you know help to clear it out a little
[26:20] bit up there
[26:22] and he asked me first
[26:25] did you start taking that medicine that
[26:28] you had and i said
[26:30] well i'm sorry i'm kind of independent
[26:33] i i said i didn't feel comfortable to
[26:37] take
[26:38] that medicine so i did not take it i
[26:40] figured i had to be honest
[26:44] and then i think it's a good thing i
[26:46] told him that
[26:48] because he's he said then the next thing
[26:51] he said to us and me
[26:53] was well
[26:56] there was absolutely no evidence of
[26:59] any blockage at all
[27:07] [Music]
[27:08] [Applause]
[27:17] [Music]
[27:18] he's
[27:22] listen you won't be needing me anymore

[41:33] tiny little group in wahpeton
[41:37] north dakota we are very few that
[41:41] sometimes
[41:42] and yet the church we have is so big we
[41:45] rent from our seventh day church
[41:48] which is probably three or four times
[41:50] this size
[41:51] but sometimes they're only four or five
[41:53] people maybe six maybe ten
[41:56] and sometimes i feel like john the
[41:58] baptist a man crying in the wilderness
[42:00] just shouting to nobody but um i bring
[42:03] greetings from them
[42:04] uh brother steven's actually there this
[42:07] morning
[42:08] brother stephen carlon is there he's
[42:10] been supporting us
[42:11] greatly we plan to have memorial
[42:14] day meeting three meetings or four
[42:16] meetings
[42:18] friday the 28th at 7 00 pm
[42:24] saturday at 4 pm and then
[42:27] sunday at 10 in the morning
[42:30] possibly if the lord willing we would
[42:33] like to have like
[42:35] afterwards luncheon for the young
[42:39] people so i would like to
[42:42] extend my special invitation for
[42:44] everyone
[42:47] the young people are welcome the old
[42:50] people are welcome
[42:52] so that yeah
[42:56] so also ask that you pray for the
[42:59] meetings
[43:00] brother uh israel paul is from tucson
[43:04] i think brother blotte knows him very
[43:06] well
[43:07] him and his family are coming up with
[43:08] some members from this church they're
[43:10] about
[43:11] 12 or 15 of them are coming from tucson
[43:14] but the poor has young people also that
[43:16] play
[43:17] music instruments with national
[43:19] accolades
[43:21] so we look forward to inviting everyone
[43:24] to have people come up
[43:25] if you like to attend please let us know
[43:28] either myself or brother steven
[43:31] we do have enough accommodation that you
[43:34] will not have to go
[43:36] into an expense if you want to spend
[43:38] over or stay over
[43:40] more than anything else we just request
[43:42] your prayers that the lord will bless
[43:44] them
[43:44] as we wait for his coming we believe
[43:47] with all our hearts that he's very close
[43:49] to coming
[43:51] just like he said in john chapter 14
[43:53] verse 3
[43:54] i go to prepare place and i will come
[43:56] back
[43:58] and get you also in acts chapter 1 verse
[44:00] 11
[44:01] the same jesus that you see going up
[44:04] will come back again
[44:06] it's not i'm not making it up i told my
[44:08] kids the other day i'm not making this
[44:09] up
[44:10] the lord is coming back again there's a
[44:13] day that is coming that will burn like
[44:14] an
[44:15] oven and all the proud and
[44:18] them that do wickedly shall be as taboo
[44:22] so before that time comes he sent
[44:25] a prophet uh william branham
[44:28] to prepare our hearts not our minds
[44:32] but our hearts may god bless you thank
[44:34] you so much
[44:41] praise the lord amen
[44:44] amen you know our lord jesus
[44:49] make uh seven goals so easy
[44:55] you know because one he paid the price
[44:58] and so you don't have no price to pay
[45:02] you just have to believe in what he have
[45:04] already done
[45:06] praise the lord and then when he said
[45:09] did uh
[45:10] in matthew 16 i'll build my church
[45:14] amen he says i'll build my church and
[45:17] the gifts of hell
[45:19] when that were not prevailed against my
[45:22] church
[45:25] and that church that he was going to
[45:27] build he says
[45:29] wherever two or three
[45:32] you see he makes it so simple
[45:36] wherever two or three
[45:40] he just need two persons
[45:44] and even if it is one he can make the
[45:46] tool
[45:49] and if he can guess two that's all he
[45:52] needs
[45:52] [Music]
[45:54] praise the lord so we want to thank the
[45:58] lord for what is going on there in
[46:00] in north dakota i know
[46:05] i'm indebted to that group but i pray
[46:08] that the law will help me to pay my

[55:44] but then i heard
[55:49] my savior speaking
[55:52] [Music]
[55:55] draw from my world that never
[56:00] shared
[56:13] i lift
[56:15] [Music]
[56:25] this fast
[56:30] [Music]
[56:54] fill it up
[56:58] [Music]
[57:06] there are millions in this world
[57:12] who are craving
[57:17] the pleasure earthly
[57:24] things
[57:26] but none can match
[57:29] the wondrous
[57:35] [Music]
[57:39] in treasures christ
[57:45] so my brother
[57:48] if the things this world gave you
[57:58] that won't pass away
[58:03] oh my blessed
[58:08] will come and save you
[58:13] if you kneel to him
[58:22] [Music]
[58:48] no
[58:50] [Music]
[58:57] oh let's just raise our house to him and
[58:59] sing it
[59:00] yeah feel my problems
[59:04] come on brother george
[59:25] [Music]
[59:30] um
[59:32] [Music]
[59:34] fill it up
[59:48] sometimes my wife don't approve of
[59:49] everything i do
[59:51] this is probably one of them i was going
[59:54] to turn around like this
[59:56] and say from this position you cannot
[59:59] tell who i am
[1:00:01] i could be impersonating a asian man i
[1:00:04] could be
[1:00:04] impersonating a mexican man a hispanic
[1:00:08] man
[1:00:08] a black man i could be impersonating a
[1:00:11] white man
[1:00:12] you have no idea who i am you might be
[1:00:16] able to tell by the accent
[1:00:18] and and even if i can impersonate a
[1:00:20] white man
[1:00:22] i cannot impersonate all white men from
[1:00:24] this position because some white men are
[1:00:25] bigger than i am
[1:00:27] some white men are smaller than i am so
[1:00:29] i cannot impersonate them so
[1:00:31] there's only a short range of people i
[1:00:34] can impersonate from that position
[1:00:36] i turn around this way i can impersonate
[1:00:39] a lot
[1:00:40] some people but less people because you
[1:00:42] can see
[1:00:43] from my eye color that i'm not like that
[1:00:46] person or another person
[1:00:48] i could take this off and i can
[1:00:51] impersonate less people
[1:00:53] but from my actions you still don't know
[1:00:56] the true me
[1:00:58] because my actions i can be
[1:00:59] impersonating christian
[1:01:02] i could be impersonating a worldly
[1:01:04] person you do not know
[1:01:08] and that's a question we need to ask
[1:01:10] ourselves when we're walking through our
[1:01:11] daily lives
[1:01:13] when we're walking through our daily
[1:01:14] lives at work we're at church
[1:01:17] or at the store are we putting on
[1:01:20] something that we are not
[1:01:22] are we walking after the impersonation
[1:01:25] of somebody else
[1:01:27] or are we sincere in what we do
[1:01:31] that's a question that only we can
[1:01:32] answer
[1:01:34] you know brother juan can have
[1:01:36] confidence in me that i'm a christian
[1:01:39] but that he does not truly know that
[1:01:44] he can have confidence that i would say
[1:01:46] the right thing but he don't know that
[1:01:48] he can have faith in that and that's the
[1:01:51] same way between us and the lord
[1:01:53] you know the new birth is a personal
[1:01:56] revelation to you
[1:01:57] individually it's not a revelation to me
[1:02:00] that you have it
[1:02:02] the same way the evidence of the holy
[1:02:04] ghost is accepting the present day word
[1:02:06] for your day
[1:02:08] but i don't know that you've done that
[1:02:10] only you know that you've done that
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:15] so uh let's read from ephesians 4
[1:02:19] you know what this is one of those
[1:02:23] sermons where i'm basically just going
[1:02:26] to go over some fundamentals
[1:02:27] again and probably preaching to the
[1:02:31] choir
[1:02:32] because everybody already knows the
[1:02:33] fundamentals
[1:02:35] but sometimes if we're not careful in
[1:02:38] our position in place
[1:02:40] sometimes we'll lose focus of where we
[1:02:42] are
[1:02:43] and we'll start acting because we got
[1:02:46] confidence
[1:02:48] in what we are instead of what we should
[1:02:50] be at the individual we know from
[1:02:53] from the group level of who we are
[1:02:56] from a group level where the virtuous
[1:02:58] bride of christ without flaw or wrinkle
[1:03:02] we know from a group level that we are
[1:03:05] the called of god
[1:03:06] but from the individual level personally
[1:03:08] what are we
[1:03:10] so i you know i
[1:03:13] i can speak from a position of uh
[1:03:16] someone who's
[1:03:17] who ministers or speaks because you know
[1:03:19] that's what i'm doing right now
[1:03:21] so we'll look at it even from that that
[1:03:23] perspective
[1:03:24] we'll go to ephesians 4
[1:03:28] and yeah y'all probably already know
[1:03:30] where i'm going
[1:03:32] i'm not going to read the whole chapter
[1:03:34] but the portions i'm not reading
[1:03:38] is really more important than the
[1:03:39] portions i am going to read so
[1:03:42] whenever you get home you can go back
[1:03:44] and read over those scriptures
[1:03:46] and concentrate on those and see what
[1:03:48] it's really telling you
[1:03:50] about the position
[1:03:54] now this right here is uh ephesians 4
[1:03:59] maybe i shouldn't give any more details
[1:04:00] until i get on into it
[1:04:02] ephesians 4 uh verse 8 through 14.
[1:04:06] pay attention to the importance of this
[1:04:08] calling
[1:04:10] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:04:13] on high
[1:04:13] this is christ himself he led captive
[1:04:17] captivity captive and he gave gifts unto
[1:04:19] men
[1:04:20] now that he ascended what is it but that
[1:04:24] he also
[1:04:25] descended first into the lower parts of
[1:04:27] the earth
[1:04:28] so he was already ascended then he
[1:04:29] descended to the lower parts of the
[1:04:31] earth
[1:04:36] he that descended is the same also the
[1:04:38] descended above of
[1:04:40] far above all heavens that he might fill
[1:04:43] all things he's fulfilling all things
[1:04:46] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[1:04:50] some evangelists some pastors and
[1:04:52] teachers
[1:04:53] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:04:55] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:04:57] the body of christ
[1:04:59] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:05:01] faith and the knowledge of the son of
[1:05:04] god
[1:05:04] unto a perfect man and to the measure of
[1:05:07] the statue of the fullness of christ
[1:05:09] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:05:12] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:05:14] every wind doctrine
[1:05:15] by the slide of man and a cunning
[1:05:17] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:05:20] deceive
[1:05:22] you may be seated
[1:05:26] see that's that's an important calling
[1:05:30] it's very important
[1:05:34] but that calling is for what is for the
[1:05:37] perfecting of the saints
[1:05:39] and he gave these gifts to you the
[1:05:41] church
[1:05:43] so he gave the gifts to you who's more
[1:05:45] important who he gave the gifts to or
[1:05:46] the gifts themselves
[1:05:48] it's to the church so the gifts are more
[1:05:50] important
[1:05:51] or the or the the people he sent the
[1:05:54] gifts to are more important
[1:05:58] until we all come into the unity of the
[1:06:00] faith is for the perfecting so it's
[1:06:02] to perfect the saints to perfect them to
[1:06:05] bring them
[1:06:06] to fully equip them to bring them to
[1:06:08] maturity
[1:06:10] okay
[1:06:13] we'll just uh read a quote here and it
[1:06:16] says
[1:06:17] what's the most important thing in the
[1:06:19] world it's god's church
[1:06:22] god made the earth he made it for a
[1:06:24] purpose to take the church out of it
[1:06:26] abroad
[1:06:27] that's the most important job in the
[1:06:30] world
[1:06:31] so this is the most important job in the
[1:06:33] world is calling a church
[1:06:35] out of the world abroad you know
[1:06:38] it's it's very important and just
[1:06:41] because this is important that doesn't
[1:06:44] mean
[1:06:45] that you can ignore everything else and
[1:06:47] just concentrate on the importance
[1:06:49] and forget what you're supposed to be as
[1:06:51] an individual
[1:06:53] because we sometimes if we're not
[1:06:56] careful we'll
[1:06:57] concentrate on the importance of our
[1:06:59] task or the importance of the bride
[1:07:01] and who we are and we'll begin to act
[1:07:04] like we're exalted above somebody else
[1:07:06] when we're not
[1:07:07] we are supposed to be humble before the
[1:07:09] lord
[1:07:10] and if we're not careful we'll act out
[1:07:12] of character and if you go back
[1:07:14] and read the whole chapter of ephesians
[1:07:15] 4 it says one of the places in there
[1:07:17] says work worthy of your vocation
[1:07:20] and if we're acting holly and better
[1:07:22] than everybody else then we're not
[1:07:24] working
[1:07:24] working walking worthy of our vocation
[1:07:27] we are exalting ourselves
[1:07:28] beyond measure and this is something
[1:07:30] that we should not do
[1:07:33] now it's important now just because
[1:07:35] you're humble
[1:07:36] that doesn't mean that you are thinking
[1:07:39] less of yourself
[1:07:41] because in the scripture it says moses
[1:07:43] was a
[1:07:44] meekest man upon the face of the whole
[1:07:46] earth
[1:07:47] now meek does not mean he's weak he had
[1:07:50] the most powerful position that there
[1:07:52] ever
[1:07:52] existed up to that point he was
[1:07:56] anything he said in the camp of israel
[1:07:58] went he had the power
[1:08:00] but he also had meekness he was the most
[1:08:02] meek man upon the face of the earth
[1:08:04] now meek that is that doesn't mean he
[1:08:07] had no power he had power but it was in
[1:08:09] control
[1:08:10] it was in control of the holy spirit now
[1:08:13] sometimes
[1:08:14] just because you have power you have the
[1:08:15] position of authority
[1:08:17] but if you take that position of
[1:08:18] authority and you abuse it you take it
[1:08:20] out of context
[1:08:21] and you go and force your will on
[1:08:23] somebody else even though it's not god's
[1:08:25] will
[1:08:26] then you're not meek you are not power
[1:08:28] in control
[1:08:30] you're not in control by the holy spirit
[1:08:33] and whenever we get out of the out of
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:36] control of the holy spirit and we take
[1:08:38] things in our own matters and our own
[1:08:39] hands
[1:08:40] that's when we cause great damage to the
[1:08:42] kingdom of god
[1:08:43] and to our own selves you know
[1:08:48] there are you know there i mean
[1:08:51] it's not to diminish who you are because
[1:08:54] the bride of christ
[1:08:55] is the most important body in the world
[1:08:59] and the ministry that's one of the most
[1:09:02] important jobs
[1:09:03] but if you take and you get and then you
[1:09:06] exhaust yourself to a position it
[1:09:08] that you shouldn't be then you really
[1:09:11] really are in danger of doing some real
[1:09:14] terrible things
[1:09:17] three uh we'll read seventh in the
[1:09:19] seventh season
[1:09:21] that's a real powerful ministry it's one
[1:09:23] of the
[1:09:24] one of the most important messages in
[1:09:26] the message is the seventh seal
[1:09:29] and brother brandon was talking he said
[1:09:30] now i don't know the next thing would
[1:09:32] follow this
[1:09:33] would be the seven trumpets in another
[1:09:36] message
[1:09:36] but the seals practically everything is
[1:09:39] included the church comes down
[1:09:41] and we place them first which was the
[1:09:44] most important
[1:09:45] so see place in the church is most
[1:09:46] important
[1:09:48] but at that time now the opening of the
[1:09:51] seals
[1:09:52] where the church goes and how it ends up
[1:09:54] and now
[1:09:55] i think the heavenly father has
[1:09:56] certainly been gracious
[1:09:58] to us for letting us see what we have
[1:10:02] see that was important it doesn't
[1:10:04] diminish who you are
[1:10:05] you can be humble and still recognize
[1:10:08] your position in the body
[1:10:09] you can still you don't have to feel
[1:10:11] defeated and ejected because you're
[1:10:13] humble
[1:10:14] you can recognize that you are important
[1:10:17] and even in the scripture it says
[1:10:19] blessed are the feet of them that preach
[1:10:21] the gospel that's in romans
[1:10:23] so even the feet of those that plus that
[1:10:26] preach the gospel
[1:10:27] is beautiful in another place since
[1:10:30] first timothy
[1:10:31] chapter 5 and verse 17 it says that the
[1:10:34] ministry is
[1:10:35] to receive double honor now we can take
[1:10:37] that out of context
[1:10:39] and we can claim the ministry is twice
[1:10:41] as important to everybody else but
[1:10:42] that's not what it says
[1:10:44] it says double honor and if you go back
[1:10:47] and read the
[1:10:48] ain't going to go into it but if you go
[1:10:49] back and read the context you can
[1:10:50] understand more clearly what it's
[1:10:51] talking about
[1:10:52] because it's talking about the the
[1:10:55] charity versus those who's actually
[1:10:56] working
[1:10:59] so let's uh read uh and uh
[1:11:04] you have to forgive me sometimes if i
[1:11:06] talk on a subject it's
[1:11:08] kind of tight it kind of gets me a
[1:11:11] little nervous
[1:11:12] you don't know how people's gonna take
[1:11:13] it you know you you know we're the
[1:11:15] people of the whole book
[1:11:17] you know we we eat the whole book and
[1:11:18] it's impossible for one sermon
[1:11:20] at least it has been for me so far is to
[1:11:23] take and take the whole book
[1:11:24] and preached a whole book in one sermon
[1:11:26] so you're going to have to have to take
[1:11:27] either one portion or another and
[1:11:29] elaborate on that
[1:11:30] and then on another time there you're
[1:11:32] going to have to pick up the other
[1:11:33] pieces of the book
[1:11:34] because we don't want to be a partial
[1:11:35] per people who take a partial
[1:11:38] portion of the scripture and isolate
[1:11:40] that partial portion
[1:11:41] and just go to seed on that because if
[1:11:43] we do that we'll miss the other part
[1:11:44] and we're not supposed to do that we're
[1:11:45] supposed to take the whole book and eat
[1:11:47] the whole book and consume the whole
[1:11:48] book
[1:11:49] so just because one person is is
[1:11:51] dedicating an emphasis on one portion of
[1:11:53] the scripture in that service that does
[1:11:55] not mean he's rejecting another part of
[1:11:57] the service
[1:11:57] or another part of the scripture the
[1:11:59] whole scripture is important
[1:12:03] and we know that the and just from
[1:12:05] ephesians 4 there we know
[1:12:07] that the ministry one of the purposes
[1:12:09] they have was for the perfection of the
[1:12:10] saints
[1:12:12] we'll read in questions and answers now
[1:12:14] these questions and answers
[1:12:15] was in relation to the feast of the
[1:12:17] trumpets in 1964.
[1:12:20] this person asked the question he said
[1:12:22] dearly beloved let's see
[1:12:24] about the scripture of ephesians 4 11-13
[1:12:27] do we all do we get all the perfecting
[1:12:30] of the
[1:12:31] saint of the saints through the tapes or
[1:12:33] shall we be here where the gifts of the
[1:12:35] spirit are operating
[1:12:37] and the different offices of the church
[1:12:38] to help perfect us
[1:12:40] our hearts our hearts have believed all
[1:12:44] the word of the lord
[1:12:45] these are same sincere people they are
[1:12:48] believing the word with all of their
[1:12:50] hearts
[1:12:50] they are but they have an earnest
[1:12:52] question they say do the
[1:12:54] do the ministry perfect the saints or
[1:12:57] do we only get that through the tapes
[1:12:59] does the taste what perfect us
[1:13:01] and brother branham went down there he
[1:13:02] recognized who it was and he
[1:13:04] seen it was a sincere person then he
[1:13:06] answered a question and his answer was
[1:13:08] no
[1:13:09] they come here to the church for the
[1:13:12] perfecting
[1:13:13] see that no they want to come here to
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:18] church for the perfecting see that we
[1:13:20] get the fellowship one from another here
[1:13:22] at the church
[1:13:23] but the perfecting comes between us and
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:27] the blood of christ is what perfects us
[1:13:29] is
[1:13:30] in the holy spirit so it's the blood of
[1:13:34] christ that perfects us
[1:13:35] but in the scripture it says these gifts
[1:13:37] were given for the perfecting of the
[1:13:39] saints
[1:13:40] now some people who don't understand the
[1:13:42] bible or the message they'll see
[1:13:44] something like this and they say well i
[1:13:46] gotta reject what the prophet said
[1:13:47] because the prophet can't read
[1:13:49] can't contradict the bible so i'm only
[1:13:51] gonna take the bible
[1:13:52] so i'm gonna throw out what he says if
[1:13:54] you do that you're not really
[1:13:56] understanding what the bible says and
[1:13:58] you're not understanding what the
[1:13:59] prophet
[1:14:00] is saying okay so you got to take all
[1:14:02] the word the whole book not just a
[1:14:04] portion of the book that you like
[1:14:06] take the whole book and if you don't
[1:14:07] understand it that's fine that's good
[1:14:10] i mean you don't have to understand all
[1:14:12] the word but you do not reject
[1:14:14] it because when you reject it you will
[1:14:15] never understand it because you'll know
[1:14:17] go back never go back to revisit
[1:14:19] what you don't understand if you go back
[1:14:21] and visit something you don't understand
[1:14:24] maybe it wasn't your time to gain that
[1:14:26] understanding from the lord or catch
[1:14:28] that revelation at that time
[1:14:29] but later on down the road whenever you
[1:14:32] matured a little more
[1:14:33] or whenever those around you matured a
[1:14:35] little more then maybe
[1:14:37] it's become that proper time and season
[1:14:39] for you to get that revelation and then
[1:14:42] you can walk further in the faith of god
[1:14:45] it's not that in our own strength we're
[1:14:48] doing these things because if we do this
[1:14:49] in our own strength
[1:14:50] and we understand these things in our
[1:14:52] own intellect
[1:14:53] then that has no value either because
[1:14:56] then we're just doing it within our own
[1:14:58] strengths
[1:15:00] i mean i can still well i should
[1:15:03] seriously still i can borrow
[1:15:05] what brother juan said last weekend
[1:15:07] about the mother sometimes
[1:15:08] a mother's prayer can do more good than
[1:15:11] a
[1:15:11] preacher's sermon over the pulpit
[1:15:14] that can happen and there's instances of
[1:15:16] that even even the woman in memphis
[1:15:19] whenever she was praying for her son
[1:15:20] which was lost and wayward
[1:15:23] and she had he came down with a disease
[1:15:26] of a neural disease
[1:15:27] and he he was out hey it wasn't that he
[1:15:30] wasn't raised in a christian home you
[1:15:31] remember the story
[1:15:33] she said she prayed to the lord to give
[1:15:35] her a son
[1:15:36] and he answered her prayer so whenever
[1:15:38] he was a child
[1:15:40] a baby before he was even born his
[1:15:43] mother was a christian
[1:15:44] she believed the word and even
[1:15:48] during that time even a mother she she's
[1:15:50] doing all she can
[1:15:52] or father doing all he can to break up
[1:15:54] his children in the way of the lord
[1:15:56] and sometimes they get influenced by the
[1:15:59] wrong influence of their friends
[1:16:00] and they go do things which they will
[1:16:02] later regret
[1:16:04] because they think at that stage you
[1:16:06] know and in the adolescence they think
[1:16:08] they know more than everybody else so
[1:16:09] they don't want to listen
[1:16:11] and then they go get a bunch of scars
[1:16:13] and then years later they
[1:16:15] they they might not say it out vocally
[1:16:17] but years later
[1:16:19] within themselves they say i wish i
[1:16:20] would have listened to mother because
[1:16:22] she had a lot of experience that i
[1:16:24] didn't think she had
[1:16:26] and then they would have been protected
[1:16:28] from a lot of stuff
[1:16:30] i mean we can learn from mistakes we can
[1:16:33] either learn from our own mistakes or
[1:16:34] others mistakes
[1:16:36] if we see other people do things and
[1:16:37] they hurt themselves why would we want
[1:16:38] to go repeat that same mistake
[1:16:41] we don't have to now you can say well
[1:16:43] that's only a story that we heard that's
[1:16:45] not scriptural
[1:16:47] but can you say that because in the
[1:16:48] scripture judah
[1:16:50] did the same thing judah was
[1:16:53] hey we got what we got the father of
[1:16:55] abraham isaac and jacob
[1:16:57] and then jacob was the father of judah
[1:17:00] so he had a good lineage he had a good
[1:17:03] family
[1:17:04] that taught the truth all through his
[1:17:06] upbringing
[1:17:07] but he came to a place where it says in
[1:17:10] the scriptures
[1:17:11] he got around friends and whenever he
[1:17:13] got around to friends he went
[1:17:15] around and he started dating canaanite
[1:17:17] women
[1:17:18] he made a wrong decision and as a result
[1:17:21] of his wrong decision
[1:17:23] against his family's prayers it cost the
[1:17:26] lives of two of his sons and his wife
[1:17:28] died too
[1:17:30] and and we know from other other sermons
[1:17:34] from other people
[1:17:35] that the devil was doing everything he
[1:17:37] can to attack outlandish to keep jesus
[1:17:39] christ from coming forth because
[1:17:41] the scripture says from the line of the
[1:17:42] tribe of judah that will come to pass
[1:17:46] and we we see that somebody else had to
[1:17:48] step in
[1:17:49] which looked contrary to everybody
[1:17:51] else's opinion if it was right or wrong
[1:17:54] and she went and did it anyway because
[1:17:56] she was moved by the holy spirit
[1:17:58] because what is the most important thing
[1:18:00] in our lives is fulfilling the word of
[1:18:02] god
[1:18:03] and even though others might think when
[1:18:05] we're fulfilling the word of god
[1:18:07] that we're doing wrong or they think
[1:18:09] that we're a jonah
[1:18:10] because we went that way and the word
[1:18:12] says go this way we went that way anyway
[1:18:14] and we wind up find out later because
[1:18:17] it's a permissive will of god
[1:18:18] he will yank that permissive will back
[1:18:20] to his perfect will
[1:18:22] and jonah had to go exactly where he was
[1:18:25] predestined to go
[1:18:26] in order to step out of the mouth of the
[1:18:28] well to convert those people in nineveh
[1:18:32] we think that what we do sometimes is
[1:18:35] not correct
[1:18:36] even in our own eyes because we want to
[1:18:38] run away
[1:18:40] but when we're running away we're
[1:18:41] running straight to god
[1:18:43] how can you run from somebody that is in
[1:18:46] you
[1:18:47] what was it solomon one of them that
[1:18:49] said that he said i
[1:18:51] i tried to get away from god i was in
[1:18:53] the hell and i was looking god was with
[1:18:54] me i was here and god was with me
[1:18:56] he's going with you everywhere you are
[1:18:58] because he is in you
[1:19:01] praise the lord
[1:19:06] okay let's uh look at the uh importance
[1:19:08] again you know a lot of
[1:19:10] you know the seals are important we know
[1:19:12] the seals are important
[1:19:13] we know it is it says the greatest
[1:19:16] this right here is before the seals he
[1:19:18] said the greatest thing i preached that
[1:19:20] message up
[1:19:21] from here to on one time the lamb and
[1:19:23] the dove
[1:19:24] it's the greatest message i ever was
[1:19:26] given to me of the lord
[1:19:29] when god represented himself he
[1:19:31] represented himself
[1:19:32] from heaven a bird the meekest of all
[1:19:35] the birds the dove
[1:19:37] and god in the holy ghost is a self same
[1:19:39] person
[1:19:41] so that right there was one of the most
[1:19:43] important things
[1:19:44] you know the seals you know it tells us
[1:19:47] doctrine it tells us who we are it tells
[1:19:48] us
[1:19:49] our placing but here is talking about
[1:19:51] the nature of the
[1:19:52] individual himself is talking about the
[1:19:55] individual it's a one-on-one
[1:19:56] relationship between you and christ
[1:19:58] that is that was why he said it was one
[1:20:00] of the most important things
[1:20:02] one of them might be facts one of them
[1:20:03] might be revelation one of them might be
[1:20:05] this
[1:20:06] but one of them is who you are exactly
[1:20:08] yourself
[1:20:09] if you are not in the correct position
[1:20:11] yourself then you're not going to be
[1:20:13] able to receive the doctrine you're not
[1:20:14] going to be able to
[1:20:15] receive the revelation because you're
[1:20:17] not going to be in the correct
[1:20:18] atmosphere or the right spirit in order
[1:20:20] to receive the word
[1:20:21] so it's more important that you humble
[1:20:24] yourself and get on a wonder
[1:20:25] relationship with god
[1:20:27] instead of trying to figure out all this
[1:20:29] other stuff because everybody else is
[1:20:30] preaching on the eye stuff
[1:20:32] that's good but until you're humble what
[1:20:35] does one of the songs say
[1:20:36] the more i i lower myself down the more
[1:20:39] he can lift me up
[1:20:40] it is him that's lifting it up it's not
[1:20:42] us lifting ourselves up as god is
[1:20:44] lifting us up
[1:20:47] well let's go to uh one after the seals
[1:20:51] this is uh he mentions this in
[1:20:53] desperations but the sermon he's talking
[1:20:55] about is a token
[1:20:57] once again this is talking about the
[1:20:59] nature that's in you being changed
[1:21:02] because the nature in you is more
[1:21:03] important who is more important
[1:21:06] something external from you or something
[1:21:08] that's internal to you
[1:21:13] jesus said one time it ain't the it
[1:21:15] ain't the uh
[1:21:16] food that goes in your belly that tells
[1:21:19] who the person is it's the words that
[1:21:20] comes out of your mouth it tells who you
[1:21:21] are
[1:21:23] that tells who you're clean or clean or
[1:21:24] unclean
[1:21:26] said this this morning the message this
[1:21:29] morning was to me
[1:21:30] the highlight message of my entire
[1:21:32] ministry
[1:21:33] this morning see the highlight message
[1:21:36] of my entire ministry
[1:21:37] someday i'll tell you how it came about
[1:21:40] and i know that everything has worked
[1:21:42] for months and months and months
[1:21:44] up to that one message moving to come to
[1:21:47] that place
[1:21:48] that was the capping off time of it you
[1:21:51] see
[1:21:51] see he's talking about the token and
[1:21:54] what is the token
[1:21:55] that's that's a that's the relationship
[1:21:57] between you and christ
[1:21:58] that's you having your old desires die
[1:22:01] and go away
[1:22:02] and you take an empath on the desires of
[1:22:04] christ
[1:22:05] if you don't have the relationship with
[1:22:07] christ it doesn't matter what position
[1:22:09] you are in
[1:22:10] it will do you no good you can be as
[1:22:12] high as you want to you can be the
[1:22:14] president of the united states
[1:22:15] and if you ain't got that one-on-one
[1:22:17] relationship with jesus christ you're
[1:22:18] not gonna go on a rapture
[1:22:20] it's not gonna happen
[1:22:25] this is this is a we'll read a another
[1:22:28] quote here it says now
[1:22:30] i know you got to go to work in the
[1:22:32] morning your job is important your job's
[1:22:34] important
[1:22:35] even the ministry is important that job
[1:22:37] is important most important job
[1:22:41] your children is waiting on you your
[1:22:43] children is important
[1:22:45] your babysitter says she'll leave at a
[1:22:46] certain time
[1:22:49] okay to get this who's more important
[1:22:52] you paid a babysitter
[1:22:53] who's more important the babysitter or
[1:22:55] the baby
[1:22:57] baby okay god gave you a gift who's more
[1:23:00] important you are the gift
[1:23:04] and if you are a child of god and god
[1:23:06] gave you a gift to perfect you
[1:23:09] is it that gift perfecting you or is it
[1:23:11] god using the gift to perfect you
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:15] you know he can use any instrument that
[1:23:18] he wants to use
[1:23:19] to perfect you because god is concerned
[1:23:21] about you
[1:23:24] he can use an evangelist for that
[1:23:26] purpose
[1:23:27] he can use a pastor for that purpose he
[1:23:30] can use an apostle for that purpose
[1:23:32] he can use a teacher he can use any gift
[1:23:34] he wants to
[1:23:35] and if you reject those and if you are a
[1:23:37] disobedient child
[1:23:39] sometimes he will leave the ninety and
[1:23:41] nine and he will go and find you
[1:23:43] and he might use a different tool he
[1:23:45] might not use the ministry
[1:23:47] he could use the prayers of a mother
[1:23:49] that was brought out last weekend
[1:23:50] he can use any gift he wants because you
[1:23:53] are his child and if you are his child
[1:23:56] he wants you to come back home to him
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:24:00] that does not annoy the gifts that he
[1:24:03] gave that does not do away with the
[1:24:04] five-fold ministry it does not
[1:24:07] they are important but what's more
[1:24:09] important is what he's using them to
[1:24:11] accomplish
[1:24:13] so if a man exalts himself and asserts
[1:24:16] himself
[1:24:17] as if it's him that's doing it
[1:24:20] then he could be causing harm to god's
[1:24:22] child
[1:24:24] you know you are in the hand of the lord
[1:24:27] even in revelation he said he had the
[1:24:29] stars in his hands
[1:24:30] he was in his hand and if you're not in
[1:24:33] his hand you're doing it on your own
[1:24:34] will
[1:24:36] are you accomplishing what he wants you
[1:24:38] to accomplish
[1:24:43] this right here is talking about the uh
[1:24:44] the token this is in the token message
[1:24:46] he says every man
[1:24:48] no matter if he was his loyal man he
[1:24:51] might have been a pharaoh of egypt
[1:24:53] he was the most important man of the day
[1:24:55] but the token had to be applied to him
[1:24:58] no matter how important he was whether
[1:25:00] he's a bishop a priest
[1:25:02] whatever president king potentate
[1:25:05] monarch
[1:25:06] had nothing to do with it god only
[1:25:09] recognized the covenanted
[1:25:11] covenanted people same thing today the
[1:25:13] holy spirit will only recognize
[1:25:15] the covenant people so you you know you
[1:25:18] think
[1:25:18] i'll come to church here that's all i
[1:25:20] got to do
[1:25:22] what's going to happen if this church
[1:25:24] goes away one day
[1:25:25] where are you going to be then you know
[1:25:28] in the sales brother brown
[1:25:29] said that he believed the rapture would
[1:25:31] be will come in what three minutes
[1:25:34] you know you can look at that in
[1:25:35] prophetic time but what if that was
[1:25:36] literal minutes
[1:25:37] what would you do then because you know
[1:25:40] as well as i do
[1:25:41] that brother juan being a god called
[1:25:43] minister and a god called
[1:25:45] a pastor would he be here three minutes
[1:25:48] after
[1:25:48] after now if the rapture is going to
[1:25:50] come in three minutes what about four
[1:25:51] minutes from now
[1:25:53] what are you going to do now you got all
[1:25:54] your hope and all your
[1:25:56] your prestige and all your honor resting
[1:25:58] upon brother juan
[1:26:00] but if you haven't been applying what
[1:26:01] brother juan has been telling you over
[1:26:03] the years
[1:26:04] in your life and you haven't been saying
[1:26:06] lord humble me down so i can really
[1:26:09] receive your word
[1:26:10] not just receiving what a man says but
[1:26:12] what you're saying through that man
[1:26:14] then where are you going to be in four
[1:26:15] minutes you're still going to be here
[1:26:18] trying to defend the flesh
[1:26:20] are you going to be receiving what god
[1:26:22] spoke through that flesh
[1:26:24] in order to get you to come to him
[1:26:28] what's more important
[1:26:32] notice the the highest heavens
[1:26:36] you know if we we get to a position and
[1:26:39] god can't use us because we think we're
[1:26:40] so important
[1:26:42] and god's got to have us you know
[1:26:44] sometimes we
[1:26:45] we do that we get our eyes on the wrong
[1:26:46] thing we know that the ministry is
[1:26:48] important
[1:26:49] it's the highest calling in the in the
[1:26:51] land we know that
[1:26:53] but if we get our attentions on satan's
[1:26:55] eating instead of god's eating
[1:26:57] we'll say well the ministry we we don't
[1:26:59] get paid a lot of money we don't we're
[1:27:02] we're not the richest people in the
[1:27:03] world and we get our eyes we're the most
[1:27:04] important ministry
[1:27:06] and look at all these sports stars
[1:27:07] they're making millions
[1:27:09] see if we do that we'll lose our focus
[1:27:11] and we will not be doing our
[1:27:13] our calling because we got our mind on
[1:27:17] the wrong thing and if you do that
[1:27:18] you're on the way down
[1:27:20] and you're not going to be benefiting
[1:27:22] the people
[1:27:26] so what what happens in a situation like
[1:27:28] this it says
[1:27:29] notice the highest heavens hastening to
[1:27:32] honors god's earth the most humble and
[1:27:34] unlearned the highest of heaven came
[1:27:36] down to make himself known to the lowest
[1:27:38] of earth
[1:27:39] bypassing between to make himself known
[1:27:41] to common herdsmen
[1:27:43] coming to give these common herdsmen the
[1:27:45] greatest message
[1:27:46] of all times there had been many
[1:27:49] great messengers we would think of it
[1:27:52] and noah's day
[1:27:54] the prophets and the great priests and
[1:27:56] so forth
[1:27:57] had been in the days gone by great learn
[1:27:59] man kings
[1:28:00] potentates monarchs but here comes with
[1:28:04] the greatest of all messages
[1:28:06] what was the message the messiah is here
[1:28:11] and to make that known he bypassed all
[1:28:13] the train to do
[1:28:14] to make it known to humble shepherds
[1:28:20] think of it all the clergymen all the
[1:28:23] churchmen all the teachers
[1:28:24] all the theological training all the
[1:28:27] money had been spent all the churches
[1:28:29] the doctrines the denominations was all
[1:28:31] bypassed
[1:28:32] all the learning they had spent on all
[1:28:34] the missionaries the proselyting the
[1:28:35] membership
[1:28:36] everything they had thought they had
[1:28:38] done to honor god
[1:28:40] yet the key message of all of it was
[1:28:43] bypassed from them
[1:28:44] strange why why was that the case
[1:28:49] why why throughout the prophet's
[1:28:51] ministry whenever he he
[1:28:52] he was doing discernment and god was
[1:28:55] healing through his ministry
[1:28:57] why did he reach down to heal a little
[1:28:58] fish
[1:29:01] god is sovereign he can do anything he
[1:29:02] wants to when
[1:29:04] i'm even thinking of a situation where
[1:29:06] brother branham was was prayed for a
[1:29:08] lady
[1:29:10] and she was healed and then and then
[1:29:14] later on in the hospital she told her
[1:29:15] mother said mother i'm going home
[1:29:20] and uh her mother said i know you're
[1:29:22] going home you're going to go home after
[1:29:23] they dismiss you from the hospital she
[1:29:24] said no mother i'm going to my heavenly
[1:29:26] home
[1:29:27] and she passed away and went went with
[1:29:29] the lord
[1:29:31] and the prophet this right here is an
[1:29:32] important person
[1:29:34] he had an important ministry he got he
[1:29:37] he thought he got the wrong attitude and
[1:29:40] he said god
[1:29:40] you owe me an explanation god don't owe
[1:29:44] us nothing
[1:29:46] and he the prophet said god let him
[1:29:48] paddle around for a few days
[1:29:50] until he got humbled down and then the
[1:29:52] lord could come back and tell him the
[1:29:53] reason why he took her
[1:29:55] was because her time was before them but
[1:29:57] she wasn't right with the lord
[1:29:59] and what was more important was that she
[1:30:01] would be right with the lord than if she
[1:30:02] was here or there
[1:30:05] isn't that merciful whenever even in our
[1:30:08] our position
[1:30:09] whenever sometimes we're in the wrong
[1:30:12] and we should have died then
[1:30:14] but because our heart wasn't right we
[1:30:16] hadn't given ourselves to the lord
[1:30:18] we still hadn't received his new birth
[1:30:20] yet or we still hadn't accepted his
[1:30:22] salvation
[1:30:23] he postponed our death and said okay i'm
[1:30:26] going to give you a few more years until
[1:30:28] you get right
[1:30:29] and then whenever we get right that lady
[1:30:32] wasn't angry because she had to die
[1:30:34] that lady was happy what she realized
[1:30:38] what was more important
[1:30:39] wasn't that she could live here and get
[1:30:41] famous and and celebrate and have a
[1:30:43] bunch of parties
[1:30:44] her realization was that she could be
[1:30:46] with the lord
[1:30:49] where is our desires is our desire to be
[1:30:51] more popular to get more celebrations
[1:30:54] to be the most important person or is
[1:30:56] our desires to be fulfilling his word
[1:30:59] fulfilling his desires
[1:31:04] i can't get away from this microphone
[1:31:06] can i
[1:31:15] well you know the most important person
[1:31:17] of all time is jesus christ
[1:31:19] he knocks at your door and he gets
[1:31:21] turned away more than all the kings and
[1:31:23] potentially ever was
[1:31:26] you accept him you go out on the street
[1:31:28] and you say something about the outside
[1:31:29] world and they'll laugh in your face
[1:31:33] would you come who would come to your
[1:31:35] house any greater than jesus christ who
[1:31:37] would knock at your door
[1:31:38] greater than jesus christ who would do
[1:31:40] that
[1:31:41] the son of god could knock at your house
[1:31:44] who would be more important
[1:31:46] yet he knocks day after day and even
[1:31:49] if if you accept him you're called a
[1:31:51] fanatic you see
[1:31:52] the world knows it's on that's right but
[1:31:54] now he wouldn't come unless he had a
[1:31:56] reason to come
[1:31:59] you know you reject him he'll come again
[1:32:01] he'll knock you in
[1:32:02] he's coming for a reason he's coming
[1:32:05] because
[1:32:06] you are his own and he's trying to get
[1:32:08] you to respond to him
[1:32:11] it's not because you're not important
[1:32:13] you are important to him that's why he's
[1:32:14] coming
[1:32:15] that's why he's knocking on your door
[1:32:16] that's why he's saying respond to me
[1:32:19] come and accept me i will come into you
[1:32:21] and you can come into me and we'll have
[1:32:22] our abode together
[1:32:29] but if we get get out of out of shape
[1:32:32] we'll find out that king did this did
[1:32:35] now we find that this king old did like
[1:32:37] so many christians today
[1:32:38] he as long as he stayed humble
[1:32:41] then god blessed him but the bible said
[1:32:44] here that he got lifted up
[1:32:46] when he got everything secured then he
[1:32:49] became lifted up in his own self and
[1:32:51] then he was
[1:32:52] on his road out now that's so it is
[1:32:56] today
[1:32:57] with churches it's always been and when
[1:33:00] men feel that they have become
[1:33:01] sufficient
[1:33:02] they don't have to pray anymore they
[1:33:04] don't have to wait on god for their
[1:33:06] ministry
[1:33:07] your pardon the expression this has a
[1:33:09] backstory am i going to go into the
[1:33:11] backstory either
[1:33:12] i agree i agree with a certain writer
[1:33:16] that that's what has caused many of
[1:33:18] these men
[1:33:19] that's been in these latter day revivals
[1:33:21] or last day revival to fly to pieces
[1:33:24] some of them found they've been claimed
[1:33:27] to be drunk in the pulpit
[1:33:28] and some of them has done wrong
[1:33:31] so they are this right here was in the
[1:33:33] prophet's ministry one of the healing
[1:33:35] revivals was in full swing
[1:33:37] and they was preaching all over the
[1:33:38] country and it was it was people
[1:33:40] responding it was
[1:33:41] they was jumping and shouting all over
[1:33:43] the congregation it was really on fire
[1:33:45] and yet the ministry was found drunk in
[1:33:47] the pulpit
[1:33:50] you think i asked real bad but you can
[1:33:51] take that sin out and plug in another
[1:33:53] sin and it's just as bad
[1:33:55] you take the sin of drunkenness out you
[1:33:57] plug in the sin of watching
[1:33:59] worldly movies and tvs and all that
[1:34:01] stuff you can do that too it's the same
[1:34:03] thing
[1:34:04] i mean it says don't put any evil thing
[1:34:07] before your eye you can do that
[1:34:09] i mean i mean what's the difference one
[1:34:11] sin is bad as another sin
[1:34:14] you're saying that you're humbling and
[1:34:15] you feel sufficient you don't pray
[1:34:17] that's that's
[1:34:18] that's where he messed up right there is
[1:34:20] he quit praying and when he quit praying
[1:34:22] he wasn't humble and he thought he could
[1:34:24] get away with something because he
[1:34:25] thought he could keep it head
[1:34:26] and even if he thought he could was
[1:34:27] found out he thought the people wouldn't
[1:34:29] mind because they
[1:34:30] they loved him because he was so popular
[1:34:35] i mean it ain't got to be a obvious
[1:34:37] scent it can be like being greedy and
[1:34:39] hoarding on the money or whatever it can
[1:34:41] be any sin
[1:34:44] people they got the people sowing their
[1:34:46] grip that they can just do anything they
[1:34:47] want to and the people doesn't notice it
[1:34:49] but god notices it
[1:34:51] see that's the one i might say like
[1:34:53] nebuchadnezzar one day he walked out and
[1:34:55] said look what a great kingdom i have
[1:34:57] built
[1:34:58] and then the angel of the lord smote him
[1:35:00] so he could be the most powerful king of
[1:35:02] all that region
[1:35:03] the whole powerful king he was more
[1:35:05] powerful than anybody
[1:35:07] and he thought he did it within itself
[1:35:08] and it wasn't him that did it it was the
[1:35:10] lord trying to teach his children
[1:35:11] something
[1:35:12] and he lost the focus of what god was
[1:35:14] doing he thought it was him doing it
[1:35:15] himself
[1:35:16] and god smote him for it so just because
[1:35:19] we got an important position
[1:35:21] and we're an important people we
[1:35:22] shouldn't lose focus of the
[1:35:24] individual walk
[1:35:29] and if we do even though we've got a
[1:35:32] position that's important
[1:35:34] look at what it could lead to if we lose
[1:35:36] focus of our humility
[1:35:38] this is in the uh the sixth cell he said
[1:35:41] look
[1:35:42] there they crucified him pay attention
[1:35:44] to this
[1:35:45] the bible said that's the four greatest
[1:35:47] words there
[1:35:49] jerusalem the most holy city in the
[1:35:51] world
[1:35:52] most holy city you know is it just you
[1:35:55] know
[1:35:56] even in the scripture where it says they
[1:35:58] prayed and cried for the abominations in
[1:36:00] the city
[1:36:01] it doesn't mean they're praying and
[1:36:02] crying for the abominations out in the
[1:36:04] desert where they have no life
[1:36:06] it was in this city that's in the
[1:36:07] message that's in the truth that's where
[1:36:09] the truth is that's where
[1:36:10] life is is in the city the the jerusalem
[1:36:13] the most holy city in the world
[1:36:15] the most holy people in the world
[1:36:17] crucified
[1:36:18] the most brutal death in the world him
[1:36:21] the most
[1:36:22] important person in the world the person
[1:36:24] that he claimed to be worshiping and
[1:36:26] praising
[1:36:27] and all this there was the weary ones it
[1:36:29] was killing him
[1:36:30] so if you lose the focus of the personal
[1:36:33] walk and only look at the group overall
[1:36:35] picture
[1:36:37] we could be crucifying the very one
[1:36:39] we're claiming to worship
[1:36:42] and if you look at the uh
[1:36:48] well oh well
[1:36:53] now here's what it is we see there was
[1:36:55] two
[1:36:56] most important people that was the wrong
[1:36:58] way to do what they did then this is the
[1:37:00] correct way to do it
[1:37:02] there was two important people on the
[1:37:04] earth there was john the prophet
[1:37:06] and there was jesus the messiah they two
[1:37:09] men
[1:37:09] had the message of the day they met face
[1:37:12] to face in the water with their eyes
[1:37:13] caught one another
[1:37:15] and john in humility did say i have
[1:37:18] need to be baptized of thee why thou
[1:37:21] cometh unto me see john didn't
[1:37:24] understand
[1:37:25] but he still want to fulfill the word of
[1:37:27] the lord whenever we don't understand we
[1:37:29] still want to fulfill the word of the
[1:37:31] lord
[1:37:32] jesus says suffer it to be so that is
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:36] but thus it behooveth us or is becoming
[1:37:39] to us
[1:37:41] to fulfill all righteousness why am i
[1:37:44] god jesus being god john being a prophet
[1:37:47] quickly
[1:37:48] jesus knowed what he said that john
[1:37:51] being a prophet
[1:37:52] to who the word came to know that he
[1:37:56] would understand it
[1:37:57] because the sacrifice according to the
[1:37:59] law had to be washed before it was
[1:38:01] presented
[1:38:02] and jesus had to be baptized before
[1:38:04] presented
[1:38:05] he said suffer to be so that's right for
[1:38:08] thus it behooveth us
[1:38:09] to fulfill all righteousness
[1:38:13] see we don't understand sometimes but we
[1:38:15] are still supposed to obey the word
[1:38:18] you know i was speaking with with one
[1:38:20] person one time and
[1:38:21] and i was telling him what the prophet
[1:38:23] said on a certain matter
[1:38:24] and he said well this urban legend over
[1:38:26] here says something different so i'm
[1:38:28] going to believe the urban legend
[1:38:30] sometimes you know you hear people
[1:38:33] preach against the urban legends all the
[1:38:35] time urban legends all the time is all
[1:38:36] bad and all bad
[1:38:38] and they only want to take what the tape
[1:38:39] said but if you find something to tape
[1:38:42] say that they don't want to agree with
[1:38:43] then all of a sudden they want to take
[1:38:44] the urban legend that's not what we
[1:38:46] should do
[1:38:47] take both of them and if they don't jive
[1:38:49] together that means you don't understand
[1:38:50] them
[1:38:51] yeah but if they jive together then you
[1:38:53] can understand it better
[1:38:55] you see but some sometimes the urban
[1:38:58] legend ain't even
[1:38:59] ain't even in the message or anything
[1:39:01] it's just somebody's personal opinion
[1:39:03] you know like flying around on an
[1:39:04] airplane that's an opinion you can tell
[1:39:06] the difference between an opinion and
[1:39:08] what actually happened
[1:39:10] i mean somebody comes and says brother
[1:39:11] brandon told them something yeah you can
[1:39:13] you can accept that
[1:39:14] and my brother adam told him that but if
[1:39:17] you look at what they're saying they
[1:39:18] never
[1:39:19] never told them about an airplane never
[1:39:20] one time that's their opinion
[1:39:23] but if they can you can get the
[1:39:24] testimony and you get the word
[1:39:26] and you get the message and line them
[1:39:28] all up then you might have a little bit
[1:39:29] better understanding of what man say it
[1:39:31] you don't reject it just because you
[1:39:33] like the urban legend better you do the
[1:39:34] tapes
[1:39:36] you don't reject the taste because you
[1:39:37] like the urban legends you don't reject
[1:39:38] the urban legend because you like the
[1:39:39] taste
[1:39:40] it might be both of them are right and
[1:39:42] they might be you don't understand
[1:39:43] either one of them
[1:39:44] just like the bible and the message
[1:39:46] people look at the message says the
[1:39:47] messages contradict the bible the bible
[1:39:48] contradicts the message
[1:39:50] that's because they don't understand
[1:39:51] either one of them
[1:39:57] uh we'll find out if
[1:40:01] how how important we are in romans
[1:40:04] chapter 12 verses one through eight
[1:40:06] i have a plus there so there's a lot
[1:40:08] more but i'm not going to read the rest
[1:40:09] of it
[1:40:10] it says i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:40:13] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:40:15] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:40:17] wholly acceptable unto god which is your
[1:40:20] reasonable service
[1:40:22] now do we think we deserve a whole lot
[1:40:24] of stuff because
[1:40:26] this is one of the most important jobs
[1:40:28] in the world is to call out a bride out
[1:40:29] of the world
[1:40:31] it says that's a reasonable service
[1:40:36] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:40:39] you transformed by the renewing of your
[1:40:41] mind that you may
[1:40:42] prove that which is good and acceptable
[1:40:44] and perfect will of god
[1:40:46] for i say through the grace given to me
[1:40:49] to every man
[1:40:50] that is among you not to think of
[1:40:52] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:40:54] think
[1:40:55] that you think soberly according as god
[1:40:58] has dealt
[1:40:59] to every man the measure of faith don't
[1:41:01] think that you're worth nothing
[1:41:02] you're worth something but then think
[1:41:05] soberly
[1:41:08] you know i read every once while they
[1:41:10] have some kind of a propaganda thing on
[1:41:12] the screen at work
[1:41:14] and one of the things that came up it
[1:41:15] says being humble is not thinking less
[1:41:17] of yourself
[1:41:18] but to think of yourself less think more
[1:41:21] of somebody else
[1:41:25] for as we have many members in one body
[1:41:28] and all members have not the same office
[1:41:30] so we being many are one
[1:41:31] body in christ and every one members one
[1:41:34] of another
[1:41:35] having their gifts differing according
[1:41:38] to the grace that is given to us with a
[1:41:40] prophecy
[1:41:41] let us prophesy according to the portion
[1:41:43] of faith
[1:41:44] of ministry let us wait on ministering
[1:41:46] or of teaching on teaching
[1:41:48] or on exortus or he that exhorts us on
[1:41:52] exhortation
[1:41:53] he that giveth let him do it with
[1:41:54] simplicity that he rules
[1:41:56] with diligence he that showeth mercy
[1:42:00] with cheerfulness
[1:42:02] you know we could we could really abuse
[1:42:04] those scriptures right there
[1:42:06] you know with with those who show mercy
[1:42:08] with cheerfulness they say well this guy
[1:42:10] trespassed me this time but if he does
[1:42:12] it again i'm really going to get him
[1:42:13] that's not cheerfulness
[1:42:16] you know i forgive him this once you
[1:42:19] know it says
[1:42:20] you know what if i want you know as i
[1:42:22] was speaking earlier and i had that mask
[1:42:24] on i said i can impersonate anybody i
[1:42:26] want to
[1:42:26] if i wanted to try to deceive brother
[1:42:28] juan i could say well brother juan
[1:42:30] i tell you what samuel he's going to be
[1:42:32] real happy with me during his service
[1:42:34] today and isaiah he's going to be real
[1:42:35] disappointed
[1:42:36] and i tell him that and then without his
[1:42:39] knowledge i sneak out of the back room
[1:42:41] and i hand samuel
[1:42:42] 20 bill and i slap isaiah on top of the
[1:42:44] head
[1:42:45] and sure enough a self-fulfilled
[1:42:47] prophecy and he said well what he said
[1:42:48] was right
[1:42:49] but that is manipulation that's not what
[1:42:52] we're supposed to be as saints we're not
[1:42:53] supposed to be
[1:42:53] manipulating people
[1:43:00] i had to use somebody that
[1:43:04] that kind of respected me and wouldn't
[1:43:06] take offense of what i said you know
[1:43:11] one brother one brother asked me a
[1:43:12] question he said where does the king
[1:43:14] keep his armies
[1:43:15] he said i don't know and he said it in
[1:43:17] sleeves that's why i didn't pick on uh
[1:43:20] on jordan back here because he got some
[1:43:21] massive armies
[1:43:29] you know sometimes it's not the thing
[1:43:32] that we're doing
[1:43:33] but it's the concept behind the thing
[1:43:37] and we find out that brother branham was
[1:43:39] offered to give
[1:43:40] to be given a cadillac car in his early
[1:43:42] ministry and he he turned it down
[1:43:44] and the reason why he turned it down is
[1:43:46] more important than why he turned it
[1:43:48] down
[1:43:50] more important than him turning it down
[1:43:52] he said i
[1:43:53] had a chevrolet truck my phone rings
[1:43:56] someone wanted to buy me a cadillac
[1:43:58] car i searched it out and i come down
[1:44:00] through arkansas
[1:44:03] men out there in the audience these poor
[1:44:04] people knew out there
[1:44:07] with them long cotton sacks on their
[1:44:08] back picking cotton coming to the prayer
[1:44:10] line
[1:44:11] with a little maybe a little corn and
[1:44:13] bread at supper time and come down to
[1:44:15] the road do you understand
[1:44:17] it didn't i didn't come for that friends
[1:44:19] i come to help you
[1:44:20] that's what i'm here for is to help you
[1:44:23] see he could
[1:44:24] accepted the car and that might not have
[1:44:26] been a sin
[1:44:27] but because of the the image it would
[1:44:30] give to him
[1:44:32] he couldn't help the people because the
[1:44:34] people might have thought of him
[1:44:35] something different and he couldn't help
[1:44:37] them
[1:44:40] you know we all grow in grace and wisdom
[1:44:41] too and even the prophet grows in grace
[1:44:43] and wisdom
[1:44:44] and this this next quote here is it
[1:44:46] shows an example of where he grows
[1:44:48] in grace and wisdom you know we do
[1:44:50] things out of good faith
[1:44:51] but sometimes even though we do it in
[1:44:53] good faith it's wrong
[1:44:55] and we don't know what's wrong when we
[1:44:56] do it but we still do it because we're
[1:44:58] human and we don't know everything i'm
[1:45:01] going to read the first part and then
[1:45:03] the second part is where it really gets
[1:45:05] into him growing in grace and wisdom
[1:45:07] says now your contribution this
[1:45:09] afternoon thank you so much for it the
[1:45:11] lord bless you
[1:45:12] brother baxter did a great very nice job
[1:45:15] of doing that
[1:45:16] which knows how to do it we don't beg
[1:45:19] for money
[1:45:20] never i would never have a manager that
[1:45:22] would beg for money
[1:45:24] when come time for our meetings that
[1:45:26] won't pay out it's time for me to go
[1:45:27] home
[1:45:28] we don't want to believe in that we've
[1:45:32] been amended by many other brethren
[1:45:35] throughout
[1:45:35] in the magazines and so forth are
[1:45:37] keeping the financial part down saying
[1:45:39] nothing about it
[1:45:41] we have to have finances to run the
[1:45:43] meetings that's just common sense you
[1:45:45] know somebody has to pay the electric
[1:45:46] bill somebody has to
[1:45:47] clean the carpet somebody has to do this
[1:45:49] stuff somebody even has to put the
[1:45:50] carpet down the carpet didn't come for
[1:45:52] free
[1:45:53] you know it ain't like the brothers the
[1:45:54] church went over to the carpet store or
[1:45:56] the pa or the audio department
[1:45:58] over there said well the finances of the
[1:46:00] church ain't there and since
[1:46:01] my father owns a cattle on a thousand
[1:46:03] hills and i think i own at least one i'm
[1:46:05] gonna take your stuff and i'm gonna go
[1:46:06] put it in my church
[1:46:07] it don't work that way i mean these are
[1:46:09] common sense things we know it takes
[1:46:11] money to run
[1:46:12] these things okay
[1:46:15] i said uh many many times
[1:46:18] i've dumped the love offering that they
[1:46:21] give me
[1:46:21] and to pay for it to pay for the
[1:46:23] finances see they i took up for the
[1:46:25] finances of the meetings and then they
[1:46:26] took up a love offering for him
[1:46:28] and he said sometimes they do it enough
[1:46:30] money to pay for the expenses of the
[1:46:32] meeting
[1:46:32] so he took the money that they gave him
[1:46:34] and he put it into the feathering of the
[1:46:36] meetings
[1:46:37] it's all into the heart of the person
[1:46:39] that's dealing with it
[1:46:41] you know it you know whenever the people
[1:46:43] give money to the ministry
[1:46:45] you're supposed to do it out of
[1:46:46] joyfulness in the ministry in time
[1:46:48] in in the same kind he's supposed to be
[1:46:50] in joyfulness whenever he handles it
[1:46:53] that's what the prophet did in
[1:46:55] joyfulness
[1:46:55] he turned it back over to the
[1:46:57] furtherance of the kingdom
[1:46:59] all that isn't just exactly what i have
[1:47:01] to eat the people give me clothes
[1:47:04] and i don't have to have and that goes
[1:47:06] right straight to the foreign missions
[1:47:08] and i know this to be a steward over his
[1:47:11] welfare
[1:47:12] it goes to four missions i go myself to
[1:47:14] take the message that the lord has given
[1:47:16] me
[1:47:17] then at that day i know i've done the
[1:47:20] right thing with god's portion
[1:47:23] now this is the part where he gets
[1:47:25] talking into
[1:47:27] growing in wisdom he found something out
[1:47:30] by experience
[1:47:32] sometimes we go into the city and we
[1:47:34] give it over to
[1:47:35] different organizations and so forth we
[1:47:38] couldn't get out of the city till
[1:47:39] they'll be calling us holy rollers in
[1:47:41] divine healings
[1:47:43] and i give it to a certain organization
[1:47:45] one time i look going down the street in
[1:47:46] a
[1:47:47] great big cadillac car a man with a big
[1:47:51] cigar and diamond rings drawing about
[1:47:53] six or seven hundred dollars a month
[1:47:56] just going around to distribute that
[1:47:57] money so it wasn't even his money it was
[1:48:00] other people's money that he was
[1:48:01] distributing
[1:48:02] and he was cycling off of it to get this
[1:48:04] big huge salary
[1:48:06] now the dollar portion is important
[1:48:08] what's important
[1:48:09] was his intent because if you look at up
[1:48:11] in the inflation calculator
[1:48:13] that goes up to about six to seven
[1:48:14] thousand dollars a month
[1:48:16] see it's not the money it's what he was
[1:48:19] doing with it it wasn't even his money
[1:48:20] but he was taking it
[1:48:22] and hoarding a huge portion to himself
[1:48:24] just like judas was in
[1:48:25] in the bible he was hoarding a big huge
[1:48:28] portion of it to himself
[1:48:29] and he was giving a little bit away to
[1:48:30] the to the poor to make himself look
[1:48:32] good
[1:48:33] just like i said about slapping one of
[1:48:35] them on top they hadn't even the other
[1:48:36] 20.
[1:48:37] he was trying to manipulate to make
[1:48:38] people think others
[1:48:40] other others think of him highly more
[1:48:42] highly than what he actually was
[1:48:45] on an individual level who's more
[1:48:46] important what a man thinks of you
[1:48:48] or what god knows about you you ain't
[1:48:51] going to manipulate god
[1:48:52] you can manipulate me you can manipulate
[1:48:54] with brother juan you can manipulate
[1:48:56] anybody you want
[1:48:57] sometimes sometimes you get caught but
[1:48:59] you are never going to manipulate god
[1:49:01] and who's more important
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:06] well that wasn't right the poor little
[1:49:07] children are starving and hungry i know
[1:49:09] one thing is brother jackson was saying
[1:49:12] them little natives back there and so
[1:49:14] forth never heard the gospel
[1:49:16] don't know nothing about jesus no it's
[1:49:18] in my heart to take the gospel to them
[1:49:20] that's the general orders was to go into
[1:49:22] all the world preach the gospel to
[1:49:24] every creature that's what this
[1:49:26] contribution and everything that i have
[1:49:29] every penny that i don't have to use to
[1:49:31] keep my meetings
[1:49:32] going that goes right till we get
[1:49:35] through to go
[1:49:36] enough the fun to go and then
[1:49:39] we go sweden or wherever the lord would
[1:49:42] lead
[1:49:43] see it's not just isolated to one person
[1:49:46] it's everybody
[1:49:47] okay so you're not supposed to hoard it
[1:49:50] to yourself
[1:49:51] just to make yourself look good to other
[1:49:53] people and just give a little bit out to
[1:49:54] help people
[1:49:56] you're supposed to just do it with the
[1:49:57] sincerity of your heart
[1:50:04] you know even when you do the right
[1:50:05] thing sometimes other people are there
[1:50:07] to accuse you of being wrong even when
[1:50:09] you're not
[1:50:10] even when you do it in the right spirit
[1:50:11] you do it in the right attitude you're
[1:50:13] not doing anything wrong but somebody
[1:50:14] will come up and
[1:50:15] accuse you of doing something wrong i
[1:50:18] mean
[1:50:18] we'll find out whenever the fbi brother
[1:50:21] branham was talking about these fbi
[1:50:24] agents was going to come and expose him
[1:50:26] on a platform one day
[1:50:28] and they came and these now this right
[1:50:31] here
[1:50:31] they had an important job the ministry
[1:50:35] is an important job
[1:50:36] it is the highest calling there is most
[1:50:39] important
[1:50:40] most important job what the prophet said
[1:50:42] it was was the ministry
[1:50:43] but look and see who these people was
[1:50:45] that was doing this to the prophet
[1:50:48] it was going and this right here reminds
[1:50:50] me you know you
[1:50:52] have people on the outside looking in
[1:50:55] and they see a portion that they don't
[1:50:56] understand and then they want to accuse
[1:50:59] you of being false and wrong
[1:51:02] i mean even like the fbi agents we know
[1:51:04] that gene and leo
[1:51:05] set up a little fbi of their own and
[1:51:08] they're trying to accuse gina leo being
[1:51:10] the ones the fbi agents that this
[1:51:11] this was about but it wasn't if we read
[1:51:14] down here closely it was a real fbi
[1:51:16] agent
[1:51:16] where that was converted it wasn't gina
[1:51:18] leo they got converted
[1:51:20] too but they wasn't the ones there was a
[1:51:22] fake fbi trying to come and investigate
[1:51:24] them as an investigation just to find
[1:51:26] out on their own
[1:51:27] but the fbi themselves came in the
[1:51:29] meeting and they got converted
[1:51:31] okay so just because you have one story
[1:51:34] and it's true that don't mean the other
[1:51:36] story is not true as well
[1:51:37] because you can have multiple instances
[1:51:39] that is true
[1:51:43] i'm thinking of some testimonies now but
[1:51:45] you know paul said that
[1:51:48] all things are expedient but not
[1:51:49] everything is edifying you know
[1:51:51] yeah you can tell some testimonies and
[1:51:53] they're real powerful
[1:51:54] but if they're going to hurt people that
[1:51:56] that hate you you don't want to tell it
[1:51:57] because you don't want to hurt the
[1:51:58] people that hate you
[1:52:00] so you can tell testimonies and they
[1:52:03] might be edifying for yourself alone but
[1:52:05] you're not supposed to tell them before
[1:52:06] everybody because you can hurt somebody
[1:52:08] that
[1:52:08] that you don't even want to hurt you
[1:52:10] know if somebody hurts you you don't
[1:52:11] want to hurt them
[1:52:12] i mean even if you look in the scripture
[1:52:15] back whenever
[1:52:16] jonathan went up and fought the
[1:52:17] philistines you'll find
[1:52:19] there was there was people it was in
[1:52:21] hebrew and they was fighting on the
[1:52:23] wrong side of the battle there was
[1:52:25] hebrews fighting with the
[1:52:27] philistines against the hebrews
[1:52:30] and whenever they seen the hebrews
[1:52:32] gaining power and strength
[1:52:34] and they was going to win they changed
[1:52:36] size and came back to their own
[1:52:38] and fought the battle with the hebrews
[1:52:40] so because a brother is fighting me now
[1:52:42] that don't mean he's always going to
[1:52:44] fight me because he's my brother
[1:52:46] he could repent and come to the witness
[1:52:48] we read the back of the book we already
[1:52:49] know we're one in
[1:52:50] we already know we won the war and we
[1:52:53] have these people on the outside
[1:52:54] fighting us
[1:52:55] there might be some hebrews over
[1:52:56] fighting not recognizing who they are
[1:52:59] and you also find back there whenever
[1:53:01] whenever
[1:53:03] jonathan was fighting with his armor
[1:53:05] bearer that there was hebrews hiding in
[1:53:07] the rocks they weren't fighting for the
[1:53:08] enemy
[1:53:09] and they wasn't fighting for the hebrews
[1:53:10] they were scared to death
[1:53:12] but whenever they seen god moving the
[1:53:13] camp in the hebrews winning they came
[1:53:15] out of the rocks and then they have the
[1:53:16] hebrews too
[1:53:18] so there's all kinds of people just
[1:53:20] because they're fighting you now that
[1:53:21] don't mean they're your enemy
[1:53:23] they could be your friends so
[1:53:26] i mean but what is it brother brandon
[1:53:28] said that the bride don't persecute
[1:53:30] bride because bride don't persecute
[1:53:31] anybody
[1:53:34] i mean i mean humbleness is not
[1:53:37] just a word to say it's not false
[1:53:40] humility
[1:53:42] it's not i mean you can i can come in
[1:53:44] and act like i'm humble and i can be the
[1:53:46] most arrogant person in the world that
[1:53:47] don't mean i'm humble
[1:53:50] i can go in there and say that i don't i
[1:53:52] don't need to repent to anybody because
[1:53:54] i checked and i've never done anybody
[1:53:55] wrong
[1:53:56] you know i'm in a i was spit out on the
[1:53:57] cloud i floated down the earth i'm
[1:53:59] perfect and innocent all this stuff
[1:54:01] it's nonsense just walk like a normal
[1:54:03] human being you ain't got to brag
[1:54:05] all the time
[1:54:11] let's just read the highlights of this
[1:54:14] these uh fbi people put or these fake
[1:54:17] fbi people put fliers on all the cars
[1:54:20] out in the parking lots and said they're
[1:54:22] going to expose the prophet as a frog
[1:54:25] and uh one of the managers he got
[1:54:26] aggravated about his telling brother
[1:54:28] brown and his frustrations
[1:54:29] and brother brown said that's all right
[1:54:32] there's a higher law
[1:54:33] than the earth here that would take care
[1:54:35] of that but verily i say unto you
[1:54:37] whosoever shall speak a word against the
[1:54:39] holy ghost it will not be forgiven him
[1:54:41] this world nor
[1:54:42] the world to come and then he said the
[1:54:45] manager was just a little mentally upset
[1:54:46] because you know it will get under your
[1:54:48] skin if somebody's always persecuting
[1:54:49] you all the time and sometimes you're
[1:54:51] human you'll flare up
[1:54:52] i mean that that is a possibility and
[1:54:54] that was the case with the manager he
[1:54:56] flared up because it got underneath the
[1:54:57] skin
[1:54:58] brother brown said you're just a little
[1:54:59] upset just don't let it be that let it
[1:55:01] be for now
[1:55:02] and then a sister who was prayed for in
[1:55:04] the prayer line and got healed and knew
[1:55:06] that the supernatural was real and true
[1:55:09] came to came to brother branham and he
[1:55:10] told her he said don't you worry about
[1:55:12] that sis
[1:55:14] i've had fbi meetings two or three times
[1:55:17] and every time they
[1:55:18] got converted i said sure
[1:55:21] i like to have them again i mean when
[1:55:23] you know where you're standing you ain't
[1:55:24] gonna be afraid
[1:55:26] sometimes you can be afraid but you
[1:55:27] ain't gotta be
[1:55:29] i'm thinking of a time whenever a woman
[1:55:32] prophetess
[1:55:33] came and and and tried to control what
[1:55:36] brother branham did or said and he went
[1:55:37] letter
[1:55:38] and then uh mita got pregnant with one
[1:55:41] of her kids
[1:55:43] and the woman prophet issued a
[1:55:45] prophetess
[1:55:46] and said that god is going to kill me to
[1:55:48] punish bill for not listening to her
[1:55:51] and if you go back and read the tapes
[1:55:53] media was scared because of it
[1:55:55] somebody can't cause you fear but that
[1:55:57] don't mean you're in a wrong and it
[1:55:58] don't mean that that false
[1:56:00] prophet is true you got to look at your
[1:56:02] position in the word
[1:56:06] brother bran brother bosworth remembers
[1:56:09] one night in my meeting
[1:56:11] when the fbi came to seattle washington
[1:56:14] went out the next day and knelt down in
[1:56:16] the shooting gallery
[1:56:18] and said brother branham look how can i
[1:56:21] receive the type of the holy spirit
[1:56:22] you got i put my arms around him and led
[1:56:25] him to christ
[1:56:26] a year from now he retires he's going to
[1:56:28] go with me that's right
[1:56:29] i like to see people come in who's
[1:56:32] really sincere
[1:56:34] when you come to christ please be
[1:56:36] sincere you'll go a lot further with
[1:56:38] christ
[1:56:40] you're not going to fool christ as i
[1:56:41] said earlier you might fool me you might
[1:56:43] fool somebody else but you're not going
[1:56:44] to fool christ
[1:56:45] you might as well be sincere with him
[1:56:47] whenever you're at home in your closet
[1:56:49] with god you're
[1:56:49] between just between you and him you can
[1:56:52] tell him anything you want you ain't got
[1:56:53] to worry about him
[1:56:54] whispering and telling the neighbors he
[1:56:57] you know a lot of times when people is
[1:56:59] investigating you they're not doing it
[1:57:01] to your good i never known anybody
[1:57:02] investigate me for my own good they
[1:57:04] always want to do something harm to me
[1:57:06] but whenever you're dealing with christ
[1:57:07] you ain't gonna worry about him trying
[1:57:08] to hurt you
[1:57:09] everything he does is for your good
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:17] it one day while i was down in texas and
[1:57:20] a little newspaper went
[1:57:21] busted later on and carried a dirty
[1:57:23] article
[1:57:25] and said i was up there and a whole lot
[1:57:28] said i received so much money in a
[1:57:30] meeting
[1:57:31] that had taken two big men to pack the
[1:57:33] offer and out of the building
[1:57:34] which i was nothing but a lie it was
[1:57:36] somebody trying to accuse somebody just
[1:57:38] because they didn't like them
[1:57:40] brother sister this right here is what
[1:57:43] act what's what happened to another
[1:57:44] answer he said i have five
[1:57:46] hundred thousand dollars give to me at
[1:57:48] one time and refuse to put my name on it
[1:57:51] and told them to take it back that's
[1:57:52] right i had 25
[1:57:54] 000 give to me in one check on the
[1:57:57] platform at texas
[1:57:58] where a man from the texas oil owner
[1:58:00] came there and said my mother was healed
[1:58:02] out of the wheelchair
[1:58:03] and they just flew in there and i said
[1:58:05] sir i tore the check up before him i
[1:58:07] said that's right i'm a poor man
[1:58:09] it's not the amount of money it's what
[1:58:11] you're going to do with it
[1:58:12] if you don't need it why do you need it
[1:58:14] i mean i mean
[1:58:15] you're just going to have an excuse for
[1:58:17] somebody throw off on you
[1:58:19] somebody to accuse you of something
[1:58:20] you're not guilty of
[1:58:22] i mean it would not be a sin for him to
[1:58:24] accept that five hundred thousand
[1:58:25] dollars
[1:58:27] it would not be a sin for him to accept
[1:58:29] that twenty five thousand dollars
[1:58:30] it would not be a sin it wouldn't
[1:58:35] and it was a sin for that person to lie
[1:58:37] and say it took two men to take out of
[1:58:39] the offering when it didn't
[1:58:46] this man made a great remark and i put
[1:58:48] money in everything and i was just wrong
[1:58:50] god dealt with him see god dealt with
[1:58:53] that person that was doing the false
[1:58:54] accusation
[1:58:55] you ain't got to deal with them got to
[1:58:56] deal with them
[1:58:59] and this this right here gave another
[1:59:01] chance for him to get a testimony of a
[1:59:03] brother that was
[1:59:04] hit by a stroke and this brother was hit
[1:59:06] by a stroke
[1:59:08] and he was paralyzed down one side and
[1:59:10] his wife had to take care of him and
[1:59:11] everything and
[1:59:12] he was going to die and he called
[1:59:14] brother brown his relatives called
[1:59:15] brother brown on the phone
[1:59:16] and they pray for him over the phone and
[1:59:18] god saved his life where he wouldn't die
[1:59:20] but he still had the after effects of
[1:59:22] the stroke
[1:59:24] and he came up to a prayer line in
[1:59:26] another meeting
[1:59:28] and brother branham called the prayer
[1:59:29] cards from one number to another number
[1:59:32] and his number would have been the next
[1:59:33] number
[1:59:35] and and look at the sincerity of this
[1:59:37] man and just because
[1:59:39] you might be sincere person you might
[1:59:42] misunderstand somebody else who isn't
[1:59:43] seer
[1:59:44] is sincere they're sincere and you're
[1:59:46] sincere
[1:59:47] but you still might misunderstand them
[1:59:49] and this is the case where brother
[1:59:50] branham misunderstood this brother
[1:59:53] he came to him and told him about the
[1:59:55] prayer cards
[1:59:57] oh let me find it
[2:00:02] and uh he said
[2:00:05] if i could only got to the line and
[2:00:07] brother brown said
[2:00:08] well brother reed that wouldn't have
[2:00:10] healed you brother
[2:00:12] he said no brother branham but i want to
[2:00:14] know what i've done
[2:00:16] if i've done anything god knows i'm
[2:00:18] sorry for it
[2:00:19] he said why should i have to go like
[2:00:22] this through life now
[2:00:24] i'm glad to be living holding like that
[2:00:27] the boy trying to hold him and his wife
[2:00:29] like that see
[2:00:31] he was just wanting to know what he did
[2:00:32] wrong so he could make it right
[2:00:34] it wasn't that he was trying to use
[2:00:36] brother brown as a ouija board
[2:00:38] and that's what brother brown
[2:00:39] misunderstood him was trying to do he
[2:00:40] said that right there ain't gonna be
[2:00:42] that's not the key
[2:00:43] the key ain't me coming to tell you this
[2:00:45] or that and you're getting healed
[2:00:46] through me
[2:00:47] the key is go through christ and and
[2:00:50] just because brother branham
[2:00:51] misunderstood him
[2:00:53] he expressed himself with sincerity
[2:00:56] and then brother branham had division
[2:00:58] and and brother branham saw him with a
[2:01:00] brown suit on
[2:01:02] straight lifting up his hands and arms
[2:01:04] walking
[2:01:05] like a normal person praising the lord
[2:01:09] that was the vision and he said i don't
[2:01:11] know when it's going to happen it might
[2:01:12] be next year 10 years from now i don't
[2:01:14] know but it does say with the lord
[2:01:16] sometimes we're we're kind of impatient
[2:01:18] and we want it to happen right now but
[2:01:19] sometimes it don't happen that way
[2:01:23] and then whenever the f this right here
[2:01:25] years down the road whenever these fbi
[2:01:27] people came in was trying to expose the
[2:01:29] prophet
[2:01:30] brother brown saw this brother on the
[2:01:32] street and that was another thing the
[2:01:34] lord had to delay him from going into
[2:01:35] the hotel room because he's going to go
[2:01:36] in the hotel room and miss it the lord
[2:01:38] had to delay him and he delayed him by a
[2:01:39] certain
[2:01:41] chain of events and then when he turned
[2:01:42] around fixing to go back in the hotel
[2:01:44] room
[2:01:45] he saw this brother standing by the palm
[2:01:46] tree raising his hand praising the lord
[2:01:49] so he would this even though satan
[2:01:51] attacks you it might be god trying to
[2:01:53] give you an opportunity to testify of
[2:01:54] his glory and power
[2:01:56] so they can attack you that's fine
[2:02:00] so let's go down here and see
[2:02:03] even though the most important job in
[2:02:05] the world is called a bride out
[2:02:07] to be it to be a minister or to be any
[2:02:10] kind of cop you can be a doctor or
[2:02:11] anything you want to and if you get put
[2:02:13] your emphasis on that instead of who you
[2:02:15] are as an
[2:02:15] individual between you and the lord
[2:02:17] you're missing a boat
[2:02:19] said i have been told here according to
[2:02:22] this
[2:02:22] that the fbi is going to expose me
[2:02:25] tonight
[2:02:26] i said all right all right fbi wherever
[2:02:28] you are my manager is gone
[2:02:30] and so forth you know they ain't going
[2:02:32] to worry about having a manager try to
[2:02:33] fight them or resist them
[2:02:35] i invite you to come up to the platform
[2:02:37] and expose me
[2:02:38] if there is anything i've done that is
[2:02:40] illegal contrary to the bible
[2:02:42] anything illegal to the laws of the
[2:02:44] nation anything you want come up and
[2:02:46] expose me
[2:02:47] tell me where i'm wrong which i knew
[2:02:50] there was no fbi
[2:02:53] i just stood there a little bit and
[2:02:54] waited a little while
[2:02:57] and so on and so on se and then he
[2:03:00] he waited and he said oops i thought you
[2:03:03] were going to expose me i said all right
[2:03:06] you're not fbi agents you're backslidden
[2:03:09] preachers that's exactly what you are
[2:03:11] you ask anybody you wish to ask my
[2:03:13] manager i said you're backslidden
[2:03:15] preachers
[2:03:16] i challenge you in the name of jesus
[2:03:17] christ you wrote this down and said i
[2:03:20] was a simon or sorcerer
[2:03:21] if i am simon the sorcerer and you are
[2:03:24] holy man then you come to the platform
[2:03:26] and god strike me dead then if i am a
[2:03:28] man of god and you're wrong then you
[2:03:30] come to the platform and god strike you
[2:03:32] dead come on down now
[2:03:35] these men elevated themselves to such a
[2:03:38] high position
[2:03:39] that they thought there was above
[2:03:41] everybody even the messenger to the age
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:45] and they was humbled down because they
[2:03:47] was exposed for being exactly what they
[2:03:50] are they were exalted themselves instead
[2:03:52] of being humble before the lord
[2:04:00] no matter how high position that we
[2:04:02] think we are
[2:04:04] we should not exalt ourselves and think
[2:04:07] we're better than everybody else when
[2:04:08] we're not
[2:04:13] there's another place in 1964 where he
[2:04:16] talks about that brother being drunk in
[2:04:18] the pulpit
[2:04:21] and he says sometimes we get to a place
[2:04:23] and think that god blesses us he gave me
[2:04:25] this special blessing whether it's a
[2:04:27] lexus or cadillac or whatever it is a
[2:04:29] better job
[2:04:30] a nice house or whatever it is it don't
[2:04:32] matter what it is there's no sign that
[2:04:34] you can't
[2:04:35] turn his blessings from you when you get
[2:04:38] lifted up and feel
[2:04:40] well i i once laid all night and prayed
[2:04:43] i once did this i do that i don't do it
[2:04:46] anymore
[2:04:47] then you're on dangerous ground you're
[2:04:49] looking back
[2:04:50] to your experiences of yesterday and you
[2:04:53] don't have an experience or a personal
[2:04:54] walk now
[2:04:55] it's good that you had an experience
[2:04:57] yesterday but it's important that you
[2:04:58] also have that walk now
[2:05:00] yes that's what's the matter with our
[2:05:02] pentecostal people
[2:05:04] you can say message people either one
[2:05:06] well back yonder
[2:05:07] a long time ago when we had little
[2:05:09] missions down on the corner somewhere
[2:05:11] and the women with no stockings on and
[2:05:13] beating the tambourine down there had to
[2:05:15] pray all night and everything cops
[2:05:16] locked you up
[2:05:17] stayed in jail and so forth you prayed
[2:05:19] the churches all the denominations
[2:05:21] laughed at you made fun of you
[2:05:23] but now god has lifted you up to you
[2:05:26] got some of the best churches in the
[2:05:28] country great powerful ministries
[2:05:31] you begin to feel secure be careful
[2:05:34] that's when you get lifted up then when
[2:05:37] god sends
[2:05:38] something you can't accept it anymore
[2:05:41] because you've already witnessed to this
[2:05:43] thing
[2:05:44] that's real dangerous when god sends us
[2:05:46] something we cannot receive it because
[2:05:48] we think we're better than that
[2:05:50] then you begin to feel secure that's the
[2:05:52] time you're on your road to fall
[2:05:55] that's for denominations or nations or
[2:05:57] whatever
[2:05:58] what we need in this nation and will
[2:06:01] never receive
[2:06:02] it it's not a political house cleaning
[2:06:04] it's a holy ghost scent revival that'll
[2:06:06] sweep her from tip to toe
[2:06:08] that's what our churches need that's
[2:06:10] what our people needs
[2:06:12] that's what as individuals we need
[2:06:14] that's our influence when we get lifted
[2:06:16] up and say i'm pentecostal i spoke with
[2:06:18] tongues i shouted i danced in the spirit
[2:06:21] you might have done that but let me tell
[2:06:23] you something
[2:06:24] brother that's no security to you not a
[2:06:26] bit
[2:06:27] we find out that uzi got lifted up in
[2:06:30] his heart we found out that god smote
[2:06:31] him
[2:06:32] what did he do he tried so much to take
[2:06:35] a minister's place he thought that he
[2:06:36] got lifted up and god blessed him
[2:06:39] made him a great man so he could do
[2:06:41] anything he wanted to do
[2:06:43] he said i heard a young man tell me not
[2:06:46] long ago he said
[2:06:48] you know god loves me so much brother
[2:06:50] branham he just let me do anything i
[2:06:52] want to
[2:06:53] he don't care sure he cares people think
[2:06:56] they can go live out in the world and
[2:06:57] then come into church
[2:06:59] and do everything in the church too i
[2:07:01] mean if you're a sinner
[2:07:03] then you need to stay in the pew until
[2:07:04] you repent and get it right
[2:07:07] you know it's not a shame to be in sin
[2:07:11] it's a shame to stay in sin you can come
[2:07:12] out of it you can repent
[2:07:15] and i mean people want to go straight
[2:07:17] from the bar to the pulpit
[2:07:19] straight to the bar back to the bar back
[2:07:21] to the pulpit again
[2:07:22] and think they're right and living for
[2:07:24] god you're not living for god whenever
[2:07:25] you're
[2:07:26] lit servant who can serve two masters
[2:07:28] you can't serve the devil
[2:07:29] and god at the same time you need to
[2:07:32] make up your mind
[2:07:40] well this right here i know this right
[2:07:41] here is about
[2:07:43] another church but if we have the same
[2:07:46] spirit as that church we're just as
[2:07:47] guilty as that church
[2:07:50] so pay attention to make sure that we're
[2:07:52] not guilty
[2:07:54] you know we as a people we might not be
[2:07:57] guilty of this
[2:07:58] but if we're not careful and we let
[2:08:00] satan come in and give us a wrong
[2:08:01] attitude we could be guilty of it
[2:08:03] because we know for a fact that this
[2:08:05] gospel which we preach is going to go
[2:08:07] back to the jews
[2:08:08] and god is going to turn from the
[2:08:10] gentiles to the jews
[2:08:11] it might not be now but we know in the
[2:08:13] future that
[2:08:14] this even what we call the message in
[2:08:17] this country
[2:08:18] is not going to be in god's perfect will
[2:08:21] anymore
[2:08:22] they are going to be nothing but foolish
[2:08:23] virgins
[2:08:26] caught in a great tribulation because
[2:08:28] god is going to be dealing with the jews
[2:08:29] whenever the rapture of the church
[2:08:30] happens
[2:08:32] it's gone it's not gone now because the
[2:08:35] rapture hasn't happened
[2:08:38] but whenever the rapture happens and god
[2:08:40] returns to the jews
[2:08:41] this right here could be happening right
[2:08:43] in the message churches
[2:08:47] do you know that this church was
[2:08:49] actually more wicked than ahab
[2:08:52] ahab there's a lot of types and symbols
[2:08:56] in ahab
[2:08:57] i mean you can look at ahab he had he
[2:08:59] had he went to war against the mighty
[2:09:02] army
[2:09:02] and it was prophesied that he would win
[2:09:04] that war and he did it with a very very
[2:09:07] small group of men
[2:09:09] he did does that mean he could lift
[2:09:12] himself up and think he did it in his
[2:09:13] own strength
[2:09:15] not so long after that god punished him
[2:09:18] so if we even when we see
[2:09:19] supernatural miracles in our midst if we
[2:09:22] haven't got that personal relationship
[2:09:24] with god
[2:09:25] if we haven't received that holy ghost
[2:09:27] if we haven't received that token
[2:09:29] then what good does all this stuff do
[2:09:31] you have to have that personal
[2:09:33] relationship
[2:09:35] do you know that he repented for a while
[2:09:37] and walked softly before god you can't
[2:09:39] say that about the roman catholic church
[2:09:41] no sir
[2:09:42] she never repented but has stubbornly
[2:09:44] destroyed
[2:09:45] any and all who tried to help her repent
[2:09:48] that wouldn't be a mean tone
[2:09:49] everything's trying to help her to
[2:09:50] repent
[2:09:52] that is history now god kept rising up
[2:09:55] not only the messengers to each age
[2:09:57] but he raised up some wonderful helpers
[2:10:00] for those messengers
[2:10:02] he gave every age some wonderful men of
[2:10:04] god they did everything they could to
[2:10:06] bring the church back to god
[2:10:08] god certainly gave her opportunity to
[2:10:11] help her to repent
[2:10:13] did she ever repent show that she did by
[2:10:16] her fruits no
[2:10:17] sir she never has and never will she is
[2:10:20] drunk
[2:10:20] she has lost her senses and spiritual
[2:10:23] things
[2:10:24] now don't be confused and start thinking
[2:10:26] the church of rome has repented of her
[2:10:28] slaughter and his saints
[2:10:29] because she attempting to unite with the
[2:10:31] protestants and make her creeds line up
[2:10:33] with the protestant creeds
[2:10:36] i mean you'll find this i mean it it's
[2:10:39] it's evident if you just open your eyes
[2:10:40] and look around i mean they're doing it
[2:10:43] not once has she ever apologized and
[2:10:46] said
[2:10:46] she was wrong for her mass murders she
[2:10:49] won't either
[2:10:50] and no matter how mellow and sweet she
[2:10:53] appears at this particular time
[2:10:54] she will rise up to kill for murder lies
[2:10:57] in her evil unrepented heart
[2:11:01] that's true i mean look how pious they
[2:11:03] are i mean
[2:11:04] they'll come out and say we all need to
[2:11:06] just remove all the borders and
[2:11:08] we need to just let everybody come up
[2:11:10] and you know what it is it's just her
[2:11:12] trying to strengthen her grip on the
[2:11:13] country so that she can have that force
[2:11:15] to persecute anybody don't agree with
[2:11:17] her system or doctrine that's right
[2:11:20] i mean you had even uh george bush came
[2:11:22] out the other day he was on a podcast
[2:11:24] and he was
[2:11:24] condemning protestants has been in one
[2:11:26] party versus the other
[2:11:28] they're they're coming out and saying
[2:11:30] these things releasing them one day
[2:11:32] they're going to pounce and they're
[2:11:33] going to grip and they're going to
[2:11:34] strangle everybody
[2:11:35] don't agree with them and it ain't just
[2:11:38] christians either
[2:11:38] look they killed galileo galileo and he
[2:11:41] wasn't even a christian
[2:11:44] it comes to music i mean they
[2:11:47] i mean why why do we see these things in
[2:11:49] the news and then we
[2:11:51] wonder why are we surprised when they
[2:11:53] happen i mean they've been said we're
[2:11:55] going they're going to happen
[2:11:56] they're going to happen

[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:52] yes
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:15:06] my
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:48] my
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:58] do not pass
[2:16:02] me bye
[2:16:06] we have an important prayer request here
[2:16:08] we want to remember
[2:16:10] and
[2:16:14] there will be a little meeting for the
[2:16:16] musician right after service you can
[2:16:18] stay
[2:16:19] and talk about things
[2:16:25] but let's remember
[2:16:28] the most important person in this
[2:16:30] building is the lord jesus
[2:16:33] the most important thing that we come to
[2:16:36] do
[2:16:36] is to worship him
[2:16:39] that is the most important thing
[2:16:44] i hope we we kind of for grab grabs the
[2:16:48] the message this morning
[2:16:52] if we would just ask ourselves every day
[2:16:55] what is the most important thing
[2:17:00] what is the most important thing in my
[2:17:01] home
[2:17:03] they say the furniture you see the
[2:17:06] television is this the thing that we
[2:17:08] paid
[2:17:08] hundreds of dollars for the most
[2:17:12] important thing in that home is the
[2:17:13] family
[2:17:17] it's the family it's not the money it's
[2:17:20] not it's not the things that we bought
[2:17:22] and how
[2:17:23] best we document the house is the family
[2:17:27] that's the reason why sometimes people
[2:17:29] lose their mind when children break
[2:17:31] little furniture they get so crazy you
[2:17:33] know how much money i spend for this and
[2:17:35] you know they get so mad because they
[2:17:38] don't know the
[2:17:38] important things
[2:17:43] how's money wife what is the important
[2:17:45] thing your house money is important than
[2:17:46] you
[2:17:47] your wife is important in you
[2:17:51] if you ever see it like that
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:17:55] you always strive to keep the important
[2:17:57] thing
[2:18:00] but if you think that you are important
[2:18:02] you will get the less important thing to
[2:18:04] go
[2:18:04] because you think you are important
[2:18:10] what is the important thing
[2:18:16] between you and and maybe
[2:18:21] even the food you eat
[2:18:25] [Music]
[2:18:27] see all these people that you know that
[2:18:30] has to get
[2:18:33] alcohol or you know get drunk or
[2:18:35] something else for them to feel
[2:18:37] satisfied what is important
[2:18:41] if you just think about it what is
[2:18:43] important
[2:18:50] you can pay for the life that you have
[2:18:54] if god did not woke you up this morning
[2:19:02] it would be a complete different story
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:09] i think that's what the message was
[2:19:11] driving to this morning
[2:19:13] malachi chapter 4 behold i send you
[2:19:15] elijah the prophet
[2:19:17] what is important it's not elijah
[2:19:20] it's the one to whom he sent elijah
[2:19:24] behold i sent you
[2:19:28] god love you so much
[2:19:34] that he send you a gift he send you a
[2:19:37] message
[2:19:38] [Music]
[2:19:40] to get you ready for a rapture
[2:19:48] what is the most important thing
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:19:53] between you and your clothes that you
[2:19:54] wear
[2:19:57] between you and the food that you're
[2:20:00] eating
[2:20:02] is the important thing let's buy our
[2:20:05] house
[2:20:06] we want to take these needs to the lord
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:11] we're the lost and the lonely
[2:20:17] bring their burdens and their kids
[2:20:21] this is your house
[2:20:26] this is your heart
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:42] father come and work
[2:20:47] we are your hearts
[2:20:53] it's a holy house of
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:09] we are your hearts
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:25] prayer requests this morning her dad is
[2:21:27] not feeling well
[2:21:28] and acts that we lift him up to the lord
[2:21:32] brother stephen wools uh had to be
[2:21:34] rushed to
[2:21:35] the emergency this morning he's not
[2:21:37] feeling well
[2:21:38] and let's just take these needs to the
[2:21:40] lord as we just bought our hearts
[2:21:43] realizing that
[2:21:48] the ones that we are praying for are
[2:21:50] important
[2:21:52] then the words that we will say
[2:21:56] the one that we are speaking to is
[2:22:06] important
[2:22:08] and as you just think about the message
[2:22:10] this morning
[2:22:14] say lord
[2:22:20] i don't need to tell you what to say
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:26] but i sat there listening to the wording
[2:22:29] i just running through my mind and
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:34] trying to rearrange things in my mind
[2:22:36] and in my heart
[2:22:39] because sometimes we put the less
[2:22:41] important things
[2:22:44] we use all our energy after the less
[2:22:47] important things
[2:22:48] and the things that are very important
[2:22:52] when jesus in his own word said man
[2:22:55] shall not lay by bread alone
[2:22:58] but by every word that proceed out of
[2:23:00] the mouth of god
[2:23:03] and sometimes those are the those are
[2:23:05] the less things in our life
[2:23:11] what is most important
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:21] what is most important
[2:23:22] [Music]

[2:26:12] daily tax lord and we are faithful
[2:26:14] father god lord
[2:26:16] with decision to make lord god and we
[2:26:18] have faced lord father with things to
[2:26:20] talk about
[2:26:22] may we ask ourselves what is important
[2:26:27] is it my super little pride
[2:26:30] or just saying the truth
[2:26:35] what is important
[2:26:55] and because we think so much of
[2:26:57] ourselves sometimes
[2:26:58] we are struggling with things in our
[2:27:00] lives and and and we know they are not
[2:27:03] good for us but we we just
[2:27:04] we just try to to to uh
[2:27:08] keep a wrong picture i know
[2:27:11] no doubt in my mind when brother george
[2:27:13] came out this morning without marks on
[2:27:15] his
[2:27:16] face i know floss of thoughts went
[2:27:18] through our mind and
[2:27:20] was thinking what is this guy doing
[2:27:29] sometimes we don't hold ourselves for
[2:27:31] the meaning
[2:27:32] to say okay what's going on
[2:27:36] okay lord help me to to think about this
[2:27:39] as soon as we see things we start to
