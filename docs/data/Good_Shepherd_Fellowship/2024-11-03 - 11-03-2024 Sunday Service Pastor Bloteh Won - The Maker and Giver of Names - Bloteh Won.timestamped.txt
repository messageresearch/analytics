[48:33] know I've been brother loger for a very
[48:35] long time and uh in some way we are
[48:38] related uh his mom is uh uh some somehow
[48:42] related to my dad and uh uh but uh uh we
[48:49] knew one another very long time and and
[48:52] uh uh
[48:58] when he started his
[49:00] work and uh uh back he came over to the
[49:04] a coast see me and uh we didn't know we
[49:07] were related at at the time and uh we
[49:10] spent some time together share with me
[49:12] and everything that was going on back
[49:14] home and I just I just uh I just felt
[49:18] burden that I I needed to to stand with
[49:21] this brother and help him so every time
[49:23] I go home I will spend some time with
[49:25] his church and and and uh and then we we
[49:28] been uh very good I was I was trying
[49:31] maybe one of these days just show you
[49:33] where we started from they started from
[49:35] they were using the brother's yeah his
[49:38] his compound they had a small Church
[49:41] there that's where we started
[49:43] from uh and then uh uh the B the land
[49:47] like he said on Wednesday night I was
[49:50] back home I remember uh one of my first
[49:53] letter I got from G sheeper Fellowship
[49:56] brother scat wrote me and asked uh uh
[50:00] which way they could help uh because
[50:02] they knew I was preaching I was
[50:03] traveling I told him I said well uh
[50:06] personally I think I'm doing okay for
[50:08] the little things that I'm doing but I
[50:10] think there's a group here that you can
[50:12] help so we recommended brother Elijah at
[50:14] the time so uh uh and then it just
[50:17] happened there just at the time they
[50:19] were helping him then I got my Visa to
[50:22] come to the state so we came and then we
[50:24] went back for the church dedication
[50:27] he's down in Wisconsin brother Peterson
[50:29] drove him there had service last night
[50:33] and and this morning and uh so we we
[50:37] just appreciate the Lord for that amen
[50:41] amen amen we could we could just go on
[50:44] and on and on you know we sang that song
[50:46] where would I be only you know and
[50:49] that's truth praise the Lord last week I
[50:52] was preaching uh I went home I was
[50:53] thinking about it I think uh I kind of
[50:56] for miscalculated my age because I
[50:59] remember that that would have been
[51:03] my my 16th birthday or 17th
[51:08] birthday and uh uh I had some friends
[51:13] that was planning to do a birthday party
[51:15] for me that uh uh and they really wanted
[51:19] to get me drunk that night but that was
[51:22] the very same night God came down and
[51:24] saved me I was on my way to that
[51:27] birthday party that night when I saw the
[51:31] friend preaching on the
[51:33] street stand up to listing for the wi
[51:37] and and uh still remember he was
[51:39] preaching souls in
[51:41] prison and uh
[51:45] uh and then I kick my head out of it I
[51:48] said well these guys are waiting for me
[51:49] let me go and join them and uh uh we
[51:53] right in the middle of the road I can't
[51:55] explain it I can't explain it but I will
[51:57] tell you I was there when it
[52:00] happened and I know this truth amen
[52:03] right in the middle of the road
[52:05] Something Turned me around I went right
[52:07] back to where that brother was preaching
[52:10] and my life has never been the
[52:12] same
[52:14] amen so then uh that was that would be
[52:17] two years or three years after when I
[52:20] started when I started
[52:23] preaching so uh we thank the Lord he
[52:26] been so good to us and uh we close our
[52:29] message on the key to the door this
[52:31] morning and uh and and br br ended that
[52:35] message I had to tell uh uh the team
[52:39] back there to go back to where he
[52:41] started the communion service and uh uh
[52:46] I I one the one one of the reason what I
[52:49] I wanted us to play that message is
[52:52] because uh uh I'm asking the Lord to to
[52:55] give me a key to ad door
[52:57] amen praise the Lord all it means is
[53:00] just an
[53:02] opportunity amen an opportunity to to be
[53:06] able to take the word to somebody to
[53:08] take the word to someplace praise the
[53:10] Lord so uh
[53:14] uh and about something he you know
[53:17] talking on communion there I was telling
[53:20] yesterday and and i i i b into
[53:23] something uh
[53:27] that
[53:29] uh I wanted to share with you while you
[53:33] remain in your seat let's take our Bible
[53:35] quickly and do a little bible study
[53:38] before we get into preaching this
[53:39] morning praise the Lord amen you love
[53:43] Bible
[53:44] studies
[53:49] amen I thought I thought about it that
[53:51] maybe next month uh uh uh or next year
[53:55] coming weekend we can start a kind of uh
[53:59] uh breakfast Bible studies maybe with
[54:01] the brothers or maybe with everybody
[54:03] amen maybe uh yeah we can we can start a
[54:07] breakfast Bible study but before I
[54:09] forget before I forget this is uh
[54:11] November happy birthday to all the
[54:13] lember people praise the Lord and we we
[54:16] pray that the Lord will will just bless
[54:19] you and keep you all in good health amen
[54:23] and this November we have uh uh brother
[54:26] Paul Fountain I think you saw if you
[54:28] were paying attention to to um um the
[54:32] things playing on the Prelude there
[54:34] brother Paul will be with us on the 16th
[54:37] of November uh uh originally we were
[54:40] going to have him we were planning to do
[54:43] a kind of a couple retreat or couple
[54:46] meeting or just something for couples
[54:49] and uh uh he and brother Barry had to
[54:51] fly to to uh
[54:54] Europe uh for the meeting Bar C so uh he
[54:59] asked me brother one can we change the
[55:01] Dee and I said well okay and uh uh good
[55:05] enough we did that because uh uh there
[55:08] there was a lot of changes around us and
[55:11] we couldn't just make proper planning so
[55:13] it was good that we allow him to go and
[55:16] they had a good meeting there in Euro so
[55:19] uh so when we talk he thought he would
[55:21] come in August and and yet yeah we
[55:24] couldn't get things I couldn't get
[55:25] things together in the way that is and
[55:28] you see and one of the reason why just
[55:30] like I said before uh we are a small
[55:32] group here and
[55:35] uh and uh uh all of our most of our
[55:39] visitors that comes through most of them
[55:42] and uh we have to fly them in you know
[55:45] people don't drive to Minnesota to go
[55:47] anywhere amen and uh uh even though you
[55:51] could go to kada but not many people go
[55:53] to kenada you know uh just driving in
[55:56] Drew so uh uh we have to fly them in and
[56:00] then uh making that Arrangement and uh
[56:03] you know and and all of that and then at
[56:06] the end of the day with the with our
[56:08] different schedule and we can get people
[56:11] you know to set uh the weekend aside for
[56:14] services is just uh uh sometimes it's
[56:17] not encouraging but yet it have stay now
[56:21] detau us from from bringing preachers
[56:23] because that's what the church needs
[56:25] amen our prayer is that God would just
[56:28] help us to be able to rise to the
[56:30] opportunity that uh uh when we you know
[56:34] have these meetings we will uh you know
[56:38] we will be able to you know uh uh make
[56:41] the sacrifice to come together I know
[56:44] many of you uh work on your schedule to
[56:47] be in church on Wednesday and on Sunday
[56:50] so making an extra change on the weekend
[56:54] uh you know uh sometimes times is uh is
[56:57] challenging but you also have to
[57:00] realize you know uh uh the church need
[57:03] all of these things you know uh uh we
[57:06] need the fire for Ministry we need uh
[57:09] you know to to as as as we grow together
[57:12] if not we would just be at Wednesday
[57:15] Sunday morning church because uh you
[57:17] know I we work hour scheduled is
[57:19] comfortable for us that way but as we
[57:23] grow we we we take on some
[57:27] challenges we take on some challenges
[57:30] many years ago we started having our our
[57:33] Memorial Day meetings and uh uh the Lord
[57:37] bless it for 5 years we enjoy it and
[57:40] then we decided okay we just we just
[57:42] keep it you know keep it low profile
[57:45] just do what we have to do in church and
[57:47] and and all of that but as we grow we
[57:51] want the Lord to to give us
[57:52] opportunities amen amen and uh uh so
[57:56] so so uh when brother Paul T he say well
[58:00] okay why why not I come around November
[58:02] I said okay maybe we can make that work
[58:04] and then uh uh we choose that weekend of
[58:08] the 16 he's also he's a basic guy I mean
[58:10] this this has been close to maybe four
[58:13] years we've been talking back and forth
[58:15] you know he want to come and visit we
[58:17] we'll bring him in and all of that but
[58:20] uh he's a busic guy so so we have it set
[58:23] for the 16 so I just thought okay why I
[58:26] throw something in there I spoke to him
[58:28] can we just do kind of a couple brunch
[58:31] and uh where we can just be able to
[58:34] encourage our couple so the 16 uh uh
[58:37] November 16 at 10:00 a.m. we'll be we'll
[58:40] have a couple brunch with uh brother
[58:42] Paula Fountain we send uh uh the flyer
[58:45] out to you many of you by text and like
[58:49] I said if you have any question ask me
[58:52] some of the reason I said that is
[58:54] because you know uh uh are we having you
[58:58] know some that that are here their wives
[59:00] are not here or their husband are not
[59:02] here and then you say well I mean it's
[59:04] coupled I can't go alone uh you know
[59:06] because uh uh I mean whether whether you
[59:09] are with your your spouse or not you
[59:11] stay a couple amen don't divide yourself
[59:14] you know uh don't uh uh create
[59:17] separation just because of a couple
[59:19] meeting amen you have to remember you
[59:22] got to keep their Union whether the
[59:23] person is overseas or wherever it is you
[59:26] know you got to keep the union so I
[59:28] always I always encourage people I
[59:30] remember we were down in July in uh uh
[59:33] DC doing a couple meeting Brother D and
[59:36] myself for the for the group up there
[59:38] and then uh uh you
[59:41] know so we got talking the same thing
[59:43] you know people were giving excuse I
[59:45] said what you know even me you know and
[59:48] look at even brother Deli he don't have
[59:50] his wife yet I don't have my wife yet
[59:52] you know so let's not cancel the couple
[59:54] meeting let's let's just go and enjoyed
[59:56] amen it's uh uh so yeah the uh but then
[1:00:00] also there's a price to it is $100 a
[1:00:03] couple so uh uh and we want to we want
[1:00:08] to make sure that uh uh we we you can
[1:00:12] pay it on the day if you want to if you
[1:00:15] want to pay earlier maybe you can give
[1:00:18] it to uh uh any of the trustees brother
[1:00:22] brother Stephen Steve CIT or brother Max
[1:00:26] you can give it to them and then then we
[1:00:27] put your name down and uh so okay let's
[1:00:32] uh that's that is it for the
[1:00:33] announcement any other thing we will
[1:00:36] continue to remind ourself as we go
[1:00:38] along praise the Lord I didn't want to
[1:00:40] forget about that and then uh he
[1:00:42] preached for us that evening and also on
[1:00:46] Sunday morning and I got a text from
[1:00:48] Brother Don Huffman uh this morning
[1:00:51] because I sent it over to them and and
[1:00:54] uh they're hoping to join us so we thank
[1:00:56] the Lord for
[1:00:57] that and uh so what what I wanted for us
[1:01:00] to look at here quickly before we uh we
[1:01:04] look into this is what that that caught
[1:01:06] my attention Acts chapter let's go to
[1:01:09] Acts chapter
[1:01:11] 2 let's go to Acts chapter 2 we we'll be
[1:01:14] reading from uh it say Acts chapter 2
[1:01:17] Acts chapter 3 Acts chapter 3 that's
[1:01:20] where caught my attention
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:28] Acts chapter 3 caught my attention verse
[1:01:31] one the Bible says now Peter and John
[1:01:34] went up together into the temple at the
[1:01:37] 9th uh at The Hour of Prayer being the
[1:01:42] ninth hour you remember it was that very
[1:01:45] same Hour of Prayer the ninth hour that
[1:01:47] colinus was praying when the angel
[1:01:50] visited colinus if you remember it was
[1:01:53] that same hour the ninth hour when the
[1:01:56] veill rented in the temple when Jesus
[1:01:58] gave up gave up the ghost so that caught
[1:02:01] by the tension what I was studying
[1:02:03] yesterday and I went looking what what
[1:02:06] is about this 9 hour the Bible uh uh uh
[1:02:10] keep lining it up for us there so I came
[1:02:14] I I got a little bit distracted like I
[1:02:19] said and then you realize that the 9
[1:02:23] hour uh in the Bible is 300
[1:02:27] p.m. the 9 hour in the Bible is Hour 3
[1:02:32] p.m. praise the Lord
[1:02:35] amen and it turned out to be that is uh
[1:02:38] in some way is very
[1:02:40] significant Jesus died on the cross like
[1:02:42] I said it was around the 9th hour the
[1:02:45] Bible says he gave up the ghost be uh
[1:02:47] and joy perform their first miracle at
[1:02:50] Pentecost it was the N9 hour colus uh
[1:02:53] you know was met it was around the 9
[1:02:56] hour now so as I was looking at that I
[1:03:00] got I got confused
[1:03:03] between the the ninth hour or the hours
[1:03:07] of the day and the
[1:03:10] watch the Bible talks about the first
[1:03:13] watch the second watch and uh uh the
[1:03:17] thir watch and it also talks about the
[1:03:20] hour of the day so I got confused so I
[1:03:24] went you know and then I I I drew a
[1:03:26] clock on my little paper I you know put
[1:03:29] the time and I started calculating I man
[1:03:33] I couldn't get it right I just something
[1:03:36] something just missing
[1:03:38] here God bless you brother Moses how are
[1:03:42] you good to see you bro good to see you
[1:03:46] good friend good to see you now so I I
[1:03:49] just I just got a little bit uh so that
[1:03:51] I decided that well I need to I need to
[1:03:53] get this down I'm going to leave
[1:03:54] everything I'm doing need to get this
[1:03:56] down now the reason why just like I said
[1:04:02] I will I will tip end it this morning on
[1:04:04] on on
[1:04:06] communion and uh the reason why because
[1:04:09] uh we can apply it to communion in the
[1:04:13] sense
[1:04:14] that uh
[1:04:16] uh when we when we think about the time
[1:04:19] in the Bible the Bible says uh Paul says
[1:04:24] uh uh that is evening you know in
[1:04:27] Corinthian he says that evening Jesus
[1:04:29] Took bread and break it that's what it's
[1:04:31] called The Lord's Supper it was never
[1:04:33] done in the
[1:04:34] morning now in our term in our language
[1:04:39] when we talk about eing we look up to
[1:04:43] 6:00
[1:04:45] p.m. praise the Lord you you take Bible
[1:04:49] term is different if you remember we
[1:04:52] spoke on a year uh before uh between two
[1:04:56] evenings I'm not going to take a lot of
[1:04:59] time on that uh but it it grabed my mind
[1:05:02] the ninth hour grab my mind and looking
[1:05:05] into the N9 hour all of this came out so
[1:05:08] I just thought I would do a review with
[1:05:09] you quickly before we go into what we
[1:05:11] want to talk about so uh uh Genesis
[1:05:15] chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 let's go
[1:05:18] there quickly we're just doing a little
[1:05:21] bible study like I said uh uh uh
[1:05:31] amen Genesis chapter 1 verse5 and and
[1:05:36] and and God called the light day and the
[1:05:39] night he called night the evening and
[1:05:43] the morning were the first day so in the
[1:05:46] Jewish calendar their day begins from
[1:05:49] the
[1:05:51] evening so the first
[1:05:54] watch the first watch starts from 6:00
[1:05:58] p.m. in the Jewish
[1:06:01] calendar are we together
[1:06:05] amen this the first watch is from 6:00
[1:06:09] p.m. to 9900 p.m. that's the first watch
[1:06:14] it ties in with the
[1:06:15] scripture the evening and the morning
[1:06:18] was the first day it tie in with the
[1:06:22] church ages God bring his messenger at
[1:06:25] the evening time and he takes the church
[1:06:28] through the night through the darkness
[1:06:32] to the break of a new day to a new
[1:06:36] age so the Jewish watch starts from the
[1:06:40] evening you hear the first watch it
[1:06:41] start from 700 p.m. to 900 p.m. that's
[1:06:44] the first watch second watch from 900
[1:06:47] p.m. to 12 and the Third Watch from 12
[1:06:49] to 300 a.m. and and the fourth was you
[1:06:52] know just just like that 3 hours between
[1:06:54] that's how the Jewish time
[1:06:57] starts are we
[1:07:00] together
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] but the
[1:07:09] hour
[1:07:11] changes when the Bible talks about the
[1:07:14] ninth hour now that's where most of the
[1:07:17] time we uh you know we the first
[1:07:24] hour comes from
[1:07:27] Sunrise that's from Sunrise that uh uh
[1:07:31] from from from uh 6 a.m. to 900 a.m.
[1:07:36] that's the first hour of the
[1:07:40] day then the third hour of the
[1:07:44] day praise the Lord they go the first
[1:07:47] the third the sixth and the
[1:07:51] nth praise the Lord are we together now
[1:07:55] because if you don't if you don't place
[1:07:57] it together rightly you will miss it you
[1:08:00] see that is the reason why most of the
[1:08:04] time when people are interpreting
[1:08:07] prophecy if you take a Biblical prophecy
[1:08:11] and put it on our Gentile you have to
[1:08:14] know our calander that we are using is a
[1:08:18] is is is a is a Roman Calendar it's not
[1:08:21] a Jewish calendar if you take biblical
[1:08:24] prophecy and put it on the Roman
[1:08:27] Calendar you will get your date and time
[1:08:32] wrong are we together so the the the the
[1:08:37] the the first hour of the day is from
[1:08:39] sunrise to 9900 a.m. and then the third
[1:08:42] hour is from 9:00 a.m. to noon the 6th
[1:08:45] hour of the day you you remember in the
[1:08:48] Bible the Bible says when it was the
[1:08:50] sixth hour of the day it was complete
[1:08:52] darkness when Jesus was on the cross the
[1:08:55] 6 hour hour it was complete darkness now
[1:08:58] if you want to take it to our time you
[1:09:01] would think it was 6:00
[1:09:02] p.m. no it was 12
[1:09:05] no that's the reason why it was
[1:09:12] noticeable amen so from the sixth hour
[1:09:16] of the day to the 9th hour it was
[1:09:19] complete
[1:09:21] darkness and at the 9th hour the ve in
[1:09:24] the temple rented when he ye out the
[1:09:27] ghost uh uh uh uh the the vill rented
[1:09:30] now
[1:09:31] so so you see and uh if you if you apply
[1:09:36] it to communion time you will realize
[1:09:39] that because many times many times like
[1:09:43] I said we run our mind in in in Jewish
[1:09:46] in in Gentile
[1:09:48] timing praise the Lord amen and and and
[1:09:52] and then it stumbles some people you
[1:09:55] know while the Bible says in the evening
[1:09:57] why why are you doing communion in the
[1:09:59] afternoon but you really bring it to
[1:10:01] biblical timing evening starts from 300
[1:10:05] p.m. from 300 p.m. to 6:00 is the first
[1:10:08] evening from 6:00 to 99 is the second
[1:10:13] evening so it's always between the two
[1:10:17] evenings are we together amen
[1:10:22] amen if you have any question write it
[1:10:25] down
[1:10:26] and send it to me amen write it down
[1:10:28] give it to the deons we will readdress
[1:10:30] it because I feel you are
[1:10:33] pulling and I I just end up preaching on
[1:10:37] time amen and I did not stud it enough
[1:10:41] to preach on time so you keep pulling I
[1:10:44] will not preach my message this morning
[1:10:47] but that that caught my attention so as
[1:10:50] uh as we're closing up on that communion
[1:10:53] thing this morning I just thought okay
[1:10:55] it's a good opportunity for me to for me
[1:10:57] to bring that and remind you you know
[1:11:00] well that that is the first evening
[1:11:04] there is according to Jewish time are we
[1:11:08] together amen Jesus says let's work
[1:11:13] while it is
[1:11:14] day the night cometh when no man
[1:11:18] WTH praise the Lord amen yeah so uh so
[1:11:24] that's that is that is that is the
[1:11:26] Jewish timing now you have to you have
[1:11:28] to understand when the people went to
[1:11:31] Egypt their timing was changed that's
[1:11:34] the reason why in Exodus chapter 12 God
[1:11:37] have to tell them this will become the
[1:11:39] beginning of
[1:11:42] months why God was trying to bring them
[1:11:45] out of the Egyptian calendar and the
[1:11:49] Egyptian
[1:11:51] time to his
[1:11:53] time and his
[1:11:58] landed so he says this man this man will
[1:12:02] begin the beginning of months for
[1:12:05] you as you are going out of Egypt your
[1:12:08] year will begin from
[1:12:10] now and that's the reason why Israel
[1:12:14] have two different
[1:12:16] calendar
[1:12:18] amen they having two different
[1:12:23] calendar so that is that is for your
[1:12:27] information whatever you do with it may
[1:12:30] the Lord bless you amen let's stand on
[1:12:32] our feet and read the word
[1:12:34] [Laughter]
[1:12:37] amen praise the
[1:12:42] Lord amen

[1:12:47] Lord this

[1:25:13] name I make a
[1:25:15] name like one of the great men out of
[1:25:17] the earth let's read one of the favorite
[1:25:20] chapter that's where I got caught up in
[1:25:21] the book of Acts here the Acts chapter
[1:25:23] 4:2 Earth where the Bible says there is
[1:25:26] no name given under
[1:25:28] heaven whereby we can be
[1:25:31] saved there is no
[1:25:34] name amen that's Acts
[1:25:37] 4:12 neither is there salvation in any
[1:25:43] other praise the
[1:25:46] Lord neither is there salvation in the
[1:25:50] church there is not salvation in uh in
[1:25:53] in in a message there is not salvation
[1:25:56] in a preacher in our parent there is not
[1:25:59] salvation in any other nothing can
[1:26:04] save praise the Lord neither is there
[1:26:08] salvation in any other for for there is
[1:26:14] none other name under
[1:26:18] Heaven under Heaven the Bible have a
[1:26:23] reason why it's here is that there is no
[1:26:26] other name under
[1:26:29] Heaven it means there all Mighty God the
[1:26:33] creator of Heaven and Earth he had to
[1:26:36] leave his
[1:26:38] throne and step down on Earth and pick
[1:26:42] up a human name and pick up a name that
[1:26:47] was
[1:26:48] common as we will soon find out under
[1:26:52] Heaven There is no need
[1:26:54] under
[1:26:56] Heaven many men try to look for
[1:27:01] names when Hitler Carri his Carri out
[1:27:04] his Revolution he was looking for the
[1:27:06] name among his
[1:27:09] people his name now has become a bad
[1:27:12] word the German don't want you say that
[1:27:14] to
[1:27:19] them when Meson did the same he was
[1:27:23] looking for the name
[1:27:28] praise the
[1:27:29] Lord
[1:27:35] hallelujah there's no name on the
[1:27:39] heaven amen the reason there is that you
[1:27:43] will
[1:27:44] realize there were many
[1:27:47] people that was named the name of Jesus
[1:27:50] even in the time of Jesus the Bible
[1:27:52] recorded that
[1:27:55] what would surprise you is that
[1:27:59] Barabas his complete name was Jesus
[1:28:05] Barabas that was his complete
[1:28:08] name Jesus Barabas the reason there is
[1:28:12] because the name Jesus was h a common
[1:28:16] name for Jewish parents to give to their
[1:28:20] children it means uh uh uh uh yusha
[1:28:24] Joshua that's what it
[1:28:26] means Jehovah's
[1:28:29] savior so many parents gave their
[1:28:32] children the name
[1:28:37] Jesus according to history year uh uh uh
[1:28:42] Jesus Barabas there was
[1:28:46] Jesus then ananas and Jesus Ben
[1:28:52] serup these were all all names that were
[1:28:57] given
[1:28:59] to their
[1:29:02] children Acts chapter 13:6 the Bible
[1:29:05] recorded of one by
[1:29:08] Jesus and that that name by Jesus mean
[1:29:12] the son of Jonas or the son of Joshua
[1:29:16] sorry it means the son of
[1:29:19] Joshua are we together
[1:29:25] how
[1:29:26] many children called
[1:29:32] Jesus Jesus
[1:29:34] Barabas you know this that that's it's
[1:29:37] it's very very interesting because when
[1:29:39] many people Bible read or think about
[1:29:44] Barabas we we think about him many times
[1:29:48] in the wrong way but when you check
[1:29:51] history you will realize many history
[1:29:55] turned to believe that Barabas became a
[1:30:00] Christian after he realized that a man
[1:30:03] took his
[1:30:05] place praise the Lord as much shall we
[1:30:09] as we were not like the name of Barabas
[1:30:12] if Jesus Took Barabas place that was the
[1:30:15] same thing that he did for you and
[1:30:16] myself so we are all Barabas you better
[1:30:20] start loving
[1:30:22] Barabas we are
[1:30:29] Barabas according to the Bible Mark
[1:30:33] chapter 15: 7 the bible says Barabas
[1:30:37] Carri on an Insurrection according to
[1:30:40] history he killed a Roman
[1:30:44] soldier and the reason why he did that
[1:30:47] it was because he was defending the Jews
[1:30:52] he never believed that this Romans must
[1:30:54] have power over them most of the time we
[1:30:57] think about barbas we think about him
[1:30:59] being oh a criminal he's a thief in all
[1:31:01] of that but actually the only account we
[1:31:04] have in the Bible Mark chapter 15 tells
[1:31:06] us that it was because of an
[1:31:09] Insurrection and you check in history it
[1:31:12] tells you that uh
[1:31:16] Barabas a volunteer revolutionary who
[1:31:19] led an attack on the Roman uh
[1:31:22] insallation
[1:31:24] he was a popular figure because the Jews
[1:31:27] hated the Roman
[1:31:29] occupation his full name was Jesus
[1:31:32] Barabas which mean Jesus Son of the
[1:31:37] [Laughter]
[1:31:39] father Jesus Son of the
[1:31:48] father
[1:31:51] ah glory be to God
[1:32:00] Hallelujah he Carri on and attack and
[1:32:02] that's the reason why when you when you
[1:32:04] hear the people says give us Barabas it
[1:32:08] was because it was in the paper that he
[1:32:10] killed a Roman
[1:32:12] soldier so they healed him for
[1:32:19] that praise the
[1:32:22] Lord to him to them he was their hero
[1:32:26] all of these Romans they are beating us
[1:32:28] and he was Brave to go out there and and
[1:32:30] and and kill one Roman
[1:32:33] siia praise the
[1:32:35] Lord they healed him that was the very
[1:32:38] same thing those Hebrews should have
[1:32:40] done to Moses when Moses stood out there
[1:32:42] and killed that Egyptian they should
[1:32:44] have realized that this man is on our
[1:32:47] side but it turned against
[1:32:52] him and out of fear Moses had to run in
[1:32:55] the
[1:32:58] wilderness but you have to realize that
[1:33:01] that H prophecy is greater than
[1:33:06] politics amen praise the
[1:33:10] Lord the the the the Jews were playing
[1:33:13] into politics but God has something the
[1:33:16] Bible that's the reason why caras had to
[1:33:19] prophesy that one man
[1:33:25] according to our Lord he quoted that
[1:33:27] right before the jury right before pilot
[1:33:29] according to our Lord woman have to
[1:33:34] die and they thought that they were
[1:33:36] hating this man they they just thought
[1:33:38] that they rejected this man but you see
[1:33:40] everything was plain in the hands of
[1:33:42] Jehovah everything was plain in almighty
[1:33:45] God hands why because in his hand he was
[1:33:47] thinking about bringing the gentile
[1:33:49] people into the Plan of Redemption
[1:34:01] glory be to
[1:34:03] God you love the
[1:34:07] Lord that's the reason why the Bible
[1:34:10] says no other name under Heaven because
[1:34:14] the name that God will have taken Among
[1:34:17] Us was not going to be an extraordinary
[1:34:20] name he was going to take one name that
[1:34:23] was so common but he will make that name
[1:34:27] because he's a maker and a giver of name
[1:34:31] he will make thy name that are the
[1:34:33] mention of thy name every knee will bind
[1:34:36] and every tongue will
[1:34:38] confess he will make that name and
[1:34:41] that's what Paul talk about in The Book
[1:34:43] of Ephesian I mean
[1:34:46] Philippian let's go to the book of
[1:34:49] Philippian praise the Lord Philippians
[1:34:52] chapter 2
[1:34:57] oh praise the
[1:34:58] Lord
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:10] amen in Philippians chapter
[1:35:18] 2 verse five let this mind be in you
[1:35:21] which was in Christ Jesus who being in a
[1:35:24] form of God taught it not robbery to be
[1:35:27] equal with God but made himself of no
[1:35:30] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:35:33] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:35:35] of men God becoming man God wearing his
[1:35:40] own brand name praise the
[1:35:43] Lord amen he make
[1:35:47] man glory be to
[1:35:49] God and he's sitting
[1:35:52] down and and driving the very car that
[1:35:55] he
[1:35:56] made praise the
[1:35:58] Lord he made man and he can take one and
[1:36:02] dress himself in it why should it be
[1:36:05] difficult for people to believe that
[1:36:06] Jesus is
[1:36:11] God praise the Lord if he can make man
[1:36:14] can he become
[1:36:22] one I we to
[1:36:26] together but made himself of no
[1:36:28] reputation took upon him the form of a
[1:36:31] seven and was made in the likeness of
[1:36:33] man and being
[1:36:35] formed in faction as a man faction brand
[1:36:40] name he humbled himself and became
[1:36:43] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:36:46] the Cross where for God Amen God the
[1:36:51] spirit that was wearing the
[1:36:54] flesh wherefore God also have highly
[1:36:58] exalted him and given him a
[1:37:04] name praise the Lord a name that was
[1:37:09] common but he made that name how did he
[1:37:12] made it come Paul coming to tell us how
[1:37:15] he made the name to give it to
[1:37:20] him giving him a name which is above
[1:37:22] every name
[1:37:26] praise the
[1:37:29] Lord the name was
[1:37:32] made through the death of the Cross
[1:37:35] humbled himself became obedient unto
[1:37:38] death even the death of the Cross that's
[1:37:40] how the name was made that's how God
[1:37:43] made that name he took a
[1:37:48] man praise the
[1:37:50] Lord and put the sin of the word on
[1:37:57] him Paul will says in uh in uh in in in
[1:38:01] Hebrew Jesus learned obedience by the
[1:38:05] many things he
[1:38:09] suffer God was making a name out of
[1:38:13] him are we
[1:38:15] together listen to what Paul says here
[1:38:18] let's go on a little bit that at the
[1:38:21] name of Jesus every knee shall bow of
[1:38:23] things in heaven and things in Earth and
[1:38:27] all things on the earth and that every
[1:38:31] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:38:34] is what Jesus Christ is
[1:38:39] Lord amen that Jesus Christ is Lord that
[1:38:45] word Lord goes back to the Jewish word
[1:38:49] which means Adon it goes back to the
[1:38:53] word the unpronouncable name of
[1:38:57] God Amen that's what it goes back
[1:39:01] to so what Paul is saying
[1:39:05] here that you will see Peter said the
[1:39:08] same thing in the book of Acts this
[1:39:10] Jesus that you have God have made him
[1:39:13] both Lord and
[1:39:17] Christ praise the Lord now so let's
[1:39:21] let's uh let's let's let's just
[1:39:24] uh uh uh go on here so you you see here
[1:39:27] it was a
[1:39:29] name that name uh uh it's it's uh it's
[1:39:33] uh the Jews would call
[1:39:36] it Jehovah that's uh we called it
[1:39:38] Jehovah we you know uh through the Greek
[1:39:42] we call it Jehovah but uh the Jewish
[1:39:45] pronoun pronunciation is yahovah ye e h
[1:39:49] o v a h and what they did was uh they
[1:39:52] took some vows to put it in between the
[1:39:56] unpronouncable name to be able to give
[1:39:58] it a
[1:40:00] word because the unpronouncable name is
[1:40:03] YH
[1:40:06] VH so the Greek now put some vows letter
[1:40:10] between it so we can give it a
[1:40:12] pronunciation just to give it a
[1:40:14] pronunciation are we together but that
[1:40:17] means
[1:40:20] Lord you will realize there the uh uh uh
[1:40:24] uh uh the the the the the the Roman they
[1:40:29] called the seus
[1:40:33] Lord and they do
[1:40:36] that praise the Lord that's the same
[1:40:39] thing the Catholic Church have adopted
[1:40:41] to their popes but they do that whenever
[1:40:46] they believe that a man has attained
[1:40:50] onto deity or divinity
[1:40:53] they call him Lord praise the Lord now
[1:40:58] so uh uh uh there were there were there
[1:41:01] were call you know Cesar Lord and all of
[1:41:04] that and in the early in the in the
[1:41:07] early
[1:41:10] church the Christians struggle with that
[1:41:14] or they struggle with the Christians on
[1:41:16] that because the Christian were not
[1:41:17] called Caesar
[1:41:18] Lord and many of them was killed for
[1:41:21] that
[1:41:23] praise the Lord because they knew that
[1:41:27] this man Jesus God have exalted him to
[1:41:30] be both Lord and Christ so they were not
[1:41:34] going to give that lordship to any man
[1:41:38] are we
[1:41:40] together now so the early Christians
[1:41:43] made their confession Jesus is
[1:41:46] Lord and they actually confess that that
[1:41:49] that Jesus of Nazareth is the god of
[1:41:52] Israel Jehovah over the one true God
[1:41:55] praise the Lord so you see it is not
[1:41:59] just that it means that Jesus is Lord it
[1:42:05] means that he's my
[1:42:09] Lord just saying that Jesus is Lord is
[1:42:14] not a better
[1:42:16] identification
[1:42:17] amen now you have to realize look at the
[1:42:20] resurrection when Jesus appeared to Mary
[1:42:24] what does she said oh my Lord my God
[1:42:27] they seemed to
[1:42:30] Thomas he said my Lord my God so you see
[1:42:34] it's it is it is that place of uh uh H H
[1:42:38] identification is that place of what a
[1:42:41] person is is is is is personifying this
[1:42:44] thing to
[1:42:45] thems it's not just enough to say Jesus
[1:42:48] is
[1:42:50] Lord it must be his my Lord
[1:42:53] God he's my
[1:42:56] God praise the Lord so we see this that
[1:43:01] uh uh he's The Giver of names he's the
[1:43:04] maker of names if God Don't Make your
[1:43:10] name as soon as you go we don't miss
[1:43:14] you let me say it that way when God
[1:43:17] Don't Make your name when you go the
[1:43:20] people don't miss you
[1:43:24] praise the Lord because you have to
[1:43:26] remember if you are called Susan
[1:43:29] somebody will be called
[1:43:31] Susanna praise the Lord what will make
[1:43:35] us to relate the reason why we can talk
[1:43:40] about Susanna when we say Susanna the
[1:43:43] first person that we think about is
[1:43:45] Susanna
[1:43:47] Wesley why because God gave her a name
[1:43:51] with the character of bringing her of
[1:43:53] her children she was able to give us two
[1:43:56] of the the world best people John Wesley
[1:43:59] as a preacher in his brother as a
[1:44:03] singer and because of John Wesley we can
[1:44:07] never forget about Susanna
[1:44:10] Wesley praise the Lord God gave her a
[1:44:18] name because she's a woman that has 17
[1:44:22] children
[1:44:25] praise the
[1:44:26] Lord and she taught them right on on her
[1:44:29] kitchen
[1:44:32] floor praise the Lord and every one of
[1:44:35] them knew when Mama was praying she took
[1:44:38] her apron and she just cover her face
[1:44:41] and all of those children sit there
[1:44:43] quietly because they knew mama was
[1:44:47] praying God gave her a name
[1:44:53] you can fight and strumble for the name
[1:44:55] that you want if God don't give it pass
[1:44:59] away that's not you go we don't miss
[1:45:05] you we love you though but we don't miss
[1:45:12] you praise the
[1:45:15] Lord I don't mean to sound harsh but I'm
[1:45:17] trying to drive this thing
[1:45:19] home amen because that is the thing that
[1:45:22] is that is in the
[1:45:24] society that's the thing that is in the
[1:45:26] society all of these uh H H social media
[1:45:29] things and people looking for name they
[1:45:31] are posing things and then and then
[1:45:33] other people young people want to be

[1:47:36] Shadow when you can come in the light of
[1:47:39] God and say Lord yeah here am
[1:47:48] I are we
[1:47:51] together you love the Lord
[1:47:54] Lord let's go to the Book of
[1:47:56] Genesis let's see God was The Giver of
[1:47:59] names now you read Genesis chapter
[1:48:02] 1 it tells you that God made man in his
[1:48:06] uh image in the likeness uh uh Genesis
[1:48:10] 1:26 and you make Man In His Image and
[1:48:12] his likeness you know in male and female
[1:48:15] and In His Image created he them and he
[1:48:18] blessed them and said be fruitful the
[1:48:20] Bible never talks about their name
[1:48:24] praise the
[1:48:25] Lord you have to realize that when Moses
[1:48:28] wrote this thing Moses was uh writing a
[1:48:32] vision so you see the Bible if you
[1:48:36] realize he did not say it in chapter one
[1:48:40] he said it in chapter
[1:48:43] five so as he was writing the vision he
[1:48:46] realize oh I did not write this one let
[1:48:48] me let me go back
[1:48:52] because it's a vision Moses is not
[1:48:55] writing his own story he's not making it
[1:48:58] up praise the Lord so in in in chapter
[1:49:02] one he talk about creating man in the
[1:49:04] image of God and in his
[1:49:06] likeness but then it's in chapter
[1:49:09] five let's read chapter
[1:49:14] five praise the
[1:49:17] Lord chapter 5 verse one two then this
[1:49:20] is the book of the generation of Adam in
[1:49:23] the day that God created man so you see
[1:49:26] he's connecting this now he finishing up
[1:49:28] the story he gave us a little bit there
[1:49:30] but he finishing up the story you have
[1:49:32] to know it's a
[1:49:33] vision a vision is almost just like
[1:49:36] dream you are dreaming and now you in
[1:49:38] church before you realize you to the mod
[1:49:40] of
[1:49:41] America now what happened how did you
[1:49:43] get to the mod of America you can't
[1:49:45] connect it and before you realize you
[1:49:47] you see yourself again right in
[1:49:49] Bloomington so okay I was just to the
[1:49:51] church mod of America no maybe I got to
[1:49:53] Bloomington before I got to the m of
[1:49:55] America so you see it's a vision he's
[1:49:57] giv
[1:50:01] us he's trying to fill in to make the
[1:50:05] story right in the day that God created
[1:50:10] man this is the generation of Adam in
[1:50:13] the day that God created man in his life
[1:50:16] in the likeness of God created he him
[1:50:20] male and female created him them that
[1:50:22] that's the same thing that Genesis 1
[1:50:24] said are we
[1:50:26] together are we together are we together
[1:50:31] praise the Lord I think you're more
[1:50:33] writing and listening to me but it's
[1:50:36] good I think I got you to a place this
[1:50:38] morning we can close and go home and I
[1:50:41] can pick up next
[1:50:43] week male and female Creator he them and
[1:50:46] blessed them and call their
[1:50:49] names
[1:50:50] Adam in the day that they were created
[1:50:54] so this name was given right in Genesis
[1:51:01] 1:26 so when God made man then he gave
[1:51:05] him a name he's the maker and The Giver
[1:51:09] of
[1:51:10] name when he made man he gave him a
[1:51:17] name are we together praise the Lord
[1:51:21] Genesis chapter 2
[1:51:24] we just finished reading chapter one
[1:51:26] let's go back to chapter
[1:51:28] 2 so you see how chapter one and chapter
[1:51:31] 5 is connected chapter 5 is finishing up
[1:51:34] chapter one Genesis chapter 2 are we
[1:51:38] together praise the Lord verse
[1:51:40] 20 Genesis chapter 2:20 we do all the
[1:51:44] Bible reading then next time we preach
[1:51:48] amen verse 20 and Adam gave names
[1:51:53] to all
[1:51:54] cattles
[1:51:56] and to the fowls of the A and the beasts
[1:52:00] of the field but for Adam there was not
[1:52:04] found a helpmate for him so he couldn't
[1:52:07] name he named everything he couldn't
[1:52:09] give name to a
[1:52:11] helpmate are we
[1:52:15] together Genesis uh let's read verse 23
[1:52:18] the same chapter and Adam said this is

[2:20:52] in my
[2:20:53] travel you usually find great men and
[2:20:57] little men I go around where they are
[2:21:00] great men really great men and I know
[2:21:05] they are great men but when I start to
[2:21:09] leave them they make you think you are
[2:21:17] great they make you think you are great
[2:21:22] what is
[2:21:24] that it's
[2:21:28] character you know what it it everything
[2:21:31] they own they don't attach it to their
[2:21:33] personality it don't stick with
[2:21:41] them they don't stick with
[2:21:43] them the people that don't have nothing
[2:21:46] they are the one as soon as they start
[2:21:47] talking to you they want to tell you
[2:21:49] what they just spend money to
[2:21:51] buy what they they have just SP money to
[2:21:57] buy and soon they ready to tell you
[2:21:59] about this and about that about this and
[2:22:01] about
[2:22:03] that that's
[2:22:08] greatness when you have an attitude
[2:22:11] where people can feel welcome into your
[2:22:15] presence they are not
[2:22:18] intimidated you don't carry yourself so
[2:22:21] special that it have to come around the
[2:22:23] block go back again say I don't know
[2:22:39] no are we
[2:22:45] together but when I start to leave they
[2:22:47] make you to think you are great they are
[2:22:50] nothing but you
[2:22:52] take a little
[2:22:55] 2x4 don't know nothing he thinks he's
[2:22:59] all of
[2:23:00] it he had nothing to begin
[2:23:03] with it's great
[2:23:05] men a little man they never break or
[2:23:09] take honor they make you
[2:23:12] feel you are great that's
[2:23:17] greatness that's greatness
[2:23:20] to be able that's the reason why the
[2:23:23] church is making a poor example that's
[2:23:27] why we can win people to Christ because
[2:23:31] the way we carry ourself there is no way
[2:23:34] to
[2:23:36] relate there is no way to relate we
[2:23:40] having too much of a sense of
[2:23:48] rejection him can sense it
[2:23:51] people can sense it when they come in
[2:23:54] your
[2:23:57] presence that's why the church is making
[2:23:59] the poor
[2:24:02] example because we are quick to
[2:24:07] condemn quick to condemn we cause the
[2:24:09] damage before we start looking for
[2:24:11] repair
[2:24:20] you know that Paul told us to be wise as
[2:24:24] sein harmless as
[2:24:26] do we got to keep our spiritual guide up
[2:24:30] don't just give yourself to people
[2:24:33] giving yourself to them for what you
[2:24:35] must have a
[2:24:36] purpose you must have what you want to
[2:24:39] achieve don't just be silly with people
[2:24:43] just laughing laughing about everything
[2:24:44] what you laughing for nobody know
[2:24:46] everything is funny
[2:24:53] when they even talking about things that
[2:24:54] is against
[2:24:57] you why you dress like that then you
[2:24:59] laugh what is
[2:25:10] funny and because of that we we get on
[2:25:13] us so much pressure then we turn now to
[2:25:16] start dressing like them and behaving
[2:25:18] because we we get on so much
[2:25:20] pressure we don't want them to criticize
[2:25:23] or we don't want them to think that we
[2:25:24] are this then now you have to start
[2:25:26] dressing like them exposing
[2:25:29] yourself wearing things that are not
[2:25:31] decent enough when you supposed to be an
[2:25:41] example are we
[2:25:44] together oh
[2:25:49] my and we have preached the whole thing
[2:25:51] here
[2:25:52] now pretty much said everything I can
[2:25:55] allow you to go
[2:25:58] home he talks about how the the name of
[2:26:01] Jesus was just like the the rock that
[2:26:03] Moses
[2:26:05] had instead of the Egyptian challenging
[2:26:08] him and throwing their rug down they
[2:26:10] should have just collected that thing
[2:26:11] from
[2:26:13] Moses praise the Lord that's what
[2:26:15] Pharaoh should have done take it from
[2:26:17] him when he throw it down he say oh that
[2:26:19] all you have come come throw your own
[2:26:22] down praise the
[2:26:25] Lord his Rod swallowed their own they
[2:26:28] still did not have sense to take it from
[2:26:32] him they allow him to leave the palace
[2:26:35] with
[2:26:36] it and brother B says that's how the
[2:26:38] name of Jesus is with the
[2:26:42] church amen we call the name of Jesus we
[2:26:46] name the name of Jesus but we not having
[2:26:48] the effect why
[2:26:54] praise the
[2:26:56] Lord because it's just like the Jesus of
[2:26:59] Barabas and the Jesus of ananas and all
[2:27:01] of the one that were living
[2:27:07] there see that's that's the reason why
[2:27:09] those Jews will say is this not Jesus we
[2:27:12] know his brothers we know his sister is
[2:27:14] it not Solomon is it not J's brother and
[2:27:16] all of that because it was just a common
[2:27:18] name
[2:27:27] but it's the life behind the name that
[2:27:30] makes the difference is the life that is
[2:27:32] behind the
[2:27:36] name praise the
[2:27:39] Lord and from the day that you were born
[2:27:43] God start working on you he start making
[2:27:46] a
[2:27:47] name making a name by the things that he
[2:27:50] takes you
[2:27:52] through then one day he gots your
[2:27:54] attention to his word and he make you to
[2:27:57] tremble to his word he makes his word to
[2:28:00] attract
[2:28:03] you and then when you read his word you
[2:28:05] can see yourself in Joseph you can see
[2:28:08] yourself in Daniel you can see yourself
[2:28:10] in the three Hebrew Boys by all the
[2:28:12] things that you are going
[2:28:15] through he's making a
[2:28:18] name he's making a name for a
[2:28:22] moment and don't miss
[2:28:25] it because there will be a moment in
[2:28:27] your
[2:28:28] life where he will want that name to
[2:28:31] stand he will want that name to
[2:28:33] represent him there will be a moment in
[2:28:37] your life I don't know when I don't
[2:28:41] know but he brings you through all of
[2:28:43] these
[2:28:46] things right behind whatever name they
[2:28:49] call
[2:28:50] you the Life of Christ is behind that
[2:28:53] name waiting for an opportunity that God
[2:28:57] will glorify
[2:29:06] himself praise the
[2:29:09] Lord
[2:29:13] hallelujah want to make your own name
[2:29:15] try your
[2:29:17] best see how it ends
[2:29:21] amen see where it will end

[2:29:30] a whole lot
[2:29:32] here just a whole lot
[2:29:36] here let's just read 1 Samuel chapter 12
[2:29:39] I got to find a place to
[2:29:41] close because we can go on and on and on
[2:29:44] let's find a place to close here 1
[2:29:46] Samuel chapter 12 I'm going to read here
[2:29:49] when Israel rejected
[2:29:53] Samuel praise the
[2:29:55] Lord 1 Samuel chapter

[2:30:38] doubt they are
[2:30:40] men that God has blessed in this

[2:30:52] to God they were able to give a life of
[2:30:54] Consecration and Devotion to God God has
[2:30:58] blessed

[2:33:27] memorial where do we find the
[2:33:29] Fulfillment of of
[2:33:32] Life what are the thing that brings us
[2:33:35] the most
[2:33:40] pleasure Samia talking to these people
[2:33:43] they rejected this man that God set over
[2:33:46] them he says after you have done all of
[2:33:48] these things I'm telling you children

[2:34:56] his great name sake praise the Lord just
[2:35:00] like I've always said
[2:35:03] amen and as much as God needs you to
[2:35:08] help this assembly he can do without
[2:35:11] you if you are not here we stay have
[2:35:14] church
[2:35:19] because it is his
[2:35:22] name it's his
[2:35:25] name and even with whatever name we have
[2:35:27] is God that attached the reputation of
[2:35:31] his name to our life to call you a son
[2:35:34] to call you a daughter he's attaching
[2:35:37] his reputation
[2:35:52] he's the makeer of names
[2:35:57] people after Jacob went through all his
[2:36:01] struggle after he went through all his
[2:36:03] struggle this young man came to the
[2:36:05] place and
[2:36:06] realized I tried to fight this I fast
[2:36:09] against it I prayed against
[2:36:14] it he needed no effort to
[2:36:17] lie he don't strugle
[2:36:20] to it was it could just flow
[2:36:23] out even when he tried his best and say
[2:36:26] I will not do
[2:36:28] it it will just come
[2:36:31] out he will get mad with himself oh my
[2:36:34] goodness oh man
[2:36:37] Jacob praise the
[2:36:41] Lord but one day he met
[2:36:45] God praise the Lord he met God one
[2:36:48] evening time
[2:36:53] and his life was never the
[2:36:58] same praise the Lord his life was never
[2:37:02] the
[2:37:04] same you realize in the Bible you read
[2:37:06] over and over the Bible in used the name
[2:37:10] Jacob and
[2:37:12] Israel and in most cases it will use
[2:37:15] Jacob when he talking about something
[2:37:18] that is not right
[2:37:20] so it referred to th own
[2:37:25] nature praise the
[2:37:27] Lord
[2:37:29] amen let's look at something here in the
[2:37:31] book of Acts we try to wind up
[2:37:35] here glory be to God you love the
[2:37:42] Lord oh sweet Jesus
[2:37:51] what a wonderful
[2:37:52] Jesus Acts chapter
[2:37:58] 13 Acts chapter
[2:38:14] 13 Acts chapter 13 let's read from verse
[2:38:17] one now there were in the church that
[2:38:21] was at anti setting prophets and
[2:38:25] teacher as as Barnabas and and and Simon
[2:38:29] that was called
[2:38:31] n uh uh and Lucas was of serene now this
[2:38:36] Simon called ner if you want to if you
[2:38:38] want to just take a note on that this is
[2:38:40] the guy that tore the cross for
[2:38:44] Jesus he became part of the disciples
[2:38:51] which have been brought up with herob
[2:38:54] the Tetra and
[2:38:55] Saul as the
[2:38:57] minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy
[2:39:01] Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul
[2:39:05] for the work where unto I have called
[2:39:09] them now if you want to drop down a
[2:39:11] little bit you look here in verse 9 the
[2:39:15] Bible says then Saul who also
[2:39:19] is called Paul filled with the Holy
[2:39:22] Ghost set his eyes on him now what is
[2:39:26] significant here is that after verse 9
[2:39:29] he was no longer called Saul check in
[2:39:32] your
[2:39:34] Bible after verse n his name was
[2:39:42] changed the Bible call him Paul from
[2:39:44] then on
[2:39:49] so the calling of the Holy Ghost calling
[2:39:52] him to the
[2:39:55] ministry brought a
[2:40:01] change to his name he was the same
[2:40:05] person call him SA or Paul he will
[2:40:08] answer but there was something that have
[2:40:10] changed in his
[2:40:14] life are we together
[2:40:19] that's when his name went on Paul Paul
[2:40:22] PA and that's how we know
[2:40:24] him only time we call him Saul when we
[2:40:27] go back to the road of
[2:40:30] Damascus God changed his
[2:40:34] name God changed this man name that he
[2:40:38] became so
[2:40:39] burden he became so
[2:40:43] burden so burning
[2:40:50] that he
[2:40:51] decided this very gospel that I kill
[2:40:54] people for I have to die for
[2:40:57] it with everything that he have learned
[2:41:01] Paul was so
[2:41:02] learned that he could have got himself a
[2:41:05] degree he could have been a Pharisees he
[2:41:08] could have been a raber they could have
[2:41:10] called him names and all of that he had
[2:41:12] all of the
[2:41:14] titles but none of that meant anything
[2:41:17] to him
[2:41:20] praise the
[2:41:24] Lord are we
[2:41:28] together so he's the maker and The Giver
[2:41:32] of
[2:41:35] names when he call
[2:41:37] us to
[2:41:41] himself to be Sons and
[2:41:45] Daughters the Bible says he will call a
[2:41:48] people for his name sake
[2:41:51] and we say we are the bride we are a son
[2:41:53] of
[2:41:55] God what name is more than
[2:41:58] that what is what name what
[2:42:02] title can be more than you being a Son
[2:42:06] of God and living as a Son of
[2:42:10] God it might not mean
[2:42:12] anything to the people on
[2:42:15] Earth but to heaven and the sins over
[2:42:19] the bister when they look down in our
[2:42:21] generation and see how the church is
[2:42:24] feeling people that claim to be believer
[2:42:27] they are falling for nothing nothing
[2:42:30] it's not even Temptation they are
[2:42:32] falling for
[2:42:34] it man has consumed there's nothing
[2:42:37] there is no challenge there it's just
[2:42:39] something that your own passion and
[2:42:41] desire is consuming you
[2:42:44] of and they are looking over the
[2:42:46] banister and looking for a man that will
[2:42:48] stand for the the name of God a woman a
[2:42:50] young
[2:43:05] person when God call you he call you by
[2:43:10] name when he call you he call you by
[2:43:13] name when God gets your
[2:43:16] attention it's because from the day you
[2:43:19] were born set forth from your mother's
[2:43:22] womb he's been furing you he's been
[2:43:25] taking you through sicknesses through
[2:43:27] trials through disappointment through
[2:43:29] all sorts of things furing you making a
[2:43:34] name that when he gets your
[2:43:36] attention and bring the mystery of
[2:43:39] redemption to you and show you Amazing
[2:43:43] Grace praise the lord it's not to make
[2:43:47] you bigger than somebody
[2:43:49] no but that name that he has factioned
[2:43:52] from your
[2:43:54] birth he's ready to step behind that
[2:43:56] name if you would just give him the
[2:43:59] chance he's ready to step behind that
[2:44:03] name it might be as common as John or
[2:44:08] Joseph or whatever it is but God is
[2:44:11] ready to step behind that
[2:44:14] name because he's been making thy name
[2:44:18] just like Genesis chapter 1 he make Man
[2:44:22] In His Image male and female and call
[2:44:26] them
[2:44:28] Adam now he's ready to call you a
[2:44:32] bride he's ready to call you a son a
[2:44:38] daughter he sent a messenger that says
[2:44:41] now I call you
[2:44:45] bride is it that something that we can
[2:44:47] be proud of that almighty God will look
[2:44:52] down find favor on us just like he did
