[0:00] so he carried me away in the spirit
[0:03] and to the wilderness and i saw a woman
[0:06] sitting up on a scarlet
[0:08] colored beast let me get these symbols
[0:11] as you go along
[0:13] now scarlett is red
[0:18] red in one way is a good color
[0:21] red in another way is an ill-famed color
[0:25] red light danger color
[0:31] a scarlet colored she was decked in
[0:35] scarlet color
[0:37] red prostitute and was
[0:40] setting up on a beast
[0:44] a beast in the bible means power
[0:48] if you notice many ministers i see them
[0:51] not in their head
[0:52] right because they're teachers of the
[0:54] bible
[0:55] a beast means a power we see these
[0:58] beasts
[0:59] in the of the bible of revelations 13
[1:02] and of daniel coming up out of the water
[1:06] these powers coming up from among the
[1:08] people
[1:09] but did you notice in revelation 13 when
[1:12] the united states come up
[1:14] is the only beast in the bible that come
[1:17] up that did not come out of waters
[1:20] the bible said it come up out of the
[1:22] earth
[1:23] where there was no peoples that was this
[1:27] new kingdom
[1:28] and it looked like a lamb
[1:31] but afterwards spoke like the dragon
[1:34] that's right
[1:35] that's this country it's got to happen
[1:41] someday they'll make a mistake and elect
[1:43] the wrong guy that's right
[1:45] they're raised up for joseph or pharaoh
[1:47] it doesn't know joseph
[1:50] they've tried it before and they'll do
[1:51] it again if they fail this time
[1:54] it'll finally come the bible says so
[1:56] that's right
[1:58] now i'm not a politician both sides of
[2:01] them are crooked
[2:03] i'm placing my vote on jesus christ
[2:09] he's the only one i'm interested in
[2:13] but i'll tell you you better wipe your
[2:15] glasses off now
[2:18] and expect any freedom for your children
[2:21] i don't know how close it is pray
[2:25] all right heaven watch so he carried me
[2:27] away in the spirit
[2:29] into the wilderness and i saw a woman
[2:31] church
[2:32] setting up on a scarlet colored beast
[2:35] scarlet colored beast
[2:36] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[2:40] heads and ten horns
[2:43] seven heads on down here said the seven
[2:46] heads
[2:46] which was on the beast is seven hills on
[2:49] which the
[2:50] the city set up now what cities built on
[2:53] seven hills
[2:55] rome exactly
[2:58] a city sitting on seven hills a church
[3:02] a woman a prostitute that'll control the
[3:05] world with her powers
[3:07] well it's just as plain as reading the
[3:09] newspaper
[3:11] certainly now
[3:14] and the woman was a raided purple and
[3:17] scarlet colors the woman
[3:19] the church rich and decked with gold and
[3:23] precious stones and pearls
[3:25] tell me what one american income tax
[3:29] tell me whether tax for anything right
[3:32] away of anything you want to do
[3:35] yet god's got children in there
[3:38] certainly
[3:39] just the same pot can't call kittle
[3:42] black
[3:44] a lot of times the protestants say well
[3:45] the catholics they murdered this that
[3:47] the other who murdered joseph smith
[3:51] i don't agree with him but he had just
[3:53] as much right for his teaching as i've
[3:54] got for mine here in america
[3:56] and the methodist church murder joseph
[3:58] smith
[4:00] when you come into the salt lake city
[4:03] it's got a great big sign up you
[4:04] methodists watch some arm and crickets
[4:08] right the methodist church shot joseph
[4:11] smith down
[4:13] protestants so don't holler about the
[4:15] catholic
[4:17] watch just a few minutes the bible say
[4:19] so too
[4:21] precious stones pearls having a golden
[4:25] cup in her hand
[4:26] full of the abomination of the
[4:28] filthiness of her fornications
[4:30] her doctrines what she was giving out
[4:34] kings of the earth drinking anybody
[4:37] could believe that
[4:38] could leave brother jaggers
[4:42] vitamin pills
[4:48] that you can sprinkle a water on a woman
[4:50] that's been married to a man for 30
[4:52] years and had a bunch of children and
[4:54] turn her back to a virgin
[4:55] and send her to a bridal bed that night
[4:57] with her husband
[4:59] anybody can believe that holy water will
[5:00] do that can believe anything
[5:04] that's right amen but the kings of the
[5:07] earth
[5:09] commit such things as that it's so they
[5:12] can live and have a peaceful feeling
[5:15] down in your heart you know you're
[5:16] rotten
[5:18] takes the blood of jesus christ to
[5:20] cleanse you but now notice
[5:25] she was the first organized church
[5:28] the bible speaks of it here and upon her
[5:32] forehead was a name
[5:33] written mystery
[5:36] babbling the great the mother of harlots
[5:41] and abominations of the earth
[5:44] a watch we all will agree
[5:48] and romans own books the catholics own
[5:50] books
[5:51] agree that that is the roman church amen
[5:55] their own books could agree with it how
[5:57] about what's called facts of our faith
[5:59] only belongs to a priest a catholic was
[6:02] converted to my whichever boy was a
[6:04] priest
[6:05] and she gave me the book then you talked
[6:07] to her back in church you come for it
[6:08] and let her have it
[6:09] i kept it for evidence boy i don't know
[6:12] what i was talking about when i say
[6:14] anything i must know it
[6:15] amen god's going to hold me responsible
[6:18] for it
[6:19] and remember she was called mystery
[6:22] babbling
[6:24] we know that's a catholic church but
[6:25] notice she's a mother
[6:28] of harlots what's a harlot
[6:32] the same thing as she is the
[6:36] now where did these organizations come
[6:39] from
[6:40] there's your mother that's what you are
[6:42] to begin with
[6:45] then you say that's the antichrist
[6:47] that's true then if that's antichrist
[6:49] then what about our organizations
[6:51] just as harlot and the same thing
[6:55] committing adultery committing
[6:58] fornications accepting false things
[7:02] because of the mind and intellectuals of
[7:04] man
[7:05] as the bible said teaching for doctrine
[7:07] the commandments of man
[7:10] that's what's called church today which
[7:12] is against
[7:13] god's kingdom
[7:17] like in the old testament god wanted to
[7:20] be king over
[7:21] israel before it became a church and he
[7:24] was king
[7:26] and although they had a prophet
[7:29] samuel a good man
[7:32] and when he had told them that if they
[7:35] wanted a king but they want to be like
[7:36] the rest of people
[7:38] they want to be like the philistines
[7:40] that's what samaritan's protestant
[7:41] people
[7:42] they just won't let good enough alone
[7:44] that's right they just when the holy
[7:46] ghost fell on the back under 40 years
[7:48] ago
[7:49] and the power began to pour out they
[7:50] began to dance and shout and speak with
[7:53] tongues
[7:53] they wouldn't leave it alone they had to
[7:56] organize
[7:57] right then along came one and he called
[7:59] him a general counsel
[8:01] along came another with a little light
[8:02] on the name jesus christ
[8:04] and they called them the new issues and
[8:06] turned them out then they got them an
[8:08] organization called the pfjc the
[8:10] pentecostal symbol of jesus christ
[8:12] a little friction come in between him
[8:14] whether he's coming on a white horse or
[8:15] high was coming and they organized
[8:17] another called the afw pentecost
[8:19] assemblies of the world
[8:22] oh my my then all come the church of god
[8:25] then they broke off by prophecy
[8:27] organized again every time you do it
[8:30] you go out of the way of god that's
[8:32] right praise the lord
[8:34] antichrist spirit god's church is free
[8:38] god's church is bound by no boundaries
[8:40] because from
[8:41] sea to sea is god's amen every human
[8:44] being under the earth belongs to him
[8:46] amen
[8:48] whether he in catholic prophecy or
[8:50] whatever he is
[8:51] god seeks those with an honest heart and
[8:54] we're saved by
[8:55] faith believing him that's the church
[9:00] now you see the church is not an
[9:01] organization and every time you see
[9:03] organization just remember
[9:05] antichrist has wrote over it here it is
[9:08] in the bible
[9:10] that's as plain as i know how to read it
[9:12] i i've got
[9:13] plenty of precious friends sitting here
[9:15] that belongs to organizations
[9:17] i don't say your antichrist i'm not
[9:20] calling you that
[9:21] but behind the whole thing yeah
[9:24] amen and it looks like the devil has
[9:27] twisted it in such a way till you
[9:29] have to have something like that or they
[9:31] won't even let you preach
[9:33] [Music]
[9:34] that's the same thing the nations as god
[9:37] you can't be a man without a nation
[9:41] you have to have a nation somewhere you
[9:44] have to either be american german or
[9:45] something
[9:47] see it's all twisted around so really
[9:51] a real born-again christian is almost a
[9:53] wonder
[9:58] in the side of the world he's a renegade
[10:01] but in the sight of god he's precious
[10:04] wish we had time to go to hebrews 11
[10:06] and see all them faith warriors how
[10:09] abraham
[10:11] stepped out and called himself a pilgrim
[10:14] and a stranger said this world was his
[10:17] home
[10:18] but he was wandering about seeking a
[10:21] city whose builder and maker was god
[10:25] and if we be dirty christ we take on
[10:28] abraham's seat and her heir
[10:30] to him
[10:32] [Applause]
[10:37] [Music]
[10:40] when israel come up out of egypt there
[10:43] was
[10:43] moab the great organized country
[10:47] there was also esau the great organized
[10:51] country and there was israel on
[10:54] on denomination coming along both of
[10:58] them fundamentally in the word
[11:00] remember balaam offered the same
[11:01] sacrifice that israel offered
[11:03] seven orders god's requirement seven
[11:06] cleanest sacrifices
[11:08] seven rams speaking of the coming of a
[11:10] just one
[11:11] fundamentally they were both right
[11:14] speaking fundamentally
[11:15] but what balaam failed to see he failed
[11:18] to see that supernatural
[11:20] amongst israel that interdenominational
[11:22] group no place to go
[11:26] they were wandering but they were on the
[11:28] road somewhere
[11:30] that's the way the church of the living
[11:32] god is today
[11:33] it's unorganized as far as the world is
[11:35] concerned but it's
[11:36] bound together about not organization
[11:39] tithes but by the power and the spirit
[11:41] of jesus christ by the bonds of love
[11:46] make some methodists and baptists pat
[11:48] one other on the back and say my
[11:50] precious brother
[11:53] when they're see they can't walk
[11:56] together unless they're
[11:56] greed people say are you a christian i'm
[11:59] a baptist
[12:00] i don't answer the question at all am i
[12:02] a christian i'm pentecost
[12:04] that only answers the question if you
[12:06] are a christian you are a born-again
[12:08] creature
[12:10] you are in a mystic kingdom of god your
[12:12] eyes are not on things in this world but
[12:14] on things above
[12:16] and that's when you're in the church
[12:18] amen
[12:20] that is the church it is not an
[12:22] organization it can
[12:24] never be an organization
[12:27] take me on record the church of the
[12:29] living god can
[12:31] never be any certain group
[12:34] it cannot be an organization amen it has
[12:37] to be a mystical body
[12:40] the holy spirit a little farther if we
[12:42] get time we'll get
[12:44] right into it now now you see what
[12:47] church means church means a called
[12:51] out bunch a called out
[12:54] people that's governed only by the king
[12:58] of this
[12:59] messiah kingdom
[13:02] oh isn't that wonderful
[13:06] i love that when i read that in the uh
[13:09] uh today
[13:09] in what i said there the kingdom the
[13:12] messianic
[13:13] empire the writer put it
[13:16] messianic empire the writer also
[13:20] said there is not such a thing
[13:24] as a church of the living god ever being
[13:26] organized
[13:28] an organization is something that was
[13:32] adapted
[13:34] into to take the place out
[13:38] that's just exactly why all these false
[13:40] doctrines is brought in
[13:42] to take the place of the real that's the
[13:45] reason a woman had in her hand a cup of
[13:47] the filthiness of her abomination
[13:50] now you see i'm not saying the
[13:52] pentecostals is
[13:53] just as guilty as the catholic or the
[13:57] pilgrim holiness or the nazarenes or the
[13:59] baptist or
[14:01] amen methodist in all those
[14:03] denominational churches
[14:05] god has children amen amen
[14:10] they belong into this mystic kingdom the
[14:12] only thing they're waiting for
[14:14] is to see that something take place
[14:17] that'll draw our hearts into it i'm so
[14:20] glad to know tonight that they're coming
[14:21] from the east and west north and south
[14:23] america amen pulling themselves out
[14:27] worshiping waiting for the coming of the
[14:30] lord
[14:31] the bible said they'd do that in the
[14:33] last days
[14:35] that's exactly right and said they'd run
[14:37] from the east to the west north and
[14:39] south
[14:40] seeking for the true word of god
[14:44] famine not for bread and water
[14:47] but for the hearing of the word of god
[14:50] they want you come join this come join
[14:53] this
[14:53] there's nothing you join in the kingdom
[14:56] of god there's not one thing you can
[14:57] join
[14:59] it's an experience of being born
[15:02] into the church not jarned into it
[15:06] now i'll make you a little more on that
[15:09] in a minute i've got
[15:10] some more scriptures roll down there but
[15:12] now let's go to the second
[15:14] thought so we can try to get through all
[15:16] of it
[15:18] who set it up that is this mystical body
[15:22] who started this jesus christ
[15:28] and it is the he is the head
[15:31] of this mystical body
[15:34] he's a king over working his own will
[15:38] in his dominion not a bishop's control
[15:43] or a church board's control but
[15:46] a king which is messiah
[15:49] himself working in his own domain
[15:57] when did it begin at pentecost
[16:01] not the pentecostal organization the
[16:03] pentecostal experience
[16:05] that's when it began with you he spoke
[16:09] of its coming
[16:10] he said what would take place he told it
[16:14] was coming
[16:14] now if we will we can turn to luke
[16:18] 24 chapter 49 first and we can see here
[16:21] start reading some scriptures so these
[16:23] people that's taking this can put it
[16:25] down
[16:25] luke 24 49 we'll see what he said
[16:32] and behold i send the promise of my
[16:34] father upon you
[16:36] but tear ye in the city of jerusalem
[16:38] until you're endued with power from on
[16:40] high
[16:42] now he promised of a coming
[16:46] church a coming kingdom now
[16:50] turn right over to acts one and
[16:53] eight now i remember he spoke also in
[16:56] matthew
[16:57] 16 18 of upon this rock
[17:01] he would build his church and the gates
[17:03] of hell should not prevail against it
[17:06] we're going to get to that just in a few
[17:08] minutes
[17:09] as we go on down into the other subject
[17:12] acts 1 and 8
[17:14] but you shall receive power after the
[17:17] holy ghost has come upon you
[17:19] and you shall be witnesses unto me
[17:23] both in jerusalem judea samara
[17:26] and to the utmost parts of the world
[17:30] a coming kingdom of witnesses
[17:35] witnesses of his resurrection witnesses
[17:38] of his power
[17:40] witnesses of his of being alive
[17:44] you're my witnesses now acts one and
[17:47] eight
[17:48] then we also find that in ephesians
[17:52] the first chapter 22nd verse
[17:55] you just put that down just there's
[17:57] plenty of it to put down but just to
[17:58] nail it down to make it sure that you're
[18:01] you see it
[18:03] all right the 22nd verse of ephesians
[18:06] the first chapter
[18:07] and has put all things under his feet
[18:10] that's christ
[18:12] and gave him to be the head over the
[18:14] things
[18:15] to the church
[18:19] which is his body
[18:24] and the fullness of him that filleth
[18:27] all in all
[18:31] who set this church up jesus christ
[18:35] no bishop no group a man
[18:39] no pope no man made powers at all
[18:43] but jesus christ spoke of it being his
[18:47] kingdom that was coming in power
[18:51] some censure 16th chapter matthew
[18:54] very i'll say you some stand sure shall
[18:56] not see death until they see the kingdom
[18:59] of god
[19:00] coming in power just a few days after
[19:03] that he was crucified
[19:05] and the holy ghost fell some
[19:08] stand here shall not see death until
[19:11] they see the kingdom of god
[19:12] will thou restore the kingdom at this
[19:15] time the jews ask him
[19:17] he said it's not for you to know the
[19:18] time or the season what the father is
[19:20] putting his own mind
[19:21] but you shall receive power acts 1
[19:25] you shall receive power after the holy
[19:28] ghost has come upon you
[19:29] you shall receive power after you are
[19:31] made a bishop if you're made a preacher
[19:34] if you're made a pope after you made a
[19:35] priest you shall receive power
[19:38] after the holy ghost has come on you
[19:41] that's the witness that god was looking
[19:43] for a witness
[19:45] after the holy ghost this comes not a
[19:48] witness that i'm a bishop
[19:50] not a witness that i'm a pastor but a
[19:52] witness of what
[19:54] of the resurrected king
[19:57] that's the true church of the living god
[20:01] all right and also in colossians
[20:04] 1 17 and we might read this as while
[20:07] we're
[20:07] at colossians 1 17 and 18th verse
[20:12] and he who is before all things
[20:15] and by him all things consist
[20:19] and he is the head of the body
[20:22] the church who he is
[20:25] who is the beginning the firstborn
[20:29] from the dead that in all things he
[20:32] might
[20:33] have the preeminence who
[20:36] is the head of this church jesus
[20:39] christ what kingdom is it the messianic
[20:43] kingdom
[20:44] the church not an organization a church
[20:48] a mystic body to which christ is
[20:51] the head oh i love that
[20:55] walking in the spirit obeying the king
[20:59] foolish to the world precious in the
[21:01] sight of god
[21:03] walking in the spirit misunderstood life
[21:06] that made fun of
[21:08] all that live godly in christ jesus
[21:10] shall suffer persecution
[21:12] if they persecute the prophets which
[21:13] were before you call the master the king
[21:16] master of the building be else above how
[21:18] much more will they call them of his
[21:20] disciples
[21:22] but you're walking in the spirit turning
[21:25] your back on the things of the world
[21:27] not bound by any fetters he who the son
[21:30] is made free is free indeed
[21:34] amen that's the church of the living god
[21:38] that's who set it up now
[21:42] we see in witnesses in acts 1 and 8 he
[21:44] said you shall be my
[21:46] witnesses after the holy ghost has come
[21:48] on you
[21:50] what is the church the mystic body of
[21:53] christ
[21:55] who set it up the lord jesus himself
[21:59] he wasn't set up at rome neither wasn't
[22:02] set up in england but john wesley
[22:04] neither was the set for calvin or in
[22:07] america the baptist but john smith
[22:09] neither of us was set up in california
[22:11] by the pentecostals
[22:12] it was set up by jesus christ the king
[22:16] of the messianic kingdom
[22:18] that's what was set up by he is the king
[22:22] he wants to be king he wants to rule us
[22:24] he wants to be lord
[22:26] people let him in say i'll let him be
[22:28] savior but they won't let him be lord
[22:30] lord means ownership rulership
[22:34] come into my heart lord save me from
[22:36] hell but don't tell me what to do
[22:39] that's the attitude of the people that's
[22:41] the reason
[22:42] no one in the bible said all the tables
[22:45] have become full of vomit
[22:47] you know what vomit is as a dog turns to
[22:51] its vomit
[22:52] if these organizations didn't work in
[22:54] the first time and god had to vomit them
[22:56] out
[22:57] go back to him they'll make you vomit
[22:58] again amen
[23:00] he said i would that you were hot or
[23:02] cold because you're lukewarm i'll spew
[23:04] you from my mouth
[23:06] you make god sick at his stomach and he
[23:08] vomits us out
[23:10] tell me an organization that ever fell
[23:12] it ever rose again
[23:14] show me by history where one ever did a
[23:17] man will rise up with a ministry
[23:19] god will bless that man the first thing
[23:21] you know he'll turn it right around and
[23:22] get amongst man
[23:23] and make an organization out of it and
[23:25] that kills it right there
[23:28] look through the histories and find one
[23:29] that ever come up
[23:31] not a one because it's all an antichrist
[23:34] spirit amongst the people like moses and
[23:38] wanted something they could do
[23:39] themselves lord we had so many members
[23:41] this year what difference does that make
[23:43] how many members you have we're not
[23:45] looking for members of a church
[23:47] we're looking for members of christ's
[23:49] body
[23:51] borne into the kingdom of god not by the
[23:53] will of man but by the will of god
[23:56] not for the spirit of man or the
[23:58] intelligence of man
[23:59] paul said i never come to you with the
[24:01] wisdom of man i come to you with the
[24:03] spirit of god in the power of his
[24:04] resurrection
[24:06] that's your faith will not rest in the
[24:07] wisdom or chat the words of man
[24:09] but in the power of the resurrection of
[24:11] jesus christ
[24:13] that's what he come in god help us that
[24:15] we do the same thing
[24:17] now we don't want to spend too much time
