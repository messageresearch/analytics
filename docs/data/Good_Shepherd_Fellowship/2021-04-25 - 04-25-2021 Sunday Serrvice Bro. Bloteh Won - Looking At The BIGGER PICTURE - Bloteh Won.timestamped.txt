[52:37] saint john chapter nine we know while
[52:39] john chapter nine
[52:40] have uh uh
[52:43] very familiar story of a child being
[52:48] born blind
[52:49] and
[52:54] because of all form of teaching
[52:59] and sin is the cause of all sickness
[53:03] so the
[53:07] his illness was attributed to either his
[53:10] parents sin or his grandparents sin and
[53:12] all of that
[53:14] but let's just let's just take from
[53:19] verse 35.
[53:29] jesus heard that they had cast him out
[53:34] and when he had found him he said unto
[53:37] him
[53:37] does thou believe on the son of god
[53:43] he answered and said who is he
[53:46] lord that i might believe on him
[53:50] praise the lord
[53:56] i thought i taught about vasa uh he
[53:59] answered and said who is he lord
[54:02] uh how did he know that jesus was lo
[54:05] there was the lord
[54:07] and uh and jesus said unto him
[54:12] thou have both seen him and it is he
[54:17] that talketh with thee
[54:20] and he said lord i believe
[54:25] and he worshipped him and jesus said
[54:30] for josh man i am come
[54:33] into this word that they which
[54:37] see net my seed
[54:40] and their day which seed might
[54:44] be made blind and some of the pharisees
[54:50] which were with him heard those words
[54:53] and said unto him are we blind also
[55:00] jesus said unto them if
[55:03] ye were blind yes you
[55:06] have no sin praise the lord
[55:11] if you don't see it it's not a problem
[55:14] to you
[55:16] but when you see it you are guilty
[55:20] the road sign says if you see something
[55:22] say something
[55:25] you see that to the airport if you see
[55:27] something
[55:28] say something because when you see it
[55:31] you are guilty jesus said unto them
[55:35] if ye were blind yes you have no
[55:38] sin but now yes say we see
[55:44] therefore your sin remain it

[58:31] when i realized something brother
[58:33] branham said
[58:35] you know it just it just grabs your
[58:37] attention like that in
[58:39] and then but i just thought that we're
[58:42] going to get back
[58:44] to what i had on my heart and prayed to
[58:46] speak
[58:47] on this morning that are entitled
[58:50] looking at the bigger picture
[58:56] looking at the bigger picture because i
[58:58] believe
[59:00] that uh that was the reason of the
[59:02] opening of the seals
[59:05] it was god wanted us to see the bigger
[59:07] picture
[59:08] i believe that's the reason why god has
[59:11] sent us
[59:12] a son of man ministry in this last day
[59:16] because there's a picture that was being
[59:19] played out right from the beginning of
[59:21] time
[59:22] and on the uh uh the
[59:25] the ministry of malachi 4 we have an
[59:28] opportunity
[59:29] to see the bigger picture but i think
[59:32] the problem
[59:33] uh of why is is difficult to see the
[59:36] the the bigger picture is because
[59:40] we are living in an age that have a
[59:42] sight problem
[59:46] praise the lord have a side problem
[59:51] and medical science have told us they
[59:54] have
[59:54] they have some very big you know
[59:57] beautiful names
[59:59] on it and i just thought that i have not
[1:00:02] done my
[1:00:02] tongue surgery yet so pronouncing some
[1:00:05] of those needs might tell my guests talk
[1:00:07] to the roof of my mouth
[1:00:08] and i might not be able to preach my
[1:00:10] message so
[1:00:12] i would just stay with uh short
[1:00:14] sightiness
[1:00:15] and long silence
[1:00:21] praise the lord the medical science have
[1:00:24] taught us that
[1:00:26] those are some of the side problems that
[1:00:30] we could have and anything beyond that
[1:00:33] we might go to blindness
[1:00:36] praise the lord and i believe that is
[1:00:39] some of the reason
[1:00:41] uh you know because everything that have
[1:00:44] come to us
[1:00:44] as uh as an illness in the body is from
[1:00:47] it's from it's from the spirit realm
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:50] it's it's from spirit brain those are
[1:00:52] demon powers that are
[1:00:54] that uh you know manifesting in and
[1:00:57] affecting our body
[1:00:58] you know whether the headache or the by
[1:01:01] pain in our body or
[1:01:03] cancer whatever it is so uh
[1:01:06] i believe that is the reason why uh we
[1:01:09] struggle
[1:01:10] to see the bigger picture because
[1:01:16] we we find ourselves in
[1:01:19] in this situation you know i was
[1:01:21] thinking about that
[1:01:23] you know with with all of the things
[1:01:25] that
[1:01:26] you know god has done throughout the
[1:01:29] ages and the different men
[1:01:31] that that he have used to be able to
[1:01:33] bring us to where we
[1:01:35] are and uh and and and
[1:01:38] uh i mean the message of the hour this
[1:01:40] morning i was i was going to preach on
[1:01:42] the greatest move of god
[1:01:44] which also have to do with uh speed that
[1:01:46] we were talking on on
[1:01:48] on wednesday night uh but i just thought
[1:01:51] that well let's
[1:01:52] let's go this direction and if the lord
[1:01:55] can help us
[1:01:56] to see uh you know uh talk about the
[1:02:00] bigger picture maybe we will get back to
[1:02:02] that great move of god but it's is very
[1:02:05] interesting
[1:02:06] you know the move of god has has has
[1:02:09] been uh
[1:02:10] limited to the different revivals
[1:02:13] uh that uh uh you know wesley was a move
[1:02:17] of god
[1:02:18] luthor was a move of god the pentecostal
[1:02:20] had a move of god
[1:02:22] and uh uh and and
[1:02:25] and the message of the hour you know is
[1:02:28] is the greatest move of god
[1:02:30] you know in terms of of
[1:02:33] revival but i was reading and as i was
[1:02:37] telling brother branham
[1:02:38] said uh uh when we get today i'll share
[1:02:41] that with you
[1:02:42] he said uh
[1:02:45] he that believe it or mean he quoted
[1:02:47] this he said he that believed on me
[1:02:50] is passed from death unto life he says
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:53] is the great move of god the thing that
[1:02:57] will make you to pass from death unto
[1:03:00] life
[1:03:03] a social speed that god takes
[1:03:07] that the human mind cannot
[1:03:10] understand it cannot grab him amen
[1:03:14] when a man's life passed from death on
[1:03:17] to life
[1:03:18] he says there's the greatest move of god
[1:03:23] amen praise the lord
[1:03:28] but let's look at uh this thought
[1:03:31] of looking at the bigger picture
[1:03:35] praise the lord
[1:03:39] amen we all
[1:03:42] know that uh
[1:03:46] over and over brother branham taught us
[1:03:48] about god having a great drama
[1:03:51] we will read the idea under the message
[1:03:54] or the deity of jesus christ he says now
[1:03:56] notice
[1:03:57] a little wider than the word syria be
[1:03:59] normal yet you will see me
[1:04:01] for i will be with you even in you to
[1:04:05] the end of the world that's right
[1:04:08] he is here now
[1:04:12] in in the days how
[1:04:16] his big picture always
[1:04:19] revolved up and made the same thing come
[1:04:23] to pass
[1:04:24] that we are seeing now
[1:04:28] the great drama is set and we are and we
[1:04:31] are ready now to see
[1:04:33] great things happen
[1:04:36] the church the church has been brought
[1:04:40] from the cradle
[1:04:41] that's right pentecostal rocked it down
[1:04:44] yeah that a few years ago back there
[1:04:47] while the people throw
[1:04:49] stones and made fun and laugh at
[1:04:52] and she grown to maturity that's exactly
[1:04:55] right
[1:04:56] the hour is here hallelujah that's right
[1:05:00] that's uh uh what
[1:05:03] i'm interested in to see god's church
[1:05:06] coming together now we have been
[1:05:08] beat out and and beat out there by the
[1:05:12] hour
[1:05:13] is coming when god
[1:05:17] throwing the blanket across us all
[1:05:20] to draw us in praise the lord
[1:05:24] amen praise the lord and when we know
[1:05:28] that that uh uh
[1:05:32] there's there's uh when we spoke on the
[1:05:35] answer to the devil's question
[1:05:37] we know there's there's one other thing
[1:05:40] you know that god is doing
[1:05:42] and uh uh he says if i be lifted up
[1:05:46] i would draw all men unto me praise the
[1:05:50] lord
[1:05:50] we know that is that is uh uh truth
[1:05:53] oneness
[1:05:54] you know truth oneness uh bringing us
[1:05:57] back to the place of being co-equal
[1:06:00] that's true oneness and uh
[1:06:04] so god uh spraying the blanket across
[1:06:07] and drawing every one of us back to him
[1:06:10] praise the lord now so well
[1:06:13] uh brother bannon go ahead and he says
[1:06:17] here he says
[1:06:19] he's standing now for his people down
[1:06:22] you said the the great thing in the last
[1:06:24] year when these things come to pass
[1:06:26] mine the great exploit
[1:06:29] will the people then and men of faith
[1:06:32] will do
[1:06:33] the hour has come down that when the
[1:06:37] great drama and picture of god
[1:06:39] set forth of the lottery and joy said in
[1:06:43] the last day
[1:06:45] you know it shall come to pass i will
[1:06:47] poured out my spirit upon all flesh sons
[1:06:49] and daughters
[1:06:51] uh i shall prophesied for my handmaiden
[1:06:54] and all of that and we and we realized
[1:06:56] that brother brandon i'm talking about
[1:06:58] this
[1:06:59] and and he's just going to to to bible
[1:07:02] prophecies
[1:07:03] and you know and and and what god has
[1:07:05] promised to do
[1:07:07] so we see that's the reason why uh
[1:07:10] we have dispensation of time we we have
[1:07:13] to know
[1:07:14] that god that we have to deal with he is
[1:07:17] the great intent of spirit amen
[1:07:20] one time he feel all time and space
[1:07:23] praise the lord there is no way we could
[1:07:26] understand god's purpose for our life
[1:07:30] or god's program for our age if god did
[1:07:34] not
[1:07:34] uh broke us into time and dispensation
[1:07:39] that's the reason why we have
[1:07:40] dispensation that's the reason why
[1:07:43] there was certain different things that
[1:07:45] took place in the airfield he abroad all
[1:07:48] his children at the same time he could
[1:07:49] have done it
[1:07:50] you know but he set up all of this and
[1:07:54] we see that also
[1:07:56] in a plane of creation
[1:07:59] it was not nothing impossible for our
[1:08:02] god
[1:08:02] to have created everything one day
[1:08:07] but yet he came forth and the bible says
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:10] and the first day he says let there be
[1:08:12] lighting and and the darkness rode away
[1:08:15] and god himself stopped himself and says
[1:08:18] it is good then the next day
[1:08:22] he created something else and he said it
[1:08:24] is good
[1:08:25] praise the lord brother branham in
[1:08:27] question and answer make us to our
[1:08:29] question answered in genesis
[1:08:31] he make us to understand that god did
[1:08:33] there to give
[1:08:35] us an opportunity to be able to see
[1:08:38] his great plan of redemption
[1:08:43] praise the lord even though they say
[1:08:46] it's not impossible for him to have
[1:08:48] created everything
[1:08:50] one day but he did that he broke it up
[1:08:52] into day in time
[1:08:55] just so we can be able to have an idea
[1:08:58] that this
[1:08:58] great intent of god has a plan
[1:09:04] praise the lord and he has a purpose
[1:09:08] for everything
[1:09:12] glory be to god amen
[1:09:15] and over and over you know brother
[1:09:17] branham said it throughout the message
[1:09:19] you know he says
[1:09:20] the hour has come now that when the
[1:09:23] great drama picture of god is set forth
[1:09:27] a great drama picture of god
[1:09:31] praise the lord are we together
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:38] all of these things
[1:09:44] what a dead water time that we are
[1:09:45] living in
[1:09:48] in the message of the ministry of christ
[1:09:52] he said and this whole bible
[1:09:56] to my opinion
[1:09:59] the whole set up is
[1:10:03] a dramatic story
[1:10:06] just starting out of eating
[1:10:10] coming out through the gate on out
[1:10:13] a way the weight
[1:10:16] of the cross leading right back again
[1:10:20] just all one big picture
[1:10:24] that has placed out of his mind
[1:10:29] i can imagine seeing god before there
[1:10:31] was even
[1:10:32] a foundation of the word
[1:10:37] praise the lord and we know that
[1:10:41] foundation of the word was in the back
[1:10:43] part of god's mind
[1:10:45] praise the lord it was his thoughts in
[1:10:48] his mind
[1:10:52] seeing god before there was a foundation
[1:10:54] of the word for there was a moon sigh
[1:10:57] anything seeing him said in spaciano
[1:11:01] and in his mind he drew out that picture
[1:11:07] praise the lord what it will all be and
[1:11:12] everything he just spoke out and said
[1:11:16] let there be praise the lord
[1:11:21] amen now even in the beginning when god
[1:11:25] said let there be light
[1:11:31] then after a while he came back again
[1:11:33] and then he says well you know let the
[1:11:35] sun give light to the day the moon and
[1:11:37] the stars
[1:11:38] in night you know and then he starts to
[1:11:40] explain
[1:11:41] he starts to break it down and he starts
[1:11:44] to break it down
[1:11:45] because it was a big picture let's
[1:11:48] travel yet a little bit
[1:11:49] with this maybe the law will help us as
[1:11:52] we go along
[1:11:56] and in his mind he drew out that picture
[1:11:59] what it will all be and everything
[1:12:04] he just spoke and said let the beating
[1:12:06] and everything just begin to come
[1:12:09] into its place isn't he wonderful
[1:12:15] to think of that and then seeing
[1:12:18] in his great sovereign love
[1:12:22] to come down and save
[1:12:25] lost sinners
[1:12:29] like myself in you praise the lord
[1:12:33] you know i had brother brown talking on
[1:12:35] the tape this morning as we were playing
[1:12:37] uh
[1:12:38] uh uh on that uh
[1:12:41] uh gabriel uh
[1:12:45] purpose there and then the seventh week
[1:12:47] of how
[1:12:48] god had to blind the jews
[1:12:51] because of me
[1:12:54] in you praise the lord
[1:12:58] it was all part of his big picture
[1:13:02] praise the lord it was all part of his
[1:13:05] big picture
[1:13:08] can you imagine that in his in his great
[1:13:10] mind he saw us sitting here
[1:13:13] this wouldn't have happened you wouldn't
[1:13:15] have been here this morning
[1:13:16] that's praise the lord if he was not
[1:13:20] part of his
[1:13:21] part of his great picture
[1:13:25] praise the lord that's the god that we
[1:13:28] have to deal with
[1:13:30] there is no moment there is
[1:13:34] no moment there is not a meaning
[1:13:37] or a second
[1:13:40] that just involves itself
[1:13:44] it was all part of the plan
[1:13:48] it was all part of his great picture
[1:13:54] if we were just thinking think about it
[1:13:58] there is not a meaning there is nothing
[1:14:01] that happened on earth
[1:14:04] there was an interruption
[1:14:09] to his plan there was nothing that
[1:14:12] happened that took him by surprise
[1:14:19] praise the lord all right
[1:14:22] i might have taken us by surprise this
[1:14:25] whole covey thing took us that surprise
[1:14:27] we never even thought that it would have
[1:14:29] lasted this long
[1:14:32] but it was not a surprise to almighty
[1:14:35] god
[1:14:40] praise the lord hallelujah when you
[1:14:42] think about it
[1:14:44] it kind of for humble you
[1:14:48] to know that there are things that are
[1:14:51] part of god's
[1:14:52] great picture even concerning my life
[1:14:55] that i don't know
[1:14:56] about
[1:15:00] that i don't know about there are things
[1:15:03] concerning i mean there is in god
[1:15:05] picture he already saw it it's going to
[1:15:07] be
[1:15:09] is going to happen just like the way he
[1:15:11] saw it
[1:15:14] and yet we don't have no idea about it
[1:15:20] praise the lord
[1:15:26] or they humble us that way
[1:15:30] about ourselves how much more about
[1:15:33] other people praise the lord
[1:15:39] how much more about other people how
[1:15:41] much more about uh
[1:15:42] uh
[1:15:46] our children our loved ones
[1:15:55] praise the lord amen
[1:16:02] you know sometimes you you the lord have
[1:16:05] you i help you you have this thought on
[1:16:07] your mind you
[1:16:08] you you are gearing to go in one
[1:16:10] direction and then he's taking you in
[1:16:12] another direction
[1:16:13] so that's just the way i feel i feel
[1:16:15] like i'm going slower than i thought i
[1:16:17] would preach this morning
[1:16:19] but it's okay as long as the lord is in
[1:16:22] control that's that's what matters
[1:16:25] amen that's exactly what matcha he says
[1:16:28] i can imagine seeing god there from the
[1:16:31] foundation of the world and in his mind
[1:16:33] he drew out a picture what it would be
[1:16:36] everything he just poked it out when he
[1:16:38] said let it be
[1:16:39] he said and then seeing in his great
[1:16:42] sovereign love he come down and saved
[1:16:46] lost sinner like myself in you i can't
[1:16:49] understand no wonder
[1:16:52] the person all love of god how rich
[1:16:56] how pure amen
[1:16:59] fathomless strong
[1:17:04] is forevermore in deal the saints
[1:17:08] and the angel sing dead
[1:17:12] yeah him he says and and and there's
[1:17:16] not one scripture in the entire bible
[1:17:20] but what will dovetail and connect
[1:17:23] with the next scripture every bit of it
[1:17:27] is one great big picture
[1:17:31] oh that's the reason why
[1:17:34] the scripture cannot contradict itself
[1:17:39] scripture cannot fight against scripture
[1:17:41] it's just it just won't great big
[1:17:43] picture
[1:17:45] we just need a man that can put the
[1:17:48] puzzle together
[1:17:50] for us to be able to see the picture
[1:17:54] praise the lord
[1:18:03] the entire bible but what would dovetail
[1:18:06] and connect with the next scripture
[1:18:08] every bit
[1:18:09] of it is one great big picture
[1:18:12] all the way from the guiding of eating
[1:18:16] and the way to the cross
[1:18:20] back to the garden again
[1:18:24] just one great beautiful
[1:18:28] picture
[1:18:32] praise the lord amen
[1:18:37] i'm so glad that you feel that way you
[1:18:39] feel happy to know that is one great
[1:18:40] picture
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:47] praise the lord and i do not mean to be
[1:18:51] sacrilegious by making this mistake on
[1:18:54] this statement he says
[1:18:57] but if it's a mistake god forgive me
[1:19:00] but it's just like hell jesus poser
[1:19:04] that you have put in it together
[1:19:08] you have to have the holy spirit to put
[1:19:12] it together
[1:19:14] just like a puzzle
[1:19:18] you get the picture on one side and you
[1:19:21] look at the picture
[1:19:22] and you put the pieces together and the
[1:19:25] scripture is of no
[1:19:27] private interpretation it was wrote by
[1:19:30] the holy spirit
[1:19:31] and the holy spirit is the only one
[1:19:34] who can revere it for it is head from
[1:19:38] the eyes of the wise and the pudding
[1:19:42] and it is revealed to babies such as
[1:19:45] will learn
[1:19:47] so if you don't watch
[1:19:50] if you don't use the mind of the spirit
[1:19:53] of the holy spirit to put it together
[1:19:56] you will have your sin all mixed up
[1:20:00] praise the lord amen
[1:20:03] for instance like like a cow picking
[1:20:06] grass on top of a tree
[1:20:08] and and and just like that praise the
[1:20:11] lord
[1:20:12] and all of that and i mean and we can go
[1:20:15] on and on
[1:20:16] and and uh you know and build this
[1:20:19] picture
[1:20:20] and uh all you know read on what brother
[1:20:24] branham talk about a great picture and
[1:20:26] over and over
[1:20:26] having a lot of quotes down here but it
[1:20:28] will take all of our time
[1:20:30] so we we realized that when you think
[1:20:33] about that
[1:20:34] when you think about that think about
[1:20:37] the life
[1:20:38] of our father abraham amen
[1:20:41] god promised him to be the father
[1:20:45] of nations praise the lord
[1:20:48] the father of nations and abraham in his
[1:20:52] mind
[1:20:52] whatever the way that he received that
[1:20:56] that message from god taught that it was
[1:20:59] going to happen tomorrow
[1:21:03] you know and brother branham would
[1:21:04] dramatize how the wayne he and his wife
[1:21:07] the shopping the guy everything for the
[1:21:08] baby
[1:21:09] and and all of that and and uh you know
[1:21:13] and
[1:21:13] and they got themselves ready i mean uh
[1:21:16] uh
[1:21:16] uh uh whatever time they got married
[1:21:19] they were happy and excited to have
[1:21:21] their first child
[1:21:25] but god in his mind wanting abraham to
[1:21:28] be
[1:21:29] the father of nations he
[1:21:32] he had a big picture
[1:21:36] and abraham's side
[1:21:40] couldn't see the full picture
[1:21:44] praise the lord
[1:21:48] and i feel that's uh i feel them
[1:21:50] believing i think you believe the same
[1:21:52] thing with me
[1:21:53] that and that is the will with every one
[1:21:55] of us
[1:22:02] yeah we find ourselves coming to
[1:22:05] reality and understanding that god
[1:22:08] has placed us in a great drama
[1:22:16] and as we go on with life it keeps on
[1:22:19] falling
[1:22:21] and new things we keep learning of
[1:22:23] ourselves
[1:22:26] some things comes and we are so
[1:22:28] surprised that we can even do it
[1:22:31] i've never never even thought i could do
[1:22:36] it
[1:22:40] praise the lord amen
[1:22:44] we ain't a great drama on people
[1:22:48] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:22:50] says we can never use
[1:22:52] this our human brain he liking it onto a
[1:22:55] canary brain
[1:22:58] to understand the ways of god
[1:23:02] for his ways our past finding out
[1:23:08] praise the lord his ways are past
[1:23:11] finding out
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:19] water baptism he says well that's the
[1:23:21] way the bible wrote between the lines
[1:23:26] you know of many of my salmon like
[1:23:31] of god turning abraham and sarah back to
[1:23:34] young people you have to read between
[1:23:38] the line to see how what the scripture
[1:23:41] says
[1:23:43] you you have to know but it will never
[1:23:46] get
[1:23:47] off of line
[1:23:50] see in between the line will just
[1:23:53] bring the line together and make
[1:23:57] one big picture now it got to be a love
[1:24:01] effect
[1:24:02] for uh with god before you can ever get
[1:24:05] it cause the holy spirit wrote the bible
[1:24:08] and the bible says that is of no
[1:24:11] private interpretation now let's get
[1:24:14] back to the scripture that we
[1:24:16] read here in john chapter nine we all
[1:24:19] know the story this
[1:24:20] is child bomb blind you know when and uh
[1:24:24] uh he's out there begging for arms and
[1:24:28] and uh i mean you you think about this
[1:24:32] tribe on blind you you think about
[1:24:35] uh you know uh uh the the the
[1:24:38] the family that we are born in you think
[1:24:41] about
[1:24:41] you know uh uh some situations that we
[1:24:45] have found ourselves in that was not
[1:24:47] our choice praise the lord
[1:24:51] it was no choice of this child to be
[1:24:54] born
[1:24:56] praise the lord as much as
[1:25:00] it was no choice of us to be born in the
[1:25:03] family that we
[1:25:04] we find ourselves in or to be born from
[1:25:06] the nations
[1:25:07] or to be born with some uh uh
[1:25:10] uh some less abilities that we have
[1:25:18] praise the lord
[1:25:26] then we realized that uh he was he was
[1:25:29] born on a
[1:25:30] a religious system you know that uh
[1:25:33] that has drifted from the word of god
[1:25:35] and they have got their own private
[1:25:37] interpretation
[1:25:39] you know that is uh uh i mean
[1:25:42] a sickness is because of sin
[1:25:45] well you see that uh uh
[1:25:49] that interpretation is not is not all
[1:25:52] together wrong
[1:25:55] just like the interpretation sometimes
[1:25:58] that we put to things in our lives it's
[1:26:01] not all together wrong
[1:26:04] but it's not the full picture
[1:26:08] amen the way we interpret things of our
[1:26:11] life
[1:26:11] and the way we interpret things of other
[1:26:13] people's life when they are going
[1:26:15] through things
[1:26:16] it's not all together wrong because what
[1:26:18] you're doing is that you're using your
[1:26:20] knowledge that you have from the
[1:26:21] scripture the scripture says this
[1:26:23] and because the person did this or
[1:26:25] because i did this that's what this is
[1:26:27] happening to me
[1:26:29] the bible says you will reap while you
[1:26:30] saw oh my goodness
[1:26:32] because i did this that's what is
[1:26:34] happening to me but we know
[1:26:36] in the big picture god allowed that to
[1:26:39] build
[1:26:39] character in our lives
[1:26:44] praise the lord because he said in his
[1:26:47] word that he's
[1:26:48] faithful and just to forgive us when we
[1:26:51] confess of our sin
[1:26:54] praise the lord and then if he forgive
[1:26:57] us then why should we go
[1:26:58] through a trying time
[1:27:06] praise the lord looking
[1:27:10] at the bigger picture
[1:27:14] glory be to god so we see here that uh
[1:27:18] you know what i i mean uh uh can you
[1:27:22] imagine going to a church and
[1:27:24] and and then the pastor just keep
[1:27:27] re-echoing that and you have had it out
[1:27:29] of your life
[1:27:30] you know uh i mean uh
[1:27:33] uh uh maybe uh you were you were not
[1:27:36] faithful enough and
[1:27:38] and that's the reason why your your
[1:27:40] child was born blind and
[1:27:42] you know and every time the preacher
[1:27:44] gets on on talking about sickness he
[1:27:47] he connects us and then he's looking
[1:27:49] right in your eyes and he's telling you
[1:27:53] praise the lord
[1:27:56] amen and that that has
[1:28:00] it has the ability for
[1:28:03] a parent to distinct themselves or
[1:28:06] or or separate themselves from their
[1:28:08] child because
[1:28:09] they are looking at that child as a
[1:28:12] product of sin
[1:28:17] praise the lord they are looking at the
[1:28:20] child
[1:28:21] whereby it's not even the child choice
[1:28:25] to be here
[1:28:28] was your love choice that brought him
[1:28:30] but now because this thing is
[1:28:32] is is happening to them all because
[1:28:36] the preacher in his narrow brain has
[1:28:39] has attributed sin to this child
[1:28:42] so now the child is put in a situation
[1:28:49] praise the lord
[1:28:53] glory be to god oh you see that
[1:28:58] you see that time and time again
[1:29:01] sometimes some people are dealing with
[1:29:03] situations in their lives you know
[1:29:06] they get so mild with this person guess
[1:29:09] who might with another person
[1:29:10] and and then if there is a child that is
[1:29:14] involved they start getting mad with the
[1:29:16] child because they are angry with that
[1:29:18] person
[1:29:20] praise the lord you know they start
[1:29:23] getting mad with this innocent child
[1:29:26] you know i don't even know where your
[1:29:29] father is
[1:29:31] don't be giving me hell don't get me
[1:29:33] hurt
[1:29:35] when the child never did anything to you
[1:29:38] but because of the wrong that has
[1:29:40] happened
[1:29:44] the child now has to deal with that the
[1:29:46] child has to suffer
[1:29:48] for there that's just how narrow
[1:29:53] our the the vision of our mind
[1:29:56] is
[1:30:04] praise the lord
[1:30:09] i mean that that that that is not only
[1:30:11] in uh
[1:30:12] in uh uh a man in a woman relationship
[1:30:16] it also happened i mean uh uh you know
[1:30:19] uh
[1:30:19] two men will get into disagreement and
[1:30:22] then
[1:30:22] uh uh they take it on the children
[1:30:26] sure don't come on my property
[1:30:30] you kids don't come on my property
[1:30:34] come and play your boy when those
[1:30:36] children don't have
[1:30:37] anything to do with it
[1:30:42] that's a short sightiness
[1:30:48] praise the lord
[1:30:53] the same if i would disagree with a man
[1:30:56] and think that you will be in sin
[1:31:01] to leave this church and go and
[1:31:03] fellowship there
[1:31:07] praise the lord because i don't agree
[1:31:09] with your brother and says
[1:31:10] you don't have to go to that church you
[1:31:13] are completely out of the word of god
[1:31:15] you're walking down to hell
[1:31:17] if you ever leave this church and go
[1:31:19] somewhere else
[1:31:26] praise the lord
[1:31:35] but that's that's just how you know uh
[1:31:41] the human side is praise the lord
[1:31:46] that's how the human side is you know we
[1:31:49] we read a scripture or we find a cult
[1:31:52] and then we we i mean it bless our heart
[1:31:55] we get so inspired by it and not able to
[1:31:58] put
[1:31:59] all the cults of the prophet together
[1:32:02] all the scripture together
[1:32:03] we just hold that one court and take a
[1:32:06] stand
[1:32:10] she said you know what the prophet said
[1:32:12] it i have the court
[1:32:13] i can show it to you
[1:32:18] praise the lord but it's written
[1:32:24] also
[1:32:26] you have to remember that was jesus
[1:32:28] answer to the devil
[1:32:30] it's written also
[1:32:36] praise the lord so if you find one quote
[1:32:39] you must realize
[1:32:40] always tell yourself it's written also
[1:32:45] maybe i have not seen the also yet but
[1:32:47] it's written also
[1:32:52] oh praise the lord amen
[1:32:55] glory be to god somebody is slowing me
[1:32:57] down but it's okay
[1:33:00] praise the lord but you see that's that
[1:33:04] was the problem they had here
[1:33:07] you know they got so stuck in the lord
[1:33:09] and they put this interpretation to the
[1:33:12] lord
[1:33:12] you know when and uh yeah even at the
[1:33:15] place where
[1:33:17] now the uh uh the boy has received his
[1:33:20] side
[1:33:21] the parents could not even come to his
[1:33:23] defense
[1:33:25] because they were so affected the high
[1:33:28] side was so
[1:33:29] affected by wrong thinking
[1:33:34] and wrong teaching that it could not
[1:33:36] even come to their son
[1:33:38] defense
[1:33:44] they said go and ask him he's off age
[1:33:49] and he can talk for himself
[1:33:58] praise the lord and sometimes that's
[1:34:02] i mean it's it becomes so difficult
[1:34:07] when the enemy have affected our
[1:34:10] our spiritual side
[1:34:14] that sometimes is it's not it's
[1:34:17] difficult for us to see
[1:34:21] even what the lord has done for us on
[1:34:24] calvary
[1:34:26] on calvary he answered the same question
[1:34:30] on calvary he paid the price
[1:34:35] on calvary he said it is finished
[1:34:39] but sometimes we are so affected in our
[1:34:42] spirit
[1:34:43] that is hard for us to see what is
[1:34:46] finished at cavalry
[1:34:49] and the things that he have paid for at
[1:34:52] calvary
[1:34:53] but branham says this great picture was
[1:34:55] from eden all the way to calvary
[1:34:57] and when it gets back to calvary it's
[1:34:59] taking us back to eating
[1:35:02] [Laughter]
[1:35:04] a cover every time in space
[1:35:09] praise the lord but that was the problem
[1:35:13] the problem
[1:35:14] actually was a sight problem
[1:35:17] so jesus year dealing with the pharisees
[1:35:22] he tried to identify what their problem
[1:35:24] is
[1:35:27] praise the lord amen
[1:35:30] he's trying here to make them to realize
[1:35:33] that they are short-sighted you realize
[1:35:37] that
[1:35:37] uh in matthew uh chapter four chapter 5
[1:35:41] jesus said unto them it is written in
[1:35:44] the lord
[1:35:48] praise the lord thou shall not commit
[1:35:52] adultery he says but i
[1:35:56] say unto you amen
[1:36:00] it's written in the lord thou shalt not
[1:36:04] do this but i say unto you
[1:36:08] and the bible says after that simon he
[1:36:11] says wow
[1:36:14] what a strange doctrine
[1:36:17] who is he for him to say i say unto you
[1:36:23] praise the lord why because they taught
[1:36:26] the high they had the lord they thought
[1:36:29] they were righteous keep us of the lord
[1:36:32] they had everything that moses said
[1:36:36] but now he's coming and bringing a
[1:36:39] bigger picture
[1:36:44] praise the lord
[1:36:51] so we realized that that was the problem
[1:36:53] they had it was a sight
[1:36:55] problem glory be to god
[1:37:00] and then we can see here that
[1:37:05] you think about it there in genesis
[1:37:07] chapter 3 the bible says
[1:37:09] adam our father
[1:37:14] and our mother eat the word in eden
[1:37:17] praise the lord for adam to be able to
[1:37:21] give the name to
[1:37:22] all the animals and it will just
[1:37:26] please god so which means
[1:37:29] he had the ability to see
[1:37:33] what was in the heart of the father
[1:37:37] he had such a an eyesight
[1:37:42] that he could choose a name and say you
[1:37:44] are lying and god said that's exactly
[1:37:46] what i would have named me
[1:37:51] he has such an eyesight that he could
[1:37:53] see
[1:37:54] right the desire of the father
[1:38:00] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:38:04] amen but when
[1:38:08] sin was introduced
[1:38:11] another eyesight was introduced
[1:38:15] but ram said thank you man's felt they
[1:38:17] lost the holy veil
[1:38:21] amen and they had another our side the
[1:38:24] bible says
[1:38:26] they were naked and they never knew now
[1:38:28] they know that they are naked
[1:38:30] praise the lord so they are thinking
[1:38:33] that
[1:38:34] they are now seeing better
[1:38:39] than the way they used to see you see
[1:38:41] the way that adam was seen it was
[1:38:44] through
[1:38:44] a spiritual sense brother branham called
[1:38:46] the sixth sense
[1:38:47] he was seen as truth as spiritual sins
[1:38:50] that connected him to the heart of the
[1:38:52] father
[1:38:53] that whatever he does the father was
[1:38:56] okay
[1:38:58] now he's cracked from the sexes
[1:39:04] and all he can see is colors
[1:39:08] and shapes
[1:39:12] all you can see now is color and shapes
[1:39:20] no more he can see to the heart of the
[1:39:24] father
[1:39:30] praise the lord
[1:39:34] say this is tall this
[1:39:37] is shot this is green this is blue
[1:39:42] and now to him with the natural
[1:39:46] eyes that is filling he said
[1:39:50] wow
[1:39:53] wow what a sight
[1:40:00] glory be to god amen you see why
[1:40:05] the mysteries of god was revealed is to
[1:40:08] take our eyesight
[1:40:11] back to the heart of the father
[1:40:16] praise the lord we can for us so see
[1:40:18] those things
[1:40:20] that we please the father praise the
[1:40:23] lord
[1:40:24] amen we might never uh
[1:40:27] be able to uh geologically place it
[1:40:30] right
[1:40:32] but there is something in the heart of
[1:40:34] the believer that is longing to please
[1:40:37] god a man i know seven
[1:40:41] you know the the the seventh week of
[1:40:43] daniam and i know the seven seals and
[1:40:45] the church ages
[1:40:47] but there is just something in the heart
[1:40:48] of the believer
[1:40:51] that is longing to please god
[1:40:54] if i can just want to find my place if i
[1:40:57] can be positionally in christ
[1:40:59] if i can do those things that would
[1:41:02] please god
[1:41:04] amen glory to his name
[1:41:08] that was that's the reason of the new
[1:41:10] birth
[1:41:12] to give us the original sight
[1:41:15] the sight that adam wants heart
[1:41:20] praise the lord amen
[1:41:23] and that's the reason why you see
[1:41:25] through the scripture
[1:41:26] jesus and the apostles through the
[1:41:28] scripture they connected the eyesight
[1:41:32] with the heart
[1:41:40] praise the lord
[1:41:44] oh my what a time we are living in
[1:41:49] what an age that we are living in glory
[1:41:52] be to god
[1:41:56] you know the devil knows have a saints
[1:42:02] he knows the promises that are in the
[1:42:04] world

[1:42:09] turn the hearts of the fathers the
[1:42:11] children back to the hearts of the
[1:42:13] fathers
[1:42:15] amen it's turning our faith turning our
[1:42:18] sight
[1:42:20] giving us desire to seek for the
[1:42:24] pentecostal blessing
[1:42:40] for you know what he planned to do in
[1:42:42] our age
[1:42:43] he said i'm going to bring them exactly
[1:42:48] what would distract them you have to
[1:42:51] remember brother branham says we are in
[1:42:53] the ih
[1:42:56] this is the i age he says there is
[1:42:58] nothing above the eye
[1:43:02] amen he says that's the highest
[1:43:04] intelligence
[1:43:05] after the eye he sees the brain in in
[1:43:08] all of that
[1:43:09] yeah in the message thinking man federer
[1:43:11] he says
[1:43:12] we are in the seeing age the top
[1:43:16] there is no more faculty above that
[1:43:20] that you can move out wally to know
[1:43:24] and your outward body there is no
[1:43:27] faculty above the eye
[1:43:30] praise the lord he says
[1:43:35] you know from your nose you can smell
[1:43:38] your lip you can speak your hands
[1:43:42] you can feel and reach your feet and so
[1:43:46] forth

[1:44:03] and it shall be light in the evening
[1:44:07] time

[1:44:12] he explained it like this in the message
[1:44:15] christ has revealed in his own word
[1:44:17] he says when god gave the the dream to
[1:44:20] dani i mean
[1:44:21] nebuchadnezzar the dream that daniel
[1:44:24] interpreted
[1:44:25] god gave him a dream and the emphasis on
[1:44:28] the dream was
[1:44:29] uh was from the head of god to the
[1:44:32] to the fourth the toes of clay and iron
[1:44:35] and god was presenting a a a
[1:44:39] gentile kingdom praise the lord
[1:44:43] and and we know the head of god
[1:44:46] was babylon and and and we know
[1:44:49] the the medians were were the savior
[1:44:52] and we know that the greeks came the
[1:44:54] brass and
[1:44:55] and and then the roman empire is dying
[1:44:59] praise the lord and papa rome and pagan
[1:45:02] rome is the iron and clay
[1:45:05] now and he says in that vision
[1:45:09] there was a stone that was caught out of
[1:45:12] the mountain
[1:45:14] which of course that stone was christ
[1:45:16] the revelation of god
[1:45:18] and in in in in a dream the stone
[1:45:23] crash the image in the legs
[1:45:27] praise the lord amen and then he says
[1:45:31] from that time god started
[1:45:34] building another image
[1:45:38] but it was a spiritual image coming from
[1:45:41] the foot
[1:45:47] praise the lord amen that's the reason
[1:45:50] why
[1:45:51] we have the great missionary age
[1:45:54] after pentecost amen
[1:45:58] they were carrying the gospel everywhere
[1:46:00] because god was coming from the feet
[1:46:04] praise the lord and right in california
[1:46:08] azuza
[1:46:10] god came to the mouth with the gifts of
[1:46:13] tongues coming back to the church
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:22] oh praise the lord and then after the
[1:46:26] azusa revival
[1:46:29] we are back to the ih
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:36] praise the lord we are back toward the
[1:46:38] ih
[1:46:41] the prophetic age
[1:46:45] are we together
[1:46:48] christ is the minister i mean christ is
[1:46:50] revealed in his own word for jesus
[1:46:52] himself is the interpretation of the
[1:46:54] bible when he made a manifest in the age
[1:46:57] he made a manifest in the age
[1:47:01] that the part of the body of the part of
[1:47:04] the body
[1:47:05] is being made manifest
[1:47:08] which means he brought the word he
[1:47:10] brought the word and the anointing
[1:47:12] to the age at the time that part of the
[1:47:15] body was being manifest
[1:47:17] so in the faith age he anointed those
[1:47:20] men to go on
[1:47:21] herself and burghead the wall for hours
[1:47:23] to carry the gospel
[1:47:25] because that was the feed age they could
[1:47:27] go anywhere
[1:47:34] are we together that part of the body
[1:47:38] if it's the hand it must be the hand
[1:47:41] it can be
[1:47:45] the hair age if it's the voice age
[1:47:50] he says it can be the footage and now
[1:47:55] we are at the ih
[1:47:59] and now the next is
[1:48:04] him himself to come
[1:48:08] seeing prophetic
[1:48:12] praise the lord remember we're talking
[1:48:15] about looking
[1:48:16] at the bigger picture
[1:48:19] praise the lord with people finding
[1:48:22] problems with the message and problem
[1:48:24] with brother branham and problem
[1:48:26] with message people then problem is
[1:48:29] because
[1:48:30] lao disher has got to blindness
[1:48:38] and when a person is getting the
[1:48:39] blindness slowly your eyesight
[1:48:42] is going slowly
[1:48:46] people around the message their eyesight
[1:48:48] is going
[1:48:49] the things that they never used to allow
[1:48:51] the beginning to allow it
[1:48:57] slowly they are losing their eyesight
[1:49:01] that's the reason why we become so
[1:49:04] critical
[1:49:06] instead of looking at the bigger picture
[1:49:11] praise the lord mercy is for us alone
[1:49:15] now for the next person
[1:49:19] now for the next person
[1:49:29] see down through the age we started
[1:49:32] off from the foundation from the first
[1:49:35] church
[1:49:35] age when the seed went to the ground
[1:49:40] the complete seat and then it comes
[1:49:42] through the feet looter
[1:49:46] come back out through wesley
[1:49:49] and then pentecostal the tongue edge the
[1:49:52] lip
[1:49:52] see now it is
[1:49:57] now is in the eyes prophetic of malachi
[1:50:00] 4 and so forth and now there is
[1:50:03] nothing else left
[1:50:07] for it to come but he himself
[1:50:11] to step into that amen
[1:50:16] praise the lord
[1:50:19] so we see all of these things
[1:50:23] he says the next is the intelligence and
[1:50:25] we
[1:50:26] and we have no intelligence of our own
[1:50:28] is his
[1:50:30] we have no sight of our own
[1:50:33] how can a man foresee these things
[1:50:36] how can he do it praise the lord
[1:50:40] going back to a person
[1:50:43] life when they were born when you were
[1:50:46] just
[1:50:46] a small girl you got frightened by the
[1:50:50] dog that's the reason why
[1:50:52] all of your life you be nervous
[1:50:56] praise the lord
[1:51:00] the same intelligence that adam had
[1:51:04] that could go right back to the heart of
[1:51:06] the father
[1:51:11] praise the lord god has sent that
[1:51:15] intelligence
[1:51:17] to give us a picture of our life
[1:51:21] while we went through the things that we
[1:51:23] went through in our life
[1:51:25] why different things happen for us to be
[1:51:28] able to look at the bigger picture
[1:51:31] and raise our hands and say thank you
[1:51:33] jesus
[1:51:43] praise the lord
[1:51:49] what an intelligence
[1:51:53] how can a man foresee those things how
[1:51:55] can he do it
[1:51:56] is god himself is becoming to a place
[1:52:04] and he's governed the body all the way
[1:52:07] through
[1:52:08] then the complete body of christ is
[1:52:10] revealed
[1:52:11] in the form of a bride
[1:52:15] that was taken out of his side like adam
[1:52:19] praise the lord amen
[1:52:25] what a picture
[1:52:28] what a picture
[1:52:33] praise the lord
[1:52:37] i mean seeing the big picture
[1:52:43] praise the lord
[1:52:57] i was following the documentary of
[1:53:00] of uh
[1:53:04] two boys that were born of the same
[1:53:06] parent
[1:53:08] one father their father
[1:53:11] was was an american
[1:53:14] and their mother was a polish woman
[1:53:18] i think he was he was a u.s soldier down
[1:53:21] there
[1:53:22] and then he left
[1:53:26] and and the lady found herself to have a
[1:53:29] child
[1:53:30] and uh and they were born and because of
[1:53:34] the poor condition of life
[1:53:36] they were separated into different
[1:53:40] uh homes for adoption praise the lord
[1:53:46] you know when and uh
[1:53:50] as as he grew up you know the other one
[1:53:54] was he's he was you you you have this
[1:53:57] hurt
[1:53:58] you know you have this this
[1:54:00] disappointment
[1:54:02] you know in your heart what what
[1:54:03] happened what went wrong
[1:54:06] that my parents have to give me offer
[1:54:08] adoption and there is there is not
[1:54:10] there is not enough information
[1:54:14] and you just go with this hunting hurt
[1:54:17] in your heart
[1:54:19] you never know it until you've been
[1:54:20] there
[1:54:23] praise the lord
[1:54:28] and uh after some years they were older
[1:54:30] i mean all the in
[1:54:32] in i think their late sixties or so when
[1:54:35] he got
[1:54:36] uh united and one uh
[1:54:39] came from california he went to meet his
[1:54:41] brother in
[1:54:42] in in poland praise the lord
[1:54:46] and then after i mean with all the
[1:54:48] connection and he gave them all the the
[1:54:50] information
[1:54:52] you know as they put the picture
[1:54:55] together
[1:54:58] and the other older gentleman
[1:55:02] he started to weep because now he
[1:55:05] understood why his mother had to give
[1:55:09] him offer adoption
[1:55:11] because of the difficult condition of
[1:55:13] life that she was living in
[1:55:18] having the full picture brought him to
[1:55:21] the place
[1:55:25] and you could tell that there was a
[1:55:28] sense
[1:55:29] of bitterness in him
[1:55:35] so i mean thought of hating his parents
[1:55:39] why they ever brought him on earth
[1:55:44] just for him to grow up and realize that
[1:55:46] the people that he thought was his
[1:55:48] parents were not he perry then where my
[1:55:49] parents
[1:55:50] are
[1:55:53] but with all of those years 60 plus
[1:55:56] years
[1:55:58] when he stands to put the picture
[1:55:59] together he wept like a baby
[1:56:04] and he wept like a baby and and starts
[1:56:07] to appreciate his mother
[1:56:15] sometimes you have to see the bigger
[1:56:16] picture
[1:56:19] for you to appreciate the god of heaven
[1:56:21] and earth
[1:56:24] praise the lord the other one says
[1:56:29] no wonder i always just love
[1:56:32] america
[1:56:36] he says no one i just love america
[1:56:38] because i think when he grew up
[1:56:40] he he wanted to travel to america he
[1:56:43] said because that's where my father came
[1:56:44] from
[1:56:47] oh that's why we love heaven
[1:56:56] but sometimes you have to see the bigger
[1:56:58] picture
[1:57:02] for you to appreciate that
[1:57:10] never be to god
[1:57:15] you know we go to school and and
[1:57:17] sometimes we think uh
[1:57:19] uh you know because we have got out of
[1:57:21] high school to college we're now so
[1:57:23] smart
[1:57:25] we can just put things together
[1:57:28] praise the lord oh i see why this
[1:57:32] happened oh i see why this happened and
[1:57:33] then we gave
[1:57:34] ourselves an explanation
[1:57:39] sometimes it puts us into a place of a
[1:57:42] very bad attitude
[1:57:44] we become critical we become judge
[1:57:46] mentor
[1:57:51] because we have fared our mind with a
[1:57:54] very narrow picture
[1:57:59] with a very narrow picture the picture
[1:58:01] that is not even from your eyes it does
[1:58:02] not even go
[1:58:03] over your nose
[1:58:06] we feed our mind with that
[1:58:10] and then we start to see the word true
[1:58:12] dead
[1:58:14] we start to judge people through
[1:58:18] that narrow vision praise the lord
[1:58:22] short sightedness you ever see somebody
[1:58:25] so short-sighted they have to read their
[1:58:27] read their bible like this
[1:58:34] that's how many christians many
[1:58:36] believers has become
[1:58:39] like even when brother branham talks
[1:58:41] about the bride he talks about the
[1:58:42] foolish virgin
[1:58:43] he talks about the different groups the
[1:58:46] different groups
[1:58:48] in god's redemption plan
[1:58:53] praise the lord
[1:58:56] sometimes our short-sightedness just put
[1:58:59] us to the place
[1:59:01] where we think that we are above the
[1:59:05] word
[1:59:05] we are the bride of jesus christ so
[1:59:08] every other christian group
[1:59:11] they are the nomination birds they are
[1:59:13] bound for help for help
[1:59:20] and it just gave us a wrong attitude it
[1:59:30] just gave
[1:59:30] us a wrong attitude
[1:59:34] showing that we got the whole picture
[1:59:36] wrong
[1:59:39] and sometimes with those wrong attitude
[1:59:42] and wrong
[1:59:43] perception we have we kick ourselves out
[1:59:46] of god's mercy
[1:59:53] because if you don't have the bigger
[1:59:55] picture there is no way you can
[1:59:57] appreciate
[1:59:58] the mercy of god there's no way you can
[2:00:02] appreciate what this message
[2:00:03] is
[2:00:10] because you're born in a message home by
[2:00:13] message parents you went to message
[2:00:14] church that's all you know
[2:00:21] until you get the bigger picture you can
[2:00:24] never
[2:00:24] appreciate the privilege that you have
[2:00:29] because let me tell you to every
[2:00:31] privilege
[2:00:32] there is a responsibility that comes
[2:00:34] with it
[2:00:39] to every privilege there is a
[2:00:42] responsibility
[2:00:43] that comes with it that's why jesus was
[2:00:46] telling those pharisees
[2:00:48] if you were blind it would have been
[2:00:51] better for you
[2:00:55] there will be no judgment against you
[2:00:56] because you don't know anything
[2:01:00] praise the lord but because you claim
[2:01:04] you can see
[2:01:05] you claim that you are born in a message
[2:01:07] and you are the bride
[2:01:10] he says there is a responsibility that
[2:01:13] comes with that
[2:01:22] praise the lord seeing the bigger
[2:01:25] picture
[2:01:27] oh my goodness a picture that runs you
[2:01:30] you think
[2:01:31] think think about all of this man david
[2:01:36] look at david life
[2:01:39] he was so happy with his slingshot and
[2:01:41] and being the shepherd ball
[2:01:45] but in the back part of god's mind when
[2:01:47] god out of the mark
[2:01:49] of jacob he said the scepter will be
[2:01:53] in judah when god allowed
[2:01:56] jacob to prophesy that david was
[2:01:59] in the back part of god's mind
[2:02:03] david was in that picture
[2:02:07] praise the lord and you ever say he
[2:02:09] never knew nothing about that
[2:02:14] out there taking care of his father's
[2:02:16] sheep

[2:02:20] christ is a myth
[2:02:21] i mean christ is revealed in his own
[2:02:23] word and brother brandon i'm talking
[2:02:24] about that
[2:02:25] how god give a man
[2:02:28] a nature david just loved sheeps

[2:02:40] right from birth
[2:02:46] he never had no i thought of that
[2:02:49] picture
[2:02:51] but that was the thing that was driving
[2:02:53] his life
[2:03:00] and the thing that is driving your life
[2:03:03] is because of your position
[2:03:06] in the great picture of god
[2:03:10] the thing that is driving you closer to
[2:03:12] god and driving you
[2:03:14] to church and giving you the desire to
[2:03:17] live right
[2:03:18] is because in the big picture of god he
[2:03:21] has placed you somewhere
[2:03:22] as a son of god as a daughter of god

[2:04:13] the face

[2:04:31] in the big picture
[2:04:35] praise the lord
[2:04:40] glory be to god

[2:16:07] happened in our lives that you feel so
[2:16:09] disappointed
[2:16:12] you feel so disappointed so hurt how

[2:16:32] why we are here
[2:16:33] amen praise the lord
[2:16:37] that's why we are here
[2:16:40] glory be to god amen
[2:16:45] but at least david knew that that was
[2:16:47] not the end of the day
[2:16:49] he sat in the house there with uh with
[2:16:52] uh uh
[2:16:52] uh sword and they bringing him food in
[2:16:56] the morning
[2:16:57] in order serving him in this life is so
[2:17:00] strange to him

[2:17:04] mean the message
[2:17:06] oh my goodness is this the opportunity
[2:17:08] that comes being in the message
[2:17:13] praise the lord amen
[2:17:17] it was not too long he realized that the
[2:17:19] fellowship became a battleship
[2:17:26] and sword is throwing javelins at him
[2:17:33] in the message
[2:17:38] any message oh my goodness
[2:17:42] oh my goodness
[2:17:45] i think he was rubbing his eyes am i
[2:17:47] seeing am i really seeing is this
[2:17:49] happening to me
[2:17:53] glory be to god
[2:17:58] at this stage of life he's so happy
[2:18:02] he's been treated as a prince
[2:18:06] but when his days of trial started
[2:18:10] then he started remembering the days of
[2:18:12] a shepherd boy
[2:18:14] running over the hills
[2:18:18] running over the hills and the mountains
[2:18:25] he thought he could he would never get
[2:18:27] back to that life again
[2:18:29] he thought the days of being a shepherd
[2:18:32] boy is over
[2:18:33] i don't have to sleep in the field now i
[2:18:35] have beds and i have people that i can
[2:18:37] ring their bell
[2:18:38] they can bring me food they'll change my
[2:18:40] blankets and
[2:18:41] everything
[2:18:46] but when god turned another page
[2:18:52] in the great program he was in the field
[2:18:55] running
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:19:02] in a bigger picture he was running
[2:19:09] he's back again sleeping under the
[2:19:11] moonlight
[2:19:13] looking for caves
[2:19:16] praise the lord
[2:19:20] as much as god use a shepherd life
[2:19:25] to teach him how to fight and be brave
[2:19:28] god
[2:19:28] also used a shepherd light to teach him
[2:19:31] how to run from danger
[2:19:35] [Music]
[2:19:40] you know when you get a burger and you
[2:19:43] put all the things in it to eat
[2:19:46] and you eat that burger
[2:19:49] god pulls something down in your body
[2:19:52] that distribute the nutrients
[2:19:56] praise the lord and that's the same way
[2:19:59] god does spiritually
[2:20:00] everything he takes you true
[2:20:07] he knows how to break down that
[2:20:09] nutrients
[2:20:11] a time for you to be happy and the time
[2:20:14] to
[2:20:15] to be silent
[2:20:20] praise the lord
[2:20:24] david i was not a prince and being fed
[2:20:26] his back picking up stones
[2:20:29] throwing it in the head all that is
[2:20:30] running to his mind
[2:20:32] is the days of his shepherd boy
[2:20:38] he praise the lord
[2:20:41] even the men around him could not even
[2:20:43] understand
[2:20:45] how can a king be so speedy on the
[2:20:48] mountains
[2:20:51] it was in his days of tutorship when god
[2:20:54] was training him
[2:20:58] praise the lord sometimes the things
[2:21:01] that god
[2:21:01] allow us to go through is just for only
[2:21:05] one purpose
[2:21:08] and god will take us through all of
[2:21:10] these things in our life
[2:21:12] think about john the baptist going to
[2:21:13] the wilderness at nine years old
[2:21:17] and nine years old boy going to the
[2:21:19] wilderness
[2:21:22] coming out at 30 years old only for
[2:21:26] a six-month ministry
[2:21:35] you look at it and says all the people
[2:21:38] in that church they were so
[2:21:40] wicked they couldn't even remember
[2:21:42] zacharias
[2:21:44] the boy mother is there his father is
[2:21:46] dead
[2:21:47] they just left him to himself
[2:21:54] short sadness
[2:21:58] how could his parents allow him to go to
[2:22:00] the witherness
[2:22:01] and i mean we we can put all our
[2:22:03] interpretation to it
[2:22:05] but it was god's way of
[2:22:08] building a man
[2:22:13] for his place in the bigger picture
[2:22:24] praise the lord
[2:22:28] oh looking at the bigger picture
[2:22:31] we can talk about it we can talk about
[2:22:33] it we can sing about it
[2:22:38] it would take eternity to bring us the
[2:22:40] fullness
[2:22:42] praise the lord there are things
[2:22:45] that we will never even understand in
[2:22:47] this life
[2:22:49] it will take us before his throne
[2:22:54] to bring us the fullness
[2:22:58] praise the lord some of the things you
[2:23:01] think about in your life
[2:23:03] you just sit there and cry
[2:23:06] that day when the father starts to give
[2:23:08] you the full picture

[2:24:40] a god will allow
[2:24:41] his people to go under the hands of
[2:24:42] hitler
[2:24:44] and yet call them the people of god

[2:26:39] brother branham said christ is revealing
[2:26:41] his own word he says
[2:26:44] and they are going to find out someday
[2:26:48] that they are not seeing
[2:26:52] a hundred and fifty million years of
[2:26:55] light space either
[2:26:58] talking about science praise the lord
[2:27:02] they can put their telescope up there
[2:27:05] they can shine
[2:27:06] in the heavens i mean they can you know
[2:27:08] put it up there
[2:27:10] he says but one of these days they will
[2:27:14] realize
[2:27:17] they are not seeing the hundred fifty
[2:27:20] million years of life space
[2:27:24] they are going right
[2:27:27] around in cycles
[2:27:32] how are they going right around the
[2:27:33] cycle because
[2:27:35] they are using an instrument that they
[2:27:37] bail
[2:27:39] and they are looking at a dimension that
[2:27:42] is far from them
[2:27:44] praise the lord but that dimension is
[2:27:47] growing so fast that it looks like
[2:27:49] it's just instill
[2:27:53] it's almost like brother branham said
[2:27:55] when you look at the heavens in the
[2:27:56] night
[2:27:57] you see those stars the lord beautiful
[2:27:59] they look just like they are so close
[2:28:01] you see that one close to that one
[2:28:04] he says there is there is million miles
[2:28:07] of space
[2:28:08] between them but to you and myself
[2:28:12] when we look at them they look so close
[2:28:17] praise the lord so very branham says
[2:28:21] when they shoot
[2:28:21] uh uh their telescope or whatever they
[2:28:24] look up
[2:28:25] the it looks like that said 100 million
[2:28:28] miles
[2:28:30] he says but it's just going in cycle
[2:28:35] and it's growing so fast that the thing
[2:28:37] that they are seeing
[2:28:40] a lot of million years of space
[2:28:44] you are going to find that one of these
[2:28:46] days
[2:28:48] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[2:28:52] off
[2:28:52] somewhere else
[2:28:57] you are still right here
[2:29:05] just in another dimension faster
[2:29:12] just in another dimension faster
[2:29:16] praise the lord what make you to believe
[2:29:19] a god that you have not seen
[2:29:23] what is faith
[2:29:26] praise the lord what is faith
[2:29:30] faith is if i will call it the current
[2:29:34] or the speed
[2:29:36] that runs from a believer heart to the
[2:29:39] throne of god
[2:29:43] a connection that goes so fast
[2:29:46] praise the lord makes you to believe
[2:29:50] that
[2:29:51] he is here
[2:29:55] that's the connection
[2:29:59] that connect us with that word that is
[2:30:02] right around us
[2:30:07] praise the lord
[2:30:12] the faith the supernatural speed that is
[2:30:15] in the heart of the believer
[2:30:21] in a god caught up into it one day
[2:30:25] and he raptured him
[2:30:28] elijah got caught up into it one day and
[2:30:32] he was not
[2:30:35] and that same thing is going to sweep
[2:30:38] your bride away
[2:30:40] one of these things praise the lord
[2:30:46] amen such a speed
[2:30:56] we were talking about the word being
[2:30:58] powerful
[2:30:59] sharper than the two-edged sword
[2:31:02] that's what happens to the believer
[2:31:06] you know like when brother branham says
[2:31:08] walk in the light
[2:31:10] and see more unfold
[2:31:13] we have limited that to just
[2:31:15] understanding
[2:31:17] the more that we unfold is the more
[2:31:19] things we will understand
[2:31:21] but it's not just understanding
[2:31:24] the more that will unfold is to see how
[2:31:27] the world would change
[2:31:29] our life you'll find yourself loving god
[2:31:34] more than you used to love him
[2:31:35] you'll find yourself serving god more
[2:31:38] than you ever want to talk
[2:31:39] because while you are walking in the
[2:31:41] light
[2:31:44] more we unfall as you walk
[2:31:47] in the light more will unfold
[2:31:53] habits will be dropping off
[2:31:57] praise the lord anger will fly through
[2:32:00] the window
[2:32:02] and you will be looking for where it's
[2:32:04] gone as you walk
[2:32:06] in the light more we
[2:32:10] unfold praise the lord
[2:32:13] a social speed where god makes you to
[2:32:16] step
[2:32:17] out of your own nature
[2:32:20] praise the lord step out of your old
[2:32:23] nature
[2:32:28] when elijah rapture
[2:32:33] and his mental drop praise the lord
[2:32:40] think about jesus right there
[2:32:44] in the tomb resurrected god
[2:32:47] sucked out of the clothes he wore
[2:32:52] god sucked out of the clothes that's
[2:32:55] just how it is
[2:32:56] that's just how the old nature falls out
[2:32:59] god sucked you out
[2:33:00] it just falls out like shirt and pain
[2:33:05] just like when clothes fall from the
[2:33:07] hanging line
[2:33:09] when we walk in the light that's how the
[2:33:12] old nature falls off
[2:33:16] praise the lord you don't take it off
[2:33:18] like it was
[2:33:19] struck no no no it just fall off
[2:33:24] because the world has brought you a
[2:33:27] little bit higher
[2:33:29] [Music]
[2:33:30] come higher and as you come higher in
[2:33:33] the word
[2:33:35] in the love of god in the fellowship of
[2:33:38] jesus christ
[2:33:39] your old nature sinks down to the ground
[2:33:45] praise the lord brother branham says
[2:33:49] that we close on this
[2:33:50] sorry for keeping you amen
[2:33:55] you are going to find out one of these
[2:33:56] days
[2:33:58] that when you go to heaven you didn't
[2:33:59] fly somewhere else
[2:34:01] you are still right here too just
[2:34:05] in another dimension faster than this
[2:34:08] one
[2:34:10] praise the lord wednesday night we show
[2:34:12] you a little bit of that jesus
[2:34:15] resurrected that very same day he went
[2:34:18] to the throne of the father to present
[2:34:20] himself
[2:34:20] he came back that very same day and met
[2:34:23] those men on the road
[2:34:24] of emmaus he broke bread with them and
[2:34:27] then he left and met the rest of the
[2:34:28] disciples the very same day
[2:34:37] just another dimension faster than this
[2:34:40] one
[2:34:42] but you see when a believer gets on his
[2:34:45] way
[2:34:46] it slows down for you to catch up
[2:34:52] just like the airplane it slows down for
[2:34:55] you to catch up
[2:34:58] praise the lord
[2:35:02] right through this room is coming colors
[2:35:06] every color shirt dress whatever
[2:35:09] you got on his internal laying right
[2:35:14] on wrecker
[2:35:17] going through go going around and around
[2:35:20] the world
[2:35:22] the bible says the eyes of the lord move
[2:35:25] it through and forth
[2:35:27] every time you bap your eyes
[2:35:31] is right on record
[2:35:35] he says watch television prove that
[2:35:38] when you are born god set a record
[2:35:42] on

[3:00:50] bigger picture
[3:00:54] that is a way that's the way to find
[3:00:57] mercy with god
[3:01:00] you know when david was rejected and he
[3:01:03] was going down and that man spit in his
[3:01:06] face and david said leave him
[3:01:09] [Music]
[3:01:12] god has a bigger picture brother branham
[3:01:14] said christ is the minister of god
[3:01:16] revealed he says david found grace with
[3:01:18] god

[3:01:31] and every time

[3:01:59] took another man
[3:02:00] he had men in it he took the only one
[3:02:02] that this man had
[3:02:04] [Music]
[3:02:07] and david said man i've done that the
[3:02:09] man should die
[3:02:13] i will quick sense of judgment
[3:02:21] they always reveal our guilt
[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:26] when things happen and we become so
[3:02:29] quick
[3:02:30] to judge
[3:02:34] we become so quick to kick people out of
[3:02:37] the economy of god
[3:02:39] [Music]
[3:02:41] it shows a sense of guilt
[3:02:45] that you are holding because david
[3:02:48] wanted to prove himself a righteous king
[3:02:51] when in his heart
[3:02:53] [Music]
[3:02:55] he was guilty he couldn't even wait for
[3:02:58] the world to come out of neta mouth he
[3:03:00] says
[3:03:00] man i've done that that man should die
[3:03:04] and nathan said david you are the man
[3:03:07] right
[3:03:08] but you will not die
[3:03:18] but olivia was talking to brother
[3:03:20] brandon he says brother brandon how can
[3:03:21] you allow people to just say all sorts
[3:03:23] of things about you
[3:03:24] he said oh you know i know brother level
[3:03:26] he's a good teacher
[3:03:28] but he's so quick on the trigger
[3:03:31] and sometimes that's the way we are
[3:03:34] little things we just so quick on the
[3:03:35] trigger
[3:03:37] [Music]
[3:03:39] i need to express myself
[3:03:42] [Music]
[3:03:48] if you would just be able to get hold of
[3:03:50] yourself a little bit
[3:03:54] [Music]
[3:03:56] and say god has a bigger picture

[3:04:02] but lord i know you have a bigger
[3:04:04] picture

[3:04:08] when he said that thing to brother level

[3:04:12] that he says right there at a vision
[3:04:14] show on the wall
[3:04:16] there was something that he was he was
[3:04:18] praying about waiting for the lord
[3:04:20] he said right there because he found
[3:04:23] mercy with god
[3:04:24] when you find mercy with god he answered
[3:04:26] you quickly
[3:04:27] when you take the right answer you take
[3:04:29] the right choice you say the right thing
[3:04:33] when heather white said the right thing
[3:04:34] brother branham says ask whatever you
[3:04:36] will
[3:04:38] it please god when you find mercy with
[3:04:40] god
[3:04:41] when you take the right attitude
[3:04:47] when you just don't use your
[3:04:49] self-righteous brain
[3:04:51] to put people into it no
[3:04:54] say well i don't know i don't know why
[3:04:56] they did that
[3:04:58] but i think god knows all about it
[3:05:00] [Music]
[3:05:02] you are placing yourself in the hands of
[3:05:04] god and you are placing that person in
[3:05:07] the hands of god
