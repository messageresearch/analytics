sister beard i think that's concerning her oh brother is that the prayer request we prayed for yeah okay okay a loved one there over in nairobi that was not feeling well he's feeling much better praise the lord so we want to thank the lord for answering prayers praise the lord we serve a prayer to answer him amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you have your seat a little bit here then praise the lord we just want to read some uh or remind you or make coming like we will say then i heard brother hillary uh reading this uh concerning the the sisters prayer meeting it's just a sister's prayer meeting not from a sister's department women department amen now you have to remember that uh at the end of july we we taught a while that we were going to uh have couple of prayer meetings i make mention about the young people prayer meeting that we were planning we wanted to have a a kind of uh like a like an all night just for the young people amen that run from uh from a young age to 99 you know if you can stand the night but i've been thinking about it and what i don't want to do is uh just to i want to bring you together for us to have a good time in the lord for us to have fun enjoy ourselves because that's what we should do as children of god but i also you know we've been talking about watching our steps as we go into the presence of the lord so they have made me to be thinking over this and while we think about uh finding the time i thought we would have done it this gone weekend and i did a couple of uh hotel preparation because we were going to come together uh have a time to sleep i was going to seize your cell phones and all of that but uh uh i kind of forgive myself some few talked about it why now started uh a prayer meeting uh in around like a saturday afternoon and see how much you can pray and how much you want to pray than bringing you and having everybody falling asleep on me oh i would be so mad praise the lord so and couple of other few things to uh uh i mean thinking and i will make comment on that we sent out a text message also for the couple's uh meeting we were going to that we wanted to do unfortunately i've not got response from many of the the couples as expected so i'm going to put that one on hold as well i think uh you know in in some way i would not want to say that maybe the cost of twenty dollars is expensive i don't i don't believe so i just believe that uh you know uh maybe you did not pay attention to it but uh that is something we we do every year where we we bring all the couples together and then we can talk i mean the menu part of it is just the least part of it but the fellowship and and the prayer time that we have is is very important and then we had a we had a brothers meeting which of course you know even at the time of that meeting few attended others maybe they forgot or you know they were busy but the thing about it there is that we know that we are busy some way somehow but we expect you to let us know if you will not be in the meeting or something come up let us know because uh you know that is just how the muscle would feel if we if we send out a message and and we never let you know you will not be happy about it so uh and then sometimes you know it's just just in that moment uh i will always go back to my general text to copy everybody that is in and send the message out and you see uh one of the things that is the other you know as a church as as we've been trying to talk about a church this is uh through our redemption through the blood of jesus christ this is the the closest family we have praise the lord and and that the the like i've said over and over the successful church a church will be successful because uh right from exeter when god told the children of israel he says build a tabernacle because i want to come down the door them on you and i will make you a family of priests you know so god's principle is kingdom principle now we are born in this in this uh a word of is democracy you know we face political parties and his presidents and different nations but the kingdom of god is not like that you know the kingdom of god that's the reason why over and over yeah the kingdom of god was never lacking unto a nation the kingdom of god was never lacking unto a tribe the kingdom of god was always lacking unto a kingdom because that's god's principle his principle is a kingdom principle and he alone rules he rings and we are all his subjects we are his children praise the lord and and and that also is uh is is uh is the purpose is the vision of the church man so while until the lord can be able to help us for us to be able to either grab that in a in a personal revelation and commit ourselves to aid i mean we would just uh uh we will be we will be doing just like the church war has done all through the years and it is all of those things that have breeded denominations that we have so many of them that we have lost count you know uh those years brother branham uses over 900 denominations but now and i can say we have lost count praise the lord so uh uh and and all of these things we we try to to encourage ourselves to do them uh uh just to bring us into fellowship with one another and also for us to appreciate you know the people that god has placed in our life as you know as a brother as a sister you know as our musicians as our officers and all of them and i believe that is the way we can grow as a church to be successful if we just think that the wednesday night and the sunday night services i uh you know it's all that we need for the church you are missing the match praise the lord amen you are missing the mag because what will happen is the other uh you will get a man that is a preaching machine and pretty soon he will run out of oil and then he will start formulating his own things you know because the spirit of god is not moving in the true in and through the people is just only one man and pretty soon you know uh different things can start happening so uh we have to pay attention to these things you know we have to pay attention to it uh uh you know when you think about things you you prepare for it and then you think that it will be something that people will appreciate and then nobody seems to or very few let me not say nobody you know very few uh uh thinks about it then in some way that uh it makes you to think whether you were doing the right thing or what's what's right what's actually is going on so uh this uh we were going to have brother prater and his wife coming in and we just thought that that would have been the time to you know uh just have our couple's prayer meeting but we will cancel it you know we'll cancel it uh uh for the coming weekend and then uh we will we will look for a better time again uh we look for the time to to be able to hold that and uh also the the young people prayer meeting just like i said uh we will we will also put the all night prayer meeting on hold for now and uh because there are just some few things that we i really want to get down uh you know to to the young people and uh which of course we're driving a few of them this morning as we uh as we trust the law to be able to help us so for the sisters prayer meeting uh i i dedicated to few sisters because what i wanted to evolve was making another preaching service for you i wanted to step out of it and have you sisters come together talk about the things that uh you know are concerning you know or things that you are sisters want to pray for what what you want as a church what you want as a church to bring your bring up your family in you know and encourage your friends co-worker to be part of you can just come together and and just have a time of praying and uh i also learned you know uh a text message was sent out if you did not get a text message then you can get back to us and maybe we don't have your number that is the reason why you did not receive the text message but as far as i know uh i gave them text i gave them numbers to send the information out and what i thought was you know people will make a uh a conversation out of it you know and then york will all talk and then find a time that will be suitable this thing is not a is just not a one night thing it is something that we want to grow ourself into because the house of god is the house of prayer amen praise the lord so those are just a few things so just like i said this coming weekend for the few of you brothers that uh uh responded back to the couple's meeting we will now have it this weekend with uh with uh with the predators we will look for another time in his own future to do that for the youth meeting and [Music] i was thinking that we will we will find a saturday maybe this coming saturday between 11 and 12 we will be years and there is no couples meeting i'll make myself available to be here and no we are having service that saturday evening with brother prater so no not this now this coming weekend so i will give you a date and we will start a saturday afternoon and make sure that we having burden on our house to pray than just to come and visit with one another and make a show of the night so uh we will we will give you a date again that we can be able to start a praying house together and then we can be able to stage a time where we can come and have all night praying okay now to take much of your time let's just stand on our feet and it's good to see uh uh sister richard and anne marie and uh sister margaret will have a son finra they will be doing the funeral this coming tuesday i was able to visit with the family in a way that we could represent the church even though [Music] it's been a while that we have seen them but that is that is our you know that is our christian duty so we will uh okay sorry you just have your seat why sorry sorry we were going to read the scripture and then but i would have brother brother jordan just play the joshua chapter 22 cyrus's tsunami that will be all for the music let's turn to joshua chapter 22. maybe they might be posting the verses i just want us to read the entire chapter together while the play then we will stand for the reading of the word and the half drive of manasseh and said unto them ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice and all that i commanded you ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god and now the lord your god have given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents into the land of your possession which moses the serpent of the lord gave you on the other side jordan but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westwood and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them and he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren and the children of reuben and the children of god and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country of gilead to the land of their possession where they were possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of god and half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see to and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of god and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of god and to the half tribe of manasseh into the land of gilead the nehas the son of eleazar the priest and with him ten princes of each chief house of prince throughout all the tribes of israel and each one was and head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of god and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying thus saith the whole congregation of the lord what trespasses this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the lord is the iniquity of pure too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel today against the lord that tomorrow he will be wrath with the whole congregation of israel notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the lord's tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god did not aiken the son of zero commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity then the children of ruben and the children of god and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel the lord god of gods the lord god of god he knoweth in israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer their own burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the lord himself require it and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have you to do with the lord god of israel for the lord made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of god ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle and when fine house the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of god and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them and fine house the son of elias are the priests said unto the children of reuben and to the children of god and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord and fine house the son of eliezer the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of god out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and god dwelt and the children of reuben and the children of god call the altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god amen let's stand on our feet uh hebrew chapter nine hebrew chapter nine hebrew chapter 9 let's read from verse 19 for when moses have spoken every person to all the people are calling to the lord he took the blood of the calves and of the god with water and scarlet wood and hustle and he sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god has god hath enjoined unto you this is the book of the testament which god has enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessel of the ministry and almost all things are by the lord parched with blood and without sharing shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the parting of things in the heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves are better sacrifices than these let's pray heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus almighty god we just committing ourselves to you this morning we want to take a taught lord father of your word we want to just applaud our hearts oh god and say father come lord and help us lord jesus oh dear father you are our rock father god you are our sufficiency lord you are our strength our redeemer father we bless your name we thank you we praise you father this morning oh god for this day that you have given us lord oh father it is good to be in the house of the lord dear lord we want to thank you for your children that has come for this morning oh god and all the sacrifice of praise and prayers and everything and dear lord even the ones that are not able to be with us lord god and they are streaming the service of lord father online we commit them into your hands oh dear father god lord the ones lord jesus because of work and other things so father god we just place them in your hands lord almighty god here we are father this morning until you come and help us lord as we apprec approach your sacred world we really we really need your help oh god this morning father come lord may the preaching of the world be the sprinkling of blood this morning oh god as everything lord in the tabernacle father was sanctified by the sprinkling of blood we asked o god this morning that thou lord father the chief high priest of god will step for this morning and sprinkle our hearts with your word we love you we appreciate your father we bring the needs lord father god of our loved ones and the sake before you this morning we thank you father we heard brother dawning is doing well

your hands brother lord may you touch him oh god as he recover make him stronger and father the once lord our hearts go out for this morning the sick in the hospitals father we remember them father oh god what almighty god you are this morning heavenly father come lord commit myself in your hands i want to get out of the way this morning and just ask the lord you will come and just take complete control we love you we appreciate you father we glorify your holy name in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord amen we will just we will just go this morning as the lord will lead us and believing that you will be able to help us amen believing that he will be able to help us and we know that uh our god is our god is faithful praise the lord this morning the reason why we read that entire chapter is because there are series of things in that in that chapter that uh i'm hoping that we can be able to look at together and uh uh and just and just study a little a little bit i'm straightening off of the subject that we were talking about last sunday and we continue wednesday night where we were looking at uh the uh gauze family tree we were looking at the two sea lion and uh but this this caught my attention uh and i just thought that uh we can we can study it together uh you know trusting that the lord will be able to put his blessing upon it praise the lord amen we just we are so grateful praise the lord now as as we read the book of uh joshua let's uh let's just uh refer to that and give ourselves a picture uh this tribe the the people of god and ruben and half tribe of monastery joshua has called on to these people to come and help the the other brothers get their inheritance now we have to know that these were the tribes that that got their inheritance before the entire children of israel crossed over jordan joshua gave this tribe their inheritance their inheritance was on this side of jordan but he he asked them to go and help their brothers you know uh to to fight get you know get their inheritance in and after he had divided all the land and these people returned back to their place but now think about this now uh uh the children of ruben and and gath they were across the river and and and the tabernacle was shallow was on the other side of the river so uh if if the children of israel or the children of god needed to go to the tabernacle they have to go over jordan and there they go and make their sacrifices you know and everything because god was dealing with the people as a family he was keeping the tribes together now as as the as the the these people were returning back to the inheritance they realized that they are on this side of jordan the rest of the tribe is on the other side of jordan they they are far away in in one sense they are cut away from the people and they thought to themselves that it would be a good thing for us to build an altar that they called an altar of witness which of course the idea behind the altar of witness was that they would have a memorial for their children praise the lord are we together they will have a memorial so their children will remember all that the lord god of israel has done praise the lord now when israel heard that they have built an altar the first thing that came to their mind is that they want to start a denomination they want us they want to separate the people which mean they want to cut themselves away from us so we are not going to allow it so israel armed themselves and to go and challenge them if this is what you want to do we we will fight against you people just like our enemy and we will destroy your altar are we together praise the lord but when they got there and they realized and and and and the children of ruben and god said god forbid that is not what we want to do we are just building this uh uh we are building this altar so tomorrow you will not tell us that you know we are not part of you because now you have to remember in reading there they built the altar just according to the pattern the instruction that was given to moses they got a correct copy out of it amen they build it just according to the all i mean the the pattern that was given to moses and the owner wanted to have it as a witness oh we serve as a good idea then when they told the children of of of israel the rest of the tribe that this is what we want to do finney has said okay you have to remember now finney house is the one that that used a javelin and slaying that rebellious son of israel down in moab now he was already a commissioned into the priesthood so he was the one he was commissioned because god commissioned him because of the zeal that he had to to roll back the curse from the camp now so he hearing that these people are building a separate altar i mean he he i'm the people and he was the one you remember what god date did in the land of moab uh uh about poorer don't bring that don't bring that curse upon us you know in all of this he's telling the people and all of that but there are some things also that we have to look at when we look at closely because you see good ideas and good com opinion you know god don't bless all the time amen praise the lord it was a good idea for them to be able to build an altar to remind their children that was called the altar of witness praise the lord and you know what they told the children of israel also god forbid there are two things that we're going to keep away from this altar there will be no sacrifice there will be no burnt offering it's only for a witness praise the lord but i will tell you this morning if you don't have a sacrifice if you don't have a burnt offering you don't have a witness praise the lord now so you can see where we want to travel a little bit this morning if you don't have blood on your altar you don't have a witness because the testimony was a testimony of blood are we together praise the lord they had a very good idea they had a good they were it was a good plan it was a good you know for them for them for their children for their children to be able to remember the blessings of god for their children to be able to remember the commandments of the lord that was a good thing for them to build and alter but what good is it if you are not going to bring the full benefit what is good just to have like paul says he says to have the form of godliness and to deny the power thereof because honor the old coveted the power was in the sacrifice the power was not just in the altar the power was in the sacrifice the power was in the daily offering that was done upon the altar praise the lord as we as we as we study together you will see here uh what what happened to these people as the years went by you know as i was thinking about this just like talking about the the the young people prayer meeting and all of these things i just i was just thinking about what you know how to approach this how to go about this you know it's not just to have a prayer meeting is not just to have a young people meeting but what we want to do is to make this holy ghost gospel real amen we want our young people to see the evidence of the baptising of the holy ghost the importance of it that's that's what we want for them to be able to see the importance of it we want a memorial that that will never leave them and experience it's not just to punish them with you know god sent us a prophet you know brother branham was the prophet you know and and and we can say all of those things but if they have not come to that place of having an experience with god they will have all of the knowledge of this message and still walk away from me praise the lord they will have all of the knowledge of this message we have people that was right in the hands of brother branham he dedicated them erased right there in in the branham tabernacle and they knew him very well and and everything but because they never have blood on the altar they turn away from the very sacrifice that was given to us in this age are we together are you ready to go with me this morning amen praise the lord amen i mean we cannot get blood on the altar until a sacrifice is killed are you ready to kill the sacrifice this morning praise the lord amen oh i pray that the lord will just give us grace he will be able to help us what a brilliant idea they were so concerned about that their their their young people they were concerned about their children they don't want the other group on the other side saying well you people were across the river we don't even know you they were afraid of rejection they never wanted to be rejected so with all of these thoughts going in their mind we are yet across the river oh maybe we may not have the time to go down there for service all the while so let's just make our family alter we can make our family altar and play tapes praise the lord we can play the prophet tape make our family altar and just play the prophet tape but abraham says i mean telling 10 minutes we can sit down you know uh have our quiet time for 10 minutes and then we can do our song service let's just sing few songs and then you know we can press play praise the lord well we can go down there to the the tabernacle are shallow once in a while praise the lord but this is our memorial i mean we can use this to educate our children as much as that seems like an appealing idea their altar did not have blood on it praise the lord amen and do you know the reason why the choosing place where god has promised to meet his people the place that god puts his name there has to be blood amen when adam failed in the garden of eden god himself came down the bible says he wrapped them in a sheepskin where will he get it from unless he has killed a lamb praise the lord unless he has killed alam and that is the only way god will be able to approach man in their weakness and condemnation and whatever is going on with them he has to approach us by the way of the blood glory be to god excuses always come out of good ideas and shortcuts always come out of brilliant idea praise the lord but when we study this together you will see that it cost these people more than they ever thought it would have caused him praise the lord this brilliant idea they said no no no uh finney has that god forbid if that is ever our desire to separate to create a new church or a denomination may god slay us that is not our idea you know the devil will never come and give you any idea that his fist contrary to the word he will never do that he will give you a reason to carry out the word in a different way an appealing reason to carry out the world in a different way now you can see the contracts of this with jeroboam when jeroboam took over israel because rihabram was over in judah when joe abram took over the 10 tribes he cut them completely away he built an altar in in beltra he built one in down and he told the people he says look this is the god that has brought you out of israel you don't need to go to jerusalem now we can see that this this is a complete rebellion against the law and if you study the scripture and study a history the people left they went back to the tabernacle of david many of them now you see in history they were always said there was there was a lost 10 tribe of israel when you study you know people would talk about the lost 10 tribes there was never a lost 10 tribe because you have to remember that these 10 tribes that were on the jeroboam they went into idolatry that was where ahab and all of these guys were birthed under this this rebellion that that turned into the worship of god and jessica came on the scene and all of that but there were people that were leaving their tribe to go and settle in the land of judah because they wanted to worship the god of israel praise the lord the ten tribes were conquered by the assyrians that gave us the birth toward the to the samaritans because when when the assyrians conquered them they dominated them and they corrupt them of their language praise the lord by the people whose heart was after the worship of the god of moses whose heart the people that wanted the sprinkling of blood they would leave the ten tribes they were run down to judah they settled down in judah because they were satisfied with the true watcher they knew that this was the sacrifice that god ordained for them to have praise the lord amen even though they were away from their land they were they were away from uh uh uh their settlement but what they wanted they wanted the god of israel they wanted the effect of the true worship but this one the altar of witness no we are not separating ourselves we are not building our own i mean we we are not starting our own church we are just building a family altar does that not sound reasonable every family should have a family altar praise the lord every home should have a family altar that's why the family comes together and we can put our needs and we can talk about the things that that concern us as a family we can bring our burden to the lord it's a brilliant idea every family should have a family altar beside the church every individual should have their own altar where they can meet god and cry out but what i'm saying this morning don't have an altar where there is no blood on praise the lord amen don't have an altar that is not sprinkled with blood because god will only hear your prayer through the blood he will hear your prayer by the voice of the blood praise the lord amen glory be to god glory be to god now see this this caught my attention that's what kind of drove me into this direction this morning and i want to study this together the way to have fellowship the way to have fellowship is through the blood amen we know that's the only way to have fellowship paul was trying to bring us moses tabernacle that when the sacrifice was made he pulled an house up right into the blood and then there there was a water that was missed with the arches of the heifer and uh and and he also dipped the half the the house up into it and then he sprinkle it on the people can you imagine all the people there for worship that is the blood of the sacrifice everybody want a touch of that blood because they want to be identified with the sacrifice amen praise the lord and that is that that is the way that we all must be desiring to have a touch of the word amen and say god speaks to me amen praise the lord i want the word to speak to me i want to have an effect of the word then you are identified with your sacrifice and then he did not want to stop there after he sprinkled the people first he takes the blood and then he sprinkled the bulk of the lord he would sprinkle the the the ark of the coveted because it was in the act of the coveted in the lord the tablets was laying and then he would turn around and he would sprinkle everything that is that is in the place of worship because everything must come under the blood i mean everything must come under the word the the the the worshippers the music that is played and everything it should be under the word that was what the the the sprinkling of the blood on the instrument meant we cannot play rock and roll music because we want to get the people hyper like get the people rejoicing so we we know everything must line up with the word of god it must all be sprinkled with blood everything in the tabernacle has to be under the blood praise the lord amen that's how much important it is even in the millennium we will be under the blood praise the lord amen even in the millennium we will be honor the blood sacrifice of our lord jesus christ glory be to god that how much the blood is important now let's let's read this together now the way to have fellowship let's study this together look when israel was divided was dividing up the land there was i believe it was god was one of them and perhaps they have tried they didn't go over into the promised land they stay on this side the borderline now you have to remember they were on the other side of jordan praise the lord amen jesus visited that same people and look at the result of staying out of the full benefit of god's word look at the result of staying out of the full benefit when the scripture says don't forsake the assembling of the saints praise the lord amen when the scripture says repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus you will receive the the gift of the holy ghost there is a benefit every promise every instruction that god has given us there is a benefit that's the reason why we cannot take a substitute we can we we cannot replace anything for the laws of god's word for the word of god that god has given to us and as much as itself as a good idea and finninhas and the rest of the children of israel agree with them oh okay we thought you all wanted to start your own denomination but you know it's a good idea for you to have this memorial in a way that you can remind your children let me tell you something they never needed one you know why they never needed one the data is red cross the jordan river amen when the cross the jordan river the water potted god gave them the same experience that moses and the children of israel had are the red sea praise the lord for all of those that were born in the wilderness that only year the testimony god opened the red sea god opened the red sea god gave them the same experience that the the priests went into the middle of the river and the water dried and the people crossed and what they decided to do they took 12 stones and they brought it right into the middle of the river and they build those stones there as a memorial joshua told them so you can show your children tomorrow when they ask you what is the meaning of those stones you can tell them that that those stones were placed there by your fathers that was the time we walked through that land i mean through that river that water was dry up they had a time tested memorial they never needed to build one for themself praise the lord because the stone was right in the middle of jordan whether you are on this side whether you are on that side you can still look to the to the stones and point and says my father planted a stone down there amen you have the benefit of the revival because you have a time tested memorial are we together praise the lord but they just thought maybe we can go to an extra mile maybe we can do something more by building our family altar just according to the party just like how the the the altar is in shallow let's let's get them the exact measurement because we don't want to be wrong let's get the exact measurement let's do everything let's paint it the same way let's let's let's put curtains around it the same way it has to be just like the tabernacle in charlotte that was not god's instruction god never gave them that instruction it was just their own ideas and how many times i've seen family use their own idea and pull their entire family into errors praise the lord because we have a better idea of the message we listen to the message we read the prophet message if that's what that church decide to do it's up to them i mean we just go in there because it's our church but we have our own altar we will do it our own way praise the lord we will do it our own way why because we have the message we know what the prophet said about church order glory be to god amen praise the lord amen but branham said look at the result of staying out of the full benefit of god's love praise the lord look at the result that they brought upon themselves let's read a little bit and many other things we can bring from out of the word of god but i really this really struck me this this morning when i when i realized that brother branham said this i i spoke on the man of gabra some time ago and i was talking on the birthstone when godmother was going to give birth and the way she in the way she cried out in pains and talked about how how she suffer but finally you will overcome that was her cried on her birth under the birth pains you suffer but finally you overcome be to god and we realized that that thing followed that tribe of god but let's go on a little bit here you see what we will find out here when jesus visited them he went over to gatherera and that place of gatherer was the inhabitants of the children of god praise the lord and we know what gatherer is gatherer is a place that our great lake demon possess we find a man there fell with a bunch of demons out of counts until the demons could speak out of him we are legions for we are many it was a land full of demon possession the result of keeping ourselves out of the full benefit you can make your own religion in your mind you can make your own worship because that's one thing this this this age is full of is self-worship paul cried against that thing in to the church of kalusha because he saw the spirit among the people they were so proud until they worshiped himself an age of self-worship self-exaltation people talk about themselves too much more than they even talk about the lord the lord are we together see the result word they led their generation to just cooking out for themselves a good idea and they even told finney house and says this altar is not for burnt offering if you don't have an author for brand offering then why do you have an altar amen if you don't have an altar for burnt offering when we were setting on sacrifice there's one of the sacrifices that bring a sweet smell to god that is the sacrifice where the entire body of the beast is burned the only thing that is taken from that sacrifice is the flesh because god don't have no desire in flesh flesh stinks in god's nose so the only thing that is taking away from that sacrifice is the flesh but the entire body of the beast is burnt to god and it brings a sweet smell and then if you have an altar that you are not ready to give all to god you better break it down because god is not going to take half in american offering he's not going to take half they say this altar is not for burnt offering it's not for sacrifice why would you have an altar and you are not willing to sacrifice look at the result in another sense we can say they grieve the holy ghost and when you grieve the holy ghost you turn yourself loose for demon powers you can get born shall release your spirit on you because they were stayed there they were staying they were still worshiping they were still being called children of the of of israel they would still be leaving but slowly slowly the entire family was drifting off they were drifting off the original pattern they were drifting off of the experience when the people would go down to shallow where the sacrifice was where the burnt offering was lifted to god and the people would get an experience the shaking of glory will come down and consume their sacrifice they will come oh my goodness thank god the service well i was not feeling well this morning but when i went i mean after the the sprinkling of the blood i just felt good and these people they just had an altar exact measurement exact pattern exact appearance having the form of godliness praise the lord is that not where we are praise the lord is that not where we are having a form of godliness just because we can say we are in a message we identified with with the prophet of the hour when god has has promised prophesied that the world will be manifest the word that our last day prophet spoke will once again be manifested among the people he said the things that you saw temporarily in my ministry he said watch and see praise the lord the things that you saw temporary he said wash and see and we will never have those results if we take blood from on the altar we will never have those results if we don't have a burn offering if we are not ready to give all that's what preeminence is that's what preeminence is a bride a people that is ready to give all people argue about selling stuff yeah i mean the prophet said but this is the way i think about it you know this is the way i think it should be done slowly you find people destroy the entire family by separating himself having their own form of an altar that they have built an imaginary altar in their mind praise the lord i mean we can talk about speaking scar us into existence and we can all shout about it praise the lord that's the spoken word power but that spoken word power never went to the grave with brother branham it's supposed to be something that is among us where we can be able to speak speak speak against our temper against lust against things that are contrary to god's word speak the truth they had an altar without blood they had an altar and all they were just talking about when moses built the altar children when moses built this altar we were there in the wilderness when he built the altar we saw the shakka glory talking about the experience of moses can never give you the result of moses it can never give you the result because you are not applying the word you are not following the instruction look at the result of staying out of full benefit god want to give us the holy ghost more than we desire it amen he want to deal with our life more than we want god to work through us the result of staying out of full benefit praise the lord are we together jesus visited them he went down to gatherera that's where the word word that's word they made that's where they come from that's right and their attitude was still the same way their attitude will stay the same way what brother branham told us that make elisha to curse those children to the bed was because of what their parents told them about the prophet they sat in their house on their family altar these people calling calling on jehovah and they were laughing at god's prophet he's above-headed man praise the lord the children just talk exactly what their parents said and ran after that prophet in the street you bob had a man crazy man praise the lord but says the attitude never change when jesus casted the spirit out of that man into their swamp whether they rose up against him you have come to the you have come to destroy our livelihood you mean you prefer peaks then your son that was possessed with demon praise the lord you mean you prefer peaks things that you can make money out of then you have in a some year that is possessed he have left his family praise the lord all of these things that is happening in this age people raise a family four or five children and then they decide to walk away and all of that it's just it's just demon possession to destroy the life of the children they were still the same the result of not getting full benefit people you think about that the result of just having a halfway religion not getting the full benefit of the baptism of the holy ghost not going through with god praise the lord i mean when you go through with god he brings you to such a place your heart is so sweet and full of reverence that even if you have to go to a catholic church you will go there and you will respect what the people are doing even if you don't believe it you will not be arrogant and start condemning everything around the place if you have gone through with god your heart will be so sweet so humble that you can go anywhere anywhere and still be a christian and say be a son of god and still be a daughter of god the thing that will be back in your mind is not church or religion it will be christ how much i can be christ among these people we are struggling with spirit of condemnation you have not gone through with god yet praise the lord brother branham right there in ohio what the god did to him he went down there saw that all woman with the police fletching with the with the police and doing all that she was doing he said god just wept this whole thing off how long will you bear with the filthiness that is done god broke a vision to him and say your altar does not have blood on it william branham you need blood on your altar god broke a vision to him and he saw the blood as a bumper glory be to god what is the knee of having an altar and you don't have blood on it you can keep it pretty you can keep it nice god love a bloody altar amen and blood the altar is one that is filled with confession and tears oh god i mess it up on me because every birth is a mess praise the lord god said well then brandon your altar does not have enough blood on it and god showed a vision every time he would do something there's a blood bumper that would stop the wrath of god when he came from out of that vision say oh my god have mercy on me praise the lord he has some blood on his altar he had to go and meet the woman he says can i talk to you a little bit the very woman he was condemning the very woman he wanted god to sweep to hell but when he took blood on his altar and went to talk to her she knelt down right there and died gambling with her sexy clothes on her filter that she was locking makeup she'll never right down there [Music] glory be to god that's the god we serve and that's the prophet we believe amen praise the lord he was not he was not ashamed to tell us that he did not have enough blood on his altar what is the need of having an altar why there is no blood praise the lord all you can talk about is all the things that have passed i used to be this i used to be there i used to be that that's all they were doing they just have a furnish it just it's not for burnt offering feeling i don't get mad with us it's not for burnt offering it's not for sacrifice we just have a year this we did it the same party we did it the same measurement everything is just here for a witness god has already given them a witness we have many people that are building their own witnesses and not taking god's witness what is god witness acts chapter 2 when he says i will make you witnesses that is god's witness the baptism of the holy ghost is god's witness but brandon says the attitude was still the same way it caused them a bunch of hawks to have the meeting they asked jesus to leave their lane that simple attitude their fathers talked many years to build something that resembled the word and they never knew that they were separating themselves from the word the era said the word in flesh they are rejecting the word praise the lord all you can talk about brother branham live speaking things into existence and all of those things people will shout they will rejoice they will blow whistle they will kick their shoes in the air but bring that word to take flesh bring that word to their personal life this is all you are attacking me the words want to be made flesh in you he was our wave sheep god with him that god can be able to get a man born in sin born from unbelieving parents father was a drunker god is showing to us that the new birth has more power than your natural birth and no matter if you were born in prostitution born on the road don't even know your parents it does not matter to god it does not matter to god when god get his hand on your life he can rewrite your life [Applause] glory be to god they had the same attitude brother branham said it took hogs it took peaks to come to the revival pigs came to the revival when the people won praise the lord are we together yeah amen they didn't want nothing to do with it they had their own ways they had their own churches they didn't want nothing to do with jesus so they asked him to leave the lane it was from that time it was from that time that a seed was so to reject the word it was from that time they built an altar without burn offering they built an altar with no blasting on it a kind of a way of being savage in their mind we want our children we are guidance we must do the best that god has given in our power train of the child in a way that it will grow that it will not depart from it it's not your it's not your training that it don't depart from is the word that they don't depart from amen is the word that they don't depart from saul do us a whole lot to instill the word in them not our ideas or what we think the word says expose them to the word read your bible sound read your bible daughter let them fall in love with that word let god start dealing with your heart praise the lord let god start dealing with your young heart sorry rebecca i get to your question amen i jumped over there and i talked about that i brought the paper here with me how can i forget like this amen the young sister asked me some some very very nice question they got me thinking amen praise the lord amen it got me thinking nice question she asked me here we talked about genesis 1 7 yesterday you know talking about water above the farming you know understanding that the farming man was heavens and all of that you know what uh uh and and listen to this question listen to this question it's very beautiful listen to it in genesis 10 5 genesis chapter 10 in verse 5 verse 20 verse 31 it talks about everyone after their own tongue amen but in genesis 11 it says there was one language so what is the difference if everybody had one language then how can everyone have their own tongue i mean this case can make you thinking amen praise the lord they can make you thinking praise the lord they can get you to work i mean it's paying my wheels a little bit glory to god but that's how god these with your heart instead of us right in the billboard you know we believe this message this is the way you must do and this is the way you might do all you do when you just joined in a pretty altar there is no blood on that altar is no blasting on that altar let that word start dealing with their heart where they can start reading their bible and you see them sobbing in their room and crying oh god help me let this thing become real to me they were thinking about their children they had their children in their mind so they decided to build their own family altar but they kept blood from on the altar so the entire generation wayne not knowing the importance of the blood they're not knowing the importance of the smoke growing up to god all the know we have an altar we are in the message praise the lord we wear dresses in our church we wear dress in our church we wear dress we don't wear dresses we wear dress there is no blood on that altar here there is no blood on that altar here there is no blood on that altar and god is not going to take your family blood you don't have to put your family blood on the altar god will take one thing that's the bleeding word this word has to be bleeding that's the thing that gives life they had their children in mind or maybe if we do this if we get their attention maybe if we do they will be interested in the lord you pray for those kids get before god cry to god for them give them the word and let god go dealing with the heart having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof they can dress the message they can talk the message amen that blood on the altar and because they rejected the word they rejected the simple instruction they make an excuse a brilliant convincing excuse and even finny has to praise fell for it okay that's nice nice nice as long as you guys are not going to to to sacrifice i mean they needed a gideon that would break that altar down and say shallow we go they needed to gideon praise the lord father said boy you broke my my my my god there he said why are you talking for your god why why are you making an argument for your god god should be talking for you i mean sometimes you you study things and and it's just it just grabs you i mean this thing just frees me it frees me it frees me to know here is the god of israel still concerned for them he came in flesh and he's going down there thinking that it will bring a revival to the people jesus had this man in his mind he said we must go on the other side he had to go just for one soul because he was a seed of abraham he was from the tribe of god jesus was concerned about him but the people there they were so caught up in their own religion he had to go there all they could do for the man is just put him in chains chain his legs chain his hands because he's cutting himself and he's running after people that's all they can do and that's all this world religion can do just put us in chains and create division division and put hatred in the heart of the people they put the men in chains and they hated him that's all their religion could provide that's what happens when you have an altar without blood it's so pretty you don't want nobody to mess it up you don't want nobody to touch it so he said leave it late leave it like that no no no don't put your hands on it it's a pretty auto let it be there they had their own church they didn't want nothing to do with jesus so they asked him to leave their lane but he went anyhow because there was one soul calling him there was one soul calling him if we can just imagine that man in chains and way down in his subconscious he's thinking about the god of abraham the god that brought our fathers through the red sea way down in his subconscious i was thinking about a subconscious and i was thinking about on the message your dreams were imprisoned you praise the lord it was joseph dreams that put him in praising glory be to god i'm preaching this i'm not preaching that one yet amen so don't stop pulling me in there what are you talking i can feed it i can feel the current amen people want me to change now and go into that praise the lord amen glory be to god don't worry the same dream that i'm praising you your dream will set you free amen [Laughter] so just leave me now let me preach my message okay glory be to god oh my but way down in his subconscious he's thinking that's what that predestinated he does for you when you are so backslidded so confused so away from god you don't even know how to get back to your bible to make sense of reading it but down in your subconscious something tells you there is a god in heaven something tells you that this word is truth you don't know how to get back to it you hold your bible in your hands oh my god confused you are completely out of it praise the lord i was talking to a young man and uh i call him with my number he won't pick up so i i trick him i call him with another number and he pick when he realized i was the one he stuck i said what are you avoiding me why are you avoiding my call what's going on you know what's happening he says whoa yeah no you know when you talk a little bit this is well okay i mean you're feeling like just doing you are you enjoy doing you praise the lord but we had a good composition we were able to break the ice a little bit and then after he texted me back he says he said brother want thank you for calling me i really thought you were going to blast at me he says i really thought you were going to chew me up i said no but i'm not chewing you up i just uh just wanted to touch base with you amen and tell you that when you finish doing you god is waiting for you so you can do god amen [Applause] praise the lord oh man my goodness my goodness the young people are very interesting amen praise the lord my goodness me let's just read some few things here and then i think we have we have established this thought you know when i'm going with this praise the lord you know when i'm going with this and i can see sometimes many many of our children are innocent sometimes sometimes we parents are the ones that build those altars and we drive them away because we build this image before them praise the lord i'll tell you one one of my experience that i had which of course it was i was just i was just just a child just a young child but and i didn't even know knew what it was but many of the times that's what happens and and this this family friend to my mama we used to run through neighbors who run through one another house so i came from the soccer fee and i just went through the house and when i got there they were the muslim family and they had the you know they were doing their thing sitting down in uh in a cycle and they had this guy there you know reading minds you know and trying to do he was a fortune teller amen and he had a dad on the ground and you know what i mean so when i got in i realized they were there i wanted to go back out and they said no come come you know call me and i saw that i'm there and and and this is what i want to bring to you is because what happened is that the the the man i don't know i don't know what the enchanter or wish doctor man it was almost like okay yeah this is somebody now that is that is you know that is that is not in the family so we can use him now as the babe so we saw them there and and uh whatever he was pointing to on the floor he kept telling me can you see it i said no i can see it he said look can you see it and just trying to see what is not there the next thing i i realized was i went to sleep and when i woke up everybody was going from the room praise the lord so sometimes that's what happened to the young minds praise the lord when a young person had an experience with god praise the lord you will not have to bring god out of a black heart before they see it you don't have to show god in the clouds and through the supernatural is the god dealing with the heart is the god that is inside that will make them when they tell the lie they'll come back and say so well i'm sorry for what i told you that was a lie that is god dealing with your heart you don't have to bring it out of out of a black hat sometimes we want to show we keep pointing them to something that they can see and they get lost in their mind because they don't see it but they don't want to make you the feedback oh yeah i see it yeah experience brother branham says god i pray that you and men of the broken homes and make the one that in whom that's indifferent father mother who doesn't pray give them an experience tonight and they will start a family altar in their homes praise the lord family altars are very great things when people can sit around the bible read the bible pray together talk as a family whether this castle you know but one thing you must do you must keep the blood on the altar praise the lord amen when you start to use your family altar to uh to uh uh disregard the word try to use the family altar disregard the ministry or whatever it is taking blood of the altar just making it a a a a form a no burn offering praise the lord that's what he did and he exposed the generation to come to a spiritual warfare that whole land was a land full of demon possession because they rejected drove their family away from the world just once more you fathers your mother are you ready to establish a family altar in your house and take away take the television out and you're ready to take the the deck cards away the coming box that your children are reading preparing their mind for a blast that the devil going to give them praise the lord that's when we have the form of godliness amen we just we just comment and we just i mean do our religion blood on the altar we give us constant desire we talk in walking in the constant itunes because we want his abiding presence that's what the blood on the altar will do it will keep us in that constant attunement we will be walking with sheepskin flapping on our laps and the blood dropping every time we walk when we go out of the house we will see the blasting dropping when we look behind we will see the blasting dropping because we are meditating on that word we are saying god help me i don't want to be a hypocrite praise the lord i want to be a i want to be a daughter of god i don't want to live alive just to impress people praise the lord i want to be a daughter of god in my own skin i don't want to be sister this i want to be who i am i want to appreciate what you have given me appreciate what you are doing in my life glory be to god the bible says there stood as an altar of witness unto those people but it was a wrong witness it was a witness that we net bring convinced a witness that is just enough to make church members put the bible under the arm go and talk about the paradise and show people pictures in the paradise there will be no wall you see we'll be eating apple from the tree those kind of a witness don't make converts it was kind of a witness don't bring people to their knees but let me tell you the kind of a witness that does it when you go and tell somebody about how a sinner you were and i used to lie and i used to cheat but i met god that's the witness that speaks i was in out of this field i used to watch daddy movies but i mean god there with my heart and he changed me that is the kind of a witness because there is blood on that altar when blood is on your altar you are not afraid to confess your sins you are not afraid to testify of who you are when blood is on your altar not just a self made pretty altar you know everybody know you to be this nice guy oh yeah but when blood get on that altar then you are a witness musicians you can come we will continue praise the lord until we can fully sprinkle the blood amen until we can fully sprinkle the blood and spread it all over you see that's that's the reason why paul says he says in the book of hebrew he won against us separating ourselves he won against us creating separation among the brethren he won us the worshippers once parched that's why he said there is no remembrance of sin he want us not to forsake the assembling of the saints not to build not to build an altar for ourselves [Music] what are you reading the word what are you are praying you are not creating some self-imagination to yourself you are asking god to deal with me just as i am without no play just like what brother branham says choosing of a bride this is the kind of a decision that you made today you see the result five years down the road [Music] your personal altar your family altar everything must come back to the word amen cheers [Music] blind [Music] me [Music] oh lord

the enemy talk and i took the direction and discouraged trapped some of the young people into things struggling with and all of that like we read on wednesday night john said young man [Music] you have overcome this wicked one and that is that that is the confidence that is the confidence that we want our young people to stand with they know that they are son and daughter of god and they're not believing what they are believing because of their mama and dad they are desiring an experience of god they want god in their life change their lives there is no remission of sin without blood [Music]

to the place young people when you are praying you feel the presence of god in your heart you know that god is dealing with you you are going through with him no matter who says what we want a kind of altar that was built in acts chapter 4 or as chapter 2 where they pray together in one call they cry out to god they mean business with god that's why we want to bring you young people talk now to

when i walked out of that room that evening i never remember what happened to me i walk out and i did not remember it it took me many years when i got saved i was praying one night and i really meant business with god about 18 years old just about there 19 about going into the ministry i was praying and i was just asking god i was crying to god i said lord if this is what you call me tall you get you really got to help me and i prayed and i cried that night it was just almost i just i just felt like there was something that was that was always robbing me you know it's it's almost looks like you all you're trying you you're almost there and they just come and grab it from you i just i had a feeling in my heart and i was just i mean i prayed that night i was soaked in my sweat and my tears and i lie down on the floor you know what the lord did the lord brought that entire happiness back to me in the dream it was just like a vision everything came back to my mind and i believe that was when the lord delivered me from whatever curse it was allah right there everything came back to me like in a vision and when i walked out of that praying room that day i knew that there is a living god praise the lord i knew i mean i've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus i received the holy ghost i mean i was living by the word of god i started preaching at a time praising and and in hospital and you know witnessing to people but they were just i just i just fell that clown over my life praise the lord and i believe thou seen god is more than able like brother branham says he want
