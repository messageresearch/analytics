have a uh few announcement here we would like to to cover uh oh I was going to forget uh I think we have a we have a song that we were supposed to do on Wednesday night sorry for the service on Wednesday night if you whether you notice or not but uh I kind of for room my inspiration on Wednesday night I was I was so fired up to speak on what I wanted to speak on that I entitled The superstitious gospel but then uh just before uh left the office uh uh my wife and the children were coming from redeem uh uh conference and at school and then uh uh the alternator on her car went off so she called me just when I was about to come from in the office so you know where my heart was praise the Lord and you see uh uh I mean that's that's the way it is you fall out of that channel to get back into it becomes difficult you know that's the reason why most of the time we don't like too much talking before we come up here because the moment you fall out of that channel to get back becomes very very difficult so I was preaching to you but I was struggling in my mind I was thinking know has Triple A got there yet and I wonder what is going on what part of the road is she parking you know all of that so I kind of foru my inspiration so we were we were supposed to do that song on Wednesday night I told Brother Ariel but then the girls were not able to come so uh they reminded me so we have a a song that we would like to do and uh and and the reason behind that song is uh uh uh some of the things I was going to talk about so I pray that you and redeem you can come up let's uh let's uh and uh I throw the words uh also there so we have uh uh we should have the words of the brother a you remember the song [Music] Oh I rather [Music] be in the deep that grave wait wait wait wait I'm I'm trying to to to tell the musicians we were practicing last night she says daddy your voice is too crack up so if the songs SP blam me okay let's start from the chorus now I would rather be in the deep that gra and know that my for of s than to live in this world in the house of Lord and deny my God and Lose My Soul let's do that one more time I would rather be in the deep dark Gra and know that my over and to live in this world in the house of and be my God and Lose My Soul people still they she Li for Welling what it will F but don't they know on the judment days that gold and silver about oh I would rather be I rather be in the de God PR know that oh to live in this world in the house of God and be now my God and Lose My Soul the next one out [Music] your heart good and true he me me when I fall down the your KN oh I would rather be I would of in the deep and to world in the house of and God and lo my soul now I would do this one thank God the gra is not my hope in the twinkling of an ey I will be gone to a whole heart he has prepared for for me that will not pass away oh I and and to live in this world in the house [Music] of and my God and let's sing that for us together oh I will in [Music] the and know that and to live in this world the house [Music] of my God and look one more time now oh I would ra be in the [Music] and to Liv this word in the house of and God my God and lose my that's good that's good beautiful beautiful thank you thank you thank you praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen that last answerer that last answerer I wrote it and I wrote it because uh because of everything that was going through my mind and and uh and that's where I was going to come from with that whole thought of a superstitious gospel and it's it's it became superstitious over the years because of what uh uh you know people believe the things that uh uh that when you when you uh read the the chorus I rather be in the in a deep di grave but the grave is not our home praise the Lord the grave is only the Earth returning back to the Earth praise the Lord amen it's it's on it that you you see that is the reason why uh all of the people and big part of those things was push on us from the Catholic church this worship of the Dead right this worship of death the worship of dead and and you know and all of the things that we tried you know uh people try to put to death and all of that is because even though it's been R from the scripture but uh uh uh the the understanding the experience the Revelation has never come to the heart of man praise the Lord and and and you will see and and realize that's the reason why why uh uh uh brother Brandon visit behind the curtain of the time God allowed that to be able to break the seal that was upon what happened when we leave from here those that stay and be changed in the twinkling of an eye is not better than them that die praise the Lord is the same experience if I should drop there right here this morning before my body touch this ground I'll be stepping in another body I will be standing in another body I will be alive and [Music] well praise the Lord so whether you go in the Rapture or you go by the way of the Grave praise the Lord the people that will live till the Rapture you don't know what it is when a man drops the body and dash in the in the other one the people that die will not know what it is when you are walking on the street and your body change are we together praise the Lord so you see that th those that's where my mind was you know because I mean there is just a bunch of uh uh uh superstitial things that uh that has hang around the church you know hang around the church and and all of that that's that's what I was bringing from the place of Rachel stealing her father Idol because all of those things were sto from the Catholic church and it were brought right into the church and and and people you know are just believing those things you know what and and and and I mean they just plague our minds you know someone asked me some time ago they you know they wanted me to give them anointing oil I thought in my mind I mean uh you go back to the to the people that was giving those ordin it was only the priest that handled anointing oil praise the Lord but what have it become today in in uh in in in in cyc churches they think that is something to cast out evil spirits you know so people get anointing oil in their house you know they sprink it up they sprink it all over the place they sprink it all over the place some of them get holy water they sprink it all over those are just bunch of superstitious praise the Lord and we think that is uh is uh is uh you know uh uh uh those are some of the things we'll talk about this morning but I'm going in a different direction I Roan inspiration on on on Wednesday I have to go back again and then the Holy Ghost cook it up for me amen so I'm going to go in a different direction but uh but that's okay you know because uh uh uh and and and what I want to talk about this morning is the the angel of the Lord I come about those that fear Him amen and also the the encamping of angels you talk about the angel of the Lord you talk about the seven angels you talk about the angel that brought the commission all of those things also turn to be believe as superstitious people think it's superstitious belief that we have when we talk about angels but we want to look at those things in the word this morning well musicians have not started preaching but thank you for the music you can take your seat let me go over my announcements this morning and again uh it's it's good to have each and every one of you in the house of the Lord this morning those that couldn't make it with us uh uh we we also want to greet them you know uh that uh uh that the Lord will will uh we also will help them praise the Lord I don't know what my musicians doing with their head but and both of them resemble praise the Lord but that's that's okay and uh this coming Wednesday brother Andrew Glover will be traveling to Canada and I think uh he have enjoyed stopping by before he goes praise the Lord so he will be here with us Wednesday night uh he's flying in Wednesday taking off on Thursday uh to Canada so he just called me and said brother War would it be good for us to stop by I said you are all all always welcome so he'll be here preaching for us Wednesday night that's brother Andrew Glover so uh let's come and support the services and uh uh Pastor Martin anura That's the dad of our dear brother Miram anura I went to be with the Lord that church over in DC that we've been helping uh uh now they have a pastor uh brother James and Myon is there as their pastor but uh uh Pastor Mar is is in the state since his uh son went to be with the Lord uh uh he T wife come over and visit with his grandchildren and also visit with some of us his friends and uh uh I I will also love to see him he'll be coming coming uh uh towards the end of the week to visit with us he will speak for us on Sunday and uh but uh uh uh it will be it would be a blessing to see him because after he left uh from the passing of his son uh uh uh he he really went through a tough time really went through a tough time we thought we were going to lost him at a certain point of time and uh brother Miram was his only son his only beloved his only dear son and uh I mean there are just a lot of things there he he might share with you some of the the things he went through for his recovery but uh uh uh just before uh brother mea has traveled back home and uh Pastor Martin was in and out uh with his with his uh with his health but then he he spoke with his son our friend and and ask and ask him and say and says you know son if I should pass away I would want you to do my funeral you know he was charging his son to do his funeral not knowing that he will be there in the funeral of his son so it hit him so hard and I remember talking to him I I was I was almost about flying to Nigeria to see him uh because after the last time I talked to him he couldn't spend no time with me on the phone and uh uh and then right in right after that he just he just fell into a very very deep valley but we thank the Lord the ego is back up amen praise the the Lord the ego is back up so he will he will be back he will be here uh on the weekend to visit with us I was supposed to be going down to Phoenix for for a a man's meeting that brother Israel is doing there um some uh man breakfast Services something like that but uh for some reason uh uh some and many other reasons uh I'm not I'm not sure I be able to go so but uh uh I just I need to work on some few things okay so so yeah brother Andrew Glover will preach for us Wednesday night Pastor Martin will speak for us on Sunday their services with brother Joel Brown brother Joel Brown and and brother Wesley you're right brother Joel is uh uh I kind of for Mi when you ask me that question he's from uh brother Donnie Church there in Tennessee so the servic is with him on the the 18 and the 19 I saw that the deacons pass out some sheets uh uh last Sunday uh those services are cancer the reason why they are cancer is because we we we are so Boke uh I mean Boke in a sense there are the following weekend uh right from Thanksgiving we go into brother John BBE uh uh memorial service on on Friday funeral on Saturday and then we have a Sunday service so we will be having two weekends that will just be so tight and uh and the weather is nice praise the Lord the weather is not favorite but I don't know what it's going to be like so I will not want to keep you on the road those two weekends so I spoke with brother Jord and Jord and uh and we uh uh put the meeting up for some future debt and uh so Wednesday the 2 uh 2nd uh will be no service Thursday will be Thanksgiving so uh we will now have service on the 22 but then on the 24th we will We would like to have a uh little little kind of a memorial service for Brother Steve jibi uh uh that will be on Friday if the Lord will help us we want to sit a little bit early and uh maybe 6:00 or 6:30 and then see if we can get out of the building by 9 9:30 10:00 uh so um and then Saturday the 25th will be his funeral service we will give you the directions and we will remind you the time so those are those are the few things that we have uh before us here for the announcement so so uh come Wednesday night let's come and uh support the service with brother Andrews he he enjoy visiting with us if that he would he wouldn't have requested so let's come in and uh be part of the service Wednesday night and then uh uh another thing I would like to address before uh um going into my message this morning and uh uh if if you do remember um Paul in the book of Corinthian uh uh bam called there the Church of Correction Paul there in First Corinthian with lot of the problems that the people the Church of Corinthian was having Paul uh in dealing with the people there there was a situation that came up and that situation was uh uh a man in the Corinthian Church you have to remember now those people people they came out of lot of you know uh uh strange beliefs lot of uh things they came out of to come to Christianity and uh so this man uh was uh uh for some reason he was living with his father's wife and then when they told Paul uh uh he realized that there was not a conduct that the church was going to to you know encourage so Paul wrote them a letter and says you know we're not going to bring this kind of a behavior in the church uh uh so uh uh you know the man must be advised if he continue to live that way then Paul says ask communicate him you know cast him out you know uh uh so so we of course if you follow the book of First Corinthian that was where Paul you know talk about uh uh excommunication but then his second letter to the Church of uh Corinthians uh uh the man have corrected what was wrong and Paul was told so Paul had to write the people you know because you see the thing that is not is not a battle against flesh and blood what it is is that uh we have a standard which is the word of God we try to uphold the word of God when you walk walk through those doors and come in this building all you're trying to do is help us to lift this word of God up and we want to lift it up above our heads the word must be lifted above every one of us praise the Lord that's that's what we are here doing that's all we here doing encouraging one another let's lift this word up let Jesus be glorified let people see that uh the redeem is on the earth so it's it's not it's not a flesh and blood thing and one person attacking another person and and all of that so Paul then wrote the brothers and says well if the man has corrected himself you don't leave him out there we only took that position against him because it was not the word of God and I'm telling you that is still the word of God sir if a man live contrary to what we believe here we will excommunicate you numbers is not our problem you know why numbers is not our problem because we got we having more numbers than you see praise the lord we having more numbers than you see this morning because we are in cabout by Angel praise the Lord so we have a word of God that we want to uphold and may God give us Grace not even myself is above the word you know so Paul told told why why why that I mean if the man has corrected his ways you're encourag him back to church all we wanted to do we just wanted to in correct there that that is not our way of life right praise the Lord you know some of you will remember I think uh that will be sometime last year and uh uh uh we we uh during one of our service we had to we had to uh uh uh correct some things brother uh I think brother Johnny has just returned back from his trip and we've uh uh you know some of the things that were that were there on Facebook and uh because uh uh brother Johnny uh and his wife sister Masa I've been friends with them now for some years I remember one time they came to visit uh sister Masa relatives and they got a hold of me even before they came to visit I can rightly remember that was I think brother Valentine I gave them my number and uh because uh uh Masa wanted to know if uh you know if the m was in Liberia and all of that so that's how I got in contact with them so I've been friends with them uh uh uh you know even before the move year but then when the move year we got close and and and like every family has problems and issues there were things that they were dealing with so in the midst of that uh I think uh uh you know uh by their choice and uh after we we did all that we could to talk to them and encourage them you know by their choice they were separated and then in that in that time of Separation there were other things that were going on and uh uh uh more especially you know for for brother Johnny because he was here with us in church and uh uh sister Masa was now with us in church you know so uh uh uh we we could only apply the standard of the word that we had to brother Johnny because he was here with us in church you know so when some of those things came up when I heard about it and uh uh he and myself we talk and I told him because this thing is a public thing I believe many in the church might have seen things on the internet I'm going to address it from the back of the pulpit you know it's not I'm not attacking you I'm just just only going to defend what we stand for so uh uh that was done and then uh uh uh couple of months the months went back and I'm I'm also I'm also grateful that uh uh in as in as much as uh you know with with every one of us we have our ego we have uh you know places where we can be uncomfortable table and all of that but uh uh I think uh our brother was able to see where I was coming from and uh you know uh uh and then he he he hang in there and and all of that until uh then couple of months uh uh his wife reached out to me she wanted to talk to me and uh uh and she knew I was mad mad she knew that I was mad I was just trying to hold myself I said Lord just help me and I shouldn't missbehave Lord please help me I shouldn't misbehave let it not be me let me not take this thing personer let it not be me but she reached out to me and we talk and uh and uh but as the Lord will have it they decided to reconcile their differences and uh uh and go back and clean up some of the mess that it created for themsel and uh uh uh and then uh they they rejoined thems uh by going uh back to the court of Lord and and uh randing the uh the their marriage so uh uh I thought that okay since uh we spoke to our brother publicly from the back of this Pulpit we are just only using Apostolic style and uh it will be good for us to to come back to this local assembly and say to the best of my knowledge that I know uh brother Johnny and sister mastera have uh reunited himself to be husband and wife praise the Lord so can you both just stand in your [Applause] seat and uh let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we Just Want to Thank You Lord uh uh we've been taught by your Prophet that uh the people are the purches of your blood and father we want to pray that Lord God you will give us continual wisdom and Grace in the way that father we deal with your people Solomon said there are such a great people who can go in and come out among them and dear Lord I'm thankful this morning Father to have uh our dear brother Johnny and his wife and father we just want to pray that you will help them Lord they have come a long way with all their troubles or their struggles but father to see that Lord God they they Rising above that and they are taking to your name they are holding to you I pray that father you would please give them Grace Lord give them Grace oh Father there are many other troubles they may have there are many other battles they may fight but I pray oh Lord may they remember like I told them it's not about them it's about you father so I pray that Lord God you will you will bless them bless their home oh Father Lord and uh we love you and we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you now so I was going to say that uh we uh we uh uh uh the Lord has been good the Lord has been so good so good praise the Lord the Lord has been so good and uh I believe that uh the devil knows that we trying our best to stay in line with the word amen and because he knows that he's going to throw every trash our way praise the Lord whatever we can jump over we will jump whatever we can take out of the way we will take out of the way praise the Lord but we're not going to allow anything to stop us amen we are on our journey amen so there are a lot of lot of different things we've been dealing with we've been we've been fighting through you know uh uh and and most especially I mean this is this is this is a church that is in its infancy I call it a tender plant you know this is a tender plant praise the lord it's a tender plant you have not seen Church trouble before and we hope that half of it don't come our way but you you see it's just like uh uh you know it's just like our our human life you know uh uh you get sick you get ill you stomp your feet you get caught and different things praise the Lord Brother William please have that brother sit straight and uh you know so all of those things uh we we go through so Church goes through the same thing we have a we have a a a big group of young people as they go through their seven years of uh changes in their life we have all of those things to deal with praise the lord it's not just coming and clapping our hands dancing to the music you know and a person come and and and preach and and all of that uh the church here is made out of families from different homes from different background you know different economic stat and different struggle and different things that they deal with the best thing you can do is to pray for one another praise the Lord is to pray for one another so we pray that the Lord will be able to help us amen we will do the best that we know how to do uh by by the word of God Amen if uh uh uh in as much as the Lord will give us Grace to be able to see situations we'll be able to deal with it praise the Lord and uh uh there are a lot of different family things we've been believing the Lord for we've been praying we've been working with and we trust in the Lord one thing I know the word works you know the word works this word works and uh uh no matter what the circumstance what I see or I feel the word works that's what I believe if you stay with the word word you will get the result of the word praise the Lord Lan now to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your path but baham says here present water from The Rock he said today we got the word we follow the word and we see the word working in the Believers and we know it so then God's working with us confirming the word with signs and wonder we stay with the word the word produces the result amen um okay okay so we we can take all of all of the time to to talk and then uh I will I will take the blame because I will end up preaching long and it looks like when will he ever stop let's stand to our feet and then we can take uh Psalm chapter 34 we can take Psalm chapter 34 praise the Lord if there is ever the time that we need his help is right now may the Lord come and be that will help praise the Lord amen Psalm chapter 34 let's read verse 7 let's read verse 7 let's read verse 7 maybe it will be a good thing let's read it together if you can see on the board or read it from your Bible let's read verse 7 verse 8 and verse 9 let's read the angel of the Lord encampeth around about

here uh we we are dealing with all of those things I mean if if there is something coming through your mind that uh you know you think it's not the right thing to think why am I thinking about this that's what he's talking about those are all evil spirits in war you know we deal with all of those things right here in the building yeah are evil spirits in world and and and uh Christians anointed you know uh uh and the angers of God encamped about them trying to energize them with faith praise the Lord amen while we are dealing with all of those things and uh the the encamping of the Angels uh uh uh they they are trying to energize us you know they're trying to to to to uh uh affect our spirit with positive things you know when you read the word maybe something in the scripture will cut catch your mind or something in the coat will catch your mind or of those things they they try to in use there to influence us by to energize our faith and yeah and yeah I am standing here just yielding myself and the Holy Spirit and moving and this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen the the the the the moving of the holy spirit being being affected by the by the bumping of angels and then trying to lift our mind on uh so no matter what we are dealing with uh we can we you know we can we can come up with a hope and you know and some courage that God is in control that God is able to deliver us that God can bring us through amen from that scripture that I just read I think God can bring or from that song I just listened to or from that testimony I believe that God is in control and all of those things are are the encamping of Angels trying to energize our faith amen trying to give us hope and courage from the word but remember Satan always he's always are the sons of God you know he always does that someone with a skeptic Spirit when they do that just he trying to interfere so what I say what is he saying you know the the enemy will not allow us he will just not allow us to enjoy this blessing of heavenly places praise the Lord he might you know were braking some kind of skp or unbelief and uh you know and people will have questions please if I preach you have questions you're free to ask me you know yeah you just free to ask me if you don't understand anything I said you're free to ask me you can wait after the service if not pick my number as the deacons they will give it to you there is no you know there is no fee you need to pay to come and see me praise the Lord I don't have no waiting list amen if you can come I can drive to meet you so praise the Lord so yeah but he would not he would not allow us you know to to enjoy all of that he will always hm really you know he I mean he just have a way of uh you know know we're playing with our thoughts you know and and and uh uh all because he want to interfere praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh and that is the reason why I believe that when we are not prayed up or when we don't come on time to pray you know when we don't use the prayer time come you come early you you you have uh uh a TI place and so all of those things is to help prepare our mind because you are listening to Something in the word you know you've been corrected by the word and something leaves on your mind it all helps to settle your spirit down because whether you are filled with the Holy Ghost or net you still have the possibility to pack an evil spirit whether you believe it or that praise the Lord yes you have the possibility to park an evil spirit it can it's it's as simple as just arguing while you are driving just as simple as there let me not bring no bad dreams just no I mean no you can't hear me no I say no and you finish putting out some energy you're all your emotions inside and and you are all is your mind is all caught up in death why can't you understand me I keep explaining this thing to you and you know and and all of that and then when you come right into service you are bothered by that it keeps playing on your mind praise the Lord you have just packed an evil spirit in the church as simple as that you have just packed an evil spirit in the church you are sitting there the people are saying praise God hallelujah you I de or you when we get home get home we'll have to solve this problem I'm tired with that blessed be the name of the Lord you are just blessed be the name of the Lord but your mind is seeing let's let's just get home praise the Lord it is just as easy it's just as simple as that just as simple as that praise the Lord you see and and and we have become so spiritual that we don't we when we come into church we don't even take a time to pray we don't even bow our heart down and say Lord I've come among your people please help me I'm not able to make it yet on time or Lord I'm yet and just clear my mind and father help me let me we don't we we so spiritual we are above that we must just step in we are we we we having Angelic escort into the presence of God praise the Lord and many times when the service is is not a blessing it's your own fault that's right it's your own fa because if you came from your house to hear from God and you came with a ready mind something will be said that will be a blessing to you praise the Lord I love this one also from the fourth seal trying to find my my place to Stand Here notice if you are an ambassador from Heaven All Heavens behind you if you are an ambassad from Heaven All Heaven behind you and Heaven is consist of the word this is Heavenly places this is Heavenly places right is the atmosphere is the word the atmosphere that the word create Heaven is consist of the word praise the Lord how Jesus said it Heaven and Earth will pass away my word will not right are we together now so that is what I want want us to be able to labor with praise the Lord that's what I want us to be able to labor with and uh uh let me let me step out here I know I'm I'm I'm out of time but uh uh many many has been uh sharing concern I I told Brother Jordan he was going to explain some of these things to us but I forget uh uh I know you it's it's kind of a strange it's it's winter time this building should be hot why are you feeling cold I know that has been the concern you I hear that I see that and uh but what actually is happening here is that after the the system was repaired the uh the uh the brothers set the system to the place where uh uh the the the system runs inia on cold but it is set up to about 74° and then out there it runs on heat because the building is so small and uh uh and and you know and we we uh when we come in our numbers we we fill this place so it's running on automatic so when you feel that cold breeze the system has just turned on and is pouring out there but after the while it will shut off and then our body temperature will rise it up again because if they should turn it on heat in no time we will start feeling uncomfortable praise the Lord and most especially for me you know I I have dry skin so my whole body start ising and then you think that I'm I'm I'm on fire I'm not on fire because I'm I'm inspired I'm on fire because my body is on fired you know so that's that was what they they explained so uh uh I I thought that I will have brother Jordan come and bring you a more a more decent uh uh but we keep Ming there we keep missing there so I just thought that I'll do my best to to explain that to you so maybe sometime we will getting up to do that now so let me get back to my thoughts so what we want to do here this morning in talking about the angels of the Lord and come about them that fear him I want us to to to travel in a way to be able to understand what I want us to establish is that when you go back I mean there there's a whole lot I get a bunch of quotes here I can use to preach the rest of the year and uh but when you go back you will realize that uh uh uh Angels were uh the the the first being to be created after God you know uh uh condens himself in the body of the logos for God to be God he was the self-existing one for him to be God God means an object of worship so he had to make Angels so when the Angels started worshiping him then they they bring to pass that that manifested his attribute of being God praise the Lord but this is where I want for us to to to to be able to Fellowship around this morning God you you read in the book of coluan the Bible say he created all things amen and there Paul express it in such a way that he created All Things by Jesus Christ it was not it was not the the body it was not the physical body of Jesus Christ but it was God in in in the in the in the tonic body in the logos body a body of light that was the first form that God took in the beginning when the Bible says there in the book of uh of of uh uh Revelation the beginning of the creation of God so God creating himself he was the great internal spirit and there was no time it was just internity so for time to begin God has to leave that form of being the internal spirit and be he had to take a form so the form that he took is what uh uh uh the theologians called the logos it's a body of light in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Bible says that uh you know he uh he's the light of the world so that light he took so when it was that light now that body of light that started creating everything so that body of light the lust is also called the word in the beginning was the word it was that body of light are we together I want to build a picture here so you can see it so when when God created the Angels the Angels were not they were worshiping the word the logos whether you want we want to call it the word or we want to call it the logos they were worshiping the word because that was the form that they could see now what I'm driving to yeah yeah you know I want to I want to get to the end of my seron before I even stop preaching it where I'm driving to here is for us to see that the Angels were created to income around the word so it's the word that attracts them the angels of the Lord are Income about them that fear Him those that fear the word so it's that reverence and respect of the word that that attracts them that's what I want for us to see that's what I want to establish this morning praise the Lord they were attracted to the word from the beginning because it's the word that created them that's what they worshiped so they will always be attracted to the word are we together is the light on praise the Lord because because if the light is on you will see it do you see it then the light is on praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of Praise [Applause] amen are we together okay if uh if if the light is on you will see it and uh uh so now listen to this at word listen to this let's let's take this together just want to steady here I don't have I don't have time so I'm just going to go I believe that even the Holy Spirit and Angel and all are just attributes of God is just a part of God it's his makeup a part of it that went off his spirit and so forth praise the Lord amen I know the thinkers are thinking I want to give you time to think praise the Lord because we have to realize this just like we said Wednesday night when Paul met those people on M hell he told him he said you are very superstitious you are saying to the unknown God this God you are you you trying to worship that you don't know I will make him known to you even in your own perm you says in him we move in him we have our being praise the Lord you say those things but you actually don't understand what you are saying praise the Lord so what we want to we we we want to help us to see this morning is that everything that God made came out of him everything that God made came out of him praise the Lord a good friend brother Looney he used to have this example Looney Jenkins he would say one time the scientist wanted to challenge God and say whatever you can make we can make the same God say okay okay I'm ready for the challenge praise the Lord the the stage was set and they says uh they told God okay let's let's get down to what whatever you may we can make the same God say okay may your own Earth made your own Earth because everything you have to work out of I made it are you seeing the picture I'm I'm saying this to be able to make the picture clear to you that everything that God made came out of him there is nothing that is made without him so I don't I don't want us to to to stumble of this when brother Bram says even the angels and the holy Spirit our attribute it's just a chip from the oblock praise the Lord are you are are we are we together amen you can see that's the reason why in everything that he made he represented himself everything that he made he made the angel he is the Angel of the Covenant yeah he make the son he's the he's the the the the how do you call it the raising son he make the mo he make the star he's the nothing star he make the tree he call himself the tree of life he make the lion he's the lion of the Trap of Judah everything that God made came out of him are you seeing the picture amen now think about it this this also we believe that God is om impress okay we believe that he's every word but he's not just every word as every word is everywhere praise the Lord because if God is every word God will be right in the heart of the drunker what makes him every word is his ability to know everything is his ability to know everything are we together praise the Lord if he's every word as every word is every word then there's no need of the Holy Ghost his ability to know everything there is not a fleet that flies that God don't know not a bling of an eye you can't run too fast that he will not see you are we together amen so it is just a chip off of the old block the Holy Spirit and angels are all just attributes of God it's just a part of God it's it's a part of his makeup his spirit and so forth that he created to be helpers Amen in his great office of Glory I believe they are just like secretaries praise the Lord amen we have the Holy Ghost it's just one Holy Ghost but it's in every one of us that have the Holy Ghost this morning are we together praise the Lord so that's that's i i i i i Dro this in year so we can see it he created that he created to be helpers around in his great office in glory just like a secretary and so forth to help carry on the master work is part of his attributes to carry on his work to help in the Redemption plan and program are we together to help in the Redemption plan in program now so with that being said we establish the thought that the Angels were first formed created and they worship the word they were around the lust praise the Lord and yeah also we seen that they they are they are they are also helpers amen they are also helpers I hav I having too much to say in the sh period of time I'm trying to to find a place where I can hold you this morning and then I can be able to leave you there praise the Lord now so you will see that you will see that uh let's go to Genesis chapter 16 there's another beautiful picture there uh it might it might help us Genesis chapter 16 there the story of hagga that's the story of hegar Genesis 16 that's the story of haar and uh we know the story he was an Egyptian M that was that was with Sarah and I want you to I want you to to see the connection here verse one now Sarah Abraham's wife be him no children and she had an herid an Egyptian whose name was hagga now uh uh uh it's it's very important for you to see that connection you will see where it comes where it will make sense to you and the scripture says here that uh then uh Sarah was the one that uh you know uh told Abraham you know I'm getting old I can have try take my handmade you know maybe you can have uh uh uh you know the the promised son you've been talking about promised son promised son maybe you can have this promised son with her now we know that her got you know conceived and then her attitude started changing now look at ver verse 5 look at verse 5 that first phrase in verse 5 is a Redemptive phrase the Bible says and Sarah said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee do you see that amen do you see that it's more than a prophecy than just a story Abraham was Christ we are represented in Sarah we must be able to see how he takes our wrong our Rong is upon him okay let's go ahead I have given my M onto thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the Lord judged between me in the and Abraham says you know uh that your M behold that made is in their hand and as it pleased the now what I want to bring you to is verse 7 that's verse 7 and and we know the Bible talks about falling angels you know it's all represented there in Genesis chapter 6 and all but for the first time that that the word the word if you look into your Bible search you will see when you put angels this will be the first scripture that will come up verse seven and the angel of the Lord found her by a found Fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the W of sh and he said Hager Sarah's made so you see her connection to the blessing was Sarah and the angel would not despise that no matter how much Sarah might have been mean to her her connection to told the blessing was Sarah right and the angel he said hi G serah mate when came it out and and you know the story and the angel verse 9 of the Lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself honor her hand praise the Lord so the the picture that here I want you to see here is that in in with with Abraham H H Abraham and Sarah were representing the elect amen uh uh uh haot is having the visitation of an Angel because of her connection to the elect the person that had the promised word from Genesis 12 the man that God called the one that God was dealing with was Abraham praise the Lord angels are in come about the word they are there to help the promise come to pass praise the Lord are we together you see there also with aimc when he took Sarah Angels Came on the scene he got an Angelic visitation why because he was tempering with the word praise the Lord oh i' I just I want this picture to to click because I don't have time amen the angels of the Lord are Inc about them that fear him so it's all about the word praise the lord it's all about the word let me tell you angels can protect you protect you keep you because there is a promise to be fulfilled and yet your body can go through hurt they are not protecting your body they are protecting the word they are there to keep the word am I making sense praise the Lord the angels of the Lord are in come about them that fear Him praise the Lord you love the Lord now this one will be a a a one that would be tough for you to swallow I'll give you some water to drink amen I'll help you for it to get down question and answer year the 1964 listen to this now there is an angel but this Angel of the Lord that income about those that fear them that fear Him see now it is in promise that Sinners has angers it's only the redeemed has Angels sir angels are messengers I want you to notice it so perfect and it will prove predestination yes sir to you yes sir praise the Lord are we together are we together praise the Lord the Angels were created to worship the word and when they were worshiping the word then the word now became an object of worship that's where our word god came from God is an object of worship so you will see that all through they are attracted to the word they are sent as messenger either to bring the word or to protect the word are we together so a person has to be a carrier of the word are we together a person has to be a carrier of the word you see that's the reason why that's the reason why you hear the word the word the word the word you know uh uh uh a brother used to fellowship with us he had a friend you know and and and he used to meet with me on the Bible status we meet during the week and then he would said to me and he says uh he say I I keep hearing you the word the word the word you know and uh I I love it I enjoy it but you know uh uh and and I know where he was going where he was going to is that he wanted me to give him something to practice because religion is easy that way it's very easy if you get something to practice you know I mean read the Bible in the morning pray if you make that your religion and you can just do that then you think that you have done what God has required you right but for God it's not how it works it's a relationship he wanted 24/7 yes sir whether you are at work or whether you are driving he want you to be able to live a life that will glorify him he want you to be thinking to him he want you to oh Lord thank you today it's a relationship it's not just coming just doing some few things okay yeah we sing to the service was good oh my goodness I taking on my church clothes now I I have to go you know then then the rest of the hour is for the devil so I I I saw where he was going you know he we will talk about scripture things and and uh uh uh you know in in my mind I'm saying I'm saying this guy is is uh I mean he's he's trying to he's trying to it's it's almost like what can I do is it's almost like Simon the Sorcerer he saw Peter then laying their hands on the S he was enjoying it wow man I've never seen this before at the end of the service he went he said Brothers there was B it was a good service service Jo what can I do man you know what is the requirement to be able to get that kind of a power right is it money to pay do I need to go to a certain School Peter say you and your money perish praise the Lord and that's what people want they don't want you to tell them what what what do I need to do to belong to this church is it a dress code do I need to walk a certain way praise the Lord all you need to do born be born again praise the Lord if you are not baptized be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he promised to give you the Holy Ghost and that's where the journey starts praise the Lord and because the devil don't like it he's going to give you the toughest time in your life let me let let me let you know right off the back praise the Lord so you see that's what brings the Angels that's what the angel in come about is that word because you are a carrier of the word there's a representation of the word in your heart and because you have a representation of the word there is an angel to watch over that word yes sir praise the Lord there is an angel to watch over that word and the sooner you you you you you you be you you start coming to the realization praise the Lord when that start bringing conviction to you Angels you know they don't need door keys to enter your room praise the Lord because you are a carrier of the word and God has given them charge over your life they don't need do you can't get in the room and like and say in you stay outside praise the Lord when Peter was in prison you know what happened they came to open the prison and and say let's go outside praise the Lord they don't need door keys to enter your room are we together you love the Lord this morning amen so when when we start becoming conscious of that that we now living an independent life we are a coding of the grace that God has given us God has deposited something in your life amen he see all your flaws he see all your mistakes he sees all your genetic connection the things that come down from your parents your habit your struggle he see all of that but yet he look beyond that and he dropped a representation in your heart and he gave his Angel to watch over that word praise the Lord Jesus said you have not choose me I Choose You are we together are we together you see so sometimes you have to give the Angels a tough fight when you get yourself in wrong places praise the Lord and you get yourself in wrong places and wrong atmosphere and and and and and and and think things we do and things we say you know uh uh uh brings about evil spirit around us listening to the wrong music and all of that you get yourself to the wrong place then it has to be a blood fight just like how the angels have to fight when Daniel was praying right while you are sleeping angels have to get a fight because those demons want to possess your body they want to drag the seed of God down in the D and the angel saying no way I'm giving charge to watch over this one yes sir praise the Lord you wake up in the morning I'm too tired I don't even know what to do but is my man my brain I'm just so tired I don't even know what to do it almost look like your brain is blank praise the Lord because all those evil spirit was speeding to take charge of you and angels are are trying to block them off huah if you get up in the morning now just one choice you're going to make praise the Lord amen if God will just be gracious and you will get up in the morning and not run for your phone to know what is on Facebook of this and you just drop on your knees and you just drop on your knees or pick up the word you have the Angels running your way because they are attracted to the word that's the reason why the last time when I said we don't have we never have a service with an empty church that's what I mean because wherever the word is those angels are attracted Jesus said whatsoever two or three are gather I will be there and when he's coming he's coming with host of angels praise the Lord You Have Become Angelic Association are we together glory be to God Amen my my my my it's becoming wonderful and the time is clicking it's telling me I have 5 minutes 5 minutes please close this service please do your best praise the Lord listen to this this will bless your heart too brother bam says I pray for people I pray for the people they go away and if they believe children in the wilderness praise the Lord they go away and if they believe they will get well if uh that feel th faith that prayer is set for that person and if they believe it the angel of God will watch over that person what is the angel watching over the word a word has just been applied they shall lay their hands upon the sck that's the word so the angel will watch over over that person they have to get well praise the Lord now you see there is a lot of things that works with that because I can take this very word they shall lay their hands on the sick instead of magnifying the word and making the people to know we are standing on the word of God if it is ever in my mind to make you to believe that I have some special gift right the Angels don't watch over my personalities they are sent to watch over the word so if I'm using the word to boast myself and sell myself to you now you have to watch also you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you have the spirit of God you have to wash those things don't swallow everything the man says brother B says they have to get well maybe not that hour maybe not that week maybe not that month maybe six weeks before they get well but they will get well they have got to get well if it is something from the word the word will not fail the word of God works sometimes the thing that will prolong it is our fear our doubt because when you are entertaining fear and doubt angels Don't worship those things Angels worship truth Angels worship faith when you say I believe believe it the angel say amen I believe it too let me read this to you we find a place to to close I have the rest of the year to preach to you amen so I'm not going to do all today but I think it will help you it will help you thank God I'm very I'm grateful the reason why I'm grateful is because I think uh I think the Holy Spirit have established what we want to say to you I think he has giving you a picture father the hour has come brother Bram say and he says uh uh uh the time had come after Jesus died after Calvary the time come that he must die for the sin of the word and he died just I call him to the scripture praise the Lord he di that's why Paul said in Corinthian cause everybody believe that line with the word when the time comes that it must be fulfilled and he died between two male factors they went by breaking their legs with Harmon and the Roman rise back their M now brother BR is is describing you Jesus by according to the scripture as as the evening time was coming the Roman soldier went with his hammer whatever he had in his hands trying to make sure that all of these guys on the cross is dead and he went breaking their legs and breaking their legs Jesus died according to the scripture and the scripture said now one of his bones will be broken so as he went about breaking the people bones when he got to Jesus now listen to what he said I read it to you he say an angel was there to make sure the word will not be broken praise the Lord he's in the middle how can you mess it why are you come from left to right you have to pass by the one in the middle how can you miss itall but an angel was there why because the angel must watch over the word you want to bring Angeles to your room stay in the word you want Angelic visitation stay in the word praise the Lord Lord he said what was it the angel of God stay at hand the time had come for the scripture to be fulfilled the same thing the Bible said talk about the the uh you know he will not see corruption praise the Lord it was a word and when that time came the the Angels Came and put those soldiers to sleep those Roman soldiers that were guiding guiding the tomb if they ever had a good night's sleep deep sleep deep sleep until they were snoring to their best because there is a word that must not be broken Hall so the angel just came and F him you love the Lord musicians come up we continue [Applause] amen praise the Lord whether you you you like it or not or believe it mean you can't believe in God if you don't believe that there is a devil there are evil powers that are out for no good they are out for no good I was going to go into St John chapter 10 but there is no time for us to go into that I I I'll take that another time and uh uh for us to see where brother B talks about guing Ines and how the works and uh uh and and what their job but this this was just to be able to bring us to the place to be able to see this there is a song uh uh it should be a it should be a very familiar song brother brother areel I think I sent I sent that to you uh I sure I sent it to you uh let just let's just sing that before we pray uh this morning uh bigger than all my problems

you to realize that uh uh I mean this is this is not uh uh playing you know uh uh church or playing games God have not called us to play games with our life he knows the end from the beginning praise the Lord and God is more involved in this than you and myself praise the Lord all he needs to get us from is all our church superstitions right all the things that we believe that we need to do for God to be pleased or we need to do for us to believe that we are worshiping God if we can just get ourself centered with the word Jesus said the truth worshippers will worship the father in spirit in
