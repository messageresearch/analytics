[40:41] you have done it in the name of Jesus
[40:43] Christ your friend
[40:45] amen
[40:46] praise the Lord
[40:48] um why are we still why we're still
[40:50] standing rest on our Bibles quickly
[40:54] so that we can sit once and for all
[40:57] Mark 11 22.
[40:59] it's a short verse
[41:02] Mark chapter 11 verse 22.
[41:06] I believe you you can know it of Art
[41:15] Mark 11 chapter 22.
[41:20] is on the screen I'll start reading I
[41:23] already did a verse
[41:25] and Jesus answering says unto them our
[41:29] face in God May amen may the Lord our
[41:33] blessings to renew this holy word
[41:35] you can please be seated now
[41:39] God bless you
[41:40] and welcome to the house of the Lord
[41:43] amen there is no better place to be than
[41:47] in the very presence of our Lord Jesus
[41:50] because we know by experience that in
[41:54] the presence of God there is fullness of
[41:56] joy our desires are met weakness are
[42:01] turned to strength ah Allelujah I
[42:04] believe that will be your portion
[42:06] tonight amen God bless you
[42:09] um hopefully maybe on Sunday we have
[42:12] more time for greeting but I bring
[42:14] greeting from my family my wife and
[42:16] children and the church and the pastor
[42:19] the our pastor called me today and said
[42:22] I should greet you in particular
[42:25] I believe you know him amen God bless
[42:29] you
[42:29] so this evening we are looking at a
[42:33] salmon title time-tested face
[42:37] time tested face I believe it to go with
[42:40] the prayers we have offered
[42:42] amen Jesus told us that nobody can
[42:46] receive anything of God except by faith
[42:49] we can only please God by face
[42:52] and faith is simple
[42:55] amen let me give you a little
[42:58] dramatization assuming maybe
[43:01] I'm starving maybe in the afternoon and
[43:05] then and then maybe you met me on the
[43:07] way I said what's wrong with you brother
[43:08] femi and I said look I'm so tired I'm
[43:11] hungry I need to eat something maybe you
[43:14] ask me what will solve my problem and I
[43:17] said maybe a loaf of bread and then you
[43:19] gave me maybe 50 cents assuming that's
[43:22] the price for a bread a loaf of bread
[43:24] you know at that time I don't have the
[43:26] bread
[43:27] but because I have the purchasing power
[43:30] for bread I will be as satisfied as ever
[43:32] and that's what it's called fits the
[43:36] evidence of things not sin hallelujah
[43:38] it's not as if the thing is already in
[43:41] your pocket but you believe that it's
[43:43] already there there is no more and iota
[43:46] of doubt amen so Brethren faith is
[43:50] simple
[43:51] it's the faith you need to sit on that
[43:53] chair
[43:54] if you don't have faith in that chair
[43:56] you won't sit
[43:57] you will ask the Deacon to replace it
[44:00] for you
[44:01] but because you know that this child
[44:02] will not fall you down you have faith in
[44:05] it God asked us to have faith in him
[44:08] it's a basic requirement for a Christian
[44:10] walk with Christ Hallelujah
[44:13] where we want to talk about time tested
[44:16] fit tonight there have been people over
[44:19] the ages who have expressed their faith
[44:21] and then events have shown that these
[44:24] people have faith in God and we have the
[44:27] testimonies there are examples for us
[44:29] today so that we can rely on them so
[44:31] that our own faith in God can also be
[44:34] sharpened amen and we saw in April 11
[44:38] god mentioned Enoch he said Enoch walk
[44:43] with God and it was not because God took
[44:47] him
[44:48] amen I think he was the first person
[44:50] that went in rapture
[44:52] Hallelujah and he did so by faith
[44:56] Hallelujah no wonder I suffered
[44:58] mentioned today that if we don't have
[45:00] enough Faith to heal a simple headache
[45:03] add the way I fit for rapturing face but
[45:06] Brethren if you are beautiful the
[45:08] Rapture the faith must be there amen
[45:13] maybe one day he left the home I said
[45:17] wife children I'm going to work I will
[45:19] be back
[45:20] but because he has lived a life that so
[45:23] please God the prophet said he eat the
[45:26] King's Highway
[45:27] amen one of these days Christ will come
[45:31] calling for us and that's how we know
[45:33] our home the Tana home is waiting for
[45:35] each and every one of us
[45:37] Christ promised us are going to prepare
[45:40] a place for you so that where I am you
[45:43] can also be there he said if it were not
[45:46] so he will have told us and so we know
[45:48] that Christ doesn't lie we have faith in
[45:51] him so Brethren I have a mansion over
[45:54] there I know you do too let's try by
[45:57] that amen no matter what we Face here is
[46:01] nothing to be compared with what will
[46:02] awaits us amen so Enoch one of those
[46:06] days he eat the king's iron and Bible
[46:09] said it was no more not because he died
[46:12] but he went with Christ and yet it is
[46:15] impossible to please God without faith
[46:17] so if Enoch was one of the people who
[46:21] had a time-tested face
[46:24] amen
[46:25] if we go back again where we have read
[46:27] we read Mark 11 22. Jesus admonished the
[46:31] disciples after An Occurrence the Bible
[46:35] told us that Jesus came to a fig tree
[46:37] then he went to it thinking that I can
[46:40] get some fruit
[46:41] but because the season of that fig
[46:43] wasn't yet
[46:45] he had no fruit
[46:47] but Christ said no man eat of you
[46:50] forever and they left
[46:53] and then tomorrow when they were coming
[46:55] the next morning Peter Observer and said
[46:58] Master look at the Fig Tree it has gone
[47:01] dried to the roots
[47:03] Christ only told them simple our faith
[47:07] in God and tonight I want you to have
[47:10] faith in God
[47:12] the prayers you have offered you didn't
[47:14] offer it unto man you did not do it as a
[47:17] religious exercise you did it because
[47:20] you knew God will answer you and I pray
[47:22] that God will back that Faith amen
[47:26] Hallelujah
[47:27] right from the beginning we have
[47:30] somebody like Abraham is a father of
[47:33] faith we all know that that Abraham
[47:36] believed God and it was counted to him
[47:38] for righteousness Genesis chapter 12
[47:40] told us that Abraham was an ordinary
[47:43] Idol worshiper like every other person
[47:45] in all
[47:47] and then they found Grace on the side of
[47:49] God and then God just come to him
[47:51] Abraham
[47:53] get out of your Kindred get out of your
[47:56] country get out of your family
[47:59] and then go to a land that I will show
[48:02] you
[48:02] I had known that many of us have had
[48:05] that call leave your denomination live
[48:07] your way of life follow God Brethren God
[48:11] will meet you at the points of your
[48:13] knees
[48:14] he met Abraham at the point of his need
[48:16] he promised him and he promises are
[48:19] still coming to Parsippany today time
[48:21] tested faith
[48:23] amen Abraham believed God he went into a
[48:27] country he didn't say go to the U.S go
[48:30] to Europe no just go to a place that I
[48:33] will show you and Abraham believed God
[48:36] he left took his father took Lord and
[48:39] all that he had and his wife and then
[48:41] left for that land we are talking about
[48:43] time-tested faith and after a while
[48:46] Genesis 22 God confirmed to him that
[48:49] this man he actually believed me when he
[48:53] asked him
[48:54] take that son that have given me after
[48:56] 25 years of waiting God gave him Isaac
[49:00] and then when is it was about 12 years
[49:02] God called him said Abraham
[49:06] take your only son even Isaac and go and
[49:10] sacrifice him in one of the mountains
[49:12] and Bible told us that Abraham did not
[49:15] even check check it
[49:17] it was just it was completely obedient
[49:20] to the word of God that is what faith
[49:23] can bring
[49:24] Hallelujah when you trust the Creator
[49:27] there is no mountain before you that we
[49:30] stand
[49:30] amen
[49:33] and Abraham when God told him he didn't
[49:35] check it just do as he was told and went
[49:39] to in the journey even the son Isaac
[49:42] asked my father he said here I am we
[49:46] have the fire we have the wood we have
[49:48] everything but where is the Lamb for the
[49:50] burnt offering and Abraham in faith
[49:53] responded the Lord himself will provide
[49:56] for himself a lamp
[49:57] Hallelujah
[49:59] and that was an example because when God
[50:03] saw in the Book of Genesis 3 after the
[50:06] fall when man fell God killed the lamb
[50:10] to make a clothing for them
[50:12] and he made the promises that without
[50:15] the shedding of blood there have been no
[50:17] remission of sin
[50:18] and he came around to tell us Romans 3
[50:21] 23 that for all I've seen and come short
[50:24] of the glory of God so no man's blood
[50:26] were able to redeem the other
[50:29] and so God like he did for Isaac he
[50:32] provided for himself a lamp which is our
[50:34] Lord Jesus Christ you know everything is
[50:37] in tight
[50:38] that's why um when Moses when God told
[50:42] Moses go to the Rock these people need
[50:45] water
[50:46] just speak to the Rock
[50:48] you know but Moses because of the
[50:50] pressure of the people
[50:52] you know it's not easy to lead people
[50:53] it's not the fault of Moses Bible said
[50:56] Moses is the meekest man among men
[50:59] but yet they made him angry
[51:02] and so when he got before the rock
[51:04] instead of speaking Bible said he struck
[51:08] it twice
[51:10] and then because it was a prophet of God
[51:13] God had to back him up
[51:15] Hallelujah I want you to see something
[51:18] there especially Who You Are
[51:21] if a child of God the prophet said if a
[51:24] son or daughter of God puts the word of
[51:27] God in this or Hamas is as good as your
[51:29] manipulation speaking Hallelujah God
[51:32] will back you up when you are inside
[51:34] this world
[51:35] amen and so Moses because he was a
[51:39] prophet of God God had to respond by
[51:42] giving them water
[51:43] but God call him aside why do you think
[51:46] it was so serious even Moses besought
[51:49] god many times God let me see this land
[51:51] not saying no you won't because the
[51:53] scripture must not be broken
[51:55] Christ can only be smitten once
[51:59] but Moses did it twice
[52:01] so God don't take his word for nothing
[52:05] Hallelujah and if we can have that
[52:07] Revelation if we can stand upon the word
[52:09] of God I believe we will see miracles
[52:12] Hallelujah
[52:14] and so we are talking about Abraham he
[52:17] told the son the Lord himself will
[52:19] provide the lamb for his own sacrifice
[52:21] and I say follow the father and when he
[52:24] was about to sacrifice the boy God said
[52:26] stop there
[52:27] now I can see that you have faith in me
[52:31] Hallelujah we are talking time tested
[52:34] faith
[52:36] and God provided for himself and then
[52:39] the child was spared and God wasn't
[52:41] satisfied he called again the second
[52:43] time
[52:45] Genesis 22 he said Abraham because you
[52:49] have not denied me your only son
[52:51] because of that I will be an enemy to
[52:54] your enemy I will bless you and I will
[52:57] multiply you and your seed shall possess
[53:00] the Gate of their enemies brother we are
[53:03] Abraham's seed not according to flesh
[53:06] but we are royal Seed of Abraham
[53:09] Hallelujah and we must possess the good
[53:12] of our enemies amen we are not a loser
[53:16] but we are winner by Design
[53:19] that's why if we look at Ephesians
[53:22] chapter 6 you can only see weapons in
[53:24] our front there is no weapon at the back
[53:27] because we don't turn our back to the
[53:30] enemies because we are more than
[53:31] conqueror through him that loved us
[53:34] Brethren let's have faith in the word of
[53:36] God
[53:37] Hallelujah we are talking time tested
[53:40] first
[53:41] and I've shown to you that faith is very
[53:44] simple
[53:45] just apply that's why in Egypt when they
[53:49] were to come out there was that final
[53:51] Passover what did God tell them
[53:54] kill a lamb apply the blood with isoplif
[53:58] by Abraham said ESOP is like faith a
[54:01] very common leaf
[54:03] for even the worldly people they apply
[54:06] Faith you know they have visions and
[54:08] they pursue it because they believe it
[54:11] will work
[54:12] Hallelujah you believe your service with
[54:15] God will work
[54:16] amen if God makes a promise it's not too
[54:20] hard for God to bring it to pass
[54:22] amen so Brethren let's have faith in God
[54:27] faith will do anything let me read a
[54:30] small quote for you
[54:32] time tested Faith paragraph I'm 17. you
[54:36] say anything faith has no bounds
[54:39] no limitation
[54:43] we see look at some examples of people
[54:46] who have applied for it he said now
[54:48] Faith we do just anything that you have
[54:52] in need of being done
[54:55] are we together
[54:56] whether spiritual whether it's physical
[54:59] whether it's for yourself or somebody
[55:01] else but around say faith will do
[55:03] anything
[55:05] if you will put it to work
[55:07] but most churches today
[55:10] that's as far as they teach
[55:13] just accept Jesus by faith and that
[55:16] settles it that's like a man that was
[55:19] eating a slice of watermelon
[55:22] he said that was good but there's more
[55:25] of it somewhere we can get more from God
[55:28] more than just salvation
[55:30] amen it's not just the death of the
[55:34] Cross it's not just for salvation
[55:36] it is for everything that we ever need
[55:39] throughout our life's journey
[55:41] amen oftentimes we should change
[55:44] ourselves
[55:46] but may the Lord open our eyes
[55:48] Hallelujah
[55:50] and then when a man accepts Christ as
[55:53] his personal savior
[55:55] then all the good things
[55:59] then all the good things that God has
[56:02] promised is laying right at his
[56:05] fingertips
[56:07] all he has to do is just to believe
[56:10] amen now don't go at it in a place where
[56:15] you are just oh I wonder if it will work
[56:18] just the same as you know you are going
[56:20] to get a drink of water
[56:22] or you are going to rise up and work if
[56:25] I want to get a water down there I will
[56:27] have to go work there and take it amen
[56:30] say you are going to rise up and walk
[56:33] across the floor that's just how it is
[56:36] simple to be about it well
[56:40] a man the Lord promised it that settles
[56:44] it
[56:45] amen just go on about it that's the real
[56:49] genuine faith
[56:51] if the Lord promises it that's it if we
[56:54] can find it in his word he said I will
[56:57] supply all your needs according to his
[56:59] riches in glory
[57:00] that settles it
[57:02] Hallelujah
[57:04] let's continue there have been people
[57:06] who have applied faith one of them
[57:10] is David
[57:12] I'm not talking about David as a king
[57:15] but David as a young boy
[57:17] who was a Shepherd boy
[57:20] you know perhaps forgotten by the rest
[57:22] of the family member but then your
[57:25] situation is irrelevant all you have to
[57:27] do is to connect yourself to Calvary and
[57:30] the situation will turn around
[57:32] amen oh don't say oh my family I'm the
[57:36] smallest it doesn't matter
[57:38] that's the same no matter how short the
[57:40] person is he can also see the sky no
[57:44] matter who you are you can connect with
[57:45] God
[57:46] amen
[57:48] and so this David was by there taking
[57:50] care of the Sheep
[57:52] and then we're about to say anytime the
[57:55] devil will call your hand it will
[57:56] challenge you but if you know where you
[57:58] are standing it will lose
[58:01] and so this David one day a beer many of
[58:06] us we have seen documentary of what a
[58:08] bear looked like it's not a small animal
[58:12] and then the bear came after one of the
[58:15] Lambs
[58:16] took it and then they will realize I'm
[58:18] the shepherd there
[58:20] that is my position
[58:22] I don't know what where God has placed
[58:24] you but he told us that whenever the
[58:26] soul of your fish are tread upon that he
[58:29] has given you Hallelujah Don't Be Afraid
[58:32] at work if God has put you there nobody
[58:35] can shift you you stand your ground and
[58:38] serve God's purpose Hallelujah
[58:42] and we saw that then we realized who he
[58:44] was and then that day I started to make
[58:46] a mess of his position as a shepherd and
[58:50] he went after the beer despite the size
[58:53] and everything he took back the lamb and
[58:57] then when the beer challenge he said I
[58:59] killed him
[59:00] Hallelujah
[59:02] and then the devil wasn't done
[59:05] he realized man I've got to take this
[59:07] boy down but you see nobody can take you
[59:10] down because if God put you there the
[59:12] devil cannot remove you let's believe
[59:14] that
[59:15] Hallelujah
[59:17] and then he sent a lion
[59:19] of course you know what a lion is it's
[59:22] more Fierce than the beer and more
[59:25] dangerous
[59:26] he came after one of the Lambs and David
[59:29] rely on the past testimony that God that
[59:32] delivered me from the beer of course he
[59:34] will do the same Hallelujah Brethren God
[59:38] that give you salvation he will give you
[59:40] healing it will give you your last need
[59:43] and it will take you home when the time
[59:45] comes Hallelujah don't think that we
[59:48] were just Christian we don't know what
[59:50] will happen what will happen we know
[59:53] Rapture will take place and will be part
[59:55] of it Hallelujah
[59:58] and so the lion came to and then we went
[1:00:00] after it delivered the lamb and killed
[1:00:03] the lion
[1:00:04] the devil wasn't done to realize
[1:00:06] something about this boy I've got to
[1:00:08] deal with him brother I know devil can
[1:00:11] deal with you
[1:00:12] because you are age about by the pillar
[1:00:15] of Fire
[1:00:16] hallelujah oh you say how do I know that
[1:00:18] go and read the book of Job
[1:00:21] is spelled out there that even as you
[1:00:24] are going everywhere you are going you
[1:00:26] don't know that you are protected that's
[1:00:28] why some of us we are afraid for what we
[1:00:30] should not be afraid of let's apply
[1:00:32] faith
[1:00:33] amen and then one day is that sent him
[1:00:38] go to your brothers at the one front
[1:00:40] check their welfare give them what they
[1:00:42] need I have some provision and then he
[1:00:44] went
[1:00:45] fortunately for Goliath it was at that
[1:00:48] time it was making his noise
[1:00:52] how who is that your God send somebody
[1:00:55] let him fight me whoever wins shall be
[1:00:58] this champion and all that and all that
[1:01:00] and David had it I said what who is this
[1:01:04] uncircumcisability that's defined in the
[1:01:07] army of the Living God and people say
[1:01:09] shut up
[1:01:11] everybody around for cover
[1:01:14] David couldn't understand why they're
[1:01:16] running because those people don't know
[1:01:18] who they are
[1:01:20] Hallelujah
[1:01:21] oftentimes Children of the Kingdom
[1:01:24] recognize who they are
[1:01:26] may God open our eyes give us more
[1:01:29] Revelation and understand of who we
[1:01:31] truly are
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:34] and then it wasn't satisfied
[1:01:37] they now told him this is what the man
[1:01:39] has been saying he said what shall be
[1:01:41] given to the man that kill him
[1:01:43] I want to know
[1:01:45] his brother's side they say oh baby you
[1:01:47] have started all they said he left them
[1:01:49] he doesn't have time for Frozen
[1:01:52] don't have time for that we Face our
[1:01:55] business because we know what we are
[1:01:57] talking about
[1:01:59] Hallelujah
[1:02:00] we are convinced and that's why we are
[1:02:02] concerned
[1:02:04] and then I moved to somebody that said I
[1:02:06] can do this job
[1:02:07] and they took him to the king
[1:02:09] time tested faith
[1:02:12] it wasn't David the king at that time
[1:02:15] it was just David the shepherd boy but
[1:02:18] the same Faith he had in God saw him
[1:02:20] through
[1:02:22] Hallelujah
[1:02:24] and then when he got to the king ah the
[1:02:27] King said oh I'm excited that we have a
[1:02:30] patriotic citizens you want to fight
[1:02:33] Goliath very good and then lecture them
[1:02:35] this guy he has been a Warrior from his
[1:02:38] youth in short
[1:02:40] it can't even carry his own Shield he
[1:02:43] has a special assistant for shoot
[1:02:45] carrying
[1:02:46] and everything and everything just to
[1:02:48] discourage this brother but David knew
[1:02:51] where he was standing amen he had an
[1:02:54] experience that nobody can take away
[1:02:57] from him
[1:02:58] break them with God who have experience
[1:03:01] and you cannot have that being just a
[1:03:04] church member you've got to find time
[1:03:06] with God a bad desert experience
[1:03:10] now you can say from this day I know the
[1:03:13] Lord is for me
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:16] and then the king told him all the
[1:03:19] stories and he said well the king I've
[1:03:22] listened to you you need to listen to me
[1:03:25] because I have something to say
[1:03:27] hallelujah what is your testimony
[1:03:30] Hallelujah
[1:03:33] pray until something happened because
[1:03:36] something has got to happen he said if
[1:03:38] you ask Matthew 7 7 you shall be given
[1:03:42] if you knock the door shall be open
[1:03:45] so why are the doors not getting opened
[1:03:47] let's do so in fact
[1:03:50] because God can never lie
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:54] he said King listen to me one time
[1:03:59] I was a Shepherd boy
[1:04:01] and then a beer
[1:04:03] they can say you mean
[1:04:05] a cat no a beer
[1:04:08] came after one of the Lambs I took the
[1:04:11] lamb and I kid you killed what
[1:04:14] they think it became becoming more
[1:04:16] interested saying that's not enough
[1:04:18] that's not all another time a lion came
[1:04:23] you killed a lion
[1:04:25] Hallelujah then the king knew that this
[1:04:28] boy has a testimony
[1:04:31] but the king wasn't satisfied is that
[1:04:33] okay
[1:04:34] you know I just need to protect you
[1:04:37] and now I want to give him coat of mail
[1:04:40] this coat of mail did not help the king
[1:04:43] the King was running
[1:04:45] but I now want to offer help
[1:04:47] Brethren let's be careful
[1:04:49] you know Hallelujah a Special Assistant
[1:04:52] you have some friend and so forth know
[1:04:55] where you get your advices from
[1:04:57] those advice is not even helping them
[1:04:59] how can they help you
[1:05:01] only the world can help you
[1:05:04] Hallelujah
[1:05:06] he said oh you need to put this on you
[1:05:09] know because that guy went through the
[1:05:11] arrow and all that they was okay
[1:05:14] put it on and Bible said I couldn't move
[1:05:18] that's what those ideas will do to you
[1:05:22] Hallelujah
[1:05:24] when they are contrary to the world you
[1:05:26] cannot move
[1:05:28] because you are World bound anything
[1:05:30] contract you will not move
[1:05:32] because I don't say a word for them you
[1:05:35] are not them
[1:05:36] he said you are a chosen generation a
[1:05:40] royal priesthood peculiar people your
[1:05:43] ways are different Hallelujah
[1:05:46] they are God may allow them but yours
[1:05:48] did not
[1:05:49] amen let's understand the differences
[1:05:53] and so I said King I have no problem
[1:05:55] this
[1:05:56] Lead Me
[1:05:58] what I have proven let me apply
[1:06:05] Goliath went down at the first strike
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:11] Hallelujah oftentimes when we watch
[1:06:13] those films themselves you try this he
[1:06:16] didn't it's just one
[1:06:18] what the first strike Goliath went down
[1:06:20] because it wasn't that stone it was a
[1:06:23] god behind the stone
[1:06:25] Hallelujah it is not you it's a promise
[1:06:30] Christ said the ones that I speak to you
[1:06:32] their spirit and their life those words
[1:06:35] are alive they created the world we are
[1:06:37] living in now
[1:06:39] amen let Brandon let's believe God
[1:06:43] and so we saw David he conquered Goliath
[1:06:47] just with the belief that God that did
[1:06:50] this for me yesterday he will do it
[1:06:52] again today because Bible said Jesus is
[1:06:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:58] if God has done something for you in the
[1:07:00] past by them believing for today
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] also we have another one Elijah
[1:07:08] we know if you Prophet Elijah they teach
[1:07:11] by Bible did not tell us any family
[1:07:14] history of Elijah he just said one of
[1:07:16] the inhabitants of tissue
[1:07:19] and then God spoke to him
[1:07:21] after he has prophesied you know he told
[1:07:24] Ahab look there won't be rain or due
[1:07:27] until I go for it
[1:07:30] and there I thought he was a joker in
[1:07:32] one of those crazy people they just talk
[1:07:34] anyhow but Elijah was certain of God he
[1:07:38] knew what he was talking about
[1:07:40] then after a while he had to knew that
[1:07:43] that man we need to look for him
[1:07:45] and Bible told us according to Obadiah
[1:07:48] that the search for Elijah everywhere
[1:07:50] and they get a confirmation oath that
[1:07:54] Elijah is not in the place but it was
[1:07:56] right there
[1:07:57] because it was protected
[1:08:00] Hallelujah we are in this world but we
[1:08:03] are not of the world
[1:08:05] sometimes they say are you still here
[1:08:07] I'm still there Hallelujah
[1:08:10] so Elijah now God told him after the
[1:08:13] dying of Brook charity God said go to
[1:08:16] zarifas I have prepared for you a widow
[1:08:19] woman
[1:08:20] you know you wonder how does God do
[1:08:22] things at times
[1:08:26] during famine
[1:08:28] it doesn't make logical sense but that's
[1:08:31] what God says and then it must be true
[1:08:35] sometimes it doesn't sound reasonable
[1:08:37] but brother and let's believe God
[1:08:40] amen okay so ignore I believe God and he
[1:08:44] went to zarifies and the Bible said when
[1:08:47] he got to the gate he saw the Widow and
[1:08:50] he said uh excuse me
[1:08:53] can you get me a cup of water
[1:08:56] and then the woman being a Christian
[1:08:57] because you know they've got to be of
[1:09:00] the same material
[1:09:02] if she wasn't a Christian when Elijah
[1:09:05] said give me a cup of what I say me an
[1:09:07] American woman obey you
[1:09:10] he will not work but there are the same
[1:09:13] material
[1:09:14] so when he told her she stood up saying
[1:09:18] okay while she was going here let's just
[1:09:20] say oh in addition bake me a cake
[1:09:23] he said as the Lord your God leave us
[1:09:27] I don't have anything the one I have me
[1:09:30] and my son that's what I'm preparing so
[1:09:32] that we can eat and die we are talking
[1:09:34] about time they said faith
[1:09:38] himself would be confused
[1:09:41] that what God what did God tell me what
[1:09:44] am I hearing but we are talking time
[1:09:46] they said face
[1:09:48] Faith doesn't look at the circumstance
[1:09:51] you only lean upon the word
[1:09:54] there has been a word to him that God
[1:09:56] here when you say this woman she will
[1:09:59] sustain you
[1:10:00] that's don't say the Lord the
[1:10:03] circumstance is irrelevant
[1:10:05] and I told her well
[1:10:08] go and do what you say but first big
[1:10:12] mind first for those fear the lord
[1:10:15] Hallelujah the Bible of me shall not
[1:10:18] waste not the crews of where dry unto
[1:10:20] the Lord God sent rain amen because
[1:10:23] Elijah believe what God told him so if
[1:10:26] this woman will sustain him then
[1:10:29] whatever she have must not finish
[1:10:31] it just follows brother and let's have
[1:10:34] faith in God
[1:10:35] amen and then also a man coming this
[1:10:39] same Elijah when he invited Arab and all
[1:10:43] the people
[1:10:44] and then I know the prophet of baby I
[1:10:46] believe 400 and they did all their stuff
[1:10:48] from morning till evening and they
[1:10:50] couldn't call any fire down because they
[1:10:52] don't have God
[1:10:54] the Bible said at the time of evening
[1:10:56] sacrifice
[1:11:01] even though we are calling god of fire
[1:11:03] but power down
[1:11:06] and they did it first and second and
[1:11:08] third time and then Elijah looked unto
[1:11:11] God he said God
[1:11:13] tonight these people know that this
[1:11:15] thing I have done is according to your
[1:11:17] word
[1:11:19] before I could finish fire came down
[1:11:22] amen if we are acting according to the
[1:11:25] word of God Brethren I believe God will
[1:11:27] respond
[1:11:28] Hallelujah let's move quickly also we
[1:11:32] have three Hebrew children
[1:11:34] all of us who know the story
[1:11:36] one time according to the prophet I am
[1:11:38] the prophecy of Jeremiah said they will
[1:11:41] go to captivity another 70 years after
[1:11:44] that God will bring them back these four
[1:11:46] boys they were among the people that
[1:11:48] were taken
[1:11:49] Daniel
[1:11:51] and Shadrach so they were there young
[1:11:55] boys like everyone some young people
[1:11:58] here today you know it doesn't mean that
[1:12:00] because you are young you should blame
[1:12:02] with the word
[1:12:03] because you are different
[1:12:05] Hallelujah
[1:12:07] we are a different people
[1:12:09] our ways are different
[1:12:12] and once you have made the call to
[1:12:15] follow Christ you must do so in totality
[1:12:18] amen it must be clear-cut
[1:12:21] Hallelujah so when they go out there
[1:12:24] they found favor and the King selected
[1:12:26] them among this special favorites to be
[1:12:29] fed with the king's meat and wine
[1:12:32] and then Daniel and the other three said
[1:12:35] no they went to the king's Chamberlain
[1:12:38] or the eunuch and say look
[1:12:41] um we can't hit this
[1:12:42] according to the promise of God to us
[1:12:45] and his word we don't take this kind of
[1:12:47] stuff and the the guy said what's wrong
[1:12:50] with you the king abortioned a portion
[1:12:52] for you if I didn't do that the king
[1:12:54] might kill me he said okay
[1:12:57] to avoid you being killed give us 10
[1:13:00] days give us pause and water and check
[1:13:03] what happened if we are not okay then
[1:13:06] give us that but we know our God will do
[1:13:08] something
[1:13:09] time tested faith and Bible told us that
[1:13:12] after 10 days they look fatter fresher
[1:13:15] and better than the others feeding on
[1:13:17] the other things Hallelujah
[1:13:20] and as if that is not enough you know
[1:13:22] one success leads to another challenge
[1:13:26] amen they often say during World of
[1:13:29] success is more work
[1:13:31] because this one is to try us to try so
[1:13:35] that the best of us can come out that's
[1:13:37] why we are here really
[1:13:39] you know we are element of Eternity just
[1:13:42] look into time we go back to Eternity
[1:13:45] but why that is going on God is putting
[1:13:48] characters in US
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:52] so then the King again had a dream
[1:13:56] and then when he woke up he couldn't
[1:13:58] remember the dream
[1:14:00] yet the dream was troubling him
[1:14:03] you know he couldn't remember and yet
[1:14:06] the thing is a burden to him so you call
[1:14:09] all the astrologers the magician all of
[1:14:11] them so all of you time has come you
[1:14:14] have been eating the king's meal come
[1:14:16] and do your work
[1:14:18] the second yes we are ready he said I
[1:14:20] had a dream last night
[1:14:22] and I need the interpretation okay no
[1:14:25] problem tell us a dream kings are
[1:14:27] forgotten
[1:14:28] huh
[1:14:30] the king said
[1:14:33] tell me now tell me the dream if you do
[1:14:36] then I will know you know the
[1:14:37] interpretation
[1:14:39] they told the king looking
[1:14:42] what you are asking for nobody asks for
[1:14:44] it in short only the gods whose dwelling
[1:14:48] is not with men they can do that they
[1:14:51] can't say you're alive
[1:14:53] it made another go and kill them if
[1:14:56] there is no solution so the weather go
[1:14:58] to Daniel
[1:15:00] and then the other three they call
[1:15:01] themselves
[1:15:03] they say oh King God they dream in this
[1:15:05] interpretation and order so the other
[1:15:07] three all of them they prayed
[1:15:09] I think Daniel chapter 2
[1:15:12] they pray God make a way for us show us
[1:15:15] what this is about so that your name can
[1:15:17] be glorified you know all these things
[1:15:19] therefore the glory of God not for any
[1:15:22] personal Glory
[1:15:23] you know we are not here for self-glory
[1:15:26] God owns all the glory our blessings is
[1:15:30] our portion and that's what we always
[1:15:32] get amen
[1:15:34] so they prayed
[1:15:36] and then God showed them the dream show
[1:15:39] Daniel and the interpretation so they
[1:15:41] came to the king's guide and said oh God
[1:15:43] has done something so when they brought
[1:15:45] down there before the king
[1:15:47] he said King live forever
[1:15:49] this is your dream
[1:15:52] say you saw a big image
[1:15:55] massive having the head of God you know
[1:15:58] chest and arm of silver belly and thigh
[1:16:02] of brass and then leg iron feet iron
[1:16:06] mixed with Clay they can say yeah that's
[1:16:08] what I saw
[1:16:10] and he told the Kings the interpretation
[1:16:12] you are the head of God we know we are
[1:16:15] in the Roman Kingdom you know Babylonia
[1:16:17] Greek I mean Gulf Pasha and then Greek
[1:16:21] and then Roman you know I told the king
[1:16:23] this what you saw and the King was so
[1:16:26] happy
[1:16:27] you know what the king said Bible said
[1:16:29] the king worshiped him
[1:16:32] I know Kings don't bow
[1:16:34] but in the case of Daniel the king
[1:16:36] worship we did not just worship he said
[1:16:38] they should make oblations to him
[1:16:41] like they make a sacrifice for that why
[1:16:44] do you think you did that because the
[1:16:46] magician told him Only the Gods
[1:16:49] can do that
[1:16:50] so inside Daniel as a god
[1:16:53] and he worshiped him and today Christ
[1:16:56] said he are gods
[1:16:57] Hallelujah brother you need to be bold
[1:17:01] to say I'm a saint
[1:17:03] just say I am a saint
[1:17:05] I don't live in sin I'm only goes
[1:17:08] through possession bring I mean
[1:17:10] confession bring possession
[1:17:12] amen the prophet said if you say you are
[1:17:16] a saint you live like a saint they say
[1:17:18] you'll become a saint
[1:17:20] Hallelujah so whatever you confess so
[1:17:23] you are right so let's confess positive
[1:17:25] all the time
[1:17:27] and so when the king believed that
[1:17:29] Daniel he was a god do you know what he
[1:17:32] did next
[1:17:33] Bible told us he made an image
[1:17:36] a great image of God the prophet told
[1:17:39] that was the image of Daniel
[1:17:41] that's why Daniel was not in the picture
[1:17:43] because he doesn't have to buy for his
[1:17:45] image
[1:17:46] but the three other brothers are in
[1:17:48] trouble
[1:17:49] say one Victory lead to another
[1:17:51] challenge
[1:17:53] amen Don't Be Afraid as they come God
[1:17:57] will lift you above them
[1:17:58] each of those trials they are for
[1:18:01] promotion that's why Try has come ask
[1:18:04] the students every time they do an exam
[1:18:07] they get promotion
[1:18:08] Hallelujah they are only learning from
[1:18:10] God's way
[1:18:11] so when you face trance and Temptation
[1:18:14] know that there is a victory ahead there
[1:18:17] is a promotion ahead you have to sow
[1:18:20] higher as an ego may the Lord help us
[1:18:24] and so
[1:18:26] the king said and everybody wants to
[1:18:28] hear the music sound just bow
[1:18:32] for this great image for that is now
[1:18:34] your God
[1:18:36] and the King cannot understand why
[1:18:38] anybody cannot bow for it last of all
[1:18:41] his own friends
[1:18:44] I saw the message got to the king that
[1:18:46] oh some of these people three of them
[1:18:49] they refuse to Bow Brethren are they the
[1:18:52] only Jews in in that Babylon
[1:18:55] there are many others
[1:18:57] but who are the people standing for God
[1:19:01] Hallelujah
[1:19:03] sometimes they will say you're the only
[1:19:04] Christian
[1:19:06] well I'm not I don't know whether I'm
[1:19:08] the only one but where I am I've got to
[1:19:10] stand for Christ
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] and so
[1:19:16] they can't come for them
[1:19:18] look my friends I you know I spoke
[1:19:20] timely with him he said I had
[1:19:23] but it's not a big deal
[1:19:25] are you ready to do it you know because
[1:19:27] instruction was anybody who don't do it
[1:19:29] they should be thrown into the fire no
[1:19:31] question but when they got to the king
[1:19:33] because they are who they are you know
[1:19:35] they are Governors and I say
[1:19:37] oh well I'm good are you ready there's a
[1:19:39] king who will not be careful to answer
[1:19:42] you in this matter
[1:19:43] we will not bow
[1:19:45] it doesn't matter if we are Governor or
[1:19:47] whoever's image you put there we will
[1:19:49] not bow we know that our god it will
[1:19:53] Deliver Us
[1:19:54] Hallelujah
[1:19:56] but even if
[1:19:58] he did not deliver us we will not bow oh
[1:20:02] Hallelujah those guys they were
[1:20:04] convinced and they were concerned there
[1:20:07] is no shaking they know where they are
[1:20:09] standing
[1:20:11] should be
[1:20:13] little wind air and their children Shake
[1:20:16] us you know those wings they are going
[1:20:18] to come
[1:20:19] they are to root us further
[1:20:21] you know have you noticed those trees
[1:20:23] when they Shake left and right front and
[1:20:25] back they gain more root
[1:20:27] that's what they are for Hallelujah
[1:20:30] and so the King was Furious
[1:20:33] say what are we talking about you guys
[1:20:34] are slaves
[1:20:36] and then you want to tell me what to do
[1:20:38] we can say the Bible said God the
[1:20:41] strongest man in Babylon to do what to
[1:20:44] bind them so that the hope of getting
[1:20:46] free is gone
[1:20:49] but now with God hallelujah Bible told
[1:20:52] us With God all things are possible
[1:20:55] amen even with you tonight
[1:20:58] hallelujah oh you said what are you
[1:21:01] talking about I'm standing by the word
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] and the King said bind them throw them
[1:21:08] into fire and crucify her several times
[1:21:10] more
[1:21:11] let me see the god that we delivered him
[1:21:14] he also challenged God
[1:21:16] and God had him
[1:21:19] Hallelujah when the enemies are calling
[1:21:22] your hand God is hearing them
[1:21:25] Brethren breathe a prayer to God be the
[1:21:28] one to God In Prayer and they will
[1:21:30] respond
[1:21:32] and then he throw them there Bible even
[1:21:35] told us that those men who threw them
[1:21:37] into fire they died
[1:21:39] by reason of the flame
[1:21:41] then after a while the King was
[1:21:43] expecting that I mean the furnace will
[1:21:46] have finished the work
[1:21:48] then he looked and he said please come
[1:21:51] counselors everyone how many people
[1:21:53] there and the second three
[1:21:56] you say look I'm seeing four
[1:21:58] loose Hallelujah they were loose they
[1:22:02] are not even bound anymore
[1:22:05] what did the fire do to them
[1:22:08] about
[1:22:09] Brethren when You Face challenges you
[1:22:12] overcome it gives you more confidence it
[1:22:15] gives you more courage you strengthen
[1:22:17] your wings you can fly higher amen
[1:22:21] time-tested face
[1:22:26] is like the appearance of the son of God
[1:22:30] how did you know how Son of God looked
[1:22:32] like
[1:22:34] you know you've got but I used to say
[1:22:37] something if God need to use a donkey to
[1:22:39] talk so that the way we open the donkey
[1:22:42] we talk
[1:22:43] Allelujah he did this for my balam
[1:22:46] anything that needs to move they will
[1:22:48] move
[1:22:49] when wrestling was blocking the road of
[1:22:51] the student he moved
[1:22:53] don't think anything too impossible
[1:22:57] Hallelujah and there's nothing too big
[1:23:00] for God to do for you
[1:23:02] Bible told us if he did not spear his
[1:23:04] only begotten son
[1:23:06] he put him on that cross so that you can
[1:23:08] be saved how much more will he freely
[1:23:11] give you all things
[1:23:14] Hallelujah and we are ready here tonight
[1:23:17] that all things we need we will get them
[1:23:20] by faith
[1:23:21] bless increase our faith
[1:23:24] Hallelujah and so the king look the
[1:23:28] appearance of the fort was like the Son
[1:23:30] of God he said
[1:23:32] servant of the Living God come out
[1:23:35] they came out what happened he made a
[1:23:38] decree nobody in this land should serve
[1:23:41] any other God except the god of Shadrach
[1:23:44] Meshach and Abednego time tested face
[1:23:49] Hallelujah
[1:23:51] you know in the passive Viara someone
[1:23:53] preached by the prophet he said all
[1:23:56] people in this world who have done
[1:23:57] something great he said they have had
[1:24:00] faith
[1:24:02] even physical things requires faith
[1:24:06] spiritual faith is inevitable
[1:24:09] let's put that our faith into action
[1:24:12] then we will see the results
[1:24:15] Daniel on the other hand
[1:24:17] it was he had his own too the devil
[1:24:20] won't leave him alone look my dad he
[1:24:23] used to say because he grew from the
[1:24:26] village
[1:24:27] he said he had you know all those
[1:24:28] Hunters we have hunters that are going
[1:24:30] to the forest to hunt games and so forth
[1:24:33] they used to have Hunter's bag
[1:24:36] you know they kill all these small
[1:24:37] animals he said if they are put an
[1:24:40] animal in the bag
[1:24:42] will they chase the animal again
[1:24:45] because it's already in the bag
[1:24:47] you are not in the back that's why the
[1:24:50] devil will not leave you alone
[1:24:52] praise the Lord but you can't be in the
[1:24:54] bag so you must be ready for him all the
[1:24:57] time but we lose Hallelujah if brahmanas
[1:25:01] don't know if you come a thousand times
[1:25:03] he will go back empty-handed because we
[1:25:05] are not afraid to the Satan amen we are
[1:25:09] more than conqueror that's what the
[1:25:11] world said
[1:25:13] ah
[1:25:16] my time is up
[1:25:19] can you give me like 15 minutes or
[1:25:22] something please
[1:25:24] thank you God bless you
[1:25:27] so it was he was there in his own side
[1:25:30] serving is God then they try to find
[1:25:33] their skills trying to find fault they
[1:25:36] can't find anything you know the law of
[1:25:38] the land
[1:25:39] can't touch Christians because so you're
[1:25:42] already living by Ayah law
[1:25:44] hallelujah what do they want to say
[1:25:48] it's just part of your life once your
[1:25:51] Holy Ghost is except when they now want
[1:25:52] to go against the world
[1:25:54] so for Daniel
[1:25:57] why is he wrong they cannot find then
[1:26:00] what did they do they made the decision
[1:26:02] we cannot find the spot they said by the
[1:26:05] love is God
[1:26:06] yeah you know that's what we are going
[1:26:09] to squeeze too when they look look
[1:26:11] there's nothing to say then they'll now
[1:26:13] go and do something contrary to the
[1:26:15] world but the prophet told us we should
[1:26:17] not be afraid that will be a short quick
[1:26:19] walk you will see spoken word in
[1:26:22] manifestation Hallelujah Brandon we
[1:26:25] don't need to work it when the time
[1:26:28] comes it will come to action you just
[1:26:31] being shaped amen
[1:26:34] that's what they say oh this is Daniel
[1:26:36] King you know you are such a wonderful
[1:26:39] King oh nobody like you you know once
[1:26:42] they start pressing like that be
[1:26:43] checking your back
[1:26:44] because there's something up
[1:26:47] he said oh King yeah nobody like you oh
[1:26:50] looking silky okay they say we have
[1:26:53] drafted a decree
[1:26:56] because you are so nice King
[1:26:58] scientists
[1:27:00] nobody prayed to any other God except
[1:27:03] for you you are such a nice King you
[1:27:05] have been meeting all our needs
[1:27:06] answering our request the king well okay
[1:27:09] he didn't look through you know he
[1:27:11] didn't see the end of it so he signed
[1:27:14] sillies
[1:27:16] and then they say God don't touch them
[1:27:20] Hallelujah
[1:27:21] the God cannot catch his own son
[1:27:25] his son they are always with him
[1:27:28] Hallelujah and so they now started
[1:27:31] watching
[1:27:32] the set watch Daniel's house they know
[1:27:35] nobody this is the man of course Daniel
[1:27:38] doesn't do show off Christians we don't
[1:27:41] do show off we just live our life
[1:27:44] Daniel he prayed the number of times
[1:27:46] open the window face the temple that's
[1:27:50] what he used to do and then they
[1:27:51] reported to the King King live forever
[1:27:55] did you not say nobody should pray to
[1:27:57] any other God except you say yes I did
[1:28:00] and there's someone down here he's doing
[1:28:03] that you see one of the slips
[1:28:05] and the Bible said the king sought to
[1:28:08] deliver Daniel from Monday to evening
[1:28:11] they said no King the love medicine
[1:28:13] doesn't change
[1:28:15] with God he must go to the Lions then
[1:28:18] oh Hallelujah
[1:28:21] when the devil is at work
[1:28:23] one thing I know is
[1:28:26] only working for God
[1:28:28] oh he said what do you mean brother femi
[1:28:30] God is his creator
[1:28:34] allow him
[1:28:36] Brethren don't let's give too much power
[1:28:38] to Satan he doesn't have it
[1:28:41] Hallelujah we are the one that Empower
[1:28:44] him
[1:28:45] make him think that he's strong he's not
[1:28:48] in short Jesus said cast him out
[1:28:52] that's all
[1:28:54] don't be I mean putrified and harassed
[1:28:57] or down because of him you speak against
[1:29:00] him in the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:29:06] but I say God bigger than the king who
[1:29:09] is still in the Play Hallelujah and then
[1:29:13] they say you must go into that place
[1:29:15] that's the law
[1:29:17] second no problem
[1:29:19] then they went joyful they can't say we
[1:29:22] are going to deliver you because I have
[1:29:24] labored sometimes they try to help you
[1:29:26] but vain is the help of man
[1:29:29] did not Bible tell us what to him that
[1:29:32] make flesh is trust let's put that trust
[1:29:35] in God all the time it cannot fail
[1:29:39] Hallelujah and then they throw him there
[1:29:42] waiting next morning the King was the
[1:29:45] first person there Daniel as your God
