========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] walked and poured water on the hands of the Prophet a great position he had but when he seen the the Syrian Army All Around dolphin had it all backed up he said my father look out there what a great number what while we're surrounded now that's sin natural whenever things seems to go wrong part the fer at she saying this and that and the doctor says you can't get well and so forth that's just the natural thing you think oh my this is the end but Elijah said there's more with us than there is with them amen now you can imagine how that Prophet or that Gesa fell the servant he looked over at him he said why don't see nobody he said God open this boy's eyes and as soon as God did something here it is get it when God opened his spiritual sight amen all around that prophets stood Chariots of Fire and angels of fire amen why he seen the why the cherish the fire outnumbered that Syrian Army by the Thousand the mountains is on fire angels of fire horses of fire Chariots of Fire and the Bible said the angels of God encamp about those who fear Him just the same tonight I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike across your eyes and say look standing around this Tabernacle tonight you'll be a member here the rest of your life sure Hallelujah yes sir sometimes you can't see with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it something near a sick sense that denotes something is near watch him this morning opening up the deaf ears making the PO old cripples walk around here like there was nothing wrong with them what is it it's the incense I mean the sense the six sense it's conscious the spirit that something is there have faith in God now they didn't he didn't see that first but Elijah probably didn't see it but he asked for the boy's eyes to see it but Elisha was conscious that they were there amen amen amen Thomas one time said let me put my hands in his side Jesus said now you see and believe how much greater is their reward who has never yet seen and yet believe amen that's us tonight and whosoever will believe without seen and notice then El walked out there to where this circumstance was and he said to them first he went out there and the Bible said he smok them blind blind and walked right out to him everyone had perfect eyesight as far as I know but the scripture said they were blind amen amen a little fell a few nights ago said to me if you be a man of God smite me blind I said you're already blind amen already already blind notice and he walked out there to where this great circumstance was this great thing was and he said do you look for Elijah said yes said come on follow me I'll take you right to him Elijah said it to them what was they blind about they were blind to the fact that that was the prophet of God they were blind to it and he led them right straight down in the Ambush again amen said come on I'll show you Elijah and it was Elijah taking them down there and when they looked around and found that there surrounded around the king said my father must I smite them he said would you take a prisoner and smite him said give him something to eat and send him back to their country that's the way to settle Wars isn't that right turling oh my if we had only adopt that principle today de feed your enemy amen do good to those that do evil to you amen Holy Name there now the blindness now Elijah I mean not Elijah now but Daniel Daniel fora he was a prophet he saw the coming of the Lord he saw the end time come he saw the Gentiles start and if you notice the Gentiles started off with a uh idol worship they is wor in a great Idol setting out in the field an idol of a man I believe Daniel himself because King Nebuchadnezzar had called him Bel toer which was his God and he started to Worship in an image of a righteous holy man and Daniel refused to do it so did the the Hebrew children the Shadrach mishak and abedo that's the way it was issued in and it was condemned that head of gold was issued in by image worship forced to it and ended up in a supernatural hand writing a supernatural language that only Supernatural understanding could understand it amen that's the way the Gentile Kingdom issued in and go out the same way by Supernatural Works Supernatural inter interpretation amen you know what I'm talking about the working of the supernatural amen oh how marvelous aren't you happy tonight you believe in the Supernatural yes now then after these Visions he showed him just where the nations would be standing he showed him how that there were so many years depended yet on the Jews he said the Messiah shall come he'll prophesy in the 70th weeks which is 3 and 1/2 years in the midst of it he'll be cut off which is 7 years 70 weeks is determined for thy people seven years of Prophecy to the Jews he said in Messiah the prince shall come and prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks seven days will he be cut off in the Abomination make of desolation shall stand in his place and they'll tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem Gentiles for a time time and dividing of time now when Messiah come Jesus he preached exactly three and a half years and was cut off for a sacrifice the daily obligation was taken away and the desolate the Abomination that make a desolation the mosim of om was stood today in the place of the Holy Temple amen the mouth of R stands exactly where the temple stood and he said that they would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem over jerus Jem until the Gentile dispensation be finished but at the end of the Gentiles there was still be three and a half years yet to the Jews now notice one of the most striking things of prophetic history I don't claim to know the prophecy of the Bible but this is like reading a newspaper amen more plain and what we read year we know is the truth notice 2, 2500 years the Jews has been scattered to every nation under Heaven as God hardened Pharaoh's heart bringing them back he hardened Hitler's heart miscellaneous heart and so forth till he drove them back to Palestine amen coming back they have made him a nation again and on May the 6th 1947 11 the Jewish flag was raised over Israel for the first time for 2500 years the oldest flag in the world was raised for the first time and 2500 years and he said in the last days he' raised up an ins sign over Jerusalem sh that the time is at hand and notice here not long ago I seen a prophetic real played from over there and they're bringing in those Jews by the thousands by airplanes you see it in the paper and so forth look and life Magazine's been packing it thousands of Jews returning and they asked them said what are you returning for old crippled people packing them on their backs their long young ones was said are you coming back to the Homeland to die said no we're coming back to see the Messiah amen amen Jesus said when you see the fig tree putting forth its buds amen and all the other trees amen putting forth their buds know that time is not or spring is now summer so when you see these things come to pass lift up your head am your redemption's drawing n amen tonight as this world is honeycom by communism oh I was talking to a man a while ago on the one of the best Authority I believe it I know of and when he spoke things concerning this nation and communism it would shake you to your knees right hi it's honeycomb there's nothing solid no more not even in our own country Harley there's only one solid thing all no will stand that's the rock of Jesus Christ we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved and in this day when everything else is falling we have a solid foundation the Lord Jesus Christ come into it friends it's a shelter in a time of storm a marvelous thing he's seen all this coming to pass we see the Jews now the Bible said that Jerusalem and it would Blossom as the rose and how they have irrigated that land and they also the prophet spoke and said that day that water will come from the north there was no water there then no springs there then but in the last few years there a gusher come up am and water in the valleys and they're irrigating as one of the greatest agricultural spots for its size in the world Amen prise the Lord thank and all these great chemicals right in the Dead Sea there's enough chemicals found in the bottom of it that all the wealth of the world couldn't buy amen of chemicals uranium and everything else right in the bottom of the Dead Sea which now belongs to Israel fig tree putting for this buds not only that but the other trees are putting forth this buds amen the Communist is putting forth bugs the Antichrist is putting forth bugs and the Church of God is putting forth bugs Hallelujah she's blooming out into her power again the Palmer wor eat part of it the caner worm eat part of it the hookworm eat part of it the caterpillar eat part of it but God said it'll live again she's putting forth buds now the trees are putting forth buds His holy name Daniel fora it and rejoiced now at this time he said and at that time the 12th chapter and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince of standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such was never since there was a nation even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book [Music] amen oh my aren't you glad your name is on his book when he Daniel over here saw him come to the Ancient of Days whose hair was as white as wool and they opened up the books and they were judged every man out of the books the great white Throne judgment now Daniel is given this assurance at the end of the Gentile dispensation read the when you go home and Zar read the 11th chapter you can see how the King of the North is coming down which is nothing else but Russia coming down to press against it like a whirlwind and the great battle of army geddon will be fought right there near the Gates of Jerusalem am notice oh I love this and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that's been found written in the book the Lamb's Book of Life Michael the great Prince shall stand up for what for thy people amen amen all right and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake when when these times take place and some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contentment just as sure as there's an everlasting life there's an everlasting departure amen it determines on how you treat Jesus Christ in your life amen if you love him and born again he got Spirit you got everlasting life if you don't you have not everlasting life if your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life you have Immortal Life if it's not written there you'll not be recognized what is it all those prophecies are fulfilled everything right down to this time the head of gold has passed away as Daniel said it would the Babylonian Kingdom succeeding that he said would be the Ms and persas they succeeded the Babylonian Kingdom and they fell away to who the grecians Alexander the Great and they fell away to what the Romans and the Romans broke up to all the world eastern and western Rome the two legs and he said Iron and Clay was on the toes the 10 toes the 10 kingdoms and he said they wouldn't mix that inary among one another romanism and protestantism and in that day when this thing exist then the stone was shoot out of the mountain without hands and rolled in it broke the thing to pieces and it took the place of the image so my brethren we're having troubles tonight Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and diverse places perplex of time distress between nations I've just come back from overseas and I haven't seen a nation but what's trembling in their they don't know what's going to take place next but aren't we thankful tonight that we do know what's going to take place next the Lord Jesus Christ shall come the second time in glory and majesty and every this town written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall rise with their loved ones to meet the Lord amen oh what a marvelous thing that's the reason we say our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness amen All Around My Soul gives way he's our hope and state and at that time Michael should stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and Michael fought together or fought against each other brother and now and at that time he said as many was found written in the book was delivered and those who have done righteous watch this and they that and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the Furman and as the and they that turn away man your rightness as the Stars forever I look at that sometime I think Brethren I go out of the morning I love to get up early don't you like to rise early I remember when brother and I were in the mountains real early in the morning around 4:00 we'd rise up look hanging back there and there was a Morning Star it gets real dark just before the break of day we see the darkness Gathering now what is it it's light pressing against the darkness one has to give away all the creeping things that's been running through the night when that sun comes up they take to shelter when the light shines night and dark night and light cannot exist in the same building it's either dark or it's light and light is so much more powerful in darkness so is Christ so much more powerful in all the the world Amen prise now we're taught by scientists as the light begins to come it condenses the darkness and the Darkness gathers all its host together to fight against the light but the light prevails and comes on Amen and the Bible said the last [Music] days
