[1:49] we just forgot about it now this is
[1:52] something that I have to say I don't
[1:53] like to say it but it has to make the
[1:56] truth see and that's what you won't
[1:57] always tell the truth no matter what
[1:59] takes place years that pass was never
[2:03] noticed and I say this not because she's
[2:06] sitting there because I say it when
[2:08] she's not there you know that I don't
[2:10] believe there could be a better wife in
[2:12] the world
[2:12] my wife and I hope she always remains
[2:14] that way and I want to be a loyal
[2:16] husband now hoping every young man in
[2:18] this building when he gets married gets
[2:20] a wife like my wife I don't know how
[2:22] long we live that way but I hope the
[2:24] rest of our days on earth we've been
[2:26] very happy together
[2:27] God was the one who told me to marry at
[2:29] the same time her not knowing I was
[2:32] trying not to marry her not because I
[2:34] didn't love her but because I didn't
[2:35] think I was able to make a living far
[2:37] and she's a fine woman and I just didn't
[2:39] deserve that and she went out to pray
[2:41] and open up the Bible and yes she said
[2:43] Lord I've never did this before but give
[2:45] me a scripture that'll help me if I got
[2:47] to forget him I've got to forget it
[2:49] open the Bible she went out a little
[2:51] shed and prayed and when she opened the
[2:53] Bible up Malachi for behold I sent her
[2:56] to you Elijah the Prophet before that
[2:58] was at was 20-something years ago
[3:00] knowing nothing about the ministry this
[3:02] date now I was couldn't but I was laying
[3:05] down the river there and he woke me up
[3:07] one night I heard him stand out of the
[3:09] door
[3:09] he said go get her and your wedding
[3:11] shall be this coming October the 23rd
[3:14] and that's just exactly what I did and
[3:16] we've lived happy by the grace of God we
[3:19] never had one word she's been a
[3:22] sweetheart one day I come in and she's
[3:25] had to raise these children by herself
[3:27] me gone in the ministry not many women
[3:29] but put up with that you know that that
[3:31] be hardened I come in and she said
[3:35] something we got Joseph back there and
[3:37] he's a he sure is a boy and he puts some
[3:41] of the gray hair in his mother's head as
[3:43] well as I did so he was a real a tall
[3:46] boy and he had done something real bad
[3:48] and I said to her she said to me bill
[3:51] give him a lickin I said I ain't got the
[3:56] nerve
[3:58] and she said yes if you had to put up
[4:01] with it and she slammed the door at my
[4:03] face well I thought that's all right
[4:07] poor little fella didn't mean that I
[4:09] just won no not to wash my car and when
[4:12] I got out there the Holy Spirit didn't
[4:15] like him he said go tell her believe it
[4:20] second chronicles 22nd chapter I thought
[4:25] first I just imagined I just kept on
[4:27] washing and it's ending again gold tell
[4:31] her to read this now when he got to
[4:34] Bible and read it it was where no our
[4:37] Miriam the prophetess made fun of her
[4:41] brother Moses for marrying an Ethiopian
[4:44] girl and gob didn't like it he said been
[4:48] better than a father Spitler facing and
[4:49] done that so Miriam broke out with
[4:52] leprosy all over and so Aaron come told
[4:56] his sister said come told his brother
[4:58] said she's dying with leprosy and so
[5:00] Moses running to intercede for her at
[5:02] the altar and when he did the pillar of
[5:04] fire come down God he said go call her
[5:08] and Aaron and bring him here Aaron was
[5:11] in a tube so I said Paul him to come
[5:14] here he said if there be one among you
[5:17] God speaking out of them that spiritual
[5:19] or a prophet I the Lord will make myself
[5:22] known to him I'll speak to him in
[5:24] visions and reveal myself to him by
[5:26] dreams and reveal dreams and so forth he
[5:31] said but my servant Moses there's no one
[5:34] in the land like him he said I speak
[5:37] with him from lip to ear he said didn't
[5:41] you fear God see God didn't like it well
[5:46] when I seen that I run in and she's in
[5:49] yoruba knocked on the door she shut
[5:50] herself up now I told her I want to
[5:53] speak to her I went in there and talk to
[5:55] her try to tell her what it was I said
[5:57] sweetheart you know how I love you but
[6:00] God didn't like that you all just said
[6:03] that immediately after that she took a
[6:06] trouble in her side we took her over to
[6:11] the
[6:11] dr. Lovell dr. arthur sheen and he found
[6:16] a tumor on the left ovary that I'd found
[6:22] 1516 years before tumor on the left
[6:25] ovary about the size of a walnut
[6:28] I said what about it doctors said let's
[6:31] see what happens
[6:31] bring her back again in a few months
[6:34] about two months or something we tuck
[6:35] her back he had grown from a walnut to
[6:38] about sizable lemon to better come out
[6:41] to get soft and turn malignant I said
[6:44] well my I said we're going to Tucson the
[6:48] Lord has sent me out to Tucson he sent
[6:50] her up to a female specialist he didn't
[6:52] want it on his hands so he must have
[6:54] told him about my ministry cause he
[6:56] don't the female specialist said we'll
[6:58] have to come out so he said we told me
[7:00] is going to Tucson he said well I've got
[7:03] a specialist there a dear friend of mine

[7:15] and so forth it turned tumor then and
[7:17] said how big it was and said I know you

[7:23] me a divine healer that's not what you
[7:24] know what I would put it but said I have
[7:27] agreed that it could come out if it has
[7:29] to be taken out take it out but it's
[7:32] testing our faith constantly we prayed

[10:35] don't let it be malignant
[10:37] and let that doctor wait till after the
[10:39] first year to take it out I just hate to
[10:42] see her as the Lord she didn't mean what
[10:46] she did that morning she didn't mean
[10:48] that
[10:48] as a lord not one time and she ever said
[10:52] one word about me going in the meetings
[10:54] to M months or whatever it was not one
[10:56] time is she ever open her mouth about
[10:58] she's always set my clothes to the
[11:00] cleaners and wash my shirts and had
[11:02] everything ready to go in the meeting
[11:04] then she wonders how she can serve God
[11:06] you women as you serve your husband you
[11:11] serve God of course and now and then
[11:14] when I come in all tired and wore out
[11:17] people coming from everywhere I'd have
[11:19] quad somewhere on a fishing trip or Hunt
[11:21] trip while many women would have blown
[11:23] up at that what'd she do got my hunting
[11:25] clothes ready for me to go let me go I
[11:29] said Lord she didn't mean that
[11:31] now I said she's had to be cut open
[11:33] three times on account of she's to
[11:35] Syrian and I said uh lord I hate to see
[11:38] her have to do it again just then I
[11:40] heard something in the room I looked up
[11:43] and a boy said stand up
[11:45] so now whatever you say that's the way
[11:49] it'll be
[11:50] now Whigs met I said before the doctors
[11:55] hands shall touch her
[11:56] the hand of God shall take the tumor
[11:59] away and it won't even be found that's
[12:02] settled it to me I never called her we
[12:06] went long went got Billy Lewis when
[12:07] Shreveport next time I call her she's
[12:09] happy she's in a bit I want to tell you
[12:11] I hear she isn't she can verify this
[12:14] I had to hop her way over there went in
[12:16] the room with the nurse and mr. Noland
[12:18] put her clothes on for the gown for the
[12:21] examination the doctor came out and she
[12:23] could hardly get on the table the tumor
[12:25] hanging up there so big and when she the
[12:29] doctor come in was talking to her and he
[12:31] come over to Ray's back the sheet to
[12:33] touch her and just before he touched her
[12:36] it left and the doctor didn't know which
[12:42] side it was on he said wait a minute
[12:46] weather draw diagrams and all the
[12:49] pictures and everything else
[12:51] he couldn't find one trace of it
[12:54] examiner over and over he said I might
[12:56] not be able to explain it but Miss
[12:58] Brennan that tumor isn't there and she's
[13:02] never had one symptom of its center
[13:06] what was it notice just exactly the way
[13:09] it's saying before the doctors hand can
[13:13] touch it one split second and his hand
[13:17] would have touched it
[13:18] how perfect is the Word of God there's
[13:23] my wife and we're both before God but
[13:26] before the doctors hand could even touch
[13:29] her body on the road coming to her like
[13:32] that something happened the tumor left
[13:35] and they could he he said I believe it
[13:39] was when his sweetheart I want to
[13:40] reassure you miss Brennan is that right
[13:42] away he said it that's right that that
[13:45] tumor isn't there you don't have any
[13:49] tumor I was it just exactly according to
[13:54] the word of the Lord that was holy amen
[13:59] that's the fifth time five is a number
[14:03] of grace a number of FA rth - there's no
[14:08] more doubt in my mind I don't know what
[14:10] the third pull is now and what it does I
[14:14] be revered just keep quiet the hour or
[14:19] sooner I where God is going to do some
[14:24] great things for us now
[14:27] let us bow our heads for a word of
[14:30] Prayer Lord Jesus I'd seen it upon other
[14:34] people but when he come to my own
[14:37] precious wife it was in my home landlord
[14:40] I looked at it with my own eyes felt it
[14:45] with my own hands and I be sixteen years
[14:51] before that it was also Lord knowing and
[14:55] revealed by you when anything is spoken
[14:59] it must be done you were showing me Lord
[15:03] then that my
[15:04] confidence and what you're done for the
[15:07] people and would let me know so I could
[15:09] help them you brought it to pass in my
[15:13] own home that was the first pull and now
[15:17] the third pull confirmed the first pull
[15:21] we are thankful Father forgive us of our
[15:26] shortcomings we are a small people
[15:29] we are uneducated more or less than
[15:32] illiterate people but we are so thankful
[15:35] that we have a great omnipotent God who
[15:38] watches over and cares for us for we
[15:41] don't know how to care for ourselves we
[15:43] commit ourselves to you now father I
[15:46] pray that you'll help me and in this
[15:49] third poll may old Lord as you've been
[15:54] speaking for the last couple of years
[15:56] about it showing it on marking on
[15:59] mountains and so forth and bring it on
[16:01] up now I was watching to see what it was
[16:05] until it was completely confirmed now I
[16:08] pray father that you'll help me to be
[16:11] more revered with this than it was
[16:15] before and may you get glory as right
[16:18] over this same pulpit where the first
[16:21] was said the second and now the third
[16:25] and what you have said has come to pass
[16:28] exactly what you said we believe you
[16:31] Lord God help every one of us to throw
[16:36] away our disbelief and our superstitions
[16:40] that we might stand in the presence of
[16:43] the Living God knowing that the same God
[16:46] that took that tumor from my wife is
[16:49] sitting present now verified by some of
[16:52] the highest medical science we got in
[16:54] the country yes who examined it and then
[16:56] looked and pictured it and now it's gone

[17:03] you and we love you because that you
[17:06] have you have let us become your
[17:09] servants and may we serve you with
[17:11] reverence and honor all the days of our
[17:14] life
[17:15] granite Lord may I be able and
[17:17] my family and all these people be able
[17:20] to be shining lights salty salt that
[17:24] will create a thirst and others to love
[17:27] this Jesus that has done so much for us
[17:31] now as I open the word to read it for
[17:34] our little cakes and then pray for the
[17:36] sake help me Lord speak to to us and
[17:39] heal the sick in Jesus name we pray amen
[17:43] amen
[17:45] would you have I got time so just first
[17:48] about hurry real quick own some texture
[17:51] I want you to read now or markdown or
[17:54] whatever you wish to do the first one is
[17:56] found in the Book of Numbers 21 5 to 19
[18:02] and we want to read this and the people
[18:07] speak against God and against Moses
[18:09] wherefore have you brought us up out of
[18:11] Egypt to die in the wilderness or there
[18:15] is no bread neither is there any water
[18:18] and our souls Lord this light bread
[18:22] angels food and the large sent fiery
[18:26] serpents among the people and they bit
[18:29] the people and much people of Israel
[18:31] died therefore the Lord therefore the
[18:34] people came to Moses and said confession
[18:37] launch we have sinned that's the first
[18:43] thing for healing confession first we
[18:46] have sinned for we have spoken against
[18:52] the Lord and against thee pray unto the
[18:55] Lord that he may take away the Serpent's
[18:57] from us and Moses prayed for the people
[19:00] and the Lord said unto Moses make the
[19:03] fiery Serpent and set it up on a pole
[19:06] that it shall become come to pass that
[19:09] every one that is bitten when he looketh
[19:13] up on it shall live and Moses made a
[19:18] serpent of brass and put it up on a pole
[19:21] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[19:24] had bitten any man when he beheld the
[19:29] serpent of brass
[19:31] he lived now also I wish to read a
[19:35] scripture out of Zechariah the twelfth
[19:39] chapter the tenth first and I will pour
[19:42] out upon the house of David and upon the
[19:46] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[19:49] grace and of supplications and they
[19:53] shall look upon me whom they have
[19:56] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[20:00] one morning for his only son and shall
[20:05] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[20:08] in bitterness for his first-born now for
[20:14] a text I'm going to take this look away
[20:19] to Jesus
[20:22] look away from the world to Jesus Moses
[20:26] made the Serpent and here the prophet
[20:30] later was speaking of it what would
[20:33] happen looking away to to Jesus the
[20:37] Bible said in isaiah 45:22 we find that
[20:42] God said look unto me all the ends of
[20:46] the earth and now when the Earth has
[20:52] come to its end or the system of the
[20:56] earth has come to its ends
[20:58] let the people look unto him now you
[21:02] might say we have heard this generation
[21:06] after generation we've heard this for a
[21:08] long time that is true has been preached
[21:12] for a long time
[21:13] many ministers has took this same text
[21:16] thousands of them but here is the thing
[21:18] I want to ask you tonight for these next
[21:20] few minutes but when you look the
[21:25] question is is what do you see when you
[21:28] look what do you see when you do look
[21:34] that only depends on what you're looking
[21:38] for now I said look unto me all the ends
[21:42] of the earth
[21:43] Moses lifted the serpent up never who
[21:45] look got healed now it depends on what
[21:51] you're looking for I've seen people come
[21:54] in to the meetings in this last day
[21:56] could only be able to set in the meeting
[22:00] for just about one or two minutes that's
[22:03] all they could stain hey they couldn't
[22:06] stand it I never forget I hope this
[22:08] don't reflect on any bar from Iowa when
[22:11] I had the meeting at Waterloo Brotherly
[22:14] bail he was sure this morning I don't
[22:16] know where he shared an honor a yearly
[22:18] he was sure this morning oh yes back
[22:21] over in a recording record all right
[22:24] brother Lee and I done everything we
[22:26] could and give the Ministerial
[22:28] Association of breakfast free just to
[22:30] come down and speak to them brother Lee
[22:33] bailiff course is a scholar and and a
[22:36] Doctor of Divinity if he really earned
[22:39] his degree and so I try to get him to
[22:43] speak before these Lutheran
[22:45] Presbyterians and so forth but he said
[22:48] no they're looking to you to do it well
[22:50] I went out and took my text before these
[22:53] ministers said that all got through
[22:54] Eaton I took my text I was not
[22:57] disobedient to the heavenly vision no
[23:01] more than I'd read the scripture about
[23:04] to look out the door they win so as I
[23:08] started to say as Paul in his day with
[23:12] an odd ministry and now he stands before
[23:15] grip and said that he wasn't disobedient
[23:18] to it about two or three morgana ever
[23:21] time I got to where I could say
[23:23] something about the text it was just
[23:25] about three or four set in there that
[23:27] all got up and gone the reason of it is
[23:31] is this some come to a meeting when they
[23:35] hear of an evangelist the way he dresses
[23:38] has something to do with the people if
[23:40] you don't wear the right kind of clothes
[23:42] some of them I heard a psychologist
[23:45] state of the day doctor narramore
[23:47] a fine man Christian man his programs
[23:50] don't care they're all dumb he said the
[23:53] way to tell that a man was losing his
[23:56] it's when he didn't dress according to
[24:00] his disposition you know the High has to
[24:03] appear before the public that was a sign
[24:06] that he was losing his mind well then
[24:09] I've been crazy all my life and hey cuz
[24:12] I wear overalls and everything's so
[24:16] fitting to my position I must dress like
[24:19] a clergyman in other words to be a
[24:21] clergyman I don't think Jesus dressed
[24:23] like a clergyman he dressed like an
[24:25] ordinary man he went in among men and
[24:27] was nothing dressing but that's just see
[24:30] how that the ideas of man it doesn't hi
[24:35] about if this man I wonder what the
[24:38] doctor think of this one a prophet in
[24:40] the Bible was commanded to strip off his
[24:42] clothes and walk naked before the people
[24:44] he really would be crazy wouldn't you no
[24:46] but God told him to do it another one
[24:49] had to lay on his side for three hundred
[24:51] and forty months I believe it was laying
[24:54] on his side one side then turned over
[24:56] the other side and eat a pot of little
[24:59] that he had made there to go and see
[25:01] this stuff and make it up together and
[25:02] eat it all that time to reach over get a
[25:04] handful and eat lay it on his son for a
[25:06] son hmm oh how far people can get from
[25:11] really a word of God they just get so
[25:14] educated till they educate themselves
[25:16] away from God when a man talks about
[25:19] he's got a education I know that's just
[25:20] how far he is from God
[25:22] a doctor's degree not saying this
[25:24] against doctor of a uncles he isn't that
[25:26] time but usually when a man gets a
[25:29] doctor's degree that just means to me is
[25:30] that much farther from God unless he can
[25:33] hold himself to the word into God now we
[25:37] find out that some comes to hear the way
[25:40] you speak when they come to look you
[25:43] talk about divine healing and the Lord
[25:45] if a man isn't typical uneducated genius
[25:49] that people just can't stand here and
[25:52] use words as he isn't hatin and words
[25:55] like they just they don't they think
[25:57] that's way away from God and when Jesus
[26:00] spoke sat simple language until the day
[26:04] it's got the professor's confused for
[26:07] they tried to interpret it
[26:09] according to the scholarships and the
[26:12] language of that day and it was Street
[26:14] language therefore while there's so much
[26:17] difference even here in our United
[26:19] States I call from Florida to New York
[26:21] and had to get a woman at over here to
[26:24] st. Louis to translate between this
[26:27] southern girl that northern girl that's
[26:30] how much difference there was me
[26:32] certainly now the thing of it is that
[26:36] people look for those same speeches and
[26:39] still of the word the word being
[26:43] manifested is the evidence that it's
[26:45] right I think the word being manifested
[26:50] they'll never look at that you've got to
[26:54] have an intellectual conception to know
[26:57] ago at the seminary and learn how to bow
[27:00] how to stand in one place and all that
[27:03] would choke a minister to death that was
[27:05] really filled with the Holy Spirit wow
[27:08] that's interesting and that's the way
[27:11] that this whole nation is got it's got
[27:13] an intellectual conception of Christ
[27:16] that's what they look for and if Christ
[27:18] is in you you've got to be a scholar you
[27:21] got to be an intellectual cause that's
[27:24] what they think Christ is and another
[27:26] time another thing they form their own
[27:28] opinions what he ought to be their own
[27:32] idea instead of taking what the word
[27:34] said that's the way when they look and
[27:36] even see Jesus himself they failed to
[27:40] recognizing they did it on the day of
[27:42] Pentecost they did it when he was in
[27:44] flesh they did it when he was in the
[27:46] manger
[27:47] they did it when he's on the streets of
[27:48] Jerusalem they did it when he's on the
[27:51] cross and he was the fulfillment of that
[27:53] word and yet they had the Messiah coming
[27:56] down on a Carter out of heaven and
[27:57] everything else and was wrong because it
[28:00] was their intellectual conception and
[28:02] they failed a scene and looking right at
[28:04] him so is it today what do you see when
[28:08] you look some look to see when they look
[28:11] at him they look to see some great
[28:13] intellectual Church founder somebody who
[28:16] can really produce a creed that will
[28:19] cause all the people to fall for this
[28:21] cream
[28:22] something you know that's what they look
[28:24] when they see some look to see a myth
[28:27] like Santa Claus when they look to read
[28:29] the Bible and say oh that's a mythical
[28:31] thing it's just something that man wrote
[28:33] that's what they call us when the what
[28:35] opinion you take of the Bible is what
[28:37] you take of him thing some look to see a
[28:40] baby some look and see a rabbit or Santa
[28:45] Claus some look to see some historical
[28:48] book that was yesterday enough today but
[28:52] the question is what do you see when you
[28:55] look so many of you that claimed to have
[28:59] the Holy Ghost look and see the second
[29:04] person of a Trinity
[29:08] when it's not even mentioned in the
[29:10] Bible there's no such a thing the word
[29:13] Trinity is not even in the ledge of the
[29:15] Bible but yet when you look at Jesus you
[29:19] regard him as the third person or the
[29:22] second person of a Trinity and that's
[29:26] the reason you go get nowhere you know
[29:29] what he said I am God and there's none
[29:33] other besides me depends on what you're
[29:37] looking at if you want to put some
[29:39] little mascot boy in an old man with
[29:41] beard and so forth if that's what you
[29:43] look at Jesus as being some different
[29:47] person from God you're looking wrong you
[29:50] don't see it here not long ago I was to
[29:53] hit a pair of field-glasses I was trying
[29:56] to watch some antelope or an antelope
[29:58] over in the field and my son was trying
[30:00] to show me he's quite a bit younger so
[30:03] he said take on glasses daddy there's
[30:04] sense antelope right out there I said I
[30:06] can see him with my natural eye he said
[30:08] take these glasses when I looked I've
[30:10] seen about ten antelopes but the glasses
[30:14] was out of focus and when I went to
[30:17] focus them in all ten of them become one
[30:21] if you focus your mind the God's Word
[30:27] the three will be one
[30:29] [Applause]
[30:31] but your ecclesiastical glasses get out
[30:34] of focus when you try to make him three
[30:36] he's one thing but it depends on what
[30:40] you're looking at what do you see when
[30:43] you do look remember you can only see
[30:47] him as you look at him through the word
[30:49] you can't look at it through a textbook
[30:51] you can't look at him through a Creed
[30:53] you'll see two or three gods and
[30:55] everything else name Creed's
[30:56] but look Eddy to the word and you'll see
[31:00] that he is Emmanuel God made flesh among
[31:05] us he said I'm guarding besides me
[31:09] there's none other he's gone I say look
[31:12] one time the Prophet and when he's seen
[31:16] Jesus my subject is looking to Jesus
[31:18] look away to Jesus when I say it looked
[31:21] away from the worldís Eve he said I see
[31:24] a counselor a Prince of Peace the mighty
[31:28] God the everlasting father
[31:31] that's what Isaiah looked away and saw
[31:36] Daniel one time we're standing when he
[31:39] saw the the ending of the Gentile
[31:42] kingdoms he saw the image that
[31:45] Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed he saw how
[31:49] each one would succeed the other as he
[31:51] come down and when he looked to see what
[31:55] it was all going to happen at the end
[31:56] when he saw Jesus he was a stone you
[32:00] dial him out without hands that crushed
[32:03] the Gentile kingdoms never can Izzard
[32:07] told three Hebrew children in the fiery
[32:10] furnace that believed in God and stood
[32:12] on his word if you had to die for it
[32:14] there's go to stand anyhow just a little
[32:17] thing of bowing there needs some other
[32:18] way but when he looked away and saw
[32:22] Jesus he was the fourth man that was in
[32:25] the fiery furnace and it kept all the
[32:28] heat off of his obedient servants that's
[32:30] what Nebuchadnezzar saw Ezekiel looked
[32:33] away to see one day and he was a wheel
[32:36] in the middle of the wheel we're up in
[32:39] the middle of the air he was a hub to
[32:41] the wheel where
[32:43] ever spoke is fastened to a man the big
[32:48] wheel run by faith but the little wheel
[32:50] turned by the power of the Lord
[32:52] that's ooh Ezekiel saw when he looked
[32:55] away John the Baptist looked away one
[32:59] day and when he did he saw a dove and a
[33:03] voice saying this is my beloved Son in
[33:07] whom I'm pleased to dwell in that's what
[33:10] he saw
[33:10] then he saw Jesus and God being the same
[33:13] person goes the spirit come down from
[33:15] heaven like a dove saying this is my
[33:17] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[33:20] that's what II saw notice he identifies
[33:27] himself in that way Noah when he looked
[33:32] away to see Noah saw the just judgments
[33:36] of God coming upon a people of this
[33:40] world who had rejected his word that's
[33:43] what Noah said when he looked away Moses
[33:47] when he looked away he saw a bush on
[33:50] fire a pillar of fire had brought itself
[33:54] back into a bush and when Moses dropped
[33:57] close to it he said take off your shoes
[33:59] for I am huh if you'd weigh that word I
[34:04] am it's past tense present tense and
[34:09] future tense I am eternal see I am he
[34:14] saw the I am that's what he saw in the
[34:18] burning bush Israel looked at the brass
[34:21] serpent that Moses made and saw the
[34:24] suffering of Christ for the judgment for
[34:27] the sink bar we know that the serpent
[34:29] spoke of the atonement Jesus was that
[34:32] atonement as Moses lifted up the brass
[34:34] serpent in the wilderness so must the
[34:37] Son of Man be lifted up for the same
[34:39] purpose see why they had sinned and I
[34:43] got sick that was for the taking away
[34:45] their sins and for their sickness and
[34:47] that's what Jesus was wounded for our
[34:49] transgressions with His stripes we were
[34:50] healed take divine healing away from
[34:53] Christ you cut half the atonement into
[34:55] what are you seeing when you look do you
[34:57] see that do you see that he was wounded
[35:01] for our transgressions with the stripes
[35:03] we were healed when you look away can
[35:06] you see that or can you just see one
[35:08] side of the atonement can you see both
[35:11] sides of it when you look if you look at
[35:13] through the Creed they'll tell you the
[35:15] days of healing is past but if you look
[35:18] at through the word you'll see he's the
[35:20] same yesterday today and forever the
[35:25] disciples looked to him when they were
[35:29] in a trouble see and they saw the only
[35:32] help that could help him coming Martha
[35:36] looked to him in a time of death and she
[35:39] saw that he was a resurrection in the
[35:42] life amen in time of death Martha saw
[35:48] when she looked at him he had been
[35:51] rejected by her people you have been
[35:54] turned down even she had sent for him
[35:57] and he did not come to her brother but
[35:59] when finally he come and she went and
[36:02] fell down so she could look at him she
[36:04] found
