Lord God your strength is made perfect in our weakness Lord God I love the scripture said it many times that you wrote it in there that you are member that we're but dust in this flesh it's just dust

do above and beyond all that we ask or think Lord God we love you Lord we just pray for the service tonight get brother one out of the way Lord God and may we pull on that Lord gone we love you Lord we appreciate you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord amen let's see you know I'm gonna share this so I just had I wasn't going to last week not not at all I don't really care where anyone stands on politics but I felt like going to see what was up so I went to the Trump rally it was very exciting and I prayed before I went I was like god I'm gonna stand in line for hours let me stand in line next to someone that would be a blessing like let me let's let it be a connection for some reason ended up standing next to this couple or you know standing waiting sitting you know laying down like he's just waiting for hours and we ended up talking about God for a long long long time we ended up having once we got into the arena and stuff I mean that there Secret Service everywhere there's we we stood for hours waiting in the arena and we started talking about God I mean and come to find out like they it's really hard to explain but they've had miracles they've had lots of miracles they have prayed for tons of people they got kicked out of their church because so many people were getting healed that's the way that they put it they they said literally with their own eyes they saw someone's leg grow to be the right length as the other leg with their own eyes and they were just so like excited so we had up sharing testimonies my my aren't my I had goose bumps for like an hour I'm not even kidding and I was like this is weird like I was not expecting to have Church tonight and it was great and and you know we just talked about God for a really really long time probably four hours straight and what ended up happening though is you know we just prayed right there and we did we prayed for a while this right at there was a million people around us to think 20,000 people and we just prayed right there and you know and not not at all bringing politics into it at all but it was what was in interesting was we're here were praying and we pray for sister quiche together and we prayed for a couple other / burns and we're just praying away and then someone over the speaker says let's just start this rally tonight with a word of Prayer while we were praying and so I don't know what it means I'm not not at all saying hey it was the Lord that it was supposed to Trump's gonna win like no not at all but it was in or I felt in that moment I was the right thing to do I was supposed to be here I was supposed to meet these people I don't know why God knows God knows and I don't know if they'll come or not but they said that they were coming so eventually we'll see that they're gonna come visit our church so we'll see because they like to praise and they like to pray and so it's interesting they had a lot of testimonies and it was weird I actually thought about I was like man they sound like mom and dad kind of like a mix between mom and dad and some other people I know it's like the one the stories they were telling I was like you sound like people who are about to come into the message I didn't tell them that but I was like this is funny like this is weird and I don't know I don't know what will happen but you guys keep them in prayer Travis and his wife Jess and I just uh I don't know Lord knows all about it I just you know was funny for me because I hear I was I realized I and and I did just kind of mention you know just to kind of bring it up into conversation who really like hey have you heard of William Branham and because they talked about the event they've been studying Azusa Street and stuff like this and I was like you know like heaven he's like no one ever heard about him like okay you know do your research do your studying you know I just mentioned like Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and tried to bring some more just some more things for them to start considering because you can see that they're looking for something you know they talked about conspiracy theories and all this so they're just looking for everything they're looking for something everywhere they're just digging in ever you could just see they're just digging in everywhere trying to find truth and I just it was amazing something and I just I don't know it was amazing cuz I was there and I was standing there and I was like man I got a I got a testified it like I got I need to win them here or something because I've been praying lately it's like God if I don't you know I want to be involved with it one soul that I know it's like God I had an impact on this person that I know that I did like I want I want to know that I want I don't know not for my own glory but I don't want to feel like I've just been a bump on a log but my whole life like I want to be a part of that and then here it is I have I just been praying that recently I had this opportunity and it's like I'm talking to them I might the goose bumps or I'm like gods here I know like this is not a coincidence this is there's a reason for this and I just you know something came over because I'm like man I feel like I should be more like like studied in like let's go through the five comings of Elijah or you know something like that but I realized like in that moment it was like you know you've been in these situations before and the key is rest rest yield take no thought what you should say and rest and just let it come out just just let just let say whatever comes to mind let it come out because it's God we're not relying on our own intellectual faith we're not here to convince anybody not here to say let's open our Bibles and debate you know we're not we're not and they they're the ones that said hey we're coming to your church I didn't even invite them I don't like I don't know if they'll actually come but it's like god that's something else that is something else so I just wanted to throw that out there because that happened this last week and it just encouraged my heart and the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you know we have to trust these things as being true and real because God said so not because we feel anything or because we're excited that day or like you know or whatever it's all about being sensitive to the will of God in the moment in the time and letting God speak so anyways I'm not supposed to be preaching tonight so I'm not going to do that I just it encouraged my heart and keep them in prayer

take none for me to yours too right right oh yes righteousness is what I Oh righteousness righteousness is what you want from me [Music] okay actually been thinking about town and just believe in the Lord I started thinking about you know like Paul says in the book of Corinthians Eicher itself should teach us and nature is creation praise lord nature is creation and when you read the Bible in the Bible the first verse in the beginning God created the heaven in the air praise the Lord it's amazing when when when you know when the Lord put some things on your heart in you and you started thinking about it in a way that he brings it out is it becomes beautiful I was thinking about it God giving us the Creator there was the first way that God revealed himself in the beginning God created the heaven in the air in the last way that God reveal himself is also as a creator amen 2:7 church age the Bible says he you revere himself as Jesus speaking the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God praise Lord and creation is is an ongoing work there is a reason why from the first day God created the second day he created a charity he created when it got to the 6th day he made a man in His image to continue because creation is a continuous work praise the Lord what is redemption creation to bring back what was lost what is salvation creation what is healing creation praise Lord let's just take these few per burden tonight and then we will go into the word brother Samuel Ortega when butter Lord was praying he says he says Lord get better one out of the way that says he surely did it tonight brother Samuel Ortega was was supposed to be preaching for great ministry tonight but there was a change of schedule so you will speak for us tonight and sister Mary Hoffman is now well and I think brother Don how to take her for a therapy today so out of that kind of a rock into the schedule so we have our brother with us and so he will you come up in and just here so we would will remember sister Mary I spoke to burden on the weekend and he shared a little bit of a health with me and our sister is fighting that devil of cancer and we pray that a law with kind of a brain divine healing praise the Lord amen and like I said I spoke with sister Kish and she's doing okay she keep trust in the Lord we spoke a little bit and she told me she says brother wanna have him and devotion this morning and I was just saying to the Lord you know she said she was saying to the Lord because what is happening to her now the different medication she been taking is the reason why she came with their pain in her legs and they had ruptured the kneecap you know is the side effect of the medication so she's dealing with pains Europeans in her legs and being trying to take her to therapy for how to walk so she said to me she said were wanna just praying I said all God you you know I'm trusting you and believe in you and and you know and and this has happened to me and in a way that she said it I said to Horace's I said as a sister Kish God has been our hero don't never make God the bombing of your movie he's always the hero praise the Lord you know it's just a human expression the way we humans react when something happen with it so God why you allow this once in one sense nothing evil will happen except the Lord allowed it that's a truth but also the way you approach that in your mind sometimes it's like really God you really allowed this to happen so it looks like now he's the one that is doing it praise the Lord don't make him the bad man of the movie because he's the hero amen God is the hero and he will remain the hero at all I said God is the hero praise the Lord so and that's that's what is happening to her I think she told me they were going to see her tonight and see if they will let her go home tonight or possibly tomorrow so she's dealing with that legs and and and you know and and that that just how it is that's that's the beauty of creation for it to ever get beautiful it got to get ugly amen in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the F was with our form and darkness was upon the deep a hard to get ugly before it becomes beautiful praise the Lord and and just just seeing they're out of the scripture and and you know and some of the things that brother Branham shared I mean it's just it's just kind of a blow my mind praise the Lord all of these things that we're doing is all creation amen you had a birthday this year is a creation you had a status change as a creation going to a new job it's a creation going to a new school is a creation creation is an ongoing thing because God is in Tanner praise the Lord so let's just bow our heads tonight you I just think is famous correct chorus we sing all the time creating me creating me [Music] [Music] creating me hélène [Music] every new the rice peering with me [Music] creating Oh [Music] and renew the right spirit with me Laure cast me not away from your presence [Music] take not your Holy Spirit from me yes restore to me the joy of their salvation every new derive spirit with me without the music now yes more cast me not away from

Prayer amen let's pray all night him and father we come again before thy presence because Lord you have called us into this word Lord and we know in the beginning there was a word and the word was recorded the Word was God and father Lord we believe this one we know Lord we are believing you thank you Lord Jesus for calling us to walk in thy presence now or father our recovery here more we believe that you're the high priest we start by the feelings of our infirmities glory know every need of ours our desires King of glory Lord you say come unto me all of you are heavy laden and I shall give you rest father Lord may you speak to us Lord in your own way because what we know faith comes by hearing and by hearing by the Word of God you add our faith Lord from glory to glory as Lord we are walking in this heaven way God we know that child may be a highway Lord and the writers are walking it help us father Lord just to be encouraged by your word Lord you speak once in your way Lord because father Lord I'm just a human being I don't even know what to say I don't have what to say I want to depend on you Lord may the Holy Spirit come down and speak to us King of glory thank you Father Lord bless the reading of the word hear no no what in Jesus Christ name Lord we pray amen amen god bless you yeah just for a word of encouragement may not just take long but I won't invite your attention the book of Genesis was just wondering why God put in my heart to speak this Genesis chapter 12 and we round-trip from bus now we are ready from Genesis chapter 15 sorry Genesis chapter 15 and we are reading from verse 1 to 6 Genesis chapter 15 from verse 1 to success after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram my shield and I exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will now give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house in this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said Behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is my hair and behold the word of the Lord came at him saying this shall not be thine hair but he that shall come forth out of thine own balls shall be thine hair and he brought him forth abroad and say look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto Him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and they also can go to a book of Galatians chapter 3 and won't we one six even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness no idea for that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham may the Lord bless turning of his 1 and we can be seated I just call this confident people amen I believe that we are a confident people you believe that amen amen and amen praise God so we thank God that we are the seed of Abraham by faith amen the Bible says we are the seed of Abraham by faith and when God was talking to Abraham that in blessing I'll bless you you are not talking about the natural seed he was talking about the spiritual seed which is you and me praise God so Abraham lived and acted the way he did is because he was under a covenant praise God and everyone that God is called amen he lives under a covenant he walks under a covenant amen praise His Holy Name Amen and what God did to Abraham he will always do to his seed after him praise God so they were God talked to Abraham they were God called Abraham the where God spoke to Abraham whatever God did to Abraham he must do to his seed after him praise been in him O Lord everything that God did to Abraham he Lee do to you amen the way he called Abraham the way he talked to Abraham the way he tried Abraham the way blessed Abraham he will do the same to you I believe that amen praise God that the promises here let me guess which one quote I hope we are not on much hurry amen praise God he says in the message Abraham and his seed after him that was preached in 61 in April he says now paragraph 8 5 so now it's by grace that God called you not what you did what you could do or what you will do if you are the seed of Abraham God spoke to you by His amazing grace just like he did Abraham in the eternal chapter of Genesis amen because Abraham was just like any one of us but the Bible says God just for problem among his relatives his in the Brethren in the parents and everything like that among the people maybe we're worthless of idols amen but from nowhere God called Abraham and I believe that's what God did to us that's what good it to me hallelujah and he says now amen now and then notice as soon as Abram believed God by justification believing on the Lord we are justified immediately God called Abram then total separation from all unbelief in other way he didn't you his ask equation when God called you did you separate from unbelief because that's what God do to Abraham even after calling us he wants us total separation come out of the wall come out of unbelief come out of there things of this world amen separate you from your your kin dreadz from your kia from your associates come out of the pool rooms come out of the dazzles come away from the things of the wall God calls for a total separation to Abram seed because that's what he called Abraham praise God and that's what he does to us after God calling you he wants you to completely separate you remember Abraham even tried to walk with ezel I think his nephew amen but he had to separate he tried to walk with his father I think he died somewhere because God had called Abraham alone praise God and I believe today when God calls a man or he calls a woman amen God wants total separation and God will always want to speak to you only to you praise God he wants to deal with you alone not with anybody but to you alone as an individual amen you know Lord also tried to go with Abraham but Lord was not cold in the right even Sarah or got a call and also you find all over the journey sorrow ruled out the promises of God but God was dealing with Abraham Amen praise God amen now when you look at the life of Abraham when God called Abraham God spoke to him seven times amen praise God putting seven virtues in Abraham maybe can we just go back to the Bible so if God called you when he has to speak to you on so seven times Amen praise God let us go to book of Genesis chapter 12 Genesis chapter 12 and you want to start from verse 1 verse 12 I'm in chapter 12 verse 1 he says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I'll bring thee I'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I'll bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and Lord went with him and Abram was 75 years old when he depend out of out of Haran praise God God speaks Abraham come out of your people come out of your kindred praises on him and that was faith in all right he just believed it and walked out faith in a right someone is talking to him but God speaking to him and he comes out because God has spoken to him and you have to come out because God has spoken to you amen all right so that was the faith coming out of the world in a right all right let us jump to verse 7 and the Lord appeared unto Abram answered a truth and to thy seed will I give this land and the variability and altar of the Lord who appeared unto him all together Abraham God appears to him Abraham God speaks to him I was telling the church at home that brother you mean since you believed the message God has never spoken to you and then you tell me where is it oh Fabra amen God must speak to you hallelujah because in spoke to Abram here he appeared to Abram and is giving him a promise amen I only give you this land and you are seen after you praise God because when God calls you he must give you a promise praise God what does God promise you why are you believing this message there must be a promise you can't can say I believe what are you believing praise God because if you have a promise then you will hold all to that I promise praise be them alone so God gives a promise Abraham says I'm going to give you this land I'm going to give you busy heritage hallelujah and that's what I know that God called me and has given me I mean he repairs and I'm writing I'm struggling I'm not going to look back until I get a heritage plays belong on and you know if God are not given your promise then you're not going to fight for it amen you're not going to be bad at about it but because you have a promise you will struggle for it you will fight until you get there promise hallelujah oh praise His Holy Name that we have a promise of eternal life we have a promise of going to heaven hallelujah so that's one if anything try to obstruct us trying to stop us we are fighting because we have been living the promise hallelujah there's already Peter and the rest of the apostles were given a promise amen go and wait until you receive their promise amen they waited anyway because there was a promise for them and till they received a promise they could leave the Upper Room Amen so if you have been given a promise brother you're gonna stand you're gonna fight you are going to struggle you are gonna live until you receive the promise amen so that was virtue I were together brothers okay let us go to Genesis chapter 13 and verse 14 God appearing to Abraham God is speaking to Abraham and that's what he is dreaming to EZ seed also chapter 14 and we are reading from verse I mean flat him from verse 14 13 from 1:14 praise God and the Lord said ultra Brahm amen you see and the Lord spoke to Abraham and the Lord appeared a problem and the Lord said unto Abraham I love that hallelujah and the true seed of Abraham should always come and say and God spoke to me amen oh the other day God spoke to me that was the testimony of the seed of Abraham amen and the Lord said our problem after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and how foreign eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed after thee and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number that's all the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee then Avraham removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar of the Lord hallelujah amen you know when God was do something to you amen he wants you to have knowledge praise God because God did not tell Abram now separate from Lord then I'll do decided to do he waits for you to have knowledge of what to do amen and when Abram had that knowledge of separating from Allah to say Lord if you go that side me I'll go decide and you know Lord deciding without my revelation of the one of God he didn't know that why was going there was going to be fire to destroy that place amen amen you better have the grace of the Lord to choose whatever was right on what's wrong and God will give you the knowledge to choose praise God hallelujah separating from unbelievers separating from the people that can bring you a problem in the walk with God amen Abram said now Lord I think it is time for us to separate and brother I know many times God waits for you to make a decision and when you make a right decision that's when God comes down and say because you have done these because you have decided because you have chosen to separate now in blessing I'll bless you look now look now look is look where's all these promises I shall give to you and maybe there are some things that you are not able to receive because God is waiting for you to separate from some things yes because after Abram separated then God says okay now thank you for doing that amen now you

just encouraging 11 amen let us go to Genesis chapter 15 no Jonas chapter 14 sorry Genesis 14 God is visiting Abraham God is speaking to Abraham and problem says what God is need to Abraham he will redo to EZ seed also so if God spoke to Abram this way then he also speak to you also whistling away hey man chapter 14 from verse 18 almalexia king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God Ponce's of the heaven and earth and blessed be the Most High God which has delivered thine enemies in thine hand and he gave him titles of all praise God in that God demanding at item you praises of name yes amen I know sometimes it's hard to speak these things but God going to meet Abraham and then Abram gives him a tight praise His Holy Name Amen after you believed your faith you have their promise you have the knowledge to separate from any belief from sin amen that's not enough God still wants you to pay your time hmm I know there are people have believed and they don't know even how to play time but temperance not to say God I am humble enough that everything that you have given me is yours they work that I'm doing the job that I'm doing I could do it without you amen and that is temperance humility before God a true believer after the believed he has been called out he has been given a promise amen you are separated from from Lord from trouble from unbelievers hallelujah then he humbles himself in the judge amen he must know how to pay tight brother if you repent eyes the world is talking to you tonight amen he wants you to know how to pay tight praise his own name because God had to go and meet Abraham is that Abram went and met him at is God after knowing a Brahmas got something he goes and meets him praise God temperance my god it just was go quick now let us go to Genesis chapter 15 verse 1 amen after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying we are not Abraham I am thy shield and my exceeding great reward and Adam said Lord God what will now give me seeing I go childless and this and st1 of my house in this Eliezer of Damascus and Adam said Behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one my house is my hair and behold the one of the Lord came unto him saying he shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own balls shall be their praise beat him alone amen God is talking to Abram after God had promised Abram and son praises or name and now Abram is impatient amen and goodness see God you promised me a child now this Eliezer is the one going to be my hair I'm here to give me a promise and God say no problem it's not going to be this one not ELISA just be patient I'm going to give you a son what was God doing he was putting patience in Abraham praise been over all precious in Abram are you patient brother when you ask anything from God sometimes he needs you to be patient with a Brahma gave a promise and after 25 years no child and God was testing Abraham's patience and also we need to be patient whatever we ask God we have to be patient amen I want us to go very fast chapter 17 verse 1 and from verse 1 chapter 17 and when Abram was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said a dream I am The Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect godliness are you seeing the virtuous coming down I wish we had our pyramid but I believe in you understand I'm talking about those are the seven virtues that a believer is supposed to have and that's the seven virtues that God was putting in Abraham amen he said be no perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and I will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and go talk with EEMA saying as for me behold my covenant to thee and thou shalt be father of many nations never telling him any more be called Abram but thy name shall be called Abraham for a father of many nations how my men he prays banana or God is putting quality nests in abram be thou perfect as I am perfect be thou perfect as God is perfect does good equal perfect nationals does the Bible says be thou perfect of God is perfect amen so God is speaking to Abraham amen appearing speaking saying talking to Abraham putting their virtues in Abraham amen chapter 18 verse 17 to 33 18 17 2003 praise God over there 18 17 says I think shall not start from 70 let us are former last 23 and a Brahma drew near and said we now also destroy the righteous with the wicked parade event idea be 15 items within a city with also destroy understand a place for the fifty righteous that are therein what was Abram doing praise God he was interceding for Lord Brahma Li kindness hallelujah brotherly kindness this law and separated from him but Abraham is pleading for his lost brother in the pleading for his Paxton brother Oh hallelujah amen so Abraham is having brotherly kindness they love for the Brethren hey men I were together brothers I were together sisters so if God has called you he will put all these to you he'll meet you he will speak to you in seven voices Amen like a spoken to church in seven voices hey man bobbum says God is poking a chart in seven voices amen from the frantic egg in feathers through loud akia amen and you know seven voices sometimes we say seventh tunnel because Honda is a voice of God speaking in a right and God has spoken to us in seven voices so that the nature of God can come back to us men now God despot stopped speaking to Abram because the virtues are already in him we go now to chapter 22 amen chapter 22 from verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did attempt Abraham he's not saying to Abram is not talking to Abram but he is tempting Abram is trying Abraham and said unto him Abram and he said Behold Here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest praise God thy only son whom thou lovest I wish I wish you a pyramid here sorry but you understand what I'm saying amen after the seven virtues then God wanted Abram to take Isaac on top of the pyramid and roblem says Isaac was a type of love which is charity to seal the seven virtues in Abram amen take now thy only son whom you love charity Isaac take him the mountain and Gilman precise hallelujah amen to seal the pyramid thank you for feeding of Germany yes does it amen take now thy son Isaac who is the Lamb who is the charity on top of the mountain amen let us read it again praise God and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt a Brahmin said a dream Abram and he said behold I am and he said Technovation not only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get in the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I'll tell me oh praise God our mountain pyramid amen can you put it back again brother amen so then where God dealt with Abraham is there where God is going to deal with his seed after him amen you have to have their faith their virtue their knowledge their temporal their pressures their goal eNOS brother economies are very charity they love within the Holy Ghost himself to seal your life amen praise God so when your life is feel that way then you are as perfect as God is perfect seal with the Holy Ghost that's the life that God is calling us to and other provinces work according to Abraham we do to each one of us and I want to tell a charge now these virtues you don't just want say Oh God give me faith or God give me virtue or girl give me coordinates you are going to be tried to receive of things amen you have to be tried every virtue you have to be tried in order to receive them praise God who together brothers amen I love that rebus amen so God is working on you God is working on me the way he was working with Abram the Ray was talking with Abraham praise be the Lord amen amen let me just read one quote and then we shall just continue mmm amen praise God the promise was made to Abraham and not only to Abraham but to his seed after him not in seeds but because he had many sons but only to one seed which came through Isaac through Isaac came Christ now we being dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed and our health according the promise and I believe sensibly that I can provide the Bible that the seed of Abram are those who have been born again of the spirit of just Christ amen so you cannot claim to be the seed of Abram until you are born again by the Spirit of just rice amen that's right you have Abraham's seed when you have the Holy Ghost that's right it was through that promise and now that problem that promise was that he made or give to you by your own goodness it was God's election and according that brought you to it nothing we ever done to merit it you never sought after God it's God who thought after you and give it to you on the basis of sovereign grace nothing in the world that you could do nothing nothing that you could do praise God God called Abraham not because of what he did and not because of what was going to do but by God's sovereign grace and that's the way God has called us amen not because of what we have done or because of what we are going to do no is God working in us and for us who achieved his virtues it is not our effort these are our strengths but God is the one putting those virtues in us because it was has to be the seed of Abram and what did it Rob Rob he do to us also amen praise God amen so that God that made their covenant with Abram I believe was the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord he married a covenant and in the church age book the province Asia don't fear Little John don't fear little flock all that I am you are here too all my power is yours my open importance is yours as I stand in your ministry I've not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given to me it's us Ruth you speak the word and I will perform it that's my covenant and if he can never fail amen so the very God who made a covenant with Abraham is making a covenant with with a bride in the Magna commoner with me are you hallelujah he told Graham and Michelle oh praise God I am everything for you do believe that brothers and that covenant is a part of you amen he has made a covenant with me he has made a covenant with you speak the word because all that God is it's yours as long as you come to realize who you are praise God amen praise His Holy Name Amen so Abraham had a promise of a son and we have a promise of eternal life in our right and Abraham amen he wanted to be sure of his promise and I must be sure of my promise amen if God gave me a promise I have to be sure of that promise then when the Bible says oh we must also make our calling and election sure amen that's why Abraham he wanted to be sure of in the promise and I must be sure of my promise I must make my calling and election sure hey man glory hallelujah oh let us live in the book of second Peter now oh praise God second Peter we must make our calling and election sure we are not gambling we must make sure God has called me into this eternal life praise God amen 2nd Peter chapter 1 and from verse 1 my god let us start from verse 2 grace and peace be multiplied until through their knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according us divine as his divine power as given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises great and precious promises amen that by this is what these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption does in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge after knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and little kindness charity so they were abused in the pyramid glory hallelujah is their very various of possible pyramids to be sure ah of our calling and election amen uh-huh for if these things be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Allah Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and I'm forgotten that he was purged from the old dreams where a folder other brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall praise God praise God let me read one quote here breathing altogether amen I must make sure their virtues are there what got into Abraham he has to do to me also amen amen praise God praise God amen not easy to give us watches brother but by God's grace God will he speak them to us amen that's why the fivefold ministry is there to speak those batches to you praise God when a fungus comes he preaches his message and those watches must come hey man the Prophet says here but if you got jinhwan faith a man then putting on virtue to eat then give any knowledge the engine and temperance their general presence see you are moving right on up the line fifth me add gold mess oh my goal has to be added what does godless mean I looked at four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what he meant finally I was down at where Jeffrey's there we found it in a dictionary godless means to be like God oh my algebra gotta faith virtue knowledge temperance then be like God you want to be like God amen praise God praise God and somewhere he says when one of them is not there the whole thing crumbles now amen all together when one of the rock is not there the other thing crumbles down amen groan is calling you you have their faith amen you have the virtue you have the knowledge you have their pet their temperance but if you don't have patience the whole thing crumbles now all you don't have golden is the hollow thing crumbles now amen we have to have everything of it amen now that's why Abraham amen he had God told him okay now bring the the Dow's bring the those kind of sacrifices present only to prove that God keeps his promise God keeps his one he said bring they'd of three us bring the God three us bring I think the lamprey us divided is under dividing this that was the sacrifice that is the one amen Oh hallelujah amen and the Bible says Abraham after bring all those things together he was waiting upon the Lord for God to come and consume their sacrifice what'd he do he waved off their bats from his sacrifice and what would a bad mean but mean spirits demons Devils either right remember the Prophet I mean Jesus or talking about the sower and then the bus of the air come and pick the seeds so meaning that Devils can come and pick it so a BrahMos was guarding his sacrifice so that their birds the are killing bats hallelujah should not come and defile the sacrifice amen so he had to get a stick maybe and what the demons of unbelief praise God and with a thick you to hit the demon of unbelief not to come upon his sacrifice amen and maybe then the spirit of uncleanness who come upon a sacrifice Allah would hold a stick and hit the demon of uncleanness amen praise His only hour together oh so he was getting his sacrifice and me and you we must guard our sacrifice don't allow the demon of unbelief the women of uncleanness amen the demon of intemperance altogether coterminous you have to heat all those demons away praise God keep your sacrifice clean so that God will bring the fire to consume you our sacrifice hallelujah so that when you ask anything God will give it to you we have to keep our sacrifice clean what the sacrifice that's the one that is Christ Christ is our sacrifice in the beginning there was the word the Word was regard and the Word was God amen and John putting them down the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world because it was their sacrifice in the Old Testament and now this one is our sacrifice praise God anything that worries in you amen you have to keep away the demons you have to keep our in spirits you have to keep all the Aliquippa things not to keep our unbelief you have to keep our every demon that will come amen to define their sacrifice praise be not a monologue amen amen Rev of the demons of unbelief demons of uncleanness demons of ungodliness from the sacrifice from the word that you believed amen so that when you raise up yon O God who will answer your prayers you are sure of your calling and your election in the Wright brothers are you the seed of Abraham is God working on you to put all the virtues in you like in it Abraham he is speaking to you brother if you speak it your sister don't where the path of speak to you let God speak to you amen God must speak to me through his his one amen whenever God comes here amen he wants to speak to somebody and I believe God must have spoken to you tonight putting some virtues in you amen amen maybe putting go leaners maybe putting a patient maybe temperance maybe knowledge I don't know but I know he has done it if you are a seed of Abraham God muscle spoken to praise God praise the Lord may God bless you we have to keep our sacrifice clean amen if you are as possibility not God a man is you your responsibility to keep away the unclean birds from your sacrifice can be boy heads hallelujah maybe somebody says well somewhere pray for me I've not been keeping off the bats from my sacrifice a man I've been keeping our air baths but their sacrifice is there but I've been allowing unclean birds to come on a sacrifice maybe only clean buds of unbelief God gives a promise but you don't believe it those are unclean birds but every promise of God is true when you believe it you receive it praise God let us breathe let us pray oh my Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for your word of encouragement Lord as the seed of Abraham we won't be like Abraham the way you spoke to Abraham seven times you appear to him in visions you spoke to him until in chapter 18 you visited him in the person and then Lord in chapter 22 you tried him his love which was the type of Isaac going up the pyramid and Laurie said now in blessing I'll bless you and from that time you never spoke to Abram again and Lord our prophecies total obedience to the Holy Word of God and perilously token to be sealed by the Holy Spirit Lord God maybe actually speaking to us putting some virtues in as likely to Abraham my lord we need the sealing of the Holy Ghost we need love to be on top of the mountain of our pyramids Lord your what is not come out for it it must accomplish his purpose father you know our hearts you know our lives you know father somewhere somehow somebody hasn't been keeping away the evil spirits from their sacrifice Lord when you give them they speak to ever where all the other clean parts of unbelief and cleanness speeds of doubt peace of confusion Lord may we wave them off from our sacrifice the Lord will lift up our hands to You Lord God in answer we have many these father and he said just pick the one and see our duty to perform it Lord you won't commit every prayer every since thank you even those who are in the hospital sick like that sister that IES you seek father Lord you are the seed of Abraham and we have the faith of our father Abraham I want to claim for every redemptive right of the brethren here of the seed of Abraham in the name of Jesus in you blood out of them they deserve their heart take away the spirit of unbelief or or server it is wrong cover him with the blood of Jesus father law will come before your presence because your promise to us but also very asking your name will grant it law and may you put every virtue in us like you need are to Abraham our Father the Lord may be a coroner people with you grant King of glory bless the past presidents bless every soul that comes under the roof of this church your presence lead them guidance can all of us come with a stage of a perfect man if Jesus Christ no glory pray amen god bless you [Music] praise the Lord we thank the law for their the word tonight gave me you appreciate the word tonight did we appreciate the word tonight a me praise award I think I have to look for my message let the church say Amy it's a messy data we're going to pre sometime ago I have to go back and look at that message praise the Lord but we thank the law to night for the word it's kind of a beautiful to see how placing the seventh virtue of Peter right into speaking to Abraham prays alone but there was something I want for us to watch Branham talks about dealing with Abraham Abraham he plays Genesis chapter 80 when the three men came to Abraham he placed there as the last visit which is the seventh visit praise Lord Amen so I believe by the Holy Spirit what brother Sammy was bringing it bringing to us tonight the way that God did with Abraham trying to show God dealing with us through the word because the virtue comes through the word amen the virtue it is now something that we can we can practice the same with God tested Abraham and God proof Abraham and God spoke to Abraham that's the same where else we are listing it to the word and we are learning from the word that's how we grow in a statue of a perfect man praise the Lord and it's just a friend I sent a coat up there from statute of the peasant man that's what better Brennan feels the world crumble you know Samuel spoke on that but see what brother Branham said you know where Branham said they statue will crumble when you try to put your thing in it amen that's when the statue crumble he says I see after you have done all year and come here now you are coming into a force touch you now of a son of God but you have got to have this plus all this and you can even start until you get this now you you remember the black bird with T crow feather and what is that it's when a black bird starts with a peacock feather and start to add it and the bird don't add its feather the feather comes from the food its eat amen so he said P crow feather don't forget that see don't try to add it until you are actually born again because that's where it starts from praise the Lord you can make it work it will come to this it will come here it will crumble praise the Lord and we crumble when when we start having make-believe we start putting our own attitude to what God is - and remember now we started speaking on the word you can net you cannot miss interpret what God is doing you cannot misplace what God is doing we have to believe God's Word that God said it I believe it and that's a - it Amen God said it and we receive God's Word when we starts to act then you put your pull what God want to do your sport God creation are we together but I think it was beautiful tonight to be able to see God the way God dealt with Abraham and Abraham was able to grow in in a statue of a perfect man praise the Lord I was sitting there I was listening and and you know I was taking the Scriptures down all the time - I was speaking to Abraham but when he got to brotherly kindness I said it's jumping over Genesis chapter 18 but then I sat and I said okay I see where he's going now he's talking about the virtue he's not talking about the seven appearance praise the Lord are we together amen so we thank the Lord for the word tonight Amy praise the Lord [Music] we are the generation I think there's a song that being played by the musicians Amy let's
