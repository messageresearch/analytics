[50:36] old living
[50:38] that he may be a new lamp as we are
[50:42] unleavened
[50:44] for even christ our passover is
[50:46] sacrificed for us
[50:48] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[50:50] old living
[50:52] neither with a living or malice and
[50:55] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[50:57] of
[50:57] sincerity and truth
[51:03] let's also read from the book of
[51:06] deuteronomy chapter 24

[52:35] god bless you as you get seated
[52:48] i'm looking for the clock
[52:53] oh that's the clock okay
[52:57] all right yeah
[53:04] i just want to keep time i don't want to
[53:06] keep you this is a weekday
[53:09] and
[53:13] i think we shouldn't talk so much
[53:18] uh tonight i just want to fellowship
[53:20] around this idea
[53:22] in the bible and i'm going to call it
[53:25] lump
[53:26] without living
[53:30] love without living
[53:37] paul said your
[53:41] is not good do you know that a little
[53:43] even live underneath the whole lamp
[53:47] i really live in liveness the whole
[53:54] lamp
[53:56] and then he advises punch out therefore
[53:59] the old living
[54:01] that he may be a new lamp we are
[54:04] supposed to be a new lamp
[54:07] azir unlimited we are supposed to be
[54:11] unleavened for even christ our passover
[54:15] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[54:16] keep the feast not with old
[54:18] living neither with the living or malice
[54:22] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[54:25] bread
[54:25] of sincerity and truth
[54:33] now i want to start with one point
[54:38] and whoever is
[54:42] putting this one on the on the wall
[54:44] there can do it
[54:47] i want us to read a quote
[54:51] is that somebody projecting
[54:54] okay all right
[55:03] okay can we have it
[55:09] you're gonna have to go ahead
[55:13] sorry about that okay
[55:21] or i don't need it for my
[55:55] all right rabban says well you say
[55:58] now brother branham i guess once in a
[56:01] once in grace
[56:02] always in grace
[56:06] that brings a lot of disgrace
[56:10] but when a man or a woman has been born
[56:13] of the spirit of god
[56:15] all things have passed away all things
[56:19] have become new
[56:21] and it's been bathed and blessed by
[56:25] the eternal god and they can no more
[56:28] perish than god himself can perish
[56:33] all right the only told me that a god
[56:38] that infinite god would come down and
[56:40] give you
[56:41] eternal life knowing that he was going
[56:45] to lose you
[56:48] serve you here knowing he's going to
[56:51] lose you
[56:52] there what did he save you for
[56:56] why he is working against himself
[57:00] if he saved you once you are saved
[57:03] for all eternity
[57:07] there is no demons in hell could upset
[57:10] you
[57:15] blessed be lord the prophet taught
[57:18] the eternal security of the believer
[57:23] and he said this kind of a believer we
[57:25] are talking about
[57:27] is not just somebody that imagines that
[57:29] he saved
[57:31] not somebody that gets some emotions
[57:32] around himself
[57:34] and feels that he is a he's a safety
[57:36] person
[57:38] they are quite a large number of people
[57:40] in this world that
[57:41] think they are saved but they are not
[57:42] saved at all in other words god has
[57:45] never had his heart
[57:46] upon them god has never begun any work
[57:50] in them at all but here the prophet
[57:53] tells us that if god ever
[57:56] saved a person right
[57:59] because the bible says that when we
[58:00] believe on his word
[58:02] when we believe on him here we
[58:05] have passed from death and to life
[58:12] and once that has happened it can never
[58:14] be really fast
[58:17] right yes it is just like a butterfly
[58:21] in the process of growth of the
[58:24] butterfly from
[58:26] a larvae to
[58:29] a pupa and then from there to a
[58:32] butterfly
[58:34] there is no way it can change again from
[58:36] butterfly
[58:37] and back to people or back to lava
[58:41] not there is no circumstances that that
[58:44] that process can
[58:46] can go backwards it doesn't matter what
[58:49] the
[58:49] butterfly eat it they made something
[58:52] different from
[58:54] the nature of a butterfly but it will
[58:56] never change
[59:00] it is in the same way that if god has
[59:03] saved us
[59:05] and he has taken us in that process of
[59:08] changing us from
[59:11] being lost changing us from
[59:14] being dead to being life
[59:17] there is no way and there is nothing
[59:19] that can happen that we can get lost
[59:23] [Music]
[59:25] praise the name of the lord
[59:28] let me just need another quote here just
[59:30] to
[59:32] continue confirming that idea
[59:35] because i want to begin with that
[59:41] you bear with me i'll be slow slower i
[59:45] thought i would
[59:46] have this one projected
[59:50] [Music]
[59:54] i hope i'm not wrong this one
[1:00:13] all right that's that's much let's leave
[1:00:15] that one out
[1:00:16] so uh therefore the thing is that
[1:00:20] it does not matter what you can do if
[1:00:22] god has done that if god has served you
[1:00:24] no matter what you can do
[1:00:29] even if you committed sin
[1:00:32] even if you backslade
[1:00:37] you cannot get lost
[1:00:43] i some sometimes people will talk like
[1:00:45] that and people think we're opening the
[1:00:47] door
[1:00:49] if you hear that no matter what you can
[1:00:52] do
[1:00:54] brabam said do what you want to do
[1:00:59] do what you like you won't get lost
[1:01:03] right right rambam said okay
[1:01:07] i do i do whatever i want
[1:01:13] sometimes people ask us and ask us
[1:01:16] does your church allow people to drink
[1:01:20] does your church allow people to marry
[1:01:22] many wives
[1:01:24] does your church allow this when
[1:01:27] somebody asks me like that i tell no
[1:01:29] our church allows people to do whatever
[1:01:32] they want to do
[1:01:36] sometimes they feel like that's a very
[1:01:38] good church they can join the church
[1:01:42] if you don't do what you want to do then
[1:01:45] you hypocrite
[1:01:50] if there is so much you want to do but
[1:01:53] because
[1:01:54] you accepted christ you are not able to
[1:01:56] do
[1:01:57] then you are not saved
[1:02:02] so i give this let's example for example
[1:02:06] i don't know how
[1:02:07] you know in our life there we have a lot
[1:02:09] of sheep and goats
[1:02:13] let's say i have got my own goat and i
[1:02:16] talked to my goat i told my god come
[1:02:18] here i'm not
[1:02:20] going to tire you i'm not going to bide
[1:02:22] you
[1:02:23] i'm not going to put her normally we put
[1:02:25] a rope
[1:02:26] on the on the goat so it doesn't go
[1:02:28] roaming around and
[1:02:30] jumping into the gardens and eating
[1:02:32] beans and cabbages
[1:02:35] so now my goat i'm going to set you free
[1:02:38] you can eat whatever you want you can go
[1:02:40] wherever you want to go
[1:02:42] you are free if you want to go in the
[1:02:45] garden go
[1:02:45] if you want to go in a farm you'll go
[1:02:48] you want to eat
[1:02:49] anything you want to eat cabbages
[1:02:52] whatever you want to eat you can eat
[1:02:56] so my goat is free
[1:03:00] but there's one thing i know as long as
[1:03:04] it is a good and i am not deceived
[1:03:07] that i'm having something else other
[1:03:09] than not good
[1:03:11] i know i'll never find
[1:03:14] that goat of mine scrambling with the
[1:03:17] dogs
[1:03:18] over bones
[1:03:22] however
[1:03:25] i'll never find it outside a butchery
[1:03:28] looking for somebody to get
[1:03:30] it's a piece of meat
[1:03:33] why wouldn't my goat do that so there is
[1:03:37] no law
[1:03:38] so it is although it is free
[1:03:42] but they cannot eat meat neither can it
[1:03:45] crack bones
[1:03:46] why because it will have to go by the
[1:03:49] decades of its nature
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:54] the nature will never allow a christian
[1:03:58] is not a religion but their nature
[1:04:02] it is something that god comes and puts
[1:04:04] in you
[1:04:05] is a church and it becomes a new
[1:04:08] creature
[1:04:10] that is created after god with the
[1:04:12] nature of god
[1:04:14] you have the seed of god
[1:04:17] and therefore you will never desire to
[1:04:20] do
[1:04:20] also you are free although you know that
[1:04:22] whatever you do you
[1:04:24] still go to heaven you're never there
[1:04:26] blah blah blah said even the very
[1:04:28] thought
[1:04:28] of sin will condemn you
[1:04:32] their very thought
[1:04:35] to condemn you you will not do that
[1:04:39] right may the name of the arabic reform
[1:04:43] so what i'm going to speak about now
[1:04:45] here
[1:04:46] and the things that i'm going to say
[1:04:48] here that
[1:04:50] we need to do we need to to live is not
[1:04:52] to get saved
[1:04:54] no we know we are only deserved
[1:04:58] if i tell you thou shalt not steal thou
[1:05:00] shalt not do this i'm not
[1:05:01] we are not saying that to be saved
[1:05:04] we are already served
[1:05:08] right and we know we are we are we can
[1:05:10] never get lost
[1:05:12] now rabbi gave some example he gave an
[1:05:14] example of soul
[1:05:16] soul was totally vaccinated he was so
[1:05:19] backfiden god had nothing to do with him
[1:05:22] could never speak to him through their
[1:05:23] own through him neither through the
[1:05:25] prophet
[1:05:25] neither through the dreams god had cut
[1:05:27] off the relationship
[1:05:28] right but although he was in that
[1:05:31] condition because he had gone contrary
[1:05:33] to the word of god
[1:05:36] soul never got lost but
[1:05:39] says as the bible says when we call
[1:05:42] up someone someone told him tomorrow
[1:05:46] you'll be with me where
[1:05:49] i have been and where i will be
[1:05:52] and someone was in paradise yes so the
[1:05:55] following day even when saul died
[1:05:57] together with his son
[1:05:59] they never went to hell they went
[1:06:02] where someone was
[1:06:06] he never got lost
[1:06:10] now when abraham
[1:06:14] committed sin and lied
[1:06:18] even immediately after he lied
[1:06:22] god spoke to america and told him return
[1:06:25] that wife to that man that man
[1:06:28] is my prophet he never ceased to be a
[1:06:31] prophet
[1:06:32] just because he had committed sin he was
[1:06:35] hearing very good books with god
[1:06:41] are we together tonight all right now
[1:06:45] let me just leave that point there i
[1:06:48] wanted to hammer that point in that way
[1:06:51] to show that surely when god has saved
[1:06:55] us
[1:06:55] when god when we are passed from death
[1:06:57] and to life
[1:06:58] there's no nowhere we can change now
[1:07:00] from life to death
[1:07:01] right that's right when god has saved us
[1:07:04] he has saved us and god cannot save you
[1:07:06] knowing that tomorrow you backslide
[1:07:08] if you have seen god put his head upon
[1:07:10] your life and change you and transform
[1:07:11] you
[1:07:12] he has already seen he will make it
[1:07:15] because what we call predestination
[1:07:18] predestination is nothing else
[1:07:21] predestination is not god sitting down
[1:07:24] with his pen
[1:07:25] and the paper and saying okay let me see
[1:07:28] whom i will save
[1:07:30] i'll serve this man he doesn't seem to
[1:07:32] be very bad let me save
[1:07:34] that man he looks aloud and says this
[1:07:36] guy is no good at all that
[1:07:37] let this one go to hell that's not what
[1:07:40] presentation is all about
[1:07:44] when we talk about choosing god choosing
[1:07:46] it's not going goal
[1:07:47] good going round and then picking up
[1:07:49] this one will go to heaven
[1:07:51] this one will be my person this will not
[1:07:53] go to hell
[1:07:54] that's not what we just naturally mean
[1:07:56] predestination
[1:07:58] means god's for knowledge
[1:08:03] when god sat himself there and looked
[1:08:06] ahead
[1:08:09] he saw who would believe
[1:08:12] if the gospel was preached to him
[1:08:17] right he's so if so and so will hear the
[1:08:21] gospel he will believe
[1:08:23] therefore god said i don't have to wait
[1:08:25] until he believes
[1:08:26] i have already seen him believe so i put
[1:08:29] his name in the book of life
[1:08:33] amen i know such a such a thing will
[1:08:36] happen
[1:08:37] so i know so and so will be a preacher
[1:08:41] so i put him down he will be a preacher
[1:08:45] that's what is predestination
[1:08:46] predecession is by the four knowledge
[1:08:51] and when god has done that and when god
[1:08:54] has saved us he has saved us according
[1:08:57] to predestination which is according to
[1:08:59] his foreign knowledge
[1:09:02] he knew you'll be there
[1:09:05] praise be to god and god whatever god
[1:09:08] saw
[1:09:08] is correct he can never be wrong he's a
[1:09:11] right
[1:09:12] he saw that i would believe he saw that
[1:09:14] i would accept
[1:09:15] the word of god he saw our belief for
[1:09:18] him
[1:09:19] and that's why he did something in my
[1:09:21] life and changed me
[1:09:24] may the name of the arabic glorified
[1:09:26] there was another boy
[1:09:28] ramon was talking about who was called
[1:09:30] lambsi
[1:09:31] this boy started drinking was a preacher
[1:09:32] but then started drinking
[1:09:34] and he said has got nothing to do with
[1:09:36] the gospel again
[1:09:38] he has quit preaching and everything
[1:09:39] else and the boy continued like that he
[1:09:42] started
[1:09:43] continuing that habit and finally he got
[1:09:46] sick
[1:09:46] and later he died but the bomb said that
[1:09:48] boy did not go to hell
[1:09:51] that boy was saved what god did is that
[1:09:54] he removed him from this earth
[1:09:56] because he was putting this grace to his
[1:09:58] name but he never got lost praise the
[1:10:02] name of the lord tonight
[1:10:04] now for that matter
[1:10:08] now listen what the word of god says
[1:10:11] first of all let me emphasize
[1:10:15] we as believers called by god
[1:10:18] we are a lamp
[1:10:21] a lamp is a death dove i don't know
[1:10:24] whether it was a dove or death
[1:10:28] sometimes you get problems when we come
[1:10:29] around here one time i wanted to have
[1:10:32] some
[1:10:33] some hot water so i was ordering
[1:10:37] i said give me hot water
[1:10:40] someone said what what are you talking
[1:10:43] about
[1:10:44] it had hot water
[1:10:48] and there was strong about five minutes
[1:10:49] i don't know what you are talking about
[1:10:52] i think somebody had that conversation
[1:10:54] we have a
[1:10:55] we had a problem he said no he means
[1:10:58] hot hot water
[1:11:06] so i hope you are getting me here
[1:11:14] so we see um
[1:11:18] now we have to realize
[1:11:22] the bible says we as believers
[1:11:26] and as the children of god we are a lamp
[1:11:32] we are adaf you know when you mix water
[1:11:35] with with a
[1:11:36] with a with a wheat flour and you
[1:11:39] powered it
[1:11:40] you make duff isn't it now that
[1:11:43] that thing is what the bible is calling
[1:11:45] the lamp
[1:11:47] and we are that kind of a lamp so we are
[1:11:50] related we are interrelated
[1:11:54] and king now wants that one big lamp
[1:11:59] the bible says that a little living
[1:12:02] leaving us the whole lamp
[1:12:08] that whole lamb will be affected
[1:12:12] by a little living and what is that
[1:12:15] living
[1:12:17] now everybody says but brother uh sorry
[1:12:21] your glowing is not good no you're not
[1:12:23] that are literally even leaving this the
[1:12:25] whole lamp
[1:12:27] page out there for the old living that
[1:12:29] you may be a new lamp
[1:12:31] as early unleavened for even christ our
[1:12:34] passover
[1:12:34] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[1:12:37] keep the feast not with old living
[1:12:41] neither with the living or malice
[1:12:44] you can have an idea what living is
[1:12:47] malice
[1:12:48] and wickedness
[1:12:53] but with the unlivened bread
[1:12:56] of sincerity
[1:12:59] and truth and tonight a little while
[1:13:03] i'm just saying let us have this lamp
[1:13:06] without living
[1:13:08] let the lamb be without living
[1:13:13] as much as we are saved as much as we
[1:13:15] cannot go to hell as much as we are
[1:13:19] we know that we cannot get lost but
[1:13:22] seeing the living has the consequences
[1:13:27] it has consequences
[1:13:31] now a scene has something that
[1:13:35] does to the islam
[1:13:39] it makes it defiled it makes it living
[1:13:44] and this is a something we must observe
[1:13:48] that this islam stays without
[1:13:51] living
[1:13:55] may the name or not be glorified now
[1:14:02] we are alarm composed of individuals
[1:14:04] that are truly saved believers
[1:14:06] that god has saved and when we are
[1:14:08] together
[1:14:09] we are alarmed we are
[1:14:14] that affects
[1:14:17] we every one of us will affect the other
[1:14:20] and therefore if there is something like
[1:14:23] a living that comes into that
[1:14:24] lamp it is going to live in the whole
[1:14:26] body it is affected hopefully
[1:14:28] and therefore this lamb should be kept
[1:14:31] without
[1:14:32] leaving
[1:14:35] blessed be the name alone let's just
[1:14:38] just
[1:14:40] get back there a little bit in the first
[1:14:42] corinthians chapter
[1:14:43] five which starts from verse first one
[1:14:48] it is reported commonly
[1:14:53] it is reported commonly that there is
[1:14:55] fornication among you
[1:15:01] and such fornication as is not so
[1:15:04] much as named among the gentiles
[1:15:09] that one should have his father's wife
[1:15:16] this church had such a such a big
[1:15:19] problem
[1:15:21] this church of believers had entered in
[1:15:24] such a
[1:15:25] terrible condition that there was
[1:15:29] lampang
[1:15:32] that a fornication was lampang
[1:15:37] it became just so common in such a
[1:15:39] manner that
[1:15:40] somebody eloped with his father with his
[1:15:42] father's wife
[1:15:45] it must have been that his father had
[1:15:47] married a young woman
[1:15:49] and this young man a lot with a with a
[1:15:51] wife
[1:15:52] it was a terrible situation his power
[1:15:54] said even this one is not
[1:15:56] reported among the non-believers
[1:16:00] now
[1:16:04] then pauses
[1:16:09] and ye are puffed up
[1:16:13] and have not rather moaned
[1:16:21] right just think about those words
[1:16:24] here is a lot of sin in the church
[1:16:27] terrible things are happening in the
[1:16:28] church but
[1:16:30] the people in the church may be
[1:16:34] the members of the church together with
[1:16:35] the deacons and trustees
[1:16:37] and maybe even the pastor
[1:16:41] they are puffed up about that
[1:16:48] now to be puffed up is to be filled with
[1:16:50] pride
[1:16:54] how people came to be so proud about
[1:16:57] over such a impunity of
[1:17:01] sin
[1:17:04] is actually understandable
[1:17:09] people were puffed up they were filled
[1:17:12] with pride
[1:17:14] they were conceited about this situation
[1:17:17] they were indifferent to this instance
[1:17:20] of gross
[1:17:21] sin recharge
[1:17:27] now in other word when this condition
[1:17:30] was there in that church
[1:17:32] and seeing was lampard in that manner
[1:17:35] the people were actually not bothered
[1:17:41] they were not concerned about it
[1:17:44] everybody don't care it means they were
[1:17:46] passive
[1:17:47] passive about the situation and the
[1:17:50] condition
[1:17:56] now
[1:17:58] they were not ashamed of it
[1:18:01] they were not pained
[1:18:05] by the church getting into this kind of
[1:18:07] a condition
[1:18:10] and therefore we find that these people
[1:18:12] are proud of it
[1:18:13] they were conceited about it
[1:18:16] in other because fornication was so
[1:18:19] common
[1:18:20] until the church became another tight
[1:18:23] and he lost the sense of
[1:18:25] outrage about sin
[1:18:32] then paul said instead of being in this
[1:18:36] condition this is what you should have
[1:18:38] done you should rather
[1:18:41] have moon
[1:18:44] may the name was already glorified moon
[1:18:47] he said you should have moaned of it
[1:18:51] the right reaction to this condition
[1:18:54] should have been
[1:18:55] mourning morning means is to feel
[1:18:59] or to show sorrow or regret and grief
[1:19:05] this is what when sin is committed
[1:19:08] uh this is what see this is what
[1:19:12] uh this is a condition that
[1:19:18] the condition of sin should bring upon
[1:19:20] the people
[1:19:23] they should grieve they should
[1:19:26] moan about it instead of doing that they
[1:19:30] were glorifying
[1:19:31] and adoling the people that were doing
[1:19:34] that they were expecting the people that
[1:19:36] were in those
[1:19:37] scenes they were honoring and boasting
[1:19:40] about it
[1:19:44] may the name of the lord be glorified
[1:19:46] what they should have done
[1:19:51] paul says they should have moaned
[1:19:55] in other words sin
[1:19:59] vex is a believer just like we see in
[1:20:02] the book of ii peter
[1:20:05] chapter
[1:20:09] let's see the book of peter ii peter
[1:20:13] chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:20:33] for that righteous man dwelling among
[1:20:36] them
[1:20:38] in seeing and healing healing works this
[1:20:41] lecture let's
[1:20:41] start from verse
[1:20:44] 6 and turning the cities of sodom and
[1:20:47] gomorrah into arches
[1:20:48] condemned them either an overthrow
[1:20:51] making them
[1:20:52] an example and to those that after after
[1:20:54] should live
[1:20:55] ungodly and deliver just lot
[1:21:00] worked with the fifth conversation of
[1:21:03] the wicked
[1:21:06] the right feeling the right
[1:21:09] opinion the right attitude
[1:21:12] of a christian over sin being committed
[1:21:15] in the church
[1:21:16] should be like what was happening with
[1:21:19] lord
[1:21:22] lord could see sin just allowed things
[1:21:25] just happening aloud
[1:21:26] and his soul was vexed
[1:21:30] he was not a very righteous man because
[1:21:32] the bible caused him backslidden
[1:21:34] but the scene that was happening in the
[1:21:36] sonoma gomorrah
[1:21:37] was so much even a backseater christian
[1:21:40] was vexed
[1:21:43] this is the condition that should be
[1:21:44] there for
[1:21:46] that righteous man dwelling among them
[1:21:48] in seeing and healing
[1:21:50] seeing and healing brahman said that
[1:21:54] this world
[1:21:54] is like a like like a big rubbish
[1:22:00] site where all rubbish all kinds of
[1:22:03] stuff
[1:22:04] you know from the whole city is being
[1:22:06] burnt
[1:22:07] there's a smell there's a few things
[1:22:10] and also a
[1:22:14] terrible smell coming around there
[1:22:17] that's how this world you smell to the
[1:22:18] believer
[1:22:21] and when that part of the world now
[1:22:22] comes in the church
[1:22:24] it vexes the believer
[1:22:28] and that's that that's the feeling that
[1:22:30] it caused in the believer
[1:22:33] now this is what he did now in in uh
[1:22:38] this is what it cost in lord
[1:22:41] lord was vexed by the evil this is a
[1:22:44] correct feeling
[1:22:46] that should these people should have had
[1:22:48] in
[1:22:49] in this place in the church of god
[1:22:53] paul was feeling that this is the way
[1:22:55] that they should have
[1:22:57] uh they should have felt about what was
[1:23:00] going on
[1:23:01] in the church we see the same thing
[1:23:03] happening
[1:23:04] in ezekiel the bible says that god came
[1:23:08] and spoke
[1:23:09] god spoke and said go through the city
[1:23:13] mark those people that are that moan
[1:23:19] moon because of the sin committed
[1:23:22] this is the right condition for people
[1:23:25] that are godly they should feel that we
[1:23:26] are about seen being committed in the
[1:23:28] church
[1:23:30] may the name of that glorify him now and
[1:23:33] they were marking the people that were
[1:23:35] sighing
[1:23:36] and mourning for the scenes that were
[1:23:39] committed
[1:23:40] in the city they were not like the
[1:23:42] people in the
[1:23:43] book of connections chapter five
[1:23:46] these ones were affected they were
[1:23:48] feeling that this
[1:23:49] condition was telling and they were
[1:23:51] praying already just even before god
[1:23:53] sent
[1:23:54] these angels to go through the city
[1:23:57] already that's the way
[1:23:58] the scene was you know that was there a
[1:24:01] feeling about the scene that was being
[1:24:02] committed in the city
[1:24:05] now we see that we see daniel in the
[1:24:06] book of daniel chapter nine
[1:24:11] the book of daniel chapter nine
[1:24:31] let's start from verse
[1:24:36] 3 and i set my face unto the lord
[1:24:40] god to seek by prayer and supplication
[1:24:43] with fasting and success and i prayed
[1:24:46] unto the lord
[1:24:47] my god and he made my confession and
[1:24:50] said oh lord
[1:24:51] the great and dreadful god keeping the
[1:24:53] covenant and mercy to them that love him
[1:24:56] and them that keep him his commandments
[1:24:59] now
[1:25:00] daniel was confessing
[1:25:03] not only his sins but the sins of his
[1:25:05] people
[1:25:06] we have seen plural
[1:25:10] not only himself but also the people and
[1:25:13] he was concerned with the sin
[1:25:14] of the people and he was presenting this
[1:25:17] condition to god
[1:25:18] and repenting on behalf of the people
[1:25:21] we have seen and have committed iniquity
[1:25:24] and have done wickedly
[1:25:26] and have rebelled even by departing from
[1:25:28] their precepts
[1:25:30] and from their judgments he was not just
[1:25:33] concerned with his own sin
[1:25:35] he was concerned also with the sin of
[1:25:38] the people
[1:25:39] of islam and he knew
[1:25:42] there would be consequences
[1:25:45] out of the inequity that was committed
[1:25:49] in islam
[1:25:50] in verse 20 it says and while i was
[1:25:54] speaking
[1:25:54] and praying and confessing
[1:25:58] my sin and the sin of my people
[1:26:02] islam president lori he was not only
[1:26:06] concerned with his own sin
[1:26:08] sin but he was also concerned with the
[1:26:10] sin of the whole of islam
[1:26:13] this is the light conditioned this right
[1:26:15] feeling
[1:26:17] of the believer the true believer about
[1:26:19] seeing happening in a church
[1:26:22] now we are not going to be passive about
[1:26:26] wrong things happening in the church
[1:26:27] just because we know we can never get
[1:26:29] lost
[1:26:31] we got to walk in a perfect
[1:26:34] way we have to walk in righteousness we
[1:26:38] cannot tolerate
[1:26:39] sin no as believers
[1:26:43] we cannot look around and see sin being
[1:26:46] committed
[1:26:47] and the wrong things happen in the
[1:26:48] church and we be quiet
[1:26:50] about it a true heart
[1:26:53] will be vexed by that a true heart
[1:26:57] will moan for that a true heart will do
[1:26:59] something about it
[1:27:01] because as we shall see we shall see
[1:27:04] what sin
[1:27:05] does if it is there in the church as
[1:27:07] much as we are saved
[1:27:08] as much as we are going to heaven as
[1:27:11] much as we are going for the rapture
[1:27:15] there is what sin does there is a damage
[1:27:19] that seems to us in the church
[1:27:23] there are consequences when the lamb is
[1:27:26] is with the living
[1:27:30] that lamb to stay without in the living
[1:27:34] we are saying like the bible is saying
[1:27:35] here it must be part
[1:27:37] the level must be purged out of the
[1:27:44] church
[1:27:46] may the name of the glory fine now
[1:27:49] i was just looking a little bit uh
[1:27:51] sometime and seeing what makes the
[1:27:53] the charge to compromise what makes a
[1:27:55] charge to lower the standard what makes
[1:27:57] the believers lower the standards
[1:28:01] you realize that people start very well
[1:28:05] we today we have the methodists the
[1:28:07] methodists never begun the way they are
[1:28:09] today we have the pentecostals the
[1:28:11] original preachers of the pentecost
[1:28:13] never preached what we are seeing among
[1:28:15] the pentacles today
[1:28:20] right now i'm reading a book about the
[1:28:23] about the azusa street pentecostal
[1:28:27] revival
[1:28:28] look at the principles that those people
[1:28:29] stood for look at what we see today
[1:28:33] today among the better councils we are
[1:28:35] having which wish doctors these are
[1:28:36] witches
[1:28:37] these are not christians these are
[1:28:40] thieves these are people freezing people
[1:28:42] out of their
[1:28:43] their money they never begun like that
[1:28:48] but there was a compromise and the
[1:28:51] compromise came because
[1:28:52] people saw things going wrong but they
[1:28:54] never bothered
[1:28:57] right that's right you are passive about
[1:28:59] it
[1:29:00] and sometimes you hear people talking
[1:29:02] about the church and saying okay i don't
[1:29:04] care about what anybody else is doing
[1:29:06] all right all i care is about my soul i
[1:29:09] care about my heart
[1:29:10] if my heart is light i with my god fine
[1:29:14] no you should care about what is
[1:29:15] happening around you
[1:29:18] because this is a lamp and it will
[1:29:21] affect you
[1:29:22] eventually to affect you it will bring
[1:29:24] proper
[1:29:25] problem to you sin does not weaken only
[1:29:28] the sinner
[1:29:29] it awakens even the people that are in
[1:29:31] the fellowship with you amen
[1:29:33] it brings weakness it brings defeat in
[1:29:36] the church
[1:29:38] and that's why this islam must be kept
[1:29:41] without in the living that's why every
[1:29:43] living
[1:29:44] must be purged
[1:29:50] may the name of that be glorified that's
[1:29:52] the reason why it
[1:29:54] must be paged now
[1:29:58] let us see some of the consequences
[1:30:00] things that happen
[1:30:02] when that one is not done
[1:30:06] uh let me get this squad here
[1:30:09] tonight i'm not going to preach much i'm
[1:30:13] just almost finishing
[1:30:15] but i have got a point here to to hammer
[1:30:18] before we come to the head of this
[1:30:20] service
[1:30:25] i arrived when i was very hungry and
[1:30:30] master one took me somewhere
[1:30:36] i almost ate off my my salmon
[1:30:54] okay
[1:31:01] and now after you are eh that doesn't
[1:31:04] mean that
[1:31:05] okay um
[1:31:13] and now after you are in that don't mean
[1:31:15] that you are out free from war
[1:31:19] right you still have to fight for
[1:31:23] every inch of ground you stand on
[1:31:31] glory to god
[1:31:38] i have with me a message that i call why
[1:31:40] do christians
[1:31:42] suffer why do we believe our server
[1:31:46] why when there is covered
[1:31:49] and we bring this is when we believe
[1:31:51] this is god judgment coming upon this
[1:31:52] evil
[1:31:53] evil world why do believers also die
[1:31:59] yeah why when we have believed god we
[1:32:01] have accepted god we are
[1:32:03] walking well we are working right with
[1:32:04] god
[1:32:06] then why do we suffer
[1:32:11] yeah problem is saying that when they
[1:32:12] got into the into in this area there was
[1:32:14] still war
[1:32:16] but i'm not on that so see currently not
[1:32:19] represent the great heaven
[1:32:20] because it's war and troubles and
[1:32:23] killings and fightings
[1:32:25] and so forth but it really represents
[1:32:28] this
[1:32:28] that it must be a perfect work
[1:32:33] glory be to god amen now this message is
[1:32:36] a holiness message
[1:32:39] the church of the message is a holiness
[1:32:41] church
[1:32:44] we must have this perfect
[1:32:48] work there is where the church
[1:32:52] is feeling today feeling
[1:32:56] is that the perfect work work
[1:33:09] there is this there is where the the
[1:33:12] the church is failing today on that walk
[1:33:15] do you know that even your own behavior
[1:33:19] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:33:21] healed
[1:33:24] why should this even stay
[1:33:27] why should this alarm stay without
[1:33:29] living
[1:33:31] because when there is a living which is
[1:33:34] seen
[1:33:36] then your
[1:33:40] misbehavior my misbehavior
[1:33:44] will prevent somebody we pray for here
[1:33:47] to be healed
[1:33:53] when one commits seen here in
[1:33:56] this lamp and then
[1:34:00] makes this whole lamp even
[1:34:04] we are the whole group is weakened
[1:34:08] it affects the whole group if you put
[1:34:10] little even in this corner
[1:34:12] it will affect the other every part of
[1:34:15] this lamp
[1:34:20] therefore when one man misbehaves when
[1:34:23] one person doesn't walk right
[1:34:26] what happens we are weakened
[1:34:31] we are defeated emily once again
[1:34:35] do you know that even your own behavior
[1:34:37] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:34:39] healed you are
[1:34:40] misbehaving of unconfirmed sins of you
[1:34:45] believers
[1:34:49] let me have as i sin if it is committed
[1:34:52] if it
[1:34:52] happens i'm not going to say that
[1:34:56] no sin will ever be committed in this
[1:34:58] church
[1:34:59] things will be committed why do i say
[1:35:02] that
[1:35:02] even the very church of jesus christ
[1:35:04] himself the word
[1:35:05] there was a thief there was somebody
[1:35:08] stealing
[1:35:10] is that correct right in his church
[1:35:12] judas was a thief is that what the bible
[1:35:14] says
[1:35:15] he was stealing this church of fast
[1:35:18] accordance
[1:35:19] was at the paw and you can see the
[1:35:21] condition they got itself into
[1:35:25] sin will be there shouldn't you be there
[1:35:28] people will do things in the church
[1:35:32] people would do wrong people would you
[1:35:35] know will be
[1:35:35] behave that's why we may not stop that
[1:35:39] one may not avoid
[1:35:41] you may preach sermons of fire and
[1:35:45] brimstone you can threaten and do
[1:35:47] whatever you want to do
[1:35:48] but people still do wrong
[1:35:52] but where
[1:35:55] we may be guilty is when we don't do
[1:35:58] what we are supposed to do
[1:36:00] if sin is committed let it be confessed
[1:36:06] that there be confession of sins let
[1:36:08] people feel guilty
[1:36:10] let people repent yes
[1:36:13] we are talking we are not talking about
[1:36:15] sinners we are talking about the
[1:36:16] believers they must repent
[1:36:18] and let me say here if anybody has seen
[1:36:22] let us not rest until he repents that
[1:36:26] sin
[1:36:26] yes just get concerned about it
[1:36:34] let's not be passive about it
[1:36:38] may the name of the lord be glorified if
[1:36:40] i commit sin i'm obligated to confess my
[1:36:43] sin
[1:36:45] because there is something blasphemy is
[1:36:48] calling here
[1:36:49] unconfessed sin
[1:36:52] you search in the message that condition
[1:36:56] you see what my mom talks about it what
[1:36:58] it does
[1:37:03] you see because that unconfessing is the
[1:37:05] living
[1:37:06] and it is now affecting the whole body
[1:37:10] it's affecting the whole lamb so
[1:37:13] here robin says here
[1:37:17] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:37:19] healed
[1:37:21] your misbehavior or unconscious off and
[1:37:23] confess the sins
[1:37:25] you of you believers not of the sinners
[1:37:28] but of you believers can cause this
[1:37:31] church
[1:37:32] to bitterly fail amen
[1:37:36] that's why i'm preaching about it
[1:37:39] and even brahman says here it should be
[1:37:41] preached
[1:37:45] and at the day of the judgment you'll be
[1:37:47] responsible for every bit of it
[1:37:49] all you say now with the many problems
[1:37:51] well that's the truth think of it
[1:37:54] now i am emphasizing on this point
[1:37:58] bitterly fail
[1:38:02] why are we failing not because of many
[1:38:05] people
[1:38:06] we don't have to get to this condition
[1:38:08] of this church of home
[1:38:10] not to get into that impunity of sin and
[1:38:12] everything else
[1:38:14] not becoming so common just one scene
[1:38:18] it was not a commons just a very and
[1:38:20] look at the
[1:38:21] the type of the scene just taking the
[1:38:24] babylonian garment
[1:38:26] and the wage just that
[1:38:29] just helping himself
[1:38:33] here they were conquering a nation he
[1:38:35] was a congregation they had beaten them
[1:38:37] and now he sees something good and puts
[1:38:39] it in his pocket
[1:38:40] he was not supposed to do that that
[1:38:43] alone
[1:38:45] you can see what it cost
[1:38:49] now i'm talking this to tell the
[1:38:51] believers that
[1:38:52] we should not be passive about sins
[1:38:56] listen how when do we
[1:39:00] in what circumstances do we kind of
[1:39:02] cover up
[1:39:03] sin most like most likely
[1:39:06] is among our people among our children
[1:39:10] among our wife among our husbands
[1:39:13] you cover your husband you cover your
[1:39:16] wife
[1:39:17] you cover your children your children
[1:39:19] are regarded as believers i'm being
[1:39:20] baptized
[1:39:21] you just dismiss these adjust children
[1:39:23] they'll learn how to work
[1:39:24] but as long as they are believers and
[1:39:26] they start smoking they start drugs they
[1:39:28] are doing all those kinds of things and
[1:39:30] they are coming to church here and they
[1:39:31] are taking communion
[1:39:33] that will make us to bitterly fail
[1:39:39] there are people who protect their
[1:39:41] people their friends that
[1:39:42] that the heart of the pastor cannot
[1:39:45] reach them so that he can discipline
[1:39:46] them
[1:39:46] there must be display in the church if
[1:39:49] sin is committed
[1:39:50] it must be made sure that it is
[1:39:54] confessed if not that is going to make
[1:39:56] us bitterly fail
[1:40:05] to make us to be to fail now
[1:40:08] uh on
[1:40:12] and on there are other other judgments
[1:40:14] you will be responsible for every bit of
[1:40:15] it
[1:40:16] you say now with america well that's the
[1:40:18] truth think of it
[1:40:20] joshua after he crossed over into the
[1:40:22] lord
[1:40:23] god gave him the promise
[1:40:27] to fight an entire campaign without a
[1:40:29] losing man
[1:40:31] let me tell you people some of the
[1:40:34] things that we go through example a
[1:40:35] problem
[1:40:36] which go through is not a mask
[1:40:40] we can even live without problems
[1:40:44] we can live in such a victory yes
[1:40:47] we can if it happened at one time
[1:40:50] it can happen again the god of the
[1:40:54] children
[1:40:55] is still our god today is that light
[1:40:58] look at these people two million people
[1:41:00] coming out of egypt
[1:41:02] they didn't have doctors among them
[1:41:06] they didn't have any food with them
[1:41:10] but they crossed that area from the
[1:41:14] from egypt to the promised land
[1:41:18] i've been privileged to to to travel
[1:41:20] through that area
[1:41:21] by bus through from kailua to to
[1:41:24] jerusalem
[1:41:26] and i'm telling you that region that
[1:41:28] area
[1:41:30] you won't even find a blade of grass
[1:41:33] it's desert
[1:41:35] and i really wondered how god led his
[1:41:37] people along that line but he did
[1:41:40] today today get the people about
[1:41:44] and remember those were two million
[1:41:45] people today get people
[1:41:47] just one hundred thousand and get them
[1:41:50] together somewhere
[1:41:52] i remember when there was problem in
[1:41:53] radar
[1:41:55] there was an exodus of people from
[1:41:57] rudder
[1:41:58] on foot and they crossed over into into
[1:42:00] congo
[1:42:02] and within one week or just a few days
[1:42:07] every day they were lining up corpses of
[1:42:10] people along the road to be collected
[1:42:14] thousands of people are dying every day
[1:42:16] out of colera because there's no water
[1:42:19] there's no food and all that and here is
[1:42:21] god taking two
[1:42:23] million people through the desert and
[1:42:26] there is no river between egypt and
[1:42:29] the only liver you get is jordan i'm
[1:42:31] telling the children that were born
[1:42:33] in the desert or in the journey they saw
[1:42:36] the fasting river
[1:42:37] when they were 40 years in children
[1:42:40] there's no reason around that
[1:42:42] religion but god came to them god fed
[1:42:45] them
[1:42:46] god closed them god did it
[1:42:49] that's our god that's a god we believe
[1:42:52] in
[1:42:54] i'm telling you if we can keep this lamb
[1:42:57] without living anything can happen
[1:43:01] we can have victory we can defeat our
[1:43:03] circumstances
[1:43:05] whatever comes allowed us we can defeat
[1:43:07] it but
[1:43:08] that all that god wants us to do is to
[1:43:11] keep the islam
[1:43:12] without living when things do work
[1:43:16] and blah blah is talking about joshua
[1:43:19] he fought he was in the war and he says
[1:43:24] joshua after he crossed over into the
[1:43:26] left god gave him the promise
[1:43:28] joy nothing to fight an entire campaign
[1:43:30] without losing a man
[1:43:35] without even losing a man
[1:43:39] america has a very strong army
[1:43:42] is very very good i believe is the most
[1:43:44] equipped
[1:43:45] army in the world
[1:43:48] i have seen many documentaries about
[1:43:50] america army
[1:43:52] america in afghanistan america where
[1:43:54] where is
[1:43:55] rwanda and everywhere i may not read
[1:43:57] about somalia
[1:43:58] and many parts of the world very very
[1:44:01] equipped
[1:44:04] but there is no other fight
[1:44:08] without bodybugs
[1:44:12] as much as that way equip that when
[1:44:15] strong that way
[1:44:17] still people die
[1:44:21] but look at these people they were
[1:44:24] fighting a war
[1:44:25] and nobody was going to die
[1:44:30] nobody was going to die
[1:44:34] josh after i cross over into them
[1:44:36] without losing a man without even
[1:44:38] getting a scratch
[1:44:40] without having to have an ass or a
[1:44:43] fasted
[1:44:44] or a bad amen god said the lord is yours
[1:44:48] to fight think of fighting a campaign
[1:44:50] and there is no red cross
[1:44:54] around at all there is nobody going to
[1:44:56] get hurt
[1:44:59] that's how successful that's our
[1:45:00] victorious there are
[1:45:03] tonight i'm saying if we really want to
[1:45:05] have the same kind of a victory
[1:45:07] let us keep this islam without living
[1:45:11] we shall have the victory amen and this
[1:45:14] and this they slayed the amorites and
[1:45:17] hit it but there wasn't one heart among
[1:45:19] any of them until seen come in the camp
[1:45:24] oh let us not have seen in the camp
[1:45:27] until sin came where in the camp
[1:45:32] and when arkham took that babylonian
[1:45:34] garment and that gold
[1:45:36] wedge and held it under his his camp
[1:45:40] then the next day they launched 16
[1:45:45] he meant that the six people joshua said
[1:45:48] stop wait a minute there is something
[1:45:49] wrong
[1:45:50] something is wrong here we are going to
[1:45:53] call seven days of fast
[1:45:54] god made us to a promise there will be
[1:45:56] nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at
[1:45:58] our feet
[1:45:59] and there is something wrong here
[1:46:01] something went wrong somewhere
[1:46:03] because we got 16 dead man laying here
[1:46:06] they are israelites why did they die
[1:46:09] innocent
[1:46:09] man because one man stepped out of line
[1:46:15] brother what are you preaching tonight
[1:46:17] i'm preaching
[1:46:19] let us stay in the line
[1:46:22] getting out of the line has consequences
[1:46:27] terrible consequences
[1:46:30] this one man brought the death of 36
[1:46:34] innocent they were not aware of what was
[1:46:36] happening
[1:46:39] but they died
[1:46:46] why did they die innocent man because
[1:46:49] one man stepped out of line
[1:46:50] you see this on this needs to be taught
[1:46:53] you see
[1:46:54] reason why this need to be taught
[1:46:57] sometimes i was thinking that this
[1:46:58] someone is very hard to preach to
[1:47:00] another pastor's church
[1:47:02] it's like i'm rebuking a church and i'm
[1:47:04] a visitor
[1:47:07] you know just somebody comes jumps from
[1:47:09] the plane and comes and
[1:47:11] brings a message like this one instead
[1:47:12] of something nice
[1:47:14] just to make people feel good
[1:47:17] but when i saw what i'm saying you see
[1:47:19] why this need to be taught
[1:47:22] i think it needs to be taught in every
[1:47:25] message church
[1:47:26] we need to hear that
[1:47:30] may the name of the glorifier yeah
[1:47:33] lining up with
[1:47:35] with each other the church lining up
[1:47:37] leaning up with the word of god
[1:47:39] landing up with god and lining up with
[1:47:41] each other working perfectly
[1:47:42] upright so ballet before all man fearing
[1:47:46] god
[1:47:46] because one man stole a garment and done
[1:47:48] something that he should not
[1:47:50] have done took the life of sixteen man i
[1:47:53] think it was
[1:47:54] uh sixteen maybe more i believe it was
[1:47:56] simon
[1:47:57] was dead george accord said
[1:48:00] there is something wrong god made the
[1:48:02] promise and something is wrong
[1:48:05] when we bring the sick up before us and
[1:48:08] they fail to be healed
[1:48:12] why do we have to bury
[1:48:15] everybody that dies in our east over the
[1:48:17] years
[1:48:22] i was speak preaching this in my church
[1:48:24] and i was asking them this church has
[1:48:26] been there
[1:48:30] since 1974
[1:48:34] everybody the anybody that has died we
[1:48:36] have married
[1:48:39] in all those years
[1:48:43] why shouldn't we have had enough faith
[1:48:46] enough at least to have two raised from
[1:48:48] the dead
[1:48:53] why are we so defeated we cancer comes
[1:48:57] on
[1:48:57] one of us we watch as that person dies
[1:49:00] away
[1:49:04] there's ways away
[1:49:08] there should be something wrong when we
[1:49:10] bring the sick before
[1:49:11] us and they fail to he be healed we need
[1:49:14] to call us all in fast
[1:49:15] call an assembly something is wrong
[1:49:17] somewhere
[1:49:19] god made the promise god's got to stick
[1:49:21] to that promise
[1:49:23] and he'll do it he called her first
[1:49:26] and they fouled out may the name of the
[1:49:30] autograph
[1:49:33] now i'm just finishing now
[1:49:47] i'm just going to say this and then did
[1:49:50] one one or two quotes here and then
[1:49:51] finish
[1:49:52] now uh if we had time i could just say
[1:49:56] more
[1:49:57] but i'm just putting my someone short
[1:50:01] but the mom talks about this lady this
[1:50:04] lady was
[1:50:05] kind of like she was a she had some
[1:50:07] mental problems
[1:50:09] and brabant tried to pray for her she
[1:50:11] could not never get healed
[1:50:13] and the problem was still continuing and
[1:50:15] still going on
[1:50:17] and she was not getting well at all
[1:50:20] until abraham didn't know why you know
[1:50:22] what was happening
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:26] but then one day when she came again to
[1:50:29] be prayed for
[1:50:31] then prabham saw a vision he saw that
[1:50:34] this lady
[1:50:35] when her husband went to i think germany
[1:50:38] she went and eloped and seen with
[1:50:40] another man with a man
[1:50:44] now and this scene was in her
[1:50:50] life and therefore problem
[1:50:53] came and talked to her told her
[1:50:56] what he had seen and she said oh don't
[1:50:59] you ever tell my husband
[1:51:01] tell no you have to confess that to your
[1:51:04] husband
[1:51:06] she said if i did that we are going to
[1:51:10] to divorce and we have got some children
[1:51:12] he said okay
[1:51:13] it's up to you now know what to do
[1:51:17] and just once they were on that ramp
[1:51:19] said wait a minute i can see
[1:51:20] even your husband when he went up there
[1:51:23] in germany he also did the same thing
[1:51:25] he still needs to confess to you and not
[1:51:28] only that one
[1:51:29] a few days ago he was in it with a woman
[1:51:32] in his place of work
[1:51:34] so go and get your husband so she went
[1:51:38] and got a husband
[1:51:40] and they went aside sat somewhere
[1:51:43] and each one of them confessed to the
[1:51:46] other
[1:51:48] now after that
[1:51:52] prabhan prayed for her and she was
[1:51:54] perfectly
[1:51:55] healed these are the words i wanted to
[1:51:58] hear what balabam said
[1:52:00] brabham said we start seeing
[1:52:03] in her life unconfessed
[1:52:08] no matter how much oil you poured on her
[1:52:12] she could never be healed
[1:52:16] another place he said no matter how much
[1:52:18] you stomp
[1:52:19] no matter how much you shout no matter
[1:52:21] how much you kick
[1:52:24] that demon can never leave
[1:52:27] because it has been given some
[1:52:30] legitimacy it has been given some
[1:52:33] right there that demon of unconfessing
[1:52:39] brethren you don't know what and
[1:52:41] confessions
[1:52:42] are doing in our church
[1:52:48] they are taking away the anointing they
[1:52:51] are taken away
[1:52:52] our victory amen
[1:52:56] may the name of the lord be glorified in
[1:52:58] another place he said
[1:52:59] now to get seen away from us
[1:53:03] sin must be confessed if you see a
[1:53:05] brother doing something go to him
[1:53:08] is up to you not up to the pastor you
[1:53:11] hear people talking about saying oh you
[1:53:12] know the deacons have left things
[1:53:14] people are just doing whatever they want
[1:53:16] and they're not asking them they're not
[1:53:17] doing anything about it
[1:53:18] it's not the deacons it's not the pastor
[1:53:21] it's you that have seen
[1:53:25] you that has seen that something is done
[1:53:27] wrong
[1:53:28] you are supposed to see that person talk
[1:53:30] to him
[1:53:32] why are you talking to him not to
[1:53:34] condemn him
[1:53:36] no but you want to help him to get out
[1:53:39] of that scene
[1:53:40] because even that scene will affect you
[1:53:45] so say the brother see the sister talk
[1:53:48] to her
[1:53:49] talk to him maybe
[1:53:52] you saw him drunks
[1:53:55] talk to him if he can see his sin and
[1:53:57] confesses his sin and depends
[1:53:59] wonderful that matter is there
[1:54:04] but if you just see and leave it problem
[1:54:07] says even
[1:54:08] you'll be responsible even yourself
[1:54:10] because you have seen it
[1:54:12] so it's not only my sin that i confess
[1:54:15] not only you are seeing that you have to
[1:54:17] confess but if you see somebody else as
[1:54:19] the bible says
[1:54:20] see him in that way we keep the islam
[1:54:24] without living
[1:54:28] brahman said if we don't do that what is
[1:54:31] going to happen
[1:54:33] the church will become so cold
[1:54:37] and he said the janitor will need to
[1:54:38] come and break the ice
[1:54:40] to have a service you wonder sometimes
[1:54:43] why we cannot worship
[1:54:45] sometimes we cannot feel the presence of
[1:54:47] god in the church
[1:54:49] something wrong has been committed
[1:54:51] somewhere
[1:54:52] and the living has entered into the lamp
[1:54:57] and has leavened the lamp
[1:55:03] seal must be dealt with salary
[1:55:08] yeah it is destroying us it's damaging
[1:55:11] us
[1:55:11] it's weakening us it's taking our
[1:55:14] victory away
[1:55:15] the victory of the church this is a
[1:55:17] chart that is supposed to be so powerful
[1:55:19] because this is a one charge this one is
[1:55:23] this is a church that should be seeing
[1:55:24] the arks
[1:55:26] acts being repeated once again
[1:55:30] there is nothing to stop that
[1:55:34] but we've got to keep the living
[1:55:37] off the lamp finally
[1:55:41] i'm sorry i'm taking i've taken some
[1:55:44] time
[1:55:45] let me just quit i'm just with this
[1:55:47] quote it's too close
[1:55:49] and then i'm done
[1:56:19] and the member of the church
[1:56:26] let me start here the minister has got a
[1:56:28] place of duty
[1:56:29] to stand and preach the unsearchable
[1:56:31] riches of christ
[1:56:32] without compromising
[1:56:38] yeah we preachers we have we don't have
[1:56:40] to compromise with our work the truth
[1:56:42] we must preach the truth there are many
[1:56:45] people who want to
[1:56:46] not to follow the truth and they want to
[1:56:48] be called church members
[1:56:51] there are many people that want to be in
[1:56:52] the church but they don't want to leave
[1:56:53] the word of god
[1:56:55] we should not compromise at all we
[1:56:58] should not fear to preach what is
[1:57:00] right which is what is the word
[1:57:08] amen
[1:57:10] if he has got to be a preacher he
[1:57:12] wouldn't spare one thing
[1:57:13] for one person if he's got to be a
[1:57:16] preacher
[1:57:20] amen yeah
[1:57:29] and the member of the church is going to
[1:57:30] be a member of this certain group
[1:57:32] then he would not compromise even a
[1:57:34] member should never compromise
[1:57:36] if the church believes that we should
[1:57:38] not gobble
[1:57:40] then that member should never touch a
[1:57:43] deck of cards
[1:57:45] you know the things that you are taught
[1:57:46] here you know what this church started
[1:57:48] for
[1:57:49] to be the truth to be the word of god no
[1:57:51] matter
[1:57:52] should we contrary to that
[1:57:56] i don't know how it is allowed here but
[1:57:58] we have a big problem in our country
[1:58:02] and the problem comes about football in
[1:58:06] europe
[1:58:07] england and all over europe
[1:58:10] this is the the these uh these are the
[1:58:13] things that our
[1:58:15] our young people watch and they have
[1:58:17] their support
[1:58:18] some are as ascendant or some for this
[1:58:20] and for this and sometimes they fight
[1:58:21] over that you cannot imagine football
[1:58:25] being played in england and people are
[1:58:27] fighting in a village
[1:58:28] over that they are so taken up by that
[1:58:32] football
[1:58:33] so there are companies that have come up
[1:58:35] for gobbling
[1:58:37] betting betting
[1:58:41] and we have a lot of problem in the
[1:58:43] church some young people get into
[1:58:45] betting
[1:58:47] you spend the money they borrow the
[1:58:48] money
[1:58:50] sometimes they get you to stealing
[1:58:53] that's what the government does it
[1:58:56] becomes a
[1:58:57] addiction addiction gathering
[1:59:02] if the church does not believe in
[1:59:03] gobbling no one should touch a deck of a
[1:59:06] card in a choice
[1:59:10] this that member should never touch a
[1:59:12] deck of cards we don't believe in
[1:59:14] drinking
[1:59:17] he should turn his head completely from
[1:59:19] drinking
[1:59:20] if we do not believe in gobbling or
[1:59:22] smoking
[1:59:23] the member of this church will never
[1:59:25] touch such a thing
[1:59:27] god gives complete deliverance
[1:59:31] praise the name of the lord we should
[1:59:33] never we should keep the word as it is
[1:59:35] preached by the pastor
[1:59:36] here in this church the pastor studies
[1:59:38] the world he knows what is the correct
[1:59:40] thing
[1:59:40] and he believes that things you must
[1:59:42] leave live according to that standard

[2:02:54] listen
[2:02:55] not one evil thought among us
[2:03:02] not one cigarette smoked
[2:03:06] not one short dress
[2:03:12] sometimes you look in the church you
[2:03:13] wonder
[2:03:20] these girls here have been baptized and
[2:03:22] they are taking communion and then they
[2:03:24] are wearing
[2:03:25] short dresses
[2:03:29] why you along that mother why are you
[2:03:31] learning that
[2:03:35] you allow me to speak like i'm speaking
[2:03:37] to my church
[2:03:38] when you came out from your house as a
[2:03:40] mother you didn't see that
[2:03:42] you that dress was shot
[2:03:45] i'm seeing you sitting there very
[2:03:46] comfortably and the dress is very short
[2:03:48] did you see it when you were when your
[2:03:52] daughter was getting into the car
[2:03:58] not one shot at this sometimes you find
[2:04:02] that
[2:04:02] our sisters are over things those
[2:04:04] sisters that are walking in the office
[2:04:07] you see people blow at you oh you show a
[2:04:09] long dress you're not an old woman
[2:04:11] you're not what why are you wearing
[2:04:13] this wrong dress you are sweeping the
[2:04:16] floor in the office
[2:04:18] and then that gets into you and then you
[2:04:21] fight you have a
[2:04:23] dresses for the church and some
[2:04:27] dresses for the office a little bit
[2:04:30] shorter
[2:04:34] you are beginning to compromise
[2:04:38] a bad spirit is starting to come in you
[2:04:41] you want to
[2:04:41] to start changing the faith of the
[2:04:43] message believers
[2:04:46] the main faith of the messenger device
[2:04:48] is that it's not that
[2:04:51] our study is to wear long dresses
[2:04:55] covering your body not tight presses
[2:05:02] i've heard there are some sisters who
[2:05:03] have some a pair of trousers to
[2:05:05] relax at home some pair of trousers just
[2:05:09] to hang around
[2:05:10] sweeping around the home but you don't
[2:05:12] go out with it but
[2:05:13] when you're just around there you have a
[2:05:14] pair of trousers and you justify it's
[2:05:16] just to make me relax you know
[2:05:20] that's the beginning of changing our
[2:05:21] faith
[2:05:26] may god help us
[2:05:31] not one second is smoked not one
[2:05:33] shortness not one this that or the other
[2:05:36] not one evil thought
[2:05:39] nobody got anything against one another
[2:05:43] everybody speaking in love
[2:05:47] and harmony everybody with one accord
[2:05:50] in one place then suddenly they come
[2:05:54] from heaven and sound like a rushing
[2:05:56] mighty weed there you are
[2:05:58] has blessed us with all spiritual
[2:06:00] blessings then the holy spirit
[2:06:03] might fall upon somebody in such a
[2:06:05] circumstance
[2:06:07] in such atmosphere you cannot go wrong
[2:06:11] for a long time before the holy ghost
[2:06:13] falls on somebody
[2:06:15] and then what happens and say that says
[2:06:18] a lot
[2:06:19] go to a certain place and do a certain
[2:06:21] thing
[2:06:22] which it happened just like that

[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:10] first john chapter 1 verse 7
[2:09:14] and if we walk in the light as he is in
[2:09:16] the light we have fellowship one with
[2:09:18] another
[2:09:20] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[2:09:22] claims us
[2:09:23] from all sins if we say
[2:09:26] we that we have no sin we deceive
[2:09:29] ourself
[2:09:31] and the truth is not in us
[2:09:34] if we confess our sins
[2:09:37] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[2:09:41] our sins and to cleanse us
[2:09:44] from all unrighteousness
[2:09:48] if we say that we have not sinned
[2:09:52] we make him a liar and his word
[2:09:56] is not in us now if there is one
[2:10:00] thing i would want i would love for us
[2:10:01] to take from the service tonight
[2:10:04] as brother peterson read that quote from
[2:10:10] the uh
[2:10:15] efficient series but branham says
[2:10:21] here is where the church is feeling on
[2:10:24] that walk
[2:10:26] and what he underlined is the
[2:10:30] misbehavior and what is the misbehavior
[2:10:35] the misbehavior is our failure
[2:10:38] of confessing our sins
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:44] a believer a child of god
[2:10:48] must never go before the father
[2:10:51] and forget that
[2:10:59] we must never go before the father even
[2:11:01] if you don't step
[2:11:02] out of your house
[2:11:07] even if you just lock yourself up in the
[2:11:10] in the room
[2:11:13] the 24 hours of the day when you get
[2:11:16] before the father
[2:11:20] we must never forget about that that
[2:11:24] is the misbehavior of the church
[2:11:28] the believer arriving to the place
[2:11:31] where he start to nurse in his mind that
[2:11:34] he had never done anything wrong
[2:11:37] he don't need because as soon as you get
[2:11:39] into that channel
[2:11:41] and start seeking god mercy oh god be
[2:11:44] merciful upon me
[2:11:45] if i ever taught anything i've ever said
[2:11:48] anything
[2:11:49] you fall right into the channel where
[2:11:53] you start to think about other people
[2:11:56] you just have to be compassionate
[2:12:01] even if someone hurts you it's easy for
[2:12:04] you to get to the place to start praying
[2:12:06] for that person
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:10] that's where the church is feeling
[2:12:15] and i believe that's what the holy
[2:12:17] spirit wants to underline for us
[2:12:19] let me say this to you if you remember
[2:12:23] we just coming from a communion service
[2:12:28] why would god bring a message like this
[2:12:32] we just from a communion service sunday
[2:12:35] evening
[2:12:35] [Music]
[2:12:38] why would it please the holy spirit to
[2:12:40] bring
[2:12:41] a message like this
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:46] like brother peterson said he's like god
[2:12:48] and i pick him up right after 5 p.m
[2:12:52] talking for something to eat right to
[2:12:54] the church we came
[2:12:56] you think about it think about unliving
[2:12:59] bread
[2:13:00] think about living thinking about jesus
[2:13:02] being our passover
[2:13:05] when we are just stepping out of a
[2:13:08] communion service
[2:13:11] i think what sometimes as
[2:13:14] believers especially our young people
[2:13:18] we get answers to walk up here and take
[2:13:21] the communion
[2:13:22] and we don't become conscious parents is
[2:13:24] your
[2:13:25] is your duty i love the holy spirit
[2:13:28] speaking that out
[2:13:29] you're supposed to watch over your child
[2:13:31] you're supposed to
[2:13:32] guide them you're supposed to conscious
[2:13:34] them
[2:13:37] it's your god giving responsibility
[2:13:40] if there are things to talk about unless
[2:13:43] it is above
[2:13:44] you and you need our help we will step
[2:13:47] into help
[2:13:51] but what i want to
[2:13:54] re-echo to you tonight the scripture
[2:13:57] says if
[2:13:58] we confess our sins
[2:14:01] he is faithful he will
[2:14:05] ever remain faithful
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:11] the brother shares there's the christian
[2:14:13] bar of soap
[2:14:16] the christian bar of soap is to confess
[2:14:20] your sin
[2:14:25] then the lord used the water of the word
[2:14:29] to wash you
[2:14:31] [Music]
[2:14:34] that is the misbehavior that the church
[2:14:37] has got in
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:46] let's stand on our feet tonight
[2:14:51] this is your heart
[2:14:57] come and do it

[2:15:06] house

[2:21:30] sit
[2:21:33] amen to your word lord god let the
[2:21:38] church
[2:21:41] said
[2:21:47] god had spoken
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:22:03] yes let the church
[2:22:06] [Music]
[2:22:20] church
[2:22:24] god has spoken
[2:22:30] let the church
[2:22:42] praise the lord let's remember that
[2:22:50] the holy spirit don't want that
[2:22:52] misbehavior in our life
[2:22:55] because he knows we can't help ourself
[2:22:57] [Music]
[2:22:59] but whenever you cry to the father and
[2:23:01] say lord have mercy
[2:23:04] at very end and presumptuous saying if
[2:23:06] there is anything lord
[2:23:10] you give the holy spirit charge over
[2:23:13] your life
[2:23:15] to even revere to you what you are not
[2:23:19] conscious of
[2:23:21] because the believers will never walk
[2:23:23] conscious in sin
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:26] the scripture says the believer won't
[2:23:28] parch and there is no desire there is no
[2:23:30] there is no consciousness but sometimes
[2:23:33] we are calling things that we are not
[2:23:35] conscious of
