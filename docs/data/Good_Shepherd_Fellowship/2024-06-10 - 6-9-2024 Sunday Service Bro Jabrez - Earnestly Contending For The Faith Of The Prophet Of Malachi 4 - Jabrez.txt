the service over to our brother and uh uh yesterday again uh we were we were hit with another uh side and you know it's a kind of a sweet B news when you hear that someone has gone to be with the Lord it should not be side but for some reason it always turned out to be side for us so it's a sweet and bit news uh uh brother Frank from Germany and uh went to be with the Lord yesterday and uh uh he's he also he's he's a veteran in uh in what he was doing for the Lord uh he met brother Brandon uh many years when brother Brandon was traveling around and he was one of the first person that took on doing translation in the French language and um you know in some foreign language over there in Europe and and down to Africa most French countries were affected by some of uh the work that he was doing so he pleased the Lord after almost about 8090 years old he went to be with the Lord yesterday praise the Lord so uh so many people are going home Heaven is becoming exciting praise the Lord with all the sad things that are happening on Earth Heaven is becoming exciting when when when when the sins cross over praise the Lord and uh uh just just thinking about it you know thinking about it uh uh speaking to uh a friend of mine um from Zimbabwe he was traveling out of the Congo from the convention and and uh he was over in in Alis Ababa Ethiopia and uh you know what he told me oh my you know all of these things happening all of these you know men going home I said well Jesus said when he was here he says the Harvest is ready the laborers are few he said pray to the Lord of the Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest so he can send laborers into his field praise the Lord that's what he said that we should pray so he can send laborers but now that very same law of the Harvest is beginning to call laborers of the field it's a sign that Harvest is over praise the lord it's a sign that Harvest is over harest is over harest been over since we just been in a gleaning season we've been like Ruth gleaning here and there one year one there you know one here one there last night I was reading an account of the Aza meeting in California you know how how the spirit of God was moving and I mean eyewitnesses that were there and and you can just see that yeah that was that was a time of Plenty you know that was a time of Plenty that mean want count you know the Believers pray that you could not come 3 feet close to the building the Holy Ghost will arrest you people going by their business 3 feet close to the building get arrested by the Holy Ghost and start crying to God that was a time of Plenty but you can get people right in service that's right right in service when the Holy Ghost is moving and nothing will happen to you that's right why because it's a gleaning season Harvest is over and one by one we gain the paron our cars are called one by one I don't know when mine will be called I don't know when yours will be called if there is ever the time for us to you know dust ourself from all playing and mess and everything and get a business with God is now you know those men they use their resources to propagate the gospel that's right they use their resources print books send Bibles travel places just so the gospel the message can go all over the world some of us we have not even started you know some of us we have not even started and the little

case you know I make those mistakes I told brother I said well just you know pick those words that are not American then you tell me outside so you correct it for me so that I can learn I want to learn God bless you thank you very much want to read the book of judee Jude 1 Jude 1 just 1 to4 it WR on this wise that Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied belov when I give all the legend to write unto you of the common salvation it is needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you you should earnestly contend for the faith which was one delivered unto the sins Jud is saying here for there are certain men crept in on aware who we before of old ordain to this condemnation on Godly men turning the grace of our Lord God into lasv yourness and denying the holy Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord bless his way in our heart in Jesus name amen may you be seated um knowing the time that we're living in and the hour that we're living in I just feel like taking a title this morning um to speak to you on earnestly contend for the restor Fai for enly contend for the restore Faith by Malachi 4 amen we know that um the Lord sent Malachi 4am to restore the faith back and not to fulfill Malachi 4 to turn our heart back to the faith amen of the uh Apostolic fathers so we know that and that is a message we receive is a message of restoration uh bringing back to us all those things that the early Apostle had so you know they have the original Faith amen and we called the alpha church and today we are called the Omega Church that is why uh the vision the prophetic Vision given to the prophet amen he saw us walking in the same step Onward Christian Soldier so that he might be the Alpha and the Omega so uh he has given us this faith in order to produce a perfect Church on the earth so let us um earnestly contend for their faith now BR Braham was speaking in a message titled earnestly content for the faith so he was saying here 1955 said now I believe that this book was written in a66 and it was 33 years then after Pentecost and Jude speaking to the church then was exalting them that they should enly contended for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now the prophet here is saying to inly contend for the faith not just a faith but the faith that was was deliver to the Saints now Jude is saying there speaking primarily of course to the church amen of that day not unbelievers not the outside us amen he was speaking to those who are Sanctified and called amen because the word Sanctified means being cleansed and set aside for God's Own service Hallelujah and these are the one that Jude is addressing not the unbeliever amen so it's primarily of course to the Church of that day that we should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the sins now I said let us stop here a few moments anly contending for the faith now what is it to contend brother say what is it to earnestly contend for is say contend is to debate yes are you with me amen amen it said to debate amen or to stand there and hold fast on your conviction amen amen not to back up not to be silent about it because when good people keep silence then evil Prevail praise God but the good ones should be able to stand up Amen to speak for what is Right deliberate on their conviction yes Hallelujah not being about it not backed up not be ashamed of the Gospel praise God in as much that they are convinced that what they are saying is right they to stand for it depend for it not been C back by by it amen see it's a confusion for what early content for the fa not just a Fai the Fai somebody say well brother that read my faith I don't I I say I don't believe that amen he said there's only one Faith Hallelujah One Faith one Lord one baptism and that faith of the Lord Jesus Christ just only one faith amen see so now remember this is J 33 years after the inauguration of the church at Pentecost 33 years amen 33 years later there has been such a falling away from that Faith that's right that early Apostolic church with Apostolic Doctrine Apostolic teaching there have such a fallen away amen un Jude here under inspiration of the Holy Spirit he sending the letter to the churches Amen to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now we can if we can only find out what kind of a faith that the sent have amen then we can find out what kind of a faith to content for is that right amen is that right right now the deciples of that day they teach repentance amen amen say believe of the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and not only you be saved your house shall be saved he said and th house amen so the faith they have in the gospel of that day was not just only for them was it so sufficient for their children for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are even as many as the Lord Our God shall call is God still calling praise God Amen such a f that you have no argument with Satan it's not what to debate or to us to backing for amen your salvation is for you and your children am the and th house hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen but it's so bad today that many times people and don't know what it means to repent Amen in the church young people BN in the church raise up in the church but they don't know what repentance is all about amen just a simple thing as repentance just turn around right you are going this way before and you this is not right change your ways change your perspective praise God and sometime you know the pastor the past to tr to speak to them and try to exort them to encourage them and uh tell them oh sister or brother this thing you are doing is not okay this is not fair look at what the word said this is what the Bible said this is what the prophet said you shouldn't do it don't go that way and they just stand like that and look at the pastor and after he has finished speaking they just tell the pastor God bless you Pastor thank you and they walk away is that repentance no is that how to repent amen the word repent that you realize that you being convicted that you are wrong are you feel and the Bible say prove all this and hold fast to that which is good because no man want to be found guilty of holding to the wrong thing to hold to the right thing and hold it fast amen amen amen it don't say Pastor oh I don't mean it I'm very sorry I thought I was right oh I my I'm very sorry about it I should have done that please forgive me can you pray with me pray for me that is repentance amen sorrow for sin amen but it's so bad today many of times you know both ladies and ministers and you know officers in church they don't even know what it means to repent but the Disciples of that day they taught repentance and they taught water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they taught Divine Healing and it will be going on every day in the church right praise God but it's so bad sometime the pastor will make a call across the sister brother see Church you see church he said oh Pastor in fact I woke up have a very bad day and a bad morning and I got so sick and my ache my back ache and this and that so well I just couldn't come to church that is why I couldn't come to church does it mean that there's no Bing Gan what is the first place of call praise God what did the Bible said is there any sick among you let call to the of the church let them anoint him with oil right and the prayer of the Saints the righteous man much even if SE God is able to raise him up praise God he will make excuses not to come to church but yet he will go to the hospital on Monday to go and consult a doctor where he will pay for consultation fee and he will pay for everything he will pay for the prescription he will pay for the drug amen and then he will pay with pain for the injections Hallelujah but here in church is without money without price whosoever will let him come Hallelujah because Divine Healing still remain in the church so the ear Christian disciple they Tau Divine Healing they taugh the resurrection of the Dead I love that because sometime this is tough when you come to that of the Dead to see somebody in church fall down and die oh my God it can cause confusion you understand people get panic like I was preaching one time in my church and it was lovely sister like that that just slip up a chair and she fell down and to

Ephesians 4 41 Ministry because God doesn't dwells in the mechanical device praise God to express his thoughts let's see what the prophet said here in the end time evangelism he said we find out that amen that in the beginning when a messenger was sent Amen to misconstrue his word or to D his word amen is it was total anation that's and an ential separation from God to miscon that messenger's word is that right amen amen and the first messenger was God himself amen and every other messenger has been God speaking through man did you see that every other Messengers every other through that every other message is God speaking to man see say since when is when God's word amen for there was no man there in the G of Eden amen for him to speak through true but just the one is talking to that's Adam he said but since he made man and redeemed man are you me yes sir since he made man and redeem man it has been God speaking through man amen did you get that amen has been God speaking through

Amen that's why Paul said that you are the temple of God God dwells in you you are a good Gooding place of God God dwells not in this building way this building is not the church amen but you as an

God you know what said in the message Elijah and the off amen said is said that is said that the problem with the church why the church is not getting anything from God praise God Amen is because the church don't they not thought of how to receive something from God amen amen it said God will always use a servant to give the church what they have need of Praise the Lord you understand amen say maybe because the people are not taught that God will always use a servant to answer their prayer amen amen God want God to know to come down an atmosphere maybe some an archangel to come down see now I'm here the great Gabriel to answer your prayer that is what they taught praise God amen us understand amen the Old Testament Daniel Prayed amen and God sent Gabriel and and we have the priest of P after we told Gabriel and then God to send Michel to come down to deliver Gabriel and answer their prayer that's the Old Testament said but in the New Testament say God doesn't send Gabriel or Michael so what God does in this Testament he said he gave his chch the power and he give them his name say ask anything in my name I will do itall praise God hallelujah because your prayers go a higher way million way higher that an angel stand pres of God praise God as of you think that God cannot answer your prayer God doesn't answer your prayer that I be pray God doesn't answer my prayer I've been

so and a message under it is that Joel baby sister has arrived Joel is parking a baby sister amen I said what do you mean you mean that sister has conceed and give birth to this baby rep yes say after you left amen you go conceive and give birth to this baby sister I said praise the Lord amen hallelujah am why is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's so easy to believe in the god of yesterday and to believe in the god of tomorrow for the god of today the present tense sh actively pres is difficult to believe that amen amen praise God Amen just because we don't have confidence in the pastor in the ministry God put on us praise God we want to debate want to argue with that Ministry praise God wanted to see that how we can polish the ministry to fit our own ways but but God never sent to PO the ministry he sent you to believe on that Ministry praise God and if you believe all these are possible if you believe in the that God put here you will see Miracle among you you will see Supernatural among you you will see signs and wonders in multile form among you because you believe praise God easy to talk about the prophet bra did this bra did that bra did that you can't get warm with what did yeah praise God that's a god of yesterday yeah praise God but he must lift him out of History are you feel you must raise him out of History because he still calling men he still sending men he's giv them different measures oh praise God his presence in the church to bless the people and the fivefold ministry is God's love gift to the church amen hallelujah to reject that Hallelujah is to reject God's gift to you amen praise God am oh my let me take a quote before we go let's see what the the Bible is saying here and what the prophet said in in Revelation 3:2 let's see what he said there uh it said now Be watchful and stren the things which remain that are heing to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God now was exing scripture in the church age there he said Be watchful amen as Straten the things which remained that are ready to die it said now the idea expressed in the two words watchful and certain amen at this to wash contains not only the idea of being awake but to be alert amen aler against any kind form of false doctrines alert against any form of false idea AER against every greet or dogmas aler because only 33 years the early CH left the faith Hallelujah and today we have promised that this last day many will left the faith and we get into seducing spirit and doctrines of devils hallelujah amen and then the prophet message has been here so long are church with all kind of ideas all around all form of organization praise be to God hallelujah yougan a yes said or means man over man where you have men as a leader above some bunch of men is an organization yeah right yeah praise God Amen because God has called you to an individual God deal with the church as an individual God deal with the pastor as an individual he has no Bishop over him amen he has no other head over him his headship is the Holy Spirit and his headship is not on Earth is in heaven amen amen praise be to God Hallelujah with all form of idea and organization and so forth praise God now uh is saying here is said what awake amen not only being awake but to be alert see to be otherwise inated dangers and losses it to strengthen means more than just to give strength it means to fix and establish it for permanency Hallelujah get the message yes sir contend with it debate for IT stand for your conviction Hallelujah fix it establish it in the church for permanency amen that's right amen hallelujah amen hallelujah but know sometime when a pastor is you know trying to fix it up Hallelujah to establish the message in the heart of the people and to fix it for permanency they oh Pastor is blessing too much Pastor is doing this too much but they don't know that the pastor is not dealing with the people he only dealing with the Devils the Demons of unbelief of the age are you following church amen so establ for permanen see the two words commanded refer refer to what is left of the truth amen which itself is ready or about to die about to die with so many argument of the add this and take this off this idea and that idea praise God Amen but they cannot say what the prophet said they try to explain it amen twist it to fit in their own ideas praise God Hallelujah to satisfy personal Ambitions praise God Amen are you in church right amen so amen said they took they took command refer to what is left of the truth which itself is ready or about to die this expression of the spirit comes before me as an ill an illustration Rob as an illustration a group of slaves in total bondage physical and moral have raisen up and escaped from their Capal indeed that was what s this means escape on they have escaped now they were ped amen because the devil will not allow you to go free the prophet if the devil can't take the truth from you he said we push you over with the truth amen you see the church is going to push you with that truth away so he will not just sit his hand and F his hand and look at you praise God no because the devil hat the truth he a lie whenever he speak he speak lie Hallelujah he will never tell you the truth Let It Be sickness the sickness is a lie whatever form hardship is a lie whatever the devil present to you is a lie depression is a Lie the devil have nothing real everything he have against you is false amen that's right praise God you must take the opposite position hallelujah hallelujah let the weak say I am strong amen let the poor say I am rich Amen Let It SE say I am here amen you must confess the opposite side and God will make your body to obey your confession hallelujah praise God amen amen so R said that they were pursued and this great gain and glorious G this great and glorious gain amen I but lost see they will not been overtaken are you for amen they in the message not be overtaken but they are about all that can be said is that they had Escape but not clean not clean a Escape praise God Amen as somewh according to the word they had lost so much of their Liberties are you feeling amen of the word of their Fellowship they have lost it they lost it so much on the some don't want to go to church again they want to stay home L is so much so don't want Pastor again they don't want any minister to to to to to to Pastor them or to lead them amen say we are on our own leader praise God God does not make a sheep to lead himself God give a sheep give sheep shepher to lead them praise God because when a sheep is lost is as helpless as helpless as it can be this a church praise God amen amen amen oh man so he said here he said they had lost much of their Liberties now the Lord says you are potentially back in captivity praise God Amen and that is the battle with the message church today potentially back to their captivity of their laia captivity they're not hot they're not cold they just look and because I P you out of my mouth praise God amen amen amen BL misation and all the bunch of words I believe the message I know the message I know where I'm standing where are you standing where are you standing that's right praise God if you know you're standing you will stand on the word praise God because the word is only way that is best to stand on that is secure place to stand on Hallelujah you stand on the word amen hallelujah and always be on fire for God Amen say you put the the church on fire not the pastor set the church on fire because no Minister bring a Revival the Revival come by the people is the people that brings the Revival am Hallelujah the they pray up and the spirit and all they worship they come to church ready to serve praise God with their mind made up to serve the Lord amen not to see any man but to hear from God and they come to church to receive from God hallelujah and they can't come to church with problem and go home without problem as said you come to church praise God with a certain situation in your life with a certain problem in your life and you come to church you worship and serve God and you go back home with the same problem say you have exed God hallelujah he say it's an insult to God for you to go back home with the same problem because you feel that God can't take care of it God is not able to do it handle it the problem is just too big that God canot cannot even manage that problem for you you have just insulted God because God has set his angels in the church amen to take care of every need in the church in every service angels are here to give you handful for the purpose God commanded his angels to do that just like the way Bas commanded his man the Reapers give root the C give handful for the purpose because she must go home with handful for the purpose not just go home out of service with nothing Hallelujah but say to go home with an handful for a purpose when you come to church this is B Feed the church is Jesus feed and you come to church you must go home with an handful for the purpose come on now that's right hallah that's right praise God Amen first to go like that as if God is powerless what kind of object have you make God make him a weak God and and my hand is not shorten that I cannot save I canot redem Hallelujah he's the one that work in the midst of the candles SS is's the husband of this church Hallelujah he take care of the need of the people whatever need you have he said come to me all you that labor and heav
