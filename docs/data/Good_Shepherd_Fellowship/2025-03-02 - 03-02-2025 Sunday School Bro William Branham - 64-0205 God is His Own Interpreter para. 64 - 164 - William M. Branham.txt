TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shs on and man doing these things and their members going playing golf on Sunday and picnic parties and swimming and things instead attending church sitting home on Wednesday night watching television instead of attending church on they feel like saying something about it but the board would put them out come on that's a matter it's lot again looking out of his window and seeing the sin and afraid to call Sin Sin Hallelujah Abraham wasn't in their mess he was out of it he was a type of the spiritual church and watch what happened just at the end time just before the fire fell and those were Gentiles it foreshadowed the fire falling on the Gentile world today when the kingdoms will be broke up and they'll be burnt Heavens will be on fire sayth the Lord and they'll burn with fervent heat that was a shadow of it now this picture here's Abraham already out not in Sodom he was out of Sodom lot was still in Sodom strange thing one hot morning along about 11:00 it must have been he saw three men coming ordinary man walking down the road the path Abraham was sitting under the oath re resting himself it be not probably at the herds that morning come in almost noon time and he saw three men coming and there was something about those men that rung of oh my there's always something about God when he comes among the people it rings the bell amen they know it there's something tells them there's a Vindication there Abraham run quickly and said my Lord come by let me get a little water fetch it and wash your feet and give you a marshall of bread then you can go on on your road so he turned aside he run in the herd and got a calf and killed it had a servant to dress it went in the tent down below him and got Sarah to need some flour make some or some meal make some bread and make the cakes on the earth brought them out and served while they were sitting there eating they begin to notice this man kept looking down towards Sodom and he said two of them you remember went down in Sodom two went to Sodom please don't miss this I'm referring to what Jesus said two of them went to Sodom to bring out lot and what was ready to be brought out down there and them two it went down there went down and preached and there was one stayed back with Abraham what the sign he done they got a sign down there there was the sodomites was smitten and blind preaching the gospel is always blinding to the unbeliever yes and notice what done now this one St back here and done a sign before Abraham now did you ever notice any historian follow the scriptures follow the history there has never been a time in the church ages where a man ever went to the nominal churches out there in the world out there in the denominations there's never been a man that is named in like Abraham h m before but today they got one gr a h a m right going down there calling him out he's doing a wonderful job by Graham Billy Graham God's servant out there amongst the denomination politicians and so forth smashing at it the other day when they want him to run for president he flatly turned it down God bless him for it while them Whiskey companies he never got the first base as it would been they' Have Spent billions of dollars because he'd put them out anyhow those cigarette companies and things like that see he's out there as God's Messenger to sodomites exactly but remember there was one who stayed up there with Abraham yes another man not them two went down there like a modern uh evangelist went down there to preach notice there was one stayed up there two went down that way and one stayed here with Abraham and the one who stated Abraham give him a sign now watch his name had been Abram and his wife had been Sarah just a day or two before that God had appeared to him and told him I'm changing your name now from Abram to Abraham see g r a h a m is six letters man but a b r a h a m is seven seven letters H ending with the H up here in the church spiritual there was one up there to Abraham and notice what he said he said Abraham not Abram Abraham where is thy wife not s a r r a s a r a h where is thy wife Sarah watch what he said she's in the tent behind you and he said I'll visit you I'm going to visit you see that personal pronoun the one a car in to the promise that he had made that was God yes he said I'm going to visit you and Sarah in a way that we'd all understand laughed up her sleeve to herself she said me an old woman 100 years old my Lord which was Abraham old also past time of life of that as young folks said well we canot have Pleasures like that anymore I'm old and he's old and said we couldn't have that so how these things couldn't be and the the man God in human flesh said why did Sarah laugh and doubt saying these things in the tent behind him now watch if that is the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had he looked out upon the audience and perceived their thought he told Peter who he was and what his father's name was told Nathaniel told the woman at the well when she said he said go get me a drink or bring me a drink she said sir it's not custom for you to talk to you Jews talk to Samaritans we have no dealings with one another he said but if you knew who you were talking do you'd ask me for a drink the conversation went on he said go get your husband and come here she said I have no husband he said You' said well for you've had five she said sir look at the difference between that and and that priest of that day that counsel living in a glare of another day they said this is the devil they had to answer their congregation to something because it required that but what did this poor little woman that predestinated seed laying in her heart she'd been sick and tired of that stuff she'd went on the streets as a prostitute but when she seen that she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we haven't had one for 400 years and we're told that when the Messiah cometh that's the things that he'll do oh my that seed laying there jump to life Hallelujah why it didn't need no interpreting Jesus said I'm he that speaks to you Hallelujah that didn't need no interpreting he had done the miracle and had testified that he was that Messiah four recorded what God had promised Lord your God shall raise a prophet like me said Moses glory to God what was it a Vindication of the scripture she run into the City and said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the very Christ isn't this him he told me what I've done now I notice Jesus that was him up there in that man at Teddy's back turned to the tent and told what Sarah was thinking about inside the tent the word of God says in Hebrews the 4th chapter that he says this the word of God God is more powerful and sharper than a two- aged sword of cutting to the S and the M of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart Hall it's a word and every time that a prophet came he come with the word and he was the word for that age what did he do a prophesier who discerned the thoughts that was in the heart had done it in Jesus Christ because he was the fullness of the word and Jesus said as it was in the days of solom so shall it be in the com of the son of man amen the spirit of God would come upon the Earth in a form of human beings God manifested in human flesh Hall amen do you see it amen and would do the same thing that God did in human flesh it's Sodom right remember they were waiting for a promised son and right after that the promised son came that was the last sign that Sodom and Abraham's group saw before the promised son arrived did you notice that and now the church spiritual has come to that hour somebody said brother Brandon did you say that was God the Bible said it was God it don't need no interpreting he's Elohim that's what Abraham called him any Bible reader knows that Elohim the alls sufficient one he was the first the last the beginning the end Elohim Abraham called him Elohim God in cap the letters in the Hebrew Elohim just like in the beginning God Elohim he was Elohim manifested in a human flesh wearing human clothes eating human food amen a sign that in the last days that God will appear again among his people in human flesh hallelujah amen Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also and as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man amen that don't need no interpreting it needs manifestation that's what it me amen do you believe that Hallelujah let's bow our heads our heavenly father we give to you thy promise tonight that you said these things you promis them there's no one can make your word live but you you said let there be light and there was light no one has to interpret that it was manifested as we quoted Isaiah the prophet a virgin shall conceive she did doesn't need any manifestation she did it that's what happened you said when he come to be born in Bethlehem out of Bethlehem Judea art thou not the least among all the princes of Judah of Israel but out of thee shall come the ruler of my people the things that he was do what he would cry at the cross how he be condemned pierced his feet and His Hands he was wounded for our transgressions and bruis for our iniquity Chast of our peace upon him with his Tripes we were healed how that David said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer as my Holy One to see corruption and on the third day before the 72 hours could set in to corrupt his body the word of God said he'll raise upall they said they stole his body away they still believe it but we believe Lord your word it was manifested Jesus Christ raised up and he said although I Am With You Always even to the end of the world we believe that you're here tonight we believe that you're just as much Jesus Christ tonight tonight here as you ever was and you're only looking for eyes arms legs mouth Souls bodies that you can use to manifest yourself God sanctify us tonight that we might see the living Jesus Christ living among us let him come then will come to pass like the hunger of those Greeks who came that day and said sir we would see Jesus and they got to see him oh what a thrill it must have been when they looked upon him God you're the same today and you promis that if we hungered we could see you a little while and the world won't see me the unbeliever but yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord the words has been said it's been written now let it be done for the glory of God to show that he keeps his word amen God bless you I'm going to call the prayer line I believe Billy said to give out prayer card to 100 or something like that um he isn't here just now is um what is a prayer card number somebody look on your back it' be a number and a and a letter A B C D what is it a all right uh let's have a number one two three four five just start standing up like this a number one number two number three number four four I didn't see it stand up prayer card number four one two three pray maybe they can't get up if they can't somebody look at your neighbor's card he may have a card he can't stand up quickly now there it is four five pray card number five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 just start coming up here now as your numbers your call number 1 2 3 just come right out this way prayer card number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 just take your places 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 does anybody can't I see a young man in the wheel chair back there if your number is called son and if you can't get well just hold your hand we'll see what you get here how many in year doesn't have a prayer card and yet you're SI let's see your hands anywhere have that's right put your hands up do you believe while they're getting them together do you believe this that he's the same yesterday and forever how many watch these ministers doesn't the scripture say today Brethren that he is a high priest that can be touched for the feeling of our infirmities is Right amen how many believes that raise your hand he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities then if the Bible says he's the same yesterday and forever how many believes that then how would he act today you'd have to act like he did yesterday is that right where's he at tonight sitting on the right hand of the Majesty his body the holy spirit is here in the building to make him known notice now look what happened when somebody touched His Garment back there a woman one day she didn't have a prayer card we say but she touched His Garment and when she touched His Garment Jesus turned around and said who touched me Peter rebuked him and said why Lord that doesn't sound just sensible like Well everybody's trying to touch you why I say who touched me he said but I perceive that I got weak how many knows that virtue which means strength went from me I got weak somebody touched me with a different kind of a touch and he turned around looked to the audience until he found where that channel of Faith everybody was putting their arms down oh Rabbi we believe you in all this but there was somebody really believed it and she touched His Garment and believed that she was healed but because she said in her heart if she could do it that's what would happen he turned around looked up on the audience till he found her and he said told her her blood issue had stopped and she was healed is that right now that's what he did in the audience of the people now I'm claiming that he is not dead he's just as much alive today as he ever was and the Bible said Jesus said himself as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look no matter what kind of a gift that God has up here there's got to be one down there to to respond to it he went into a city the Bible said there's many things he cannot do because of their unbelief is that right same thing today you've got to believe him you just got to believe him that's the only way you can is a prayer line ready now everybody Reverend for just about 10 minutes don't where get through that I got about 25 or 30 standing there but now in the prayer line each one of you out there in the prayer line that knows that I am a stranger to you and I don't know nothing about you raise up your hand each one in a prayer line all in the audience that knows that I know nothing about you raise up your hand now now here's what I'm trying to say friends see now here it is all these ministers up here on the platform and Christ made this promise see it's been written when was it to come to pass in the last days just before the coming of the Lord is that right it was to come to pass then now that's the word that's prophesied today not Luther's light not Wesley's light and not even the Pentecostal light it's gone on up the road now now the Luther's all right methodists all right Baptists all right all them Pentecostal fine there's all kinds sitting here tonight it ain't it ain't it ain't the individuals what if the you couldn't never tell a Methodist anything about Luther Because he believes in sanctification Luther don't see you never tell Pentecost that sanctification all he's seen the restoration of the gifts he ain't going to believe that no he's got more than that see and that's the last Church age that we had in the Bible says there'll be no more Church ages but there's to be a gathering of the people see and here we are I remember the last sign are we people looking for a promised son raise up your hand do you believe you are the Seed of Abraham by being in Christ raise up your hand then Seed of Abraham receive your sign it isn't out in Babylon it isn't out there in denomination world it's here among you those who are not in that mess out there believe it here's a woman she's a total stranger to me somewhere around the same age I never seen the woman in my life if I could heal that woman I would do it if she's sick I don't know nothing about her you see her raise your hand a few minutes ago I never seen her she's just a woman standing there today they come down here and got a bunch of prayer cards mix them all up and give them to the people one got number one here number 10 back there number 15 number seven number just like that they're all mixed up right before you every day and when they called they just called all IE run from everywhere see and now you don't even have to have a prayer card just sit there and believe why can't pinch yourself tonight find out the hour we're living in yes right ah it's just about over too friend just about over now if the god of Abraham raised up Jesus Christ from the dead and that Jesus promis it in the last days the same signs that Abraham at the angel which was God in human flesh done before Abraham just before the promised son arrived Jes Jesus said the same thing would take place today now we see the atomics and the denominations and all those and the mess that they're in we see a Billy Graham down there and or Roberts and all them people out there the Pentecostal messenger and the nomination messenger down in there we see all that going on carrying out the sign Billy Graham a theologian to the doc what the denomination believes in or Roberts A Healer to the dock just exact what the pentec but look here there's something else promised to the Seed of Abraham amen there they are down in the M nominations there's something out of the denomination supposed to happen amen Gathering of people we'll leave it go for tomorrow night watch I don't know that woman I'll turn my back to her if the Lord God will say something to that woman maybe it's it's domestic maybe it's Financial maybe it's sick I don't know she'll know whether it's the truth or not if he'll do the same thing tonight that he did then would you believe the god of of Jesus Christ promis would be here in the last days how many beli that we're living like in Sodom when the whole world has gone into a sodomite condition how many believes what I've told you tonight's the truth then children in Seed of Abraham believe God I sort of get it out of your mind I'm trying to say something to the woman looking her in the face or get all the things about telepathy or whatever you want to know anybody that knows about telepathy and shouldn't have better sense than that did you ever see a telepathist preaching the gospel did you ever see a spiritualist preaching the gospel doing signs and wonders proclaiming Jesus Christ the same no see it's just it's people's mind see they're blind do you believe they can be blind the Bible said they would be is that right he high-m minded lovers are pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a farm of godliness but denying the power thereof didn't Jesus say in St Matthew 24:24 that the two spirits in the last days almost deceive the very elect Ed if it was possible but it isn't possible they were in God's thoughts at the beginning they're part of God our god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob let it be known tonight that I'm telling the truth about you it's you Lord humbly let your servants be able to get their own thoughts out of the way that you could use our bodies for your glory in Jesus name the Son of God Amen what is a gift not something you take and chop and turn no no it's knowing how to get yourself out of the way that God can use you a gift is only getting yourself out then God uses a lady behind me is going to die right away if she isn't heal the lady behind me has just been prayed for by
