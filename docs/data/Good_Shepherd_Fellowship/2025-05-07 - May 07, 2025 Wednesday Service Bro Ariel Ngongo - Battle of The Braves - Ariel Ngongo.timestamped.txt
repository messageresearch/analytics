[52:24] bread. Lord God, we need bread. Lord,
[52:27] men shall not live by bread alone, but
[52:30] by every word that comes out of your
[52:32] mouth. Lord, may you speak your word to
[52:34] your people, take men out of the way, oh
[52:38] God, may the same Holy Spirit that fell
[52:40] the day of
[52:41] Pentecost, Father, in this street, oh
[52:44] God, that we will all remember, Lord,
[52:46] that from this day, something that
[52:48] happened to us. We give you fully this
[52:52] service into your hand. Lord God, I give
[52:55] myself to you. Every note, every
[52:56] thought, oh God, every men and women in

[53:23] Lord, we thank you for everything, Lord.
[53:25] And we all ask these things in the
[53:27] precious and wonderful name of our Lord
[53:29] and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[53:32] Amen. May God bless you. Thank you. As
[53:35] you're still standing, we'll open the
[53:37] scriptures in the book of Deuteronomy
[53:39] chapter 12 verse uh Deuteronomy chapter
[53:43] 20. We would like to greet you all in
[53:46] the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[53:47] Christ.
[53:48] It's always a privilege to be in the
[53:50] house of the Lord and just to fellowship
[53:53] around the word.
[53:56] U so I have a thought here I would like
[53:59] to share with you. Um it might look a
[54:02] little strange but I trust that the Holy
[54:04] Spirit will be able to help us. Just
[54:06] pray for me as I'm ministering. Uh I'll
[54:09] be praying for you as well.
[54:12] Deuteronomy chapter 20
[54:18] verse1 the Bible says when thou goest
[54:22] out to battle against thy enemy and
[54:25] seeing horses and chariots and the
[54:27] people more than thou be not afraid of
[54:30] them. Yes. Amen. For the Lord thy God is
[54:33] with thee which brought thee up out of
[54:36] the land of Egypt. Amen. It shall be
[54:40] when ye are come night unto the battle
[54:43] that the priest shall approach and speak
[54:45] unto the people and said unto them here,
[54:48] O Israel, ye approach this day unto uh
[54:52] unto battle against your enemy. Let not
[54:55] your heart faint. Fear not, and do not
[55:00] tremble, neither be ye terrified because
[55:03] of them. Amen. For the Lord your God is
[55:06] he that goeth with you. It's not just
[55:11] letting you go by yourself. He is with
[55:14] you to fight for you
[55:19] against your enemy
[55:21] to save you. And the officer shall speak
[55:25] unto the people, saying, "What is the
[55:27] man that has built a house and has not
[55:30] dedicated? Let him go and return to his
[55:33] house, lest he died in in the battle,
[55:36] and another dedicated. And what man is
[55:39] he that has planted a vineyard, has not
[55:42] yet eaten of it, let him also go, and
[55:46] return unto his house, lest he die into
[55:49] the battle. And another man eat it. And
[55:52] and and what man is there that has
[55:56] bestowed a woman and has not taken her?
[55:59] let him go and return unto his house,
[56:02] lest he die in the battle, and another
[56:05] man take her." Now, I want you to watch
[56:07] verse eight. The Bible says, "Then the
[56:09] officer shall speak further unto the
[56:11] people, and they shall say, "What man is
[56:15] there that is fearful
[56:18] and
[56:19] faint-hearted? Let him go and return to
[56:23] his house, lest his Brendon's heart
[56:26] faint as well as his heart. You may be
[56:31] seated.
[56:35] May God bless you tonight. Are you happy
[56:38] to be in the house of the Lord?
[56:41] Now we just for the few minutes that is
[56:42] before us I have a thought that I would
[56:45] like to speak to speak uh on the battle
[56:49] of the brave.
[56:52] The battle of the
[56:54] brave. Now just right from the scripture
[56:58] we just read I think the sister can help
[57:00] us with the powerpoint. I want to speak
[57:03] on the battle of the braves. Is do we
[57:06] have braves in the building tonight?
[57:07] Amen. Hallelujah. It's it's not really
[57:10] the number that matters, you know. It's
[57:13] it's the people that have trained
[57:15] themselves to battle. You know, they're
[57:17] very courageous. They're strong. They
[57:20] fought different battles and they came
[57:22] out victorious. You know, it's it's not
[57:24] the numbers. It's the is the quality.
[57:27] We're not looking at quantity here.
[57:29] We're looking at the quality of men and
[57:31] women that had fought battle and came
[57:33] out victorious. Amen. and and to these
[57:36] people that I'm addressing tonight and
[57:38] and to the bride of Jesus Christ. You
[57:40] know, um right from here we see the
[57:43] Bible says when thou goest out to battle
[57:46] against your enemy and seeing horses and
[57:49] chariots. Now who knows that our God
[57:52] knows the end before the beginning. He
[57:55] already disclosed his idea to them. It
[57:58] says when you are going to battle,
[58:02] right? Do you do you see that? It says
[58:04] when that goeth to battle, he's already
[58:06] telling you when you will h when that
[58:08] battle will happen. This is what you
[58:10] have to do. Is that correct?
[58:12] This is wonderful. It says he already he
[58:15] already disclosed to them what is going
[58:18] to happen. You know to the people of God
[58:21] there's no secrets. God disclosed his
[58:24] secret to his people. Amen. Now, and we
[58:27] just read when he's telling them that
[58:30] when you go to battle, I will be there
[58:33] with you. So, it basically tells you
[58:36] what will be your battle and it does not
[58:39] just send you by yourself. It it he it
[58:42] comes along with you. It may not be
[58:44] necessarily physical visible, but he is
[58:47] present. Is that right? Amen. Now it
[58:50] says when that goeth to battle against
[58:52] your enemy. Now you put on apprentices
[58:56] all the enemies that you have. You know
[58:58] individually we don't go out there and
[59:00] take guns and go shooting and go fight
[59:02] to different countries. We don't do
[59:04] that. Is that correct? But within
[59:06] ourself we have battle that is going on.
[59:08] Is that right? How many of us know that?
[59:10] You know it can be fear. It can be
[59:12] different. It can be an addiction. It
[59:14] can be something that you probably
[59:15] inherited from your parents. There are
[59:18] in you that you fighting daily every
[59:20] single day. So think about your enemy,
[59:23] you know, yourself. Don't don't look at
[59:25] somebody else. Now there might be if you
[59:29] look at it is identifying something
[59:32] here. It says and seahorses chariot and
[59:35] the people more than you. So it's
[59:38] basically telling them that there's
[59:40] going to be a n, you know, there's going
[59:42] to be a lot of them. So don't look at
[59:45] the number. Yeah.
[59:47] You see, it's telling you don't look at
[59:49] the numbers, right? But just know, do
[59:52] not be afraid.
[59:55] You see, it's telling you don't pay
[59:57] attention on the numbers.
[1:00:00] Oh, glory to God. Because there were
[1:00:02] many in the land. Is that correct? They
[1:00:04] were the Jebusite, the Amorite, the
[1:00:07] Parasites, you know, the Hite, the
[1:00:10] Canaanite, they were all over the place.
[1:00:13] Amen. Right. All this nation against one
[1:00:17] nation, one church of God. Yeah, that's
[1:00:20] right. You know many many armies are
[1:00:22] against us. You one Christian. But look
[1:00:24] at different things that are happening
[1:00:26] in your life. But I want to encourage
[1:00:28] you tonight. Lord, there's one more one
[1:00:32] more element I want to bring here is
[1:00:34] that the site was declaring a numerous
[1:00:38] enemies. Is that correct? So the site
[1:00:40] was declaring that oh look at them there
[1:00:43] are many of them. There are many nation
[1:00:44] they are stronger and they have they
[1:00:46] have a reputation in battle. Yeah. But
[1:00:49] you guys are just coming out of of
[1:00:51] Egypt. There is nothing. You never train
[1:00:53] yourself into battle. Okay. You see what
[1:00:56] I'm saying? Amen. But God does not want
[1:00:59] you to look at your eyes.
[1:01:02] Remember the story of Gazi? How many of
[1:01:04] us knows the story? The young man could
[1:01:07] see chariots, right, with his natural
[1:01:10] eyes. But a prophet that was a little
[1:01:13] higher in that spiritual realm, he says
[1:01:15] he prayed to God. He say, "Oh Lord, open
[1:01:17] the eyes of the young men."
[1:01:20] So he may see, he may see
[1:01:23] what angels that were present in that
[1:01:26] place that his natural eyes was not
[1:01:28] declaring it. But now when the prophet
[1:01:31] pray, God opened the eyes of the young
[1:01:34] men. He was able to come up higher a
[1:01:37] little bit to see how many angel was
[1:01:39] standing there. Yeah, that's right. Are
[1:01:41] you with me? Yes. So, tonight I will
[1:01:43] invite you to go a little bit higher.
[1:01:45] Come up higher, bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:48] Can you see angels that are all over the
[1:01:50] place in this room? Don't Don't look at
[1:01:52] it with your natural eyes. Believe it in
[1:01:54] your heart because that's the only way
[1:01:56] you can touch Jesus. We sung the song
[1:01:59] touching Jesus
[1:02:01] is all that really matter and your life
[1:02:04] will never be the same. The only way is
[1:02:07] to believe is to the only way you can
[1:02:09] touch him is believe in his word. Is
[1:02:12] that right? He's telling them don't
[1:02:14] fear. Praise the Lord. You know fear
[1:02:16] it's an a you know it's it's it's a
[1:02:18] unpleasant emotion that perceives like
[1:02:21] you know you you perceive that there's
[1:02:23] threat or danger that is coming. Is that
[1:02:25] right? You know every single one of us
[1:02:27] have come to that place where we fear
[1:02:29] something or you hear a news and and
[1:02:31] completely you know everything changes.
[1:02:34] Your mood changes. Amen. Fear is not
[1:02:36] something that is coming from God. It
[1:02:38] can be because Adam in the garden of of
[1:02:42] Eden had no fear. Fear had entered when
[1:02:45] sin entered. So which means God is not
[1:02:48] the altar of sin. Neither is the altar
[1:02:50] of fear. Is that right? And the prophet
[1:02:54] would tell us that fear is of the devil.
[1:02:56] Right? And fear it in simple way is the
[1:02:59] lack of confidence. Oh yeah.
[1:03:02] Because as soon as you know who you are,
[1:03:04] it takes away fear. Come on now.
[1:03:08] You see what I'm saying? If if you know
[1:03:10] who you are, it takes fear because you
[1:03:12] have the confidence that everything will
[1:03:14] be okay.
[1:03:16] Are you with me?
[1:03:19] Now, there were many nations that were
[1:03:22] they were there and God spoke to them.
[1:03:25] It says, I think in that very same
[1:03:27] chapter we read, it says when you enter
[1:03:29] into the the the land, you must destroy
[1:03:31] you must you must utterly destroy them.
[1:03:34] Yeah. How many of us have read that? So
[1:03:36] if you have your Bible, sister, you
[1:03:38] don't have to change the PowerPoint or
[1:03:40] maybe you can move to the next slide.
[1:03:42] That that's okay. So if you have your
[1:03:43] Bible, I'll just read it really quick,
[1:03:45] right? Uh uh chapter 20 verse 16 or 17.
[1:03:49] But thou shalt utterly destroy them,
[1:03:52] namely the Hittite, the Amorite, the
[1:03:54] Canaanite, the parasite, and all of
[1:03:56] these things. And one of these elements
[1:03:58] is fear. We spoke about fear just a few
[1:04:01] minutes ago.
[1:04:03] But one more thing is to be to
[1:04:06] sympathize just a little bit. There's a
[1:04:08] thought here that I want to bring. You
[1:04:11] know, when God told them to destroy all
[1:04:14] of it, right? All this nation, he told
[1:04:17] even babies
[1:04:20] You see what I'm saying? He's telling
[1:04:22] them, "Destroy everything." Amen. Even
[1:04:25] babies,
[1:04:27] you would come into the land, you see
[1:04:29] this little Canonite baby, those
[1:04:31] Jebusite baby, he looks so cute. You
[1:04:33] take him, "Oh, wow. This baby is so
[1:04:35] cute. But one day when that baby grows
[1:04:38] up, he'll be exactly like his daddy."
[1:04:40] Hallelujah. Amen. You see? Amen. If you
[1:04:43] don't make a decision now, you don't
[1:04:45] kill him right now, will cause a problem
[1:04:47] to the generation after you. Amen. So
[1:04:49] this fear that you entertaining actually
[1:04:51] will destroy your children later on. So
[1:04:53] you might as well just destroy it now so
[1:04:55] that that thing can be completely ann
[1:04:59] Oh glory to God. I'm just addressing
[1:05:02] fear but there are many different
[1:05:03] things. Amen. Amen. Amen. There are it
[1:05:06] can be anger. We always angry. Oh yeah
[1:05:09] get angry instead instead of fighting
[1:05:12] against it because that spirit will
[1:05:15] continue in generation. But if you break
[1:05:17] that cycle, it cannot go over. Oh, I
[1:05:20] believe I'm a I'm a cycle breaker.
[1:05:26] Oh, glory to God. I I do believe in
[1:05:28] that. Thank you, Lord. Are you with me?
[1:05:32] Now, it says that the priest, in other
[1:05:34] words, the preacher should encourage the
[1:05:37] people. Amen. Do not fear. Amen. The
[1:05:42] past two weeks, different preachers has
[1:05:44] gone, right? Many preachers have spoken
[1:05:46] about fear. You know, they give Satan a
[1:05:49] black eye. You know, I was passing by. I
[1:05:51] said, "No, I mean the black eye is not
[1:05:53] enough. Let me add a little bit more."
[1:05:55] Is that Is that right? So now I'm
[1:05:57] speaking to the battle of the brave.
[1:06:00] Amen. Amen. I I'm speaking to brave
[1:06:03] soldiers of God. If you are, say amen to
[1:06:07] the word. Oh, glory to God. Since we we
[1:06:11] my goodness my my my I have the first
[1:06:14] quotes there just for a minute let let
[1:06:16] me slow down a little bit
[1:06:19] herec the great the the great prince is
[1:06:21] just an introduction quote that I would
[1:06:23] like to read oh wow everything have
[1:06:25] changed in here that's fine in this
[1:06:28] great fifth battle that's what brother
[1:06:30] man is saying right as I've tried to
[1:06:33] fight it I've come some awful
[1:06:37] obstacles been over some rough road.
[1:06:40] That's what I'm saying. It It shows on
[1:06:43] me I have. But it it bent the it's been
[1:06:46] the most blessed thing that I wouldn't
[1:06:49] trade it for nothing in the world. He
[1:06:51] says, "Here's my greatest victory. The
[1:06:54] greatest pleasure I have is when I come
[1:06:57] up against something." Watch what he's
[1:06:59] saying here. I can't see I cannot see
[1:07:03] over it. Around it or under it. I just
[1:07:07] keep walking toward it. Amen. Toward it,
[1:07:10] believing this that God will make a way
[1:07:14] when I get there.
[1:07:16] You see, praise the Lord. This is the
[1:07:18] confidence that a man has with God.
[1:07:21] Amen. It's a relationship.
[1:07:23] That's good. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:07:26] This, you know, the way somebody speaks,
[1:07:28] you will know his relationship with God.
[1:07:30] That's right.
[1:07:32] Mhm. You know when he says when he lost
[1:07:34] his wife, he lost his daughter, you know
[1:07:38] it, people came to ask him, "Brother
[1:07:40] Bam, you still love the Lord. You still
[1:07:42] want to serve him? He still I still love
[1:07:45] him even after losing his wife."
[1:07:49] Say, "This is a different kind of
[1:07:51] relationship." Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] Amen.
[1:07:56] I was listening to a sermon. It says if
[1:07:58] even if he decide to send me in hell I
[1:08:01] will still love him. If there's anything
[1:08:03] called love in hell I will still love
[1:08:05] him.
[1:08:08] You see this is not just the feeling of
[1:08:10] somebody that has done good to you. This
[1:08:12] is beyond that.
[1:08:15] Praise the Lord. This is not just about
[1:08:17] oh wow my friend always agrees with me.
[1:08:19] No this is beyond the natural love. It's
[1:08:21] not the feel love. This is the agapa
[1:08:24] love. It goes beyond the love that you
[1:08:26] have for your husband, for your wife.
[1:08:30] You we must come to that confidence with
[1:08:33] the God that we serving.
[1:08:37] Thank you, Lord. Are you with me? Praise
[1:08:40] the Lord. It continues. It says, "I will
[1:08:42] never
[1:08:43] come this year, this far, and all this
[1:08:46] distance I have come. I have trust him
[1:08:49] and he never fail me." Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:08:51] Amen. You know, I was I was looking into
[1:08:54] I think I can use the definition of
[1:08:56] bravery and courage all together back
[1:08:58] and forth, right? And I want you just to
[1:09:00] bear with me. Is that right? You love
[1:09:02] the Lord. Amen. Now, the the the
[1:09:04] dictionary says bravery is the quality
[1:09:07] or state of having or showing mental or
[1:09:10] moral strength to face danger and
[1:09:12] difficulties. Ability to control fear in
[1:09:15] danger or challenging
[1:09:17] time. the ability to be fearless. Yeah.
[1:09:22] You know, courage is taking an action
[1:09:26] regardless of our afraid, intimidated,
[1:09:29] and unworthy or unsure to overcome.
[1:09:32] Okay? You know, we don't need courage or
[1:09:36] bravery when everything is well.
[1:09:41] Is that true? Yeah. You don't need
[1:09:43] courage and bravery when everything is
[1:09:46] just fine and you're laying down.
[1:09:54] It's needed when obstacles and
[1:09:57] challenges are before you.
[1:10:00] Amen. You don't need it when everything
[1:10:02] is fine. You need it in the time where
[1:10:05] you don't even have the strength to get
[1:10:06] up.
[1:10:09] Are you with me?
[1:10:12] We are not living in a time where we
[1:10:15] would deny the fact that we have
[1:10:17] challenges. We cannot deny them. We have
[1:10:20] challenges and we have to admit it.
[1:10:22] That's right. That's right. We cannot
[1:10:24] refuse to accept the reality or to
[1:10:28] acknowledge an unpleasant truth. We must
[1:10:32] be able to stand and say, "Yes, it is
[1:10:34] true. It's a challenge." But after you
[1:10:36] know that is a challenge, what are you
[1:10:38] willing to do about it? That's right.
[1:10:40] Amen. That's right. Amen. You see, this
[1:10:43] is the part where we are going. Now,
[1:10:47] God is not giving us the, you know, is
[1:10:50] not encouraging us. He has not called us
[1:10:53] to deny the reality of our challenges,
[1:10:57] right?
[1:10:58] Oh, no, no, no. I just don't want to
[1:11:00] talk about it. No. God wants you to know
[1:11:03] that there is a battle that is going on.
[1:11:05] That's right. Are you with me? right
[1:11:07] that there are a spiritual power that
[1:11:10] again coming against you. He knows that
[1:11:12] because he wrote it in the Bible. That's
[1:11:14] right. He plac it before you to let you
[1:11:17] know that hey, it's what is going on.
[1:11:21] But he does not just stop there to show
[1:11:22] you how the devil works. It tells you
[1:11:25] also how I'm going to be there when you
[1:11:28] are crossing these deep waters. Now it
[1:11:30] says this in Ephesians verse 12. He
[1:11:33] says, "For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:11:35] and blood, but against principality,
[1:11:38] against power, against the ruler of
[1:11:40] darkness of this world, against
[1:11:42] spiritual wickedness in the high
[1:11:43] places." The fact is that there are
[1:11:46] danger before us. Amen. There are
[1:11:48] challenges. There are battles. There are
[1:11:51] river that we must cross. There are
[1:11:53] valleys that full of traps. That's
[1:11:56] right. You go to work, there are traps.
[1:11:57] You go I mean everywhere. Even when
[1:12:00] you're sitting in your own room, you're
[1:12:01] dealing with battles. That's right. Oh,
[1:12:04] glory to God. But what am I doing about
[1:12:08] it?
[1:12:10] Lord, help me, Lord Jesus. Amen. Oh,
[1:12:14] glory to God. Amen. You know, a sister
[1:12:16] used to sing. It says, "Must I car must
[1:12:19] I be carried home to heaven on the
[1:12:21] flower bed of his? One other foot to win
[1:12:24] the price and sell through bloody sea.
[1:12:28] Yeah. I cannot sleep when others are
[1:12:31] fight. Those that went before me, they
[1:12:34] lay down and they die. But with a
[1:12:36] testimony.
[1:12:38] Thank you, Lord. But the Bam says, even
[1:12:40] if I pray for a sick,
[1:12:43] and after praying the person die, he
[1:12:46] instead I will still preach divine
[1:12:48] healing.
[1:12:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Because life is not
[1:12:53] easy. Amen. One day Jesus was sleeping
[1:12:56] on the boat with his disciple. 10,000
[1:12:59] demon. Look at even Jesus himself. He
[1:13:01] did not live in denial.
[1:13:04] And just just bear with me. 10,000
[1:13:07] demons stood up. It says today since
[1:13:09] this man is sleeping, we're going to
[1:13:11] destroy him. They were ready to do
[1:13:14] anything. But Jesus was sleeping. Even
[1:13:16] when the the water was coming up and
[1:13:18] down, he was he was tired and sleepy. He
[1:13:20] had probably a wonderful meeting.
[1:13:24] Amen. But the power was in him. Even
[1:13:27] under that condition, he did not say,
[1:13:29] "Oh, well, he had headache."
[1:13:32] He was heartbroken. He was like you and
[1:13:35] I. Yeah. He did not deny that Satan was
[1:13:38] trying to destroy him.
[1:13:41] Jesus tempted him after he had received
[1:13:43] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:46] He was sent to the wilderness to be
[1:13:48] tempted. Amen.
[1:13:50] You see, all of these things happened to
[1:13:52] Jesus himself. That's right. So, it's
[1:13:55] not uncommon. That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:58] But watch this thing. The storm and but
[1:14:01] the promise was that nothing could stand
[1:14:04] before him. Nothing could happen to him
[1:14:06] until the purpose of his life is
[1:14:08] fulfilled.
[1:14:10] Say, you see, nothing will happen to
[1:14:11] you. The reason why Jesus is saying do
[1:14:14] not fear is because nothing will happen
[1:14:17] to you until he allows it to happen.
[1:14:19] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:23] Watch this. No matter what was
[1:14:25] happening, Jesus was inside of the boat.
[1:14:27] Yeah. Let me pick up some scriptures
[1:14:29] here. John chapter 16:33. These things I
[1:14:31] have spoken to you that in me you might
[1:14:34] have peace. What what Jesus is saying?
[1:14:36] In the world ye shall have tribulations,
[1:14:40] but be of good cheer. I have overcome
[1:14:43] the world.
[1:14:45] Oh, glory to God. It says wherefore 1
[1:14:48] Corinthians 10 10:12 he says wherefore
[1:14:50] let him that thinkkest he standeth take
[1:14:53] heed lest he fall
[1:14:55] there is not temptation taken you but
[1:14:58] such as is coming to men but God is
[1:15:01] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:15:04] tempted above that ye are able
[1:15:09] but with the temptation also and make a
[1:15:13] way to escape that he may be able to
[1:15:16] bear it. That's right.
[1:15:20] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:23] Amen. David, the summit says, "Yeah, do
[1:15:27] I walk through the valley of the shadow
[1:15:29] of death. I will fear no evil,
[1:15:34] for thou art with me. Thy rod and a
[1:15:38] staff, they comfort me."
[1:15:42] Oh, glory to God. Look at all of these
[1:15:44] promises as for you and I. We are fully
[1:15:48] loaded for Bible say. Oh, glory to God.
[1:15:53] We are fully loaded tonight.
[1:15:56] Oh, I feel I feel good to be in this
[1:15:57] presence. Amen. Right. Amen. Now, watch
[1:16:00] this thing. As soon as what happened to
[1:16:03] to to the rich young ruler? How many of
[1:16:05] us knows the story? That's right. He
[1:16:06] comes and meets Jesus and all of these
[1:16:08] things and Peter comes. He says, "But
[1:16:10] you know, Peter looks and says, "Man,
[1:16:12] Lord, we are walking with you. This man
[1:16:15] had a lot of money. He just rejected
[1:16:16] you." He fell a t
[1:16:19] away. Are you with me? Amen. Then Peter
[1:16:23] said, that's Matthew chapter 19 27. It
[1:16:25] says, "Then Peter said unto him, behold,
[1:16:28] we have forsaken all and follow thee.
[1:16:30] What shall we have therefore?" And Jesus
[1:16:33] said to unto them, verily I said unto
[1:16:36] you that you know verily Jesus says
[1:16:40] verily but the prophet says thus said
[1:16:42] the Lord means that it cannot fail. When
[1:16:44] he says verily verily it cannot fail.
[1:16:46] Watch this thing. He said, "Verily I
[1:16:48] said unto you that ye which have
[1:16:50] followed me
[1:16:52] in in the great generation when the Son
[1:16:56] of man shall sit in the throne of his
[1:16:58] glory, ye also shall sit upon the 12th
[1:17:02] throne judging the 12 tribe of Israel."
[1:17:05] Amen. That's to the Jew. But to you is
[1:17:08] to sit on the throne with God.
[1:17:11] Hallelujah.
[1:17:13] You can't pick up these things, right?
[1:17:15] You you caught this. Yeah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] The disciple will judge the 12 the
[1:17:19] tribe, but you will sit sit with him.
[1:17:24] Thank you, Lord. You will be on the
[1:17:26] throne.
[1:17:27] Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Verse 29 it says, "Everyone that forsake
[1:17:32] houses or brethren and sisters or father
[1:17:34] and mother or wife and children and
[1:17:36] lands for my name's sake shall receive a
[1:17:40] hundfold and shall inherit
[1:17:44] eternal everlasting life."
[1:17:47] Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] Praise the Lord. See, how does it feel
[1:17:51] that you're going to live eternally? How
[1:17:53] does it feel? You may not feel it
[1:17:54] because you you're tied into time. Yeah.
[1:17:57] But come higher a little bit. Enter into
[1:18:00] that realm. You will see that living
[1:18:02] eternally is the best thing that you can
[1:18:03] ever imagine.
[1:18:06] Amen. Oh, glory to God. After that,
[1:18:09] Peter understood in first Peter, it
[1:18:11] says, "Belove, think ye not strange."
[1:18:15] Concerning the spirit tries, which is to
[1:18:19] try you as though some strange things
[1:18:22] happen to you, behold, rejoice in so
[1:18:26] much as ye are partakers of Christ
[1:18:28] suffering, that when this glory shall be
[1:18:31] revealed, ye shall be also glad also
[1:18:34] with exceeding joy. Amen. Peter
[1:18:38] understood that taking side with Jesus
[1:18:41] has a cost. It comes with a cost.
[1:18:45] But he understood also that I have to
[1:18:47] fight.
[1:18:49] Amen. Amen. You're fighting a battle by
[1:18:52] identification.
[1:18:55] You can you just imagine this battle did
[1:18:57] not start today. It started a long time
[1:19:00] ago. Amen. You just fighting this battle
[1:19:03] because you decided you made the choice
[1:19:05] to be on Jesus side. And as soon as you
[1:19:08] made the choice to be on Jesus side, all
[1:19:11] hell break loose against you because you
[1:19:13] have taken your position.
[1:19:15] You were brave enough to s I'm going to
[1:19:18] live for Christ. Amen. And there is a
[1:19:20] reward that for for you. Amen. The
[1:19:22] battle that is going on is the battle
[1:19:24] between right and wrong. Yes. the hell
[1:19:27] and and heaven, God and Satan, Jesus and
[1:19:32] and uh uh uh this guy what his name the
[1:19:36] one who uh uh uh betrayed Judas,
[1:19:40] right? Jacob and Esau, this battle I
[1:19:42] started a long time ago has been
[1:19:44] pardoned that same way.
[1:19:46] The tree of
[1:19:47] life versus the the the tree of the
[1:19:50] knowledge of good and evil, the true
[1:19:51] vine and the false vine. Yeah.
[1:19:55] Let me def Let me tell you tonight that
[1:19:58] battle is not your battle. There you go.
[1:20:01] It's the Lord's battle. It's something
[1:20:04] that already started.
[1:20:07] You just took side with Jesus Christ.
[1:20:09] You are dealing with the suffering. But
[1:20:11] yet there is a glory that is ahead of
[1:20:13] you. Praise God. The battle of the
[1:20:15] brave. The greatest battle ever fought.
[1:20:18] Brother Benam says this 62 you know he
[1:20:21] says this great the first battle that
[1:20:23] ever fought begin in heaven. And when
[1:20:25] Michael and the angel fought against
[1:20:27] Lucifer and his angel it started the
[1:20:29] first battle was in heaven and sin did
[1:20:31] not originated on earth. It originated
[1:20:34] in heaven and then it was thrown down
[1:20:38] from heaven cast out of heaven to earth
[1:20:43] and fell on human being. So that battle
[1:20:45] that was a angelical battle became a
[1:20:48] human battle. It continues to say then
[1:20:50] the battle from angel became human
[1:20:52] battle and Satan come to destroy God
[1:20:54] creation and what God had created to be
[1:20:58] for itself. Right? He had Satan come to
[1:21:01] destroy it. That's what his purpose was
[1:21:05] was to destroy it. He lost the battle in
[1:21:08] heaven. When he fell on earth he says
[1:21:10] I'm going to destroy everything that God
[1:21:12] made.
[1:21:13] So anything that is on the earth
[1:21:15] including you and I, we are Satan has
[1:21:18] the purpose to destroy us.
[1:21:20] Because the prophet is telling us here
[1:21:22] that's Satan's purpose. So if you know
[1:21:25] the purpose, you already have the key of
[1:21:27] everything. Are you with me? Because if
[1:21:29] we go into battle, I know your secret.
[1:21:32] Then I mean you're going to lose the
[1:21:34] battle. That's it. Praise the Lord. So
[1:21:36] let me just say this tonight. Every
[1:21:39] single one of you, have the key or have
[1:21:43] the secret of Satan.
[1:21:47] Amen. Oh, glory to God. You are the
[1:21:50] secret service, the secret service of
[1:21:52] heaven. Amen. You are the CIA of heaven.
[1:21:56] You are the Mossads of heaven because
[1:21:58] you already know the tactic of the
[1:22:00] enemy. Praise the Lord. Amen. Oh, glory
[1:22:05] to God.
[1:22:06] We have secret agent in here in this
[1:22:08] room tonight who knows Satan's plan
[1:22:12] fully from the beginning to the end.
[1:22:14] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Blessed be the
[1:22:16] name of the Lord.
[1:22:19] First Peter chapter 5:8, it says, "Be
[1:22:22] sober. Be vigilant because your
[1:22:24] adversary, the devil, has a rolling
[1:22:26] roaring lion walking about seeking whom
[1:22:28] he may devour. whom
[1:22:32] resist steadfast in the faith knowing
[1:22:35] that the same affliction are
[1:22:37] accomplished in your brethren that in
[1:22:40] the world in other word but resist him.
[1:22:44] Amen. Be firm in your faith. Yes.
[1:22:49] You see be firm to to be firm you have
[1:22:53] to be confident in what you got. Yes.
[1:22:56] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] Are you with me? Amen. You must be firm
[1:23:04] to what God has put in your life. Look
[1:23:06] at this greatest battle ever before I
[1:23:08] continue. It says, "So let cast out the
[1:23:12] evil one." Look at what the prophet is
[1:23:14] saying. Amen. Let take our position like
[1:23:18] the star of heaven. Amen. 55.
[1:23:23] Yeah. As the Bible speak wondering star.
[1:23:26] Just watch with me right over in the
[1:23:28] book of Jude forming out of the own
[1:23:31] shame and we don't want to be wondering
[1:23:33] star wonder if this is right wonder if
[1:23:36] death is right wonder if it will happen
[1:23:40] he says how can uh how it could be don't
[1:23:45] wonder stay like those stars of heaven
[1:23:50] as a real soldier at his post of duty
[1:23:55] stand there and he says what? Believing.
[1:23:59] So the only way you can stand in your
[1:24:02] position, you stand believing. Don't
[1:24:05] just stand wondering.
[1:24:07] That's right.
[1:24:09] Amen. You know, a wandering star is a
[1:24:12] celestial object that appear to shift
[1:24:15] their position in the sky. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:19] When the weather is cold, I get cold.
[1:24:21] When it's hot, I become
[1:24:24] hot. is now it's you know it's like in
[1:24:26] the natural but now in the spiritual is
[1:24:28] the same. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. What is the
[1:24:31] time when we used to worship God and
[1:24:32] clapping our hands and jumping and all
[1:24:34] of it now we getting cold.
[1:24:37] Are we wondering star or we are standing
[1:24:40] in opposition? Praise the Lord. In good
[1:24:42] time in bad time I must be able to serve
[1:24:45] God the same. Praise the Lord. Thank you
[1:24:48] Jesus. So watch what the prophet says
[1:24:50] here.
[1:24:52] This soldier appointed to fight. If you
[1:24:55] are a soldier tonight, you need to be
[1:24:57] appointed to you are appointed to fight.
[1:25:00] Amen. Brother Brandham says something
[1:25:02] question and answer on Genesis. It says
[1:25:03] when God created me, William Brandham,
[1:25:06] it says I was before the foundation of
[1:25:07] the world. He made my being, my spirit.
[1:25:10] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[1:25:12] I know. He says, but I was there. Amen.
[1:25:16] Amen. Amen. Watch this thing. Very
[1:25:18] important. He says, I was there.
[1:25:20] Remember Job? God asked him where were
[1:25:23] you? Job did not have the revelation
[1:25:25] that you have. Amen. Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:29] When you ask me, meet me Ariel here.
[1:25:31] Brother Ariel here. Ariel, where were
[1:25:33] you? I was I will tell you I was in the
[1:25:36] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:25:38] world. Amen. You see, Job when the
[1:25:42] question was asked, he did not have the
[1:25:43] revelation that you have. The seal the
[1:25:46] Oh, glory. The book was still sealed.
[1:25:48] But now that the book is open, you know
[1:25:50] your position.
[1:25:53] And then that's why William Brandon
[1:25:55] says, "I was there." Amen. Because
[1:25:58] that's a man who knows his position.
[1:26:01] He says, "Oh, I don't believe you
[1:26:03] getting it." But now just a minute.
[1:26:05] Jesus told his disciple that he knew
[1:26:07] them before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:08] And Paul says they that hear that and
[1:26:12] and said here that he chose us in him
[1:26:16] before the world began. That's Ephesians
[1:26:18] chapter 1 verse three. It says now there
[1:26:21] was some part of me on my level and I
[1:26:24] think and the rest of you all here
[1:26:28] there is there is in Christ in Christ
[1:26:32] Jesus before the world ever begun. He
[1:26:35] says here is to analyze that I think
[1:26:37] that the people today are obsessed with
[1:26:40] this spirit or the spirit and part of
[1:26:44] this angelic being spirit which rotated
[1:26:48] off of God that never fell in the
[1:26:52] beginning
[1:26:53] and resisted
[1:26:56] the devil's lie in heaven. Amen. So when
[1:26:59] you were in the mind of God, you
[1:27:02] resisted against the the devil then. So
[1:27:05] if you resisted then, you will resist
[1:27:08] here. Those that fought against Michael
[1:27:11] and they were thrown on earth, they lost
[1:27:13] the battle, they're going to lose the
[1:27:15] battle here. If I won there, I will win
[1:27:18] here. Hallelujah. That's right. So if I
[1:27:22] was there as a victorious, I will be
[1:27:24] victorious here. Amen. That's what
[1:27:27] really is trying to tell you.
[1:27:30] Oh, glory to God. I feel like dancing
[1:27:33] this evening.
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:37] He is faithful. Amen. He is faithful.
[1:27:41] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Let me let me
[1:27:43] change the gear a little bit here.
[1:27:47] Numbers chapter 13 verse1. And the Lord
[1:27:50] spake unto Moses, saying, "Send our
[1:27:54] men," you know, he sent the 12, the
[1:27:58] leaders of every single tribe. Is that
[1:28:00] right? He send them, you know, go and
[1:28:04] and spy the land and all of it. That's
[1:28:06] right. Are you with me? Amen. The the
[1:28:09] leaders of every
[1:28:12] tribe, the head of every tribe.
[1:28:18] Just bear with me. There's a reason why
[1:28:19] I'm repeating these things. The head of
[1:28:22] every
[1:28:27] tribe. Verse 25. And they returned from
[1:28:31] searching. That's after they went into
[1:28:33] the land. Verse 25. And they returned
[1:28:36] from searching of the land after 40
[1:28:38] days. And they went and came to Moses
[1:28:39] and Aaron and all the congregation of
[1:28:41] the children of Israel unto the
[1:28:42] wilderness of Pam to Kadesh and brought
[1:28:45] back the word unto them and and unto all
[1:28:48] the congregation and showed them the
[1:28:49] fruit of the land. He's like, "Oh yeah,
[1:28:52] definitely. This is you know these are
[1:28:53] the fruit that you guys said. I mean
[1:28:56] that's that's true, right?" And they
[1:28:58] told him saying, "We came into the land
[1:29:00] when that sendth us and surely watch
[1:29:03] what they're saying
[1:29:04] here. And surely he flowth with milk and
[1:29:08] honey, and this is the fruit of it.
[1:29:10] Amen. Amen. But we just read in
[1:29:14] Deuteronomy
[1:29:16] chapter 20 verse 8,
[1:29:19] watch now very carefully 28. It says,
[1:29:22] "Nevertheless," what do you mean
[1:29:24] nevertheless? Yeah, right. It says,
[1:29:27] "Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:29:30] dwell in the land and the city are
[1:29:32] world. every great and moreover we saw
[1:29:35] the children of Anak there. The
[1:29:36] Amalachite dwell in the land of the
[1:29:38] south and the Jebusite and the Amorite
[1:29:41] dwell in the mountain and the Canaanite
[1:29:43] dwell but the sea and the coast of
[1:29:46] Jordan. Watch the believers now. Yeah.
[1:29:52] Did they really see the enemy? Yeah. Did
[1:29:55] they see the giant? Yeah. Amen. Were
[1:29:58] they eye declaring it? Yes. Yeah.
[1:30:02] Were they strong? Absolutely. Yes, they
[1:30:04] were strong.
[1:30:07] But watch the approach of a believer.
[1:30:12] Watch the approach of a believer
[1:30:15] here. And
[1:30:18] Caleb still the people before Moses. He
[1:30:22] said, "Let us go up at once." Amen. and
[1:30:28] possess it for we are well able to
[1:30:32] overcome.
[1:30:37] How in the world I'm seeing giant I'm
[1:30:40] seeing wars. I'm seeing all of these
[1:30:41] things. You telling me that we're more
[1:30:43] than able? Yes, saints. These things
[1:30:47] happen in our own life. Yes. Praise the
[1:30:49] Lord. These battles are happening in our
[1:30:52] own mind every single day. Mhm. Yes. You
[1:30:58] get caught into this spirit that has
[1:31:01] taken 25 years that you cannot be
[1:31:03] delivered of. You wonder God,
[1:31:08] this thing looks so big.
[1:31:12] But Caleb stood before Moses and the
[1:31:15] congregation. He says, "We are more than
[1:31:17] able."
[1:31:20] Not just able, more than able.
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:25] That's why saint it doesn't matter what
[1:31:27] is happening in your life.
[1:31:31] You are more than able. We approaching
[1:31:34] these things from the battle of the
[1:31:36] brave. We're talking about braves. You
[1:31:40] are more than able. Let me say it
[1:31:42] tonight. If there is anybody that is
[1:31:45] sick tonight, take God's word. You see
[1:31:46] what will happen.
[1:31:50] Amen.
[1:31:51] We are more than able.
[1:31:53] We are more than able. Brother Bam says
[1:31:56] this in this great warrior Joshua. It
[1:31:59] says Joshua and Caleb when they heard
[1:32:01] all this murmur. The people said,
[1:32:04] "Oh, it can be done. It can be done."
[1:32:07] Caleb run out in the midst of the people
[1:32:09] and quietened them. Said, "Yes, it can
[1:32:13] be." Yes. Amen. He acknowledged Yes. It
[1:32:18] can be. Of course they are giants. Amen.
[1:32:21] Joshua stood by him said certainly can
[1:32:24] be. God is giving it to us. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:31] Are you with me? Amen. I like that. Yes,
[1:32:34] sir. What was it? They were positionally
[1:32:38] born in Christ. Amen. You see now
[1:32:42] wondering they were positionally Amen.
[1:32:46] born in Christ. Amen. They had a
[1:32:50] knowledge of the word
[1:32:53] and the word became becomes manifested.
[1:32:58] So they heard the word,
[1:33:00] they knew the word and that word was
[1:33:04] coming to manifestation. Now
[1:33:07] the manifestation is when the trouble
[1:33:09] comes.
[1:33:11] It's not when everything is good. You
[1:33:12] need courage when things are off. When
[1:33:15] things are are wavering all over the
[1:33:17] place, that's when you need it. That's
[1:33:19] when everything comes to manifestation.
[1:33:22] You show your colors in the time of
[1:33:24] trial. Praise the Lord. In the time of
[1:33:26] adversaries, in the time where things
[1:33:28] are getting too serious. Amen. Let me
[1:33:31] continue to read. Amen. Remember
[1:33:34] everyone of those watch. Oh, I like
[1:33:37] this. It says, "Remember, everyone of
[1:33:40] this Israel heard the word of God
[1:33:43] preached to them."
[1:33:45] Did they hear the word? Yes, they heard
[1:33:47] the word. It was preached to them.
[1:33:51] It says, "But it only taken effect
[1:33:57] upon Caleb and Joshua." Yes. To realize
[1:34:01] what it was all about.
[1:34:04] Amen. It's not just going to church and
[1:34:06] listen to the word. Everybody listens to
[1:34:09] the word. Amen. But what we need for the
[1:34:13] church of the living God is the effect
[1:34:15] of the word.
[1:34:19] You see, we don't want to see just
[1:34:21] claims. We want to see the effect of the
[1:34:24] word. When we talking about revival,
[1:34:27] everybody jumping. Oh yeah, we need a
[1:34:29] revival. Saint let's start a revival in

[1:34:50] Thank you. Oh glory to God. When the
[1:34:52] move of God is flowing all over this

[1:35:11] power that is inside of you that is
[1:35:13] pushing you is going to be okay. Be

[1:35:23] You say, "I will still go to church."
[1:35:25] Amen. People look at you and say, "Where
[1:35:27] are you going again?" "I'm going to
[1:35:29] church." I'm like, "You sick? Where
[1:35:31] would you go to church? I still go to
[1:35:34] church."
[1:35:36] You see, I will go to church and I will
[1:35:38] be healed. I know. Glory to God.
[1:35:43] You must you probably, you know, I see
[1:35:45] grandma last time coming in. Oh my. What
[1:35:48] what what excuse can we give ourself and
[1:35:50] not showing up to church? When somebody
[1:35:53] in that condition will still come to
[1:35:54] church. Amen. Amen. Just because of a
[1:35:57] headache. Oh, wow. I can't I can't make
[1:35:59] it to church today. I'm saint. We are in
[1:36:02] the battle. This is not a picnic. Thank
[1:36:04] you, Lord. Amen. You know, there is a
[1:36:07] blessing in staying with the word of
[1:36:09] God. You know,
[1:36:11] not to give credit to me, you know, my
[1:36:13] wife and I just lost a baby last year.
[1:36:15] Yes.
[1:36:16] I saw her coming to church in that
[1:36:20] condition. And many of you just didn't
[1:36:22] know the baby already passed away when
[1:36:24] she was
[1:36:27] here. That was hard.
[1:36:30] But there is a blessing.
[1:36:33] But the one knows there is a blessing,
[1:36:36] God's reward.
[1:36:39] God blesses just for standing for him.
[1:36:43] Even if you hurt,
[1:36:46] even if it's hard,
[1:36:49] just stay there. He He's faithful,
[1:36:52] church.
[1:36:53] Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] God want you to believe. What would he
[1:36:57] tell you something and lie? He cannot
[1:36:59] lie.
[1:37:01] There's one thing that God cannot do is
[1:37:03] lie. He cannot say something and change
[1:37:05] his mind. You have to trust him. Thank
[1:37:08] you, Lord. You know, I challenge you to
[1:37:10] trust him and come if he does not do if
[1:37:13] you fully believe in him, you fully
[1:37:15] trust in him. If he doesn't do it, come
[1:37:17] to me and say, "God did not do I don't
[1:37:19] believe God anymore." He is faithful.
[1:37:22] This is no longer the time to be afraid.
[1:37:23] Oh, can God answer? No, no, no, no. It's
[1:37:26] no longer the time to wonder. It's the
[1:37:27] time to stand and say, "I believe it.
[1:37:29] Even if you don't give it to me, I will
[1:37:32] still come to church. I will still serve
[1:37:34] you. I will still give you the best even
[1:37:36] if I'm weak." Thank
[1:37:37] you. Thank you, Jesus. Yes, Lord. Oh,
[1:37:42] glory to God. Thank you, Lord. Then
[1:37:45] after the sacrifice, after the labor,
[1:37:49] he's giving you words. You know, there's
[1:37:51] a scripture here that said, "Fear not,
[1:37:53] little flock."
[1:37:55] For it is your father good pleasure to
[1:37:58] give you the kingdom.
[1:38:00] Amen. Why are you fearing? You know, you
[1:38:03] know how many time God says fear not in
[1:38:05] the Bible? almost 365 times.
[1:38:10] 365 times.
[1:38:13] It says don't fear. Don't fear. But you,
[1:38:15] oh God, there's this thing going on. I
[1:38:17] mean, this thing will happen to me. He's
[1:38:19] just telling you, don't fear. Just trust
[1:38:21] me. Just keep walking. Everything will
[1:38:23] be okay.
[1:38:24] Brother Benham says something deep
[1:38:26] calling onto the deep. He says, "Admire
[1:38:29] anything that got courage." Yes.
[1:38:31] Everything. Anything I like. Sorry.
[1:38:34] Anything I don't like is the wishywashy
[1:38:39] so-called Christian. That's right. I
[1:38:41] like men and women says it's God's word.
[1:38:45] Amen. I humbly accept it and I believe
[1:38:49] it and I live by it. God grant the day
[1:38:53] when men and women will be just what
[1:38:56] they confess to be. It wasn't if it
[1:39:00] wasn't for Christ, I will be today
[1:39:02] against him. Amen. He says, "But I
[1:39:05] believe him." I'm ready to die for the
[1:39:08] hope that lays within me of him.
[1:39:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:15] God need men and women that are
[1:39:17] courageous.
[1:39:20] That are brave and say, you know, I'm
[1:39:22] going through this, but I'm looking for
[1:39:24] an opportunity to overcome. Amen. Can
[1:39:29] you imagine there's trouble somewhere.
[1:39:30] You just come and say, I need trouble.
[1:39:33] You you going instead of running away
[1:39:35] from the enemy, you're going in the
[1:39:38] offensive s church. This is the time
[1:39:40] where we going offensive. It's no longer
[1:39:43] the time. Oh, I'm defending. I'm trying.
[1:39:45] Oh, God. These things are No, no, no,
[1:39:46] no. It's the time where we going offense
[1:39:48] and say, "Okay, uh what's going on?
[1:39:50] Let's let's go to battle, pastor. Is
[1:39:52] there anything else that we need to pray
[1:39:53] about? Is there anybody that has a need?
[1:39:55] I want to stay in church and pray a
[1:39:57] little bit more here." You know,
[1:40:00] you going to the office. Oh, yeah. I'll
[1:40:02] pray for all the brothers today. I'm
[1:40:04] just going to consecrate myself just for
[1:40:05] the You're going offensive. The devil
[1:40:08] doesn't even know to he won't even know
[1:40:09] what to do with you. That's right.
[1:40:11] Because you're already coming from
[1:40:12] different direction.
[1:40:15] Amen. It's not just there are people in
[1:40:17] the Bible. Huh? Sisters, I I got
[1:40:21] something. Judges chapter 4. It's not on
[1:40:23] my notes there.
[1:40:26] It talks about jail. How many of us have
[1:40:29] read the book of Judges?
[1:40:30] The Bible talks about Jel. There's one
[1:40:32] thing that caught my attention, you
[1:40:34] know. And J went verse
[1:40:37] 18. And J. Oh, okay. J uh J went out to
[1:40:43] meet Cesyria. And said unto her, turn
[1:40:45] him my lord. Turn into me. Fear not. And
[1:40:49] when he had turned into her into the
[1:40:51] tent, she covered him with a mantle. And
[1:40:54] he said unto her, give me I pray thee.
[1:40:56] You can read the whole chapter maybe at
[1:40:57] home. and a little water to drink for
[1:41:00] I'm thirsty. And she opened a bottle of
[1:41:02] milk and gave him milk and cover him.
[1:41:05] Again he said unto her stand at the door
[1:41:07] in of the tent if he shall be when any
[1:41:10] man doeth come and inquire of these said
[1:41:13] is there any man there thou shall say
[1:41:15] no.
[1:41:17] Watch this. This is the woman that is
[1:41:18] anointed for that for that hour. Are you
[1:41:22] the enemy is coming to your house to
[1:41:24] give him milk and all of these things.
[1:41:25] Watch this thing now. Verse 21. Watch
[1:41:28] what the Bible
[1:41:29] says.
[1:41:32] Then Abra's wife,
[1:41:35] this sister was
[1:41:37] married. She was somebody's wife. But
[1:41:39] watch what she did. Took a nail of the
[1:41:44] tent and took an hammer in the hand and
[1:41:48] went softly unto him and smote the nail
[1:41:51] into his temple and fasted it into the
[1:41:54] ground. For he was fat, asleep, and
[1:41:57] weary, so he died. In the time of the
[1:42:01] judges, a sister that is married, you
[1:42:03] say, "No, I'm part of this battle, too.
[1:42:06] I can't just sit like this." And some
[1:42:08] say, "Oh, yeah, I'm married. My husband
[1:42:10] has to fight all the battles." No, this
[1:42:11] woman here. Yeah, that's right.
[1:42:13] Hallelujah. This mother,
[1:42:16] she took a nail in the hammer and said,
[1:42:18] "No, let me kill this guy, too. I have
[1:42:19] an opportunity." And it is written in
[1:42:21] the book of Judges. That's right.
[1:42:22] Because of the anointing of the day, it
[1:42:26] was not just men. Women also were this
[1:42:30] had the same anointing to destroy the
[1:42:33] enemy.
[1:42:37] You see what I'm saying? No excuse
[1:42:38] nowadays.
[1:42:40] Huh? Yes. What about Esther? She stood
[1:42:44] up and said, "If I perish, I perish."
[1:42:48] Huh? Hallelujah. She was determined to
[1:42:51] set her people free.
[1:42:55] You know, Modi said, "You have come to
[1:42:58] this kingdom for such a time as this."
[1:43:00] Is that right?
[1:43:02] That's what Modi said. For her to do the
[1:43:05] act, she had to realize that I have come
[1:43:08] to this kingdom for such a time like
[1:43:11] this.
[1:43:13] You have come to the kingdom of God for
[1:43:15] such a time like this.
[1:43:18] You have received the baptism of the
[1:43:20] Holy Ghost for such a time like this.
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:25] Are you with me? You are chosen,
[1:43:28] elected, set aside for service, anointed
[1:43:32] to destroy your enemy,
[1:43:35] are you with me? That's right. Oh, glory
[1:43:38] to God. You have come to this kingdom,
[1:43:42] the kingdom of heaven. For such a time
[1:43:44] like this
[1:43:46] that's a sister now
[1:43:49] Shadak Mesh and Ago the king decreed
[1:43:52] that every man that will you know will
[1:43:54] not bow down will be thrown in the
[1:43:56] fifest was you know it was even heated
[1:43:58] seven times the king might have said oh
[1:44:02] my goodness I'm going to burn these guys
[1:44:04] I'm going to burn them and the religion
[1:44:08] those guys stood up he says no we will
[1:44:10] not bow down and brother Bam says
[1:44:13] They looked at one another. He says,
[1:44:14] "Hey, Shadrach, Meshach, did you did you
[1:44:16] pray?" Say, "Yeah, I pray. Are you sure
[1:44:19] we are you you about to change your
[1:44:21] mind?" He said, "No, I'm not changing my
[1:44:22] mind. It's going to happen." Hallelujah.
[1:44:28] It says, "Our God is able to deliver
[1:44:31] us."
[1:44:32] Now, it says, "Nevertheless,
[1:44:36] if he does not, if he decides
[1:44:40] to change his mind, He says even if it
[1:44:44] does not help us, we will still not back
[1:44:47] down.
[1:44:50] You know when God sees such a faith, you
[1:44:53] know, brother says in heaven all the
[1:44:55] angels gathering. He says, "Father, have
[1:44:57] you seen what is going on on earth?" He
[1:44:59] said, "Yep, yep, Gabriel, I saw that w
[1:45:02] stood up. He says, you please, you know,
[1:45:05] I destroy I destroyed the world in the
[1:45:07] time of Noah. Do you want me to go
[1:45:09] there?" Listen,
[1:45:10] I I've been watching them since last
[1:45:14] night. I I've been I've been I've been
[1:45:17] watching the s since last night. Praise
[1:45:19] the Lord. Don't worry about it. I got it
[1:45:21] under control.
[1:45:24] And few minutes later, brother says he
[1:45:26] stood up out of his throne.
[1:45:29] Hallelujah. Where did we find him? On
[1:45:32] earth as the fourth man.
[1:45:34] You see, you have to be so balanced and
[1:45:37] neutral. that even if God deliver me,
[1:45:40] I'll be happy. But even if he doesn't do
[1:45:42] it,
[1:45:44] I will still not bow down. You talking
[1:45:47] about bravery.
[1:45:49] You talking about courage. Amen. Oh,
[1:45:52] glory to God. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:45:55] You see, but Revelation, they didn't
[1:45:58] want, you know, they were willing to
[1:45:59] sacrifice their life. I'm going to read
[1:46:02] this. First Kings 21 to Ahab spake unto
[1:46:07] Nabbath. How many of us know Nabboth?
[1:46:08] That's right. Saying, "Give me that
[1:46:10] vineyard that I may have it for a garden
[1:46:14] of herbs, because it is near unto my
[1:46:16] house, I will give thee, and for a
[1:46:18] vineyard and eat it. If it seems good to
[1:46:21] thee, I will give thee the worth of
[1:46:23] money." Right? This man called Nab stood
[1:46:27] up. He said, "No." Never said unto him,
[1:46:32] the Lord forbid to
[1:46:35] me that the Lord forbid me that I should
[1:46:41] give the inheritance of my father unto
[1:46:44] thee. Amen. I'm not going to give my
[1:46:48] inheritance. This is mine. Amen. I know
[1:46:52] why my father has suffered for this. I'm
[1:46:54] not going to give it away. Amen. Even if
[1:46:56] you're the king, even if you give me
[1:46:58] money, I'm not going to give up. Amen.
[1:47:02] You have an inheritance.
[1:47:05] Amen. Let me just say this thing.
[1:47:09] For the sisters and the brothers, you
[1:47:11] have an inheritance. Your own body,
[1:47:13] right?
[1:47:15] What is happening outside? Let me just
[1:47:17] say this. Barry, please. Excuse me.
[1:47:20] Sisters, you still have to keep
[1:47:21] yourself. the young ones.
[1:47:24] There's a lot going on. You must keep.
[1:47:27] It's your inheritance.
[1:47:30] It's precious. It's something that you
[1:47:32] don't play with it. Amen. Even us
[1:47:35] brothers, you you have to keep it. God's
[1:47:38] with Are you sleeping? You know, it's
[1:47:40] our inheritance. I don't want anybody to
[1:47:43] The reason I did is that we don't have
[1:47:45] to sleep because it's our inheritance.
[1:47:47] It belongs to us. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:52] Our children, the Bible says
[1:47:56] here, our low children are an
[1:47:59] inheritance of the Lord. And the foot of
[1:48:01] the womb is his reward. As arrows in the
[1:48:06] hands of a mighty man, so are the
[1:48:08] children of your youth.
[1:48:11] You have to understand that your
[1:48:13] children are your inheritance.
[1:48:16] Amen. You see your inheritance. You
[1:48:19] don't play with your inheritance.
[1:48:22] So when God Can you just imagine how
[1:48:24] many children die every day?
[1:48:28] But God give you a child. Amen. It's
[1:48:31] your inheritance to protect it. God
[1:48:34] gives you a church, it's an inheritance.
[1:48:36] He give you a good pastor, it's an
[1:48:38] inheritance. He give you a good wife, a
[1:48:40] good husband, it's an inheritance. You
[1:48:42] have to keep it. You said stand up that
[1:48:45] day like Nabbath. You said no. God
[1:48:48] forbid it to me that will forsake, I
[1:48:50] will reject, that will give away my
[1:48:52] inheritance. It belongs to me. I fought
[1:48:54] for it. You know, I waited 25 years
[1:48:57] before I get married. You know, it's
[1:48:59] your when you get married, it's your
[1:49:00] inheritance. You don't you don't give it
[1:49:02] to somebody else.

[1:49:07] trying to close up here. You know,
[1:49:09] enticing spirit. Brother Benham says
[1:49:11] this. Brother Benham says this. and
[1:49:14] testing spirit says, "Give me a
[1:49:16] preacher. Give me a Christian. Give me a
[1:49:21] housewife that is a Christian." That's
[1:49:23] right. Give me a farmer, a factory
[1:49:27] worker that will put God first in
[1:49:30] everything. I will show you a man will
[1:49:33] be successful in spite of all the devil
[1:49:37] can put on him.
[1:49:40] Amen. Hey, you see it's even housewife.
[1:49:44] Yeah. Amen.
[1:49:47] You know your your stand for the word.

[1:49:52] standing all night just praying as a
[1:49:54] mother. It will be rewarded publicly.
[1:49:58] It's when people look at your children
[1:50:00] and say, "Oh, what had happened?" Yeah.
[1:50:03] Why are they different? Yeah. Is because
[1:50:06] of your labor in secret.
[1:50:08] Auntie Wright had a burden for her
[1:50:10] children in secret. But one day she
[1:50:13] spoke the right thing. Thank you Lord.
[1:50:15] Praise the Lord. She says this is
[1:50:18] nothing but the truth. And brother I'm

[1:50:23] if you need the healing of your sister,
[1:50:25] just ask it shall be given to you. She
[1:50:28] looked back. She said, "No, I've been
[1:50:30] having this this burden for my
[1:50:31] children." She says, "Please Lord, give
[1:50:34] me the the salvation of my two boys. Oh,
[1:50:36] we have mothers that can also stand like
[1:50:39] right and claim the children.
