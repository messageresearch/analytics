and even the needs for our loved ones in relations so God we bring it to the foot of the cross this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat yeah I knew this there is this uh song that been playing on my head we we uh we sank it on Wednesday night uh there is room at the cross amen uh we sank it Wednesday night as we were opening the service and again I wanted to also uh uh announce Wednesday night we had a prayer meeting because I got a I got an aent text from a brother I think I said it uh uh during the service and it was for a minister brother uh uh in the Colorado area that was uh pretty much on life support uh and uh uh in the state of colan so uh when the brother sent me the voicemail he sent it to me in around uh maybe around 12: or 1:00 a.m. in the morning and uh uh it was it was his son that wanted us to pray urgently so that was what I took uh the Wednesday night to be able to bring their prayer requests and and and different other needs that we pray for uh uh but then they pleased the Lord for the dear brother Toko to go to be with the Lord amen so uh uh he passed uh I think the next morning and uh uh uh his uh uh son testified in the text that uh that I read that uh uh he had such a smile on his face uh he was smiling as if if uh whether he was seeing something or there but he had such a smile on his face and uh that was the last expression that he had but he went to be with the Lord amen and we thank the Lord for that praise the Lord amen if there is any other thing that comes to my mind we'll talk about it later amen but we want to thank the Lord and U uh brother Kenneth from New Jersey uh uh send his greetings and his family uh we we were with them last uh Sunday we spoke for them there in in New Jersey I've been noring B Kenne for many years uh I actually got in contact with him when there was uh uh a hurricane in the Philadelphia area so I was just calling to see if any of the Believers were affected by that that's how we got in contact but then uh we've been talking on the phone so anytime uh any of the the brothers are flying through nework I will always give them brother Kenneth number either brother Kenneth or brother Phillip will pick them up so uh he have come to know many of the brothers uh by just by just phone contact so last weekend was the first time we met so uh uh we met and we had to do some catching up so we talk and talk until into the morning and uh I had brother Valentine with me and he says well you people are having question and anwers section let me leave you he left us and went to bed we talk and then uh after the service we went home with him also we spend spend some time in his house that night in his house and then the next day we left so he wanted us to bring his greetings also to the church amen they have a they have a good mixed group there on there uh um yeah few of the few of the saints that we we knew and never and didn't know that there was where went to church we were able to see them also now this morning I want to I want to speak on something that I pray that uh the Lord will will uh make a blessing to you amen it's uh it's it's it's been a blessing to me and I pray that the Lord Lord will make it a blessing to you title it Revelation chapter 4 that's the title after this door open in heaven that's what Revelation chapter 4 says after this I look and behold a door was opened in heaven so I'm titling this after this and a door open in heaven praise the Lord and then I ask a question what is this what is what is this after this a door open what is this what what actually it is praise the Lord what actually it is now if you if if we stay in context with the scripture after this is speaking about after the church ages because this is Revelation chapter of four praise the Lord are we together so we have just come out of the church ages so John is saying after this after what after the church ages are we together amen do you see the picture praise the Lord if we read something from Feast of the trumpet and uh uh if we read something from Feast of the trumpet you will you will see this and uh uh Feast of the trumpet this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ there The Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation opens in verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ that's how the book open so it's is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven seal had the mystery head of what it all was and is supposed to open in the last day at the laition age at the end time thank be to God that finishes the message to the church so after the laish age the message to the church is finished but time has not finished yet that finished the message to the church that finishes it when they look back when they look back and see what has been and see where it all brought up to that finishes it the age of the church now I put this little quot here because after this make us to look back for us to be able to identify where we are as we look into what we want to look into this morning John said after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven so yeah brother bam is saying there the you know after the laisha age it brings an end to the church ages he says uh uh an an end of time thank be to God that finishes the message to the church when they look back and see what has been look back and see what has been in the church ages what God has been doing in in the church ages and that's exactly what we are doing when we when we talk about the book of Acts we are looking back to see what God did in that church ages when we talk about the time of Luther we are looking back to see what God did we talk about the time of the reformers we are looking back amen and then when we look back and see what God did in their Church age it gave us an idea of what he's doing now amen are we together praise the Lord so John says uh after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven what is that Josh how are you I didn't see you boy you really follow your name we were just talking about you yesterday I was telling you there you're not picking my phone call so let me just say let me just tell you immediately what I was saying let me just let you know the gossip praise the Lord but good to see you boy good to see you amen with treasure I was I was having some talk with the deacons yesterday and uh uh it was supposed to be an hour meeting we end up with almost 6 hours praise the lord we end up almost 6 hours and uh uh as soon as we we were done I was supposed to stay to study a little bit I was so hungry I just packed my box and went home I called my wife I said is there any food she said I just F soup I said okay I'm on my way because uh praise the Lord but it was it was just a good time uh uh you know with uh with the deacons and and uh and one of the things we would we also talk about is in a sense of uh uh talking with uh about uh you know our growth I might I might approach some of that next week uh uh also kind of for looking for the time uh where we can uh have a church meeting and we have not had one for for the long time but uh we might plan to have one and just to bring ourself up to date you know I was telling the deacons I says uh uh you know when you when you when you read the Bible you think about a church could see you saying I just read your text message to the church thanking God for your daughter so and uh we pray that God will you talk you talk about the church you realize that we are people from different backgrounds different upbringings many of us from different churches we come together as a the body and uh we have a word the word of God is our standard and it's just like the Bible you read the Bible you read verses in the Bible and sometimes just one verse in the Bible can hold the life of an entire person praise the Lord just one verse in the Bible can hold the life of an entire person the Bible talks about John being at River Jordan and saw Jesus coming but it was not just joining Jesus there were a lot of people at the River Jordan amen before he got to the River Jordan there was something he did in the morning before Jesus left to come to John he came uh uh uh uh he came from somewhere you see so and and that is the same with with us we come together as a body as a church and and uh uh uh realizing what the word of God says we put expectation on ourself and and then uh as we go together you know we we Tred our best to keep the church by the word of God we try to do everything to keep a stander of the word of God and uh we try to you know not to get ourself uh engaged into things and uh living wrong and and FES and fights and all of that but you see it's it's just like our our our own life you know we all grow up and we have we have different Corners you know different changes you know I always love this this uh uh scripture uh David said in the sign except the Lord build the house the Builder worketh in vain I love it because for for a family and uh and and and also for the church God is building a house amen and and and that is the beautiful thing that is there is because God is building a house and every one of us we are just a stone in his hands we are just a break in their house and the beautiful thing about building a house is there uh you need a designer praise the Lord because you want you want your living room setting space you want your bedroom setting space you want a curve you don't want people to come right in the house and see you in the kitchen so put the kitchen this way T the break this way so you see that's it we have different turns that we have to turn when we are building the family it's easy if you are building a fence you just run it straight down the road just run it you know along the line but if you are building the house you got to turn the corner so we turn different Corners uh uh uh in our own family we turn different Corners as we grow together in the church we turn different Corners you know uh uh we dedicate babies when they were born and then when they get to an age of uh of uh showing a good conscience towards God we we baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh you know uh for the few that we did baptized here in this church they're going to grow up and the set turning in uh turning of Corner in their life they will stray they will do things they will go away from church it's all part of growth praise the lord we have this sin L perfection in our mind and uh and and pretty soon it brings our faith into question when we start to experience those things praise the Lord but it's all part of our growth just like we dedicate babies if the Lord T it we're going to lay some to the Grave praise the Lord just the same as we bless marriages if the Lord T some will make some decisions and they may not continue it's it's all part of life it's not what we want it's not what is not the standard but sometimes people make choices are we together amen and I I say that to say is there I'm completely of of my note here Josh you don't want put me into that because I was trying to talk to the deacons and you know and and make them to to see their to me to me it's a sound of growth you might not see it as a sign of growth but I see it as a sign of growth praise the Lord amen I remember a good friend of mine it was a son that got married last week when I was gone and and uh uh there was a time where uh there were bunch of college students that was that were flooding into the church young people you know uh all of these guys they were all University student they stay up all night steuding you know uh they came to the message and these boys were steuding you know it came a certain time they started asking questions they were just pouring questions man challenging things you were preaching you have to go go back and and study your notes you know they were challenging and the pastor came to me my good friend he came to me and he says he said brother one what's going on you know what's what's happening I told him I says well it's growth he said what can I for growth these boys have becoming rebellious you say growth I say it's growth there is one time in life where you tell them to do they will do another time they will ask you why a sound of growth praise the Lord amen amen if you want to grow with us just s stick stick close praise the Lord let's get into what we want to talk about so uh uh uh we looking at this Revelation chapter 4 and John says after this we identify there that was the church edges I want to identify this open door he says after this look and behold a open a door was opened in heaven now in our natural mind is easy uh for you to see it like a vision you know you having a dream and the door just swing wide open but I want for us to study a little bit amen take your Bibles let's just go along let's look at uh St John chapter 10 St John chapter 10 praise the Lord now St John chapter 10 St John chapter 10 let's read from verse 6 this Parable speak Jesus unto them but but they understood they understood not what think they uh this Parable speak Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he speak unto them there St John chapter 10 am I reading from St John chapter 10 verse 7 then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I said unto you I am the door of the sheep G Jesus here identifying himself as the door all that came all that ever came before me are teeths and rubber but the Sheep did not hear them verse 9 I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture The Book of Revelation is what I just said it The Book of Revelation is what the revelation of Jesus Christ praise the Lord the revelation of Jesus Christ so we have to pay attention to that that most things in everything in the Book of Revelations identify Jesus in one way what he's doing in his church are we together now so we see here in uh uh St John chapter 10 that he's identifying himself that I am the door to the sheep for amen so if he is the door to the sheep for follow me now and you you'll grab the picture of where we are getting here and John is saying I see a a door open then we realize there that uh this Open Door is a further revelation of Jesus Christ it's an opening of Jesus Christ it's an understanding of Jesus Christ do you grab the picture amen okay further Revelation just keep that in the back of your mind I will come to it let's uh let's look at this you look in Genesis chapter 7 you realize we will not read that I would just only emphasize you realize that there was an open door for seven days the ACT door was open amen amen praise the Lord for seven days God had the ACT door open before he finally shut it and then the rain came down keep that in the back of your mind also let's take our Bibles again and look at Acts Chapter 14 verse 27 acts chap 14: 27 Acts Chapter 14 verse 27 Acts Chapter 14 verse 27 we we just pick up some few verses here and that will give us an idea of what we want to look into verse 27 here it says and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearse all that God has done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith onto the Gentiles praise the Lord so yes Peter the coming now to this uh uh uh Council uh uh in Jerusalem and now Peter is going to he he's going to testify he's coming from kena's house what God has done there and now he's saying God has given them an Open Door of Faith so we know it's not a natural door God have given them an access amen God have given them an opportunity to take the gospel to the Gentiles so it's an Open Door amen praise the Lord so an Open Door in heaven is not an natural door it's not a natural door Jesus is the door are we together 1 Corinthians chapter 16 1 Corinthians chapter 16 1 Corinthians chapter 16:9 1 Corinthians chapter 16:9 I think the young people back there said if more faster than me for a great door and if an effectual is open unto me and there are many adversary now Paul testifying here that a great door and and and this this great door that he's talking about also also is an Avenue to take the gospel amen and having you to take the gospel 2 Corinthians chapter 2:12 furthermore when I came to trust to preach Christ's gospel at door was open unto me of the Lord so it's the same thing he had an Avenue there were places that he went and he never had an Open Door they chase him out of the synagogues they ran him out of the city but uh uh he's testifying here that God did give him an open door to preach the gospel are we together collu let's take this one and then we go now into our subject just trying to use there to lay the background here and give you an idea collusion the book of collusion chapter 4 verse3 amen amen but are praying also for us that God will open unto us a door of utterance is the same thing give giving us an open door so we can share the gospel amen amen we're looking for an open door so we can share the gospel and I will I will share some things with you uh I I feel the same here uh I feel the same been looking for an open door and uh uh uh we we we do that uh you know uh sometimes we want to just keep setting things in prayer but we've been we've been kind of for looking for open doors to see whether we could be able to share the word with uh with some communities that are around the city I'll will leave it as that and we just pray that ask that you pray for us that God will give us an Open Door amen now so we when you when you see this now uh we just use those verses to be able to create the picture John saw an Open Door in a vision is described as an open door but then we going to see what that open door is he says a door open in heaven and We Know that heaven from the fourth seal Heaven is consist of the word praise the Lorden amen Heaven is consist of the word now so uh so an Open Door in heaven will be a further revelation of Jesus Christ a further Revelation now I would just show you it right there in uh in uh uh Revelation chapter 4 let's go back to Revelation chapter 4 I show you as as we go after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and and the and the first verse which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to me how can a trumpet be talking amen a trumpet supposed to be making sound but this one the trumpet was talking so right here it make us to know that this trumpet was a gospel trumpet amen amen it was a gospel trumpet which said the trumpet said unto me come up hither and I will show I will show thee things which must be year after so things which must happen after the church ages after this is the church ages but the trumpet is saying come up come up which of course is calling to us for spiritual growth amen amen praise the Lorden it's coming to us for spiritual growth you see God cannot give us any more in his word if we are not doing much with what we have God can't give you Revelation that's why Jesus said he can't cast his uh peace before swam God cannot give you precious things if you are not doing well with what you have are we together so it's a call it's a call stepping out of the church a stepping out of just the place of being the church member stepping out of the place of just being complacent with our Sunday service and the Wednesday service no stepping up let's come up higher amen amen amen amen are we together let's come up higher is a place where we can tear ourself the truth in love amen are we together so he's calling us to a higher form of relationship a higher form of commitment higher form of devotion now immediately I was in the spirit and behold oh a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now you will see this is where it it help us to see that is a further revelation of Jesus Christ because here is going to explain the godhead the Bible says there was a throne one throne and one sat in heaven so there is no room for the teaching of Father Son and the Holy Ghost because there is just one throne and one sat upon the throne and this one that sat upon the throne is going to be looked at as the Jasper and and and SN Stones which is uh jaspa that's the 12 Stones and and it means the Alpha and Omega it means the beginning and the end is he's the one sitting on the throne so a a farther another revelation of Jesus Christ we're going to see it in in in Revelation Chapter 2 and 3 the church edges we saw Jesus in the midst of the can stake he identified himself in the midst of the church now we are at another level now where he's going to identify himself on the throne amen amen are we together amen are we together praise the Lord so we see this is a open door there is a uh uh uh an access has been given to us this is an opportunity just like the door of the Ark was open it was open for those that wanted to go in Praise the Lord hallelujah Moses I mean Noah responsibility was to preach the message he was not weeping the animal in neither were he told to whip the people in are we together we can whip you in that's what I'm going to that's what I'm want to say we can whip you in it's not righteousness to whip you in you have to grab it see the importance and step into it amen that's the only way it's going to be a blessing to you a window of opportunity if we can call it like that we always say a window I got a window of opportunity you hear people say just step inside just step in the company step your foot through the door they are not telling you say open this door and go outside they telling you say just the opportunity that is there step in it amen that's what is happening glory be to God a little bit uh so and and and and and and that is the way it is that's the way that God deals with us just like how John we will deal with John's subject but just like how John is seeing an open door here and and and and uh and and the trumpet is calling him come up higher John step out of the church Ages come and let me show you things after after the church ages let me show you things things that you're going to step into things that you're going to Marvel at things that are going to be so wonderful amen praise the Lord there is more to Christian life than don't lie don't steal don't fornicate don't fight there is more to Christian life than that this Bible is so filled with uh a bountiful of riches mystery things that we can learn amen praise the Lord amen the guy that wrote that that bill the the the the compass he was a a US Navy officer they have the the Navy they have a a plaque there in honor of him that buil the compass for for seed that he used for seed he was reading his Bible a verse struck him praise the Lord it was a verse in the Bible that struck him and being the Navy officer being trained to observe on the sea that verse Inspire him to build a compass how to travel on the sea praise the Lord amen there are a lot of things in the word M that we can talk about praise the Lord amen then it's it's almost like every Serv we got to be fighting with people it looks like it look like they were talking to me today or they were talking to somebody today we have to be enjoying the word amen but you see that's the way that God does it he won't give us anymore he won't take us to the next level if our mind and heart is not conditioned to move on with him if we are still playing around and you know uh uh controlled by habits and different things I mean the preaching of the Gospel will just become intellectual we just come and tell you stories and Fascinate your mind but we're not really moving in the spirit to the next level until we are rightly using what is in our hands the the the the truth that we know we have to put it to use amen Paul says we must exercise ourself in the truth that's what he said we must exercise ourself said that in the book of Hebrew let's let's move on here let's move on you see that's that's what happened that's what happened you are you are you are so inspired to bring something but you you still feed the P you stay feel the pool you stay feel things pulling you back to to talk about all of these things amen amen Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 let's go back in Revelation chapter 3 there's another open door we want to identify Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 uh is that verse 20 no Revelation CH 3:8 Revelation CH 3:8 Revelation chapter 3:8 I know th Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou have a little strength and have kept my word and have not denied my name praise the Lord amen amen th H have kept my word and have not denied my name now you have to realize that this is the Philadelphia Church age amen the age of Brotherly Love praise the Lord amen this is the age of the great reformers so God is saying here that uh uh I've set before you an Open Door what was this open door this open door was the door that Martin Luther stepped in I mean lter of the of the uh the reformer lther this was the door that he stepped in to defy catalyzing when he when he nailed the thesis on the door it was the door that he it was that open door that he stepped in because this was all under the Philadelphia Church age this was the age of great reformers this was called the missionary age it was that open door that was open that's why John Wesley John H H uh smade and all of these gu cells they were all running around the coast they they would just get on the next ship they want to take the gospel to this place they want to get on it I mean that's it was this open door now see what the Bible says the Bible says that uh uh for thou have a little strength this is God's word but that little strength was anointing men in different parts of the word to take the gospel amen some of them were were having insight into the word they were writing book and and and and Charles pin and and and uh uh uh uh John G leges and all of these guys they were all operating on this verse they were all operating under this anointing and Open Door see another thing there let's identify the Bible says you have a little strength and have kept my word and have not denied my name what was happening here the name of Jesus was returning back in baptism okay good you see the name of Jesus Christ because why in the Dark Ages it was killed and and and calm introduced the church to Father Son and the Holy Ghost yeah are we together but you see here God has has has has promised God had had an anointing that will restore that will bring back the name of Jesus back in the church amen amen amen thank you Lord amen are we together amen amen amen so you see there was an open door and this open door was an opportunity that all these great reformers use to carry the gospel out amen the the the move of of Luther out of the the the the Catholic Church remember he was a priest his move out of the Catholic Church uh weaken the grape of the king over the church praise the Lord because at that time the church and the and and and the and the state was one they were they were preaching what the king wanted them to preach but when when they make their move God gave them an open door now think about it now we're talking about history we're talking about church history and things that God did in the ages but as long as Mercy is stay with us the mercy of God Is An Open Door to you every day of your life when God gave you his Mercy he has opened door for you to step out and become better am are we together we are talking about church history we talking about our uh uh uh uh further Revelation progressive revelation I mean all of those things I mean yeah that's that's what we are talking about but uh we we we we I don't want to Hank you in the air I don't want to lost you I want to bring the word down to you amen amen we have to take it and apply it to ourself if God would give an age take the church out of persecution death and gave the age an open door for people to come back to a fresh breath of Truth praise the Lord amen he would do the same for every one of us praise the Lord amen whenever you think about the mercy of God that's what the mercy of God is his mercy endureth forever he always give you an Open Door praise the Lord for you to step out of horri situation am and become better praise the Lord amen so you see here we identified uh St John chapter 10 Jesus says I am the door amen we see how he's he's giving the people for an Open Door well Revelation chap 10 Revelation 3:2 let's read it behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will soup with him and he with me praise the Lord are we together amen now over the period of time that verse which of course is is is a personal application behold I stand at the door and knock he's knocking at our heart door that is the personal application but it also represent the age amen because Philadelphia age he gave them an open door to come out of the the the the the system and uh uh uh come out and with that little strength and now here he standing at the door praise the Lord and this this is the Lish age he's standing at the church door Christ you have to remember he was kicked out of the church amen he was kicked out of the church the the they brought in all Jupiters and and and all their idols and give them Christian names and and burn candles to them a lot of Celebration even even our Easter and Christmas they are all out of uh uh Roman idolatry and all of those things were introduced to the church Christ was completely kicked out of the church amen why because Rome knows that knows that Israel had a Commandment that yeah oh Israel the Lord our God is only one God and thou should not worship any graving image so they knew that the Jews Will Never B bow down to worship their Nero or their Caesar or none of their governor they knew that the Jews would never do that praise the Lord and this new faith that is born under Judaism that is now called Christian that is giving lot of allegiance to This Man Called Jesus they knew that Christians also will not bow down to worship their Idols praise the Lord so all they have to do is to just be part of it and that's how Constantine came he wanted to go for the wall he asked the church to pray for him he came in and and decid to become uh h h a part of the church but he was not converted praise the Lord and he used his Roman Authority and slowly started turning the church away from Christ to Caesar praise the Lord so Christ was kicked out of the church now so here Lish Revelation 10:20 is introducing us to a period of time where Christ is coming back into his church amen amen the fullness of the word is coming back into the church but the church has to let it in in amen amen praise the Lord he said behold I stand at the door and knock praise the Lorden so he started knocking at the church door how was he knocking at the church door by ausa Street sending the gifts back to the church amen amen knocking the church door but they did not let him in they call a ISM so you know what happened at the very time this scripture was fulfilling and the church refused to let it in then Revelation 18:4 also Echo come out of all my people so Revelation 18:4 by prophecy happened at this very very time come out of for my people and don't be partaker of a sin are we together that's all church history read the church age book you you understand that now so H uh I mean I mean I mean those things are done I'm I'm I'm just I'm just you know hanging around here just because we are looking at this open door so we see here that uh uh uh uh we have used all of this to establish with you that the open door was a further Revelation a further understanding a further revealing of Christ they are more things that he was going to reveal to the church are we together amen let me let me share something with you here and uh maybe that would give you a little a little bit of anchor in what we are looking at I'm very well sure I won't be able to get through all this today but uh uh the call is to come up higher amen is to come up higher I believe that is the spirit call to the believer amen God is expecting us to come up above you know uh uh where we are you know there's one thing that God do that uh uh love for his people is uh complacency amen When the People starts to become uh complacent and you know and uh uh complacent said it's a little sense of backsliding you know and and that's why the mama ego will tear the net she will destroy the net because she want her babies to exercise their wings amen and not to get too comfortable with the net she want them to exercise their wi and also identify the abilities that God has given them as Eagles amen for them to be able to identify the abilities that God and and God has given us abilities as his sons and daughters praise the Lorden yeah we have abilities to to De with our own habits we have ability to overcome he that overcome praise praise the Lord amen we have abilities to put our foot down we can plant a Cornerstone amen and say from this day you devil it starts right here it's in you it's in you God give it to you all of those things comes with a new birth amen unless you are not born again if you are born again it's in you maybe you just need to change your diet right thank you Lord amen amen men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God Amen let's just read something here from the lishia church age we'll try to to let you go and then uh we'll find another time to to continue praise the Lord unless you tell me to continue I don't have problem continuing yeah Lisha Church age year here is Jehovah of the Old Testament the god of the amen amen amen here is Jehovah of the Old Testament here is Jesus of the New Testament the god of the amen praise the Lord amen yeah oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God there it is again the Jehovah of the Old Testament is J Jesus of the new here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God the New Testament does not reveal another God different from the old okay the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further Revelation amen of the one one and same God praise the Lord so God above us that was the Old Testament God above us he led them in the form of the pillow of fire and the pillow of cloud praise the Lord amen we with the New Testament Jesus the God that was above in the pillow of fire and the pillar of cloud dwell in that body so it's just a further Revelation amen it's just a further Revelation so the fullness of the godhead was in Christ bodally are we together amen so it was a further Revelation that's the concept I wanted I want you to grab Christ did not come to me make himself known he did come to reveal the son he he he came to reveal and make known the father he always said it's not me that do this but the father praise the Lord amen if you don't believe me believe the works what was he trying to do to help the people to see a further revelation of God Amen you believe in God now believe in me the god that L your father you believe him the pillar of fire the one that open the Red Sea the one that walk upon water in the beginning he said but now believe in me it's not yet believing God and believe in me no he was trying to get their attention so they can see a further revelation of God that's right praise the Lord amen why because he was going to bring them into things yes that's why he told them in Matthew chapter 4 you have heard chapter 5 you know you have heard that that I mean thou shall not kill that was the Old Testament but now I said if you even think evil against your brother without a CA thou shall not commit adultery he said if you even lost a the woman why he was bringing them through an Open Door amen he was bringing them through to another step amen praise the Lord amen I mean that's the way we all that have grown we we have all come through that you know I was thinking about that the last time and I I I was driving I was just thinking about it you know uh uh even uh they little the lest one yet Among Us who is that let's let's take uh uh uh Karen no Olivia yeah we we love her but not her now I mean the one that can talk and and tell her says you are a baby she said no I'm not a baby and tell redeem that you are a baby she would say no I'm not a baby now but a one that is older than her will still see her as a baby no you are a baby say no I'm not a baby praise the Lord what am I saying is that uh uh wherever level we are we can be able to identify that growth to us it's a growth the little child is saying she's not a baby because she knows she's not sucking uh uh you know uh mil and uh you know so so that's so that's why she saying I'm not a baby I'm not a baby but you're the older one you can see that she's a baby she needs to what grow up amen so okay you say you are not a baby stop doing this well you say there to be able to challenge her growth right you say there to be able to help her to identify that when I say you are a baby it's because you you are still doing this praise the Lord and that is the same way with every one of us we need to grow up but at the place where we are there is some sense of contentment where we feel like we we are grown I mean you need to grow up I mean what do you mean what you mean I need to grow up what do you mean I need to grow up I have my own house are you paying my renten praise the Lord I mean that's that that is the action that is the way you can think in your mind praise the Lord but you see the voice that is talking to John is coming from above and if that voice from above is telling you to grow a means you come and meet me if you think you have grown come into the heavens we together and sometimes that is that is the thing with us in our own individual work praise the Lord amen that is the thing with us in our own individual work if we it's almost like couple of weeks ago we were talking about uh uh the tree of light evening from the Tree of light Moses said right there if I read these things to you this curs is to you and you say in your heart that it do not pertain to me he says you are you are drinking with the drunken and uh uh so it is it is this place where sometimes it is it is the toughest thing and the more hard thing you know uh uh to be able to instruct somebody that has the question to everything you know it's hard to have a conversation with someone like that you know that has the answer to everything and also it's is it's it's difficult because you are not being fair to yourself you are not giving yourself an opportunity to learn praise the Lord amen you are not giving yourself you might even know it you might even know it better than I can explain it but maybe my explanation will give you another way to look at that think praise the Lord amen so even when a child is telling you something allow them to talk allow them let them explain let them explain how they can do it and join them into the joy of their explanation praise the Lord if you don't get anything from there you might enjoy a little childishness if you don't get anything from what the child have said you might enjoy a little childishness praise the Lord now so we looking at this uh open door here want to take you into another another curve now but uh if I start that it will be it it will be hard for us to to close there but I just I just uh uh Ephesian chapter Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians chapter three I I'll close my notes for now um looking at the whole lot let me let me see I can use this and just find a place to close here praise the Lord amen uh praise the Lord I'm laughing because uh I have a brother a pastor friend that do follow our service he might he might be following us and uh you always you always get after me when he call me say brother it was it was a good talk but you kept the people too long so so we were out last week in uh in New Jersey with brother Valentine he and brother Valentine over in North Carolina so uh uh uh I heard the pastor was you know trying he was making some emphasis talking about marriage and different things and you know making the emphasis you know we we are the message of the hour the the message of the hour so when I came on the ppit I says well I'm going to preach the message of the hour then they didn't grab what I was saying but I meant I was going to stay in an hour so so uh so as as we went as we went ahead you know I kept I kept emphasizing you believe the message of the hour everybody say amen I okay I try to preach the message of the hour you know and I I I tried and uh uh it's hard to stay in an hour I went a little over an hour because I was preaching with an interpreter so I told them he take one hour I take one hour so then after the service you know the brother called he was talking with the other brother how the service oh yeah you know yeah brother wanton preach and was he says how long did he preach no he's still out okay tell him he's doing well you know we good friends we we we we enjoy teasing one another we enjoy Ephesians chapter 1 let's look in Ephesians chapter 1 let me let me use this in close I'm I'm I'm all over the place I can't keep still Ephesians chapter 1 let's read verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places now you see John there was told to come up higher why because it's the believer's position now Paul here is telling us that our blessing is in Heavenly places our blessing is not so much in you know how much we can be able to labor to do but our blessing is so much in our spiritual position am our spiritual position there was no way on Earth the heavens that Joseph will have ever been a prime minister of Egypt until he form his spiritual position and what was his spiritual position he had to be sold into Egypt yes he had to go to praise him to find his way to the throne that's righten so you see his Blessing of being a prime minister came from his physical position his spiritual position physically it was not looking nice it was not looking beautiful that her own Brothers will will sell him but spiritually he came to understand that you made it for evil but God made it for good you see so our blessing is in our spiritual position amen he has blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Ephesians chapter 6 this is a common one if you've been around this church a long time you might have heard me saying this praise the Lord or if you want me to be a preacher of the message of the hour you really got to get down to Serious fasting and praying because I'm a believer I'm not yet converted dear amen I believe it but I'm not yet converted earnest earnest confession is good for the soul I'm a Believer but I'm not yet converted so if you want one hour you got to get down to fasting and praying you ready got to pray say Lord change that man are we together now let's let's let's look right here Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wise of the devil for We rise up not against flesh and blood but against principality against against power against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that word high places is the same as Heavenly places so you see word your blessing is is where your battle is the enemy attack your spiritual position because he knows when you take that place with Christ Heaven is your God Amen Heaven is open so he fights you not to take their place God says I give you all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places but he also says your spiritual wickedness in high places praise the Lord amen so you see it when John was C called to come up higher is because he was going to step into a further Revelation a splendor Revelation Revelation chapter 4 right after that comes the opening of the book think about that I'll give you an example and I close here if I can close I'll close you praise the Lord if I can close I will close you I told the I told the people last week I says please learn to eat a little thing before coming to church praise the Lord amen don't don't don't don't blast your stomach you will sleep just get something you know just to keep your blood going and uh some it keeps you awake because I mean one of these days the the Holy Ghost will fall and we will not leave I mean those that we want to leave will leave I mean when when that presence fall we will want to enjoy it you know it robs us of being time conscious so you have to come prepared you know snack on a little thing and come you know it's good it's good now so think about this you read the book of Isaiah go home and just read the first fiveth chapter in the book of Isaiah see how his messages were he was talking to the people of Israel you know and but Isaiah chapter 6 was word he had that visitation of the Angel when yuah died and he went into the temple and the Bible says uh you know he broke into a vision and you know he saw the sarapin and and know he cried and confessed his sin and then God came and touched his life look at chapter 7 from right then on his ministry changed he's no longer into talking about Israel politics he's talking about a virgin shall conceive he's looking at 700 years and he's prophesying why because the experience in the temple Has Lifted him up he's being lifted out of the politics and he's talking about a virgin shall conceive and as he goes on he talks about the mesiah he talks about the Millennium that's what happen when the believer come up higher yes when we step out of our complaints and argument and you know and and fusses and excuses and just and just step up a little bit the platform change you start to see things different yes and the things that were problem to you becomes nonsense is it because of this nonsense I was doing all of this your eye open you start to see things different why because you have stepped up a little bit just like I said well some water some other thing we force out of tets squeeze the tets pr you you brush your teeth you didn't even wash the sink the Lord bless you musicians you can come let me start [Applause] right praise the Lord amen but think about it think about it how many time we pass the open doors that are set before us yes how many times God put an Open Door and we pass by it an open door to testify to somebody and we pass by it an open door to help somebody and we pass by it amen how many times we instead of stepping in the door we snap it close because we we become so particular about ourself someone gave thems for you to be here and if you give yourself you could help not only yourself you could help others let's bow our heads together let's try that chorus again of that song now R by the cross I was I was driving in I was listening to something and I can't remember what was there but that song just caught my heart and I think about it and to realize that we all have a room at the cross the the room at the cross or the cross have a room with an Open Door there is no way that you go to the cross and you will not find Mercy there is no way you go to the cross and the door will ever be shut [Music] when we talk about an Open Door the cross has an open [Music] door there's room at the cross for me today there is Rome at the cross for you my friend do milon has come there is stay room for one there is RO at the cross for [Music] you oh yes there is RO for you my friend there is
