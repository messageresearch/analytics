[22:51] fish a very short time just ago I might
[22:55] not be so much emotion today of shutting
[22:59] here and there because I trust I just
[23:02] want to kind of make you to understand
[23:06] what I were preaching at last I was here
[23:07] I didn't finished I'm messy because
[23:10] there was no time so there's there's a
[23:14] major part of the message that I wanted
[23:17] you to see and I pray that God gave me
[23:19] grace tonight so you can see that and I
[23:21] trust that each and every one of us this
[23:23] morning you know and what better one
[23:25] were preaching this morning you know I
[23:26] was standing back in Alaska on Friday
[23:28] and I was thinking as a lawyer if I go
[23:30] down to Minnesota why you want me to
[23:31] just encourage these things you know and
[23:34] he kind of the Holy Spirit kind of bring
[23:36] it in a different way but as we go
[23:39] through you'll be able to see what I'm
[23:41] talking about but those of you who
[23:42] really get a spiritual understanding
[23:44] you'll be able to see exactly what I'm
[23:46] talking about because we're live in such
[23:48] an age but we need a revolution I would
[23:55] say that again we are live in social age
[23:57] we need revelation if you don't have
[24:02] revelation you will leave this messy
[24:06] I'm telling you seriously this is 2020 I
[24:13] was telling the church in Alaska butter
[24:19] brown said I will come in to read the
[24:21] world amen I'm just gonna talk to you
[24:23] tonight but Brown said when you preach
[24:25] the message alone he said that two
[24:27] things are happy in every year I don't
[24:29] know if you know that you say every year
[24:31] that comes two major thing happening you
[24:35] see the world were in greater darkness
[24:38] and in the light so if you're not
[24:42] working the lag you are going to work in
[24:44] a greater chaos so though like last year
[24:49] 2019 the killing the rib day the evil
[24:54] that took place gonna multiply more this
[24:56] year because they are already photo by a
[24:58] profit so if you don't work in the lag
[25:02] you're walking pretty badly so brother
[25:06] God need to give up grace I trust that
[25:09] glory happy this man just a short
[25:10] association definitely for a bridge am i
[25:12] nothing table you will see what I'm
[25:14] getting and then we'll leave it open the
[25:15] game for and other time we can't press
[25:17] the law now in John chapter 14 verse 12
[25:19] this into what Jesus a yes it's a very
[25:22] familiar scripture on the tangle of a
[25:26] better one you know it's a very humble
[25:28] brother I've been knowing for a very
[25:29] long time and always coming yeah we are
[25:33] standing year to just encourage the
[25:35] students of the Lord the privilege amen
[25:37] just want to thank the Lord for that he
[25:39] said John chapter fourteen listen what
[25:41] he said you rest with
[25:48] it's a very very I'd say unto you and
[25:53] this is when Jesus was the season when
[25:56] he was about to leave very very I say
[26:01] unto you he that believeth on me the
[26:05] works that I do shall he do also and
[26:11] greater works than these shall he do
[26:15] because I go on to my father praise the
[26:19] Lord
[26:20] god bless you you may be seated now when
[26:24] I was here um last time I was looking at
[26:28] a message on protection for the change
[26:31] if you yeah you can remember that amen
[26:35] and I pick up the story on this blind
[26:39] guy who was sitting at the gate of
[26:41] beautiful and now we went through the
[26:43] whole series and uh you could see how
[26:46] and I were trying to show you a picture
[26:49] and I want you to keep everything
[26:51] attention to my be very sure we go
[26:54] through this and you'll be able to see
[26:56] we come to our communion service but I
[26:58] was trying to bring a picture so you can
[27:02] understand brothers and sisters our
[27:05] existing on earth is very important you
[27:14] are not just yet because you want to be
[27:19] God now I just brought you on earth and
[27:21] place you on the face of the ethical go
[27:23] so you'll be a good guy you work make
[27:25] good money and that's not the purpose go
[27:27] play so yeah and I trust that God would
[27:29] get for almost a me that's why when we
[27:31] Roma saying this money will refund as I
[27:33] said who we are saying and that's the
[27:38] part we miss it because we we claim it a
[27:42] big Christian we claim to be believers
[27:44] all year we believe a messy Gaussian a
[27:46] profit and this is what it is ABC and D
[27:50] we can call all that message we can we
[27:52] can say all we can say but this is the
[27:54] this is the thing this is where God is
[27:56] telling this money to say who we are
[27:59] saying
[28:01] everybody's running up a job everybody
[28:05] running after your physical livelihood
[28:07] everybody want to see how best you can
[28:09] get on the top how wet can get this
[28:12] amount of money in here I can't how oh I
[28:15] need to marry this person and in 2 3 4 5
[28:18] the thing is you know we are diverting
[28:21] from the major part of our existing on
[28:25] earth and running after the the negative
[28:29] part of our little sister this part of
[28:32] us is the negative so if go out don't
[28:37] open our understanding to see the
[28:39] reality of who we are and the major
[28:42] purpose or why we're here
[28:43] whether you miss the home Mac in every
[28:48] effort you put in coming to church every
[28:50] effort you put in paying your tithes
[28:51] every effort you put in doing everything
[28:53] you miss them might because you you you
[28:56] you you you caught us in the stage of
[28:59] Elisha and the devil deceive you you
[29:02] walk in at the vain things just to
[29:04] modify and glorify and bring
[29:06] satisfaction though this man and not
[29:09] forgetting that this man is going to the
[29:11] doors now listen to what Jesus said when
[29:14] he was a battery we say is a hitter
[29:16] believer in me the work that I do so he
[29:19] do greater now what one way he said that
[29:25] there is a portion of the ministry to
[29:29] continue okay you understand what I'm
[29:32] saying brother sister it varies a
[29:35] portion of the ministry the container
[29:37] jesus here is looking at the disciple
[29:39] intelinet
[29:40] he that believes a main greater world in
[29:43] there so Richmond there is a portion
[29:45] that remains there is an appropriate
[29:47] part of the ministry that must be
[29:49] complete now we are going to do that and
[29:52] our the voice is saying this morning who
[29:53] shall I say so the question comes to
[29:59] each and every one was better look at
[30:00] yourself look at what you're doing when
[30:02] you woke up in the morning what you
[30:03] think about when when when we just where
[30:06] you've been what is for of your mind
[30:08] what do you think in the back while it's
[30:10] evening do you want what
[30:12] what is really your priority in life
[30:14] everyday who I'm talking to someone
[30:22] because if you mention that you miss
[30:25] everything so let this this is what I
[30:27] were trying to bring to your mom when
[30:28] about yeah this is the man that we just
[30:30] carry around sit on his knee what's
[30:32] called drunk door right he was here
[30:34] right and now you're saying this John
[30:36] Doe man he was born crippled I'm not
[30:41] going to go back to the mess you undo
[30:42] the mess by just starting from this you
[30:44] can understand to pick up from this
[30:45] morning after the stands we can take
[30:47] communion but just to be able to just
[30:49] elevate your faith a little bit to see
[30:52] brothers and sisters we are not on this
[30:55] earth just because we are yay we are not
[31:01] called to this messy just to cut what
[31:04] better brands say no there is a great
[31:08] great reason why and I trust that God
[31:13] would give our understanding tonight
[31:14] before we can come to this table because
[31:16] this is the part of identification you
[31:20] come in your community with God you are
[31:22] identifying yourself with him brother
[31:26] you will need revelation I trust that
[31:30] God would give her grace so now so this
[31:34] John does get with her bad okay we spin
[31:37] the whole story is the 14 years 40 years
[31:43] he was born in he was born the doctor
[31:47] pronouncing that he would never walk him
[31:51] mom and dad pray for him did they
[31:53] everything the cool but yeah he never
[31:56] walk 14 years he went through that part
[32:00] of his life now I was senior a child of
[32:03] God because every child of God a single
[32:06] mind before the foundation of the way

[33:50] because I have a greater profit now this
[33:52] is what I'm trying to get to the austere
[33:54] tribe the bride and believe for the
[33:56] Christian who father who I catch the
[33:58] revelation of this message I believe
[34:00] this message sometimes we don't we only
[34:04] said what we don't we found out the
[34:08] crowd
[34:09] oh we supposed to go to church didn't
[34:13] let go to church or to the Eva 70 we
[34:15] father the crying and and rejoicing in
[34:17] emotional in the I believe the message
[34:19] versus sister your action prove you
[34:21] don't believe the message you how did
[34:22] you prove you don't believe the message
[34:23] the revelation you expressed in the way
[34:25] you grabbed at a a proof that you don't
[34:27] believe the message
[34:33] now so let's just open our Bible net to
[34:35] the book of Acts chapter 3 let then you
[34:41] beyond understand I don't have
[34:43] sufficient time but at least I get Ted a
[34:44] minute to preach and that would be 8 you
[34:47] know for coming up but I trust that it
[34:49] will help us praise the law now Acts
[34:51] chapter 3
[34:52] listen now I want us to read very
[35:01] carefully very carefully just really
[35:05] follow me very carefully I stepped the
[35:07] tree first one we're gonna read
[35:10] everything missing we're gonna we're
[35:11] just gonna run with that am I gonna have
[35:15] chapter 3 verse 1 now listen very
[35:19] carefully now Peter and John went up
[35:21] together into the temple at the hour of
[35:22] prayer being announced out and the
[35:25] setting man lame from his mother's womb
[35:26] was carried whom they live dated at the
[35:28] gate of the temple which is called
[35:29] beautiful so a team of them they enter
[35:32] into the temple who we see Peter that
[35:35] John about to go into the temple eyes
[35:36] and Ames and Peter fastened his eyes
[35:38] upon him with John said look on us he
[35:42] did he onto them expecting to receive
[35:43] something of them then Peter said silver
[35:45] and go have our North but such as I have
[35:48] give IP in the name of Jesus Christ of
[35:51] Nazareth rise up and walk
[35:52] we want you out of there right and to
[35:54] him and he took him by the hand and lift
[35:58] him up and emitter his feet and ankle

[36:03] that dad to say we're not happy because
[36:10] the doctor gave the parents that report
[36:11] that did shy uncle boo and feet we never

[36:22] earth go up replaying your lab because

[36:35] your bed it's not just for you to
[36:37] rejoice is not just for you to say oh

[1:02:23] we can open - thing - it is very true
[1:02:26] that we the people that God is depending
[1:02:29] on we are sitting down Domon because God
[1:02:37] is depending on us but we just sit in
[1:02:41] line we think no all I need to do just
[1:02:44] look for this look for that
[1:02:45] what kind of morning I get food to eat
[1:02:47] you calculate all the noise coming in us
[1:02:48] all to pay my mortgage the more coming
[1:02:51] and my car loan is coming up it just all
[1:02:53] these things I would think about and we
[1:02:55] forget about the thing that going to do
[1:02:56] in our life I want to bring a picture so
[1:03:01] you could see the story look at Esther
[1:03:04] we started this to rest look at Esther
[1:03:07] the prophet let Esther to become a queen
[1:03:11] she were accepted and my other order
[1:03:13] women she would read the Bible she was a
[1:03:16] queen and that's what happened to the
[1:03:18] message the Prophet had given her all
[1:03:19] that we need in this message we got it
[1:03:23] received a messy you know saying but why
[1:03:28] would she doing in the palace sitting
[1:03:32] there enjoying yourself I think this and
[1:03:34] doing this and doing that and then
[1:03:36] something happen America hasn't
[1:03:43] we delivered to them well you were
[1:03:55] sitting down on the pressure message the
[1:03:58] powerful message like a change the life
[1:04:00] of the smoker like a change the life of
[1:04:02] a drunkard that can change the pressure
[1:04:04] to live like a change a homosexual
[1:04:06] the powerful message my god can bring
[1:04:09] dilemma we had this precious message and
[1:04:14] we're sitting on it but all we do is we

[1:05:19] every Joshua alders made the attack so
[1:05:24] it's not a matter of you receiving the

[1:21:10] although
[1:21:12] first corinthians chapter 11 first
[1:21:17] corinthians chapter 11
[1:21:23] or read from verse
[1:21:39] verse 23 first Corinthians chapter 11
[1:21:42] verse 23 for I've received of the Lord
[1:21:45] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:21:47] that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:21:50] that's what we are yet is evening the
[1:21:54] same night in which he was betrayed took
[1:21:57] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:22:01] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:22:05] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:22:10] remembrance of me
[1:22:13] after the same manner also he took the
[1:22:18] cup when he had supped saying this cup
[1:22:22] is the New Testament of my blood this do
[1:22:28] ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:22:31] of me for us of us ye eat this bread and
[1:22:37] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[1:22:40] death till he come Werfel whosoever
[1:22:46] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:22:49] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:22:53] of the body and the blood of the Lord
[1:22:57] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:23:01] him eat the bread and drink that drink
[1:23:04] of the cup for he that eateth and
[1:23:08] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:23:10] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:23:14] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:23:18] and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:23:23] and I'll sleep actually is part in this
[1:23:26] life as soon as I'm in ourselves we
[1:23:29] think on our way we are not looking into
[1:23:34] the righteousness of our flesh we remind
[1:23:40] ourself all the time that is the Lamb
[1:23:43] that gets on an examination is now the
[1:23:46] worshipper but here is the thing that
[1:23:49] brings damnation
[1:23:51] when
[1:23:54] we don't believe in what the sacrifice
[1:23:58] that he had made he died like Paul says
[1:24:03] actually in the book of Timothy to
[1:24:07] abolish death and if his death was it if
[1:24:12] his death was to abolish death then is
[1:24:16] it also abolished seen
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] praise the Lord
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:28] Saint John chapter praise the Lord
[1:24:35] chapter 13
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:48] so John chapter 13 verse 2 after supper
[1:24:53] was ended the devil having put now put
[1:24:59] into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's
[1:25:01] son to betrayed him Jesus nor either his
[1:25:05] father are given all things into his
[1:25:08] hands and that he was come from God and
[1:25:12] went to God he rises from supper and lay
[1:25:16] aside his Galman and took a towel and
[1:25:18] gather himself after that he poured
[1:25:22] water into a basin and began to wash the
[1:25:25] disciples feet and to wept in wave the
[1:25:29] towel wherewith he was gathered then
[1:25:33] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said
[1:25:37] unto Him Lord does they I wash my feet
[1:25:40] jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:25:43] what I do that I knoweth not now but - I
[1:25:48] know yeah after Peter said unto him thou
[1:25:52] shalt never wash my feet jesus answered
[1:25:54] him if if I washed in there there had no
[1:25:57] part with me Simon Peter said unto Him
[1:25:59] Lord not my feet only but also my hands
[1:26:02] in my head
[1:26:03] jesus said unto him he that is watch
[1:26:06] needeth now saved to wash his feet but
[1:26:10] is clean everywhere and yeah I clean but
[1:26:16] not all for he knew who she betrayed him
[1:26:22] therefore he said yea and not all claim
[1:26:27] you know this is a very strong statement
[1:26:31] Jesus norine Judas was sitting right
[1:26:33] there he just may talk of the wine he
[1:26:37] partook of the bread
[1:26:39] and that is the reason why when we come
[1:26:42] to this place
[1:26:43] we try to be earnest with ourselves and
[1:26:47] confess our sin because if you don't do
[1:26:49] it you will leave from here and just go
[1:26:51] and do worse what you were doing Judas
[1:26:54] left from there and went straight to
[1:26:56] betrayed Jesus he left that table and
[1:26:59] went in betrayed Jesus that's why we
[1:27:05] pour our hearts we try to be earnest
[1:27:08] Lord you know who I am you know you know
[1:27:11] help me my desire is to walk away from
[1:27:15] this wheel of life and God will honor
[1:27:20] your earnest desire first words so after
[1:27:29] he had washed their feet and have taken
[1:27:33] his garment he was sit down again and he
[1:27:36] said unto them know ye what I have done
[1:27:39] unto you ye call me master the Lord and
[1:27:44] ye say well for so I am if I then your
[1:27:48] Lord and Master have washed your feet ye
[1:27:51] also ought to wash one another's feet
[1:27:54] for I have given you an example that you
[1:27:57] should do as I have done unto you verily
