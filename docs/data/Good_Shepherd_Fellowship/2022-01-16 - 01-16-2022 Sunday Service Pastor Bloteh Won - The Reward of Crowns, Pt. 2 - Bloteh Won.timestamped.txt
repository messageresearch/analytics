[57:37] let's take our bibles and
[57:43] james chapter one
[57:47] last week we were talking on the rewards
[57:52] of
[57:52] crowns we want to continue
[57:56] today
[57:58] on that thought
[58:06] james chapter 1.
[58:16] let's read verse 12.
[58:18] just read one verse that in in james
[58:20] chapter 1.
[58:24] blessed is the man that endureth
[58:27] temptation
[58:29] for when he is tried
[58:32] he shall receive the crown of life
[58:36] which the lord have promised
[58:40] to them that love him
[58:43] praise the lord
[58:46] revelation chapter 2.
[59:06] revelation chapter 2 let's read from
[59:08] verse 8.
[59:10] this is told the seminar church is unto
[59:12] the angel of the church of simon right
[59:14] these things said
[59:16] the first and the last which was dead
[59:19] and is alive
[59:21] i know that works
[59:23] in tribulation and poverty
[59:28] but now i reach
[59:30] i know
[59:32] and i know
[59:35] the blasphemer of them which say they
[59:37] are jews and are net
[59:40] but they are the senegals of satan
[59:43] fear none of these things which
[59:46] thou shalt suffer
[59:49] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[59:52] into praising that ye may be tried
[59:56] and ye shall have tribulation 10 days
[1:00:01] be thou faithful
[1:00:03] unto death
[1:00:05] and i
[1:00:06] will give thee
[1:00:08] a crown of life
[1:00:11] praise the lord
[1:00:13] and if we notice the crown of life james
[1:00:16] spokes
[1:00:17] about it tying it to trials
[1:00:20] and here you see at an age uh in the
[1:00:23] seven church ages also is promised the
[1:00:25] crown of life but it's also tied to
[1:00:28] trials and tribulation so let's bow our
[1:00:31] heads and trust that the holy spirit
[1:00:33] will help us this morning heavenly
[1:00:35] father we are so grateful lord and again
[1:00:38] to be in your house oh god we
[1:00:40] we are just surrounding ourselves to you

[1:00:46] we we want to pray that lord you will
[1:00:48] come
[1:00:50] come now lord and take your word and
[1:00:53] break it to our hearts so father we're
[1:00:55] just
[1:00:56] surrounding ourselves with god to you
[1:00:59] that father you will find a channel by
[1:01:01] the word of the gift to bring your word
[1:01:04] to your people this morning dear lord
[1:01:06] father we pray that your word will bring
[1:01:09] strength healing to god comfort the
[1:01:11] father rebuke the enemy lord jesus we
[1:01:14] just want to thank you father for all
[1:01:16] your wonderful blessings that you have
[1:01:19] blessed us with in jesus name we pray
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:24] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:01:26] seed
[1:01:28] praise the lord
[1:01:30] praise the lord i i told
[1:01:33] uh
[1:01:34] this the sound team i will be referring
[1:01:37] back to
[1:01:39] my notes from last sunday
[1:01:41] but before then
[1:01:43] i will i would want them to project
[1:01:46] the tabernacle picture that brother
[1:01:48] george used on wednesday night
[1:01:51] uh he did a great job and uh god bless
[1:01:54] you brother george i know you're
[1:01:55] following the service from home
[1:01:57] family couldn't come but uh we we want
[1:02:00] to thank god for his grace upon
[1:02:02] your life and and i thought that was a
[1:02:04] that was a beautiful
[1:02:06] uh
[1:02:08] presentation teaching
[1:02:10] hesitation
[1:02:12] praise the lord
[1:02:14] and there was something that caught my
[1:02:16] attention first corinthians chapter one
[1:02:19] let's let's read that first corinthians
[1:02:21] chapter 1
[1:02:25] praise the lord
[1:02:29] first corinthians 1
[1:02:32] no
[1:02:33] not chapter 1 chapter 12.
[1:02:37] now chapter 1
[1:02:40] chapter 12.
[1:02:44] the apostle paul says in first
[1:02:46] corinthians chapter 12
[1:02:49] reading from verse 3 he said wherefore i
[1:02:51] give you
[1:02:53] to understand
[1:02:55] i want you to understand
[1:02:58] that no man's
[1:03:00] speaking
[1:03:01] by the spirit
[1:03:03] calleth jesus a curse
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:08] any man blaspheming he's now speaking by
[1:03:11] the spirit it's not the holy ghost
[1:03:16] but then he also say
[1:03:19] that no man
[1:03:22] speaking by the spirit of god
[1:03:24] no and that no man can say that jesus
[1:03:29] is the lord
[1:03:31] but by the holy ghost
[1:03:35] now so no man having the holy ghost is
[1:03:37] going to blaspheme the name of jesus
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] and no man
[1:03:44] can confess the name of jesus except the
[1:03:47] holy ghost
[1:03:49] does that in him
[1:03:51] now so when brother george was speaking
[1:03:54] uh wednesday night and he was he was
[1:03:57] talking about uh
[1:04:00] the brazen altar year
[1:04:02] and right in here
[1:04:05] in the in the interview
[1:04:07] is where you have the seven
[1:04:11] golem candlestick
[1:04:13] praise the lord
[1:04:14] right in here is a type of the church
[1:04:16] ages that's where you have the seven
[1:04:19] church ages the seventh goal in canada
[1:04:21] state
[1:04:22] but the seventh golden candlestick is
[1:04:24] light
[1:04:25] from the brazing altar
[1:04:28] praise the lord
[1:04:30] now so
[1:04:31] when the worshiper comes through this
[1:04:33] door
[1:04:35] now that's that's the reason why
[1:04:38] the the understanding of the holy ghost
[1:04:41] has been has been misunderstood
[1:04:44] because just like paul says here
[1:04:47] uh in this verse that no man can call
[1:04:50] jesus the christ
[1:04:53] is our first confession
[1:04:57] so right from here
[1:04:59] the holy ghost start dealing with you
[1:05:02] until you go through here the holy ghost
[1:05:05] brings you to baptism
[1:05:08] is the holy ghost that have to convict
[1:05:10] your young heart that you need to be
[1:05:13] identified with jesus christ
[1:05:17] praise the lord
[1:05:19] so it's it's a holy ghost dealing right
[1:05:22] from here
[1:05:23] and even true here so you see all these
[1:05:26] experiences that you have with the holy
[1:05:29] ghost and you come into the holiest of
[1:05:32] holy you come through justification and
[1:05:35] sanctification and all of that you see
[1:05:38] with all of this dealing it's so easy
[1:05:43] to come short
[1:05:45] of going through the interview
[1:05:52] because you have had a lot of experience
[1:05:54] here
[1:05:57] you can confess jesus christ as your
[1:05:59] lord and savior a true confession of
[1:06:03] jesus christ as your lord and savior it
[1:06:06] has to be by the holy ghost
[1:06:14] praise the lord so do you have the holy
[1:06:16] ghost yes you have the holy ghost
[1:06:19] you confess jesus christ as your lord
[1:06:21] and savior you have the holy ghost
[1:06:22] because it has to be a work of the holy
[1:06:24] ghost
[1:06:28] [Laughter]
[1:06:31] praise the lord
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:44] i reserved my coming
[1:06:48] and i saw it has to be a working of the
[1:06:50] holy ghost
[1:06:52] you see so that that has been the danger
[1:06:58] that has been the danger even through
[1:07:00] the ages when martin luther came with uh
[1:07:04] with uh with his revival
[1:07:07] of the just shall live by faith you know
[1:07:10] uh uh uh
[1:07:13] everybody that was that that that had a
[1:07:16] touch of god knew that that has to be
[1:07:19] god
[1:07:20] that would make a man to come against
[1:07:22] the system of that day
[1:07:25] come against the king of england
[1:07:28] come against the church
[1:07:35] praise the lord
[1:07:36] so you see that dealing if
[1:07:38] when god deals with you
[1:07:41] in one stage of your life
[1:07:46] praise the lord that's why you cannot
[1:07:48] dwell on experience
[1:07:50] experiences are good
[1:07:57] so i so uh you know i was sitting there
[1:08:01] in in uh and and
[1:08:03] looking at that
[1:08:05] so uh
[1:08:06] uh
[1:08:08] yes the the the the brazing the brazen
[1:08:12] altar
[1:08:13] you know where the the sacrifice is
[1:08:15] burned
[1:08:16] and then uh the larva the watching you
[1:08:19] know and year you go through this bill
[1:08:21] he spoke about this bill
[1:08:25] the worshiper coming in
[1:08:27] and then he goes through this ville and
[1:08:30] then go through this veil
[1:08:32] to go into
[1:08:34] the holiest of holy
[1:08:37] and just
[1:08:38] like we said commented a little bit
[1:08:40] after
[1:08:41] after the brother preaching wednesday
[1:08:43] night
[1:08:44] now
[1:08:45] this part of the tabernacle
[1:08:48] is
[1:08:50] is is lighting with the same light that
[1:08:53] is outside here
[1:08:55] that part of the tabernacle they have
[1:08:57] the sunlight
[1:09:00] the same light that the people outside
[1:09:03] have
[1:09:04] is the same light that is in that first
[1:09:08] part of the tabernacle are you
[1:09:10] understanding is the daylight
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] now so you see when when when many of
[1:09:17] these people says uh you know uh uh
[1:09:21] we would just we would just we'll just
[1:09:24] preach the bible
[1:09:28] praise the lord
[1:09:29] all of those all of those move of god
[1:09:32] all of those uh uh
[1:09:34] churches around is the bible that they
[1:09:36] are preaching
[1:09:42] praise the lord he spoke about the minor
[1:09:45] falling out here
[1:09:46] you know
[1:09:48] and then the priest was supposed to take
[1:09:50] some of the mana from here and take it
[1:09:52] into this place
[1:09:54] you know it was wholly concentrated it
[1:09:56] never it never rots like like the rest
[1:09:59] of them that fall out here
[1:10:01] now so when the worshiper comes
[1:10:04] in here he's sustained by the daylight
[1:10:07] just like everybody that is outside
[1:10:10] and then when the worshiper gets in here
[1:10:13] he no longer have contact with the
[1:10:15] daylight
[1:10:17] what is providing light right in here is
[1:10:20] the seventh golden candlestick
[1:10:26] it's a seven golden candlestick that
[1:10:27] lighting displays
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:31] so uh uh with the light year
[1:10:35] of uh of uh the worshiper that is in
[1:10:39] here
[1:10:39] he needs constant oil to keep that light
[1:10:43] burning
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] and the light right here also because
[1:10:51] it's a it's a lamp stain it can smoke
[1:10:57] and we know that that that smoke is is
[1:11:00] always according to the book of
[1:11:01] revelation is is tied to the bottomless
[1:11:04] pit is tied to demon powers so he has
[1:11:07] his greater battle right in here
[1:11:14] praise the lord
[1:11:15] amen he has his great about it right in
[1:11:18] here
[1:11:19] i mean he has uh he has understanding of
[1:11:22] the church ages and and everything is
[1:11:24] right in here
[1:11:29] praise the lord
[1:11:34] but just like i said because there was a
[1:11:37] dealing
[1:11:38] there was a dealing that pulls him into
[1:11:40] you
[1:11:41] it was christ dealing with his heart
[1:11:43] that pulls him into you he's getting
[1:11:46] close to god
[1:11:47] and god is dealing with his heart he
[1:11:49] went to water baptism
[1:11:51] and god is dealing with his heart he's
[1:11:53] getting closer here into a sanctified
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:58] it's all the dealing of the lord
[1:12:03] it's all the working of the holy ghost
[1:12:08] a man can be right here and say i have
[1:12:10] the holy ghost
[1:12:12] praise the lord
[1:12:13] he can say i have the holy ghost i had
[1:12:16] an experienced brother when i when i got
[1:12:18] in that truck oh my gosh
[1:12:21] i had an experience you know i i i i was
[1:12:24] dreaming and i was just in my dream i
[1:12:26] was lifting up to the clouds and you
[1:12:28] know i had a dream and you know i was i
[1:12:31] was praying to god and god broke my
[1:12:33] heart oh i cried or truly not i just
[1:12:35] cried i
[1:12:37] cried you can have an experience
[1:12:41] because it's all the dealing of the lord
[1:12:48] but you can come short of god when you
[1:12:51] stay with this experience
[1:12:53] they have just enlightened your heart
[1:12:56] your heart is just enlightening
[1:13:04] whatever experience you have here is not
[1:13:06] enough to carry you through
[1:13:18] you have the holy ghost i don't doubt it
[1:13:20] i don't doubt you have the holy ghost
[1:13:23] praise the lord
[1:13:24] just like the man that is in here that
[1:13:26] is having spiritual gifts he spoke in
[1:13:28] tongues he has high vision he you know
[1:13:31] gifts are right here this is where the
[1:13:32] gifts are the gifts of the preaching
[1:13:34] nine spiritual gift
[1:13:36] praise the lord five full ministry right
[1:13:38] in here right in here all on a seventh
[1:13:41] golden candlestick
[1:13:45] i lay my hands on the sick the sick got
[1:13:47] healed right in here
[1:13:50] i prophesied in tongues right in here
[1:14:03] praise the lord
[1:14:08] you see there is something
[1:14:09] there is something of the human nature
[1:14:12] we turn to be complacent
[1:14:15] until there's problem
[1:14:20] then we start to check and says
[1:14:23] was i okay
[1:14:25] was he okay
[1:14:28] praise the lord
[1:14:30] so you see
[1:14:31] but then
[1:14:33] coming through this field
[1:14:35] right here
[1:14:43] with the old testament tabernacle
[1:14:46] it was the high priest
[1:14:48] alone
[1:14:49] that goes in this field
[1:14:54] praise the lord amen
[1:14:57] that goes in this field
[1:14:59] now so god
[1:15:02] deals with the believer
[1:15:04] and brings the believer
[1:15:06] through this experience he gets right to
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:09] now
[1:15:10] he is
[1:15:12] our high priest
[1:15:16] praise the lord
[1:15:18] he is our high priest
[1:15:21] so
[1:15:22] you in yourself cannot go behind this
[1:15:25] bill
[1:15:28] it has to be the high priest only the
[1:15:30] high priest
[1:15:31] [Laughter]
[1:15:34] only the high priest
[1:15:37] the seven is messenger stay right here
[1:15:44] only the high priest
[1:15:46] not the pastor though

[1:16:29] sanctification it leads to the baptism
[1:16:32] of the holy ghost
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:34] and the holy ghost lead to the holy
[1:16:37] ghost himself
[1:16:39] the person of jesus christ
[1:16:42] not the experiences the very person of
[1:16:46] jesus christ

[1:17:13] all of this but when you get behind this
[1:17:15] bill
[1:17:16] that's one thing that matters
[1:17:21] is beholding his face
[1:17:29] praise the lord
[1:17:30] oh i thought it was a beautiful
[1:17:33] beautiful preaching on wednesday night
[1:17:35] amen

[1:17:39] about i've already taken half of my time
[1:17:42] just sharing with you what i was
[1:17:44] enjoying
[1:17:44] [Laughter]
[1:17:46] that was what i was enjoying through the
[1:17:48] service wednesday night i was just
[1:17:49] sitting there and said okay
[1:17:52] okay because you see the people we we
[1:17:56] we turn to uh
[1:17:59] make the holy ghost
[1:18:02] you know
[1:18:03] only
[1:18:04] this place is the person of jesus christ
[1:18:07] that's that's the finality that is the
[1:18:10] embodiment
[1:18:12] you know that is the embodiment but just
[1:18:14] like brother branham talked through i i
[1:18:16] saw brother george reference to that a
[1:18:18] little bit through the true the plant
[1:18:20] life
[1:18:21] from the seed
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] to the pauline and all through the
[1:18:27] different stages of life like brother
[1:18:29] branham said uh seed is not here with
[1:18:31] the shark he said they were all the
[1:18:32] carrier of the life
[1:18:37] it's not it's not only when you get here
[1:18:39] before
[1:18:40] you have the life you have the life it's
[1:18:42] a carrier of the life the spirit is
[1:18:44] carrying the life through the believer
[1:18:46] bringing him through different
[1:18:48] experiences
[1:18:59] praise the lord
[1:19:01] amen now you see that's what happened
[1:19:04] even with with with the young people you
[1:19:08] know people
[1:19:09] get uh to the place and you know uh uh i
[1:19:12] mean i'm not i'm not gonna i'm you know
[1:19:14] it's not a blasting game it's just
[1:19:16] trying to share with you you know the
[1:19:18] grace that the way i look at the world
[1:19:21] you get to the place where
[1:19:23] god is dealing with the heart of a young
[1:19:25] believer a young young young brother
[1:19:28] young sister uh
[1:19:30] just a child maybe eight years old and
[1:19:33] comes and says papa i want to be
[1:19:34] baptized and he says why you want to be
[1:19:38] baptized oh
[1:19:39] you know i've i've given my heart to the
[1:19:42] lord jesus i want to be baptized and the
[1:19:45] parents go and start talking to the
[1:19:47] child
[1:19:48] and like peter said
[1:19:50] that child has already had a good
[1:19:52] conscience towards god
[1:19:55] amen and a good conscience towards god
[1:19:58] do not come by our natural birth
[1:20:00] it has to come by god dealing with their
[1:20:03] heart now so
[1:20:05] uh okay this child now
[1:20:08] uh want to be baptized
[1:20:10] then you see and and the church the
[1:20:13] church idea is there that we give them
[1:20:15] all of these 20 rules to follow you need
[1:20:18] to do this you need to do this you need
[1:20:20] you know the message say don't do this
[1:20:21] you know do this you never do so we do
[1:20:23] all of that well that the child keep
[1:20:26] pressing on and they still want to be
[1:20:28] baptized they get baptized
[1:20:31] now
[1:20:32] because
[1:20:34] of
[1:20:35] our understanding of the holy ghost
[1:20:38] wanting the fullness
[1:20:40] we don't appreciate
[1:20:42] the dealing of god from this place
[1:20:46] we don't we don't cherish it we don't
[1:20:47] guide it
[1:20:49] to realize that it's the holy ghost that
[1:20:52] is dealing with this child
[1:20:54] for them to even fall on their bedside
[1:20:56] and pray
[1:20:57] for them to even sit down and and and
[1:21:00] say lord jesus bless my food and father
[1:21:03] provide for those that don't have we
[1:21:05] don't even cherish it
[1:21:07] because all in our mind where this
[1:21:08] mother don't have the holy ghost you're
[1:21:10] looking for a fullness
[1:21:13] so we create a lot of struggle and
[1:21:16] battle year because the the early
[1:21:19] dealing of the holy ghost was not
[1:21:20] cherished
[1:21:24] we create a lot of confusion for the
[1:21:26] young mind of this child
[1:21:35] are we together
[1:21:39] but no man
[1:21:43] can call jesus the christ
[1:21:46] except
[1:21:48] by the holy ghost
[1:21:54] praise the lord
[1:21:59] well let's go to our i will
[1:22:01] talk this morning
[1:22:03] if the lord will be gracious to us and
[1:22:06] help us
[1:22:08] you know it's our responsibility as as
[1:22:11] parents
[1:22:12] and as uh as church leaders
[1:22:15] to be able to keep keep watch on those
[1:22:17] things because uh
[1:22:19] uh
[1:22:22] you know you you hear brother branham
[1:22:24] picking up in in in
[1:22:26] in the prayer line where he talks about
[1:22:29] a child god never you know a child
[1:22:32] was was you know was was you know got
[1:22:35] afraid because something happened or
[1:22:38] because they were yellow and that thing
[1:22:40] kind of a trouble their spirit you know
[1:22:42] it created nervousness in them it
[1:22:44] created a sense of fear in them and then
[1:22:47] they have to deal with that the rest of
[1:22:48] their life the same thing happened with
[1:22:50] our spiritual growth
[1:22:54] you know it happens with our spiritual
[1:22:57] growth because
[1:22:59] our our our early dealing of the lord is
[1:23:02] not even considered as the holy ghost
[1:23:04] it's not considered as the holy ghost
[1:23:06] that is not the holy ghost we just take
[1:23:08] the terminology you just justify you
[1:23:10] don't have the holy ghost yet
[1:23:14] because it's not considered a dealing of
[1:23:18] the lord
[1:23:21] that's the reason why there is a lot of
[1:23:25] works a lot of human effort
[1:23:30] we try to work our way
[1:23:34] and you find people
[1:23:36] practicing the the
[1:23:38] the
[1:23:38] statue of the perfect man
[1:23:41] i i think i have faith now
[1:23:44] brother branson victor you got to get
[1:23:45] yourself under control
[1:23:47] temperature
[1:23:48] everything starts becoming
[1:23:50] a just a hemo workout
[1:23:55] it becomes a human workout
[1:23:58] and there is something
[1:24:00] about
[1:24:01] human beings something about humans
[1:24:04] when when you have when you have
[1:24:07] experienced failures
[1:24:10] in doing certain things you don't trust
[1:24:12] it anymore
[1:24:16] so when a person practice religion
[1:24:18] practice how to be holy you can practice
[1:24:21] it
[1:24:25] you have to learn to appreciate the
[1:24:26] grace of god
[1:24:28] that is dealing with you and is bringing
[1:24:30] you
[1:24:31] when the person practice all of those
[1:24:33] things and it gets to the place where
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:36] they keep feeling they keep feeling they
[1:24:38] keep feeling they realize that it's not
[1:24:40] working
[1:24:41] they don't know what to trust again
[1:24:43] because they were not trusting in christ
[1:24:46] they were not trusting in god
[1:24:48] they were trusting in the way they've
[1:24:50] been taught you have to do this to stop
[1:24:52] there you have to do this to stop this
[1:24:54] you have to do this to stop this
[1:25:09] praise the lord
[1:25:22] now so
[1:25:24] we're talking about the rewards of
[1:25:26] crowns
[1:25:28] and we read from the philadelphia church
[1:25:30] age a crown what is a crown a crown
[1:25:33] means that you have a domain
[1:25:36] and i was looking at
[1:25:38] i was i was studying yesterday then
[1:25:40] looking at this
[1:25:42] this uh
[1:25:45] you have to realize that the the bible
[1:25:47] was originally translated from the
[1:25:49] hebrew to the greek
[1:25:51] the greek was the language in those days
[1:25:55] and uh
[1:25:58] you know so it's not it's not all about
[1:26:01] trying to master languages
[1:26:03] but sometimes it gives you
[1:26:06] it gives you a broad idea for you to be
[1:26:09] able to look at the subject when you
[1:26:10] look at some of these things through
[1:26:12] the the concordance
[1:26:15] or the lesson con now i was i was
[1:26:17] looking at that as i was studying last
[1:26:19] night realized that uh you know brother
[1:26:21] branham saying here the crown means
[1:26:24] dominion like like i said many of the
[1:26:26] time
[1:26:27] in the way that uh we we think about
[1:26:29] receiving our crowns we look to receive
[1:26:33] our crowns after this life we look to
[1:26:36] receive our crown
[1:26:38] it's true there there are crowns that we
[1:26:40] will receive
[1:26:42] but we have to realize that uh uh
[1:26:46] you know uh
[1:26:48] malta will not inherit immortality you
[1:26:51] know so those crowns
[1:26:53] that uh you know is is is is it's
[1:26:57] beautiful to realize that uh you know
[1:26:59] the bible talks about the crown the
[1:27:01] righteousness the crown of light the
[1:27:03] crown of glory you know and and all of
[1:27:06] these different crowns and and the bible
[1:27:09] did not talk about the crown of siva the
[1:27:11] crown of brides and the crown of gold
[1:27:14] but it talks about a crown of
[1:27:15] righteousness in the crown of life so
[1:27:18] you will realize that
[1:27:20] is is uh you know is is uh
[1:27:24] uh
[1:27:25] things that god bring his his children
[1:27:27] through and uh like i said i was looking
[1:27:29] at this and looking at the word crown
[1:27:31] year
[1:27:32] i find this uh this word
[1:27:36] and uh
[1:27:37] uh
[1:27:38] is like
[1:27:40] exosa
[1:27:41] is kind of a greek word that's the
[1:27:43] pronunciation there it means the power
[1:27:46] of choice
[1:27:48] liberty of doing as one pleases
[1:27:53] praise the lord
[1:27:54] the power of choice
[1:27:56] could also be a crown
[1:28:00] i actually want to just look at uh uh uh
[1:28:04] this morning the crown of life talking
[1:28:05] about tribe but
[1:28:07] you know it's it's hard to get away from
[1:28:09] these things when you you you know keep
[1:28:12] your mind on then
[1:28:14] think about uh uh danny henry and
[1:28:17] prophecy over brother branham
[1:28:20] you know
[1:28:21] uh
[1:28:21] that baptist boy coming and prophesying
[1:28:24] you know speaking in tongues and prophet
[1:28:27] signing and you know uh uh
[1:28:30] in in the french language and and there
[1:28:32] were three witnesses to be able to give
[1:28:34] a divine interpretation of what it means
[1:28:37] because of the choice that you have made
[1:28:40] a huge a huge portion of heaven
[1:28:43] praise the lord so god was crowning the
[1:28:46] choice
[1:28:47] just like the bible says moses made a
[1:28:50] choice
[1:28:51] to choose to be identified
[1:28:54] wave
[1:28:56] the the the the bricks uh uh uh
[1:29:00] build us or the children of israel the
[1:29:03] slaves to choose to be identified with
[1:29:06] them you know then to to let and sleep
[1:29:10] in the wealth and the riches it was a
[1:29:12] choice that he made
[1:29:14] and god crowned his choice
[1:29:20] praise the lord
[1:29:22] amen
[1:29:24] so there is there is a crown to every
[1:29:27] choice that we make
[1:29:31] praise the lord
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:34] if you make a good choice
[1:29:37] for the live spies god can cry in you
[1:29:39] with a good wife
[1:29:41] or a good husband
[1:29:43] and if you make a wrong choice also you
[1:29:45] you will get whatever choice you made
[1:29:46] you get a crown for it
[1:29:49] let me
[1:29:50] praise the lord
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:56] that's the reason why solomon can say
[1:29:58] it's uh you know a good wife is is a
[1:30:01] crown it's a jewel of crown to a man
[1:30:04] you know but uh uh a nagging woman is is
[1:30:08] you know
[1:30:09] watered in his blood
[1:30:11] but i'm trying to bring out the the
[1:30:14] thought
[1:30:15] that uh
[1:30:17] you know because um
[1:30:20] as we go along uh i'm you know
[1:30:24] that's that's my inspiration i feel like
[1:30:27] we are in the crowning age
[1:30:29] i feel like this age is the crowning age
[1:30:34] you know i can take my defense in the
[1:30:37] world this is the age where has the
[1:30:39] promise that he that overcome will sit
[1:30:42] with me in my throne even as i've
[1:30:45] overcome it's the throne is a domain
[1:30:47] just like the crown is a domain
[1:30:50] so laodicea age in itself
[1:30:54] is a crowning age
[1:30:56] but more than more than ever we're
[1:30:59] beginning to see that
[1:31:01] this age is going to be crowned with the
[1:31:04] person of jesus christ in the life of
[1:31:06] the bride because it's going to be is
[1:31:09] going to be christ in bright form and
[1:31:11] this age is also going to be
[1:31:13] a crime with a person of the devil
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:21] don't you believe it
[1:31:23] don't you see the other things that is
[1:31:25] on the newsfeed and all the things that
[1:31:27] is happening
[1:31:28] weakness has rise to such uh you know
[1:31:30] such a place
[1:31:33] it's almost like men are losing uh uh uh
[1:31:36] you know uh
[1:31:37] sanitating your mind with some of the
[1:31:39] things that you're doing
[1:31:45] it's a grounding
[1:31:49] it's a crowning
[1:31:52] praise the lord
[1:31:55] and
[1:32:00] i can navigate over but it's even here a
[1:32:04] song a sign of the husband
[1:32:07] authority over his wife it's also a
[1:32:11] crowning the veil which
[1:32:14] with which uh
[1:32:17] the veil with which
[1:32:20] uh
[1:32:21] properly required for a woman to cover
[1:32:23] herself it was her crown
[1:32:27] praise the lord so all of those things
[1:32:29] i'm just only trying to bring us to the
[1:32:31] place to realize that we're not talking
[1:32:34] about mental crown
[1:32:35] or you know one that is made out of wood
[1:32:38] or ones that is made out of brass
[1:32:41] you know even our lord jesus they had to
[1:32:43] make a crown out of tom's and place it
[1:32:46] on his head
[1:32:48] so
[1:32:51] looking over here in the book of james
[1:32:55] and in the book of revelation
[1:32:59] it brings out
[1:33:01] how
[1:33:02] the trial of our faith the trial of our
[1:33:05] life
[1:33:06] and that
[1:33:07] god is talking to that church ages
[1:33:09] because that church aged because of what
[1:33:12] they were going to go through you know
[1:33:14] and and god is promising them that he
[1:33:17] will crown them
[1:33:19] with life
[1:33:21] praise the lord
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:29] and last week
[1:33:30] uh you know just just for the review
[1:33:34] we
[1:33:35] we look at
[1:33:36] uh some few things also
[1:33:39] that uh
[1:33:43] i just want to quickly go over some of
[1:33:46] them
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:52] night in time and sign one of the
[1:33:54] horriblest thing
[1:33:56] is to see a man or a woman that
[1:33:58] constantly complain i've always thought
[1:34:01] god keep me from it
[1:34:03] that weakens faith all the time
[1:34:06] complaining weakens faith i i know as as
[1:34:10] as they get older each one of us we are
[1:34:13] going
[1:34:14] we are going to get something happening
[1:34:17] and something will happen
[1:34:20] and i know those those little things
[1:34:23] are going to keep accumulating
[1:34:26] that as you get older
[1:34:29] they just
[1:34:30] gotta but
[1:34:33] i think one of the most horrible things
[1:34:37] is for satan to crown some person's life
[1:34:42] a crab at all man or or woman i hope
[1:34:47] that i don't get to that place
[1:34:49] i hope that i can bear it as my burden
[1:34:54] and get to a spot where i want my life
[1:34:57] crowned
[1:34:58] with the glory of god
[1:35:01] i want my life crowned with his long
[1:35:03] suffering with gentleness with peace and
[1:35:05] meekness so you see uh uh just like i
[1:35:09] said this is it's a crowning age we are
[1:35:11] living in you see that satan can also
[1:35:14] crown the person's life you know to be
[1:35:17] crabbed as last martial he can crown the
[1:35:20] person life to be stubborn he can crown
[1:35:22] the person alive with
[1:35:24] i mean with with evil thoughts and
[1:35:26] immorality he can cry in the present
[1:35:29] life to be blood tested all he wants to
[1:35:32] do is just to share blood and and all of
[1:35:34] these things praise the lord so you you
[1:35:37] see there there are there all of these
[1:35:39] things happening around us but god is
[1:35:42] also crowning his children life amen
[1:35:45] giving us grace and giving us a a
[1:35:48] passion to be able to deal with one
[1:35:50] another and deal with situations around
[1:35:52] us we we have to wash those things amen
[1:35:55] we have to wash your sins and just trust
[1:35:57] that the law will be able to help us
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:00] and
[1:36:04] another thought here
[1:36:06] but banham says those indulge he says
[1:36:09] what if the president will say i have
[1:36:11] come to take you
[1:36:14] and i have the authority to do that
[1:36:17] and make you the president of the united
[1:36:20] states
[1:36:21] you are going to have to give up
[1:36:24] something
[1:36:25] what if the queen wanted you to make you
[1:36:27] a queen of england
[1:36:29] you did have to give up
[1:36:32] you have to give it up
[1:36:36] but jesus gave us a crown of life
[1:36:40] that
[1:36:42] we never give up now this is the thought
[1:36:45] the thought here is that brother branham
[1:36:47] says if you were giving an offer to
[1:36:49] become the president of united said no
[1:36:51] matter how long you stay there your term
[1:36:53] will be over
[1:36:56] that's what he means by giving it up
[1:36:58] no matter how long you stay there your
[1:37:01] turn will be over
[1:37:04] if you were giving the opportunity if
[1:37:06] your turn does not get over you die
[1:37:09] it will be over it will come to an end
[1:37:12] but here is an offer here that that that
[1:37:15] that god is offering a crown
[1:37:18] of life
[1:37:21] amen
[1:37:22] he's offering us a crown of life
[1:37:26] so
[1:37:27] he said but jesus gave us a crown of
[1:37:30] life that we never give up
[1:37:33] an incorruptible crown of his glory
[1:37:36] we don't have to give it up
[1:37:38] he give it he gave it to us it's a
[1:37:41] blessing
[1:37:42] amen
[1:37:44] is the holy spirit
[1:37:46] that he want to crown our life wave
[1:37:52] how could we be so indifferent to turn
[1:37:55] it away
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:01] and uh and and you see and and and all
[1:38:04] of that
[1:38:05] i just want to pick up some of these
[1:38:06] things and and uh uh joshua i mean
[1:38:09] zacchaeus the businessman another taught
[1:38:12] right here he was talking about
[1:38:14] zacchaeus
[1:38:17] and uh and and this thought he he he
[1:38:20] took it in a way
[1:38:22] where
[1:38:24] uh
[1:38:26] zacchaeus had his affiliation with with
[1:38:30] uh you know uh uh the move the the
[1:38:33] sanhedrin's council in that day because
[1:38:36] he was a businessman
[1:38:38] and uh and and his wife has started to
[1:38:42] to believe the lord jesus and to go with
[1:38:44] the disciples but there was something
[1:38:46] that was that was holding him and and
[1:38:49] that's what he's taking this thought
[1:38:50] from he says that crown of that
[1:38:53] denominational creed
[1:38:55] that you are holding onto
[1:38:59] so you see
[1:39:00] some doctrine or understanding and
[1:39:02] belief can be a crown in a person's life
[1:39:07] praise the lord
[1:39:09] amen a person can be crowned with with
[1:39:11] such an idea and they just think it's
[1:39:14] it's my revelation
[1:39:16] you know and and you know they just
[1:39:18] believe that you know no matter how the
[1:39:20] holy spirit express it in another way no
[1:39:23] you are you are completely wrong this is
[1:39:25] the way i see this is and they are so
[1:39:27] crowned
[1:39:29] in that way that they cannot even
[1:39:31] fellowship with another brother they
[1:39:33] cannot even appreciate when a man says
[1:39:35] this is the way i see it
[1:39:40] praise the lord you see and that is the
[1:39:43] thing that makes uh uh the pentecostal
[1:39:45] movement to fill when they make speaking
[1:39:48] in tongues as the initial evidence of
[1:39:50] the holy ghost and the plenty that i
[1:39:52] stick down
[1:39:55] praise the lord
[1:39:57] they planted that down as long as you
[1:39:59] spoke in tongues oh brother you have a
[1:40:01] glory be to god you have made it
[1:40:04] you just broke behind the veil
[1:40:09] then what does it do to the human nature
[1:40:11] it makes the man to relax i've already
[1:40:13] arrived
[1:40:19] praise the lord
[1:40:21] and you find those very same people
[1:40:23] speaking in tongues living like the
[1:40:25] devil
[1:40:30] so you see it's a crown
[1:40:34] of understanding it's a crown of of
[1:40:37] creed
[1:40:38] that a person takes to their life
[1:40:45] and with that you cannot move on with
[1:40:47] god
[1:40:55] praise the lord
[1:41:11] now so
[1:41:12] you have uh
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:15] all of this we we also look based on uh
[1:41:18] the last time uh blasphemous name
[1:41:21] bravo mean breathe on mean spirit of the
[1:41:24] living god breathe on me
[1:41:27] that's my prayer
[1:41:30] just let the holy ghost breathe
[1:41:32] oh my
[1:41:33] for the for
[1:41:35] the breath of god what it is
[1:41:37] seal away
[1:41:39] in the kingdom of god knowing
[1:41:42] that when
[1:41:44] i i first confess
[1:41:46] i believe jesus christ
[1:41:50] then
[1:41:52] now
[1:41:54] this is something he's saying
[1:41:56] that we could apply to what we we spoke
[1:41:58] about earlier i would take the thought
[1:42:00] again i go back he says breathe on me
[1:42:02] breathe them in spirit of the living god
[1:42:05] breathe on me that's my prayer
[1:42:07] just let the holy spirit breathe all
[1:42:10] mine
[1:42:11] for the breath of god was what is it
[1:42:15] sealed away into the kingdom of god
[1:42:18] nor in there when i first confess i
[1:42:21] believe the lord jesus then he comes
[1:42:24] down to the statute of the prophet man
[1:42:26] and he says
[1:42:27] then
[1:42:28] to my faith i
[1:42:30] vets you godly that's you and then my
[1:42:34] vets you are knowledge of the word of
[1:42:36] god to my knowledge our temper and
[1:42:39] self-control
[1:42:40] i like that
[1:42:43] amen
[1:42:46] my country states today
[1:42:48] crown my soul
[1:42:50] with self-control
[1:42:54] from sea to shining sea
[1:42:57] praise the lord
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:00] now so
[1:43:02] uh
[1:43:04] patience all mine tested
[1:43:08] don't you worry sit and we sit on we'll
[1:43:10] try them
[1:43:12] for you
[1:43:13] i'm climbing up the ladder now
[1:43:16] i have other virtual knowledge
[1:43:18] temperance now and i have got to our
[1:43:20] passion
[1:43:23] i still under the holy ghost
[1:43:26] and after i passion i had godliness and
[1:43:29] you know all of that
[1:43:31] but this is word i got caught in this
[1:43:34] is where he talks about crowning
[1:43:38] my soul
[1:43:40] with self-control
[1:43:44] praise the lord
[1:43:46] amen so you realize that the in in our
[1:43:50] walk with god in the way that he deals
[1:43:53] with us
[1:43:54] god
[1:43:58] our crime of life or our our crowns the
[1:44:02] different crowns that he give us
[1:44:04] is now only after this life
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:10] i even in this life
[1:44:13] like even the crown of righteousness
[1:44:16] that the rational joy shall give us we
[1:44:19] don't need a a
[1:44:21] righteousness it's more needed year than
[1:44:23] there
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:32] it's more need a year than there
[1:44:36] so you see god brings a man just like
[1:44:40] the bible says god counted abraham
[1:44:42] righteous
[1:44:47] god deals with a man in such a way where
[1:44:50] he he brings him to a place and he can
[1:44:53] crown his life with with a virtue
[1:45:02] it's the dealing of the lord after he
[1:45:04] had gone through trials he have gone
[1:45:06] through
[1:45:07] different things in his life and god can
[1:45:10] just crown him
[1:45:11] like i said last sunday look at joseph
[1:45:14] the bible says he was a righteous man
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:20] god knowing that he's going to to bring
[1:45:23] his life through
[1:45:24] a young woman she's she just a young
[1:45:27] girl
[1:45:29] i mean she has she has all the young uh
[1:45:32] uh age pressure on her
[1:45:36] but yet he needed a man to to protect
[1:45:39] that gift
[1:45:42] amen
[1:45:44] so he found a man that is crowned with
[1:45:47] righteousness
[1:45:49] a man that would not be history to
[1:45:52] condemn
[1:45:56] mary bible says he was a just man
[1:46:04] praise the lord
[1:46:07] that he would not even he don't even
[1:46:09] want to embarrass her i don't understand
[1:46:11] this
[1:46:12] but i'm not going to say nothing against
[1:46:14] it
[1:46:18] that god will bless a man with such an
[1:46:21] attitude
[1:46:22] in the time of crisis
[1:46:26] in the time of crisis
[1:46:31] he's so calm
[1:46:33] i would just put her away privately
[1:46:37] i believe the head of sat down with him
[1:46:39] joseph
[1:46:40] you cannot be a fool this this girl has
[1:46:42] been has been playing around and now and
[1:46:46] and and all of that in and he just sat
[1:46:48] there listening to them
[1:46:50] if joseph had a wrong attitude an angel
[1:46:54] wouldn't have visited him
[1:46:59] if he had the attitude about this that's
[1:47:01] what you young girls can do you know
[1:47:03] you're just uh you're running around and
[1:47:05] doing all sorts of things what a
[1:47:07] disgrace you are
[1:47:10] there will have been no place in his
[1:47:12] heart
[1:47:13] for god to witness to all
[1:47:22] praise the lord
[1:47:24] so am i waiting for their crown after
[1:47:26] this life why some are receiving it in
[1:47:28] this life
[1:47:33] some are receiving it in this life
[1:47:47] oh my
[1:47:56] now i've
[1:47:57] i mentioned this i didn't read it last
[1:47:59] week but i mentioned it
[1:48:01] and uh wisdom versus faith
[1:48:07] now if you have internal life today
[1:48:10] you are in god
[1:48:14] by god being in you
[1:48:17] you are god's expressed thoughts
[1:48:25] they don't listen to any reasoning
[1:48:29] least
[1:48:30] your crown be taken
[1:48:33] and giving
[1:48:35] to
[1:48:35] another
[1:48:43] don't take reasoning at all just believe
[1:48:45] what god
[1:48:47] said
[1:48:48] is the truth
[1:48:50] stay with it
[1:48:52] let's draw a little bit on the top of
[1:48:54] least your crown be taken
[1:48:57] and giving
[1:48:58] to another
[1:49:01] praise the lord
[1:49:03] amen
[1:49:06] you see it it does not have anything to
[1:49:08] do with salvation because there you can
[1:49:10] see the prophet of god spirit out if god
[1:49:12] has saved you you have internal life
[1:49:15] your crown does not have to do anything
[1:49:17] with your salvation
[1:49:21] the crowns that god gave to his people
[1:49:24] and his children are for
[1:49:26] our reward
[1:49:28] he's rewarding them
[1:49:34] praise the lord
[1:49:38] revelation chapter 3
[1:49:40] verse 11.
[1:49:52] this was a message to the philadelphia
[1:49:54] church age let's just take this verse
[1:49:57] he says behold i come quickly
[1:50:00] hold that fast wish that have
[1:50:04] that no man take
[1:50:06] that crown
[1:50:11] praise the lord now god will not express
[1:50:14] that thought if it was not possible
[1:50:17] for your crown to be given to others
[1:50:28] are we together
[1:50:33] just i just want us to sing in a little
[1:50:35] bit
[1:50:37] because i know the wheels are working
[1:50:41] i know that spiritual wheel is spinning
[1:50:43] in you
[1:50:45] glory be to god
[1:50:47] and it's just good for us to just
[1:50:50] just uh
[1:50:51] allow that word to soak in a little bit
[1:50:55] amen
[1:50:57] how fast that wish
[1:50:59] that half that no man
[1:51:01] take that crown
[1:51:03] now jesus in his in in his many parables
[1:51:06] about the kingdom where he gave talents
[1:51:09] to his seventh there is one parable
[1:51:11] where he gave talent to this seven and
[1:51:14] he buried and he says i know my master
[1:51:16] you know he's uh he's he's a guy that
[1:51:19] likes uh profit when he when he does not
[1:51:21] do no work
[1:51:22] so i'm going to keep this i'm not going
[1:51:24] to do nothing with him
[1:51:26] and jesus talks and says how the master
[1:51:29] came and took that talent from him
[1:51:32] and gave it to another man
[1:51:39] jesus took it from the one that was
[1:51:41] doing nothing and gave it to the one
[1:51:44] that was already he
[1:51:46] he the the half net is taken from
[1:51:49] and he they have is giving talk
[1:51:53] praise the lord i know as a young
[1:51:55] believer how that scripture troubled my
[1:51:57] mind
[1:51:59] how it troubled my mind i stated on that
[1:52:02] and
[1:52:02] and i think it's this very message
[1:52:04] wisdom wisdom versus faith where uh uh
[1:52:10] no it is not wisdom versus faith
[1:52:14] faith is work express
[1:52:17] i was studying that message many years
[1:52:18] ago and then i came to understand
[1:52:21] the meaning of of what of what was said
[1:52:23] but let's let's get back to to touch
[1:52:25] here yeah so you you realize here now
[1:52:29] that a crown can be taken and given to
[1:52:32] another
[1:52:34] praise the lord
[1:52:35] amen
[1:52:37] and
[1:52:43] in most cases
[1:52:45] you know uh a scriptural sense is in the
[1:52:49] in the place of of reward
[1:52:53] and and uh that the lord
[1:52:55] gives to our life like i said last week
[1:52:59] you know
[1:53:02] since of god we have to believe
[1:53:04] that out of these years god has not been
[1:53:07] playing games with our life unless
[1:53:09] you've been playing games god have not
[1:53:11] been playing games
[1:53:13] praise the lord if he said he will have
[1:53:15] a bride with our spot wrinkle
[1:53:18] he going to have a bride he have already
[1:53:20] sent a message
[1:53:22] praise the lord
[1:53:23] to sweep that bride seven times around
[1:53:26] the world
[1:53:28] that voice
[1:53:29] of malachi fold echo
[1:53:32] so god god has not been playing games
[1:53:35] praise the lord
[1:53:37] i will share something with you but
[1:53:38] let's let's just do it on this uh uh a
[1:53:41] little bit so you realize that
[1:53:44] uh uh
[1:53:46] you know when when we give our heart to
[1:53:48] the lord and we accept the lord you know
[1:53:50] as our lord and savior
[1:53:53] the the the question of salvation the
[1:53:55] bible says is a free is a free gift that
[1:53:58] god give to us
[1:54:00] now is that place of where god
[1:54:03] is trying to bring a son or a daughter
[1:54:06] to build characters in their life
[1:54:11] praise the lord
[1:54:13] amen
[1:54:14] is that place of word god is trying to
[1:54:17] bring a son or a daughter bring a man or
[1:54:19] a woman to build character in their life
[1:54:25] and even as young people
[1:54:27] sometimes
[1:54:29] you know
[1:54:30] for for what the future that god knows
[1:54:33] about you he's going to allow things to
[1:54:36] happen
[1:54:38] praise the lord
[1:54:40] and it's almost like well that uh uh you
[1:54:43] know it's hard to be able to find a
[1:54:45] friend maybe god don't want you to find
[1:54:47] friend now god wants you to have him as
[1:54:49] a friend
[1:54:51] and and sometimes it looks like you know
[1:54:54] i know nobody want me in all of that and
[1:54:57] all of these different things that
[1:54:59] happen that we try to make a people
[1:55:01] problem it's never people problem is the
[1:55:04] almighty god
[1:55:05] trying to bring us to the place where he
[1:55:08] can trust us
[1:55:10] and crown our life
[1:55:20] praise the lord
[1:55:24] what is what is the benefit of having
[1:55:26] the best man
[1:55:27] the most harmful man the most rich man
[1:55:29] as your husband
[1:55:31] and you don't have jesus
[1:55:38] what's the benefit
[1:55:48] praise the lord
[1:55:51] and
[1:55:53] so you see all of that
[1:55:55] all of those all of those things
[1:56:00] you realize that
[1:56:02] i've said a story yet about
[1:56:05] luther
[1:56:06] before he came to convection
[1:56:09] and even john wesley
[1:56:12] john
[1:56:15] grew in the house of faith we know the
[1:56:17] story about
[1:56:18] his uh mother susana
[1:56:21] and and all of that and he gave his
[1:56:23] heart to the law as a young man
[1:56:26] you know and he would pray he was a
[1:56:29] prayer warrior he was a young boy that
[1:56:31] was pulled out of fire you know he he
[1:56:34] had out of this experience but do you
[1:56:36] realize
[1:56:38] that john
[1:56:39] wesley said
[1:56:41] all of those things that he did
[1:56:44] he was not converted
[1:56:47] until he even came to the u.s on the
[1:56:50] convention
[1:56:53] he came to have a revival year in the
[1:56:55] u.s it was on his way back
[1:56:59] when he met some dutch man
[1:57:05] some dutch man
[1:57:07] means man that was already affected by
[1:57:09] the revival of luther
[1:57:16] i mean he has gone he was he was
[1:57:18] ministering
[1:57:22] praise the lord so he just he he grew as
[1:57:25] a young man that uh you know that that
[1:57:29] love god you know and loved going to
[1:57:31] church
[1:57:33] but to really have that fire tender in
[1:57:35] his heart
[1:57:40] praise the lord
[1:57:43] the same thing with uh luther
[1:57:46] you can see in in this man's life
[1:57:50] why you know like brother branham would
[1:57:52] talk talks about uh uh uh he talks about
[1:57:55] irenas
[1:57:58] he says why that you know uh i think
[1:58:01] polycarp was now choosing as the
[1:58:03] messenger of the age
[1:58:07] even though he was one of the man that
[1:58:09] was heaven in his age so you see it
[1:58:12] takes it takes a man or a woman in the
[1:58:15] way that god is dealing with them to be
[1:58:17] able to take a position with christ
[1:58:24] luther with everything that was
[1:58:25] happening i mean he went to school he
[1:58:27] wanted to be a monk he dedicated himself
[1:58:30] he he crawled on his knee he had himself
[1:58:33] to bleed i mean all of those things he
[1:58:35] stayed fair his heart was far away from
[1:58:38] god
[1:58:39] he was doing everything the church asked
[1:58:41] him to do
[1:58:43] he said well i think it has to i have to
[1:58:45] get down there to rome i have to see
[1:58:47] what i got to get there to the vatican
[1:58:49] and understand
[1:58:51] what do i need to do
[1:58:54] because i'm doing everything that i know
[1:58:55] have to do yet i don't have peace with
[1:58:57] him
[1:58:58] and when he got over to vatican he saw
[1:59:00] the filthiness of of the people that
[1:59:03] caught himself holy and the things that
[1:59:05] are happening behind the black veil and
[1:59:06] the white veil
[1:59:08] my goodness
[1:59:11] but he remember
[1:59:15] a friend
[1:59:18] quoted to him before
[1:59:22] josiah chapter 2
[1:59:27] praise the lord
[1:59:33] on his way back
[1:59:35] just like i said when a person
[1:59:37] believe in a system
[1:59:40] and trust that system
[1:59:42] that's the thing that is making people
[1:59:44] around this message so scared to death
[1:59:48] because instead of going behind that
[1:59:50] veil
[1:59:51] and keeping our eyes on jesus
[1:59:54] we have stopped with a message we have
[1:59:56] stopped with a prophet
[1:59:58] [Music]
[1:59:59] and now people beginning to say
[2:00:00] everything that we are scared to do oh
[2:00:02] that i lost my life you mean i gave my
[2:00:04] life even it's because you did
[2:00:06] not go beyond the veil
[2:00:14] we are scared to death
[2:00:17] what if we were wrong
[2:00:20] it's not now that you were wrong you've
[2:00:21] been wrong ever since
[2:00:36] praise the lord
[2:00:40] oh
[2:00:46] now so
[2:00:48] all of these different things we realize
[2:00:50] the other
[2:01:03] now let's let's see let's let's take an
[2:01:05] example here
[2:01:06] and then and see this uh uh let's take
[2:01:09] this from index man
[2:01:13] and some of you some of you ladies with
[2:01:16] long hair says
[2:01:17] she's all faction
[2:01:20] see remember there's
[2:01:22] scuffers
[2:01:26] that's a crown
[2:01:28] that you are wearing
[2:01:31] the crown is not your natural head the
[2:01:34] crown is the obedience to god's word
[2:01:40] are we together
[2:01:42] amen
[2:01:43] he says that's the crown you are wearing
[2:01:46] god said it was your glory
[2:01:49] so you see he associate in the crown
[2:01:52] with god's word
[2:01:53] now with your natural head
[2:01:59] where with pride hallelujah
[2:02:02] where is with pride as you
[2:02:05] will wear a crown of tongues
[2:02:08] for your lord
[2:02:09] worthy with pride
[2:02:14] let me let me take another one here
[2:02:17] and uh but you see that uh
[2:02:20] uh in the way that he's he's bringing
[2:02:23] this thought
[2:02:24] is that uh
[2:02:28] you are taking position with the word
[2:02:31] and then you've been scoffed at
[2:02:35] praise the lord
[2:02:37] now
[2:02:38] many times where
[2:02:42] people get off track or people get
[2:02:47] you know embarrassed
[2:02:49] is because
[2:02:50] they are not they are not looking at the
[2:02:52] word
[2:02:55] they think about their own repetition
[2:03:00] the thing about their image that has
[2:03:02] been laughed at
[2:03:04] praise the lord
[2:03:06] they think about their personality and
[2:03:09] says oh my god you know what what an
[2:03:12] embarrassment he was trying to bring to
[2:03:13] me
[2:03:15] can you imagine
[2:03:19] a person like that talking to me
[2:03:23] now you see
[2:03:24] right there
[2:03:26] you have you have you have separated
[2:03:28] yourself
[2:03:29] if i can say in a literal way you have
[2:03:31] taken that crown off your head
[2:03:35] praise the lord
[2:03:37] because you are now making it your
[2:03:41] amen and yourself and you are not
[2:03:45] honoring the word
[2:03:47] that have brought you to that place
[2:03:51] praise the lord now you see that that is
[2:03:53] the thing uh
[2:03:55] of that out of the saints in the in the
[2:03:56] dark ages that were able to give their
[2:03:59] body to be burned and they were able to
[2:04:02] face uh you know the lion then and all
[2:04:04] of that the thing that they had in mind
[2:04:07] was the word they were doing it because
[2:04:10] of christ
[2:04:12] those men i was nailed to the tree and
[2:04:14] they said no i don't want to die like my
[2:04:16] lord turned me off saddam burma to this
[2:04:18] i'm not even water to die like jesus so
[2:04:21] they hide him on your mind that's the
[2:04:24] reason why they could bravely embrace
[2:04:26] their suffering the reason why this age
[2:04:29] cannot stand and uh try and and scoffing
[2:04:32] is all because we are filled with
[2:04:34] ourselves
[2:04:38] if we have christ on our mind no matter
[2:04:40] what somebody said about you no matter
[2:04:42] what they do to you you have crash on
[2:04:45] your mind
[2:04:47] he's the one that you want to be
[2:04:49] glorified
[2:04:50] i live my life for jesus
[2:04:55] they could go to the state to be burned
[2:04:58] because they know that
[2:04:59] they counted a privilege
[2:05:01] they counted a privilege
[2:05:06] because they had him on their mind they
[2:05:08] were not thinking about their they
[2:05:10] despised their own life
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:20] but let someone say something
[2:05:22] you mean me who are you
[2:05:25] where you think you are
[2:05:35] praise the lord
[2:05:39] so you see
[2:05:42] sometimes it's in those ways
[2:05:45] especially you young people
[2:05:48] that have come into a different world
[2:05:51] the word is not the same
[2:05:53] that your parents live in
[2:05:56] it's not the same
[2:05:58] praise the lord
[2:05:59] amen
[2:06:00] the word is not the same
[2:06:04] the word has become more fake than ever
[2:06:06] before
[2:06:08] praise the lord
[2:06:10] nothing nothing is real
[2:06:12] nothing is real
[2:06:14] it's only the life of jesus christ
[2:06:17] only the living god is real
[2:06:20] amen
[2:06:21] praise the lord
[2:06:22] a man can turn turn out to be a loving
[2:06:25] brother and tomorrow he turned out to be
[2:06:27] the worst hypocrite
[2:06:30] praise the lord
[2:06:32] but especially with
[2:06:34] the the visual reality
[2:06:36] world that we are breaking into
[2:06:39] praise the lord
[2:06:41] you know
[2:06:42] i was just i was just reading that last
[2:06:44] night
[2:06:45] but branham talks about us being in
[2:06:47] three dimensions
[2:06:50] talks about living in three dimensions
[2:06:53] but
[2:06:55] when he talked about the fourth
[2:06:57] dimension
[2:06:58] he says the fourth dimension is right
[2:07:00] here
[2:07:02] so actually
[2:07:04] we are living in four dimensions
[2:07:10] praise the lord
[2:07:14] are we together
[2:07:17] oh my
[2:07:24] let's share something together
[2:07:26] i pray that the law will
[2:07:30] will uh
[2:07:49] okay
[2:07:59] efficient chapter 3.
[2:08:09] efficient chapter 3.
[2:08:17] i'll just read a verse here
[2:08:20] and then i'll go on what i want to say
[2:08:23] maybe another time we will have time to
[2:08:25] spend spend time on there
[2:08:30] now in ephesians chapter 3 the apostle
[2:08:32] paul
[2:08:33] says something
[2:08:37] and
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:41] it took a profit in this age to be able
[2:08:44] to make us to understand what what
[2:08:47] actually paul was referring to
[2:08:55] verse 17 he says that christ may dwell
[2:08:58] in your heart by faith
[2:09:01] and that ye been rooted and granted in
[2:09:04] love
[2:09:06] may be able to comprehend with the
[2:09:09] saints
[2:09:11] which
[2:09:13] with the sins with the sins what is the
[2:09:16] breath let me take that over again
[2:09:21] that christ may dwell in your heart by
[2:09:23] faith
[2:09:24] that ye being rooted and granted in love
[2:09:27] may be able to comprehend with the
[2:09:29] saints
[2:09:30] what is the birth
[2:09:33] the length
[2:09:34] the depth
[2:09:36] and the height
[2:09:37] those are four dimensions
[2:09:42] and there's the four dimensions that we
[2:09:44] live in
[2:09:50] i even be able to comprehend with the
[2:09:52] sins what is the birth the lame the
[2:09:54] depths and the height
[2:09:56] and to know the love of god which passes
[2:09:59] understanding
[2:10:00] that ye may be filled
[2:10:03] with
[2:10:04] all the fullness of god
[2:10:09] now so
[2:10:11] you will see when he talks about the
[2:10:12] dimensions he talks about we are living
[2:10:15] in three dimensions the reason why he
[2:10:17] says that is because the fourth
[2:10:20] dimension is invisible to our eyes
[2:10:26] praise the lord amen
[2:10:28] and that's the reason why but when he
[2:10:30] talks about the fourth dimension he says
[2:10:32] there are voices that are going through
[2:10:34] this place
[2:10:37] so it's part of our dimension
[2:10:42] you see and and that is the reason why
[2:10:45] uh uh this age has been allowed to be
[2:10:48] the way it is this technology age is to
[2:10:51] be able to bring us the reality of that
[2:10:54] fourth dimension that is right here
[2:10:59] that is right here
[2:11:06] praise the lord
[2:11:08] it's right here we i mean
[2:11:10] the fourth dimension has has now become
[2:11:12] part of our life
[2:11:14] we can go anywhere without gps
[2:11:18] we can't find anything without google
[2:11:20] search
[2:11:22] you are living in the fourth dimension
[2:11:24] it's part of our life
[2:11:27] it's part of our life
[2:11:33] praise the lord
[2:11:35] oh it used to be oh no i i you know
[2:11:38] you know television where brother says
[2:11:39] the fourth dimension is right in your
[2:11:41] pocket
[2:11:47] it's right in your pocket
[2:12:04] praise the lord
[2:12:11] now so
[2:12:13] you know sometimes you grab you get in
[2:12:15] this place and then you you it seems to
[2:12:17] be you almost kind of for losing your
[2:12:19] your touch here because my mind is just
[2:12:22] kind of trying to stay on something here
[2:12:24] now so you you realize that
[2:12:27] uh
[2:12:29] i mean it's the time the age that we are
[2:12:31] living in my time is on me now so i
[2:12:34] gotta kind of close this thing up
[2:12:36] somewhere
[2:12:38] i gotta close this thing up somewhere
[2:12:42] but i will i will i will use
[2:12:46] the code i used last week to close
[2:12:48] present state of my ministry
[2:12:50] and let me let me say something to to us
[2:12:53] this morning
[2:12:55] as uh as brothers and sisters but says
[2:12:59] this it is usually such a time
[2:13:02] as this when man has stayed truth to the
[2:13:05] word
[2:13:07] and all men
[2:13:09] has forsaken him
[2:13:11] until god stepped
[2:13:15] in defense of that person
[2:13:18] and crown his ministry
[2:13:22] praise the lord
[2:13:28] i was i was studying that message last
[2:13:30] night
[2:13:33] and uh
[2:13:39] he talks and he he go ahead and he says
[2:13:42] that's right what a consolation what a
[2:13:45] consolation is built in the promise of
[2:13:47] god's word no matter what the word says
[2:13:51] what the word does
[2:13:54] that's not our hope
[2:13:57] is
[2:13:58] is not built in what the word our hope
[2:14:01] is not built in what the world is doing
[2:14:04] you remember that the message standing
[2:14:06] in a gap was preached
[2:14:10] from an experience of god seven having a
[2:14:13] complex
[2:14:14] because
[2:14:16] of the people rejecting him but yet want
[2:14:18] to use his gift brother branham you know
[2:14:20] i have this problem burbank and you have
[2:14:22] a vision of this broadband this that but
[2:14:24] he was not he was not uh they were not
[2:14:27] receiving the word
[2:14:30] so he got a complex
[2:14:32] and and he he was making a decision to
[2:14:35] just get out of the field and just still
[2:14:37] there
[2:14:38] and god told him if you do that
[2:14:41] if you do that
[2:14:43] he says your wife is going to leave you
[2:14:47] praise the lord
[2:14:49] and you're going to destroy your life
[2:14:51] you're going to destroy your ministry
[2:14:52] and the rest of that
[2:14:54] now
[2:14:56] so jerry said the other
[2:14:59] uh a man because when brother brahm
[2:15:01] talks about presentation of his ministry
[2:15:05] it was it was describing a time that
[2:15:08] will come
[2:15:09] which of course i believe we are in that
[2:15:12] time
[2:15:13] now so you have to realize like he said
[2:15:16] is two things that happen
[2:15:18] before god crowns a man's ministry
[2:15:21] god has to bring him to the place where
[2:15:25] all have forsaken him
[2:15:28] he said it's usually a time
[2:15:32] when man has still truth to the word
[2:15:35] and all have forsaken them
[2:15:39] praise the lord
[2:15:40] amen
[2:15:44] the crowning of john the baptist's
[2:15:46] ministry never came when he was standing
[2:15:49] on jordan
[2:15:50] when he said behold the lamb of god that
[2:15:52] took away the sin of the word
[2:15:55] that was not the crowning of his
[2:15:56] ministry
[2:15:58] john ministries was crowned when he was
[2:16:00] in prison
[2:16:02] and he sent his disciples and said you
[2:16:04] go and ask him
[2:16:07] praise the lord
[2:16:09] amen
[2:16:11] i mean with all the time that he has
[2:16:13] preached and everything that he did and
[2:16:15] and this mighty man that rolls up
[2:16:19] on the river jordan
[2:16:21] is now
[2:16:22] sitting in prison
[2:16:25] and he's even out to the place word
[2:16:29] he's saying things that sound confusing
[2:16:35] praise the lord
[2:16:38] amen
[2:16:40] he's saying things that are sounding
[2:16:41] confusing
[2:16:42] when he was a very woman that says there
[2:16:44] was one among us
[2:16:46] whose shoes i'm not wanted to loose
[2:16:50] praise the lord
[2:16:53] he's identifying the messiah
[2:16:57] but yet at the end of his ministry
[2:16:59] he said go and ask him is he the one
[2:17:05] amen praise the lord
[2:17:07] but brahman says you could say john has
[2:17:09] lost it
[2:17:10] he has deceived us out of this year
[2:17:14] he has lost it
[2:17:18] praise the lord
[2:17:20] amen
[2:17:23] he's beware he said
[2:17:25] you can say that he has lost it
[2:17:38] i just i just took these fuses and
[2:17:40] placed them in there but they are
[2:17:41] writing the message there jesus
[2:17:44] he's crowned on easter morning
[2:17:48] on the resurrection
[2:17:49] [Music]
[2:17:51] now you mean his ministry
[2:17:53] never got crowned
[2:17:55] when he failed five thousand
[2:18:00] when he fell five thousand people his
[2:18:02] ministry was not crowned
[2:18:05] even when he raised lazarus from the
[2:18:07] dead
[2:18:08] after being there four days
[2:18:12] a man gone into corruption and his
[2:18:14] ministry was not crowned
[2:18:17] it took his death
[2:18:19] his burial
[2:18:21] and his resurrection
[2:18:37] praise the lord
[2:18:41] daniel god sealed his ministry
[2:18:44] with the changing of the king's heart
[2:18:49] not even being in the lion damn that was
[2:18:52] not a crown of his ministry
[2:18:54] god crowned his ministry by changing a
[2:18:57] gentile king heart
[2:18:58] and ass
[2:19:00] and and the king commanding
[2:19:03] his entire kingdom to worship the god of
[2:19:06] daniel
[2:19:08] but brandon says that was the crowning
[2:19:11] of daniel's ministry
[2:19:24] he said jacob
[2:19:27] a supplanter
[2:19:30] to a prince of god
[2:19:32] when he walked out the next morning
[2:19:36] with his ministry crown
[2:19:40] praise the lord
[2:19:43] amen
[2:19:45] he says he did not care again what is
[2:19:46] isa did
[2:19:48] he tried to appease either
[2:19:51] tried to send gifts
[2:19:53] because he was so filled with fear
[2:19:56] but when he met god
[2:19:59] and his life was changed
[2:20:04] he came out
[2:20:06] with his
[2:20:08] life being crowned
[2:20:14] praise the lord
[2:20:16] trying to find a place to close here
[2:20:18] just bear with me
[2:20:21] god seven that state truth to the word
[2:20:25] that god sealed their ministry
[2:20:29] with a crowning time a time of grounding
[2:20:34] a time a period of time where god will
[2:20:37] allow things to
[2:20:42] happen that's what i said i believe that
[2:20:45] this is the crown in time
[2:20:47] because there has never been the time
[2:20:51] where this message of the hour
[2:20:53] has been on such an attack
[2:20:57] men
[2:20:58] that were born in the message man that
[2:21:01] were with the prophet man that
[2:21:03] that saw i mean all of those things
[2:21:06] never been the
[2:21:10] time praise the lord
[2:21:22] god seven said truth to the word
[2:21:26] that god see his ministry with the
[2:21:29] crowning of life
[2:21:30] sometimes people think that uh you know
[2:21:33] the crowning of the of of of a man's
[2:21:35] ministry is when the church is growing
[2:21:37] all
[2:21:40] praise the lord because it's just only
[2:21:42] growing for its time of trials
[2:21:48] it's just growing for its time of
[2:21:52] trials because
[2:21:55] we must have it
[2:21:57] whether we like it or not we must have
[2:22:00] it
[2:22:04] my prayer is god keeping truth to your
[2:22:06] word that's my prayer
[2:22:10] praise the lord
[2:22:11] amen
[2:22:13] that's my prayer
[2:22:15] and your people just taking all sorts of
[2:22:18] silly things
[2:22:20] i'm just talking to a young man
[2:22:23] and i'm advising him you know
[2:22:25] go on on the internet and and let me say
[2:22:29] this let me say this about about
[2:22:31] internet search
[2:22:34] praise the lord
[2:22:37] do you know that there's a steady
[2:22:39] they have
[2:22:41] that
[2:22:42] they have been able to
[2:22:45] to see
[2:22:46] the effects of video game
[2:22:49] just
[2:22:50] has the same effect of a person that is
[2:22:53] on pornographic site
[2:22:59] and and the line of the study
[2:23:02] is
[2:23:04] the thing
[2:23:05] that gives the desire
[2:23:08] for someone to be in a killing game
[2:23:11] or the vampire game
[2:23:14] that that same desire
[2:23:17] that that makes it's all it's all the
[2:23:19] word of visual reality that is coming to

[2:24:11] is is the same thing
[2:24:13] that drive a man to filth
[2:24:22] praise the lord
[2:24:23] so that's that's the thing
[2:24:27] check it out for yourself
[2:24:29] when you get on your search board
[2:24:32] when you want to search
[2:24:34] as soon as you put
[2:24:36] two words
[2:24:39] the the the
[2:24:41] the engine
[2:24:42] is able to generate what you are looking
[2:24:45] for because it knows the kind of things
[2:24:48] you search for
[2:24:53] it helps you
[2:24:55] the system has already now
[2:24:58] developed it has got itself associated
[2:25:01] with your your things you like to look
[2:25:03] for
[2:25:05] so as soon as you pull one word

[2:25:22] there is a bloody ghost
[2:25:27] always sound funny
[2:25:30] you sound funny
[2:25:49] wait until you start lose dealing with a
[2:25:51] child that is losing their mind
[2:25:53] and start hearing voices in their ears
[2:25:56] that's when you will know that it's not
[2:25:58] a funny thing i'm talking about
[2:26:11] the crown in time
[2:26:15] a crowning time
[2:26:18] is this time that we are living in
[2:26:22] oh i believe that this is the time that
[2:26:23] god is going to crown this message
[2:26:27] i believe that he's crowning this
[2:26:29] message
[2:26:30] with people that have gone through tough
[2:26:32] things in their life
[2:26:34] but they still love the lord jesus the
[2:26:36] same thing
[2:26:38] praise the lord
[2:26:40] because it has to be a period of time
[2:26:44] i mean
[2:26:46] brother brethren in the stage of his
[2:26:47] ministry he talks about not having
[2:26:49] invitation to go
[2:26:52] to go to places people are not uh
[2:26:54] inviting him
[2:26:56] for him to go to places but the the
[2:26:59] ministry was not honor
[2:27:04] you know it was not nobody could say
[2:27:06] anything wrong about that man
[2:27:09] they were just not allowing him in their
[2:27:11] pulpit
[2:27:12] praise the law they will not sponsor his
[2:27:14] campaign but it never came to a time
[2:27:17] where
[2:27:18] uh uh uh you know it never came to a
[2:27:21] time where
[2:27:23] the the the message was forsaken and
[2:27:26] people uh
[2:27:27] will say all sorts of things about it
[2:27:31] all sorts of things
[2:27:34] about it
[2:27:38] until
[2:27:40] the young internet generation
[2:27:43] are beginning to feed on those things
[2:27:48] and is beginning to create question in
[2:27:50] their mind
[2:27:54] praise the lord
[2:27:59] they are beginning to feed on those
[2:28:01] things
[2:28:03] and things proper on their phones and
[2:28:05] and things properly and and and go and
[2:28:07] wash wash those things
[2:28:09] the brother sent me in a video one time
[2:28:13] and
[2:28:15] and he put brother brandon picture
[2:28:17] behind by the el bisco pulpit
[2:28:21] i told him i said brother
[2:28:23] i never even read
[2:28:25] whatever quote you sent me
[2:28:27] because what you did to me
[2:28:30] is
[2:28:31] is is to mean is
[2:28:34] is uh
[2:28:36] whether i say circulation whatever you i
[2:28:39] mean i mean
[2:28:41] it don't make him a prophet if you put
[2:28:43] his poopy behind here
[2:28:46] it don't make us to
[2:28:48] shows that i mean we are really standing
[2:28:50] with the message that you got to copy
[2:28:52] his picture and make him to look like
[2:28:54] he's preaching in good shape for
[2:28:55] fellowship
[2:28:56] what what is that
[2:28:59] what is that
[2:29:01] that people will not even say happy new
[2:29:03] year
[2:29:04] without
[2:29:05] copying the cult of brother brandon it's
[2:29:07] it's not it's the it's the effect of
[2:29:11] the the visual reality
[2:29:14] that the expression is not even from a
[2:29:16] heart
[2:29:18] to say oh sister happy new year god
[2:29:20] bless you i have to take a 1965 quote of
[2:29:24] brother branham and send it it's don't
[2:29:26] get me wrong
[2:29:29] don't get me wrong
[2:29:30] if i'm taking a court
[2:29:32] and sending it and having my own
[2:29:35] expression
[2:29:38] oh may this prayer to brother brandon be
[2:29:39] a blessing to you
[2:29:41] may this quote a brother brandon be an
[2:29:43] encouragement to you
[2:29:45] but it's not just a copy pasting
[2:29:48] there is no attachment
[2:29:53] there is no reality in it
[2:30:01] some don't even read it they send it to
[2:30:03] me you see it a couple all my mind
[2:30:05] contact you and send it to them
[2:30:08] and then you realize you have received
[2:30:10] this code ten different times
[2:30:12] because it's just in cycle
[2:30:14] it shows that yeah we are in the message
[2:30:16] we're going in rapture we are sending
[2:30:18] the same code to one another oh praise
[2:30:20] god what a unity it's a fake unity
[2:30:28] it's a fake unity
[2:30:32] let my expression if i say god bless you
[2:30:35] let it be my own expression
[2:30:38] i can take psalm 24 and attach it to my
[2:30:41] phone i said and let this time bring joy
[2:30:43] to your heart
[2:30:45] i can take a coat of brother brandon and
[2:30:47] send it to you and say look i read this
[2:30:48] thing it was a blessing i hope it's a
[2:30:50] blessing to you
[2:31:06] praise the lord
[2:31:10] all of you young people
[2:31:12] you sit in your room you're in the quiet
[2:31:14] of your room
[2:31:15] you're watching things and looking at
[2:31:17] things
[2:31:18] you have to know that
[2:31:20] you are dealing with a dimension that is
[2:31:22] older than you
[2:31:24] praise the lord
[2:31:26] and as you watch those things they are
[2:31:27] spirits that are around that don't want
[2:31:30] the good of your life
[2:31:32] they don't want you to enjoy the
[2:31:34] blessings of these holy ghosts that
[2:31:35] we're talking about
[2:31:37] and the devil will do everything
[2:31:53] praise the lord
[2:31:54] all he want to do is to just solve
[2:31:57] one doubt in your spirit
[2:32:02] and you start having problems
[2:32:06] is this thing really truth
[2:32:09] i mean it just been brother brandon
[2:32:10] brother brandon brother branham
[2:32:12] he just want to sort that out
[2:32:16] and you might keep it to yourself
[2:32:22] and it will eat you away
[2:32:26] it will take every desire for you to
[2:32:28] listen to a tape
[2:32:30] because now you are doubting the prophet
[2:32:34] it will take every desire you will hear
[2:32:36] the word of god and what is this you
[2:32:39] know brother brown says that thing will
[2:32:40] kick up in you
[2:32:43] first prophet
[2:32:45] you are on a demon influence
[2:32:49] you have opened yourself to a spiritual
[2:32:52] world
[2:32:54] that if god don't come to your rescue
[2:32:58] you will soon put your post on facebook
[2:33:10] praise the lord
[2:33:13] and because we feed on this on the
[2:33:15] smartphone
[2:33:16] we get smart answers
[2:33:21] our answers are not earnest again it's
[2:33:23] smart
[2:33:25] just find the smartest thing
[2:33:27] smartest little cheek
[2:33:31] that you can give to get away
[2:33:38] i hope he cried my ministry with this
[2:33:42] of letting me take the clothes of the
[2:33:45] world
[2:33:46] and dress his bride
[2:33:48] in the clothes of the world
[2:33:51] and for his righteousness
[2:33:54] but ram says i hope he crown my ministry
[2:33:56] with this
[2:33:58] praise the lord
[2:34:00] i hope he crowned my ministry
[2:34:02] that there will be people
[2:34:04] that will take this word
[2:34:06] and dress themselves the bible says the
[2:34:09] bride make herself ready
[2:34:12] you must take the word
[2:34:14] and apply it to the need in your life
[2:34:20] take the word amen
[2:34:23] and say god i need you in this area of
[2:34:25] my life
[2:34:35] i hope you were crying
[2:34:37] and let me stand there
[2:34:39] that day saying behold the lamb of god
[2:34:42] that takes away the sin of the word
[2:34:44] there is so many hills to climb
[2:34:48] sometimes it gets hard
[2:34:52] but the one the point the pathway
[2:34:56] knows just what is best
[2:35:03] he knows what best
[2:35:05] the toad of the road will seem nothing
[2:35:08] when we get to the end of the way
[2:35:14] let homes for the bloody footprints
[2:35:18] just remember friends
[2:35:20] the saying has been watched
[2:35:23] in the footprints
[2:35:25] that's what is happening
[2:35:28] the same has been watched in the
[2:35:29] footprints
[2:35:40] that's what is happening
[2:35:44] and people complain we can't see no
[2:35:46] manifestation no manifestation so what a
[2:35:49] group you know just dwelled on
[2:35:51] manifestation
[2:35:59] i pray that god will cry my ministry
[2:36:01] whatever it is
[2:36:04] it may be a housewife
[2:36:08] you mean a housewife can be crowned
[2:36:13] you mean god can crown a woman to be a
[2:36:16] housewife
[2:36:20] praise the lord
[2:36:27] you mean god can crown the woman
[2:36:32] and i believe that susana wesley was
[2:36:34] crowned
[2:36:37] to be able to raise the amount of
[2:36:39] children that she raised up
[2:36:40] and gave the word the best sounds
[2:36:45] one that wrote a lot of the songs we
[2:36:47] think
[2:36:51] and another one that god could get in
[2:36:52] his hands like a firebrand
[2:37:01] praise the
[2:37:02] lord remember this god that is crowning
[2:37:05] a housewife is not the hustleman crown
[2:37:07] you know

[2:37:17] buy crowns for your wife you can
[2:37:20] you can buy a little crown and never put
[2:37:22] him on her forehead
[2:37:26] oh glory be to god i pray that god will
[2:37:29] cry my ministry
[2:37:34] it may be a preacher
[2:37:36] now seeing what he's saying here
[2:37:39] what he's saying
[2:37:40] i pray that god will cry my ministry it
[2:37:43] may be a
[2:37:44] housewife a housewife in order with the
[2:37:48] word is a crown of his ministry his
[2:37:51] ministry is producing housewives
[2:37:55] that would take their position that will
[2:37:57] stand between their husband and the
[2:37:59] world
[2:38:03] his ministry is producing preachers
[2:38:08] not not just lecturers
[2:38:10] but men that would stick their heads and
[2:38:13] still on your knees and study the world
[2:38:20] say i hope god cried my ministry with
[2:38:23] preachers

[2:38:49] that we want god to make himself real in
[2:38:51] their life let that be the crown of my
[2:38:53] ministry
[2:39:04] i pray that god would cry my ministry
[2:39:06] maybe a preacher
[2:39:08] maybe a deacon
[2:39:11] maybe a lame member
[2:39:13] you mean even a lay member
[2:39:18] praise the lord
[2:39:20] will be a crown to his ministry
[2:39:25] and there be a farmer
[2:39:30] i don't know what it is whatever it is
[2:39:32] may god crown your life
[2:39:35] with the glory of his word

[2:39:42] with the glory of his word
[2:39:47] praise the lord
[2:39:48] not crying in your life with church
[2:39:50] membership
[2:39:52] but crowning your life

[2:40:20] i've spilled my time here
[2:40:24] we will continue
[2:40:27] i like to get back to the crown of life
[2:40:40] but you think about it
[2:40:42] think about it
[2:40:45] can you find a situation a tough
[2:40:48] situation in your life
[2:40:51] that you can think that god trusted you
[2:40:53] with
[2:40:55] and how that you did with it
[2:41:03] god is saying a healer
[2:41:06] he's a healer sometimes
[2:41:10] he will trust his children
[2:41:12] with sicknesses
[2:41:14] just like he did to job
[2:41:17] [Music]
[2:41:20] to see how you would deal with faith
[2:41:23] this lucky goal is alive that people are
[2:41:26] looking for
[2:41:37] some of the things we go through some of
[2:41:39] the things we did with some of the
[2:41:40] things that we did
[2:41:44] and he'll put us in situations
[2:41:47] very embarrassing to our character
[2:41:49] [Music]
[2:41:51] and sometimes we go through things we
[2:41:53] are so ashamed of ourselves
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:56] but because god used your life
[2:42:00] and you are going to be an example to
[2:42:03] somebody
[2:42:04] he's used your life to be a consolation
[2:42:07] to somebody
[2:42:09] [Music]
[2:42:11] when he was using the characters in the
[2:42:12] bible he never told them what he was
[2:42:14] using them for
[2:42:17] and now we can read their story and
[2:42:19] count on their life
[2:42:21] [Music]
[2:42:26] so
[2:42:28] [Music]
[2:42:40] oh may god empty us of ourselves
[2:42:42] [Music]
[2:42:44] and may he get some christ down in our
[2:42:47] heart
[2:42:48] may he empty us off ourself
[2:42:51] and get some christ down in our life
[2:42:56] [Music]
[2:43:03] sometimes god
[2:43:06] will put a person a garlic man or a
[2:43:09] garlic woman in the situation
[2:43:12] the law of the law they are doing
[2:43:14] everything to save the law but yet their
[2:43:15] children are away from the lord
[2:43:18] and god will allow them to be in that
[2:43:20] situation
[2:43:22] and realize that
[2:43:24] even in that situation
[2:43:27] they love their children
[2:43:30] praise the lord sometimes god will just
[2:43:32] allow that
[2:43:40] you see your father and i say the day
[2:43:42] you walk away from this bible
[2:43:44] i would take your name from my family
[2:43:46] name
[2:43:49] [Music]
[2:43:52] that man was just odd about his own
[2:43:54] repetition it was not about god
[2:43:58] he have shown himself i said holy man
[2:44:00] now his children are not serving the
[2:44:02] lord he's embarrassed
[2:44:06] but a godly man a righteous man
[2:44:09] will still love his children
[2:44:13] and stay care for them because he knows
[2:44:15] that god is the creator and you might
[2:44:18] sit down there like a backslaughter and
[2:44:19] say look at them your children are not
[2:44:21] even serving the lord
[2:44:24] praise the lord
[2:44:25] that might be your judgment that might
[2:44:27] be the things that is running through
[2:44:29] your mind but god is crowning you alive
