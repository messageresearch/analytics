[11:03] christ jesus is he living in you if he
[11:06] does he'll identify himself there
[11:08] if he's there he's bound to let himself
[11:10] be knowing you can't hide him

[11:15] ghost and you know you haven't
[11:17] raise up your hand be that honest say i
[11:19] haven't got the holy ghost i know i am

[12:01] of almighty
[12:02] god's word let that congregation get
[12:05] that kind of shape this because some
[12:06] organization you read the same bible and

[12:13] dirty feet
[12:14] and haven't you got the real christians
[12:15] spunk about you to stand up and take up
[12:17] for it
[12:18] look like you should god be merciful
[12:22] i pray that god will send the holy ghost
[12:24] and conviction just now
[12:26] that'll make this congregation realize
[12:27] where it's sitting are you conscious
[12:29] that this is your opportunity
[12:30] are you going to do like that courier
[12:32] did pass up your last opportunity are

[18:16] the man the gate said let's see if your
[18:18] name is showing the books that it isn't
[18:20] he said the lot of the ministers said i
[18:22] couldn't help what you were
[18:23] if your name's not on here you can't
[18:25] enter the story just like
[18:27] this man you have to have the name on
[18:29] the boat
[18:31] and he said well what can i do he said

[18:35] want to
[18:35] to this god's white throne judgment old
[18:38] brother sister don't ever
[18:39] go there so he said i guess i have no

[19:17] he said i have the commandments said
[19:19] danny martin
[19:21] did you ever lie in your life he said i
[19:24] thought i've been a
[19:25] truthful man but in the presence of that
[19:27] light
[19:28] i realized that sets the thing's machine
[19:31] she said
[19:32] uh yes sir i told lies he said did you
[19:36] ever steal he said
[19:40] i thought i've been honest but i'd see

[20:05] bible says it's an abomination to the
[20:07] sight of god

[20:10] when where's your conscience
[20:13] i said well did you ever do this or that
[20:16] yes he said
[20:17] and danny if you ever see it
[20:20] he said yes i see and he's just
[20:23] not here he said his bones looked like
[20:25] he was coming out of the joint to hear
[20:26] that
[20:26] depart into everlasting hell from my
[20:30] presence
[20:30] said he heard the sweetest voice he ever
[20:32] heard
[20:34] he said he looked around and said he's
[20:35] seen the sweetest face that he ever saw
[20:38] he said he said father that's true that
[20:41] he tried to live in everything that he
[20:42] knows how to live but he did do wrong
[20:44] but one thing he did down on earth he
[20:47] stood for me
[20:49] he stood up for me took up for me and
[20:51] all my word
[20:52] now stand for him here that's what
[20:55] you're doing now

[21:04] merciful
[21:05] and grant the forgiveness of these
[21:06] people's sins they've come here to make

[21:11] holy ghost grant if you'll be
[21:13] given i clean that lord for your glory
[21:15] while they stand before this audience as
[21:17] a witness
[21:18] some of them are church members some of
[21:20] them are backsliders some of them have
[21:22] never accepted you before
[21:24] and they're standing here and they see
[21:26] the dirt that follows a real true
[21:28] christian
[21:29] confession and they're ready now to take
[21:31] their stand to that woman
[21:32] to confess their sinners but with their
[21:34] tears of repentance they
[21:36] want to wash the dirt from your name

[28:11] dancing in the spirit of some kind of a
[28:12] sensation
[28:13] christ is a person
[28:16] certainly and he's the word and if he's
[28:19] in there he always
[28:21] makes his work work just exactly the way
