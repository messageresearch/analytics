[music] [music] [music] [music] modern. our new board of trustees and so forth. I was thinking of our brother Fleman and brother Deetszman and them sitting here who has served well before. We want to be thankful to God for their loyal service. May the Lord ever be with them to bless them and to help them. I want to read before just remember now the bulletin board and so forth and the coming meeting and we're happy to have with us this morning well uh I might sit like this a man who has been very precious to me and times past and precious now a good brother Fred Soffman from and his wife from Saskatchewan Canada who is here to sojourn with us in our nation, a souljourer, but in our fellowship, a beloved brother, Brother Fred Soffman, sitting there. He manages the campaign for me when it was in Canada. And another precious brother who is also formerly a Canadian, which was a businessman, and can prove to the world that you can't outgive God. He and his buddy formed a foundation for finances of building a place or for a foreign mission, a foundation. They called me to Oakland for a meeting and said they had the money they had sponsored all in their foundation. Brother Fred and I tried that for some money that Brother Fred had it I would not take as an individual. So then we decided we would give it to the Canadian people and not even take up an offering. But it didn't go so good. The beatings were fine, but because we didn't take up an offering, I don't care if the church is worth a hundred billion dollars, you still owe it to God to take up an offering. That's part of the worship. And you rob that. As much as I've been against money and things like that, I find out when a man's wrong, you might as well admit you're wrong because brother Fred and I see it pan out not so good. And brother Borders, when I left Brother Fred and come down to you at Oakland, I said, "Don't you do it. You just pass the collection plate, take up an offering, whatever it is, put it back in your foundation for another meeting somewhere." And before the service is closed, Brother Border and his friends come to me and said, "As much as we put into the the meeting is already took up." Amen. And then a few days ago he made arrangements for a meeting in San Jose, California where he had some I guess 60 or 70 churches in the valley of all different faiths all cooperating. We had a wonderful meeting and returning back again November. We're happy to have you with us, brother Borders and brother Fred sitting back there. And um these men is strangers maybe to you all, but they've been precious brothers to me out in the fields contending earnestly for the faith that we're standing for. God bless you, brother. We're glad to have you this morning in the little tabernacle here. Not much to look upon, but there's something here that we know that God lives here. He said, &gt;&gt; so we're happy for that. and these other precious brethren by time to mention that's with us today. Now I am anticipating and praying that in the next few days the Lord willing I want to go feeling led I haven't made the announcement the next meeting to oh to be with brother Sullivan on the campground within a short time it's only about 100 miles up there I guess Jean something like that be a fine trip if you haven't planned your vacation if the Lord continues to lead it very fine man and a we appreciate brother Sullivan great deal just a he's a mayor of the city uh was just ex mayor and just an oldfashioned Kentucky and that's all I can say about him when I met him the other day in we was both raised down there in the mountains of Kentucky or he said to me have you still got your ass affidity around your neck Billy you know how how uh Kentucky he is Now, let's turn in no disregards to my Kentucky brethren here, brother uh Jeff and so forth. I'm a Kuckian, too. You know, I'll tell you one thing. We are We are not Kuckians or neither are we Americans. We are pilgrims and strangers. We're seeking a city to come. &gt;&gt; Now, for a reading, let's read out of the book of Exodus for a few minutes. I wish to read from the 23rd chapter and the 20th verse to the 23rd inclusive. Now I want to take a text this morning from like this of this rather uh total deliverance and I won't be long speaking now while I was waiting for you to turn to your book and chapter behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. I'm sure that the congregation knows who this angel was. My name is in him. And if thou will indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak, then will I be an enemy unto thy enemies, and an adversary unto thy adversaries. For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee unto the Amorites, the Hatites, Persanites, Canaanites, Havites, and Juponites. and I will cut them off. May the Lord bless his word as we &gt;&gt; speak now for a few minutes if you pray. I was thinking on this subject of a total deliverance. The church has been in the in the minority. It always will be in members until Jesus comes, but it's living under its god-given privileges. If we only knew this is the church of the living God, not the Brandham tabernacle, but the Brham tabernacle just part of it. There's other such tabernacles to the country. Brother Snelling tonight is having a baptismal service. I forgot brother Curtis told me to announce that or told me yes it is having it. He's having a baptismal service and if anyone here has never been baptized uh yet brother Snelling would be glad to do that tonight. That's the hole in his tabernacle at Udica and brother Junior Jackson in New Albany. And there's many such churches throughout the country, but we're all living seem like on the defeated side more or less. I heard brother Neville announced this morning back there that it kind of come to my mind that the people seemingly are getting away from deliverance. It seems to be something that the people seen it, so they just push it out to one side. Oh, well, God can do it. But that's not the attitude. Now, Moses, when he was called by God, he was a total complete prophet. When God sends a man to do anything, he completely EQUIPS HIM WITH EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS NEED OF. IF GOD CALLS A MAN TO BE A PREACHER, he puts something in him to preach with. He calls him to be a teacher, HE PUTS SOMETHING IN him to teach with. If he calls for him to be a prophet, he puts something in him to see visions and to be a prophet. GOD ALWAYS completely equips his man. AND THAT'S JUST WHAT HE DONE WHEN HE SENT MOSES into Egypt. He raised him up in a certain way and he schooled him in a certain way and he molded him and made him and fashioned him after he had promised Abraham hundreds of years before that he would deliver the people. Then he he had in mind that HE WOULD MAKE MOSES JUST THE WAY MOSES WAS MADE. Moses was a complete prophet and then being a complete prophet. Then just LIKE YOU IF YOU ARE a Christian. Then just like you if you are a Christian, GOD DON'T MAKE ANY HALFWAY. God makes complete Christians. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T MAKE HALFWAY PREACHERS. But the preacher can be halfway. AND GOD MAKES HIS CHILDREN CHRISTIANS, BUT SOMETIMES THEY'RE HALFWAY CHRISTIANS. BUT IT'S NOT GOD'S INTENTION FOR THEM TO BE THAT WAY. It's their own WAYS GOT MIXED UP WITH THE PLAN OF GOD FOR THEIR LIFE. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM THE WAY THEY ARE. God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side or HE WANTS THEM TO completely stand in the breach. &gt;&gt; Now Moses, GOD HAD MADE him a complete PROPHET FOR A complete deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND MOSES WAS COMPLETELY surrendered into the hands of God. &gt;&gt; That's the reason it made him what he was. HE WAS SO COMPLETE IN GOD TILL GOD COULD TRUST HIM. I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yielded our own will AND YIELDED OURSELVES SO COMPLETELY TO GOD TO GOD CAN TRUST us the place that he has put us. I wonder this morning of myself if I could be SO YIELDED TO GOD TO GOD could trust me, could trust Brother Neville, could trust our trustee board, our deacon board, OUR MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH. WE ALL HAVE A PLACE AND WE GOT A DUTY. THE MINISTERS GOT A PLACE OF DUTY TO STAND AND PREACH THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST WITHOUT COMPROMISING. &gt;&gt; If he's called to be a preacher, &gt;&gt; he wouldn't spare one thing for one person. If he's called to be a preacher and the member of the church, HE'S CALLED TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS CERTAIN GROUP, then he would not compromise. If the church believes THAT WE SHOULD NOT GAMBLE, THEN THAT MEMBER SHOULD NEVER TOUCH A DECK OF CARDS. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN DRINKING, HE SHOULD TURN HIS HEAD COMPLETELY FROM DRINKING. If we do NOT BELIEVE IN GAMBLING OR SMOKING, THE MEMBER OF THIS CHURCH SHOULD NEVER TOUCH SUCH A THING. God gives complete deliverance when we he will DO IT IF WE'LL COMPLETELY SURRENDER ourselves to him. IF WE WILL COMPLETELY DELIVER OURSELVES INTO HIS HAND, THEN GOD CAN LIVE IN US. &gt;&gt; CHRIST the hope of glory. AMEN. HE CAN REFLECT HIMSELF FROM US AS WE GET OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY. Then our thoughts are his thoughts. Could you IMAGINE CHRIST SMOKING A CIGAR? Could you imagine Christ drinking or playing cards? THEN IF YOUR SPIRIT IS PART OF HIS SPIRIT, he wants it to be upon your confession. But you permit the devil to come in and take OVER AND ALL THE TIME IN YOUR HEART WAY DOWN DEEP. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WRONG WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS. And when ONE MEMBER WOULD TALK AGAINST THE OTHER MEMBER, YOU KNOW that's wrong. You're commanded to pray for one another. Not to talk against one another, &gt;&gt; BUT TO LOVE one another. &gt;&gt; And if someone is down, let's pick him up, help him. Now that makes us a a a unified group of believers. Now when we don't OBEY THAT THEN WE DON'T OBEY GOD AND WE DISPLEASE God and therefore our church our people cannot prosper. The church cannot go on is because we're disunified together. As Jesus said, a little leaven leavenvens a lump. Now, if the uh uh church board uh like the the deacons would come and say that we were to uh uh thinking we should build a new tabernacle. If that is the vote out the deacons and the trustees are consulted and they don't have the money to do it, then they have a building program like we have going on now. AND THEN IT'S STUCK OVER THE GENERAL AUDIENCE AS we should be off the church being sovereign, THEN IF THE CHURCH VOTES FOR THE NEW TABERNACLE, THEN WE ALL SHOULD COOPERATE TOGETHER IN BUILDING that new tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Frankly myself when they spoke of new tabernacle to me I was against the thought that's right I said we don't need exactly new tabernacle I'll probably be leaving here pretty soon as the Lord if what he showed me comes to pass what do we need with the new tabernacle we haven't got the money THEN I COME DOWN AND FELT THE FEELING OF THE church that the CHURCH IN THE MAJORITY SEEMED TO WANT IT. Then what did I DO? I SACRIFICED MY OWN THOUGHTS AND THROWED IN WITH THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. That's the way we cast lots. That's the way was in the Bible time. The way the church voted the the sovereignty, the groups of the people, they come together in unity, their strength. So therefore, I said certainly if that's the way the church wants, if that's what GOD IS WANTING, HE'S GOT MORE of authority to vote among a whole group of people than he has to me because I have no vision to say that it shouldn't be. So we throw in with the church and move with the church and I'm behind it to do all that I can &gt;&gt; to help out the church. That should be the motive of every Christian and every person in the church is for uh to unify ourselves and stick together. Whatever the church votes for, that's what we should stand for. Then say for instance u uh the uh want to change something in the church. But then if the trustees wants to or the somebody else wants to the deacons they want to change SOMETHING THAT COMES BEFORE THE CHURCH THE CHURCH THEN TOGETHER and if our if our idea here seems to be a little different what THE WHOLE CHURCH SAYS LET'S SACRIFICE that idea &gt;&gt; because that's the only way we can stand united and if this CHURCH WILL JUST GO ON THE WAY YOU'RE GOING now and be united TOGETHER GOD WILL UNLIMITED WHAT HE'LL DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If we'll stick together, &gt;&gt; we must stick together. That's how we want to be so complete with ONE ANOTHER AND THEN SO COMPLETE IN THE HANDS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; And we've got to have a man that we believe that preaches the word of God. &gt;&gt; If the man don't do it, THEN GET SOMEBODY WHO DOES DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the way we must stand. If the trustee board won't stand for what's right, THEN IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO ELECT SOMEBODY WHO WILL STAND FOR WHAT'S RIGHT. AND THEN WHEN YOU DO IT, STAND BY IT. &gt;&gt; It's up to you. STAND BY. AND ALL TOGETHER, WE'RE STANDING FOR ONE THING. THAT'S GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If a member makes a mistake, don't turn him down. Help him. Raise him up. Get together. Have a hearing with one another. what the scripture said. WHEN WE MAKE A MISTAKE, LET'S GO BEFORE GOD. BEFORE WE CAN GO BEFORE GOD, WE GOT TO GO BEFORE THE PERSON WE HURT. I just had to do that. And I know what I did wrong. I lied. Caused my wife to lie. I believe I've told you about it. You're here at the church. There's a few days not long ago. It's been about six weeks ago. THE ATTORNEYS HAD ME SO TORE up over this investigation that I hardly knew where I was at. I just went home from the office to eat dinner and the private phone number rang and me went to answer the phone. She put her hand over said, "It's amourning again." I SAID, "I COULDN'T STAND ANOTHER EVENING. MY HEAD FEELS LIKE IT'S DRAWING OFF. I'M LOSING MY MIND. Just pulling me this way and that way and this way." I said, "I can't stand it." And I jumped up and I said, "Tell him I'm not in here and run around behind the house." WHEN I COME BACK, Mati is very conscientious of those things. She met me at the door half crying. She said, "Bill, was that the right thing to do?" "You know how you are. I know how I am." I SAID, "SURE, I WASN'T in here right then. I knew God had condemned me for it." I said, "I wasn't in here right then." Said, "But you was in HERE WHEN HE MADE THE CALL." That afternoon, I went to pray for a sick baby. AND BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE, the phone rang AGAIN AND LITTLE JOSEPH WENT OVER AND TOOK HOLD OF THE PHONE AND SAID, "DADDY, YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM YOU'RE NOT HERE?" YOU SEE HOW SIN CROPS? WHAT A FAMILY THAT WOULD FINALLY BE. First John the 5th chapter in the 21ST VERSE SAID, "IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US NOT, &gt;&gt; then we have CONFIDENCE IN GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US, HOW CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN GOD? We know AS LONG AS WE GOT SIN THAT'S NOT CONFESSED, he'll never hear us." &gt;&gt; That's strong. But it's it's it's the church needs these things. Then I started TO PRAY FOR THIS BABY. AND WHEN I STARTED TO LAY MY HANDS ON IT, THE LORD REBUKED ME AND SAID, "YOU TOLD A LIE. You ain't fit to pray for that baby." I turned away from the man. I SAID, "SIR, YOU JUST WAIT HERE. I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO MAKE RIGHT." I called up THE ATTORNEY AND WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE, CALLED HIM IN. I SAID, "LOOK, SIR, I'VE TOLD A LIE. I had my wife TO LIE." SHE SAID, "I wasn't in there." And I run out behind THE HOUSE AND I CONFESSED IT AND TOLD HIM ABOUT IT. Walked up, put his hands on my shoulder. He said, "Brother Graham, I've always had confidence in you, but I got more than ever now." &gt;&gt; A man, he said, is willing to make right is wrong. I told him I said I started to pray for a baby and the LORD WOULD JUST CONDEMNING MY HEART BECAUSE I KNOW I HAD DONE WRONG. &gt;&gt; Then the next day wife said where you going? I said to my cave. I went up to my cave up above Charleston where I've been going for years. I GOT IN THERE AND I PRAYED ALL THAT DAY. OH GOD [screaming] DON'T NEVER LET ME DO A THING like that again. You forgive me Lord. For when I start to put my hands on the sick people to pray, then it's condemned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Long about 3:00 in the evening, I come out. There's a big rock laid out there. And I got on that rock and was looking up towards the east with my hands up praising the Lord and is just so quiet in there. And I said, "Lord, if you'll just one time you passed by Moses and he said it was the one you had him in the cliff of the rock and it looked like the back part of a man." I said, "Could you do it again, Lord? let me know I'm forgiven. And I said, "IF YOU'LL HELP ME AND COME ON MY MIND," I said, "Lord, I I'm not very strong mentally cuz I'm no education." I said, "And I I'm trying to serve you." You know, my heart and I didn't ought to done that. I didn't mean to do that. My head JUST FELT LIKE WAS COMING OFF. I WAS SO NERVOUS. I done it in a catch of a moment when Satan called me. I said, "IF YOU FORGIVE ME, let me see YOU LORD, GOD BE MY JUDGES RIGHT OVER TO MY SIDE." A LITTLE PLACE OF BUSHES BEGIN TO WHIRL LIKE A WIND. They come right along the side of the cave where I went down through the woods. Oh brother, a peace that passes all understanding SWEPT OVER ME. AND I CRIED, I WEPT, I SHOUTED. &gt;&gt; I know my sins were forgiven me. &gt;&gt; See, I was disunified with God. &gt;&gt; I couldn't have deliverance for the baby. Uh and the very next day this [music]
