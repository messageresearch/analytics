[53:25] looking at it before before we got down
[53:27] there to harizon didn't preach on the
[53:28] door even though while uh just talking
[53:32] to brother um Daniel we had a oh man
[53:37] that
[53:38] uh old Soldier man I mean that old man
[53:42] he he would just he would just keep you
[53:46] thinking amen keep you
[53:49] thinking so tonight let's go to St John
[53:52] chapter
[53:54] 3 very familiar
[53:57] very familiar in John chapter
[54:00] 3 very very
[54:09] familiar very
[54:12] familiar that's what Jesus gave the
[54:16] teaching on the new
[54:18] birth and
[54:20] uh and for a good while now I've come to
[54:24] realize that this teaching of the New
[54:27] Birth is for
[54:29] preachers if there are ever a group of
[54:31] people that need to be born again are
[54:35] preachers when Jesus was talking he was
[54:37] he was talking to a teacher of the Lord
[54:40] he was not talking to the publicans and
[54:43] uh you know and he was talking to the
[54:46] teachers of the Lord so
[54:50] uh praise the
[54:52] Lord let's read from verse one
[54:58] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[55:02] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[55:07] Jews the same came to Jesus by
[55:11] night and said unto him
[55:14] rber we know that thou are a teacher
[55:20] come from God we know we the
[55:25] Pharisees we we the Sanhedrin we the
[55:29] ruler of the Jews he's speaking on
[55:32] behalf of the entire Jewish Council he
[55:37] says we know which mean if they know
[55:40] means that they are talking about
[55:43] it amen they are sitting and they are
[55:46] discussing we just heard he healed the
[55:48] blind look gentlemen we might not
[55:51] believe what that man
[55:53] believe but he's a man from God praise
[55:56] the Lord amen I said that I do a little
[56:01] parenthesis here a brother sent me a
[56:03] video today and uh it's a Pentecostal
[56:06] preacher that is preaching and he's
[56:08] talking about brother Brandon he get his
[56:10] story all mix up but he's talking about
[56:12] brother Brandon and he says uh you know
[56:14] well uh uh he's talking about brother
[56:17] Brandon how brother Brandon you know
[56:18] Inspire him talking about brother
[56:20] Brandon discernment and this brother
[56:22] text me you know send me the video and
[56:24] then he text me you know uh even even
[56:27] unbelieving preachers are talking about
[56:29] the prophet and this man is not even in
[56:33] church he's unbelieving preacher he's
[56:35] talking about the prophet you that a
[56:36] true uh believer you are not in
[56:39] church we don't even know where you
[56:43] are praise the Lord someone that is
[56:47] testifying about brother brandham you
[56:49] call them unbelieving preaches you that
[56:51] a Believer we can't see
[56:54] you praise the Lord the
[56:58] Lord that that is a parenthesis I don't
[57:01] even know where I was going with
[57:03] that praise the Lord but when I look at
[57:05] I just I just shook my head I didn't
[57:07] even reply because I know where he
[57:10] wanted to go I mean uh uh uh if we if we
[57:14] believe that he's a prophet we must we
[57:16] must follow the message he has given us
[57:19] he have instructed us how to you
[57:21] know uh uh raise our home and love our
[57:24] wives serve the love better is not just
[57:27] knowing him as a
[57:29] prophet but doing what the message
[57:32] taking the message that he has given to
[57:34] us okay let's let's get back to our
[57:36] reading tonight praise the
[57:38] Lord the same came to Jesus by night and
[57:42] said unto him Raba we know that thou are
[57:45] a teacher come from God and no man can
[57:49] do this miracle that thou dust accept
[57:53] God be with him
[57:56] praise the Lord
[57:59] amen so they know that this man God was
[58:03] with him they couldn't understand all
[58:05] the details of his ministry but he knew
[58:08] that this was a man of God praise the
[58:12] Lord
[58:14] amen and uh we we we sit on the branch
[58:18] of uh uh American politics and another
[58:21] woman is running for president everybody
[58:23] is on the edge because they want to
[58:25] bring 1933 prophecy brother Bram said I
[58:28] mean the whole internet is going to be
[58:30] filled with
[58:31] it but it has already been
[58:35] fulfilled you know he told us to every
[58:38] prophecy there is a spiritual
[58:39] application and and the and the physical
[58:42] PA he told us that you know there that
[58:44] was that was the uh the scol colar Beast
[58:47] which is which is the the the the Roman
[58:50] Church praise the
[58:52] Lord but we know
[58:57] that no man can do these things except
[58:59] God be with
[59:01] him verse three Jesus answered and said
[59:04] unto him verily verily I said unto thee
[59:09] except a man be born again he cannot see
[59:14] the Kingdom of Heaven the Lord bless you
[59:16] you may have your seat let's stay right
[59:18] there we read that again now Nicodemus
[59:21] is saying all of this to
[59:23] Jesus this is just just just a little
[59:26] hesitation now uh just I really want us
[59:29] to spend time in prayer tonight and uh
[59:34] uh Nicodemus is saying all of this to
[59:37] Jesus it it might sound like uh like an
[59:40] acceptance speech it might sound like uh
[59:44] a little word of Praise all the time the
[59:46] the Pharisees are condemning him you are
[59:48] aible you you get evil spirit but this
[59:51] time one of them is coming and he's and
[59:54] he's and he's saying something that
[59:57] might sound like a little a little
[59:59] accepting speech we know that you are a
[1:00:03] teacher from God and no man can do these
[1:00:06] things that you are doing to open the
[1:00:08] blind eyes and and a man born blind you
[1:00:11] open his eyes and uh uh we knew uh BL
[1:00:14] bimos and and you give him his sight and
[1:00:17] and uh uh uh jy's daughter you rais jy's
[1:00:21] daughter up I mean these guys they had
[1:00:24] the record of everything that Jesus was
[1:00:27] doing praise the
[1:00:30] Lord they might stand in the public and
[1:00:33] argue but when they sit in councel they
[1:00:37] said this man was a man of God praise
[1:00:39] the Lord now you would think that after
[1:00:44] Nicodemus who say that Jesus Will says
[1:00:47] oh man thank you Nicodemus I'm very glad
[1:00:51] you know I'm I'm happy you know uh I'm
[1:00:54] really really appreciate you coming
[1:00:56] tonight but he turned to him and said
[1:01:01] except a man be born
[1:01:03] again he cannot see the
[1:01:06] kingdom of
[1:01:08] God now Jesus was trying to show
[1:01:12] Nicodemus the
[1:01:16] disconnect why you believe that I am a
[1:01:19] manent from
[1:01:21] God but yet you are not following me
[1:01:26] he was trying to show him the
[1:01:29] disconnect from your own mouth you say
[1:01:33] no man can do this
[1:01:35] work yet you don't believe me to be the
[1:01:39] Messiah praise the
[1:01:41] Lord amen so he was trying to show
[1:01:45] Nicodemus the disconnect and that
[1:01:48] disconnect is still real
[1:01:54] today it's the
[1:01:56] disconnect that we all
[1:02:02] have we all we are born with that
[1:02:06] disconnect praise the Lord our natural
[1:02:10] birth give us a
[1:02:14] disconnect we can go to church come to
[1:02:16] church enjoy the music listen to the
[1:02:19] preach preaching even sit there and say
[1:02:21] that's truth praise the Lord amen
[1:02:26] but yet there is a
[1:02:31] disconnect and
[1:02:36] sometimes our heart believe that is the
[1:02:39] truth but
[1:02:43] yet the strength to be able to step into
[1:02:46] that
[1:02:51] truth so Jesus was trying to show
[1:02:54] Nicodemus the disconnect that's what I
[1:02:56] want that's the first place I want to
[1:02:58] establish tonight don't
[1:03:00] worry we have a long way to go with this
[1:03:02] subject I'm just only greeting you
[1:03:08] tonight except a man be born
[1:03:11] again he cannot
[1:03:15] see the kingdom of God
[1:03:20] Amen and as we will as we will we will
[1:03:23] we will go along and read you know we
[1:03:26] will we will learn that uh see means to
[1:03:30] understand praise the Lord except he's
[1:03:33] born again he he would not be able to
[1:03:35] really put it
[1:03:37] together because he believed that it's
[1:03:39] God but sometimes he take it personal he
[1:03:43] think that it's against him they thought
[1:03:45] that Jesus was was was you making the
[1:03:48] the Lord of God of
[1:03:49] tradition says oh you are trying to
[1:03:51] blast us and you know and and sometimes
[1:03:54] we take it personal because that
[1:03:56] disconnect is
[1:03:57] there and that is the work of the Holy
[1:04:01] Ghost to connect
[1:04:04] you your real
[1:04:07] you with the
[1:04:09] Father the real you that is
[1:04:12] beyond
[1:04:15] all all your Tendencies your your habit
[1:04:19] your attitudes your thoughts they rear
[1:04:21] you to connect it back to God
[1:04:27] that's the work of the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost praise the
[1:04:33] Lord do you see how
[1:04:36] much when we talk about the fall the
[1:04:39] fall it means that men fail from
[1:04:42] somewhere and that fall created a
[1:04:49] disconnect praise the
[1:04:52] Lord so Jesus came to to brid their
[1:04:56] back he came to bridge death
[1:05:00] back are we
[1:05:02] together are we
[1:05:05] together do you see how people can sit
[1:05:09] down believe the message for many years
[1:05:12] and walk away and say it is not the
[1:05:15] truth all because of the
[1:05:19] disconnect and sometime the disconnect
[1:05:21] is now with the is is now with the Bible
[1:05:25] because this this this Bible this word
[1:05:27] of God remain truth
[1:05:30] amen it remain
[1:05:34] truth but it's just at that place there
[1:05:37] our our our human tendency our falling
[1:05:44] nature cannot come to submit under the
[1:05:48] word to be
[1:05:53] kill that Fallen nature do not want to
[1:05:56] die that there sep seed because whether
[1:06:00] we believe it or not uh uh we have a
[1:06:03] mixture
[1:06:05] amen a mix between sep and uh the SE and
[1:06:09] Eve that's what breed this body of house
[1:06:12] amen so uh uh so there but then listen
[1:06:16] here Nicodemus said unto
[1:06:20] him how can a man be born when he is
[1:06:28] old can he enter the second time into
[1:06:33] his mother's womb and be
[1:06:37] born praise the Lord can he enter the
[1:06:41] second
[1:06:43] time into his mother's
[1:06:45] womb and be born how can a man be born
[1:06:50] again
[1:06:55] praise the Lord now he's a rotor of the
[1:06:58] Lord he's a he's a he's a strip as a
[1:07:01] scallet a man uh when it talk about the
[1:07:04] ruler of the Lord you know uh they were
[1:07:07] the men that steud they steud the
[1:07:13] Torah that language he could not he
[1:07:15] could not connect it to the Torah there
[1:07:17] was nothing in the Torah that that he
[1:07:19] could really connect it to to explain to
[1:07:23] him about a new birth
[1:07:28] praise the Lord but he says
[1:07:31] something he says something and that's
[1:07:34] what I want to dwell
[1:07:36] on you know you you start to talk about
[1:07:39] the New Birth uh uh uh you know uh every
[1:07:44] one of us can be able to pull up our
[1:07:46] carard tonight and explain if I should
[1:07:49] start from uh God's way tonight and then
[1:07:52] just go everybody can be able to say to
[1:07:54] me tonight what the thing what the think
[1:07:56] the new birth is and none of you will be
[1:07:58] wrong but I'm not going to talk about
[1:08:00] the New Birth tonight I want to talk
[1:08:04] about going
[1:08:07] back
[1:08:10] into his mother's wom that's what he
[1:08:14] said to his
[1:08:17] understanding he said how can a man be
[1:08:20] born when he's
[1:08:21] old do he have to go back into his so so
[1:08:25] this is this is where I want I want for
[1:08:27] us to to pay attention because with all
[1:08:31] that we know and all that we can say the
[1:08:34] new birth
[1:08:36] is one of the thing that we do every one
[1:08:39] of us do we we take the new
[1:08:44] birth with the understanding of our
[1:08:47] natural
[1:08:51] birth praise the
[1:08:53] Lord amen and that that's what nicodemo
[1:08:56] was doing do I need to go back to my
[1:08:59] mother's home to be born
[1:09:01] again do I need to experience another
[1:09:05] natural
[1:09:09] birth and many of the times that's what
[1:09:11] we do because how do we do
[1:09:15] it we look at our natural
[1:09:19] life to be able to tell how much we are
[1:09:22] born again
[1:09:26] are you understanding what I'm saying we
[1:09:27] look at our natural life I mean if we
[1:09:30] are on fire we are praying you know what
[1:09:32] the joy of the Lord is my strength you
[1:09:34] know you you you have an evidence that
[1:09:36] you are born
[1:09:38] again but sometimes when you have trials
[1:09:41] and things are going on in your life and
[1:09:43] and and you question yourself am I
[1:09:45] really born again what what are you
[1:09:47] doing you are doing just like necro
[1:09:49] demon say praise the Lord you are
[1:09:52] expecting yourself to go back into the
[1:09:54] womb to be born a new why because you
[1:09:58] are looking at your physical
[1:10:03] tendency to believe that you are born
[1:10:06] again because know at this you I get no
[1:10:08] evil thought so I think I'm born again
[1:10:10] when it come again why I really don't
[1:10:11] know if I'm born
[1:10:17] again are we
[1:10:20] together how can a
[1:10:23] man how can a man
[1:10:26] be
[1:10:27] born when he is
[1:10:30] old how can a man be born when he is
[1:10:37] old can he enter the second time into
[1:10:40] his mother's womb to be
[1:10:43] born and that's exactly what the church
[1:10:47] has been doing all of these years we
[1:10:50] have been going right back into the
[1:10:53] mother organization War
[1:10:59] praise the
[1:11:00] Lord oh that's that that's not how I
[1:11:02] believe it that's not how my church
[1:11:04] taught
[1:11:06] it in our church this is the way we used
[1:11:09] to you are going right back to your old
[1:11:12] womb you see because that is said even
[1:11:15] with the natural
[1:11:16] birth of the
[1:11:19] baby are you comfortable
[1:11:21] tonight amen are you okay tonight praise
[1:11:26] Lord even with the
[1:11:30] baby one time the the womb was the mo
[1:11:34] most comfortable place for the
[1:11:38] baby as that little baby
[1:11:42] grow in her mother's home she begins to
[1:11:47] know get a sense of everything in that
[1:11:51] atmosphere as she
[1:11:53] grows praise the Lord
[1:11:56] amen it's almost like when you grow in a
[1:12:00] church you you know the pastor you know
[1:12:02] when he will come praise the Lord you
[1:12:04] know which way he come from you know his
[1:12:06] favorite song you know you know you know
[1:12:08] you know you know why because you grow
[1:12:10] up in that
[1:12:12] church you grow up in that family you
[1:12:16] grow up in that Community you know
[1:12:19] everything about that Community when you
[1:12:22] move to the next place you say I'm I all
[1:12:25] place that's not the way they used to do
[1:12:26] it you are not in your old
[1:12:31] place amen when things starts to happen
[1:12:34] What do we do we want to go
[1:12:37] back do I need to go
[1:12:40] back that's what necod demon is saying
[1:12:43] and that is the thing that has handled
[1:12:46] our walk with
[1:12:48] God and I will say it and say it loud to
[1:12:51] you
[1:12:52] tonight that this message of the power
[1:12:56] is not to produce
[1:13:00] Pentecost
[1:13:03] no it's not to produce
[1:13:11] Pentecost are we
[1:13:13] together amen why because why I say that
[1:13:18] because you see when we read the book of
[1:13:20] Acts when we read the book of Acts that
[1:13:23] was the birth of the church
[1:13:26] Church all the the the apostles they
[1:13:29] prayed together in one ACC call you know
[1:13:31] they were they were in one ACC call you
[1:13:33] know the the the the the the they bring
[1:13:35] all their things and lay at the Apostle
[1:13:37] feet you know while they and then what
[1:13:40] is in our mind that was the beginning of
[1:13:43] the church so every Church Must Go will
[1:13:46] be going back to the to the
[1:13:51] womb but what did the prophet said he
[1:13:54] said we will
[1:13:56] write another book of Acts now that we
[1:14:00] will go back to the book of Acts no we
[1:14:04] will
[1:14:05] write another book of
[1:14:07] Acts because if we stay with the message
[1:14:11] the same holy ghost that came on the
[1:14:13] date of Pentecost is with
[1:14:18] us are we
[1:14:21] together so we're not going back to to
[1:14:25] to to Pentecost Acts chapter 2 no Acts
[1:14:28] chapter 2 is a stepping stone to birth
[1:14:31] us into a new
[1:14:36] experience are we together
[1:14:41] amen and that's one of the things that
[1:14:44] that that that that that that that
[1:14:46] handle the people All Through the
[1:14:50] Ages we having the very same problem
[1:14:53] that necod demon is having
[1:14:59] praise the Lord amen we have the very
[1:15:02] same problem because y said that we we
[1:15:04] we we we we believe that uh I mean that
[1:15:07] the disciples they repented they were
[1:15:09] baptized in Jesus name they reive the
[1:15:11] gift of the Holy Ghost you know and and
[1:15:13] and and and and and they started
[1:15:15] performing
[1:15:18] Miracles we we believe in Jesus we
[1:15:20] baptize in jesus' name you know uh uh uh
[1:15:23] uh we we receive the holy because so in
[1:15:26] our mind
[1:15:30] now we must be playing out the same
[1:15:39] thing praise the
[1:15:43] Lord many of
[1:15:46] us the way we think about the New
[1:15:50] Birth is the way we understand the
[1:15:53] natural birth
[1:15:58] to us when when my Mama gave birth to
[1:16:03] me I was
[1:16:05] born praise the Lord I was
[1:16:09] born and uh in in a in a natural sense
[1:16:15] in a natural
[1:16:16] sense I have a birth
[1:16:19] date praise the lord it's coming us soon
[1:16:23] anyway October 1st I have a
[1:16:26] birthdaye praise the Lord
[1:16:29] amen that's my
[1:16:34] birthdaye well let's let's read
[1:16:36] something I will tie that together
[1:16:39] tonight I will I'll leave you at 9:00 we
[1:16:42] have a service on Saturday night so I
[1:16:45] shouldn't keep you longer I try to leave
[1:16:47] you at 9:00 I send just a quote up there
[1:16:51] if uh our sister will help me put that
[1:16:53] up tonight
[1:16:55] the angel of the
[1:16:57] Lord praise the
[1:16:59] Lord
[1:17:05] amen can we read the first phrase
[1:17:09] together the new birth is an
[1:17:15] experiened praise the
[1:17:17] Lord and if you look all through brother
[1:17:20] Brandon
[1:17:22] message he make an emphasis how the new
[1:17:25] birth is an
[1:17:28] experience let me bring it to you this
[1:17:31] way I have my birthday the day I was
[1:17:36] born is that the only experience I will
[1:17:39] have in my
[1:17:45] life you you understood my
[1:17:47] question but I didn't hear no
[1:17:52] answer praise the Lord
[1:17:58] after
[1:17:59] after my birthday or after your birthday
[1:18:03] is that the only experience you
[1:18:08] have is the
[1:18:11] beginning praise the
[1:18:15] Lord when you start to sit is an
[1:18:20] experience so that experience of sitting
[1:18:25] can you call it a birth if you call it a
[1:18:28] birth will you be making
[1:18:34] sense why the reason why you would not
[1:18:38] call it a birth because you attached
[1:18:40] birth to the
[1:18:42] womb when the prophet said birth is an
[1:18:48] experience you see you be we we behaving
[1:18:51] just like necod demons you will not call
[1:18:53] that a birth because you only attach
[1:18:56] birth to the
[1:19:01] womb the birth that is attached to the
[1:19:03] womb is natural birth the new birth a
[1:19:08] prophet say is what
[1:19:12] experience so do that means that every
[1:19:15] experience you have in your Christian
[1:19:18] Life is a
[1:19:19] birth does that means
[1:19:23] that praise Lord are you
[1:19:33] afraid praise the lord it's a test where
[1:19:37] nobody fails okay nobody fails so don't
[1:19:40] be
[1:19:42] afraid don't be afraid to be wrong
[1:19:44] nobody
[1:19:46] fails amen you already passed before you
[1:19:49] were
[1:19:52] tested are we together
[1:19:55] but do you see where I'm coming from are
[1:19:58] you understanding what I'm driving to
[1:20:04] tonight because that is the
[1:20:08] disconnect that is the problem with the
[1:20:11] Christian church we keep going back and
[1:20:15] brother brandham said it's it's it's an
[1:20:17] unclean Spirit he said it's it's an
[1:20:20] unclean Spirit the three unclean Spirit
[1:20:23] from the book of Acts those Spirit of
[1:20:26] frogs he says uh he says that's that's
[1:20:28] what it is he said that's a spirit that
[1:20:30] is that is on the church that's the
[1:20:32] reason why the church never keeps her
[1:20:38] Victory why because she keeps going
[1:20:43] back praise the Lord if if the night she
[1:20:46] gave her heart to the Lord she cry oh
[1:20:49] she cried and and and she she just cried
[1:20:52] she will cry uncontrollably and and and
[1:20:55] and all the joy of the Lord just fill
[1:20:58] her heart that she want to keep
[1:21:00] experiencing that same thing every day
[1:21:02] every day every day every day that baby
[1:21:06] will never
[1:21:08] grow that baby will never
[1:21:14] grow no we must grow from experience to
[1:21:21] experience we must be Experiencing God
[1:21:24] in New ways in our
[1:21:32] life praise the Lord the same thing that
[1:21:35] happened to the church
[1:21:37] organization when Luther came out the J
[1:21:39] shall live by faith it was a birth
[1:21:42] because it was an experience of
[1:21:44] justification it was a move of God but
[1:21:47] what happened the same old thing she
[1:21:49] went right back to her mother's wom went
[1:21:52] back to the Catholic system and every
[1:21:54] time the church goes back it denominates
[1:21:58] every time you go back you
[1:22:05] denominate because what they what they
[1:22:07] prophesied the pillow of fire keep
[1:22:10] moving and he want to carry us from one
[1:22:13] experience look at the walk with the
[1:22:15] children of Israel in the wilderness God
[1:22:17] never kept them one
[1:22:20] place they were going from one
[1:22:22] experience to another experience
[1:22:25] and what were they Desiring go back to
[1:22:29] Egypt they wanted to go back to their
[1:22:32] mother's wom why because they were
[1:22:34] comfortable with
[1:22:36] Egypt Egypt was a comfort zone for them
[1:22:39] they know where to go and get a garlic
[1:22:40] they know where to go and get the bread
[1:22:42] they know where to go and get the
[1:22:45] onions this other place is a new place
[1:22:48] we don't even understand anything here I
[1:22:50] mean everything they do in this church
[1:22:51] is different and I mean it's not like
[1:22:53] our church it would never be in your
[1:22:55] church if a child was just going to stay
[1:22:58] in the
[1:22:58] womb that all it would knows it would
[1:23:02] never speak human language because it's
[1:23:04] just in the
[1:23:11] womb and that's the thing that is that
[1:23:13] is that that that's the trouble for the
[1:23:15] church because the people God used to
[1:23:18] theas Creed blessing the the moving of
[1:23:21] God the speaking of tongues and prophecy
[1:23:23] and all of that Propet comes and he
[1:23:25] starts to bring the word so we don't
[1:23:27] know that all of these years we've been
[1:23:29] taught Adam and Eve ate
[1:23:31] apple and he's coming he's saying this
[1:23:33] who is he that's the very same thing
[1:23:36] that Nicodemus and his men were
[1:23:40] doing and that's the very thing the
[1:23:43] church keeps doing on and on and
[1:23:49] on that's why today we think we get the
[1:23:51] victory tomorrow we lost it because you
[1:23:54] know
[1:23:55] in Liberia in our church man when we
[1:23:57] come together for church in Liberia I
[1:24:00] mean let me tell you don't know I know
[1:24:01] what you're doing your in
[1:24:07] liia you understand what I'm talking
[1:24:13] about and as long as you stay that way
[1:24:16] you are not going anywhere you keep
[1:24:19] living in the
[1:24:21] past the presence is not real to you
[1:24:25] you are not real to the environment that
[1:24:27] is around you you know you are not even
[1:24:30] understanding what God is doing why
[1:24:32] because you are living in a dead past
[1:24:36] the past is dead that's what the
[1:24:38] scripture says living those things in
[1:24:41] the past let's press onto the mark of
[1:24:43] the High
[1:24:47] Calling that's what the scripture
[1:24:51] says people that make the past their
[1:24:54] Heroes your hero is
[1:24:57] dead you make the future of your hero he
[1:24:59] has not come
[1:25:01] yet so you are
[1:25:09] dead are we
[1:25:12] together love the Lord
[1:25:19] tonight am I making
[1:25:21] sense is a picture coming together
[1:25:27] amen because that's the way we associate
[1:25:31] birth the moment you talk about
[1:25:35] birth is associated with warb in the
[1:25:39] natural
[1:25:41] sense praise the
[1:25:44] Lord in the natural sense
[1:25:58] glory be to God
[1:26:01] Amen so when a person is uh is is is is
[1:26:06] orthodox and think that every birth must
[1:26:09] must be birth from the
[1:26:11] womb and the year that this little child
[1:26:16] was placed in the incubator this starts
[1:26:19] to feel
[1:26:20] funny because the way you understand
[1:26:24] birath it must be a
[1:26:26] womb so now in your
[1:26:29] mind you starts to feel
[1:26:35] funny praise the Lord
[1:26:39] amen yeah because when you stay when you
[1:26:42] stay to those to those old ideas you
[1:26:46] don't
[1:26:50] appreciate what God is doing in the
[1:26:52] present times
[1:26:55] praise the
[1:26:58] Lord you don't appreciate
[1:27:14] it oh my my my my you love the
[1:27:19] Lord let's let's let's let's go back to
[1:27:22] that code that's the only one I have
[1:27:23] tonight I bring the rest of them as time
[1:27:26] goes on
[1:27:27] Amen I have I have bunch of subject
[1:27:30] lining up that I've never finished and
[1:27:32] I'm starting the new
[1:27:38] one but it's
[1:27:40] okay I we'll pick it up as we go along
[1:27:44] love the
[1:27:45] Lord the new birth is an
[1:27:51] experience it's a gift of God
[1:27:56] is the
[1:27:57] Seal of your
[1:28:00] faith the Holy Ghost is a
[1:28:03] seal Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the
[1:28:07] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:28:10] sealed until the day of your
[1:28:13] Redemption God made Abraham a
[1:28:18] promise and Abraham believed God what
[1:28:22] was the promise that God made Abraham
[1:28:25] I make you a father of
[1:28:26] nation I'll take you to a land who maker
[1:28:29] and Builder is
[1:28:32] God but do you know that
[1:28:35] God gave Abraham three
[1:28:39] birth he had to come out of his
[1:28:44] Kindred
[1:28:46] amen he had to come out of his Nation
[1:28:55] he had to come out of his his father
[1:28:58] house if we want to call it that way we
[1:29:01] we sh with three way we can be able to
[1:29:02] place
[1:29:04] it so so all of those things that
[1:29:08] Abraham had to come out
[1:29:12] of if you take it in the
[1:29:16] Natural Life
[1:29:18] sense it was an
[1:29:20] environment that he live in
[1:29:25] it was an environment that he lived
[1:29:29] in and he was
[1:29:31] comfortable and that
[1:29:33] environment was a warm for
[1:29:38] him because it kept him he
[1:29:44] survived but yet God told him to come
[1:29:47] out to be
[1:29:51] birth praise the Lord
[1:29:54] amen so you see the church can relate a
[1:29:59] new
[1:30:01] birth to Christian
[1:30:04] experience but
[1:30:06] yet their old traditional ideas can be
[1:30:10] hindering them from experiencing what
[1:30:14] they are birthed to they gave their life
[1:30:16] to Jesus they accepting as their lord
[1:30:19] and savior but their
[1:30:22] Traditions the the way they were grown
[1:30:24] the way they were taught the things that
[1:30:26] is in their
[1:30:27] mind is hening them for enjoying this
[1:30:31] blessing because they they are those
[1:30:33] they are stay in the womb of how things
[1:30:36] were done back
[1:30:41] there that's why the church couldn't
[1:30:43] move on with the
[1:30:46] Revival praise the
[1:30:50] lord it's almost like they were lost
[1:30:54] Luther said the judge shall live by
[1:30:56] faith let's go back to the Bible and and
[1:30:58] leave this Latin language of of of of
[1:31:01] the Roman Catholic church we are just
[1:31:02] speaking Latin we can't even understand
[1:31:04] what we are talking
[1:31:07] about and the church comes
[1:31:12] out they are lost like brother Bram says
[1:31:15] he says that baby comes out and it's
[1:31:17] it's realized oh wow there's a lot of
[1:31:20] space here oh wow
[1:31:24] glory be to God is kicking his
[1:31:29] leg why she's having an
[1:31:33] experience she's experiencing a new
[1:31:38] environment she get a lot of room now to
[1:31:40] move
[1:31:44] around glory be to God while she was in
[1:31:47] that womb she never thought that she
[1:31:49] could
[1:31:50] walk because she was just curved in the
[1:31:53] womb
[1:31:55] but here say she's
[1:31:59] birth and when she look at the Ultra
[1:32:01] sign said what was that
[1:32:04] me praise the Lord come come come come
[1:32:08] and see me come and see me but she
[1:32:11] couldn't do that when she was in the
[1:32:15] womb and that's what happened when we
[1:32:18] stay in the womb of our old ideas old
[1:32:21] church creates
[1:32:29] you will never be able to enjoy the
[1:32:31] things you are birth
[1:32:33] into praise the Lord when a prophet of
[1:32:36] God said you never did it the first
[1:32:38] place it will just become a slog for you
[1:32:40] you don't understand that because you
[1:32:42] are stay in a warm of where you got to
[1:32:44] work your way to Salvation you got to
[1:32:46] show works it never become real to
[1:32:50] you because you are stay in that ideas
[1:32:55] of the old church the way it's supposed
[1:32:56] to be
[1:33:06] done every preacher bringing the church
[1:33:09] back to their old
[1:33:12] womb the other preacher said that's the
[1:33:14] way that that's the new birth this the
[1:33:15] new birth is
[1:33:17] this he still caught up in his old
[1:33:19] denominational ideas
[1:33:25] praise the lord we must preach and make
[1:33:27] the people feel
[1:33:30] bad then then the message is
[1:33:33] Anointed when the gospel is to set them
[1:33:37] free what kind of for people that are
[1:33:40] free Fe bad this world makes you

[1:33:50] so beat down on our head to even say the
[1:33:52] amen we got to be begging for

[1:39:27] haunted in our mind no Lord God when
[1:39:31] necod demon went that night it troubled
[1:39:33] him Lord Born Again born again what did
[1:39:36] he
[1:39:37] mean what did he mean he's talking about
[1:39:40] born of the water born of the
[1:39:43] spirit he's thinking about
[1:39:47] it and yeah the disconnect is there he
[1:39:50] can't connect he can't connect to that
[1:39:55] because it's not a natural
[1:39:57] birth it's not a natural
[1:40:00] birth oh dear
[1:40:03] God
[1:40:05] father I know even Lord your
[1:40:09] people could be thinking different in
[1:40:11] your mind tonight Minds could be going
[1:40:14] from here there Lord and up y
[1:40:17] father but Lord
[1:40:20] God I believe that's what your Prophet
[1:40:22] man when he he says after the seals were
[1:40:25] open the Bible became a new
[1:40:27] book they bringing us to more
[1:40:31] reality than
[1:40:34] Traditions father I pray to God May that
[1:40:38] Spirit birth upon this church
[1:40:40] Lord because Lord the reality of your
[1:40:43] word it takes fear away from us it takes
[1:40:47] doubt away it takes condemnation away
[1:40:49] from our
[1:40:51] heart because we know Lord Jesus
[1:40:54] Jesus we keep falling in love with you
[1:40:57] you keep taking us Lord from one
[1:40:59] experience to
[1:41:01] another oh God I pray father that even
[1:41:05] this weekend Lord you will give us Lord
[1:41:07] another
[1:41:08] experience when we when we are connected
[1:41:11] back to that place Lord when we are
[1:41:14] connected back oh God to our original
[1:41:18] identity then we can say like d David
[1:41:22] our glad when he said unto me let's go
[1:41:24] into the house of the Lord we want to
[1:41:27] hear the word we want to be in your
[1:41:29] presence Lord because oh God the word
[1:41:32] brings rejoicing you speak to our hearts
[1:41:34] Lord even even in a sense of correction
[1:41:37] we can lift our hands and say thank you
[1:41:39] Lord you called my name you spoke to me
[1:41:43] you corrected me
[1:42:03] father if there is one thing that we
[1:42:05] must be angry about is the life of sin
[1:42:10] oh God like David said we must hit it
[1:42:13] with perfect hatred we must hit sin Lord
[1:42:17] if the preacher cry out to God he must
[1:42:19] cry out against sin we have no reason to
[1:42:22] be angry with with your children we have
[1:42:24] no reason to God to be chasing them down
[1:42:27] and shaming them and condemning them but
[1:42:29] we must preach the Lord of Libor we must
[1:42:32] preach the word that will bring
[1:42:33] conviction that Lord they can be
[1:42:36] thankful that you corrected them
[1:42:38] thankful Lord that you spoke to their
[1:42:40] heart thankful that you rebuked
[1:42:44] them but he will take that connection
[1:42:46] Lord and only you can give it even
[1:42:49] Nicodemus a ruler of the Lord he
[1:42:52] couldn't see it
[1:42:54] do I have to go back to my mother's
