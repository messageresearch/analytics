========================================
[Music] so he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and his holy angels he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment this is actually a repetition of verse 4 wherein has made reference to the few who have not defiled their garments we used to have a saying years ago that no doubt was taken from this verse it was keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it now god is going to reward those who follow this advice they are going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white peter james and john saw him on mount transfiguration and his clothes were as white as light that is how the saints are going to be clothed their garments will be shining exceedingly white you know we are living in the end time it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you will lose all those who stay true to god and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve god within the framework of the antichrist beast system they will give in to the flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the judgment they will all be found naked they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with god it is time to wake up and hear the voice of god crying come out of her organized religion my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that ye receive not of her plagues amen god is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance and the blood of the lamb but do it now for tomorrow may be too late and he that overcometh i will not blot out his name out of the book of life once again we come to a most difficult portion of the word this verse superficially regarded will be used by both the armenians and the calvinists to suit their purposes the armenians will declare that this verse assuredly annulles john 6 37-44 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day armenianism makes the will of the father not a sovereign purpose but merely a complacent desire as he stands back to see what all men do with his good and gracious gifts and even life eternal the calvinists do not see that they see in this verse strong consolation given to the suffering burdened saints that no matter how evil are the times how terrible the persecution because the overcomer is one who believeth that jesus is the christ he will not have his name removed from that book some also say that this book of life is not the lamb's book of life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of god deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that god places the names of those born again within the lamb's book of life at the time of their rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed the space on the record will simply be a blank as it was before a name had been placed there this is one hundred percent opposite to what the word actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that god is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly also it is not a question of simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had opportunity to receive eternal life or in one group received it and had their names placed on record while the others who refused did not have their names so placed we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who are not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it is certainly true we will also show that there is a group of people whose names having been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed but will also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the lamb's book of life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the lamb's book of life or christ's book of life or even thy book and book of the living only names are written in it revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon earth shall worship him the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 17 8 the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is revelation 20 12-15 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of all those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you can see that though there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in the revelation it is called the lamb's book of life or the book of life now where is this book located luke 10 17-24 and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject to us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them the book of life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white throne judgment in these verses jesus said that their names were written in heaven they were written in the book of life for that is where names are placed jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was also speaking to the 12 23. these had all been rejoicing that devils were subject to them in jesus name christ's rejoinder was rejoice not that spirits are subject to you but rather that your names are written in heaven book of life you will note here that judas was one of those who were casting out devils in jesus name but we know that he was a devil the son of perdition john 6 70-71 jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve john 17 12 while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled john 13 10-11 and 18 jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean i speak not of you all and i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now if language means anything at all we must admit that judas was chosen by jesus john 13 18 yet he was not clean john 13 10-11 judas was also given to jesus by the father john 17 12 let it be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of moses and pharaoh jacob and esau for though esau and pharaoh were both foreknown they were predestinated to wrath while the end of moses and jacob was glorification first peter 2 8-9 a shows both reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to pentecost acts 1 16-17 men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry the part that judas obtained amongst the twelve and then lost was neither inferior to the ministries of the other eleven nor was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others acts 1 25 that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even in the book of life but his name was blotted out now before we pursue this thought on judas let us go back to the old testament and see where god did the same thing in genesis 35 23-26 the sons of jacob were twelve in number and their names were as follows reuben simeon levi judah issachar and zebulun joseph and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher these twelve sons descendants became the twelve tribes of israel with the exception that joseph did not have a tribe named after him for in the province of god there were to be thirteen tribes and joseph's two sons were given the honor of bringing the twelve to thirteen you know of course that this was necessary as levi was separated unto god for the priesthood thus when israel left egypt and god gave them the tabernacle in the wilderness we find the tribe of levi ministering to 12 tribes named ruben simeon issachar judah zebulun benjamin dan naphtali gad asher ephraim and manasseh the order of the host names them thus in numbers 10 11-28 there is no mention of joseph or levi but when we look at revelation 7 4 through 8 where it says there were sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel it names them thus judah reuben dad asher naphtali manasseh simeon levi issachar zebulun joseph benjamin we are back to the twelve tribes with levi and joseph named amongst them but with dan and ephraim missing the question now arises why are these two tribes deleted the answer lies in deuteronomy 29 16-20 for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which he passed by and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations blessed there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven herein is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out and the history of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry is found in first kings twelve twenty five through thirty then jeroboam built sheikham and mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david if this people go up and do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee out of the land of egypt and he set the one in bethel and the other one he put in dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan hosea 4 17 ephraim is joined to his idols let him alone note particularly that the punishment for idolatry was that the name of that tribe was to be blotted out from under heaven deuteronomy 29 20. it does not say that it would be blotted out in heaven but from under heaven and that is exactly as it is for now israel is back in palestine and soon the lord will seal 144 000 of them but from that number dan and ephraim are missing revelation 7 4 through 8 and i heard the number of them that were sealed and there were sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel of the tribe of judah were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of asher were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of naftalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manassas were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of zebulun were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand note dan and ephraim are missing now with this see daniel 12 1 which refers to these 144 000 being sealed during the sixth seal and the time of the great tribulation or jacob's trouble and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book however after this period of tribulation during the millennium as seen by ezekiel in 48 1-8 and 22-29 we see the tribes back once more in divine order but from the time that ephraim and dan joined themselves to idols they died and those tribes have no more recognition now i realize that since the destruction of jerusalem all records of all tribes have been lost so that no one can say for sure what tribe he is from but god knows that great god who is bringing israel back to palestine knows exactly which tribe every true israelite is from and from all the assembled 144 000 dan and ephraim will be missing here are the tribes of israel ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22-29 now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of hethlon as one goeth to hameth hazarinen the border of damascus northward to the coast of hameth for these are his sides east and west a portion for dan and by the border of dan from the east side onto the west side a portion for asher and by the border of asher from the east side even onto the west side a portion for naphtali and by the border of naphtali from the east side onto the west side a portion for manasseh and by the border of manasseh from the east side onto the west side a portion for ephraim and by the border of ephraim from the east side even on to the west side a portion for reuben and by the border of ruben from the east side onto the west side a portion for judah and by the border of judah from the east side onto the west side etc moreover from the possession of the here are the tribes of israel ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22-29 now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of hethlon as one goeth to hameth hazarinan the border of damascus northward to the coast of hameth for these are his sides east and west a portion for dan and by the border of dan from the east side onto the west side a portion for asher and by the border of asher from the east side even onto the west side a portion for naphtali and by the border of naftali from the east side onto the west side a portion for manasseh and by the border of manasseh from the east side onto the west side a portion for ephraim and by the border of ephraim from the east side even onto the west side a portion for reuben and by the border of ruben from the east side unto the west side a portion for judah and by the border of judah from the east side onto the west side etc moreover from the possession of the levites and from the possession of the city being in the midst of that which is the princes between the border of judah and the border of benjamin shall be for the prince as for the rest of the tribes from the east side unto the west side benjamin shall have a portion and by the border of benjamin from the east side unto the west side simeon shall have a portion and by the border of simeon from the east side to the west side issachar apportioned and by the border of issachar from the east side onto the west side zebulun apportioned and by the border of zebulun from the east side on to the west side gad apportioned and by the border of gad at the south side southward etc another illustration that we might take is the story of israel leaving egypt for canaan land god's purpose in this age was to bring israel out and to take them in to the end that they might serve him thus when they left egypt they all came out under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all went through the waters of baptism in the red sea they all enjoyed the mighty miracles all eight of the manna all drank of the rock and insofar as obvious external blessings and manifestations were concerned they all partook in like and equal manner but when they came to moab those who joined in the feast of baal peor all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of god and turned from it now this is what hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of which was brought out so carefully in the pergamian age you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word there are people who seem involved in the things of god almost 100 percent they are like judas no one but jesus knew exactly what kind of a person judas was so the day came that judas did exactly what israel did at bail pior he decided that he wanted to join with the false vine forces enter into the financial political organization of anti-word anti-christ religion and he did so he was fooled the other eleven were not they could not be for they were of the very elect so when judas left and betrayed the lord his name was removed from the book of life revelation 22 19 now i am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in the book of life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true god and worship of him though they did not worship according to truth word like judas they didn't go all the way see how judas was chosen of god he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life [Music] you
