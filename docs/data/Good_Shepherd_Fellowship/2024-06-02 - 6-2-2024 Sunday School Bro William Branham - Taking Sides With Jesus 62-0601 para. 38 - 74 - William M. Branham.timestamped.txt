[4:12] well if I thought that there was a
[4:16] denomination or any other group of
[4:18] Believers that had anything better than
[4:22] we have here Brethren I would I want to
[4:26] emerge this little body with it right
[4:28] quick I waited I have longed I have been
[4:32] under anticipations and believe that
[4:35] some great one was coming someday maybe
[4:38] the great prophet that a speak will come
[4:41] of the Elijah I've always believed and
[4:44] thought maybe that maybe I'd live to see
[4:47] the day that when I could change when
[4:49] I'd see that person rise on the scene
[4:52] then I could take my little church and
[4:54] say Brethren this is the man we have
[4:57] looked for this man he is the on I've
[5:00] waited for that and if actually that has
[5:05] passed then I'm looking to say it from
[5:07] up here Brethren this is the one coming
[5:11] from here see and uh I want to see the
[5:14] church kept up like that I must have
[5:17] stepped on something or done something
[5:19] and put a lot of uh more uh life in that
[5:22] thing so um now I would like to say this
[5:28] that now that this is an established
[5:31] church let me just stop again just a
[5:33] moment when I went to Bombay I count
[5:37] that my greatest meeting because of the
[5:40] effects it had on the people and I if in
[5:44] Africa they say 30,000 came to Christ at
[5:47] one time then there was 150 or 200,000
[5:51] came to Christ at one time out of about
[5:53] half a million
[5:54] there what could I do there wasn't a
[5:58] thing perhaps maybe say there was just
[6:00] say there's 100,000 of them there was no
[6:03] church nothing I could do there's nobody
[6:05] to give to them the message I believe I
[6:08] there wasn't even a Pentecostal
[6:10] denomination would cooperate with me and
[6:12] all those Souls probably drifted right
[6:14] back into seeks Jans Buddhism whatever
[6:17] more they come from no place to put them
[6:21] now that's a shame yeah that's a
[6:24] disgrace see because I had no
[6:26] cooperation because of the stand that I
[6:28] take
[6:30] well in Africa I went in there under
[6:33] that oaces of the uh
[6:37] the AF ofm and African Faith missions
[6:42] and what I did of course I can't agree
[6:44] with them they they baptize people in a
[6:47] trium baptism three times face forward
[6:49] and one of them baptizes three times
[6:51] backwards one for one God the Father
[6:53] other for another God the son the other
[6:55] for another God the Holy Ghost and
[6:57] baptizing three different times for
[6:59] three different gods and all such stuff
[7:02] as that and perhaps the Durban
[7:05] meeting not having it rightly and the
[7:08] people see such a scattered amongst the
[7:10] Pentecostal faiths and so forth the
[7:12] people didn't know what to do they had
[7:14] no place to
[7:15] go perhaps what if we just had a Revival
[7:18] here brotherr let me place it like this
[7:20] what if we just got through with a big
[7:22] Revival and you Brethren had just got
[7:23] converted and there wasn't a church of
[7:25] this type in the country nowhere and
[7:27] I've been the Evangelist and now I'm
[7:28] leaving out you may never see me
[7:31] again what would you do you'd feel like
[7:35] you wouldn't know what to do you can't
[7:37] go back to that Waller again you can't
[7:40] go back down there with uh with your
[7:42] wives to wear shorts and your and uh to
[7:46] your card parties and dances and things
[7:49] like that and ever be satisfied again
[7:51] you've come to life you've raised above
[7:54] that thing you've come to a place
[7:57] instead of saying this is our Creed
[7:59] saying this is God's word and you've
[8:02] come to live by this what this says and
[8:05] not what and you go down there and
[8:06] listen to them and hear them go down
[8:08] play bunk hole and have a dance and this
[8:10] that and the other a little bit of
[8:12] message that had nothing in it about
[8:13] some mayor or something or was going to
[8:15] be reelected or some kind of a political
[8:18] Affair and cut off in 10 or 15 minutes
[8:20] after you've been sitting here day after
[8:22] day in great gastronomical jubilees of
[8:25] the word and things you wouldn't know
[8:26] what to do you'd be so burdened with it
[8:29] that some of you lay members would feel
[8:31] like starting up a church and start
[8:33] preaching it yourself because your heart
[8:35] would burn for the word of God and you'd
[8:38] feel bad for the people that felt the
[8:40] same way you did isn't that right though
[8:43] you know Jesus is coming thought he was
[8:45] coming tomorrow yet you'd want to do
[8:47] something today for those people who are
[8:49] fellow citizens of the kingdom of God to
[8:52] come together you want fellowship with
[8:53] them that's right so if it's this way uh
[8:59] I believe with all my heart that the
[9:03] Lord has helped me and has used me to
[9:06] spearhead a great Revival one of the
[9:09] greatest that's ever struck the world
[9:10] since the early days across the world we
[9:12] know that that's right it's all gone at
[9:15] that time and and he met me down there
[9:17] on the river and told me that the
[9:20] message that I had would forerun the
[9:22] second coming of Christ and I suppose
[9:25] there's nobody here tonight that was
[9:27] down there that day that's been 32 years
[9:30] ago when that light appeared and
[9:32] standing there me looking right at it
[9:34] hundreds of people standing looking at
[9:36] it he come right down and that Bo spoke
[9:38] years later strains at the camera takes
[9:41] the same picture looks the same thing
[9:42] just exactly what I told you down the
[9:44] river now I may be mistaken in a lot of
[9:46] things Brethren but I don't want to be a
[9:48] hypocrite I want to be honest and
[9:50] straight with you and then another
[9:54] thing if I have went away what would
[9:57] would have never build a church here
[9:58] like that it's hard to tell what would
[9:59] had see if I just went on but the god of
[10:02] Heaven put it up on my heart to build
[10:04] this church here and then when he called
[10:07] me out into evangelism we've had Pastor
[10:09] after pastor and so forth but now we got
[10:13] a a precious brother here who's uh of
[10:16] the faith believes a message we've got
[10:20] other brothers out here that's believes
[10:22] a message having fa am I getting too
[10:24] loud brother
[10:25] beer all right let's see um have uh we
[10:30] got we got the
[10:33] material and now you say well brother
[10:35] brandom if they want hear these signs
[10:38] and wonders of the great God Of Heaven
[10:40] how we going to do it well now what if
[10:43] St Paul would have had that same idea
[10:45] see what but they didn't those Bishops
[10:49] stayed just as loyal to the message and
[10:53] they and Paul ever so often after making
[10:56] his round you read the Bible how you
[10:58] visit back with these churches
[10:59] talk with the pastors and with the
[11:01] Bishops and so forth and took uh relief
[11:05] from the people and and had a oh just a
[11:08] great time of Fellowship like a Revival
[11:10] or a big time of Jubilee and the Holy
[11:12] Spirit would fall upon them and messages
[11:15] to come look when he went down there to
[11:17] Philip even his daughters prophesied and
[11:19] said these chains and prison waiting for
[11:21] the for our brother when he gets up
[11:23] there you no more and got out in the
[11:24] yard and here come acus a prophet
[11:26] walking down looked across the street
[11:28] and never seen seen Paul before the
[11:30] general overseer this whole group of
[11:33] churches throughout Asia and he walked
[11:35] there and pulled the string off of his
[11:37] side he had his garment tied with bound
[11:40] his hands and said thus sayeth the Lord
[11:42] chains and prisons wait for the one that
[11:45] wore this up there see prophesying Paul
[11:47] said I know it I know it but don't break
[11:50] my heart now let me finish my course he
[11:53] was tired he was finished and he was
[11:56] going on and leaving this bishoy with
[11:59] Timothy now we got to think of young
[12:03] people we got
[12:05] children most of us people you're a
[12:07] married man has children what about them
[12:11] it's coming on see like I used to kick
[12:15] up down there about him throwing those
[12:16] cast Nets on the river and pulling out
[12:18] them perch and the drinks drunkards and
[12:20] things I've seen them piled high is this
[12:22] ceiling here big Vine perch laying there
[12:24] just stink could be all around the river
[12:26] I went out as a game board and make him
[12:28] stop it I got a letter leave him alone
[12:30] why do you go to do it belongs to
[12:31] Kentucky now Kentucky Warden can't come
[12:34] over here because he's out of his
[12:36] territory Indiana Warden has nothing to
[12:38] say into it because the water belongs to
[12:40] Kentucky there you are there's nothing
[12:42] can be done I said I've got a boy coming
[12:44] on we like the fish why they put his
[12:47] picture in the paper if he caught a chub
[12:49] 20 years now let that go on like that
[12:51] those Nets traps and everything else
[12:53] it's practically getting like that right
[12:55] now see what's the matter you've got to
[12:57] think of these that's coming on so we'
[12:59] got to think of the others that's coming
[13:01] on behind us these young people and so
[13:04] forth and a place for our children our
[13:06] daughters we don't want them out in the
[13:08] world and these things like that we want
[13:10] them girls raised like their mothers and
[13:13] we've got to make arrangements for them
[13:15] and if there is no tomorrow we don't
[13:17] know that if there is no tomorrow we
[13:19] haven't done nothing but been at the
[13:20] Master's business and been found at our
[13:22] post of Duty when he does come see so I
[13:26] would suggest this I did to brother
[13:28] Neville let's carry this on just as we
[13:32] have let's let it just the way it is I'm
[13:35] grateful for these young ministers see
[13:38] actually at the day of judgment for this
[13:41] entire Valley through here there'll be
[13:43] no excuse because we've got little
[13:45] churches setting out
[13:48] everywhere Outpost listening post
[13:52] waiting that's not as in Brothers church
[13:55] and ask if all in there was 45 behind
[13:59] the word in every hand went up now that
[14:02] made me feel good see now what I would
[14:05] think would be this
[14:08] Brethren that like in the church here
[14:11] now I the my
[14:14] Ministry has the best amount of thinking
[14:18] four things that can be done and it
[14:20] might not be either four that's the only
[14:22] Outlook I can think of if that one is
[14:25] spoke to me down there on the river if
[14:28] this is all all that was left for the
[14:30] Gentile Church which we realize in
[14:33] Revelations it says 1 2 three chapters
[14:36] to the church the church goes up in the
[14:39] fourth chapter it does not return
[14:41] anymore to the 19th Chapter that's after
[14:44] the tribulation period when God calls
[14:47] out the Jews that's right and like Enoch
[14:51] he went up before one drop or rain ever
[14:54] hit the earth it was gone then the
[14:56] tribulation set in no Noah was in the
[15:00] ark before any tribulation set in lot
[15:04] was out of Sodom before any tribulation
[15:06] set in see and the church will be gone
[15:09] before any tribulation period now during
[15:12] the tribulation that will be the
[15:15] sleeping virgin will be hunted down by
[15:19] the dragon that spurts water from his
[15:22] mouth which it means multitudes and
[15:24] people armies that'll search down and
[15:28] take this woman woman uh uh remnant of
[15:30] her seed and will kill her
[15:34] now that will be in the tribulation
[15:37] period but the church will go home
[15:40] now
[15:42] if if that take would take place
[15:44] tomorrow it wouldn't hinder miskeeping
[15:47] on today let's make today count now what
[15:52] I think down there if that angel that
[15:56] said those words to me said as John the
[16:00] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[16:03] coming of Christ see your
[16:07] message I to take this message and it
[16:11] would forerun the second coming of
[16:15] Christ well if this has been it and
[16:19] we're real real close Breen because the
[16:22] our and the light of the message just
[16:26] about gone out did you know notice when
[16:29] Pentecost fell and those Brothers was
[16:31] filled at Pentecost with the Holy Ghost
[16:33] it wasn't hardly any time until the
[16:36] message had begin to dim down and they
[16:39] begin to set up churches to hold a fort
[16:41] for Christ expecting him to come that's
[16:44] the same thing is taking place today if
[16:47] the scripture is true I will restore
[16:49] sayeth the Lord all that the Palmer worm
[16:51] and cankerworm has
[16:53] eaten
[16:55] now if that be it if that is the message
[17:00] and God forgive me I I do not know if
[17:04] that's it then the time is close at hand
[17:07] really because the message is over and
[17:10] the other night I was dreaming that I
[17:11] went to have derer it where a great host
[17:15] of my friends together thousands of them
[17:18] in a meeting there's a fellow come got
[17:20] me and Billy usually comes gets me
[17:23] because you don't talk to me this man
[17:25] just talked to Blue Street and four I
[17:27] got over there all the anointing was
[17:28] gone from me for and then I said I'll
[17:31] just go there and preach the message of
[17:35] telling those people don't fool those
[17:36] denominations and so forth and come out
[17:38] like this and when I got to the platform
[17:41] that had left
[17:43] me I don't know what it meant but I
[17:46] going
[17:48] on I just don't
[17:51] know it could be the end of my
[17:54] road it could be the coming of the
[17:57] Lord it could be the change of the day
[18:01] it could be the coming of that mighty
[18:03] one if it's to be another besides what's
[18:05] already come it could be
[18:07] that all those things we'd have to draw
[18:11] from it would be and as I stand here
[18:15] tonight before God and you Brethren I
[18:17] don't know I couldn't tell you if I did
[18:20] i' tell you or I wouldn't mention bring
[18:22] anything up like this if it didn't know
[18:24] which way if I know which way the thing
[18:26] was going i' I'd say it but I don't know
[18:29] I can't tell I'm going right now on
[18:31] meetings without one Speck of leading
[18:34] I'm going because I don't want to set up
[18:36] there I I I like to get out in the woods
[18:40] as well as
[18:42] anybody if I'm wrong in this God forgiv
[18:46] me there's three things could happen to
[18:49] me it's either the end of my road and
[18:53] let this other one come on I've opened
[18:56] up the road for him to take over work
[18:58] calls remember the one that comes to
[19:01] preach will be on the word restoring the
[19:05] faith of the children back to the
[19:07] fathers it could be the end of my
[19:10] road it could
[19:12] be that he's changing my Ministry back
[19:15] into evangelism for
[19:19] overseas or it could be that he's not
[19:23] going to call me anymore for an
[19:25] evangelist and he's taking me into the
[19:28] Wilderness somewhere to anoint me to
[19:33] send me
[19:34] forth like the promised one is to come I
[19:38] think there could be any of those
[19:42] things I cannot go on the way I've been
[19:46] going because I'm the
[19:49] people has believed me I I have to say
[19:52] this I said before man that people many
[19:56] times regard me as being a prophet
[19:59] I do not regard myself that no sir I do
[20:02] not I have I don't say that to be humble
[20:05] I say that to be truthful I do not
[20:08] regard myself to be a prophet of the
[20:10] Lord I I haven't that honor I believe
[20:15] that the Lord has used me and little
[20:18] special things to help maybe lay a
[20:22] foundation for a prophet it will come
[20:26] but a prophet doesn't operate the way I
[20:30] operate now you know that a prophet
[20:33] isn't an
[20:35] evangelist and an evangelist isn't a
[20:38] prophet a pastor isn't a evangelist and
[20:42] a evangelist isn't a
[20:44] pastor but God has set in the church
[20:48] first apostles then prophets then
[20:50] teachers then pastors and so forth God
[20:53] set them in the church and God gave them
[20:55] an office but the morning when I laid
[20:58] that Cornerstone because now if you're
[21:01] spiritual you get
[21:03] it because of the Cry of the
[21:07] people if you could break that out or
[21:09] take the book and read it it said do the
[21:12] work of an
[21:15] evangelist didn't call me to be
[21:17] evangelist but said do the work of an
[21:19] evangelist for the time will come when
[21:21] they will not endure sound
[21:24] Doctrine but for Heap themselves
[21:27] together teachers having itch and ear
[21:28] and shall turn from truth to
[21:31] fables see quoted that scripture and
[21:34] told me where to find it said it three
[21:36] times and I got the Bible and turned to
[21:39] where he told me and there it was and
[21:41] now you know about the two buckets of
[21:42] the Pentecostal Oneness and the
[21:44] Pentecostal assemblies I never crossed
[21:46] them I planted their own trees right
[21:48] where they were C I think they're both
[21:50] wrong but out of it I was at the cross
[21:54] at the
[21:56] Harvest God respects anybody who's
[22:00] sincere Peter said that he perceived
[22:02] that God was no respect of person all
[22:04] nations calling when on got the house of
[22:06] Cornelius when they receive the Holy
[22:08] Ghost like they did at the beginning see
[22:10] God is no respected person we see a
[22:13] person deeply and sincere he can be
[22:14] sincerely wrong but if he is sincerely
[22:17] God will lead him to the light somewhere
[22:19] he'll come to it because God's obligated
[22:21] to do that and we' think about the
[22:24] coming of the Lord being such a a great
[22:26] thing and the message no more than it's
[22:28] went remember there's a predestinated
[22:30] group to be here when the Lord returns
[22:33] and it might not be over a
[22:35] dozen we don't know it might be 100
[22:38] million might be
[22:40] 10,000 but if the
[22:42] predestinated will hear the message and
[22:45] believe it if it's the message s of God
[22:48] which we believe it to be
[22:50] now here we are then right up here to
[22:53] the end of the time when if God did call
[22:57] me now listen this is not to be repeated
[22:59] if he did call me to be his Prophet then
[23:03] I'm certainly not holding the office of
[23:05] one prophets don't
[23:08] evangelize a prophet hides himself in
[23:11] the wilderness alone with God until he
[23:15] gets exactly directly what God wants him
[23:17] to do and he Stomps right out and gives
[23:19] his message and back into the Wilderness
[23:21] he goes
[23:22] again he's not an evangelist holding
[23:26] meetings and getting cooperations all
[23:28] these things like evangelist do he don't
[23:32] teach like evangelist he has thus sayith
[23:35] the Lord and that's it and that's all he
[23:38] gives it throws it out and let the chips
[23:40] fall where it will and then way goes
[23:43] again nobody knows where he's at he's in
[23:45] isolation somewhere now I cannot or if
[23:50] he's called me to be that I cannot be an
[23:54] evangelist and if he's called me to be
[23:57] evangelist I cannot be a
[23:59] prophet how you get what I mean I don't
[24:02] know what to do I've done reverently
[24:06] when he told me first about me holding
[24:08] the people's hand and praying for them
[24:09] then know the secret of their heart and
[24:11] all these different things and Brethren
[24:13] that's infallible you know that's to be
[24:15] the truth every one of you knows that
[24:16] see and how he told me it would blast
[24:18] across the world and it's done it just
[24:20] exactly every nation under the heavens
[24:23] is heard everywhere
[24:26] newspapers tape recordings everywhere I
[24:29] don't know how it's ever done it but
[24:31] throughout all the world letters coming
[24:33] in and people from way down in Pand in
[24:35] the Hot Tops back in there how those
[24:38] missionaries is crowded back in there
[24:40] with those tapes and giving that
[24:42] interpretation of the word and now we
[24:43] hear from all the world around the world
[24:47] now the the church is predestinated
[24:49] universally everywhere be two in the bed
[24:52] two in the field see take one and leave
[24:55] one now
[24:58] as I have done the work of an
[25:02] evangelist and here's my plea if that is
[25:05] pleasing to God and I've done the work
[25:07] all right trusting that I have pleased
[25:09] him asking forgiveness for all my
[25:13] mistakes then he may be calling me from
[25:16] the field of evangelism to be his
[25:21] Prophet then if it is I'll leave
[25:25] evangelism but if he calls me to be a a
[25:28] prophet I cannot be an
[25:30] evangelist if I'm to be evangelist I
[25:34] cannot be a
[25:35] prophet I'm mixing the two offices
[25:38] that's where I've always fussed about
[25:41] standing on the platform it's never been
[25:43] good successful God has used it but I've
[25:46] never thought it was his direct will
[25:48] it's been his permissive will stand on
[25:51] the platform a vision of two will knock
[25:53] you out almost see and then if you tell
[25:57] this person
[25:58] how to straighten hisself up and what to
[26:00] do and then the next person stands there
[26:03] he's expecting the same thing and you
[26:05] can't tell him unless something tells
[26:07] you to tell him and that the other
[26:10] people feel like you're a traitor or
[26:12] backslider or a demon or something
[26:15] because you don't tell them what they
[26:17] want to know see that's not the office
[26:20] the way a prophet operates a prophet
[26:22] stays back here till he Stomps out into
[26:24] the hospital or wherever he's going with
[26:26] thus sayeth the Lord and say and stomp
[26:28] back out again there's no evangelist at
[26:31] all you don't hold meetings and discuss
[26:34] things he's got the word of the Lord for
[26:36] whoever he sent to if he sent to the
[26:39] White House he stomped right up in front
[26:40] of the White House and thus sayeth the
[26:43] Lord if it's to the governor of the
[26:45] state whoever it is it's thus sayeth the
[26:49] Lord you don't fool around with a group
[26:51] of churches trying get them to come in
[26:53] and take the word and preach these
[26:55] things like evangelist he's not an
[26:56] evangelist
[26:58] so you see Brethren that's the reason I
[26:59] don't call myself a
[27:01] prophet I'm not even in the office of
[27:04] one see now you understand what I mean
[27:07] now there' be a lot going on like that
[27:09] for a long time but I hope to not take
[27:11] too much of your time until I get a
[27:13] little bit of this word I want to read
[27:14] tonight now here's what I'm
[27:18] doing I have never felt that I should
[27:22] live in
[27:23] Indiana I'm a I'm a
[27:26] rambler I don't I'll go one place I
[27:29] think I'll go over here and I'll settle
[27:31] down here this is it I can't do it when
[27:35] I go somewhere else I think I'll go over
[27:36] here want to do it my wife calls me
