========================================

[Music] so [Music] if you say i believe it don't make no act it's like the message if you say i believe it don't make an act what good does it do noah went to work with his hammer and built an ark to confirm what he was talking about that's what we have to do too we have to go to work and prove our faith by our works our works proves our faith moses had to do it elijah had to do it every prophet in his age had to stand up and face these responsibilities but many of them didn't do like jonah he run they didn't notice cry out against it oh my there it is that's the subject cry out against it there's the check part just gonna tell those fellas say i'll come down to join up with you guys you know what i believe i'll tell you what i'll do i've got just a little thing here i believe i can make it bring us all together and do this side of the other but it was cry out against it when you had to cry out against something now he had to cry out against everything that was down there crowd against the city cried against her work cried against her church cried against her prophets cried against her ministers cried against their priests cry against it the whole thing cried out against it noah cried out against his aid sure it did but the churches of his age moses must certainly did cry out against his his age of the people the priests and so forth he cried all the way through the wilderness never junction he cried continually crying to the people elijah was very unpopular in his day because he cried out against that age he certainly was john the baptist is very unpopular in his age he cried out against his age he said to the king the potent tape of the of the land he had married his brother's wife he had to preach on marriage and divorce one morning so he cried against him that it's not lawful for you to have her it costed him his head to be cut off later but he cried out and he stood to his post of duty he never took a ship to tarshish and said well i'll agree with you harry it's all right as long as you think she's a nice woman she's making a nice wife go ahead hold mercy them dish rags yeah yes every little thing well it's nothing to clean dirty plates with but notice john wasn't that way he faced right up to it he said it's not lawful for you to have her yes sir and he stood out against it they never run john didn't they stood in face the facts moses tried to run one time like jonah but god brought him back many of them tried to get away from it they'd start but look if god has called you and you're sure that god's in that message there's nothing going to turn you back it didn't turn jonah no sir amos of old cried out the lion is roared who can but fear and goddess fake who can but prophesy who can but prophesy when you see god speaks and said a certain thing will happen there it is the lion roars everybody's scared yes sir if you ever heard one roar in a jungle you hear these now and around these cages out here them tame lines but you already hear a real wild one roar one time little rocks will fall off the hill 500 yards away i don't see where all that belch comes out of them lungs and he throws his head down throws that fur up i never heard any like a cannon going off when he belches out that big roar in his lungs who couldn't be scared to say if you ever killed by a line it's painless he scares you to death before he gets to you you don't notice it he scares you with that great fiocious roar and here he is only in a split second he said the lion has roared who can but fear and god is spoke who can be prophesied when you see god doing something you say it might not be a prophet jones said i might not be a prophet or the son of a prophet but god has spoke who can but prophesy i might not be a prophet i might not be this out of there when i see god doing anything and i see it you're an award and he promised it who can't hold their peace and keep still turret he's done it neither can we hide behind creeds and all these your fellowships and down to the tarshish we don't want to go and fellowship but many like adam do the same thing try to make a substitute in some way try to find a way out and and make a substitute to face god if they know in the wrong faced up to the truth went on with his wife and did exactly what god told him not to do he went right ahead and did it anyhow then he found himself naked she and he both in the garden of eden their eyes come open they know what was right and wrong man and then he tried to find a substitute to kind of cover himself up with it now that's just about the way we do that an excuse say well i'll tell you if it was here if this or if if that's this thing but you must face up to it it's either right or wrong and if it's right let's stay by if it's wrong get away from it that's all get find out what is right you don't want to wait any longer let's find out now watch truth and what's right and stay with him we know that's true now we find today that our people are so it seems like all the sincerity has gone out of the churches uh and uh we are living in a house there of a precious sister that comes to this church she's probably sitting here tonight and she rinsed it out to her the people and she's just been so sweet to us about that place about letting us have that place and so i'd call her name but she might not want me to do it she's been so sweet to us well we certainly wouldn't want more to expose her but she's been a very very dear woman and in the house there was a television over one side we got a little uh two duplex i got a big fan and a bunch of youngins and we and you you know and they have to have beds and plenty of them and everything piled up on top we had to walk through this and through that to get in and out and then over there they had a television and in this uh a television these kids got to watching on sunday morning some kind of a hymn singing that come on and you know it it would almost make you ashamed that there wasn't a genuine christianity somewhere that you could put your hands on to see what's called christianity why it seems like all the sincerity's gone out of it well they don't they don't seem to why it's just terrible way to stand there and draw their fists and fight one other on there and try to sing hymns and everything like that and pull jokes that hardly you would a sailor would pull and say all kinds of things and kid and go on you know the sacredness of of christianity has seemed to lose its place i go to church and and see the pastor get up there and announce that there's going to be a swimming bee all the women these bathing suits they're all going out there they're going to have a contest these women swimming and they're going to have a a party of some sort and they're going to fry up a lot of a chicken and play bunco and and all these things like that to me that takes the genuine sincerity out of christianity just get by with anything i seen coming up here we find out you know we find more of our sisters wearing shorts up here in this coal country than you find them out there in that hot country okay it's true out there where it's really hot not too many of them it wear them but here were where it's cold they do it see it's they don't realize it's a devil doing that now if it's to be comfortable if it's to help yourself it'd be different be man i think it looks sickly on a man but it but yeah you wouldn't pay attention to a man but the lady her body is sacred and she must keep it that way and um the ceo you can see people today these two spirits and one of them is a holy spirit the other is an unholy spirit and one's governed by and both of them religious uh that's a strange part they're both religious and just like esau and jacob was both religious like cain and abel was both religious like judas and jesus was both religion both religious and we see it today both sides religious see it's the same spirit the people die but the spirit doesn't die it goes right on both religious one of them is possessed with the holy spirit that lives the kind of life that they should live and walk godly and honest they wouldn't beat you out of a penny and they they do everything honest that they could to help you and others or just as nice as they can be and the others we find out it's just vice versa and yet both of them are religious spirits two of them one holy spirit and the other unholy spirit and but if you notice it'll even though claiming religion they'll make fun of you and call you holy roller they do anything they can they're ignoring the the unchanging word of god as though it never had been written thing you can see now look at here if if the baptism i have the holy spirit and stand there that cigar in your hands yes i have the holy spirit i don't think it's wrong to take a little drink i don't think see as you notice i don't think but god thinks difference is he according to his words they and they they just simply as much as spit on it that's exactly right just as much as this little crippled guy that crawled out that time when david was being uh excommunicated from his throne he's going up on the mount of olives going out weeping as he went up looking back and this little fellow crawled out there and spitting on him and that guard said i'll let that dog's head stay on him spit on my king david said let him alone see they spit on him about 800 years later they spit on his son jesus christ too and today get on it again as if it wasn't even just i reverend unconcerned just turn up their head and walk away from it laugh in your face why is it they only ship the tarshish after that this call to god you got to crowd against evil cried against sin cry against the things that's wrong now remember it'll be hey you know this time you know i'm two hours difference in tucson's just 10 minutes after 7. i'm getting kind of uh kind of out of my place sure huh all right now remember we're going to have to answer for it remember those who spit on christ answer for it when david returned back from his exile when he was a fugitive and when he returned back remember this fellow fell on his face and cried out for mercy he spit on david going out but he was almost ready to bathe his feet with tears and when he returned back and someday those who pierced jesus will see it and those who are piercing him today will see it also someday it'll come back remember revelations 22 he requires us to keep every word that he has written every word now we know his presence are here it's vindicated we're having we're trusting in this coming week they'll continue to be uh vindicated among us the sick will be healed and great things will be taking place we don't want the proper idea we want the truth now we know we won't don't want to we don't want to face up to nothing but what god has said is the truth but be sure that your sins will always find you out if it doesn't here it'll get you to judgment so you're it's going to catch you somewhere now that's your buddy if you are a true christian truly call like jonah was god's already got your fair paid get off of that ship going to tarshish god predestinated you to this life yes sir if you're a true call child of god come to christ come into the fullness of him your waste paid to where it's paid to nineveh dr tarshish you're predestinated your shift is a ship leaving right now on its road so there's only one thing to do is get on it and if you was like god you'll never have no peace like my little nephew a while ago about 10 years now he's one from pillar to post someone he goes to this church this catholic church down here and take this when he calls what some holy father talks about over here and some other over here and some over here what does it all amount to see now he's still hungry and thirsting i said your place is at the altar down there something there's no way of getting out of it when god ever takes out after you you just might as well give up and go on that's all remember god we're like god was in the boat god was in the storm god was in the fish everywhere he turned god was there see god's there and he'll just keep haunting at you so why don't we wait any longer let's just start this revival right right what you're waiting on we believe that the coming of the lord is at hand and he's going to have a bride and it ready we don't want no ships to any tarshish we're going to nineveh we're going to glory amen that's right we're going to work god's going to bless and that's what we want to do lay out in the presence of god damn with our hearts not our hands so much but our hearts before god until he seasoned us through and through like that with a rays of his glory and baked into us his his goodness and ripen that which we have got into reality see or we can show others that jesus christ lived oh my we want to believe that and remember where jonah went god was in the boat god was in the storm god was in the fish he went on being right along with jonah until his perfect will was done that's right and if he's ever after you you might dodge over here and dodge over there but you'll be miserable until you come back and do the thing you started out before you do it the first place see don't go run from the presence of god face up to it if you believe it's the truth then if it is the truth it's worth living for dying for anything else and if he's ever vindicated you that is the truth then we can't run from it no word he'll be right there just the same you can't do that by his provided prophet the one he ordained to go down there and call that message now it looked like he could have sent another prophet but he ordained jonah and even elijah wouldn't have done jeremiah wouldn't have done moses wouldn't have done it was jonah had to go to nineveh that's all there was to it he commissioned him and told him to go in when he says go there jonah go to nineveh nobody else can go do that but jonah and when god tells you something you've got to do nobody else see we just have to face up to it and and go do it we believe that we're living in the hour that when god isn't doing something we believe that we're living among them now i believe tonight i'm preaching to that congregation that it's laying waiting out there just to get right i i really believe that with all my heart i would say it's the same now as it's always been now we believe that the hours come that saint john 14 12 must be fulfilled we we believe that malachi 4 must be fulfilled we believe in luke 17 30 must be fulfilled we believe that all these prophecies that he said would come to pass in this day we believe they must be fulfilled and we believe we're seeing and fulfill right now that's exactly right stop running don't get out of his presence just move up into his presence that's right and i know that's what you're desiring to do because i've seen license out there from texas and louisiana and everywhere that's what we're here for is not to run from his presence but to run into his presence come back get off been a jonah if you've been wondering which way to go or what to do come on get on the ship with us tonight we're going down to tarshish to cry out nineveh to cry out we're letting that tarshish ship go on down if we want to we've got a duty before god that's a message that we're responsible for so in this coming week just a little prelude tonight to let you know when i'm crying out i'm solely responsible for a message brethren you minister sitting here i'm not here to hurt your feelings and you women and men on this marriage and divorce case coming up on you remember tonight i said all this to get this to you that i am responsible only to god and then again i'm responsible to you to tell you the truth and i'm not going to tell you nothing but the truth as long as god lets me know what truth is until i know the truth i won't say nothing about it i won't say about it but i do believe that god shows me the truth on marriage and divorce and uh i trust that he'll let me bring it out and other messages i aim to have this week is who is this melchizedek where did god choose to put his name and a few of those things like that which are messages coming up and birth pains and and a few things on that order and uh complimentary to a man choosing his wife and a few things of them messages i want to bring up this week but i just want the congregation or if to be a minister here i'm not you're my brother no i don't share some of you members go back to your church and say brother brahm said thus and thus i am duty bound to a message that's been given to me from almighty god as i stand here tonight and god knows that's true that right down on this river there's people perhaps sitting here when that angel of the lord come down there and told me what he did right there in 1933 right down this spring street year if you're a stranger here drive right off corner of spring street there where hit the river and there's where it happened that's been in 1933 it's probably been about 32 years ago and oh it's been 30 it's been 30 32 years ago 32 years ago and how that he's brought that right down everything and we've went out bringing the message and seen the sick heal the blind and crippled and lame and halt and everything then seen even the dead that we know that's been verified raised up from the dead that people die and raised right back to life again and all these things if a message goes forth or signs and wonders and you still see that same old school of thought that you come up with that didn't come from god god don't just have to do god is trying to get your attention attracted to something and then when jesus went out he started healing the sick and doing great works and things he always jesus did it and moses and jesus done it in the rest of them and when he was sure he did it and he's doing it the same thing today when he sends forth a meeting like that revivals and starts a meeting in the earth and starts moving along with these great signs and wonders and then you see come back that same old school of teaching there's something wrong there somewhere there's something new coming forth when jesus came out after one he is a fine rabbi he could go to any pulpit and preach when he was healing the sick well they like to have him over there but one day when he stood down and said i and my father are one brother he wasn't so popper after that when he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and i'll raise him up for the last day then he wasn't the proper man said this man's a vampire this man's a beelzebub that's where he done them things he could tell fortunes he looked through the their minds and perceived their thoughts he's a fortune teller what was he he was the word of god made manifest for that hour and he was duty bound he said i do always that which is pleasing to my father god help us to do the same thing do that which is pleasing to the father and i hope you all understand if you disagree with me on these messages and things that you'll remember at least have this respect that i have a responsibility and i'm not going to tarsha i'm on the road to nineveh i got to cry out the lord bless you all let us bow our heads now just a moment it's almost 9 30. i don't want to keep you but i want to find this if i can tonight is there some here that that just isn't exactly or you should be in christ but you'd want to be and you desire to be would you just raise up your hand say brother branham pray for me god bless you just look at the hand uh uh well i'm here brother abraham to get closer to god if your head was raised my my hand's up too that's what i'm here for i'm hungry like you are but oh the other day one of the most grandest things happened and i i know now what to do and i i pray that god will give you that clear understanding it's there that if there's a question in your mind there's got to be an answer somewhere to answer back to that question my prayer is god let you see that question answered during this time if you're sick may god heal you we're going to have healing services i guess practically every night and we're going to pray for the sick we're going to do anything that we can to help you and you do everything you can to help us and we'll work together trusting god will give us a great meeting uh father god these few little cut up words but they're in your hands now lord they've been said i'll have to meet it just like them words can never die they're going around and around the earth on a record and someday i'll have to face it right back again i realize this lord and i say it with deepness of sincerity i pray dear god tonight for each one of these your children and oh god i trust before the week is over they'll they'll understand that the question that's so great in their mind tonight will be settled granted lord there's some here who doesn't know your father as savior yet or maybe it's never been filled with the holy spirit may this be that night lord i cannot feel nobody with the holy ghost neither can i save anybody i can only tell them what you said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness or they shall be filled now i pray god that you'll create such a hunger in their hearts many lord they've got to be hungry how would they drive these hundreds of miles through ice and everything and over rainy mountains and across deserts they'll come to a little old place sitting here on the corner then i think again you said where the carcasses the eagles will be gathered fetus lord upon thy divine manna give to our souls that what we really need we're thirsting for you father we're in your hands now let the great holy spirit come down on the mountain the other day up there i pray that he'll saturate every heart in here with his goodness and mercy with understanding we realize father that's what we need is to understand or if we do not know what we're doing then how do we know how to do it but we must have understanding as daniel said he had understanding by the prophet jeremiah's writing father we have understanding by the holy spirit's writing as he will reveal it to us in this hour give to us lord the desires that we have for thee tenderly we ask this father for your glory in the name of jesus christ now with our heads bound [Music] you
