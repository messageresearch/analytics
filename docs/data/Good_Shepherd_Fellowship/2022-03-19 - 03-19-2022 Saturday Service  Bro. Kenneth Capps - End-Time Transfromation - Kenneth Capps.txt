uh it's just a real privilege and a real treat to come and speak to this portion of the bride of jesus christ and so we just ask that you pray for us uh we got up about four o'clock this morning in order to make the flight and uh we had intentions of getting some rest this afternoon but sometimes that doesn't work out but that's fine but we're happy to be here and um you know i i heard uh your pastor talk about the sister was a sister-in-law that had cancer yeah you know i had cancer back in 2001 i was diagnosed with prostate cancer and the saints of god prayed and by god's grace i stand here today cancer free that's our god and what he did one time he'll do again just the same so we we thank god and you know you were you're singing the song only believe only believe and i must tell you um as a as a young man i was very fortunate to sit in the branham tabernacle and uh and hear that song sung many times as the prophet of god came out and it's still every time i hear the song it stirs my heart because from that time i was age six i sat in the branham tabernacle my father was a brother branham's song leader there and brother neville's assistant and we just uh have so many memories from that time in our life and if i can't i just tell you one little story we 1964 my brother and this is part of the message if you've studied the message you've probably read this my my brother became very sick and they didn't know what was wrong with him took him to the doctor and the doctor didn't know and after a week another week of being in pain and crying and so forth he was about 12 years old took him to another doctor and they couldn't find what was wrong with him and finally one night my father took him to the emergency room there in jeffersonville and uh i was standing there by my father and the doctor come out and he said mr capps he said i'm sorry to inform you he said your son's appendix has burst and there's poison that spread through his whole body and said we don't expect him to live until morning now we grew up living in jeffersonville there in such an atmosphere of faith we you know we knew that anything that satan would bring against us if we could get a hold of that prophet amen he could speak the word and so when the doctor told my father that my brother was going to die my father didn't get excited he said well we'll just call brother branham and they called brother random's house and there was no answer and he said well he said i'll call billy so we called billy paul and my dad said brother billy he said do you know who your father is he said i've just been told that my son is going to die before morning he said we need your father to pray and brother billy said well brother capps he goes i don't know for sure where he's at he said he went target shooting with brother joseph who brother joseph was a little boy about 10 years old then and he said if i see him i'll have him give you a call my father got ready to hang up the phone and brother billy said wait a minute brother capps he said daddy just pulled in the driveway he said if you can wait a minute i'll put him on the phone and so uh just a minute or two there brother branham came to the phone and i heard my dad say brother branham the doctors say my son's going to die he said would you pray and he said brother random didn't even pray he didn't pause he didn't take a second to take a minute he said brother capps he said thus saith the lord your son shall not die your son shall live and my and my brother lives today in kokomo indiana completely whole so that's our god amen so god answers prayer and god answers the spoken word of a prophet if a prophet god says it it has to come to pass and i told uh we had a little uh meal earlier today and i told some of the the saints uh about uh when the prophet speaks the word and we we found out you know in in in the message and i was trying to remember this afternoon the message and i still haven't found it there's one of the messages where uh brother branham is talking about uh uh he's talking about uh when his father courted his mother he did so by horse and buggy and he said then when i courted my wife i did so with uh model a ford i believe it was and he said when my son billy courted his wife he did so by a fancy sports car and he made this statement he said i suppose someday my grandson will court his wife by jet airplane now the only grandson he had at that time was billy paul's little boy who was paul and he was two years old of course so as as time went on brother branham passed george smith married rebecca and rebecca branham and they began to have children and so i think the second son they had his name was william and uh those of us who know him knew him uh call him will and uh so will was like a lot of young people in our in our country in our area of the wood we have a lot of messy churches around us uh they're just everywhere and uh seems like you know they're always having youth camps and youth meetings and youth banquets and youth this and youth that and it's a wonderful thing and then we have regular conventions you know and and the young people in our area they try to go to all those meetings that they can and so will lived in tucson arizona with his mom and dad with george and rebecca and he went to a convention that they had at brother jack palmer's in macon georgia and he met brother palmer's granddaughter and they talked and they became friends and they kept talking and phoning and writing and uh pretty soon they became better friends and then uh after a while they became better friends and the next thing you know they were in love and of course that's part of being a young person isn't it and uh but there was a problem will lived with his mom and dad in tucson and rannell lived in uh macon georgia and there's almost two thousand miles difference between them and so what were they going to do well will was a pretty smart boy he went and got a job working for american airlines and he would work all week and then come friday night back then if you worked for american airlines you could fly free and so he would hop a plane and fly to macon georgia and he did this every week for almost seven months thereby fulfilling the word of a prophet has said i suppose someday my grandson will court his wife by jet airplane so we never we can always put a lot of uh trust and a lot of confidence in the words of a prophet and so i i encourage people to to study the message read the message find yourself in the message the prophet of god told us he said we need to find ourselves uh in the bible but i believe we need to find ourselves in the message now having said that i found myself in the message and i'm going to read to you if i've got it here i thought i had it yeah here it is i found myself in the message i hope you can find yourself in the message and let me just read you this little quote and i've had it for years and i've carried it for years and you can see it's pretty ragged i'm going to read it to you this is from the message hearing receiving and acting uh it was preached in chautauqua ohio in 1960. brother branham says the believer has something to live for we ought to live like it reaching every day for everything that we can get a hold of from god leaving the world behind burning your ships every day burning the track behind you keep on moving reaching pulling seeking hungering thirsting for god now here's where i found myself he said we need to be real fanatical about it he just just move on he said a fanatic is an over-enthused person he said i am really a fanatic he said i'm over-enthused about my lord jesus christ how did he ever save me how did he ever give me the holy ghost why did he ever let me preach how did he let me love people and let people love me oh i'm so thrilled over him i just keep reaching with all that's in me stretching my skin to try to get to him just moving with everything that i've got that's what we should do church i found myself in the message i trust you can find yourself in the message if you look long enough if you search hard enough if you study enough you can find yourself in the message amen now i appreciate the musicians but i didn't dismiss them where are you all going [Laughter] i want to sing you a little song and maybe if you can follow me now following me singing is not a good thing sometimes i can't follow myself but there's a little song that i like and the title of it is i'll overcome now we know in the bible we're told that the saints of old they overcame by their testimony in the blood of the lamb is that right so this little song says i'll overcome and if you know it sing it with me but it goes like this by my testimony and the blood of the lamb well i'll overcome one day i am all the demons of hell can't stop god's little bride she's elected to stand and she will stand by her bridegroom side well beaten and bruised sawn asunder they say many saints lost their lives in various ways for jesus they died a testimony of love we'll meet them again at the marriage supper above oh by my testimony and the blood of the lamb well i'll overcome one day i am all the demons of hell can't stop god's little bride she's elected to stand and she will stand by her bright groom side we're worried and troubled in these last gentile days many are the trials we've known on our way but don't you be discouraged the battle's almost won and what we're now feeling is the rising of the sun oh by my testimony and the blood of the lamb well i'll overcome one day i am all the demons of hell can't stop god's little bride she's elected to stand and she will stand by her bright room side now here's the verse i like the rapture's in progress oh i can feel it in my soul this world's just a dressing room but heaven is my goal there's a faster dimension just waiting for me very soon i'll step over king jesus to see and by my testimony and the blood of the lamb well i'll overcome one day i am all the demons of hell can't stop god's little bride she's elected to stand and she will stand by her bright room side i'm going to sing that course one more time oh by my testimony and the blood of the lamb well i'll overcome one day i am all the demons of hell can't stop god's little bride she's elected to stand and she will stand by her bridegroom side do you believe it tonight i believe it with everything that's in me i believe it i believe it i believe it amen god bless you thank you musicians um i i'm not a singer and then when i've preached quite a bit which i've just come from the country of brazil preaching four or five times a week my voice is pretty well shot but i thank you for allowing me to do that amen seemed like there was one other thing i wanted to say but it'll come to me let's stand and we'll read the scripture tonight i'm going to be reading from romans the 8th chapter and we're going to read romans 8 11-13 and then we're going to move down to romans 12 1-2 so romans chapter 8 uh verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live can you say amen and then romans the 12th chapter verse 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god let us pray heavenly father once again lord we stand behind the sacred desk and lord as you know we have nothing that we can say other than what you give us at this time and lord we thank you for what you've done in the past and lord we thank you for this group of people we thank you for our brother juan lord a brother that we've known for a few years now lord and we've uh always thought of him and and uh thought of him as a brother and lord it was just a real privilege to be standing here but in his church behind the pulpit we thank you for letting us come together we thank you father what you've done in this little group here in in this little community and lord we see that how that you have moved and you've uh uh raised up uh a congregation lord of people who are are following after the revealed word of god in this hour and we thank you for it we praise your name have your way in tonight's service lord move brother kenny aside say something lord that can edify your people we ask it in jesus name amen now you may be seated first thing first is take the coat off is that all right brother uh you know some i guess some people don't like it i don't know i don't ask usually tonight i want to speak on the subject of end time transformations and i'm going to read that uh verse 2 of chapter 12 there in romans again as for a text and it says and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god now uh in dealing with our our subject tonight end time transformations of course we're talking about uh being transformed in the end time now the word transformation means a change has taken place something has been changed and made different than what it once was amen now no doubt many of you hear this evening have had a real transformation take place in your life and i can look out and i can see the response and i can see that is exactly the truth we've got a group of people here that have had a transformation take place in your life and no doubt and and i don't know anything i've not talked to your pastor about the church or anything but no doubt uh uh many of you and maybe most of you had a transformation take place in your life maybe all of you i don't know but you have been changed from a sinner into a child of god we say thank you lord amen to god be the glory and no doubt maybe in a a crowd this size i don't know but maybe there's someone here tonight that needs a transformation in your life we can pretty much say that with a surety wherever we go uh there seems to be always somebody well even the prophet of god is three kind of believers in every assembly you know uh but we like to believe that everybody here is a fully revealed uh transformed person but uh maybe someone here this evening needs a transformation in your life i don't know maybe you need to be changed from a sinner to a child of god and church listen young and old alike uh there is only one person that can bring forth a transformation in a personal life now that person is not buddha which you know that person is not muhammad that person is not allah it is not hare krishna it is not the pope it's not even the pastor the only person that can bring a true change or a true transformation in your life tonight is jesus christ the holy ghost young person if you're sitting here your mama can't do it for you your daddy can't do it for you your pastor can't do it for you even brother branham could not do it for you if he was here oh but there uh but the message of jesus christ that brother branham preached can bring a transformation in your life he said this message is jesus christ i don't know what you think about that but when i hear that statement i believe that if you can fall in love with this message you can fall in love with jesus christ in fact i think sometimes we need to fall in love with with this message in order to find jesus christ i believe there's according to what the prophet taught us they're one and the same now am i too loud am i i'm not all right i'm just just checking here i don't want to get out of order you know [Laughter] this message is jesus christ church this message is not a bunch of strange doctrines or strange uh revelations this message is not a bunch of rules not a bunch of do's and don'ts uh this message is just fall in love with jesus and you will know what to do you don't need a list of rules you don't really need a list of do's and don'ts just fall in love with jesus when you fall in love with jesus you know what to do you know what not to do you say brother kenny how can you say that i can say that because that's exactly what happened to me when i fell in love with jesus christ oh i didn't need a list i didn't need a bunch of rules i needed one thing and that's more of the holy ghost and that's exactly what i need still tonight and i would venture to say that's what you need tonight we all need more of the holy ghost amen the only person that can bring a true change and true transformation in your life is jesus christ oh my the message of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ can transform you this evening from uh uh from a sinner into a saint this message has transforming power this end time message given to us by god's servant william branham can make you a child of god let me drink a little water here the message can even transform you from a church member into a member of the bride of christ do you know who you are this evening we had a little talk this morning with some of the brothers and sisters there eating breakfast and and it came out that uh we need to know who we are yeah and you know now if it's all right uh sometimes when i preach i tell stories because it helps make the point and i when i speak of knowing who you are it's so important that you know who you are now who you are is the bride of jesus christ you have to know who you are it's not good enough that your pastor can look and say oh i believe they're a bride of christ you have to know who you are and i'd like to tell a little story to kind of confirm that a year several years ago and you may have heard this story before i think other ministers have told it uh several years ago it's probably 25 30 years ago now harvard university did a study they wanted to find out who the most well-known personality in the whole world was they did a study you know what they found out maybe you know they found out that the most recognized personality in the world was a boxer by the name of muhammad ali because of his his worldwide persona they felt that he was the most widely known personality in the world at that time now muhammad ali was a boxer and what i you maybe some of you young ones don't know exactly who he was but i'm sure the people up getting close to my age would know who he was but he was he was known as the great champion he was known as the boxing prophet now he fought out of louisville kentucky that was supposed to be his home but what people don't know he was born and raised in jeffersonville indiana and we know there's a lot of great prophets came out of jeffersonville right [Laughter] and he was known as the boxing prophet and then i like it as a humorous note i like to go back and and show how that brother branham said a new testament preacher is also a prophet i was born in jeffersonville so i claimed that for myself [Laughter] no i'm just going on uh but muhammad ali was born and raised in jeffersonville indiana and he uh became quite a notable boxer and of course his family moved to the bigger cities and that was where he fought out of louisville kentucky but muhammad ali was he was a great champion i think he only lost maybe two or three fights in his whole career but he was he was extremely he was he was a great conqueror he conquered most all of his foes and uh now in order to win a lot of these boxing matches uh muhammad ali had to do much work he had to run he had to run i read some time that he ran 14 to 18 miles every day when he was preparing for a fight uh he he sparred and fought and practiced with some of the greatest boxers in the world and he it took a lot of energy it took a lot of time it took a lot of strength and uh there was in other words there was much work that he had to do in order to become a great champion and a great conqueror right and uh he would go into a fight and he would win the fight and the promoter would bring him a check sometimes 18 million dollars sometimes 22 million dollars i think one time he made 40 million dollars and they present him with a check for 40 million or whatever it was and uh but he he was a great champion he he was the conqueror but you know sitting at home was a little lady by the name of mrs muhammad ali and she didn't even go to the fights she said at home and maybe listen to it on the radio or the tv or whatever and when muhammad ali would win the great fight and receive the big check he would take that check home and he would hand it to mrs muhammad ali now he was a great champion a great conqueror but she was more than a conqueror she didn't she didn't have to she didn't have to work and run and practice and fight she just set it home and received the reward [Music] and it makes me think of another great champion jesus christ he's already won the great battles [Music] and he's put the money in the bank for the bride of christ his wife and the money is in the bank the spiritual money's in the bank [Music] whatever you have need of you are more than a conqueror you didn't have to do the fighting you didn't have to do battle but you are more than a conqueror because the promises are all yours it's it's maybe not a good analogy but we say if you need healing just write a check write a spiritual check yes if you need if you need finances write a check now there's things that go along with that of course but you know there's something about mrs muhammad ali she knew who she was now when when she had the big check for 40 million dollars and she took it to the bank she didn't go in and say well i've got this check here and i don't i don't know if you'll honor it or not you know it's made out to my husband and he's endorsed it over to me and i'd like to would it be all right if i put it in the into my account no she knew who she wants she strode into that bank she said here put this check in my account and she could do it with authority because she knew who she was but you know it reminds me of some christians and some message believers sometimes oh they've got all these promises in the book well i don't know you know the pastor prayed for me and i guess i guess i'll be healed you got to know who you are she knew who she was and when she got ready to go buy a new dress she didn't go into the the dress store and say well i i i like like to buy i like to buy a new dress i guess we got money in the bank no she stole her she says put this on my account because she knew who she was church we need to realize who we are we are the bride of jesus christ that's right the prophet of god said in the message the rising of the son he said now elijah was mr jesus christ he said elisha is mrs jesus christ church we have a double portion of what the prophet of god had for this day but we have to know who we are we have to rise up and accept what god has made us and stop stop mealy-mouthing around well you know we had that evangelist come and he preached and you know he said we could we could be healed well i sure hope it happens no you've got to know who you are so uh i won't charge any extra for that store i just think that's a good analogy but we have to know who we are and uh so do you know who you are this evening you should know by now church we have jesus christ on our hands what are we going to do with him young person you have jesus christ on your hands tonight what are you going to do with him in the message god's power to transform that prophet of god priests in september of 1965 brother branham said this he said god has the power to transform but the enemy satan cannot transform he can only deform god is the transformer satan is the deformer satan is a perverter pervert means to make some change over st make something worse than what it once was deformed means to change the original use of and what it once was only god can create satan cannot create he can only pervert what god has created he can only make worse what god has created and he can only make you worse than what god created you to do you have to know who you are now looking back to genesis 1 we find that the world was that was without form and void is that right that's right was nothing but darkness was upon the face of the earth brother brown said the earth was nothing but a complete chaos and brother branham said when the world was in that chaos condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the earth and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos from nothing into a beautiful garden of eden i thought that was beautiful church that is the transforming power of god the power that can take nothing and make something out of it make something wonderful out of it the power to take a teenage life that satan has tried to deform and pervert and make it a beautiful thing young person church tonight if we were ever a child of god then we were always a child of god stay with me now we were a potential child of god in seed form from the foundation of the world now growing up you may not have always looked much like a child of god at times and i'm sure i didn't didn't look like it didn't act like it but that does not change who you are are you with me that tonight every one of us needed to be transformed we were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity because every one of us was born in that condition and we came into the world speaking lies some of you here this evening still need maybe to be transformed now if the spirit of god can move upon the face of the earth this huge planet earth that was in total darkness if the spirit of god can move upon the face of the earth and make it something wonderful then i believe that the same spirit of god the holy ghost can move upon this piece of earth you're made up of 16 elements of the earth the holy ghost can move upon this earth and make something wonderful out of it this earth that was born in total darkness can be made something wonderful by the spirit of god in fact i know for a fact that that is true because it happened to me i was there when it happened and i guess i ought to know well if i could sing i'd sing the song but i i just know it can happen i've seen it happen i've been to 60 countries doing mission work i've seen it happen hundreds of times when a young person or sometimes an older person has just got so fed up with life and they're ready to give it all over to jesus christ and i see christ come and change the nature of that person and make them something wonderful now in the same message god's power to transform brother brandon uh talked about the tadpole you know what the tadpole is right we all know what the tadpole is he said uh that tadpole transforms from a little swimming element into a frog is that right see these boys know now that tadpole always had the potentials of a frog brother kenny where are you going with this just stay with me that tadpole always had the potentials of a frog it was a frog in the very beginning even when it was a tadpole it was a frog but one day it had to come to manifestation as a frog it had to have a transformation and when the transformation came it was now manifesting what it always was it had to have a transformation now we could also look at the caterpillar you all know the caterpillar caterpillar's a little warm you know it crawls here it crawls there you know but you know what that caterpillar was always a butterfly that ugly little worm was always a butterfly and at some point in its life it had to manifest what it truly was what its potentials were stay with me now that tadpole always had the potentials of a frog even when it was a tadpole one day it came to manifestation as a frog now we can look at the caterpillar that caterpillar always had the potentials to be a beautiful butterfly but it too one day had to manifest what it truly always was it was a butterfly even when it was a worm now it was a little worm and it'd crawl on the tree you know and maybe that little caterpillar in its early life maybe it was crawling into places it shouldn't go maybe maybe that caterpillar crawled into a disco somewhere or crawled into a saloon or crawled into some place it should not be but you know what that didn't change what that caterpillar really was it just had to come to manifestation of what it was truly meant to be now brother kenny where are you going with this praise the lord it was a butterfly even when it was a little worm and it had to come to manifest manifestation of what it truly was but the caterpillar had to be transformed into what it always was meant to be which was the butterfly and church young person tonight you may be sitting here today you are you may know that your life is not what it should be i don't know we're just throwing out thoughts here you may know that your life is not what it should be not yet having been transformed or coming to manifestation of what god intended you to be but i believe if you were raised in a message home i believed if you were raised in a messy church god knows all things god ordained you to be in a home like that he ordained you to be in a church and it was for your benefit it was for your glorification and it was for a manifestation to come forth in your life maybe your life hasn't yet manifested what god intended it to be you may be sitting here tonight and sometimes we don't know especially for young people you don't always know you may be doing things that you should not be doing even old people sometimes we get caught up in situations you know but the right atmosphere can be and i believe it has been created in this service tonight for you to receive your transformation all right brother branham said the preaching of the word creates the atmosphere whereby you can receive whatever you have need of now we know from science that every transformation takes place in a dark place did you know that every transformation takes place in a dark place watch now that tadpole is swimming around in a pond or lake or some water somewhere maybe a river and at a certain time of life that tadpole goes into the darkness of the water up near the shore under the old leaves that have fallen and it's it's a dark place in that water up near the shore and he goes into that dark place up near the shore somewhere and over time that there is a transformation that takes place in that dark murky water that darkness and that tadpole has a final transformation as a frog but it happens when the tadpole gets in a dark place now the tadpole had to get in the right atmosphere the right condition at the right time to receive its transformation now the transformation comes when he gets in a dark place also we find the caterpillar it had to go into the cocoon in the darkness of the cocoon to be transformed at a certain time of life it has to go that little worm has to go up into that cast cocoon and and seal it off and while it's in there in that dark place there's a transformation that takes place and that transformation transforms that caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly it has to come to manifestation and tonight the change of a sinner to a child of god stay with me now comes when the sinner comes from the darkness into the light are you with me but the transformation takes place while he's still in darkness while he's in darkness he may get so sick and tired of being sick and tired and he decides there's a transformation that needs to come in his life and when he gets in that condition then he's in the right place to receive the manifestation of what he already was he just didn't know who he was but he has to come to that none of that knowledge he has to come to that transformation he has to come to that manifestation of what god always intended him to be and a child of god i don't care what he's done i don't care where he's been i don't care the life that he's lived but i believe that if a young man or a young lady was born in a message home raised in a message church i believe that it was a child of god from the very beginning and it has to come to manifestation of what it already was what he or she already was but the transformation takes place in a dark place the change of a sinner to a child of god comes when that sinner comes from the darkness into the light but the transformation takes place while he's in the darkness then he comes into the light now that young person always had the potentials of a child of god laying within him all the potentials of an overcomer are in you right now all right let's let's move on from the from the center now let's let's talk about the christian who's having struggles but there comes a time when that creature that christian all the potentials of an overcomer are in you right now and you have to come to manifestation as an overcomer by your testimony and the blood of the lamb [Music] and when that transformation takes place it takes place in the darkness then he comes into the light all the potentials of a child of god are laying within you right now all the potentials of an overcomer are in you right now all you need for fulfilling god's purpose in your life is laying within you right now the potentials of an overcomer the potentials of more than a conqueror they are in you right now but you have to come to the knowledge of who you are you have to realize for once and for all that i am a child of god i am the bride of christ the bride of christ will have a double portion of what the the prophet had and it has to come to place we see it happening in foreign lands more than we do here in america when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost brother madam said everything you have need of from earth to glory is laying within you right now he said when you get the holy ghost he said i don't believe that god needs to add one more thing it's all there right then so the most important thing is receiving the holy ghost and how do we do that we do what acts 2 38 says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you might receive the baptism of the holy ghost you shall receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen all we need is god's power of transformation to bring these potentials in our life and bring us to manifestation now when i think of being transformed in the end time i can look back to genesis 1 that in order for a natural seed to be manifested it most must first be placed in a dark place is that right a natural seed and remember every transformation takes place in a dark place all right that natural seed has to be placed in the darkness of the ground in the darkness of the earth it has to be placed there in order for the law of light to work the long light was designed to conquer darkness church that's good news the law of light was made to conquer darkness if you have an area of your life where there's much darkness i've got news for you there is there is a light that can overcome the darkness and that light is jesus christ that light is the message of the hour that light is what god has ordained for his bride amen the love light was designed to conquer darkness put the seed in the ground let the sunlight shine on it don't dig it up every few days to see if it's growing leave it in the ground let the sun shine on it and it will come to manifestation and you can't stop it and if that's true in the natural how much more is that true in the spiritual i'm looking at a group of people who have had that experience in their life who have had darkness in their life they've put it under the light of god and it has come to manifestation and they know who they are put the seed in the ground let the sunlight shine on it and it will manifest you cannot stop it that seed will be transformed now brother branham said back in genesis 1 when the earth was covered in darkness he said every seed that ever would manifest itself was laying in the earth there right then you believe that the prophet said it god's power to transform has the ability to root over every seed laying in darkness say well brother kenny you're talking about a natural seed i'm talking about a spiritual seed also did you know that the prophet god taught us that natural things type spiritual god said in the book of isaiah i will bring treasure out of darkness church that's you and me we are the treasure that god has brought out of darkness and has shined the light of the word on and we are manifesting what god intended us to be from the very beginning down inside each and every one of you young people sitting here are you middle-aged person or you old person there is a treasure buried in your heart in your life and your earth and it takes the light of god to shine upon your earth and the light of god brings forth that treasure out of darkness some of us was in more darkness than others there's many forms of darkness but the law of light is designed to conquer any darkness yes sir in genesis 32 there was a transformation in the end time of jacob's life i'm sure you've read about it jacob was a shyster he was a deceiver but in the darkness of the night remember now transformation takes place in the dark jacob was a shyster a deceiver but in the darkness of the night the angel of the lord came and transformed jacob from a shyster and a deceiver into a limping prince with god that had power with god before men in exodus 12 it was in the darkness of the night that god sent the pillar of fire and delivered the children of israel is that right amen there was a transformation in the darkness of the night for the children of israel now we're we've said a lot of things we're we're going to we're going to get we're going to get to the point here okay now coming on down through time we see that the journey of jesus christ took him through much darkness jesus's journey of darkness is actually what brought deliverance to the world jesus was plunged into darkness on the cross at calvary why because there was a transformation that had to come in jesus's life a transformation had to take place when jesus was in the earth in the tomb because the savior had to be transformed jesus was a seed that had to go into the ground the darkness of the ground in order to bring life he was not meant to be in the darkness of the earth he was meant to be seated on a throne in heaven above but the transformation had to come the transformation had to take place here on earth in the darkness of the tomb and then on the third day we know the story the dark night finally ended for jesus and he which was dead was made alive forevermore and he now had the keys to death hell and the great glory of god and he rose up and he said because i live you live also with all glory hallelujah he is a live church jesus christ has risen from the grave and he is alive forevermore he lives today we serve a living god hallelujah my lord is not in a tomb my lord is seated on the throne of god with all power and authority over every sickness every devil and every unclean thing jesus is alive he has conquered it all and you are more than a conqueror because he's done it all he's fought every battle he's he's been everything that you've been into he knows what he's doing he knows where he's been but he overcame it all he is the mighty conqueror and you are more than a conqueror that's right now do you really know who you are hopefully somebody can hear from heaven tonight amen and they can have a revelation that they are more than a conqueror church you are more than a conqueror christ has won all the battles amen oh glory amen jesus is alive he's alive he was transformed in the midst of darkness now here is the real message tonight god promised that in the end time there would be an army of jobs to rise up stay with me now he promised that in the end time there would be a resurrection and a rapture now now we're starting to talk about the real end time transformations he promised jesus christ promised that in the end time there would come forth the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god church that's you and i god has allotted unto you and i a time of great manifestation and in order for that manifestation to come there has to be a transformation now in this day the world has to come to a time of gross darkness and we can see it happening all around us is that right we can see it in america i've been to many countries you can see it in many countries we see it in north carolina i'm sure you see it here in minnesota young people the seed of god church the seed of god has to be planted in the heart of the earth somewhere and that seed had to be planted in darkness in order for a transformation to come now we're talking about a great transformation when we talk about the rapture the prophet of god said actually it's just another dimension he said just one step away take one step and from this dimension into that dimension now if every transformation has to take place in a dark place where we at we look around us and it looks pretty dark this world looks dark but see the believer he doesn't get he doesn't get defeated by that he recognizes victory in that the darker it gets church the closer to home you and i are and every transformation has to take place in a dark place and this world has to become darker and this world has to become darker we might think it's dark now but it has to be darker it has to come darker in order for us to get out of here for order for us to have a transformation it has to be dark yes we're well on the way but i don't believe we're fully there yet because when the true full darkness comes god's people are going to be gone that's when they'll be transformed that's the message tonight in the darkness of this world there will come a transformation i plan to be in that transformation i plan to be transformed oh i've had many transformations in my life i've had many transformations but i'm looking forward to that great transformation that transformation that man cannot do that only god can do church we ought to be victorious we ought to be excited that's right where's the world they're getting more depressed all the time more depressed and more depressed because of war because of killing because of this because of that but the true child of god should look forward and say my lord is ready for the great transformation praise the lord that's the end time transformation that's my message tonight all we can talk about these other things we can talk about caterpillars and tadpoles and that's good but i'm going to talk about a final transformation an end time transformation that'll pick up the children of god pick up the bride of christ and take her right out of here he said the world won't know what happened it'll be so few the world won't even know what happened praise the lord but you and i know because we'll be in it we'll be a part of it that's right we'll part it we're part of that end time transformation oh my oh my we can see it getting dark around us oh my oh and the seed of god was not planted in denomination the seed of god was not planted in politics the seed of god was not planted in movies or music the seed of god was planted in nothing it was not planted in a great religious move it was not planted in religion of any kind the sea of god was planted in the heart of the bride of jesus christ in the heart of this earth this earth as individual members of the bride that was ordained to eternal life church young people the seed of god was planted in you as individuals and that's the most important those last two words were the most important as individuals it's not good enough to come to a message church where they talk about the end time message and we can come to a message church and we can sit down oh praise god uh i'm waiting for the rapture well no i don't believe that's going to get it revelation 22 and 17 22 and 17 says the spirit and the bride say come josh you've got a job to do elisha had a job to do elisha had a message it was not a different message than what elijah had it was the same message but it was a further manifestation of elijah's message and you and i we have a job to do we won't change the message but it will be a further manifestation of the message that the prophet brought us praise the lord the spirit and the bride say come come see a message come see a little group of people that are manifesting god in this come see a man come see a prophet amen come to our schoolmates come to our neighbors come to our people we work with come and see a message the seed of god was planted in the heart of the bride of jesus christ amen praise god thank you jesus that's why we are living in a time when there is such religious darkness upon the face of the earth can you say amen we are living in a time of such religious darkness that spiritually we cannot even see our hand in front of our face and you know it's true everywhere you turn there's darkness is that right you see darkness in the way people dress are the way people don't dress you see darkness in the books you see darkness in the magazines you turn on the radio you hear darkness you turn on the tv if you have one and you see darkness is that right it's true church you see darkness on every hand darkness has to come to this world and we know we're well on our way to gross darkness that's right you read the newspapers you see darkness you talk to your neighbors you hear darkness darkness everywhere darkness and religion darkness and denomination darkness and politics darkness and entertainment darkness in schools darkness in workplaces but right in the time when we are surrounded by the most gross extreme darkness that is the time for an end time transformation church glory it's a time of darkness for the world oh but that is a wonderful time for the bride of christ that is a glorious time for you and i my bible says god commanded light to shine from the darkness church you are that light when god put that in his word god commanded light to shine from darkness that's you you are the light to this world you are the light to your neighbors you are the light to the people you work you are like to school people school base you are the light to a lost and dying dark world you're not just some little nobody here listen we're the only thing that's holding this world back from total chaos once again it's this light that god has commanded to shine from darkness you are the light of the world amen my a wonderful time a glorious time for the bride of christ amen you can choose to look at the darkness or you can choose to look at the light i don't know about you but i choose to look at light church this is an exciting time for the bride of christ do you believe it this is our hour did you know that this is our time i i got news for you this is bride time this is bright age this is judgment time this is rapture time you and i are living in the most glorious time the prophet of god said if you were to ask the patriarchs of old what time and what age they would choose to live in they would choose this day and he said that's because we are living in the day of the greatest overcomer there's ever been there's more demons and more devils that we have to overcome in this day in this age than any other age this is the time that all the patriarchs of old would choose to live if you were to give them a choice oh my it's a glorious time church it's a glorious time he said when you get over there he said a lot of those old patriarchs they'll run up to you and they'll say brother how did you ever how did you ever overcome how did you ever overcome and lay out asea how did you do it [Applause] [Music] that tells me this is a glorious group of people i can't wait run up to me and say how did you ever do it i'll say through the message of the hour through the end time message which brought us end-time transformation oh it's a glorious time but but you have to know who you are it won't mean a thing to you if you're just floating through life say well i think i'll go to church today i haven't been for a couple weeks uh always something funny going on there kind of be exciting for me no church that ain't it if you know who you are you can't wait to get to church when those church church doors open amen praise god oh my this is an exciting time for the bride of christ this is our hour we are under a command of god we are under the word of god to bring forth light out of darkness this is the hour for the bride to rise to her feet spiritual feet and recognize her day and her message this is rapture time this is bride time this is the bride's day this is not a time for darkness for the bride this is shalom time this is joy time this is the time of greatest transformation there's ever been this is a new day this is a new beginning you are the shining light in a dark world today by the power of the resurrection this is a transforming day this is a transforming time when we look at the story of luke 24 early in the morning we see that two women had already come from the tomb of jesus they bore witness that his body does not lay there in that dark tomb anymore the stone was rolled away jesus had been transformed as the musicians come back the bible says joy comes in the morning oh my the bride's time has come church the time for weeping is over the time for depression and sadness is over there's a difference between a dead christ and a living christ all you have to do for a living christ in your life is to worship him the word of god is as a seed we make that seed grow by our praise because he was transformed you and i are transformed amen make that seed of god in you grow the prophet of god said this he said he said whatever little seed of god that you have in your life he said you make it grow by your praise and by your prayer you know i read that some 37 years ago and it struck home to me i was i was in a church i had gotten saved and i was in a church and i would come and i would sit in church and i'd listen to the singing and i thought it was great and i listened to the preaching and it was great and i just sat there but then one day i read what he said about you make that seed of god grow in your life by your praise and i just decided to put it to the test so i can remember going to church and i hearing something the preacher said that i knew that brother random said in the message and i would raise my hand sure i didn't say a word i just raised my hand and i'd go home that week and i could see god was blessing me so after a few weeks i'd come to church and i'd sit there and i hear something that was said or a song that was sung that meant something to me and i'd raised my hand i'd say amen sure and you know what god started blessing me i'd come to church and i'd sit there and after a few weeks amen i got a little courage you know got a little courage and uh god started blessing me and i noticed that things in the bible and things in the message were starting to come alive yes sir and so before too many weeks i was raised in both hands and then you know as time went on next thing you know i'm up and i'm praising god amen praise god and now the people in my church where i go they call me crazy i'm probably the only one in church that's dance i dance i shout i run the aisle and you know what the more even at this age even at this stage in my christian walk god is still blessing me more and more and i found out that what the prophet of god said was true he said to make that seed of god grow in your life you need to praise god the more i praise god the more he blessed me and i i think i told some of you a little bit of my testimony i i was i got married at age 18. my wife was 17. we had two children when one of them was three and one of us two we've been married about four years and my wife was killed in a car wreck and uh i was lost i mean i was i was i was destroyed you can imagine how it would be had two little boys to raise and and but we got it done but the secret to that me getting it done was my going to church and praising god because the more i went to church and praised god the more he blessed me with people in my life to help me with those children to to get me by and you know now i was raised in a fairly poor family we didn't have a lot but i always had a desire to try to travel i wanted to see the world you know the bible says god to give you the desire of your heart is that right and i started praising god then god gave me another wife 21 years later after my first wife died and a brother came to him and he said he goes have you ever thought about doing mission work i said yeah i think i would like it so he took me on my first mission trip and i just fell in love with it and god started blessing me in my work in my in my income in my life and always wanted to travel the world by god's grace he's allowed me to do that he's given me the desire of my heart because i found a secret that by praising god that seed that he placed down inside me it grew and it grew and it grew now i'm getting to be an old man i don't know how much longer i'll be here but you know what i feel good god heal me of cancer he takes care of me i sometimes get a you know an invite to go to a country i haven't got a dime in the bank and somebody will come along and say i i felt led to give you this you know god makes a way you know so i just i just i found a secret to success right praising god will make that seed of god that you have in your life grow and and god has been good to me make that seed of god in you grow give him praise find out who you are find out for sure that you know that you know who you are that you are the bride of christ jesus christ has the power to transform every dark thing in your life into light when he makes himself known to you by revelation you are then transformed when you repent of your sins and are baptized in jesus name you are now transformed you can start smiling again you can start coming to church again it's all right if you want you won't hurt too bad you can start singing again you can start testifying again you know brother random said the world today is trying to figure out trying to understand what it is that brings the transformation in a christian's life that's what your prophet said what is it they they're trying to find out that changes them and changes their life he said they will never understand it because they refuse to accept the one that does the transformation he said they refuse to accept their transformer himself they will never understand it until they come and accept the transformer himself and church is just a simple thing to do if you're a young person here you know just do

service tonight thank you thank you brother ken that was that was beautiful end time transformation amen amen and we're waiting for that last transformation we we're beginning to feel the darkness you know the bible says the darkness in egypt could be felt amen it was a darkness that could be felt and and we beginning to feel the darkness with everything that is happening around us so we know that the darkest hour of the night come just before the break of day brother branham said this and i want to i want to share that with you tonight uh in light of what i would rather preach tonight that uh if the if the saints report that i called up let's read it together verb said this he says but it will come that in his in in his promise for this age we are living in the age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him praise the lord amen uh ignoring who you are is is not enough like our brother said to talk you know to know yourself as a church member but this bride will be identified in him he says any woman must be identified with her husband for the two to be one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two to be one praise the lord and he is the word not the denomination the word we are to be children of the light amen and the light is the word which is made light for this age i want to read that again the light is the word which is mid light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word the word may flesh is the light of the age when you see it amen praise the lord if you don't see it it's not light praise the lord hi can you say i see there is light and you don't see it praise the lord now when god said let there be light he said it but until the light appeared it was not light that's right it was just a spoken word when the light appeared whether it took thousands of years like brother branham would say right right but god has spoken it praise the lord and i believe that's that's what our brother was speaking about tonight you know uh uh uh he he talks about muhammad ali being called you know the prophet of of of boxing there was a secret that ali had and and his secret was every time he comes against his opponent they fight and you know the boxers laying laying on one another he said into the ear of his opponent i'm the greatest then he gets back into fighting as soon as he laid on his he said i'm the greatest so he says that and it plays on the mind he says oh my god this guy is the greatest i got to fight he come closer he says i'm the greatest lord praise the lord and you have to say that to the devil i'm the bride of jesus christ praise the lord when he pushed you to the wall said devil i'm the bride of jesus christ that was the secret of muhammad ali that's why they call him the prophet of boxing amen he whispered in the ear of his opponent i'm the greatest then that god is fighting oh my goodness i got to beat this guy amen praise the lord but like brother branham said you know uh uh the word mid-flesh is light when you see it that's a very powerful statement very powerful and and and the thought that is behind it is that god has given you promise and until you see it not not that you read it until you see it that this promise is yours and for you to see it and identify with it that's the word me flesh yes sir if you just read it it's the word it's a promise but when you identify with it when you see it that this thing is speaking about me then that promise now has become flesh somebody has taken the word and has dressed themselves with it praise the lord and i mean that's what we should be doing every service reaching out and taking the promise and dressing i was saying all this is my praise the lord this is mine praise the lord this is mine it's not sitting down there and just watching some kind of a movie like the preacher is an artist just to entertain you you must be reaching out for the promise lord this is mine praise the lord i believe it's mine i believe your word can transform my life your word can break my habits your word can deliver me your word can bring healing the word may flesh is the light of the day when you see it you have to see it praise the lord let's stand on our feet tonight let's just buy our hatch open my eyes lord let just sing there tonight before we pray we want to see g jesus to reach out and turn and say that we lost [Music] [Laughter] oh yes we want to see jesus [Music] we want to see [Music] reach out and touch it and said that we love it oh yes [Music] our eyes long [Music] and if you realize in the date of creation which is a type of our redemption [Music] every day there was a transforming work that was done every day of creation every day even when god made man in his image that was something that have never existed so so that is the work of the holy ghost that is the work of the dynamics of this message that has been preached to us is to bring a transformation in our life every day you have to heal you have to yell you have to desire it you have to desire it just like our brother said water the world with praise learn to praise god learn to lift your hands up learn to say thank you jesus
