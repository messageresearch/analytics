[58:53] happy people amen amen amen amen so we
[58:57] glad to be in the house of the Lord and
[59:00] uh uh this morning I want to talk on
[59:02] something different I said I was going
[59:04] to continue my subject on the the foxes
[59:07] that spoil the vine but as I was
[59:10] studying during the weekend and I mean a
[59:12] lot of information was coming to me and
[59:14] I I just needed to put them rightly so I
[59:17] I felt like I wouldn't do a good job
[59:19] this morning so I thought that I I I
[59:22] would just change a little bit
[59:24] but uh
[59:26] that subject was not actually to go
[59:30] after an individual it was to go after
[59:33] the spirit that we are dealing with in
[59:35] this last
[59:37] day praise the Lord amen is to go after
[59:42] the spirit that God's people have deal
[59:45] with right from on town you know the
[59:49] word has always been persecuted when
[59:52] that word is about to be birth there is
[59:55] always always a persecution that comes
[59:57] on God's people and that's what I wanted
[1:00:00] to draw your attention to I wanted to
[1:00:03] draw our attention to it so we can be
[1:00:05] able to look at that uh in the light of
[1:00:08] God's word and and pay attention you
[1:00:11] know to things that are happening around
[1:00:13] us I mean uh uh uh politics and and and
[1:00:17] uh you know uh fit and everything that
[1:00:20] is happening we have to pay attention uh
[1:00:23] you know so that's that's what I wanted
[1:00:25] to go in on talking on that subject but
[1:00:29] uh uh uh and then also to to you know
[1:00:34] make you to to also see that as we as we
[1:00:38] look at those things together you know
[1:00:41] even about around this Christmas we know
[1:00:45] there's a prophecy of Rachel weeping for
[1:00:47] her children you know so the same way
[1:00:51] that uh we see you know the history
[1:00:54] there of herob you know destroying the
[1:00:57] little ones and and you know going after
[1:00:59] the life of the word we see there's a
[1:01:02] spirit you know uh that is that is
[1:01:04] consuming our age you know and and uh uh
[1:01:09] is it it can get us basy sometimes you
[1:01:13] know it it it really does not means that
[1:01:16] we are doing things wrong or we living
[1:01:18] wrong uh you know but we can get so busy
[1:01:23] and and then we can easily get to the
[1:01:25] place not to pay attention
[1:01:28] to the precious gifts that God has given
[1:01:31] us which of course are the
[1:01:34] children we can get so running after you
[1:01:37] know having a good degree and running
[1:01:39] after having a better job and running
[1:01:41] after building our finites and different
[1:01:44] things and then it's so easy for us to
[1:01:47] slightly forget
[1:01:49] to watch over our
[1:01:53] children praise the Lord amen and all of
[1:01:56] those things when we looking into that
[1:01:58] subject of the foxes that spoil the vine
[1:02:00] remember the Bible says the T of
[1:02:03] Vine which of course means the very
[1:02:06] young
[1:02:07] ones praise the Lord amen many of many
[1:02:12] of us have had our our experiences our
[1:02:15] walk with the Lord you know uh uh uh uh
[1:02:19] but then we must pay attention to the
[1:02:22] little ones they are the they are the
[1:02:24] future of tomorrow you know uh we must
[1:02:27] pay attention to them so those are some
[1:02:29] of the things we will be looking into as
[1:02:31] we as we talk on their subject but this
[1:02:34] morning I want to look into a prophecy
[1:02:37] also I want to remind you again the Old
[1:02:40] Testament is full of Prophecy the entire
[1:02:43] Old Testament is a prophecy because what
[1:02:46] actually it is is God expressing his
[1:02:49] mind is God expressing what he was going
[1:02:53] to do and then Grace God came down and
[1:02:57] took flesh among us to be able to
[1:03:00] fulfill what he have expressed that he
[1:03:03] was going to do so you will see there
[1:03:05] the old the Old Testament is just full
[1:03:07] of lot of Prophecy if you understand it
[1:03:10] that way looking at types and shadows
[1:03:13] will not bother you praise the Lord it
[1:03:16] will be easy for you to be able to
[1:03:18] connect connect and and realize that you
[1:03:21] know uh uh
[1:03:24] uh because if you look at it you look at
[1:03:27] Exodus chapter 19 why would God give
[1:03:30] people a commandment why would he give
[1:03:33] those people a commandment when they
[1:03:35] were just complaining uh uh against
[1:03:38] Moses a people that God says their heart
[1:03:40] work
[1:03:41] unconverted now what is the benefit of a
[1:03:44] commandment to an unconverted
[1:03:47] heart praise the Lord how did God expect
[1:03:51] for them to keep his word if they were
[1:03:53] not converted in their hearts
[1:03:57] so you see God's intention was never to
[1:03:59] give man a
[1:04:01] commandment praise the
[1:04:03] Lord and that is the reason why it
[1:04:06] became a FAL mistake to Israel when he
[1:04:09] said we will do all that the Lord says
[1:04:13] now so we want to look at this Genesis
[1:04:15] chapter
[1:04:16] 49 and uh uh Jacob was prophesying if
[1:04:19] you see what the Bible says right here I
[1:04:22] will tell you that we shall be you in
[1:04:25] the last last day so he's saying I'm
[1:04:27] going to prophesy on on every one of you
[1:04:30] people to tell you what will become of
[1:04:33] your life how are you going to end
[1:04:36] up praise the Lord because you have to
[1:04:39] remember the root to this
[1:04:43] game is to end well not how you
[1:04:47] start is to end well that is the root to
[1:04:52] the game of
[1:04:54] life it's not how you
[1:04:57] start is to end well and that's the
[1:05:01] reason why the Bible says he's going to
[1:05:04] says well done my good and faithful
[1:05:09] servant because we he's expecting us to
[1:05:13] end well praise the Lord so Jacob here
[1:05:16] is prophesying and and and telling his
[1:05:18] sons I'm going to tell you how uh how
[1:05:22] this
[1:05:23] uh uh
[1:05:27] how how H what is going to be you in the
[1:05:30] last day and I he go ahead and tell all
[1:05:33] his sons I want us to drop down a little
[1:05:36] bit the Bible says he got down here to
[1:05:41] uh to
[1:05:42] Judah and you will find that in verse 8
[1:05:46] of uh of uh uh chapter 49
[1:05:52] Judah thou are he whom thy Brethren
[1:05:55] shall pray
[1:05:57] well Judah means praise praise the Lord
[1:06:01] yeah he saying there whom that their
[1:06:03] Brethren shall
[1:06:05] praise thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:06:09] thine enemies which mean they will
[1:06:12] always be coming after you praise the
[1:06:15] Lord the father's children shall bow
[1:06:19] down before
[1:06:21] thee amen
[1:06:25] Judah is a lion
[1:06:27] with from the prey my son thou I gone up
[1:06:32] he sto down his c as a lion and as an
[1:06:36] old lion o shall Rose him up the serter
[1:06:42] shall not depart from
[1:06:44] Judah none a
[1:06:47] lawgiver from between his feet now
[1:06:51] that's what I want you to pay attention
[1:06:53] especially that Lord Giver between his
[1:06:56] feet the scepter shall not depart from
[1:06:59] Judah none a lord Giver from between his
[1:07:02] feet until
[1:07:03] shallow
[1:07:05] come and until him and unto him sorry
[1:07:10] and unto him shall the Gathering of the
[1:07:14] people be praise the Lord
[1:07:19] amen now so we see uh uh a prophecy here
[1:07:24] about the coming of of the
[1:07:26] Messiah God is giving Israel a promise
[1:07:31] here that there was going to be one that
[1:07:34] will rise among them to be
[1:07:37] king so you see when you look in the in
[1:07:40] the message rejected
[1:07:43] King we always says that God never
[1:07:46] wanted for the people to have King now
[1:07:49] then then this was not going to be a
[1:07:53] prophecy you see so it was not that God
[1:07:57] never wanted them to be king but God Was
[1:08:01] preparing them for the right kind of a
[1:08:06] kingship are we together because just
[1:08:09] like we said last week is that when you
[1:08:13] understand the
[1:08:14] principle of redemption the Redeemer in
[1:08:19] his Redemption every work of God every
[1:08:22] office of God if God do not step in it
[1:08:26] we will make a mess out of it praise the
[1:08:30] Lord Parenthood is an office of God he
[1:08:34] was the first
[1:08:35] parent if God do not step in Parenthood
[1:08:39] there is no mother book you can read
[1:08:42] that will make you a better
[1:08:45] parent there is no amount of
[1:08:48] discipline that you can carry
[1:08:51] out you need to take up that shoes let
[1:08:54] God step in it
[1:08:56] am so every every office of God until
[1:09:01] God comes
[1:09:03] down and step in it we will make a mess
[1:09:07] out of it so you see the promise of the
[1:09:13] kingship the father's children shall bow
[1:09:16] down before thee is not in a wrong way
[1:09:19] is because there was a king that was
[1:09:22] going to come out of the Trap of Judah
[1:09:25] praise the Lord amen now so you see and
[1:09:30] and that is the reason why when David
[1:09:32] came on the scene he was from the trap
[1:09:35] of Judah and it was 10 generation
[1:09:39] after it was 10 generation
[1:09:43] after the people uh uh you know rejected
[1:09:48] God's leadership when it says God
[1:09:50] shouldn't speak let let Moses speak unto
[1:09:53] us you know in all of that so uh so what
[1:09:56] I'm trying to say with all of this thing
[1:09:58] I'm saying is that there was a promise
[1:10:02] that God was going to raise up a king
[1:10:05] among them amen God was going to raise
[1:10:09] up an office of a king that he was going
[1:10:13] to step
[1:10:15] in Praise the Lord amen his desire was
[1:10:20] not to root us from distance he never
[1:10:23] wanted to be a god sitting behind the
[1:10:26] clouds to root us no he wanted to come
[1:10:29] down andure it Among Us Praise the Lord
[1:10:34] so he's prophesying here of an
[1:10:37] office that he's going to step in one
[1:10:40] thing and that's what is going to be in
[1:10:42] the Millennium it's going to be almighty
[1:10:45] God sitting on the throne amen and we
[1:10:48] going to have 1,000 years Hallelujah you
[1:10:52] better start making plans amen
[1:10:55] cuz I don't know what you're going to do
[1:10:57] with 1,000 years if you stay one day
[1:10:59] home you say you are Bor what are you
[1:11:01] going to do with 1,000 years on your
[1:11:03] hands praise the Lord stop making plans
[1:11:06] because it's going to happen it's not a
[1:11:08] fairy tale amen is going to happen it's
[1:11:13] going to happen just like your next
[1:11:20] birthday so we want to talk about this
[1:11:23] promise of
[1:11:27] shom we want to talk about this
[1:11:31] promise of
[1:11:33] Shalom shallow shall come until shallow
[1:11:40] comes a lord
[1:11:42] Giver is going to be between their feet
[1:11:45] until shallow
[1:11:47] comes now so we see yet as I said this
[1:11:50] is a
[1:11:51] prophecy and uh uh and Israel has looked
[1:11:56] to this prophecy for many
[1:11:59] years
[1:12:00] in expecting to
[1:12:04] have a
[1:12:08] king that was going to rule not only
[1:12:12] them as a as a Jewish people or as a
[1:12:15] Hebrew people but a king that is going
[1:12:18] to rule the entire
[1:12:21] Earth praise the Lord amen amen amen a
[1:12:25] king that was going to rule the entire
[1:12:28] Earth now if you look in the history of
[1:12:31] these people you will realize that uh
[1:12:35] they are God's chosen people but they
[1:12:38] have never one time had the privilege to
[1:12:42] ever rule the
[1:12:45] word praise the Lord they have they have
[1:12:48] been under the Egyptian ruling rulership
[1:12:52] they have been under the the the
[1:12:54] Babylonians they have been under the the
[1:12:57] Assyrians they have been under the
[1:12:59] Romans but they have never
[1:13:03] ruled so you see they look to This
[1:13:06] Promise because they believe that when
[1:13:09] shallow comes when their King comes he's
[1:13:13] going not only to rule from Jerusalem
[1:13:17] but he's going to rule the entire
[1:13:20] word praise the Lord amen this is their
[1:13:23] opportunity word they will rule the word
[1:13:26] that's how they look at
[1:13:29] it praise the Lord
[1:13:34] amen and uh so years after years and on
[1:13:39] and on uh they have looked to This
[1:13:41] Promise every time God will raise up a
[1:13:44] king that's the reason why when they saw
[1:13:47] in the in the kingship of David when
[1:13:49] they saw how God would take a a a little
[1:13:53] boy from following sheep and God will
[1:13:56] raise him up to such a place where I
[1:13:59] mean he will rule in St and dedication
[1:14:02] they thought that uh you know uh this
[1:14:05] this could be the promise because he's
[1:14:07] right from the tribe of Judah now you
[1:14:10] see they knew that it could not be Saul
[1:14:15] because Saul was not from the trap of
[1:14:17] Judah Saul was from the trap of Benjamin
[1:14:20] right so even though they wanted saw to
[1:14:24] be their King but in the back part of
[1:14:27] their mind they knew that this could not
[1:14:30] be the
[1:14:31] one amen but when David Rose on the
[1:14:35] scene and and and took his first
[1:14:37] challenge to stand against Goliath and
[1:14:41] bring the Philistines down man the the
[1:14:44] made of music right there right there
[1:14:46] the made of Music
[1:14:48] amen they made a music they started
[1:14:51] singing his name and and every eye
[1:14:53] started looking to was him why because
[1:14:57] he's he's born in the in the Trap of
[1:15:02] Judah praise the
[1:15:04] Lord and they and and they started
[1:15:06] watching and seeing how God was favoring
[1:15:10] H uh David and that's the reason why
[1:15:12] till tomorrow David is still the
[1:15:15] greatest King that ever ruled in
[1:15:19] Israel praise the
[1:15:23] Lord are we together
[1:15:26] the serp shall not leave Judah there is
[1:15:30] something that I I'm coming to that I
[1:15:32] left out during the
[1:15:35] year some we coming to the end of the
[1:15:37] year I need to reconcile all my pieces
[1:15:40] amen last
[1:15:42] Sunday let's take our Bible quickly last
[1:15:46] Sunday in the midst of the preaching I
[1:15:48] got caught caught up in something and I
[1:15:51] I always feel bad when I'm not very well
[1:15:55] prepared like that but I want to go back
[1:15:59] to something I was saying in Genesis
[1:16:00] chapter 24 let's let's go over that
[1:16:04] quickly praise the
[1:16:10] Lord I've always
[1:16:12] been accused of leaving people in
[1:16:15] suspense I'm guilty of
[1:16:17] it but
[1:16:20] uh the only
[1:16:22] way I can be delivered is when you pray
[1:16:25] for
[1:16:27] me Genesis chapter 24 now we were
[1:16:30] talking about
[1:16:32] El uh uh uh Abraham 7 we were talking
[1:16:36] about and what I brought up in that
[1:16:39] conversation is that every every Jewish
[1:16:43] marriage has been represented by by 10
[1:16:47] men by ERS so uh uh and I was trying to
[1:16:51] bring to you that uh
[1:16:55] elaser is mentioned the Bible says
[1:16:59] Abraham called his seven when you
[1:17:01] actually read through the the seven name
[1:17:03] is not mentioned but we know that it was
[1:17:06] eler uh because he was the one that
[1:17:09] Abraham took to be the head of his house
[1:17:13] actually Abraham wanted to take him to
[1:17:16] be his son the promised son God said no
[1:17:19] you will have a
[1:17:20] son are we
[1:17:23] together now so he's the one that is
[1:17:26] sent on this mission to get a bride for
[1:17:29] Isaac and the emphasis there is that
[1:17:33] because the commission is given to ELA
[1:17:37] so Ela is the
[1:17:39] messenger praise the
[1:17:42] Lord every every other one that helps
[1:17:45] laa to fulfill this they are all
[1:17:49] ministers they are all H uh men that you
[1:17:52] know that that you know that that are to
[1:17:55] stand Faithfully with him to be able to
[1:17:57] do this so uh let's let's go quickly
[1:18:00] because that's not what I'm talking
[1:18:01] about but I I wrote it down and uh
[1:18:04] because I wanted to cap on it uh 24
[1:18:07] verse 32 so there are three times these
[1:18:11] men are mentioned in this chapter that
[1:18:14] is that is the major reason why I'm
[1:18:16] coming to it because uh uh I want us to
[1:18:19] see that God don't break his timee
[1:18:21] whenever God raise up a messenger he
[1:18:24] raised up faithful man to stand by his
[1:18:26] side amen when he raised up Moses there
[1:18:29] was a Joshua and Caleb that stood by his
[1:18:31] side you know what to be able to carry
[1:18:34] out the commission so if you if you look
[1:18:36] here you will see the Bible says uh uh
[1:18:40] uh
[1:18:47] uh verse 30 he gave gifts verse 31 he
[1:18:51] said come in thou blesses of the Lord
[1:18:54] were for standed out uh without elar is
[1:18:58] now asked to come in for I have prepared
[1:19:00] the house and room for the camels and
[1:19:04] the man the man came into the house the
[1:19:08] man eler he he Ona the the camel and
[1:19:12] gave straw and and
[1:19:14] uh and uh Providence to the camel and
[1:19:19] water the
[1:19:21] uh and water to wash his feet and the
[1:19:25] men's feet that were with him so there
[1:19:30] were men with
[1:19:34] elar verse
[1:19:44] 54 I think that was that was what I I
[1:19:47] kind of a pick up on U
[1:19:51] uh verse 54 and and uh
[1:19:55] they did eat and drank he and the men
[1:19:58] that were with him and T all night and
[1:20:02] they rose up in the morning and he says
[1:20:05] send me away you see it keeps making El
[1:20:09] Ela is the one talking those men they
[1:20:12] don't have a
[1:20:14] message they are just
[1:20:17] supporter the conversation is between
[1:20:20] Ela and Rebecca
[1:20:22] father are we together
[1:20:28] so elah said send me a word unto my
[1:20:31] master that's verse 54 verse
[1:20:35] 59 in the mouth of two or three witness
[1:20:38] Les everything be established
[1:20:41] amen verse
[1:20:45] 59 58 and they call Rebecca and said
[1:20:49] unto her will thy go with this man now
[1:20:53] with this men with this man why because
[1:20:57] he had the
[1:21:00] commission the other guys they were all
[1:21:03] supporters they don't have a message of
[1:21:05] their own are we
[1:21:08] together
[1:21:15] hallu would I go with this
[1:21:18] man and she said I will go praise the
[1:21:22] Lord
[1:21:26] and they send away Rebecca and her
[1:21:29] sister and her nurse and Abraham seven
[1:21:32] and his
[1:21:34] men are we together Ruth chapter
[1:21:40] 4 Ruth chapter
[1:21:42] 4 let's s that quickly and then we can
[1:21:46] get back to our message
[1:21:51] here praise the Lord
[1:21:59] you love the
[1:22:01] Lord Ru chapter 4 the Bible say verse
[1:22:04] one then when boas then went boas up to
[1:22:08] the gate and sat him down there and
[1:22:11] behold the king's man of whom boas speak
[1:22:15] came by unto him he said oh such a one
[1:22:20] turn aside sit down here and he turned
[1:22:23] aside and he he sat down and he took 10
[1:22:30] men he took 10 men uh uh uh the the the
[1:22:35] the the Hebrew word there is uh m n uh
[1:22:39] muu n y a n that's the that's the Hebrew
[1:22:43] word for for those 10 men and he took 10
[1:22:47] men of the ERS of the city and said sit
[1:22:51] sit ye down here and they down now so
[1:22:55] you see that's where I'm drawing this
[1:22:57] thought from that uh uh the man with Ela
[1:23:02] could be 10 men but the the the the
[1:23:05] general idea there is that it was not El
[1:23:08] is that he had a commission but he had
[1:23:11] men with him amen praise the Lord so the
[1:23:14] fful ministry does not close when the
[1:23:16] prophet leave there are faithful man
[1:23:19] that would take the word and make sure
[1:23:20] that the bride is out of here are we
[1:23:23] together praise the Lord amen okay so we
[1:23:26] can close that chapter now and we get
[1:23:28] back to to
[1:23:31] business praise the
[1:23:37] Lord now
[1:23:39] so we talking yet about uh uh uh Shalom
[1:23:44] we're talking about the king now you you
[1:23:48] also remember that when we were talking
[1:23:50] about be it unto me according to your
[1:23:52] word we were talking about the
[1:23:54] importance of the Virgin birth and the
[1:23:57] prophet of God said when we get the
[1:23:59] Virgin birth straight we will get
[1:24:00] Christianity straighten out am amen that
[1:24:05] is one of the biggest thing that is now
[1:24:07] understood not only in the religious
[1:24:09] word even in the message of the hour
[1:24:12] because we we we we attach Mary too much
[1:24:15] to
[1:24:19] calym man in Preachers we preach Mary we
[1:24:21] blast her because we trying to attack
[1:24:23] Catholic Church Church it it blind us
[1:24:26] from seeing the mystery that is tied
[1:24:28] around her
[1:24:30] life if we get the Virgin birth
[1:24:33] straighten out we get Christianity
[1:24:34] straighten out that's what he said are
[1:24:37] we together so when we were talking on
[1:24:39] that we started talking on on uh on on
[1:24:42] the
[1:24:43] lineage that's what I want to go into a
[1:24:46] little bit I told you at that time that
[1:24:48] uh I was not I didn't had enough time to
[1:24:51] go through but but I want to take a time
[1:24:53] this morning to be able to bring
[1:24:55] something to you and and shared a little
[1:24:57] bit of a history for us to be able to
[1:24:59] appreciate this prophecy of until
[1:25:03] shallow
[1:25:04] comes are we together because you have
[1:25:07] to remember when bam in Numbers chapter
[1:25:11] 24 when he got a vision and he
[1:25:14] prophesied he says I see the star
[1:25:17] raising out of Jacob and
[1:25:21] acceptor so Jacob and I mean bam is also
[1:25:26] prophesying he's he's forseeing the the
[1:25:30] prophecy that Jacob has given
[1:25:33] you are we together
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] amen now you have to remember now uh uh
[1:25:42] those those men down in Babylon you have
[1:25:44] to remember the the the the the effect
[1:25:48] of the Babylonian captivity kept many of
[1:25:50] the Jews there in Babylon and and and
[1:25:53] those Jews
[1:25:54] they they they all started becoming
[1:25:56] people that's telling the stars and all
[1:25:58] of that and and and when these men saw
[1:26:01] the constellation of stars they saw
[1:26:04] three star coming together to form a
[1:26:08] constellation the the the the Holy
[1:26:11] Spirit reminded them of what bam said a
[1:26:14] star will rise out of Jacob so they
[1:26:17] started paying attention to that
[1:26:19] constellation and start watching and
[1:26:21] seeing how it was moving
[1:26:24] and for two years they travel and follow
[1:26:29] it and the star brought them right down
[1:26:31] to be
[1:26:35] him but baby was
[1:26:38] born and when they entered into the city
[1:26:42] because of what the prophecy said they
[1:26:45] said where is he born King of the
[1:26:51] Jews why because they were looking for
[1:26:54] shallow to come where is he born King of
[1:26:57] the Jews for we have seen his sty and we
[1:27:01] have come to worship Him
[1:27:04] am are we together amen and the people
[1:27:08] that were there have no idea they had no
[1:27:12] idea beside the Shepherds that was in
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:15] field beside uh uh Simeon in the temple
[1:27:19] that did the dedication of Jesus and the
[1:27:22] blind Hana
[1:27:25] H H
[1:27:26] Zacharias and Elizabeth those were the
[1:27:29] only people that
[1:27:31] knew can you think can you imagine those
[1:27:35] were the only people in the whole wild
[1:27:37] world that was existing those were just
[1:27:40] the handful of people that
[1:27:44] knew that a supernatural gift was born
[1:27:47] into the
[1:27:48] word that God has visited men the came
[1:27:53] saying what is he born King of the Jews
[1:27:56] for we have seen his St in the East and
[1:28:00] we have come to worship Him are we
[1:28:04] together they were following this
[1:28:09] prophecy except her will rise out of
[1:28:14] Jacob the lord gave her will be between
[1:28:16] their feet until shlow comes are we
[1:28:20] together amen so you have to to see here
[1:28:25] when when when when when David became
[1:28:29] king uh uh the Lord told David that he
[1:28:34] will raise up a son he will always there
[1:28:38] will always be one that will be raised

[1:32:54] lineage of uh of uh
[1:32:58] David praise the Lord you have to
[1:33:01] remember there were there were some
[1:33:03] kings in the House of David that really
[1:33:05] never did wear it praise the Lord and uh
[1:33:09] uh uh uh Mana said and all of these guys
[1:33:12] there were some that did wear Hezekiah
[1:33:15] Josiah and all of that but this this
[1:33:18] other young
[1:33:20] man rose up uh you can go back and and
[1:33:24] just and just make a make a a stud there
[1:33:27] I I I not want to go into a lot of
[1:33:29] things here and then I will lose track
[1:33:31] so Jeremiah chapter 20 uh 22 let's read
[1:33:36] from
[1:33:38] 28 is this man K now is called K but you
[1:33:44] go back into the Kings he's called
[1:33:49] jaon okay
[1:34:00] and this man could a despised broken
[1:34:03] Idol is he a vessel wherein is no
[1:34:07] pleasure wherefore are they cast out he
[1:34:10] and his
[1:34:12] seed and I cast into a land which they
[1:34:17] know not oh Earth Earth Earth hear the
[1:34:21] word of the Lord thus say the Lord
[1:34:26] right ye this man
[1:34:30] childless a man that shall not
[1:34:33] prosper in his days a man that shall not
[1:34:37] prosper in his days for no man of his
[1:34:41] seed shall prosper sitting upon the
[1:34:46] throne of David or ruling anymore in
[1:34:51] Judah praise the Lord amen amen amen now
[1:34:57] if God gave David an Everlasting
[1:35:00] Covenant praise the Lord that he will
[1:35:03] always have a seat on uh uh on the
[1:35:07] throne it ends right
[1:35:11] here praise the
[1:35:14] Lord
[1:35:16] because if if he if he's going to be
[1:35:22] childless if a curse was put on him
[1:35:26] which mean there will be no son after
[1:35:31] him so the natural sea line of David
[1:35:36] will not continue on the
[1:35:39] throne are you seeing the picture amen
[1:35:43] praise the Lord amen so you see Jesus
[1:35:47] has to come as a spiritual sea line of
[1:35:50] David not the natural sea line of David
[1:35:53] because because the natural sea line is
[1:35:55] cursed right here
[1:35:59] amen are you seeing the picture are we
[1:36:03] together like I said this is just a
[1:36:05] review now we went over this uh uh
[1:36:07] months and months ago we just trying to
[1:36:09] cap up here now
[1:36:12] so so uh
[1:36:16] uh this
[1:36:18] prophecy this prophecy makes the Virgin
[1:36:22] birth
[1:36:24] important that is the importance of the
[1:36:27] Virgin birth amen because the natural
[1:36:31] sea line is
[1:36:33] cursed just like through Adam our
[1:36:36] natural sea line is
[1:36:38] cursed from the
[1:36:40] four amen
[1:36:43] amen job said every man born of a woman
[1:36:46] is a few days in full of trouble our
[1:36:50] natural sea line is cursed so if there
[1:36:52] is any good good thing that would come
[1:36:54] out of us it must come through
[1:36:57] Calvary amen amen if any good thing will
[1:37:00] come out of our life it must come
[1:37:02] through a new birth and not through a
[1:37:05] natural sea line now who your father is
[1:37:08] who your grandfather is and what it will
[1:37:10] never come through that natural sea
[1:37:14] line so this prophecy right here make
[1:37:19] the Virgin birth very very important so
[1:37:23] when God to Israel I will give you a
[1:37:26] sign a virgin shall
[1:37:31] conceive praise the Lord amen amen I
[1:37:35] will give you a sign a virgin shall
[1:37:39] conceive and that's the reason why it
[1:37:42] was not it is not and it was not going
[1:37:45] to be there will be no human
[1:37:49] involvement God had to produce the blood
[1:37:52] cell God God had to produce the egg
[1:37:57] cells praise the Lord
[1:38:02] amen because right down here the natural
[1:38:06] bloodline running from from David has
[1:38:09] been
[1:38:10] cursed oh Earth listen this man will be
[1:38:14] childless he won't have anyone to rule
[1:38:16] on the throne of David
[1:38:24] are we
[1:38:26] together
[1:38:31] amen and that's the reason why that
[1:38:33] prophet of God says if we can get the
[1:38:35] Virgin birth right our walk with God
[1:38:38] will be right because pretty soon you
[1:38:41] will realize there is nothing you can do
[1:38:43] nothing you can add to God's finished
[1:38:46] work God all you have asked you are
[1:38:49] asked to do is to believe it let what
[1:38:52] God has done Amplified in your
[1:38:59] life because anything you want to add is
[1:39:01] coming from the curse and God will not
[1:39:03] take it he cannot bless what is
[1:39:10] Curse are we
[1:39:15] together praise the
[1:39:17] Lord Matthew chapter 2
[1:39:23] like I said it's a review stay with me
[1:39:27] and Merry
[1:39:49] Christmas praise the
[1:39:52] Lord am
[1:39:55] amen you love the Lord let's give the
[1:39:59] Lord a hand of Praise he's
[1:40:04] water
[1:40:06] hallelujah
[1:40:14] hallelujah Matthew Chapter 2 go right
[1:40:16] into the story Matthew chapter 1 that's
[1:40:18] what I want
[1:40:23] now what what I want to do now is to is
[1:40:26] to run in parallel something that I told
[1:40:28] you I was going to do so we can be able
[1:40:31] to see something
[1:40:33] here in the in the four gospel in the
[1:40:36] four gospel there is only Matthew and
[1:40:41] Luke that gave a
[1:40:43] physical uh uh uh genealogy of Jesus
[1:40:47] Christ only Matthew and Luke gave a a
[1:40:51] himine generation of Jesus Christ John
[1:40:55] when John introduced Jesus he said in
[1:40:57] the beginning was the word so John never
[1:40:59] went to no mother father he went right
[1:41:02] back to the beginning amen he went right
[1:41:05] back to the beginning and uh uh uh Mark
[1:41:09] was talking more of Jesus as the
[1:41:11] suffering seven so uh uh in in uh in in
[1:41:15] in Hebrew I mean in in the in the among
[1:41:19] the Hebrews or the Jewish or the Asian
[1:41:21] time there is not much that is known
[1:41:23] about a sevenant amen you don't trace a
[1:41:26] sevenant is spoke about right from his
[1:41:29] master are you getting the
[1:41:32] picture
[1:41:33] amen are you getting the picture because
[1:41:37] Mark is presenting Jesus as the
[1:41:39] suffering
[1:41:41] sevenant you don't give a geneology of a
[1:41:47] seven a servant goes back to his master
[1:41:53] you don't you don't you don't jump over
[1:41:55] the master and go to the seven parent no
[1:41:57] he honor the headship of this master so
[1:42:00] for now his beginning so so Mark did not
[1:42:03] give no geneology of Jesus Christ only
[1:42:06] Matthew and Luke praise the Lord amen
[1:42:10] and when Matthew give
[1:42:12] it verse one Matthew chapter 1 verse
[1:42:16] one praise the Lord are we together are
[1:42:19] you tired no
[1:42:25] the book of the generation of Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ the son of David the son of
[1:42:30] Abraham we look at this before why
[1:42:32] should it be David and
[1:42:34] Abraham in the right order Abraham came
[1:42:37] before
[1:42:38] David but here Matthew is putting David
[1:42:42] before Abraham why because he's going to
[1:42:45] dwell on the scepter he's going to dwell
[1:42:49] on that
[1:42:50] kingship he's going to trace the king
[1:42:52] line
[1:42:54] Matthew is under the inspiration to talk
[1:42:56] about King it is only in the in the Book
[1:42:59] of Matthew that recorded the wise men
[1:43:01] coming and say where is he born King of
[1:43:03] the Jews Matthew is the only one that
[1:43:06] recorded that so Matthew by the Holy
[1:43:09] Spirit he's honor the anointing to be
[1:43:11] able to bring us the record of the king
[1:43:15] amen amen he's going to trace the king
[1:43:18] line this one that is born King of the
[1:43:21] Jews he going to trace him back to
[1:43:25] David are we together amen because the
[1:43:29] kingship never started with Abraham it
[1:43:32] started with David are we
[1:43:36] together so he he he the Holy Spirit did
[1:43:40] that intentionally for us to pay
[1:43:42] attention the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:43:45] the son of David the son of Abraham but
[1:43:47] then he goes back again to Abraham be
[1:43:50] Isaac Isaac Jacob and then he said the
[1:43:53] records right are we together it's just
[1:43:56] beautiful it shows that God wrote this
[1:43:58] book
[1:44:00] amen through the inspiration of the Holy
[1:44:02] Spirit are we
[1:44:08] together now so when you when you go
[1:44:11] back and and you
[1:44:13] read like we would read here you could
[1:44:17] go on and
[1:44:19] on and read but there is something I
[1:44:21] want to bring bring to your
[1:44:27] attention go talks about uh uh uh Jacob
[1:44:32] Abraham beg get Isaac Isaac beg get
[1:44:35] Jacob and Jacob uh uh uh put put the
[1:44:39] verse up if you can for
[1:44:42] us and uh and and and and Jacob that's
[1:44:46] Matthew chapter one Jacob begar Judah
[1:44:50] and his Brethren and Judah
[1:44:53] beg Fise and and and zarat of TMA that
[1:44:57] that is that is the that is uh the two
[1:45:00] there and then it goes on there uh from
[1:45:03] Farah and and it it speaks of uh amam
[1:45:07] and uh
[1:45:08] Ameda and Nissan and then he beg Simon
[1:45:14] and Simon beg boas now Simon would be
[1:45:17] the general that got married to Rahab he
[1:45:20] be boas because both of them brought uh
[1:45:22] uh uh boas on the
[1:45:25] scene
[1:45:27] uh and then boas got married to Ruth and
[1:45:31] then give birth to to Obed and then OED
[1:45:34] will give birth to Jesse Jesse will
[1:45:36] become the the father of David are we
[1:45:42] together are you following
[1:45:44] me okay Jessie now we give birth to
[1:45:48] David and then in verse six the Bible
[1:45:50] says and Jesse beg David the king and
[1:45:54] David the king praise the Lord amen amen
[1:45:59] did you pay attention to that
[1:46:02] amen it goes through everything never
[1:46:05] call none of them the
[1:46:07] king but when it came to David okay it
[1:46:10] says David the
[1:46:14] king so the holy spirit is trying to
[1:46:17] make you to understand what he's putting
[1:46:20] emphasis
[1:46:21] on what is is this book it's not just a
[1:46:24] book to you know uh to to to sell
[1:46:28] Christmas
[1:46:30] decoration it's a book that has that has
[1:46:32] something that we have to pay attention
[1:46:34] to
[1:46:36] right you see
[1:46:39] there you go through it he he make that
[1:46:42] emphasis for a
[1:46:45] reason because we are talking about the
[1:46:49] scepter we are talking about the king
[1:46:51] line
[1:46:57] are are we together
[1:46:59] amen and Jesse beet David the king I I
[1:47:03] would tell let me be Earnest with you I
[1:47:05] never saw him until
[1:47:08] now I'm I'm Just Being Earnest with you
[1:47:12] praise the Lord I never saw it until now
[1:47:15] I didn't pay attention to that until now
[1:47:24] and Jesse beget David the king and David
[1:47:27] the king beget
[1:47:30] Solomon of her that have been the wife
[1:47:33] of Urias and and Solomon beg and you see
[1:47:37] it goes down again it never call none of
[1:47:39] them
[1:47:42] King are we together never call none of
[1:47:45] them
[1:47:47] King now so when you go through this
[1:47:50] record you go through this record let's
[1:47:53] come to this place let's get over to
[1:47:58] uh uh verse 16 if n would would just do
[1:48:02] too much reading and not do
[1:48:05] preaching verse 16 you go through all of
[1:48:10] that uh uh genealogy you get to verse 16
[1:48:13] it says and Jacob beget Joseph the
[1:48:17] husband of Mary of
[1:48:21] whom was born Jesus who is called the
[1:48:26] Christ are we together so the
[1:48:30] whole history that is given to us
[1:48:34] here is tracing a lineage that will
[1:48:38] bring Joseph into
[1:48:43] place why it had to be
[1:48:46] Joseph while the angel Gabriel had to
[1:48:49] speak to
[1:48:51] Joseph and says take
[1:48:54] Merit the reason why is that he's in the
[1:48:59] lineage are we together praise the Lord
[1:49:04] he's in the lineage but Joseph is not
[1:49:08] the biological father of
[1:49:10] Jesus no he's the one that God raised up
[1:49:15] to protect the
[1:49:17] gift are we together amen you will see
[1:49:20] what is important let's go to Luke chap
[1:49:22] chapter
[1:49:33] 3 are we
[1:49:36] together you love the
[1:49:39] Lord ah he's
[1:49:41] wonderful ah the Lord is
[1:49:44] wonderful amen what an awesome God we
[1:49:48] serve what a wonderful Jesus we serve
[1:49:52] Blessed Be the name of the Lord
[1:49:56] amen
[1:50:00] hallelujah now if you get over to Luke
[1:50:03] chapter
[1:50:04] 3 Luke
[1:50:06] started his own genology in a in a
[1:50:10] different way
[1:50:12] yes he started it in a different way and
[1:50:15] I will tell you I will show you
[1:50:17] why as we are together
[1:50:23] praise the Lord
[1:50:28] amen now if you
[1:50:38] read if you read take the time and read
[1:50:41] everything but come up here and read
[1:50:44] verse
[1:50:50] 23 and read verse 23
[1:50:53] Jesus
[1:50:55] himself began to be about 30 years of
[1:51:00] age praise the Lord amen according to
[1:51:04] Numbers Chapter 4 this was the age word
[1:51:09] a man was called into the
[1:51:13] ministry praise the Lord at 20 years A
[1:51:17] man was considered an adult in Israel he
[1:51:20] could go into the army
[1:51:23] but at 30 years if a man was to self in
[1:51:27] the
[1:51:28] Tabernacle that was the age that he was
[1:51:30] called to the ministry so there is the
[1:51:32] reason why the holy spirit is also
[1:51:35] putting this here for
[1:51:37] us and Jesus himself be to be about 30
[1:51:42] years of
[1:51:44] age as was supposed the son of Joseph he
[1:51:48] was supposed he was called the son of
[1:51:51] Joseph are we
[1:51:53] together which was the son of uh Hy
[1:51:59] whichever way you call it
[1:52:01] amen now if you read Matthew
[1:52:05] account Matthew said who did Matthew
[1:52:09] said Joseph father was can you
[1:52:13] remember
[1:52:16] Jacob
[1:52:17] Jacob when you read Matthew account when
[1:52:21] Matthew is giving the geneology he
[1:52:24] called Jacob Joseph father you come to
[1:52:28] Luke
[1:52:29] account he gave Jacob I mean he gave
[1:52:33] Joseph another father
[1:52:38] why praise the Lord amen amen you
[1:52:43] understand
[1:52:45] why
[1:52:49] now you have to remember that in Israel
[1:52:52] if you remember the the the the story of
[1:52:55] the daughters of
[1:52:57] zarapa when their father died they went
[1:53:00] over to to to the ERS and says we don't
[1:53:04] have a
[1:53:05] brother and our father was faithful to
[1:53:10] Moses he he's dead we will not have an
[1:53:13] inheritance they tried to shut those
[1:53:15] girls up but they were not ready to take
[1:53:17] no for an
[1:53:19] answer praise the Lord amen the the the
[1:53:23] the the pushed their M until it got to
[1:53:27] Moses when it got to Moses Moses told
[1:53:30] the elders let me consult the Lord about
[1:53:32] it he came back to the people he says
[1:53:35] what the daughters of zapi have said is
[1:53:38] right this is the way it would be from
[1:53:40] here on when a man do not have a son and
[1:53:46] he die the her The Inheritance goes to
[1:53:49] the daughter but the daughters cannot
[1:53:53] marry out of the
[1:53:55] tribe so the inheritance will not go
[1:53:58] across the
[1:53:59] border they have to marry in the tribe
[1:54:03] so the inheritance can stay right in the
[1:54:06] tribe amen are we
[1:54:09] together because when a man marries a
[1:54:12] woman if he's from the trap of Judah and
[1:54:14] marries a woman from the trap of
[1:54:16] Benjamin he bringing that woman into the
[1:54:19] inheritance of
[1:54:20] Benjamin praise the Lord
[1:54:23] but the woman cannot bring him from
[1:54:25] Judah to Benjamin no the men of Benjamin
[1:54:29] will not be
[1:54:31] Happ it's all because of headship God is
[1:54:35] the one that designed headship are we
[1:54:38] together so when a man gets married in a
[1:54:43] tribe he actually become a son of that
[1:54:48] house so what is being said here
[1:54:55] is more related to Mary's father than
[1:54:58] Joseph
[1:55:02] Father Joseph is brought into the story
[1:55:05] why because he is the
[1:55:09] husband of Mary are we
[1:55:13] together and you have to also I realize
[1:55:17] in the in the in in in the in the in the
[1:55:20] Hebrew uh uh they don't put women into
[1:55:22] their
[1:55:25] genealogy that's the reason why in
[1:55:28] Matthew genealogy the women that are
[1:55:30] listed they are Gentiles they are not
[1:55:33] Hebrew
[1:55:34] women terar
[1:55:37] Ruth
[1:55:39] Rahab they are all Gentile
[1:55:42] women are we
[1:55:44] together are you seeing the picture
[1:55:47] praise the
[1:55:49] Lord so yet in the Book of Luke
[1:55:53] Luke Luke is going to trace the
[1:55:57] genealogy to Mary not to
[1:56:03] Joseph are we together what we read in
[1:56:07] Matthew Matthew gave it to us from David
[1:56:10] to
[1:56:12] Joseph are we together amen now Luke is
[1:56:17] going to give
[1:56:18] us a
[1:56:20] genealogy that will be more related to
[1:56:24] Mary than to
[1:56:27] Joseph praise the Lord I will give you a
[1:56:30] clude you can go home and read the rest
[1:56:32] of the
[1:56:33] story you love the Lord so that is the
[1:56:36] first one there Jesus himself being
[1:56:39] about 30 years of
[1:56:42] age began I suppose the son of Joseph
[1:56:46] which is called the son of Hing now as
[1:56:49] we go
[1:56:50] on I want I want I want you to see
[1:56:53] something
[1:56:55] here praise the
[1:57:03] Lord praise the
[1:57:06] Lord
[1:57:09] hallelujah let's go over to
[1:57:12] verse
[1:57:14] 31 let's go to verse
[1:57:20] 31 let's go to verse
[1:57:25] 31 another sequence that I I want you to
[1:57:29] pay attention to here is that with
[1:57:32] Matthew he's coming from up down with
[1:57:35] Luke he's coming from down
[1:57:39] up okay you will see it you you you will
[1:57:43] see it it will make sense to you when I
[1:57:45] show it to you in the scripture let's
[1:57:46] let's go ahead right here verse thir
[1:57:51] one now not to just take much of the
[1:57:54] time there uh uh
[1:57:59] uh which was the son of uh Mel which was
[1:58:03] the son of uh Mena which was the son of
[1:58:08] M which was the son of
[1:58:11] naan which was the son of
[1:58:16] David Matthew what did Matthew use the
[1:58:19] son of David which son of David Matthew
[1:58:21] used
[1:58:24] use which son of David did Matthew use
[1:58:29] Solomon Matthew used Solomon because
[1:58:33] Matthew said Solomon of
[1:58:36] whom
[1:58:38] okay was the wife of of of
[1:58:43] uash so he used Solomon but here Luke is
[1:58:47] using another son of David
[1:58:53] not Solomon this time
[1:58:55] n David had a son called
[1:58:59] n are you seeing
[1:59:03] it praise the Lord are you getting the
[1:59:06] picture
[1:59:13] amen now he says Nan which was the son
[1:59:18] of uh David which was the son of Jesse
[1:59:21] and which was the son of oel which was
[1:59:23] the son of boas the son of uh Simon now
[1:59:27] we going down that same history but
[1:59:29] let's let's get to the end here the last
[1:59:32] verse verse 38 which was the son of enas
[1:59:35] the son of SE the son of Adam Adam the
[1:59:39] Son of
[1:59:41] God so Matthew is taking a far beyond
[1:59:49] Abraham he's taking this genealogy far
[1:59:52] beond Abraham right to
[1:59:57] God for us to really be able to Hon
[2:00:00] understand Genesis 3:15 when God said
[2:00:03] the seed of the woman will bruise the
[2:00:05] head of the
[2:00:07] sepin it was all in
[2:00:10] line so Matthew taking us right to the
[2:00:14] to to the to the to the very Son of
[2:00:19] God now the one from the beginning ad
[2:00:22] the Son of God and after Adam he came
[2:00:24] down to set set that took the place of
[2:00:26] Abel that King kill and then he came
[2:00:29] down down down and and he brought us
[2:00:31] right to this place so Luke is giving us
[2:00:35] that's that's the genealogy what I what
[2:00:36] I told you I was going to show you Luke
[2:00:39] is giving us a
[2:00:43] lineage Matthew is giving us another one
[2:00:46] in Matthew he's uh he's dealing with the
[2:00:48] kingship but yet he's given us a lineage
[2:00:51] that will bring Joseph part of the Trap
[2:00:55] of
[2:00:56] Judah Luke is more dwelling on Mary
[2:01:00] being part of the Trap of
[2:01:06] Judah I we
[2:01:09] together praise the Lord remember now
[2:01:12] we're talking about the scepter will now
[2:01:17] depart until shallow
[2:01:20] comes praise the Lord amen
[2:01:26] amen now there is
[2:01:29] something that
[2:01:34] uh there was something that took place
[2:01:37] in Israel
[2:01:44] history and and and this
[2:01:50] thing you know want to people stay under
[2:01:53] the burden of what is wrong if a person
[2:01:56] stay on a wrong
[2:01:58] headship uh uh uh it's so easy for them
[2:02:01] to believe that life is just like
[2:02:04] that I was talking to a friend I working
[2:02:08] you know and then he was he was just he
[2:02:10] was telling me about a you know a young
[2:02:13] man that was that you know that that
[2:02:15] came out of praising and he has spent
[2:02:17] this year in praising and then uh you
[2:02:20] know and and and quickly he ran into
[2:02:21] trouble so I was telling I I told him I
[2:02:24] says well I mean what we don't
[2:02:27] understand is that when a person has
[2:02:29] stay under that kind of a lifestyle they
[2:02:33] have been confined to a small space for
[2:02:37] over 5 10 15
[2:02:40] years when they come they need to be
[2:02:45] rehabilitated to to to fit the
[2:02:48] society because they are coming from a
[2:02:51] place where where there is forcing
[2:02:52] fighting you know and and and the space
[2:02:55] is
[2:03:00] small so many times people that came out
[2:03:04] of praising that are not
[2:03:07] help they have more chances to return
[2:03:10] back to
[2:03:14] praison that's what happen when a person
[2:03:17] has stay on a wrong teaching
[2:03:22] when a person has has grown on a life of
[2:03:26] abuse it's so easy for you to take it
[2:03:29] that is the way life
[2:03:32] is praise the Lord a person that grow up
[2:03:36] in a church where it's just it's just
[2:03:38] entertainment and formality if if if you
[2:03:41] have not been introduced to truth and to
[2:03:44] take the Bible
[2:03:46] serious nothing of the Bible will make
[2:03:49] sense to you that's right
[2:03:52] amen because your mind has been
[2:04:00] abused praise the Lord
[2:04:04] amen do you know that the Jews because
[2:04:08] of the many captivity that that that
[2:04:11] they have gone into there was a certain
[2:04:14] time in Jewish history where they were
[2:04:17] they were denying their
[2:04:20] identity the Jews were denying their
[2:04:23] identity a Jews will only will be caught
[2:04:26] either by his Hulk nose or he was
[2:04:32] circumcised they never wanted to be
[2:04:34] jewel because it looks like they were
[2:04:37] just going from one h h h h captivity to
[2:04:40] another captivity they were just going
[2:04:42] from one thing to another
[2:04:47] thing praise the Lord amen that's the
[2:04:49] reason why when you read you even read
[2:04:51] the Bible and you read history you'll
[2:04:53] realize that many Jews were taking on
[2:04:56] Roman
[2:05:00] identity just like how a person would
[2:05:03] come to America and become an American
[2:05:05] citizen many Jews were taking a Roman
[2:05:08] Identity or citizenship just so they can
[2:05:11] protect themsel they would rather be
[2:05:14] they would rather choose to be called a
[2:05:16] Roman than to be called a Jew
[2:05:24] are we together
[2:05:29] amen so that's what has been with with
[2:05:32] their
[2:05:33] history and there are a lot of things
[2:05:35] that have took place over the time but
[2:05:38] just like I said Wednesday night amen
[2:05:41] amen we were talking about uh uh H
[2:05:45] looking at the different Heroes that
[2:05:47] have ruled
[2:05:51] what I was bringing this whole thing
[2:05:53] about the
[2:05:54] foxes let me just read a little piece
[2:05:58] here that I got out of
[2:06:01] uh
[2:06:03] uh
[2:06:06] Josephus Josephus was a was a Jewish
[2:06:10] historian he make mention of something
[2:06:17] here that there was a time word it was
[2:06:21] on on Herod the Great I think when he
[2:06:25] died his son took
[2:06:27] over and the Jews just like I said
[2:06:30] Wednesday
[2:06:31] night the Roman gave them their own
[2:06:35] government the Roman could not tell the
[2:06:39] difference between the tribes of the
[2:06:41] Jew so they took Herod being an
[2:06:45] Edomite for him to be a
[2:06:49] Jew praise the Lord
[2:06:51] and uh uh so they set him
[2:06:56] over the Jewish people he was he was the
[2:06:59] he was their
[2:07:00] governor the King was
[2:07:03] Caesar but there was a period of time
[2:07:06] and and and they respected the the sindr
[2:07:08] council they respected the you know they
[2:07:11] were the one but listen to this now this
[2:07:14] is a Jewish history and giving us this
[2:07:16] little record when the members of the S
[2:07:19] hindrance found themselves deprived
[2:07:23] of their right over life and death I
[2:07:28] will trace this a little bit to to
[2:07:30] scripture I could I could go back and
[2:07:32] read a whole lot but I just want to save
[2:07:34] time
[2:07:36] here when the members of the Sanhedrin
[2:07:39] Council found themselves
[2:07:42] deprived of their right over life and
[2:07:45] death now let me pause here and give you
[2:07:48] a picture of it in the Bible you
[2:07:50] remember that uh
[2:07:54] uh
[2:07:58] uh at the death of our Lord Jesus when
[2:08:01] he was
[2:08:03] arrested he went before the sahed
[2:08:06] council caias and the rest of them they
[2:08:08] judge him for what they condemn him for
[2:08:11] but they did not have the power to put
[2:08:14] him to
[2:08:16] death are we
[2:08:18] together that power was stripped from
[2:08:21] them and for the sedran
[2:08:25] council for for the Jewish leadership
[2:08:28] that was
[2:08:30] important it was very important because
[2:08:33] according to the Lord of
[2:08:36] Moses it was the Elder when when a
[2:08:39] according to Deuteronomy when a boy was
[2:08:42] a disobedient son he was supposed to be
[2:08:44] brought before the elders the elders sit
[2:08:47] down they listen to the matter and then
[2:08:49] they judge he must be stwn to death
[2:08:52] all the judge the matter and say well
[2:08:55] you know he's uh it's a it's a mistake
[2:08:57] that he made he should be free so they
[2:08:59] had the power to do that now remember
[2:09:02] now what was the prophecy the Lord Giver
[2:09:05] will stay between the
[2:09:08] feet that's what Jacob said the Lord
[2:09:11] giving will stay between the feet of
[2:09:14] Judah until shallow comes so for them to
[2:09:18] be stripped of this right
[2:09:22] you know what they believe they believe
[2:09:25] that shallow will not
[2:09:30] come are we
[2:09:35] together are you seeing the picture
[2:09:39] amen so when these when these people
[2:09:42] when when when they were stri of this
[2:09:44] right when the members of the sahran
[2:09:46] council found themselves deprived of the
[2:09:48] right over life and death they cover
[2:09:51] their head with arches and their body
[2:09:54] with cyclo they actually
[2:09:57] brought they actually Tau that the Torah
[2:10:00] the word of God has
[2:10:02] failed they should have known better
[2:10:06] praise the Lord amen praise the
[2:10:09] Lord they should have known better why
[2:10:12] they should have known better because if
[2:10:14] they were steuding the word they should
[2:10:17] have known that the natural line was
[2:10:20] cursed in Je
[2:10:23] praise the Lord if they were steing the
[2:10:25] word they should have known that God
[2:10:28] says that he will give them a super sign
[2:10:31] a virgin will
[2:10:34] conceive amen praise the Lord amen but
[2:10:37] you see because these people have been
[2:10:39] abused with
[2:10:41] suppression Roman suppression and here
[2:10:44] it said the Romans have even taken them
[2:10:46] taking the right of the LA from them
[2:10:48] they had to go to the Roman for the
[2:10:50] Roman to gave them permission for them
[2:10:52] to be able to execute what the word of
[2:10:55] God said they should
[2:10:58] execute are you seeing the
[2:11:02] picture so to them the Torah has
[2:11:06] failed we are the
[2:11:09] lawgivers we are the one that must be
[2:11:11] able to to to to pass a judgment and
[2:11:15] execut it why should we go to these hens
[2:11:18] why should we go to the Romans
[2:11:22] praise the
[2:11:25] Lord now see another picture in the
[2:11:27] scripture the Bible
[2:11:30] says when he went to Pilot what the
[2:11:33] pilot said I have seen no fault with
[2:11:36] this man is that not what pilot said I
[2:11:39] see no fault with this man you know what
[2:11:42] they told
[2:11:43] pilot they said well then you are not a
[2:11:46] friend to
[2:11:49] Caesar we are going to report you to
[2:11:52] Cesar there is a man here claiming to be
[2:11:55] king of the
[2:11:56] Jews and you are supporting
[2:12:01] him are you seeing the picture yes yes
[2:12:04] that's right because they did not have
[2:12:06] the right to execute judgment they had
[2:12:09] to go to the Romans but they were so
[2:12:12] rough that they were even against their
[2:12:15] own
[2:12:16] word what did he said we don't have no
[2:12:19] King but Caesar
[2:12:22] this is a high
[2:12:23] priest this is the high priest of the
[2:12:26] sah hindrance
[2:12:28] Council that is saying we don't have no
[2:12:32] King but Caesar forgetting that God is
[2:12:35] their King forgetting that God promised
[2:12:39] them there will be a
[2:12:43] king do you see what happen when people
[2:12:46] mind is
[2:12:48] abused you can be sitting right there
[2:12:50] the word of God can be preached to you
[2:12:52] is gone over your head that's right
[2:12:58] amen they are reading the psalm they are
[2:13:01] reading the prophecy over and over but
[2:13:04] yet they cannot see the word that is
[2:13:06] identified in their
[2:13:10] mess who was the one that Herold called
[2:13:13] after the wise men left called these VAR
[2:13:16] Sr wait wait they say a king supposed to
[2:13:19] be born in bethem you know anything
[2:13:21] about it they say yeah we'll show you
[2:13:24] it they went to M chapter 5 it's
[2:13:28] written they knew where it was written
[2:13:31] but the word that was written was
[2:13:33] manifested before them they had no
[2:13:37] idea amen praise the Lord amen if these
[2:13:40] men were connected to the word that they
[2:13:43] were reading if they were connected to
[2:13:46] the word that they were preaching when
[2:13:48] the wise men said the king that is born
[2:13:51] in
[2:13:52] bethan they will start running to
[2:13:55] bethan praise the Lord they will start
[2:13:58] running to bethan to look for this King
[2:14:01] and worship him but they were
[2:14:05] disconnected they were
[2:14:10] disconnected that is the difference
[2:14:12] between religion and
[2:14:15] Christianity Christianity is not a
[2:14:17] religion
[2:14:18] people it's a relationship
[2:14:23] it's a
[2:14:25] relationship it's it's it's a life and
[2:14:28] blood
[2:14:30] think it's not a religion for us to just
[2:14:33] come and be reading bunch of quotes to
[2:14:35] you bunch of scripture to you just aside
[2:14:38] to you and we Rejoice yeah yeah the
[2:14:40] prophet said yeah yeah and it's just
[2:14:42] going over our head and the word is not
[2:14:44] being made flesh in
[2:14:48] us this word must be made flesh in in US
[2:14:51] these people
[2:14:54] deny they shut themselves off from the
[2:14:57] promise of
[2:14:59] God they said the Torah is no longer
[2:15:02] truth because God
[2:15:05] allowed the Roman to take the law from
[2:15:08] their hands but you know what josepher
[2:15:10] said listen to
[2:15:11] this listen to this it it will bless
[2:15:15] your heart he says here he says uh they
[2:15:18] actually thought that the Torah the word
[2:15:20] of God has failed they should have known
[2:15:23] better the scepter had
[2:15:27] indeed been removed from
[2:15:30] Judah but
[2:15:32] shallow had
[2:15:35] come while the Jews wept in the street
[2:15:38] of Jerusalem a young son of a carpenter
[2:15:43] was growing in
[2:15:45] Nazareth
[2:15:48] amen while they were in the street of
[2:15:50] Jerusalem
[2:15:51] rioting putting ashes on theirself
[2:15:53] tearing their clothes that shallow has
[2:15:56] has has not come you know God has
[2:15:59] abandoned them there was a young
[2:16:02] boy in a cal
[2:16:06] shop that was
[2:16:10] growing praise the Lord amen
[2:16:15] amen wow why they were they were they
[2:16:17] were rioting they couldn't see that this
[2:16:19] word how how can we be the people of
[2:16:28] God the word was right
[2:16:31] there the word has been made
[2:16:35] flesh the word was
[2:16:38] growing even went to the temple and
[2:16:41] stood before the priest they said who
[2:16:44] Child is This is it not the Capal son
[2:16:47] where did he get this knowledge from why
[2:16:50] couldn't they see it
[2:16:55] because God has blinded them
[2:16:58] yes
[2:16:59] religion has blinded
[2:17:04] them are we
[2:17:07] together you see why we can f right in
[2:17:09] the face of Truth we can argue right in
[2:17:12] the face of Truth
[2:17:22] you have to remember that a prophet told
[2:17:24] you that the greater battle that is ever
[2:17:25] fought is on your mind if the devil can
[2:17:28] abuse your mind by things you are going
[2:17:30] through if he can if he can abuse your
[2:17:33] mind and makes you to believe that God
[2:17:35] word is not
[2:17:38] true you can sit right in the
[2:17:41] Fulfillment of the word and still you
[2:17:42] don't see it that's right amen you can
[2:17:46] stay right there and God can be doing
[2:17:48] things and you still say there is no God
[2:17:56] there is nothing worse than spiritual
[2:17:58] blindness
[2:18:05] yes praise the Lord
[2:18:08] amen now that's the thing that caught my
[2:18:10] mind that brought me to all of this let
[2:18:13] me find a place to close here that
[2:18:15] brought me to all of this tracing and
[2:18:17] and and and down and down that we came
[2:18:19] this uh this afternoon
[2:18:21] is because there is a promise there is
[2:18:24] something that these people they hear to
[2:18:27] generation after
[2:18:29] generation when they were in Egypt amran
[2:18:33] cried to God and said God you promised
[2:18:36] us a deliver you told our Father Abraham
[2:18:39] that you would come down in the mighty
[2:18:41] hands and you will deliver us right in
[2:18:45] Babylon chadra mishad and abeno they
[2:18:48] stood before the king they say King let
[2:18:50] me tell you let me tell you king we are
[2:18:53] not going to deny Our God because he
[2:18:56] more than able to deliver us even if he
[2:18:59] don't deliver us we will not why were
[2:19:02] they saying that because they were
[2:19:04] looking to This
[2:19:06] Promise
[2:19:08] amen they were looking to This Promise
[2:19:10] that's why they were saying
[2:19:13] it they were standing right in the face
[2:19:16] of death their life did not matter
[2:19:18] because they believe that God word is
[2:19:20] truth yes but here is the people where
[2:19:22] the word came in flesh right in their
[2:19:28] face and they are putting arches this is
[2:19:30] a Jewish historian writing about his own
[2:19:33] people say they tore their clothes in
[2:19:35] the street they pour arches over their
[2:19:37] head that the Torah has
[2:19:45] fail praise the Lord
[2:19:48] amen we're talking about them we have a
[2:19:51] bunch of them that is on Facebook that
[2:19:53] is on uh uh YouTube when I was in the
[2:19:56] message I was in the message this
[2:19:58] message is not a man the message is
[2:20:00] Jesus
[2:20:03] Christ you cannot make a man feeling
[2:20:06] feeling attitude or feeling nature the
[2:20:08] message of
[2:20:10] God when a man fil it does not mean that
[2:20:13] God will f
[2:20:24] what did the prophet told us he said
[2:20:26] keep your eyes on the message not the
[2:20:28] messenger that's why he said he being
[2:20:31] the messenger he said keep your eyes on
[2:20:33] the message not the
[2:20:36] messenger because the message and the
[2:20:38] messenger there's a slight
[2:20:41] difference the messenger is only a
[2:20:44] carrier the message is the real deal
[2:20:47] amen praise the Lord amen the message
[2:20:50] Joy is not Jesus Christ but the message
[2:20:53] is Jesus Christ
[2:20:56] amen glory be to God
[2:20:59] Amen or maybe it might be ringing in
[2:21:01] your head a man and his message the same
[2:21:03] you don't understand it the way brother
[2:21:05] Bram said
[2:21:07] it a man in the message is the same
[2:21:09] because you cannot be preaching Holiness
[2:21:11] and be living
[2:21:12] filthiness you must live up to what you
[2:21:18] preach it does not make the messenger
[2:21:20] the
[2:21:22] message he's just a carrier of the
[2:21:24] messag
[2:21:32] amen the word made flesh right among
[2:21:36] them right among them shallow has
[2:21:41] come and they did not know
[2:21:47] it why because God Bass all their
[2:21:51] theological
[2:21:55] ideas all the thing where they have kept
[2:21:58] their family line they have kept
[2:22:00] legalizing they have kept white Garen
[2:22:02] and watching of hand and watching of
[2:22:04] part and all of those things that they
[2:22:06] did God bypassed the whole thing came
[2:22:09] down to a home of a little humble
[2:22:12] insignificant virgin
[2:22:17] Gil what did Mary did to deserve it
[2:22:21] nothing God Choice it's God's
[2:22:26] business it's God's
[2:22:30] favor praise the Lord and what you and
[2:22:33] myself you think we did for us to be
[2:22:35] exposed to the greatest message on the
[2:22:37] earth
[2:22:39] nothing don't brag in your family
[2:22:44] line or triou whatever it is nothing
[2:22:48] it's God's favor amen
[2:22:54] amen praise the Lord
[2:22:57] amen the word right there before them
[2:23:03] yes the word made flesh right
[2:23:07] there like brother Bram says they think
[2:23:10] that because they are the Royal Sea line
[2:23:14] they are of the Trap of Levi when the
[2:23:16] mesiah comes he will come straight to
[2:23:18] the temple and say my people here I
[2:23:22] am that's what they
[2:23:26] taught that's what they taught they had
[2:23:28] so much proud in their family line so
[2:23:31] much proud in their education so much
[2:23:34] proud no God bypassed all of
[2:23:37] that went down to Nazareth one of the
[2:23:39] most fiest
[2:23:41] city and pick up a young woman met her
[2:23:45] at the
[2:23:47] well obstructed all her marriage plan
[2:23:53] give her a heart to say be it unto
[2:23:57] me calling to your
[2:24:04] word praise the
[2:24:07] Lord that's the same thing that is
[2:24:09] happening in our time in our day
[2:24:13] right people you have to
[2:24:16] remember brother Brandon says
[2:24:20] it will come a time when it Chang that
[2:24:23] the word has
[2:24:26] failed he said it will come a time where
[2:24:29] it would really looks like this message
[2:24:31] has
[2:24:32] failed it has been like that all the
[2:24:35] time when God raised up
[2:24:38] Moses those people they were whipping
[2:24:41] them they were at their lowest
[2:24:45] point it was almost like they have fail
[2:24:50] that was when a delayer came and said
[2:24:52] let my people go
[2:24:56] amen thank you Jesus praise the Lord why
[2:24:59] because his strength is made perfect in
[2:25:01] our
[2:25:04] weakness when it looks like everything
[2:25:06] is feeling against you amen hold on to
[2:25:09] your
[2:25:11] fight when it looks like your health is
[2:25:13] feeling in everything is filling nothing
[2:25:16] is making sense to you let the word make
[2:25:18] sense amen
[2:25:21] say God I don't understand it but I know
[2:25:23] that you are there I know you are there
[2:25:25] and you are in control of the
[2:25:29] universe than you
[2:25:31] Lord praise the Lord let them say what
[2:25:34] they can say on on the on the on YouTube
[2:25:36] or on Facebook or whatever it
[2:25:40] is and there some of these things that
[2:25:42] is attacking the mind of our young
[2:25:46] people they are feeding into those
[2:25:48] things
[2:25:50] praise the Lord and they get
[2:25:53] confused they get
[2:25:58] confused because we are not stepping up
[2:26:00] to the challenge either to be able to
[2:26:04] live Christ before
[2:26:09] them sometimes to be able to sit down
[2:26:11] and and and and and tell them of our
[2:26:14] struggles tell them of the things that
[2:26:16] you struggle with that they will not
[2:26:18] look like aliens
[2:26:24] praise the Lord because sometimes the
[2:26:26] children looks like
[2:26:29] aliens we're talking about all when we
[2:26:31] came to the message we were on fire we
[2:26:33] used to fast and pray we used to do we
[2:26:34] never talk about when we fail when we
[2:26:36] make mistake we didn't say anything like
[2:26:38] that so the children just look like
[2:26:40] aliens why why why this thing is not
[2:26:42] making sense to me maybe I'm not
[2:26:46] called am
[2:26:58] praise the
[2:27:03] Lord are we
[2:27:07] together but just in a time where people
[2:27:10] are giving
[2:27:11] up and they are turning their back on
[2:27:14] the word and the thing that God has fed
[2:27:18] just in that time I got a good news for
[2:27:21] you Hallelujah God is raising up a
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:25] bride
[2:27:28] hallelujah
[2:27:30] amen just in the time where H uh H
[2:27:34] thought he got everything on the control
[2:27:37] he had set up the Galla for mikay he had
[2:27:40] said
[2:27:41] everything his chest was up there was a
[2:27:45] little girl on her knees she's saying if
[2:27:49] I die let me die but for a time like
[2:27:53] this God has raised us
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:56] [Applause]
[2:27:59] up praise the lord it's not time to give
[2:28:02] give up down on
[2:28:04] decency praise the Lord that we should
[2:28:07] give up our decency and start dressing
[2:28:09] like the world filthiness and all of
[2:28:11] these kind of unclean
[2:28:15] dresses because you will look foreign
[2:28:18] praise the Lord what are you like or now
[2:28:20] you already
[2:28:23] foreign praise the Lord so even if you
[2:28:26] try to be like them you will not
[2:28:28] fate because because you will be foreign
[2:28:31] to your conscience your conscience will
[2:28:33] tell you it's not right amen amen
[2:28:39] amen you try to please them but you be
[2:28:42] you will be you will be foreign to your
[2:28:44] conscience it will keep dealing with you
[2:28:46] because there's a word there that says
[2:28:48] this is the way walking
[2:28:52] it
[2:28:58] am I tell you people there is never a
[2:29:01] time in history where the word the
[2:29:04] message of the hour is just opening it's
[2:29:07] just like onion you're taking the onion
[2:29:09] peel it's just opening it's just
[2:29:11] unfolding the word is just becoming
[2:29:14] beautiful the word is just becoming I
[2:29:16] mean it's just becoming amazing amen
[2:29:26] Lord but yet there are people that are
[2:29:28] not seeing anything that's right I can't
[2:29:31] see anything I can't feel
[2:29:34] anything praise the
[2:29:37] Lord you were not called to
[2:29:40] feel you were called to believe and let
[2:29:44] that word that you are believing starts
[2:29:45] to create something in you amen let that
[2:29:48] believing word start to change you from
[2:29:51] inside that's why you were called
[2:29:58] on praise the
[2:30:01] Lord just like how the Virgin
[2:30:05] birth I have to close this
[2:30:07] thing because you allow me I can go on
[2:30:10] and on and on glory be to
[2:30:14] God but Merry Christmas anyway
[2:30:21] amen just like how the the the the
[2:30:24] Virgin
[2:30:26] birth redeem Israel from the
[2:30:29] curse that's how the new birth will
[2:30:33] redeem you from the
[2:30:35] curse praise the Lorden just like how
[2:30:39] the Virgin birth because there was a
[2:30:41] curse that came to David's
[2:30:45] line and the seed of David will no
[2:30:47] longer root on the throne yes
[2:30:51] until
[2:30:52] finally Israel will have a man called
[2:30:54] Herod from the tribe of Edom that will
[2:30:57] be govering them the people were so
[2:31:00] confused the Jews did not believe in
[2:31:02] Herod one
[2:31:03] bit they didn't believe in him that's
[2:31:06] the reason why they went to Pilot and
[2:31:09] then pilot said okay you go to your
[2:31:10] Governor Herod is your Governor you go
[2:31:12] to
[2:31:18] him praise the
[2:31:24] Lord they didn't believe him because
[2:31:26] they know that this man he was not an
[2:31:28] original
[2:31:30] Jew he they knew he was a
[2:31:33] hybrid they knew he was an
[2:31:42] Edomite are we
[2:31:47] together just like how the virgin birth
[2:31:51] turn the curse
[2:31:52] around that's how the new birth is going
[2:31:56] to turn our natural curse and L praise
[2:31:59] the Lord that's why Jesus said we must
[2:32:02] be born again not join the church Born
[2:32:07] Again
[2:32:08] amen not join a church not join a
[2:32:13] religion if it was not for the B ver
[2:32:16] virgin birth I mean the whole thing
[2:32:17] would be would be a curse
[2:32:21] but God says the seed of the
[2:32:25] woman will bruise the head of the
[2:32:28] sepin that's why he said right back
[2:32:30] there from Genesis and that's the reason
[2:32:32] why Luke had to trace the genealogy back
[2:32:35] to Genesis
[2:32:38] amen because that's where the promise of
[2:32:40] redemption was
[2:32:44] given it's going to be the seed of a
[2:32:46] woman a woman naturally don't have seed
[2:32:49] it's is a man that have it but this
[2:32:51] woman will be visited without a
[2:32:55] man praise the Lord amen and that's the
[2:32:58] same thing that God want to do with us
[2:33:01] people that's the same thing he want to
[2:33:03] do with
[2:33:10] us is Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:33:13] that's what Paul says is Christ in you
[2:33:18] the hope of glory the hope of Glory is
[2:33:20] Christ in
[2:33:25] you are we together
[2:33:30] amen we have a
[2:33:36] king this morning I first thought I was
[2:33:40] going to preach on the a throne in the
[2:33:42] manger I remember I spoke on that in
[2:33:44] South Africa last Christmas so that's
[2:33:47] what I was on and then uh I just got
[2:33:50] turned
[2:33:53] off but God has choose your
[2:33:57] manger
[2:33:59] amen your confused State your life that
[2:34:02] looks like you can't get it
[2:34:06] together amen aangel was a stinking
[2:34:11] Place amen it was a stinking place
[2:34:14] that's right but yet God choose a Manger
[2:34:18] to make a throne
[2:34:22] yes he choose a mananger to make a
[2:34:26] throne while Hera had a good Throne
[2:34:29] pilot had a good Throne Caesar had a
[2:34:32] good throne but when the king of glory
[2:34:35] was
[2:34:36] born his throne was in the
[2:34:38] manger his throne was in the midst of a
[2:34:41] menu
[2:34:43] P his throne was in the midst of
[2:34:46] smelling
[2:34:48] animals and that's the way God want to
[2:34:50] take the weakness of our
[2:34:52] body the struggle that we go
[2:34:55] through he want to make it through in
[2:34:58] your
[2:35:04] heart praise the
[2:35:06] Lord he want to set up a throne in your
[2:35:13] heart and as I said Merry Christmas
[2:35:20] May the king find a throne in your heart
[2:35:24] amen May there be a place in your heart
[2:35:26] where the word can be
[2:35:30] born now in your mind what you can
[2:35:33] reason about it or what you can think
[2:35:34] about it what you can explain about
[2:35:36] it or in your
[2:35:39] heart or the word can be
[2:35:42] born it will take the new birth to
[2:35:45] bypass your
[2:35:46] curse until you are born again you are s
[2:35:49] subject to the curse that run down your
[2:35:52] family line until you meet Jesus
[2:35:56] Christ you are subject to the curse that
[2:35:59] runs down your family line it come all
[2:36:02] the way from
[2:36:03] Eden it's only the new
[2:36:06] birth just like the Virgin birth it's
[2:36:09] only the new birth that will bypass your
[2:36:13] curse and give you a new beginning
[2:36:17] amen God bless you amen
[2:36:20] Merry
[2:36:23] [Applause]
[2:36:31] Christmas let's bow
[2:36:43] his oh sweet Jesus
[2:37:16] I don't know what you
[2:37:19] [Music]
[2:37:23] going through it I don't know what all
[2:37:25] your preparation for this
[2:37:27] Christmas remember Christmas is just a
[2:37:30] week and then the entire year
[2:37:33] ends and as much as as we want to spend
[2:37:36] time with family want to get gifts for
[2:37:39] our children it's also a time for us to
[2:37:43] be able to sit
[2:37:44] down and say Lord It's just seven more
[2:37:48] days and the the the year the calendar
[2:37:51] year will be
[2:37:53] closed it's a time for us to really take
[2:37:56] an inventory of Our
[2:38:04] Lives what what do the coming year hold
[2:38:06] for us we don't
[2:38:08] know we don't know
[2:38:25] [Music]
[2:38:31] but I just thought that this will kind
[2:38:33] of for l a a good foundation for what I
[2:38:36] want to go into talking about the foxes
[2:38:38] that spoil the
[2:38:41] vine because sometimes people think that
[2:38:44] you trying to you know attack individual
[2:38:47] no it's a
[2:38:48] spirit The Same Spirit that blinded
[2:38:50] those people that they could not see the
[2:38:56] word and you can just take this place to
[2:38:58] be like any other Church which of course
[2:39:00] we are just like any other
[2:39:05] church but if you bring in your wife you
[2:39:08] bring in your children here you better
[2:39:11] be serious about what is taking place in
[2:39:13] this place
[2:39:16] amen I don't think we should just take a
[2:39:19] like another
[2:39:20] service it should be a place where we
[2:39:23] must mean business because every time
[2:39:26] every time you spend here every hour you
[2:39:29] spend here is all part of your
[2:39:30] [Music]

[2:40:44] make himself
