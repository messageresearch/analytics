[38:11] Uh the Lord has been so good to us and
[38:14] it's good to see happiness in people's
[38:17] face
[38:19] you know and we have to be happy to be
[38:21] in the house of the Lord you know you
[38:24] know we should not be like the weather
[38:26] outside is cold and we get cold you know
[38:29] and we have to be constant at all time.
[38:31] How many of us are happy to be in the
[38:32] house of the Lord?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord can you give
[38:36] him a hand please?
[38:39] Amen.
[38:41] praise.
[38:43] Amen. As you are still standing, I would
[38:46] invite you to open the word with me.
[38:55] We'll open our Bible in the book of
[38:57] Ezekiel. Thank you so much, Sister
[38:59] Naomi.
[39:01] Uh I bring greetings from brother one. I
[39:03] had spoken to him. He asked me to greet
[39:06] the the church and we trust that uh this
[39:10] morning the Lord will visit us in a
[39:11] special way.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; How many of us are under expectation?
[39:16] &gt;&gt; How many of us are under expectation?
[39:19] &gt;&gt; As I always say, if you expect the men
[39:22] to speak, the men will speak.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; But if you expect God to speak to you,
[39:27] &gt;&gt; God will speak to you.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Because most of the time, we we humans.
[39:31] There's no ability that we have. Uh but
[39:34] we trust that God has placed a gift in
[39:36] our life that he can use it. He can use
[39:39] it. So we have to be available and it's
[39:41] not easy to be available.
[39:44] It's really not it's not easy. But I
[39:47] trust that the Lord will bless us.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 22:30.
[39:53] We will continue the very thoughts that
[39:55] we spoke on Wednesday
[39:57] and uh maybe by the grace of God I will
[40:00] take another angle and we trust that it
[40:02] will be of a blessing to you.
[40:06] Ezekiel 22:30
[40:13] the Bible says if you there you can say
[40:16] amen. Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And I sought for a man
[40:21] among them
[40:23] that should make an edge and stand in a
[40:26] gap before me for the land,
[40:29] and I should not destroy it, but I found
[40:33] none."
[40:35] Verse 31. 31. Therefore, if I pour out
[40:38] my indenation upon them, and I have
[40:41] consumed them with the fire of my wrath,
[40:44] their own way, if I recompense upon the
[40:47] head, sayeth the Lord,
[40:50] God is willing, is looking for a man.
[40:52] He's looking for a woman that will stand
[40:54] in the gap for a brother or a sister.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Or for somebody else that does not even
[40:59] know God.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, it says here that God
[41:03] has found none. I pray that this morning
[41:06] that God would touch somebody's heart
[41:08] &gt;&gt; that he can be that person that will
[41:10] stand in the gut for somebody else.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Now, first Peter chapter 22 verse 9,
[41:18] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[41:31] The Bible says, "But ye are a chosen
[41:35] generation,
[41:36] a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[41:40] peculiar people, that ye should show
[41:43] forth the praises of him that had called
[41:46] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[41:49] light." Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 1 verse 4
[41:56] and I'll have you seated.
[42:06] John to the seven church which are in
[42:09] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[42:13] him which is and which was and which is
[42:17] to come from the seven spirits which are
[42:20] before his throne.
[42:23] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[42:25] faithful witness and the first begotten
[42:28] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[42:32] of the earth unto him that loved us. Now
[42:36] I want you to pay attention. And washed
[42:39] us from our sin in his own blood.
[42:44] Verse six. and has made us king and
[42:49] priest. Unto God and his father, to him
[42:54] be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[42:58] Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Do you have any needs? You can show it
[43:01] with your uplifted hand as we pray.
[43:03] Gracious heavenly father,
[43:07] this is your time. Father,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; any scholar can go to school and read
[43:12] this portion of the scripture
[43:15] and bring their own interpretation.
[43:18] But when it comes to a divine
[43:20] interpretation,
[43:22] it only comes from you,
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Lord. You know, I'm just a man,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Father, but I'm putting myself available
[43:31] so that you can use this vessel.
[43:34] I am sinful as the rest of the brothers
[43:37] there saved by your grace. But Lord, I
[43:40] just pray may you take the portion of
[43:42] this scripture.
[43:43] May you bless it. May you break the
[43:46] bread of life because men shall not live
[43:50] by bread alone but by every word that
[43:52] comes forth father your mouth. Lord feed
[43:55] your people. These are not my people
[43:58] Lord God. They are yours, Father, and
[44:01] only you can minister to them the way
[44:04] you have intended them to receive it,
[44:06] Lord. Father, take away tiredness out of
[44:09] our midst, oh God. Oh God, we condemn
[44:11] the enemy out of this place in the name
[44:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ. May you have
[44:17] the preeminence and the control over
[44:19] this meeting from the from the beginning
[44:22] to the end. Be the alpha, be the omega.
[44:26] Lord God, I pray you know the needs
[44:27] behind every heads. Lord, your children
[44:30] are so burdened. Oh father, I may not
[44:32] know it. Oh God, Father, Lord, if it's
[44:34] even possible for you to turn this
[44:36] sermon into something different, oh God,
[44:38] but I'm putting myself available, oh
[44:40] God, may you answer their need, oh God.
[44:42] Whatever problem they may have, oh God,
[44:44] may you touch them in a special way. We
[44:47] want to remember your servant, our
[44:48] pastor that is far. Oh God, may you
[44:51] please keep him, Father. May you protect
[44:53] him, oh father, Lord Jesus. It will be
[44:55] good to see him again in our midst, oh
[44:57] God. Father, Lord, those that are sick,
[44:59] may you heal, Father. Those that are
[45:01] weak in faith, may you strengthen them.
[45:03] Those that have doubt, oh God, may you
[45:05] comfort them. Drop a message of
[45:07] encouragement that will lift them
[45:09] higher, oh God, in the faith that will
[45:11] actually know that they're not alone. Oh
[45:13] father, that you are there with them, oh
[45:15] father, minister to your people, Lord,
[45:17] as we are on expectation to receive
[45:19] something from you. In Jesus Christ name
[45:22] we pray. Amen. Thank you. You may be
[45:25] seated.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Once again, are you happy to be in the
[45:34] house of the Lord?
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Uh we trust that uh this little message
[45:41] will be of a blessing to you.
[45:44] Uh last Wednesday, how many of us
[45:47] enjoyed the service on Wednesday? Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; I pray that it was a blessing to you and
[45:52] with the intention to encourage you. And
[45:57] as we'll be speaking tonight or maybe
[45:59] this afternoon, not yet this morning,
[46:02] you would realize that everything might
[46:04] be very quiet and uh there is a reason
[46:07] why I want it to be quiet because it is
[46:09] really important. I don't want anybody
[46:11] to miss it. You know like Wednesday it
[46:14] was very quiet but I trust that these
[46:15] things are very very important
[46:18] you know and I spoke about who can stand
[46:20] in the gap because God is needing
[46:23] somebody to stand in the gap in needing
[46:26] somebody with his spirit in him can be
[46:28] able to do the same work that Jesus did
[46:30] on earth
[46:32] &gt;&gt; and as we spoke and I think this message
[46:34] has been really a burden in my heart
[46:36] because we cannot serve God the right
[46:38] way if we're not standing on the gap for
[46:40] somebody else
[46:42] &gt;&gt; you You know there are many people of
[46:43] God that are going through different
[46:44] things. They they are struggling with
[46:46] different things and sometime they feel
[46:48] they feel lonely you know but it it
[46:52] would be good to see a brother or a
[46:53] sister to stay a little bit on their
[46:55] knees praying you know for you. Can you
[46:57] just imagine somebody comes to you and
[46:59] say, "I've been praying for you last
[47:00] night."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; You know, how many of us have
[47:03] experienced such things, you know, it
[47:05] feels good to have somebody praying for
[47:07] you,
[47:08] &gt;&gt; you know, and and and even this is an
[47:10] example, you know, as a child, you fall
[47:12] away from your parents, you know, and as
[47:14] Elijah, you know, you can feel sometime
[47:16] you're going through something, you you
[47:18] can feel that somebody's praying for
[47:19] you. That feels good. Is that right?
[47:21] Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; But my message this morning is just to
[47:24] let you know that God wants you to do
[47:26] that for somebody else.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; God wants you to stand in the gut for
[47:30] somebody else.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; There are many people who may not even
[47:34] had gotten close to have the revelation
[47:36] that you have received. Maybe the
[47:38] message that you have received, it's a
[47:40] blessing for you. You enjoying it.
[47:42] You're saying amen to the word, but
[47:44] there is somebody out there that
[47:46] probably needs it, too. Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that you have, there's
[47:50] somebody out there that needs that same
[47:52] Holy Ghost.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe they want to be delivered from
[47:54] alcohol, but they don't know how to do
[47:56] it. You have been delivered. Why don't
[47:58] you just tell them as well? Says, "Come
[48:01] look at what God has done in my life."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; You know, and and if God can give us the
[48:06] grace to have that revelation to do it
[48:08] this morning, and I think it will be of
[48:10] a blessing.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now God is seeking for somebody
[48:17] and I'll just have a recap a little bit
[48:18] on what we have spoken on Wednesday you
[48:21] know and we we read
[48:24] uh in the book of Psalms it says
[48:27] therefore Psalms chapter 106 verse 23 it
[48:32] says therefore he said that he would
[48:34] destroy them has not Moses is chosen one
[48:38] his chosen stood before him in the
[48:41] bridge we spoke how the children of
[48:44] Israel has sinned against God and Moses
[48:47] was the one that stand in the bridge
[48:49] that stood in the bridge for the
[48:51] children of Israel. You know he says God
[48:53] if if you want to punish them you have
[48:55] to take my name out of thy book.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You know God cannot take the name out of
[49:00] the book out of his book the name of an
[49:02] elect you know because you are part of
[49:05] God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; God cannot take you out of his economy.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; You know he will leave the 99 and seek
[49:10] that one.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; You see that you know and and I just
[49:13] want to keep with you to keep this in
[49:15] mind. Israel was a chosen nation of God.
[49:18] God had chosen them, but he had so much
[49:22] patience and and mercy upon them. You
[49:25] know, they will complain at all time,
[49:27] but God will still reach down and and
[49:29] help them. They will ask for water, God
[49:31] will give them water. You know, they'll
[49:33] ask for food, God will provide food for
[49:34] them. But Moses was the man. He was the
[49:37] prophet of God that God has sent for
[49:39] that generation. And he was the one
[49:42] standing in the midst. When God was
[49:43] about to to exterminate them, Moses
[49:46] stood. He says, you know, father, no,
[49:48] don't do that.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; What the other nation going to say?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; God needs people like that.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say, it was not
[49:56] just Moses himself. It was the spirit of
[49:58] Christ in Moses.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God in Moses that
[50:05] actually stood up in the gap for the
[50:07] people.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; You see, you see how much we need the
[50:11] spirit of God. You cannot stand in the
[50:13] gap unless you have the spirit of God to
[50:15] do so.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; So as I'm speaking this morning to you,
[50:18] maybe you say, I don't see the
[50:19] importance of praying for somebody else.
[50:21] But it's because you have not received
[50:22] that spirit yet.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; When that spirit comes into your heart,
[50:26] it put it places you to action.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You stop praying for somebody else to
[50:30] stop crying for somebody else.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; It's only the spirit of God that will do
[50:34] that.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? It was the spirit of
[50:38] Christ in Moses
[50:40] &gt;&gt; that has done that. And we have read the
[50:42] quote here. Brother Benham says here in
[50:44] standing in the gap, he says, "Today, if
[50:46] God was going to liquidate the people,
[50:49] there was a time that when God had
[50:51] gotten tired of the foolish
[50:54] &gt;&gt; with our sin, we're constantly going
[50:57] wrong and it would stand like, you know,
[51:00] who would stand like Moses today?" This
[51:02] is the prophet of God standing in the
[51:04] gap. Remember he had called you know the
[51:08] the people that had rejected the message
[51:09] Rickas and Ricada
[51:11] &gt;&gt; and the prophet came and told him and
[51:13] said you should not call them this.
[51:14] These are still my people.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; But now he find himself in that position
[51:20] that he has to stand in the gut for the
[51:22] very people that have rejected his
[51:24] message.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? But now the question
[51:28] brother Venom is coming to ask the
[51:30] question who can stand who would stand
[51:33] or could stand. God would accept like he
[51:36] did Moses. The prophet of God was also
[51:39] chosen. He was elected of God.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; But at this moment he had a job to do.
[51:46] He had to stand in the gut for some
[51:48] people and continue to preach the me the
[51:50] message.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you imagine the prophet says,
[51:53] "I'm tired of these people that have
[51:55] rejected my message, and I'm going to
[51:56] walk away."
[51:58] &gt;&gt; God told him, "If you do that, your wife
[52:00] will leave you."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; So, he had to stay there. His job was to
[52:06] stand in the gut for somebody else and
[52:08] preach the gospel. So, if he had gone
[52:10] and rejected it, we wouldn't even be
[52:11] here.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; There was a message that he was it was a
[52:16] a commission to bring to the people.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] Now we can continue. And Moses own life
[52:23] on earth meant so much to God till he
[52:27] stayed the wrath of God.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And God would not cross over Moses.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; God could not cross Moses. He could not
[52:37] even kill Moses.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; This is the power of a of a chosen son
[52:42] of God.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; So you are not just somebody out there.
[52:46] You you are chosen. elected before the
[52:49] foundation on the of the world for a
[52:51] purpose.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; How many of us can actually stand and
[52:56] pray and say, "God, you cannot cross me.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your
[53:01] children.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your
[53:03] wife.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your
[53:05] husband
[53:06] &gt;&gt; that God would actually honor such
[53:08] prayer
[53:09] &gt;&gt; and not cross you."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Did you see that?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now standing in the gap, he says,
[53:16] "There was a scripture that always
[53:18] puzzle me. How Moses could tell God a
[53:22] better idea than God had till I find out
[53:27] that it was the spirit of Christ in
[53:29] Moses."
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God in Moses.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; God said, Moses, separate yourself from
[53:40] them. I will destroy the whole things
[53:42] and start with you. He said, Lord, he
[53:46] threw himself in the bridge and said,
[53:49] &gt;&gt; take me.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Blood out my name
[53:54] &gt;&gt; of these very people that had rebelled
[53:56] and his heart wait for them.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody that is
[54:02] assaulting you,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; that is criticizing you?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But you're still standing on the gun for
[54:08] that person. Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; It cannot be you as a human. We have
[54:12] ability. We have a you know sometime we
[54:13] have feelings.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; But if somebody has done something
[54:16] wrong, you still stand in a g for them.
[54:19] It's not your spirit.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit of men in you.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of God in you can do
[54:25] that.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; You see church,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; when when we are coming to church, this
[54:33] is what we are looking for.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ in people.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:40] that as a husband, your wife will hurt
[54:42] you so much
[54:43] &gt;&gt; that you will still pray for her.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, even if you can rebuke her,
[54:48] you rebuke her with the intention of
[54:50] redemption.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; You're not just condemning somebody. No,
[54:56] you're rebuking them with the intention
[54:57] to redeem them back.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And only God can redeem. Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So if the spirit of God is in you means
[55:07] that you have also the redemption power
[55:09] in you.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; You can redeem somebody else.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And we spoke about Jesus Christ. When
[55:20] Adam race has gone wrong, there is only
[55:23] one that could stand. The the first
[55:24] Timothy says, "For there is none.
[55:28] There is there is one God." Sorry. And
[55:32] one mediator between God and men, the
[55:36] man Christ Jesus.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; You know what a mediator means? Somebody
[55:40] that goes between God and people
[55:43] &gt;&gt; to restore relationship
[55:45] &gt;&gt; to restore fellowship
[55:47] &gt;&gt; to to restore harmony.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Because that's what Adam and Eve had
[55:52] lost in the Garden of Eden.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; But only one man was able to do it.
[55:59] Only Jesus Christ was able to redeem men
[56:02] back to that fellowship.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; If you are able to sin and ask for
[56:06] forgiveness is because of the blood of
[56:08] Jesus Christ.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; It's because one man stood for the God
[56:12] for you.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Because otherwise all of us will be
[56:15] dead.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; But there was something that I noticed
[56:21] as as I was just studying on this
[56:23] subject.
[56:25] Every time the judgment is about to
[56:27] strike people,
[56:29] God always sought for a man.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I find that it was very
[56:36] interesting.
[56:38] God always sought for someone that would
[56:41] escape judgment or stand in the gut for
[56:44] somebody else.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, God will actually
[56:49] steer the heart of someone.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve failed in the Garden
[57:00] of Eden,
[57:02] &gt;&gt; judgment was about to strike them,
[57:05] right?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; But God set an example himself.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; He took a lamb, he killed the lamb.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So the blood was the only requirement
[57:19] &gt;&gt; that could stand between a a sinful man
[57:21] and God.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:23] God came down. If you read Genesis
[57:25] chapter 3 verse 21, and Adam also and
[57:29] his wife did the Lord make a coat of
[57:33] skin and clothe them.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, God comes down and
[57:40] kill an animal.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; And the blood of that animal had to
[57:45] stand between, right?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Let's look at Noah.
[57:51] This was just before the anteliving
[57:53] destruction.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; God, the Bible says, "But Noah found
[57:57] grace in what? In the eyes of the Lord."
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Watch this. If Noah was not found, even
[58:04] his children would die.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Can you catch that?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; So, somebody had to stand in the gap.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to preach the gospel.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to preach that very gospel
[58:16] to his own family.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So the message of Noah save
[58:20] him, his family, his children, and his
[58:23] son, his daughter-in-law.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[58:31] Oh my.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Before I go further with Abraham, let me
[58:34] slow down here. Genesis chapter 12, God
[58:37] called Abraham.
[58:39] I want you to see how God is redeeming
[58:42] men back throughout the church ages. I
[58:44] want you to see that in the life of
[58:45] Abraham for a second here.
[58:47] Genesis chapter 12, God called Abraham
[58:51] out of Babylon. Do you see that? Genesis
[58:54] chapter 15,
[58:56] because to come out is justification by
[58:58] faith. That's the message of Luther.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? He called him out,
[59:04] chose him. That's the message of Luther.
[59:06] Justification by faith.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Then Genesis chapter 15, God confirmed
[59:13] the covenant with Abraham by the blood.
[59:15] sanctification by the blood. We spoke
[59:18] about on Wednesday, how he had exposed
[59:21] the the the pigeon and all of it. You
[59:23] see that? We spoke about on Wednesday.
[59:26] Genesis chapter 17, God came and
[59:29] revealed himself as Elshadai,
[59:32] the breasted one, the two breast,
[59:36] the old and the new testament.
[59:39] That's Pentecostal age.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That's in the morning. But in the
[59:42] evening, Genesis chapter 18, He Elohim
[59:46] in human flesh
[59:48] &gt;&gt; discerning the thought of Sarah behind
[59:50] the tent.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; That was the son of man ministry.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Can you catch that?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; But now is revealing himself to Abraham.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; But yet judgment is about to strike uh
[1:00:05] uh Sodom.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But between the visit and the judgment,
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Abraham is standing in the gap for who?
[1:00:12] For lot.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[1:00:15] right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Can you catch that?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Now God, Elohim and and and Abraham,
[1:00:22] they start having a conversation.
[1:00:24] Abraham is saying, "Perventure, if
[1:00:26] there's 20, would you destroy?" He says,
[1:00:28] "No, I'm not. It stopped going down."
[1:00:30] But God Elohim is knowing the thought of
[1:00:32] Abraham.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; That cannot be Abraham himself. Abraham
[1:00:36] could see his nephew dying,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; but he stood in the gut for his nephew.
[1:00:43] What happened? Two angel came there
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; to Sodom.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The world was in the sodomite
[1:00:54] condition expecting judgment.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Here is the abimeic seed
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; on earth interceding for the family
[1:01:05] members. So you see the the seed of
[1:01:08] Abraham in you,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; you would intercede for your brother.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You see, so many people say, "Wow, I'm
[1:01:16] I'm the seed of Abraham."
[1:01:18] But the seed of Abraham is not just to
[1:01:20] claim it.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; He blessed you to work to intercede for
[1:01:27] somebody else.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Let's let's go back to that table again.
[1:01:34] Let's look at
[1:01:36] Oh wow. I I surrender all. That's right.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You know, let's look at Rahab. This was
[1:01:42] just before the judgment of Jericho, the
[1:01:45] fall of Jericho. Do you see that?
[1:01:48] Now Rahab, Rahab is interceding for her
[1:01:52] family members.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? and that ye save alive
[1:01:57] my father, my brother, my brethren, my
[1:01:59] sisters, and all that I have and deliver
[1:02:02] our life from death.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; she stood in the gap.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; She requested for a true token. We'll
[1:02:08] speak about in a few minutes.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, people have to be
[1:02:15] anointed.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; With the spirit of intercession.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Saint, we are sitting in the sodomite
[1:02:22] condition.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; True. Soon enough here judgment will
[1:02:25] strike the earth. But where are people
[1:02:27] to stand in the gap?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We have family members that are not
[1:02:34] saved yet.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; They don't even know who William Breham
[1:02:37] is.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Our children, they don't even know who
[1:02:40] William Brham is.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; How are we expecting them to know to
[1:02:45] enjoy this message if they don't know
[1:02:48] what God has sent to them?
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Because there is a blessing
[1:02:52] that is attached to receiving a prophet.
[1:02:55] In the name of a prophet,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; you receive the reward of a prophet.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; So for them to enjoy said even to read
[1:03:04] your Bible, you must know the order to
[1:03:06] read the Bible to know how is it what
[1:03:08] relationship is between you and the
[1:03:10] author.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is Jesus Christ.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; So if you have an encounter with Jesus
[1:03:16] Christ, you would want to fellowship
[1:03:17] with him.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] Do you see that?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Rahab stood in a gap. Let's go to
[1:03:25] Jeremiah chapter 51.
[1:03:28] Now, this is a powerful scripture I want
[1:03:30] you to catch.
[1:03:32] Run ye to and fro from the streets. Oh
[1:03:36] my.
[1:03:38] Of Jerusalem.
[1:03:42] Okay, that's fine. I'll read it from
[1:03:45] here. run ye to and fro through the
[1:03:47] street of Jerusalem and see now and know
[1:03:50] and seek in the broad place thereof. If
[1:03:53] ye can find a man, if any be that excuse
[1:03:57] judgment,
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; that seeketh the truth and I will what?
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Pardon it.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; This is just before the Babylonian
[1:04:08] captivity.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah is sent as a prophet to warn
[1:04:13] the people. people the people he has
[1:04:16] became so dull of the truth they
[1:04:19] willingly rejected the truth
[1:04:23] you see when you're getting used to the
[1:04:25] word you can't hear it
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; it does not hurt it does not I mean does
[1:04:29] not mean anything
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; because people have to reach that place
[1:04:34] for struct judgment to reach to strike
[1:04:37] the earth
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; because god cannot send judgment without
[1:04:41] warning people first
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; that's why he sent prophets, he sent the
[1:04:45] word, he sent a provided way to escape
[1:04:48] that judgment.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; But since people has reached to a place
[1:04:51] where it the word of God has nothing to
[1:04:53] do with them, they will just reject it
[1:04:55] and say, "Oh yeah, I know what that
[1:04:56] scripture says.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; I know what that quote says."
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; They can't even quote it to you before
[1:05:00] you say it.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Because this is not the first time.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; This there's nothing new under the sun.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; This is just not the spirit. People die,
[1:05:11] but the spirit will not die.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; So sometime we are just influenced by a
[1:05:16] spirit we don't even know it
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; but there was somebody else
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; who had shown that same spirit
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; you know Jezebel in the Bible
[1:05:25] the spirit of Jezebel was there in the
[1:05:27] book of uh chronicles if I'm not
[1:05:28] mistaken right or kings
[1:05:32] but the book of revelation speaks of
[1:05:33] Jezebel's spirit
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; that this woman called Jezebel died a
[1:05:37] long time ago but her spirit was still
[1:05:40] going on in the Bible.
[1:05:43] So saints don't worry if you have a
[1:05:45] spirit when you die somebody else will
[1:05:47] will pick up that spirit.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Sometime we say oh wow that's no we
[1:05:53] carry spirits and we are under the
[1:05:55] influence of a certain spirit.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to the word?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; The people have refused to repent.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Their heart was not there toward God.
[1:06:09] They had no desire for God. That's why
[1:06:11] when the angel is passing by, God is
[1:06:13] seeking for a man. Can you imagine to a
[1:06:16] nation that God had chosen?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; The people have reached a place where
[1:06:20] there's not even one that could stand in
[1:06:21] the gap.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Say, are you catching this?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this just for a minute
[1:06:30] here?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; How many of us are standing in the gap
[1:06:32] for a brother or a sister every day?
[1:06:37] But we have reached a point where we can
[1:06:39] only see wrong in our neighbors.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say there can be wrong
[1:06:44] too because for the matter of fact, Lot
[1:06:46] was wrong. He chose the wrong thing.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You know, he chose the wrong thing. But
[1:06:52] that did not stop Abraham to intercede
[1:06:54] for him.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. There you go.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we speaking our
[1:07:01] subject is the ministry of intercession.
[1:07:04] Yeah,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; but as the part two I'm sorry I didn't
[1:07:08] mention it is Christ interceding spirit
[1:07:12] in this end time bride.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Christ interceding spirit in this end
[1:07:19] time bride.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; If God Jesus Christ had to intercede for
[1:07:26] us, the spirit of God in you would do
[1:07:29] the same.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Is that going to produce something
[1:07:32] different? It must be the same.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's why we need the baptism of the
[1:07:40] Holy Ghost.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That's why we need God in our life.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to mean business with
[1:07:47] God at all time.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 3:9. The Lord is
[1:07:55] not slack concerning his promise as some
[1:07:58] men count slackness, but is
[1:08:00] long-suffering to us word, not willing.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Not willing any should perish that all
[1:08:08] should come to repentance.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; This is God. This is God's mercy and
[1:08:14] grace.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Fortunately, we're not repenting. We're
[1:08:20] not making our life right. But let me
[1:08:23] tell you something. Only the elect.
[1:08:26] Only the elect will see the importance
[1:08:28] of repentance.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; It's not everybody that can repent from
[1:08:32] the heart.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; It's only that seed that can repent.
[1:08:36] When they're wrong, they're willing to
[1:08:37] fix it.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; No excuse. Fix it.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. That's not really what I meant.
[1:08:45] No, no, no. Fix it.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother, I wrong you.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Please forgive me.
[1:08:53] This is what I have done wrong.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And then this is what I'm repenting
[1:08:57] about.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Not a different version.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; oh no, that's not what I meant to say.
[1:09:03] No, no, no, no, no. Repent because you
[1:09:05] have done wrong.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Because repentance means to turn around.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; So if I was going from south to the
[1:09:11] north,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; if I repent means I'm going to the north
[1:09:15] back to the south.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't need to use another
[1:09:19] road around
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; is that same wrong I done wrong going
[1:09:22] this way I need to go back and fix it
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; this morning if it gets quiet it's okay
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; it's okay because what is more important
[1:09:37] is our soul
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I can preach you guys a go a message
[1:09:41] everybody jumps after that we'll forget
[1:09:43] about it
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; but after we leave here we can say oh
[1:09:47] god Please, I'm the one that is guilty.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I need help.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we come to church
[1:09:54] because this church is the judgment seat
[1:09:56] of God.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a problem at the
[1:09:59] river. I
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; I must be deal with things here.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; So, I want somebody that will tell me
[1:10:04] the truth that I won't miss it that day.
[1:10:06] And I don't want anybody to miss it.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I want everybody to be there.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; So, that's why I need to meet mean
[1:10:13] business this morning.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not hungry for anybody. It's just
[1:10:17] the love of God in my heart for anybody
[1:10:19] else that need help too.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; So that you can seek that lost soul too.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; The word of separation
[1:10:30] as they posting that first quote there.
[1:10:33] Who will all men
[1:10:36] be saved to come to the knowledge of the
[1:10:39] truth? God has a desire for people to
[1:10:41] come to know the truth
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; because this the truth that set you know
[1:10:46] set free you know it will set you free
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; but if you don't have the truth it's
[1:10:50] kind of hard to be free now the prophet
[1:10:52] continues he says here the word of
[1:10:54] separation paragraph 12 he says now I
[1:10:56] want you to know this
[1:10:58] went up a mixed multitude and that
[1:11:00] caused trouble among them as they got up
[1:11:04] but God in his foreign mercy
[1:11:07] not willing that any should perish
[1:11:09] perish, but all might come to
[1:11:12] repentance. Always makes the preparation
[1:11:15] a preparation of a way of escape for
[1:11:19] those who desire to come, but the way of
[1:11:22] escape.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; God has a provided way to escape
[1:11:27] judgment.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not going to be fair.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You see, if you are ignorant, you say,
[1:11:35] "God, I didn't know any better." Right?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Why would you judge
[1:11:40] somebody who never even knew the truth?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; But since you have received a great
[1:11:46] message such as
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; means that judgment is right at the at
[1:11:50] your back,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; somebody got to tell you that.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; The more knowledge you you know the more
[1:11:58] knowledge you know about something
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; you are
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; it comes with a responsibility.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; It's better you don't even know
[1:12:06] anything. But once you know it,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; you have a responsibility.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And every single one of us this morning
[1:12:13] have a responsibility.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; God has a provided way. It says he did
[1:12:22] it in the undelivering world. He did it
[1:12:25] in the days of calling out Noah or Moses
[1:12:29] rather calling out Israel. He did it in
[1:12:32] the day of the Lord. that the Lord Jesus
[1:12:35] is doing it yet today just before
[1:12:38] judgment are to strike the world. God is
[1:12:42] calling out a people
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; those who are willing to walk and to
[1:12:48] take God preparation
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; how to escape the wrath that is coming
[1:12:52] upon the earth
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and I trust that none that is in divine
[1:12:56] presence this morning
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; or will be or will ever have to stay
[1:13:02] here to suffer through the great wrath
[1:13:04] of God
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; that's not to come on the earth
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; brother Benham when he was 14 years old
[1:13:11] He went to hell.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "I would not even want my worst
[1:13:14] enemy to be there."
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Said sometime when when we think about
[1:13:19] hell, it sounds like, "Oh, wow. I mean,
[1:13:21] I'm going to go to heaven." We we not
[1:13:23] imagining it.
[1:13:25] May God open our eyes to see how it will
[1:13:27] look like.
[1:13:35] Now if you read the Bible in the book of
[1:13:39] Exodus,
[1:13:41] what God wanted to do with Israel in the
[1:13:44] natural, he also wanted to do it with
[1:13:46] the same for the spiritual Israel, which
[1:13:49] is you here this morning.
[1:13:51] what he had shown through the Bible in
[1:13:54] the natural, he is fulfilling it here
[1:13:57] before us.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Because what was done in the Old
[1:14:00] Testament was just a shadow.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; But God is fulfilling everything that
[1:14:05] was written throughout the entire Bible
[1:14:07] right here in our midst.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Israel was chosen of God among many
[1:14:17] nation.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; You are chosen among a lot of people.
[1:14:22] That's the natural, right?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Because they were the Ethiopian and what
[1:14:25] what not. Israel were not better than
[1:14:27] the rest of them.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; But God chose them. Remember, Israel had
[1:14:31] mistakes, too.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; They were like they actually got into
[1:14:36] idol worshiper, too. For a matter of
[1:14:38] fact, Abraham came out of that.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; You see, God can choose you. It doesn't
[1:14:43] matter how down in wherever you might be
[1:14:46] found. God's mercy can reach anywhere in
[1:14:49] the surface of the earth.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus died, he went to
[1:14:55] hell to preach to the soul that did not
[1:14:56] repent.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; He went down there to preach.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; So saint, it doesn't matter how far you
[1:15:02] are from God.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; There is still mercy and there is still
[1:15:05] blood available for you and I.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; But once the blood is still available, a
[1:15:11] preacher should tell you the truth.
[1:15:14] I don't want to wait till the blood is
[1:15:16] no longer the altar for me to preach the
[1:15:18] gospel.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So if I'm called, I must tell people to
[1:15:22] go back to fix things before the blood
[1:15:24] runs out
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; so if there is a blood available this
[1:15:28] morning if I would want anybody to come
[1:15:30] in right away
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; before judgment.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; But somebody got to stand in the gap.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody if you have that spirit then
[1:15:38] you have also a responsibility. Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; If you have not gotten there, ask for
[1:15:42] God's grace to reach. I'm not there yet.
[1:15:44] I need God's grace, too.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching this.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Most of the time, people think a
[1:15:50] preacher is the perfect guy up there.
[1:15:52] No, we need grace, too.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; He came to me as a revelation
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; to awaken you. But you have also a job
[1:16:00] to do.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; We are all servant of God.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; God has chosen the spiritual Israel the
[1:16:13] same way
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; out of the mud of sin out of whatever
[1:16:18] you can call it idol worship.
[1:16:22] Can you imagine in every family, you
[1:16:23] know, people are getting into different
[1:16:25] things. You know, African, they know
[1:16:26] what I'm talking about. They're into
[1:16:28] different things, but God has chosen
[1:16:31] you.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; In the midst of that mess, God is coming
[1:16:35] and say, "No, I want you. I want that
[1:16:38] one. That one. That's the one that I
[1:16:39] want over there."
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He comes and he picks that sister over
[1:16:43] there. He picks one.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And and this brother here, just pick
[1:16:46] one. God is choosing
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; because he knew you before the
[1:16:51] foundation of the world.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Your name was in the book written sign
[1:16:56] already saved
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; pardon.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; On this earth you are struggling
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; but on this book it's written pardon
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; because he knows that when you come to
[1:17:06] the knowledge of the truth you will make
[1:17:07] your life right
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; you will come to realization of the
[1:17:12] pardon
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; because God knows the end before the
[1:17:15] beginning. So if it's already written,
[1:17:17] pardon here, you're still running on on
[1:17:19] the opposite direction.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But when you meet God,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; it stop bringing you back.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; And then when you see, you come to the
[1:17:27] realization of that pardon,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; that quickens you
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; that changes your life.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; You were not saved at the altar when you
[1:17:37] came that day.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You were saved before the foundation of
[1:17:40] the world.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You came to realization. That's why you
[1:17:43] came to the altar.
[1:17:46] Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; God knows the end before the beginning.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; He knew that that day you will come to
[1:17:52] the altar.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I don't know
[1:17:54] what will happen at the end of the
[1:17:55] service.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; God know that somebody will come to the
[1:17:58] altar tonight.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Or this afternoon.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:18:05] God in his mercy.
[1:18:08] Oh, glory to God.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He is worthy. Can we give him hands?
[1:18:15] Oh, glory to God.
[1:18:24] Exodus chapter 19.
[1:18:29] And I want you to see God's intention
[1:18:30] here.
[1:18:32] God wants, now I'm getting into my
[1:18:34] subject here.
[1:18:37] And I want you to catch something from
[1:18:38] the scripture we just read. It says he
[1:18:41] had made us kings and priests. Do you
[1:18:44] see that? Right.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And he has washed us with his own blood.
[1:18:49] I want you to catch that.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; The blood
[1:18:53] and him making us king and priest. I
[1:18:57] want you to catch that idea throughout
[1:18:59] because I don't want you to lose. At the
[1:19:01] same time, keep in mind with the purpose
[1:19:03] to intercede.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; With the intent to intercede.
[1:19:10] Now God is showing his intention to the
[1:19:14] children of Israel.
[1:19:16] It says, "Now therefore, if you you will
[1:19:20] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:19:22] commandment, then ye shall be a peculiar
[1:19:25] treasure unto me all the people above
[1:19:29] all the people. For all the earth is
[1:19:31] mine,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[1:19:37] priests,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; and a holy nation. These are the word
[1:19:41] which thou has speaking unto the
[1:19:43] children, what? Of Israel.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; God is showing his intention.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "This is what I want you guys
[1:19:53] to become.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Not just the Levite,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; not just the priests. I want all Israel
[1:20:00] as a nation
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; to be priests.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; But there's a condition there. It says
[1:20:07] if you obey.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; But does it mean in my own ability to
[1:20:11] obey?
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Does it mean that?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; We're about to find out here for a
[1:20:15] minute.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; This is God intention again in Isaiah
[1:20:19] 61:6.
[1:20:21] But ye shall be called the prince of the
[1:20:25] Lord.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Men shall call you the ministers of God.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentile.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And in the glory shall ye boost
[1:20:39] yourself.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; God's intentions. What is clear? They're
[1:20:45] very clear.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? They're clear. I want
[1:20:50] all of you guys to be priests.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I want you guys to be kings.
[1:20:59] Genesis 19,
[1:21:01] Exodus 19, sorry, 8. And all the people
[1:21:05] answered,
[1:21:07] said, "All that the Lord has spoken, we
[1:21:10] will do." Moses returned the words of
[1:21:13] the Lord of the people unto the Lord.
[1:21:16] Brother one preach about this.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; It says this was the fatal mistake that
[1:21:22] Israel has made.
[1:21:24] They thought they would do it by themsel
[1:21:26] to obey God's word.
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; There was now a possibility for Israel
[1:21:32] to keep the word.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; God had already have a way to escape. Oh
[1:21:37] my goodness.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; You can't do it by yourself.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; You just come God's provided way.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Just come God's provided way. He will
[1:21:49] take care of everything.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he's saying obey, yield
[1:21:54] yourself to what he had provided.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Saints, we cannot keep the god God's
[1:22:01] commandment by our own self.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; From Adam until before the death of
[1:22:08] Jesus Christ, no man was able to stand
[1:22:13] until the perfect sacrifice came.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Even after rejecting the provided way is
[1:22:21] death.
[1:22:24] You can try all your best, you will
[1:22:26] still fall
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and you will fail.
[1:22:31] There's only one mediator.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; There's only one.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; There's not two.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; There's not your ability. There's only
[1:22:39] one. He has to come through Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; If it's not Christ means hell. The only
[1:22:46] way for you to escape hell is through is
[1:22:48] through Jesus Christ
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; is by Jesus Christ.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Let me read the quote.
[1:22:56] Jesus keep all his appointment and just
[1:22:58] Israel. Little did Israel know that when
[1:23:02] they were shouting the victory on the
[1:23:03] bank of the banks of of the river, they
[1:23:06] were they were only about four four days
[1:23:10] journey
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; about 40 miles.
[1:23:14] They were just close to that promised
[1:23:16] land. It's approximately is the distance
[1:23:18] from here to Mano. Approximately
[1:23:23] they were that close. But they didn't
[1:23:25] know what was waiting for them in front
[1:23:26] of them.
[1:23:29] Oh my. Away from the promised land. They
[1:23:33] didn't realize they were 40 years. It
[1:23:36] takes them It took them 40 years for a
[1:23:39] distance of 40 miles.
[1:23:43] Do you see that?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Just just think about these things. I
[1:23:48] want to slow down so we catch this. Are
[1:23:50] we together?
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; But what was it? Grace had provided them
[1:23:58] a prophet.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; You see, now what you can do is God's
[1:24:06] provision.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my goodness. I pray somebody
[1:24:11] will catch this.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; It says God had provided them a prophet,
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; a pillar of fire. We spoke about the
[1:24:18] angel of the covenant
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; that was leading them in the way.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire was leading them in
[1:24:26] the way.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; That was God provided way.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Do we have a prophet in the land? Yes.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Do we have the pillar of fire? Yes. The
[1:24:35] the pill of fire is still there.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; It's still here. Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Leading the church.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; A sacrificed lamb.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; The lamb was available. The prophet was
[1:24:51] there. The pill of fire was leading
[1:24:53] them. What the prophet says again? A
[1:24:56] deliverance.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Deliverance.
[1:25:03] It says, "And still they wanted what a
[1:25:07] law."
[1:25:09] They wanted something that they could
[1:25:10] have something to do in it into.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; They wanted to put their hands on it.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; What was the most rush mistake they ever
[1:25:20] made in Exodus what 19? When Israel
[1:25:25] rejected what? Grace and accepted what?
[1:25:28] Law.
[1:25:30] Every time that you say I will try to do
[1:25:33] it by myself,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your situation is.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Every time that you trying to solve your
[1:25:38] situ situation by yourself,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; you choosing the law instead of grace.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; God has provided a way to pray.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; To read the word.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; By the prophet to know look what I
[1:25:56] should do.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] And that pillar of fire is still leading
[1:26:03] the church.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; The same angel of the covenant is in our
[1:26:09] midst leading the church.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet is gone
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; physically like this,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of God is still on earth.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Because that's the ministry of the
[1:26:20] bride. She would have a ministry.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; She would prophesy again.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; True. She will not say something
[1:26:28] contrary to what the messenger has said.
[1:26:30] She will repeat what the messenger said.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the spirit and the bride
[1:26:35] say come.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Brother says the spirit, the bride, the
[1:26:39] prophet will say the same thing.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; So it means that the prophet had
[1:26:43] prophesied. You have a job to do to
[1:26:45] prophesy as well.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You're not prophesying something
[1:26:48] different than the word.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You're prophesying the word.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] You sing what the messenger have said.
[1:26:56] That's why brother says say what the tip
[1:26:58] says.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's a federal mistake.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Now when Israel made that federal
[1:27:09] mistake
[1:27:11] God intended
[1:27:14] he had priests. He had chosen Aaron and
[1:27:17] his sons. We're getting into that now. I
[1:27:20] want you to catch this before we start
[1:27:21] going faster here. Are you with me?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Now God, Exodus chapter 28 verse one,
[1:27:29] God speaks to Moses. He says, "Take that
[1:27:32] unto thee Aaron thy brother and thy son
[1:27:35] with him from among the children of
[1:27:37] Israel, he may minister unto me in the
[1:27:41] priest office."
[1:27:43] Do you see that? Even Aaron
[1:27:46] Nadab ahidu
[1:27:49] behazar
[1:27:52] and
[1:27:54] Aaron's son.
[1:27:56] So now the Levite out of the 12 tribe of
[1:28:01] Israel, the Levite were the one that was
[1:28:04] separated that belong to God.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Only the Levite was chosen for God
[1:28:11] alone.
[1:28:12] Now out of the Levite,
[1:28:16] God is choosing priests.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; you catching this?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Now Moses and Aaron, they were Levite.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; but when God spoke to Moses, Moses was a
[1:28:28] prophet,
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; but Aaron was the high priest.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; So the ministry of ministering in the
[1:28:36] tabernacle was given to Aaron and his
[1:28:38] sons.
[1:28:40] That was not Aaron choice. That was God
[1:28:43] choice.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And the reason why is appointing a high
[1:28:48] priest to stand there
[1:28:51] is to offer sacrifice for their own sin
[1:28:54] and for the sin of the people. So the
[1:28:57] high priest has to stand in between.
[1:29:00] He will be the only one that will enter
[1:29:02] into the holies of holies to offer the
[1:29:05] sacrifice or for the pardon of the
[1:29:06] people.
[1:29:08] Do you see that? That's the person God
[1:29:10] had chosen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; now, all the Levites
[1:29:15] were not appointed to the same job.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; So out of the Levite, the priest came
[1:29:22] out,
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; which was Aaron as a son.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; They were the only one appointed to work
[1:29:29] in the tabernacle. The Levite had
[1:29:31] different other job outside, you know,
[1:29:34] making sure that they carry the ark
[1:29:35] because remember the Levite had to carry
[1:29:37] the ark.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the priest,
[1:29:42] not all all priests are Levite.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; But not all Levites are priests.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to to remember that.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You can read the Bible, you can find it.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[1:29:58] They were appointed to bring sacrifice.
[1:30:02] They will enter. They will wear in a
[1:30:03] certain way. The high priest will have
[1:30:06] all this garment on. And you know, I'll
[1:30:09] tell you something. There's one that was
[1:30:10] appointed to wash the high priest. That
[1:30:14] was Moses alone.
[1:30:16] Moses is the one that had to wash them.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Put the clothes on.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; That's Aaron and his children.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Only a prophet.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch that. Remember that.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Because we're going to change the high
[1:30:29] priest in few minutes here.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; We have a high priest that can be
[1:30:34] touched by the feeling of infirmity.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; That's the Lord Jesus Christ. We'll talk
[1:30:38] about it in a few minutes here.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Moses was the only one that had to watch
[1:30:44] the high priest.
[1:30:46] They would offer sacrifice daily. But to
[1:30:48] Aaron, he had to enter into the holies
[1:30:51] of holies once a year.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; To atone for the sins of the people.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Because now remember in Genesis it was
[1:31:01] by the blood. You see?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; So now here it must be the blood too.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Because without the shedding of blood
[1:31:10] there's no forgiveness of sin.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; So the blood was the only requirement of
[1:31:15] God to stand in between.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see the blood, I will pass
[1:31:19] over you.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; The blood is the requirement. When God
[1:31:23] sees the blood, he cannot pass the
[1:31:25] blood. He says, "Kill an animal." This
[1:31:27] is the animal has to be blameless.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; We'll go faster here.
[1:31:35] The blood of the lamb was the only
[1:31:37] requirement. Now, in Hebrew 10:1,
[1:31:41] for the law having a shadow
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; of good things what to come. This was
[1:31:47] just a shadow.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; But there is something good that is
[1:31:50] coming.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Let's change a little bit here. Let's
[1:31:55] enter into the this was the priest the
[1:31:59] Levitical priesthood.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; But we have a higher priesthood than
[1:32:03] that.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's a mechicc priesthood
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; that has no father, no mother, no
[1:32:08] beginning of days. Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And brother says this mech has become
[1:32:12] Jesus Christ
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; because Mechisedc is the theophony.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; But that theophony has become a man in
[1:32:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is another subject.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; That that's another subject for another
[1:32:28] day.
[1:32:30] You remember I mentioned the Old
[1:32:31] Testament, Moses had to introduce the
[1:32:33] high priest, wash him and his son, the
[1:32:37] sacrifice. Now, not just Aaron and his
[1:32:40] children, they had to be washed in the
[1:32:42] lav.
[1:32:44] You see, because there was the breast
[1:32:45] and altar after the breast and altar, we
[1:32:49] enter into the lav
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; and then you face the holiest of the the
[1:32:53] uh the uh the the holy place. That's
[1:32:57] where the candlestick and the table of
[1:32:58] spread, you know, and the the altar of
[1:33:01] incense. Then after that veil, you enter
[1:33:03] into the holies of holies.
[1:33:06] That's where the ark of the covenant
[1:33:07] was.
[1:33:11] But now in the old testament, Moses was
[1:33:13] the one has to wash the high priest and
[1:33:16] his son. Aaron is his son and also wash
[1:33:19] the sacrifice at the lav.
[1:33:22] It was a basin, right? The bassin. So if
[1:33:25] you have the I wish I had the picture
[1:33:26] there.
[1:33:29] But let's see this. Matthew chapter 3
[1:33:33] verse 13.
[1:33:35] Now we change the high priest. Now we
[1:33:37] have a high priest.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That could enter once for all.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; There's only one that can could enter
[1:33:45] once for all. Now watch this. When Jesus
[1:33:49] then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[1:33:52] unto John, the word had to come to the
[1:33:56] prophet.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It says Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[1:34:05] unto John
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; to be baptized what?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Of him. But John for forbade him,
[1:34:12] saying, I I have need to be baptized of
[1:34:15] thee. cometh thou to me? Jesus answered
[1:34:19] and said unto them,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; suffer it to be so. Now,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; for thus it becometh us to fulfill what?
[1:34:30] All righteousness.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; If it was the opposite, it will break
[1:34:34] the scripture.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; The high priest that was coming had to
[1:34:38] be washed by a prophet.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when we're reading the
[1:34:44] Old Testament, it's not just oh wa
[1:34:46] things are happening then
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; they are the shadow of good things to
[1:34:50] come.
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; The high priest had to be watched.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I can't give you many examples.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; You know when Kafa stood before Jesus
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; they asked him are you are you the
[1:35:07] Christ? He says you said it right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Kafa took and rent his clothes. You see
[1:35:12] that remember that
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; in the old testament that disqualify a
[1:35:16] high priest.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; If he rents his clothes is disqualified.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; So Cphus at the time he was the high
[1:35:24] priest. So he broke the law but actually
[1:35:28] renting his clothes then that disqualify
[1:35:30] him as a high priest
[1:35:32] because the real high priest was
[1:35:34] standing there.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; You see that
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; that disqualify him completely. Because
[1:35:41] the real high priest had to stand into
[1:35:44] his ministry.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Saint, you have a high priest that can
[1:35:49] be touched by the feeling of your
[1:35:50] infirmity.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're feeling.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; He stands for the ignorant.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You have your Bible. Let's read. Let's
[1:35:58] read uh
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; in the book of Hebrews chapter 5.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 5. Do you love the Lord?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] Hebrews Hebrews chapter I don't think I
[1:36:12] have it on my my in my notes the
[1:36:14] PowerPoint.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 5.
[1:36:23] Do you love the Lord?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He's here this morning. Do you do you
[1:36:26] feel his presence?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] It says for every high priest
[1:36:32] take Oh, good. That's good. For every
[1:36:35] high priest taketh from among men
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; is ordained for a man in thing
[1:36:40] pertaining to God
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; that he may offer both gifts and
[1:36:45] sacrifice for what? For sins.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:36:50] Who can have what?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Compassion
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; on the ignorant and on them that what
[1:36:57] are out of the way that they may he
[1:37:00] himself also compass what? with with
[1:37:04] infinity. That's why Jesus had to become
[1:37:07] men.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; He was a little lower than angel
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; to feel what you are feeling.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; He could not qualify if he does not feel
[1:37:16] what you are feeling.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; He felt temptation.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; He felt the desire to get married.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But he sanctify himself not to do it.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; He had a choice to make.
[1:37:30] He could have got married got married if
[1:37:32] he wanted to.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Let me continue. I want you to catch
[1:37:37] this. Who have compassion on the
[1:37:39] ignorant? I'm I'm going to get back here
[1:37:42] because our high priest has to qualify.
[1:37:43] Is that right?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? How many of us want our
[1:37:46] high priest to qualify?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; He has to qualify.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Uh verse three.
[1:37:59] And by reason thereof he out as for the
[1:38:03] people, so also for himself to offer for
[1:38:06] sin. And no man taketh his honor unto
[1:38:10] himself, but he that is called of God as
[1:38:14] was Aaron.
[1:38:16] So also Christ glorify not himself to be
[1:38:21] made an high priest, but he that said
[1:38:26] unto him,
[1:38:28] thou are my son to ever begotten thee,
[1:38:32] as he said also in another place, thou
[1:38:36] art a priest forever after the order of
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; There were two orders. ironic order or
[1:38:46] maybe the Leviticus order
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; and this order here is the mechic order.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at Jesus. Matthew chapter
[1:38:55] 14:14
[1:39:02] Matthew chapter 14:14
[1:39:08] Matthew 14:14
[1:39:10] If they can post it real quick so that
[1:39:12] we can go not to waste our time. Matthew
[1:39:15] 14:14 the Bible says, "And Jesus went
[1:39:18] forth and saw a great multitude, and he
[1:39:22] was moved with what?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Compassion toward what? Them. That he
[1:39:26] heal what? The sick."
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Luke 71.
[1:39:32] Luke 7:11.
[1:39:37] Luke 7:11
[1:39:47] after and it was to pass the day after
[1:39:52] that he went into the city called nay
[1:39:54] and many of the disciple went with him
[1:39:56] and much people. Now when he came high
[1:39:59] to the gate of the city, behold, there
[1:40:01] was a dead man carried out, and the only
[1:40:04] son of his mother, and she was a widow,
[1:40:07] and much people of the city was with
[1:40:08] him. And when the Lord saw him, he had
[1:40:12] compassion on her, and said unto her,
[1:40:16] weep not.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Our high priest
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; have also compassion
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; for the ignorant. Amen.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; When you did not know any better,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus was looking down and say, "I want
[1:40:28] to save that one. I want to send him a
[1:40:31] message."
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:40:35] prophet
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; before the judgment day."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You see, God's provided way.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But there is something else I want to
[1:40:44] show you here.
[1:40:46] Leviticus chapter 16 14. How many of us
[1:40:49] love the Lord?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] Are you happy to be here?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; It's always good to be in the presence
[1:40:57] of God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Leviticus 16 verse14. I'm entering into
[1:41:04] the blood now because we spoken about
[1:41:06] the high priest. Is that right?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; We to enter now with wash us with his
[1:41:11] own blood.
[1:41:13] He has to wash us with his own blood.
[1:41:15] Not the blood of goats anymore, but with
[1:41:19] his own blood.
[1:41:22] because he enter with his own blood to
[1:41:26] present to the father. He says this is
[1:41:27] the blood that I shed for these people.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Le Vicus 16:14
[1:41:36] and
[1:41:37] he was
[1:41:39] he shall take of the blood of the bulock
[1:41:43] and sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[1:41:48] mercy seat his word.
[1:41:51] And before the mercy seat shall he
[1:41:54] sprinkle of the blood with his finger.
[1:41:56] How many times?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; How many times?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; This is a purpose. You know God, the
[1:42:02] Bible is not just written any type of
[1:42:04] way.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Let's look what the prophet says. Now,
[1:42:08] Revelation chapter 4, we have a prophet
[1:42:10] in the land.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You see the only the prophet knows can
[1:42:16] interpret the Bible.
[1:42:20] with divine vindication. It's not just
[1:42:23] saints. This is the blessing that we
[1:42:25] have received
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; a prophet in the land.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4, that's that that's
[1:42:33] not a scripture. That's a quote.
[1:42:35] Paragraph 101. Not this. Let's go over
[1:42:39] Leviticus chapter 16
[1:42:44] and read in the back way back in the
[1:42:47] back of the Bible now in the Leviticus
[1:42:50] word uh law. See off in Leviticus 16th
[1:42:54] chapter and with the 14. And so it goes
[1:42:56] down. And he shall take the blood of the
[1:42:58] bulock and sprinkle it with his finger
[1:43:02] upon the mercy seat. Upon the mercy
[1:43:05] seat. Because the mercy seat is on top
[1:43:08] of the ark
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; and where there are two cherub facing
[1:43:12] each other. So the mercy seat is the
[1:43:13] area right centered
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; upon the mercies watch we are going to
[1:43:21] get into this after eastward
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; don't forget don't forget the word
[1:43:27] eastward
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; where Jesus come from the east it says
[1:43:32] in the cloud of glory where does the sun
[1:43:35] rise east where will the sunrise east
[1:43:39] where was the mercy seat seeding toward
[1:43:43] the east.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Why have I I I got you all sitting this
[1:43:47] way toward the east. Do you see that?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; It says why the altar is to the east.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Well, we will see if after a while how
[1:43:57] beautifully I'm going to draw it out. I
[1:44:00] ask as many as could I bring paper so
[1:44:03] forth to get this map in few minutes.
[1:44:05] Let sprinkle eastward before the mercy
[1:44:09] seat. Shah sprinkle the blood with his
[1:44:12] finger seven times. Are you with me?
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:44:19] Oh, isn't that beautiful? Seven time
[1:44:23] toward east. The seven church ages.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It says the seven
[1:44:33] church ages shall be covered by the
[1:44:37] blood.
[1:44:39] Which which blood of bulls and goat? No,
[1:44:41] with his own blood.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ upon the mercy
[1:44:47] seat.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; It says Jesus Christ blood just as
[1:44:54] sufficient it is yesterday, today, and
[1:44:58] forever
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and to every age to save every sinner,
[1:45:01] heal every sick person.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Bring every miracle, every sign to pass.
[1:45:06] seven time way back yonder in the old
[1:45:10] testament.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; So the seven age the seven church ages
[1:45:16] every seven church ages is covered by
[1:45:18] the blood.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; But it says with his finger the Bible
[1:45:22] says with his finger he cast out demons.
[1:45:25] Right?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; But in another verse it says by his
[1:45:28] spirit he cast out the demon. You can't
[1:45:30] read in the Bible because the finger of
[1:45:33] God is a spirit.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] You can study that the finger of God is
[1:45:39] his spirit.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; But his spirit
[1:45:45] with his finger is sprinkling it seven
[1:45:48] time upon the mercy seat.
[1:45:51] The seven church ages.
[1:45:54] If you are part of that seven church
[1:45:55] ages, you are covered by the blood. And
[1:45:57] what is the blood is the message for
[1:45:59] every single church age.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. You want to know the blood
[1:46:03] of Jesus Christ is this message of the
[1:46:05] hour
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; is the reveal word for this day
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying the baptism, I'm not
[1:46:14] talking about the old one of the
[1:46:15] Lutheran. I'm talking about with the
[1:46:17] reveal word,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; the message of the hour for this day.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; People say, "I've received the Holy
[1:46:23] Ghost." But where
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; you must believe one of the great
[1:46:28] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost in this day is to receive the
[1:46:31] message of your hour. Oh yes,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; that's the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:36] not speaking in tongue
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; because you cannot you can't speak in
[1:46:39] tongue and re reject this truth and you
[1:46:42] still you go to hell.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's true.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:46:48] message of the hour that you have
[1:46:50] received.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Let me get real quick here. The talking
[1:46:59] I'm going to go fast and I'll close. How
[1:47:01] many of us love the Lord?
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Without the blood, there's no
[1:47:09] forgiveness of sin. Exodus chapter 12,
[1:47:13] the blood was the token. Do you see
[1:47:15] that? No, you can you can leave the
[1:47:17] court there. That's fine.
[1:47:19] Do you see that? The blood was the
[1:47:22] token.
[1:47:23] When I see the blood, I will pass over.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; The death angel was coming to strike the
[1:47:28] land. The only requirement was what? The
[1:47:30] blood that was the message of Moses.
[1:47:35] It does not apply today. You can't put
[1:47:37] the blood of a goat in your door.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:41] you go to hell.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You are lost.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; So the blood of Jesus Christ has to be
[1:47:48] applied in here
[1:47:52] in your soul, in your heart.
[1:47:56] And to atone means to stand between
[1:48:01] the token. Now, Israel's slain lamb was
[1:48:05] the requirement of Jehovah and the blood
[1:48:07] was the token
[1:48:10] that the job had been done. Can you
[1:48:11] follow with me so we can read it
[1:48:12] together?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; It says God requirement for redemption
[1:48:17] for Egypt to go to the promised land.
[1:48:19] The requirement he required a slain lamb
[1:48:22] animal and the animal must be the blood
[1:48:25] of the dead animal must be put upon the
[1:48:29] lentil and on the door and stood before
[1:48:33] stood for the token that the things that
[1:48:36] Jehovah had required had been fulfilled.
[1:48:38] You see that now the lamb was the token.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Not sorry not the lamb was the token the
[1:48:45] blood was the token.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:49] The blood was the token and the life had
[1:48:52] gone out from the sacrifice
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; and now the blood was the token.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; His order had been carried out. The
[1:49:02] blood stood for the token.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; The sign that this believers had done
[1:49:08] exactly what the requirement was.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; We saw the same way with Rahab.
[1:49:18] She asked.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Let me read it real quick. Joshua
[1:49:22] chapter 2 verse2. Now therefore I pray
[1:49:25] you swear unto me. But the Lord since I
[1:49:28] have shown you kindness
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; ye also show kindness unto my father's
[1:49:33] house and give me what? A true token.
[1:49:39] and that will save Eli my father and my
[1:49:42] mother and my brethren assisted all that
[1:49:45] they have to and deliver our life from
[1:49:47] death. And the man answered, "Now look
[1:49:51] here. Watch carefully here. It says our
[1:49:54] life
[1:49:56] for your life, yours.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; If ye ought to now this our business."
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see Jesus in all of that?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; In all this same
[1:50:09] And it shall be when the Lord has given
[1:50:12] us the land that ye will deal kindly and
[1:50:15] truly with with with thee. Rare the
[1:50:18] ollet she was redeemed. But the red sc
[1:50:21] the red uh the the scarlet thread. Red
[1:50:24] is danger. Red is a sign of redemption.
[1:50:28] She had displayed it on the city wall.
[1:50:32] the scarlet thread between judgment, the
[1:50:36] destruction of the city and her family.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; So when they see the scarlet thread, it
[1:50:42] was a sign that the that house had to be
[1:50:44] quite protected.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; In Egypt, the blood was sitting there as
[1:50:49] a token that when I see the blood, the
[1:50:52] angel, the edge of the Lord will not
[1:50:54] destroy. You see that?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Let's get into business now. Verse 20.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this. The way
[1:51:02] brother Brandham explains it,
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; the token,
[1:51:07] paragraph 20, it says the blood was a
[1:51:11] token of identification,
[1:51:14] the blood itself, the animal bled, died,
[1:51:17] his blood was on the wall. Now animal
[1:51:20] life that was in the blood, the life is
[1:51:24] in the blood.
[1:51:27] So therefore when the animal was killed
[1:51:30] and the life was broken from the animal
[1:51:32] the blood had to be the chemistry of the
[1:51:35] blood
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; to stand for the token. Do you see that?
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Yes. To stand for the token
[1:51:44] because the life that was in the blood
[1:51:47] could not come back upon the believer
[1:51:50] because it was an animal life.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Right? So the life that was in the
[1:51:56] animal cannot come back into a human
[1:51:58] because animal does not have a soul.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; It continues first paragraph 21. It says
[1:52:09] an animal life and a human life is
[1:52:12] absolutely different.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; There is not nothing in in it at all.
[1:52:17] You look take an animal blood and put it
[1:52:19] in you, you will die. You see, it's a
[1:52:22] different life in the animal blood than
[1:52:24] there is in human blood because the
[1:52:27] human has a soul and the animal has no
[1:52:29] soul.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Verse 22, a paragraph of 22 rather. And
[1:52:32] now therefore, the blood itself,
[1:52:35] understand now the red chemistry,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; chemicals of the blood had to stand out
[1:52:42] on the door as a token that the lamb had
[1:52:46] died. Now because the life of the lamb
[1:52:49] could not come back on the human
[1:52:50] worshipper but today
[1:52:53] it was only a type.
[1:52:57] It was what only a type
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; but today paragraph 22 uh 23
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; it says today it isn't the chemical
[1:53:09] blood
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; our Lord Jesus our lamb but it's the
[1:53:16] life that was in the blood
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; which is what the Holy Ghost
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; it comes back
[1:53:26] and is the token that we have accepted
[1:53:29] and did exactly what God told us to do.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And then by having the token, we are
[1:53:36] identified
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; with our sacrifice.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; It says only way anyone anyway only way
[1:53:46] anyone could tell that the house belongs
[1:53:49] to under the blood because the chemistry
[1:53:52] of the blood was what? on the door.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; The pastor, the death angel had to look
[1:53:58] and see the blood. Now again, it was the
[1:54:02] type of what? The Holy Spirit.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Now see, the literal blood of Jesus
[1:54:09] Christ could not come upon each one of
[1:54:13] us
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; because he just had so much blood in his
[1:54:17] body.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; It drip off and out of his body into the
[1:54:21] ground 2,000 years ago.
[1:54:24] But he wasn't to be the talking.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; The life.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; The life that was in the blood was the
[1:54:42] Oh my goodness. was the token now.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Not the chemistry of the blood that fell
[1:54:47] 2,000 years ago.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; But the life that was in the blood,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the one that is the token.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; And what is the life? The Holy Spirit.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the token.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Life.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; It says, "I'll prove to you it's the
[1:55:06] token that is to come upon each of us
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; to show that we have been identified
[1:55:14] with our sacrifice and have carried over
[1:55:17] what request."
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] But Jesus when he was on earth when the
[1:55:24] body when the corpal body was on earth
[1:55:27] it says nevertheless I will tell you the
[1:55:30] truth that's John chapter 16:7 it is
[1:55:33] expedient for you that I go away
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; it says for if I go not away the
[1:55:43] comforter will not come upon you
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; but if I depart I will send him unto
[1:55:51] you.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; So for the Holy Spirit to be released
[1:55:54] into the church, he had to go.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to go. The corporal body had
[1:56:02] to die
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; to be buried, resurrected, ascended into
[1:56:07] heaven.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; And he is sitting as the high priest.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; And that spirit that was in that blood
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; came back the day of Pentecost. Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; It says wait until you ended with power.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; The life that was in the blood came back
[1:56:24] into the church.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; The very life of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Not divided, separate himself into 120.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That's why people of the city could look
[1:56:36] at him and says, "Oh, they look like
[1:56:38] Jesus."
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; That's why in Antioch, they called them
[1:56:41] Christians.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Because they were acting like Christ.
[1:56:47] So when you see a Christian, you don't
[1:56:49] see something different.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; You see Christ.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Then Peter stood up the day of
[1:56:57] Pentecost.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Repent and be baptized
[1:57:01] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:57:03] Christ for the remission of your sin. Ye
[1:57:05] shall receive what? The gift of the Holy
[1:57:08] Ghost."
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; What is the life of the blood? The
[1:57:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he says
[1:57:14] that promise of the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:15] Ghost is unto you.
[1:57:19] That life that was in the blood. Oh,
[1:57:21] glory to God. Somebody's catching this.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; That life that was in the blood is unto
[1:57:26] you.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Right? And unto what? Your children.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Not just upon yourself. Your children
[1:57:34] also.
[1:57:35] It says the promise unto you and to your
[1:57:37] children as to all that what are a far
[1:57:41] off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:57:46] shall call.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; So the promise of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:57:50] just for you. So if you have received
[1:57:52] it, you go to seek for somebody else or
[1:57:54] you will have to give your children to
[1:57:56] get it
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; because that promise is not for you
[1:57:59] alone. It's for all your children.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; They are particular of that same
[1:58:03] blessing.
[1:58:05] Do you see that?
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And you know, I was I was just reading
[1:58:09] and I thought about this. You know, when
[1:58:11] Peter was in in in prison, the spirit of
[1:58:14] Christ, the life that was in the blood
[1:58:17] now is in the 120. When when Peter got
[1:58:22] arrested, he was in prison. What did the
[1:58:23] saints do?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; They pray for him.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; They start and they're setting for
[1:58:29] Peter. Amen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And few minutes they saw somebody
[1:58:33] knocking at the door.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; One of the girls thought it was Peter
[1:58:36] the
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; he says, "Oh, that's Peter angel."
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; He thought it was Peter's theophony
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; that was at the door. But that was
[1:58:45] Peter.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; That's why interceding. See the
[1:58:48] importance of interceding for a brother.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in you would do it.
[1:58:54] If Jesus could intercede, you have to
[1:58:57] intercede
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; because you have the very life of Jesus
[1:59:00] Christ.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; My I'm coming to a close here. How many
[1:59:07] of us love the Lord?
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in you will intercede. I
[1:59:13] want to read a scripture here. Romans
[1:59:15] chapter 8.
[1:59:20] Likewise, the spirit also helps our
[1:59:22] infirmity.
[1:59:24] For we know not what we should pray. For
[1:59:27] as we ought, but the spirit itself
[1:59:32] maketh intercession
[1:59:35] for us in groaning which cannot what?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Be altered.
[1:59:40] Do you see that? The Holy Spirit in you
[1:59:45] will intercede.
[1:59:49] Are you catching this? Abraham
[1:59:52] interced for a lot because it was the
[1:59:55] spirit of Christ in Abraham to do it.
[1:59:59] The spirit of God in you would also do
[2:00:02] intercession
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; not just for you alone for those that
[2:00:06] you have loved to.
[2:00:08] Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; One day, brother Brener was having a
[2:00:12] discernment service in Monzian, Illinois
[2:00:16] and Billy Paul came, you know, he was at
[2:00:19] the hotel and Billy Paul came and knock
[2:00:22] at the door. Says, "Dad, you know, it
[2:00:24] was time for the service, but the Benham
[2:00:26] was there just crying. He didn't know
[2:00:27] what was going on. He was just crying
[2:00:29] and and he told Billipy Paul came and
[2:00:31] and opened the door a little bit. They
[2:00:33] said Billy Paul just tell the Baxter,
[2:00:35] you know, just tell by brother the
[2:00:36] backer to go ahead with the meeting.
[2:00:38] Maybe I'll come tomorrow night. Brother
[2:00:40] Benham was just crying and crying and
[2:00:42] crying. And few minutes later, as Billy
[2:00:45] Paul was getting ready to leave, brother
[2:00:48] Benham could hear somebody's voice
[2:00:49] speaking.
[2:00:51] He heard somebody sounded like German.
[2:00:54] He went outside. He said, "Who is
[2:00:56] speaking in this language?"
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know
[2:01:00] that it was the spirit speaking through
[2:01:01] his lips. Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And by the time I'm came, he says, "Oh,
[2:01:06] what is all going? What's what's going
[2:01:08] on?" He was just speaking and few
[2:01:10] minutes later, he got up really quick.
[2:01:12] He rushed outside. As Bilipo was getting
[2:01:14] ready to leave, he says, "Belip, wait,
[2:01:16] wait, wait, wait." He went into the room
[2:01:17] and washed his face.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; And went to the meeting.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; When he went to the meeting,
[2:01:24] there was a woman that was on the way
[2:01:26] from Minneapolis here
[2:01:30] was losing blood. The doctor said
[2:01:32] anytime that she has she loses blood
[2:01:34] again, she's going to die.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And on the way they were coming for the
[2:01:37] meeting, they couldn't bring her to the
[2:01:39] meeting and she start bleeding. You know
[2:01:41] what brother says?
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit when you receive
[2:01:46] the testimony of the healing of the
[2:01:49] sisters.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; It says what time was
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; this?
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; And when you look at the time, it was
[2:01:57] the time that the Holy Spirit was
[2:01:59] interceding. Brother says the Holy
[2:02:01] Spirit was interceding for that woman.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Saint this is not just for brother Bham
[2:02:08] alone.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; It's for you too.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; You come with a b every time that you
[2:02:13] feel a burden to pray
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; saint. Let me say this. If you ever feel
[2:02:18] the desire to pray, Satan will never ask
[2:02:20] you to pray.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:02:28] If you feel the desire, ever you feel
[2:02:30] just something is telling you, get on
[2:02:33] your knees and pray.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Don't never disobey that voice.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe your son is somewhere else in
[2:02:39] danger.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Your prayer, the Holy Spirit would
[2:02:44] intercede for your son
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; at the moment when you don't even know.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; So s every time you hear a burden in
[2:02:52] your heart to pray, Satan will never
[2:02:54] tell you go pray.
[2:02:56] Because if Satan stand against his own
[2:02:58] kingdom, his kingdom will be completely
[2:03:00] destroyed.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Means God want you to do something.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; You see how we have to be available.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; The re the Holy Ghost that we have
[2:03:09] received is not for us to put on the
[2:03:10] shelf.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Is to lead us to be conscious of his
[2:03:14] presence.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; But there's another story also.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; How many of us love story? I think
[2:03:23] brother D can do a better job than I,
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; you know. But the bellum one day he was
[2:03:28] having a service
[2:03:30] in another city. He saw he was he was a
[2:03:34] little hungry and and he went outside to
[2:03:38] to get something to eat. And as he
[2:03:40] entered into a little place, a little
[2:03:42] diner, whatever you would call it, he
[2:03:45] got in and and as soon as he entered, he
[2:03:47] saw a old lady really immorally dressed
[2:03:52] on this side. The policeman had his hand
[2:03:54] around a girl and all of that. He looks
[2:03:57] down. He says, "Man, what in the world
[2:03:59] God want?" In his own heart, he says,
[2:04:02] "God, why don't you just destroy all
[2:04:04] these people? What in the world is this?
[2:04:06] This is sinful.
[2:04:09] How can you allow these things to happen
[2:04:11] right here?
[2:04:14] And God called him on the side.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Then he saw a vision.
[2:04:19] He saw the world turning around and all
[2:04:21] of this thing. And few minutes later, he
[2:04:23] saw himself as a young man
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; sinning.
[2:04:27] He says, "Oh, that's how my sin has done
[2:04:30] to you."
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; This is what what I've done wrong that
[2:04:35] is hurting you like that. Brother Benham
[2:04:37] says I could see Jesus Christ. His blood
[2:04:41] was there before before judgment and he
[2:04:44] was playing as a bumper.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And the Holy God told him he says you
[2:04:49] want that that woman to be to die.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; What about your own sin here?
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And he took the book
[2:04:56] and wherever he had done wrong, he was
[2:04:58] crossed and say pardon.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; It was crossed pardon. Hallelujah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; It says if I have pardoned you,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; don't you want to pardon also somebody
[2:05:08] else?
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Sometime we so hard on people that have
[2:05:13] wronged us, done something wrong.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; But how many mistakes and sin we have
[2:05:17] committed.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not even to the measure of
[2:05:20] what your brother and sister have done.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Saints, tonight we have this afternoon,
[2:05:26] we need to come with a heart of
[2:05:27] repentance.
[2:05:31] I'm going to conclude this. The ministry
[2:05:33] of intercession
[2:05:35] is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:05:38] for the ignorance, the weak, the lost
[2:05:40] soul. The bride of Jesus Christ has
[2:05:43] received the same ministry as the
[2:05:46] bridegroom.
[2:05:47] If Christ has done it, you have to do
[2:05:50] it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; By the same spirit that is in you.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Exposition of the church ages. I'm going
[2:05:56] to read this and close.
[2:05:59] He had made us. Brother Benam is reading
[2:06:01] from the scripture we just read.
[2:06:04] It says he had made us. Oh, there a
[2:06:08] certain truth we need to emphasize. This
[2:06:11] is now of them. This is one of them. He
[2:06:14] has made us. Salvation is is doing.
[2:06:17] Remember Israel wanted to do something
[2:06:19] by his their own. Do you see that? We we
[2:06:21] spoke about it, right?
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go back to the scripture. I'll
[2:06:26] read the scripture first, please.
[2:06:29] Be ye are a chosen generation.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Are you catching now as we rotating
[2:06:35] everything, right?
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; You see, you see clear a little bit.
[2:06:38] Yes,
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; ye are a chosen generation,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; a royal priesthood,
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; a holy nation,
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; a peculiar people
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; that should show forth the praises of
[2:06:51] him who have called you out of darkness
[2:06:56] into his marvelous light.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; What light? The message of the hour.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Now, let me read this part.
[2:07:08] And from Jesus Christ, who is the
[2:07:11] faithful witness, the first begotten of
[2:07:15] the dead, and the princes of the kings
[2:07:17] of the earth,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; unto him that what?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Loved us.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; You see why you are elect and chosen to
[2:07:25] be here?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Because he loved you.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; And wash us from what? Our sin in his
[2:07:35] what? own blood. Not the blood of bulls
[2:07:38] and goats.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; With his own blood that is washing you.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; What is his blood? The Holy Ghost.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, the message of the hour,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; the revealed word for your day.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Because the truth set you free and the
[2:07:55] word is truth.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has made us king and priest
[2:08:04] unto God and his father. Let me read
[2:08:07] this quote. He has made us.
[2:08:10] There are certain truth we need to
[2:08:12] emphasize this one. This is one of them.
[2:08:15] He has made us. Salvation is his doing.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; He brought for he brought us from a for
[2:08:22] a uh he brought us for a purpose.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; We are kings, spiritual kings. We are
[2:08:28] going to be kings upon the earth with
[2:08:31] him when he sit on his throne. But now
[2:08:36] we are spiritual kings and we reign over
[2:08:40] a spiritual what? Kingdom.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; It says Roman 5:17.
[2:08:45] For if by one man of first death reign
[2:08:49] by one,
[2:08:50] much more they have received abundance
[2:08:53] of grace, and of the gift of
[2:08:54] righteousness shall reign in life by
[2:08:57] one, Jesus Christ.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; And in Colossians 1:13,
[2:09:01] who has delivered us from the power of
[2:09:04] darkness has translated us into the
[2:09:08] kingdom, brother says what? reign of his
[2:09:12] dear son right now.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Right now.

[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; the world, the flesh, and the devil.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Showing forth his praise and glory.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; For it is Christ.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. It is Christ in us.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Willing and doing his what? Good
[2:09:44] pleasure.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yes indeed. Even now we are seated in
[2:09:50] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; You know when he says sitting in
[2:10:01] heavenly places, brother Brandham says
[2:10:04] heaven consists of the word.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. that everywhere that the word is
[2:10:09] preached, we are sitting in heavenly
[2:10:11] places.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Heaven is where the word is.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; When the word is there, heaven is there.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; It continues.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; It says, "And made us
[2:10:34] the same quote." It should be the same
[2:10:37] code. The same uh uh
[2:10:40] All right.
[2:10:43] What's the next one?
[2:10:46] Oh, never mind. I'll continue. No, you
[2:10:49] can't you can't hide this. It says this
[2:10:51] was the more important. I mean, not all
[2:10:53] of them are important, but this is the
[2:10:54] point.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; And made us priests. Yes. Priest unto
[2:10:59] him.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Do you remember Christ interceding
[2:11:02] spirit in what? In this end time, right?
[2:11:05] It says for for he had made us yes
[2:11:09] priest unto him
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; offering spiritual praises praise of
[2:11:16] sanctified lips.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Offering the spiritual praises of
[2:11:26] sanctified lips.
[2:11:28] spending our life, spending our life a
[2:11:32] sweet offering
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; unto him.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says this, worshiing him.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Worshiing him in spirit and in truth.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; It says interceding.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Are you you see why he's making us
[2:11:53] priests? It says interceding
[2:11:57] and petitioning.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; You are worshiping in spirit and in
[2:12:03] truth.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You are interceding and you are
[2:12:06] petitioning
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; for somebody else.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; You are interceding for somebody else.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; It says king and priest unto our God. No
[2:12:16] wonder the world goes not appealed to
[2:12:18] us. We are a peculiar people. Sellious
[2:12:23] unto good works.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this last quote.
[2:12:34] The Messiah. And I think Sister Naomi
[2:12:36] would appreciate this.
[2:12:39] You know, I was studying and I I saw I
[2:12:42] saw this quote that was after I had a
[2:12:45] conversation with Sister Naomi. I think
[2:12:46] Sister Naomi, you'll catch this. It
[2:12:49] says, "Now, this is true. God called
[2:12:52] Messiah.
[2:12:53] It says God called us. We become king
[2:12:57] and priest unto God.
[2:13:00] Like Jesus was God's high priest.
[2:13:04] He says we become what? Lesser priest.
[2:13:09] Jesus was God in fullness. Dwell in him
[2:13:13] to send forth the expression of God to
[2:13:16] the world. For God was in Christ
[2:13:20] reconciling the worldwide to himself.
[2:13:23] And as God was in Christ, reconciling
[2:13:27] the world to himself, God comes into his
[2:13:30] church.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; And I anoint him
[2:13:36] some messiahs.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; This is very strong.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; You catch that?
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:46] The same thing he did in his church.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; The same power he did he had is in his
[2:13:55] church.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; And his church become what? His
[2:13:59] dominion.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; He is king over his dominion. Dominion.
[2:14:07] And we are king and priest offering
[2:14:10] spiritual sacrifices to God.
[2:14:14] the fruit of our lips giving praise to
[2:14:17] his name. Hallelujah. Oh my. There you
[2:14:20] are. Messiah. Messiah. Leo Messiah.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Leo. Anointed one.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Anointed off of what? The main one.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Anointed off of the great one.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[2:14:42] You are a priest.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; To offer sacrifice.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; To intercede for your lost one.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; How many of us want to intercede for
[2:14:56] somebody tonight?
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; God has given you the Holy Spirit to
[2:15:02] intercede.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; This is the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Jesus Christ in you,
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; But saints, we have a job to do.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; There's a job to do. We have a lot to
[2:15:18] do.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "Confess your
[2:15:22] fault one to another.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Pray one for another that ye may be
[2:15:26] healed."
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? You can't pray for a
[2:15:30] brother who be healed.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; When you say healing is not just
[2:15:33] healing. Healing comes out of the word
[2:15:35] soozo means you know to to to includes
[2:15:38] the soul.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; The healing is not just because you're
[2:15:42] sick in the body.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; What about the healing of the soul too?
[2:15:45] What about the healing of the spirit?
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; It says the effectual Oh, glory.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Fervent prayer of a righteous man
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; veth.
[2:16:00] And brother Benham says, "A righteous
[2:16:02] man is not a sinless man."
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; A righteous man is the one that is
[2:16:06] willing to acknowledge his wrong.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; You see where repentance is coming from.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; You're willing to acknowledge your
[2:16:15] wrong.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Because God sees your heart.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; He knows that you didn't mean to do it.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to come back to the
[2:16:22] alt and say, "God, I repent of all my
[2:16:24] sin.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; I'm guilty." When God sees a Oh, glory.
[2:16:29] a repented sinner.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "This is a righteous man."
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; It's not the way you see it.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; It's the way God sees it.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; He sees a righteous man. He sees a
[2:16:41] righteous woman. Why? By his grace and
[2:16:44] with the blood of Jesus Christ that
[2:16:46] cleans us from all sin. Shall we stand?
[2:16:48] May God bless you.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; The ministry of intercession.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:58] Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was in Christ.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Now he has anointed you to carry the
[2:17:05] same job.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; How many of us love the Lord?
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Is there somebody here that feels like
[2:17:18] they are wrong? They say, "Lord,
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; I need your help." Yes, Lord.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Adam
[2:17:28] in the Garden of Eden vividly made a
[2:17:31] decision to stand for his wife.
[2:17:37] If you read read the message when
[2:17:39] brother speak about Zakius, it says it
[2:17:42] was because of his wife.
[2:17:45] His wife Rebecca was interceding for
[2:17:47] Zakius.
[2:17:50] What about Wright?
[2:17:53] She interceded.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; For her children.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; What about the woman in Memphis?
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; It was the little boy that had seen had
[2:18:03] done wrong about to die, but she could
[2:18:06] look in the word. It says, "Where is my
[2:18:09] Elijah?"
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; The heart of an interceeding mother.
[2:18:15] Saint, I don't care how far your
[2:18:17] children are. Yes.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; As I said on Wednesday, I'm standing
[2:18:22] here because somebody 20 years ago
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; was praying for me.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; There was a mother somewhere. There was
[2:18:31] a father somewhere.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; That were crying all night.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, help this young man that he can
[2:18:38] serve you.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; And here am I.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Because of somebody standing in a gap
[2:18:45] for me. Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Wherever your children are,
[2:18:52] stay a little longer. Pray for them.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; God will bring them back.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; I myself was far away from God
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; because of a prayer of a mother and a
[2:19:07] father.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I am here.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; So if God did it for me,
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:15] He can do it for you.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody having a husband far away or a
[2:19:21] wife,
[2:19:24] you can identify yourself with Rebecca
[2:19:26] as a as a husband as a wife rather. You
[2:19:30] can look back at the seed for your
[2:19:32] husband as Zak as Rebecca did for
[2:19:34] Zakius.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus is here this afternoon.
[2:19:40] Amen.
[2:19:41] Because we just said we're sitting in
[2:19:43] heavenly places. The word of God is
[2:19:45] here. Jesus Christ is here.
[2:19:50] If you have somebody next to you, just
[2:19:53] lay your hand on him on her.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Saint, I don't want you to pray for
[2:19:59] yourself.
[2:20:01] Don't pray for you.
[2:20:04] If the Holy Spirit is in you,
[2:20:09] whatever you're going to pray and to sit
[2:20:11] for that brother or that sister that is
[2:20:12] next to you,
[2:20:15] God is able to honor your prayer.
[2:20:18] Even the young ones, maybe you may not
[2:20:20] understand what all of this thing means.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; But your little prayer that you just if
[2:20:27] you're a young one, you sitting by
[2:20:28] somebody that's older than you, just
[2:20:31] pray for them.
[2:20:34] We're serving a living God church. This
[2:20:37] is the time where we need to to mean it
[2:20:40] from our hearts
[2:20:42] that if somebody is sick, God can heal
[2:20:45] them instantly this afternoon
[2:20:49] because God cannot say one thing and do
[2:20:52] the other.
[2:20:54] But you must believe it.
[2:20:57] Saint I can't preach. Anybody can come
[2:20:59] and preach it. Until you believe it,
[2:21:03] nothing will happen. That's why I
[2:21:06] challenge you to believe.
[2:21:10] Shall we bow our heads?
[2:21:13] Heavenly Father,
[2:21:16] the creator of heaven and earth, the
[2:21:18] gift of all the gift.
[2:21:22] Lord, we can feel your presence in this
[2:21:24] building.
[2:21:26] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:21:30] Father, take control now at this moment
[2:21:33] as we give way to your spirit.
[2:21:36] Bring a spirit of conviction, oh God,
[2:21:38] Father,
[2:21:41] that this afternoon,
[2:21:45] that your children will never be the
[2:21:46] same.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have this thing on my heart.
[2:21:52] that somebody may be blessed.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you are the same yesterday to
[2:21:59] them forever.
[2:22:02] You are the lily of the valley, the
[2:22:03] bright and morning star,
[2:22:06] the fairest of 10,000,
[2:22:10] the stone that came out of the mountain
[2:22:11] without the help of any.
[2:22:14] The fourth man in the fire,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; the rock of ages,
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; the Messiah,
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; the mighty angel of Revelation chapter

[2:33:37] God bless you with

[2:33:50] Shall we pray?
[2:33:54] Our Lord and our Savior Jesus,
[2:33:58] we just want to thank you for this
[2:34:00] moment. Father,
[2:34:04] for visiting us this morning, stroke,
[2:34:07] this afternoon,
[2:34:09] and speaking to us from lip to ear.
[2:34:13] When we come, we do not come because we
[2:34:15] want to see a man. We don't come here
[2:34:18] because we want to hear the voice of a
[2:34:20] man.
[2:34:22] We come here because we know the Lord
[2:34:24] our God is here. And we know that you
[2:34:28] still speak. And as you have said in
[2:34:31] your holy word that your word would not
[2:34:33] go out and return unto thee void.
[2:34:36] Father, you say exactly what you mean.
[2:34:39] And you mean exactly what you say. You
[2:34:42] know us, Father, inside out. You know
[2:34:46] our struggles. You know, Father, what we
[2:34:50] are dealing with and you know what we
[2:34:52] have need of. And you have tailored your
[2:34:54] word, Father, to meet exactly that. And
[2:34:58] we want to thank you, Father, for having
[2:35:00] spoken.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; We are so grateful, Father, for visit us
[2:35:05] this afternoon.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And father we give you the glory
[2:35:08] and we bless your holy name with all
[2:35:10] that is within us.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; You have said in your holy word father
[2:35:15] that the ministry of Christ is the
[2:35:17] ministry of intercession.
[2:35:19] Father you stood in the gap father. Dear
[2:35:22] Lord Jesus you stood in the gap for us
[2:35:26] and you shed your precious blood for us
[2:35:29] and have redeemed us onto thee. And we
[2:35:32] also ought to step in the gap for others
[2:35:36] because the Bible says freely have we
[2:35:38] received and freely we should give.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; And we ought to be standing in the gap,
[2:35:42] Father, because very soon the judgment
[2:35:45] of God is going to fall. And Father, you
[2:35:48] are looking upon us and you are
[2:35:50] depending on us, Father, to also stand
[2:35:52] in the gap. Father, we pray give us the
[2:35:55] grace to be able to stand in the gap for
[2:35:58] a brother, for a sister, for our
[2:36:00] children, for our loved ones, for our
[2:36:03] husbands and our wives. Give us grace,
[2:36:05] Father, to be able to stand in the gap
[2:36:08] because if the spirit of Christ is in
[2:36:11] us, we would do what Christ has done.
[2:36:15] And we pray, oh God, help us. Help our
[2:36:18] prayer lives. Help us, Father. We need
[2:36:21] you now more than ever before.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; we are humbly looking to thee, Father,
[2:36:26] seeking your face as time is closing in
[2:36:30] on us. That Father, we may be a blessing
[2:36:34] to our neighbors. Father, to the people
[2:36:37] you have entrusted to us that we may see
[2:36:40] the glory of God in ways, Father, we may
[2:36:43] never have thought of. We want to thank
[2:36:46] you sincerely, Father, for your servant,
[2:36:48] Father.
[2:36:49] We thank you for his labor of love,
[2:36:52] Father, to bring us your word this
[2:36:54] morning. We thank you, Father, for his
[2:36:56] ministry. And we pray for more of you,
[2:36:58] Father, in his life and in his home. And
[2:37:01] even so, Father, we pray keep him, keep
[2:37:04] his wife and children, in the center of
[2:37:06] thine perfect will. Provide for them in
[2:37:09] every aspect of their lives. And may you
[2:37:11] shield them from every attacking
[2:37:13] machinery of the enemy and continue to
[2:37:16] use him, Father, to bless your sons and
[2:37:18] daughters at every given moment.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Father. We are so
[2:37:24] grateful. Bless your sons and daughters.
[2:37:26] Even as many as I've gathered this
[2:37:28] afternoon and our pastor, Father,
[2:37:30] wherever he is, whether he's behind the
[2:37:33] pulpit or not, Father, we pray, oh God,
[2:37:36] that you would glorify yourself in his
[2:37:39] life. bless us all together and father
[2:37:42] that as we part company this afternoon
