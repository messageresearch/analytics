[25:54] would just
[25:57] have a little communion with the father
[26:00] tonight
[26:05] have the little communion with the
[26:08] father
[26:10] from the beginning of this weekend i've
[26:12] been caught up
[26:13] into uh a testimony
[26:17] of uh of a woman
[26:20] back a few years back
[26:24] and she was in a muslim country of
[26:26] pakistan
[26:28] and
[26:32] she was a woman of a very high class
[26:34] life
[26:35] she was from a wealthy family
[26:39] a ruling family but god met her in a
[26:42] very supernatural way
[26:45] and her testimony just
[26:49] been so tremendous tremendous testimony
[26:52] and i mean there's different
[26:56] supernatural things that god
[26:58] did to be able to get her attention
[27:02] but she entitled her testimony i dared
[27:05] to call him
[27:06] father
[27:11] and when i realized what she
[27:14] what she got her the title of that
[27:18] from she started reading the bible
[27:23] and she was reading both the bible and
[27:26] the quran
[27:26] she was comparing them as she was
[27:29] reading
[27:31] and things from the bible one of the
[27:33] first thing
[27:34] that struck her in the bible was when
[27:37] she read the story
[27:39] of the woman caught in that doctrine
[27:43] and she knows what the muslim law will
[27:46] require there she knows what a sharia
[27:49] law
[27:50] will require of a woman caught in a
[27:52] doctrine
[27:54] so she said when that portion of the
[27:56] stricture caught her attention
[27:58] she froze on her bed because in her mind
[28:01] she was
[28:02] preparing to know what it was what was
[28:04] going to happen to the woman
[28:06] but as she continued to read the bible
[28:10] and she came to the place where jesus
[28:13] spoke to her
[28:14] accuser and say he that is without
[28:18] saying take the first stone and she saw
[28:21] how the story
[28:22] ended she said
[28:25] i could not believe my imagination
[28:32] she said this man jesus must be
[28:38] a different kind of a prophet because
[28:41] the quran speak of him being the prophet
[28:47] and right in there there was not a
[28:49] conviction
[28:50] she was just reading because she needed
[28:52] information
[28:55] and then one day she went to
[28:59] a catholic hospital when her little
[29:02] grandson
[29:02] was now well when she went to the
[29:06] hospital
[29:08] she met oh
[29:12] she met a catholic nom dear okay it was
[29:14] catholic hospital
[29:16] so they started talking and the catholic
[29:19] nun was surprised to see her carrying
[29:21] the bible
[29:23] and when he started talking and you know
[29:25] she was sharing
[29:26] with the catholic nuns she's reading the
[29:28] bible and the different things because
[29:31] supernatural things started happening
[29:33] around her but she couldn't put it
[29:34] together she didn't know
[29:35] what it was so she said
[29:41] that lady leaned over to her
[29:45] and said just speak to him
[29:48] like your father
[29:53] she said just speak to him like
[29:56] your father yes
[30:00] and she said she could not imagine it
[30:03] she could not imagine that was what she
[30:06] named the book i dare call him
[30:08] father you know because
[30:11] and i would say
[30:14] the christian religion
[30:18] is the only religion
[30:22] that teach us because the only time
[30:26] where a prayer were taught
[30:29] to approach god as father was when jesus
[30:32] was teaching his disciples
[30:38] praise the lord
[30:41] and she said as she drove back home she
[30:44] was thinking about it
[30:46] call him father her father has passed
[30:51] and she was love of her father just like
[30:54] abigail
[30:57] and she said thoughts started flowing
[30:59] through her mind
[31:01] the good memories she could remember of
[31:03] her father
[31:06] the time they would play together and
[31:08] you know and
[31:09] and the different things as she walked
[31:11] as she drove back home
[31:13] she said she got home she went into her
[31:16] room
[31:19] and she knelt down
[31:23] and she put those precious words on her
[31:26] lips
[31:28] father she said when she said those
[31:32] words there was a
[31:35] warm feeling that came in the room
[31:41] and she could identify that feeling
[31:45] with the many supernatural things that
[31:47] were happening around her life
[31:50] and then she knew that god
[31:53] was dealing with her all of those times
[31:58] but i'm telling you i mean i was just i
[32:01] was just
[32:02] flooded with with the same presence
[32:08] oh i cried behind my wheel when i drive
[32:12] and i mean uh just to see
[32:15] how god makes himself real
[32:20] because he's a real god yes

[1:09:49] and uh they were they were being uh
[1:09:52] looked for by the police but then they
[1:09:54] pick him up now he didn't know
[1:09:56] what was happening got in the vehicle
[1:09:58] and before they could get to the to the
[1:10:00] next time
[1:10:02] the vehicle was stopped they were
[1:10:03] arrested i think one of them ran away or
[1:10:05] so
[1:10:06] and he was arrested with one or two
[1:10:09] whatever the case was but he was
[1:10:11] arrested and then
[1:10:14] he never felt no guilt in him he never
[1:10:16] felt
[1:10:17] you know anything didn't even know what
[1:10:19] was happening before he realized these
[1:10:20] guys
[1:10:21] has either robbed a car or you know and
[1:10:23] stole in a car or something like that
[1:10:26] and then uh what will happen is that
[1:10:30] i mean but dave was so relaxed he told
[1:10:32] his story how he got on the car
[1:10:34] and the police that were there write the
[1:10:36] record and saw well
[1:10:37] you know if you just jump in this car i
[1:10:40] mean there is nothing to be afraid of
[1:10:42] you know so uh as the story will go
[1:10:46] there was a date there they were
[1:10:47] supposed to be uh
[1:10:49] uh persecuted come back to the court but
[1:10:52] because bert babe
[1:10:53] really never saw uh he never saw the
[1:10:57] the weight of the danger so he never
[1:11:00] he never looked for a lawyer
[1:11:06] and and
[1:11:09] maybe hoping that the police that did
[1:11:11] the arrest who have been there
[1:11:13] you know or something like that but it
[1:11:15] turned out that he was
[1:11:17] persecuted you know with the robbers and
[1:11:20] he was sentenced to praising
[1:11:22] if i can if i can rightly collect i
[1:11:25] think
[1:11:26] it was something that was going to be
[1:11:27] about maybe
[1:11:29] is it 20 25 years something like that
[1:11:33] and that's how he found himself in
[1:11:35] praising but you know
[1:11:38] uh uh
[1:11:44] you know he said he preached a message
[1:11:46] after he came out of praising
[1:11:48] he says he never he never said a
[1:11:51] sentence
[1:11:52] he said the purpose
[1:11:55] he said he served purpose he never said
[1:11:57] a sentence
[1:11:58] because he rocked the praising
[1:12:03] and brought many of the gang's guys
[1:12:06] to a conviction
[1:12:10] i mean even uh the the
[1:12:13] the the prison guys and all the dead i
[1:12:16] was there that year
[1:12:18] brother brother
[1:12:22] brother david the pleasure junior was
[1:12:24] going to take me to the praising
[1:12:26] uh to see brother babes i remember
[1:12:29] coming back from
[1:12:30] from pier by possible elizabeth
[1:12:34] port elizabeth i just preached for his
[1:12:35] dad and he was bringing me back
[1:12:37] and we were making plans to go and see
[1:12:39] brother bates but i think
[1:12:41] that weekend uh there was something that
[1:12:44] was going on
[1:12:45] because uh the saints have started you
[1:12:47] know
[1:12:48] uh taking message box and materials to
[1:12:51] the praising
[1:12:52] and uh computers you know and
[1:12:55] and there was a serious prison ministry
[1:12:57] that was going out there
[1:12:59] and with with all of the changes you
[1:13:01] know the
[1:13:02] effect of the law through uh brother
[1:13:04] babe's life and his ministry
[1:13:06] in the praising uh reduce his sentence
[1:13:09] you know
[1:13:10] and uh uh i don't i don't think this is
[1:13:14] what the george said but if i was the
[1:13:15] george this is what i would saying
[1:13:17] if this man is a robber that's the kind
[1:13:19] of a robber we need out there
[1:13:22] amen praise the lord but
[1:13:25] they realized that no they got the wrong
[1:13:27] man in the prison because i mean he
[1:13:29] rocked the praising
[1:13:31] amen before he left from there there was
[1:13:33] a church in praising amen
[1:13:36] so yeah i mean he had a tremendous
[1:13:39] tremendous testimony
[1:13:41] and i mean just to know that he was he
[1:13:44] was
[1:13:45] put awaiting from his wife his family
[1:13:47] his church
[1:13:49] and uh i think he he said i think
[1:13:52] five year old over five years something
[1:13:54] like that i don't have my number
[1:13:56] straight
[1:13:57] but uh it does not matter how many years
[1:14:01] he spent there
[1:14:02] it's what the lord did there amen praise
[1:14:05] the lord and
[1:14:06] and i mean it's it's kind of for the
[1:14:08] great loss
[1:14:09] you know kind of for the great loss that
[1:14:12] uh
[1:14:12] that the lord i mean that happened there
[1:14:16] but
[1:14:16] you know our loss is his gain amen
[1:14:20] praise the lord our loss is his gain
[1:14:24] that's why paul says praise the lord so
[1:14:28] i was i was kind of a following uh
[1:14:31] memorial service today it was it was
[1:14:33] just emotional
[1:14:34] but we want to thank the lord we want to
[1:14:37] thank the lord and
[1:14:38] and blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:14:41] praise the lord
[1:14:42] what a wonderful savior we serve amen
[1:14:45] what a wonderful savior we serve
[1:14:48] he's so amazing amen
[1:14:51] our god is faithful praise the lord
[1:14:55] our god is faithful
[1:14:59] praise the lord i was looking at
[1:15:01] something
[1:15:03] today and he was talking about family
[1:15:06] resemblance
[1:15:08] i prefer to uh physical similarities
[1:15:12] here between closer relatives
[1:15:14] especially between parents and children
[1:15:16] and between
[1:15:17] siblings and uh you know i was trying to
[1:15:21] take those things from the natural
[1:15:23] and compare it to the spiritual but i
[1:15:25] realized that i have
[1:15:27] i have about 15 minutes to do it tonight
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] praise the lord are you ready do you
[1:15:32] have your seat belt on
[1:15:34] amen praise the lord we will just trust
[1:15:37] that he can be able to lift us up in his
[1:15:39] presence amen
[1:15:41] praise the lord but we've been talking
[1:15:44] about this uh
[1:15:45] uh uh amazing thing uh
[1:15:48] of of of of family resemblance
[1:15:52] amen is is such an amazing thing
[1:15:55] you know that
[1:16:00] the power of the blood amen
[1:16:03] the power you just think if if
[1:16:06] if the natural blood if the natural
[1:16:09] human blood of of our parents
[1:16:13] is able to produce a resemblance
[1:16:16] unto them what would the blood of god
[1:16:21] do
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:24] what would god's own blood do for his
[1:16:27] children
[1:16:30] amen if the natural blood of
[1:16:34] our parents not only resemblance
[1:16:40] they are they are i mean they are traits
[1:16:42] of our parents
[1:16:45] praise the lord amen the only thing
[1:16:49] that the baptising of the holy ghost
[1:16:51] does
[1:16:52] is to destroy the curse
[1:16:56] that's all the baptising of the holy
[1:17:00] ghost destroyed the curse
[1:17:01] that runs in our family line
[1:17:05] but it does not take habits away
[1:17:09] there are some habits that we have of
[1:17:11] our father
[1:17:13] of our parents
[1:17:16] i know i do i've chewed my lips i know
[1:17:19] that's that's from my dad
[1:17:22] praise the lord there are sometimes when
[1:17:24] i laugh
[1:17:25] i catch my mama as soon alive i see her
[1:17:29] face
[1:17:33] and it just sounds like her in my ears
[1:17:38] the new birth does not take our family
[1:17:40] traits away
[1:17:42] no
[1:17:46] i know i have to i i had to talk that
[1:17:48] over with some brothers and
[1:17:50] and and it was i mean referring to uh
[1:17:53] that quote brother branham said over
[1:17:55] there in in
[1:17:56] in paradox and and some people believe
[1:17:59] that the new birth take our family tree
[1:18:01] no the new birth only destroyed the
[1:18:03] curse
[1:18:04] that's what the baptism of the holy
[1:18:06] ghost does
[1:18:12] if the neighbors were taking our family
[1:18:14] trace away
[1:18:15] we would have children they would know
[1:18:17] they would look nothing different from
[1:18:18] us
[1:18:20] because even our facial resemblance
[1:18:24] is all part of our of the traits that's
[1:18:26] in the blood
[1:18:28] but you think about it tonight
[1:18:31] think about it if i don't if if nothing
[1:18:34] is said
[1:18:35] that that draw you closer to god i hope
[1:18:38] this won't there
[1:18:39] if the natural blood of your parents
[1:18:45] could produce
[1:18:48] a physical resemblance
[1:18:55] and there in the book of revelation the
[1:18:57] bible says we've been loosed by his
[1:18:59] blood
[1:19:03] amen what will the blood of jesus
[1:19:07] by the new birth produce
[1:19:12] that's one thing i know it will not
[1:19:14] produce
[1:19:16] it will not produce a physical
[1:19:20] resemblance
[1:19:22] right amen it will not produce a
[1:19:25] physical resemblance that one thing
[1:19:27] i know it will not produce it will not
[1:19:30] produce a physical resemblance
[1:19:32] yes yes because it's not human blood
[1:19:38] it's not a fleshly blood let me say it
[1:19:41] that way
[1:19:44] so it will not produce
[1:19:47] a physical resemblance
[1:19:52] so we are not i mean we're not called to
[1:19:54] resemble
[1:19:55] you know what churches want to resemble
[1:19:58] uh uh
[1:19:58] want their people to look alike by
[1:20:00] giving them uniforms to wear
[1:20:02] by giving them code of others you know
[1:20:05] let all the sisters tie their heads
[1:20:07] let all the men sit this way love the
[1:20:09] woman i mean they
[1:20:10] try to find a uniform way to make the
[1:20:14] people look alike that's not what the
[1:20:16] blood of jesus christ
[1:20:17] oh
[1:20:26] praise the lord amen
[1:20:31] they will not give us
[1:20:34] because we have to realize
[1:20:37] that this blood is producing a mystical
[1:20:40] body
[1:20:42] it's not producing a physical body is
[1:20:45] producing
[1:20:46] a mystical body
[1:20:50] praise the lord mystical body from
[1:20:54] all nations around the world every tribe
[1:21:01] praise the lord i mean you can go down
[1:21:04] to the darkest village
[1:21:06] you will still find somebody that have a
[1:21:09] nature of jesus christ
[1:21:16] they don't look nothing like you they
[1:21:17] don't speak the same language with you
[1:21:22] [Music]
[1:21:23] but the life of christ runs through
[1:21:26] their veins when they have experienced
[1:21:27] the new breath of jesus christ
[1:21:30] amen amen
[1:21:34] praise the lord we have to realize it's
[1:21:37] not the church that is giving birth
[1:21:40] no that's the reason why don't compel
[1:21:43] people to be like your assembly
[1:21:45] the way you do things in your church
[1:21:47] because it's not your church that is
[1:21:49] giving birth to those people
[1:21:51] it's god that is giving birth
[1:21:56] and he's a god of varieties
[1:21:59] praise the lord hey amen he's a god of
[1:22:02] varietage
[1:22:05] that's why some are taught in the family
[1:22:08] come on
[1:22:10] amen amen praise the lord hallelujah
[1:22:16] it's god that is giving birth
[1:22:19] we are born of the sea
[1:22:22] incorruptible which is the word of god
[1:22:29] praise the lord we are born by the sea
[1:22:32] incorruptible thank you jesus thank you
[1:22:38] but every child has
[1:22:42] a unique way that they resemble the
[1:22:45] father that's right
[1:22:48] every child has a unique way
[1:22:53] praise the lord oh this is the god that
[1:22:55] we serve yeah amen
[1:23:00] and then when the body comes together
[1:23:03] when the mystical body comes together
[1:23:05] then the full
[1:23:06] image of the father comes together
[1:23:12] praise the lord because there in the
[1:23:14] mystical body there is prophecy there is
[1:23:16] tons there is vision
[1:23:18] all the gifts out there
[1:23:25] amen amen
[1:23:28] oh praise the lord tonight amen
[1:23:31] hallelujah
[1:23:32] praise the lord my goodness
[1:23:35] amen amen we refer to this on the uh
[1:23:40] sunday why why why people can keep their
[1:23:43] victory brother branham says you notice
[1:23:45] how beautiful it is to go to to go to
[1:23:47] the bedroom he says i do
[1:23:49] with my with my little boy i stand there
[1:23:52] with
[1:23:52] uh little joseph and with my wife and
[1:23:56] and we would kiss him from one side of
[1:23:58] the cheek to the other
[1:23:59] as we laid him on the bed and i said to
[1:24:02] mama you know
[1:24:03] he got eyes something
[1:24:06] like yours
[1:24:10] you think about it
[1:24:13] they are not even from the same parents
[1:24:15] they are from different parents
[1:24:18] the husband and the wife different
[1:24:20] background
[1:24:22] but yet when they come under they come
[1:24:28] under that coveted
[1:24:31] of marriage is able to produce
[1:24:35] a resemblance
[1:24:41] praise the lord
[1:24:44] the wife can look and says just like my
[1:24:47] mama and the husband look at the same
[1:24:49] person and say no just like my mama
[1:24:56] what a mystery what a mystery
[1:25:01] then what will the life of christ
[1:25:03] produce
[1:25:05] what will the life of christ produce
[1:25:10] are we together oh my goodness
[1:25:15] i mean you get so stuck in that thought
[1:25:18] it's just hard for you to get away from
[1:25:20] it
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:27] as chapter 11
[1:25:30] you all know this verse 20 says and when
[1:25:33] they have found him
[1:25:35] they brought him unto anter and it came
[1:25:37] to pass
[1:25:39] that the whole year they assembled
[1:25:41] themselves
[1:25:42] with the church and taught much people
[1:25:46] and the disciples were called christians
[1:25:51] first in answer
[1:25:54] amen
[1:26:04] they call them christians
[1:26:07] because they saw the amount of life
[1:26:14] praise the lord they saw
[1:26:17] the way they were living they saw the
[1:26:20] abandon of life
[1:26:22] and they were first called christians
[1:26:29] because they recognized
[1:26:32] the life that they were living
[1:26:36] they were all now wearing their hair
[1:26:38] like christ
[1:26:39] they were now wearing their sandals like
[1:26:41] christ even though
[1:26:43] all the people in the east look alike
[1:26:46] in the weighted dress and normally that
[1:26:49] is that is
[1:26:50] that is think that some one of the
[1:26:52] things that comes with nation
[1:26:57] but it was from the way that they were
[1:26:59] living
[1:27:03] from their life
[1:27:07] that they were called christians
[1:27:14] praise the lord which means
[1:27:18] uh christ like
[1:27:23] amen christ like followers of christ
[1:27:29] they could see they could see the
[1:27:31] resemblance of all the things that they
[1:27:33] have heard
[1:27:35] all the things some of the people there
[1:27:36] in anchora perhaps might have never met
[1:27:39] jesus
[1:27:40] in his ethnic ministry but of all the
[1:27:43] things that they have heard
[1:27:46] of this man called jesus
[1:27:49] now they could see being displayed
[1:27:54] and these bunch of believers
[1:27:58] praise the lord amen
[1:28:03] why because jesus gave them this promise
[1:28:08] verily i said unto you he that believeth
[1:28:11] in me
[1:28:13] the works that i do
[1:28:17] i mean the works that i do
[1:28:22] that's where the family resemblance is
[1:28:24] tied
[1:28:26] the family resemblance is not in our
[1:28:30] our physical traits
[1:28:34] we all don't have to wear white shirt
[1:28:36] and pull back here
[1:28:40] praise the lord for us to look alike
[1:28:44] okay then we can find out the ones that
[1:28:46] come to good shepherd is the ones that
[1:28:48] are in white shirt
[1:28:49] and and black paints
[1:28:53] the family resemblance is in this the
[1:28:56] work that i do
[1:29:01] shall you do also and greater
[1:29:05] which of course brother branham says
[1:29:06] more work but you see the thing about it
[1:29:08] there is that in
[1:29:10] in a family structure a
[1:29:13] father he worked so hard
[1:29:19] he sent his children to school
[1:29:22] he supported them
[1:29:25] if he's a fisherman he he teach them a
[1:29:28] tray
[1:29:29] to fishing and what is in the mind of
[1:29:32] the father
[1:29:33] is that the son all the children
[1:29:37] will get a better life
[1:29:40] greater than this you will do
[1:29:46] that the children will get a better life
[1:29:50] than what the father had very good
[1:29:53] amen that's why he invest in them
[1:29:57] he tried to empower them
[1:30:02] for them to get a better life for them
[1:30:04] to go up a little higher
[1:30:10] so jesus speaking to to us his children
[1:30:13] the work that i do
[1:30:19] you will do the same even greater works
[1:30:28] praise the lord amen
[1:30:34] if the natural blood of our parents
[1:30:40] praise the lord
[1:30:44] you see some you see some some family
[1:30:47] is just i mean it's it's it's just it's
[1:30:49] just it's just dripping down the
[1:30:51] blood
[1:30:55] the father is a medical doctor the wife
[1:30:57] is a medical doctor
[1:30:58] the first son is a surgeon i mean it's
[1:31:01] just driving down their blood
[1:31:06] it's there and it's there in in in that
[1:31:09] in their
[1:31:09] in that in that family strain
[1:31:13] ca giving
[1:31:18] mean ca giving just run down their
[1:31:21] family stream
[1:31:35] if the natural blood can be able to
[1:31:39] produce that
[1:31:40] then you as a son of god you as a
[1:31:44] daughter of god
[1:31:49] his blood
[1:31:53] amen will be able to produce
[1:31:56] overcoming life in you
[1:32:00] his blood will be able to produce
[1:32:02] sacrificial life in you
[1:32:05] because that's the thing that is in his
[1:32:07] blood
[1:32:08] sacrificial love true overcoming
[1:32:12] power
[1:32:15] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:32:18] there is no door movement for
[1:32:20] for a christian because from the first
[1:32:22] day to the sixth day there was no
[1:32:24] dull moment for our father every day was
[1:32:28] he did
[1:32:28] something and he said it is good and god
[1:32:32] expect that everyday something will be
[1:32:34] good in your life
[1:32:41] i mean the devil can bless you here then
[1:32:43] he can blast you here
[1:32:44] and he i mean he can do everything but
[1:32:46] when you come to the end of your day
[1:32:48] you should be just like father god you
[1:32:51] can look back
[1:32:52] and say it was a good day

[1:33:53] branham in teaching moses
[1:33:55] he said that was the thing that amram
[1:33:57] did and i believe
[1:33:59] personally that's what it it please god
[1:34:02] that the deliverer should come through
[1:34:03] him brother branham says after they will
[1:34:05] be whipped on the field
[1:34:07] he said when amra comes home he would
[1:34:09] crawl in the attic
[1:34:11] and he would get down and say oh jehovah
[1:34:14] you say to our father abraham
[1:34:19] your seed shall sow john in a strange
[1:34:21] land
[1:34:22] he said and jacob would come and say
[1:34:24] amram you are tired
[1:34:26] it was a busy day today he says but i
[1:34:29] have to call him jehovah
[1:34:33] amen and pretty soon amra and
[1:34:36] determination
[1:34:37] and prayer alive started contaminating
[1:34:39] the camp
[1:34:40] the angel of the lord started visiting
[1:34:42] the camp and every household started
[1:34:44] praying
[1:34:45] because it was time for the for the
[1:34:47] deliverer to come on the scene
[1:34:49] if the people that are called by my name
[1:34:51] will humble themselves
[1:34:54] amen praise the lord oh the lord can
[1:34:58] take a prayer flame from your life
[1:35:00] and spread it all over the city amen
[1:35:04] i'm a physical witness of that amen he
[1:35:07] can take a prayer flame from your life
[1:35:14] just like how the the the tabernacle
[1:35:16] candle is light it goes right down there
[1:35:19] to the to the fire and one candle back
[1:35:21] to another
[1:35:22] god can do the same thing to the life of
[1:35:24] his people
[1:35:32] he can spread a praying influence on his
[1:35:35] people
[1:35:36] and people that be crying out for the
[1:35:37] holy ghost be crying now for more of god
[1:35:44] praise the lord because we see family
[1:35:46] resemblance
[1:35:47] in praying the bible say he was leave
[1:35:50] his disciple find a private place that
[1:35:52] is something that is in the family
[1:35:53] resemblance
[1:35:54] that is the way we resemble the father
[1:35:59] when we love to commune with him
[1:36:04] is the likeness like paul said
[1:36:07] his spirit constrained us is the
[1:36:10] likeness
[1:36:15] it's a powerful thing it's a powerful
[1:36:19] thing
[1:36:22] it's a powerful thing and just like i
[1:36:24] said on sunday
[1:36:25] when science
[1:36:28] struck the dna court
[1:36:32] when they struck the dna court
[1:36:39] they had to reveal
[1:36:42] a lot of their formal
[1:36:47] scientific research because there were
[1:36:50] things
[1:36:51] there were things there are things in
[1:36:53] the dna court
[1:36:56] that without that
[1:37:02] if we never had that in this time that
[1:37:04] we are living in
[1:37:05] the world would have been a scary place
[1:37:10] amen just like how god
[1:37:13] had to lose the the the seals
[1:37:17] the secrets that were in the back part
[1:37:19] of god's mind that's the same way he had
[1:37:21] to bring signs to that place
[1:37:25] praise the lord because god
[1:37:30] knew the evil that is coming upon the
[1:37:32] world realize such a word that we are
[1:37:34] living in
[1:37:35] with violence
[1:37:39] amen if we never had a d in the call
[1:37:41] there would be nowhere to do up topsy
[1:37:46] i mean with the dna called it had just
[1:37:48] made investigation so easy
[1:37:51] fingerprints
[1:38:00] and that same thing had just made the
[1:38:02] trace of the bible so easy
[1:38:06] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:38:09] amen the opening of the word
[1:38:15] the losing of those seals
[1:38:18] we can we can find satan in all of his
[1:38:21] tracks
[1:38:24] amen i mean we can find
[1:38:27] satan in all of his tracks because and
[1:38:31] what what did the suit brought to us it
[1:38:33] was the scene
[1:38:35] it was the same rather
[1:38:39] from the first house he was seen rather
[1:38:42] he was just
[1:38:43] he was just it was just an immortal he
[1:38:45] was changing his farm
[1:38:46] but every time he changed his phone and
[1:38:48] went to the next edge
[1:38:50] the dna called picks him up
[1:38:54] and said he's the one on the white house
[1:38:56] he's the one on the red house he's the
[1:38:58] one on the black house he's the one on
[1:39:00] the pill house
[1:39:05] god the nicole picks him up so the bride
[1:39:08] can be able to identify him in
[1:39:10] all his tricks
[1:39:14] in all his strengths even when he's
[1:39:17] tracking us
[1:39:17] in our mind
[1:39:21] because she has the word amen
[1:39:25] and she's been giving power to use the
[1:39:27] world
[1:39:28] she knows what to do with the world
[1:39:33] that's what is making this bride an
[1:39:35] invincible army
[1:39:37] because she's not depending on her
[1:39:39] intelligence she's using the word
[1:39:42] she's using the word lord
[1:39:46] what did your word says
[1:39:52] what that's your verses
[1:39:56] praise the lord amen
[1:40:01] you know when you when you get yourself
[1:40:04] into a material whether you're reading a
[1:40:06] book or something
[1:40:08] it just floss your mind it's hard for
[1:40:09] you to say something without talking
[1:40:11] about it
[1:40:12] you know just just you know sharing
[1:40:14] testimony of that of that lady i mean it
[1:40:16] was just
[1:40:16] just so so blessed i mean and and the
[1:40:19] thing there
[1:40:20] that was that was so wonderful
[1:40:24] was
[1:40:28] if you ever had a closer walk with god
[1:40:31] and someone is talking about an intimate
[1:40:34] relationship with god it just it just
[1:40:37] reflects it reminds you
[1:40:39] it plays back you say to yourself i have
[1:40:43] been there before
[1:40:45] i've been down this road before praise
[1:40:48] the lord
[1:40:51] look this bible speaks
[1:40:55] this bible speaks this bible can speak
[1:40:57] to you
[1:40:58] directly this is the word of god this is
[1:41:02] god amen
[1:41:05] in print form
[1:41:13] praise the lord
[1:41:22] we have a mirror to look for the family
[1:41:26] resemblance
[1:41:30] this is the merit of god's word where we
[1:41:32] go and look for the family resemblance
[1:41:35] you look out your life you bring it to
[1:41:37] the word you say do i resemble my father
[1:41:40] in this way
[1:41:43] is this a resemblance of my father
[1:41:46] or it's just my own selfish ways
[1:41:52] oh it's just my own stubborn ways
[1:41:56] like sometimes people will take their
[1:41:58] self-stubbornness as zeal
[1:42:03] praise the lord they will take it as as
[1:42:06] as they
[1:42:06] have a zeal for god
[1:42:16] praise the lord
[1:42:20] verily verdi i say unto you
[1:42:25] he that believeth in me the works that i
[1:42:27] do

[1:44:04] it is not physical appearance
[1:44:08] is the character of his word
[1:44:13] is a character
[1:44:16] of the word of god
