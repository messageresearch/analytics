glad to be in the house of the lord this morning and the lord bless you you may have your seat let's just take a few prayer requests here and then we will praise the lord [Music] before we go to the lord and pray we will uh [Music] the the trustees actually there installed the the offering entire box back there that was one of the mentor that we we use uh to be able to uh deal with our returning back to church after the kovac and i realized that many of the saints have gone on to uh online offering entire pain which of course they have brought some sense of discipline to us but we also have to realize that we have we have a young generation we are a young church full of young people and children learn from what they see and i was i've taught about a few times and then i spoke with the deacons and we talked and decided that we will go back to passing the offering bag now if you are if you are uh back if you are into the habit of doing what you are doing is working well for you you feel like you are disciplined that way i mean is is between you and the lord and then that that is good but uh we we always try to be mindful of our young generation uh taking sides with jesus better better emphasize on the end he says whatever we do we have to keep in mind that there's a generation that is coming after us we want to lay the right kind of for example and and encourage them so i told they can't we will we will we will just go back to that and the song leader would call them up and then we would do it and in that way we will have the privilege to teach our children uh uh giving because it's part of our worship when the wise men saw his tide in the east they came to worship him but in honor of their worship they also brought gifts it's not it's not all just about money it's just part of worship so we want to do that to be able to carry our our little children with us just like moses said we don't want to leave anyone behind and then talking about the little children it's been there a long while the same reason also because of the corv8 when we start to redo this place and some renovation and all of that we took away the children's chopper which was our children's sunday school and we've been we've been thinking how to come back how to how to be able to get those young ones how to keep them in fellowship how to teach them i know the parents you have the greater responsibility to teach your children but yet as an assembly we want to also find a way to keep them in fellowship with one another and also with what is done here so we know we don't have the space we don't have the space the back room back there we we rearrange it and try to make it in different way for the mothers and their babies but yet is is stay a multi-purpose room the the musicians go there to pray and prepare themselves before they come up here i think the mothers use the rooms less than than than we are so we were thinking that we will work on the schedule and and see if we can get the kids a saturday or two in a month where they can come down to the church and the sisters that will work with them can be able to have all the time to work with them if it is just one saturday in the month or you know every other saturday we will work with that gradually as we as we try to to work with our little ones if ever if any one of us have had a sunday school day and had a good sunday school teacher we know how important that is and we don't want to despise that so for the by the way of announcement those are the two things so uh beginning the next service the deacons will just come true quickly and uh and then the service will continue right in the midst of the service uh we have a prayer request here the uh sister naomi wrote one and she's asking for prayer for sister nadine there's sister grace i believe there's sister grace mother-in-law and george mother we want to just bring her before the lord this morning and she's in the hospital i think it should be the doctor report she's not expected to live and she's having diabetes complication but we are standing this morning before the giver of life he has the final say he has the last word praise the lord so we're not going to take the doctor report we're going to give it to him praise the lord and we know that he's more than able and as we remember that we will also want to pray uh i think many of us will remember brother frederick he was a young student brother that was that was coming to church here for the y and we were praying for him because he had a heart problem uh in the in the past week brother fredrick went to be with the lord he passed away over in kinshasa and on my way back from the meetings in zimbabwe his brother called me and while i was in amsterdam and told me that he was in a critical condition i went i thought i would talk to him on the phone but the brother couldn't go into the hospital room so i got back home and and tried to help them to get medication and different things but just in the midst of the week he went to be with the lord what would be gracious and encouraging his brother brother hope [Music] had a dream because brother hope was the one that that kind of got in contact with brother frederick uh in the same school and tried to encourage him you know uh uh encourage him to church and all of that so they were friends and so so i will always talk to frederick i mean talk to hope when i'm not hearing from frederick you know he was always concerned but i hope we have a dream the very morning that uh fredrik will pass away and then uh you tell me that he you know had that dream that morning it looks like frederick was it was like he was on the journey and he has he had a uh you know like a weight load on him and he just came and put the load down and started greeting all the believers and said i'm tired you know i'm tired and and and hope said in his dream when frederick embraced him he was weeping you know and then as soon as he got off the dream there was a text on his phone that federer has gone to be with the lord and so and then also another brother a friend in the same cycle of brothers that he have come here and his wife they are friends to [Music] you know aerial hope in every one of us penny he lost his dad also they flew from france to do an organ replacement at a male clinic the surgery went well but right after the surgery there was an infection that that affected the work that was done and he he passed so we want to buy our hearts and and and just remember these ones remember these ones penny and his family we want to pray for them we want to pray for brother frederick's family as they are preparing to lay him to rest this coming weekend and we also want to pray for brother george mother sister nandin we

from my my voice yet praise the lord judges georges chapter seven georges chapter seven george's chapter 7 maybe we can read revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and then we get back to george's uh revelation chapter 10 and then you can have you see then we get back and read from george's i just want to take a scene from the book of judges to be able to find a title amen praise the lord i remember preaching there the last service there in zimbabwe and then one of the brothers came from the from the sound room and he ran to me and he says brother what is your what what is the topic you know uh i said well he says he says what is what is your saying on topic i said what you think it is said what what did i preach on i pray amen uh revelation chapter 10 verse 1 praise the lord hallelujah you know and i i'm so grateful for our our tech team i don't need to tell them they know how to make subjects they just give it any topic sometimes a local i said did i preach that praise the lord revelation chapter 10 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillow of fire and he had in his hands a little broke open and he set his right foot upon the seed and his left foot upon the earth and cry with a loud voice as when a lion ruleth and when he have cried seven thunder altered their voices father we ask your blessing upon the word as we want to follow the order of reading the scriptures standing up honoring your word and oh god we will ask that you help us through the rest of the service as we need your help in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed georges chapter seven we can go back to georges chapter seven and bill i was saying from the book of george's uh uh chapter seven we notice is talking about gideon when gideon went into his battle is uh is is very very amazing you see a lot of sense of humor that god plays as you read the bible you know you you you put yourself in it and just like you are watching the movie and sometimes it can be beautiful because there are some scenes that just that just kind of grab your mind here george's in george's chapter seven gideon was going into uh one of his major battle against the mennonite praise the lord and as he as he takes up in his battle we realize here that he had he had uh the a lot of men that went out with him and uh trying to get the right figure here some thousand men went out with him and god told gideon that the men that have gone out with you there they are too many you know if uh if uh was about 22 000 you know and uh the law said there are too many so gideon said to the people that if you are afraid please turn back and go so this huge amount of people turn back i think they were earnest praise the lord they were earnest people they turn back and go so he was left with ten thousand men the lord came and told him no gideon ten thousand is too much you know i'm almighty god all power i can use one person you know 10 000 is too much so i want you to bring the people down to the to the to the river and uh he says if you bring them down to the river you know those that will that will uh you know lift the water you know uh put in one side those that will buy their hairs and drink directly from the from the from the river you put them one side so uh there were three thousand men that took the water and they leap it you know just uh uh like the strip just leave the water like dogs and there were seven thousand men on the other side that by their heads you know as i'm as i'm reading this in my mind yara said a bunch of thousand people have just returned back you know they have just gone back about 22 000 people have just returned back okay and ten thousand and what gideon said if you are afraid go back so with this ten thousand now uh they said they were not afraid so god is giving them this option of of drinking for them to go across the river into the battle so you look at the the position of the seven thousand men i mean they buy their heads right to the water to drink you might think that well maybe these guys are not afraid you know and you think about these guys that you know they dip the water and they're looking over their shoulder and drinking you see yeah these guys that are they are afraid but you see them but god has a different word of looking at you [Music] praise the lord well in one sense i think god just wanted a small number okay let's not make it complicated let's not reason into it you know but uh he has a different way to look at our strength the way we look at our strength is not the way he looks at it he has a different way to look at our strength praise the lord and with what the scripture taught us is that when god is looking for strength in you he looked for your weakness he looked for your weakness because a chain is only strong at its weaker length so he always looked for your weakness and that's where he stepped in and and perfect his strength so he has a different way and so here i saw the lord choose these uh three thousand men and send their seven thousand back i know those guys were saying these ones that were scary they were just sleeping in the water that's the one you you i mean i was i was not afraid i just put my head down but god has a different way of looking at our strength but we see here in the scripture as they went alone we want to uh read from uh verse 13. i want to take our reading from verse 13 george 7 13 and when gideon was come behold there was a man that tore a dream unto his fellow and said behold a dream a dream and load a kick of barley bread tumble into the host of the media praise the lord now this is this is this is it don't have much to do with what we want to talk but think about it i just want you to think about it your barley bread this is a dream take it back to joseph when a man had a dream in praising he was a baker praise the lord and when he narrated that dream it had a sense of death so we see another barley cake here just in a way of looking at how scripture interprets itself praise the lord the cup bureau was the one that that joseph said you you will go you'll be free and what did he what did joseph did when his brother was going he took his cup he save a cup and put it in benjamin beg jesus said are you able to drink of my cup we know that savor represents redemption so just to get you thinking i want to grab your spirit i'm featuring for your spirit so i'm going to throw these things out so you can get a bite on it praise the lord so let's continue to read here look a cake of bali bread tumbling into the house of the media and he came and came onto a tent and and smart at that it fell and overturned and the tent laid alone and his fellow answer and said this is nothing else said the sword of gideon son of josh a man of israel fall into his hands have god deliver meeting in all the hosts and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned to the host of ezra and said arise for the lord have delivered into your hand the host of media and he divided the 300 men into three companies and pulled a trumpet in every man's hand and with empty picture and lime within the pictures and said unto them look unto me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be dead as i do so shall you do when i blow with the trumpet i and all that are with me then blow here the trumpet also and on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon praise the lord that's what i was looking for i just took that i was what i was looking for in the scripture that drew me to this uh uh passage i was looking for about to cry looking for the battle cried i was i was i was uh whether reading or listening to a book out and then and then uh they wrote the the right side of the book says that the josh joshua lived by faith was the battlecry of reformation that thing just talked on my spirit i said if reformation have a battle cry then restoration also have a battle cry so every battle that's about to cry and you have to you have to know your battle cry because it's the battle cry that wakes you up the captain sound on the line he might say that slogan or he might say something that is the battle cry and when you hear that that's when you wake up praise the lord so i believe that the bride has a battle crying amen there's something that will have to wake us up for the rapture there is something that is placed in the world that we need to wake us up praise the lord definitely the judge shall lived by faith that was the battlecry of reformation that was the thing that shook the catholic war it was something that went around the world praise the lord it was an inspiration that luther had returning back from rome he was so serious he went to rome he wanted to see you know how the church handled things in rome how how he can rise to this place of importance a place of pleasing god a man that will whip himself in the roman and knock his head on the wall try to do everything because he wanted to achieve pleasing god and when he got down there to rome he saw all the immorality and the filthiness that was in in rome he says this cannot be the church he was so discouraged he got back on the boat and while he was on the boat he met some men you know they are they're a christian men and in conversation one of them repeated what uh uh paul said in the book of rumors the judge shall live by faith you know it was they were talking there and when he got back he went looking in his bible and reading what the apostle paul wrote and the holy spirit just stand there you see what the holy spirit stem is not that looter was looking for a better understanding or he was looking for some kind of a knowledge no he had a burden on his heart to do right he was not looking for what to make him famous or to make him popular he was looking for what he can do to please god and the holy spirit is making luther to know you have nothing to do but believe in what christ have already done there is nothing you have effortless to do give your body to be burned without charity is nothing give all your goods to the poor without charity it's nothing so the holy spirit brought that simple understanding and that was the thing that ginger gear looter we will say ginger amen praise the lord that was the thing that woke him up now all these things of penance and and and purgatory and all of these things uh i mean there is no salvation in it our salvation is only in the finished work of jesus christ that was the thing that woke him up so that was his battle cry when a trumpet gave an uncertain sound who will prepare for war you have to know what is the language in the trumpet glory is it for war or is it for peace so there is a battle crime if you don't know your battlecry you can never prepare for what this age will bring upon you you will just be trying everything trying to live right trying to please a church running from one church to another but to be able to face the battle of your age you must know your battlecry gideon said if you yeah me shout when the trumpet go and i say the sword of the lord and the sword of gideon run into the camp praise the lord don't run before your cry you gotta wait you gotta understand the message don't just be excited you got to understand the message are we together praise the lord amen oh how we love the lord and you know these these kind of things they can they they have a way that they can they can excite me praise the lord sorry for that but and then uh so i i went i started looking uh just just this morning i was kind of meditating and as i was saying uh i wonder what was john wesley battle cry praise the lord i i i don't know exactly but uh i i find some famous quote of john wesley that that old england preacher and he says this i will just read one or two of them he says unless god has raised you up unless god has raised you up for this very thing you will be worn out by the opposition of men and the devil that's right until unless god has raised you up for this hour unless god has raised you up for this day pretty soon you get tired amen you will get tired with all the negative things on the internet you will get tired with the way people are misrepresenting christ misrepresenting the message but if god has raised you up praise the lord you will always find a strength to press on unless god has raised you up for this very thing you will be worn out he says light yourself put yourself on fire with passion he says and people will come from fire to wash you burning amen he said get on fire for god [Music] you have to remember that john as a child he was held out of the fire from a burning house from a burning house as a little child he was held out of the fire so just just that childhood experience had an impression on this man that he always wanted to be on fire amen he always wanted to be on fire praise the lord william simon from the azusa street his battle cry was let the fire fall amen hallelujah amen was your body to cry this morning amen the brow has a bottle cry amen praise the lord oh my you love the lord this morning let's give the lord a hand of praise amen hallelujah amen what a wonderful jesus yourself [Applause] what a wonderful jesus we sell driving yesterday coming here and uh just to spend some time and and visit with some friends and i was playing the message of deity of jesus christ i played that many times but you see sometimes something have to be on your mind for the holy spirit to pick up certain things and show it to you amen and what was on my mind actually that i wanted to preach on the message when the lions wrote that was what i wanted to preach so i was as i was looking at uh i was looking at uh i was looking at what happens when two lions have the same prey praise the lord because because in revelation chapter 10 if we return back then in revelation chapter 10 if we would turn back there the scripture says praise the lord are we together in revelation chapter 10 verse 3 when this mighty angel cried he cried with a loud voice as when a lion ruleth amen as when a lion ruleth so we see that this mighty angel having an association with the lion of the trap of judah praise the lord he cried with a live voice as when the lion ruleth but peter the apostle also told us in first peter chapter five amen in first peter chapter five the apostle peter told us verse eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a rolling lion walking about seeking whom he may devour so we have the mighty injure crying out us when the lion ruleth and then we also have the devil roaming about as a rolling line praise the lord a lion can own a roar when he has a prey that's why amos said amos chapter 3. so in my mind i'm thinking i'm thinking in my mind now what happened when when uh when two lions are targeting the same parade i'm thinking about this in my mind praise the lord amen hallelujah you know asa as as uh as a poor preacher there are some people that can pull these things out better than me as a poor preacher you try to to be very creative but then thinking about that i was i was listening to messengers up just driving and then this this story came out brother branham says the deity of christ listen to this now he says i believe that we are facing are you listening to me he says we are facing now looking at the greatest drama that's ever been set in human history working out year before us the great feel of the world is here and a drama that god is going to act out right now praise the lord that's a starting he says to look around over the world and see how the things are moving together oh is something fixing to happen friends this what we have talked about and said about is right now year is ready starting everywhere breaking out now this is the picture now are you ready for this let's watch he said there is a picture i didn't like to picture to you this morning i see an alarm out in the field feeding a little feather becoming nervous he wondered look look over and read right behind him i see a lion slipping up real easy and patching his tails on the ground that's what the lion do if you if you if you if you watch a lion seeking his prey it moves gets itself to the ground and then he knocks his tail on the ground it's using a signal it's putting his wifi on praise the lord patting the stared on the ground getting his feet ready for a spring he says that's the church out in the field the little line is the church out in the field the darkness of communism is pushing all over the world closing in like a great shadow the devil like a rolling lion seeking for war and this is the lord of contracts takes like before day it's always the darkest before day because the day is breaking pushing the darkness and here's the lord of contrast you see makes it the darkest before day praise the lord now so with this picture in my mind i told myself why man i got an inspiration here lord jesus if you can just help me i have an inspiration here and then i started reading quotes from brother i'm talking about he says the rolling of a lion will scare you to death he said a lion roar will kill you before he gets on you when the lion rolls you die your eyes are just open the road of a lion will kill you before he gets to you praise the lord so we see here as i'm picturing this in my mind you see there the enemy as a rolling lion his road is a road of fear praise the lord he's trying to use everything that he can use in anything that he can use because the instant of the animal senses fear praise the lord it's strange enough because you will realize that there was no fear in eating adam plays with the lion the lion and the lamb and all of that but when may fall the first sense that breaks out among the animal was fear so an animal is always sensitive to fear if a dog can sense fear in you it will put up a defense it will never harm you unless it senses fear in you praise the lord if you realize and and get the feeling of a friend it will hang out with you as a friend i remember uh uh many years back that was that should be around 1995 uh uh uh there's a there's a friend of mine a preacher friend of mine the nomination preacher friend of mine he grew up in that part of the country where i was uh uh started preaching as a young man he told me in a story one time that part of the country is a mountainous area they do uh uh uh iron ore digging gold and diamond and all of that and uh and and and and we have we we had wildlifes so he was talking about being being a young man how he went up there with a missionary one time and and they went right into at the end of lions he says and the missionary told him boy don't fear right he says don't fear me praise the lord and he says they're lying up in the mountains just saw them and because the the missionary was in the front the lion never put up no defense no attack just shook his head turn around and just walk away sure praise the lord amen and because we were talking on the same subject you know uh fear we were actually talking about you know uh uh people being afraid of dog and and all of that and you know and all that so we that's what we were talking about and then he was sharing that story with me you know well that was that was in the mountains there in india so uh uh uh so we see here that uh the the enemy as a rolling lion when he rolls when satan rolls all he breathes out is fear amen all he breathes out he don't make you be afraid of a sickness or he make you be afraid of some kind of a financial condition or make you be afraid you know in in your mind are not you know not wondering what is going to happen here you know his his greatest weapon that he use is fear when he rose he rose out of fear but it's completely different from the modern angel that crowd like a rolling lion when he rolls his road is a protection praise the lord amen as we look in the world we will see that when the mighty angel rolled his road is a protection praise the lord because you will see the bible says that he had a little book in his hands and he set his right foot on the sea amen in his left foot on the lane am i right on the earth on the lane now if you go back to revelation 30 titan is 17 you will understand that there was a beast that came out of the sea praise the lord amen amen in the midst of the multitude of people and there was also a power that came out of the earth so now this might angel is possessing those two powers to protect john that is a type of the bride that is going to receive the little book amen so when the mighty angel cries stay in line it's a protection for the bride when the mighty angel cry come out of her my people it's a protection for the bride praise the lord he says it's just like when you see little junior going on the street he said julian praise the lord you are not scaring him to death you are yelling to protect him from the danger that runs on the road so when a mother in your cry is a protection but when the devil has a rolly lion cry he's spilling out fear he captured his people by fear by inserting fear in them that's how he rules his people god don't rule by fear god ruled by love praise the lord amen so we see there is one lion i want to capture your mind by fear religious fear and political fear and whatever fear he can use to be able to and when he cast that fear on you his his purpose is to destroy your confidence in the protection that god has provided amen the mighty angel is screaming to provide protection for you the devil is also streaming as a rolling line to create fear that you will not have confidence in the protection that is provided [Music] praise the lord oh you think about little letter david delivering alarm from the jaw of a lion praise the lord with only a slingshot why because he had confidence in almighty god that he was trained to use that slingshot to be able to protect the slingshot was not to make the lambs afraid it was their protection praise the lord all they have saw david swinging that thing many times and when david is swinging the slingshot they don't run away they run to him [Music] praise the lord because they know that he's using that to target the enemy they are not afraid of the word they are not afraid of of their god-given protection oh hallelujah this morning amen i've not even started preaching i'm just excited i'm just excited that that we have such a protection amen and what has been given to us as a protection the devil is coming in many forms a love form amen praise the lord amen to make us to be afraid of what is giving to us as a protection blessed be the name of the lord amen amen if we only realize that this word is given for our protection praise the lord this word is just like the bleeding lamps came that jehovah came down to wrap his children in sometimes it's not nice a bleeding skin is not nice amen a sting of blood will get all around you but that is the way god have to cover our shame without the sharing of blood there is no remission amen praise the lord so we see two crimes one of fear and one of protection praise the lord and the one of fear is to destroy us is to destroy our mind praise the lord as long as they can destroy the repetition of the messenger we can no longer have confidence in the message praise the lord my mind is growing in thousand different directions this morning but i realize i don't have thousand hours to preach so i have to tell my mind to be still and know that there is god praise the lord brother branson says this church was like that little line and there is this lion creeping out there's another caught there in paradox where he he actually bring the scene of two lions fighting over a prey who's look at that another time but what thinking about that i got into this thought of speaking on the battlecry this morning because i realized that uh i was also reading room i mean the numbers chapter 10 on on on on trumpets when moses was instructing the people about trumpets let's go to numbers chapter 10. we just pick up adversity and then if you if you have time and you are interested you can read the rest praise the lord amen praise the lord and also as you as you are listening to all the roles and all the noise what you need to descend is it a noise of protection or is it a noise to make me afraid praise the lord as you read all the things on youtube and facebook and everything it's all of these noise political noise is it a protection for me if it is not to protect me i don't want to listen to it i'm not going to get into drinking political bill when i don't have no divine protection from it praise the lord when you start to listen to doctrine noise a roar of different dot chain and this one and that one and all of that are you finding protection in there or is it creating fear in you are you becoming afraid that's what you have to discern in the noise that is around you i don't know what noise around you i don't know your noise i don't know i don't know the rolling that is going around you your life but what i want you to do this morning if there's nothing you take away from this service may god give you the spirit of discernment [Music] for you to discern whether it is fear or is protection if there is no sense of protection in it get away from it get away from it because it's going to consume you you're going to spend countless hours [Music] creating pressure for yourself that's right because you were talking in your head you were talking alone praise the lord every time people are talking about it you will jump in it and it's not creating no protection for you if you don't take anything away from the service this morning i pray that the lord remind you to discern the rulings around your life may he discern the ruling around your life praise the lord what will we read him numbers amen that's numbers chapter 10 verse 9. normal chapter 10 verse 9 if and if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you then ye shall blow on the lamb wave the trumpet you must blow on the lamb with the trumpet and ye shall be remember before the lord your god amen what makes the law to remember his people is the blowing of the trumpet you are going to war against the enemy that is oppressing you god don't remember you when you are afraid he don't remember you when you are crying and complaining he remember you when you blow the trumpet when you blow his promises and say you are the lord god that healed me of all my diseases that's when he remembered you it's not when you complain if you go to war in your lane what is your lane this body when you go to war in this land mine battles feeling of depression and whatever it is praise the lord let's not let's not let's move from kennel and come to your leg is this body when you go to a war with discouragement and criticism confusion then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpet and he shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved and ye shall be saved joshua and his men never had to shoot a boat of arrow they never had to use a swarm all they had to do was blow the trumpet and the wall of jericho came down because the trumpet was god instruction [Music] that was what god told them to do we have too much of ourselves in the game there is just too much of you in you [Music] oh you want to ask me who should be me god should be in you if you shall blow the trumpet then you will be remembered it's not when you are scared oh god help me no when you blow the trumpet you remind god of his promises if you can find a promise in god's word then blow that trumpet says then you will be remembered and i will come down and save you glory to god i heard our brother lauren is reading that psalm this morning uh praise he the lord and shout for joy and i was looking at that yesterday uh uh the time of david when it comes to to uh a joyful sound a shout for joy is actually out of a greek word praise the lord the people that don't like noise will not like this because it's it's out of a hebrew word uh [Music] it means the cracking or the tearing of the ears praise the lord amen turn the sound off turn the volume up let's blast this place [Laughter] praise the lord oh my goodness it means the cracking or the tearing of the ear the sound of joy praise the lord amen but you see this it's not vain emotion amen we can get loud and turn the volume up and it's just all vain emotion [Music] praise the lord but what makes the people to shout is when god was in the camp when god was identified in a camp you could not control the emotion of the people amen praise the lord i realize i just have a few minutes left can i preach my message now amen glory be to god now there is something that you will realize if you go back and study the message recognizing your day in this message what when brother branham entitled that message when he entitled it sometimes you you have to pray and god help you to understand even the title that's right amen he said this he said this he said everywhere now there is no revival everybody complaining ministers crying i was reading one of the outstanding paper that comes here to the church a very fine paper and i know the editor and i know the people and they are godly people very fine brother and sister moe as a jack maud a shreveport at the time the heritage is coming one of the finest people on the field he says but the harley we praying anything unless it's about fast and pray fast and pray sound the trumpet now listen to this now listening to this listen to this if you if the lord will give us grace to be able to understand and and and just and just grab him he says nothing they will say but fast and pray fast and pray sound the trumpet you know uh uh we we must be on fire for god we must be on fire for god you know there is no revival the church is dead we need to rise again you know and and all of that follow now let's learn praise the lord how many read it you know you see it all the time fast and pray fast and pray that's all you hear fast and pray we are going to have a great breaking of the day that's a great thing is going to happen there's a that's a that's a national revival coming all of you people prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed amen we are not too lit yet why why do they do that why did they do that they want a great awakening praise the lord amen they want a great awakening what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride praise the lord amen this is 1964 the seals were just open 1963 in june they have not recognized the awakening of the bride see by being christian listen to this now by being christian they feel the pull of the hour that's right the reason why you are feeling it is because something has happened you will not have a thirst of god a desire if nothing is happening if god is not moving you will not have a desire you are having a desire because there's a move of god but you have not recognized where that move is you have not identified it amen so because you have not identified it you're trying to create it [Music] you think now you have a desire to make it happy i've already happy it have already happened a principle that brother branham taught us in uh uh uh countdown and that principle as much as we have heard over and over our human reasoning has not sink in right praise the lord amen himalayan we always have the picture of saddam and what he taught is whenever god has achieved anything god has already achieved it he said before science we have the remnant as a benefit so if science is making any kind of a move which means god has already achieved something spiritual in his church [Music] praise the lord if science have achieved to give us siri love it praise the lord it's science i've achieved but everyone will unplug this your thing to give us siri siri where is walmart syria warmer the nearest war man praise the lord i don't know if i'm saying the right praise the lord and we feel fascinated our life is geared into that our life is geared we don't go and look for the telephone book anymore we don't go on you just take your phone and just talk to it why because god has already released in his church a spoken word power that is already in his church not to come it's already here [Music] it's just that we have not entered into it we enjoy the ones signs have given to us and don't have no idea that god has already given it to us it's never called a 40-day fast praise the lord is never taking the church back to pentecost science will never be able to achieve what they are achieving what they are giving you and myself and we are so fascinated about it science will not be able to achieve it if almighty god has not achieved it not that he will achieve it most of the time we turn the picture around and think that science is doing this so the church would no no that's the wrong picture in god's mind his church has already achieved it whether you can see it or not what are you believing on that it don't change god he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] praise the lord it's fear that is keeping you you are listening to the rolling of fear [Music] and you are afraid to exercise that right you are you are afraid to exercise what god has already given you but yet you take so much comfort oh you know that new app there's a new app we're always about a new app there's a new app wow apple has put a new app it's just a it's a rim it's a waste product [Music] it's a waste product what god has already achieved praise the lord when the church is supposed to be standing and just like you are speaking to siri you need to be speaking to the devil just like you are speaking to siri you need to be speaking to the devil and speaking to your body this contrary desire of mind i speak to you you got to come in obedience [Applause] praise the lord what we have used out of this why we have used what god has given to us instead of going forward we are going in reverse we are going in reverse we are all about second pudding first pulled praise aloha want some kind of a sensation before we believe that god is with us we are always looking for some kind of ethnic vindication some kind of earthly dedication when all god wants is you to take him at his word take him at his word bro because that's why they did not recognize they did not recognize their awakening of the bride and what wants to wake her up those mysteries healing under the seals when a mighty angel rule like a lion seven thunders out of your voices praise the lord amen seven thunders alter their voices thank you bernie i mean the deacons all both of them have three letter names i'm always making them turning them outside praise the lord little samuel got me in that confusion every brother is brother ben ben how are you brother ben uh what are we talking about since are you seeing the picture amen if you want quotes i can read thousands of quotes to you but they will do you no good if they don't wake you up to the reality if they don't wake you up just like the trumpet gideon said when you hear when the trumpet is blown the message in the trumpet will be the sword of the lord and the sword of gideon so he's interpreting the unknown tones that the trumpet will blow he's interpreting the message that is in the tundras because when the trumpet blows a blast in the ears of the people but he said the message honored that sound is the sword of the law and the sword of gideon amen praise the lord so it is time to draw out your sword buddy because it's going to be bloody amen spirits are going to be flying amen so what is brother burnham identifying here there is there is a there is a thunder there is there is a trumpet that is sounding in the heart of the people they're having a desire for something a sounding in your heart praise the lord but the message of what they're supposed to be hearing has already been given but they are looking for it to come so what is happening now the devil is profiting on that to put him in a confusion he says the church has backslidded because if if the church was on fire we will be having miracles that will be fasting and praying there will be a revival the revival has already come in the opening of the word they came already praise the lord [Music] are you seeing the picture when the deep call it to the deed you will not have a desire unless there is a god to grant a desire but what happiness there when there is a desire when there is an osh we keep looking to the future we put it to the future praise the lord amen god has always done that he says moses sin in iraq and wait for me and i'm going to pass he passed before moses saw him amen it already happened before you realize it amen when you having a feeling is because it has already happened because the message to zara babel it will not be by power it will not be by might it will be by the spirit of the lord most of the time we we we get our mind in this place because we are looking for self-glorification we want to show what we have done right i fasted 10 days i fasted 20 days you know i read the horse hill praise the lord and after you finish you come out dry because you are not identifying what god is doing you are not identifying what he's doing in your life amen amen praise the lord we are allowing the enemy to magnify the weakness of our body magnify the thoughts that is in our mind that the promises of god in our heart is not sounding it's not sounding that's what he's trying to point out to these people every word people are saying let's pray let's just say he said what they are not recognizing is that there has been an awakening matthew chapter 25 when jesus talked about the the the wise and the foolish virgin there was a battle cry that went out called the midnight cry praise the lord amen when the crowd went out the ones that identify it took the alarm and were going forward the one that they're not identified started to look for oil and they were going back that's right when the crowd went forth the ones that identify it the hot oil in the alarm the ones that were in the revival that were looking in the promise of god that was identifying the word of god for their age the message of the hour that was identifying what god is doing in their life they took the alarm turn it on yes and it starts to go forward the bunch of religious ones that want to pentecost we got to be shouting they're looking for oil oh we got to go back to fasting we got to go back today in the midst of that they get lost because they never got the oil [Music] always going back that is using the rear view mirror you are driving into a crotch you should only use it to see how far you are away from the devil and when you realize you are far just press on our accelerator and get more father [Music] oh okay oh you gotta cruise are we together musicians who can come we trust the lord and sound about to cry amen we will trust the lord and sound about to cry brother branham said this in a test seal he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet he says there's been no revival no manifestation to stare up the bride yet he says and we are looking for it [Music] it will take those seven unknown tongues it would take those seven unknown thunders [Music] praise the lord just like i said when you hear the ruling praise the lord [Music] all you need to do is to discern whether it is fear [Music] or whether it is protection [Music] praise the lord [Music] because gideon told the people when you hear the trumpet the message of the trumpet is the swore of gideon and the sword of the lord praise the lord he says he will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake up to wake her up again and that's what the battle cry supposed to do the battle cry supposed to wake you up it's supposed to wake you up [Music] the battle cry supposed to wake you up it's supposed to inspire you the battlecry is supposed to encourage you you're supposed to leave church determined to serve god better than you did yesterday [Music] when you hear that by the cry what are you reading your bible are you listening to a message [Music] if you are if you are discerning if you are discerning protection from what you are hearing it will inspire you it will inspire you when goliath got out there and he was making his boast when he yelled all the army everybody is hiding in their caves david was listening to the scene yelling and what he was hearing is that an uncircumcised philistine defying the almighty god while they were running away david was going to the battle every time goliath yelled what david was hearing how can a man defy his creator a man that is now honored the covenant of abraham how can he defy the god of abraham isaac and jacob [Music] all those guys david come back praise the lord [Music] the noise that was taking place what he was discerning well there was an uncircumcised philistine that was deferring the almighty god [Music] praise the lord and david says i will take the challenge because i'm not hearing i'm not hearing fear there is nothing in this message that make me afraid what i'm hearing is gingering me because i'm seeing protection i'm seeing an injured incoming about me because i see an uncircumcised philistine trying to challenge the almighty god praise the lord how can you make depression greater than your god how can you make discouragement how many times you find in god's word where he said be discouraged you always say be courageous [Music] i don't know what you're listening to all the sounds around you i don't know what you are listening to i don't know what is creating fear it has created so much fear in you that you don't have courage to go to church because you don't know what to expect preachers have sounded the wrong trumpet instead of putting the people in their promises instead of telling the people and showing them what god has already given to this bride ready for a rapture praise the lord are we going to bring brother branham back from the grave to get us ready god wouldn't have taken his messenger if his work was not done the seals are open the mystery i revealed and he said my message will dress this bride there is not another man there is not another ministry to get us ready we have to bring you back to the promises we have to tell you what the messenger has said [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus when the trumpet of the lord shall [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is is [Music] yes oh [Music] is [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] is oh yes is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord glory be to god hallelujah we have a young brother that will be baptized right after this service and just looking in the message humbled ourselves brother branham was talking some of the last messages he preached but in that message uh [Music] no actually it's in the message things that has to be [Music] he was talking and talking about talking to the parents talking to the grandparents he said you keep praying for your loved ones claiming them he says it might not happen in your lifetime you might be behind the curtain of time when god brings to pass the answer to your prayer [Music] and the young man that will be baptized is the grand son of sister mimi that left us yearly [Music] and what an answer to ceaseless praying and crying [Music] young caught up in the case of this life influence of friends and peers drugs praising and all of that [Music] but the god of creation that god that year prayers there is now one prayer the book of malachi says he take your prayers and put it in the bottle of remembrance he said before him all the time your prayers your tears god gather them and sister mimi is not here this morning brother john bibi this year that his dear wife and our sister sister geraldine daniel wanted to be baptized last week i just felt in my heart i must talk to his mother our sister she's been trusting the grace of god raising her children on her own the best that she knows by the word of god and i just fear that it will be an honorable thing an encouragement to her faith to see her son being baptized let's buy our house together and i want to say this this afternoon as we close this service just to remind you [Music] there are a lot of things that might be sounding around your life i don't know what it is there's a lot of rolling that might be going on you have to realize that the enemy is like a rolling lion and the mighty angel also cried as a lion but what is important this morning we want to establish in your heart that one is rolling to create fear in your heart to destroy your confidence in god's protection one is rolling making you to see all the negative things all the ugly things all the things that is not good in your home in your life and his purpose is to destroy your confidence in the provision that god has given to you oh can we ask the law for the spirit of discernment and say oh god happen to discern lord let me not just be caught up in the confusion and in the trials and in the trouble but let me be able to discern whether it is here or it is
