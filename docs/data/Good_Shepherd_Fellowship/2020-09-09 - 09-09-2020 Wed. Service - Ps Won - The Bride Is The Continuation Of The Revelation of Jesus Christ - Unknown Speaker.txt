blessing amen praise the lord amen you know you're getting you're getting god's presence all you want is just for him to show up amen praise the lord then you forget about all your needs and when he show up you forget about all your needs and your worries amen praise the lord we want to thank the law for for giving us such a wonderful time and uh yesterday i called brother joe fiasco we did in wisconsin just to find out about our sister i wanted some update to bring to the church today and then that was when i heard that sister mary we prayed for saturday night i went to be with the lord and so just in that conversation i learned that brother paula fountain was around so uh after one and brother steve we drove to wisconsin last night i mean we had a good time together and just for we said an hour our 10-minute service we drove four hours amen but we had a good time a good time of fellowship together praise the lord you know the lord does those things he lock you up in the room and then you can just spend time together amen until he brings the key just like lacking noah and those animals in the act it was god that shut the door noah didn't have the key so he had a way for god to open the door praise the lord amen but i want to say something tonight i think the lord gave us a special blessing on on saturday amen uh uh we will just for the scripture reading we will go back and read uh uh revelation chapter one uh that was that was the the subject that was where the holy spirit there with us on the weekend and i believe it was a blessing i believe it was a blessing and you know when you have a you have a visitor he comes and then he preach and he goes and then sometimes he leaves a lot of work for the preacher to do amen not in a bar since in a good sense because he have he has stirred the water and now sometimes we are just like that man in the book of saint john nobody to push me so i'm here to put you in that water tonight amen praise the lord i think that's what the lord hired me for just to push you so you can get pick up your bag and walk amen so i believe that the injured of the lord walked upon that scripture for us on uh uh um i was telling brother flynn we i mean uh brother prata we were talking about it i said i have that scripture in my mind and some of the brothers will remember i sent them a text and i was hoping that we would do a brother's bible study on revelation chapter 1 verse 1. praise the lord amen the lord bless you uh uh let your stand just to fulfill that reverence to the word and revelation chapter 1 verse 1 maybe tonight we can we can tie to this the continuation of the revelation of jesus christ amen the continuation of the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him this hymn is not john god gave a revelation the revelation of jesus christ god gave it to him jesus christ god gave it to him are we together this the hymn is not john john is coming later the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him think about that and you and myself are the continuation of that revelation that god gave to him praise the lord the revelation of jesus christ the whole bible brother branham said christ is the mystery of god revealed jesus is the principal team of the bible the whole bible is the revelation of jesus christ but see how the last book in the bible summed the whole thing up the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show unto his servants so all through the ages he's been showing it to moses he's been showing it to jeremiah he's been showing it to isaiah to show it on to his servants things which must shortly come to pass things which must shortly come to pass like brother branham said those things that were revealed to the to the to the prophets of all was going to be a fulfillment in our age we are fulfilling those things so this thing that we are fulfilling god revealed it a little year as i have said a little dare precept must be upon prison but it was the revelation of jesus christ that's the reason why if you miss jesus christ you missed the entire picture of god but branham says if you read the bible and you don't see jesus christ close the bible pray and read it again the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass his sin and signify it by his angel until his seventh john and then you have to realize the bride of the seven church ages john is a type of that bride so all the things that he showed to his servants he signify by his anger there is an angel that is going to reveal this thing to john are we together let's buy our heads and pray and we will read that verse again heavenly father lord jesus we pray tonight there is one prayer need lord father gathered you're just reminding me of pray for our dear sister sister christian but andrews and his wife father lord garden we ask that grace lord we help her daddy lord father god and we we just pray that lord you will you will strengthen our brother o god you will bless his wife as well as he as she stand with him o god father we just thank you because healing is the children's bread oh god we pray tonight precious lord now take this portion of your word father you minister to us on this on the weekend oh god and and lord i was just saying father let the people grab it lord capture us lord now we must get it but let the world get a hold of us oh father because that's when lord jesus we can be able to see the impact now bless us now as we pray together in jesus name amen the lord bless you have your seed revelation chapter one verse one again let's read that i want to i want to read this i want to read this so i i i mean you you can be you can be walking and you'll be hearing a sounding in your head amen the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him praise the lord the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him now this this subject uh uh i've been studying on it for a little bit and i've been i've been looking for a way to bring it uh to be able to to grab your attention the reason why when you read this the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him you will see many places in the scripture where where paul said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ praise the lord amen now before we we establish this thought and traveled a little bit for the few minutes that we have before us let's read this together uh we asked our sister to help us back there and question and answer in genesis i just i have many quotes i just took few of them to just two of them to share with you tonight and praise the lord now see what brother branham said he says here's the message we have here the message what we call the message we are in the message but ramsay here's the message every time we see that word message it catch our attention because that's how we call the that's how we call our move that's how we call the move of god in this day the message now he says here's the message we have here jesus was jehovah in veil in flesh come down in veil now god father son and holy ghost is not like your finger one god is one is not like your one finger now because of uh of uh of a church-ish teaching that did not lean to trinity but leaned to to uh uh they call it the jesus name movement which came out of the pentecostal church the oneness group of people that teach that that god is one you know jesus said i am a father i want many times many times even in our rank the message many people goes with that concept and thinks that god is one just like our finger brother branham says no because if god is one just like our finger we will have problem with revelation chapter one verse one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him praise the lord you know what i want to do tonight i want you to go home and don't have a good sleep for you to just think about this amen he says father son and holy ghost is not like your finger one like some people think it is the whole thing just like no goddess i just unfold it for you a while ago see there's there's there's a trinity in the one praise the lord he says i'm a trinity in one um soul body spirit one person is that right made up of cells blood and nails and yet one being and everything you look at is in a trinity like i said before trinity the roman church make it a doctrine to put us into idolatry but like brother branham says god works by trinity he did everything free we get our soul bodies and spirit that's trinity trinity is not god to us trinity is us to god justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost so trinity is not for god trinity is for us that's the way that god worked with us for us to understand his greatness are we together when when the roman church make a doctrine it became the the the the four unclean beasts the unclean beasts the frogs in the book of revelation that's when it's a doctrine it's an unclean spirit to think that god is three person in one that is an unclean spirit are we together but god that same god he worked in the fatherhood he came down and took on flesh and he's dwelling upon us by his holy spirit praise the lord inhabiting our hearts each and every one of us the half is spirit tonight and if you don't have it you can get it you will not take nothing out of god he says everything you look at is in trinity and a trinity in one there was a trinity in the ark the bottom floor the creeping things which is the second floor of the fires flying air in the tear flow of of noah and his family that was a trinity the tabernacle the altar called the inner court the holiness of holy that was a trinity are we together in the way that god deals with us to be able to understand his greatness but it does not have anything to describe god we don't have to break him into three to understand him but he had to deal with us this way justification sanctification baptising of the holy ghost altar called inner call holiness of holy are we together now if you don't sleep good tonight call me in the morning amen we can talk it over again he says the tabernacle there was a congregation the holy place the holiness of holy now there's been three dispensation the fatherhood the sonship the holy ghost dispensation see what i mean our god he says he says we don't say our gods that's hidden and the jews know that and when you can make it to him that jesus is god jehovah god not a second person or a terror person it is the same person all the time making himself manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever are we together praise the lord the same person making himself manifest let's take the another one in hebrew chapter four then we can be able to to to go back to revelation chapter one and and be able to see a picture there if the lord help us we might continue maybe on sunday i don't know what he would do here for us but revelation chapter 4 i mean hebrew chapter 4 series 19 57 god is not three person if he's three gods then we are hiddens amen which one is god they are all they are all three one god is three offices of the same god he was the father in the form of the holy spirit in that pillow of fire in the wilderness he was the son when he used the sonship office a little while in the world series normal i go away and i will come again and be with you even in you to the end of the world see he's the father who the sonship the holy ghost too is all the very same god working in three different offices are we together father who son shaped holy ghost never uh first john 5 7 said there are three that bear record in heaven the father the son and the holy ghost these three are one not in one but they are one are we together thomas said unto him lord show us the father it was suffice it uh it would satisfy us he said have i been with you so long have i been so long with you and you don't know me said when you when you see me when you see me you have seen the father praise the lord not not his physical being when you see me see means to understand when you see me you have seen the father praise the lord amen i have been with you all this while doing all of these things i can do nothing except the father revealed it to me he was trying to bring them that revelation that is the father that is using this vessel so if you see me if you see me if you grab it if you understand it not seeing with the literal eyes but seeing with the spirit man if you see me you have seen the father are we together praise the lord because we can we can say the same thing today as the bride of jesus christ if you see me if you understand what god is doing in our age you have seen the father it's not our physical body it's not the the physical being of of william branham no if you understood what god was doing in the discernment if you understood what god was doing when those messages was coming then you would see the father but but the human senses can only stop to the flesh that's what when the people say you see me jesus said when you see me you see the father they talk about his flesh and now that was not what jesus was referring to let's go on a little bit here he says you see me you have seen the father you see why show us the father now the one that stuck it the ones group of people they try to make father son and the holy ghost just one office one place and like your finger one that's wrong praise the lord can we say that's wrong tonight if that's the way you understand it that's wrong god he said jesus could not ban his own father if he was then he was well how how could he be being his own father and if god is a man separated from the holy ghost he had two fathers for the bible said that the holy ghost overshadowed mary and she conceived are we together does it looks like i have got you into a trap tonight the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show unto his servants that's what brother branham said it was christ in moses it was christ in david to show unto his seven things that must shortly come to pass when that revelation start manifesting it will be in a short span of time that is called seven church ages that's when that revelation of all the things that were happening through the age will stop becoming real it will be in that short space of short span of time called the seven church ages and he's signified by his angel unto his seven john now john represent the bride that anger that he signified it told is the one that opened the mysteries it's the one that opened the ministry and is bringing us this understanding that god is father son and holy ghost are one but not as one as your finger one or just by the man standing one no it's a manifestation it's a mystery are we together now we go back to revelation chapter one and then oh let's go back to genesis chapter 1 genesis chapter 1 verse 1. let's take genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth that's what the bible starts with amen it's in john chapter 1 verse one lady with other one verse one tonight amen genesis tells us in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth saint john chapter 1 verse 1 tells us praise the lord in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god praise the lord are we together verse 2 the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him but genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning god created all things saint john now is telling us no it was the word that created all things are we together that's word that's where your true identity is hid if god can can can can can help you to see yourself in this revelation of jesus christ the devil is no match to you amen because you can you can you can speak to the devil just like jesus said before abraham was i am you can tell him because it all goes back to the beginning genesis once said in the beginning god created heaven and the earth since john is telling us here no in the beginning was the word the word was was with god and the word was god a word is taught express so that thought came from a being that genesis 1 talks about amen and when it was expressed it was expressed it came out in some other places he gave birth to the son it came out of him because this is the invisible god let's go to collusion chapter 1. i know this is a prayer meeting tonight okay i have a few minutes here before we close and let's go to collusion let's uh whoo are we together amen you see that's that is the reason why god had to send a prophet that's why he had to send a prophet because if god did not send a prophet we will be running around just like the rest of the pentecostal people trying to make jesus one with god like one and i've seen some brothers that argue about it and they are so adamant about it jesus was god he was he was yeah he was god but you have to see how that mystery unfold that's why paul said great is the mystery of godliness he said it's so great and that mystery of godliness is fulfilled in is fulfilling in you that's why god call us as a bride when you understand that it brings you to the place where you appreciate the message it brings you to the place where you just don't you don't give yourself to things that you may not give yourself to because god calls you he's separating you from the word so you can be a continuation of that mystery that mystery of godliness there is a mystery of godliness that is fulfilling there is a mystery of iniquity that is fulfilling that's where the word is you are either part of one or the other you cannot be neutral it's either the mystery of godliness that is fulfilling in your life that is pulling you closer to god all is the mystery of iniquity and the mystery of iniquity is very religious it's very religious because what is iniquity knowing the right thing but don't have any power to live it out you can cut the scripture you can cut the message but you don't have the power are we together where were we reading from just now collusion let's let's read from there praise the lord that's what happened when you bring a visiting preacher he just take the lead and smoke all over the place oh man i was just having a good time this weekend i said my my my my dear lord what a what a blessing for the people to know the revelation of jesus christ is not it's not a subject for for a head knowledge is a revelation that i want to live through you jesus said in that day which day this day brother branham said christ is the minister of god revealed he said this day thy ministry will be made known you will know that i am in the father the father in me are in you and you in me that is the mystery christ is the mystery of god reveal the hope of glory is is that mystery okay let's let's just read here tonight and then [Music] verse 12. let's read from verse 12 give thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness you see he has made us to be partaker of light because he had delivered us from darkness for you to fully move into light you got to be delivered from darkness let me not start something here and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin whoa who is the wu his dear son who is the image of the invisible god he is the image when god said let's make man in our image praise the lord it was the one to make god known that's what the image is it's not the image like other statues we found breaking down around you know this image is to make known god wants to make himself known but he's an invisible god so the image of the invisible god how we are we together and because it's an image of the invisible god so the invisible god comes down in that image because it's not a dare monument it's a living moon man who is the image of the invisible god listen let's let's read on a little bit yeah we'll find a place to close the first bone of every creature he's the image of the invisible god he is the first bone of every creature the first bone of every creature that explains revelation chapter one because when god when brother branham says when god created the logos the invisible god he was intent of spirit he's so great so what he did was he created the logos that is called the sun in the beginning was the word so he condemns himself into a body of light so in there he put the revelation that god gave to him from the beginning when the first born of every creature to display that revelation i can take all the time and explain it to you but i want to tell i just want to catch you catch your mind yet tonight the first born of every creature followed by him where all things created it confirms in john chapter one that we just read for by him all things were created by what the word the lugus that thing that came out of god that thing that came out of the great internal spirit it created all things so you see when when when when the when the church word talks about jesus that goes back as far as two thousand years ago and go right into nazareth and galilee that's where they stopped but when you talk about jesus you go right back to the beginning because you know it was a representation in the logos that was the sun that was the first bone of every creature anything that was created the first thing that god made was to condense himself into a body of light the logos are we together and the the thing about it there is that every child of god was represented in the every son of god was your true representation was in that logo because it was the father traveling with his thoughts his attributes praise the lord oh that's the reason why we can kick the devil in the nose because we can tell him we were there when he was created we were in the logos we were there the revelation of jesus christ oh don't miss it tonight don't make it a doctrine you should be that revelation because that's what god is intending to get a people what he can reveal himself through who is the very image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature by him all things were created that are in the heaven and that and that are in earth visible invisible whether they are thrones or they are dominion or they are principality or power all things were created by him and for him this is very very powerful and he is before all things him and by him all things consist all things were created by him and for him praise the lord when god allows sin it was not it was because of him he allows sin because of him because in him was an attribute to be a savior so all things were created for him praise the lord amen when god allows sickness it is not for you it's for him he allow it for him because in him it's an attribute to be a healer all things were created by him and for him praise the lord you know i would turn the picture around when you when you are worshiping god let me tell you when you are worshiping god it's not for god it's for you you know why because whether you worship god or not it don't reduce him it don't take nothing from god so you worshipping god is for your own benefit you obeying god's word if you don't obey god's word god remain god he would never change he's never disappointed so it's for your own benefit if you don't pray god will not cry but what will happen you will cry because you will be exposing yourself to demons that will be tormenting you we think that when we come to church we're doing god a favor praise the lord living right you're not doing god a favor you're doing yourself a favor because you are you you are just you are yelling you are surrounding your will to god and say god use it it's just like peter giving his boat to jesus to go and preach and at the end of the day he got the benefit because he got a catch that he couldn't even draw the net the sins of all the prophets they grabbed that thing that's the reason why those men committed their life unto death when it came to the things of god they couldn't play with it because they knew the benefit they committed their life to it those men will give their substance to the things of god they promote the kingdom because there was a revelation this loves this church we feel like we're doing god a favor praise the lord we get angry with god praise the lord i mean we have reduced god down to material things that's what this age has reduced reduced god down to oh one of these days i'll speak on the attributes of god all things were created by him and for him that's the reason why he can do with it whatever pleases him hallelujah amen praise the lord the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him to show unto his servants things that must shortly come to pass he has signified by his anger not angels by angel unto john we are a blessed people amen we are not fully understand what what what what we are surrounded by what what what we are caught up into we think that we are becoming a church member no it's not not not a church member from the time i started understanding this church member making people church member i don't crave for it and i don't pray for it because forcing the person to be a church member and they don't they don't grab the revelation i mean they're going to frustrate you didn't say will be frustrated and you will not go anywhere oh wow i didn't see you in church today oh why we passed that time people we passed our time praise the lord we passed our time oh you must pay your time oh that we passed that because everything we do represent christ your revelation of christ when you are singing your revelation of christ makes you excited you want to jump out of your seat and somebody there because their revelation not even gets trained to move their hands some other person direct call glory to god oh what happened they have not seen it praise the lord in your services even in your finance your revelation makes you to do the things that you do in your finance your revelation of jesus christ that's why the church of the living god we don't pull for money when the people grab it they will commit themselves to it that's the revelation of jesus christ that god gave unto him and he had pulled you into it to be part of that unfolding unfolding unfolding is that beautiful oh it's so beautiful amen praise the lord musicians you can come tonight praise the lord amen it's so beautiful i mean i can go on tonight and just keep you here and i mean when that when that anointing drop and that revelation comes you will not even feel hungry you will not feel sleepy but as now you get out of it you will just be so tired you'll be useless i mean you're not feeling sleepy you're not feeling all glory to god hallelujah before you realize it's 2 am in the morning oh jesus oh jesus you love the lord tonight are you glad that you're part of this revelation of jesus christ it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing when you understand it it's a beautiful thing you don't leave it all in a man in in in on calvary you don't leave it there it came out of that man paul had a bit of the revelation of jesus christ peter had a bit of it that is the reason why in our age we can leave it all in brother branham it has to come into the bride because that's the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord god would take a man a messenger in the age in in in and raise him up with a ministry with a life but i've seen god will break that same thing down to to different measure that he can give to the housewife he can give to the student on campus amen he can give to the young people i mean when young people grab this revelation of jesus christ it makes them so responsible because they don't spend their time in foolishness because we know that everything we are doing we are revealing christ we must be revealing christ our work revealing christ at school don't make don't make christ a failure because he never failed that's the reason why as a student you must steady that's why the scripture says stead is to show yourself a proof because you are revealing christ you can brag on jesus christ and be a failure in your lesson don't make god to respect the i mean make the people to respect the god you are confessing the revelation of jesus christ that god gave unto him he has given it unto us too amen verb say oh that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church you know there are two beautiful scriptures i'm i'm hoping to make a picture i'll leave you right here tonight amen because i don't want to start something amen that's just our house together amen
