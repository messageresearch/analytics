[47:14] other than to monitor it. Uh they did go
[47:17] ahead and clear him to uh to see a GR
[47:21] doctor and uh uh and do some other test.

[52:02] brother but moreover moreover I was I I
[52:06] took an interest in uh knowing our
[52:09] brother because he just took over the
[52:13] other assembly when their pastor went to
[52:16] be with the Lord and uh uh I mean uh
[52:20] it's is it's a big church. So uh uh I
[52:25] took I took interest uh you know to get
[52:27] to know the brother and uh because
[52:33] uh you know there's there's a whole lot
[52:35] that goes into into the work of the Lord
[52:40] you know uh that uh a man will feel
[52:44] confident uh to know that he have a son
[52:47] that he can be able to entrust what he's
[52:50] doing and our brother is doing a lot of
[52:52] work there in Mosmbique. Uh it's a kind
[52:55] of a Portuguese area and they having an
[52:58] outreach going out there and all of that
[53:01] and and and I'm fond of that. I'm not on
[53:03] the fear anymore, but I'm fond of
[53:05] mission work. I love mission work.
[53:08] Praise the Lord. But before we have him
[53:09] come, I will ask uh brother Augustus to
[53:13] come. Come, brother. Come and greet us.
[53:15] And uh he's actually a pastor from
[53:18] Seleon. He's uh visiting the country.
[53:21] his uh brother lives right in the
[53:23] apartment here. So uh uh instead of uh
[53:27] just flipping the television, he choose
[53:29] to come to church.
[53:31] So and uh so we we want to honor him.

[53:46] Hallelujah.
[53:48] Good morning.
[53:50] I'm privileged to be among these
[53:53] wonderful
[53:54] people. Really there is no difference
[53:56] between my home and your home that I'm
[53:59] talking about the church and being since
[54:03] we are all brothers and sisters in the
[54:05] Lord.
[54:06] The Lord directed me here
[54:09] and for the first two Sundays I was
[54:12] between us
[54:13] chapel but to be true I was not
[54:16] home but when I came the very first
[54:19] Sunday I saw myself home
[54:23] and that's the reason why I'm very much
[54:25] familiar with model songs that you are
[54:28] singing and that's the way we do things
[54:30] home and so is the Lord's doing and it
[54:34] is marvelous in his sight
[54:37] And so I greet you
[54:39] all. My wife though she's not here. I
[54:43] told her about you people and she
[54:46] extends her greetings to you all. I have
[54:48] a very beautiful wife.
[54:53] Yeah. With four daughters and then one
[54:57] boy. In Africa we give birth to many
[55:00] children. That's how we
[55:02] are. I say a man is known in his
[55:05] community by the amount of children he
[55:08] has. So people fear you but if you don't
[55:11] have I pray that those that don't that
[55:14] haven't that God will bless them with
[55:16] children because children inherited from
[55:18] the Lord and it's a blessing. So once
[55:20] again I thank you all for receiving me
[55:23] and for giving me this opportunity to
[55:25] greet you this morning. God bless you
[55:26] all.
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:35] Praise the Lord. And uh uh we I told you
[55:40] I was here one time in a week and then I
[55:43] was I was I just got down on my knees to
[55:46] pray in the office and I heard the door
[55:48] banging. Said, "What's that again?" So I
[55:51] was trying to just set my mind. I'm
[55:54] trying to get some things off my mind
[55:56] and just prayed and but I heard they
[55:58] insisting at the door. So I said, "Let
[56:00] me get there and see." When I I pass
[56:02] through my window, I saw him, he and his
[56:04] brother. So I said, "Okay." I just
[56:06] opened the door and he, you know, just
[56:08] wanted to let me know. Uhhuh. He saw the
[56:11] place a church and he will be here on
[56:13] Sunday for service. So I said, "Okay."
[56:15] And then after the service, we we had to
[56:17] visit a little bit in the office. And
[56:20] and uh then I knew that he was a student
[56:23] of the word. Amen. Yeah. Because a
[56:26] student of the word will always uh one
[56:28] they will appreciate the word and the
[56:31] second thing there is they are the they
[56:32] will address you by the word.
[56:37] We had a little talk around the word. I
[56:39] knew I said well okay I think uh he's a
[56:42] student of the word. And so when you are
[56:44] preaching to a student of the word you
[56:46] got to be careful. You just don't you
[56:48] know don't bring bird out of the heart.
[56:51] You know we want to see the egg before
[56:54] we can see the bird. You know don't just
[56:56] bring us bird out of the heart. So
[56:58] praise the Lord. And so it's it's just
[57:01] good to have our brother with us. Amen.
[57:04] And uh uh it's good. It's good when you
[57:08] when you see people that love the Lord.
[57:10] And
[57:11] uh will will come and take the time to
[57:15] to it's is it's uh you know it's one of
[57:18] those things that is difficult you know
[57:20] to just submit yourself to another
[57:23] authority. But you know in the scripture
[57:26] we saw a parting of the end uh when that
[57:29] uh uh centurion met Jesus he said you
[57:33] are a man of authority just like I am
[57:36] just speak the word. Amen. So authority
[57:39] recognize authority. So we thank the
[57:42] Lord for that. Let's stand on our feet.
[57:43] We'll sing the song and then brother
[57:46] Moses will come and bring us this
[57:49] morning and praise the Lord.
[58:04] [Music]

[1:04:15] man of God,
[1:04:18] um brother
[1:04:20] War.
[1:04:22] Um, we've been talking for some time and
[1:04:28] um I take it as a great privilege and
[1:04:31] honor to stand before you today and uh
[1:04:35] we've had fellowship
[1:04:38] uh
[1:04:40] is

[1:05:02] wife. Um
[1:05:06] um and I also talk with um brother Elton
[1:05:10] White, the pastor of Eco's Outreach
[1:05:12] Ministries in Virginia.
[1:05:15] and he also send his
[1:05:17] regards.
[1:05:19] Amen. Uh I would like us to read the
[1:05:23] Bible and pray before we sit
[1:05:26] down. So let's
[1:05:31] um let's read two
[1:05:35] scriptures. Let's start
[1:05:40] with
[1:05:42] Ecclesiastes.
[1:05:43] Ecclesiastes
[1:05:47] 7. Ecclesiastes 7 verse
[1:05:54] 8.
[1:05:56] Um, and then we are also going to read
[1:05:59] the book of Joel and then we'll pray and
[1:06:02] sit down. Ecclesiastes 7 verse 8. The
[1:06:06] Bible
[1:06:07] says,
[1:06:10] "Better is the end of a
[1:06:15] thing than the beginning
[1:06:19] thereof." Uh, and the patient in spirit
[1:06:22] is better than the proud in spirit.
[1:06:29] So better is the end of a thing than the
[1:06:32] beginning of it.
[1:06:35] Um and then
[1:06:39] um I would also want to read the book of
[1:06:42] Joel. Joel chapter
[1:06:44] 1 verse 4. That which the palmer worm
[1:06:48] hath left has the locust eaten. And that
[1:06:52] which the locust have left as the coner
[1:06:56] worm eaten. and that which the conqueror
[1:06:59] worm has
[1:07:00] left at the
[1:07:02] caterpillar
[1:07:05] eaten. We will skip to chapter 2 verse
[1:07:09] 25. Chapter 2 verse
[1:07:12] 25. and I will restore to you the
[1:07:18] years that the locust hath eaten, the
[1:07:21] conquer worm, the caterpillar, the
[1:07:24] palmer worm, the great army which I sent
[1:07:28] among
[1:07:30] you. And so God is is giving a promise
[1:07:34] of restoration and he says, I will
[1:07:36] restore the years.
[1:07:40] Uh verse 26, and you shall eat in plenty
[1:07:45] and be

[1:08:17] be sufficient to wash away all our sins,

[1:09:18] you and that which can build edify and
[1:09:22] correct and put us in the right place. I
[1:09:25] pray asking for all these blessings in
[1:09:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our
[1:09:29] Lord and Savior.
[1:09:32] Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be
[1:09:34] seated. Uh so I just want to speak on a
[1:09:39] uh simple thought of
[1:09:43] restoration.
[1:09:44] Restoration. So the Bible says better is
[1:09:48] the end of a thing than the beginning of
[1:09:51] it. So I just want you to keep that in
[1:09:54] mind.
[1:09:55] Now here in the book of
[1:09:57] Joel, the palmer worm, the locust, the
[1:10:00] canker worms, and the caterpillars were
[1:10:03] eating the tree that the prophet refers
[1:10:08] to as the bride tree, which is the
[1:10:11] church. And God gave a promise of
[1:10:14] restoration. He said, "I will restore."
[1:10:19] Amen. Now in terms of restoration, God
[1:10:23] says I will restore the
[1:10:26] years. Now if there is a thing that man
[1:10:29] cannot
[1:10:30] restore is time.
[1:10:34] Is time. Uh once you lose it, you cannot
[1:10:38] restore it. But God is promising in the
[1:10:42] scriptures that he is going to restore
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] time, the
[1:10:48] years. Meaning to say that whatever was
[1:10:51] lost, if uh this was here and then it
[1:10:56] gets lost, it can easily be replaced
[1:10:59] like that. But God is saying, "I will
[1:11:03] restore as it should have
[1:11:07] been if the loss never took
[1:11:10] place." Are we together?
[1:11:14] Which means God doesn't just restore it
[1:11:16] to where it was, but he always restores
[1:11:20] it with extra because he doesn't want
[1:11:23] the time to be lost. He restores the
[1:11:28] years.
[1:11:31] So anything that would have been
[1:11:34] regarded as interest gained, growth
[1:11:38] attained, all that at the time of
[1:11:42] restoration will be included back.
[1:11:46] That's what it that's what it actually
[1:11:48] means to restore the year. So when God
[1:11:50] restores, he restores with
[1:11:54] extras. Let me just go through a few
[1:11:56] examples. Uh in Exodus 2:1, there was a
[1:12:00] man that went out of the house of Levy
[1:12:03] and took a
[1:12:04] wife. And the woman conceived and gave
[1:12:07] birth to a child, that's a child Moses.
[1:12:10] And when she saw that the child was
[1:12:12] goodly, she hid him three months. So
[1:12:17] this child is a proper child and the
[1:12:20] mother is not willing to lose the child.
[1:12:23] But fellow and the Egyptians are
[1:12:27] grabbing all the children that are born
[1:12:29] male and throwing them into the river
[1:12:32] Nile.
[1:12:37] Now, the woman thought she could keep
[1:12:39] the child, but when she realized that
[1:12:42] she couldn't keep the child anymore, she
[1:12:44] took the child, put her put the child in
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:49] ark and uh uh did some pitching there of
[1:12:54] the ark and took the child right to the
[1:12:57] lever to the river where they were
[1:12:59] throwing the children and the sister
[1:13:02] stood a far off. So, the child is in a
[1:13:04] basket. The mother has lost a
[1:13:07] child's is in a basket is in a river.
[1:13:10] And the the daughters of Pharaoh, that's
[1:13:13] verse five, came down to wash herself in
[1:13:17] the river. And her maidens walked along
[1:13:20] by the riverside. And when she saw the
[1:13:23] ark among the flag, she sent uh a maid
[1:13:27] to fetch to fetch the child. When they
[1:13:31] found that there was a
[1:13:32] baby in the basket or in that small
[1:13:37] ark, she realized that it was a uh one
[1:13:41] of the children of the
[1:13:43] Hebrews. Then Miriam the sister came and
[1:13:45] said, "Shall I go and call for a nurse
[1:13:50] uh among the Hebrew children that she
[1:13:53] may nurse the child for you?" So now the
[1:13:57] child, not only is the child in the
[1:14:00] hands or in the river, but now he's gone
[1:14:03] into the hands of the enemies, the
[1:14:06] Egyptians, right straight into the hands
[1:14:08] of the Egyptians. But now when Miriam
[1:14:10] comes, he says, "Can I look for somebody
[1:14:13] that can take care of the child?" So I
[1:14:15] just want you to see the simple example
[1:14:17] of God
[1:14:19] restoring, but not just restoring, but
[1:14:22] restoring with the extras. Amen. So when
[1:14:27] the the mother of the child said go and
[1:14:29] bring that uh that
[1:14:31] woman, Miriam went and brought the
[1:14:34] mother of the child. And when the mother
[1:14:37] of the child came in verse 9, the Bible
[1:14:39] says, "Fellow's daughter said to her,
[1:14:43] take this child." That's God restoring.
[1:14:46] "Take this child away. Nest the child
[1:14:50] for me." Not only that, I will give you
[1:14:55] wages.
[1:14:56] I will give you wages as you will be
[1:15:00] nursing the child. So it was like she
[1:15:02] had lost the child. But when God was
[1:15:04] restoring the child back into her hands,
[1:15:07] not only did the child come alone, but
[1:15:09] the child came with a pay.
[1:15:13] God restores always with extras.
[1:15:16] Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:15:22] Lord. Now the prophet in the message uh
[1:15:25] uh the resurrection of the bride the
[1:15:28] scripture that he read that I took
[1:15:30] interest in is Genesis 20:7. Genesis
[1:15:33] chapter 20:7. So in that story, a king
[1:15:38] looks at the wife of
[1:15:40] Abraham not knowing that this is the
[1:15:42] wife of Abraham because Abraham
[1:15:46] concealed that information and Sarah
[1:15:48] also concealed that information never
[1:15:51] gave it to them. Now when this king took
[1:15:56] Sarah, took her into the house, wanting
[1:16:00] to marry her, God came and said, "You
[1:16:03] are as good as a dead person because
[1:16:06] that that woman that you want to marry
[1:16:08] is not your wife. Is my servant's wife.
[1:16:15] You're as good as a dead man." And he
[1:16:18] tried to make his excuses. He says,
[1:16:20] "That's why I'm warning you. Don't touch
[1:16:22] her. Now in verse seven, he says,
[1:16:25] "Therefore restore the man his wife. He
[1:16:30] is my prophet. He will pray for you and
[1:16:32] you shall live. If you don't restore
[1:16:37] her, then you shall die and all that is
[1:16:41] yours." There's a lot that can be said
[1:16:44] there. But when Abc was bringing Sarah
[1:16:47] back to Abraham, he didn't just bring
[1:16:50] Sarah. He brought Sarah with extras.
[1:16:55] Are we together, church? Sarah with
[1:16:57] extras. Because in verse 16 of the same
[1:16:59] chapter, it says, "And Abra or the king
[1:17:02] said to Sarah, behold, I have given your
[1:17:06] brother, a thousand pieces of
[1:17:09] silver for the covering of your eyes."
[1:17:13] So he brings the wife, he also brings
[1:17:15] silver. God always when he is restoring,
[1:17:19] he always brings extras.
[1:17:22] Are we together, church? Yeah. The same
[1:17:25] can be looked about in the story of
[1:17:27] Jacob. Jacob lost a 17year-old boy, a
[1:17:31] teenager was sowed uh and then was sowed
[1:17:35] and then went to Egypt and then there in
[1:17:40] Egypt, Joseph rose up the lanks to
[1:17:44] become the governor. Then God restored
[1:17:47] the child back to Jacob.
[1:17:52] But he didn't just bring a 17-year-old
[1:17:54] back to Jacob. He brought a governor.
[1:17:58] Not only was Je Not only was Joseph able
[1:18:01] to take care of the world, but was also
[1:18:04] able to take care of the whole family of
[1:18:06] the Israelites.
[1:18:09] When God restores, he always restores
[1:18:11] with extras.
[1:18:13] So that's the that's the God that we
[1:18:15] save. Now there's a story
[1:18:17] there's a story in the in the Bible
[1:18:21] uh that I I would like to make reference
[1:18:23] to in 2 Kings chapter 8 verse one. 2
[1:18:27] Kings chapter 8 verse one. Now there was
[1:18:30] a woman uh who did service to the man of
[1:18:35] God Elisha. And then after some time
[1:18:38] Elisha realized that this woman had done
[1:18:41] so much for the ministry. When you do
[1:18:44] something for God, God will always
[1:18:46] remember you
[1:18:48] in some way. God is is always going to
[1:18:51] remember you. So
[1:18:54] um Elisha asked Gaz said, "What can we
[1:18:58] do for this people?" And then Gas said,
[1:19:00] "Okay, they don't have children. If you
[1:19:02] can if you can ask God for a favor of a
[1:19:05] child, it will be great. So,
[1:19:10] uh Elisha prayed. They got a gift of a
[1:19:13] boy. When they got a gift of a boy, one
[1:19:16] time the boy died when they were in the
[1:19:18] field. Uh she still
[1:19:21] believed and God brought the child back
[1:19:24] to
[1:19:25] life. And then after some
[1:19:29] time, after some time uh in 2 Kings
[1:19:33] chapter 8 verse one, the word of the
[1:19:35] Lord came to Elisha to give a prophecy
[1:19:39] of a ferment that would come in the
[1:19:40] land. Then spoke Elisha unto the woman
[1:19:44] whose son he had restored to life,
[1:19:48] saying,
[1:19:49] Arise, go thou and thine household, and
[1:19:53] sojurn wheresoever thou can for the Lord
[1:19:58] has called for a famine, and it shall
[1:20:01] also come upon the land seven
[1:20:04] years. There will be famine in the land.
[1:20:07] go away, go to a place of your choosing
[1:20:10] because there will be ferment in the
[1:20:11] land for seven years. And the woman
[1:20:13] arose and did after the saying of the
[1:20:16] men of God and she went to her household
[1:20:18] and sojourned in the land of the
[1:20:20] Philistines. Seven years. Now for those
[1:20:24] who believe the message of the hour, you
[1:20:26] know that God has allowed us the church
[1:20:29] to go through seven ages.
[1:20:32] So now you can look that in type here
[1:20:35] that she traveled to a land of the
[1:20:38] Philistines and stayed there for seven
[1:20:40] years. And it came to pass at the end of
[1:20:45] the seven years, at the seven years end
[1:20:48] that the woman
[1:20:50] returned to the land of the uh out of
[1:20:53] the land of the Philistines and went
[1:20:55] forth unto the king for her house and
[1:21:00] her land. So when she was leaving, she
[1:21:03] had land and she had a house. Okay? Now
[1:21:10] she travels because she doesn't want to
[1:21:12] be affected by the famine in the land.
[1:21:13] She travels to the land of the
[1:21:15] Philistines. After the seven years, the
[1:21:18] famine was over. Then she came back. Now
[1:21:22] she needs the property back because uh
[1:21:24] according to um the the the law of
[1:21:29] redemption, everybody that lost
[1:21:31] something when they had to come back,
[1:21:33] they had to go back to make a claim of
[1:21:36] whatever they had lost or whatever they
[1:21:38] had given up uh because of
[1:21:41] circumstances. So she went to the king
[1:21:45] and said
[1:21:47] uh I need my house back. I need my land
[1:21:52] back. So we just uh go to verse four.
[1:21:55] And the king talked with Gaz, the
[1:21:57] servant of Elisha, and said, tell me
[1:22:01] about uh I pray thee all the great
[1:22:03] things that Elisha has done. And it came
[1:22:05] to pass as he was telling the king how
[1:22:08] he had restored the so that story that I
[1:22:11] gave as a background. He told him
[1:22:13] everything uh that the child was
[1:22:16] restored back to life and all that the
[1:22:19] Lord had done. And Gea said, "My lord, O
[1:22:22] king, this is the woman. This is the son
[1:22:28] whom Elisha restored to life." And when
[1:22:32] the king asked the woman, she said,
[1:22:33] "Okay, you say your side of the story."
[1:22:37] Then so the king uh she told him and the
[1:22:40] king appointed a certain officer. So
[1:22:43] that's a that's a scripture portion of
[1:22:46] scripture that stimulates me. The king
[1:22:51] appointed a certain officer. Why? There
[1:22:55] is a reason. Because restoration just
[1:22:57] doesn't just come. The king couldn't
[1:22:59] just say, "Ah, go get your house and
[1:23:00] land." No, he said he appointed a
[1:23:03] certain officer to go with the
[1:23:05] woman. Go with the woman. Saying,
[1:23:09] "Restore all that was hers." So the
[1:23:13] house and the land has got to be
[1:23:16] restored back to this woman. Because
[1:23:18] when God restores, he doesn't just
[1:23:21] restore what was lost. The Bible says,
[1:23:24] "Restore all that was hers." And
[1:23:30] that's that's the
[1:23:32] extras. And the fruits of the field
[1:23:36] since the day that she left
[1:23:40] until now. So if somebody occupied that
[1:23:44] house, he has to pay rent seven years of
[1:23:48] rent back to the woman. If everybody was
[1:23:51] selling the fruits of those fields year
[1:23:54] after year for those seven years,
[1:23:56] everything that was corrected in Leu has
[1:23:59] to be given back to this woman. Why?
[1:24:01] Because when God restores, he doesn't
[1:24:04] just restore it what it was. He restores
[1:24:07] with extras.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] Are we together church? He restores with
[1:24:15] extras everything that was lost plus the
[1:24:17] years. That's why the promise of
[1:24:19] restoration, God said, I will restore
[1:24:23] the
[1:24:26] years. Are we together, church? I will
[1:24:29] restore the
[1:24:34] years. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:24:40] Now let me just uh read a quotation here
[1:24:43] of what the prophet says uh in the
[1:24:45] message
[1:24:49] um the restoration of the bride tree is
[1:24:52] talking
[1:24:53] about
[1:24:55] enforcing. So this woman could not
[1:24:58] enforce the promise on her own. That's
[1:25:00] why she needed an agent an officer to go
[1:25:03] with her. Now in paragraph 88 of the
[1:25:06] message the restoration of the bride
[1:25:08] tree he says
[1:25:11] enforce we have the
[1:25:15] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:25:19] claims that God give us for God has a
[1:25:24] law and his word is a law and God in his
[1:25:30] in this word made a certain uh made
[1:25:33] certain claim claims to the church.
[1:25:36] Therefore, we have the right to force
[1:25:40] these claims upon Satan. Give it back.
[1:25:45] Give it back.
[1:25:47] Give it back. And the devil has to I am
[1:25:51] preaching to a people
[1:25:53] tonight who have lost things.
[1:25:58] I'm speaking to the believers today who
[1:26:00] may have lost whatever you have lost in
[1:26:02] your life. I know some of you would have
[1:26:05] been somewhere by now.
[1:26:08] I mean, you know, you know your issues.
[1:26:10] Sometimes the devil will rob you of your
[1:26:12] health and incapacitate you in some way
[1:26:15] and you can't be able to get the results
[1:26:19] because of the loss.
[1:26:21] Now God God says you have been given the
[1:26:26] power to enforce
[1:26:29] to go to the devil and say give it back.
[1:26:33] give it back to me. Whatever you have
[1:26:36] lost
[1:26:38] from the time that you became a
[1:26:40] believer, by now you'd have been a
[1:26:41] champion of
[1:26:43] faith. But sometimes the devil will
[1:26:46] cause you to sleep. Sometimes the devil
[1:26:48] will cause you to fall. Sometimes the
[1:26:50] devil will cause you to fail. And along
[1:26:53] the way, you lose some things. But God
[1:26:56] has given us the power today that we can
[1:26:59] enforce
[1:27:01] the promises of God. We can enforce the
[1:27:04] promises of God and we can go to Satan
[1:27:07] and say, "Give it back to me." That's
[1:27:10] right.
[1:27:16] Because we can take God's
[1:27:20] urgent because God has given us an
[1:27:24] officer to reinforce the promises of
[1:27:27] God. Just that just like the king gave
[1:27:30] an officer to that woman to say go and
[1:27:33] make claim everything that is yours plus
[1:27:36] the years that were lost. God has got an
[1:27:39] agent, the Holy Spirit. That's right.
[1:27:42] God has got an agent, the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:45] That's the one that we go with to the
[1:27:46] devil. So you can go today. Amen.
[1:27:52] Listen, church,
[1:27:54] you have got to believe God that he is.
[1:28:00] You don't have to believe in the God of
[1:28:01] history. No, you don't just have to read
[1:28:04] about the Shunomite woman. You've got to
[1:28:06] take yourself and put yourself in the
[1:28:08] channel. When you put yourself in the
[1:28:10] channel, say, "This is me. This is my
[1:28:14] time." Then take God's urgent, the Holy
[1:28:18] Spirit, and you can face the devil and
[1:28:20] say, "Everything that I've lost over the
[1:28:22] years,
[1:28:24] I make claim." Give it back.
[1:28:29] Give it back in the name of the Lord
[1:28:30] Jesus.
[1:28:32] Amen. And the prophet says, "It's thus
[1:28:35] sayith the Lord." He has got to give it
[1:28:37] up.
[1:28:38] Why? Because the Holy Spirit is there,
[1:28:42] God's urgent, an officer to reinforce
[1:28:47] claims and to make restoration as it
[1:28:51] should be to restore with extras.
[1:28:57] Are we together, church? Now, the church
[1:29:00] that was based on the day of
[1:29:02] Pentecost has gone through ages, seven
[1:29:05] ages, but there's been balamism. There's
[1:29:07] been
[1:29:08] neglaninism. There's been Jezebelism.
[1:29:11] All these kinds of spirits that have
[1:29:13] crept into the church over the years
[1:29:15] from the nent council 325 AD. You
[1:29:19] know that Jezebelism is the dominance of
[1:29:23] the woman.
[1:29:26] And God hates that spirit. We had it
[1:29:29] too. We don't want to say our church
[1:29:32] says we want to say the word
[1:29:34] says. Right. Come on now. Because we
[1:29:38] don't want the woman to dominate. We
[1:29:40] want the man Christ to dominate.
[1:29:44] And balamism, God headed it. We also
[1:29:47] heard it.
[1:29:50] What? What was balame? Balameism is
[1:29:52] looking for a cause to go with the
[1:29:55] negative route to case the people of
[1:29:57] God. And in that instead of trying to
[1:30:00] please God, you please yourself to for
[1:30:03] gain. We don't want to do that. We don't
[1:30:05] want to please people for gain. We want
[1:30:09] Christ to be lifted to be seen in the
[1:30:11] lives of the people.
[1:30:14] That's right. So we hate that. God hates
[1:30:17] it too. And Nicolatanism is
[1:30:21] uh the headquarter says the headquarter
[1:30:24] says the headquarter says and you are
[1:30:28] talking about the hierarchy of people.
[1:30:30] God has it. The system of
[1:30:32] denominationalism.
[1:30:34] God hates it.
[1:30:37] We also hate it. We are the headquarters
[1:30:40] of the message is the Holy Spirit. The
[1:30:43] kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit. Are
[1:30:47] we together, church?
[1:30:49] Amen. So, we want that to prevail in our
[1:30:52] midst. Now, here's the thing.
[1:30:56] Um over the years that was eating up the
[1:31:00] tree, the church, the tree was eating it
[1:31:03] up and so much was lost and had to go
[1:31:06] through a reformation. And by the grace
[1:31:09] of God, we came to the age of
[1:31:11] restoration.
[1:31:15] Now God, as we have seen in all these
[1:31:19] other examples, does not just restore it
[1:31:21] to what it was.
[1:31:23] He restores it with the extras. So
[1:31:26] you've got to believe if I am preaching
[1:31:28] the same gospel that Peter preached.
[1:31:30] When Peter preached the people received
[1:31:32] the Holy Spirit, then I've got to get
[1:31:35] the same results. When I preach, the
[1:31:36] people have to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:31:38] as well. Why? Because God is restoring
[1:31:42] what was there. They brought their sick
[1:31:44] and they they they got
[1:31:47] healed. Even with Peter's shadow, today
[1:31:50] when we get our sick in the presence of
[1:31:52] God, they've got to be healed as well.
[1:31:54] Why? because we've been restored back.
[1:31:58] That's right. What it
[1:32:01] was. Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[1:32:05] That's why because they baptized in
[1:32:07] Jesus Christ's name, we baptized in
[1:32:09] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:32:11] That's why because they had Jesus as the
[1:32:14] principal theme. We have Jesus as the
[1:32:15] principal theme.
[1:32:18] Everywhere they went, they preach Jesus.
[1:32:20] That's why everywhere we go, we preach
[1:32:21] Jesus. Why? because we've been restored
[1:32:24] back to what they had. Right?
[1:32:29] And all these great signs and wonders
[1:32:31] and miracles, the gifts operating in the
[1:32:34] church. They had it in the early church.
[1:32:37] We have it again here. The same.
[1:32:41] It has to be the same because Jesus
[1:32:42] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:32:44] forever. And we've been restored back to
[1:32:46] that. But listen, church, God doesn't
[1:32:49] just restore it what it was. He restores
[1:32:52] it with extras.
[1:32:55] So I want to read a quote. I I may not
[1:32:58] be able to read it all but something in
[1:33:00] the in the in the message of the talking
[1:33:03] that the prophet said in the message of
[1:33:05] the
[1:33:07] talking. He says he done more miracles
[1:33:12] right here. He's talking about Jefferson
[1:33:14] view. He done more miracles right here
[1:33:16] in this tabernacle than he did in the
[1:33:20] entire ministry on earth. So what he did
[1:33:25] in the early age is compared to what he
[1:33:28] has done at the end of the age, he has
[1:33:31] done more today than he did at the
[1:33:34] beginning. Why? Because the Bible says
[1:33:38] better is the end of a thing than the
[1:33:40] beginning of it. Better is the end of a
[1:33:43] thing than the beginning of it.
[1:33:46] Amen. And you've got to look for more.
[1:33:48] You've got to live under expectation,
[1:33:50] church. God has made a promise. God is f
[1:33:54] is faithful to fulfill his word in your
[1:33:58] life.
[1:34:00] Listen, those in the bride only do his
[1:34:03] will. The word is in the bride. You
[1:34:06] speak the word, he will perform it.
[1:34:09] Amen. So that's why the prophet says he
[1:34:13] did, he has done. It's not man. It's
[1:34:17] Jesus who did in the first place. It's
[1:34:19] Jesus who is doing at the end at the end
[1:34:21] of the age. Amen. So you've got to be
[1:34:25] under great expectation. There's
[1:34:27] something else that I want to read from
[1:34:28] the message.
[1:34:32] um in the message
[1:34:36] um the invisible
[1:34:41] union paragraph 324 the invisible union
[1:34:44] it says the word that fell on the day of
[1:34:51] Pentecost will not work this day no sir
[1:34:55] that was for
[1:34:57] Pentecost this is for the bride lady
[1:35:00] going home of the bride. We've got
[1:35:03] something different. The Pentecostals
[1:35:06] represented that again. Again, it means
[1:35:09] restored to what it was and we are here
[1:35:14] in the bride age. So what is the prophet
[1:35:17] saying? What the prophet is saying is
[1:35:20] whatever was there in the first age has
[1:35:22] been restored but we have got something
[1:35:25] more.
[1:35:27] That's why he says we've got something
[1:35:28] different because we have something
[1:35:30] more. Why? Because when God restores, he
[1:35:32] restores with extras.
[1:35:35] Amen. You can only please God with
[1:35:37] faith. If you believe, you see more of
[1:35:40] God. If you can believe God today, you
[1:35:43] can see more of God today.
[1:35:48] Amen.
[1:35:49] So we are
[1:35:50] living in the age that brother Brandham
[1:35:53] calls the bride age or the age of the
[1:35:57] wife of
[1:35:59] Christ. And you've got to discern the
[1:36:01] body because in the fatherhood
[1:36:04] dispensation the body of Christ was in a
[1:36:07] pill of fire in a light in a cloud by
[1:36:10] day. Sometimes you would appear in a
[1:36:13] form like the angel of the Lord the way
[1:36:15] he appeared to Abraham in different
[1:36:16] kinds of forms. That was the body of
[1:36:19] Christ. But in the new covenant, he
[1:36:22] appeared as a human being, the Lord
[1:36:24] Jesus Christ. The Bible made a promise
[1:36:27] that there would be an Emmanuel, God
[1:36:30] with the people. That was the body of
[1:36:32] Christ in those three and a half years.
[1:36:35] But Paul says we are the body of Christ.
[1:36:40] Today we are the body of Christ. So if
[1:36:43] if the world is going to see God again
[1:36:46] is going to see God through the wife.
[1:36:51] That's right. And there was supposed to
[1:36:53] be a time that this would come forth.
[1:36:56] And brother Brandham says the bride age
[1:36:59] or the age of the wife of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:03] And you are the people. I am blessed
[1:37:06] today to be speaking and addressing
[1:37:08] those people that have been bought by
[1:37:11] the precious blood of our Lord Jesus
[1:37:13] Christ.
[1:37:15] Redeemed for a purpose, raised for a
[1:37:18] purpose. We are not here just to go. We
[1:37:21] are here to manifest God before we go.
[1:37:24] Amen. What God had in mind, the
[1:37:27] adoption was what he had purposed in his
[1:37:31] mind for us to come to the image of
[1:37:33] Jesus Christ to manifest God on earth
[1:37:37] before we go.
[1:37:42] Amen. All right. Let me go back to my
[1:37:45] scripture
[1:37:46] verses. I would like to pick
[1:37:50] uh a few more examples. In the book of
[1:37:53] Job chapter 1 is a job chapter 1 is a
[1:37:56] scripture of
[1:37:58] loss. Job chapter 1 verse 13 says there
[1:38:01] was a day when the sons and daughters
[1:38:04] were eating and drinking wine
[1:38:07] uh in the elder brother's house. And
[1:38:09] there came a messenger unto Job and
[1:38:11] said, "The oxins were plowing and the
[1:38:13] asses feeding beside them and the
[1:38:15] Sabians came and they took them all
[1:38:17] away, slain the servants, and I'm the
[1:38:21] only one that escaped." And while he was
[1:38:24] speaking, somebody else came and said,
[1:38:26] "Fire fell from heaven and bent up the
[1:38:29] ship and everything else, and I'm the
[1:38:32] only one left." While he was speaking,
[1:38:34] verse 7, another one came and said, "The
[1:38:37] Chaldans made out three bands and fell
[1:38:41] upon camels and carried away them and
[1:38:44] slain the servants in the uh with the
[1:38:47] edge of the sword, and I'm the only one
[1:38:49] left." And while he was speaking, there
[1:38:51] came another one and said, "The sons and
[1:38:54] daughters were eating and drinking in
[1:38:56] their elder brother's house, and behold,
[1:38:58] there came a great wind from the
[1:39:00] wilderness and smote the uh the four
[1:39:02] corners of the house, and fell upon the
[1:39:05] young men, and they were dead, and I am
[1:39:08] the only one that
[1:39:10] escaped." Job. So, it's a chapter of
[1:39:13] loss.
[1:39:15] one thing after another. It was like God
[1:39:18] had taken out the hedge and the owner
[1:39:21] preserved his life.
[1:39:25] Now this chapter doesn't say that Job's
[1:39:27] wife also started misbehaving. But you
[1:39:30] can actually see if you follow the story
[1:39:31] that even the wife's attitude changed.
[1:39:33] Right?
[1:39:36] So when everything is going on good in
[1:39:39] your life, most of the times you've got
[1:39:40] a lot of friends and a lot of
[1:39:43] acquaintances, brothers and sisters,
[1:39:44] your relatives will always be ringing
[1:39:46] around gre giving you greetings and
[1:39:48] everything. God, you've got I mean you
[1:39:50] your life is comfortable. So relatives
[1:39:53] will be around, friends will be around.
[1:39:56] It's easy to fellowship with people that
[1:39:58] have got everything going on good with
[1:40:00] them. But when the loss came, even his
[1:40:04] friends, his family members, his
[1:40:06] acquaintances distanced themselves from
[1:40:09] him. The closest of his friends accused
[1:40:13] him of being a
[1:40:15] sinner. So his sheep lost, his camels
[1:40:19] lost, his houses lost, his fields lost,
[1:40:22] bent with
[1:40:23] fire, his cattle lost, everything lost,
[1:40:27] his servants dead, dead, dead, dead.
[1:40:32] And then his health also lost. He lost
[1:40:36] his
[1:40:36] health. Developed boils all over the
[1:40:39] place. And then he was just one man
[1:40:42] hanging in there on a heap of
[1:40:46] ashes. It's a chapter of a loss. But I
[1:40:50] love the Bible the way it's written in
[1:40:52] Job chapter 1 verse 20. Then Job arose,
[1:40:56] rent his mantle, shaved his head and
[1:40:59] fell upon the ground and he worshiped
[1:41:02] God.
[1:41:04] He worshiped God.
[1:41:08] What do you do when you go through a
[1:41:10] loss?
[1:41:12] What is your attitude when you go
[1:41:13] through a loss
[1:41:15] job after everything?
[1:41:17] You've got to be the kind of believer
[1:41:19] that confuses the devil because when the
[1:41:22] what the devil was expecting is after he
[1:41:24] had done all that, Job would turn and
[1:41:27] say, "Oh Lord, I curse you." That's what
[1:41:30] the devil was expecting. But Job arose.
[1:41:34] He He tore his mantle apart. He shove
[1:41:37] his head and he worshiped God. He said,
[1:41:40] "The Lord gave. The Lord has taken.
[1:41:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:41:49] When you go through a loss, it's your
[1:41:51] opportunity to confuse the devil.
[1:41:54] Worship God. Praise God.
[1:42:00] So, it's a chapter of loss. Then he went
[1:42:03] through these hard times.
[1:42:09] But after the 40 chapters in the
[1:42:14] middle in Job chapter 42:10, the Bible
[1:42:19] says, "And the Lord,
[1:42:23] because God made a promise, I will
[1:42:26] restore."
[1:42:28] God is a God of restoration.
[1:42:31] He restores. And the uh and the Lord t
[1:42:35] the captivity of Job when he had prayed
[1:42:37] for his friends. And also the Lord gave
[1:42:41] Job twice.
[1:42:44] Why? Because when God restores, he
[1:42:47] doesn't just restore it what it was. He
[1:42:49] restores with it extras.
[1:42:53] He restores it with the
[1:42:54] extras. That's why he restored to Job
[1:42:59] twice what he had before.
[1:43:04] I love that.
[1:43:07] I I love that when I lose something, I
[1:43:10] know that it's coming. It's not just
[1:43:13] coming. It's just It's not just coming
[1:43:16] as it was. It will come with double. It
[1:43:18] will come with interest. It will come
[1:43:21] with extras. Every time I go through a
[1:43:24] loss, I always remind myself of these
[1:43:26] scriptures. Everything that I've lost
[1:43:28] would come back with interest. it will
[1:43:31] come back with extras because it's God's
[1:43:34] way of restoring.
[1:43:36] Every time he restores with extras.
[1:43:40] Amen.
[1:43:42] And now in verse
[1:43:45] 11, beautiful. Then came there unto him
[1:43:50] all the brethren because is a time of
[1:43:54] restoration. This is a glorious time.
[1:43:57] The time of restoration. Then came his
[1:44:00] brethren and his sisters because now
[1:44:03] everything is backed on. He has got he's
[1:44:05] got his life organized now. He's no
[1:44:09] longer one lost soul on a b on a heap of
[1:44:12] ashes. No, he's he's living in
[1:44:17] uh abundance.
[1:44:20] He's living in abundance. So the
[1:44:22] brothers, the sisters, they came and all
[1:44:25] that his all that were his
[1:44:27] acquaintances, the friends, they came
[1:44:29] and they did eat bread with him in his
[1:44:33] house and bemoourned him and comforted
[1:44:38] him over all that the Lord had brought
[1:44:40] upon him. And not only did they eat and
[1:44:44] drink and comforted him, every man also
[1:44:48] gave him a piece of money
[1:44:52] and everyone an earring of God. When God
[1:44:57] restores, he restores with extras.
[1:45:02] Hallelujah. Are we together, church?
[1:45:06] Yeah. Now that we know that we in a time
[1:45:08] of restoration, this is a time of
[1:45:10] shalom. This is a time of peace. You
[1:45:14] don't keep grudges. Job never kept
[1:45:17] grudges. Job never turned around and
[1:45:19] said, "Are you brother, you remember
[1:45:21] what you did to me? You brother, you
[1:45:23] remember what? You remember the argument
[1:45:25] or you remember the disagreement we
[1:45:26] had?" No, no, no, no, no. When God
[1:45:29] restores, it's time for reconciliations.
[1:45:34] Listen, church. Because we are living in
[1:45:37] a season of restoration. Don't keep
[1:45:39] grudges with anyone. Don't don't fight
[1:45:42] another believer. Don't keep grudges
[1:45:45] with another church. Don't keep issues
[1:45:48] with anyone else. Be at peace with all
[1:45:51] people. Eat with them. Drink with them.
[1:45:55] And let their be giving.
[1:45:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. We are
[1:46:01] the masterpiece like Joseph. You see,
[1:46:04] when Joseph, he was swared by his own
[1:46:08] brothers, he was just
[1:46:11] being built up into a masterpiece. Are
[1:46:14] we together? He was just being built up
[1:46:17] into a masterpiece. When he had lost
[1:46:19] everything, he had lost his family. When
[1:46:21] the time for reunion came, even though,
[1:46:24] think about it, they even they hated him
[1:46:26] so much that they even forgot his face.
[1:46:31] Yeah. They completely forgot his face
[1:46:33] when they came. They didn't even
[1:46:35] recognize their own
[1:46:37] brother. That's what hatred does. It's
[1:46:39] not a good
[1:46:41] thing. You will fail even to recognize
[1:46:43] your own. But because he never kept
[1:46:45] grudges, he never kept any issues when
[1:46:48] he saw them coming. He knew each and
[1:46:50] every one of them. That's the kind that
[1:46:54] that's the bride material.
[1:46:56] Don't keep grudges. Don't keep issues
[1:46:59] with people. Remember that the brothers
[1:47:02] and sisters though we may have issues at
[1:47:05] some point we will spend eternity
[1:47:07] together.
[1:47:10] And when he was and when he began to
[1:47:12] unveil himself what did he do? He put
[1:47:15] the first plate Reuben the second one
[1:47:18] the second born. The third one the third
[1:47:20] because he knew them. The fourth one and
[1:47:23] the last plate Benjamin. And they were
[1:47:26] surprised. How is he able to put the
[1:47:28] plates together like this?
[1:47:31] Because he was brothers with them
[1:47:37] and they ate together at the table. So
[1:47:39] when a time of restoration comes, it's a
[1:47:42] time to reunite. And better is the end
[1:47:44] of a thing than the beginning of a
[1:47:46] thing. I'm a young man, but sometimes
[1:47:49] people will want to flood me with
[1:47:51] thoughts of the past. People will say
[1:47:53] when the message just began, oh, we used
[1:47:55] to love each other. Oh, we used to pray
[1:47:57] for each other. Me I say I don't drive
[1:47:59] the road looking through a layer view
[1:48:01] mirror. Better is the end of a thing
[1:48:03] than the beginning of it. We will love
[1:48:06] each other more today than they did
[1:48:08] before. We will pray for each other more
[1:48:11] today than they did before. We will
[1:48:14] fellowship with each other more today
[1:48:16] than they did before. Why? Because
[1:48:18] better is the end of a thing than the
[1:48:21] beginning of it. And when God restores,
[1:48:23] he restores with extras. If they had
[1:48:26] wonderful fellowship, we will have
[1:48:28] excellent, wonderful fellowship.
[1:48:35] If they had love, brotherly kindness, we
[1:48:37] will have excellent brotherly kindness.
[1:48:42] If they used to share, we will share
[1:48:45] excellently. We will have fellowship
[1:48:48] with us like never because better is the
[1:48:51] end of a thing than the beginning of it
[1:48:53] and we are living in that season.
[1:48:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:48:59] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:02] Um so other people who say when the
[1:49:04] message just came there were miracles
[1:49:06] everywhere. The blind uh the the
[1:49:09] people's eyes that were blind could
[1:49:12] open. The dead could come back to life.
[1:49:14] But we don't hear about those things
[1:49:16] anymore. I tell them I said
[1:49:18] relax. I don't I don't go down the road
[1:49:22] looking through a layer view mirror.
[1:49:23] Paul said forgetting those things which
[1:49:25] are in the past. I press on to towards
[1:49:27] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[1:49:30] Jesus. You've got to believe God for
[1:49:32] today because people are interested in
[1:49:35] what happened and what is going to
[1:49:37] happen but they ignore what God is doing
[1:49:39] in the in the in the present. That's
[1:49:41] right.
[1:49:42] So God is doing more miracles today.
[1:49:47] God is doing great and wonderful things
[1:49:49] today.
[1:49:53] Amen. You just have to go into that
[1:49:55] channel, look at the scriptures that are
[1:49:57] that are to be fulfilled in your time.
[1:50:01] Then ride on
[1:50:03] them. Ride on the
[1:50:06] promises. Stand on the promises and you
[1:50:09] will see God is faithful. Ever faithful.
[1:50:13] That's right. God is ever
[1:50:16] faithful. Blessed be the name of the
[1:50:18] Lord. Amen. So they brought each money
[1:50:21] and they ate together with Job. And the
[1:50:24] Bible says, so the Lord verse 12. So the
[1:50:28] Lord blessed the latter
[1:50:32] end of Job more than his beginning.
[1:50:38] For he had 14, which is double the
[1:50:41] sheep, double the camels, double the
[1:50:43] oxen, double the uh donkeys, and double
[1:50:46] the everything. And he also had uh seven
[1:50:50] sons and three daughters which is now
[1:50:52] double because the other ones God
[1:50:54] preserved
[1:50:55] them for him. He had already offered
[1:50:59] sacrifices for their mistakes. So God
[1:51:01] preserved them for him and God gave him
[1:51:03] more.
[1:51:06] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:51:10] Amen. Are you still following?
[1:51:15] All right. Uh in Genesis 15:14, God gave
[1:51:19] a promise to Abraham, a promise of
[1:51:22] restoration. Uh verse 14, sorry, chapter
[1:51:26] 15, it says
[1:51:27] uh your verse 13, it says, "Know this
[1:51:31] for sure that your seed shall be
[1:51:33] strangers in a land that is not theirs,
[1:51:36] and shall save them, and shall afflict
[1:51:38] them uh 400
[1:51:40] years. and also the nation whom they
[1:51:44] shall save I will judge and afterward
[1:51:48] they shall come out with
[1:51:51] great
[1:51:52] substance. So there the word great
[1:51:55] substance means great worth. They will
[1:51:57] be prosperous people when they will be
[1:51:59] coming out. So it's a promise of God. It
[1:52:02] can never fail
[1:52:04] when they will be coming out. When I'll
[1:52:06] be bringing them out because God doesn't
[1:52:07] just restore with nothing. He restores
[1:52:10] with abundance.
[1:52:13] Now, when I'm talking about abundance,
[1:52:15] I'm talking about abundance in every
[1:52:17] area of life. You've got to believe God
[1:52:20] that is able to help you in everything
[1:52:23] that that pertains to life and
[1:52:25] godliness.
[1:52:27] Your physical life will be better. Your
[1:52:29] spiritual life will be better.
[1:52:32] Do you believe that?
[1:52:35] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:52:38] It says here uh that nation I will judge
[1:52:40] and afterward they will come out with
[1:52:42] great
[1:52:43] substance and
[1:52:46] um great substance there means a lot of
[1:52:50] items. That's why in Job chapter 1:3 it
[1:52:54] says his substance was great and he's
[1:52:56] talking about sheep and this and that
[1:52:58] and the other. In Genesis 13:6, it says,
[1:53:01] "Abraham talking about him being rich
[1:53:05] and Lord being rich as well." It says,
[1:53:07] "For their substance was great." So,
[1:53:09] it's talking about material wealth.
[1:53:11] Amen. Amen. And you've got to believe
[1:53:14] that for yourself as well. Everything
[1:53:17] that you have lost over the years, God
[1:53:20] is faithful to give it to you.
[1:53:24] Amen. So, what happened? They had been
[1:53:29] enslaved for 400
[1:53:33] years, not seven
[1:53:35] years.
[1:53:37] 400
[1:53:40] years. That's a long
[1:53:43] time. That's a very long time. And when
[1:53:46] God says, "I will restore the years," it
[1:53:48] means he will
[1:53:50] restore 400 years.
[1:53:54] Amen. That's why these Israelites when
[1:53:56] they were coming out, they would come
[1:53:58] with great substance.
[1:54:01] That would come with great substance
[1:54:03] because it was a promise of God. A never
[1:54:06] failing promise of God. A promise of God
[1:54:09] that doesn't fail. Now, let me just read
[1:54:11] another scripture for you and then we'll
[1:54:13] we'll go into something. uh then maybe I
[1:54:16] can see where I can settle
[1:54:18] down here in the scriptures in Exodus
[1:54:22] chapter 12. Exodus 12 verse 35. Exodus
[1:54:28] 12:35 says, "And the children of Israel
[1:54:30] did according to the word of Moses and
[1:54:33] they borrowed. So they were not like uh
[1:54:36] just plundering you know they went
[1:54:38] respectively and said uh can you give us
[1:54:41] that? Can you give us that? We are going
[1:54:43] to worship for a little bit. will come
[1:54:45] back. Can you give us that? But you
[1:54:47] know, they were not going to come back.
[1:54:49] They were going to the promised land.
[1:54:52] But they came and said uh they borrowed
[1:54:55] from the Egyptians jewels of silver.
[1:54:58] Jewels of God and
[1:55:02] rain. So they had gold, they had silver,
[1:55:06] and they had reignment. And the Bible
[1:55:08] says, "And the Lord gave the people
[1:55:11] favor." So, one of the scriptures that I
[1:55:13] love so much, when God's favor is upon
[1:55:16] you, you will find favor with people.
[1:55:20] When God's favor is upon you, you will
[1:55:23] find favor with people. When God's
[1:55:25] finger has pointed at you, people's
[1:55:28] fingers will point at you.
[1:55:31] You see, God had pointed his finger at
[1:55:34] Joseph before he was in when he was in
[1:55:37] Canaan. Already, his finger was on him.
[1:55:41] But his favor was him was on him and was
[1:55:44] following him all the time. When
[1:55:46] Portifer wanted to choose a supervisor,
[1:55:48] he couldn't do otherwise. He just went
[1:55:50] to Joseph. Why? Because God's finger was
[1:55:52] on him.
[1:55:54] When the jailer in prison wanted to
[1:55:56] choose a supervisor, he just pointed at
[1:55:59] Joseph because God's finger was on him.
[1:56:03] And when he stood before Pharaoh, he
[1:56:05] said, "Find a man." Joseph speaking to
[1:56:06] Fellow, find a man who can look after
[1:56:09] these things, who can take care of all
[1:56:10] these issues. But because God's finger
[1:56:13] was on Joseph, Ph said, we don't have
[1:56:17] any other man. That man is you.
[1:56:22] Amen. So when you have God's favor, you
[1:56:25] will find favor with people. Amen. Amen.
[1:56:28] And that that's my prayer for each and
[1:56:30] every one of you listening
[1:56:32] that may God's favor be upon you so that
[1:56:35] you can find favor with the people.
[1:56:39] Amen. And the Lord gave him favor in the
[1:56:42] sight of the Egyptians and they reigned
[1:56:43] unto them as much as they required and
[1:56:46] they spoiled the Egyptians. The Bible
[1:56:48] says they took
[1:56:50] advantage of the Egyptians. So when
[1:56:53] God's favor comes upon you, take
[1:56:55] advantage.
[1:56:57] So they said I I was also thinking about
[1:56:59] this one. Can I also have this? Can I I
[1:57:01] I was also can you just give me that one
[1:57:03] as well? And at that time the Egyptians
[1:57:05] were shivering like this. Say take take.
[1:57:10] So when God's time of restoration comes,
[1:57:14] it's a time of take
[1:57:17] take. So as I am preaching to you right
[1:57:19] now, think about what you have lost.
[1:57:22] Think about those things that you have
[1:57:23] lost and take take.
[1:57:28] And they had so much in abundance. You
[1:57:30] see, when they wanted to worship a calf,
[1:57:32] they made a golden calf because they had
[1:57:35] so much gold. And when God said, "I want
[1:57:38] you to build an ark of the tabernacle of
[1:57:40] the presence of God." God said, "Make it
[1:57:43] of
[1:57:44] God." And the people brought a lot of
[1:57:47] God until Moses said, "That's enough."
[1:57:50] Amen. until the the the ministry needs
[1:57:54] such blessings
[1:57:56] to the extent that the leadership can
[1:57:58] say well you do you have done too much
[1:58:00] you have done too much you have done too
[1:58:02] much me I believe in me I believe in
[1:58:04] abundance I believe good health in
[1:58:06] abundance a good and prayerful life in
[1:58:09] abundance happiness in abundance good
[1:58:12] relationships in abundance
[1:58:15] why because our God is not a limited God
[1:58:18] we save we save a living limitless
[1:58:22] God. He can do
[1:58:25] exceedingly
[1:58:26] abundantly and more than we can ever
[1:58:29] think or ask. And the prophet of God
[1:58:32] comes to you and say,
[1:58:33] "Church, ask big things."
[1:58:37] Ask for big things.
[1:58:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:58:44] Amen. Now, uh I was just talking about
[1:58:48] the Israelites,
[1:58:52] but sometimes the devil will come to you
[1:58:55] and will just rob you of certain things
[1:58:57] like David. David was a good believer
[1:59:00] and every time he was singing, was in a
[1:59:02] very good relationship with God. His
[1:59:04] heart was connected to God. He kept the
[1:59:06] laws of God in his heart. He was a
[1:59:08] wonderful person. But
[1:59:10] sometime he
[1:59:12] slipped. He did backslide.
[1:59:15] and he lost the joy of his
[1:59:18] salvation. You see, so some of you may
[1:59:21] have slipped along the
[1:59:24] way. You know that the type of Christian
[1:59:28] that you were supposed to be and the
[1:59:31] type of Christian that you have been
[1:59:32] maybe there is a
[1:59:35] deficit here and there. You may have
[1:59:37] lost the joy of your salvation. But
[1:59:39] David prayed a prayer. He said, "Restore
[1:59:42] to me the joy of my salvation." Amen.
[1:59:47] That's right. So, let that be your
[1:59:49] prayer as well today. Because this
[1:59:51] message that I'm preaching to you has
[1:59:53] got to take effect in your life today.
[1:59:56] May God restore to you the joy of your
[1:59:59] salvation. When God restores, when God
[2:00:03] restores you back to that place where
[2:00:06] you can have that good relationship with
[2:00:08] him again, he can also restore to you
[2:00:11] the joy of your salvation.
[2:00:15] If you were not in church and singing
[2:00:17] hallelujah and praising God freely
[2:00:20] because of the issues that you had in
[2:00:22] life, may God change that
[2:00:25] because the devil is happy when you are
[2:00:26] bound. You come to church, you just
[2:00:29] cover a religious space. But that's not
[2:00:31] what God wants you to do. God wants
[2:00:33] worshippers who can worship him in
[2:00:35] spirit and in truth. And where the
[2:00:38] spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[2:00:41] You've got to be able to worship God
[2:00:43] freely.
[2:00:46] Freely. So may God restore to us the joy
[2:00:50] of our salvation.
[2:00:52] Amen. So sometimes the devil comes
[2:00:54] because the Bible says in John chapter
[2:00:56] 10 verse 10, a thief comes not but to
[2:01:01] steal, to
[2:01:03] kill, to destroy. And the adversary in
[2:01:06] this context of scripture is referred to
[2:01:09] as a thief. A thief comes but to steal,
[2:01:14] to kill, to destroy. But Jesus says,
[2:01:16] "But I have come that you might have
[2:01:18] life and that you might have it more
[2:01:21] abundantly.
[2:01:24] abundantly. See, so a
[2:01:27] thief comes. That's why God had to
[2:01:30] include that in his divine wisdom. He
[2:01:32] had to include that in the restoration
[2:01:35] process because some people would get
[2:01:37] robbed of things that that belonged to
[2:01:40] them, rightfully belong to them. In
[2:01:42] Proverbs 6:30, the Bible says, "Men do
[2:01:45] not despise the thief." People have got
[2:01:49] no problem with somebody stealing food
[2:01:51] because maybe they're hungry. That's
[2:01:52] what the Bible says here. Men do not
[2:01:55] despise a thief if he steals to satisfy
[2:02:00] his
[2:02:02] soul. Do you do you listen to
[2:02:05] that? Verse 31 says,
[2:02:08] "But but if he be
[2:02:13] found, if that thief is found, if he be
[2:02:17] found, he shall restore sevenfold."
[2:02:23] He shall restore how many times?
[2:02:26] Sevenfold. He will not restore it to
[2:02:28] what it was. He will restore with
[2:02:31] extras. So the devil is a thief. And
[2:02:34] today we are in the presence of God. And
[2:02:38] the thief has been caught.
[2:02:41] The thief has been caught. Amen. The
[2:02:44] enemy has been caught.
[2:02:46] And what does the Bible say? He must
[2:02:48] restore. Give it back sevenfold. Amen.
[2:02:54] Whatever you Whatever you lost,
[2:02:57] God has got to give you back times
[2:03:00] seven. Whatever the devil robbed from
[2:03:02] you has got to be given back to you
[2:03:05] sevenfold.
[2:03:07] And by that I mean everything sevenfold.
[2:03:13] Blessed be the name of.
[2:03:17] Amen. Um now let me uh settle and end
[2:03:22] with
[2:03:23] this.
[2:03:25] Um we've talked about the restoration of
[2:03:28] the church. That's why we're saying we
[2:03:29] are in the capstone
[2:03:32] age in the day of Jesus
[2:03:35] Christ and we are the ones that are
[2:03:39] supposed the embodiment of the Holy
[2:03:41] Spirit to manifest God in this
[2:03:43] age. That's who we
[2:03:45] are. So is a masterpiece that has never
[2:03:48] been there before. everything that God
[2:03:51] had in
[2:03:53] mind about the expression. Remember the
[2:03:56] first F is him in Jesus Christ. The
[2:03:59] second for is him in the church. The
[2:04:02] second for mystery of God is him in the
[2:04:05] church. So we've got to manifest and
[2:04:07] leave that. But after that we've got to
[2:04:11] go back further to what we lost. What
[2:04:14] else did we lose?
[2:04:17] We lost our estate in the garden of
[2:04:20] Eden and that is for all
[2:04:24] mankind. We lost our position in the
[2:04:27] garden of Eden. The devil came and
[2:04:28] robbed us of our status, deceived uh the
[2:04:32] woman Eve and he made us lose
[2:04:35] everything. Now listen
[2:04:36] church and you young people, you should
[2:04:39] know that there used to be harmony and
[2:04:42] the earth was beautiful. There used to
[2:04:44] be harmony on
[2:04:46] earth. People used to live comfortably
[2:04:49] with the lions, the
[2:04:52] elephants. When you look at a a leopard,
[2:04:55] you know a
[2:04:56] leopard. When you look at a leopard, in
[2:04:58] those days you'd be looking at a
[2:05:01] friend, something that you can go and
[2:05:04] hug. When you look at a crocodile, in
[2:05:07] those days, you'd be looking at
[2:05:08] something that you can hug, embrace, and
[2:05:11] pray around with.
[2:05:16] And the hornets
[2:05:18] too. You know the
[2:05:20] hornets? Those insects which when they
[2:05:22] bite you they inject poison into you and
[2:05:25] you become so sorry and poisonous.
[2:05:27] Sometimes they can kill
[2:05:29] you. All these killer boos were friends
[2:05:32] with human beings. That's what we had at
[2:05:35] the beginning. And all the wealth of the
[2:05:38] earth belong to man. And dominion in the
[2:05:40] air on earth and in the sea. Everything
[2:05:42] belonged to man. And there was
[2:05:46] harmony. There was
[2:05:49] peace. There was
[2:05:51] harmony. There was a presence of
[2:05:54] God until man lost that estate. The
[2:05:57] devil came and robbed us of that estate.
[2:06:01] Now the Bible in Romans chapter 8, I
[2:06:05] love this scripture. Romans chapter 8
[2:06:06] verse 19. The Bible says for the illness
[2:06:09] expectation of the creature waitth for
[2:06:13] the manifestation of the sons of God. So
[2:06:16] nature is still
[2:06:19] waiting. You see? So the same beautiful
[2:06:21] roses that were in the garden and then
[2:06:25] Madame Eve would go and just you know
[2:06:27] play with the flowers in the garden. The
[2:06:30] same thorns when they when the the
[2:06:32] flowers when Eve sinned they developed
[2:06:39] thorns plants became poisonous now man
[2:06:42] has to choose maybe this one is
[2:06:44] poisonous maybe this one is maybe this
[2:06:46] one is like this this one can kill you
[2:06:48] this one can't keep it never was like
[2:06:49] that there were never thorns there was
[2:06:52] no poison but when she sinned thorns
[2:06:56] developed in the flowers she tried to
[2:06:58] touch the flowers and then ah
[2:07:00] Yes. She looked at the leopard and she
[2:07:03] was like, "Hi, leopard." And then the
[2:07:05] leopard would go into a tree and look at
[2:07:07] her and the leopard sees
[2:07:10] dinner. It looks like if I can just tear
[2:07:13] her up and eat
[2:07:15] her. She comes like a leopard leopard.
[2:07:18] And the leopard is
[2:07:20] like because everything changed when the
[2:07:24] four
[2:07:25] came. There was no harmony anymore.
[2:07:34] Everything was just turned upside
[2:07:36] down. And furthermore, even when the
[2:07:39] human blood fell into the ground, worse
[2:07:42] because the blood speaks. Remember, the
[2:07:44] blood always speaks. The blood of Abel
[2:07:46] started speaking from the ground. And
[2:07:47] think about all the wars and everything
[2:07:49] that has been happening. Blood dripping
[2:07:51] into the earth. The earth
[2:07:53] moans. Blood. Human blood always speaks.
[2:07:59] Because that man was supposed to be the
[2:08:01] king of the whole universe
[2:08:04] as far as the earth is
[2:08:07] concerned. But everything was lost. But
[2:08:10] God said, "I will restore. I will
[2:08:14] restore." And once in a while, the
[2:08:17] presence of God could come down and then
[2:08:20] it would just surround one of his
[2:08:22] people. Like in the days of Noah, you
[2:08:24] see Noah came to the same lions and he
[2:08:28] said, "Lions, come, come, come." And the
[2:08:29] lions were just coming and saying,
[2:08:30] "Okay, where are we going?" Just
[2:08:33] temporarily, but God was proving that
[2:08:36] when he restores, it will be back to
[2:08:39] harmony again.
[2:08:41] It will be back to harmony again. Amen.
[2:08:44] Are we together, church? Yes. Once in a
[2:08:48] while, the presence of the power of God
[2:08:50] that restores. Sometimes it comes and it
[2:08:53] engulfs one of the believers.
[2:08:56] You see, it does that when when Daniel
[2:08:59] was thrown in the den of lions, the
[2:09:01] presence of God just came as it was
[2:09:04] always with Adam and it surrounded
[2:09:06] Daniel. And when they when he was thrown
[2:09:09] into that den and the lions would just
[2:09:11] be like,
[2:09:12] "Oh, oh, what a friend, Daniel. What a
[2:09:16] friend." Temporality. But God was
[2:09:19] showing that he he was showing us the
[2:09:22] believers that he will restore it to
[2:09:24] what it
[2:09:27] was. And when when Jesus Christ came,
[2:09:31] you see the whole
[2:09:32] earth felt a
[2:09:35] difference. Everything within the earth
[2:09:37] and the universe felt a difference
[2:09:38] because he could he could speak to a
[2:09:40] tree and say, "From today onwards, you
[2:09:43] will not give fruit anymore." And then
[2:09:44] the tree would just say, "All right,
[2:09:46] sir. Yes, sir.
[2:09:50] Nature realized that there is somebody
[2:09:52] who looks like Adam. There is somebody
[2:09:55] who speaks like Adam. There is somebody
[2:09:57] who represents God like Adam. And when
[2:10:00] the seas were raging on the sea, there
[2:10:03] were waves going high and low. When
[2:10:05] Jesus Christ woke up from his lips, he
[2:10:08] said,
[2:10:09] "Peace, be still."
[2:10:12] And the water was like, "Oh, he sounds
[2:10:14] like Adam." The water settled down
[2:10:16] again. Why? God was showing us that
[2:10:19] there is a restoration coming. There is
[2:10:22] a restoration coming. And by the grace
[2:10:24] of God, after everything had been lost
[2:10:26] through the ages, we see a man from this
[2:10:28] country.
[2:10:31] This country right here,
[2:10:33] you can actually listen to him speak. We
[2:10:35] know he used to be here. He had a family
[2:10:39] somewhere. I believe most of him know
[2:10:41] him.
[2:10:43] when he was clearing the glass on his
[2:10:45] compound, the
[2:10:47] hornness the hornness came in large
[2:10:51] numbers and they were coming at me and
[2:10:52] he said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,
[2:10:54] sorry. I'm very sorry." And they were
[2:10:57] like, "Oh, he speaks like
[2:10:59] Adam." They he speaks like Adam. And
[2:11:02] they went back to their nest. He says,
[2:11:05] "I don't want to disturb you." And the
[2:11:06] killer boo the killer boo when it met
[2:11:08] him is like, "Okay, I'm going to finish
[2:11:10] this one." It started charging,
[2:11:13] gathering momentum to just hit him and
[2:11:17] then he says, "Sorry, Mr. Boo. Sorry,
[2:11:20] sorry, sorry, sorry. Take take heart.
[2:11:24] I'm going to pray for another creature.
[2:11:27] So, you take heart." And the boo was
[2:11:29] like, "He speaks like Adam. He speaks
[2:11:32] like Adam." And then he
[2:11:33] just he just shrink back.
[2:11:37] You see and that opera psalm it knew
[2:11:42] that there is somebody who can pray for
[2:11:44] me and he himself didn't
[2:11:47] know but the presence of the of the lord
[2:11:50] could be able to whisper to these
[2:11:51] creatures to say that there is a
[2:11:53] restoration coming but the creatures are
[2:11:55] groaning creation is groaning waiting
[2:11:58] for the manifestation of the children of
[2:12:00] God and here was a wounded animal that
[2:12:04] had children to take care of so it went
[2:12:07] to the preacher and the preacher
[2:12:10] prayed. It received baggage healing to
[2:12:14] prove that there will be there will be
[2:12:16] restoration. There will be harmony
[2:12:19] again.
[2:12:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:12:26] And there are so many things that God
[2:12:27] has done with different servants. You
[2:12:29] remember brother when he went in the
[2:12:31] mountain and there was a
[2:12:33] storm. What did he do? He spoke to the
[2:12:36] storm when those little animals that he
[2:12:39] could have killed but he had made a
[2:12:41] promise to God that he will not kill
[2:12:43] more than enough. They found comfort in
[2:12:45] his
[2:12:46] presence. All these are just simple
[2:12:49] examples to tell us that there will be
[2:12:51] harmony again.
[2:12:53] We will be in a millennium again after
[2:12:56] we go in the rapture. After we come
[2:12:58] back, there will be harmony again. Amen.
[2:13:02] So the creation is groaning.
[2:13:05] That's why when they killed Jesus on the
[2:13:09] cross, when they killed him, even the
[2:13:12] earth, it shook.
[2:13:15] The earth was angry. It shook. Rocks
[2:13:18] broke. There was a great earthquake. Why
[2:13:21] have you killed him again? We were
[2:13:23] feeling a little relief. We had a little
[2:13:25] leaf. Why have you killed him again?
[2:13:27] Hallelujah. And it was in the afternoon
[2:13:30] and the sun said, "No, no, no. I'm I'm
[2:13:32] not going to shine again on these
[2:13:33] people." And there was darkness.
[2:13:38] Even the son was angry. Why have you
[2:13:39] killed
[2:13:40] him? There's got to be. But all these
[2:13:43] are just stories to tell. I know there
[2:13:46] are things that God has done in
[2:13:48] different places in the world after
[2:13:49] brother Brandham is gone. But we can all
[2:13:51] agree on what we all know.
[2:13:55] Are we together? Yeah. But there's God
[2:13:58] has done with different other people all
[2:14:00] over the world because there are so many
[2:14:01] children of God on earth that God deals
[2:14:04] with.
[2:14:10] So there will be a restoration
[2:14:14] and there will be a millennium. So that
[2:14:16] is what Adam lost. Are we together?
[2:14:20] But we don't want to just be restored to
[2:14:23] what Adam lost. No. No. No. No. No, we
[2:14:27] want more. Why? Because God when he
[2:14:30] restores, he restores with extras. All
[2:14:33] these other problems that we face on
[2:14:35] earth in the garden of Eden, they never
[2:14:36] started in the Garden of Eden. There was
[2:14:38] something else that happened. There was
[2:14:40] a rebellion in heaven. There was sin
[2:14:43] that came in heaven. There was a battle
[2:14:46] that was fought in heaven. So that
[2:14:49] brought a disturbance. So God will make
[2:14:52] sure that he will not just restore it
[2:14:53] what it was because Adam and Eve were in
[2:14:55] the garden. that the devil was alive. So
[2:14:58] we don't want to have the devil around.
[2:14:59] We want a restoration with extras.
[2:15:02] We don't want temptation to be there. We
[2:15:05] want restoration with extras. So after
[2:15:08] the millennium, there will be a white
[2:15:09] throne judgment and everything that is
[2:15:11] against God will be thrown and destroyed
[2:15:13] in the lake of fire. Then after that,
[2:15:16] remember God would come in the evening
[2:15:18] and go back. He would visit in the
[2:15:19] evening and go back. But that's not what
[2:15:21] we want. After that, the Bible says, "I
[2:15:24] saw a new heaven and a new earth."
[2:15:28] There, there came down from heaven, the
[2:15:31] new Jerusalem, a city, a garden city. It
[2:15:36] came down on earth. And brother Random
[2:15:39] preached the message, the future
[2:15:41] home. It's not like it was in the Garden
[2:15:44] of Eden. It is the future home. The end
[2:15:47] of a thing is always better than the
[2:15:49] beginning of it.
[2:15:51] So God will not be coming and going. No.
[2:15:53] The Bible says God will be with his
[2:15:55] people. He will be in his people. We
[2:15:58] will be living next door to God. We will
[2:16:01] be living in his presence. He will be
[2:16:04] living with us. We will be his people.
[2:16:07] He will be our God. There will not be
[2:16:10] heaven and earth. It will all be one.
[2:16:13] Heaven and earth will embrace. We and
[2:16:15] God will live together forever. Not for
[2:16:19] a thousand years, forever. And that city
[2:16:22] will be a golden city.
[2:16:26] But now God has given a ch a chance to
[2:16:29] have a privilege of living in a golden
[2:16:31] age now. So temporarily we can
[2:16:35] experience the benefits of what is to
[2:16:37] come in a small measure as we are
[2:16:41] looking forward to that. But in a small
[2:16:43] measure we can begin to
[2:16:45] experience like Joshua and Calibb and
[2:16:47] the other they went into the promised
[2:16:49] land. They brought some grapes to prove
[2:16:52] to us that there is more coming. Better
[2:16:56] is the end of a thing than the beginning
[2:16:58] of it. And by the grace of God, I can
[2:17:01] declare to you that your end shall be
[2:17:04] better than your beginning. Your good
[2:17:06] days are still up in front of you. God
[2:17:09] can do a new thing in your life if you
[2:17:12] just only have to trust him. You just
[2:17:14] only have to believe him. And in there,
[2:17:18] everything that all the children of God
[2:17:20] ever lost will be given to them. And it
[2:17:23] was given to brother Brana as a promise.
[2:17:25] All that you love, all that ever loved
[2:17:27] you will be given to you. Think about
[2:17:29] it. All that he loved and everything
[2:17:31] else will be given to. And that is not
[2:17:32] the promise just to one person. Is a
[2:17:35] promise to all the children of God. All
[2:17:37] that you love, all that ever loved you
[2:17:41] will be given to you. It's a it's an
[2:17:44] unfailing promise of God. You love the
[2:17:47] Lord.
[2:17:49] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:17:52] But what can we do today? We can just
[2:17:55] reinforce the promise of God upon the
[2:17:57] things that the devil has robbed us in
[2:17:59] our lives.
[2:18:02] Amen.
[2:18:04] God bless you.
[2:18:06] I don't know if you know that
[2:18:08] song. Uh well, I'll ask the pastor to
[2:18:11] come and pray for us, but I don't know
[2:18:13] if you know that song that says
[2:18:16] um you deserve the glory. God deserves
[2:18:19] the
[2:18:20] glory. You deserve the

[2:20:37] time. You deserve the

[2:21:17] worship as we bless your holy name. For
