[46:46] good friends
[46:47] who uh usually we we go to uh the the uh
[46:52] grace ministries in hopkins
[46:54] but i thought it's nice to have
[46:56] fellowship
[46:57] with believers from everywhere
[47:00] so i wanted to introduce them to you
[47:02] folks up here
[47:04] and so i uh
[47:06] i brought them along and rachel said to
[47:07] me yeah but what if what if they ask you
[47:09] to preach
[47:11] you're like
[47:13] well okay if they asked me to preach i i
[47:16] and and as i was driving up i was i just
[47:19] getting this these thoughts about this
[47:22] um
[47:23] this message that i'm going to preach
[47:24] today and i was like oh boy
[47:27] so i i sat in the back with my kids and
[47:30] every time the door opened i was all
[47:31] kind of nervous that would be someone
[47:33] being like
[47:34] brother terry you wanted to preach and
[47:36] it's like okay
[47:37] and then brother dan preached and i was
[47:39] like wow what a blessing
[47:41] you know it's nice to come and to be
[47:43] blessed
[47:44] by someone else ministering and that was
[47:46] a really good service i've really
[47:48] enjoyed it what a blessing to have his
[47:50] ministry here it's like ah that's good
[47:54] and so i left
[47:57] and the next day
[47:58] and i knew brother one had gone to to to
[48:01] liberia and the next day he called me
[48:03] he's like uh
[48:05] yeah it's funny i was going to call you
[48:06] and ask you to preach on on sunday so
[48:09] here i am again
[48:11] so
[48:12] we're trusting that the lord will bless
[48:14] us today
[48:16] despite the weaknesses and the
[48:19] the issues that we have we rely on him
[48:22] so
[48:23] uh so i want to uh
[48:27] i want to ask you to stand with me and
[48:30] and we'll start in ephesians chapter 2
[48:33] and then we'll go to revelations chapter
[48:35] 20
[48:37] one and uh lord willing we'll get a
[48:39] little something that will encourage us
[48:42] that will bring us a step closer to god
[48:44] that will help us in our walk in this
[48:46] life
[48:48] so in ephesians
[48:50] uh chapter 22
[48:54] uh sorry in ephesians chapter 2 verse 11
[48:58] to 22
[48:59] therefore remember that ye being in
[49:02] times past gentiles in the flesh who are
[49:05] called uncircumcision by that which is
[49:07] called the circumcision in the flesh
[49:10] made by hands
[49:11] that at that time you were without
[49:13] christ
[49:14] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[49:16] israel
[49:18] and strangers from the covenant of
[49:20] promise having no hope
[49:22] and without god
[49:24] in the world
[49:25] but now
[49:26] in christ jesus ye who were sometimes
[49:29] were
[49:30] far off are made nigh
[49:32] by the blood of christ for he is our
[49:35] peace
[49:36] who hath made both one
[49:39] and that broken down the middle wall of
[49:41] partition between us having abolished in
[49:44] his flesh the enmity even the law of
[49:47] commandments contained in the ordinance
[49:50] for to make in himself of twain one new
[49:53] man
[49:54] so making peace
[49:56] that he might reconcile both unto god in
[49:59] one body by the flesh having slain the
[50:02] enmity thereof and came and preached
[50:05] peace to you which were afar off and to
[50:07] them that when i
[50:09] for through him we both have access by
[50:12] one spirit unto the father
[50:14] now therefore
[50:16] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[50:19] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[50:21] of the household of god and are built
[50:24] upon the foundation
[50:26] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[50:29] christ himself being the chief
[50:31] cornerstone in whom all the building
[50:34] fitly framed together groweth
[50:36] unto a holy temple in the lord
[50:39] in whom ye are also building together
[50:42] for an inhabitation
[50:44] of god
[50:46] through the spirit amen
[50:48] wonderful wonderful scripture let's just
[50:50] turn to uh revelations 21 we'll just
[50:53] take one verse there
[51:02] and it says in verse 16
[51:05] and the city
[51:06] lieth
[51:07] four square
[51:10] let's pray
[51:11] heavenly father we pray you be with us
[51:13] today we pray you'd speak to us we pray
[51:16] that something would bring us one step
[51:18] closer to you that there'd be
[51:21] encouragement for somebody that there
[51:23] would be correction for somebody that
[51:25] there would be new life for somebody
[51:27] lord for we've been built
[51:30] into your image
[51:31] into a dwelling place for you
[51:34] may today lord a few more bricks be laid
[51:36] may today our foundations be made more
[51:39] secure may today something happen that
[51:42] we could be a more suitable dwelling
[51:44] place for you we ask in jesus name
[51:47] amen
[51:48] you may take your seats
[51:50] okay
[51:51] and so today
[51:53] i would like to talk about
[51:55] four square
[51:57] okay four square we are
[51:59] we we are going to a city
[52:04] that's four square
[52:07] what does that mean
[52:08] what does it mean to be four square
[52:11] well we're going to have a little look
[52:13] in the scripture and we're going to find
[52:14] out that four square is the meeting
[52:17] place
[52:18] of god and man it's where god and man
[52:21] come together
[52:22] because that word foursquare you can
[52:25] find it in the bible in the new
[52:27] testament associated
[52:29] with
[52:30] the the new jerusalem that comes down
[52:33] and the new jerusalem is the bride
[52:36] john says that
[52:38] okay and so the bride is the people of
[52:41] god the dwelling place of god and you
[52:43] can find that same word foursquare in
[52:46] the old testament and you know in the
[52:48] old testament that word
[52:50] in hebrew is only associated with the
[52:53] tabernacle in the temple
[52:55] it's associated with the tabernacle of
[52:57] moses it's associated and describes the
[53:01] temple of solomon and it's associated
[53:03] and it describes the temple that ezekiel
[53:07] saw
[53:08] so it's a special place a word for a
[53:11] special place a word for dwelling
[53:14] together with god four square and so
[53:16] today i want us to be not denominational
[53:20] foursquare church
[53:22] okay they're still here they're still
[53:24] ministering they're still bringing
[53:26] people closer to jesus and we should
[53:28] support anybody
[53:30] that is bringing people one step closer
[53:32] to jesus amen we don't want to say
[53:35] anything bad about anyone
[53:37] if they can get people one step closer
[53:39] to jesus because if you can get people
[53:41] one step closer to the lord jesus you're
[53:45] getting them one step closer to life and
[53:47] who cares how that comes about
[53:49] amen we should support you know those
[53:51] jehovah witnesses that go around those
[53:54] mormons that go around those people that
[53:56] go around they they speak the name of
[53:59] jesus to people may the lord bless them
[54:02] okay we can disagree with them on on
[54:05] little bits and pieces but if they can
[54:07] reach someone and start them on a trail
[54:09] to bring them to jesus that's a
[54:11] wonderful thing
[54:13] amen and so we don't want to be
[54:15] denominational foursquare but today i
[54:18] want us to consider being a little more
[54:21] four square christians
[54:23] and i'm going to show you what that
[54:25] means in the scripture to be a four
[54:27] squares christian because we're being
[54:30] built
[54:31] into
[54:32] the dwelling place of god and i want to
[54:35] ask you
[54:36] this morning where are you
[54:39] on this journey
[54:42] where are you and what's your next step
[54:45] what's the next thing that god is
[54:47] building in your life how is god
[54:50] constructing you to be a more effective
[54:53] christian to be a better dwelling place
[54:56] you know it's wonderful to come here and
[54:58] and um
[55:01] and and see the difference in the church
[55:04] you see
[55:05] uh and and when i first came here you
[55:08] had if i recall correctly you had a
[55:10] little tile entryway and then you had
[55:12] carpet and then you had tile in the back
[55:13] in the entryway
[55:15] it was something like that
[55:17] yeah and now you've got that really nice
[55:19] laminate floor it looks so nice
[55:22] okay yeah
[55:23] and and uh this this area you've you've
[55:27] taken down the the little pasta room at
[55:29] the back and moved it and and it's a
[55:31] more comfortable place and there's more
[55:33] space for people on the inside and
[55:35] there's a continual growing and a
[55:37] continual changing to make it better
[55:41] more suitable for purpose
[55:44] and you're the dwelling place of god
[55:47] and god is constantly changing you and
[55:50] changing a little bit here and a little
[55:51] bit there maybe putting up a fresh coat
[55:54] of paint but why to make you
[55:57] a better dwelling place for him that's
[56:00] what we want to be today is a better
[56:02] dwelling place for him and so i want to
[56:04] talk about that that way that god
[56:07] progresses through our lives the and
[56:10] it's the same way that god progresses
[56:12] through the salvation of a soul is the
[56:14] same way it's he works in the same
[56:16] pattern for the salvation of israel he
[56:18] works in the same pattern for the the
[56:20] redemption of the whole world
[56:23] okay that tabernacle we're going to look
[56:26] at foursquare we're going to ask
[56:28] ourselves where are we at in our journey
[56:30] with god
[56:31] and there's always a place where we can
[56:33] improve but we're going to start with
[56:35] the first
[56:36] uh if if you go into the tabernacle and
[56:39] the first thing that you would see in
[56:41] the wilderness was that fence
[56:43] surrounding the tabernacle and you would
[56:45] go into the gate and right before you
[56:47] what was there
[56:49] somebody
[56:52] just want to make sure you're awake
[56:55] what was the first thing in the
[56:57] tabernacle as you went in through the
[56:59] gates
[57:03] the it was the brass altar
[57:05] it was the altar of burnt offering
[57:08] okay
[57:09] so let's have a look at that that's in
[57:11] exodus chapter 27 we're going to look at
[57:14] this and this is the first thing that
[57:15] you would see
[57:16] that was four square
[57:33] all right
[57:37] 27.1
[57:39] now shall make an altar of and woot
[57:42] five cubits long
[57:44] and five cubits brought
[57:46] the altar
[57:48] shall be four square
[57:50] and the height thereof shall be three
[57:51] cubits
[57:52] and so that four square four square is
[57:55] the meeting place between god and man
[57:59] okay how many know what a cuba is
[58:03] okay a cubit is a space between your
[58:06] elbow and the end of your fingers
[58:09] so it's about a foot and a half
[58:11] okay
[58:12] so that's a cubit
[58:14] and so this is five cubits long
[58:18] all right
[58:19] so it's about seven and a half feet long
[58:22] it's it's bigger than my arm i'm quite a
[58:24] big person and
[58:26] you know it's bigger than my wingspan is
[58:29] all right
[58:30] and it's three cubits high
[58:32] and it's the first meeting place between
[58:35] god and man
[58:37] and what's it there for
[58:39] it's there
[58:40] to provide the place for atonement from
[58:43] sin it's there that people would bring
[58:45] in their sacrifices their offerings it
[58:48] would that would be that would be killed
[58:50] and the blood would be poured out and
[58:52] sprinkled on the altar and the
[58:55] offering would be laid on the altar and
[58:58] the fumes of it would go up to heaven
[59:01] it was brass covered in wood and wood
[59:04] speaks of humanity and that brass speaks
[59:07] of judgment and so it's the place where
[59:09] we come and you can't come to god
[59:13] without coming to the place of judgment
[59:15] first without coming to the place of
[59:17] sacrifice first without coming to that
[59:20] place where you lay down your life and
[59:22] you say
[59:23] i've got nothing to give you
[59:25] i have to die to myself and take on i
[59:28] have to claim
[59:30] that i can't go any further
[59:33] in my relationship with god
[59:36] except
[59:37] by the blood
[59:39] of a sacrifice
[59:41] okay
[59:42] i can't claim sin
[59:45] uh forgiveness
[59:47] for myself except by the blood of a
[59:49] sacrifice
[59:51] and that sacrifices jesus christ for us
[59:54] we don't have to bring an ox or a lamb
[59:56] to the to the tabernacle every day
[59:59] but we do have to die daily we do have
[1:00:02] to bring the sacrifice of jesus christ
[1:00:05] every day
[1:00:07] you see
[1:00:08] don't forget this is justification but
[1:00:11] this has to happen every day in our
[1:00:13] lives
[1:00:15] okay what's god dealing with you is he
[1:00:17] dealing with you on some sin that you
[1:00:19] haven't died to self yet that you
[1:00:22] haven't covered with the blood of jesus
[1:00:24] christ i guarantee that he's dealing
[1:00:26] with that with something in your life
[1:00:30] so and and when he's dealing with that
[1:00:32] with you
[1:00:34] you won't be able to go any further
[1:00:38] until you've got past the altar of
[1:00:39] sacrifice
[1:00:41] that first meeting place of god and man
[1:00:44] and you know some people they get to the
[1:00:45] altar of sacrifice and they sacrifice
[1:00:48] and they're justified
[1:00:50] and then they turn around
[1:00:52] and they leave
[1:00:53] and they don't go any deeper and you
[1:00:55] know what that's fine
[1:00:57] that's fine everybody that their people
[1:01:00] are called to different places in god's
[1:01:02] economy
[1:01:04] okay
[1:01:05] and and the bible says that whosoever
[1:01:08] shall call on the name of the lord shall
[1:01:10] be saved
[1:01:11] okay
[1:01:12] i believe there's a lot more people
[1:01:14] saved
[1:01:15] than we would think you know why because
[1:01:18] i've said it before and i'll say it
[1:01:20] again because i believe it
[1:01:22] god loves life
[1:01:25] and the bible tells us he's not willing
[1:01:27] that the
[1:01:29] sinner perish
[1:01:31] so he's going to bring
[1:01:33] whoever he can into life by whatever
[1:01:36] means he can okay
[1:01:46] oh god bless him there's there's a
[1:01:48] brother in africa
[1:01:50] zimbabwe god went to cindy
[1:01:53] i don't know if any of you have ever met
[1:01:55] him
[1:01:56] you've met brother godwin
[1:01:58] that's wonderful his testimony was
[1:02:01] he was traveling
[1:02:03] to
[1:02:04] become to terrorist training
[1:02:07] uh yeah when when the uh british
[1:02:11] controlled or the the white folks
[1:02:13] controlled rhodesia
[1:02:15] before it became zimbabwe and so there
[1:02:17] were terrorist cells trying to overthrow
[1:02:20] the minority government and he was
[1:02:22] traveling there and he said
[1:02:25] he was waiting at the airport there was
[1:02:27] a tent he didn't have anything else to
[1:02:29] do so he went in it was a gospel tent
[1:02:32] and the preacher was preaching
[1:02:34] and the preacher said
[1:02:36] uh is anyone here want to accept jesus
[1:02:40] and he said well i sat there and i
[1:02:42] thought
[1:02:43] i don't have anything against this jesus
[1:02:46] so he put up his hand okay
[1:02:49] and his life changed from that moment on
[1:02:51] you see
[1:02:52] all right
[1:02:54] now now he's a brother that's gone on in
[1:02:56] the lord he didn't just stop at the
[1:02:58] altar and then walk out again he's a
[1:03:00] real blessed minister of god all right
[1:03:04] but you see how simple it is
[1:03:07] i i was talking um to to a good friend
[1:03:10] of mine in england andrew wilson
[1:03:13] and he said he he was he was a uh he did
[1:03:17] drugs and he did uh he did different
[1:03:20] things he said then his mother was a was
[1:03:23] a a uh
[1:03:25] was a drunk and she drank and she fell
[1:03:27] down the stairs
[1:03:29] and they called him and his brother in
[1:03:31] from the hotel where they were working
[1:03:33] they said you need to come and see her
[1:03:35] went to the hospital and the doctor said
[1:03:37] you know you need to go home and any
[1:03:39] moment we may be giving you a call to
[1:03:41] come and spend your last few minutes
[1:03:44] with your mother
[1:03:45] and he said he went home
[1:03:48] and he said
[1:03:49] uh he and his brother started smoking
[1:03:52] drugs
[1:03:53] and he said but he he wasn't getting a
[1:03:55] high out of it he was just and he said
[1:03:59] that something
[1:04:00] he said god
[1:04:02] take my life and spare my mother's life
[1:04:05] okay
[1:04:07] and he was sharing his testimony at that
[1:04:09] point i said what do you think
[1:04:12] god because at that point was where he
[1:04:15] started to become a christian where god
[1:04:17] start it's like god took him at his word
[1:04:19] he took his life as a christian spared
[1:04:21] his mother's life his mother recovered
[1:04:24] and so it's just in little things like
[1:04:26] that and how many little things are
[1:04:27] happening to people
[1:04:29] you see that we overlook that god says
[1:04:32] for this i'll bring you into life
[1:04:35] i can jesus listen jesus owns the whole
[1:04:38] world he paid for the whole world
[1:04:41] all right
[1:04:42] so he can do what he wants with it
[1:04:45] and so if he wants to save everybody he
[1:04:48] could do that
[1:04:49] i actually believe
[1:04:51] you don't have to accept jesus to be
[1:04:55] saved
[1:04:56] you have to reject jesus
[1:04:58] to be lost
[1:05:00] okay
[1:05:03] all right yeah
[1:05:04] so because otherwise
[1:05:06] children why how could they be saved
[1:05:08] because they've never had the chance to
[1:05:10] accept jesus
[1:05:11] but they're saved because they never
[1:05:13] have the chance to reject jesus and so
[1:05:15] as jesus is working in your life step by
[1:05:18] step by step make sure you never reject
[1:05:20] him okay but we want to get beyond
[1:05:24] the altar
[1:05:26] of burnt offering
[1:05:28] you come to the altar for
[1:05:30] forgiveness of sins but it doesn't do
[1:05:32] too much for you spiritually you have to
[1:05:34] go further in
[1:05:36] but it is the place between life and
[1:05:38] death
[1:05:39] but as we pass beyond the altar
[1:05:42] and we go through and we go to the lava
[1:05:45] the brass lava where you wash
[1:05:47] okay a basin of water
[1:05:49] and then before you
[1:05:51] is the actual tabernacle the sanctuary
[1:05:55] and only priests could go in
[1:05:59] and when the priests went inside there
[1:06:00] were three
[1:06:01] pieces of furniture on the inside
[1:06:04] there was the table of showbread
[1:06:07] there was the candlestick
[1:06:10] and there was the altar of incense
[1:06:13] okay let's read about the altar of
[1:06:14] incense
[1:06:16] exodus 30.
[1:06:28] it says and thou shall make an altar to
[1:06:29] burn incenser there upon
[1:06:32] of and wood shall thy make it a
[1:06:34] cubit shall be the length thereof and a
[1:06:37] cubit the breadth thereof
[1:06:39] four square shall it be
[1:06:41] and two cubits shall be the height
[1:06:42] thereof the horns thereof shall be of
[1:06:44] the same and thou shalt overlay it with
[1:06:47] pure gold
[1:06:49] okay
[1:06:51] and so now we're into the sanctuary
[1:06:53] we're into the spiritual realm and
[1:06:55] here's the next place
[1:06:57] of communion between god and man the
[1:07:00] next altar and it's the altar of incense
[1:07:04] and that's the place of prayer
[1:07:07] okay it's not for everybody it's not for
[1:07:10] somebody just who has their sins
[1:07:12] forgiven
[1:07:13] but it's somebody who's had their sins
[1:07:15] forgiven and has entered into a
[1:07:18] relationship with god as a king and a
[1:07:20] priest that priestly relationship with
[1:07:23] god
[1:07:24] okay that sanctification they have they
[1:07:27] had certain garments that they had to
[1:07:29] wear
[1:07:30] all right
[1:07:31] those garments were white and they were
[1:07:33] made of linen
[1:07:35] oh it's just wonderful do you know the
[1:07:37] word sweat only appears three times in
[1:07:39] the bible
[1:07:42] okay sweat
[1:07:44] oh it's so interesting i don't think
[1:07:47] i've ever all right so sweat appears in
[1:07:50] genesis where he says
[1:07:52] listen by the sweat
[1:07:54] of your brow
[1:07:56] you will
[1:07:57] eat you'll make bread
[1:08:00] okay
[1:08:01] and the second time it appears
[1:08:04] is
[1:08:05] in ezekiel where it says the priests
[1:08:08] wore linen garments
[1:08:10] so that they wouldn't sweat in the
[1:08:13] service of god
[1:08:15] okay
[1:08:16] and the third time
[1:08:19] is jesus sweat
[1:08:21] drops of blood for us okay and so if you
[1:08:25] think of that
[1:08:27] oh my
[1:08:29] what are we offering to god
[1:08:31] because if you're offering your works
[1:08:33] you're doing what cain did he said i am
[1:08:36] going to work so hard i'm gonna get the
[1:08:38] food i'm gonna plow it i'm gonna and
[1:08:40] i'll have enough that i can offer the
[1:08:43] food a surplus that he offered to the
[1:08:45] fruits of the ground
[1:08:46] okay i'm fulfilling your word god i'm
[1:08:49] doing the works and here are the extra
[1:08:51] works to offer to you
[1:08:54] and god says why are you offering me
[1:08:57] a bunch of sweat
[1:09:00] you see
[1:09:02] and he said if you're a priest i don't
[1:09:05] want the sweat because it's not about
[1:09:06] your work
[1:09:08] you see it's not about your work but we
[1:09:11] come with the blood of jesus christ we
[1:09:13] come with his work
[1:09:16] and we don't offer any of our own sweat
[1:09:18] it's not of our own works
[1:09:20] okay
[1:09:21] and so we say not by my works do i enter
[1:09:24] into this priestly relationship but
[1:09:27] based on the blood of jesus christ i
[1:09:29] sanctify myself i purify myself i put on
[1:09:32] the garments of holiness i separate
[1:09:34] myself from this world
[1:09:37] and i come before you
[1:09:39] to the next altar that's four square
[1:09:42] to the altar of incense
[1:09:45] and i offer the incense and when i offer
[1:09:48] the incense
[1:09:49] i offer my prayers up
[1:09:51] prayers for the nation prayers for
[1:09:54] people prayers like we've done lord how
[1:09:56] do i serve you prayers to purify myself
[1:10:01] okay
[1:10:03] but we find
[1:10:04] we can be priests and kings why because
[1:10:07] jesus
[1:10:08] broke down every war and read it in
[1:10:10] ephesians he broke down every wall of
[1:10:12] partition
[1:10:14] do you know and they've actually
[1:10:16] discovered this
[1:10:17] they've discovered marker stones
[1:10:20] in archaeological digs
[1:10:22] in jerusalem
[1:10:24] and the markers don't say
[1:10:27] gentiles
[1:10:29] do not proceed beyond this point
[1:10:32] and then marcus stone surrounded
[1:10:35] the core
[1:10:36] of the gentiles
[1:10:38] in the in the temple grounds
[1:10:40] so the gentiles could come into the
[1:10:42] temple grounds and they could see the
[1:10:44] temple but there was a certain marker
[1:10:46] they they couldn't go beyond or it would
[1:10:48] cause a riot now you remember it caused
[1:10:51] the riot because uh the the the jews saw
[1:10:54] paul
[1:10:55] in the temple with a couple of other
[1:10:57] people and they assumed hey he's brought
[1:10:59] temp he's brought gentiles into the
[1:11:01] temple grounds
[1:11:03] okay
[1:11:04] and it caused a big riot
[1:11:07] and so they've actually found those
[1:11:09] marker stones uh
[1:11:10] gentiles can't go beyond this point
[1:11:13] and then we know that the the jew could
[1:11:16] go
[1:11:17] into the
[1:11:19] uh into the the outer court if you like
[1:11:21] that that temple by the brass altar the
[1:11:24] by the but he couldn't go inside the
[1:11:26] temple why that was reserved for the
[1:11:28] priests
[1:11:30] okay
[1:11:33] but god has broken down that because
[1:11:35] he's made us priests and kings through
[1:11:38] his blood so we can enter into this and
[1:11:41] we know that in the holy places of all
[1:11:44] only the high priest could enter
[1:11:48] and only once a year
[1:11:51] right okay but we know at the death of
[1:11:53] jesus
[1:11:54] that veil was rent from the top to the
[1:11:56] bottom
[1:12:00] do you know what was in there the holy
[1:12:02] place of all
[1:12:04] when it was rent from the top to the
[1:12:05] bottom it was rent from the top to the
[1:12:07] bottom and what did it reveal what was
[1:12:09] behind there
[1:12:12] anyone know
[1:12:15] who said the ark
[1:12:20] it was not the ark
[1:12:24] it was not the ark because at the time
[1:12:27] they did not have possession of the ark
[1:12:29] of the covenant
[1:12:31] okay
[1:12:33] yeah it's really interesting and the
[1:12:35] tradition says at the time of offering
[1:12:39] that high priest
[1:12:40] would go into the holiest place of all
[1:12:43] and he would sprinkle the blood on the
[1:12:45] stone that was set there
[1:12:47] which stone they said was a stone that
[1:12:49] jacob
[1:12:51] it was either the stone that jacob laid
[1:12:52] on it was the stone that abraham was to
[1:12:55] offer
[1:12:56] isaac on
[1:12:58] but they didn't have the ark why didn't
[1:13:00] they have the ark because god wrote it
[1:13:02] was empty on the inside where was the
[1:13:04] ark hanging on the cross the meeting
[1:13:06] place
[1:13:07] between god and man
[1:13:09] you see
[1:13:12] so
[1:13:13] but anyway we're still at the uh we're
[1:13:15] still at the place
[1:13:17] uh the altar of incense and this is the
[1:13:19] place where god can really speak to you
[1:13:22] and we can see this in luke chapter one
[1:13:24] so interesting
[1:13:26] okay
[1:13:38] okay there was this is from verse five
[1:13:40] there was in the days of herod the king
[1:13:42] of judea a certain priest named
[1:13:44] zacharias of the course of abia his wife
[1:13:48] was of the daughters of aaron her name
[1:13:49] was elizabeth and they were both
[1:13:51] righteous before god walking in all the
[1:13:53] commandments and ordinances of the lord
[1:13:56] blameless they had no child because that
[1:13:58] elizabeth was barren and they were both
[1:14:00] now well stricken in years
[1:14:03] and it came to pass that while he
[1:14:04] executed the priest's office before god
[1:14:08] in the order of his course and they say
[1:14:10] that there were enough priests that you
[1:14:13] may only go to the temple for one
[1:14:16] period of service
[1:14:18] that's the order of his course
[1:14:20] okay
[1:14:22] and so then they would draw lots to say
[1:14:24] which priest does which duty
[1:14:27] okay according to the customer of the
[1:14:29] priest office his lot was to burn
[1:14:32] incense when he went into the temple of
[1:14:34] the lord and the whole multitude of the
[1:14:37] people
[1:14:38] were praying without at the time of
[1:14:39] incense and appeared unto him an angel
[1:14:42] of the lord standing on the right side
[1:14:45] of the altar of incense
[1:14:47] and gabriel came to start that whole
[1:14:49] process
[1:14:51] of announcing
[1:14:53] there's a forerunner coming call his
[1:14:55] name john
[1:14:56] and he's gonna
[1:14:58] he's gonna make he's gonna prepare the
[1:15:00] way of the lord
[1:15:02] you see
[1:15:03] and he appeared at the altar of incense
[1:15:06] right in front of the veil the closest
[1:15:09] that any priest could get
[1:15:12] to the place of the presence of god
[1:15:15] and so we're also called to be at the
[1:15:17] altar of incense
[1:15:19] daily you know that that those prayers
[1:15:22] that that was a morning and an evening
[1:15:26] place of a burning of incense
[1:15:31] okay
[1:15:33] read your bible pray every day
[1:15:36] pray without ceasing be in communion
[1:15:38] with god be listening to god
[1:15:41] be aware
[1:15:43] that the place of prayer is the place
[1:15:45] where god can send angels
[1:15:47] to speak to you
[1:15:49] okay
[1:15:50] the place where god
[1:15:52] interacts with us the place of communion
[1:15:55] with god
[1:15:57] you see
[1:15:59] so
[1:16:00] are you at that place
[1:16:02] are you listening to what god is telling
[1:16:04] you to do
[1:16:06] and that's wonderful if you do and and
[1:16:09] and if you are at that place remember he
[1:16:11] would not have come to that place except
[1:16:14] that he'd gone past the altar
[1:16:17] the brass ultra and made sure that he
[1:16:19] was cleansed from his sin in order to
[1:16:21] enter in
[1:16:23] all right
[1:16:25] but there's one more place we can go to
[1:16:27] inside the temple that's four square
[1:16:29] in the holiest place of all
[1:16:32] all right and that room was four square
[1:16:34] it was 15 cubits by 15 cubits in the
[1:16:36] tabernacle
[1:16:41] but
[1:16:43] there's one item that god made
[1:16:47] in there
[1:16:49] that's four square oh
[1:16:51] you know what it is
[1:16:55] well let's have a read
[1:16:58] in exodus
[1:17:00] chapter 25
[1:17:02] sorry 28 exodus 28.
[1:17:26] all right verse
[1:17:28] 15.
[1:17:32] it says now shall make the breastplate
[1:17:34] of judgment with cunning work
[1:17:37] after the work of the ephod shall thou
[1:17:39] make it of gold and blue and of purple
[1:17:42] and of scarless and a fine twined linen
[1:17:46] shall thou make it
[1:17:47] four square
[1:17:49] it shall be being doubled a span shall
[1:17:52] be the length thereof
[1:17:53] that's that's a span so it's just just a
[1:17:56] small thing so we've gone from something
[1:17:59] that's
[1:18:00] five cubits
[1:18:02] to something that's two cubits
[1:18:05] to something that's just a span
[1:18:07] you see
[1:18:11] but this isn't something
[1:18:13] that's a piece of furniture that stays
[1:18:17] in the holy place
[1:18:19] this is the garment of the high priest
[1:18:22] that he wears into the holy place
[1:18:25] and then when he leaves the holy place
[1:18:28] he takes the breastplate with him
[1:18:31] four square
[1:18:34] brothers and sisters if you can ever get
[1:18:35] beyond justification
[1:18:38] and beyond sanctification in a place of
[1:18:40] prayer and into that holy of holy place
[1:18:43] into that secret chamber where god
[1:18:46] blesses you when you go out
[1:18:49] you will carry the presence of god with
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:52] you see
[1:18:54] you will carry the presence of god with
[1:18:56] you
[1:18:57] and that
[1:18:59] well you know how david was running from
[1:19:01] saul and and he would have a decision
[1:19:03] and he'd say bring heather the ephod
[1:19:05] because saul had killed all the priests
[1:19:08] and so david the the priest took the
[1:19:11] ephod you can read this in the scripture
[1:19:13] he took that ephod he took that
[1:19:15] breastplate and he ran to david and he
[1:19:17] said saul's going to kill me if he finds
[1:19:18] me i'm going to stay with you
[1:19:21] and david said i have the presence of
[1:19:23] god with me now
[1:19:25] i have the presence of god with me now
[1:19:28] and when when uh when things would go
[1:19:30] wrong he would say bring him the effort
[1:19:32] let's inquire of god and he would ask
[1:19:35] and the priest would tell him well this
[1:19:37] or that
[1:19:38] you see
[1:19:39] because if you take that breastplate out
[1:19:42] with you you're taking out with you the
[1:19:44] dwelling place of god that meeting place
[1:19:46] of god is now in you and you truly
[1:19:49] become that tabernacle of god
[1:19:52] you see and that's what he's building us
[1:19:54] up into
[1:19:58] god enthroned in our hearts because
[1:20:00] jesus broke down
[1:20:02] being partitioned the the partitions
[1:20:05] between us
[1:20:09] and we become the throne of god
[1:20:13] so
[1:20:15] now i got a little more if you want me
[1:20:17] to go on
[1:20:19] okay i got a little more
[1:20:22] all right
[1:20:25] so
[1:20:26] when with the throne of god
[1:20:29] god
[1:20:30] should
[1:20:33] flow out from us
[1:20:36] as he flows out from his throne
[1:20:40] so we should be
[1:20:42] the representative of god
[1:20:45] in this world we should be the meeting
[1:20:47] place where
[1:20:48] it should be
[1:20:50] god bless you
[1:20:52] i'm meeting god
[1:20:53] when i'm meeting you
[1:20:55] you see that should be us
[1:20:58] if we can make our lives if we can now
[1:21:02] we don't get away from saying we need
[1:21:04] that brass altar we need that
[1:21:05] forgiveness of sins that never leaves
[1:21:08] oh that's a big part of our life you
[1:21:10] tell me uh if if confessing your sins
[1:21:14] and asking for your forgiveness is not a
[1:21:17] big part of your life it's not a big
[1:21:19] square that's seven and a half feet by
[1:21:21] seven and a half feet
[1:21:23] you're probably not in the right
[1:21:25] tabernacle
[1:21:26] because the closer you get to god the
[1:21:28] more you realize the further you are
[1:21:30] from god
[1:21:31] okay and so we never lose that necessity
[1:21:34] of meeting god at the brass altar of
[1:21:37] forgiveness
[1:21:39] okay
[1:21:41] and then the next you never lose that
[1:21:42] prayer life
[1:21:44] okay
[1:21:45] praying for others bringing your incense
[1:21:47] before god morning and evening
[1:21:50] in that secret place
[1:21:52] it may not be such a big part of your
[1:21:54] life time wise but that's where god is
[1:21:57] speaking to you
[1:21:59] okay
[1:22:00] but we want to get into the inner place
[1:22:02] where we can carry something out with us
[1:22:04] to be a blessing to the people we're the
[1:22:07] throne of god
[1:22:08] now the throne of god
[1:22:10] uh
[1:22:12] is surrounded by the cherubims
[1:22:15] okay
[1:22:16] the cherubims
[1:22:18] that's the lion spirit
[1:22:20] the man spirit
[1:22:22] the old spirit and the eagle spirit
[1:22:24] we're all aware of that yeah
[1:22:26] and these are the ways that god speaks
[1:22:28] and god acts in the world
[1:22:30] with the boldness of a lion
[1:22:33] with the cunning
[1:22:35] the intelligence be wiser serpents and
[1:22:38] harmless as doves yeah of a man
[1:22:41] with the sight
[1:22:43] of the eagle
[1:22:44] and with the service
[1:22:46] of an ox
[1:22:48] okay
[1:22:49] and so we're called to
[1:22:52] to be
[1:22:55] the place where god flows out in these
[1:22:57] ways but the wisdom is
[1:23:00] well there's a couple of things here
[1:23:02] first of all the devil loves to
[1:23:04] impersonate you
[1:23:06] all right
[1:23:07] let's turn to daniel chapter seven
[1:23:19] and we'll see the symbols that the devil
[1:23:21] comes in
[1:23:25] all right
[1:23:30] and this is uh daniel's vision of the
[1:23:32] four great beasts or the world powers
[1:23:33] that would would be in control of the
[1:23:35] world until the time of the end
[1:23:38] says uh
[1:23:39] daniel spake verse two i saw in my
[1:23:42] visions by night and behold
[1:23:44] the four winds of the heavens strove
[1:23:46] upon the great sea and four great beasts
[1:23:48] came up from the sea diverse one from
[1:23:50] another the first was like a lion and
[1:23:54] had eagle's wings and i beheld to the
[1:23:57] wings thereof were plucked and it was
[1:23:59] lifted up from the earth and made to
[1:24:00] stand upon the feet as a man and a man's
[1:24:03] heart was given to it there's the
[1:24:05] antichrist spirit
[1:24:07] coming as a lion
[1:24:09] an eagle and a man
[1:24:12] what's he missing
[1:24:14] the ox
[1:24:17] okay
[1:24:19] do you want something that's brand new
[1:24:21] well at least i mean listen all of this
[1:24:22] stuff is is is
[1:24:24] as ancient as the bible is and as i'm
[1:24:27] changing but sometimes god just dropped
[1:24:29] something in
[1:24:30] okay
[1:24:31] this this just came uh
[1:24:34] all right
[1:24:36] so the devil likes to impersonate the
[1:24:38] lion the boldness of the lion
[1:24:41] the devil likes to impersonate the sight
[1:24:43] of an eagle and come with that false
[1:24:45] prophet and the false prophecy and be
[1:24:47] thus saith the lord and and and take the
[1:24:49] names lord in vain if that really is
[1:24:52] taking the laid name the name of the
[1:24:54] lord in vain
[1:24:55] telling people false things in the name
[1:24:57] of the lord
[1:24:58] all right great judgment is upon those
[1:25:01] people
[1:25:02] okay coming with the wisdom as a man to
[1:25:05] to subtly deceive
[1:25:08] but i i used to think he never comes as
[1:25:10] an ox
[1:25:12] never because he never comes as a
[1:25:14] servant as a service
[1:25:17] okay
[1:25:18] but then i saw something i said ah
[1:25:20] that's
[1:25:22] where the false spirit
[1:25:24] appears as an ox because you remember
[1:25:27] ah it just blows my mind
[1:25:30] there's the children of israel they're
[1:25:31] led through the desert they have manner
[1:25:33] given to them they have water given to
[1:25:35] them god is providing their needs he
[1:25:37] takes them up to a mountain he appears
[1:25:39] to them
[1:25:41] and they say we're too scared just send
[1:25:43] moses he says right bring moses up the
[1:25:44] mountain moses is up the mountain
[1:25:47] okay
[1:25:48] and in 40 days
[1:25:51] in front of the mountain
[1:25:52] they lose all their faith
[1:25:55] and they say to aaron we don't know
[1:25:56] what's happened yeah that it's become
[1:25:58] common to them
[1:26:01] and so aaron says well
[1:26:03] give me all your earrings
[1:26:06] okay so it takes all the earrings and he
[1:26:08] throws them into a fire
[1:26:10] and what comes out
[1:26:13] a calf
[1:26:15] a false god
[1:26:17] okay
[1:26:18] and so the calf is
[1:26:21] is you see the the the fourth one
[1:26:24] the false well what does that mean to us
[1:26:28] all right
[1:26:30] let's this is so good let's turn to
[1:26:32] colossians chapter two
[1:27:00] all right
[1:27:06] okay verse 13 and you
[1:27:09] being dead in your sins and this is the
[1:27:11] progression being dead in your sins the
[1:27:13] uncircumcision of your flesh has he
[1:27:15] quickened given you new life having
[1:27:17] forgiven you all trespasses our praise
[1:27:20] god
[1:27:21] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:27:22] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:27:25] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:27:27] way nailing it to his cross
[1:27:29] and having
[1:27:30] spoiled principalities and powers he
[1:27:32] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:27:36] over them in them okay now we're going
[1:27:38] to get to it
[1:27:40] let no man therefore judge you in meat
[1:27:42] or drink or in respect of holy days
[1:27:45] or of the new moon or sabbath days which
[1:27:47] are a shadow of things to come but the
[1:27:49] body
[1:27:50] is of christ
[1:27:52] so what's what's the feast days what's
[1:27:54] the new moons what's the meat it's like
[1:27:56] okay
[1:27:58] um there's uh
[1:28:02] there's a catholic tradition that you
[1:28:04] you don't eat uh meat on fridays
[1:28:08] okay
[1:28:09] and you know
[1:28:11] no particular harm but if it becomes a
[1:28:13] commandment
[1:28:15] then it becomes difficult because then
[1:28:17] you say if you eat fish on fridays
[1:28:20] then you're going to hell instead of
[1:28:23] going to heaven
[1:28:25] all right
[1:28:26] and so this brings you into bondage of
[1:28:29] sacrifice and service and that's
[1:28:32] the manifestation of the calf spirit in
[1:28:34] the wrong way that place of service
[1:28:38] but of service to the wrong spirit you
[1:28:40] know it's so ridiculous how many know
[1:28:42] what a cacabarro is
[1:28:46] okay so how many know what like a a
[1:28:49] hamster is
[1:28:50] you know what hamster is
[1:28:52] okay a cacabarro is a the biggest kind
[1:28:56] of hamster in the world
[1:28:58] it lives in um it lives in the amazon
[1:29:01] region
[1:29:02] and so it's a basically it's a big
[1:29:04] guinea pig and it swims in the water
[1:29:06] it's a water creature
[1:29:08] okay
[1:29:09] and
[1:29:10] when
[1:29:11] the
[1:29:12] uh catholics came to
[1:29:15] south america the priests actually said
[1:29:18] um because they were going hungry on
[1:29:21] fridays because they couldn't find
[1:29:22] enough fish to feed everybody
[1:29:25] they said
[1:29:27] that the cacabarro is actually a fish
[1:29:31] so they could eat it on fridays
[1:29:34] yeah you can look out it's amazing
[1:29:37] the leaps and bounds that
[1:29:40] man has to do to conform his religion
[1:29:43] well anyway
[1:29:44] so we can eat fish on fridays or
[1:29:47] kakabarros and we won't go to hell
[1:29:50] if you're a catholic all right
[1:29:53] but the point is let's carry on
[1:29:55] let no man begow you of a reward in the
[1:29:58] voluntary humility of voluntary humility
[1:30:01] the worshipping of angels
[1:30:03] intruding into those things he has not
[1:30:05] seen
[1:30:06] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
[1:30:09] not holding to the head
[1:30:11] from which all the body by joints and
[1:30:13] bands having nourishment ministered and
[1:30:15] knit together increases with the
[1:30:17] increase of god
[1:30:18] wherefore if you be dead with christ
[1:30:20] from the rudiments of the world
[1:30:22] why is there living in the world
[1:30:24] are you subject to ordinances taste not
[1:30:27] touch not hand or not which will perish
[1:30:29] with the using after the commandments
[1:30:32] and doctrines of men which indeed have a
[1:30:35] show of wisdom in will worship
[1:30:38] oh interesting phrase
[1:30:40] will worship
[1:30:42] are you worshiping your will
[1:30:45] your ability to do something
[1:30:49] your ability to to uh you know oh i i
[1:30:53] fast twice a day
[1:30:55] i give tithes of all that i have
[1:30:59] i can do this
[1:31:01] because i have a strong will
[1:31:04] i will not fall to sin oh that's a good
[1:31:07] thing i'm not saying yeah let's all fall
[1:31:09] to sin but i'm saying if you are keeping
[1:31:12] yourself from sin because like uh i
[1:31:14] don't know like like um an athlete keeps
[1:31:17] themselves from eating chocolates
[1:31:21] because they don't want to spoil their
[1:31:22] their diet regime sure how what glory
[1:31:26] does that give to god
[1:31:28] okay
[1:31:29] it's like lord take this from me deliver
[1:31:31] me cleanse me renew my conscience so
[1:31:34] that where i'm resisting and i'm not
[1:31:36] saying yeah resist in your own power
[1:31:39] absolutely
[1:31:40] don't go into sin
[1:31:42] but you should be saying if it's
[1:31:44] tempting me
[1:31:46] this
[1:31:47] hmm
[1:31:48] how does it say that the the
[1:31:50] uh
[1:31:53] the sinner once purged
[1:31:56] has no more consciousness
[1:31:58] of sin
[1:32:00] all right and so that means
[1:32:03] if you have consciousness of sins you
[1:32:07] haven't been purged properly
[1:32:10] now that's not a problem because we are
[1:32:12] building we're a process it's not i
[1:32:14] haven't been purged i'm the most evil
[1:32:16] person no no no no it's like i haven't
[1:32:18] been purged god purge me some more
[1:32:22] okay
[1:32:23] but if you can say i'm tempted by this
[1:32:25] all but i'm strong enough to resist
[1:32:29] there's your will worship
[1:32:31] okay rather than relying on god and
[1:32:33] saying lord help me a very very
[1:32:36] subtle distinction there but i hope you
[1:32:38] can see what i'm saying and this is the
[1:32:40] way that the devil presents
[1:32:43] as that calf as that piece of burden as
[1:32:46] that beast of sacrifice and you're
[1:32:47] sacrificing but it's to the wrong thing
[1:32:52] okay yeah so
[1:32:55] how are you
[1:32:58] approaching these things how are you
[1:33:00] manifesting the word of god to others
[1:33:01] that meet you are you being a
[1:33:03] four-square christian
[1:33:05] yeah
[1:33:06] the lion the ox the man the eagle and
[1:33:09] letting god lead you to express his word
[1:33:12] as appropriate
[1:33:14] and remembering that
[1:33:16] it's in the service and humility
[1:33:18] that we really see the difference
[1:33:20] between the spirit of god and the spirit
[1:33:22] of the devil
[1:33:27] ah you got time for some more
[1:33:30] okay
[1:33:32] all right
[1:33:33] here's a good
[1:33:34] one okay revelations 3 12.
[1:33:39] all right
[1:33:40] now remember the blessings given to the
[1:33:42] church ages one is given to each church
[1:33:44] age
[1:33:45] but they add up
[1:33:46] the revelation of christ is one to each
[1:33:49] church age but they add up to the full
[1:33:51] revelation of jesus christ
[1:33:53] and the blessings giving to the church
[1:33:55] ages are added up to the full blessing
[1:33:58] that god gives
[1:34:00] so it's not like he says
[1:34:02] you know uh
[1:34:04] to the church in laodicea to him that
[1:34:06] overcometh will i grant to sit on my
[1:34:08] throne even as i overcame and someone
[1:34:11] from philadelphia he's going to be
[1:34:13] saying sorry sorry you can't sit on the
[1:34:14] throne that wasn't your blessing he's
[1:34:16] going to say this is the complete
[1:34:17] blessing for the complete body
[1:34:19] all right
[1:34:20] so
[1:34:23] revelations chapter 3
[1:34:26] verse 12. so this is blessing for us as
[1:34:28] well
[1:34:29] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:34:32] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[1:34:35] no more out
[1:34:37] and i will write upon him the name of my
[1:34:40] god and the name of the city of my god
[1:34:42] which is the new jerusalem which cometh
[1:34:44] down out of heaven from my god and i
[1:34:47] will write on him my new name oh that's
[1:34:49] a blessing all right go back to that
[1:34:52] verse i didn't read that yet
[1:34:54] okay
[1:34:55] so
[1:34:56] what are we talking about four square
[1:34:58] four squared this is the new jerusalem
[1:35:01] that city that's built four square and
[1:35:03] you're going to be a pillar in the
[1:35:05] temple of my god let's have a turn now
[1:35:08] to ezekiel chapter 41 and we see where
[1:35:11] ezekiel saw
[1:35:14] the temple
[1:35:28] in verse 21
[1:35:31] and it says and the posts the pillars
[1:35:34] the posts of the temple were squared
[1:35:36] that's the same word in
[1:35:38] exodus as four squared
[1:35:41] okay so if you want to be a post a
[1:35:43] pillar in the temple of god
[1:35:46] you got to be four squared
[1:35:48] okay
[1:35:49] you've got to be that meeting place
[1:35:50] between god and man
[1:35:52] okay that four steps of the meeting
[1:35:54] place the altar of sin
[1:35:58] yeah the brass altar where you get rid
[1:36:00] of your sins
[1:36:02] the altar of incense
[1:36:05] where you pray and you hear the word of
[1:36:07] god and you talk to god and there's
[1:36:09] communion
[1:36:10] the holiest place of all where god meets
[1:36:12] you
[1:36:13] four square
[1:36:16] and then
[1:36:17] the breastplate that you carry out from
[1:36:20] with you that you can be
[1:36:23] the representative of god to those
[1:36:25] around you and you become the meeting
[1:36:27] place so that when people meet you they
[1:36:30] meet god amen so how are we meeting
[1:36:33] people
[1:36:36] how are we meeting people are we meeting
[1:36:38] people in the flesh
[1:36:39] or are we meeting people foursquare
[1:36:43] okay
[1:36:44] are we
[1:36:46] recognizing that that foursquare process
[1:36:48] isn't it's not one and done
[1:36:51] okay it's every day we need to go and
[1:36:54] cleanse ourselves and wash ourselves
[1:36:56] it's every day we need to offer the
[1:36:57] incense of prayer to our god and hear
[1:37:01] from him it's every day that we need to
[1:37:03] enter into that holy place for jesus
[1:37:05] made a way that we could be kings and
[1:37:07] priests putting on the righteous
[1:37:09] garments that he gives to us
[1:37:12] you see
[1:37:14] and every day that we should be taking
[1:37:17] the breastplate of foursquare
[1:37:19] out into the world and saying
[1:37:23] do you need to know my god
[1:37:29] am i representing god in the right
[1:37:32] spiritual way
[1:37:34] because the devil has an impersonation
[1:37:36] for everything
[1:37:38] all right even laying down your life you
[1:37:40] can lay down your life all you want and
[1:37:42] god will say well
[1:37:45] depart from me you workers of iniquity i
[1:37:47] never even knew you
[1:37:50] it was a wrong spirit that you laid down
[1:37:52] your life to
[1:37:55] i hope that's a blessing to you
[1:38:00] i
[1:38:00] hope that that will help us to be
[1:38:06] more
[1:38:07] foursquare
[1:38:10] as
[1:38:11] christians brothers and sisters
[1:38:14] as ambassadors to god
[1:38:17] in this world
[1:38:18] amen
[1:38:20] i think you know the song i want god's
[1:38:22] way
[1:38:23] to be my way
[1:38:26] as a journey here below
[1:38:31] for there is no other highway
[1:38:36] that a child of god should know
[1:38:41] though the way be sweet and rough
[1:38:46] if he leads me that's enough
[1:38:51] i want god's way

[1:39:04] be our way
[1:39:07] may we line ourselves up to that four
[1:39:09] square
[1:39:12] service that you have for us
[1:39:14] that we could be representative of you
[1:39:16] here on the earth
[1:39:18] while we're waiting for the kingdom of
[1:39:19] heaven to come and bring that great four
[1:39:22] square city down
[1:39:23] may we be ambassadors for that to bring
[1:39:26] people into you
[1:39:28] lord may we
[1:39:30] keep your blood sacrifice always before
[1:39:33] us to clean us
[1:39:35] may we always be in spiritual communion
[1:39:37] with you
[1:39:38] may we carry the very presence of god to
[1:39:41] others through the holy spirit
[1:39:43] not letting ourselves get in the way
[1:39:46] but lord letting you lead us
[1:39:49] and be our
[1:39:50] our foursquare guide
[1:39:54] we ask in jesus name
[1:39:56] amen
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:06] though the wave
[1:40:08] is steep or rough
[1:40:12] if he leads me that's enough
[1:40:17] i want god's way
[1:40:20] to be my way
[1:40:22] every day
[1:40:28] i want god's way
[1:40:30] to be my way
[1:40:33] as i journey here below
[1:40:38] for there is
[1:40:40] no other highway
[1:40:44] that this child of god should know
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:41:00] i want god's way
[1:41:02] to
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:09] remember
[1:41:11] you're only ever one step away
[1:41:14] from getting back on god's
[1:41:16] path there's something here that's
[1:41:19] burdening you today and saying lord this
[1:41:21] is where i'm lacking
[1:41:23] there's something that says lord this is
[1:41:25] where you want to build something in me
[1:41:28] that i haven't been giving to you
[1:41:30] that haven't been laying
[1:41:32] you know right now
[1:41:34] free from the distractions of the
[1:41:36] outside
[1:41:37] is a good place
[1:41:39] to really make a recommitment to say
[1:41:41] lord i give this to you lord let me
[1:41:45] live my life for you
[1:41:46] because if we don't do it here
[1:41:49] you're not going to do it anywhere else
[1:41:51] now that's not saying you can't do it
[1:41:53] outside
[1:41:54] do it wherever god puts it on your heart
[1:41:59] but now's a good time just to ask him
[1:42:02] lord help me
[1:42:04] wherever i need help
[1:42:06] it's different for each one of us
[1:42:09] commit your thoughts to the lord amen

[1:42:14] time

[1:43:37] for whenever we come together
[1:43:40] we may not know how the spirit of god is
[1:43:42] going to move
[1:43:43] but one thing we surely do know
[1:43:46] is he is definitely going to move
[1:43:49] and he moves in the simplicity of his
[1:43:51] world
[1:43:52] praise be to god
