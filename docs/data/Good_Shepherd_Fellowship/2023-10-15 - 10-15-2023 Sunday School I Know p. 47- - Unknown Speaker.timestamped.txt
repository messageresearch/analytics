[5:03] Elohim the O that day Hallelujah after
[5:07] he had suffered his trials after he had
[5:09] went through the troubles that he had
[5:11] been through that God appeared to him in
[5:14] the form of a man and sat there and told

[5:21] the tent behind it was there that
[5:23] Abraham called him Elohim yes am after
[5:27] the trial and tribulation

[9:37] rainbow Abraham seen God face to face
[9:40] but job saw the resurrection amen job
[9:44] looked forward all the Patriarchs and
[9:46] great Saints of the Bible look forward
[9:48] to that day with an assurance through
[9:51] their Visions through their Revelations
[9:53] that there would come a time of
[9:55] Resurrection now we see great works go
[9:58] on we we see great powers of God we see
[10:01] great things that he could do you
[10:03] couldn't look at the Sun and know that
[10:05] it isn't the power of God that brings
[10:07] that world around over that sun you
[10:10] couldn't see a springtime come without
[10:12] knowing there was a God you can see
[10:14] healing of blind eyes deaf ears no it's
[10:17] godone but what if that was all there
[10:19] was and after we died we was gone but
[10:22] the Resurrection the Easter oh that's
[10:26] what sealed everything that God
[10:28] everything promise was a resurrection
[10:31] and they have to have a crucifixion
[10:33] before you can have a
[10:35] resurrection and before the church will
[10:37] ever be able to see a resurrected power
[10:41] before I can ever see a new ministry
[10:43] take place myself before you can ever
[10:46] enter into a new fellowship with God
[10:47] there's got to be a self crucifixion so
[10:51] that there can come a resurrection amen
[10:53] help us Lord we've got to die out to our
[10:56] own thoughts die out to our own ways
[10:58] amen die out to everything that's around
[11:00] us go through the trials and
[11:02] tribulations that we might see a new
[11:05] Resurrection a new life amen before a
[11:08] sinner can ever become a Christian there
[11:10] has to come a death then a resurrection
[11:13] amen before Abraham could see Elohim
[11:15] there had to be 25 years of testing
[11:18] before the Hebrew children could see the
[11:20] Son of God they had to go into a fiery
[11:22] furnace before Daniel could see an angel
[11:25] he had to go into the Lion's Den before
[11:28] job could ever see the resurrection he
[11:30] had to go in and lose everything he
[11:33] had but then our vision he saw and if
[11:37] joob by Vision could stand so firmly
[11:40] Upon A Promise how much more ought we to
[11:43] do after Christ is raised from the dead
[11:45] and become the first fruits of those
[11:46] that slept and sent back the Holy Spirit
[11:49] as a seal of Promise upon us that we too
[11:52] shall live because I live you live also
[11:56] Hall seeing his great presence among us
[11:58] working doing the same signs and wonders
[12:00] that he did on Earth giving us a hopes
[12:03] and we come to the resurrection and then
[12:05] remain on our eyes sheeps let's get off
[12:07] the I sheep today with a new vision with
[12:09] a new power with a new determination
[12:12] that we see God in this power we see the
[12:15] resurrection of the things
[12:16] coming we're at the time of death we're
[12:20] setting in the doors of death the
[12:22] Nations is in the doors of death Russia

[13:10] on an ash sheep I'm so glad that the
[13:14] spirit of God can come and we can say I

[13:33] freely forever someday he's coming oh
[13:36] glorious day amen it taken a Gethsemane
[13:41] of drops of blood breaking through his
[13:42] skin before there and it taken a cruel
[13:45] Agony of Calvary before there could come
[13:48] the proof of an eternal God who could
[13:51] raise the dead up it taken a it taken a
[13:54] guest Simon in a Calvary to make an
[13:56] Easter it certainly did how the those
[13:59] Apostles upon that morning when they
[14:01] were so discouraged until Peter said I
[14:04] am so discouraged I believe I'll just go
[14:06] back and fishing again I'll go back down
[14:09] I I seen him they had Great Hopes and
[14:11] believed and everything until it come
[14:13] that great darkening place what was God
[14:15] doing he was bringing those Apostles to
[14:17] an as
[14:18] sheep he was bringing them to a place to
[14:21] where they would they would have their
[14:23] faith confirmed to them and Peter said
[14:26] I'm I have seen do great Miracles down
[14:28] on Galilee but oh he lays Yonder dead
[14:32] and cold in the Tomb I believe I just go
[14:35] down to the Sea this morning and cast in
[14:37] a net and just go fishing maybe I can
[14:39] look out across the sea I and I find out
[14:42] I remember seeing him when he waited for
[14:44] us at the bank I believe I'll just go
[14:46] down the Apostle said you know what I
[14:48] believe I'll just go with you oh they
[14:49] were blue they cried until their eyes
[14:52] were swollen how we know to go through
[14:54] those places how we know we're all
[14:56] acquainted with those things I remember
[14:59] when I laid a precious one y in the
[15:01] grave up on top of the hill y called the
[15:03] Easter of the walart Ridge Cemetery I
[15:06] laid a little baby in there and I'd
[15:08] Crown a mother's arm I'd cry till I
[15:11] couldn't cry no more I'd done everything
[15:13] that I know till i' took a gun to try to
[15:16] commit suicide I was in such a time it
[15:19] was at that hour in that little room up
[15:21] there on my knees that the heavens open
[15:24] back saw her standing there Amen in the
[15:28] splend of immortality praise God it was
[15:31] in that hour that I fell her arms come
[15:32] around my shoulder and said bill you
[15:35] don't understand we're so much better
[15:37] off than you see it takes a crucifixion
[15:41] it takes a crushing of a flower to bring
[15:44] perfume from it it takes a crushing of a
[15:46] life to get the best out of it that
[15:48] there is that's the reason Jesus had to
[15:50] be crushed to bring forth what he was he
[15:53] can not stand before the crucifixion say
[15:55] all power in heavens and earth is given
[15:57] in my hands but actually after the
[15:58] crucifixion he could stand and say all
[16:01] powers of heavens and earth into my hand
[16:05] but what did it do it taken crucifixion
[16:08] first it taken the crushing and the
[16:10] disappointing of the Apostles it seen
[16:13] their savior the one they had loveed and
[16:15] seen him even raise up the Dead from the
[16:17] from the grave they seen him do that and
[16:20] think there he lays cold in the grave
[16:21] himself this morning it taken to those
[16:25] people who had seen him Open the Eyes of
[16:27] the blind seen perceive the very
[16:29] thoughts that was in the people's hearts
[16:31] how didn't he know they say that them
[16:33] were coming after him how did he know
[16:35] why didn't he know Jud Judas would would
[16:38] betray him why did he know the soldiers
[16:40] were coming up the mountains there with
[16:42] staves and swords and everything to get
[16:43] him if he could perceive their thoughts
[16:45] see the devil was working on them
[16:47] putting them on an as sheep father they
[16:49] want to give them a testimony of I no
[16:53] not I guess or perhaps it's so I know
[16:56] amen I know and remember those trials
[17:00] are brought up on you the same way so
[17:03] that you're not say well maybe this is
[17:04] right maybe the scriptures is true maybe
[17:07] Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy
[17:09] Ghost is right but when you get that
[17:11] experience and come off that ass sheep
[17:13] and you get the revelation of God by the
[17:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can scream
[17:17] I know my redeemer liveth because he
[17:20] lives in
[17:21] me Peter said I'll go fishing the
[17:24] Apostle said I believe I'll just go with
[17:26] you and there was on their ass sheep
[17:28] down there in the midst of the Sea and
[17:31] the trouble going on the way it was and
[17:34] I can hear one of them say oh how could
[17:36] it happen Peter how could it be such a
[17:39] thing that a man like that could die how
[17:41] could he be put into the grave the way
[17:43] he was how could he stand to let him
[17:45] spit in his face and jerk beard out put
[17:47] that crown on his head how could he do
[17:50] that oh and still be God I just can't
[17:53] understand it oh what a disappointment
[17:56] all of a sudden they looked over on the
[17:58] the bank just the same kind of a
[18:00] revelation job got there they seen what
[18:03] job seen 4,000 years before there stood
[18:07] the Redeemer alive and fresh standing on
[18:10] the bank with the far made fish cooked
[18:13] on it like that and said invite him
[18:16] Jesus has a table spread where the
[18:19] saints of God are fed he invites his
[18:22] chosen people coming dying with his Mana
[18:25] he does feed and supplies our every need
[18:28] or just sweet to up with Jesus all the
[18:31] time amen how we can think that how they
[18:35] taken those great things how that the
[18:37] Paul the Apostle that great Apostle who
[18:40] had been through his time of trouble
[18:42] when he witnessed the death of Stevens
[18:44] and seen his little face look towards
[18:45] heaven and the Rocks beating him in the
[18:47] face and he looked up and he said I see
[18:49] the heavens open I see Jesus standing on
[18:52] the right hand of God he said Lord lay
[18:55] not this sin to their charge and Paul
[18:57] holding the coat that had put him for
[18:59] weeks after weeks up on the as sheep
[19:01] walking back and forth till his mind had
[19:03] been polluted until he was on his road
[19:05] down to Damascus to try to fight it way
[19:08] out like a man going into a whiskey
[19:09] bottle to try to drown his Sorrows he
[19:11] was in the midst of that when there come
[19:13] a voice from Heaven the great Shining
[19:15] Light said Saul Saul I persecuted s be
[19:19] he saw him he recognized him that he was
[19:21] a resurrected Jesus the one that he had
[19:24] witnessed of dying was raised again oh I
[19:27] can remember my own life on the road
[19:29] down to destruction when I heard a sweet
[19:31] voice I am Jesus I was once dead I'm
[19:34] alive forever more because I live you
[19:37] can live also since that time put my
[19:39] hand in his I've trusted him through the
[19:41] Dark Places when the time has come where

[19:46] trust
[19:47] him every Christian believer has to be
[19:50] pushed into those trials every Christian
[19:52] believer has to be put on the a sheep so

[21:11] the time I've asked for things and cried
[21:13] for things and beg for things and fail

[21:32] the good how can it be for the good
[21:34] months later when I seen her stand there
[21:36] and all the beauty of a young
[21:38] girl speaking to me standing by the side
[21:40] of that Old Wagon broken down there I
[21:43] noticed she would live she might have

[21:47] while she was tender and sweet I know
[21:49] I'll see her again I know I shall see
[21:52] her I know it Beyond any Shadow of Doubt

[22:14] to be ground and twisted and squeezed to
[22:16] get what in it was out there was too
[22:18] much brandom in there it had to be
[22:20] squeezed out before God could make
[22:22] knowing there was too much of you and
[22:24] you told God had to squeeze it out
[22:25] through trials and while I squeez is
[22:28] coming on it's hard but after a while
[22:31] the sky is cleared back and you see the
[22:33] purpose of God then you cry I know my
[22:37] redeemer liveth and at the last days
