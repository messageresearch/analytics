[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:18] praise the Lord
[1:00:23] I had a I thought of my heart that I
[1:00:26] wanted to speak on on Sunday
[1:00:28] so I thought maybe I will
[1:00:31] I would just go back to the light of
[1:00:33] what we were
[1:00:36] we were the uh speaking on
[1:00:40] is gone Sunday
[1:00:44] and
[1:00:46] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:00:50] first Samuel chapter 15. there's a
[1:00:53] portion of that subject that I kind of
[1:00:55] left off
[1:00:57] but I will try to find
[1:00:59] uh another way to approach it tonight
[1:01:02] but for the prayer meeting tonight
[1:01:06] praise the Lord
[1:01:09] I never expected that I will I will hold
[1:01:11] you in prayer tonight but uh whenever
[1:01:14] God gave that opportunity we just want
[1:01:16] to put our hearts before the Lord amen
[1:01:19] praise the Lord
[1:01:21] really need to find a timing and just
[1:01:23] just come and spend time in prayer amen
[1:01:26] you know or have an all-night prayer
[1:01:29] meeting if
[1:01:30] if
[1:01:33] since the last time we did it I don't
[1:01:35] know how many years but
[1:01:37] it's still part of the word of God Amen
[1:01:41] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:01:47] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:01:54] we read from verse 22 the insomnia said
[1:01:58] have the Lord
[1:02:01] as great Delight in burnt offering and
[1:02:05] sacrifices
[1:02:07] as in obeying the voice of the Lord
[1:02:11] behold
[1:02:12] to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:02:16] and to hacking
[1:02:19] then the facts of RAM
[1:02:22] for Rebellion
[1:02:25] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:02:29] now so
[1:02:31] uh just like I said on Sunday I mean
[1:02:34] witchcraft practicing witchcraft in
[1:02:36] Israel was a capital punishment but
[1:02:38] moreover see how the the Holy Spirit
[1:02:42] presented here for Rebellion
[1:02:45] is us the sin of Witchcraft so uh
[1:02:51] witchcraft his service is the same but
[1:02:53] what what I'm dealing with tonight is
[1:02:56] not trying to find wish I don't believe
[1:02:58] there is witchcraft in this assembly
[1:03:01] amen if there is one it won't survive
[1:03:05] right okay so I'm not chasing you know
[1:03:08] any kind of for or any individual no
[1:03:11] that's not what I'm what I'm what I'm
[1:03:13] I'm trying to approach here is uh
[1:03:17] uh the spirit of rebellion
[1:03:22] amen because that's the same thing that
[1:03:25] the prophet Samir is dealing with the
[1:03:28] spirit of rebellion
[1:03:30] their their Rob saw
[1:03:34] of of the blessing that has come his way
[1:03:39] so he says for Rebellion
[1:03:43] and what Paul what Saul was rebelling
[1:03:46] against in verse 22 the prophet said
[1:03:50] yeah uh that uh
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:57] that the Lord Delight in obeying his
[1:04:00] voice
[1:04:01] molding in offering offerings and
[1:04:04] sacrifices if there is one thing that
[1:04:07] God Delight in
[1:04:09] is obeying his voice amen
[1:04:12] so that's what I want to deal with
[1:04:14] tonight so I don't want anybody you know
[1:04:17] looking over your shoulder and says you
[1:04:19] know what a brother one talking about
[1:04:21] witchcraft witchcraft the all the most
[1:04:24] reason why I went into what I went into
[1:04:26] on Sunday was just to be able to deal
[1:04:28] with this whole Halloween spirit and to
[1:04:31] give you the picture that is behind it
[1:04:33] amen is looking like an entertainment
[1:04:36] but there is a spirit behind it
[1:04:41] never said there is a devilish Spirit
[1:04:43] behind it that was that was the reason
[1:04:45] why I went I went the direction that I
[1:04:48] that I go I went on Sunday so
[1:04:51] for Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:04:54] Witchcraft and stubbornness
[1:04:56] is as iniquity and idolatry because thou
[1:05:00] has rejected the word of the Lord
[1:05:04] he have also rejected thee from being
[1:05:07] King let's pray together
[1:05:10] Heavenly Father Lord we just want to
[1:05:13] pray tonight o God and ask that your
[1:05:16] grace Your Grace will come O God and and
[1:05:18] bless the service tonight father and
[1:05:21] Lord Jesus I pray that Lord you will you
[1:05:24] will help us Lord as a just Express who
[1:05:27] God I'm not going on a Witch Hunt Lord
[1:05:30] father because your word is enough the
[1:05:33] spirit of the Living God that word in
[1:05:35] this building is sufficient to expose
[1:05:38] any family or spirit
[1:05:42] Almighty Godfather you you told the
[1:05:45] children of Israel they were not spread
[1:05:46] a witch and the wish cannot be spared
[1:05:49] honor the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:52] they either come to conviction or they
[1:05:55] get away so father we are not afraid
[1:05:57] we're now on The Witch Hunt but Lord God
[1:06:00] we want to deal with uh with uh hearing
[1:06:04] your voice
[1:06:06] obeying your voice brother Branham in
[1:06:09] that vision
[1:06:11] of the Bride in preview he cries stay in
[1:06:14] line
[1:06:16] stay in line that's that's where we are
[1:06:19] that's where our emphasis is I don't
[1:06:22] want the devil turning our talk to the
[1:06:24] wrong thing
[1:06:25] our emphasis is staying in line so Lord
[1:06:29] I pray that the Holy Ghost will just
[1:06:31] come tonight
[1:06:32] take your word take the portion of your
[1:06:34] wording and just speak to us Lord
[1:06:37] in the way that only you can
[1:06:40] in Jesus name we pray
[1:06:43] amen amen the Lord bless you
[1:06:46] praise the Lord
[1:06:47] and just like I said that's what our
[1:06:51] emphasis is on so we we will start off
[1:06:55] tonight by just reading the quote our
[1:06:57] brother Brandon there in Rapture in the
[1:07:00] same preview of The Bride
[1:07:03] I want to take that portion of Faith uh
[1:07:06] brother Branham says I look a year come
[1:07:10] they are scented bunch of little girls
[1:07:13] just exactly the way they was
[1:07:17] all correctly dress their head hanging
[1:07:21] way down on their back smooth clean
[1:07:25] mashing like
[1:07:28] this
[1:07:30] told the step of the Gospel
[1:07:34] praise the Lord now you have to know
[1:07:37] that's where the greater battle is
[1:07:38] that's what brother Branham said is
[1:07:40] between right and wrong he said it's
[1:07:42] between sickness and health praise the
[1:07:45] Lord and the greater battle is between
[1:07:48] stay in line with the word or just
[1:07:51] following
[1:07:53] your emotions
[1:07:56] praise the Lord there are a few things I
[1:07:59] will share with you tonight and so
[1:08:01] brother Branham says uh that those
[1:08:03] little girls in the vision to the step
[1:08:05] of the Gospel she was the word
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:11] she was the word now you see uh she was
[1:08:16] the word
[1:08:18] by by prophecy she was the word
[1:08:22] by the Holy Ghost bringing her her
[1:08:26] nature to confirm to the world but yet
[1:08:29] she has to stay in line with the word
[1:08:32] being the word do not give us the right
[1:08:36] to just decide to do anything anything
[1:08:39] we choose to do is the world because we
[1:08:41] are the word
[1:08:44] no even God himself
[1:08:47] bring himself subject to his word
[1:08:50] he bring himself in obedience to his
[1:08:53] word
[1:08:55] now uh brother Brandon says to the step
[1:08:58] of the Gospel she was the word
[1:09:00] they look like one out of every nation
[1:09:04] praise the Lord
[1:09:06] I'm glad that is one out of every nation
[1:09:09] amen praise the Lord hallelujah you have
[1:09:12] to count yourself in that number
[1:09:15] I was looking
[1:09:17] at it as they passed by and seen in
[1:09:22] seeing them pass by instead of going
[1:09:26] down
[1:09:27] they started growing up and notice one
[1:09:31] of them trying two or three of them
[1:09:35] trying getting
[1:09:37] out of line
[1:09:39] a stream stay in line
[1:09:44] praise the Lord
[1:09:45] and the vision left me and I was
[1:09:49] standing in the room streaming stay in
[1:09:52] line
[1:09:54] praise the Lord that that is that is
[1:09:56] that is how much the vision imparted him
[1:10:00] now remember now he saw the bride in the
[1:10:04] preview first that have come and then he
[1:10:07] saw the church
[1:10:10] of all ages he saw the the church you
[1:10:14] know with all the filtered dressing and
[1:10:16] everything and now this is the bride
[1:10:18] coming back the second time now the
[1:10:20] Alpha and Omega principle now so seeing
[1:10:24] now
[1:10:25] that because when he saw the church in
[1:10:28] her filthiness he said I fed discouraged
[1:10:31] he said is this is this all that we have
[1:10:33] presented he says men that have run
[1:10:34] around with the gospel all of these
[1:10:36] preacher John Wesley yeah Charles podgin
[1:10:39] and all of these men that we have Labor
[1:10:40] is this what we're going to present to
[1:10:42] Christ
[1:10:44] but then when the bride came back into
[1:10:47] view
[1:10:49] it rejoices heart you can see why he's
[1:10:54] uh he's captured that way why he's he's
[1:10:57] moved that he he can be so much imparted
[1:11:01] because if it was just that she was
[1:11:03] Marching In step with the word and and
[1:11:06] and you know and the glory of God was
[1:11:08] overheard and she was just in four
[1:11:11] obedience brother Brandon would have
[1:11:13] just enjoyed the scene but as soon as
[1:11:16] she started
[1:11:17] stepping out of line
[1:11:19] praise the Lord
[1:11:22] he screamed
[1:11:24] hoping that she can hear him
[1:11:29] stay in line stay in line
[1:11:32] you know brother Brahm talks about that
[1:11:34] he Masterpiece you know how he screams
[1:11:36] stay in line stay in line and he woke up
[1:11:38] out of his sleep out of the vision
[1:11:40] standing on his feet streaming in the
[1:11:42] room stay in line stay in line
[1:11:46] praise the lord we talk about the
[1:11:49] formation of Israel
[1:11:52] how they move
[1:11:53] in by by Council of uh by camps and
[1:11:58] traps of three
[1:12:01] that was their formation as as long as
[1:12:04] Israel kept that position in their
[1:12:07] travel
[1:12:08] there was no nation that could stand
[1:12:10] before them
[1:12:12] praise the Lord they never had an army
[1:12:17] they were just lay by the pillar of Fire
[1:12:20] but as long as they kept that formation
[1:12:24] no there was no nation that could defeat
[1:12:27] him
[1:12:30] so the problem that Israel had Moab was
[1:12:34] about tried to to to disorganize the
[1:12:39] people because he invited them down to a
[1:12:41] feast it's hard for you to come to a
[1:12:43] feast and keep that formation
[1:12:47] so the people started lingering started
[1:12:49] moving around and running around with
[1:12:51] mobile men and mobile women and all of
[1:12:54] that and then the wrath of God was
[1:12:57] coming against the people
[1:12:59] so you see we have a machine order
[1:13:05] we have a machine order
[1:13:08] and our Martian order is to stay in line
[1:13:11] with the word
[1:13:13] in everything that we do
[1:13:17] praise the Lord
[1:13:18] that's the bride Mash in order
[1:13:21] I mean the bride when that will now be
[1:13:23] gathered in one nation you know for us
[1:13:26] to be able to have the same physical uh
[1:13:29] uh uh uh
[1:13:31] imagine order that Israel have they had
[1:13:35] a physical match in order our marching
[1:13:37] order is a spiritual March in order
[1:13:42] praise the Lord so as we deal with that
[1:13:45] uh uh tonight just like I said
[1:13:49] brother Branham
[1:13:51] preached the message he preached series
[1:13:53] of messages on uh on on demonology
[1:13:57] as we are talking about all of this I
[1:14:00] had a privilege to to study a few few of
[1:14:03] that
[1:14:04] while preparing on this subject
[1:14:07] and and it's it's it's it's amazed me in
[1:14:11] the other uh when brother Brandon first
[1:14:13] preached uh uh he preached a two series
[1:14:16] uh demonology and uh uh in India and
[1:14:22] that was not in the Branham Tabernacle
[1:14:24] when he preached that Series in the
[1:14:26] morning
[1:14:27] which is uh uh demonology in the
[1:14:30] Physical Realm
[1:14:31] he preached that message and what he was
[1:14:34] talking about dealing with there was
[1:14:38] the origin of sickness
[1:14:42] okay that was where he says every
[1:14:45] sickness no matter what the name the
[1:14:46] doctor called it is is a demon
[1:14:49] and he said as sickness can only affect
[1:14:53] our body when the cells of our body
[1:14:55] backslide
[1:14:59] when the cells of our body backslide
[1:15:05] the doctor always says your immune
[1:15:07] system is weak
[1:15:10] praise the Lord
[1:15:12] and that's how that's when a sickness
[1:15:15] can be able to overcome your body so so
[1:15:17] in uh in uh in demonology Physical Realm
[1:15:21] he he took his subject from uh uh uh I'm
[1:15:25] the Lord God that he left all your
[1:15:27] diseases psalm 103.
[1:15:29] that was where he took his text from
[1:15:31] when he preached there but he dared only
[1:15:34] with sickness
[1:15:36] now
[1:15:38] uh the next day he he decided to speak
[1:15:42] on uh demonology in the spiritual Realm
[1:15:46] and strange enough when he was preaching
[1:15:49] demonology in a spiritual realm he took
[1:15:52] his text from first Samuel
[1:15:54] where Saul went to the witch of indom
[1:16:00] praise the Lord
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:03] now so uh uh there brother Branham now
[1:16:07] started talking about more of of uh of
[1:16:13] demonology something he said in uh in in
[1:16:18] touch in spirit which of course is
[1:16:20] another demonology series that he
[1:16:22] preached not not at the same time he
[1:16:25] preached that that one uh somewhere in
[1:16:27] another it's another demonology series
[1:16:29] that he preached I will come to death
[1:16:31] but even when he preached her enticing
[1:16:34] Spirit he took his subject
[1:16:37] or his inspiration he read he read a
[1:16:40] scripture but his inspiration was
[1:16:43] actually
[1:16:44] when uh when Ahab
[1:16:47] winning call Joe Shepherd
[1:16:52] for them to go and get the lane
[1:16:55] now he was he was emphasizing of how
[1:16:59] the prophets of Ahab God on a lying
[1:17:03] spirit
[1:17:06] now so all of that he's trying to show
[1:17:09] us demonology in a spiritual Realm
[1:17:13] they were basing their battle on the
[1:17:16] word of God because Roman Gila was for
[1:17:20] Israel
[1:17:23] for a matter of fact it was one of the
[1:17:25] city that Joshua appointed as a City of
[1:17:29] Refuge
[1:17:32] praise the Lord
[1:17:34] so they were based in their trick
[1:17:38] their fight the very reason why uh uh
[1:17:42] the the the the the the the smart my
[1:17:44] card in the mouth and see where did the
[1:17:46] spirit of the Lord left me when he went
[1:17:48] you know I mean uh uh you know you know
[1:17:52] uh one of those guys slapping in his
[1:17:54] mouth and all of that it's all because
[1:17:57] they had a word
[1:18:00] they could prove that that land belonged
[1:18:03] to Israel but yet they were under a
[1:18:06] wrong spirit
[1:18:09] are we together
[1:18:12] okay
[1:18:13] they are all they were on honor a wrong
[1:18:16] spirit and and to just realize that uh
[1:18:19] you know uh alive spirit will will will
[1:18:24] will will convince
[1:18:26] those 400 Prophets
[1:18:28] and put them in unity
[1:18:34] that's why you can see that the the the
[1:18:36] World Council of churches is under a
[1:18:38] lying spirit
[1:18:41] because they are the the the
[1:18:44] they can give you hundreds of scripture
[1:18:47] in the Bible you know what on what they
[1:18:49] are establishing they are they are fed
[1:18:52] on but we know that uh their move is
[1:18:55] contrary to the word of God
[1:18:57] are we together
[1:18:59] amen now as as I was as I was studying
[1:19:04] uh I realized that a
[1:19:07] h
[1:19:09] let's let's just read this uh from
[1:19:12] Interstate spirit
[1:19:16] I hear you long uh last Wednesday I was
[1:19:19] trying not to do it tonight
[1:19:24] they are in the soul
[1:19:26] the same as they are in the body what
[1:19:28] was their demons
[1:19:31] he was referring to Demons that they are
[1:19:34] in the soul as well as as as the same as
[1:19:39] they are in the body now let me say
[1:19:41] something here
[1:19:43] when brother Branham speak of this
[1:19:46] uh that's you you can go back instead of
[1:19:49] that you will realize that the soul is
[1:19:54] the nature of the spirit
[1:20:00] okay the soul is the nature of the
[1:20:04] spirit in a sense that is uh from the
[1:20:07] from the manifestation of what the
[1:20:10] person is doing you can tell what spirit
[1:20:12] is behind it
[1:20:16] praise the Lord
[1:20:17] because as as brother Branham taught
[1:20:20] this he tried to to he used their
[1:20:24] statement over and over and there's a
[1:20:26] place in the message where he he not in
[1:20:29] a sense of corrected it but he clarified
[1:20:31] what he was saying
[1:20:36] because when the person is doing wrong
[1:20:39] uh that that manifestation
[1:20:43] the action of the person shows the
[1:20:46] spirit that is behind uh
[1:20:50] and that action the light and and you
[1:20:53] know just like uh we were saying there
[1:20:56] were from the book of Kings all of those
[1:20:58] 400 prophets you know uniting they are
[1:21:01] saying together believing that God is
[1:21:03] with them and how can Mark Micaiah come
[1:21:06] in and and challenge them you know but
[1:21:09] we know that it was a life spirit that
[1:21:12] That Came Upon them just to be able to
[1:21:15] deceive Ahab into battle because Elijah
[1:21:18] has prophesied that adults were going to
[1:21:21] Lake it has blood
[1:21:24] are we together
[1:21:25] now so brother Branham as he says this
[1:21:28] uh uh let's follow the reading year uh
[1:21:31] it will help you he said now there's
[1:21:34] many times and many people with good
[1:21:37] thoughts
[1:21:39] good people who try many times to rest
[1:21:43] upon some little theology they have
[1:21:48] geologic
[1:21:50] is Bible teachings
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:54] any form of Bible teaching and a
[1:21:57] knowledge of God Through the Bible is a
[1:22:00] form of theology that you have so he
[1:22:03] said good people
[1:22:04] very good people
[1:22:07] you know that try to rest
[1:22:12] they try to rest upon some little
[1:22:15] theology they have or something
[1:22:21] that they have been
[1:22:24] they have been taught since a Time
[1:22:28] like you know going to Sunday School
[1:22:30] going to church growing up with your
[1:22:32] parents believing you know uh that uh
[1:22:37] you know our church is the only right
[1:22:40] Church you know uh you know believing
[1:22:42] that whatever we do is is backed by the
[1:22:43] scripture or you know just like that and
[1:22:46] and and that thing in their child or
[1:22:50] that individual you know uh uh uh they
[1:22:55] are resting upon it is is becoming part
[1:22:58] of them now you don't realize how much
[1:23:01] our faith how much of of the word of God
[1:23:05] of the message of the hour has become
[1:23:07] our life
[1:23:10] praise the Lord
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] how much of the word that has become our
[1:23:16] life
[1:23:19] that everything we do
[1:23:22] is channel through that word
[1:23:25] as we are believing the word as we are
[1:23:27] receiving the word
[1:23:29] you see that's the reason why it have to
[1:23:31] be nothing but the word
[1:23:35] because if it's a church Creed it's also
[1:23:38] going to be your life right
[1:23:42] praise the Lord now take for example uh
[1:23:46] uh uh there are churches that have not
[1:23:48] come to the understanding between the
[1:23:50] the hair of the woman as a veil and and
[1:23:54] using a covering
[1:23:57] and because they are under the doctrine
[1:24:00] and teaching that you have to cover your
[1:24:02] head she can have her hair open doing
[1:24:04] anything as soon as somebody want to
[1:24:06] pray she she can even take this this
[1:24:09] little thing
[1:24:10] and put it on her head
[1:24:12] why because that teaching has become
[1:24:15] part of her life
[1:24:18] but it's not a word of God
[1:24:24] because it's part of her life that even
[1:24:27] if she prayed and and she can't even
[1:24:29] find nothing to put on her hair she
[1:24:31] would rather just put her hands there
[1:24:37] why because it's part of her life she
[1:24:40] feels that she's not right before God
[1:24:43] unless she had her hair covered
[1:24:48] and and in obeying their teaching
[1:24:51] because she can use this little thing
[1:24:53] and put on her head she don't she don't
[1:24:55] have no problem going to sit in the
[1:24:57] barbershop and cut her hair
[1:25:00] she can cut the natural hair that God
[1:25:02] gave her for a covering but because the
[1:25:05] church have taught her
[1:25:07] that you need to just put something on
[1:25:09] your head
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:15] it's not funny I'm driving to something
[1:25:17] when I say this
[1:25:24] I'm using this as an illustration but
[1:25:26] I'm driving to something
[1:25:29] when I say this
[1:25:33] praise the Lord
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:39] brother Branham says resting on some
[1:25:41] letter to your logic all
[1:25:45] something that you have been taught as a
[1:25:48] child
[1:25:55] what is in that also is the other you
[1:25:59] might be even taught right as a child
[1:26:03] but unless the Holy Ghost come in there
[1:26:05] and give you a conviction
[1:26:09] unless the Holy Ghost come in there and
[1:26:11] give you a revelation and make this
[1:26:13] thing real
[1:26:15] that is not what my church says it's not
[1:26:18] what our church say all the message says
[1:26:20] it's something that is a revelation I
[1:26:23] understand I know why I'm doing it
[1:26:32] praise the Lord
[1:26:38] you know and and it's uh
[1:26:40] it's uh
[1:26:45] it's uh it's a bodily thing
[1:26:48] that you realize and you see
[1:26:51] people
[1:26:52] stand for the truth raise up in the
[1:26:55] Truth live your life in the truth
[1:26:59] and uh
[1:27:01] in this period of time where they are
[1:27:03] struggling well what truth is it's all
[1:27:07] because Paul said there will be a
[1:27:08] falling away you know so it's it's you
[1:27:11] know uh that part of the world must be
[1:27:14] fulfilled
[1:27:15] but you realize that as soon as
[1:27:19] this step
[1:27:21] leaving the message
[1:27:23] they also start living the value of
[1:27:27] Truth
[1:27:30] praise the Lord amen amen they start
[1:27:34] living the value of Truth
[1:27:36] they no longer hold to decency
[1:27:41] yeah the man you know they don't dress
[1:27:42] decent wear shorts and and uh you know
[1:27:46] they can and expose their body parts and
[1:27:49] go all over the place it does not bother
[1:27:51] them and and and and that is that is
[1:27:54] where also you realize that
[1:27:57] it is
[1:27:59] praise the Lord
[1:28:01] amen is the word that is keeping you is
[1:28:05] the grace of God
[1:28:09] it is the grace of God
[1:28:22] okay let's let's continue with that
[1:28:24] Court
[1:28:26] that's the only code I have to read
[1:28:28] tonight for this prayer meeting
[1:28:32] being taught sends a child and still
[1:28:35] find that down in their being down in
[1:28:38] their soul
[1:28:40] that they still have something that's
[1:28:43] not right
[1:28:46] even though they have been taught right
[1:28:50] even though as a child growing up they
[1:28:54] have they have they have hair to this
[1:28:56] thing
[1:28:57] but they realize they are down in their
[1:29:00] heart
[1:29:02] down in their heart
[1:29:05] praise the Lord
[1:29:07] and you see that is the place where
[1:29:10] every one of us
[1:29:14] are your heart is your the most
[1:29:18] value treasure that you have
[1:29:22] is your heart
[1:29:25] praise the Lord
[1:29:27] so brother Brahm says here you know
[1:29:29] they've been resting on the geologic you
[1:29:32] know they grow up believe in the stink
[1:29:34] you know they have conformed to it it's
[1:29:36] made part of their lives you know they
[1:29:38] know the language to know the the
[1:29:40] culture you know the you know everything
[1:29:42] but down in their heart
[1:29:46] praise the Lord if something that is not
[1:29:49] right you many a year this evening or
[1:29:53] this night in the court is this morning
[1:29:55] no doubt
[1:29:57] wherever you find Christians gathered
[1:30:00] together you find people who has those
[1:30:03] spirit in them
[1:30:05] is undesirable there is just something
[1:30:10] you know
[1:30:11] a desire a thought a nature a habit that
[1:30:15] is not right you know that it's not
[1:30:18] right

[1:30:27] could only Quit Line if I could only
[1:30:30] quit
[1:30:32] um
[1:30:41] lost him if I could only quit this or
[1:30:44] that now that's the devil
[1:30:50] praise the Lord even as a young man
[1:30:53] there was there was there was there was
[1:30:56] one thing that the Lord helped me
[1:30:58] to to you know uh in in in in growing up
[1:31:02] in the Lord I told myself that every bar
[1:31:05] habit is a devil
[1:31:08] there is no justification
[1:31:11] every bad habit
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:16] you know uh even the bad habit of where
[1:31:19] you can eat your fingernails and cut
[1:31:21] your flesh
[1:31:24] you biting your fingernails until you
[1:31:27] gotta you pull your flesh and blood is
[1:31:28] coming that's a bad habit
[1:31:32] why are you warning yourself
[1:31:36] well I was born like that
[1:31:38] it's just a devil
[1:31:41] yes everybody
[1:31:43] habit
[1:31:47] there's a wrong Spirit behind it there
[1:31:49] is no justification for that I mean as a
[1:31:52] young man you know I could tell you some
[1:31:55] things of of myself
[1:32:00] I used to
[1:32:02] I had a good eating habit let me say it
[1:32:04] that way
[1:32:07] I had a very good appetite as a Young
[1:32:09] Man I don't know why that nowadays I'm
[1:32:12] looking for it I can find it
[1:32:14] praise the Lord
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:24] and as as a young as a young believer
[1:32:28] when I go to parade I'll be praying all
[1:32:31] on my mind is just food
[1:32:35] oh man I would struggle I would cry I
[1:32:39] would cry so
[1:32:41] what I would do is that of
[1:32:45] I would come I would just I would take
[1:32:47] my food and give it to the children
[1:32:50] and go back in the room to pray
[1:32:54] the Lord
[1:32:55] I mean that you're Infinity eating the
[1:32:57] food the devil now this coming what
[1:32:59] would you eat I would see what you would
[1:33:00] eat and I mean and it was just it was
[1:33:03] just a battle
[1:33:05] you know it was it was just a battle on
[1:33:07] my mind
[1:33:08] and uh and and among that there was
[1:33:10] there was just some other other things
[1:33:12] too that that kind of a battle with I
[1:33:14] battled with the spirit of lust you know
[1:33:17] until since God delivered me I can I can
[1:33:21] I can sense it when there's a spirit of
[1:33:23] lost around me I can sense it when
[1:33:26] someone have a lustful spirit I can pick
[1:33:28] it up
[1:33:31] yes
[1:33:34] but that was my young experience
[1:33:37] I told myself
[1:33:39] you know all the law helped me to
[1:33:41] understand that that every bad habit
[1:33:46] everybody have it
[1:33:52] and I also had this thing
[1:33:55] that was
[1:33:57] that I had
[1:33:58] you know with myself growing up I always
[1:34:01] told myself
[1:34:04] whenever anything come around me
[1:34:07] the first place I look is to myself I
[1:34:09] told myself that uh
[1:34:12] if anything come around me something in
[1:34:14] me has attracted
[1:34:23] praise the Lord
[1:34:25] and uh well let me go into my uh the
[1:34:30] message to nothing and not make myself
[1:34:32] the sermon
[1:34:34] but I'm just only saying that
[1:34:37] to uh to to create a to create a picture
[1:34:43] you know because sometimes these things
[1:34:45] are there
[1:34:47] and uh by habits have the way of giving
[1:34:51] us comfort
[1:34:56] he had the way of giving us comfort
[1:35:00] even the person chewing their nails like
[1:35:02] myself
[1:35:05] amen
[1:35:06] I got something I got to catch myself
[1:35:08] and say you got to stop this
[1:35:10] you know it has a way of giving you
[1:35:13] comfort
[1:35:18] and it's just a pacifier
[1:35:23] is the devil pacifier
[1:35:28] to make you not to bother
[1:35:32] is a way that the devil give you because
[1:35:35] what pacifier never fails a baby's
[1:35:37] stomach
[1:35:42] amen he only gave you a sense of
[1:35:45] satisfaction for the moment
[1:35:53] and then when you take it away you
[1:35:55] realize that you've never got nothing
[1:35:56] from it you just wasted time
[1:36:03] are we together
[1:36:07] so uh
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:10] let's go back to the code let's let's
[1:36:12] finish there tonight it's it's already
[1:36:14] time is on us tonight he says
[1:36:20] that's the devil and now they come
[1:36:24] in the form of religion many times
[1:36:32] they come in the form of religion many
[1:36:35] times now in touch in spirit he's also
[1:36:39] preaching demonology in their religious
[1:36:41] dream
[1:36:42] but this time
[1:36:45] this time when when brother Brown was
[1:36:47] preaching demonology in a spiritual
[1:36:49] realm he was he was he was no uh yeah in
[1:36:54] in the spiritual in the religious room
[1:36:56] and he was talking about uh you know
[1:36:58] Saul
[1:37:00] the emphasis of the holy spirit in that
[1:37:04] message was what what I told you about
[1:37:06] here you know the rebellion of Saul
[1:37:12] and brother Branham says that you know
[1:37:15] if a person will not follow the leading
[1:37:18] of the spirit in the way that God has
[1:37:20] made us
[1:37:21] when the Bible says we are the Sheep of
[1:37:24] his posture it is now when we go safe
[1:37:29] we are being made to follow
[1:37:33] the way the human is made is to be led
[1:37:40] amen
[1:37:42] so something is leading you
[1:37:45] something is leading you whether you
[1:37:47] like it or not
[1:37:50] because that is the way we are made
[1:37:54] we are made with the nature to be led
[1:37:58] that's why people can be led by drugs
[1:38:01] people can be led by you know a faction
[1:38:05] people can be led by and every other
[1:38:06] thing
[1:38:09] and as children of God the new birth
[1:38:11] introduced us to the leadership of the
[1:38:14] Holy Spirit
[1:38:21] Romans chapter 1 Paul address you know
[1:38:24] because they will not give heed to God
[1:38:26] God gave them over to uh undesirable
[1:38:30] Spirit rebellious spirit so in Demon
[1:38:33] knowledge your problem also shows that
[1:38:35] because uh just like Saul if a man will
[1:38:39] not follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:38:41] Spirit God will give him another Spirit
[1:38:43] to lead him I
[1:38:46] you just cannot be there you just cannot
[1:38:50] be there all these people say I can't
[1:38:52] follow a man I can't follow him you will
[1:38:54] follow something
[1:38:57] because your nature in you is to follow
[1:39:05] we are the Sheep of his pasture now so
[1:39:08] uh uh uh uh there now brother Branham is
[1:39:11] identifying the other uh being taught
[1:39:14] having a good to logic being taught in
[1:39:17] the word or be growing up as a child and
[1:39:20] be taught well but yet there is there is
[1:39:23] a desire every Earnest truth heart will
[1:39:27] know that there is a place in our life
[1:39:29] where we need more of God
[1:39:31] goodness
[1:39:33] praise the Lord
[1:39:36] Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:39:38] that's the place where brother bam said
[1:39:40] we have to keep under the blood
[1:39:42] he says that's the place where the devil
[1:39:44] has the right
[1:39:50] are we together
[1:39:52] now so he's identifying this now he's
[1:39:55] identifying it here and making us to
[1:39:58] realize that he says that's the devil
[1:40:01] and most of the time it end up in being
[1:40:05] a religious spirit and that is the most
[1:40:08] deceptive spirit
[1:40:13] the Bible says that the devil believed
[1:40:15] and he trembled
[1:40:19] you cannot play church more than the
[1:40:21] devil
[1:40:22] you cannot play religion more than the
[1:40:25] devil
[1:40:26] amen the devil does his own in fear and
[1:40:29] reference to God if the word of God
[1:40:32] stand on the sin he will back up
[1:40:36] but yet there are people they are so
[1:40:38] caught up with a religious spirit that
[1:40:40] you can show them black and white in the
[1:40:42] Bible they will stay forced against it
[1:40:44] right trying to defend their Doctrine
[1:40:47] trying to defend the archeology that
[1:40:49] they have learned all the time they've
[1:40:51] been growing up what is that it's a
[1:40:53] religious spirit
[1:40:57] amen
[1:40:58] it's the same religious spirit that that
[1:41:00] taught Quran and Dayton
[1:41:02] against Moses
[1:41:06] why they could prove that they are
[1:41:08] Levites they could prove that they were
[1:41:10] circumcised on the eighth day they could
[1:41:12] prove all of these things
[1:41:16] but they had no vindication
[1:41:20] they don't know anything about the the
[1:41:22] the pillar of Fire
[1:41:26] they're having all of these natural
[1:41:28] things right and and there is there is a
[1:41:30] there is a there is something that the
[1:41:32] Bible says about those groups when you
[1:41:34] go there in the book of Jude the Bible
[1:41:36] says those were men of
[1:41:39] gain sin
[1:41:42] again saying a man that very they are
[1:41:46] very eloquent
[1:41:47] they are very eloquent I mean they can
[1:41:50] line up cults and they can line up
[1:41:53] scripture to convince you
[1:41:57] with with the people seeing the pillow
[1:41:59] of fire and the people see Mana falling
[1:42:02] from heaven with with what they saw the
[1:42:04] Red Sea parting together by Moses just
[1:42:07] showing his rock that coron and Dayton
[1:42:10] will be able to convince the multitude
[1:42:12] of those people to stand against Moses
[1:42:14] they were influential men
[1:42:20] but it was all under a religious spirit
[1:42:23] that's why God opened the Earth
[1:42:26] and swallow them up
[1:42:30] it was all honor religious spirit
[1:42:36] are we together
[1:42:43] now let's continue with that let's let's
[1:42:45] continue and find a place and close
[1:42:47] right on that Court
[1:42:52] therefore if a man or a woman who ever
[1:42:56] whoever
[1:42:59] remember this man if a man or a woman
[1:43:01] could ever get their thoughts
[1:43:04] and their testimony and their lives so
[1:43:08] line up stay in line
[1:43:12] if a man or a woman can get their
[1:43:15] thoughts and their testimony and their
[1:43:17] lives so line up with God
[1:43:20] amen until the channel of the holy
[1:43:24] spirit will be perfectly one with God
[1:43:31] you see why brother Brandon was crying
[1:43:33] in a vision stay in line
[1:43:35] because even though they were the word
[1:43:40] but the tendency of stepping out of the
[1:43:42] word is there because of the unconverted
[1:43:45] body we are living in
[1:43:51] this this unconverted body
[1:43:53] unconverted sales
[1:44:01] so if a man or a woman
[1:44:07] can line up their thoughts
[1:44:10] line up their desire
[1:44:14] with the word get in that channel of the
[1:44:17] word
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:20] get in that China
[1:44:29] praise the Lord
[1:44:35] getting that place words there is
[1:44:37] nothing in you that struggle with truth
[1:44:49] are we together
[1:44:52] if we can get our testimony we can get
[1:44:54] our lives we can get our thought the
[1:44:56] greatest battle on our mind
[1:44:59] the devil Will Blast here I mean he was
[1:45:01] saying all sorts of negative toward all
[1:45:03] sorts of foolish thoughts to you brother
[1:45:05] bam says it's just like you cannot you
[1:45:07] cannot stop you know uh uh a bird from
[1:45:11] from uh completely you know stop a bird
[1:45:14] from getting on the rest Farm
[1:45:16] as long as it's flying the seed that is
[1:45:19] rice it will try you know
[1:45:21] it will try to come there but you can
[1:45:24] you can you can stop it from staying it
[1:45:26] does not need to stay there
[1:45:29] so thoughts will come to our mind and
[1:45:31] different things discouragement and all
[1:45:33] of those things but you you you you you
[1:45:36] you you have to always learn to direct
[1:45:38] it to the promise
[1:45:43] you have to always direct it to the
[1:45:45] promise Lord you said you will never
[1:45:47] leave me you will never forsake me
[1:45:51] in your word you say you are the god
[1:45:53] that healed me of all my diseases
[1:45:56] praise the Lord
[1:45:57] amen it's it's it's more comforting for
[1:46:01] you to rest on that promise than for you
[1:46:04] to say I'm a Child of God I will never
[1:46:05] get sick that is just a religious spirit
[1:46:08] on you
[1:46:10] are just a religious devil on that
[1:46:12] person
[1:46:20] are we together
[1:46:23] now if we can just line up stay in that
[1:46:25] channel
[1:46:27] stay in line
[1:46:29] bring our thoughts bring our desire back
[1:46:32] to the word
[1:46:35] no matter what is there ain't nobody no
[1:46:38] matter what is the inner struggle don't
[1:46:39] let the devil use that and say you see
[1:46:42] you are not a child of God then brother
[1:46:44] Branham says then there you are
[1:46:45] listening to the Devil he's now become
[1:46:47] your pastor
[1:46:50] but Jesus Christ is our high priest and
[1:46:53] he work Upon Our confession
[1:46:56] okay
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:03] the devil is going to use your
[1:47:05] confession to kill you
[1:47:07] but Jesus is going to use your
[1:47:10] confection to make you better
[1:47:15] that's how we have to confess what the
[1:47:17] word says let's let's go ahead let's
[1:47:19] let's finish that thought tonight
[1:47:24] praise the Lord
[1:47:27] what will take place if the man and the
[1:47:31] woman who ever get line up
[1:47:34] where with the freedom from their heart
[1:47:39] with faith in their innermost
[1:47:45] praise the Lord
[1:47:47] Faith becomes a basic substance
[1:47:52] now what you can do
[1:47:55] Faith coming by hearing hearing of the
[1:47:57] word
[1:48:00] whenever you are applying the word you
[1:48:02] are you are walking by faith
[1:48:05] whenever you are taking the word of God
[1:48:07] to your situation you are walking by
[1:48:10] faith
[1:48:12] praise the Lord
[1:48:14] when you start when you start
[1:48:16] measuring yourself up and looking at
[1:48:19] yourself and in all of that you have to
[1:48:21] remember this levitical principle the
[1:48:24] worshiper was never under examination
[1:48:28] it was the sacrifice that was always
[1:48:30] under examination
[1:48:32] so God is not looking at you at your
[1:48:36] your work and your effort he's looking
[1:48:38] at what he has provided
[1:48:40] do we believe in that sufficiently to
[1:48:43] take care of our situation
[1:48:46] so if the man and a woman can ever get a
[1:48:48] lineup
[1:48:50] where will the freedom from their heart
[1:48:54] for the freedom from their heart that's
[1:48:57] what about the battle is because the
[1:48:59] devil always want to keep you on a
[1:49:01] condemnation because if he can keep you
[1:49:03] under condemnation he can enslave you
[1:49:11] Jesus said I have come
[1:49:14] to give you life
[1:49:16] more abundantly
[1:49:18] let's continue with our reading so we
[1:49:21] can pray and go home many people come to
[1:49:23] the altar to be prayed for they have
[1:49:26] intellectual faith
[1:49:28] they confess they are saying
[1:49:31] and join the church by intellectual
[1:49:34] Faith they believe in their heart in
[1:49:37] their mind they believe it because they
[1:49:40] have heard it they believe it because
[1:49:43] they know it is the best policy is the
[1:49:46] best thing to do but that's not what God
[1:49:49] is looking at
[1:49:51] he don't look at your intellectual Faith
[1:49:55] how you are reasoning how you are
[1:49:57] processing it in your mind
[1:49:59] you got to learn to take God by his word
[1:50:05] now to figure it out
[1:50:08] not to process it
[1:50:11] God said I believe it and they are set
[1:50:15] to it
[1:50:18] he was wounded for my transgression he
[1:50:21] was bruised for my iniquity
[1:50:26] praise the Lord
[1:50:28] brother Branham said it was on all he
[1:50:30] said all means all
[1:50:37] are we together
[1:50:39] so you see there's there's the thing
[1:50:41] that we find that is happening around
[1:50:44] our Reigns
[1:50:47] a bunch of intellectual faith is making
[1:50:50] people to crash
[1:50:55] amen
[1:50:57] a bunch of intellectual faith
[1:50:59] is making people to Crunch I mean you
[1:51:02] cannot explain the supernatural
[1:51:07] just the way that you can now hold love
[1:51:10] in your hand as a tangible object
[1:51:15] you cannot explain the supernatural you
[1:51:17] cannot explain visions and it's
[1:51:19] fulfillment
[1:51:20] you see when people start uh uh uh uh
[1:51:24] trying to attack uh the prophet of God
[1:51:28] on his visions and the supernatural
[1:51:30] fulfillments of of the seven angels and
[1:51:33] all of that I mean those are just
[1:51:35] intellectual faith
[1:51:40] praise the Lord
[1:51:43] it's just intellectual faith
[1:51:54] now so
[1:51:58] Samir the prophet told Saul
[1:52:01] Rebellion
[1:52:04] that is
[1:52:06] the nature that we all are born with
[1:52:09] that is the sinful nature another word
[1:52:12] for the sinful nature is rebellion it in
[1:52:16] us to Rebel
[1:52:18] but Grace
[1:52:20] has come
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:25] Grace has come
[1:52:30] and the Lord musicians you can come and
[1:52:32] the Lord by his grace
[1:52:35] has been able to lift us up
[1:52:39] we don't need to fight
[1:52:42] we don't need to Rebel
[1:52:44] all we need to do is to just obey
[1:52:51] walk in faith take God by his word
[1:52:57] so you see just like I said what what uh
[1:53:00] what I was I was trying to to take this
[1:53:03] subject and deal with is that I'm I'm
[1:53:07] trying to just uh run through it like
[1:53:11] this because I want to take something on
[1:53:12] on Sunday
[1:53:14] uh
[1:53:16] I might I might go a little bit back
[1:53:18] into this but uh uh I just wanted to
[1:53:22] to bring us to the place because you
[1:53:24] start you start preaching on these
[1:53:25] things and then pray some people start
[1:53:28] thinking in your mind you know there's
[1:53:30] there's a woman that came through the
[1:53:31] prayer line and brought a brand name
[1:53:34] in in one of the the video I think
[1:53:37] that's the Chicago meeting
[1:53:39] uh one of the live video we have a
[1:53:41] brother Branham and he he told that
[1:53:43] woman he says uh a preacher to a lie on
[1:53:46] you and say you were a witch
[1:53:48] all right
[1:53:50] praise the Lord
[1:53:52] I've seen how these things have
[1:53:53] destroyed churches
[1:53:56] how they have destroyed homes
[1:54:01] praise the Lord
[1:54:04] somebody dealing with uh uh menopause in
[1:54:08] their marriage
[1:54:09] and they are going through a different
[1:54:12] thing and pretty soon the the poor lady
[1:54:15] is called a witch
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:20] praise the Lord
[1:54:23] Simon the Sorcerer in the book in The
[1:54:25] Book of Arts
[1:54:27] he was somebody that practiced wage
[1:54:30] but the demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:36] brought him to to truth conviction
[1:54:38] brought him to the place where he
[1:54:40] surrounded he says magical books and all
[1:54:43] of those things
[1:54:46] the church has never been at a place
[1:54:48] where we are afraid of which
[1:54:52] there is no spirit that is above the
[1:54:54] spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:59] foreign
[1:55:06] there are things
[1:55:07] that we deal with we deal within us
[1:55:11] right from childhood some of them we
[1:55:13] understand some of them we understand
[1:55:14] that
[1:55:18] but if it is contrary to the word of God
[1:55:21] all you have to do is to just continue
[1:55:23] on submitting That Thing To God Be
[1:55:26] Earnest about it Lord I need your help
[1:55:29] in this area of my life Lord give me
[1:55:31] victory in this area of my life
[1:55:36] foreign
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:51] God tell you to do something he says and
[1:55:55] you move upon the word of God and you do
[1:55:57] that he said you get the feeling he said
[1:56:00] the feeling that you get is almost like
[1:56:03] eating honey out of the skull of a lion
[1:56:07] what was that that something experience
[1:56:10] the very lion he killed he came back and
[1:56:13] ate honey out of it so if if you deal
[1:56:17] with situation in your life you address
[1:56:19] it you say you know that this Lord I
[1:56:21] need help in this era if God Gave You
[1:56:24] victory in that area you will eat honey
[1:56:26] out of that you will feel good about it
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:34] you see what most of the time we we we
[1:56:38] conflict and confuse it it had nothing
[1:56:41] to do with your faith
[1:56:44] that's the reason why your faith have to
[1:56:46] be constantly in the sheer blood
[1:56:49] you have to be looking at the finished
[1:56:51] work
[1:56:53] it had nothing to do with your faith it
[1:56:56] had nothing to do with your salvation
[1:56:58] why because salvation is a free gift
[1:57:02] it has already been paid for God on me
[1:57:05] your works you don't need your good
[1:57:07] habits
[1:57:08] it's already been paid for you have to
[1:57:11] accept it no matter what you are going
[1:57:13] through continue to believe that Jesus
[1:57:15] Christ died for your sin and by faith
[1:57:18] you are safe

[1:57:46] that you can live a life and the devil
[1:57:48] will look for you and you will not find
[1:57:50] you better Madam say you can live at
[1:57:52] Victoria life in Jesus Christ

[1:57:58] that's the reason why the Holy Ghost was
[1:58:01] given for that's why the talking was
[1:58:03] given is to give us a Victorious Life
[1:58:07] not to give us a religious life we come
