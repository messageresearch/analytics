[1:01:57] all things after the council
[1:02:00] of his will that we should be
[1:02:04] to the praise of his glory

[1:03:10] with me tonight
[1:03:16] uh praise the lord i want i want to look
[1:03:19] at something here a little better
[1:03:21] uh it's around the lord of redemption
[1:03:24] there was there's a lot
[1:03:26] of redemption and uh i i want to look at
[1:03:31] that a little bit here i will read read
[1:03:33] this from kingsman redeemer
[1:03:36] now remember
[1:03:39] praise the lord amen
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:56] praise the lord
[1:04:02] and well well we thank the lord okay

[1:04:28] children that can stop him
[1:04:30] when he's preaching
[1:04:35] praise the lord so let's let's read this
[1:04:38] tonight
[1:04:38] i want for us to look at this together
[1:04:41] and
[1:04:41] uh i know i know sometime back
[1:04:45] it should be a while now uh
[1:04:48] should be some years back we spoke on
[1:04:50] the redemption money
[1:04:52] i want to look into that a little bit uh
[1:04:55] not now to teach on it but uh
[1:04:58] to be able to draw something from there
[1:05:03] now remember the law
[1:05:06] of redemption as we are coming to close
[1:05:10] yeah oh the lord of redemption is
[1:05:13] this that before a man
[1:05:18] could redeem a lost property
[1:05:22] he had to be a nearest king's man
[1:05:26] and the next thing he had to be
[1:05:29] an upright man a just man
[1:05:33] to do it and then he had
[1:05:37] to be worth enough money
[1:05:41] to do it and then he had to make
[1:05:44] a public testimony that
[1:05:47] he had done it and from then on
[1:05:52] it was his property now in that sense
[1:05:55] is talking about the requirement or the
[1:05:58] qualification
[1:05:59] of the one that will be redeeming
[1:06:02] praise the lord but i i was looking at
[1:06:06] the the
[1:06:07] the lord of redemption just looking a
[1:06:09] few
[1:06:10] uh uh notes on that uh uh
[1:06:14] and then i i kind of throw that one in
[1:06:18] now let's go back to the book of numbers
[1:06:20] chapter 3.
[1:06:23] let's go back to the book of numbers
[1:06:25] chapter 3
[1:06:27] praise the lord and
[1:06:30] uh and and the reason why i want to go
[1:06:33] into this
[1:06:35] is the other
[1:06:38] sometimes and many times as as
[1:06:42] as believers as christians as
[1:06:46] people that stayed around church go to
[1:06:48] church
[1:06:49] believe in god we turn
[1:06:53] now to appreciate what forgiveness
[1:06:56] is praise the lord
[1:07:00] amen that's right we term now to
[1:07:02] appreciate what forgiveness
[1:07:04] is it become a slogan sometimes for us
[1:07:07] jesus died on the cross my sins are
[1:07:09] forgiving
[1:07:10] but if you look at it as we will look at
[1:07:13] it a little bit tonight you will realize
[1:07:16] that god cannot be a just god
[1:07:22] praise the lord to forgive a man
[1:07:27] or a woman when they do wrong
[1:07:37] god cannot be a just god
[1:07:42] because when you talk about justice
[1:07:47] a price have to be paid right that's
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:51] so for the person to do wrong
[1:07:54] and you are just forgiving it's not
[1:07:57] justice
[1:08:02] are you are you with me tonight praise
[1:08:05] the lord
[1:08:08] if i just run around the tree and you
[1:08:10] can't see me
[1:08:12] i'm still here
[1:08:16] praise the lord for the person to do
[1:08:20] wrong
[1:08:21] i repeat myself and just be
[1:08:24] forgiving that's not justice
[1:08:32] so forgiveness comes with a price
[1:08:37] that's right brother yes
[1:08:40] it comes with a price thank you jesus
[1:08:43] are we together
[1:08:47] and it's it's hitting on the lord of
[1:08:49] redemption
[1:08:51] so we want to look at that a little bit
[1:08:53] tonight
[1:08:54] literally to god amen
[1:08:59] number chap numbers chapter 12.
[1:09:08] we'll go back it will take us all the
[1:09:10] way back to
[1:09:12] to to egypt when almighty god remember
[1:09:16] his promise that he gave to
[1:09:19] our father abraham he's seven how he
[1:09:22] will come down with the mighty hands
[1:09:25] and he will bring israel out of the land
[1:09:27] of egypt
[1:09:28] and we know the story when god came down
[1:09:32] and uh and displayed himself
[1:09:35] in all of those plagues that came upon
[1:09:37] the egyptians
[1:09:40] we know the last
[1:09:44] flag was
[1:09:48] where god was requiring
[1:09:51] the life of all
[1:09:54] the firstborn
[1:09:58] praise the lord he was requiring the
[1:10:01] life
[1:10:02] of all the firstborn
[1:10:08] the firstborn of the egyptians and the
[1:10:11] firstborn of the hebrews
[1:10:14] he was requiring the life of
[1:10:17] all the firstborn
[1:10:21] are we together but
[1:10:26] for the hebrews first born
[1:10:30] he gave them a substitute
[1:10:36] he told he told them to take a lamb
[1:10:39] kill the lamb and put the blood
[1:10:44] of the lamb on the doorpost
[1:10:50] i don't care if you were born of the
[1:10:53] tribe of benjamin or the tribe
[1:10:56] of of of of of joseph or the tribe
[1:11:00] whatever tribe you were born of i don't
[1:11:03] care if you were second size on the
[1:11:05] eighth day i don't care if you have kept
[1:11:07] all the commandments of god
[1:11:10] if that household refused
[1:11:15] to kill the lamb and put the blood on
[1:11:17] the doorpost
[1:11:19] the firstborn of that house was going to
[1:11:22] die just like
[1:11:23] an egyptian firstborn
[1:11:27] so god was requiring the life
[1:11:31] of all the firstborn
[1:11:36] many times we think that it was the
[1:11:39] egyptian firstborn
[1:11:41] but he was requiring the life of
[1:11:44] every firstborn because
[1:11:47] god himself he's the firstborn
[1:11:50] [Laughter]
[1:11:52] he gave birth to himself yes he's
[1:11:55] at firstborn praise the lord
[1:12:00] and we know the story how the death
[1:12:03] angel came and when the deaf angels saw
[1:12:07] the first born that was represented on
[1:12:10] that door post
[1:12:11] he back up
[1:12:14] praise the lord so for god
[1:12:18] to spare the firstborn of the hebrews
[1:12:25] he had to pay the price
[1:12:31] are we together
[1:12:34] now so
[1:12:37] after the egyptians saw
[1:12:42] i mean every house every house was
[1:12:45] weeping
[1:12:47] every house was broken
[1:12:54] even the house of pharaoh
[1:12:58] and when god brought the churn of israel
[1:13:00] out
[1:13:02] into the wilderness then he turned to
[1:13:05] the elders of israel through the prophet
[1:13:07] moses
[1:13:09] and he said to them
[1:13:16] that i spare your firstborn
[1:13:23] now because
[1:13:30] they had a special birth
[1:13:33] praise the lord now because they were
[1:13:37] born in a special city
[1:13:39] or at a special hospital i spare your
[1:13:42] firstborn because
[1:13:43] all firstborn are mine
[1:13:49] and he established
[1:13:53] with moses and the elders of israel
[1:13:56] that every firstborn
[1:13:59] will be given to him
[1:14:05] praise the lord
[1:14:08] now so you see
[1:14:14] god told him to put the blood on the
[1:14:17] doorpost
[1:14:18] he told them the death angel was coming
[1:14:21] he told them he was going to distract
[1:14:23] the firstborn
[1:14:24] and everything and and and and that they
[1:14:28] saw the miracle of god they saw the hand
[1:14:30] of god they saw the protection of god
[1:14:32] they saw how god moving and took them
[1:14:35] open the rear seat and everything
[1:14:37] praise the lord and all of these
[1:14:40] wonderful things that god was doing for
[1:14:42] them providing for them in the
[1:14:44] wilderness and bringing them out
[1:14:46] i mean those people were walking on
[1:14:49] their feet
[1:14:51] they were hearing the sounds of the
[1:14:54] cherubs behind him
[1:14:56] praise the lord and those chairs were
[1:14:59] brand new cherish the best terror in the
[1:15:02] world at that time
[1:15:04] because egypt was like a superpower
[1:15:07] but yet they could not meet up to people
[1:15:10] walking on their feet
[1:15:14] why because god was walking with them
[1:15:19] we could all we could talk about speed
[1:15:21] [Laughter]
[1:15:23] we could talk about speed the same way
[1:15:25] that uh
[1:15:26] elijah could not make it with ahab
[1:15:30] right elijah was walking
[1:15:35] and air was in his chair
[1:15:39] but yet ahab could not catch up with
[1:15:40] elijah before he got there elijah was
[1:15:43] waiting for him
[1:15:44] you see i've been here almost two hours
[1:15:46] waiting for you buddy
[1:15:51] glory be to god amen amen
[1:15:54] now saul this was
[1:15:58] established with israel that every first
[1:16:01] born
[1:16:02] will be given to the lord
[1:16:11] so with that being said
[1:16:17] over the time god
[1:16:21] established with israel let's read here
[1:16:25] the
[1:16:25] numbers chapter 3 verse 11 and the law
[1:16:28] speaks unto moses saying
[1:16:31] and i behold i have taken the levites
[1:16:35] from among the children of israel
[1:16:37] instead of the firstborn
[1:16:39] thou openeth the military among the
[1:16:41] children of israel therefore the levi
[1:16:44] shall be mine because all the firstborn
[1:16:47] are mine
[1:16:49] for all that they that are smart all the
[1:16:52] firstborn in the land of
[1:16:54] egypt are hollow on unto me all the
[1:16:57] firstborn
[1:16:58] in israel both first born
[1:17:01] both men and beasts mine shall they be
[1:17:05] i am the lord praise the lord
[1:17:10] now so god
[1:17:14] this telling uh uh uh moses
[1:17:17] he have he have taken these uh uh uh
[1:17:20] uh people the the levites and and
[1:17:24] and and that is the reason why the
[1:17:25] levites did not had inheritance because
[1:17:28] the levites belong to the lord
[1:17:31] okay but you will see it as you read
[1:17:34] them
[1:17:38] because god took the levite and said
[1:17:41] because i've taken the levite instead of
[1:17:44] the
[1:17:44] the firstborn did not mean that
[1:17:47] the firstborn were freed and the
[1:17:49] firstborn were no more gods
[1:17:51] no what happened is that as you read in
[1:17:54] exit and in other places you realize
[1:17:56] that
[1:17:57] this thing was established called the
[1:18:00] redemption money
[1:18:04] the redemption money so
[1:18:07] uh a family will come
[1:18:10] and and pay that's the reason why the
[1:18:12] redemption money was given to the
[1:18:14] levites because
[1:18:16] god now has taken the levites on behalf
[1:18:19] of the firstborn
[1:18:21] praise the lord amen amen
[1:18:26] so
[1:18:29] the the the the the redemption money a
[1:18:33] family would come and and whatever was
[1:18:35] required
[1:18:37] they would come and pay that money over
[1:18:40] to to to the tabernacle and it would be
[1:18:43] given to the levites
[1:18:45] and uh uh and and on and on it was
[1:18:47] something
[1:18:48] that was done all you know uh
[1:18:51] all through the time of israel
[1:18:56] but you realize here that word
[1:19:00] that language that paul used in
[1:19:02] ephesians
[1:19:03] talking about the earnest of our
[1:19:06] inheritance
[1:19:08] goes back to the redemption money
[1:19:18] praise the lord
[1:19:22] amen
[1:19:32] so just like i said have you ever heard
[1:19:36] the saying that says freedom is not free
[1:19:42] praise the lord
[1:19:45] and people would abuse it the people
[1:19:47] that abuse it they don't have no
[1:19:48] idea what really freedom is
[1:19:52] praise the lord if people
[1:19:56] knew what it cost
[1:20:00] for us to be living in a free country
[1:20:04] and don't have the government spotting
[1:20:06] on every family
[1:20:09] praise the lord tracing your child
[1:20:12] breath
[1:20:13] and controlling your wages and
[1:20:14] controlling how many children
[1:20:16] you can have and how much you can own
[1:20:18] and what
[1:20:19] everything you can own sometimes
[1:20:25] people don't have no idea
[1:20:29] praise the lord amen
[1:20:32] that's the reason why they want
[1:20:35] everything free
[1:20:37] because they think freedom is free
[1:20:41] they want the government to pay the
[1:20:43] house rent the government to do
[1:20:45] this for them the government to do that
[1:20:47] for them and and i mean the system has
[1:20:50] been so abused
[1:20:54] because people think that freedom is
[1:20:57] free
[1:20:59] all of those things was where were put
[1:21:01] in place
[1:21:03] for people
[1:21:06] that were in need to benefit from it
[1:21:11] praise the lord and you know as i was
[1:21:14] as i was i was telling i was really uh
[1:21:18] uh looking into some things and
[1:21:20] listening to some things i
[1:21:22] realized that even the government
[1:21:25] our present day the modern day
[1:21:27] government around the world
[1:21:29] has become so corrupt
[1:21:32] that the government
[1:21:38] i'm trying to look for the word not a
[1:21:39] political correct word but a right word
[1:21:42] amen i don't want to be politically
[1:21:45] correct i just want to say the right
[1:21:47] thing
[1:21:49] the government
[1:21:53] enjoy let me let me say it this way they
[1:21:55] love when there is
[1:21:58] social crisis
[1:22:01] because it has always been a way
[1:22:04] that a corrupt government has always
[1:22:07] used to bring
[1:22:10] more laws either to control the people
[1:22:14] or to introduce
[1:22:17] a weight off
[1:22:24] eat up more spending
[1:22:28] because for them to be able to
[1:22:31] to steal they have to just create the
[1:22:33] money it looks like there is more money
[1:22:35] there for more things to be done
[1:22:42] but what i'm talking about tonight
[1:22:46] is that because if you even look at this
[1:22:49] this lord
[1:22:51] on the redemption year of the redemption
[1:22:53] money
[1:22:54] the same thing was used on a corrupt
[1:22:58] church system the catholic church used
[1:23:01] that
[1:23:04] oh yeah when they have people paying
[1:23:07] money for souls to be prey out of
[1:23:09] purgatory
[1:23:18] but what we're talking about tonight is
[1:23:21] for
[1:23:22] us to be able to appreciate
[1:23:27] when you think that i'm forgiving
[1:23:34] it came with a prize
[1:23:39] praise the lord it came with a prize
[1:23:45] because you have to realize that
[1:23:49] if if there is no price to it it would
[1:23:51] temper with god
[1:23:52] justice right that's right sure
[1:23:57] praise the lord because
[1:24:02] the lord of god which is a law
[1:24:06] is a law that is in nature whatever you
[1:24:08] saw
[1:24:10] that you will reap it's a law that is in
[1:24:13] nature you don't put
[1:24:14] a mango seeds to the ground and get
[1:24:17] oranges
[1:24:18] right
[1:24:23] praise the lord now so
[1:24:28] it helped us to be able to look at that
[1:24:31] and uh you know and and appreciate that
[1:24:33] someone
[1:24:35] took our place
[1:24:39] amen for you to be able to appreciate
[1:24:45] your forgiveness
[1:24:49] like the old saying that said the
[1:24:51] pattern is not a pattern until
[1:24:53] it has been accepted as a pattern
[1:24:58] praise the lord
[1:25:02] but don't you have haven't you seen it
[1:25:05] sometimes
[1:25:06] with people maybe family member or so
[1:25:10] and then you're i mean just a talk of uh
[1:25:13] and you say it's uh
[1:25:15] well okay i forget about it you know i
[1:25:17] forgive you
[1:25:20] and that person had no remorse
[1:25:23] no sense to even accept it
[1:25:28] praise the lord
[1:25:31] it's because there is a there is a
[1:25:35] misunderstanding of that word
[1:25:39] forgiveness people just think they are
[1:25:43] the
[1:25:43] you know it's one of those things you
[1:25:46] know uh uh
[1:25:47] freely giving that is freely given to us
[1:25:51] well yeah it's freely giving you don't
[1:25:53] have to work for it
[1:25:54] you don't have to pay for it but
[1:25:56] somebody paid for it
[1:25:59] there was a price
[1:26:09] praise the lord now it's almost like
[1:26:13] if you go to the neighbor house you take
[1:26:15] that we borrow or you take something
[1:26:17] from the neighbor
[1:26:18] what are the the hulk or the rake or
[1:26:20] whatever it is and then
[1:26:23] they give it to you and and and and
[1:26:26] you have no sense to realize that this
[1:26:28] person paid money for this
[1:26:33] well that's that's my neighbor we are
[1:26:34] good bodies you know he borrowed my
[1:26:36] thing i bought his and
[1:26:38] and and then you just you just destroy
[1:26:40] it
[1:26:46] praise the lord
[1:26:50] but just for you to put in the back of
[1:26:52] your mind
[1:26:53] i don't know how much he paid for it
[1:26:55] could be a dime or it could be 200
[1:26:58] so what whatever he pay for but to put
[1:27:00] at the back of your mind that he paid
[1:27:02] something for this realizing that there
[1:27:06] was a price that was paid
[1:27:08] it makes you to cherish it
[1:27:14] it makes you to take care of it
[1:27:20] praise the lord and that is the same
[1:27:22] thing with christian life today
[1:27:24] because people do not pop the prize that
[1:27:27] was paid for their forgiveness
[1:27:30] they don't cherish their christian life
[1:27:32] they just think that well i can pray god
[1:27:34] will forgive me i go back and commit sin
[1:27:36] i can pray you know he's a loving god he
[1:27:37] will forgive me they don't cherish it
[1:27:43] yes sir brother yes sir you just run in
[1:27:45] and out of sin and just live in a kind
[1:27:47] of a life
[1:27:49] because he's a loving god he's a you
[1:27:52] know he's a forgiving father
[1:27:55] but he don't realize that every time
[1:27:59] that god will forgive a man
[1:28:04] he had to look to the price that's right
[1:28:07] that was paid
[1:28:12] right
[1:28:15] praise the lord do you know that's the
[1:28:18] reason why
[1:28:20] the near sky body of jesus sat at the
[1:28:23] right hand of the father
[1:28:25] as a memorial
[1:28:33] because that was the price
[1:28:42] praise the lord
[1:28:45] just like how israel kept the body
[1:28:48] of joseph asa memorial
[1:28:51] when joseph died they embalmed him and
[1:28:54] they kept his body
[1:28:56] as a memorial his body reminded them
[1:29:02] that one of these days we will be out of
[1:29:04] here
[1:29:05] yeah because joseph told them don't bury
[1:29:07] him in here that's right
[1:29:09] that's right that's right
[1:29:13] and he's a type of christ
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:21] are we together
[1:29:25] praise the lord
[1:29:29] now so
[1:29:36] my mind is just all over the place bear
[1:29:38] with me now
[1:29:42] praise the lord amen
[1:29:47] glory be to god
[1:29:53] there is a price
[1:29:58] because sin cannot go
[1:30:04] unpunished
[1:30:06] no sin cannot go to punish
[1:30:10] and you see the thing about the good
[1:30:12] lord
[1:30:13] is that
[1:30:18] when our father adam and eve
[1:30:22] sinned in the garden of eden
[1:30:25] we know that god drove them from the
[1:30:28] garden
[1:30:29] praise the lord but before he drove them
[1:30:33] out of the garden he dead
[1:30:36] with sin right in the garden that's
[1:30:38] right
[1:30:40] that's right praise the lord
[1:30:43] he dared with it right there right
[1:30:47] he he spoke to adam
[1:30:52] he spoke to eve
[1:30:57] that's god's justice
[1:31:00] that sin cannot go unpunished
[1:31:05] praise the lord
[1:31:08] and do you know that's the reason why
[1:31:13] there will have to be a general
[1:31:14] resurrection
[1:31:16] sure
[1:31:20] because all sin was committed here on
[1:31:22] earth
[1:31:24] god is not going to join sin in heaven
[1:31:28] it was committed right here so the white
[1:31:30] turned judgment is going to be right
[1:31:32] here on earth
[1:31:36] because that's god's justice
[1:31:42] praise the lord that's his justice
[1:31:48] so when they are going there when the
[1:31:49] apostle paul says
[1:31:51] there is no condemnation
[1:31:55] to them that are in christ
[1:31:59] when jesus said he that believer remain
[1:32:02] is passed from death unto life
[1:32:05] something has taken place
[1:32:11] praise the lord what am i talking to now
[1:32:14] where
[1:32:14] where am i driving you uh this this
[1:32:17] prayer meeting night
[1:32:21] it's learning to appreciate that's right
[1:32:26] our forgiveness a man and a woman
[1:32:31] that learn to appreciate being forgiving
[1:32:34] it puts you to the place where paul says
[1:32:37] there is no condemnation
[1:32:40] it is not that also
[1:32:44] that there is no condemnation that you
[1:32:46] are not condemned
[1:32:47] but you don't even have condemnation in
[1:32:49] your heart for anybody
[1:32:53] you don't feel condemned and it's not so
[1:32:56] easy for you to condemn another person
[1:33:00] sure praise the lord
[1:33:05] well if you leave it with man they want
[1:33:07] all of god's mercy and all of god's
[1:33:10] forgiveness
[1:33:11] but the next guy lord you judge him
[1:33:16] you deal with him
[1:33:20] for me my own sin was not too big
[1:33:27] praise the lord
[1:33:30] thank you if you appreciate it
[1:33:36] for many of our children born in the
[1:33:38] faith
[1:33:40] parents drag us to church from small
[1:33:44] we look around our shoulder and then we
[1:33:45] ask ourselves what sin have i done
[1:33:50] praise the lord that's why many young
[1:33:54] people around the church around the
[1:33:56] message
[1:33:57] they don't appreciate the grace that has
[1:33:59] come to them
[1:34:03] praise the lord because they keep asking
[1:34:04] i said well wrong have i done
[1:34:06] they think that they have to go and get
[1:34:07] themselves in some kind of a trouble
[1:34:13] praise the lord
[1:34:17] either run around and and and and mess
[1:34:20] with friends and
[1:34:21] you know and and and get ourselves into
[1:34:23] crazy thing on drugs or
[1:34:24] wrong with boys and and you know and and
[1:34:27] and get pregnant or something like that
[1:34:30] sure
[1:34:33] to be able to experience god's
[1:34:35] forgiveness
[1:34:38] right from your birth praise the lord
[1:34:42] like david said in sin did my mother
[1:34:47] conceive me
[1:34:51] praise the lord when we were born into
[1:34:54] this world we were born
[1:34:56] seen us
[1:34:59] we were born under the law of sin
[1:35:06] glory be to god you see that's the
[1:35:09] reason why
[1:35:11] uh uh you know uh since you can
[1:35:14] you can really put yourself to the place
[1:35:17] to claim and think that you are doing
[1:35:21] something for god
[1:35:26] right
[1:35:28] praise the lord amen
[1:35:31] for one to really come to the place and
[1:35:33] think that i'm doing something for the
[1:35:35] lord
[1:35:36] it's a it's a little bit
[1:35:40] awful sin of pride that gets under the
[1:35:44] flesh
[1:35:47] sure what the jesus said
[1:35:51] in saint john chapter 6
[1:35:54] they came unto him and said lord
[1:35:58] how can we do the greater works
[1:36:02] praise the lord they said they said
[1:36:05] master how can we do the greater works
[1:36:07] he said for you to do the greater works
[1:36:09] you have to believe
[1:36:12] believe on him
[1:36:17] whom was saying
[1:36:20] oh how it's so hard to do that one
[1:36:23] praise the lord amen
[1:36:26] it's so hard to do that
[1:36:34] because that word belief runs deep
[1:36:37] it means to trust
[1:36:42] remember the scripture there says it did
[1:36:44] not only say believe they say believe
[1:36:47] on
[1:36:51] believe on him whom was seen
[1:36:55] it's a word that has
[1:36:58] a sense of to trust to put into his
[1:37:02] hands
[1:37:03] not just believe as a mental conception
[1:37:07] because many believe just as a mental
[1:37:10] conception i believe
[1:37:11] god i know he died for my sin
[1:37:15] but they have not trusted himself into
[1:37:18] his hands
[1:37:26] that's the same thing that uh peter said
[1:37:29] to the the philippian jail or peter or
[1:37:31] paul
[1:37:32] believe on the lord jesus believe
[1:37:36] on
[1:37:39] ye and your household will be saved
[1:37:50] glory be to god
[1:37:53] praise the lord amen
[1:37:57] you know sunday i was talking about
[1:38:00] making love
[1:38:01] with jesus
[1:38:04] praise the lord oh i just i just enjoyed
[1:38:08] our worship after the service on sunday
[1:38:10] it just i mean it just took everything
[1:38:12] out of me
[1:38:14] praise the lord that's the thing my
[1:38:16] heart longed for
[1:38:21] praise the lord you know just like david
[1:38:24] said
[1:38:27] in this time how he used his pillows
[1:38:32] and he hugged his pillows and he went
[1:38:37] until his pillows were not only wet with
[1:38:39] tears they would stink
[1:38:41] of tears
[1:38:47] a little bit to god now so
[1:38:51] ah okay i'll soon leave you so we can go
[1:38:54] home tonight
[1:38:56] uh i know many of you traveling um
[1:39:00] down to washington we will be praying
[1:39:03] for you
[1:39:09] so uh you know i was i was thinking
[1:39:12] about this this just crossed my mind
[1:39:14] today
[1:39:15] as i was i was uh meditating
[1:39:19] and i i just i went back and looked at a
[1:39:21] few scriptures tonight i says wow yeah
[1:39:24] and that the thing that was that was
[1:39:25] that was really hitting me
[1:39:27] in the top was how much
[1:39:31] do we appreciate being forgiving
[1:39:36] it's not what you say it's your attitude
[1:39:45] it's your attitude praise the lord
[1:39:50] amen that's the reason why in the gospel
[1:39:54] jesus gave that parable where the king
[1:39:57] has to
[1:39:58] to to throw that man in prison because
[1:40:01] he was forgiving
[1:40:02] of his debts but he could not forgive
[1:40:08] his neighbor down the street that had
[1:40:09] just had a little debt
[1:40:11] when he had a big debt
[1:40:15] praise the law so you see it was his
[1:40:17] attitude
[1:40:19] no matter what he what he told the king
[1:40:22] oh thank you
[1:40:23] you are so gracious you know you you're
[1:40:25] so kind to me thank you
[1:40:27] my wife and my children i mean we will
[1:40:29] save you the rest of our life
[1:40:32] sure no matter what he said
[1:40:36] but it was his attitude when he went
[1:40:39] away
[1:40:41] praise the lord forgiveness is something
[1:40:46] that affects the believer's attitude
[1:40:51] because it's not only there to forgive
[1:40:53] you of the odd
[1:40:54] but it's to free you from guilt
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:01] it's a word that freed the believer from
[1:41:03] guilt you don't have to look over your
[1:41:05] shoulders
[1:41:06] you don't have to fuss at people when
[1:41:08] they say well you know you did that
[1:41:10] before
[1:41:10] you don't have to fuss back
[1:41:14] praise the lord what are you fighting
[1:41:15] for you are already forgiving
[1:41:22] praise the lord
[1:41:27] you know that's what the devil does he's
[1:41:28] just coming and remind you of all you
[1:41:31] uh you have done just to put you in a
[1:41:34] fighting black move
[1:41:39] praise the lord
[1:41:42] because he knows the purpose
[1:41:45] of forgiving is not just so you can hold
[1:41:49] attack on you
[1:41:53] it's for you to be justified
[1:41:57] not just coming on a status
[1:42:01] but it's an experience that frees you
[1:42:04] from guilt
[1:42:06] it delivers you from haunting memories
[1:42:18] praise the lord because
[1:42:23] you know if it was just i mean just just
[1:42:27] a vic word if it was just a sentence
[1:42:29] that was said
[1:42:30] you are forgiving right
[1:42:35] but it comes it brings it brings the sin
[1:42:38] of a price that was paid
[1:42:45] it makes you to ever be grateful
[1:42:51] that someone took your place
[1:42:57] there is no room
[1:43:01] for a little eye than a big you
[1:43:05] there is no room of throwing your
[1:43:07] shoulders
[1:43:09] man uh i don't want to go into that
[1:43:11] tonight but
[1:43:13] it kind of blew my mind
[1:43:16] i was looking at something here in the
[1:43:18] scripture and it just blew my mind
[1:43:23] and i've been i've been studying on that
[1:43:25] a little bit
[1:43:27] where god says jacob
[1:43:30] i love and easer i hate
[1:43:35] that's a very strong word
[1:43:40] that's a very strong word
[1:43:44] let me take you down that road a little
[1:43:46] bit
[1:43:48] you will realize that god
[1:43:51] told rebecca
[1:43:55] of the two sons that was in her womb
[1:44:00] praise the lord and you were even
[1:44:04] realized that
[1:44:06] all the time that isa and jacob
[1:44:10] i mean jacob uh uh esau saw his uh
[1:44:14] birthright he you know he took the
[1:44:16] politician you know and
[1:44:17] and jacob came and disguised himself and
[1:44:20] and his father blessing and all of that
[1:44:23] you will realize that
[1:44:25] in genesis read the story about israel
[1:44:29] and jacob in genesis
[1:44:31] god never mentioned in genesis
[1:44:37] it's now stated there in genesis jacob i
[1:44:41] love
[1:44:41] israel i hate
[1:44:45] that statement came years down the road
[1:44:54] it came years down the road
[1:44:58] and the root cause for that sickness was
[1:45:01] pride
[1:45:04] when when easter realized that his
[1:45:07] father has given all the blessing to
[1:45:09] jacob
[1:45:10] the bible says he went and took a
[1:45:13] canaanite
[1:45:13] woman because he wanted to get back to
[1:45:16] his parents
[1:45:18] sure
[1:45:25] out of pride
[1:45:29] so if you look back and you realize that
[1:45:31] we will get into that
[1:45:33] when you realized that you would realize
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:36] what god hated was not the child
[1:45:42] easer
[1:45:44] it was a pride that went
[1:45:47] with his generation
[1:45:54] the act was committed in genesis and it
[1:45:58] was in malachi
[1:45:59] that god expressed jacob i love
[1:46:03] in easter i hate
[1:46:14] you love the lord tonight
[1:46:20] praise the lord freedom
[1:46:23] is not free
[1:46:27] for you to appreciate your forgiveness
[1:46:31] you have to keep the price in mind
[1:46:37] you have to always keep the price
[1:46:41] in mind
[1:46:45] the worshiper is never on our
[1:46:46] examination
[1:46:49] it's a sacrifice that is honor
[1:46:52] examination
[1:46:54] musicians you can come tonight let's
[1:46:57] just buy our heads to the lord
[1:47:00] and begin to praise him and appreciate
[1:47:06] him
[1:47:23] let's just pray together
[1:47:29] let's thank the lord
[1:47:35] over there in the book of trinity paul
[1:47:36] talked about in the last day how people
[1:47:38] will be very
[1:47:40] unthankful and we're living in a
[1:47:42] generation where people
[1:47:45] have no sense of really being thankful
[1:47:50] because there's a generation
[1:47:53] that is seeking entitlement
[1:47:57] living in a generation where people
[1:47:59] think they are entitled
[1:48:01] they have a right they gotta fight for
[1:48:04] every right
[1:48:06] because they are entitled their sense of
[1:48:09] entitledness is taking
[1:48:10] gratefulness from the society
[1:48:16] because if you are entitled to it why
[1:48:19] should you be thankful
[1:48:20] it's for you anyway
[1:48:26] so the expression of thankfulness
[1:48:30] gratefulness
[1:48:34] and people were always both how they
[1:48:37] work
[1:48:38] to buy themselves a house and and and
[1:48:40] and i labored and i saved them money
[1:48:43] and then you know i studied hard to get
[1:48:45] a good job
[1:48:46] and and you know and and it's just it's
[1:48:48] just entitlement
[1:48:54] it's just entitlement
[1:48:58] and because of that
[1:49:01] people are not thankful
[1:49:08] no matter what you do
[1:49:12] did you see it for you to be
[1:49:16] thankful
[1:49:20] you have to go beyond the person
[1:49:24] for you to be appreciate forgiveness you
[1:49:28] got to keep the price in mind
[1:49:30] for you to appreciate freedom
[1:49:33] you got to think about
[1:49:37] the man that lose their lives
[1:49:48] old church
[1:49:51] young children
[1:49:58] if we can bring thanks to god
[1:50:05] when we say lord i thank you
[1:50:10] and we don't know what we are saying
[1:50:19] if we just say lord i thank you
[1:50:26] if you don't know what you are saying
