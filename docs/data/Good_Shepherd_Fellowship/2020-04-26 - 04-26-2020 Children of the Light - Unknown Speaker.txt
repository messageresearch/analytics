just have had a wonderful morning already that a man just want to say it's good to serve the Lord he begin our service we're gonna sing that song and see the bright light shine there's a lie in the window and the tables spread in splendor someone's standing by the open door I can see the Crystal River well I must be here forever well I've never been this home sick before sees a bright light

his a fellow that was a head of the bio science lab or United States it's actually a special lab and they look at specifically at different viruses and try to figure out how they work in things and anyway they were talking about that this particular virus that it thrives in 70 degrees in low humidity which is exactly what it is inside of buildings and inside your house they said that the half-life on that particular virus is about an hour on a non-porous surface which would be like your countertops your door handles different things along that line but if you get it out in the sunlight a minute and a half and it's all it's out of there and so I just like that I just was excited I had to call brother bought a yesterday preached at him for a little while that's a brother and

praise the Lord we want to thank the Lord for his is wonderful blessing this morning [Music] last on the Wednesday we've been talking about darkness this morning we'll be talking about children of the life we have in a little more than to cover so we will speed a little bit this morning thank you sister now me praise the Lord I let you scroll right to the word this morning in st. John chapter 12 st. John chapter 2 earth it's in John chapter 12 we will read from verse 35 Saint John chapter 12 we're gonna read from verse 35 let's pray before we read the word Heavenly Father you are the author of this word Lord Jesus we've been taught no may have a right law to open this world without talking to the altar because father God we could go in there Lord Jesus with all that we know and come out with nothing well we want to trust you this morning father Lord Jesus we want to ask your permission law of father and your blessing upon the scripture that we will read or God the Father you will be able to annoyed us Lord and inspire us together as your children father we we just commit ourself in your hands now what a wonderful father you are what a faithful God to you be the praise to you be the glory and honor we love you and we appreciate you together this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen see John chapter 12 reading from verse 35 then jesus said unto them yet a little why is the light with you walk ye have the light least darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth net whether he goeth ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things speak Jesus and departed and did hate himself from them but all he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed net on him they are the same of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he speak Lord who have believed our report and whom have their arm of the Lord being revealed now now I want to suggest the LOB lessons you can have your seat I wanted to just read this together because this part of the scripture came very very very beautiful to me this morning that the saying of his ire the Prophet might be fulfilled which he speak Lord who have believed our report and to whom have the arm of the Lord been revealed therefore they could not believe because that as I said again he have blinded their eyes and have hide in their heart that they should not see with their eyes don't understand with their heart and be converted and as you healed him this thing said his eye when he saw his glory and speak with him now this was a stricture that caught my eyes because when when as I saw the glory of the Lord as I chapter 6 and you we have to realize I mean he went down there in the temple and I mean he just pour himself before the Lord he confessed his weakness before God he says Lord woe is me I'm a man on done and a man of unclean lips and the scripture told Adam and injure came with a life called and tasha sleep and and then God could now Commission him who will go for us now here is the beauty in the scripture you now remember this is Jesus our Lord and now trying to show us the fulfillment of the scripture now he's taking who have believed our report that is Isaiah chapter 53 you know there was what he talked about he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquity but see what Jesus is saying there Isaiah after he have had that experience of the glory of the Lord then now he could stead the sign of the future his ministry change after he had an experience word the angel came then wish of course brother branham make us to understand that heavenly being came down and influenced him you know that's why the prophet who said he preached the whole Bible and right after that experience as I had chapter 14 he talks about Luke Lucifer being cast down he talks about the Millennium so right after that when he experienced the glory of the Lord his ministry change God lifted him up so much in his presence that he could look into the future to talk about the coming millennium he could look into the past to talk about how Satan was cast down from heaven and and and that is the thing you know God lifted him up in so much light so much in his presence the glory of the Lord is the presence of light and I believe that he has lifted us into that glory there is just so much light around us that we can see the things that are happening because we've been warned we've been told it's being prophesied about so all he's saying come up higher come into my glory because there is no darkness in his glory his glory is the glory of light praise the Lord Jesus tying there to Isaiah when he saw the glory of the Lord I mean that was that was so beautiful this morning just looking at that and he walked in that glory he walked in the light so this morning we want to talk about the children of light now see now now as I said he said who have believed our report now and I talked to coast this morning from God in simplicity and that is just before the seals open and then affects you what random kind of four also draw on those on those coach their God in simplicity he says so listening to every word catch it compared ourself now with a liar the same way angels came from the presence of the law to influence him into the glory of the Lord we also had seven angels coming down to influence this bride into the glory of the Lord just like Jesus said the glory that I had with you before the world began we have a we had a glory before this word begin and we are going back to that glory and that glory is to be sons and daughters of God we cannot come less we can come nothing less than that that is our glory praise the Lord so he says so listening to every word catch it don't just listen but catch it because God is speaking and then you still write with that tape teaching don't say nothing about what that tape says just said just exactly what the tape says we are going to understand a whole lot about this now why is misunderstood you see and you be sure to say just what the tip says don't say nothing else I don't say that but my own is him that said it amen it's him that says it you see so many times confusion people will rise up and say well so and so said it means so in soul let's just leave it just the way it is seed that's that's the way we want the Bible just the way the Bible says it that's the way we want it just like that don't put no interpretation to it it's already interpreted if we will just read a little bit if we would just stay in the word a little bit we will see that it's already interpreted the word interprets itself praise the Lord now so just see see here now this is this is how the word interpret itself follow this a little bit now who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed let me read it again now closely who have believed our report question and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed I would say answer in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the Lord is revealed to you praise the Lord so you see the word interpret itself access own question and it gives you the answer in the sixth seal he also says this he says who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed seed believe the report then the arm of the Lord is revealed there arm the Word of God is revealed praise the Lord the arm of the Lord is the word of God praise the Lord Amen so this morning we want to talk a little bit on the children of light just like Jesus said here why you have light believe in the light that ye may be children of the light amen praise the Lord so we will look at children of the light but there is there's there's a court yet I want to share with you it comes it comes in handed as we talked about this Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let's let's read there he says now the only way he can do it for me to submit myself to him just yield myself and get myself out of the way and you get yourself out of the way if we can do that this morning amen praise the Lord Amen if we can just get ourselves out of the way just like I said Romans chapter 12 says presenting your body as a living sacrifice that is the way to here ourself just make yourself available you don't have to close your eyes and strain your mind and and you know and fight again just make yourself available say Lord I'm here for you I give my tops I give everything to you amen he says if you would get out of the wedding I would get out of the way now that's the only way together then we will see the Messiah just only myself won't do it you have to yield yourself and I have to yield myself praise the Lord and together the Messiah work among us so you have to yield yourself in your home I have to heal myself year and and together you know the Lord who will be able to work among us because we are his people chosen sanctified by his blood the Holy Spirit dwell in us now this is what I want to catch your attention now the Holy Spirit dwell in us listen to this like that little button being the Holy Spirit when it comes in baptismal form now you think about that name when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes brother Branham say it comes like that little button it comes like that little button then it just began to spray out because it's light so when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just like a little button down in your soul the more you yield to the word the more is spread out the more light begins to spread out in your body the more the members of your body starts to come to subjection so whether you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands what are you receiving by us chapter 2 speaking in tongues what are you receiving by us chapter 10 Peter why Peter speak the word the whole it goes for in whichever way you receive the Holy Ghost it comes as a little button down in your soul and sometimes that's the reason why some people receive it and they don't know because it's just a little button below scare that is down there and the more we hear to the word it starts to spray out it starts to spray out then your body starts to become lighter inning and and brighter amen he says when we get all the roots of bitterness and evil away from us God just take over and begin to move the Bible says and the Spirit of God moved in the beginning and he said let there be light because the move of God is light amen and as and as he move with light darkness have to go away darkness have to give way praise the Lord darkness have to give way amen praise the Lord Amy and I mean I'm so let's look at injure of the law 1951 this is just just introduction so we just see how the law would carry us here but we realize that the dark clouds are floating high now and there they are going to get darker according to that word and so and we are so thankful to know that we are children of the light tonight Amen or children of the light this morning praise the Lord that we have the light of God in us what is the lot of God that little button amen you might not feel it it is not for you to feel it who have believed our report that's what Jesus said if you have believed in the light then you are the children of the light children of the light tonight that we have the light of God in us and we are happy that our Heavenly Father have blessed us in this last name of pouring out his spirit giving us the Holy Spirit to live by and to enjoy now has given us great signs and one mysterious things to the word it's mysterious to the word but not mysterious to those who believe in you for we have been looking for this thing amen we have been looking for these days praise the Lord we have been looking for it you remember a Benjamin Franklin said I got it and he did not know what he got praise the Lord amen and we've been saying we are ready and we didn't know how much we are ready praise the Lord but we've been looking for this the a year are we we are facing the day that have been prophesied for us we are facing the the darkest day that have ever been on the earth never in a word history they have experienced something that just from an entire world economy or at once we are facing this but the little line has been India or this wine their little button has been Indian to bring light let's look at this other one again he sees and welcome Christ 1955 Jesus said you are the children of the light walk in the light and you won't walk in darkness he said he died walk in - darkness doesn't know where he's going he can see where he's going but a man that's walking in light listen to this name knows were his going you might have a little stumble but we are homeward bound amen praise the Lord you stumble you gather you know that you hell in whom will praise the Lord don't remain there get up let's go home together praise the Lord you might have a little stumble but get up because you are homeward bound you've been a child of the light and then there's one thing sure you know where you are going because you are walking in the light the devil might be blasting your mind your health might be in trouble your finance might be in trouble whatever it is you know where you are going amen praise the Lord you know where you are going because you are walking in the light praise the Lord Amen so we we want to start up with all of this praise the Lord I realized as I go go like this in sin Luke chapter 16 sin Luke chapter 16 we refer to their own now on Wednesday night that's where Jesus is in Luke chapter system children of the light sin Luke chapter 16 verse 8 that's what Jesus he said year and the LORD commanded the unjust evil because he had done wisely for the children that for the children of this world IND a generation wiser than the children of the light ok children of the light the children of this world in the eighth generation are wiser than the children of the light see what brother Brennan says here discerning the body of the law in 1959 he said the Bible said the children of darkness is wiser than that then wiser in in this word then the children of the light God liking his people on two ships they are not smart and intelligent they keep he keep them that way they ask they are so he can lead him he keep them that way so he can be able to lead him if you are trying to use your your intellectual thinking you right then buy out God sons of God are led by the Spirit of God amen so Jesus saying the children of this world are wiser than the children of light in this dear generation because we're been I'm saying God keep us that way because he wants us to be led by his spirit not led by what we are seeking out and figuring out for ourselves because sons of God are led by the Spirit of God amen praise the Lord all we just want to thank the Lord this morning having this subject the children of light we we we read first test to learn in chapter 5 in in a same regard word the Bible says we should not be as the ones that they're sleeping in darkness because we are children of the light now I want to come to this part of it before we go into our our subject here this morning amen yeah well I think maybe you might be you might have been praying this morning because you are almost running me out of notes amen praise the Lord Amen now let's look at this together let's study this together and maybe the Lord will help us here unveiling of God 1964 unveiling of God 1964 now I want to address this and I want you to to to kind of a stay with me here support me with year in this that what I want to address and and I just pray that it will all help us to be able to grab it together it would be a blessing for every one of us he says here the hour of the seven angel message all the mystery of God should be made known in that Elijah in this last hour how that Christ is put out of his church as the son of God how he's revealed as son of man again now you can understand that a little bit he's put out of the church world they have rejected the Holy Ghost as as the son of God but there's a group of people that has received Malachi for ministry there's a group of people that have received the son of man ministry so and I follow this now how dare the church is to be put in order and everything for the last day no creed nor denomination just absolutely there the the word living in the individual now I would I would like to make emphasis on that I would go back again the seven injured message all the mistress of God should be made known in the last name the church has rejected him the word has rejected him politics has rejected him but there is a group of people there is a elected people they have recognized that son of man ministry now what is the son of man what is the importance of a listener as we follow this code together how that the church is to be put in order so the entire church order and the church is to be put in order now it's not the building is the people the people have to be put in order so you see church order that was given to us was not just a creed for message believer it was an order to prepare a people it was an order to prepare a people because these people are going to be God's tabernacle so you see the church order was something under the honor the seals that's the reason why you find you find brother Branham you're tying it to the mistress of God that is supposed to be revealed so I'm saying this this morning because Yura said that we are not in our church building you are in your home's but are you keeping Church order are you having an order for the word or do you just take it like your home so well you can go in the kitchen and and and you can be making notes you can be running all over the place and I mean that would just show that even if you were in church your spirit would be ruling because the reason of the church other is to be able to prepare us to receive the word that's why we come early and we prayed and we meditate to be able to prepare our spirit to be able to receive the word see what he says here church order and everything for the last year nor creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual that's the reason of church order so the word can live in the individual the moment where we give reverence and respect to the world now you will soon see where I'm going with this that's what I ask you to support me this morning bear with me Amen he says there's no strain there is no denomination there is no bounding nothing is the heart with God in him alone the heart is not a church building it's your heart with God so if if church order is not a revelation to you if Church other is not a reverence movement to you if you only want to be in the building before you can be referenced before God oh you wouldn't want to be in a building before I mean you think you can keep quiet how are you going to hear from God God speaks in your home as well he says it is the heart with God and him alone notice there in him of flesh Moses with that word the word was very Moses the heart with God in him alone speaking what speaking what was to be later put behind badger skin so is Christ our Moses christ is our moses god was he was God vo a hymn of flesh vo in humanity in flesh that's right and he is the same yesterday today and forever the same way he was veiled in Moses the same way he was veiled in Christ he want to be veiled in the bright he want to be he want to be veil in the bride it's the heart with God in him alone so you see I you know I was I was thinking about this in instead in this morning this thing caught my attention you know to think about it this way that you know with with with everything that is going on and God would just I mean a God who have allowed things to be to the place work oh this the church could be the most serious place and the government can say well yet let all the Christians go to church because you know we really need God so you're going pray you know we stop people we close everything down but we will not close the church they have already rejected Christ they have rejected Christ so the the the the preference for church is net is I mean it's it's not their animal so church is just like a business like every other business you know needle be shut down but you see God has allowed it for us to be in our homes for us to be in our home for this thing to come as a reality to us this is not a society we are not called to a society this is not a cut the church is not an organization even though is an all in our body that is organized by the Holy Spirit but it's not an organization where we can just take a nametag and put it on ourselves and and survive honor that name tight the only thing we can survive honor is the Holy Spirit dwelling in the individual it's that little button spreading out in your members jesus said my sheep will hear my voice he wants to speak to you he wants to speak to you so whether you are reading your Bible whether you are listening to a tape whether you are following the service online we are taught to have that reverence respect for the Word of God if you can have it when you are personal when when you are by yourself then I mean all that we're doing we are just we are just doing I 7 when we come to church but what I'm trying to say this morning look at what hobbico said in Habakkuk 2:20 a famous scripture the Lord is in his holy temple let the F keep selling that's what he said chapter 2 verse 20 but the Lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him compare they're too efficient 221 Oh without that the animators going to fight us he thinks now he having the opportunity because we are not gather together so he can be able to throw things he makes the children cry he create all sorts of this distraction in the home but we have to know what we ikata we have to know we have to be disciplined to what we a call to we have to fight to be able to keep their presence efficient chapter 2 verse 21 Paul year also speaking he says if I would just find the right place and start looking somewhere else okay he says in whom all the building fitly framed together growing on to an holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also built together for an habitation of God through the spirit so this temple of God that he's talking about is Ned the church building this temple is the body for the Lord is in his holy temple Jesus also he grabbed the Pharisees on the same thing he said destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up first attorney what he was talking about the temple that was built Issa said Oh will you be able to destroy this temple no you can you can do it you know this temple it took 14 in summer years for them to build it you can but remember now remember at the death of Jesus clarifies and his men they went to so the Roman governor they said this man said when he was alive yet he will he will die and in three days he will raise again at first they thought he was talking about a natural temple but he caught it because the knew that is written in a word that a law that you suddenly seek will come in his temple so it's not the building Church all is not for the building church other should be the other and approach and respect a reference that a believer we have to watch the Word of God whether he's in church whether he's in his car whether he's at home he must be able to have that spirit of reverence that spirit of respect that spirit of quietness you can tell me that you listening to the Word of God playing on one side and you haven't allowed music going on the other side that is more louder than the word now let me let me let me also bring you to a place where I think is important like we say where I think the rubber meets the road let's go to Daniel chapter 9 children of the light let's walk in the light God has given us something that we can be proud of to come to reference and respect and and see God coming down in our midst and see God answering our prayers and see God manifesting himself we can we can behave you know disrespectful to the presence of God and expect God to come in bring his holiness into our disorder God is a God of order Daniel chapter 9 children of the light like a brush cat encouragers let's get out there let's get out you know and and and and show to the devil that we not children of darkness he can hold us in in doubt he can hold us in this order he can hold us in weakness we can get out there praise the Lord look at this together Daniel chapter 9 verse 24 this speaks of the 70 week but there is a portion in year that I want to get your attention on because I think it also speaks of the bride seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city now all of the things that will happen in a 70 week the first thing to finish the transgression the second thing to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for their iniquity now remember just like brother Branham said God could not bring judgment on Egypt on the world at that time until the iniquity of the amorite was for now so the beginning of the 70 week a portion of the 70 Widow that who first happened was to finish the transgression it was a period of darkness where Israel would go through without a prophet without a messiah and we get to the place where when the Messiah come they will reject him they had to get to that peak before the Messiah come and when he come he will be he will be the one that will make an end of sin and he will make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring an everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy now this is what I want to grab your attention now the last part of this 70 week to anoint the most holy which bar random says it is the Millennial temple he says annoyed the most-holy for what the millennial temple and what is the Millennial temple the bride is the male in your temple because we would not have a temple like the Temple of Solomon where we will go in to wash it the lamb would be the city the lamb would be the light of the city it will be our our worship to him it will be our reference to him and it will be our submissiveness to him the lamb the bride is their Millennial temple where the Lord comes down and dwara maan his people just like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden God comes in the cool of the evening there was no Tabernacle there for Adam and Eve to go and wash it but when that presence of God comes down Adam knew how to bring the presence of God he knew the time that God met him so at that time his reverence at that time he's ready to hear from God at that time he's ready to submit himself to get instruction from God if we don't learn it now we will not have it there that's what rush order is given to us that's what church order is given to us Revelation chapter 8 the Bible says when the seven seals were open they were silent for an half hour amen now see this now brother Branham would turn everything all the supernatural things that happen in his ministry and most of the supernatural things just around the seals he would tell all of those things to have an hour but then he give us this principle half an hour before the service starts solids have an hour before the service that salads the same order of the seven seals we come in his present with silent worship prayer getting in connection with God trying to relax our mind trying to heal ourself up you know what and in all of those things just before we go right into the service why why he give us those things why he taught it to us and yeah he's saying in unveiling of God tying it to the opening of the seals to get us ready it's God with the individual is the heart of the individual with God that is the reason why when the person has that discipline of reverence and respect to God you can go anywhere around the world no church order would be difficult for you to submit oh there are some places you will even go I mean you would be so trouble because you have so much submissiveness and reverence in your spirit and you just see the people in this order the church order was to prepare the individual was to prepare you as a temple was to prepare you as a place of worship I said bear with me now I want for every one of us to study this together because I realized that it's important for us it's important for us because if God don't deal with us while we are away from one another when we come back together we will have a lot of work to do we have so much work to do so I read that again and then I would then move into into my into my subject don't worry I'm already out of notes oh praise the Lord the hour of the seven injured message all the ministries of God should be made known in that Elijah in in this last name how that Christ is pulled out of the church how he's revealed as a son of man again how dead the church is to be put in order and everything for the last thing no Creed no denomination you see that's the reason why you know you can take one church order to another church order it's not a Creed it's not a Creed and I've been places where people one time I was in a ministers meeting and and then we were discussing is this that the brother says no brother Branham says we must pass the plate it has to be a plate and and and the thing about it dead is that in that car in that in that country the current says they are using is a note and before I mean half of the people finished putting they are offering the money in is falling off the plate so instead of the plate now we had a big ball so you see it's not a creed it's not a denomination is for the individual is a reverence for the individual if we don't get it to the individual we will just stay as a creep well in our church we don't do it like this in our church the church order is not like that you are making it agreed you are making it a denomination it's for you as an individual to have reverence and respect to the Word of God reverence and respect to the Spirit of God so you see because that reverence and respect has not really been grinded in us if we have a Pentecostal person in church and they speak in tongues everybody go WOW oh why because we don't have it in black and white and our minds go no there must be interpretation of tone it doesn't and we and we just we just throw everything out of order but you see when that reverence and respect is there when the person comes they don't know what we believe but if I mean the fall in the spirit and speaking tongue we all go to praying God set us an interpreter because we are on the expectation we are referencing the Spirit of God we're not being critical we are not condemning we just want God to move in our miss he says the church order is for the individual no Creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual that's what it's for it's not for the building is for you to carry to in your home it's for you to apply it at work is for you to apply it anywhere is okay for example why if I'm praying I work I'm just maybe having a little time of praying and and and and maybe my boss speaks to me or my coworker speaks to me you know and then and and it's just to tell them oh sorry I would just pray you know just doing that not being intimidated or not being afraid just doing that it's easy to bring God close the restaurant can be noisy and we sit down as a family or sit down as believers and say let's pray and just draw ourself together just by doing that verbatim talks about a story at one time where he was in a restaurant and you know with with his kitchen he says and right across the table there there was a man that was just using vocal language you know bird Brent said Arabella Paul talks about that you know and I mean he was just swearing all over the place and he was just swearing and I mean sometimes you want to bear it but sometimes you just can't be hey because it just gets so nasty but right after they have prayed he just walked over to that man didn't fuss with him he just let me talk to him it's the thing that brings the presence of God close to the believer is the reverence and a respect that we have for God you see that's the reason why Paul warned against I service because if you don't have reverence and respect in your heart for God it's easier for you to lead to I service it's easier for you to be doing things just to please people that I around you but it's not really in you he says just absolutely the word living in the individual there is no strain there is no denomination there is no bounding nothing he says is the heart with God him alone you're half with God sitting in your home is your heart with God in you alone sitting in the church is your heart with God in him alone over and over he let us know that we all can be sitting here and God can reveal to one person and you were not revealed to the rest of them he said God can come down and and and just deal with this one person blessed him and and he would not do it and over and over in the in the prayer line brother Brennan will call people out and since you men right there no not you is the letter sitting there right before you because were the Holy Spirit pull him to that direction he thought it was the man but then the Holy Spirit goes over he says because you have a we're coming spirit words that were coming spirit reverence reverence attentiveness you are awake because you ready to catch it you ready to get a hold of what God is doing children of the light this is the light that we must be walking in this is the light because his light was the life of men that's what John says praise the Lord his light was the life of men I would take something here again peace of the trumpet 1964 well Bram talks a story here [Music] he talks a little story he says we are invited to be the children of the light that we walk in the light he says I remember down in Kent Turkey year not long ago I had a meeting out after I came out of the church there was an old man standing with a lantern in his hands he belonged to a church that don't believe in healing so forth he said I different with you brother Branham I said well you got a right to do that he said you see I will not accept anything less I see it I have got to see it right playing I said then that you ever see God right playing standing before you because he didn't believe in visions and things he said no well I said then you are not a believer sir I couldn't talk to you we see what God promised and hope to death amen he said how how do you figure them I said he's come go home with me and talk tonight I said I can like talk where you live he said I go over this mountain here I said how how are you going to get there you don't see your home your house he said well there's a path runs up over the hill I said you don't see the path he said well I got a lantern I said the lantern won't show the light right to the house all know but the path will lead to the house but that lantern will only show light for one step at a time we will walk in the light the beautiful light won't step at a time Lord coming closer to him then he says this yet children of the light accept his word keep walking and watching more unfold because you see the more you walk in light the brighter the path becomes it just like that little body that is down in your soul the more you yield to the word you saw run out to the world the more the light brightens in your heart the more we become stuck to our ways and stuck to our idea you are just creating more darkness now you see because darkness can I get rid of light the light is stayed down there but you are denying yourself the privilege of walking in joy and peace acceptable right children of light except his word walk keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what anybody essays no matter what even the devil says don't leave it if you believe that God has revealed light to your heart if you believe that this word of God is true this message of the hour is truth hold to eight no matter how trouble no matter how difficult it is keep holding to eight say Lord even if it is just one step I will be able to make at a time I will keep holding to this light the old man was going across the mountain he couldn't use that Lantern to see his house but as he got on the path he kept the light before him like David said your word your word have I kept before before me a man don't even no matter what anybody says still right with that and just keep walking with it wash it on form and reveal itself the word is a seed a seed in the right kind of a ground with bring foot of it kind a men and we bring food it kind walk in the light and let's see more on fall then he says up here again in the universe a message piece of the trumpet we are living in the age that his coming will be she must be identified with him who is this she the bride a woman must be identified with her husband for the two a one and Christ bride has to be identified with him for the two I want and he is the word not a denomination he's the word the Word of God we are the children of the light and the light is the word which is male light for this age amen the light is is a word which is male life for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word alright the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it the word made flesh is the light of the age remember like I said Wednesday night the flesh will never be made word amen but the word will be made flesh the word will come when we believe that word when we accept that word the world would be quicken in our body and the world would be made flesh in us it would give us overcoming power in certain situation and and and we might go through difficult and again it looks like oh I lost my victory but when you keep believing the word the world will be made flesh again in you praise the Lord you know many times it's almost like people think the word being made flesh on the other word is flesh Amin means that you will not be tempted again means that you will just overcome Jesus was the Word made flesh but yet in his last hour he was tempted and say father not my will but let your will be done the word be made flesh is you submitting to the word and were quickening your body for you to be able to overcome a Trier for you to be able to trust God for you to be able to hold to God's Word it will anoint you in a certain situation because as believers we are living a dual life we got to go to work we got to go into the word we meet people and sometimes we see the things that we must not seed we hear the things that we must not hear we say the things that we must not say amen but then we come back to the word and we heal ourselves and we confess our sin and we surround ourselves then a word come again and pick up that flesh in the situation and say this is my try the word made flesh in the time of our Trier the word made flesh in a time of your sickness and you become heal the word made flesh because it's the Word of God praise the Lord something where Bram says here I would not forgive myself if I don't read it amen great seven more since 1955 see the way he said it here he says oh I'm so glad today that he is our goal between hey praise the Lord you can just imagine how my money was when I read it hallelujah praise the Lord oh my goodness amen 3:00 a.m. was looking just like 10:00 a.m. when I read this I'm telling you praise the Lord I'm so glad today there he is I will go between in sickness in between life death and life he's my go-between he's the one that takes death in one him in life in the other one he is the link that connects men to God they go between and he came down as a go-between and he made light on this side for Israel to mash on and darkness to whole feral back praise the Lord they were running but they were not going anywhere and can you see it with this word today with all his advancement or its technology the Nagori in the world over 19 has stopped every one of us right here they are running by the UH Nagori anyway but when God is moving he's going with such a speed that is hard for the human mind to catch up because he knows the end from the beginning when he's moving this light move with such a speed it's able to run through your body and you would not even know where your tempo in when this light go through your body you you look for your tempo you can find it at the time what you really supposed to get angry you don't know where your temper went because that light has gone through your body amen it goes through your body you and I even know where loss has gone to amen he's the go-between he may light on one side for Israel to march on and darkness to halt Pharaoh back that same angel of God is in the church tonight that same angel of light is in the church tonight he's here with us today giving light for the church to walk on amen let's walk in the light as he is in the light we are children of light praise the Lord that's what their little button he deposit that in your soul to brighten you from the inside every time you feed on the word it's almost like you're taking a imagine and you're just lighting that candle up again every time you feed on the word like brother Branham talks about the mechanic and the dynamics he said we have the mechanics we have great church we have good musicians we have good nice people but what the church needs is the little spark of the dynamic you can have the newest card 2021 vehicle brand-new perfect if you don't get that gasoline in Amen for that engine to spark it would just be I mean it would just be useless here it would just be a good furniture to keep before your house it's not going to carry you anywhere that's the place where we are that same angel of God he says it's you to give us light for the church to walk in praise alone to give us light for the church to walk in just like that old man keeping our light before us trust in God one step at a time we must now be diving into the future we must not be crossing bridges before we get there use the light of God and follow the Lord sons of God Aleya by the Spirit of God praise the Lord having six minutes year to twelve teddy and there's a little portion of my notes yet I want to get into but I can do it in six minutes praise the Lord I will not be able to do it in six minutes so I would just go to first John chapter one and then close there I would just go to first John chapter one and closed here sometimes that's where the believer struggle we are trying to use our you know our human mind and be able just to be able to I mean reason and understand everything that is happening as long as you believe that God is dealing with your heart hole to death it meant a lot of things that were happening in his life that will make you discouraged but just home to that feeling that you feel in your heart that God is with you just hold to that he promised that he will never leave you he would never forsake you think about those women dying with their children they were fed to the Lions they saw for all of those things for his namesake if God has now put his love on you it's because he for his love on you that's the reason why he's dealing with your heart in the midst of everything you still know that you know he's God you can still trust him amen first John chapter 1 I was just close with this this morning talking about light here we read this in our in our youth meeting this thing is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all praise the Lord if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ his son cleanse us from all sin in adoption message where Branham say is a constant that to me he says when God wrapped adenine Eve in that sheepskin he gave them a constantly to mean every time they were walking the blood was dropping every step they were taking the blood was dropping from the sheepskin as they were going away from his presence he wrapped them in constantly to me and that's the same thing that has been given to us as we walk in the light we are wrapped in the light what is the light the Word of God have been revealed for our day the message of the hour we wrap ourselves that's what we go for comfort that's where we go for strength that's why we go for rapture in faith to build our faith that's why we listening to the Prophet voice you listen to those testimony and you listening to the different things that I mean the Holy Spirit brought truth our ministry I mean a quickie is the word in you it gives you strength and as you listen to the word constantly what are you doing you are wrapping yourself in the in the lambda is provided for this age you are wrapping yourself in that bleedin skin and every time the walk where Bansi thats came flapping sticking to their body going back and sleeping sticking to their body going back and adam stay in that skin and that skin some of the blog also dried on him went through the parts of his body remember that is an animal life it can come on a believer but what you am i said has been given it's a very life of God when we wrap ourselves in it it flows through our vein it flows through our veins influence our life it's a life that can come back on us a life that can come and dominate our life lead us in the paths of righteousness let's walk in the light if there is just only one scripture that makes you happy keep reading that scripture every day to get happy it doesn't 101 that makes you happy go back to it because it will make you happy if there is a promise that brightens your mind every time you think about it goes back to that promise you know why I brighten your mind is because God has quick in that word he has make it so real to you that every time you think about it it puts smile on your face he has quickened I promise for you so don't go into the mid don't go and start struggling about what the 7cu says and what go back to that thing that brings you joy go back to that thing if there is something that you remember in your walk with God that rejoice your heart go back to that thing if it don't rejoice you anymore they ask the Lord to give you a fresh new wine it may give you a fresh new spirits but if it brings joy to you you go back to it because why God has used there he has quickened that thing to you that is the reason where every time you think about it you feel grateful to God you feel proud to be a child of God praise the Lord hello bless you this afternoon we walk in the light beautiful light amen
