[52:10] um there was a music we sang on
[52:14] Wednesday night I have heard that music
[52:18] over and
[52:19] over but on Wednesday night it came to
[52:24] me very much in a different way it
[52:29] pierced through my
[52:31] soul and it's just been on my heart all
[52:36] through and Wednesday Wednesday night I
[52:39] enjoyed the service so
[52:41] much so much
[52:43] so that on our way
[52:46] home before then on Monday when I was
[52:51] going to work I left home very early in
[52:55] the morning
[52:57] and at about 4
[53:00] probably 420 4:30 I was on the highway
[53:05] and getting
[53:08] to
[53:09] Dayton I
[53:12] saw a police light initially I didn't
[53:14] know it was the police car before then I
[53:17] had seen two cars trucks already putting
[53:21] salt on the road because it was very
[53:24] slippery so when I saw the third
[53:28] light a part of me said it was another
[53:31] salt
[53:32] truck and as I got closer I realized no
[53:36] it wasn't a salt truck but it was a
[53:38] police car that had pulled over a semi
[53:41] the semi was close to the wall and the
[53:44] the the police car was right in the in
[53:47] the lane and I was coming so I hit my
[53:51] break but I was very careful because it
[53:54] was very slippery I didn't want want to
[53:56] run into the police car and in the
[53:59] Middle Lane there were two cars trucks
[54:02] that were coming and they wouldn't
[54:03] change their
[54:05] lanes and I was surprised I signaled and
[54:08] they saw the danger
[54:10] ahead but they wouldn't change their
[54:12] lenses so I was coming I got so close to
[54:15] the police car I didn't want to hit it
[54:19] now it was just about probably 60 50 m
[54:22] per
[54:23] hour so now I was alone there was nobody
[54:27] in the passenger seat I wanted to avoid
[54:29] the police car so when the first truck
[54:32] passed I don't know how I managed to
[54:36] avoid the police car and then got in
[54:39] between the two cars I have no idea what
[54:42] happened but then as soon as I passed I
[54:45] heard
[54:47] boom I said what happened in the
[54:51] truck I didn't know what went on so I
[54:54] went to work then my manager came
[54:57] because he also lives in St Michael then
[55:00] he said Dan how was the commute I said
[55:02] it was good it was just so slippery and
[55:06] traffic was slow and he said it took me
[55:09] 1 hour 45 minutes to drive in I said
[55:12] what he said yeah there is an accident I
[55:16] said accident he said yes I dated I said
[55:19] oh I heard the sound but I didn't see
[55:23] it I said I was going to be in the news
[55:27] he said a car just ran into a police
[55:29] car I said oh that was the police car I
[55:33] avoided so it looked like the car behind
[55:36] me just ran into it and then he said
[55:39] something he said there was somebody
[55:42] watching over you praise the
[55:45] Lord
[55:48] now you know it is something when a
[55:52] brother or a sister is telling you
[55:54] something like this but then is
[55:56] something completely different when it
[55:59] is coming from an unexpected Source I
[56:02] didn't expect it then I just said amen
[56:06] praise the Lord
[56:09] now on Wednesday as I said I enjoyed
[56:13] that song we didn't sing it all through
[56:15] and it's been on my heart so much but
[56:18] the one took over the pulpit and it was
[56:19] a wonderful time of
[56:21] fellowship and I went and Dr my wife
[56:24] with the boys on our way on the highway
[56:28] we just went all through as soon as I
[56:31] left the highway and I was taking the
[56:33] ramp to 240
[56:36] 241 then I heard my tire
[56:39] flapping then I said woof I have a flat
[56:43] ti so I put my hazard light on and I
[56:47] drove right to the gas station and I
[56:50] packed there now all along I knew that
[56:55] my right rear tire was low on air so
[56:59] when that happened my guess was oh it
[57:03] was the real tire so I pked the car I
[57:06] told the boys I called my wife I said
[57:09] get us an
[57:10] Uber praise the Lord at least the first
[57:13] time I got to enjoy Uber I didn't know
[57:15] how it
[57:17] felt so she got us Uber I went in I told
[57:21] the guys I said oh can I leave my truck
[57:23] here I have a problem I said no that is
[57:24] no problem so I went home the following
[57:27] day I called in I told my boss I had a
[57:29] problem with my tire I'm not coming in
[57:31] so brother one arranged for a AAA car to
[57:35] come so I went there I looked behind the
[57:38] car the ti was okay I said so what
[57:41] happened yesterday then I went on the
[57:43] other side and I saw that the tire the
[57:47] front the passenger side the front tire
[57:49] the tire was off the
[57:54] rim I said oh so this was what
[57:58] happened I have never seen that
[58:02] before I said wow so then I just started
[58:06] you know making fun with myself I said
[58:08] wow it looked like when I was on the
[58:11] highway the devil got so crazy or so mad
[58:15] with the service that on my way he just
[58:19] came and he wanted to push me into the G
[58:23] and God said no you can't do it here
[58:26] of because I was asking myself at 80 M
[58:29] hour if this should happen what is going
[58:31] to be the
[58:34] result and I hear God say no wait until
[58:37] it is 30 m hour then you can do
[58:40] it and wait also till he he has a place
[58:43] to
[58:45] packk and I know the devil was very
[58:48] mad and I just got there I was so blown
[58:53] away and you know
[58:57] then what my manager
[58:59] said it was just a
[59:02] reminder that there is
[59:06] somebody watching over you and
[59:10] me if God should open our eyes to see
[59:14] the things that go on around
[59:17] us we will be forever
[59:20] grateful sometimes we complain about
[59:22] unnecessary
[59:24] things we comp complain about worldly
[59:28] things we look at the people in the
[59:29] world and the things they are enjoying
[59:31] and we look at ourselves and we look
[59:34] mean on
[59:36] ourselves and they are
[59:40] nothing it's just it it just reminds me
[59:43] of the two fishes that went to
[59:46] God to pray and one fish
[59:49] said open my eyes I want to see all my
[59:54] enemies so I can deal with with them
[59:56] boot to boot an eye for an eye a tooth
[59:59] for a
[1:00:00] tooth God said good you got it and the
[1:00:04] the other fish came and said for me I
[1:00:08] don't want to know who my enemies
[1:00:12] are the ble is the Lord's
[1:00:15] ble it is not
[1:00:17] mine
[1:00:19] vengeance is unto the
[1:00:21] Lord just keep me away from my enemies
[1:00:25] just guide me
[1:00:26] just protect me just deliver me be my
[1:00:30] shield and God said you got it the fish
[1:00:34] that said open my eyes to see my
[1:00:37] enemies that fish died in seven days why
[1:00:41] because when it went he saw a hook
[1:00:45] waiting for it and then when it ran away
[1:00:47] he saw the Fisherman's Net waiting for
[1:00:50] it it ran away when he went it way he
[1:00:53] saw a shark coming it ran away it it was
[1:00:56] running away from one danger to the
[1:00:57] other till it had no time to eat and it
[1:01:05] died but the fish that said just guide
[1:01:08] me protect me deliver me I'm in your
[1:01:12] hands let your will be done praise be to
[1:01:15] God that fish will just swim swim swim
[1:01:18] and then see a hook it doesn't even know
[1:01:21] it is a hook and then there is a bait on
[1:01:24] it it comes it picks the bit oh so there
[1:01:27] was a hook here praise the
[1:01:30] Lord and then it
[1:01:32] goes and then it gets somewhere and then
[1:01:35] it real it is trapped oh what is this it
[1:01:39] looks like a net it will shake itself
[1:01:41] and then off it's gone oh praise the
[1:01:43] Lord and it will swim and swim and swim
[1:01:46] and swim and it doesn't even know it has
[1:01:48] entered the shar's mouth and it is
[1:01:52] there it is food but the Shar cannot
[1:01:55] digest it
[1:01:56] praise the Lord and then it just comes
[1:01:59] swims out he said oh so for all this
[1:02:03] time I was in the mouth of the shark oh
[1:02:06] praise the
[1:02:08] Lord you
[1:02:10] know we we oh my goodness the Lord is so
[1:02:15] faithful the Lord our God is so

[1:02:29] nothing that can go on wrong with your
[1:02:31] life if something wrong

[1:02:42] the times we don't pray until there is
[1:02:47] danger it's sad it doesn't have to be so

[1:03:05] the bed and just have that time with
[1:03:08] God praise the Lord but we wait till
[1:03:12] there is danger We Wait Till There is
[1:03:14] sickness we wait till things go wrong
[1:03:17] that is why we begin to cry out to God
[1:03:19] and guess what if that is what you are
[1:03:22] waiting on to have a relationship with
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:26] God will give it to
[1:03:29] you if you want to wait till there is
[1:03:32] danger before you get down with you get
[1:03:36] down to business with

[1:03:41] you and he looks in there and he sees
[1:03:45] that no you are waiting for danger
[1:03:47] before you pray he will allow
[1:03:50] it why do we have to
[1:03:53] wait till things go wrong
[1:03:56] why do we have to
[1:03:58] wait praise the
[1:04:00] Lord have that relationship with
[1:04:06] God by the grace of
[1:04:08] God this
[1:04:11] morning we are going to talk about
[1:04:15] something praise the Lord before then
[1:04:18] shall we just stand for Theon of the
[1:04:20] world
[1:04:36] I'm reading from
[1:04:39] Romans Romans
[1:04:45] 835 Romans
[1:04:48] 8 Romans 83
[1:05:14] okay Romans 8:35 I
[1:05:19] read who shall separate us from the love
[1:05:22] of
[1:05:23] Christ shall tribulation
[1:05:26] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:05:31] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[1:05:35] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:05:40] day long we are counted as sheep for the
[1:05:43] slaughter nay in all this we are more
[1:05:48] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:05:51] us for I am
[1:05:53] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:05:57] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:06:01] nor things present nor things to come
[1:06:04] nor height nor dep nor any other
[1:06:08] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:06:11] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:06:14] Jesus our lord may the Lord add his
[1:06:18] Blessing to the reading of his word
[1:06:20] shall we be
[1:06:21] seated praise the Lord as we have read
[1:06:27] nothing nothing can take us away from
[1:06:31] the love of
[1:06:32] God no famine no hunger no danger no
[1:06:38] joblessness no
[1:06:40] sickness nothing can take us away from
[1:06:43] the love of
[1:06:45] God God has instilled his love in our
[1:06:51] house when God puts just a little bit of
[1:06:55] his love in you to love
[1:07:00] him it doesn't matter what you go
[1:07:03] through it doesn't matter what you go
[1:07:07] through when you have that burning
[1:07:10] desire in you to serve God there isn't
[1:07:13] enough of this world there isn't enough
[1:07:18] that this world can offer
[1:07:20] you because all your heart desire is
[1:07:24] just to please the Lord
[1:07:26] all your heart desire is just to serve
[1:07:28] God the best you
[1:07:30] know nothing else matters yes you work
[1:07:35] you go to school you make the money you
[1:07:37] do businesses whatever God put whatever
[1:07:40] you want to do you will do
[1:07:42] it but there is one
[1:07:44] thing there is one thing that brings you
[1:07:50] Joy you would realize it doesn't matter
[1:07:53] how much you are blessed in the of this
[1:07:56] life it doesn't give you Joy it just
[1:07:59] gives you that temporary
[1:08:01] relief it doesn't bring you Joy the only
[1:08:05] thing that satisfy your soul is nothing
[1:08:07] but the
[1:08:10] word and if there is something that
[1:08:13] satisfies your soul other than your the
[1:08:16] word of
[1:08:18] God you need to
[1:08:21] pray if there is something else in this
[1:08:25] life
[1:08:26] that can give you Joy in your soul other
[1:08:29] than the word of
[1:08:31] God you are in for
[1:08:34] trouble praise the
[1:08:39] Lord it will be
[1:08:42] better to have the
[1:08:44] word and lose
[1:08:47] everything leave a proper all your
[1:08:50] life nobody has to know
[1:08:53] you but you have a place with God
[1:08:58] tomorrow by the grace of God today we
[1:09:00] are going to talk about stumbling I
[1:09:04] know stumbling I know it sounds weird
[1:09:09] right praise the Lord one day at
[1:09:15] work I was going to set up some
[1:09:18] equipment for a r the following
[1:09:22] day now this area I have a radio station
[1:09:25] it's not mine but I have set it to
[1:09:31] 60 what is it
[1:09:33] again can you tell me the radio
[1:09:37] station 96.3 that's correct God bless
[1:09:41] you so I have studed to
[1:09:44] 96.3 from that time I found that radio
[1:09:47] station I have not gone back to KT as a
[1:09:51] matter of fact I don't even know whether
[1:09:52] they still
[1:09:54] exist and
[1:09:56] I went in there and there was this music
[1:09:59] playing I don't know the title of the
[1:10:02] song but there was just a line that said
[1:10:06] stumbling I know but I'm
[1:10:10] coming and when I heard that
[1:10:13] song something just took my heart that I
[1:10:17] went and I sat down and I listened to
[1:10:20] the song in less than two minutes the
[1:10:22] song was over and I just I was just so
[1:10:26] grafted to my seat I sat there for a
[1:10:29] while probably for 30
[1:10:32] minutes just I just didn't know what I
[1:10:35] was
[1:10:36] doing but it blessed my soul so
[1:10:40] much and how I wished that it was a
[1:10:43] cassette and I press reply rly reply
[1:10:48] till my soul couldn't take it
[1:10:51] anymore and then this morning
[1:10:56] we are going to talk about stumbling I
[1:11:01] know now stumbling I
[1:11:05] know looks very much like a present
[1:11:09] condition a present condition I am
[1:11:12] stumbling I
[1:11:15] know for some of us
[1:11:19] yes stumbling I know for some of us also
[1:11:24] maybe it is not going to be stumbling I
[1:11:26] know but it could be stumbled I know
[1:11:32] where the devil is seeking to carry to
[1:11:34] your past and pin you
[1:11:37] down under the weight of your sins and
[1:11:41] your iniquities in the
[1:11:43] past but whether it is stumbling I know
[1:11:47] or stumbled I know it makes no
[1:11:51] difference praise the Lord not stumbling
[1:11:54] I think
[1:11:56] not stumbling I feel not stumbling my
[1:12:00] pastor says not stumbling my husband
[1:12:02] says not stumbling my wife says not
[1:12:05] stumbling my brother or my sister says
[1:12:08] but stumbling I
[1:12:10] know there is no uncertainty about
[1:12:15] it when you look at yourself in the
[1:12:18] mirror of God's
[1:12:20] word don't sugarcoat
[1:12:23] sin call out what you see by
[1:12:27] name if it is a spade it's a spade not a
[1:12:31] big spoon with a wooden handle praise
[1:12:34] the Lord Call It by
[1:12:37] name when you are dealing with God you
[1:12:39] know that God sees you I mean deep down
[1:12:43] there he knows you more than you know
[1:12:45] yourself so what are you hiding from
[1:12:48] God when a man begins to hide something
[1:12:51] from God it shows that they don't even
[1:12:53] know the God your servant
[1:12:57] as I said one time ago it's like playing
[1:13:00] with a child and they run under a
[1:13:03] blanket you are looking at them running
[1:13:05] under the blanket and then they go under
[1:13:08] it and their legs are outside and they
[1:13:10] say they are
[1:13:12] hiding that is what we do sometimes when
[1:13:14] we come in the presence of
[1:13:16] God let it
[1:13:18] out let it out it shows that you are
[1:13:23] ready you you show that you are ready
[1:13:27] but when you begin to sugarcoat
[1:13:30] things begin to use
[1:13:34] grammar trying to redefine
[1:13:37] things it shows you are not ready
[1:13:41] yet and if you are not ready yet in the
[1:13:45] day and time we are living in when again
[1:13:48] are you going to get
[1:13:53] ready we are closer to today than we
[1:13:56] were
[1:13:58] yesterday and by the time we leave
[1:14:01] service today we will be closer then
[1:14:05] than we were coming
[1:14:07] in if there was any time to mean
[1:14:10] business with God it is
[1:14:14] now if you can't mean business with God
[1:14:18] now
[1:14:20] when when
[1:14:26] time is no
[1:14:29] more if anybody tells you there is
[1:14:32] time and enjoy
[1:14:36] yourself there is time take it easy till
[1:14:40] you grow there is
[1:14:44] time you are young there is
[1:14:48] time there is no
[1:14:51] time don't let anybody deceive you
[1:14:56] today could be the last
[1:15:00] day today could be the last
[1:15:03] day nobody knows
[1:15:06] it it's in the hands of
[1:15:11] God make your calling and election
[1:15:16] sure don't settle for
[1:15:19] anything nothing but the
[1:15:22] word let the word be your
[1:15:25] anchor praise be to God that was the
[1:15:29] song The Anchor Holds yes that was a
[1:15:33] song Let the word be your
[1:15:36] anchor let the word be your strength let
[1:15:40] the word be your absolute let the word
[1:15:43] be everything to
[1:15:45] you don't settle for anything
[1:15:49] less what is it that we have
[1:15:53] seen that has come
[1:15:55] to stay
[1:15:57] forever Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:15:59] the only thing that would not pass away
[1:16:02] is the
[1:16:03] word and when this word is in you you
[1:16:06] are
[1:16:08] blessed you are blessed praise be to
[1:16:12] God as I said we are going to talk
[1:16:17] about stumbling I
[1:16:20] know for you it could be stumbled I know
[1:16:26] but I'm coming stumbling I
[1:16:29] know praise the
[1:16:33] Lord when a man gets to a point or when
[1:16:37] a woman gets to a
[1:16:40] point that the devil cannot convince
[1:16:42] them to do
[1:16:46] anything sometimes we baffle the
[1:16:50] devil the devil looks at us and he
[1:16:53] doesn't understand the sort of who he's
[1:16:55] dealing
[1:16:57] with because the devil tells you that
[1:17:01] God does not love
[1:17:02] you and you say even if he does not love
[1:17:05] me I am coming
[1:17:07] anyhow that you are not a child of God
[1:17:10] because he did that that that that he
[1:17:12] will list everything he said praise be
[1:17:14] to God stumbled I know but I'm coming
[1:17:18] anyhow the devil will tell you that this
[1:17:22] sin is so huge God cannot forgive this
[1:17:25] sin there is no sin that God cannot
[1:17:29] forgive there is no sin that is too big
[1:17:33] that God cannot
[1:17:34] forgive if you decide to hold on to
[1:17:39] it and you tell yourself that this is
[1:17:42] too big God cannot forgive
[1:17:45] yes you are going to hold to it and it's
[1:17:48] going to be big to you and God will not
[1:17:51] forgive that sin why because you have
[1:17:53] limited the power of the
[1:17:59] blood and it is a
[1:18:01] sin to limit
[1:18:04] God it is a sin to limit God for you a
[1:18:09] man to tell yourself what God can do and
[1:18:12] what God cannot
[1:18:14] do just take God at his
[1:18:18] word it may not mean anything to you you
[1:18:21] may not understand it you don't have to
[1:18:23] understand everything no
[1:18:27] you can write on one single
[1:18:29] scripture to
[1:18:31] Heaven you don't have to know from the
[1:18:34] one cover to the other from the from you
[1:18:36] don't have to know everything you don't
[1:18:38] have to also understand everything that
[1:18:40] is why we serve God by
[1:18:43] faith stumbling I
[1:18:47] know in
[1:18:51] 2016 in the Olympic Games in Rio
[1:18:57] Deo there was an American by name Abby
[1:19:04] abitino and there was also somebody from
[1:19:08] New
[1:19:09] Zealand Nikki
[1:19:13] hbling there was a 5,000 m
[1:19:18] race and
[1:19:19] then they started the race and halfway
[1:19:23] the race
[1:19:27] Nikki fell
[1:19:29] down and iy just came stumbled over her
[1:19:33] and also
[1:19:35] fell all the other r that came just
[1:19:38] skipped over
[1:19:40] them just jumped over them and off they
[1:19:45] went but
[1:19:47] when I be got up on her
[1:19:51] feet initially did she didn't know how
[1:19:55] much she was
[1:19:56] hurt she went to the rescue of Nikki and
[1:20:01] lifted her
[1:20:02] up and then let's go and as they started
[1:20:07] to run she saw that she
[1:20:09] couldn't she stood on her feet she tried
[1:20:13] to balance herself and then she fell
[1:20:15] right back to the
[1:20:17] ground and hbling lifted her up first it
[1:20:21] was Niki who lifted her up this time
[1:20:24] hbling is lifting her up praise the Lord
[1:20:28] and I could just
[1:20:30] see the new the the New Zealander
[1:20:33] telling the American girl you know
[1:20:37] um I can't go any further I am so hurt
[1:20:42] and actually she was so
[1:20:44] hurt she had a t ACL and a t
[1:20:49] Minar and we are talking of h a 5,000 m
[1:20:53] race that was just halfway
[1:20:57] through a very good place to have given
[1:20:59] an
[1:21:01] excuse just lie down and they'll come
[1:21:04] with a stretcher and come and take you
[1:21:06] off the field and carry to the
[1:21:09] hospital but that was not enough she
[1:21:12] started running just hopping on her feet
[1:21:16] just
[1:21:17] limping they
[1:21:19] stumbling
[1:21:21] stumbling stumbling I know but here I
[1:21:24] come
[1:21:25] just tumbling and she run all the rest
[1:21:28] of the race with so much pain you could
[1:21:31] see it in her face nashing her
[1:21:34] teeth and everybody just left them they
[1:21:39] were the two people that came in
[1:21:43] last and there you would
[1:21:47] realize
[1:21:49] that every race is not just about
[1:21:52] winning it's not about being coming
[1:21:55] first it's not about being the
[1:21:58] best because all eyes were on the two of
[1:22:02] them that were coming in
[1:22:04] last it is contrary to the game a lot of
[1:22:08] the times people are looking at the
[1:22:10] people ahead the first second and third
[1:22:12] positions and they are applauding you
[1:22:15] but this time the people gave them a
[1:22:17] standing ovation and they were standing
[1:22:20] applauding them why because the two of
[1:22:23] them were so h and yet they wouldn't
[1:22:25] give up they were just
[1:22:28] coming it was not about their
[1:22:31] person because they realized that they
[1:22:34] were representing their different
[1:22:36] countries they realized that they were
[1:22:39] they had the flag of their countries
[1:22:41] before them and that the race was bigger
[1:22:44] than them and they gave him all their
[1:22:48] best and when they
[1:22:51] finished oh they just came and they hug
[1:22:54] each
[1:22:56] other with the tears running
[1:23:01] down
[1:23:03] later the international Olympic
[1:23:06] Committee awarded them one of the
[1:23:09] highest
[1:23:11] award that they would ever give and that
[1:23:14] was the pure
[1:23:16] the pure
[1:23:22] the one of the awards a very very high
[1:23:25] award they awarded two of them which
[1:23:29] they really do p detin yes P detin award
[1:23:33] was given to
[1:23:35] them and those that went ahead of
[1:23:39] them more than half of them never got
[1:23:42] any award they never got any
[1:23:45] recognition and that show of
[1:23:48] sportsmanship was D as the greatest
[1:23:53] moment in that sporting
[1:23:57] history display of
[1:24:02] sportsmanship display of
[1:24:07] sportsmanship now I want us to
[1:24:12] realize that a race has been set before
[1:24:16] you and
[1:24:18] me we are also running a race
[1:24:27] we are running a race a race has been
[1:24:29] set before
[1:24:31] us even though we are running a race we
[1:24:35] are not in a
[1:24:40] competition in every other athletic
[1:24:43] event they are in a competition I want
[1:24:46] to be first so when you fall down I will
[1:24:50] skip over
[1:24:51] you make sure I cross the finishing
[1:24:56] line but the race you and I are running
[1:25:00] we are not in a
[1:25:09] competition in this
[1:25:13] race when your brother falls down or
[1:25:17] your sister falls down you don't skip
[1:25:20] over
[1:25:21] them you don't jump over them
[1:25:24] you don't leave them
[1:25:26] behind so you can go ahead of them and
[1:25:29] be the
[1:25:30] first so you can go and cross the finish
[1:25:34] line
[1:25:36] no we are in a race where we lift one
[1:25:40] another up that when somebody's down you
[1:25:44] lift him up when somebody's down you
[1:25:47] lift her up that we are there for one
[1:25:51] another there is a race that has been
[1:25:55] said before
[1:25:57] Us Praise the Lord and I'll be taking a
[1:26:02] some few scriptures here as we go
[1:26:09] along praise the
[1:26:15] Lord I want us to read from Romans
[1:26:18] Romans 14
[1:26:25] so
[1:26:27] remember that this
[1:26:29] race is not about giving
[1:26:33] up this race is not about giving
[1:26:36] up and the good
[1:26:39] thing is that if you ever want to find
[1:26:42] an excuse why you should not serve God
[1:26:46] the devil will give you a lot a lot more
[1:26:49] than you ever
[1:26:51] expected you want an excuse
[1:26:54] why you shouldn't come to church the
[1:26:56] devil the devil give you a
[1:26:58] dozen you want an
[1:27:01] excuse why you should not be faithful
[1:27:04] the devil give you a
[1:27:05] dozen you want an excuse why you should
[1:27:09] go back to the world and do things of
[1:27:12] the world the devil will give you more
[1:27:14] than
[1:27:16] 100 but where you are
[1:27:19] determined where you are
[1:27:21] determined there is no excuse
[1:27:25] that can take you out of the will of God
[1:27:29] you will not settle for
[1:27:31] anything that is a man or a woman that
[1:27:34] is
[1:27:37] resilient praise the Lord Romans
[1:27:41] 14 24
[1:27:57] what did I
[1:27:59] say Romans 14 Romans
[1:28:06] 14 oh I got the wrong
[1:28:10] scripture okay
[1:28:14] um Paul
[1:28:18] said we then that are
[1:28:22] strong ought to bear
[1:28:24] the infirmities of the
[1:28:28] weak so that was the scripture I was
[1:28:31] looking for so um just forget of the the
[1:28:33] quotation I gave you but we
[1:28:37] then we then that are strong
[1:28:43] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[1:28:50] weak First Corinthians 9:119
[1:28:58] First
[1:29:07] Corinthians
[1:29:10] 9:19 for though I be
[1:29:17] free from all
[1:29:21] men ye have I made made myself servant
[1:29:25] unto that I might gain the
[1:29:29] more and unto the Jews I became as a Jew
[1:29:34] that I might gain the Jews to them that
[1:29:37] are under the
[1:29:43] law to them that are under the
[1:29:46] law that I might gain them that are
[1:29:50] under the law to them that are without
[1:29:54] without the law as without law being not
[1:29:59] without law to God but under the law of
[1:30:02] Christ that I might game them that are
[1:30:06] without law to the weak I became as weak
[1:30:12] that I might gain the weak I am made all
[1:30:16] things to all
[1:30:19] men excuse me that I might by all means
[1:30:24] save some praise the Lord so when you
[1:30:28] look at this
[1:30:29] scripture you
[1:30:33] see that Paul is doing everything
[1:30:39] possible everything possible he will
[1:30:42] just come down to a man's
[1:30:45] level to make sure that he's able to
[1:30:48] lift that man
[1:30:51] up with all that Paul had
[1:30:54] with everything that he
[1:30:56] knew he didn't consider
[1:30:59] himself better than anybody he didn't
[1:31:02] consider himself a special
[1:31:05] person under every circumstance he looks
[1:31:09] at the situation what can I do to be of
[1:31:12] a
[1:31:14] help to them that are without the law to
[1:31:17] them that without the law to them that
[1:31:18] are weak he would make sure that he is
[1:31:21] coming down to your level praise be to
[1:31:23] God
[1:31:29] stumbling I know Romans
[1:31:33] 78 Romans
[1:31:36] 7:18 it looks I'll be doing a lot of
[1:31:38] reading today it's probably the maybe
[1:31:40] the second to last not too much reading
[1:31:43] Romans 7
[1:31:52] 718 18 to
[1:32:04] 21
[1:32:08] okay for I know that in
[1:32:11] me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:32:17] thing for to will is present with me but
[1:32:21] how to perform that which is good I find
[1:32:26] not for the good that I would I do not
[1:32:30] but the evil which I would not that I do
[1:32:35] now if I do that I would not it is no
[1:32:40] more I that do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:32:44] in me I find then a law that when I will
[1:32:49] do good evil is present with me praise
[1:32:53] the the
[1:32:55] Lord
[1:32:57] so when you look at what Paul is saying
[1:33:01] here it's just
[1:33:03] like brother brother talking about that
[1:33:06] Indian
[1:33:07] brother that when he asked that brother
[1:33:10] how things are going the brother said
[1:33:13] pretty good and pretty
[1:33:18] bad pretty good and pretty
[1:33:21] bad and then he went on to say that
[1:33:25] there is a constant
[1:33:27] fight between the white dog and a black
[1:33:31] dog because the white dog wants me to do
[1:33:34] good but the black dog wants me to do
[1:33:37] bad
[1:33:40] evil but the one I feed the
[1:33:44] most is the
[1:33:47] one that
[1:33:50] overcomes so in me do I left no good
[1:33:53] thing
[1:33:55] Paul is saying the good that I would I
[1:33:58] do not but the evil that I would not
[1:34:03] that I
[1:34:04] do that
[1:34:06] constantly
[1:34:08] constantly you are faced with a
[1:34:12] choice either to do good or evil is
[1:34:16] before
[1:34:19] you and
[1:34:21] somehow every single single day we are
[1:34:27] stumbling every single day we are
[1:34:30] stumbling it's say oh no brother I don't
[1:34:33] stumble every
[1:34:35] day sometimes when we talk of stumbling
[1:34:38] people think of the the big big big big
[1:34:40] evil
[1:34:42] things by your
[1:34:45] thoughts by what you think the thoughts
[1:34:49] that run to your
[1:34:51] mind if you are sincere with yourself
[1:34:53] yourself you would realize that you have
[1:34:56] stumbled by the things you
[1:35:00] say before you realize you have said
[1:35:02] things you shouldn't
[1:35:05] say sometimes you go down memory
[1:35:09] lane we were not all born
[1:35:12] Christians God delivered us along the
[1:35:15] way and has made us who we are by
[1:35:18] Grace but sometimes our human nature
[1:35:23] just go down that memory lane and then
[1:35:26] you go and then you go inside the
[1:35:27] garbage can your spirit will go just
[1:35:31] looking through the garbage can looking
[1:35:32] for what God has delivered you and we
[1:35:36] bring things back to inflict ourselves
[1:35:39] to defile
[1:35:42] ourselves by our
[1:35:44] reasoning we
[1:35:48] stumble and do we say because I have
[1:35:52] stumbled let me just keep
[1:35:56] stumbling that is what the devil
[1:35:58] does if the devil can bring you to a
[1:36:01] place to do something you know is
[1:36:04] against the will of God oh the devil is
[1:36:07] good at what he
[1:36:08] does we have a good
[1:36:11] adversary even when he know he's
[1:36:14] defeated he doesn't give
[1:36:16] up when he knows that he's going to be
[1:36:18] defeated he will still
[1:36:21] come he doesn't take no for an answer
[1:36:24] he keeps trying his luck he has never
[1:36:27] stopped to try praise the
[1:36:30] lord we have a good
[1:36:34] adversary he never
[1:36:36] stops and you don't ever have to
[1:36:43] stop praise the
[1:36:45] Lord if the devil can get you to do one
[1:36:49] thing
[1:36:50] wrong he just comes behind it and and
[1:36:53] then he builds over it oh you have
[1:36:56] already done it you you did it already
[1:37:00] so it doesn't matter whether you do it
[1:37:02] again or not you have messed up so keep
[1:37:06] doing
[1:37:08] it and a lot of the times people will
[1:37:11] settle for it and they will just keep
[1:37:13] going and make sure they mess up and
[1:37:15] they mess up
[1:37:18] well when you realize you have messed up
[1:37:21] get back on your feet
[1:37:23] when you realize you are ching A cause
[1:37:26] that is ungodly make sure you get BR
[1:37:28] into Fellowship when you realize that
[1:37:32] what you are doing is against the will
[1:37:33] of God there is still
[1:37:36] Blood on the seat The Mercy Seat of God
[1:37:42] that will one day become a judgment
[1:37:45] seat God is still working on our lives
[1:37:48] God is still forgiven sins when you
[1:37:51] realize you have fallen you have have
[1:37:53] stumbled just get back and keep marching
[1:37:58] on don't

[1:38:18] that is in
[1:38:20] you if you have a little bit of God in

[1:40:58] Psalm
[1:41:14] 103 Psalm 103
[1:41:24] PM
[1:41:30] 1038 the Lord is merciful and gracious
[1:41:33] slow to anger and plenteous in Mercy he
[1:41:37] will not always child neither will he
[1:41:40] keep his anger forever he hath not dealt
[1:41:44] with us after our sins nor rewarded us
[1:41:47] according to our iniquities oh the Lord
[1:41:49] is good for the wages of sin is death
[1:41:55] that is what we deserve that is what
[1:41:57] every man
[1:41:58] deserve who was not born a
[1:42:01] sinner the wages of sin is death but God
[1:42:05] has not rewarded us according to what we
[1:42:08] deserve he is so gracious he is
[1:42:11] plenteous in Mercy the Bible says he
[1:42:14] will not CH he will not keep his anger
[1:42:18] forever just like a father picture of
[1:42:20] his son I think praise the Lord
[1:42:23] verse 11 for as the heaven is high above
[1:42:27] the Earth so great is his Mercy towards
[1:42:30] them that fear Him 12 as far as the East
[1:42:33] is from the West so far have he removed
[1:42:38] our
[1:42:39] transgression our transgressions from us
[1:42:43] like as a father pth his children saw
[1:42:46] the Lord pity of them that fear Him
[1:42:51] Praise the Lord
[1:42:56] for he knoweth our frame he remember
[1:43:00] that we are
[1:43:02] dust as for men his days are as grass as
[1:43:07] a flow of the field so he flourisheth
[1:43:10] for the wind passeth over and it is gone
[1:43:13] and the place thereof shall know it no
[1:43:17] more but the mercy of the Lord is from
[1:43:20] Everlasting to Everlasting upon them
[1:43:22] that fear fear him and his righteousness
[1:43:25] unto children's children to such as keep
[1:43:29] his Covenant and those to those that
[1:43:34] remember his covenants to do
[1:43:38] them praise the Lord what a gracious God
[1:43:42] we are
[1:43:44] serving his mercies are from Everlasting
[1:43:47] to
[1:43:49] Everlasting he would
[1:43:51] not keep his anger forever he remembers
[1:43:55] that we are human
[1:43:57] beings he knows what we are capable of
[1:44:00] he knows what we can do he know our
[1:44:06] limitations and the Lord has not
[1:44:09] appropriated to us according to
[1:44:13] what we need no if God should reward us
[1:44:20] accordingly none of us will be in this
[1:44:22] room
[1:44:26] we are seated here purely by
[1:44:29] Grace purely by
[1:44:31] Grace God may have taken me from a dumb
[1:44:36] site in
[1:44:37] Africa and he may have taken you from
[1:44:40] another D site somewhere in Asia or here
[1:44:43] in America but the F remains that we are
[1:44:47] all here by the grace of God God has
[1:44:51] delivered us from one thing or the other
[1:44:55] praise be to God he is such a merciful
[1:44:58] god that you know the Bible says his
[1:45:01] word would not go out and return unto
[1:45:03] him void the the word of God doesn't
[1:45:06] just come just for the sake of it all we
[1:45:10] are doing this morning may just be for
[1:45:12] one
[1:45:14] person it may just be for one person
[1:45:18] praise the
[1:45:20] Lord and we all have to rejoice in it
[1:45:24] because the Bible has made it clear that
[1:45:26] when one soul is redeemed or repent that
[1:45:28] there is joy in heaven and whatever
[1:45:31] brings Joy To God In Heaven Must Be must
[1:45:34] be joyful to
[1:45:36] us it is something we should also
[1:45:38] rejoice in Praise the Lord it may be for
[1:45:42] one person nobody
[1:45:46] knows but if your life is not right with
[1:45:51] God
[1:45:53] if you are doing something that is
[1:45:55] contrary if you have
[1:45:58] fallen if you have
[1:46:00] stumbled it doesn't matter how many
[1:46:02] times you have
[1:46:03] stumbled the just shall fall seven times
[1:46:06] and rise again it doesn't matter how
[1:46:09] many times you have stumbled it doesn't
[1:46:12] matter how many times you have fallen it
[1:46:14] doesn't matter how you were
[1:46:16] injured just get back on your feet you
[1:46:20] don't have to run at a 100 miles per
[1:46:23] hour if it is just one step at a time
[1:46:26] that is all God expects of
[1:46:28] you just keep moving on keep marching
[1:46:32] forward stumbling I know but here I come
[1:46:36] stumbling I know but I'm not giving up
[1:46:39] stumbling I know but I know the Lord my
[1:46:41] God is through stumbling I know I know
[1:46:44] my God is faithful stumbling I know God
[1:46:47] is merciful and his mercies are from
[1:46:50] Everlasting to Everlasting praise God be
[1:46:53] to God do not
[1:46:56] let your
[1:46:59] weakness come in the
[1:47:01] way when the devil points you to your
[1:47:04] weakness Point him to the
[1:47:09] blood praise the
[1:47:11] Lord stumbling I know but I'm coming I'm
[1:47:16] not going to stop I'm not going back
[1:47:18] into the world I'm never going to give
[1:47:20] up I'm not throwing in the tower
[1:47:22] stumbling I know but I'm
[1:47:26] coming stumbled I
[1:47:28] know but I'll will not be pinned down by
[1:47:31] my
[1:47:32] past praise be to God the Lord our God
[1:47:35] is the same yesterday today and
[1:47:38] forever God is still changing
[1:47:42] lives God is still transforming
[1:47:46] Lives why do we come to
[1:47:48] church of course we come to praise the
[1:47:51] Lord and to hear from God
[1:47:54] and God
[1:47:56] Alone knows what you are going through
[1:48:00] and what you are dealing with I don't
[1:48:04] know I don't know as a matter of fact
[1:48:07] when brother one told me to get ready I
[1:48:09] went somewhere there was something that
[1:48:12] was so much on my heart and then I
[1:48:13] realized that no I came back here no I
[1:48:16] went somewhere I was just all over the
[1:48:19] place so even deciding what to talk
[1:48:22] about
[1:48:24] about I don't
[1:48:27] know I can only
[1:48:29] trust that whatever I pick is the will
[1:48:33] of God and that God through it is going
[1:48:37] to speak to
[1:48:39] somebody praise the Lord I have no way
[1:48:43] of
[1:48:43] knowing which way God is going to move I
[1:48:46] have no way I can't
[1:48:49] tell praise the Lord stumbling I know
[1:48:53] that I'm
[1:48:57] coming the devil can give you all the
[1:48:59] excuses in the
[1:49:01] world when he gets to
[1:49:04] realize that you are not settling down
[1:49:07] for any of
[1:49:09] them you baffle him you baffle
[1:49:14] him we say the Devil is a warrior we say
[1:49:17] um he his
[1:49:19] um a while ago what did I say he said
[1:49:22] it's a good
[1:49:23] adversary but the devil was to say what
[1:49:26] I have not seen any adversary like this
[1:49:28] brother I have not seen any adversary
[1:49:31] like this sister it is not
[1:49:36] you when the word has taken a hold of
[1:49:39] your house it is no longer about
[1:49:44] you praise the
[1:49:47] Lord I think we are doing very good with
[1:49:50] time
[1:50:04] praise the
[1:50:05] Lord stumbling I
[1:50:11] know the prodal
[1:50:13] son when the Lord Jesus Christ talked
[1:50:16] about that
[1:50:17] story about a rich
[1:50:20] man who son
[1:50:23] came to his father and asked for his
[1:50:26] share of The
[1:50:27] Inheritance normally your father would
[1:50:30] die or your parents will die before we
[1:50:32] talk about inheritance but here he comes
[1:50:36] in
[1:50:37] fact it just tells you about human
[1:50:41] nature that human beings can be very
[1:50:43] very bad without the love of God in the
[1:50:47] heart of a man that man can be very very
[1:50:51] bad that some of the this rich people
[1:50:54] thank God some of us are not rich that
[1:50:57] their children probably pray for their
[1:50:59] parents to die
[1:51:01] quick so that can inherit the
[1:51:05] wealth yes it's
[1:51:09] true so poverty sometimes is a disguise
[1:51:16] blessing praise the
[1:51:19] Lord
[1:51:20] because they know you don't have
[1:51:22] anything
[1:51:24] if you die today they have nothing to
[1:51:27] inherit maybe do not even have money to
[1:51:29] perform the
[1:51:31] funeral so they pray that you live
[1:51:34] long that is a blessing so if you have
[1:51:37] things to make right in your life you
[1:51:40] have a little time to make things right
[1:51:42] praise the
[1:51:44] lord it's true because I have a friend
[1:51:47] at work a very very nice person a nice
[1:51:51] guy if I mention his name brother Johnny
[1:51:53] will know him he told me his mother went
[1:51:57] on
[1:51:57] retirement and then the mother was in
[1:52:01] the nursing
[1:52:02] home and drawing from her her pension
[1:52:07] and guess what some of his siblings got
[1:52:11] angry that his mother was spending too
[1:52:13] much can you imagine he said but it's
[1:52:16] mommy's money he said no but she's
[1:52:19] spending too much by the time she dies
[1:52:21] she would have finished everything
[1:52:23] and he said and
[1:52:25] so so can you imagine they were praying
[1:52:28] that she would die quick so they will
[1:52:30] inherit the money the rest of the
[1:52:32] morning it's sad it's
[1:52:35] sad but before she died she willed all
[1:52:39] her money to the Catholic Church
[1:52:48] $250,000 so poverty can be a disg
[1:52:50] blessing
[1:52:53] I know we don't like we don't want to
[1:52:54] hear that praise the Lord God send it
[1:52:57] far
[1:52:59] away and this boy got his wealth and he
[1:53:03] went and blew
[1:53:05] it and after he had wasted
[1:53:08] everything he found himself sleeping
[1:53:10] with pigs and eating pig
[1:53:13] food and he couldn't stand it
[1:53:16] anymore he said no I am tired living
[1:53:19] this type of life I am tired living in
[1:53:23] I am tired I will just go back to my
[1:53:26] father's house I am not worthy to be
[1:53:29] taken back as as as as as a hair of the
[1:53:32] throne but I'll be Satisfied if my
[1:53:35] father would just take me in as a
[1:53:37] servant that would be enough and it is
[1:53:40] not easy I believe with all my heart
[1:53:44] that in this story that even though we
[1:53:46] have not read it but when he got up and
[1:53:48] he was on his way to his father's house
[1:53:51] the devil may have have told him on the
[1:53:53] way that you don't let your father see
[1:53:55] you because he will kill you you were a
[1:53:59] dishonorable son and he said no stumbled
[1:54:03] I know but I'm going anyhow the devil
[1:54:06] told him your father would never accept
[1:54:08] you even as a servant your father would
[1:54:11] never be proud of you he said
[1:54:14] yes you may be telling me the truth
[1:54:16] stumbled I know but I'm going anyhow it
[1:54:20] doesn't matter what the devil told him
[1:54:22] he still went ahead anyhow and to his
[1:54:26] surprise when he got to the hous Kate
[1:54:29] the father was there already waiting
[1:54:32] praise the Lord that before he ever
[1:54:34] decided to go back there was a father
[1:54:38] waiting to receive him praise the Lord I
[1:54:41] don't know how many times the father
[1:54:43] came at the outskates and looked in that
[1:54:46] direction and probably said to himself
[1:54:49] he went this way and I believe by the
[1:54:52] grace of God one day he is going to come
[1:54:54] back this
[1:54:56] way praise the Lord stumbling I know we
[1:55:00] can talk about that that
[1:55:02] Pharisee Simon the Pharisee who invited
[1:55:05] the Lord Jesus Christ to sit with him at
[1:55:08] meat and the Lord came and he did not
[1:55:11] welcome him in those days it was just
[1:55:14] the norm that when a man comes because
[1:55:17] you walk a long distance by the time you
[1:55:20] come your feet is dirty you are sweating
[1:55:23] as a sign of that that they have
[1:55:25] welcomed you they wash your feet you
[1:55:27] know anoint your feet you know give you
[1:55:31] a keiss anoint you with oil but when he
[1:55:34] came and sat
[1:55:35] down nobody minded
[1:55:38] him he was just sitting
[1:55:41] down they just invited him to mock at
[1:55:44] him they invited him to make fun of
[1:55:48] him and he knew it he knew it and I have
[1:55:53] always asked myself that if they invited
[1:55:57] him to make fun of him and he knew about
[1:56:00] it and he went if you are inviting him
[1:56:03] for a good cause do you think he will
[1:56:05] come or
[1:56:07] not do you think he will come on out
[1:56:11] praise the
[1:56:13] Lord like a story I Once Upon a Time
[1:56:15] shared here about a sister who just uh
[1:56:18] prepared food and he prayed and he said
[1:56:22] father
[1:56:23] I have heard about you I have given my
[1:56:26] life to you I love you I have read about
[1:56:29] you but you know I have never seen you I
[1:56:32] have prepared food I want you to come so
[1:56:36] we eat together she prepared the food
[1:56:39] set the table and was
[1:56:42] waiting and was
[1:56:45] waiting she was in the room and then she
[1:56:47] heard a
[1:56:48] knock and when she came and opened the
[1:56:50] door there was was somebody in front of
[1:56:54] the
[1:56:55] door you know human
[1:56:57] beings she just eyeballed him from head
[1:57:00] to
[1:57:01] toe and he didn't look like
[1:57:05] no this person looks like he's not in
[1:57:07] his right
[1:57:08] mind see how he's
[1:57:13] dressed and the fellow asked for
[1:57:16] water and then she went
[1:57:20] in and she took took a cup a cup that
[1:57:25] she wouldn't give to normal
[1:57:28] strangers a cup that she probably had
[1:57:31] not drunk from for years that was
[1:57:34] sitting Loosely somewhere she took that
[1:57:37] cup and Saed the man with
[1:57:39] water then the man left she sat and sat
[1:57:43] and sat and sat then it was night she
[1:57:46] prayed said father I prepared the table
[1:57:49] you didn't show up then she went to B
[1:57:51] and then she had a
[1:57:53] dream that the Lord appeared to her in
[1:57:55] the dream you invited me I came but you
[1:57:58] didn't receive
[1:58:03] me when you invite God he
[1:58:07] comes when you call him he shows
[1:58:11] up praise the
[1:58:14] Lord the Lord is so
[1:58:18] good the Lord is so good
[1:58:23] you don't have to see him face to face
[1:58:26] the way I'm looking at you but when you
[1:58:29] call him he shows
[1:58:30] up and
[1:58:32] sometimes to let you know that he's
[1:58:35] around he will just do
[1:58:39] something and when you see
[1:58:42] it oh this is not
[1:58:44] normal
[1:58:46] no it must be the
[1:58:49] Lord just to announce his presence
[1:58:52] that the Lord is with
[1:58:59] you how did I get
[1:59:04] here yes so talking about samon the
[1:59:10] Pharisee and the Lord was sitting down
[1:59:13] never attended to him and then this
[1:59:17] woman we have all read about
[1:59:22] so that there was an opportunity
[1:59:28] here and the Bible says she
[1:59:32] went and bought a very costly
[1:59:38] ointment very very expensive very
[1:59:44] special and what that woman
[1:59:47] did I don't
[1:59:49] think it was easy
[1:59:55] this is the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[1:59:57] talking
[1:59:59] about who would
[2:00:01] desend men's heart tell you of things to
[2:00:04] happen things that are going to
[2:00:07] be and I believe when she went for the
[2:00:10] money and she took that money she said
[2:00:13] to herself
[2:00:15] oh this man will know how I came by this
[2:00:19] morning that this money is not even
[2:00:21] clean
[2:00:23] this money is
[2:00:24] filthy and I'm going to use this for
[2:00:27] anointment for a holy one for the Lord
[2:00:31] himself but there was something that was
[2:00:33] driving him she couldn't help it
[2:00:36] probably one time bought this um um
[2:00:38] ointment and then went to Simon's place
[2:00:43] and then when she got to the gate it
[2:00:45] wasn't an easy task because she probably
[2:00:48] had looked it was a public place it was
[2:00:51] not d in secret she probably looked in
[2:00:54] the Gathering and probably saw some of
[2:00:57] her
[2:00:58] clients sitting there and looking at her
[2:01:01] and they were wondering what is this
[2:01:03] woman here
[2:01:04] for and the Lord was sitting down and as
[2:01:08] she was coming yes I know my life is not
[2:01:12] right I know I have stumbled I know I
[2:01:16] have messed
[2:01:17] up I know I am just a bundle of
[2:01:20] mess oh this is the Holy One what do I
[2:01:23] do it's in my heart to go and anoint his
[2:01:27] feet would he even accept it would he
[2:01:31] accept
[2:01:32] me with my Filthy
[2:01:35] Hands with my useless
[2:01:37] life with my hopeless life with all the
[2:01:41] rotness and the filth there is in me
[2:01:43] would he accept this offer and as he
[2:01:46] just took a step just step by step just
[2:01:50] yes stumbled I know but here I come and
[2:01:54] the people probably looking at her what
[2:01:56] is this woman doing what is this woman
[2:01:58] doing and then she
[2:02:00] went as we all know the story held her
[2:02:03] his feet and God just opened the
[2:02:06] fountain in her eyes and then she washed
[2:02:10] his feet washed his feet wiped his feet
[2:02:13] with his hair and anointed his feet

[2:07:22] Onward Christian Soldiers I
[2:07:25] looked and here come that scented bunch
[2:07:30] of little
[2:07:31] girls just exactly the way they
[2:07:34] was all correctly dressed their hair
[2:07:39] hanging way down on their back smooth
[2:07:43] clean matching like this to the step of
[2:07:47] the Gospel she was the word praise the
[2:07:50] Lord she was the word praise the
[2:07:54] lord we must be the
[2:07:56] word as you feed on the word you become
[2:08:00] the word praise the
[2:08:03] Lord so I keep
[2:08:05] asking if you have to feed on the word
[2:08:08] to become the word and you are not
[2:08:10] feeding on the word however do you
[2:08:13] become the
[2:08:15] word I don't have to say it but somebody
[2:08:20] that has never seen you should be able
[2:08:22] to look at your life and see the word of
[2:08:24] God in
[2:08:26] you they should be able to see God in
[2:08:31] you praise the Lord you are what you
[2:08:37] eat if you eat things that will make you
[2:08:40] sick you will get sick if you eat
[2:08:43] healthy you'll be
[2:08:45] healthy if you feed on the word for man
[2:08:49] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:08:51] every word that proceeds out of the
[2:08:53] mouth of
[2:08:56] God you starve your soul when you deny
[2:09:01] it the
[2:09:05] word you starve your soul your real self
[2:09:09] when you can go a whole day without
[2:09:12] reading the word without consecrating
[2:09:14] yourself to the
[2:09:16] word without having a fellowship with
[2:09:19] God you are starving your
[2:09:22] so and some of us don't do it just in on
[2:09:24] a daily basis we do it weekly we do it
[2:09:28] monthly and sometimes we don't even know
[2:09:31] where our bibles are in the
[2:09:34] house how do you fellowship with
[2:09:38] God what relationship do you have with
[2:09:42] God your relationship with God tomorrow
[2:09:45] is determined with your relationship
[2:09:47] with God
[2:09:49] today if you do not have any
[2:09:51] relationship with God today it shows how
[2:09:55] much you will not have any relationship
[2:09:57] with him
[2:10:02] tomorrow it's just one simple step a
[2:10:08] day one simple step a
[2:10:12] day make sure that you are conscious of
[2:10:16] the presence of God make sure that you
[2:10:19] are in the will of God make sure
[2:10:22] that you are just living be in the
[2:10:26] word praise the
[2:10:29] Lord she was the
[2:10:35] word they looked like one out of every
[2:10:41] nation I was looking at it as they
[2:10:47] passed and seeing them that seeing them
[2:10:51] pass by instead of going down they
[2:10:54] started going up I noticed one of them
[2:10:57] trying two or three of them trying
[2:11:01] getting out of line I screamed stay in
[2:11:04] line and the vision left
[2:11:07] me and I was standing in the room
[2:11:10] screaming stay in
[2:11:12] line praise the
[2:11:14] Lord what makes a man or a woman to get
[2:11:18] out of line
[2:11:21] what makes a man or a woman to get out
[2:11:24] of
[2:11:32] line there is so much
[2:11:35] pressure in the world we are living in
[2:11:39] today and there is a lot to take our
[2:11:41] attention from the word of
[2:11:43] God and when you lose
[2:11:46] track of what God is doing in this day
[2:11:49] and age you you will give yourself to
[2:11:52] any
[2:11:54] Spirit if you lose track of god of what
[2:11:58] God is doing
[2:11:59] today you will settle for
[2:12:04] anything what makes a
[2:12:06] man to get out of
[2:12:10] track when the anchor
[2:12:13] holds the
[2:12:15] reason you will drift
[2:12:18] away with the current
[2:12:21] or with the flow is because you have no
[2:12:27] anchor there is no
[2:12:30] anchor it is God it is the word that
[2:12:33] does the
[2:12:35] anchoring is the word that would anchor
[2:12:37] your
[2:12:40] soul that it doesn't matter what happens
[2:12:42] to this
[2:12:45] flesh it doesn't matter what happens you
[2:12:49] know that deep inside of you you are
[2:12:55] anchored that if you should fall dead
[2:12:57] right now you know by the grace of God
[2:13:00] your soul is
[2:13:03] saved that you don't flow with the
[2:13:06] wind you don't just toss you are not
[2:13:09] tossed about like a ball on the on on on
[2:13:12] the sea being tossed by the waves in any
[2:13:15] direction
[2:13:16] no you are
[2:13:19] anchored and it is the
[2:13:21] word that keeps
[2:13:24] you a lot of the times we think we keep
[2:13:26] the word it is the word that is keeping
[2:13:29] you praise the
[2:13:32] Lord and when the word has anchored your
[2:13:36] soul praise the
[2:13:39] Lord my
[2:13:41] goodness they can do anything to the
[2:13:48] body they can starve you to death
[2:13:52] they can Slaughter
[2:13:53] you they can put you in the
[2:13:56] furnace they can feed you to the
[2:14:00] Lions they can saw you as
[2:14:05] Stander yes you feel the pain there is
[2:14:08] no doubt about
[2:14:11] it
[2:14:13] but you be glad you
[2:14:17] did like the three Hebrew children we
[2:14:21] know our God will deliver us and even
[2:14:25] if even
[2:14:27] if he chooses not to will still not bow

[2:14:33] believe that is
[2:14:35] when the unor is
