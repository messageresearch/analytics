[39:57] us here by the grace of God and praise
[40:06] Lord now so we we will we will deal with
[40:09] this we will deal with this and just I'm
[40:12] just kind of a trust in the Lord because
[40:15] like I said I don't want to go into
[40:17] doctrines you know if you get your
[40:19] doctrine or gun pulls out just put it
[40:21] back in the share we're not going to
[40:22] deal with doctrine this morning there's
[40:24] there's an inspiration that is so my
[40:26] heart and I'm praying that God will be
[40:29] able to bring it out but you see we have
[40:31] to establish everything by the wording
[40:33] you know there by the scripture by the
[40:35] message of the hour so I'm going to be
[40:38] looking at some few things yeah I mean
[40:40] we you will be tempted to think on some
[40:42] few things it's not wrong and but I just
[40:46] want for God to be able to help us see
[40:49] him now brother Branham says something
[40:50] in the message what was the Holy Ghost
[40:53] giving for there was a message he
[40:55] preached after he preached what is the
[40:58] Holy Ghost now thinking about this
[41:01] subject in thinking about the days of
[41:04] Pentecost and the Holy Ghost coming on a
[41:06] days of Pentecost what is on my mind
[41:09] when I listened to brother Branham
[41:12] talking about you know what is the Holy
[41:14] Ghost
[41:15] what is he giving for you know and and
[41:18] and how do we know we have he and he's
[41:20] talking about all of these things you
[41:22] know and he says some things in
[41:24] India is data you know he's saying all
[41:29] of these things and we will read what he
[41:32] said just now and in my mind I'm
[41:35] thinking about you know trying to drive
[41:40] the service my inspiration in a way to
[41:43] say knowing the Holy Ghost to know the
[41:48] Holy Ghost and how do we know the Holy
[41:50] Ghost because because of church
[41:53] teachings the Holy Ghost has been more
[41:56] in a dot uniformed
[41:58] you know in the teaching form you know
[42:01] you know you born again you receive the
[42:04] Holy Ghost you receive the Holy Ghost
[42:05] you know you feel with the Holy Ghost
[42:06] and and I mean all of these things I
[42:08] just did and with all of these teachings
[42:11] sometimes the mind is just overwhelming
[42:14] and and and and sometimes it's I mean
[42:18] it's but think about it this way think
[42:21] about it this way that's I'm going to
[42:22] talk about the Holy Ghost as the
[42:24] comforter this morning but think about
[42:26] it this way I'm going to keep one major
[42:29] type in your mind
[42:31] Eloisa he types the Holy Ghost he was a
[42:37] seven of the father that was sent out to
[42:42] such a Brian
[42:44] praise Lord and everything that Rebecca
[42:49] we know about Isaac was taught to her by
[42:54] Eliezer number for her to be able to
[42:59] trust the information about Isaac she
[43:03] has to know this man she has to know
[43:08] this man she's dealing with here he
[43:10] talking about traveling hundreds of
[43:12] miles to go and and a young virgin girl
[43:17] going to trust her life in the man that
[43:20] she just met other well for them to
[43:23] travel through the desert on the
[43:26] mountains in a charity to leave her to
[43:30] Isaac
[43:34] and her father axe her Rebecca will you
[43:38] go she said I will go she will not say
[43:42] that because she just under some kind of
[43:44] illusion to you when I said that because
[43:47] you just want to run out of her father
[43:48] house to go and jump in the hands of a
[43:51] man because Isaac was not just around
[43:54] the corner Isaac was over the mountains
[43:58] cross the lake down the violet through
[44:00] the desert they were going to travel and
[44:03] travel and travel and before we get in
[44:06] the hands of our Isaac this Holy Ghost
[44:08] is going to travel with us through
[44:10] trials through death through difficult
[44:13] situation if we don't know him and don't
[44:15] trust him we will get to the end of the
[44:18] day we don't even believe God we will
[44:22] not even believe that there is a God
[44:24] because we don't know the one that is
[44:27] dealing with us we don't know the one
[44:33] that have been sent to lead us to guide
[44:36] us to teach us that's what the Holy
[44:38] Ghost is the Holy Ghost is not just a
[44:43] badge for a church identification praise
[44:49] the Lord I'm afraid I will not get out
[44:51] of this today praise the Lord
[44:55] oh man so you just keep ELISA in your
[45:01] mind look at her look at her a picture
[45:08] pretty soon they're going to go from her
[45:11] father house she will be looking at the
[45:15] compound where she grew her favorite
[45:17] tree the world that she used to go to
[45:19] fresh water and slowly she's going away
[45:22] from home
[45:23] the chair will go down the street home
[45:26] her favorite grocery center where she
[45:28] likes to go and slowly they are going
[45:31] away from home and as the chair goes
[45:35] along
[45:36] she realized that they have entered
[45:39] another town not too far from home and
[45:41] she says oh I never been here before
[45:45] the other is I said oh yeah when I was
[45:48] coming to your place I came right down
[45:49] here you know right across here that's
[45:51] there's a goldsmith there he works there
[45:54] and she's oh wow you know my area more
[45:58] than me and what is happening as he
[46:03] relates to her he's buying her
[46:06] confidence that I know this area I'm not
[46:09] carrying you into dangerous water and
[46:11] have passed this place before
[46:13] and this whole agos that we have has is
[46:16] the same lowly goals that have led men
[46:19] this way before he knows the way we can
[46:25] trust him we can put our life into his
[46:27] hands that's what we want to talk about
[46:33] this morning knowing the Holy Ghost
[46:41] suppori of your daughter no guns in your
[46:43] pocket at the end of the salmon you can
[46:46] decide what you want to do with me amen
[46:50] keep me as a friend write me off a big
[46:53] life give me a middle name I don't have
[46:55] none praise the Lord
[46:58] where burn him share this in a message
[47:00] what is the Holy Ghost giving for he
[47:02] said last night we were speaking what
[47:05] was what was the Holy Ghost and we find
[47:10] it to be just about everything that God
[47:16] promised to us the Holy Ghost is just
[47:22] about everything if you make the Holy
[47:24] Ghost only speaking in tongues you have
[47:27] taken the least part of the Holy Ghost
[47:29] because tongue is the least part of the
[47:31] body and the more dearly part of the
[47:33] body praise the Lord
[47:35] a mean it's just about everything that
[47:46] God promised to us this is the proper
[47:52] teaching on the Holy Ghost hmm he said
[47:55] in heed
[47:58] in it we find just what God's church who
[48:03] need just what the Church of God would
[48:08] need in holy girls we found it to be a
[48:19] seal a comforter the rest the joy the
[48:26] peace the resurrection and all that God
[48:30] promised to his church lives within the
[48:36] Holy Spirit and then when people argue
[48:41] about the holy God no is this is that
[48:44] you are just limiting it to all your
[48:46] idea thing it is you are just limiting
[48:52] it to what your idea thing it is and
[48:55] that is the reason why when people hold
[48:58] to these things hold to these things I
[49:03] don't know what I told you this story
[49:04] before I sure I did
[49:05] and you know just just I mean just a
[49:09] young preacher starting out there way
[49:11] back at in 1993-94 I went into one area
[49:15] that was where we actually had our first
[49:17] church and go with a lot of this thing
[49:19] to happen sister faith please God will
[49:24] allow this thing to happen just just so
[49:29] he can he can push us because I was so
[49:32] scared to death to start a church we
[49:37] will have a Bible status I love Bible
[49:40] studies it man I don't know if it's a
[49:42] ministry called Bible study teacher but
[49:44] I love Bible studies because we can
[49:46] really be able to get hold of people ask
[49:48] question and fellowship together praise
[49:51] the Lord and and and that's what I would
[49:53] do to the brothers and Sunday we will
[49:54] find a church to go you know and just
[49:57] like that praise the Lord thank you and
[50:03] we were working with this Pentecostal
[50:07] preacher I mean very very wonderful
[50:09] brother and I'm
[50:12] fiery preacher we would go on a street
[50:14] corner to preach and and I mean this guy
[50:17] would just run down the street I mean he
[50:19] will just but we we had an era of
[50:22] conflict because he being a you're not a
[50:24] Pentecostal preacher you're another
[50:26] Pentecostal boy he believed that
[50:28] speaking in tongues were the evidence of
[50:29] the Holy Ghost and then and we didn't
[50:32] believe that speaking in tongues for the
[50:33] evidence of the Holy Ghost so he he said
[50:36] we did not hide the Holy Ghost
[50:39] you know and we were talking about it
[50:42] and I we went our not going too fast for
[50:44] him about it and you know and and I
[50:47] really remember some other young
[50:48] brothers there with me there was one day
[50:50] that was that was trying to have the
[50:52] Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues you
[50:54] know he was practicing him you know and
[50:56] letting his tongue loose Amy but I know
[51:01] I've spoken in tongues before and it was
[51:03] not in church it was in prayer you know
[51:07] I mean I prayed and I pray that that I
[51:09] turned loose and I started saying things
[51:11] I didn't know what but I was just having
[51:13] a good time before the Lord Amen that
[51:16] was exactly what Hannah did in the
[51:18] temple and Eli thought she was drunk
[51:20] you know when you put your heart before
[51:22] God where you break loose and you just
[51:25] praising God and just crying and just
[51:28] talking to God I mean you just loose
[51:31] your mind
[51:31] I mean your mind thinking one thing your
[51:34] tongue saying another thing amen so it
[51:39] got to the place where you know we would
[51:41] talk all the time in and there were two
[51:43] things that he did not really understood
[51:46] in the scripture one was you know
[51:48] speaking in tongues now been evidence of
[51:50] the Holy Ghost and predestination he I
[51:52] do the body I show him to write in the
[51:54] scripture the word is in the Bible he
[51:56] says the word is not in the Bible
[51:58] showing him right there he got freeze he
[52:01] went home but if not brother we work
[52:02] together and but what was happening was
[52:06] he was the leader that was with him that
[52:10] he taught us was his wife was not
[52:12] actually his wife they came from the
[52:14] same church background they'd met India
[52:17] in the adjoining because we all migrated
[52:20] to that area because of the wall so on
[52:23] their way that's how the methane
[52:25] you know and it decided to stay together
[52:27] and and and this woman who come to
[52:31] church would be just speaking in tongues
[52:32] all over the place there was another
[52:34] woman there you know so you always asked
[52:36] them to pray you know prayers of
[52:37] speaking tongues and we'll be there
[52:39] worship the Lord you know and you know
[52:41] the brothers were just but one can we
[52:44] just do something when I won't forget I
[52:45] say no let's say I'm we gotta wait for
[52:47] the leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord
[52:49] help me you know I'm just so scared to
[52:51] death I'm telling him just so scared to
[52:53] death I'm saying Lord Jesus you just got
[52:55] to help us yet I don't want to go and do
[52:57] something on my own
[52:58] so but what will happen here is that
[53:00] this woman was struggling she was
[53:04] struggling with a habit a drinking habit
[53:05] we did not know about it didn't knew
[53:07] about it and and and one time it
[53:09] happened that I mean she just I mean she
[53:12] was overtaken by this habit the fast and
[53:14] out of there in this daring you know and
[53:16] then the woman you know went over and
[53:18] talked the whole story on IV your wife
[53:20] and all this this is early the morning
[53:22] early in the morning around 7 o'clock I
[53:27] saw this brother to detour to the house
[53:30] he was he was older than us you know
[53:32] came over to the house and not the door
[53:34] I said woman what's that
[53:36] Carranza he said bird one I need to talk
[53:40] to you I said okay pull to the side he
[53:44] says I will tell you something you know
[53:47] you have told me over and over that
[53:49] speaking in tongues was not the evidence
[53:52] of the holy God he says a struggle with
[53:54] there he says why I've come to believe
[53:57] it he says I've come to believe it I'm
[54:02] thinking in my head you know I'm trying
[54:04] to rejoice there may be none angel of
[54:06] the Lord visited him you know and you
[54:09] know and show him the scripture that I'm
[54:11] now I'm ready now to go into everything
[54:13] you know because we talked about Malachi
[54:16] 4 we spoke about all of those things and
[54:18] he says and I have something to may
[54:20] write with you I said what is there
[54:23] since well you know the setting woman
[54:25] you know that - that my wife is really
[54:27] not my wife
[54:28] really how could you do that
[54:32] you know how could you do that and I
[54:35] mean we just we and this God is just
[54:37] bawling and just
[54:38] crying you know and and then that was
[54:42] how we we parted ways because I just
[54:45] told him I says I just can't believe
[54:47] that you let us in such a deception you
[54:49] know for a long time so we parted ways
[54:53] you know it was almost like you know God
[54:57] just had an Holy gone at the back of my
[54:59] head you gotta move boy I mean so I just
[55:04] stepped into there but you know what I'm
[55:06] saying here is that if we just if we
[55:10] just you know just reduce the Holy Ghost
[55:13] to just our idea of one thing we think a
[55:17] race you know you know brother branham
[55:20] you know talk about the Holy Ghost as
[55:23] you know recognizing your message of the
[55:26] day how many people does not even go any
[55:29] father they just believe our enemy is a
[55:31] prophet I mean the entire message
[55:32] verbatim says the Holy Ghost is a
[55:34] message of the hour and recognizing your
[55:36] message of the day you know and it just
[55:38] as well I had the Holy Ghost you know
[55:41] but the prophet of God says here he says
[55:43] is everything that the church needs you
[55:46] know everything that God has promised is
[55:48] our comforter I will rest our joy the
[55:51] seal the resurrection and all that God
[55:56] promised to his church lays within the
[55:59] Holy Ghost let's go a little bit here he
[56:01] says here now their purpose is his name
[56:06] the purpose what was God's purpose in
[56:13] sending the Holy Spirit now I will knock
[56:19] that down st. John 14 beginning with the
[56:23] the the fourteenth verse he says and
[56:28] reading true the chapter for a base we
[56:32] will get back to death he said we should
[56:34] read through the chapter of Saint John
[56:36] chapter 14 for a base to be able to
[56:38] understand what was God's purpose in
[56:41] sending the Holy Ghost
[56:43] God's purpose we find here in sending
[56:48] the Holy Spirit was one purpose
[56:52] one purpose that God Himself my door in
[57:00] his church back to Exeter why he told
[57:05] Moses to build a tabernacle one purpose
[57:08] because I want to come down and do it am
[57:11] all my people one purpose that God
[57:16] himself might word in his church and
[57:19] continue his plan through the church
[57:26] what is our series the continuation of
[57:29] the book of Acts God's purpose is to
[57:33] dword in his church and continue his
[57:36] plan through the church that God was in
[57:40] Christ continuing his plane through
[57:44] Christ out of Christ into the church
[57:49] continuing his work through the church
[57:53] the purpose of the Holy Ghost was not
[57:56] sitting on the bench it was not getting
[58:00] a badge I mean a message no it was so
[58:04] continuing on his work God in Christ
[58:08] reconciling the world through Christ to
[58:10] his church oh that was him God he pulled
[58:12] into Christ all that was in Christ he
[58:15] pulled into the church to continue his
[58:18] plan of redemption
[58:21] explained through his church one purpose
[58:24] one purpose one purpose and the evidence
[58:28] of the Holy Ghost will be God fulfilling
[58:31] that purpose through your life because
[58:35] that's what the Holy Ghost was giving
[58:37] for for God to continue to deal with
[58:39] your heart for God to continue on Toto
[58:42] to increase your walk in the word for
[58:45] God to continue to show his love to you
[58:48] for God to continue to do his work that
[58:53] is the purpose of the Holy Ghost amen
[58:57] and to step away from there we will run
[59:01] ourselves into trouble
[59:05] to step away from there we will run
[59:08] ourselves into trouble now yeah brother
[59:10] Branham says we must use Saint John
[59:13] chapter 14 that would be to Becky joy
[59:18] and all the young people the last time I
[59:21] give you people it's in John chapter 14
[59:24] in John chapter 15 see John chapter 16
[59:27] for you people to read and and for you
[59:32] to be able to gather everything that the
[59:35] Holy Ghost was was was identifying so
[59:43] it's in John chapter 14 we are going to
[59:46] get a base of the Holy Ghost let's pick
[59:49] up some few things here Saint John
[59:53] chapter 14 verse 16 amen it wouldn't
[59:59] help me if I don't turn to it praise the
[1:00:02] Lord and you young people we're going to
[1:00:11] deal with this subject a little bit I'm
[1:00:13] just waiting for the the church to be a
[1:00:18] little bit clearer out where I can get
[1:00:20] us in I want to spend some time with you
[1:00:23] deal with this subject I mean they're
[1:00:26] they have things that are happening
[1:00:27] praise the Lord Amen with all of these
[1:00:31] things happening around us we know that
[1:00:34] our redemption is drawing nigh amen
[1:00:36] praise the Lord some we have to go
[1:00:39] before us and some of us who wait for
[1:00:41] the body change praise the Lord but we
[1:00:43] know it's not many dear hints like the
[1:00:46] scripture says praise the Lord so I mean
[1:00:49] this is time for us to to really mean
[1:00:51] business and get serious with God this
[1:00:54] is time for us to I mean clean our house
[1:00:56] clean our life it's no time to play
[1:00:58] around amen
[1:01:01] so we will look here into st. John
[1:01:03] chapter 14 sorry let's start from
[1:01:07] chapter 14 st. John chapter 14 Jesus
[1:01:11] started talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:01:13] year right in verse 16
[1:01:16] I will go quickly now huh right in verse
[1:01:25] 16 he started and he said I will pray I
[1:01:29] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:01:34] you another comforter are we together
[1:01:39] that he would give you another comforter
[1:01:43] that word has has has bother my mind a
[1:01:47] little bit why would Jesus is another
[1:01:49] comforter because they had a comforter
[1:01:51] with them in another way because they
[1:01:58] had the comforter with them in another
[1:01:59] way and and this is what would bring us
[1:02:02] back to - to the talk here on the
[1:02:06] comforter now you look here a little bit
[1:02:08] you will see over in in Isaiah chapter
[1:02:11] as I had chapter 40 and where our sister
[1:02:17] sang from this morning is there 40 verse
[1:02:20] 1 here is a promise true the prophet
[1:02:25] Isaiah
[1:02:26] you know on to Israel comfort heat
[1:02:29] comfort he my people said the Lord speak
[1:02:34] ye comfortable to Jerusalem and cried
[1:02:39] unto her that her warfare is
[1:02:43] accomplished and their heard in equating
[1:02:47] is pattern for she have received of the
[1:02:51] Lord hand double for all her sins now
[1:02:56] and in this message this message that
[1:03:01] was coming to Israel comfort ye comfort
[1:03:04] ye my people you know I was just
[1:03:06] thinking about it I mean I just I don't
[1:03:08] want to break out of what I'm talking
[1:03:10] about this morning but I was thinking
[1:03:12] about this through the week and I was
[1:03:15] saying God is the comforter
[1:03:24] the way that God comforts listen to me
[1:03:27] now the way that God comforts is
[1:03:29] completely different from the way that
[1:03:32] that we human thinks about comfort all
[1:03:36] we demon can do is that we can
[1:03:39] sympathize we can sympathize we can we
[1:03:46] can we try to put ourself we try to feel
[1:03:52] it and and all we do is that we do it in
[1:03:55] our mind sometimes it don't really get
[1:03:57] gets close to our flesh we just think
[1:04:01] about it all my goodness I hate to think
[1:04:03] about it that I mean I mean there that
[1:04:07] church lost its pastor I just think
[1:04:11] about it oh my goodness just talking to
[1:04:12] brother Valentin this morning on my way
[1:04:14] here and we were just talking some few
[1:04:16] things you know because I had to call
[1:04:18] home when I got the message too so you
[1:04:20] know well I can't believe this and you
[1:04:23] know you only think about it you only
[1:04:26] think about it you don't know how it
[1:04:29] feels you know you don't know how it
[1:04:34] feels but when it comes back to our
[1:04:37] assembling you know many of us I would
[1:04:41] not even know how it feels because I was
[1:04:44] not here when you didn't have a pastor I
[1:04:47] will not know how it feels to go many
[1:04:50] years without a pastor you know so you
[1:04:56] can only sympathize about it you yeah
[1:04:58] but wow wow it does not come close it
[1:05:05] does not come close or there are some
[1:05:11] other things in my mind I don't want to
[1:05:13] go into it this morning let me stay
[1:05:14] right in the scripture because this is
[1:05:18] the only thing that would bless us
[1:05:20] politics is not going to help us I mean
[1:05:23] everything happening around the world we
[1:05:25] know our God is in control but look at
[1:05:27] God talking about comforting Israel and
[1:05:30] you know how he would comfort Israel he
[1:05:33] will bring John the Baptist's a man
[1:05:37] that's that's God's comfort to Israel
[1:05:39] he's comforting them because he has
[1:05:42] there with them double he's going to
[1:05:43] comfort them and the way he would come
[1:05:45] for them is to bring them a ministry or
[1:05:48] a young man that never enjoy his tender
[1:05:52] age went into the wilderness at the age
[1:05:55] of nine learning to eat locusts and
[1:05:58] hunting and all of that counts out
[1:06:01] this is God's comfort now this is God
[1:06:05] coming to comfort his people because
[1:06:07] when the scripture speaks about comfor
[1:06:09] comfort comfort give my people it was a
[1:06:11] description of John the Baptist's
[1:06:14] ministry and the way that God would come
[1:06:16] for them it's not a common sense Oh
[1:06:18] Caiaphas you've been so lawyer
[1:06:22] I mean you're been doing the best he
[1:06:24] said repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:06:27] on him and the people said were looking
[1:06:31] for my man is there
[1:06:32] look at his hair no hair caught out of
[1:06:35] there so where he's crazy and you look
[1:06:38] at that I mean right on the River Jordan
[1:06:40] Harris a rollin uh how you call him now
[1:06:46] he's he's a Roman general you know he
[1:06:50] says superior officer combat everybody
[1:06:53] talking about John he comes down there
[1:06:55] with his brother's wife and John trying
[1:06:57] to look at him and says some you are in
[1:07:00] a battery that's your brother's wife you
[1:07:02] know and and all those prisunic he's
[1:07:05] gonna put us in trouble
[1:07:06] Oh his mouth is too wide somebody gotta
[1:07:11] stop this man he's gonna put us in
[1:07:13] trouble he look at the soldiers down on
[1:07:19] the bang who says you people are
[1:07:20] extortion are you taking money from the
[1:07:22] people you over taxing the people he
[1:07:26] look at the religious leaders you
[1:07:28] rebuild them but this was God's comfort
[1:07:32] this is the way that God comfort his
[1:07:35] people I would say some hard things to
[1:07:36] you this morning
[1:07:37] I hope you be ready to take it amen
[1:07:40] because the way that God comfort is
[1:07:43] completely different
[1:07:45] God don't only comfort with words they
[1:07:50] come
[1:07:51] it's not a word the comforter is a
[1:07:53] person the comforter is a person it go
[1:08:03] wood comforts you he steps into your
[1:08:06] situation he comes down into your
[1:08:10] situation that is the reason why when
[1:08:13] the comforter was talking about our Lord
[1:08:15] Jesus it was talking about a spirit that
[1:08:18] were interred in us it does not come to
[1:08:22] make you happy praise the Lord
[1:08:27] it does not comes to make you happy
[1:08:30] but it brings the joy of the Lord amen
[1:08:39] because the things that make you happy
[1:08:40] is chocolate you covered that don't
[1:08:42] bring chocolate it brings the joy of the
[1:08:45] Lord
[1:08:46] he kind of chocolate and raspberry name
[1:08:51] and blueberry in all of this my goodness
[1:08:59] amen praise the Lord
[1:09:06] that was the comforter that was God's
[1:09:10] way of comforting his people by sending
[1:09:15] him his man by sinning
[1:09:20] the same way I tried to use Eliezer join
[1:09:26] us here in a picture praise the Lord
[1:09:31] and yes Jesus comes on the scene and
[1:09:37] with the sign of the Messiah and the
[1:09:41] thing that the people are identifying in
[1:09:44] a scripture they are saying oh my
[1:09:47] goodness could he be the one could he be
[1:09:51] the one they are trying to take comfort
[1:09:55] in his healing ministry but when it
[1:09:59] comes to his doctrine no I mean he gets
[1:10:03] that in the temple this God is
[1:10:05] rude he keeps the table over he's trying
[1:10:10] to get away with all our tradition they
[1:10:12] are trying to find comfort when He
[1:10:15] healed the sick when he raised the dead
[1:10:18] when it comes to the teaching of the
[1:10:20] world the back of you don't want that
[1:10:21] comfort no they don't want the comfort
[1:10:24] that changes their lives they want to
[1:10:27] come for where they can sit and amaya
[1:10:29] Wow
[1:10:31] why you saw how exact he was on it but
[1:10:35] when the comforter comes to start to
[1:10:38] change our lives and change our desire
[1:10:41] we are so stuck in our minds me why me
[1:10:48] why that's how God comfort his people
[1:10:52] that's how he comfort his people and
[1:10:54] Jesus speaking here he saves another
[1:10:58] comforter another comforter you know I
[1:11:05] was thinking on this my goodness me I
[1:11:09] said I mean I'm saying to myself I was
[1:11:17] saying this is a hard saying it's a high
[1:11:22] saying let's read a little bit yeah let
[1:11:25] me not get ahead of myself jesus said
[1:11:27] and I will pray the father and he will
[1:11:30] give you another comforter that he may
[1:11:34] abide with you forever the reason why
[1:11:39] he's using another comforter because his
[1:11:42] ministry is comfort to them but he's
[1:11:45] going to go away he will not stay with
[1:11:46] them forever but this other comforter is
[1:11:49] going to abide with you forever because
[1:11:51] the Holy Ghost leading you through this
[1:11:53] Johnny and across the river on the other
[1:11:55] side it comes back and pick up your body
[1:11:57] for the resurrection and leaves you into
[1:11:59] a glorified body so it's a comforter
[1:12:03] that would be with you forever
[1:12:09] forever
[1:12:11] you know how hard this is that sometimes
[1:12:16] for God to comfort us he would have to
[1:12:21] take the ones that we love jesus says if
[1:12:25] I don't go the comforter will not come
[1:12:34] the human mind will never understand
[1:12:37] that as comfort there is no way we can
[1:12:42] understand that as comfort but I just
[1:12:47] like brother Branham who talks about the
[1:12:48] ego how its terraced nerd he says and I
[1:12:52] mama ego would come and she would tear
[1:12:55] the comfort from honour her babies
[1:12:58] because she knows that there are
[1:13:00] abilities in them and they need to
[1:13:03] exercise the Alain's she would hear the
[1:13:05] comfort from all of them and be crying
[1:13:10] and she would just sweep down under
[1:13:12] there and spread her wings and pretty
[1:13:15] soon you see those little eat bless
[1:13:18] spraying their wings and they're
[1:13:20] enjoying it just like on trampling this
[1:13:24] is all manner that was good but then one
[1:13:28] I've never learned that that was good if
[1:13:30] you never told the nets from under them
[1:13:36] that's the reason why it is hard to
[1:13:38] understand it's hard to understand how
[1:13:44] can that be
[1:13:45] comfort and every time the read is as
[1:13:50] ayah faulty in the temple comfort he
[1:13:53] comfort you my people the priest would
[1:13:55] come up there and give the people
[1:13:57] promises when the Messiah come is going
[1:14:00] to be so peaceful you remember in a time
[1:14:02] of Solomon there was no wall all these
[1:14:04] rumors that you are looking at they're
[1:14:06] going to be on our feet and he's just
[1:14:08] giving the people because the way he
[1:14:10] thinks about comfort it's like in his
[1:14:13] bed the way that God thinks about
[1:14:16] comfort is like John the Baptist laying
[1:14:18] on the straw on a tree no roof over his
[1:14:21] head but yeah and he was God's comfort
[1:14:23] to the people
[1:14:27] praise the Lord
[1:14:31] God comfort to us the comforter to
[1:14:35] brother Branham was to take his wife and
[1:14:38] his baby away because God wanted to get
[1:14:41] his ministry out and Brennan would not
[1:14:47] understand him you and I understand it's
[1:14:50] hard to understand discomfort but when
[1:14:59] I'm trucks I think in a message
[1:15:01] comforter know in a message a true sign
[1:15:05] overlooked he talks about when he built
[1:15:09] his house he said he said my wife never
[1:15:13] wanted to leave her mother he says and I
[1:15:16] feel that it was so hard for us I build
[1:15:18] this house and I told her and says last
[1:15:21] movie and she didn't wanted to move away
[1:15:23] from her from her mom listen to what he
[1:15:25] says now go back and listen to the tape
[1:15:26] he says but when he says now her mother
[1:15:31] is gone and my mother is gone you know
[1:15:35] he says now her mother is gone and my
[1:15:38] mother is gone and I believe that God
[1:15:40] can lead us into the things that he
[1:15:43] wants us to do we think that that we
[1:15:51] think that God is our toy boy that he's
[1:15:56] our toilet boy you know we pleased with
[1:16:00] me thank you I appreciate it you know
[1:16:03] he's our toilet
[1:16:04] you know we just I mean the problem of
[1:16:08] this age the problem of this age that we
[1:16:12] have to be delivered from there are many
[1:16:15] that are worshiping the God of your
[1:16:17] imagination they they have the God of
[1:16:22] your imagination because the the figure
[1:16:25] that God would deal with them this way
[1:16:26] God will provide for them this way God
[1:16:29] would talk to them this way just a god
[1:16:31] of their imagination that's the reason
[1:16:35] why our age is one of the age
[1:16:38] of adulterous people that are
[1:16:40] worshipping idols and that idols is not
[1:16:43] stone it's now rocks
[1:16:46] it's just cover all mine the god of our
[1:16:49] imagination we reduce God to our our our
[1:16:54] simple hero tots I'll tell you this is
[1:16:59] the Asian of data I'm talking about this
[1:17:02] is the creator of the universe I'm
[1:17:04] talking about this is the one that does
[1:17:09] thing and he does not have to answer to
[1:17:11] anybody
[1:17:11] I was talking to someone yesterday in
[1:17:16] the little counseling session praise the
[1:17:19] Lord and I was saying I was saying to
[1:17:24] this person I said you know our problem
[1:17:31] you know our problem when we when we
[1:17:35] look at the unit of Maharaja this is the
[1:17:40] way I said it to them trying to process
[1:17:41] my thought here I said God said in his
[1:17:45] word when he gave the Ten Commandments
[1:17:48] worship no other God besides me he said
[1:17:56] through the Sun David said you deserve
[1:17:59] all the praise he deserve all the praise
[1:18:04] do you know that in the scripture of God
[1:18:07] don't praise anybody if you can find one
[1:18:12] scripture in the Bible that shows where
[1:18:14] God praise a man all the praises goes to
[1:18:19] God he said in the prophet Isaiah my
[1:18:24] glory I was here with no man I'm telling
[1:18:30] you this God that we serve
[1:18:33] he said all sin to God he said all
[1:18:40] center and if you don't process it in
[1:18:42] your mind for it to drop in your Honda
[1:18:44] it's about God and all about God you
[1:18:47] will never be successful and I told this
[1:18:50] person I said look when it comes to the
[1:18:52] unit of marriage there is one person
[1:18:54] that wants to be satisfied that's God
[1:18:56] and we miss it we miss it we get so
[1:19:00] filled in our mind we want this we want
[1:19:03] our desire we want to be how one
[1:19:05] pressing that needs to be happened
[1:19:07] because marriage is all about God is the
[1:19:09] Institute it's God's Institute to
[1:19:12] reflect himself in the family that's why
[1:19:15] Paul taught us in the Bible there is one
[1:19:18] person that needs to be happy and if you
[1:19:21] make God happy you get a happy marriage
[1:19:25] praise the Lord
[1:19:26] amen and then we found the Holy Ghost a
[1:19:30] happy wife
[1:19:32] it's a happy home Amen with the Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost if you make God happy you will be
[1:19:37] happy because there is one person there
[1:19:40] is one person that we needs to hit and
[1:19:43] don't like that's the devil because he
[1:19:46] does not like marriage he does not like
[1:19:49] marriage he don't care what you think
[1:19:52] about it and what do you think about God
[1:19:54] that devil fights marriage because he
[1:19:57] knows that is the higher form of
[1:20:01] reflection that's the higher form of
[1:20:04] relationship that's the highest form of
[1:20:07] relationship and that is a relationship
[1:20:10] that God has choose through the New
[1:20:13] Testament church to reflect himself
[1:20:15] Christ it's like the husband the wife is
[1:20:18] like the church that's the purpose the
[1:20:21] Bible say for this purpose a man will
[1:20:24] leave his family what purpose is enough
[1:20:27] for flowers the purpose is for God to
[1:20:33] come down Genesis chapter
[1:20:38] one verse 20 says the Bible says that he
[1:20:40] made man in His image male and female
[1:20:43] when he made that image it was male and
[1:20:45] female Genesis chapter 2 he breaks out
[1:20:50] the female spirit he takes it in the
[1:20:53] back part of the out of the Garden of
[1:20:54] Eden and he made a woman tits he's
[1:20:58] separating and their marriage is where
[1:21:02] he brings both their feminist spirit and
[1:21:05] a masculine spirit back together to be
[1:21:09] able to reflect himself true make
[1:21:13] marriage all about Hollywood if you make
[1:21:17] God happy you have a happy home they
[1:21:21] want to change your husband make God
[1:21:22] happy praise the Lord it mean you want
[1:21:27] to change your wife just make God happy
[1:21:29] but you see the thing about it there is
[1:21:31] that it is to to like like someone said
[1:21:36] to selfish person I want her to make me
[1:21:41] happen she want me to make him happen
[1:21:44] and we get all in that struggle and
[1:21:46] don't even look up to this person I said
[1:21:49] when you do that you want to be happy
[1:21:53] when you get happy
[1:21:54] go get sign go get so sad because you
[1:22:00] are missing the purpose or what am i
[1:22:02] preaching on marriage I'm gonna go back
[1:22:05] to my subject that comforter is here man
[1:22:08] I gotta get back the comforter this year
[1:22:11] that's what I'm preaching on don't
[1:22:13] change the subject sister faith amen
[1:22:19] let's get back to this my goodness it's
[1:22:25] this is a all center God is the center
[1:22:29] of everything it's the center when we
[1:22:33] make our doctoring the center of our
[1:22:35] church you lost the whole thing he is
[1:22:38] the center
[1:22:44] praise annoy oh my can you think about
[1:22:51] that what a way that the father would
[1:22:55] comfort us he says in this comforter he
[1:22:59] might have died with you even the Spirit
[1:23:02] of Truth even the Spirit of Truth you
[1:23:08] think about it have you ever going to
[1:23:10] comfort someone and says let me tell
[1:23:13] them the truth
[1:23:17] it's hard you know even if there is
[1:23:20] something that you thought that shoe
[1:23:22] have done not to get in that situation
[1:23:24] but because you want to be on a good
[1:23:26] Frank no that's not the time to talk
[1:23:28] about that but that's not God when he
[1:23:31] comes to comfort you he tells you the
[1:23:34] truth he rebuke you in your state that's
[1:23:38] why he did to David Nathan came right to
[1:23:41] David and said you are the man David but
[1:23:46] he was the comforter in David's house
[1:23:49] there is oh my goodness because you know
[1:23:52] he I've just said that the man I've done
[1:23:54] this must die but NATO said you will not
[1:23:58] die what a comfort telling him that he
[1:24:01] was the man but yet there is mercy for
[1:24:04] you that's why the comforter does the
[1:24:11] Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:24:18] receive going go and comfort somebody
[1:24:23] and start to tell them the truth
[1:24:26] you shouldn't have lived that way you
[1:24:27] yourself get yourself in this situation
[1:24:29] they get angry right away the Spirit of
[1:24:31] Truth can out the word can I receive it
[1:24:35] the word can not receive it
[1:24:44] I'm telling I'm going to go in a
[1:24:46] direction with this subject you might
[1:24:48] you might you might kick me you know out
[1:24:52] of the lace of preachers I'm not even
[1:24:55] one praise the Lord the word can I
[1:25:00] receive it because I feared him net but
[1:25:05] Brenham right in the same message he
[1:25:07] went over that verse and he says
[1:25:10] understand him that he used that words
[1:25:12] he said look in the Greek it means it's
[1:25:14] a understand whom that neither knoweth
[1:25:17] him neither knoweth him that's where I'm
[1:25:20] to this morning nor the Holy Ghost nor
[1:25:24] the Holy Ghost asked your comforter he
[1:25:27] comes as your friend
[1:25:31] more the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:36] not at that spirit that is following you
[1:25:38] and ready to slap you for everything
[1:25:40] that you does nor the Holy Ghost nor in
[1:25:43] the spirit of truth we get our minds so
[1:25:49] filled with doctrine brother Branham
[1:25:51] said the Holy Ghost is dangerous but I
[1:25:52] was talking with some other young people
[1:25:53] and it took that little story from the
[1:25:55] lineman and a dog and you know we just
[1:25:58] talked about it and we laugh about it a
[1:25:59] little bit you know and it sister
[1:26:01] you know Bertram says it's just you know
[1:26:03] everyone says the Holy Ghost
[1:26:04] it's just it's just like a dope when we
[1:26:06] offend it it flies away but we say
[1:26:10] beautiful that's just beautiful
[1:26:12] but brother Branham was giving us a
[1:26:15] story the Holy Ghost is not a bird it's
[1:26:18] not a bird it's not a bird the scripture
[1:26:25] says God spoke to two John and says the
[1:26:33] one you see the spirit descending on
[1:26:35] like like that's why the scripture says
[1:26:41] even on the days of Pentecost there were
[1:26:44] proving Thrones upon your head like like
[1:26:50] and if we don't wash those things in the
[1:26:52] scripture people say when you feed the
[1:26:54] whole ago.we
[1:26:55] cuz it's a fire in my brain you know
[1:27:02] like praise the Lord you know why God
[1:27:07] type dad like a dog is because when he
[1:27:11] sent his when he sent the dog out in the
[1:27:14] in and from the ark to go and find a
[1:27:18] place you know what
[1:27:19] when we find Elena and never return back
[1:27:26] God was connecting that the Covenant of
[1:27:30] the rainbow where he says I will not
[1:27:35] destroy this word any more with water he
[1:27:38] was connecting that covenant of the
[1:27:40] rainbow that covenant with Noah
[1:27:42] right on the river Jordan he was trying
[1:27:45] to show us the breath of the earth then
[1:27:49] it was water he is going to be blocked
[1:27:53] so the same dog has to come back again
[1:27:57] the Holy Ghost in the full light and
[1:27:59] Dorf it's not a bird you do something
[1:28:07] heard of going and going flying on the
[1:28:08] tree and then when you set up a garden a
[1:28:12] flower back again but Ben was just
[1:28:13] giving us an idea how when we grieve the
[1:28:18] Holy Ghost he step back because he can
[1:28:20] you know work on your will when you
[1:28:23] surround on your will to him he steps in
[1:28:27] when you close your will to him he steps
[1:28:30] back he don't go anywhere he's right
[1:28:31] there but you are not giving him the
[1:28:37] right to work through you and we get all
[1:28:43] this opinions then the Holy Ghost fly
[1:28:45] away on the tree talk let me go let me
[1:28:46] just go with this because I'm shouldn't
[1:28:50] be out of time here norine nor in him
[1:28:55] nor in him the Spirit of Truth but you
[1:28:59] know him that's why Jesus says the word
[1:29:01] don't know him but you know him you know
[1:29:04] him for
[1:29:08] he dwelleth with you in Jesus and shall
[1:29:15] be in you he dwelleth with you that's
[1:29:21] why he used that word and not a
[1:29:22] comforter because his presence with him
[1:29:25] his ministry was a comfort unto them but
[1:29:29] now the comforter is going to come and
[1:29:31] do it in us do we say halftime for
[1:29:41] Jordan and know what the time is
[1:29:44] okay yeah it's almost 12 Teddy amen
[1:29:48] praise the Lord amen you know I was
[1:29:55] thinking about this this morning just
[1:29:57] funny and sometimes I'd be talking to
[1:30:02] myself as I'm driving I was thinking
[1:30:04] about this this morning and I says you
[1:30:06] know when a preacher starts to preach a
[1:30:09] series a series he's telling you I'm
[1:30:14] getting a hold of my poopit I'm not
[1:30:16] letting it go
[1:30:18] so part 1 by 2 by 3 by 4 by 5 verses
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:35] praise the Lord you love the Lord this
[1:30:37] morning
[1:30:38] amen amen amen I'm trying to bring this
[1:30:42] thing to us trying to bring this thing
[1:30:45] to us let's look here
[1:30:47] verse 26 chapter 14 verse 26 let's just
[1:30:52] run through this entire bar BAM said we
[1:30:54] should use this this in John chapter 14
[1:30:57] as a base for what the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:01] giving for he's giving for us to know
[1:31:04] him the Spirit of Truth
[1:31:08] verse 26 what does he say here but the
[1:31:12] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:31:15] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:31:20] teach you
[1:31:22] all things if you are not learning you
[1:31:25] don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:31:28] is there to teach you he's there to
[1:31:32] teach you to teach you he's there to
[1:31:40] take the messages that I preached to you
[1:31:42] to teach you he's there when you are
[1:31:44] reading your Bible he's there to teach
[1:31:46] you to help you understand what you are
[1:31:48] reading that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:51] giving for if we don't know these things
[1:31:57] we don't grow in the Lord and we just
[1:31:59] make the Holy Ghost and a fine dress on
[1:32:02] Sunday I mean that's how we get all of
[1:32:08] these like like a brother said this he
[1:32:11] says we get all of these message uncle's
[1:32:13] a message auntie's they just come and
[1:32:16] take their place that just relax they
[1:32:18] know they're there in the message the
[1:32:20] moment I can find out Spears in church
[1:32:22] they're not reading their Bible they're
[1:32:25] not even going back to look at their
[1:32:27] notes and so what the Holy Ghost been
[1:32:28] been dealing with us this month what
[1:32:32] he's been speaking to us know all of
[1:32:34] these messages that are coming why are
[1:32:36] you saying these things to us what you
[1:32:38] want to achieve we're not taking the
[1:32:41] world we're not learning the purpose of
[1:32:44] the Holy Ghost is to teach us because
[1:32:46] it's written in the Book of Isaiah that
[1:32:49] all his children will be taught by him
[1:32:55] will be taught by him when you have you
[1:32:58] when you have this experience where God
[1:33:00] is teaching you in a word then all you
[1:33:03] can love your pastor but if your
[1:33:05] favorite preacher is the Holy Ghost
[1:33:08] because you know after your pastor has
[1:33:10] preached and you look at your notes and
[1:33:12] you read the scripture that have been
[1:33:14] preached you go back and play the tapes
[1:33:16] that I've been listening to you know the
[1:33:18] Holy Ghost would be there something
[1:33:21] would be saying you pass it he said this
[1:33:23] okay let me really look in the scripture
[1:33:25] the Holy Ghost is there to teach us
[1:33:33] it's not to make you an auntie he want
[1:33:39] to be an auntie to the holy ghost uncle
[1:33:43] to the Holy Ghost no he's there to teach
[1:33:46] us and what I'm going for this but I'm
[1:33:49] grinning way he shall teach you all
[1:33:52] things and bring all things to your
[1:33:57] remembrance and bring all things to your
[1:34:02] remembrance he reminds us he reminds us
[1:34:14] it's when we get into that quiet time
[1:34:17] with the Lord and you are meditating
[1:34:20] lord over and over I've seen there I've
[1:34:27] seen there because the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:28] real
[1:34:29] sometimes I will be steady in the night
[1:34:31] and something would come to my mind I
[1:34:33] say Lord I know I saw it in the world
[1:34:35] I know okay yeah maybe it's in the
[1:34:37] scripture I go and look for maybe it's
[1:34:39] in this message I go and check for it I
[1:34:40] would just I just hold my table and say
[1:34:45] dear Lord you know what my heart is
[1:34:47] looking for I just committed to him
[1:34:50] you come around some way he will show it
[1:34:54] to me he will come around some way and
[1:35:00] he will show it to me you reading
[1:35:03] something in the Bible and you don't
[1:35:05] understand it stop it pray go to your
[1:35:09] teacher that's why it goes to them we do
[1:35:12] that's what a good student will do if
[1:35:15] you don't understand it you go to your
[1:35:17] teacher and say lord i just pray father
[1:35:22] I didn't understand the scripture
[1:35:25] falling and all stroking something yeah
[1:35:27] I don't understand it fully because I
[1:35:29] mean if you are not cut you're not
[1:35:30] called to preach God is not going to
[1:35:32] deal with you like a preacher and give
[1:35:34] you all the explanation but because you
[1:35:37] are his son in his daughter he would
[1:35:39] take that scripture just won't work from
[1:35:42] there it will be able to address
[1:35:44] something in your in your life or it
[1:35:46] will be able to
[1:35:46] make a picture that you can be able to
[1:35:49] understand he's there to teach us he's
[1:35:56] there to bring back to our remembrance
[1:35:58] and that is the way that God DS
[1:36:01] sometimes with with with with with
[1:36:05] prodigal sons and and and and you see
[1:36:07] when the prodigal son came back to the
[1:36:10] father you know the father never show
[1:36:13] him his fault you know father put her
[1:36:17] arm around him and say you remember this
[1:36:19] well you remember this little tree you
[1:36:22] remember you planted this tree that's
[1:36:25] why the Holy Ghost does it remind us
[1:36:27] when God wants to deal with you he
[1:36:30] reminds you you remember this service
[1:36:32] you remember what you know you remember
[1:36:34] this time when I deal with your heart
[1:36:36] you remember what happened here he
[1:36:38] reminds you he reminds you so you can
[1:36:42] trust him so you can come more closer to
[1:36:44] him that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:36:56] young people if you're not reading your
[1:36:58] Bible if you're not learning you're not
[1:37:00] even trying yourself to memorize
[1:37:02] Scripture that's the way you provoke the
[1:37:04] Holy Ghost
[1:37:19] bring to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:37:21] have said unto you praise the Lord
[1:37:25] he's there to remind us chapter 15
[1:37:32] let's go to chapter 15 year quickly I

[1:38:29] ye have been with me from the beginning

[1:38:54] reading from verse 7 I mean I'm not just
[1:38:57] reading in clothes I mean there are just
[1:38:59] a lot of things to you that we can go
[1:39:01] through but you know that is that is the
[1:39:04] beginning of this book we went there we
[1:39:06] will not appreciate the book of Acts
[1:39:08] until we appreciate the birth to realize
[1:39:13] that God brought the both church the
[1:39:19] Jewish Church and the Gentile church
[1:39:21] into the feasts of the Pentecost the
[1:39:24] time he will choose to send his spirit
[1:39:26] to dwell in the heart of man will be
[1:39:29] Pentecost
[1:39:32] you know what Pentecost represent
[1:39:35] Jubilee you are free he that his son has
[1:39:39] set free it's free in day the Holy Ghost
[1:39:42] come to set you free to make you free of
[1:39:45] yourself oh my goodness
[1:39:48] free of yourself praise the Lord
[1:39:51] amen no my little sisters write me back
[1:39:59] home in it they ask me how you doing you
[1:40:01] know how everything goin asses I mean
[1:40:03] everything going on by the grace of God
[1:40:04] and when a problem ahah is to stay 6
[1:40:07] feet away for myself how can you do that
[1:40:11] what do you mean be brother that's my
[1:40:14] problem but that's why the Holy Ghost
[1:40:16] can to give you 6 feet from yourself
[1:40:27] praise the Lord it's a good thing to
[1:40:31] stay that way a little bit from this guy
[1:40:34] you mean you know because that's I mean
[1:40:38] that's how Paul identified this flesh he
[1:40:43] brought this flesh to the place of one
[1:40:46] of the greatest Roman punishment it was
[1:40:54] when the room with the Romans would take
[1:40:57] a dead body and tie to a man process or
[1:41:04] wretched man that I am who would deliver
[1:41:07] me praise the Lord
[1:41:12] but you know when you can come to the
[1:41:14] place to realize that this guy hanging
[1:41:16] on you he's dead you don't have no life
[1:41:20] in it you don't have to look at his
[1:41:21] tongue outside to be afraid you don't
[1:41:24] have to look at his eyes he's dead tell
[1:41:26] yourself he's dead he's dead he can hang
[1:41:30] on as far as he wants to hang on you I
[1:41:33] did know you are dead
[1:41:36] the only problem you giving me is just a
[1:41:39] little weight but you are dead
[1:41:43] but when a man cannot it will kill you
[1:41:56] before your time yes she are you okay
[1:42:02] I did okay let's read from verse seven
[1:42:08] year praise the Lord
[1:42:11] amen st. John chapter 16 verse 7
[1:42:17] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[1:42:21] expedient for you that go away this was
[1:42:26] the scripture that kind of one hit me
[1:42:27] how can God comfort us by taking the one
[1:42:33] that we love he comfort us by taking the
[1:42:36] things that we love in our life the
[1:42:41] habits we love when Holy Ghost come he
[1:42:45] comes to comfort you he takes those
[1:42:47] habit away and sometimes that's what
[1:42:54] make people are afraid of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:55] they don't want to lose it because they
[1:42:58] have made those habit their
[1:42:59] identification you know I'm a short
[1:43:03] temper God so they don't want to lose
[1:43:06] that short temper Ness because whenever
[1:43:10] they draw into it it can it can just
[1:43:13] make them who they are when the Holy
[1:43:15] Ghost come you want to take that short
[1:43:17] temper and just make it long a little
[1:43:19] bit by giving you patience woo it is a
[1:43:28] speeding for you that I go away for if I
[1:43:33] go not away the comforter will not come
[1:43:36] unto you the comforter will not come
[1:43:42] unto you that's what sometimes when
[1:43:46] these things happen to our dear loved
[1:43:49] ones it's good to look and see what God
[1:43:52] is doing as much as it hurt us in
[1:43:54] Hindman there is
[1:43:56] know where we can process it there was
[1:43:58] just no way no way there is not a word
[1:44:00] somebody who said to you I'm just
[1:44:02] thinking about it this morning I can't
[1:44:04] just and just imagine for the Iroquois
[1:44:06] fan and the children you know and I was
[1:44:08] just there's just no way somebody can
[1:44:10] say in it you know when there was no
[1:44:11] word but when you think about it this
[1:44:21] way that God is going to step into that
[1:44:27] situation you don't know how he's going
[1:44:31] to take you but he's ready to hold your
[1:44:33] hands and take you to another level in
[1:44:36] your life that you had never experienced
[1:44:40] as long as he was there it is only God I
[1:44:47] can't comfort he's the truth comforter
[1:44:53] praise the Lord
[1:44:57] ever seen those people that comes to
[1:44:59] comfort you and it just makes you feel
[1:45:01] sorrowful you're trying to get over the
[1:45:05] sorrow you just did I mean singing a
[1:45:09] song and if they come around just and
[1:45:12] they just roll you right back into the
[1:45:16] sound again
[1:45:16] God is not like that I would comfort
[1:45:19] that it's not like that they can't take
[1:45:23] you to another level he comes to open
[1:45:29] the coaching he says look at the
[1:45:32] sunshine let's go beyond the Sun let's
[1:45:37] go beyond the more he starts to think
[1:45:40] there's a land beyond the river oh my
[1:45:44] goodness me that's a land beyond the
[1:45:47] river that we call sweet forever
[1:45:56] you
[1:46:04] but if I depart I will send him unto you
[1:46:07] verse 8 and when he is come he will
[1:46:13] reprove the world of sin and of
[1:46:18] righteousness and of judgment of sin
[1:46:22] because they believe not a mean of
[1:46:26] righteousness because I go to my father
[1:46:29] and you see me no more of judgment
[1:46:33] because the prince of this world is
[1:46:38] George I could take those three things
[1:46:42] and just go into something this morning
[1:46:46] and show how beautiful the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:50] with us
[1:46:52] you know it is with us here immoral bear
[1:46:55] talks about he talks about sin self and
[1:46:58] Satan the three s sin self in the devil
[1:47:03] I could just go into that but I would
[1:47:07] live there for another time amen
[1:47:10] he says I have had many things to say
[1:47:14] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[1:47:17] you will not be able to bed him you
[1:47:20] think about this is a sorrowful moment
[1:47:22] Jesus telling these people that have
[1:47:25] been comforted by their by his presence
[1:47:27] he's telling them I'm about to leave you
[1:47:32] I'm about to leave what is good for me
[1:47:36] to leave because if not you will not
[1:47:42] move on in your walk with God sometimes
[1:47:46] that's what God takes his man where he
[1:47:49] takes the profit away he takes you know
[1:47:52] his messengers away because he want his
[1:47:54] people to move on and keep their eyes on
[1:48:00] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:48:04] howbeit when he the spirit of truth is
[1:48:07] come he will guide you into all truth
[1:48:14] do you know that God fulfilled it divers
[1:48:18] in a ministry to brother branham he was
[1:48:23] napped the Spirit of Truth his ministry
[1:48:27] was the Spirit of Truth that guided us
[1:48:32] he guided us to the truth understanding
[1:48:36] of the word that's why he preached a
[1:48:42] message the guide when he preached a
[1:48:44] message to guy let me say this to you
[1:48:46] read a message to comforter better
[1:48:49] better I'm coming to preach the message
[1:48:50] the comforter after his mother passed
[1:48:53] away and he's preaching this message and
[1:48:56] he's showing to us how God comfort him
[1:48:59] knowing that his mom who passed away and
[1:49:02] God and not give him a vision but what
[1:49:06] God would do to come for him is to give
[1:49:10] him a vision not a vision about his
[1:49:14] mother but a vision about that they're
[1:49:17] both with their length of home was it 42
[1:49:20] inches you know the exact measure when
[1:49:25] he preached a message comforter that's
[1:49:27] why he tells us that God led him into
[1:49:31] the experience to give him exact
[1:49:33] measurement of the whole of the ball
[1:49:36] that he would kill as a comfort that I'm
[1:49:41] with you to every inch of the way but
[1:49:44] here God will not show him a dream about
[1:49:47] his mother going away
[1:49:48] that's how God comforted that's why he
[1:49:54] comfort he comforts you in his word the
[1:49:57] Word of God is our comfort he comforts
[1:50:01] you with his presence I will never leave
[1:50:03] you never forsake you you don't give you
[1:50:08] a brand new car as a comfort because he
[1:50:13] knows as soon as you drive away from the
[1:50:15] parking lot a lost value
[1:50:22] you don't even give you a home as a
[1:50:24] comfort or as you have given John about
[1:50:27] this one girl called for his people in
[1:50:32] his word and by his spirit and I reduced
[1:50:37] God to houses and cars and shoes and
[1:50:40] suits the Spirit of Truth has come he
[1:50:48] will guide you into all truth into all
[1:50:54] truth the truth is not the man the truth
[1:50:57] is the message it's a ministry it's a
[1:51:00] Bible you keep your eyes on the man you
[1:51:07] see something with his life you would
[1:51:08] get trouble for for he shall not speak
[1:51:11] of himself and why we want to make
[1:51:16] brother branham everything if he had a
[1:51:19] ministry of the spirit of truth it's not
[1:51:22] about him it's about Christ it's about
[1:51:26] word Elias I was not talking about
[1:51:28] himself and he is I was talking about
[1:51:30] Isaac and everything that Rebecca knew
[1:51:37] about Isaac came from Eliezer because
[1:51:40] that man was in the house when Sarah was
