[37:03] this morning we will before we we uh uh
[37:07] change the order of the service for
[37:10] preaching, we would just want to do
[37:13] something a little bit different,
[37:15] something in the light of missions. And
[37:19] uh uh we've been having u a friend and a
[37:23] brother. Uh uh I think we spoke a little
[37:27] bit about him the last time.
[37:30] uh
[37:31] uh he came over from Seville to visit
[37:35] with his brother back here and then uh I
[37:39] came one uh one day in the week uh came
[37:43] from work and just came through the
[37:44] church and you know and they stopped by
[37:47] and uh wanted to make me know that he
[37:49] will be here on Sunday for service and
[37:51] it turned out that uh since he came once
[37:54] it looks like he just became a part.
[37:57] Amen. Amen.
[37:59] and uh uh
[38:02] and and we we have had series of little
[38:06] talk here and there you know and uh uh
[38:09] and also trying to understand what he's
[38:12] doing there the you know the little work
[38:14] that he's doing there in
[38:17] Seville and uh
[38:21] uh so uh he's he's will be traveling
[38:25] back the end of this month and So uh I
[38:29] just ask him that I would give him few
[38:32] minutes of my time this morning just to
[38:35] once again share with us what he's
[38:37] doing. And uh uh I remember one time we
[38:41] were talking and he told me uh that
[38:45] uh uh this is not out of flattery. But
[38:49] uh you know if if uh if I never find
[38:53] that uh your church here was world based
[38:56] I wouldn't have returned back the second
[38:59] time. And I enjoy the word I enjoy the
[39:02] fellowship. So this is just uh like home
[39:05] to me
[39:07] and uh uh uh so I told him that I like I
[39:13] said I give him just few minutes of my
[39:15] time this morning and uh uh and then he
[39:19] will share with us uh a little of what
[39:22] they are doing there in civil he's in a
[39:25] part of the country close to the
[39:28] republic of
[39:29] Guinea and uh is uh is a is a
[39:34] predominant Muslim area. So uh uh you
[39:39] can you can you if you have ever live in
[39:41] a predominant Muslim area or ever travel
[39:44] there for mission you know what it is.
[39:47] Uh I remember uh 2004 or five I went to
[39:52] the nothing part of Nigeria.
[39:55] uh was to have some meetings there and
[39:58] they had just come out of a religious
[40:01] clash. It was a religious war in the
[40:04] city. They have just come out of it and
[40:07] and you could still feel you could feel
[40:12] the tension in the air. The city was
[40:14] split in two and you could feel that. So
[40:17] if you if you ever live or work in a
[40:21] Muslim dominated area, you will know
[40:24] exactly what it is. So uh uh so
[40:29] uh so Reverend B, you come up and uh
[40:35] uh just
[40:37] take your liberty to share with us a few
[40:40] this
[40:44] morning. Thank you. Thank you.
[40:52] Hallelujah.
[40:54] Are we blessed this morning?
[40:55] Shall we give the Lord offering this
[40:58] morning?

[42:18] together we walk father as kingdom
[42:20] builders thank you king of glory for in
[42:23] Jesus name we pray
[42:26] amen for those of that we are not here
[42:28] when I introduce myself. I am brother
[42:32] Augustine Samur founder and general via
[42:35] of the globe mission network
[42:39] international. Um when the Lord called
[42:42] me in
[42:44] 2004 he said go to a place called Kambia
[42:47] and start my work. I was in
[42:51] Kono the diamond mining place and I was
[42:53] working for an organization called peace
[42:56] in Japan as their
[42:58] engineer. I was never dreaming of
[43:00] becoming a
[43:01] pastor you know but the Lord said
[43:05] go but I I talked with my wife said
[43:08] you're not a pastor how can you go and
[43:10] hear the ministry as a study force.
[43:14] Okay. A year later to that I enrolled in
[43:17] the college to count it all. I got a
[43:21] diploma and then later a degree in
[43:24] Christian
[43:25] leadership and a master's in Christian
[43:28] education just to equip myself. Then in
[43:31] 2014 finally the ministry was launched
[43:34] in Cambia. Went to Cambia but it was
[43:36] very very difficult
[43:38] because my wife coming from a typical
[43:41] Muslim background the father never
[43:43] wanted us to go to
[43:44] Cambia that Cambia is the Muslim
[43:46] dominated place. Kambia is this. Cambia
[43:48] is that. It's a difficult
[43:51] place. But I remember what the Lord said
[43:54] to Ezekiel in the book of Ezekiel 2. He
[43:57] said I'm sending you. He says, "Rise up.
[44:00] Stand up and let me talk with you. I'm
[44:02] sending you to a stiff necked people, a
[44:05] rebellious
[44:07] people." He said, "Be not afraid of
[44:11] them." He said, "But do not be like
[44:14] them." Know those two words. Do not be
[44:17] like them. Do not be afraid. And I
[44:20] remember Jimmy Elliot is American who
[44:24] went to
[44:25] IU to preach the message of the gospel
[44:28] of Jesus together with his four friends
[44:31] and they were
[44:34] killed. But it didn't stop there.
[44:37] Elizabeth Elliot and the other women
[44:39] they finally went to the same place
[44:42] where their husbands were killed.
[44:45] And so I said to my wife, if the Lord
[44:48] has said, we must go. If we are going to
[44:50] die, let's all go to die. Don't go there
[44:52] and die for the gospel sake. I said,
[44:55] this is a complete testimony about a man
[44:57] who went with his friends. They were
[44:59] killed. The president of the United
[45:01] State, United States of America, they
[45:03] didn't send jets there to
[45:05] bombard. But the lady, Elizabeth, stood
[45:09] firm. I told her, "Okay, I will go
[45:11] first. Then you come later. If I'm
[45:14] killed then you will come later. But by
[45:17] the grace of God we are there and we are
[45:19] doing our own little bit.
[45:21] Amen. Today by the special grace of God
[45:24] we have 12 branches plus the central
[45:26] church which makes it 13 and we are
[45:29] grateful unto
[45:31] God. But let me tell you brothers and
[45:33] sisters, Kambia district bordering the
[45:35] Republic of Guinea and Cambia being the
[45:38] very first place wherein the Quran was
[45:42] first open and the first Islamic
[45:44] university was first
[45:46] established happened to be a very very
[45:49] strong
[45:50] Muslim town or district.
[45:54] And we have uh the sus and the
[45:58] Timnes. These are predominantly Muslim
[46:02] ethnic
[46:05] tribes. I've been attacked. My church
[46:07] has been put down three
[46:09] times. The third time now the government
[46:13] intervene so no this time you are going
[46:16] to build this
[46:18] church. But by the grace of God we never
[46:21] retaliated.
[46:24] the integers council, the PFSL and all
[46:27] Christian organizations, all religious
[46:29] bodies rose up and they say we must go
[46:31] to court. I said no, I came here for
[46:33] these people. If I should take them to
[46:36] court, how am I going to win them over
[46:38] to the
[46:39] Lord? Some were angry with me, but I
[46:42] stood my ground. And because I stood my
[46:45] ground today, we are making headway. But
[46:48] that one thing with the
[46:49] sus the sooner a suzu gives his or her
[46:53] life to Jesus Christ is being abandoned.
[46:56] They disown him or her and the
[46:58] responsibility of the burden comes upon
[47:00] the
[47:03] church. And so today we are burdened
[47:07] with a lot of responsibility as a church
[47:10] as a
[47:11] ministry. But as the Lord said, I was
[47:14] hungry and you fed me.
[47:18] I was naked you cloth me homeless and
[47:21] you opened
[47:23] up by the grace of God we just as a
[47:26] ministry let us embark on two and that's
[47:28] the area of feeding and
[47:31] clothing and if you can see oh I thought
[47:36] we were going to present it
[47:38] all right okay all
[47:41] right you know we have five missionaries
[47:45] that you have sent we Every two years we
[47:48] send five mission missionaries to the
[47:49] field to make sure they reach out to
[47:52] these
[47:53] people. And we have encouraged our
[47:56] congregation
[47:57] to get used
[48:00] clothing. Every two or three months we
[48:03] gather used clothing and then we go to
[48:05] the communities because these people
[48:07] have been disowned. And so if we don't
[48:11] take care of them, they will go back. Of
[48:15] course they will go back. One thing I'm
[48:18] grateful to
[48:20] God is that people are very much
[48:24] zillious. So zillious as you can see
[48:27] from some of the pictures there recently
[48:31] about a week ago they did that. So when
[48:35] pastor asked me that I will
[48:38] be giving a talk on what we are doing in
[48:42] that part of the
[48:43] vineyard. I stood a call headquarter. I
[48:47] said oh I've been given an assignment to
[48:50] talk to my beautiful people my brother
[48:53] and sisters that the Lord has led me to
[48:56] fellowship with them. And I said but I
[48:58] have learned things that I've never
[49:00] learned before.
[49:03] But one but two of them that I I'm going
[49:05] to embark on or talk a little bit about
[49:08] is about
[49:10] understanding the book of Esther and the
[49:13] book of
[49:17] Ruth. That the book of Esther talks
[49:19] about the redemption of the Jews whereas
[49:24] the book of Ruth talks about the
[49:26] redemption of the gentile.
[49:30] So I remember the scripture says I have
[49:32] another
[49:33] flock and I will bring the flock and
[49:36] they become one flock and we have one
[49:39] shepherd. I said wow. So
[49:43] meaning the Lord brought me to the
[49:45] United States of America, Minnesota to
[49:47] be to be precise in the shepherd and
[49:51] good shepherd fellowship to understand
[49:54] the the the significant and important of
[49:58] these two books. Learn emphasis on two
[50:01] books that talks about
[50:03] women. And so I want to challenge you my
[50:08] sisters that the ministration of the
[50:10] gospel of Jesus Christ lies upon you.
[50:14] That God is looking upon the women. And
[50:15] that's the reason why I'm not surprised
[50:18] to see that in all of the fellowship
[50:19] that I've been and even my own women
[50:23] takes the
[50:24] lead. Women are always in a greater
[50:27] number. So I started imagining I say
[50:30] okay this is what I have learned. And
[50:32] then the next thing is about the
[50:35] law. How come about the law? The people
[50:38] said to Moses, "We will do all that the
[50:42] Lord has said." Is it
[50:46] possible? And my pastor was saying this
[50:50] is as a
[50:51] result of the ten commandment coming on
[50:54] board. I said,
[50:56] "Wow." So meaning we needed just to
[51:00] believe and depend on God. relying on
[51:03] God on God's
[51:05] love as he takes us from one state to
[51:08] another from glory to
[51:09] glory and so man by himself cannot save
[51:13] himself and so the ten commandment was
[51:16] like a test all right since you have
[51:18] said this now let me give you let me say
[51:20] who we obey it thank God for the grace
[51:23] of God that Jesus has to come hallelujah
[51:26] and only give us loving God with all
[51:28] your heart all your mind all your soul
[51:30] and all your strength and to love your
[51:32] neighbor as yourself and that is
[51:35] great. I said wow indeed God you have
[51:39] not brought me here for nothing and I'm
[51:41] taking this home by the grace of
[51:44] God. Today we have as I said earlier we
[51:47] have 12 uh branches plus the headquarter
[51:50] 13 and we are doing great by the special
[51:53] grace of God and
[51:55] today people are coming to us asking us
[51:59] how did you make it? How did you manage
[52:01] to make it? It's just about yielding
[52:03] yourself to the voice of God. Total
[52:07] surrening. And I told pastor that I'm
[52:11] home. I didn't regret my being here
[52:14] because the pastor that trained me that
[52:16] brought me up
[52:18] Barabil his ministry was like
[52:22] this. But one thing that is clear is
[52:24] Barabil told me one day
[52:28] say today you an engineer, you get the
[52:31] money. He said, but do you know that
[52:34] when God call you, I
[52:37] laughed, but today I want to thank
[52:40] God. I'm not having those
[52:42] cars. I don't have those houses that I
[52:45] was dreaming about, but I have one thing
[52:49] that is greater than all, and that is
[52:52] Jesus.
[52:53] Amen. Amen. It was not easy for me to
[52:56] let go of all those
[52:58] things to embark on the gospel. I had
[53:02] challenges with my wife the relatives.
[53:06] But today if you tell my wife go back to
[53:09] B where she come from she say she fight
[53:13] you because today the things that God is
[53:15] doing in her life as she's older than me
[53:18] in ministry. I'm not talking about age.
[53:20] She's older than me in ministry. She's
[53:22] four years older than in
[53:24] ministry. And that's the beautiful
[53:26] things about men. We
[53:30] bully women. We bully
[53:33] women. But she is older than me. She
[53:37] encouraged me. And that's the reason why
[53:39] I was always hesitant in boasting about
[53:41] her very first day. When I talk about
[53:44] beautiful, I'm not talking about a face.
[53:47] I'm talking about woman that is
[53:48] supportive. I'm talking about woman that
[53:51] dreams to your dream that has the same
[53:54] vision. A woman that discovers to
[53:57] recover that what I'm talking about.
[53:59] That's why I say maybe by face she's the
[54:02] most
[54:04] ugly. Oh, you said no. Okay. Thank you.
[54:08] All right. All right. No, it's just a
[54:10] joke. Right.
[54:13] So,
[54:14] but I want to thank God for Bora for
[54:17] Bora one. You know, he reminded me about
[54:22] the New Testament. We we call oursel
[54:24] brothers. We have no reverend. We have
[54:26] no pastors. It's all about brothers and
[54:28] sisters. So, when I came again, I forgot
[54:30] about the Reverend. I'm no more Reverend
[54:33] Samuel Banks. I'm brother Augustine
[54:36] Samuel Banks. Just call me that. Amen.
[54:38] So, I want to thank you all. I'll be
[54:40] leaving here on the 23rd of this month
[54:43] going to Virginia and then from there
[54:47] I'll be going to Africa. But let me tell
[54:49] you this, the place where we are is not
[54:52] an easy place. So I want you to remember
[54:54] us in prayers. Support us in whatever
[54:57] way. But we need more of your prayers.
[55:00] So God will give us more grace to
[55:02] penetrate there because one day the
[55:06] trumpet will
[55:08] sound and the dead in Christ shall be
[55:12] raised. Millions are dying today and
[55:15] going to Christ this eternity. The song
[55:17] letter says who will go and show them
[55:18] the way. Say my house is full but my
[55:22] field is
[55:23] empty. We are all seated here. We want
[55:26] the comfortable places where the air
[55:28] conditions are to us there. We don't
[55:31] have we are fighting with the
[55:33] mosquitoes battling with them with
[55:35] sickness and diseases but we are
[55:38] pressing
[55:39] on. We are pressing
[55:41] on. Some said though the cloud may for a
[55:44] moment hide his face. He said but
[55:46] remember God is on the other side of it.
[55:49] Just keep pressing on. We'll continue to
[55:52] press on. God bless you.
[55:59] Thank
[56:03] you. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[56:07] You know, when I when I started
[56:09] preaching
[56:10] back
[56:12] 1993 and
[56:14] uh uh it was not really out of a church.
[56:19] It was just on the street corner going
[56:22] to the
[56:23] hospital.
[56:25] So working in rural areas and working on
[56:28] a difficult condition
[56:30] uh make us what we are today. So uh
[56:35] uh you know some of some has been
[56:38] blessed to grow up right in the message
[56:42] church and enjoy you know all the
[56:47] blessing of the five for ministry and
[56:50] hear
[56:51] testimonies. Uh uh but they are they God
[56:56] still has a people out there. You know
[56:58] brother Brandham says they are
[56:59] missionaries that don't have shoes on
[57:01] their feet. And if it's a quote, it is
[57:04] still truth
[57:06] today. It's still truth today. Praise
[57:09] the Lord. Amen. I mean, uh uh uh we we
[57:14] we don't want to imagine it that in such
[57:17] a time, in such an age, you know, that
[57:20] would be. But uh uh I love missionary
[57:23] work. If God can give you a pastor one
[57:26] day, I'll go back to the
[57:29] field. I love missionary work. So thank
[57:32] you. Thank you, brother Gustin. We we
[57:34] enjoyed that. Amen. And uh we enjoyed
[57:37] that. And definitely we will always
[57:39] remember what you are doing and we will
[57:42] keep you in our prayers. Praise the
[57:44] Lord. Let's stand on our feet and we
[57:46] will sing something and just change the
[57:48] order of the

[1:05:12] said. Something of internal value will
[1:05:15] be said. Something to draw us closer.
[1:05:19] Something oh God to change our lives.
[1:05:21] Something to affect us Lord. Something
[1:05:23] oh God father Lord God to make us a
[1:05:27] better Christian Lord. to make us,
[1:05:29] Father God, Lord, better husbands to our
[1:05:33] wives, better wives to our husband,
[1:05:36] better children to our parents, Lord,
[1:05:38] and better parents to our children to
[1:05:41] make us good neighbors, Lord, Father,
[1:05:43] that Lord God, men can see your good
[1:05:46] work in our life and glorify the Father.
[1:05:50] That's why we want this morning. Come
[1:05:53] now, Lord Jesus. Come, oh God, and just
[1:05:56] breathe upon us, oh God. Come, Lord,
[1:06:01] Father, and just breathe upon us this
[1:06:05] morning. Let the peace of God that
[1:06:07] passes all
[1:06:09] understanding come and bless us in your
[1:06:11] presence. Once again, Father, we pray
[1:06:14] for our brother, brother Augustine,
[1:06:16] Lord, and uh the work that he's doing
[1:06:18] there in Seleon. Oh God, we pray that
[1:06:21] Father, you would just bless him. Amen.
[1:06:23] like these are all around the world. Oh
[1:06:25] God, Father, Lord, they are in villages.
[1:06:28] Oh God, Father, they are in different
[1:06:30] places. So Father, not many know God is
[1:06:33] exposed to the message of the hour, but
[1:06:35] yet to Father, they are preaching the
[1:06:37] gospel of the kingdom. And Father, Lord,
[1:06:40] that don't make them less a minister.
[1:06:42] That don't make them less a ministry.
[1:06:44] It's the work of the kingdom, Lord.
[1:06:46] Father and precious Lord, I believe with
[1:06:48] my heart, Lord, that God, if if some of
[1:06:51] them will have got what we have gotten
[1:06:53] in this age, they will have done exploit
[1:06:55] for you, oh God, and we pray that you
[1:06:58] bless them, Lord Jesus. Supply their
[1:07:01] needs, oh God. Father, we just want to
[1:07:04] thank you now. Thank you, Father, for
[1:07:07] the fellowship, Lord, the contact that
[1:07:10] we have. And and we just pray that Lord
[1:07:13] God, you will bless our time together.
[1:07:15] We love you because you first love us.
[1:07:18] Bless our brother Jack and his wife
[1:07:20] Grace that is fellowshipping with us for
[1:07:22] the first time. And uh I just pray that
[1:07:25] God Father Lord uh uh your presence, the
[1:07:28] atmosphere, Father will make them feel
[1:07:31] at home. We love you now. Speak to us
[1:07:34] out of your word in Jesus name we pray.
[1:07:39] Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. Praise
[1:07:42] the Lord.
[1:07:44] Uh, brother uh
[1:07:48] uh brother Lawrence was going to bring
[1:07:51] his testimony this morning, but uh I
[1:07:53] felt like I will be giving out all of my
[1:07:56] time. Amen. So, uh we will have him to
[1:07:59] do it maybe next
[1:08:02] Sunday. So uh uh the Lord uh kind of uh
[1:08:07] rescue our brother from uh uh what will
[1:08:12] have been uh uh a heart attack and
[1:08:15] something that will have uh uh cost his
[1:08:19] life but God kind of rescue him and uh
[1:08:24] and I mean uh we want to thank the Lord
[1:08:26] for that. Amen.
[1:08:29] So until he gets well, you will see me
[1:08:32] here once in a while trying to lead
[1:08:34] songs that I don't know how to do. So I
[1:08:37] just turn the service into a prayer
[1:08:39] meeting.
[1:08:40] Amen. Until he can be well. And uh so
[1:08:44] the Lord bless you. Romans chapter 8 is
[1:08:46] where we want to read from this morning.
[1:08:49] Romans chapter
[1:08:52] 8. I think brother Augustine was doing
[1:08:55] well because he started preaching my
[1:08:56] message this morning.
[1:09:00] I want to speak on the
[1:09:03] lawgiver. He started preaching my
[1:09:05] message this morning.
[1:09:11] So I want to speak on the law
[1:09:14] giver Romans chapter
[1:09:17] 8. We were supposed to have a a meeting
[1:09:20] but I thought that I will wait until the
[1:09:22] deacons get back. Uh brother Dan is
[1:09:24] flying in this morning. Brother Dan will
[1:09:27] be traveling back uh next week. So I
[1:09:30] will wait until the deacons get back in
[1:09:32] church and then uh we'll have a time to
[1:09:34] talk to you. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:39] Amen. Romans chapter 8. There is
[1:09:41] therefore now no
[1:09:43] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:09:47] Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
[1:09:51] after the spirit.
[1:09:54] Well, let's just do a responsive
[1:09:56] reading. You read the next verse and
[1:09:58] then I will read the third until I will
[1:10:00] stop where I want to stop. So, you read
[1:10:03] the
[1:10:11] second for what the Lord could not do in
[1:10:16] that it was weak through the flesh.
[1:10:20] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:10:25] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[1:10:30] in the flesh.
[1:10:41] For they that are after the flesh do
[1:10:44] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[1:10:47] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:58] spirit because the kind of mind is
[1:11:01] imitated against God. For it is not
[1:11:03] subject to the Lord of God, neither
[1:11:06] indeed can
[1:11:13] be. But ye
[1:11:16] are but ye are not in the flesh, but in
[1:11:19] the spirit, if so be that the spirit of
[1:11:22] God dwelleth in you. Now, if any man
[1:11:25] have not the spirit of Christ, he is
[1:11:28] none of his.
[1:11:38] Let's read verse 11 together. But if the
[1:11:41] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:11:44] the dead dwelt in you, he that raised up
[1:11:48] Christ from the dead shall also quaken
[1:11:51] your mortal body by his spirit that
[1:11:54] dwelleth in you. Let's pray. Father, we
[1:11:57] have just read your word and we just
[1:12:00] want to ask the blessing upon it now
[1:12:02] this morning. Father, come out of the
[1:12:04] pages of your word and uh speak to us.
[1:12:08] Get us engaged this morning, Lord. May
[1:12:11] the word just drive down, Father. Lord
[1:12:14] God, help us, oh Lord. Father, that Lord
[1:12:17] God, we will we will not imply our
[1:12:20] thoughts, Lord. we will just share with
[1:12:23] uh your people what uh your your prophet
[1:12:26] the messenger of this age has given to
[1:12:28] us. Bless us now in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:12:32] Amen. The Lord bless you. You can have
[1:12:34] your seat. You can have the comfort of
[1:12:38] your wonderful seat while I remain
[1:12:42] standing. Praise the Lord while I remain
[1:12:45] standing. You know, in the Old Testament
[1:12:47] tabernacle, there was actually no
[1:12:49] cheers. And uh so the the priest had to
[1:12:53] get in there and do his service of
[1:12:56] burning incense, offering sacrifices,
[1:13:00] you know, it was it was a place of work,
[1:13:03] not a place of
[1:13:04] realization. Amen. You cannot sleep
[1:13:09] standing. You cannot sleep standing,
[1:13:11] then you really have a very serious
[1:13:13] sleep
[1:13:14] illness. If you can sleep comfortably
[1:13:17] standing, then you have a very good
[1:13:21] sleep illness. Now this morning, I want
[1:13:23] to speak on the
[1:13:25] lawgiver. I want to speak on the
[1:13:27] lawgiver. I read a quote right out of
[1:13:30] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:13:32] and forever. Uh uh and then I will go
[1:13:36] right into my subject. I've been I've
[1:13:38] been speaking on this in bit and pieces
[1:13:41] on the Wednesday night. And uh I pray
[1:13:44] this morning that the Lord will will
[1:13:46] will help me as I go into it. I I I was
[1:13:50] uh looking into this this morning and
[1:13:53] and another thing just open to me. But I
[1:13:56] just pray that the Lord will help us.
[1:13:57] Now let's read this
[1:13:59] together. Now when Jesus came on earth,
[1:14:02] we
[1:14:04] find No, when I say let's read it
[1:14:06] together, I mean pay attention. Sorry.
[1:14:11] I start hearing your voices, I said, "Am
[1:14:13] I speaking with
[1:14:15] echo?" Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you.
[1:14:19] Thank you. Thank
[1:14:21] you. Now, when Jesus came to earth, we
[1:14:24] find Jesus went into the wilderness and
[1:14:27] fasted 40 days and night. And when he
[1:14:31] come out, Satan tried to tempt him
[1:14:34] because he was a
[1:14:38] lawgiver like Moses.
[1:14:42] Are we
[1:14:44] together?
[1:14:46] Moses went to receive the Lord. He
[1:14:50] fasted 40 days and night. Jesus fasted
[1:14:54] 40 days and night and came out as a
[1:14:59] lawgiver. Are we
[1:15:01] together? Amen.
[1:15:06] When Moses came out from his 40 days
[1:15:10] fast on the mountain where he had two
[1:15:14] tablets of stones, Satan tempted
[1:15:17] him at his weak
[1:15:20] spot. Do you realize that the the Ten
[1:15:24] Commandments were reprinted?
[1:15:28] Moses had to break the first and went
[1:15:30] back to the mountain for God to rewrite
[1:15:34] the ten commandments again. It's right
[1:15:36] in the
[1:15:42] scripture. Satan tempted him at his weak
[1:15:45] spot. That was his temper. When he came
[1:15:49] out and saw the people having a golden
[1:15:52] calf, you know, he had that weak spot.
[1:15:54] He had that area of temper in him. And
[1:15:58] uh
[1:16:01] uh
[1:16:03] and that was his temper. And he threw
[1:16:07] down the commandment and broke them. And
[1:16:10] when Satan met the Lord Jesus, he knew
[1:16:14] that was in
[1:16:17] Moses. He caught him at his weak spot.
[1:16:21] Hunger. If thou be the son of God,
[1:16:23] command these stones to be turned into
[1:16:25] bread and
[1:16:27] eat cause you are hungry. But he
[1:16:31] realized that that wasn't
[1:16:35] Moses. Amen. Praise the Lord. So this
[1:16:38] morning we want to talk on the lawgiver.
[1:16:41] We want to look at Jesus as the
[1:16:44] lawgiver. You want to look at Jesus as
[1:16:47] the one interpreting the law that Moses
[1:16:51] was giving
[1:16:53] on Mount Si. Are we together? Amen. So
[1:16:59] you will see in Matthew chapter 5,
[1:17:01] that's the reason why Jesus was
[1:17:04] said, "It was said unto you, but now I
[1:17:08] say unto you." That's what we're going
[1:17:10] to study from. Matthew chapter 5 this
[1:17:12] morning running through the biatitudes
[1:17:15] and coming to death. But before we get
[1:17:17] to death to death, this is what Paul is
[1:17:21] telling us here in Romans chapter 8 that
[1:17:25] we we also we we need to pay attention
[1:17:27] to because Paul himself was the writer
[1:17:31] of the New
[1:17:33] Testament. Most of the books, the
[1:17:36] letters in the New Testament, Paul wrote
[1:17:38] them. So we realize that the word for
[1:17:42] the gentile age was given to Paul just
[1:17:45] like Moses brought the word unto the
[1:17:49] Jews. But uh he says here
[1:17:53] uh there is therefore now no
[1:17:58] condemnation. Let's go to uh uh Exodus
[1:18:01] chapter 19. Let's back up a little
[1:18:05] bit. Thank you, brother Gustin. you you
[1:18:07] really build a foundation for me so I
[1:18:10] can go back. Exodus chapter 19. Praise
[1:18:14] the Lord. You know when when I I was
[1:18:16] back in the a coast. I was closer to the
[1:18:19] border with uh with Liberia when we came
[1:18:22] out of Liberia where we were our church
[1:18:26] was the only message church in the city.
[1:18:29] I had an opportunity to work with many
[1:18:31] different pastor and uh kept the
[1:18:34] integrity of the message, kept the
[1:18:36] standard of the message and uh uh I
[1:18:40] preach on their convention their their
[1:18:42] crusades and and and lot of their soul
[1:18:46] uh which of course I realized is the
[1:18:49] grace of God. I mean God kept us there.
[1:18:51] He used that to teach us. And uh many
[1:18:54] years later, I realized not many people
[1:18:57] know how to work with people that don't
[1:18:59] believe the same with them.
[1:19:02] Praise the Lord. Not many. If they don't
[1:19:06] believe I mean they they are
[1:19:09] unbelievers and that's not truth. Exodus
[1:19:13] chapter
[1:19:18] 19. And with that we had made a very
[1:19:20] poor example of this glorious
[1:19:23] message. Let's let's take Esther chapter
[1:19:26] 19 quickly here. See here
[1:19:29] uh in the third month verse one when the
[1:19:34] children of Israel were gone forth out
[1:19:36] of the land of Egypt. The same day came
[1:19:41] they unto the wilderness of
[1:19:43] Sana. For
[1:19:46] there for they were departed from ramped
[1:19:50] and and were come to the desert of Sinai
[1:19:53] and had page in the wilderness. And uh
[1:19:57] and there Israel camp before the mount.
[1:20:00] And Moses went up unto the Lord. And the
[1:20:03] Lord called unto Moses out of the
[1:20:07] mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to
[1:20:10] the house of Israel, tell the children
[1:20:12] of Israel, thou thus shall thou say to
[1:20:15] the house of Jacob, sorry, and tell the
[1:20:18] children of Israel, ye have seen how ye
[1:20:22] have seen what I did unto the Egyptians,
[1:20:26] and how I b you on eagle wings, and
[1:20:29] brought you to
[1:20:32] self. Are we together? And therefore, if
[1:20:36] ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep
[1:20:39] my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar
[1:20:43] people, a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:20:46] above all people, for all the earth is
[1:20:49] mine. Now, see ye now. Now therefore, if
[1:20:53] ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:20:57] commandment, you see how that can sound
[1:21:01] like an order. How that can sound like
[1:21:04] God is requiring something from
[1:21:07] you, but that's not what it
[1:21:11] is. Remember now what Paul says. There
[1:21:15] is no
[1:21:16] condemnation. There is no condemnation
[1:21:18] in this statement. There is no
[1:21:21] requirement in this statement. God is
[1:21:25] telling them, see how I bear you
[1:21:28] up. I bear you out of Egypt on eagle
[1:21:32] wings and I brought you to
[1:21:35] myself. Are we
[1:21:37] together? You see the uh uh uh and and
[1:21:41] and and I believe God designed it like
[1:21:44] that because the word of God is
[1:21:48] understood. God has to reveal himself to
[1:21:51] you. He has to reveal his thoughts to
[1:21:54] you. We just cannot read the word of God
[1:21:57] like a newspaper and be able to
[1:22:00] understand it.
[1:22:02] Are we
[1:22:04] together? For that reason that there are
[1:22:06] a lot of things that translation could
[1:22:10] not bring to us in the in the pure
[1:22:14] context. And that's the reason why the
[1:22:17] Holy Ghost has always a bad with the
[1:22:20] church because where translation fail
[1:22:24] the Holy Ghost take off from
[1:22:26] there. Are we
[1:22:29] together?
[1:22:31] Amen. So God is saying ye have seen what
[1:22:35] I did unto the Egyptians and how I b you
[1:22:39] on eagle wings and brought you to
[1:22:41] myself. That is the grace of God. There
[1:22:42] was nothing that the people
[1:22:44] did. Are we together? There was nothing
[1:22:48] that they did. They never fast and
[1:22:50] prayed. They never they never I mean God
[1:22:52] was keeping his word that he gave to
[1:22:55] Abraham after 400 years. I will come
[1:22:58] down and I will bring them out.
[1:23:04] He told Moses Exodus 3, I have heard the
[1:23:07] crowd of my people and I am come down.
[1:23:13] Are we together?
[1:23:16] But see where see where and and what we
[1:23:19] establish on talking about this is that
[1:23:22] um I can say one thing this morning from
[1:23:25] this pit your mindset your different
[1:23:28] mindset can understand it
[1:23:32] differently. Israel was in a slave
[1:23:36] mindset. They had just come from under
[1:23:40] bondage. So everything was sounding to
[1:23:46] them like an instruction. That's right.
[1:23:50] Everything was sounding to them that God
[1:23:52] was giving them some kind of a
[1:24:00] requirement. Are we together? Now if God
[1:24:04] will start his program by giving
[1:24:07] requirement, he will have given them a
[1:24:09] requirement first before he deliver
[1:24:13] them. Why deliver them? Bring them out
[1:24:16] of the Red Sea and now starts to give
[1:24:19] them a requirement to follow
[1:24:28] him. Are we together?
[1:24:37] So Paul says there is no
[1:24:42] condemnation to them that are in
[1:24:48] Christ. Are we
[1:24:52] together? Are you with me this morning?
[1:24:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:58] I want you to be I want us to be able to
[1:25:00] see this before we get into really into
[1:25:03] our subject because uh uh uh uh that's
[1:25:08] where the rubber meets the road this
[1:25:10] morning. Amen. The rubber meets the road
[1:25:14] right there. He says there is no
[1:25:15] condemnation to them that are in Christ.
[1:25:22] You have to remember that this
[1:25:26] apostle was a man that was taught by
[1:25:29] Galia, one of the best teacher in those
[1:25:33] days. He was taught the Torah. He knew
[1:25:36] he knew the Lord. But after he met Jesus
[1:25:39] on the road of Damascus and he went back
[1:25:42] to the desert of Arabia, then he started
[1:25:45] to understand that really there is no
[1:25:48] condemnation in the Lord.
[1:25:50] There is therefore no condemnation to
[1:25:53] them that are in Christ who walk not
[1:25:55] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:25:57] See what he said in verse two that
[1:25:59] Romans chapter 8. For the law
[1:26:03] of for the Lord of the spirit of life in
[1:26:06] Christ have made me free from the law of
[1:26:11] sin and
[1:26:12] death. For what the
[1:26:15] law Exodus chapter 20 what? Exodus
[1:26:19] chapter 20 could not
[1:26:21] do in that it was weak through the
[1:26:25] flesh. Think about
[1:26:27] it. And when when you look at it, it
[1:26:30] looks
[1:26:31] like it's
[1:26:34] difficult. But Paul says the Lord was
[1:26:40] weak. It was weak. You remember when we
[1:26:44] speak we spoke on the 11 commandment.
[1:26:47] The 11, the ten commandment needed the
[1:26:50] 11th
[1:26:54] commandment. Are we
[1:26:56] together? Jesus says, "A new commandment
[1:26:59] I gave unto
[1:27:04] you. For what the law could not do in
[1:27:08] that it was weak through the flesh, God
[1:27:12] sending his own
[1:27:14] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:27:18] for sin condemn sin in the flesh. Are we
[1:27:24] together? So we will see here that
[1:27:29] uh when you read Romans chapter 8, you
[1:27:31] will learn about the Lord of life in
[1:27:33] Christ. You will learn about the law of
[1:27:35] sin in you and you will learn about the
[1:27:39] law of death in the
[1:27:43] commandment. Paul will tell us right
[1:27:45] here the reason why the commandment was
[1:27:48] given is to magnify
[1:27:51] sin. If there is no law that says 25
[1:27:55] miles an hour on this
[1:27:58] road, everybody will drive. I mean there
[1:28:01] would just be you will hear car crashing
[1:28:03] out
[1:28:05] there but because there is a law. So
[1:28:08] what happened the Lord exposes our
[1:28:13] weakness. We have the tendency of
[1:28:15] speeding but because there is a law we
[1:28:18] got to catch our look over our shoulder
[1:28:20] if police is at the
[1:28:23] corner. Are we together? So that's why
[1:28:27] the Lord the Lord is giving to expose
[1:28:30] our
[1:28:33] weakness. It's not given to change
[1:28:36] us. The Lord is giving for you to
[1:28:39] realize that you need God and you need
[1:28:42] to be changed, but the Lord will not
[1:28:45] change
[1:28:49] you. Are we together? The Lord gave her.
[1:28:52] That's what we want to talk about.
[1:28:54] That's what we're talking about this
[1:28:55] morning. It's so beautiful here. Let's
[1:28:58] go to something here before we jump into
[1:29:01] this subject. Uh uh
[1:29:04] uh Genesis chapter
[1:29:08] 49. Genesis chapter 49. Jacob blessing
[1:29:13] his
[1:29:14] sons before he take his last
[1:29:18] breath. And he called all his
[1:29:21] sons. Genesis
[1:29:24] 49, he called all his sons. In verse 10,
[1:29:29] Genesis
[1:29:31] 49 verse 10. In verse 10, he says this.
[1:29:34] He speaks to Judah, his son
[1:29:38] Judah. Beginning from verse 8, he said,
[1:29:41] Judah, thou art
[1:29:43] he whom thy brethren shall praise. Judah
[1:29:47] means praise. Thy hands shall be at the
[1:29:51] neck of thy enemy.
[1:29:53] Thy father's children shall bow down
[1:29:55] before thee. Judah is a lion's web from
[1:29:59] the prey. My son, thou gone up. He
[1:30:03] stooped down
[1:30:05] uh he couched as a lion and as an old
[1:30:09] lion who shall ro him up. Verse 10,
[1:30:13] that's what I want to focus on now. The
[1:30:16] scepter shall not depart from
[1:30:19] Judah and a lawgiver. We're talking
[1:30:23] about a lawgiver this morning. So here
[1:30:26] it said a lawgiver was already
[1:30:30] prophesized to come out of
[1:30:33] Judah. Are we together?
[1:30:36] But you see the reason why Jacob is
[1:30:40] giving this
[1:30:42] blessing to Judah is
[1:30:45] because
[1:30:47] Ruben corrupted his blessing. Are we
[1:30:51] together? We stay in Genesis chapter 49.
[1:30:55] Let's go back to verse
[1:30:58] three. Back to verse three. The Bible
[1:31:01] says here uh uh uh uh Ruben, thou are my
[1:31:08] firstborn, my might and the beginning of
[1:31:11] my
[1:31:12] strength, the excellent the excellency
[1:31:15] of dignity and the excellency of power.
[1:31:19] But Ruben, you are unstable as water.
[1:31:22] Thou shall not
[1:31:24] excel because thou went up into thy
[1:31:28] father's bed. Then defile thou it. He
[1:31:33] went up to my couch. Now if you read uh
[1:31:37] 1 chronicle the book of the records uh
[1:31:40] uh uh chapter 5, it also bring up this
[1:31:44] story about
[1:31:45] Ruben.
[1:31:47] Why the birthright, the
[1:31:50] priesthood and the kingship was taken
[1:31:54] from Ruby? Because according to Asian
[1:31:57] Lord, those things were reserved for the
[1:32:01] firstborn. The firstborn was the one
[1:32:05] that uh had the
[1:32:07] birthright. But if you read uh over in
[1:32:10] uh 1 Chronicle chapter 5, if we just if
[1:32:14] you just want to run there quickly with
[1:32:15] me
[1:32:18] uh this morning while we while we kind
[1:32:21] of for uh establish ourself here 1
[1:32:24] Chronicle chapter
[1:32:29] 5, are we together?
[1:32:37] 1st Chronicles 5:1. Now the sons of
[1:32:41] Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, for he
[1:32:44] was the firstborn, but for as much as he
[1:32:47] defiled his father's bed, his birthright
[1:32:50] was given unto the sons of Joseph.
[1:32:53] That's why Jacob adopted Ephran
[1:32:59] Eman. You have to realize that Ephra and
[1:33:02] Manosef, they were sons of Joseph, not
[1:33:05] son of Jacob.
[1:33:08] But Jacob adopted him. Why? Because the
[1:33:12] birthright was now given to to uh
[1:33:17] Joseph. That was the reason why you know
[1:33:19] the story of the cross hand when he
[1:33:21] called Joseph to bring his sons so he
[1:33:24] can bless them. That blessing should
[1:33:26] have been for Reuben. I will get there a
[1:33:29] little bit. And uh uh uh uh uh for the
[1:33:32] birthright was given to the sons of
[1:33:35] Joseph, the son of a Israel. And and
[1:33:39] their genealogology is not to be
[1:33:42] reckoned after the first birth. When
[1:33:44] that was broken, Israel no
[1:33:48] longer respected the order of naming the
[1:33:51] genealogy after the firstborn. That's
[1:33:53] what uh the book of the records is
[1:33:55] saying.
[1:33:59] Now a man will call his children by the
[1:34:03] one that is interested in the
[1:34:05] inheritance, not by the
[1:34:09] firstborn. Are we
[1:34:15] together? Are we together this morning?
[1:34:19] Trying not to get
[1:34:20] excited because I I quick to lose now.
[1:34:24] So what I want us to see as we go into
[1:34:27] this, the birthright was taken from
[1:34:30] Reuben. It was given to Joseph and uh
[1:34:34] the the priesthood was taken from
[1:34:37] Reuben. It was given to Levi. And then
[1:34:41] also the the scepter which is the
[1:34:45] kingship was taken from Reuben. It was
[1:34:47] given to
[1:34:49] Judah. Are we together?
[1:34:54] Now look at this. Look at this pattern.
[1:34:57] Look at this pattern. Pay attention.
[1:34:59] Just listen to me. Look at this pattern
[1:35:01] in the word. And you will realize
[1:35:04] that the the serpent
[1:35:07] seed, the serpent
[1:35:11] seed, are we together? The serpent seed.
[1:35:15] Adultery.
[1:35:18] The sex
[1:35:21] act always destroy the sea
[1:35:28] line. Are we
[1:35:32] together? It always destroy the sea
[1:35:35] line.
[1:35:38] And if you look through the scripture,
[1:35:40] you will realize that uh uh uh
[1:35:48] uh there is a pattern in the scripture
[1:35:52] where because of that destruction of the
[1:35:56] sea
[1:35:58] line, the blessing keep falling on the
[1:36:02] second and not the first.
[1:36:08] It was Abel that got a revelation in
[1:36:10] that king.
[1:36:13] Amen. He was a seed of the serpent. Are
[1:36:17] we together? Now, I want you to
[1:36:20] understand me. Like I said, your mindset
[1:36:22] can interpret something completely
[1:36:24] different to you and I will be guilty of
[1:36:26] it because I said it even though that's
[1:36:28] not what I mean. Now,
[1:36:32] so praise the Lord. Um, I'm I'm getting
[1:36:35] fired up yet. Amen. I'm trying to hold
[1:36:38] myself. So, I want you to watch here
[1:36:40] because uh uh uh uh in in in Genesis
[1:36:45] chapter 3 verse 15, we all remember that
[1:36:49] God said the seed of the woman will
[1:36:52] bruise the serpent seed. So, the serpent
[1:36:56] has a
[1:36:57] seed. Are we together? Amen.
[1:37:02] Now using the word serpent seed it can
[1:37:06] be applied in different ways. In the way
[1:37:08] I'm using separ I'm using it in the term
[1:37:12] of the
[1:37:14] act because he introduced sex to the
[1:37:18] humor. So I'm using it in terms of the
[1:37:21] act not actually in terms of of of the
[1:37:25] gene. So I want you to understand me
[1:37:28] now. Okay.
[1:37:30] Every adultery will be
[1:37:35] serpenty because because it is the act
[1:37:38] that was what took place. Are we
[1:37:40] together? Are you seeing where I'm
[1:37:42] going? Amen. So that's that is the sense
[1:37:46] that I'm using it.
[1:37:49] So the serpent seed the uh uh uh the the
[1:37:53] adultery sex act always destroy the
[1:37:56] sealine and with that you will see that
[1:38:00] God show us a
[1:38:04] pattern. Abel got the revelation and
[1:38:08] king killed
[1:38:09] Abel. Amen.
[1:38:12] Now you will see the uh uh uh naturally
[1:38:18] who is the firstborn of Abraham? Ishmael
[1:38:20] not not Isaac. Isaac is firstborn by
[1:38:28] promise. Ishmael is the litual
[1:38:30] firstborn. But here it say the blessing
[1:38:32] is going to Isaac and not
[1:38:37] Ishmael. Jacob come on the scene. He
[1:38:40] brought I mean uh uh uh Isaac come on
[1:38:43] the scene. He brought Esau and
[1:38:46] Jacob. And we seen the blessing and the
[1:38:48] breath going to Jacob and not
[1:38:51] Esau. So what what what is God telling
[1:38:55] us? What is he what what message is he
[1:38:58] passing to us? You must be born again
[1:39:01] because your first birth can never get
[1:39:04] the birthight.
[1:39:08] The promise is not to your first birth.
[1:39:11] When God think about you as a son of God
[1:39:14] or as a daughter of God, it's not by
[1:39:16] your first birth.
[1:39:19] The promise is to the new birth.
[1:39:27] Are we together?
[1:39:29] Amen.
[1:39:31] But yet we have to carry the new birth
[1:39:34] in a fallen body.
[1:39:37] So you have to have more confidence in
[1:39:40] what God is doing in you than what this
[1:39:43] flesh is producing.
[1:39:50] Are we together?
[1:40:01] The Lord gave
[1:40:05] her a promise of the Lord giver was
[1:40:09] given to
[1:40:10] Judah. The
[1:40:13] kingship the serptorter shall not depart
[1:40:17] from Judah. A
[1:40:20] lawgiver from between his feet until
[1:40:25] shallow
[1:40:27] come and unto him shall the gathering of
[1:40:31] the people
[1:40:35] be. Are we
[1:40:37] together? Praise the Lord. So even
[1:40:41] before the law was given, a lawgiver was
[1:40:50] promised. Are we
[1:40:52] together? So God had in mind of of
[1:40:56] giving us a lawgiver.
[1:41:05] So when we get back again to Exodus
[1:41:07] chapter 19, let's go back to Exodus
[1:41:09] chapter 19
[1:41:10] quickly. Let's let's run between
[1:41:17] there. You love the
[1:41:20] Lord.
[1:41:23] Amen. Ye have seen what I did unto the
[1:41:25] Egyptian and how I b you on eagle wings.
[1:41:28] That's verse four. And brought you unto
[1:41:30] myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey
[1:41:32] my voice, and keep my covenant, then ye
[1:41:36] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me,
[1:41:41] above all people, for all the earth is
[1:41:45] mine, and ye shall be unto
[1:41:49] me a kingdom of
[1:41:53] priests, and an holy nation.
[1:41:56] These are the words which thou shalt
[1:41:59] speak unto the children of Israel. And
[1:42:02] Moses came and called the others of the
[1:42:04] people, and lay before their faces all
[1:42:07] these words which the Lord commanded
[1:42:09] him. And all the people answered
[1:42:12] together and said, "All that the Lord
[1:42:15] has spoken, we will
[1:42:18] do." And Moses returned the words of the
[1:42:22] people unto the Lord. And then you if
[1:42:25] you read the rest of that, the scene
[1:42:28] changed. Amen. The scene changed. It
[1:42:32] gave us it gave us uh an idea
[1:42:38] that when we misunderstand God, when we
[1:42:42] misunderstand what he's doing in our
[1:42:45] life, when we misunderstand why he
[1:42:48] allows certain things to
[1:42:50] happen, the scenes change.
[1:42:54] because you are robbing God of carrying
[1:42:57] out what he want to
[1:42:59] do because you have
[1:43:02] misunderstood what he's
[1:43:08] doing. Are we together?
[1:43:12] The people misunderstood God and and
[1:43:15] this became a a theologian all through
[1:43:18] the ages and even brother Brandham call
[1:43:20] it this was Israel filter mistake when
[1:43:24] they said all that the Lord has said we
[1:43:28] would
[1:43:29] do. Praise the
[1:43:31] Lord. Go back a chapter. These were a
[1:43:35] people that came through a rare sea
[1:43:38] pattern. When they came on the other
[1:43:40] side, they started
[1:43:44] complaining. With all your eyes have
[1:43:46] seen Egypt on a chariot with dust in the
[1:43:50] air, but yet they couldn't catch up with
[1:43:52] you. All of that we have
[1:43:57] seen. And yet in the place of our least
[1:44:00] need, we stay
[1:44:05] complain. Then are you telling me that
[1:44:07] everything that the Lord said we would
[1:44:09] do
[1:44:12] really?
[1:44:16] Really when we can't even trust him in
[1:44:20] the list of our concerns, the list of
[1:44:22] our
[1:44:27] need. Are we together? Are you seeing
[1:44:30] the picture? It changed. It changed for
[1:44:33] Israel right there. Everything changed.
[1:44:41] And even as humans, you know what it is
[1:44:44] when you've been
[1:44:47] misunderstood. When you're trying to say
[1:44:50] something and you just been taken
[1:44:54] completely, far away from what what
[1:44:56] you're trying to say and this person is
[1:44:59] fully convinced that's what you were
[1:45:01] saying.
[1:45:06] Are we
[1:45:08] together? That will introduce us to the
[1:45:11] Ten Commandments. But that's not where
[1:45:12] we going this morning. We want to talk
[1:45:14] on the lawgiver. I'm just trying to
[1:45:17] build a picture
[1:45:19] here. So, think about it now. Yeah. God
[1:45:22] telling these
[1:45:24] people, "You are a peculiar people unto
[1:45:27] me." Go back, pull it up in your
[1:45:29] concordance and see how many times that
[1:45:31] God told Israel, "You are a peculiar
[1:45:34] people." Even when they couldn't keep
[1:45:36] the
[1:45:39] commandments, he kept telling
[1:45:42] him, "For my name's
[1:45:46] sake, you are a holy nation. You are a
[1:45:49] peculiar people." It was not It was not
[1:45:52] the acts of the people that God was
[1:45:56] judging.
[1:45:58] It was because God has taken these
[1:46:02] people as his people. Amen. And he was
[1:46:06] God in their
[1:46:09] mess. Are we
[1:46:14] together? So Paul on the other side now
[1:46:18] is telling us there is no
[1:46:21] condemnation to them that are in Christ.
[1:46:27] And if you are still feeling condemned,
[1:46:30] it's because you're not in Christ.
[1:46:32] You're not fully in Christ
[1:46:35] yet.
[1:46:38] Amen. If if you are still feeling like
[1:46:41] you are obligated to do something to
[1:46:44] merit God love for
[1:46:46] you, you're not in Christ
[1:46:49] yet because there is no condemnation.
[1:46:53] There is no condemnation in telling
[1:46:55] people what you did for
[1:47:02] them. Praise the
[1:47:06] Lord. I really I I really thank God that
[1:47:09] uh you know I I I was dead. You know I I
[1:47:12] thank God that the Lord could use me.
[1:47:14] You know I mean sometimes we try to to
[1:47:16] to simplify it and in in a way that you
[1:47:20] will not think that the person is
[1:47:22] bragging that's the way we try to talk
[1:47:25] but there is there is there there must
[1:47:27] be no
[1:47:29] condemnation why should I feel
[1:47:32] condemned if you are express expressing
[1:47:35] you know gratefulness that you were
[1:47:37] there to help
[1:47:40] me. Do you see the off feeling? Do you
[1:47:43] see the
[1:47:47] ingratitude or who he think he is? The
[1:47:50] problem is not with him. It's with
[1:47:53] you. It's with
[1:47:56] you. The problem is not with
[1:48:00] him. Just because he helped me, he keeps
[1:48:02] saying
[1:48:07] it. Are we together?
[1:48:11] There is no condemnation to them that
[1:48:15] are in
[1:48:16] Christ. There's no condemnation in what
[1:48:20] Matthew chapter 19
[1:48:22] said. I bear you on eagle wings. I
[1:48:26] brought you to myself. I want you to be
[1:48:28] a a kingdom of priests. I want you to be
[1:48:31] a peculiar people.
[1:48:38] But you see the the the the the effect
[1:48:42] of slavery was was haunting their mind.
[1:48:45] The effect of
[1:48:48] Egypt was haunting their
[1:48:51] mind. And it's so easy for the person to
[1:48:53] sit there and say, "But where were you
[1:48:55] all of these
[1:48:57] years?" Praise the
[1:49:02] Lord. And if I was God, I would say, "I
[1:49:05] was there. That's why you didn't die.
[1:49:13] You remember when the slave master corn
[1:49:15] on you that day and you thought you were
[1:49:18] going to
[1:49:19] die? The reason why you didn't die
[1:49:22] because I was there.
[1:49:26] things that we go through, things that
[1:49:29] we deal with, it's easy to put us in a
[1:49:32] mindset and that becomes our experiment.
[1:49:37] That becomes your own
[1:49:40] battle because you might forget it, but
[1:49:43] it's it's it it roams about in your
[1:49:46] spirit. It a peace to you. It could make
[1:49:50] you angry. It could make you frustrated.
[1:49:52] It could also make you feel lustful if
[1:49:55] it was a lustful thing that you that you
[1:49:57] that you you you live
[1:49:59] in. Are we together? So that's the
[1:50:03] reason why the greater battle is in the
[1:50:04] mind. The greater battle is in the
[1:50:08] spirit. It is you trying by the promise
[1:50:11] of God and the word of God to rise above
[1:50:14] those things.
[1:50:16] There is no condemnation to them that
[1:50:18] are in Christ.
[1:50:23] Are we
[1:50:26] together? Christian life is not just
[1:50:28] Sunday morning church. No, it's a
[1:50:31] constant battle. It's a everyday battle.
[1:50:34] You're not fighting with anybody. You're
[1:50:36] dealing with things in here. You're
[1:50:38] bringing this thing constantly on a
[1:50:40] subjection to God's word, honor
[1:50:43] subjuggest to God's
[1:50:45] promises because you can live the best
[1:50:48] decent life. And you know uh uh uh I
[1:50:51] mean uh uh represent the church uh uh in
[1:50:55] in inheriting outwalling and yet in
[1:50:58] wallet you are
[1:50:59] distraught. In wallet you are
[1:51:02] distraught because you can't trust you
[1:51:05] can't trust the God yourself. You can't
[1:51:08] even trust what you reading in the
[1:51:09] Bible. You can't trust the message of
[1:51:11] the hour.
[1:51:20] Are we
[1:51:26] together? The Lord gave
[1:51:31] her. Matthew chapter 5. Let's go back to
[1:51:34] Matthew chapter 5. That's where we've
[1:51:37] been working with this.
[1:51:43] So just
[1:51:45] like Jesus went into the wilderness, he
[1:51:48] fast, he fasted 40 days and night. And
[1:51:51] when he came out, Satan tried to tempt
[1:51:54] him because he was the lawgiver like
[1:51:56] Moses. So when he came
[1:52:04] out, Matthew chapter
[1:52:15] 5. Are we together? If you read Matthew
[1:52:19] chapter 4, it tells you uh the mount of
[1:52:22] temptation. Matthew chapter 4 tells you
[1:52:25] Jesus being tempted on the mountain by
[1:52:27] the devil. So chapter five right after
[1:52:30] that here is he having the first time he
[1:52:33] will have this big
[1:52:35] audience that he'll be you'll be saying
[1:52:37] things to that was very very surprising
[1:52:41] to the people. Are we together?
[1:52:45] So if you if you if you if you take the
[1:52:47] picture in your mind, you will see that
[1:52:50] uh what is he doing? Being the lawgiver,
[1:52:54] being the one that was supposed to
[1:52:56] fulfill the promise in Genesis 9 uh
[1:53:01] 49:10, he was the
[1:53:03] lawgiver because he he he actually had
[1:53:07] the the the the the meaning of what
[1:53:10] Moses
[1:53:11] said. Are we together?
[1:53:16] The Lord gave us shall not depart from
[1:53:17] your feet. The Bible says here, "And
[1:53:21] seeing the multitude, he went up into
[1:53:23] the mountain. And when he sat, his
[1:53:26] disciple came unto him. He opened his
[1:53:27] mouth and said unto them, blessed are
[1:53:30] the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
[1:53:32] kingdom of heaven." We deal with that uh
[1:53:34] on Wednesday night. A little bit is that
[1:53:37] that's not that is not the doctrine
[1:53:39] doctrine of poverty. No Catholic
[1:53:42] explained this as the doctrine of
[1:53:44] poverty. You have to live in poverty.
[1:53:47] Jesus never says uh you know blessed uh
[1:53:50] uh are the poor that don't have money or
[1:53:52] don't have car or don't have home. He
[1:53:54] said blessed are the poor in
[1:53:57] spirit. In
[1:54:01] spirit. Why? Because he's bringing this
[1:54:05] kingdom. Are we together?
[1:54:08] This is a kingdom. This is a word that
[1:54:10] is going to deal with things in
[1:54:18] you. Are we
[1:54:20] together? You love the
[1:54:23] Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:26] Amen.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
[1:54:36] We're just
[1:54:37] uh having a little little bit of talk
[1:54:41] and uh you know doing our our
[1:54:45] constant Bible reading
[1:54:47] home. Uh and we read
[1:54:50] this the other day to the kids and uh
[1:54:52] Proverb 25 verse 28. He that have no
[1:54:57] rule over his spirit is like a city that
[1:55:01] is broken down without walls.
[1:55:05] He that have no rule over his
[1:55:08] spirit is like a city that is breaking
[1:55:12] down. Praise the
[1:55:17] Lord. Science will tell you that your
[1:55:20] subconscious is more powerful than your
[1:55:23] first conscious.
[1:55:28] We deal with things, we see things, we
[1:55:30] hear
[1:55:32] things. But the term to to reside in our
[1:55:37] subconscious. Most of the time the way
[1:55:41] we we react to things sometimes is not
[1:55:44] from the immediate action of the person
[1:55:47] is from what has been lying in our
[1:55:50] subconscious.
[1:55:56] Are we together? So Jesus here is going
[1:56:00] to bring this thing over trying to help
[1:56:03] these help the people see the disciples.
[1:56:06] The rest of the people living to
[1:56:08] him that the word the Lord was not
[1:56:11] actually giving you know an eye to eye a
[1:56:13] flesh for flesh and ear for
[1:56:15] ears. It was something that was supposed
[1:56:18] to convert us from inside. There was
[1:56:22] something that was supposed to change us
[1:56:24] from
[1:56:25] inside. But Brand says if you have God
[1:56:28] in you, you will see God in
[1:56:32] everything. That's why he
[1:56:35] said, remember that story of that little
[1:56:37] child as his uh the Sunday school
[1:56:39] teacher, where is
[1:56:41] God? Are we together?
[1:56:45] Blessed are the poor in spirit. So you
[1:56:47] see uh we use the type of the young rich
[1:56:50] ruler. He was he was rich, you know, uh
[1:56:53] and everything, but the Bible say he was
[1:56:55] he was he was uh uh someone that
[1:56:58] possessed he was a possessor of great
[1:57:01] things. So what actually ho him, it was
[1:57:05] not him giving his things to the poor.
[1:57:09] What hen him was his riches in his
[1:57:12] spirit. He have a good
[1:57:15] name. People respect him. He had a proud
[1:57:18] spirit.
[1:57:20] Was he ready to give up all of those
[1:57:23] things for the
[1:57:27] kingdom? So most of the time the things
[1:57:29] that hinder us in our
[1:57:32] work are things
[1:57:35] that we have
[1:57:37] inherited, our inner
[1:57:40] inheritance. Praise the Lord. Some
[1:57:43] people, some of us are so rich in the
[1:57:46] spirit and so broke in the
[1:57:51] flesh. So broke in the
[1:57:56] flesh. Not to say they are for the joke,
[1:57:59] but it's it's something
[1:58:01] serious. Amen. Yeah, it's something
[1:58:05] serious. I mean, it's uh because it it
[1:58:08] it affects us outwardly.
[1:58:13] The whole you know poverty thing and
[1:58:15] suffering thing is is things that is all
[1:58:18] in our
[1:58:22] spirit. We we want to be envious and
[1:58:26] jealousy and all of that and you know
[1:58:28] when uh uh trying to also catch up
[1:58:32] trying to also make name and but as long
[1:58:34] as we are possessing those things in
[1:58:43] us the dove do not have a god. So
[1:58:46] whatever it eats that's what keep it
[1:58:49] clean on the
[1:58:50] outside. Amen. It do not have no god. It
[1:58:54] don't it cannot digest
[1:58:58] bitterness. So whatever it eats it clean
[1:59:01] the outside. That's the do. Are we
[1:59:04] together? Blessed are they that mourn
[1:59:06] for they shall be comforted. We talk
[1:59:08] about that is is self moouring thinking
[1:59:11] about our ways. Like David said I think
[1:59:13] on my ways and I turn my feet to your
[1:59:17] testimony. We have to mourn
[1:59:19] ourself. Blessed are the meek. You find
[1:59:22] that also is uh is an inner thing.
[1:59:26] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:59:28] test after righteousness is also an
[1:59:31] inner
[1:59:32] thing. Testing and hungering after
[1:59:35] righteousness. Lord, I want to be like
[1:59:37] you. Lord, you know uh uh give me the
[1:59:41] grace to walk like you. Blessed are the
[1:59:45] merciful. So you go through this, you go
[1:59:47] through the whole thing here, you will
[1:59:49] find out that uh uh uh you know he uh
[1:59:54] he's dealing with the inside. He's
[1:59:56] dealing with the
[2:00:00] inside and
[2:00:05] uh blessed are the men when they are uh
[2:00:09] persecuted and rejoice and be
[2:00:11] exceedingly glad. Verse 13. Ye are the
[2:00:14] salt of the earth, but if the earth has
[2:00:16] lost its severe, wherewith shall it be
[2:00:19] salted, and henceforth is good for
[2:00:21] nothing but is cast out and troing on a
[2:00:23] foot. You are the light of the
[2:00:26] word as said it that is set on
[2:00:30] hill cannot be
[2:00:33] heard. Are we
[2:00:35] together? Are we together? Verse
[2:00:39] 17, we stop on that all night. Jesus
[2:00:42] says here thing net that I've come to
[2:00:46] destroy the
[2:00:50] Lord. Praise the
[2:00:52] Lord. Now because he's bringing these
[2:00:55] things to these people and no doubt I
[2:00:57] believe there were Pharisees. I believe
[2:00:59] there were scribes that were all part of
[2:01:01] the group. They were who is this man? I
[2:01:03] mean what what is he talking about here?
[2:01:05] You know yet he will also say uh uh uh
[2:01:09] accept your righteousness. exceed the
[2:01:11] righteousness of the Pharisees. You
[2:01:13] know, who can be righteous than the
[2:01:16] Pharisees? You know, those men, I mean,
[2:01:19] their their their measurement is
[2:01:22] right. You know, their measurement down
[2:01:24] from down is right. And I mean, there is
[2:01:27] no stain on their garments and all of
[2:01:30] those things were eyewall things. So,
[2:01:31] he's trying to drive this thing. Think
[2:01:34] that I've come to destroy the Lord or
[2:01:36] the prophet. I'm not come to destroy the
[2:01:38] Lord or the prophet, but to fulfill
[2:01:41] it. Amen. This is the
[2:01:46] fulfillment of what Moses gave to you. I
[2:01:50] am the fulfillment.
[2:01:54] In another way, Jesus was telling them,
[2:01:57] I am the
[2:01:59] fulfillment of everything that Moses
[2:02:02] give to you. Keep the Sabbath day holy.
[2:02:06] He says, "I'm the Lord of the Sabbath."
[2:02:13] Are we together?
[2:02:17] For verily I say unto you, till the
[2:02:19] heaven uh uh uh till heaven and earth
[2:02:22] pass, not one jot or one turtle shall in
[2:02:25] no wise pass from the Lord, till all be
[2:02:28] fulfilled.
[2:02:29] Whosoever therefore shall break break
[2:02:32] one of of the least commandment, and
[2:02:36] shall teach men so, he shall be called
[2:02:40] least in the kingdom of heaven. But
[2:02:42] whosoever shall do and teach them, the
[2:02:46] same shall be called great in the
[2:02:49] kingdom of
[2:02:50] heaven. Are we
[2:02:53] together? Yeah. There he speaks about
[2:02:56] your righteousness exceeding the
[2:02:58] righteousness of the scribes and
[2:03:00] Pharisees. For I said unto you, except
[2:03:03] your
[2:03:04] righteousness shall exceed the the
[2:03:06] righteousness of the stripe and
[2:03:08] Pharisees, ye shall in no
[2:03:10] way enter into the kingdom. I was I was
[2:03:14] studing something recently. I'm trying
[2:03:17] to find a way to bring it to you because
[2:03:20] it might sound very very gross when I'm
[2:03:22] talking about it. And uh and it's it's
[2:03:26] uh you you hear the the the the what
[2:03:29] what Isaiah said. Though our sin is
[2:03:34] red
[2:03:36] as
[2:03:38] crimson, it shall be white as snow.
[2:03:46] the
[2:03:47] the from the from the original Hebrew,
[2:03:51] the translator tried to make it a way
[2:03:55] for us to be able to receive
[2:03:57] it. But
[2:03:59] actually, you will see multiple times in
[2:04:02] the Old Testament where uh God tried to
[2:04:06] demonstrate like brother Brandon preach
[2:04:08] a message the creator of
[2:04:11] sin to show how cruous sin is.
[2:04:16] And that is the same way in the Old
[2:04:18] Testament. You look there in in in uh in
[2:04:21] uh in Zachcharias, you will see where
[2:04:23] the prophet Joshua came and and you know
[2:04:26] and he told this priest that he must go
[2:04:29] and take dons. He must go and take uh
[2:04:31] waste, human
[2:04:33] waste and and and cover himself with it
[2:04:37] just to be able to show how the sin of
[2:04:41] the people
[2:04:45] was dead in the sight of
[2:04:52] God. Are we
[2:04:55] together? You see, so I mean uh uh uh
[2:04:59] when the Bible says our righteousness is
[2:05:02] like a filthy
[2:05:06] wreck, your righteousness is like a
[2:05:09] filthy rag.
[2:05:12] the the the the the the depth of the
[2:05:16] Hebrew will would tell you like it's
[2:05:19] like a mere
[2:05:22] cloth. That's why it will tell you your
[2:05:28] righteousness. Are we
[2:05:31] together? You see, so God has a way of
[2:05:34] of making us to see how nasty sin is.
[2:05:43] how evil it is. And it's not only evil,
[2:05:45] it's it's just nasty. It's
[2:05:53] gross. So if Jesus says here, except
[2:05:56] your righteousness and see the
[2:05:58] righteousness of the scribes and the
[2:06:00] Pharisees, ye shall in all case enter
[2:06:03] into the
[2:06:04] kingdom. Now see what he going into. Now
[2:06:08] ye have heard that it was said by them
[2:06:12] of old, thou shalt not kill. What is he
[2:06:14] doing? Pointing back to Gen Exodus 20.
[2:06:18] He's pointing back to the Ten
[2:06:23] Commandments. Are we
[2:06:28] together? And whosoever shall kill will
[2:06:30] be endangered of the judgment. For I
[2:06:33] said unto you, whosoever is
[2:06:37] angry, which is an inner
[2:06:42] feeling.
[2:06:44] Amen. Which is an inner feeling. You
[2:06:47] see, the law was given, but yet God
[2:06:50] gives a provision. When he gave them the
[2:06:53] law, the ten
[2:06:56] commandments, thou shalt not kill
[2:06:58] whoever kill, you know, th and all of
[2:07:00] that. God gave them seven city of
[2:07:04] refuge that when you come when you ever
[2:07:07] come in breaking of this law run to one
[2:07:09] of these city find the high priest and
[2:07:12] tell him your
[2:07:15] matter if you don't get there the
[2:07:17] adventure of blood will kill
[2:07:20] you so you see how in every way God was
[2:07:24] giving
[2:07:26] grace the city of refuge was the grace
[2:07:29] of God in the time of the Lord.
[2:07:38] Are we
[2:07:39] together? But now I say unto you, you
[2:07:42] have heard, thou shall not care. But now
[2:07:45] I say unto you,
[2:07:48] hovering and angry
[2:07:53] feeling. Praise the Lord. Are we
[2:07:56] together? Amen. You love the Lord giver.
[2:08:01] He's the fulfillment of the
[2:08:05] Lord.
[2:08:07] Hallelujah. He's the one with everything
[2:08:09] that they did unto him. Father, counting
[2:08:12] that to their
[2:08:14] cause, forgive
[2:08:16] them. It was the fulfillment of the
[2:08:20] Lord. Amen.
[2:08:23] Ye have heard, but I said unto you,
[2:08:27] whosoever is angry with his brother
[2:08:29] without a curse, ye h shall be in anger
[2:08:33] h shall be in danger with the
[2:08:36] judgment. Praise the
[2:08:45] Lord. Let me let me go down. I'm trying
[2:08:48] to I'm trying to hurry up quickly.
[2:08:51] Whosoever shall say, thy food shall be
[2:08:54] in the danger of hellfire. Therefore I
[2:08:56] therefore if thou bring that gift to the
[2:09:01] altar, and there remember that thy
[2:09:04] brother have an against thee, leave that
[2:09:07] gift there. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:10] Amen. Go and deal with that thing.
[2:09:14] go and deal with that
[2:09:16] thing because just like God told Samuel,
[2:09:20] man looks at the
[2:09:23] outward but he says God looks at the
[2:09:28] inward. Are we together? Man looks at
[2:09:31] the outward, but God looks at the
[2:09:43] inward. Verse 27. Let's drop down a
[2:09:46] little bit. I'm trying I'm running. I'm
[2:09:49] trying to get to a place
[2:09:50] here. Then I can get uh my time is
[2:09:54] almost done. But
[2:09:56] uh ye have heard that it was said by
[2:10:00] them of
[2:10:02] old, thou shalt not commit
[2:10:06] idolatry. But I said unto you, that
[2:10:09] whosoever lookth on the woman to lust
[2:10:13] after her has committed adultery with
[2:10:16] her already in his
[2:10:24] heart. Praise the Lord. So you see here
[2:10:28] that uh that that
[2:10:32] Jesus is actually dealing with the inner
[2:10:35] man. The word is preached to bring
[2:10:38] conviction to us. And you know what many
[2:10:42] of us do around the message is to just
[2:10:46] learn the way the prophet said
[2:10:48] it. We just want to make sure that we
[2:10:52] are saying it the way brother Brandham
[2:10:54] said. In as much as that is good, the
[2:10:58] message was given to change our life.
[2:11:02] For this divine mystery, truth will
[2:11:05] change our heart, turn our heart back to
[2:11:08] the faith of the fathers.
[2:11:12] That's why he
[2:11:23] said then he comes right here with this
[2:11:27] with this uh uh verse that uh you know
[2:11:30] people take literally. If thy eye offend
[2:11:34] thee, pluck it out. Cast it is is
[2:11:37] profitable. If thy hand offend thee, cut
[2:11:40] it
[2:11:41] off. And uh and then he deals with that.
[2:11:44] Now watch, you just see now what what I
[2:11:46] want what I want you to see here. Look
[2:11:49] at from verse
[2:11:51] 27. Look at from verse 27, verse 28, he
[2:11:56] that lookth on a woman. Verse 29, if thy
[2:11:59] eyes offend thee. Verse 30, if thy hand
[2:12:02] offend thee. Verse
[2:12:05] 31. It had been said unto thee,
[2:12:09] whosoever put away his wife, let him
[2:12:13] give her a written divorcement, but I
[2:12:17] say unto thee. Now, so see what Jesus is
[2:12:20] doing here.
[2:12:22] He's taking the lost
[2:12:26] problem, the lost problem that have c
[2:12:30] that have created the adultery problem.
[2:12:34] The adultery problem create the divorce
[2:12:37] problem.
[2:12:41] Praise the Lord. It all starts from the
[2:12:44] lust.
[2:12:48] See what he's doing now.
[2:12:53] Are we together?
[2:12:56] You see how you see how he's how he's
[2:12:59] just tying it just to just to make us to
[2:13:01] see because he's coming to show show us
[2:13:04] here that it's because of the hardiness.
[2:13:07] The hardiness of their heart that was
[2:13:10] why they put their wives away. But from
[2:13:12] the beginning it was not so. So he's
[2:13:15] trying to show us that our problems
[2:13:18] start from lust.
[2:13:28] Are we together?
[2:13:32] and and and uh the thing about it that
[2:13:34] is that it's easy for the Pharisees to
[2:13:37] sit right there in the service and I
[2:13:40] mean they are shaking who he think he is
[2:13:43] and what what is he doing there and and
[2:13:46] but
[2:13:47] actually this is the law of
[2:13:50] liberty. Amen. Understanding what is the
[2:13:54] cause, understanding where it begin from
[2:13:56] that's the beginning of your victory.
[2:14:01] Jesus is trying to tell them where this
[2:14:03] thing begin from.
[2:14:07] You don't have to live in condemnation
[2:14:09] when you understand where it begin from.
[2:14:18] But yet they are so bound in their Lord
[2:14:20] and they are clenching to their seat and
[2:14:23] they are holding their garment. They are
[2:14:25] grabbing their
[2:14:26] teeth and with all of that they are
[2:14:30] refusing the Lord of Liberty. They will
[2:14:33] walk away and go right back into the
[2:14:37] hardiness of heart when all he's trying
[2:14:40] to show them is this is where this thing
[2:14:44] began
[2:14:50] from. Oh, it is beautiful. Amen. You
[2:14:53] love the Lord.
[2:14:56] You love the Lord. Oh man,
[2:14:59] I uh I really couldn't get in my notes
[2:15:02] now. So time is already not our friend
[2:15:07] here. But I mean just just so we can be
[2:15:10] able to to just
[2:15:13] appreciate Amen. appreciate the the word
[2:15:18] that is given to us. Hallelujah.
[2:15:33] So you find
[2:15:34] that
[2:15:36] the the Lord gave
[2:15:40] her when he
[2:15:45] came in expressing in interpreting the
[2:15:48] Lord in trying to bring to
[2:15:53] us what actually God meant when he says
[2:15:57] if you keep my commandment and walk in
[2:15:59] my
[2:16:01] ways that he was not requiring
[2:16:05] us. He was trying
[2:16:09] to have us
[2:16:11] to
[2:16:14] appreciate. Praise the Lord. Amen. for
[2:16:18] us to be able to appreciate where he
[2:16:21] took us
[2:16:24] from. In appreciating where he took us
[2:16:28] from is able to develop a a character
[2:16:33] for us to trust that he that have
[2:16:36] brought us this far is more than able to
[2:16:40] take us
[2:16:44] in. Praise the Lord.
[2:16:49] If he has picked us out of sin on the
[2:16:52] wings of an eagle, he can change our
[2:16:54] body and take us in the rapture.
[2:17:01] Falling in love with
[2:17:03] Jesus. Is the best thing I've ever done.
[2:17:07] Amen. Is the best thing that I've ever
[2:17:11] done. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:14] is the best
[2:17:18] thing. Oh
[2:17:21] my, what a wonderful Jesus we
[2:17:28] serve the
[2:17:33] Lord. I was looking at one of my notes
[2:17:36] uh way back. I think that was either
[2:17:40] uh 2019 or 17 preaching the message uh
[2:17:44] the felt a
[2:17:48] mistake and uh I guess I guess not many
[2:17:52] can remember that. So it's another
[2:17:54] opportunity for me to repreach it.
[2:18:02] But you see, just like just like Israel,
[2:18:05] this is what I want to I want to drive
[2:18:07] this thing
[2:18:08] in. It's more like just admonishing you
[2:18:11] this morning than like than a message.
[2:18:14] Just like
[2:18:18] Israel, the mistake of not understanding
[2:18:22] what God was bringing to them. The same
[2:18:26] just like the mistake of not taking the
[2:18:29] birthright serious.
[2:18:33] That was is a
[2:18:36] problem. Praise the Lord. It just felt
[2:18:40] like I mean I I was the first that came
[2:18:44] out. Okay. I I was the first that came
[2:18:46] out. What what meaning of this breath
[2:18:50] right? Are we together?
[2:18:55] And that's that's that is the thing that
[2:18:57] has destroyed the Christian faith
[2:19:00] because we have a bunch of people that
[2:19:02] believe in God but never take his word
[2:19:04] serious.
[2:19:08] That is the thing that is destroying the
[2:19:11] glorious message that God has sent to
[2:19:13] us.
[2:19:21] A group of people that call themselves
[2:19:23] bride but never wanted to never want to
[2:19:26] come on a
[2:19:30] hairship. That's our problem. We never
[2:19:33] want to come on a hairship. We just want
[2:19:35] the knowledge of the word. Brother Bam,
[2:19:37] brother BC, brother Ramsey, brother
[2:19:39] Ramsey. But we never want to come on a
[2:19:42] hairship. But you have to remember
[2:19:44] subjuggestion is the secret weapon of
[2:19:46] the
[2:19:53] church. Are we
[2:19:59] together? The Lord gave came down. The
[2:20:02] very one that gave the law token flesh
[2:20:06] and step among his people.
[2:20:11] Praise the Lord. Amen. The very one that
[2:20:15] gave the Lord, he took on
[2:20:17] flesh and he stepped among his
[2:20:22] people. Hallelujah.
[2:20:25] And he started telling them, "Ye have
[2:20:27] heard, but now I say unto
[2:20:32] you,
[2:20:35] Amen." I believe many of them stood
[2:20:37] there and says, "Who is this man? What
[2:20:40] he mean by I say unto you, what
[2:20:42] authority does he have? Is he greater
[2:20:44] than
[2:20:45] Moses? But this was the
[2:20:48] lawgiver. This was the very man that
[2:20:52] wrote those commandments with his
[2:20:54] fingers on the
[2:20:56] stone. Praise the
[2:20:59] Lord. That's the reason why he could
[2:21:01] write on the sand and tell the woman,
[2:21:03] "Go and sin no more."
[2:21:07] The same fingers that wrote on the stone
[2:21:09] were the same fingers that wrote on the
[2:21:11] sand. And told her, "Neither do I
[2:21:14] condemn
[2:21:23] thee." Let's read something here and
[2:21:25] then we close.
[2:21:30] completely out uh where I wanted to go
[2:21:33] this morning, but it's fine. It's fine.
[2:21:35] We are we are safe. Amen. Let's read
[2:21:38] something
[2:21:39] here and we close. Deuteronomy chapter
[2:21:42] 5.
[2:21:52] Now if you if you study the book of
[2:21:54] Deuteronomy you understand that the book
[2:21:57] of Deuteronomy is the summing up Moses
[2:22:00] is summing up the entire journey. He's
[2:22:03] making a
[2:22:07] summary because I believe now with
[2:22:10] walking with God and walking with the
[2:22:12] people he have understood a whole lot.
[2:22:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:22:20] He have understood a whole lot. This uh
[2:22:24] verses we're going to read is is very
[2:22:27] very very precious to me. I love
[2:22:30] it. I love it. Let's read here the uh
[2:22:34] chapter 5. Let's read verse
[2:22:39] 28. You can read the entire chapter, but
[2:22:43] uh for time, let's just read verse 28.
[2:22:47] And the Lord heard the
[2:22:49] voice of of your words. Now Moses is
[2:22:53] telling the people now. You you will you
[2:22:56] will see here he go he's going back.
[2:22:58] He's telling the people everything that
[2:23:00] happened on on Mount Sana when we came
[2:23:02] out. You know this is what the Lord said
[2:23:04] to you and this is what you said to him
[2:23:08] and he heard your voice. He heard you
[2:23:10] when you said all that the Lord have
[2:23:13] said we will do. He's he's rehearsing
[2:23:16] those things to the people. Now listen
[2:23:18] to what he said. And the Lord heard the
[2:23:21] voice of your words when ye speak unto
[2:23:24] me. And the Lord said unto me, I have
[2:23:27] heard the
[2:23:29] voice of the words of this people which
[2:23:34] they have spoken unto
[2:23:36] them. They have well said all that ye
[2:23:41] have spoken.
[2:23:45] Oh, that there were such an heart in
[2:23:51] them. You
[2:23:53] see how how he realized that they
[2:23:56] misunderstood him. How I wish they had a
[2:23:59] heart to
[2:24:01] understand. How I wish we have a heart
[2:24:04] to understand what the message of the
[2:24:06] hour is.
[2:24:08] It's not all of these things that we try
[2:24:10] to make. We bring all our tribalistic
[2:24:12] thing into it and and and and
[2:24:15] unconverted and then thing flying over
[2:24:18] from from different beliefs and all of
[2:24:20] that.
[2:24:22] Oh, that there was such a heart in them,
[2:24:25] that they will fear
[2:24:28] me, and keep all my commandment
[2:24:33] always, that it might be well with
[2:24:36] them, and with their children forever.
[2:24:41] In a short sense, this is all I
[2:24:44] wanted. This is all I
[2:24:46] wanted. I was just saying something to
[2:24:49] get their heart.
[2:24:51] I was saying something to capture them.
[2:24:53] They misunderstood me. I heard
[2:24:55] everything they
[2:24:57] said. Oh, if there was such a heart in
[2:25:03] them. Oh, if we have a heart this
[2:25:06] morning
[2:25:09] to say, be it unto me according to your
[2:25:11] word.
[2:25:15] Oh, if we have a heart this
[2:25:18] morning, not to not to put the card
[2:25:20] before the house, not not to just be uh
[2:25:23] so so
[2:25:26] quick to mishandle whatever in this
[2:25:31] life,
[2:25:32] whatever, be it sickness, be it
[2:25:36] tribulation, be it trials, be it
[2:25:39] financial, whatever, whatever.
[2:25:44] that the
[2:25:45] Lord allowed you to deal
[2:25:49] with. He watch your attitude how you are
[2:25:53] hindering
[2:25:57] it. If he could have given it to anybody
[2:26:00] else, he will have but he have given it
[2:26:02] to you. How are you dealing with him?
[2:26:09] If you take God out of the picture, you
[2:26:11] will only see yourself. You will see the
[2:26:13] evil where people did. Oh, see what they
[2:26:15] did. Hey, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then
[2:26:18] God is nowhere in the picture. Oh, if we
[2:26:21] have such a
[2:26:28] heart, if we have such a
[2:26:35] heart, musicians, you can come
[2:26:40] There was such a heart in
[2:26:44] us. We get so carried away and and and
[2:26:47] and some of the things some of the
[2:26:49] things that I mean uh it's not like we
[2:26:52] were we were downtown Minneapolis
[2:26:53] preaching in Jesus name trying to win
[2:26:56] souls for Christ.
[2:27:01] Sometimes it's just our own uh h you
[2:27:04] know personal things that we I mean it's
[2:27:06] it's it's not like we we went down to S
[2:27:08] Somalia and say God let me and now Lord
[2:27:11] I'm in trouble. I'm in
[2:27:17] prison. There were people that went
[2:27:19] through things tough difficult things
[2:27:22] their family felt like they needed to
[2:27:24] preach the gospel. They wanted to win
[2:27:26] souls for Christ. All of those things
[2:27:29] are I mean it's it's it's so bad that
[2:27:32] it's it's not in some of our
[2:27:35] agenda but yet we are going
[2:27:38] through things of
[2:27:42] life dealing with family things dealing
[2:27:44] with uh you know life things that uh God
[2:27:49] in his divine
[2:27:52] wisdom have seen you fed
[2:27:57] Oh, if there is such a heart in us this
[2:28:06] morning. Oh, if there is such a heart in
[2:28:10] us this morning to be able to
[2:28:14] understand, just to be able to
[2:28:16] understand the desire of the father.
[2:28:20] See those men? They came around
[2:28:23] David. That was a
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:28] fugitive. They came around
[2:28:35] David and they
[2:28:37] understood that this man is the king of
[2:28:41] Israel. They understood the character.
[2:28:44] They understood the heart of David. and
[2:28:46] and and and those guys could put their
[2:28:48] life in
[2:28:52] jeopardy. They could go to
[2:28:54] mines, go down, fetch water, water that
[2:28:58] David would not even drink because he he
[2:29:00] just felt overwhelmed and feel all not
[2:29:04] qualified to drink that this man will
[2:29:06] risk their
[2:29:08] life. Oh, if there was such a heart in
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:21] us, you know, when I when I read those
[2:29:24] things, sometimes some of the things
[2:29:26] that catch my
[2:29:30] mind, I'm I'm going to save it for
[2:29:33] another time. I'll save it for another
[2:29:36] time. I'll save it for another time,
[2:29:38] people.
[2:29:42] On Wednesday night, we were talking
[2:29:44] about intentions. The word of God is
[2:29:46] sharper and two edges swore.
[2:29:50] Discerning the intent of your heart.
[2:29:54] That's what God is looking at. Your
[2:29:57] intentions matters to him. It speaks
[2:30:01] loud. Your body might be struggling.
[2:30:04] Your mind might be struggling. But where
[2:30:06] is your heart?
[2:30:08] Where is your heart? Only God has the
[2:30:12] skill to wait
[2:30:14] intentions. You can judge your intention
[2:30:17] from your
[2:30:18] mind. It's only God that can put your
[2:30:21] spirit on a scale and measure your
[2:30:31] intentions. This is just a prayer
[2:30:33] meeting this morning. Let's worship him
[2:30:35] now.
[2:30:39] Be it all to
[2:30:42] me according to your
[2:30:54] word. I can stand
[2:30:59] secure my heart.
[2:31:03] control that sets me
[2:31:07] free. Calling to you your word, oh
[2:31:13] Lord, be it all to
[2:31:16] me. Oh, be it all to
[2:31:22] me. I call into your
[2:31:27] word. I call into your promises.
[2:31:33] I can sense
[2:31:36] you gather upon my
[2:31:41] heart. This truth that will set me
[2:31:45] free. Calling to your word, oh
[2:31:50] Lord, be it all to
[2:31:54] me. Oh, be it onto me.
[2:32:00] I call into your
[2:32:04] word. I call into your promise,
[2:32:09] Lord. I can stand
[2:32:12] secure. Oh God, upon this heart of
[2:32:18] mine, there truth that will deliver
[2:32:22] me. Calling to your word, Lord.
[2:32:28] be it
[2:32:29] all to
[2:32:31] [Music]
[2:32:32] me. Let's sing that
[2:32:36] [Music]
[2:32:50] [Music]
[2:32:52] chorus. Think about it this morning,
[2:32:55] saints.
[2:32:59] We can be faithful to a
[2:33:02] church. You can be loyal to your
[2:33:10] [Music]
[2:33:12] pastor. Oh that we if we have such a
[2:33:17] heart Oh, if we have such a heart
[2:33:21] creating me in a new heart creating me.
[2:33:24] That's what I was thinking about.
[2:33:30] While the music plays softly now let's
[2:33:34] let's just think about it. Let's bring
[2:33:36] ourself to that
[2:33:38] place. Just think about that verse. Oh,
[2:33:41] if there was such a heart in
[2:33:43] me to understand all that he want me to
[2:33:50] do. Oh, if there was such a heart in
[2:33:56] me to understand why he allowed
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:13] this. Do you see why God has to send an
[2:34:16] Elijah message?
[2:34:19] [Music]
[2:34:21] Because the heart of the people, the
[2:34:22] people have gone through just a whole
[2:34:25] lot. Their heart was told between
[2:34:28] idolatry and between uh uh uh everything
[2:34:32] that Ahab has introduced to them, the
[2:34:35] worship of God and all of those things.
[2:34:41] The people were standing between two
[2:34:49] opinion. Cast me not
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:54] away from your presence, oh
[2:35:00] Lord. Take not your holy spirit from me.
[2:35:07] [Music]
[2:35:14] resto the joy of my
[2:35:19] salvation and renew the right spirit
[2:35:24] within
[2:35:27] me. Yes, Lord, cast me
[2:35:32] away from your presence.
[2:35:38] Oh, and take that your holy spirit from
[2:35:47] me.
[2:35:49] Restore unto
[2:35:51] me, the joy of my
[2:35:59] redemption.
[2:36:01] Spirit within me.
[2:36:07] create me a clean
[2:36:13] heart, oh
[2:36:17] Lord, and renew the right
[2:36:21] spirit within me.
[2:36:28] Create in me the clean
[2:36:34] heart, oh
[2:36:38] Lord, and renew the right
[2:36:42] spirit within
[2:36:46] me. Yes, Lord, please cast me not away
[2:36:52] from your presence.
[2:36:56] Oh no
[2:36:58] Jesus, take down your Holy Spirit from
[2:37:07] me.
[2:37:09] Restore all to
[2:37:19] me. Spirit with me.
[2:37:26] When John sent his disciples to go and
[2:37:28] ask
[2:37:29] Jesus, Jesus said this to him, "Blessed
[2:37:32] is he that is now offended in
[2:37:35] me." John, you might not understand what
[2:37:38] you're going through, but it's my
[2:37:41] word. Blessed is he that is not
[2:37:43] offended. I mean, when when we start
[2:37:45] being offended in our spirit because of
[2:37:48] what we going through, why me, Lord? Why
[2:37:51] not you?
[2:37:54] Why if God is just trusting
[2:38:00] you? He's just testing
[2:38:03] [Music]
[2:38:10] you. You see, because we do not rejoice
[2:38:14] in our trials, that's the reason why we
[2:38:17] don't know how to celebrate victory.
[2:38:20] We don't know how to testify when God do
[2:38:23] things for us. We don't know how to
[2:38:26] rejoice in his promises
[2:38:29] because we frown in our trials. We we uh
[2:38:33] I mean we we just misunderstand
[2:38:35] everything and uh and and and I mean
[2:38:38] it's it's it put us to such a place. It
[2:38:40] mess us up so bad that we get to such a
[2:38:43] place that even when God comes on the
[2:38:46] scene and brings the miracle and do the
[2:38:49] deliverance, we don't know how to
[2:38:51] rejoice in
[2:38:52] it. We don't rejoice in it
[2:38:55] long because we don't suffer long with
[2:38:58] the Lord. We don't suffer in his word
[2:39:01] and say, "Oh
[2:39:03] God, I love you. I thank you.
[2:39:07] [Music]
[2:39:30] Father, give us such a heart,
[2:39:32] Lord. Thank you, Father God, for Malachi
[2:39:35] 4.
[2:39:37] Thank you Lord for a prophet messenger
[2:39:39] Lord God. Thank you for the man from
[2:39:42] Kentucky that you send oh God Lord Jesus
[2:39:45] with a message Lord God to turn our
[2:39:47] hearts
[2:39:49] back to turn our hearts back Lord to
[2:39:52] give us the heart of God. The heart to
[2:39:55] be able to rejoice in truth. the heart
[2:39:58] of God, Father, to be able to oh God,
[2:40:01] rejoice in trial, Lord
[2:40:03] [Music]
[2:40:19] God. Because you see when you when you
[2:40:22] take a positive
[2:40:23] attitude, it create a mindset in you.
[2:40:28] It create a mindset that you are not
[2:40:30] misunderstanding things that are
[2:40:31] happening. Sometimes even people
[2:40:34] misunderstand their health. Oh, I I
[2:40:37] don't know what I've done. And then they
[2:40:39] go back and they start sessioning their
[2:40:40] life and looking for sin. It don't have
[2:40:43] to be sin. Sometime God just going to
[2:40:45] allow it to show that he's a
[2:40:50] healer. Why? Everything that God would
[2:40:52] trust us with have to be for one reason
[2:40:55] or another.
[2:40:57] Why can we think about it that maybe is
[2:40:59] for his glory? Glorify
[2:41:05] [Music]
[2:41:18] [Music]
[2:41:23] yourself. Dear father, we just want to
[2:41:26] thank you this afternoon. Thank you,
[2:41:28] Lord, for coming in a special way, Lord,
[2:41:30] to bless our
[2:41:32] fellowship, oh God. Thank you, precious
[2:41:34] Lord, for just speaking to
[2:41:38] us. You are the very one, oh God,
[2:41:40] Father, Lord, that came down on that
[2:41:42] mountain with thunders, Lord, and
[2:41:44] lightning, oh God,
[2:41:47] Father. And the stones on the mountain
[2:41:49] were rolling. The people got afraid and
[2:41:52] said not the let not the Lord speak to
[2:41:54] us lest Moses speak and uh God father
[2:41:58] you were the same one there Lord God
[2:42:00] Father standing and says sir blessed are
[2:42:04] the poor in
[2:42:06] spirit. Blessed are the
[2:42:10] meek. Blessed are you when men shall say
[2:42:13] all manner of evil against you.
[2:42:17] Rejoice, rejoice and be exceedingly
[2:42:20] [Music]
[2:42:29] glad. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus,
[2:42:32] because you are the same one, Lord, and
[2:42:34] the only one that was wanted to open the
[2:42:36] book and to lose those seals. So, Father
[2:42:38] God, you are the only one, oh God,
[2:42:41] Father, Lord Jesus, that was able to
[2:42:43] reveal the mysteries in this day. And
[2:42:46] those divine mystery truth your prophet
[2:42:49] said will literally turn our heart back.
[2:42:52] Is those divine mystery
[2:42:57] [Music]
[2:43:08] truth. Father we just want to thank you.
[2:43:12] Thank you Lord God because your word
