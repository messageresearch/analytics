[2:12] now we find out here notice in his
[2:15] shadow again the the lamb is to be kept
[2:18] up now this is not in Exodus 12 if
[2:21] you're Mark you're down Exodus 12 3-6
[2:23] the lamb must be kept up four days to be
[2:27] tried to see if it's worthy to go to the
[2:30] sacrifice yet must be tough examine over
[2:34] and over for four days to see if there's
[2:36] a blemish on it see if there's any
[2:38] sickness in it see if there's anything
[2:40] wrong with the lamb it must be kept up
[2:42] uh four days I know somebody might
[2:44] thought that's a little bit killer on
[2:46] the 14th but remember they tucked the
[2:48] Lamb on the 10th day of the month and
[2:49] killed it on the 14th day of the month
[2:51] see which has kept up for four days now
[2:55] Jesus God's name lamb went into
[2:58] Jerusalem and never came out again until
[3:01] after his death burial and Resurrection
[3:05] he was kept up under critics for four
[3:07] days and four nights amen how perfect
[3:10] that lamb was tied
[3:13] kept up for four days that's when pilate
[3:15] said I can find no fault in him another
[3:17] shadow of him no bone could be broken in
[3:20] him which is perfectly when they're
[3:22] cutting and killing his sacrifice he
[3:24] couldn't break a bone if it was it was
[3:25] refused and they already dropped the
[3:27] hammer back to break the bones in the
[3:29] legs of Christ when they said he's
[3:31] already dead that pierced his side and
[3:33] found blood and water notice again
[3:35] another great thing you're I wouldn't
[3:37] skip it by because he was represented in
[3:40] the offerings the meal offering I
[3:43] remember one time they had a school in
[3:45] the Bible called the school of the
[3:47] prophets
[3:48] and it was quite a school
[3:50] and we find out that Elijah went up
[3:53] there that school one day and they said
[3:55] we they prayed him to leave said when
[3:57] you're around here things are too
[3:58] straight so he wanted to get away
[4:00] and they went out to get him a dinner
[4:02] and a bunch of the priests went out or
[4:04] prophets to get some peas to make a
[4:07] dinner for him and when they did they've
[4:10] gathered a great big apron full of them
[4:11] and when they come back it was wild
[4:13] gourds which was poison and they told
[4:16] him into the pot and the pots began to
[4:18] boil and then somebody said alas there's
[4:21] death in the pot now we can't even eat
[4:24] and Elijah said bring me a handful of
[4:26] meals
[4:27] and he tucked the kneel and threw it
[4:29] into the pot and said eat the pots
[4:32] healed
[4:33] the meal offering was Christ
[4:35] every Burr had to be set the same and
[4:38] every little piece of Neil had to be
[4:40] ground the same for the me offering
[4:41] showing that he is the Healer he
[4:44] substitutes and takes away death and
[4:46] puts life for the truth hallelujah
[4:50] comes in life comes in
[4:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[4:55] forever
[4:56] and where there was death there became
[4:59] life because that Christ was brought in
[5:02] that meal offers what a great lessons
[5:04] that these things to be if we take time
[5:06] to break them out no no not one word of
[5:11] the Shadows fail
[5:14] not one word ever failed of the Shadow
[5:16] everything typed perfectly he's God's
[5:20] chosen place of worship and God's name
[5:23] is given to him
[5:25] he is God's place of worship and God's
[5:27] name is given to him he is the word of
[5:29] God and he is the name of God
[5:32] he's both the word of God and the name
[5:35] of God
[5:36] he was a word made flesh he was the word
[5:39] of God Lamb of God name of God and was
[5:43] God
[5:44] that's what he was the Chosen and only
[5:47] place of worship to God
[5:50] God refuses any other place besides in
[5:53] Jesus Christ
[5:54] you cannot worship him anywhere he said
[5:57] in vain they do worship me teaching for
[5:59] a Doctrine the Commandments of man the
[6:01] day we have Creeds dogmas and everything
[6:03] it teaches this is a way of that is way
[6:05] and Jesus said I am the way the truth
[6:08] and the life and no man can come to God
[6:10] except by me in other words I am the
[6:13] door to the Sheepfold
[6:15] all without her thieves
[6:17] he is the only approach he's the door
[6:21] he's the way the truth the life
[6:24] all that there is the only entrance the
[6:26] only place the only worship The Only
[6:28] Name
[6:29] everything is tied to Jesus Christ
[6:33] all the Old Testament is tied to in the
[6:35] New Testament tied to and the church
[6:37] today is tied to him by the word of his
[6:39] commandment
[6:40] there's not another place or another
[6:42] name or anywhere where God ever promised
[6:44] to meet a man only in Jesus Christ his
[6:47] chosen place of worship notice
[6:51] God has promised to meet his worshipers
[6:53] and only this one please and that is of
[6:56] his own choosing not of our choosing not
[6:59] of our thinking but of his thank you his
[7:01] choosing
[7:03] and it would be the place where he put
[7:06] his name where he chose so we find out
[7:08] that we find where his name was what he
[7:11] chose by his own choosing now that we
[7:14] have found the place he put his name
[7:16] that is in Christ Jesus and there is no
[7:19] other place or no other name are you
[7:21] satisfied of that say Amen
[7:24] now the thing of it is if we find where
[7:26] the place is
[7:29] that's worship place is nowhere accepted
[7:33] only in Christ you can repent
[7:36] you can do that but you're not
[7:38] worshiping it you're asking for pardon
[7:40] Peter said on the day of Pentecost when
[7:42] they've seen them all speaking with
[7:44] tongues and great signs and wonders
[7:45] taking place they begin to laugh the
[7:47] church didn't said these men are full of
[7:49] new wine they act like drunk people look
[7:51] married the Virgin all of them are
[7:54] together 120 of them and they were
[7:56] staggered like drunk men and speaking in
[7:59] tongues and carrying on he said these
[8:01] men are full of new wine but Peter's
[8:02] standing up said man and brethren
[8:05] these men are not full of new wine
[8:07] or this is just a third hour today but
[8:09] this is that we just spoke about by the
[8:11] prophet Joel and it shall come to pass
[8:13] in the last day saith God I pour out my
[8:15] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[8:17] daughters shall prophesy upon my hands
[8:19] maids and made servant will I pour out
[8:21] of my spirit I'll show signs in the
[8:23] heavens above and on Earth fire pillars
[8:25] of fire Vapors of smoke it shall come to
[8:27] pass before the great and terrible day
[8:28] of the Lord shall come to whosoever
[8:30] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[8:31] shall be saved when they heard this they
[8:34] were pricked in their heart and said man
[8:36] and brother what can we do Peter said
[8:39] repent every one of you
[8:41] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[8:44] Christ for the remission of your sins
[8:45] and you shall receive the gift of the
[8:47] Holy Ghost
[8:48] for the promises that all future
[8:50] Generations
[8:51] now we find that now we want to find how
[8:55] we get into him
[8:57] how do we get into this place of worship
[8:59] First Corinthians 12 settles it
[9:03] four by one spirit
[9:07] not by one church not by one Creed not
[9:10] by One Pastor not by one Bishop not by
[9:14] one priest but by one Holy Spirit
[9:18] we are all
[9:20] ties into one body
[9:23] which is the body of Jesus Christ and
[9:25] subject to every gift that lays in that
[9:27] bodies yes sir no joining no reciting of
[9:31] Creeds no pumping up letting down hands
[9:33] shaking another but by birth we are
[9:36] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[9:39] amen
[9:42] by one Holy Spirit
[9:45] we are all baptized into one body
[9:48] and what is that body in the beginning
[9:51] was the word and the Word was with God
[9:53] and the Word was God and the Word was
[9:55] made flesh and dwelt Among Us how can we
[9:58] be in that body and deny one word of it
[10:00] and place it all somewhere else
[10:02] that's not even in the body how can we
[10:05] ever do it
[10:06] God's chosen place notice I'm when you
[10:11] are truly baptized into him
[10:13] the true evidence is that you believe
[10:17] him the word
[10:20] how can you be a part of him and then
[10:23] tonight how can I deny my hand be in my
[10:25] hand
[10:25] if they're if I do something mentally
[10:27] wrong with me
[10:29] and how can I uh if there's something
[10:31] mentally wrong with me deny that's my
[10:33] hand so now that's my foot there's
[10:35] something spiritually wrong with the
[10:36] believer that denies any word that God
[10:39] ever said and promise is something
[10:42] spiritually wrong with that so-called
[10:44] believer
[10:45] you can't deny one letter of him because
[10:48] you have become a part of the same you
[10:51] are part of him because you're baptized
[10:54] into him
[10:55] by the Holy Spirit has brought you into
[10:58] the body of Jesus Christ what a
[11:01] beautiful thing God had a certain place
[11:02] to met he met Abraham and there Abraham
[11:06] worshiped all down to the Testament and
[11:08] his promised work will be interpreted In
[11:12] You by him
[11:14] did you get that the word that he
[11:17] promised
[11:18] to fulfill in the day that you're living
[11:21] in you will be a written Epistle of God
[11:25] rid of all man not what you claim but
[11:29] what God does to you you will speak out
[11:31] louder than anything you could claim
[11:33] [Applause]
[11:34] God said these signs shall follow them
[11:37] that believe
[11:38] that speaks to you
[11:40] he spoke of this age what would be now
[11:42] the Believers at this age has to believe
[11:45] this
[11:46] what he promised today
[11:48] just the same as had to come into the
[11:49] ark to be saved go out of Egypt to be
[11:51] saved they have to come into Christ to
[11:54] be saved now into the word message
[11:57] that he's the same yesterday today and
[11:59] forever
[12:00] how do you get into it by baptism
[12:02] baptism of what water by the Holy Ghost
[12:06] one Spirit we're all baptized into this
[12:09] one body
[12:10] and his promised word he will not you
[12:13] won't have to interpret it
[12:15] he will interpret it through you what
[12:18] you are doing what he promised to do the
[12:21] church that follows him will be so much
[12:23] like him until the people are no look at
[12:25] Peter and John when he was questioned
[12:27] about healing a man at the gate called
[12:29] Beautiful they said they perceived those
[12:31] priesthood that they were both ignorant
[12:34] and unlearned man but they take notice
[12:36] that they had been with Jesus
[12:39] because what they were doing the things
[12:42] that he did
[12:44] you must be about the father's business
[12:46] and today it must be the same I remember
[12:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[12:50] forever for God meets you in him the
[12:54] only place there is for it that is where
[12:57] he has chosen to put his name
[13:01] in Jesus Jesus is the name of God
[13:04] remember father son Holy Ghost is titles
[13:08] to the name Jesus Christ
[13:11] when Matthew said go therefore teach All
[13:13] Nations baptize them and to the name of
[13:15] the father of the son and of the Holy
[13:18] Ghost how it's been misinterpreted and
[13:20] say in the name of the father name of
[13:21] the son name of the Holy Ghost it's not
[13:23] even written
[13:24] it's in the name singular of the father
[13:27] son Holy Ghost father is not a name Sons
[13:30] not an eve Holy Ghost is not a name it's
[13:32] a title ten days later Peter stood up
[13:35] and said repent every one of you be
[13:36] baptized the name of Jesus Christ
[13:39] told him not to do he did what he told
[13:42] him to do the name of the father Son and
[13:44] the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:46] every person in the New Testament was
[13:48] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[13:50] Christ not one person in the Bible was
[13:53] ever baptized in the titles of father
[13:55] son Holy Ghost
[13:57] man that never did come into existence
[13:59] until the nazia Creed was put on it and
[14:02] I see a room
[14:03] there was an order of the Catholic
[14:05] Church found Vindicated the same thing
[14:07] in the catechism
[14:08] I've got it
[14:10] that's right
[14:11] facts of our faith and so forth that it
[14:14] absolutely is a Roman Catholic Creed
[14:19] they'll tell you it's not the Bible but
[14:20] they say they have power to change them
[14:23] words if they wish you because of the
[14:24] Pope
[14:25] are different Jesus Christ is the same
[14:28] yesterday today and forever and
[14:30] whosoever shall take one word out of
[14:32] this Bible said Jesus or put one word in
[14:34] it his part will be taken from The Book
[14:36] of Life One Word not a sentence or
[14:39] paragraph
[14:41] but a word whosoever shall take one word
[14:45] in the beginning God fortified his
[14:47] people with his word one word
[14:50] misconstrued caused every death ever
[14:52] heartache every sorrow
[14:54] Eve she never broke a sentence she broke
[14:57] a word
[14:58] when Jesus come in the middle of the
[14:59] book that's the first of the book when
[15:01] Jesus come in the middle of a book what
[15:03] did he say it is written that man shall
[15:05] not live by bread alone but by every
[15:07] word
[15:09] that proceedeth thou the mouth of God in
[15:11] the last of the book Revelations the
[15:13] 22nd chapter the 18th verse the very
[15:16] last part of the Bible Jesus speaks
[15:18] himself said I'll testify that if any
[15:20] man shall take one word out of this book
[15:22] or add one word to it his part will be
[15:25] taken out of the book of life because
[15:28] he's a false prophet
[15:30] and has misconstrue the people
[15:33] and their black will be accounted to his
[15:36] hand of doing so we must keep that one
[15:40] place of worship that is Jesus Christ
[15:42] the word the same yesterday today and
[15:44] forever
[15:45] amen
[15:46] all right
[15:48] remember there's no other meeting place
[15:50] to worship
[15:51] not a place God chose it
[15:53] John way back younger at the time
[15:57] between the New and Old Testament listen
[15:59] close now
[16:01] notice closely John that great eagle
[16:05] come flying from the Wilderness one day
[16:08] his great Wings spread he lay down on
[16:11] the bank of the Jordan
[16:13] Hallelujah a great Eagle prophet
[16:17] that bridge the way between the Old and
[16:18] New Testament and he called him from
[16:21] right and left
[16:24] he was calling a day of repentance
[16:26] I work on the Pharisees and Sadducees
[16:29] out he said don't begin to say within
[16:32] yourself we have Abraham to our father
[16:34] because I'll tell you God is able these
[16:36] stones to write your name
[16:39] oh my
[16:41] God when he began to throw his gospel
[16:44] out and saying there stands one among
[16:46] you who you don't know I'm not yet
[16:48] identified but I'll know him when he
[16:50] comes
[16:51] I'm not worthy to lose his shoe but
[16:54] he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[16:56] and Fire and your man is in his hands
[16:58] he'll thoroughly purchase Lord he'll
[17:00] burn the chapters
[17:03] that great gospel Eagle sitting there as
[17:05] he crowed out his great threats and the
[17:09] don't come out or Herod they Emperor at
[17:12] that time proctimator mirrors

[17:19] Eagle sitting there and holding this
[17:20] piece of that
[17:21] some of them said don't you preach on
[17:23] marriage and divorce now John those air
[17:24] says Herod walk that up in his face and
[17:27] said it's not lawful for you to have
[17:31] while he wasn't he was that eagle from
[17:33] the Wilderness he wasn't trained under
[17:36] man's scares and threats of some
[17:38] denomination but he was trained under
[17:40] the power of almighty God to know what
[17:42] would be
[17:43] he knowed the identification of the
[17:46] Messiah
[17:49] the word means praise our God don't get
[17:51] scared I've never hurt nobody yet
[17:54] I'm not excited I know right where I am
[17:58] holding out think of him that big eagle
[18:01] flying out there and sitting down he
[18:03] said I'll know him when he comes one day
[18:06] you were standing there preaching the
[18:07] priest was across the other side said
[18:09] you mean there come a time the daily
[18:10] sacrifice will be taken away this great
[18:12] template we're building all the work we
[18:14] put on our speak denomination he said
[18:16] there'll come a time when all that'll be
[18:18] done away
[18:20] and treat me you're a false prophet and
[18:23] he looked around he said behold there he
[18:26] is there's
[18:31] just a lamb the real lamb that takes
[18:34] away the sin of the world
[18:36] [Music]
[18:38] he didn't say here comes the method he

[18:45] takes away the sin of the world and all
[18:48] his safeties on there is is in that Lamb
[18:51] of God get him alone is salvation

[19:12] salvation
[19:14] that's a rock I stand on John identified
[19:17] him
[19:18] he said I didn't know him when I saw him
[19:21] come walking up but out there where I
[19:23] got my schooling yeah
[19:25] not in the Seminary like his daddy did
[19:27] not as a priest train but in the
[19:31] wilderness
[19:32] why was in the Theological Seminary of
[19:35] almighty God Amen waiting for God's word
[19:39] not what some group of men had hatched
[19:41] up
[19:43] but what God had said about it
[19:45] and when John looked up and saw the
[19:47] Spirit coming he said I bear a record
[19:50] this is him
[19:54] oh my there's your place of worship

[20:50] light
[20:53] Malachi 3

[21:00] identified Jesus as being the only one
[21:03] the lamb all other Lambs that priest was
[21:06] talking about all them other things is
[21:07] foolish yeah was the lamb the man with
[21:10] the great Shining Light that Jesus said

[21:15] Malachi 3 said I'll send my messenger
[21:18] before my face to prepare the way
