[59:44] uh and and encourage you as we uh
[59:48] uh we have gone almost 10 days into the
[59:52] into the new year uh
[59:55] and uh we are having expectations we are
[1:00:01] anxiously
[1:00:02] you know trying to grasp into the year
[1:00:05] to see what it will be we can only hope
[1:00:08] that uh it will get better amen
[1:00:11] we can only hope that it might
[1:00:14] get better but when we look at prophecy
[1:00:19] and we look at a lot of the things that
[1:00:21] are happening in the rhinos
[1:00:24] the only promise that we have as
[1:00:27] children of god is to get ourselves
[1:00:29] ready
[1:00:30] amen is to get ourselves ready
[1:00:34] to meet the lord amen whether by the
[1:00:36] weight of the rapture
[1:00:38] or whether by the way of the grave
[1:00:41] we have to get ourselves ready we have
[1:00:43] to live every day
[1:00:44] as if the law was coming the next
[1:00:46] meeting and we should also
[1:00:48] make plans for our future go to school
[1:00:52] you know uh build your houses you know
[1:00:55] change your car or as you your car will
[1:00:57] break down the road and the call will
[1:00:59] give you problems
[1:01:00] praise the lord amen
[1:01:03] we must we must plan our future but we
[1:01:06] must have
[1:01:07] our soul so ready because
[1:01:11] anything can come upon us praise the
[1:01:14] lord
[1:01:16] amen and we know what uh you know what
[1:01:19] the accident
[1:01:20] was to the children of israel so we want
[1:01:23] to talk about
[1:01:24] that a little bit you know uh uh
[1:01:27] god taking his people to
[1:01:30] the promised land amen taking them out
[1:01:33] of bondage
[1:01:34] out of the egyptian bondage and carrying
[1:01:36] them over to the promised land
[1:01:38] but what i want to do all my inspiration
[1:01:41] on
[1:01:41] is the one that is leading this
[1:01:45] exeter praise the lord
[1:01:48] that's the one out that's word i want to
[1:01:51] make my emphasis
[1:01:52] because the same one that led that
[1:01:54] exeter
[1:01:55] is the same one that is leading this
[1:01:57] exeter
[1:01:59] praise the lord amen and there is
[1:02:01] something about ignoring your leader
[1:02:05] if you know your leader praise the lord
[1:02:08] then you can learn to know how he's
[1:02:11] leading you
[1:02:12] and where he's leading you
[1:02:15] praise the lord now if you have a leader
[1:02:18] or you think in your mind that this man
[1:02:22] is the leader
[1:02:23] amen and uh and and where you try
[1:02:27] you try to take your inspiration or your
[1:02:29] instruction from him
[1:02:30] when actually there is another one there
[1:02:33] there is the leader
[1:02:34] you your son you also found out that you
[1:02:36] will start having conflict
[1:02:40] praise the lord you assume founder that
[1:02:43] you start having conflict
[1:02:54] well someone is sending
[1:02:58] ntc did i greet you yes
[1:03:02] i did i can forgive my own
[1:03:06] mother-in-law
[1:03:10] okay so uh
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:15] so we realize here that
[1:03:24] god has always
[1:03:29] use men for that is the purpose that man
[1:03:32] was were created
[1:03:34] man was created to be god agent to be a
[1:03:37] partner with god he says let us make man
[1:03:40] in our own image praise the lord
[1:03:43] and right on god have used men
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:48] for for different purpose
[1:03:52] and and god through the ages we
[1:03:56] know about moses and abraham our father
[1:04:00] the patriarch we know about joseph how
[1:04:03] god sent him down to egypt to be able to
[1:04:06] prepare
[1:04:07] for for the children of israel and and
[1:04:10] all of that so
[1:04:12] god have always used man praise the lord
[1:04:16] but god has always been in control
[1:04:20] you know when god raised up a man or god
[1:04:23] gave
[1:04:23] a man an instruction or a responsibility
[1:04:27] he don't leave that man to himself no he
[1:04:30] gave the man
[1:04:31] the the responsibility to do a setting
[1:04:34] work but he's the one that is
[1:04:35] in control he's the one that is leading
[1:04:42] praise the lord he is the one that is
[1:04:45] leading now we know
[1:04:47] uh uh back to our scripture reference
[1:04:50] here we know
[1:04:50] that this whole exeter a
[1:04:54] story about coming out of egypt we know
[1:04:57] it goes
[1:04:57] all the way back to abraham we can pick
[1:04:59] it up from there
[1:05:00] but the the mission the exit of mission
[1:05:05] of coming out of egypt and getting over
[1:05:07] to the promised land we know the whole
[1:05:09] scene starts
[1:05:10] from exodus chapter 3. praise the lord
[1:05:14] and in exodus chapter 3 the bible says
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:18] and god fought a way to be
[1:05:22] able to get moses attention
[1:05:25] praise the lord and the way he did it
[1:05:29] was to calm down in the form of a light
[1:05:32] in the form of a burning butch
[1:05:36] praise the lord make no mistake
[1:05:39] it was god in the form of a light
[1:05:46] are we together it was god in the form
[1:05:50] of a fire the bush was on fire
[1:05:53] the bible says our god is a consuming
[1:05:56] fire
[1:05:59] it was not just a fire that god spoke
[1:06:02] through
[1:06:02] it was god are you kidding me
[1:06:06] amen it was not just god allowed
[1:06:09] the bush to be on fire so he can talk
[1:06:12] through no
[1:06:12] it was god in the form of a burning fire
[1:06:20] amen praise the lord
[1:06:23] that's the god we serve
[1:06:30] and i'm saying that to say that it must
[1:06:33] not be difficult
[1:06:36] it must not be difficult for us to
[1:06:39] believe
[1:06:41] that this almighty god we self
[1:06:48] can be able to humble himself
[1:06:53] it must not be difficult it's difficult
[1:06:55] for you
[1:06:56] and myself we struggle to humble
[1:06:58] ourselves
[1:06:59] but not god amen
[1:07:03] and because he's the creator he can make
[1:07:06] himself
[1:07:07] whatever way he wanted
[1:07:10] amen people struggle with theology to
[1:07:14] believe that jesus was god
[1:07:16] that god can be men it's the problem is
[1:07:18] with you
[1:07:19] and myself we struggle to humble
[1:07:22] ourselves
[1:07:22] all because of the same nature of pride
[1:07:30] but not god
[1:07:33] let me prove it to you this let me prove
[1:07:34] it to you
[1:07:36] do you know that god humbled himself
[1:07:39] to come by your bedside this morning to
[1:07:41] wake you up
[1:07:46] you think it was your alarm clock carry
[1:07:49] your alarm clock to the mark
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:55] take an alarm clock to the mark and see
[1:07:57] if it will wake those people up
[1:08:06] that's the god we self
[1:08:13] that's the reason why the joy
[1:08:16] in serving god is fine
[1:08:21] in humbleness that's the secret
[1:08:24] of god if you want to know him that's
[1:08:28] how you will know him
[1:08:33] you will have to humble yourself
[1:08:36] humble your thoughts your idea
[1:08:44] praise the lord
[1:08:48] you don't believe that god woke you up
[1:08:49] this morning
[1:08:53] do you have problem with that
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:04] if you really have problem with that you
[1:09:06] should pray tonight and say lord don't
[1:09:08] wake me up
[1:09:13] praise the lord sincerely do it
[1:09:18] i will meet you on the other side
[1:09:24] are we together praise the lord
[1:09:28] but that's that's god he came down
[1:09:32] to be able to get moses attention
[1:09:40] and when he grabbed moses attention he
[1:09:43] told moses for i have come down
[1:09:45] that's right i have come down
[1:09:49] and i'll go with you and you know and we
[1:09:51] know the story there about exodus
[1:09:53] chapter three
[1:09:54] and uh uh you know and and you know
[1:09:57] that's that's what the exodus
[1:09:59] that's where it begins and moses we know
[1:10:02] the story he went down there
[1:10:04] and and you know and when moses went
[1:10:06] down
[1:10:07] because he was commissioned by god he
[1:10:10] started
[1:10:11] speaking
[1:10:15] with a personal pronoun let my people go
[1:10:19] amen he brought the message of god
[1:10:22] to the egyptian but he was talking to
[1:10:26] to pharaoh let my people go
[1:10:29] and uh
[1:10:34] you know and we we know all the story
[1:10:36] the play came and everything
[1:10:38] and they got on their way but
[1:10:41] because god have used man
[1:10:46] in in the exit and in all the great
[1:10:48] delivery
[1:10:49] we know about something you know his
[1:10:51] strength we know
[1:10:52] about david his uh his his military
[1:10:55] knowledge
[1:10:56] you know the the the strength he had to
[1:10:58] bring goliath down
[1:11:00] and all of these men of the scripture
[1:11:02] because
[1:11:03] god have used them in extraordinary way
[1:11:07] sometimes it's high you know the the
[1:11:11] the the the him and she covered the fact
[1:11:14] that it is god that is doing the work
[1:11:19] praise the lord and where we struggle
[1:11:22] sometimes
[1:11:23] and and which of course is obvious
[1:11:25] because god is a spirit
[1:11:29] amen and and and uh and
[1:11:32] uh being humans we we we have contact
[1:11:36] with our five senses
[1:11:37] you know so it's it's uh it is easy for
[1:11:40] us to follow
[1:11:41] a one that we can see
[1:11:44] praise the lord and that's the reason
[1:11:47] why god
[1:11:48] will always bring us a leader he would
[1:11:50] send us a preacher he would send us
[1:11:52] a a prophet he would send us a you know
[1:11:54] a deliverer he will
[1:11:55] always use a man
[1:11:59] but the thing there is that he is the
[1:12:02] one
[1:12:02] that is leading
[1:12:08] he is the one he is the leader
[1:12:16] praise the lord genesis chapter 3 prove
[1:12:19] it to us when god came down he met adam
[1:12:22] and eve in their situation
[1:12:25] praise the lord brought a a alarm in and
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:29] and redeemed them back to himself
[1:12:32] praise the lord and the bible says he
[1:12:35] led them out of the garden of eden
[1:12:39] but he was the one that was leading
[1:12:44] he rubbed them in the sheepskin to cover
[1:12:46] the the
[1:12:47] shame and he led him into the wilderness
[1:12:50] i mean out of the garden of eden sorry
[1:12:53] but he was the one that was leading
[1:12:57] praise the lord now look here he led
[1:13:00] them out of the garden of
[1:13:01] of eden they went out of the garden of
[1:13:03] eden king killed abel
[1:13:05] god was right there and said king what
[1:13:07] have you done
[1:13:12] he did not send them and say okay your
[1:13:14] goal because the evil you have done your
[1:13:16] goal
[1:13:17] i'm going to stay right here in this
[1:13:18] eating i made it to stay right here no
[1:13:25] they went out of eden king and abraham
[1:13:27] made a sacrifice god came down he
[1:13:29] honored abel's sacrifice he refused
[1:13:32] king's sacrifice can't care ever god
[1:13:34] called king to justice
[1:13:37] why because he was always there
[1:13:46] he was always there he was he's he was
[1:13:49] always there he's the one that is
[1:13:50] leading
[1:13:52] danger of the exeter
[1:13:58] praise the lord amen god will always get
[1:14:02] a man in his hands
[1:14:04] but he will not leave us in the hands of
[1:14:08] men
[1:14:10] praise the lord no he will not leave us
[1:14:14] in the hands of men because uh uh
[1:14:17] the arm of flesh will fail but the arm
[1:14:20] of the lord
[1:14:21] will never fail praise the lord
[1:14:25] the alma of the lord will never fail now
[1:14:28] you might you might have heard
[1:14:30] uh this and now that's that's what i
[1:14:33] wanted to go into
[1:14:34] but uh i would not you know i would not
[1:14:37] uh
[1:14:38] they're going uh drag you into there
[1:14:41] because
[1:14:42] it would take me a little bit here let's

[1:15:08] he was a runaway
[1:15:11] soldier amen a man that was
[1:15:14] scared to death
[1:15:17] they have killed an egyptian straight
[1:15:20] into the wilderness
[1:15:21] and he changed his career you know from
[1:15:24] a military general he became a shepherd
[1:15:27] never want to do nothing with that it
[1:15:29] was the angel of god

[1:16:14] god for a prophetic message that he has
[1:16:16] given to us
[1:16:18] but the one that is leading the angel
[1:16:21] of this exeter is the lord jesus christ
[1:16:27] praise the lord is the lord jesus christ
[1:16:30] so you see when people when people start
[1:16:33] having problem
[1:16:36] with the message and they start having
[1:16:39] problem with the messenger
[1:16:42] to go back to the wall to make it an
[1:16:46] excuse
[1:16:47] to go back to egypt they didn't know the
[1:16:50] leader
[1:16:53] they did not know the leader of this
[1:16:56] accident
[1:16:58] praise the lord why was koran and dayton
[1:17:02] and all of those people
[1:17:03] arguing in the wilderness why because
[1:17:06] they knew something about moses
[1:17:10] amen they knew that he was a runaway
[1:17:12] soldier
[1:17:15] so they could find all of his fault but
[1:17:18] the error they made was
[1:17:20] he was not the leader of the exeter
[1:17:24] the leader of the exeter was the angel
[1:17:26] of the coveted
[1:17:28] it was the angel of the coveting
[1:17:35] praise the lord so they can bring out
[1:17:38] moses fox
[1:17:39] they can go and gather the people talk
[1:17:41] against moses
[1:17:43] and all of that praise the lord
[1:17:53] while we humans is hard for us to learn
[1:17:56] praise the lord amen they did
[1:17:59] all of that
[1:18:05] and god came down we know the story he
[1:18:08] brought the judgment opened the earth
[1:18:10] swallowed quran and dayton and his
[1:18:12] people praise the lord
[1:18:17] just to be able to witness to the
[1:18:20] congregation
[1:18:22] that this man moses he's just an etude
[1:18:25] in my hand
[1:18:26] i am the leader
[1:18:30] praise the lord i am the one leading
[1:18:33] this exeter
[1:18:38] and that's what i want to say to you and
[1:18:40] encourage you
[1:18:42] as we're going into a year that we don't
[1:18:44] know what it's going to bring
[1:18:46] amen last year
[1:18:49] 2020 we
[1:18:54] begin the year like this never knew that
[1:18:57] we would have gone
[1:18:59] uh about 10
[1:19:02] or so months with max on our face
[1:19:05] we don't know the next one whether that
[1:19:07] uh you know
[1:19:08] sheet or combat will be wearing over our
[1:19:10] head
[1:19:11] but whatever it is let's know who is the
[1:19:14] one leading us
[1:19:16] praise the lord amen
[1:19:20] amen moses never did nothing it was the
[1:19:23] angel of god that's right
[1:19:26] and he was the one that led israel by
[1:19:28] the pillar of fire by night the pillar
[1:19:30] of cloud by day
[1:19:31] i believe he's still leading on we know
[1:19:36] that was the angel of the coveting
[1:19:41] is that right it was the lugas
[1:19:45] or christ amen christ the logos is the
[1:19:49] sin the christ means the anointed one
[1:19:52] that's what we talk about false christs
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] but the lord god was that light
[1:19:58] in the beginning amen
[1:20:02] in the beginning that light when god the
[1:20:04] great internal god
[1:20:06] condemns himself to take a
[1:20:09] form so you see right from the beginning
[1:20:14] even in creation he led creation
[1:20:17] he led a life in eden he led a
[1:20:21] a a enoch into a rapture
[1:20:24] he led noah through a flaw
[1:20:28] he led abraham to a land whose maker
[1:20:32] and vader is god he's always the leader
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:39] he's always the leader
[1:20:43] and he's the one that is leading today
[1:20:49] praise the lord he's the one that is
[1:20:52] leading
[1:20:53] today and that's the reason why
[1:20:56] we must keep our eyes on jesus
[1:21:01] for he is the altar and the finisher
[1:21:05] of our faith praise the lord
[1:21:08] we must keep our eyes on jesus as much
[1:21:11] as we appreciate men
[1:21:12] we must keep our eyes on jesus
[1:21:19] look around the church today when people
[1:21:22] will make excuses why they would not go
[1:21:24] to church and why they would not serve
[1:21:26] god
[1:21:27] what do they use to make excuses oh this
[1:21:30] other pastor did this
[1:21:31] oh the people in the church did this
[1:21:33] it's just all human element why can't
[1:21:35] you realize that men will fail
[1:21:40] so you have really never come to a true
[1:21:42] experience
[1:21:44] when you're using failures for the
[1:21:47] reason why
[1:21:49] you will not set a god that will never
[1:21:51] fail
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:55] praise the lord people going into uh
[1:21:58] becoming eight years and
[1:22:00] and all sorts of things and you know
[1:22:02] blaming christians
[1:22:04] people that call themselves christians
[1:22:05] they are doing this they are calling
[1:22:06] themselves you just limit yourself
[1:22:10] you've been keeping your hairs down live
[1:22:12] for your eyes
[1:22:29] because he is the angel
[1:22:32] of the coveted
[1:22:36] that's the god we serve amen
[1:22:40] and like i said before that's the
[1:22:42] greatness of our god like paul says
[1:22:44] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:22:48] great is the mystery of godliness that
[1:22:51] the great
[1:22:52] god that we serve can make himself
[1:22:56] into into the form of his very creature
[1:23:02] god now wanting to leave his creation
[1:23:06] to man that is limited
[1:23:10] look he's the god that has the plane he
[1:23:13] he playing all of these things from the
[1:23:15] foundation of the world he has the
[1:23:16] blueprint in his hands
[1:23:21] praise the lord he has the plan of every
[1:23:25] dispensation
[1:23:26] every generation so he cannot just
[1:23:30] leave it to man
[1:23:33] no matter how deep that man is to god
[1:23:37] how much god revealed to him we will
[1:23:40] stay calm shut because
[1:23:42] god be with us by dispensation
[1:23:50] but he has the whole program in his
[1:23:52] hands
[1:23:55] praise the lord amen now if moses
[1:24:00] was the angel of the exeter
[1:24:04] the children of israel was going to
[1:24:06] perish when moses
[1:24:08] went on the mountain and said goodbye
[1:24:13] amen praise the lord
[1:24:16] when he walked on the mountain and said
[1:24:18] goodbye he looked over to the promised
[1:24:20] land
[1:24:21] and the bible said he said goodbye the
[1:24:22] angels took him away
[1:24:24] they were going to they were going to
[1:24:28] perish
[1:24:31] they were going to perish
[1:24:40] but the bible reads that after
[1:24:43] the seven of the lord moses died
[1:24:48] god rose up another man by the name of
[1:24:51] joshua
[1:24:53] praise the lord amen and that is the
[1:24:57] same thing we have however
[1:24:58] people claiming joshua ministry no
[1:25:04] it's the same angel of the covenant that
[1:25:06] is the reason why
[1:25:08] before joshua could step into his
[1:25:10] commission
[1:25:12] that same angel that was leading the
[1:25:14] children of israel
[1:25:15] in the form of pillow fight and pillow
[1:25:18] of cloud
[1:25:18] he came in the form of a man
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:26] and joshua drew his sword and said are
[1:25:29] you for us or are you against us
[1:25:33] he says i'm the angel
[1:25:37] i'm the angel of the covenant joshua
[1:25:41] bowed down because he know this is the
[1:25:43] leader
[1:25:45] praise the lord that i will tell you
[1:25:47] that joshua was properly taught by moses
[1:25:52] because if joshua was not taught by
[1:25:54] moses he would be so greedy for power
[1:25:57] and since i'm the one that is in charge
[1:26:02] he would have been as stubborn as balaam
[1:26:06] when god was speaking to him he was even
[1:26:09] warring and arguing with god
[1:26:12] it shows that moses taught joshua
[1:26:18] that look the one that is leading us
[1:26:21] the one you see going over the cam in
[1:26:24] that form of
[1:26:25] light is the almighty god
[1:26:30] praise the lord is the almighty god
[1:26:36] he's the angel of
[1:26:39] this exeter you know that is the reason
[1:26:43] why
[1:26:45] we are setting we're going to make it
[1:26:50] amen great men may fall
[1:26:53] man with great ministry may fall and get
[1:26:56] out of the way but we are setting
[1:27:02] because we know the one that is leading
[1:27:04] or he knows the way.
[1:27:08] praise the lord amen
[1:27:12] just like god use moses god
[1:27:15] use great men praise the lord god used
[1:27:18] the prophet of god for this hour
[1:27:21] and that's where just like i said people
[1:27:24] are making their mistake
[1:27:28] found in little thoughts and and you
[1:27:31] know and and
[1:27:32] making excuses
[1:27:36] to them they are sold to hell
[1:27:42] because you did not identify who is
[1:27:46] the angel of this exodus
[1:27:53] obey the voice of the angel moses never
[1:27:56] performed
[1:27:57] one miracle it was the angel of god
[1:28:02] that went before moses
[1:28:06] praise the lord amen
[1:28:09] it was the angel of god that went before
[1:28:12] moses he did not perform one miracle
[1:28:16] jesus says i cannot do nothing except
[1:28:19] what the father
[1:28:20] revealed to me
[1:28:27] praise the lord let's now use
[1:28:31] men and make excuses
[1:28:35] on god's promises because god's word is
[1:28:38] show if god said anything
[1:28:40] he's more than able to bring it to pass
[1:28:44] praise the lord if you are not seeing it
[1:28:47] in your life don't use a man for an
[1:28:49] excuse
[1:28:50] it's god that make the promise go to god
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:55] and i'm telling you if you meet god on
[1:28:57] the basis of his word
[1:28:58] he will bring that promise to pass
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:07] praise the lord he will bring that
[1:29:10] promise to pass
[1:29:17] he is the injured of this coveted
[1:29:21] praise the lord amen he's the angel of
[1:29:24] this covenant
[1:29:25] make no mistake because i i mean
[1:29:30] it's not after you know uh uh
[1:29:33] brother branham left that we came up
[1:29:34] with this this he was here
[1:29:36] this is what he was saying he was
[1:29:38] teaching us that this is the angel of
[1:29:39] the covenant
[1:29:41] he didn't say he was the injured of the
[1:29:43] covenant
[1:29:48] praise the lord that if we want god
[1:29:51] promised to come to power we must go to
[1:29:53] his grave to pray
[1:30:03] that's not what he said he said this is
[1:30:06] the angel of the covenant
[1:30:08] moses never performed one miracle it was
[1:30:10] the injured of the law that went before
[1:30:12] him
[1:30:13] it was the pillar of fire by night the
[1:30:15] cloud by day
[1:30:16] and when you see the picture that we are
[1:30:19] going going to show you that is the
[1:30:20] picture with the hollow light
[1:30:21] over brother branham he's talking about
[1:30:23] he says i believe you will
[1:30:26] feel the same pillow of fire that was
[1:30:29] leading
[1:30:29] the people today the angel of god which
[1:30:32] we
[1:30:33] know the angel that led
[1:30:36] moses was the angel of
[1:30:40] the covenant which was christ
[1:30:45] church life today has become a life
[1:30:48] of association it's just like a club
[1:30:52] we pay our deals we have our membership
[1:30:55] and we don't want to hurt one another
[1:30:57] feelings
[1:30:59] you know we just i mean i mean it's just
[1:31:02] it's it's it's it's it's it's like a
[1:31:04] family
[1:31:05] and we say we all family you know we
[1:31:08] don't want to hurt one another feelings
[1:31:10] and uh uh you know uh and
[1:31:13] and and and we have reduced it to this
[1:31:18] without god in the midst
[1:31:23] we have reduced church life
[1:31:26] to a club without god
[1:31:30] in the mess
[1:31:34] see what the the the the
[1:31:38] the lord told moses here
[1:31:42] i sent my angel beware of him obey his
[1:31:44] voice
[1:31:46] provoke him not
[1:31:51] be word of him
[1:31:55] amen obey his voice
[1:31:59] provoke him that that's the reason why
[1:32:02] all our actions and reactions
[1:32:05] must not be because of men because if a
[1:32:09] man
[1:32:10] misbehaved to you and you react to it
[1:32:12] the one that you are offending is the
[1:32:14] leader
[1:32:22] god is trying to to amplify before moses
[1:32:25] here
[1:32:26] and grab his attention and let him know
[1:32:28] look this is the man that is leaving you
[1:32:30] this
[1:32:31] is the guy that is going to get offended
[1:32:33] when something happened in the church
[1:32:38] praise the lord do we consider how do
[1:32:41] god feel
[1:32:45] the first thing we consider our feeling
[1:32:48] when he said
[1:32:48] i never even felt good i didn't feel
[1:32:52] good
[1:32:56] and we don't even consider how do god
[1:32:59] feel
[1:33:03] when we come to church and sleep how do
[1:33:05] god feel
[1:33:08] when we come to church and become
[1:33:09] irreferent how do god feel
[1:33:11] you see because church life has been
[1:33:14] reduced
[1:33:15] to a club life we don't care of how god
[1:33:18] feels
[1:33:19] we only care how he feels
[1:33:22] i'm a member of this club i pay my deals
[1:33:25] of this club i have right
[1:33:26] to express myself in this club
[1:33:33] and we don't consider how he feels
[1:33:38] but yeah moses was told be word
[1:33:44] of him obey his voice
[1:33:47] provoke him that
[1:33:52] praise the lord for he will now pardon
[1:33:55] your transgression
[1:33:57] for my name is in him
[1:34:01] praise lord
[1:34:04] but listen to this also he said but if
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:07] indeed obey his voice if you recognize
[1:34:12] the one that is the one that is leading
[1:34:14] the one that is danger
[1:34:17] the one that is in charge if you obey
[1:34:20] his voice
[1:34:22] praise the lord
[1:34:25] amen if you obey his voice
[1:34:32] then you have to listen kingly for his
[1:34:34] voice
[1:34:38] wars are fought for principles
[1:34:44] if you want to take a stand find his
[1:34:47] promise to stand upon
[1:34:49] because that's the only thing that will
[1:34:50] hold water that's the only thing that
[1:34:52] will stand
[1:34:55] praise the lord if you just want to
[1:34:59] fight
[1:35:00] for your feelings you will make yourself
[1:35:02] feel bad
[1:35:03] you will make other people to feedback
[1:35:05] and everybody will feel bad
[1:35:07] praise the lord glory be to god
[1:35:10] amen and i mean god will not fight for
[1:35:14] your feelings god stand for his word
[1:35:21] god stand for his word god back up his
[1:35:23] word
[1:35:26] praise the lord
[1:35:33] he says if you obey his voice
[1:35:38] and do all that i
[1:35:42] speak then i will be an enemy then
[1:35:44] that's when i would come on the scene
[1:35:46] and fight for you
[1:35:50] that's when i will take up your fight
[1:35:53] your fight will be my fight
[1:35:57] praise the lord
[1:36:00] what are some of the things we are
[1:36:02] fighting for
[1:36:05] what are some of the things that we are
[1:36:08] fighting for what are we standing for
[1:36:12] what are we risking this time to drive
[1:36:14] through the cold
[1:36:15] and the snow
[1:36:19] what are we here for this morning
[1:36:24] is it just to play our religion and go
[1:36:27] home
[1:36:28] what are we here for
[1:36:33] oh i believe it's because jesus christ
[1:36:35] is the same yesterday
[1:36:36] today and forever
[1:36:40] praise the lord amen i believe that's
[1:36:43] the reason why we should be here
[1:36:47] because jesus christ is the same
[1:36:49] yesterday today
[1:36:50] and forever praise the lord
[1:36:54] look this is time for us to put
[1:36:56] substance into our faith
[1:36:59] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:37:01] for
[1:37:03] a lot of people have faith with our
[1:37:04] substance it's time to put
[1:37:06] substance into your faith it's time for
[1:37:08] you to sit down and ask yourself
[1:37:10] what am i doing what is all of this
[1:37:14] what does this what is the importance of
[1:37:16] this to me
[1:37:21] it's time to put substance into your
[1:37:22] faith
[1:37:31] like the apostle paul said be not
[1:37:33] deceived god is not mark
[1:37:35] for whatsoever the man's soul that's
[1:37:37] what he's going to reap
[1:37:40] please praise the lord you play with
[1:37:42] church i mean you're playing with your
[1:37:44] own soul
[1:37:46] you play with the things of god you play
[1:37:48] with your own life
[1:37:52] but when you put substance into it you
[1:37:54] get substance back
[1:37:58] if you put substance into god you will
[1:38:01] get substance
[1:38:02] back
[1:38:06] that's the reason why our our
[1:38:09] forefathers
[1:38:10] they could sink and praise god before
[1:38:14] the firings squad before the lion then
[1:38:17] because they had substance into it
[1:38:22] they could walk praising god women
[1:38:25] burned to the stake
[1:38:26] will never give up their faith because
[1:38:30] they have substance into it
[1:38:35] for me to live is christ and to die this
[1:38:38] game
[1:38:40] they have such a substance into it that
[1:38:42] the roman sword did not fear them
[1:38:46] the terror of the roman army did not
[1:38:48] scare them
[1:38:50] because they had so much substance in it
[1:38:53] that they know of that in just in the
[1:38:55] blink of an
[1:38:56] eye they will be standing in the
[1:38:58] presence of their maker
[1:38:59] it's not an idea it's a reality it's
[1:39:02] something you hold in your heart
[1:39:05] you hold it in your heart it's so real
[1:39:06] to you
[1:39:11] it's time for us to post substance in
[1:39:12] our religion
[1:39:18] praise the lord
[1:39:24] oh praise the lord my goodness
[1:39:28] if you obey his voice and do all
[1:39:32] that i speak then i will be an enemy to
[1:39:34] your enemy
[1:39:35] you want for god to fight for you sin
[1:39:37] for god's word
[1:39:42] stand for god's word
[1:39:49] praise the lord danger
[1:39:52] of this exeter
[1:39:55] praise the lord amen
[1:40:00] william branham was the messenger of the
[1:40:02] age
[1:40:04] of the terror accident but the angel
[1:40:08] of this exeter is jesus christ
[1:40:12] he's the angel of the coveting he's the
[1:40:15] one that waits for us
[1:40:16] just at the river and make sure we have
[1:40:20] a
[1:40:20] safe travel over
[1:40:24] he holds our hand from mortal life to
[1:40:26] immortality
[1:40:30] when we go through that dark shadow that
[1:40:32] is called death
[1:40:34] he's the one that stands there and cross
[1:40:36] us over
[1:40:38] he's the angel of the coveting jesus
[1:40:41] christ
[1:40:44] praise the lord amen those are things
[1:40:46] that people don't understand they think
[1:40:48] oh you know we we i mean we worship a
[1:40:50] man we you know and get out
[1:40:52] no that's not it
[1:40:55] praise the lord
[1:40:58] and the ones that worshipping men are
[1:41:00] coming into crisis they are coming into
[1:41:04] crisis
[1:41:07] praise the lord
[1:41:10] you have to know who is your leader
[1:41:18] amen praise the lord
[1:41:27] and church he's the one that i'm putting
[1:41:30] your hands
[1:41:31] into his hands praise the lord
[1:41:35] amen let's just reach out and get a hold
[1:41:38] of his hands
[1:41:39] and say lord take a hold of my hands and
[1:41:42] lead me through 20 21.
[1:41:50] praise the lord no matter what comes
[1:41:53] amen it may close this church door then
[1:41:55] we all can stay home and but if your
[1:41:57] hands is in his hands
[1:42:00] if he's leading you he's leading me we
[1:42:02] will all find ourselves at the same
[1:42:04] place
[1:42:06] our end will be the same
[1:42:16] he's the injured of the covenant
[1:42:21] praise the lord amen
[1:42:26] the trinitarian teaching has been one of
[1:42:30] the greatest deception to the church
[1:42:32] word
[1:42:35] because with this teaching of separate
[1:42:37] separating god
[1:42:38] into three persons has created a lot of
[1:42:40] confusion in the human spirit
[1:42:42] because there is only one god
[1:42:46] that has manifested himself not only in
[1:42:49] three more than that
[1:42:52] god has manifested himself in different
[1:42:54] ways
[1:42:58] praise the lord it has become one of
[1:43:01] one of the things that have put the
[1:43:03] christian church into idolatry
[1:43:09] because we're having three gods there
[1:43:11] and and everybody is claiming worship
[1:43:14] praise the lord we can even get true
[1:43:17] worship to one god how can we satisfy
[1:43:19] three amen
[1:43:23] we can't even keep devotion to one
[1:43:26] we can't even keep commitment to one
[1:43:35] but those are some other things that
[1:43:36] have got us to the place where we are
[1:43:39] today
[1:43:40] around the christian faith all praise
[1:43:43] the lord
[1:43:47] are we together you love the lord
[1:43:58] that's just my my new year message
[1:44:03] trying to encourage you the one that we
[1:44:05] have to look to
[1:44:06] amen if anything with good good that
[1:44:09] will come out of this assembly
[1:44:11] is that we are looking to that one
[1:44:15] praise the lord if there is anything
[1:44:17] good that will come
[1:44:18] out of what we are doing in this local
[1:44:20] assembly is because we are keeping our
[1:44:22] eyes
[1:44:24] on the altar and the finisher of our
[1:44:26] faith
[1:44:28] we were not strayed from his divine word
[1:44:31] we were not strayed from uh
[1:44:34] the prophetic message that he has sent
[1:44:36] us but we will keep our eyes on him
[1:44:41] because even where we can understand
[1:44:43] where we cannot put the dust together
[1:44:46] if we keep our eyes on him we will never
[1:44:48] stray
[1:44:53] praise the lord
[1:44:56] we don't have a big name preacher to run
[1:44:58] after there is only one big man in the
[1:45:01] name of jesus christ
[1:45:04] amen that's the only big name preacher i
[1:45:06] know
[1:45:07] the name of jesus christ
[1:45:10] praise the lord amen
[1:45:14] that's that's just my encouragement to
[1:45:15] you this morning
[1:45:17] and i was going to go into something
[1:45:18] there in 1962
[1:45:20] but ben was was preaching and he was
[1:45:22] talking about coming to his end
[1:45:25] he says maybe i'm laying the foundation
[1:45:26] for one to come after me
[1:45:28] that statement has created a lot of
[1:45:31] contradiction
[1:45:33] and many men has raising up
[1:45:37] to be the one to lead us
[1:45:40] praise the lord and we are still here
[1:45:42] and they are gone
[1:45:44] and there are many more that are waking
[1:45:46] up to be the one to lead
[1:45:48] us they will be gone and we will still
[1:45:51] be here
[1:45:55] praise the lord amen
[1:45:58] because just like john the baptist stood
[1:46:01] on the earth and says
[1:46:02] there is one among us of whose shoes
[1:46:08] i'm not walter to lose the latches off
[1:46:13] praise the lord amen
[1:46:16] just like john the baptist stood
[1:46:19] on earth and said behold the lamb of god
[1:46:22] amen praise the lord that takes away the
[1:46:26] sin of the word
[1:46:31] it was a repetition
[1:46:36] the messenger was placing us in the
[1:46:38] hands of the angel
[1:46:42] he was letting us know i have laid the
[1:46:45] foundation
[1:46:46] there is one that is coming after me
[1:46:48] that one was not a martyr of flesh
[1:46:54] it was the angel because that is the way
[1:46:57] that god
[1:46:58] works after he have used a man to do a
[1:47:01] work
[1:47:02] he expect that man just like adam would
[1:47:05] do
[1:47:05] everything at the end of every day adam
[1:47:08] will go back to the father
[1:47:10] and say i have named the trees what do
[1:47:12] you think about it
[1:47:13] he said it is good
[1:47:17] jesus said after you have done all that
[1:47:20] you have done
[1:47:20] count yourself to be unprofitable
[1:47:25] because it is not you that is working it
[1:47:28] is he that is working
[1:47:29] through you
[1:47:39] during the seals he made the same
[1:47:41] statement
[1:47:46] praise the lord he says never the time
[1:47:49] two messenger has been on earth at the
[1:47:51] same time
[1:47:55] when john the baptist realized
[1:48:02] that the messiah was on earth he says
[1:48:05] i must decrease
[1:48:09] for him to increase
[1:48:12] behold the lamb of god he identified the
[1:48:16] lamb of god
[1:48:17] and the bible says andrew his disciple
[1:48:20] joined the baptist disciples
[1:48:22] follow jesus because he identified the
[1:48:25] lamb of god
[1:48:28] and he went with him in the wilderness
[1:48:33] and john went to praising
[1:48:37] and the bible says in the praising he
[1:48:39] sent a message
[1:48:40] going asking is he's the one why because
[1:48:43] it was a transition
[1:48:44] the ministry was moving from one to
[1:48:46] another
[1:48:52] it was moving from one to another
[1:48:57] but you see when god uses a man so much
[1:49:00] and the people idolize him is one of the
[1:49:03] thing that is hard to get away from
[1:49:06] is your idol it's hard to get away from
[1:49:10] your idol
[1:49:14] you know why because most of the time
[1:49:16] our idols
[1:49:17] we make it ourself we use our hands
[1:49:21] just like isaiah said they go into the
[1:49:24] wood they cut down the trees
[1:49:26] they use some to roast meat and they
[1:49:29] carve some for the idols
[1:49:32] and then they bow down and worship it
[1:49:38] praise the lord they carve it with their
[1:49:41] own hands
[1:49:44] we like the things that we do
[1:49:47] we like it
[1:49:50] come and see come and see what i did
[1:49:51] come and see what i did come and see
[1:49:53] come and see what i did
[1:50:01] and when we make our idols it's hard for
[1:50:03] us to get away from
[1:50:05] praise the lord gideon
[1:50:09] broke his died idol in the morning to
[1:50:12] woke up
[1:50:14] says gideon what have you done well what
[1:50:17] have you done
[1:50:20] praise the lord why because gideon
[1:50:22] realized
[1:50:23] they are praying to this thing it's not
[1:50:25] making no it can't even move
[1:50:29] the first thing about it it's so scary
[1:50:34] it's so scary so he said okay let
[1:50:38] us learn that len we shouldn't argue
[1:50:42] we shouldn't argue don't talk for god
[1:50:45] let your god talk for yourself amen
[1:50:52] praise the lord
[1:50:56] and that's what we have done
[1:50:59] that's what we have done in religion
[1:51:02] after catholicism dominate the world
[1:51:06] it become it became the universal church
[1:51:10] you think about the kind of a reference
[1:51:13] and fear
[1:51:14] before the reformation that people had
[1:51:17] towards the catholic church to say
[1:51:19] something against the pope
[1:51:23] my goodness the kind of a
[1:51:27] terror that was on the hearts of the
[1:51:29] people
[1:51:30] when those men were not even in the
[1:51:33] service of god
[1:51:36] with all the things they were doing and
[1:51:39] all the things that were happening
[1:51:45] praise the lord when ludo came out and
[1:51:48] spoke against the church
[1:51:49] people said little are you not afraid
[1:51:53] are you not scared
[1:52:00] but what am i trying to say we have made
[1:52:03] excuses
[1:52:06] why we would not serve god why we would
[1:52:08] not live right
[1:52:10] you find people saying i mean why should
[1:52:12] i do it even the pastor then said the
[1:52:14] drinking
[1:52:17] praise the lord we will make excuses
[1:52:26] is that not the falling nature of adam
[1:52:29] always looking for somebody to pass the
[1:52:31] bottle
[1:52:32] looking for somebody to blame for your
[1:52:34] failure
[1:52:37] it's just it's just a simple adam nature
[1:52:40] the woman that you give me
[1:52:44] the woman said the serpent
[1:52:47] we're always looking for somebody to
[1:52:49] blame
[1:52:52] when god has given us
[1:52:55] a sacred word
[1:52:58] heaven and earth will pass away now
[1:53:01] one thing in this world will pass away
[1:53:06] praise the lord this morning i was
[1:53:07] thinking about speaking on uh
[1:53:11] once again i will shake the heavens and
[1:53:13] the earth
[1:53:14] that's what i wanted to speak on but i
[1:53:16] just thought we need to encourage
[1:53:18] ourselves in this way
[1:53:19] once again we need to re-echo and
[1:53:22] identify our leader
[1:53:24] amen we need to re-echo
[1:53:28] and identify the one that is leading us
[1:53:35] praise the lord
[1:53:38] amen amen i've
[1:53:42] soon closed here just a few minutes
[1:53:44] before me

[1:59:30] we're standing for the word of god so
[1:59:33] all of that
[1:59:35] you know i just come
[1:59:39] by the weight of this this little
[1:59:41] hesitation
[1:59:43] introduce you to the leader
[1:59:49] praise the lord to the one that i expect
[1:59:52] will lead us
[1:59:55] we are not here to please your feelings
[1:59:59] we don't want to hurt you intentionally
[2:00:03] but there is one person
[2:00:06] that i hope that we all will be glad
[2:00:08] when he is happy
[2:00:09] is the almighty god
[2:00:14] praise the lord there is nobody that is
[2:00:17] above the word of god

[2:00:23] wrong
[2:00:24] find the word to come and meet me don't
[2:00:27] come and tell me how you feel
[2:00:31] just find the word and say brother one i
[2:00:33] call into the word of god
[2:00:35] we're not supposed to do this when you
[2:00:38] do that
[2:00:38] then you trap me then you're ready for a
[2:00:42] fight
[2:00:45] amen
[2:00:49] and if it's the word of god we will all
[2:00:51] bow down on our knees and say lord jesus
[2:00:53] help us
[2:00:55] but if you come and tell me how you feel
[2:00:57] i will tell you how i feel
[2:01:04] it sounds funny but it's
[2:01:07] it's it's real it's it's truth we are
[2:01:10] getting into a place
[2:01:13] that we have not been before
[2:01:16] church life is lord people
[2:01:20] that has held the word of god
[2:01:24] they are throwing the towers in
[2:01:29] prayer life is gone from the believers
[2:01:33] christians don't pray anymore just a lot
[2:01:36] of pressure
[2:01:44] the internet has won the minds of our
[2:01:47] young people
[2:01:51] we can make it good for them but if not
[2:01:56] it's a sale that's why they call it cell
[2:01:59] phone
[2:02:00] it means a cell for one you are in your
[2:02:03] own cell
[2:02:06] that little thing that on your hands you
[2:02:09] can get your food on it
[2:02:11] you can buy your clothes on it but you
[2:02:14] are in yourself
[2:02:20] we have a generation that have heard
[2:02:24] about the supernatural
[2:02:27] heard about a little fish about the
[2:02:28] scholars and heard about all of this
[2:02:32] but he has seen little
[2:02:35] of the supernatural in the church
[2:02:44] the holy ghost is just a church
[2:02:46] identification
[2:02:48] because i mean the message i have the
[2:02:50] holy ghost
[2:02:52] when the holy ghost to our fathers
[2:02:58] was something that made them to sit in
[2:03:01] church
[2:03:01] for the love of god they just weep
[2:03:12] we are in an information age
[2:03:16] people run to google
[2:03:21] for all the answers
[2:03:31] with all of these things that is
[2:03:32] happening
[2:03:35] we have just come this morning to tell
[2:03:39] you
[2:03:40] that just as the lord told
[2:03:43] moses i will send my angel
[2:03:47] before you praise the lord
[2:03:51] and that was
[2:03:54] the leader of the accident
[2:03:57] if we are in the tear exeter and we are
[2:04:00] going into
[2:04:02] our promise of the baptism of the holy
[2:04:04] ghost
[2:04:07] then i want to say to you that
[2:04:13] that same angel he's
[2:04:16] he is our leader of this exeter
[2:04:22] praise the lord if you want to make it
[2:04:24] into the promised land you got to keep
[2:04:26] your eyes on the leader
[2:04:29] you got to obey what he says
[2:04:33] you got to obey what he says
[2:04:39] it's so easy for us to have our idea
[2:04:42] about what he says
[2:04:43] our opinion about what he says we can
[2:04:46] argue about it
