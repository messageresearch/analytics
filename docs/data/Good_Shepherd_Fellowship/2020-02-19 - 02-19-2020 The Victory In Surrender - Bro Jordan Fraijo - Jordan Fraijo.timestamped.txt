[22:54] as he goes by
[23:01] a man you believe he's here and you can
[23:04] reach out and touch him tonight you know
[23:07] that's all we need do is come believing
[23:11] that he is here and not only is he here
[23:15] but that we can touch him by the feeling
[23:16] of our infirmities you see it's not just
[23:18] enough to believe he's here but you have
[23:21] to believe that you can touch him that
[23:22] you have access you see because we can
[23:25] go many places we could go visit the
[23:27] White House and we know the president's
[23:30] in but that gives you no guarantee of
[23:33] being able to have fellowship or talk to
[23:35] him or touch him but we know what
[23:38] tonight is we come into the presence of
[23:40] the king now he's here but we can touch
[23:43] him
[23:46] musicians go ahead and be seated let's
[23:49] just go ahead and open our Bibles to
[23:51] first John five one through five I'm a
[23:54] little bit nervous so I'm talking fast
[23:55] here I'll try and slow it down a little
[23:58] bit but still not keep you any longer
[24:00] than brother Scott did on last time
[24:03] there I have a bar to meet here he think
[24:06] he said he made 45 minutes so we'll try
[24:09] not to do more than that Saint John one
[24:12] five one through five will be our
[24:15] reading here and just say man when you
[24:18] got it first John five one through five
[24:26] don't won't be reading here all right
[24:30] let's go ahead it reads whosoever
[24:34] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[24:36] born of God and every one that loveth
[24:39] him that be that we loveth him also that
[24:46] is begotten of him by this we know that
[24:51] we love the children of God when we love
[24:53] God and keep his Commandments for this
[24:56] is the love of God that we keep his
[24:58] Commandments and His commandments are
[25:00] not Grievous for whatsoever for
[25:05] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[25:08] world and this is the victory that
[25:10] overcometh the world even our faith
[25:13] who is he that overcometh the world but
[25:16] he that believeth that Jesus is the Son
[25:19] of God
[25:20] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we has
[25:23] come before you once again this evening
[25:24] father Lord just this little time of
[25:27] fellowship here on a Wednesday night
[25:28] Lord asking father that you would come
[25:32] by and just have your way father Lord
[25:34] that I would be able to just surrender
[25:36] myself and get myself out of the way and
[25:39] you'd be able to come and speak to your
[25:40] people father and Lord they'd deal to
[25:42] get themselves out of the way father
[25:44] that you would be able to come and speak
[25:46] to their hearts father and you'd be a
[25:48] true Fellowship of the king and his
[25:50] bride father lip to ear father speaking
[25:54] directly to each an individual need
[25:55] father well we just dedicated this time
[25:58] to you in Jesus most wonderful and
[26:01] precious name Amen
[26:03] tonight really what I want to look at is
[26:06] there you go ahead and be seated is
[26:10] there in verse 4 and it says and this is
[26:14] the victory that overcometh the world
[26:15] even our faith and I'll going to take a
[26:18] little bit of a thought on victory but
[26:23] for a title I want to speak on the
[26:26] victory in surrender now that may seem a
[26:30] little bit backwards or seem how could
[26:34] that be a victory in surrender and in
[26:38] the terms of the world that that is an
[26:42] impossibility because how can you both
[26:44] be the victor and surrender and yet that
[26:47] is exactly what we are called to in in
[26:51] our walk with Christ is that in order
[26:53] for there to be a victory it requires a
[26:56] surrender so many times you know we
[26:59] think about victory as overcoming
[27:01] certain things in our lives but that's
[27:04] not it because really what we're looking
[27:07] at is getting to a point where we can
[27:09] totally accept what God is doing for us
[27:12] and is going to do for us but we can't
[27:15] do that outside of a surrender to his
[27:18] will for our lives and so we we look for
[27:21] perhaps victory over our habits victory
[27:24] over anger victory over depression
[27:27] victory over whatever it might be
[27:30] something in your past family we're
[27:33] looking for victory over sickness on all
[27:36] these things but we know by the word of
[27:38] a prophet that come to us in this day
[27:40] that all these things are not sin he
[27:45] said you know what is sin you know he
[27:47] said his drinking sin and smoking in sin
[27:48] is is the lust of the flesh of sin he
[27:51] said no these are attributes of sin so
[27:55] even like attributes of a disease we
[27:58] could conquer it you could have a cold
[28:01] or a flu and you conquered maybe you
[28:02] were able to bring the heat down but the
[28:04] virus of the bug or the bacteria is
[28:06] still there you have not gained the
[28:09] victory over the real issue and that's
[28:12] what we're wanting to zero in on and
[28:14] look at knowing that we have to reach
[28:16] victory through surrender is we want to
[28:20] take a look at and not just oh I have a
[28:22] victory over drinking well yeah alcohol
[28:25] Anonymous they all claim they have a
[28:27] victory over drinking as well and many
[28:29] of them do but one of the big things
[28:32] that is pointed out with them is you
[28:35] know they are always alcoholics alcohol
[28:41] Anonymous you go in they have their
[28:43] 12-step program when you come in you say
[28:46] I am an alcoholic at the very end of the
[28:50] program do you know what they have you
[28:52] say again I am an alcoholic no
[28:55] deliverance they've they've taught you
[28:57] how to go through a 12-step program to
[29:00] curb that desire but the desire and that
[29:06] identification is still with you
[29:08] everywhere you go and they say you ever
[29:12] get in that atmosphere of drinking or
[29:15] whatever that is that you've gained a
[29:18] victory over it'll hit you twice it as
[29:21] bad as it ever did before it'll take you
[29:23] down worse and that we can see also in
[29:26] scripture where it speaks about when
[29:28] those that devil was cast out and it
[29:31] goes about searching for a place to go
[29:33] and there's a clean house all cleaned
[29:35] out there's a victory over that devil
[29:40] when he comes back and he finds that
[29:41] house clean and swept and empty you see
[29:45] the house was never filled with anything
[29:47] else he says he goes and gathers seven
[29:50] others and brings them back and takes up
[29:53] residence in that house again and now
[29:56] it's seven times worse so when we began
[29:59] to look at this we're looking at we not
[30:01] just looking for little personal
[30:03] victories but we're looking for victory
[30:05] through surrender because the only true
[30:10] victory is when we begin to surrender
[30:13] all of our self all of our own thoughts
[30:16] our own ideas that our humanity to to
[30:20] God and have a victory over self and now
[30:25] we can enter into an overcoming life but
[30:29] until that happens you'll be able to do
[30:32] like the scribes and the Pharisees they
[30:34] were able to come in and live such a
[30:36] life that when the people looked at and
[30:37] said who even Jesus said who can put a
[30:40] even a mark against the life that
[30:43] they're living he said but on the inside
[30:45] there but dead men's bones Sepulchre is
[30:48] pretty on the outside a graveyard full
[30:51] of trees and flowers but but the
[30:54] destruction the death and the sorrow
[30:56] buried in those grounds is so deep and
[30:59] overwhelming that the people that visit
[31:02] they're not coming for because they're
[31:05] happy they're not coming because of
[31:06] something that they were able to gain a
[31:09] victory over there's death in those
[31:12] grounds
[31:19] I kind of when I first started thinking
[31:26] about this is I believe me and faith
[31:30] we're talking one night we're talking
[31:31] about what does it mean to overcome or
[31:33] how do you overcome and I thought about
[31:40] it and I began to think about it I
[31:43] realized that we are still trying to do
[31:47] something we're trying to involve
[31:49] ourselves we're looking for a work we're
[31:53] looking for something that we can do
[31:55] that we can stamp our name on and show
[31:58] everybody look at this is what I did
[32:00] here is how I did this in fact you want
[32:05] to you want to know how I got rich I
[32:07] wrote a book and here it is for you and
[32:09] my name on the front of the cover this
[32:11] is the program if you follow exactly
[32:13] what I did you're gonna get this same
[32:15] result because we want to have some type
[32:18] of input into that we want to have some
[32:20] type of control over where our life is
[32:22] going and humanity doesn't want to let
[32:28] go we want to have a plan in place where
[32:32] we you know we have that five year plan
[32:33] that five year goal and nothing's gonna
[32:36] get in our way nothing is gonna stop us
[32:39] we're gonna have so much money in the
[32:41] bank we're gonna own a certain type of a
[32:43] car we're gonna have certain type of a
[32:45] house we're gonna have a certain type of
[32:46] a job and this is the place we're gonna
[32:47] live it's you know and you have people
[32:50] who have it down by year by year by year
[32:53] and this is how it's gonna happen and
[32:55] whether there's gonna be kids or no kids
[32:58] and how many kids and when that's gonna
[33:00] be
[33:00] B and nothing is going to get in their
[33:03] way and when you are so locked down and
[33:07] people do it in churches as well they
[33:09] get into a church and they'll say
[33:11] they'll get so locked down into that
[33:15] church it almost becomes an odd almost
[33:21] an idolatry to that location almost an
[33:26] idolatry to that that pastor because
[33:29] they've come to a point where they said
[33:31] this
[33:32] is where I'm going and it nothing will
[33:34] move me from here and people forget to
[33:40] take and put on their lives the same
[33:43] comma the brother Adam says we should
[33:45] put on the word is this is where God has
[33:49] me until he takes me somewhere else
[33:53] you see that's what happened in the book
[33:55] of Acts is there they are they all
[33:57] hunkered down the 12 disciples were
[33:59] there they set up deacons they had in
[34:02] fact they had set up what everyone is
[34:05] shooting in one ting for today they had
[34:07] set up a socialist communist ik little
[34:10] commune where everybody brought
[34:12] everything in everyone was selling their
[34:13] houses everyone was living together and
[34:15] you know what the same issues that are
[34:17] happening today with that same system
[34:19] started happening in the church because
[34:21] God didn't want that to stay there in
[34:24] Jerusalem he said take this gospel and
[34:27] spread it to the ends of the earth I
[34:31] don't want you to create a little
[34:33] commune where all of you just hunker
[34:36] down and then you will you begin to
[34:37] bicker over who's getting what that's
[34:40] why they had to bring the Deacons in in
[34:41] that situation they had to set up
[34:44] deacons because the the 12 the disciples
[34:48] were spending more time settling
[34:51] arguments and disputes and fights over
[34:53] who got what then they were preaching
[34:56] the gospel so they had to bring in
[35:00] deacons to settle these disputes they
[35:03] said here you guys handle this and what
[35:07] did God do he got came in and he used
[35:10] the power of the roman power of that day
[35:13] and the and the church of that day
[35:15] coming in and break that little grew up
[35:17] group up and scatter them all over the
[35:21] world to spread the gospel because he
[35:26] wasn't looking he didn't want that and
[35:28] we do the same thing we we don't do it
[35:31] on that scale but we'll get so set in
[35:34] our way and and with our plan in mind
[35:37] that we don't give God any room to move
[35:40] and the only thing he can do then is
[35:43] come in and drop a stick of dynamite in
[35:45] the middle of your lie
[35:46] and watch it shatter and he'll do it
[35:49] every time in fact he cares so much
[35:52] about each one of you individually and
[35:54] the plan he asks for your life and where
[35:56] he wants to take you that he's not
[35:58] worried about causing a depression for a
[36:02] city for a country for a church he's not
[36:05] worried about bringing turmoil into the
[36:07] church he's not worried about bringing a
[36:10] shattering and bringing it down he's not
[36:12] worried about one individual man's his
[36:17] prestige if it's the pastor that you're
[36:20] looking up to he'll do something to
[36:22] bring that pastor down in your eyes you
[36:25] know but be careful though because a
[36:27] part of that is your fault
[36:30] you've come in and you've be under
[36:32] worship that man and God will do
[36:34] something to bring him down where you're
[36:38] seeing him to get your eyes off of him
[36:39] and back on Christ because he it's not
[36:44] about the man it's not about you it's
[36:46] not about your own ability it's not
[36:48] about your humanity it's about Christ
[36:50] it's about what Christ is wanting to do
[36:53] in your life keep moving here one of the
[37:01] keys to to this victory that we're all
[37:04] looking for and it's really pertinent is
[37:08] here in Chapman verse 3 in John 5
[37:13] they're right before we went down into
[37:16] the verse 4 where it speaks about the
[37:17] victory and overcoming is he says for
[37:20] this is the love of God that we keep his
[37:22] Commandments and His commandments are
[37:24] not Grievous now that's key you think he
[37:29] didn't just state that you were to keep
[37:34] the commandments but that the
[37:38] commandments would not be Grievous you
[37:41] see Israel had lived by a set of laws
[37:44] and by that start out as the Ten
[37:47] Commandments and then they had a set of
[37:49] books and books of laws that they added
[37:51] to it one after another after another
[37:54] and they loved the law
[37:59] they loved it because the law allowed
[38:02] them as long as they worked within the
[38:04] confines of the rules they were able to
[38:13] express their unconverted humanity in
[38:17] dealing out that law on everybody else
[38:23] so their self-righteousness they could
[38:27] take that which was an unholy thing and
[38:30] apply the law to someone else's sin to
[38:34] make themselves feel better because the
[38:39] law did not require the love of God in
[38:43] their heart it didn't it was just this
[38:47] is the law and this is the punishment
[38:49] and in keeping of the law is
[38:52] righteousness and so they were able to
[38:56] apply an eye for an eye and a tooth for
[38:59] a tooth vigorously and and judiciously
[39:05] on anybody and everybody and able to say
[39:09] look it I did it right you know people
[39:11] are still that way today you'll find
[39:13] people within companies and they will
[39:16] wait and nitpick every last person they
[39:19] can find and they they have the rulebook
[39:22] memorized and they will find you and
[39:28] they'll apply that law to you and if
[39:35] they're if that person reaches a state
[39:37] of management they will create a living
[39:41] hell in that workplace has nothing to do
[39:45] with their love for the company or their
[39:47] love for the individual or even them
[39:51] trying to build that organization but
[39:54] it's them being right and in them being
[39:58] right even if they have little things
[40:01] that they do they justify it because of
[40:03] all areas that they're right and that's
[40:07] the point where Jesus steps in on the
[40:10] scene here we
[40:11] it's reached a combination where the
[40:14] religious group has become so powerful
[40:16] why because they're applying these rules
[40:18] and laws as they see fit and we know
[40:22] that's how they were doing it because
[40:24] they're they were they are trying to
[40:28] trip Jesus up and what do they do they
[40:31] bring him a harlot and throw the harlot
[40:35] at his feet and say the law says she
[40:39] should be stoned now what what do you
[40:42] say now what the mistake that they made
[40:46] is they didn't realize is that they
[40:49] brought the law to the one who had
[40:52] written the law and they forgot he
[40:59] didn't do it but he could have started
[41:02] out by saying where's the man because
[41:06] scripture says in order to bring an
[41:08] accusation you have to bring the man and
[41:11] the woman and then they are both if
[41:15] found guilty are to be stoned but they
[41:18] only brought the woman and they said
[41:20] they caught her in the very act of
[41:21] adultery so where was the man and whose
[41:26] friend was he you see they were applying
[41:30] it as they felt fit and how they thought
[41:34] it best fit their agenda and their needs
[41:38] he they were they were applying the law
[41:41] right the law of Moses Jesus did not
[41:45] come and say well that's not really it
[41:47] or you guys aren't doing this right but
[41:49] he did something and no one to this day
[41:52] knows exactly what he was writing in the
[41:54] dust but he stooped down and began to
[41:56] write and it says that they left from
[41:59] the oldest unto the youngest and my
[42:02] guess is he's stooped down and he in
[42:05] writing those very same laws in the dirt
[42:08] and from the oldest to the youngest they
[42:11] left because the oldest one had broken
[42:14] the most of them and as the list piled
[42:17] up they only not only did they see the
[42:20] laws that they broke but they knew the
[42:23] judgment that followed it
[42:25] in order to cast judgment on her
[42:30] they'd have to cast judgment on
[42:31] themselves because it says that if the
[42:35] least of these the law is broken you've
[42:39] broken them all you're guilty of all so
[42:43] if even a lie was told you're guilty
[42:47] even as much as the harlot that you've
[42:49] thrown at his feet you see so when we
[42:55] begin to examine this for this is the
[42:58] love of God that we keep his
[42:59] Commandments is he just speaking about
[43:02] the Ten Commandments about judiciously
[43:05] making sure everyone follows them to the
[43:07] tee or is he speaking of something
[43:10] different and His commandments are not
[43:14] Grievous you see it's not just a
[43:17] commandment just a law a way of life
[43:20] that we do because we have to but it's
[43:25] something you enter into because of love
[43:27] and the commandments not Bree via sits
[43:30] not a work it's no longer a work or
[43:33] something that you have to do but it's
[43:34] just something that comes out of you
[43:36] because it becomes a part of who you are
[43:39] now we're gonna step over into John 13
[43:43] st. John 13 and we'll go quickly here
[43:46] verse 34 and 35 or we're gonna start
[43:49] looking at this and see what is it does
[43:52] Jesus give any further explanation of
[43:55] the covenants that he's asking you to
[43:57] keep and this is all tying in to that
[44:01] total surrender that's required for
[44:05] victory
[44:05] okay so John 13:34 through 35 and it
[44:10] says a new commandment I give unto you
[44:12] that ye love one another as I have loved
[44:17] you that ye also love one another by
[44:22] this shall all men know that ye are my
[44:25] disciples if ye love one another
[44:29] you see he didn't have a list of rules
[44:32] or a list of how you should act should
[44:35] act
[44:37] because it's not necessary many people
[44:41] like wait whoa what do you mean it's not
[44:43] necessary don't we need a list of how we
[44:46] should act and how we should behave and
[44:48] manners and church order and all that
[44:50] stuff
[44:51] tied in yeah it's good but if you'll get
[44:57] to this point here where you love one
[45:01] another this is not just a temper a
[45:05] filial love one that we can develop one
[45:09] for another but it's a Nagappa love that
[45:11] he's asking you to have it's an
[45:13] unconditional love so that unconditional
[45:19] love that love of God if it's deposited
[45:21] in your heart and expressed back out for
[45:26] your brother or your sister or each
[45:28] individual because actually that level
[45:32] of God is to be expressed to the world
[45:34] not even just the people next to you
[45:37] because how are you to be a light to
[45:39] this world an expression of Christ if we
[45:42] choose Paul Paul speaks about it and he
[45:45] says he said even the Gentiles do that
[45:47] even the Gentiles he speaking to the I
[45:51] believe it must have been in the book of
[45:52] Hebrews but he says even the Gentiles
[45:55] loved those that love them that's
[45:58] not--that's that's the no-brainer that's
[46:00] easy but the love of God is to be
[46:04] extended to those who are unlovable and
[46:07] the way we know that is because he's
[46:09] asking us to love even as he loved us so
[46:15] when we were in a state where we are
[46:17] unlovable when we were unsavable when we
[46:20] were in a state of beyond what anyone
[46:23] would want to touch yet yet Christ died
[46:26] for us he's saying that's the kind of
[46:29] love I want you to express he and he
[46:33] knows that once that love is taken over
[46:36] and taken control and is expressed all
[46:39] these commandments that he handed that
[46:41] he had put in detail he's like they're
[46:43] not ready for the love of God yet so I'm
[46:45] gonna give him a list of things to try
[46:47] and just get by
[46:51] because they weren't ready because even
[46:53] when he came down there at Mount Horeb
[46:56] with the ten commandments he came as
[46:58] folks to the children of Israel and the
[47:00] children of Israel so did not want that
[47:03] responsibility they turned to Moses and
[47:05] said Moses tell God we don't want him to
[47:07] speak to us anymore that's too way too
[47:10] frightening and has way too much
[47:11] responsibility attached to it because we
[47:15] can't claim ignorance if God is telling
[47:18] us directly so you have God tell you and
[47:22] then you tell us because then we can
[47:25] claim you mixed it up somewhere in
[47:26] between but they didn't want it they
[47:32] didn't want that direct fellowship
[47:35] because that's what God was came down
[47:38] and offered to do God spoke to them
[47:41] directly from off the Mount but he was
[47:43] so fearful it was so reverent and it
[47:47] caused them you know there was a certain
[47:48] way they had to prepare themselves for
[47:51] that meeting with God and they said no
[47:55] we like the priesthood we like having a
[47:59] prophet you stay sanctified so God will
[48:02] talk to you well we don't want the
[48:04] responsibility of a sanctified life we
[48:09] don't want to have to go through all
[48:10] this washing and preparing and three
[48:14] days beforehand and and making sure we
[48:18] have everything in a line just so God
[48:19] will speak to us but yet that's what God
[48:24] was looking for he's looking to come
[48:26] back to that place of fellowship like he
[48:28] had with Adam in the garden and he was
[48:32] reaching out he's putting reaching out
[48:34] to men and they kept rejecting and kept
[48:37] rejecting and yet that's what we're
[48:39] called to here in John 15 12 through 17
[48:43] I'm just gonna read it quickly this is
[48:46] my commandment that ye love one another
[48:48] as I have loved you greater love hath no
[48:52] man than this now wait he's gonna he's
[48:55] gonna fill us in on this commandment and
[48:57] on on the love he's looking to be
[49:00] expressed
[49:03] greater love hath no man than this that
[49:05] a man lay down his life for a friend so
[49:11] here is the qualifier for that love it's
[49:16] not just well I love you in passing I
[49:20] love you but don't call me late at night
[49:24] you know you need somebody
[49:26] I'll get you somebody elses number you
[49:29] see it's not that he was very specific
[49:33] about the quality of the love that was
[49:36] going to be expressed through this
[49:38] commandment then a man lay down his life
[49:43] for his friend ye are my friends if you
[49:47] do whatsoever I command you henceforth I
[49:51] call you not servants for the servant
[49:54] knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I
[49:57] have called you friends you see here
[50:00] he's establish a relationship with his
[50:03] disciples because now he's gonna do
[50:06] something that he wants them to turn
[50:08] around in mirror because a great leader
[50:11] never calls you to do something that
[50:14] they have not already done themselves
[50:15] and here's Christ if you don't know
[50:20] where this place is in the book of John
[50:21] this is actually going on during the
[50:24] Last Supper so here he is he's preparing
[50:29] he knows what's coming he's about to go
[50:32] to the cross
[50:33] in fact he's getting ready to do exactly
[50:37] what each one of us is gonna have to do
[50:39] to gain the victory over self which was
[50:42] totally deny his self his own thoughts
[50:46] his own abilities when he goes from this
[50:50] place in the Last Supper he's gonna go
[50:52] now next he's gonna head to the Garden
[50:54] of Gethsemane okay but here we are he's
[50:57] at the Last Supper and this is something
[50:59] he's stressing both in the chapter 13
[51:01] and chapter 15 is all during the Last
[51:04] Supper
[51:04] so already he's already said this three
[51:07] times here henceforth I call you not
[51:11] servants for the servant knoweth not
[51:13] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[51:15] you friends
[51:16] for all things that I have heard of my
[51:18] father have I made known unto you you
[51:22] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[51:24] and ordained you that you should go and
[51:28] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[51:30] should remain that what's wherever you
[51:33] shall ask of my father in my name he may
[51:36] give it you these things
[51:38] I command you that ye love one another
[51:43] so here it is he's at the Last Supper
[51:49] knowing where he's headed here he is
[51:52] he's stressing this to his disciples
[51:54] over and over and over he doesn't want
[51:57] him to miss it he knows they're about to
[52:00] go through something greater than
[52:04] they've ever gone through before and
[52:07] they've been following Jesus for three
[52:09] and a half years they've had mighty
[52:12] works they've been able to do in his
[52:14] name they've healed the sick they've
[52:17] cast out a few devils you know they're
[52:19] feeling pretty good you know in fact
[52:23] when the seventy fell away they stayed
[52:25] with him you know look at you know look
[52:28] at what we've done we stayed with Jesus
[52:30] the whole way all the way all the way to
[52:33] here you know so they're not just nobody
[52:39] they've been following for a while but
[52:44] he's stressing this because he knows
[52:49] they're about to be tested and he what
[52:52] doesn't want them to forget this is not
[52:56] just keeping the commandments this is
[52:58] not just trying to be a good person this
[53:01] is not he's calling you to something
[53:03] greater something greater because he
[53:05] said I didn't come to destroy the law
[53:08] all these commandments that you have I
[53:10] didn't come to destroy them he said I
[53:12] came to magnify them make them greater
[53:14] he said because I'm coming with
[53:16] something for you a power that you'll be
[53:20] able to receive the life of Christ in
[53:24] you my very life God's own life in you
[53:27] that'll make you a
[53:29] Boal to not just keep these commandments
[53:32] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not
[53:36] commit adultery thou shall not kill
[53:40] they'll show now you know bear false
[53:43] witness honor thy father and thy mother
[53:47] does that are just simple things is that
[53:50] income to take these away except I came
[53:52] to magnify them and anytime you magnify
[53:55] something it makes it greater stronger
[53:58] larger it brings it into view you know
[54:02] we have a few examples he said as far as
[54:06] thou shalt not commit adultery he said
[54:08] but I say unto you if a man even look at
[54:11] a woman to lust after her he has
[54:13] committed adultery with her already in
[54:15] his heart
[54:15] now the commandment is so much greater
[54:18] that no one humanly can keep it if he
[54:20] would have brought it to them back then
[54:22] in the book of Exodus they would all
[54:24] been like well we're done there's no way
[54:28] we can do this impossible impossible you
[54:33] might as well destroy us all dead here
[54:37] right but he gave them something they
[54:40] thought they could do not that they even
[54:43] then that they were buying their
[54:45] salvation by works and was still by
[54:47] faith and he was still by the grace of
[54:50] God and by His mercy that they were
[54:53] saved because that's what it was oh it
[55:00] wasn't that they they killed a lamb and
[55:05] that took away their sin but he gave
[55:08] them something a steps that he could go
[55:10] through to then come before him and meet
[55:13] him and then he would honor those steps
[55:19] by forgiving their sins and finding them
[55:23] guiltless you see but that sacrifice
[55:27] that they received never took away the
[55:29] desire from their heart so they went
[55:32] back and they committed it they were
[55:34] stuck in that cycle over and over and
[55:36] over again because they still had the
[55:38] same desire same desire same desire they
[55:41] come back and and
[55:43] give the same sacrifice and go away and
[55:45] then come back and the same sacrifice
[55:46] and go away and come back same sacrifice
[55:51] over and over and over again stuck in
[55:54] that cycle many of us find ourselves
[55:57] stuck in cycles and we we look at it and
[56:01] the world tell you well you'll never get
[56:02] out of that you're your grandfather your
[56:05] great-grandfather they they had that
[56:07] same issue they had that same habit they
[56:10] had that same anger you know and
[56:12] sometimes we wear some of that stuff
[56:13] with a badge of pride we claim that we
[56:16] don't but we're like yeah you know that
[56:20] I really that runs in my family and you
[56:22] should see some of them compared to me
[56:23] I'm nothing but don't don't push my
[56:25] buttons or whatever it is or or you know
[56:32] yeah my I have people in my family that
[56:35] who perhaps you know due to depression
[56:37] they were always depressed and and they
[56:40] just could never come out of it and this
[56:42] one this one committed suicide or this
[56:44] or that and and you wear that you know
[56:47] you wear it and you let that little
[56:48] devil to sit there why cuz we're still
[56:53] looking for something we're not we're
[56:55] not wanting to let that thing go that
[56:56] identity back to our what we think is is
[56:59] who we are we're holding on to that
[57:02] thing turning out to hold gage too long
[57:09] here I'll get carried away
[57:16] all right I take a minute we're gonna
[57:22] look at the word surrender and what that
[57:28] means it and also surrender is to give
[57:36] oneself over to something or to give
[57:39] oneself up unto into the power of
[57:45] another there's a several other
[57:48] definitions to surrender but they're
[57:50] directly related more to the
[57:52] surrendering of an army and I think
[57:56] these are the two that I want to look at
[57:59] because even as they're when he is
[58:03] speaking of the commandment that it be
[58:04] not grievious then it speaks of a
[58:07] surrendered life that is not surrendered
[58:10] out of force but out of will a personal
[58:15] decision a personal desire to be
[58:19] surrendered see because God's not coming
[58:22] to look come in like an avenging army
[58:24] upon his children and take you by force
[58:26] as slaves that's not the surrender he's
[58:33] looking for he's looking for a willing
[58:36] surrender one that says Lord I don't
[58:40] have to do this but I come surrendering
[58:45] my life because I want you to have full
[58:48] and total control because he cannot work
[58:52] with a surrender that is not completely
[58:56] willing is of no use to him because you
[59:01] know at the end of time we know that
[59:03] Satan will be bound for a thousand years
[59:06] brother Adam said he'll be bound by
[59:08] chains of circumstances he'll have to
[59:10] surrender because there'll be no one to
[59:16] work through but he won't be converted
[59:22] you see the type of surrender is very
[59:25] important
[59:26] how are you surrendering are you like
[59:29] the little child that has been
[59:31] reprimanded and reprimanded and
[59:32] reprimanded and sit on that chair and
[59:34] finally they've been sat on the chair so
[59:36] many times it's like fine I'll stay here
[59:40] but I'm not happy about it the you know
[59:44] they're not they didn't learn that
[59:46] anything they're not they're not wanting
[59:50] to be there
[59:51] God wants a willing surrender where you
[59:54] want to be in his presence
[59:56] you want to be there because now he can
[1:00:00] work with that he can work with that
[1:00:03] kind of surrender
[1:00:04] speaking about overcoming and victory
[1:00:09] what does it take to totally surrender
[1:00:14] and receive a victory over self you have
[1:00:20] to believe what you're surrendering to
[1:00:25] is the best thing for you if you're
[1:00:33] going to willingly turn over all control
[1:00:36] to your life you have to believe what
[1:00:39] you're turning yourself over to is the
[1:00:43] absolute best thing that could happen to
[1:00:46] you and that's what believing is all
[1:00:49] about you you know many people say oh I
[1:00:52] believe in God but do you see it
[1:00:56] affecting their life not a bit I believe
[1:00:59] that I believe in in a creator did do
[1:01:02] you see anything about their belief in a
[1:01:05] creator that changes how they act and
[1:01:06] conduct themselves not a bit
[1:01:10] there's even many who say I believe the
[1:01:13] message is true the message of the
[1:01:16] Prophet I believe it's true I just can't
[1:01:18] live it so what what does that mean what
[1:01:23] that it's a very shallow belief you see
[1:01:28] the to believe in in the Hebrew the
[1:01:33] Israelites blew the word to
[1:01:35] to them was something much deeper and
[1:01:39] there's it has several translations
[1:01:42] depending on the use but there's one and
[1:01:44] the word am on AMA N and Aman represents
[1:01:51] not just a mental assessment of
[1:01:55] something and recognizing it to be true
[1:02:01] or recognizing it perhaps as a theory or
[1:02:07] something nice that makes you feel good
[1:02:10] but it's a firm conviction producing the
[1:02:14] full acknowledgement of God's revelation
[1:02:16] or truth it's also a personal surrender
[1:02:21] to that truth an ultimately truth is a
[1:02:29] person Christ himself now now that we
[1:02:34] have that covered we know it's a firm
[1:02:35] conviction it's producing
[1:02:38] acknowledgement of God's revelation or
[1:02:41] truth or his word which is himself
[1:02:43] you're acknowledging that he is God is
[1:02:48] who he says he is you've got that far
[1:02:51] but to reach a total and complete belief
[1:02:57] to say I believe and for its stick deep
[1:03:01] down in your heart has to come to a
[1:03:03] point where it's a conduct inspired by
[1:03:08] that surrender to God and what does that
[1:03:12] mean a conduct inspired by that
[1:03:15] surrender is that it's not just that
[1:03:19] huffy surrender it's not just that okay
[1:03:22] I guess so but it's a surrender that
[1:03:25] causes such a conduct to anyone that
[1:03:28] sees you and your actions and your
[1:03:30] conduct will go I know what you believe
[1:03:34] why because it's so obvious in your
[1:03:38] conduct it's become such a way of life
[1:03:41] it's not I believe but just in case I
[1:03:45] have this other plan just in case
[1:03:48] I got this oh just in case I have a plan
[1:03:55] in case God fails I have a really good
[1:03:57] second plan that you don't you didn't
[1:04:00] believe to begin with if somebody if you
[1:04:04] tell someone I hate look I believe
[1:04:09] you're gonna do something I
[1:04:12] I tell I asked let's say I asked whether
[1:04:14] Joseph to do something for me
[1:04:16] and he said yeah yeah I'll do it and I
[1:04:18] said good good I really believe you okay
[1:04:20] and then a minute he says that I walked
[1:04:22] over to brother Scott and said brother
[1:04:23] Scott look it I really need you to do
[1:04:25] this and I asked him to do the same
[1:04:27] thing why would I ask two people to do
[1:04:33] the same thing because I don't believe
[1:04:36] one of them's gonna do it you know and
[1:04:41] that's the way we approach God with our
[1:04:43] life so many times is we go Lord I
[1:04:46] believe you're able to see me through
[1:04:48] this but just in case you're not I'm
[1:04:52] gonna put some plans together to get me
[1:04:54] through I believe you have a plan for my
[1:04:57] life but just in case your plan don't
[1:05:00] work out I have a really good one to
[1:05:02] fall back on you know and then we wonder
[1:05:08] why don't why don't I feel God moving in
[1:05:10] my life why don't why don't I see him
[1:05:13] why don't I see the miracles why don't I
[1:05:15] see why don't I feel his presence why
[1:05:17] don't I because there's unbelief there's
[1:05:22] unbelief because as we were speaking
[1:05:25] about earlier all these attributes
[1:05:28] aren't the sin the sin is the unbelief
[1:05:32] the doubt it creeps in and it attacks
[1:05:36] you at the place where you're the only
[1:05:39] place you are able to defend yourself
[1:05:40] which is faith faith in God's Word and
[1:05:43] we know that because he Paul brought to
[1:05:48] us what how we're supposed to defend
[1:05:49] ourselves with the armor of God and if
[1:05:55] you go ahead and turn with me I'll get
[1:05:58] it here
[1:06:05] out of order here with my notes but
[1:06:08] that's alright
[1:06:08] Ephesians six Ephesians six and we're
[1:06:21] gonna read verse thirteen and it says
[1:06:28] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:06:30] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:06:33] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:06:36] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:06:39] Girt about with the truth and having on
[1:06:42] the breastplate of righteousness and
[1:06:44] your feet shod with the preparation of
[1:06:47] the gospel of peace and above all taking
[1:06:50] the shield of faith wherewith you're
[1:06:53] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:06:56] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:06:58] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[1:07:00] which is the word of God so here we are
[1:07:06] our armor to defend ourselves and win
[1:07:10] the victory over self is all described
[1:07:17] right here you have the feel of the
[1:07:21] shield of faith but if there's doubt in
[1:07:24] in there where's your shield at you
[1:07:29] wonder why the enemy is getting through
[1:07:32] but you've laid down your shield you
[1:07:35] have no defense you've laid down your
[1:07:38] shield the enemy doesn't even have to
[1:07:40] try because you've laid down your
[1:07:43] defense on the ground with that little
[1:07:46] bit of doubt you see that's what it is
[1:07:49] is the devil doesn't have to get you to
[1:07:51] disbelieve the whole Bible he doesn't
[1:07:55] have to get you to disbelieve there is a
[1:07:57] God he doesn't even have to get you to
[1:07:59] disbelieve that there was a prophet in
[1:08:01] this last day was a message for you for
[1:08:04] deliverance he's had to get you to
[1:08:06] disbelieve a little thing have a little
[1:08:09] bit of doubt just a little because
[1:08:12] that's where he did
[1:08:13] he came to Eve in the beginning he
[1:08:16] changed one word and it was one word
[1:08:22] that caused the fall and we know it'll
[1:08:25] take the entire word not one thing
[1:08:30] missing he said not to remove not one
[1:08:34] jot or one tittle to remove even a
[1:08:39] punctuation would be too much so here we
[1:08:48] are with the begin looking at it and
[1:08:51] seeing it and wondering what is going on
[1:08:57] where is our victory at and where are we
[1:09:00] losing the battle where is that doubt
[1:09:03] creeping into your life where is it
[1:09:06] sliding in where is it at because that
[1:09:14] when you can find that when you see that
[1:09:18] and then begin taking God back at his
[1:09:20] word now that faith shield of faith
[1:09:22] comes back up and you begin marching on
[1:09:25] marching on see it's not that the dart
[1:09:28] stopped coming he never promised that
[1:09:32] actually that they would if you had the
[1:09:35] shield of faith there'd be no battle but
[1:09:37] he's equipped you with that shield of
[1:09:39] faith because there is a constant battle
[1:09:42] see there's a constant the enemy is
[1:09:45] constantly coming and whether or not
[1:09:47] you're victorious depends on whether or
[1:09:50] not you are fully equipped with the
[1:09:52] armor of God but you know why so many
[1:09:57] people don't want to put on the armor
[1:09:59] because they don't want the
[1:10:01] responsibility of the armor
[1:10:10] it's the same reason that people don't
[1:10:13] want the Holy Ghost because people don't
[1:10:17] want the Holy Ghost because of the way
[1:10:19] it will make them act and you know when
[1:10:23] people hear that they immediately go
[1:10:26] back and think of the Pentecostal church
[1:10:28] or an Apostolic Church or or people
[1:10:31] running screaming shouting speaking in
[1:10:34] tongues kicking over chairs or dancing
[1:10:37] in the aisle that the Holy Ghost no no
[1:10:41] no no that has actually people can do
[1:10:46] that all the time without the Holy Ghost
[1:10:48] says that has very little to do with the
[1:10:49] Holy Ghost
[1:10:50] the reason they don't want the Holy
[1:10:52] Ghost is because of the way it will make
[1:10:58] them act the attributes they will have
[1:11:02] to manifest the attributes of the Holy
[1:11:06] Ghost there will be things they won't be
[1:11:10] able to hold on to anymore and they
[1:11:12] don't like that and some of the keys to
[1:11:20] that is at the beginning of Ephesians 6
[1:11:24] we read 13 through 17 where it speaks
[1:11:27] about the armor but if you read the
[1:11:29] beginning of that you find out he's
[1:11:31] speaking about the wearing and conduct
[1:11:34] associated with the armor he's leading
[1:11:38] up to it it says children obey your
[1:11:42] parents in the Lord for this is right
[1:11:44] what does that sound familiar to God's
[1:11:49] Word all the way back from Exodus honor
[1:11:55] thy father and mother which is the first
[1:11:59] commandment with promise do you want to
[1:12:03] wear the armor because this is the
[1:12:06] conduct that will produce that it may be
[1:12:09] well with thee and thou mayst live long
[1:12:11] on the earth and ye father's provoke not
[1:12:15] your children to wrath
[1:12:20] just because you're in charge doesn't
[1:12:21] give you the right to do anything you
[1:12:22] want because either your wife your son
[1:12:27] your daughter your husband these are
[1:12:30] relationships you have with these
[1:12:32] individuals second not first the first
[1:12:37] relationship you have with each and
[1:12:38] every individual is as a another son or
[1:12:41] daughter of God and how you treat these
[1:12:44] little ones he said if you were to treat
[1:12:47] one of them incorrectly it'd be better
[1:12:48] for you if you have a millstone tied
[1:12:51] around your neck and be cast into the
[1:12:53] ocean than to offend one of these little
[1:12:55] ones and that's not just applying to the
[1:12:59] sinner who treats you incorrectly they
[1:13:03] don't know no better how much more does
[1:13:06] that apply to us how much more is the
[1:13:08] Holy Spirit grieved when we treat each
[1:13:11] other in that way you see we're grieving
[1:13:15] away that holy spirit we're grieving it
[1:13:19] away why cause of unbelief provoke not
[1:13:25] your children to wrath but bring them up
[1:13:27] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:13:30] Lord
[1:13:31] what is that that's that commandment
[1:13:33] that you love one another the nurture
[1:13:38] and admonition of the Lord how are you
[1:13:39] ever going to nurture and add admonish
[1:13:41] in the way of the Lord if it's not
[1:13:46] expressed to the love of God you can't
[1:13:52] you can't you can't express God's
[1:13:56] nurture you can't raise someone up in
[1:14:00] the way of the Lord
[1:14:01] outside of God's love because at some
[1:14:05] point your humaneness will kick in your
[1:14:08] humanity will kick in and you'll do
[1:14:12] something you shouldn't but it's through
[1:14:15] that commandment applying that
[1:14:18] commandment to your life will then apply
[1:14:22] all of these it'll produce all of these
[1:14:25] attributes servants be obedient to them
[1:14:29] that are your masters
[1:14:32] now we may not be slaves or servants in
[1:14:36] today's day and age but we all work for
[1:14:39] somebody you see and he's not talking to
[1:14:44] us saying well if he treats you well if
[1:14:48] they treat you okay and pay you well
[1:14:50] make nice 401k and great health benefits
[1:14:53] do do the old adage of I work as hard as
[1:14:57] they pay me for
[1:14:59] that's not they're not not as far as I
[1:15:02] can see it's not Oh be obedient
[1:15:04] depending on on the compensation
[1:15:06] it says servants be obedient to them
[1:15:09] that are your masters according to the
[1:15:11] flesh with fear and trembling and
[1:15:15] singleness of your heart as unto Christ
[1:15:19] so it's providing a conduct that it's
[1:15:23] associated with the armor down below a
[1:15:27] conduct that's associated with the
[1:15:29] commandment here we go not with
[1:15:36] eyeservice as men pleasers
[1:15:38] but as servants of Christ doing the will
[1:15:40] of God from the heart there it is again
[1:15:46] it's more detail on top of that
[1:15:51] commandment not being Grievous it's an
[1:15:55] action from the heart that action of
[1:15:58] love where you're fulfilling that
[1:16:00] commandment of love one another is just
[1:16:05] coming out of your heart why because the
[1:16:08] love of God has been imparted and it's
[1:16:10] been filled
[1:16:11] it's that Holy Ghost that's come in that
[1:16:13] life of Christ and that love of God is
[1:16:17] just pouring forth pouring forth pouring
[1:16:20] forth and that's what we're gonna have
[1:16:22] to come to for to reach that place of
[1:16:26] perfection to go in a rapture to reach
[1:16:29] that place of adoption is to buy that
[1:16:32] perfect love to be the one thing that
[1:16:34] takes full and total control of our
[1:16:36] lives we saw that in a manifestation of
[1:16:39] a life of a profit where God began work
[1:16:42] walking him through the steps of
[1:16:44] adoption
[1:16:45] and each step was an act greater of the
[1:16:48] love of God each step whether that was a
[1:16:52] step in speaking to nature where that
[1:16:55] was a step of creation where there was a
[1:16:57] step of speaking to the storm whether
[1:17:00] that was a step of speaking to the the
[1:17:03] man that was not just afflicted but
[1:17:08] possessed of the devil the love of God
[1:17:13] projected and to control that situation
[1:17:16] it wasn't in anger it wasn't in malice
[1:17:19] it wasn't I strike you dead but the love
[1:17:24] of God took control
[1:17:25] now that man only received as much
[1:17:30] benefit from that as a stone or a rock
[1:17:33] falling off a hill because later they
[1:17:36] asked for their Branham he said that
[1:17:38] manna fell across your feet he said was
[1:17:40] he delivered and he said no he wasn't he
[1:17:43] worshiped that devil and so he was not
[1:17:48] delivered he did not seek deliverance
[1:17:50] but the love of God stopped that devil
[1:17:54] in his tracks
[1:17:56] you see and you follow it on through on
[1:18:01] through on through to the greatest one
[1:18:04] or brother branham's there in that
[1:18:06] meeting and there's there's two young
[1:18:09] people on the front row that young
[1:18:12] couple and they're messing around on the
[1:18:15] front row and he warns them three times
[1:18:20] he says don't do that live later young
[1:18:24] man I asked you don't do that
[1:18:26] young man I asked you not to do that and
[1:18:29] then the Lord came down and he said
[1:18:32] whatever you say that's what will happen
[1:18:36] to them you say for them to death and
[1:18:41] they'll drop right there on the ground
[1:18:43] and they'll pack them out like Ananias
[1:18:45] and Sapphira you see but this was a test
[1:18:48] this was a test of was this commandment
[1:18:53] that God had placed in his word
[1:18:58] being gonna be manifested was that love
[1:19:02] of God so powerful that is so changed
[1:19:05] that human reaction because the human
[1:19:09] reaction is they're wrong death that's
[1:19:13] back to the law that's why they enjoyed
[1:19:16] it so much they liked it because it gave
[1:19:20] him it made him feel powerful right but
[1:19:25] the love of God which is even more
[1:19:27] powerful stepped in on the scene and
[1:19:30] turned and said I forgive you go and sin
[1:19:34] no more
[1:19:35] you see that's why we're called to that
[1:19:38] commandment because we're not called to
[1:19:43] cast judgment we're called as Christ to
[1:19:48] bring deliverance deliverance in
[1:19:50] people's lives from from the doubt
[1:19:53] deliverance from from the fear
[1:19:55] deliverance from what it is that's
[1:19:57] afflicting them deliverance in healing
[1:19:58] and that can't happen
[1:20:01] in a in it in a in an atmosphere of
[1:20:05] judgment of judgment that is casting not
[1:20:12] just judging a situation but judgment
[1:20:16] that is bringing a sentence because in
[1:20:22] the face of complete and total holiness
[1:20:26] and righteousness not one of us will
[1:20:28] stand on our own there was that that
[1:20:35] evangelist Danny Henry there he was he
[1:20:39] had that dream where he passed away and
[1:20:42] he's coming and the light is growing
[1:20:45] stronger and stronger and as he gets the
[1:20:48] point where that light is reached its
[1:20:50] ultimate brightness he hears the voice
[1:20:52] to reach out to him ask him
[1:21:00] you ever did you ever still did you ever
[1:21:03] lie and goes down the list he said I
[1:21:04] didn't think I'd done any of those
[1:21:06] things he said but in the in the
[1:21:09] presence of that light in the presence
[1:21:12] of that ultimate judge said there were
[1:21:16] things he can to come out he said is
[1:21:19] about to prepare to hear the judgement
[1:21:23] fall the judgement come down department
[1:21:27] from me you worker of iniquity into
[1:21:30] utter darkness and then from the side
[1:21:34] heard saying I heard the sweetest voice
[1:21:37] I ever heard and he said father he may
[1:21:41] have done those things but when he was
[1:21:43] on earth he stood for me what was that
[1:21:46] love projected love projected why
[1:21:50] because scripture tell us that love will
[1:21:52] cover a multitude of sin see it doesn't
[1:21:55] say that it makes it okay it's not just
[1:22:01] a come do is you come as you are and
[1:22:04] stay as you are but love will cover that
[1:22:06] sin and bring then bring you through
[1:22:09] that slow steps of grace it will walk
[1:22:12] you through justification like you've
[1:22:15] never done it now it'll step you into
[1:22:17] sanctification and clean it was synced
[1:22:19] if ocation will clean up your life
[1:22:21] justification will be as if you've never
[1:22:22] done it that's that love projecting
[1:22:25] God's love is projecting and projecting
[1:22:27] and growing stronger and stronger and
[1:22:29] stronger and next step is the baptism of
[1:22:32] the Holy Ghost that's a little bit more
[1:22:34] of the love of God because that's what
[1:22:35] God's own life being inserted in and God
[1:22:37] is love if we go there to the book first
[1:22:41] to the st. John and begin there and says
[1:22:44] God where he ends of speak about how he
[1:22:47] was coming and God was the word and the
[1:22:49] Word was made flesh and he dwelt among
[1:22:51] us and that love of God word zing
[1:22:53] projected to his people you see all the
[1:22:57] way from the beginning here he gung
[1:22:59] comes he's stepping down through the
[1:23:01] ramparts of heaven to the point where he
[1:23:04] he's no longer this unattainable being a
[1:23:07] creator the universe but due to his love
[1:23:11] for the individual due to his love for
[1:23:14] you he came stepping down from the
[1:23:16] ramparts of glory to become as you to
[1:23:20] suffer as you to fill the pain to fill
[1:23:23] the agony to be tempted and to ever
[1:23:27] overcome so that he could then lead by
[1:23:31] example and overcome through you if
[1:23:35] you'll just allow him to where we I need
[1:23:41] to wrap this up here just one less
[1:24:12] wrap up with one last thought and we'll
[1:24:14] pick up from here on Sunday
[1:24:28] now in first John five there we're
[1:24:31] speaking about it was speaking about the
[1:24:33] victory it also speaks about I'm gonna
[1:24:37] mix up my scriptures not may not do that
[1:24:41] when I tie this together real quick here
[1:24:43] before we leave
[1:25:08] here it is st. John read there and st.
[1:25:13] John 15 in verse 16 this go over it one
[1:25:17] last time here said you have not chosen
[1:25:20] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[1:25:23] you that you should go and bring forth
[1:25:25] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:25:28] and that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[1:25:31] Father in my name he may give it you in
[1:25:37] Galatians 5 in 22 but the fruit of the
[1:25:43] Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering
[1:25:51] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[1:25:57] temperance against such there is no law
[1:26:05] you see that covenant to love one
[1:26:10] another that covenant to express that
[1:26:15] he's asked us to attain to the love of
[1:26:18] God the armour of God these asking us to
[1:26:23] wear the fruit he's asking us to bear is
[1:26:33] laid out it's very specific and it's not
[1:26:38] something that he wants you to bear
[1:26:41] every once in a while
[1:26:42] you see but he wants us go back to even
[1:26:47] as the trees in the Garden of Eden who
[1:26:51] always had fruit on the vine you see how
[1:26:55] do I know that it's because once Jesus
[1:26:59] was walking with his disciples and he
[1:27:02] walked by a fig tree and it says he knew
[1:27:06] it was not the season of fruit but he
[1:27:09] was hungry and he looked and there was
[1:27:11] no fruit and he cursed it he cursed the
[1:27:16] church
[1:27:18] now why if he knew it wasn't the season
[1:27:23] for fruit we look into the tree looking
[1:27:27] for fruit and when he found no fruit
[1:27:30] curse the tree you see because he can
[1:27:35] remember back to the Garden of Eden
[1:27:39] there were he walked with Adam and the
[1:27:44] fruit was always on the find the fruit
[1:27:49] was always there
[1:27:49] it was always bearing and we as trees in
[1:27:55] God's garden he's calling us back to
[1:28:00] Eden back to a state where we're always
[1:28:04] bearing his fruit not just in certain
[1:28:07] seasons not just in the spring not not
[1:28:13] just in in the fall or certain a certain
[1:28:15] time six weeks out of the year
[1:28:17] but he says whether you're in the spring
[1:28:20] of your life whether you're in the
[1:28:23] summer of your life whether you're in
[1:28:26] the fall of your life or whether you're
[1:28:28] going through the coldest of winters he
[1:28:34] says bear much fruit you see the bearing
[1:28:39] of fruit on your tree is not subject to
[1:28:43] the climate it's not subject to the
[1:28:47] atmosphere around you but it's subject
[1:28:50] to the atmosphere you create it's
[1:28:53] subject to how you're allowing God to
[1:28:55] work in your life because children of
[1:28:58] God are messiahs many messiahs with the
[1:29:05] power to create the atmosphere that they
[1:29:08] live in and he said if you're not
[1:29:10] bearing fruit it's because you are not
[1:29:13] taking care of the atmosphere that I've
[1:29:17] called you your garden you see the
[1:29:22] Garden of Eden was not the whole entire
[1:29:23] earth at the time it was a special place
[1:29:27] and so is it today is we have our Garden
[1:29:32] of Eden our place of promise the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost we know that the Holy Ghost is the
[1:29:38] land of promise and we've entered in and
[1:29:43] we should be taking and partaking of the
[1:29:45] fruit of the land but are you what how
[1:29:50] are you treating God's garden what kind
[1:29:53] of atmosphere are you maintaining in
[1:29:54] God's garden it is an is it an
[1:29:57] atmosphere that is conducive to the
[1:30:00] production of fruit because this is what
[1:30:04] he's asking of you he's asking that the
[1:30:07] fruit of love always be on your mind
[1:30:10] that those passing by who would have
[1:30:14] need wouldn't have to think about what
[1:30:17] time of year is it or what season is it
[1:30:19] but they could reach up and pull and the
[1:30:25] fruit that they have need of would come
[1:30:28] off the vine you see cuz that's he's
[1:30:32] calling us to be more like him he's not
[1:30:35] calling us to be more like ourselves
[1:30:38] he's wanting you to be more like him and
[1:30:41] as we go to him and as we go desiring of
[1:30:48] him whatever your need might be he's
[1:30:51] there to grant it he also then wants you
[1:30:54] as he's given you to give unto others so
[1:30:59] the love he's placed in your life he
[1:31:00] wants you to express that as people walk
[1:31:03] by that the fruit of joy that's supposed
[1:31:09] to be in your life
[1:31:10] someone could reach up and talk a little
[1:31:12] bit of joy once again
[1:31:15] that joy it's not it's not based on
[1:31:21] life's current condition it's not based
[1:31:25] on the current weather pattern it's not
[1:31:28] a star is your life okay your youth in a
[1:31:34] in a season of blessing are you in a
[1:31:36] season of trial because you're called to
[1:31:41] produce fruit no matter the season that
[1:31:46] joy is supposed to be flooding out of
[1:31:48] you
[1:31:49] I suppose we see something that's
[1:31:51] radiating forth peace the peace of God
[1:31:59] someone in need a peace should be able
[1:32:03] to come and pull a bit of peace from
[1:32:07] your your tree they should be able to
[1:32:11] enter into that presence that you've
[1:32:12] created that the atmosphere you created
[1:32:16] such an atmosphere where God's presence
[1:32:18] continually feels welcomed and as they
[1:32:22] step in to that atmosphere you created
[1:32:25] they're also stepping into the presence
[1:32:27] of God one in the same one in the same
[1:32:31] and the peace that they're needing can
[1:32:33] flood their soul long-suffering that
[1:32:41] fruit a long suffering I think we run
[1:32:43] into people who need that more often
[1:32:45] than not out of all the fruits on the
[1:32:48] tree probably more often we run into
[1:32:50] those that need long-suffering because
[1:32:57] they don't have the Holy Ghost you see
[1:33:02] we have a responsibility that others
[1:33:08] don't
[1:33:11] the Holy Ghost has come
[1:33:17] to control and to shape every aspect of
[1:33:21] your life your actions your reactions so
[1:33:27] those that you come in contact they
[1:33:30] don't have that they just whatever comes
[1:33:34] to them that animalistic nature just
[1:33:37] just reaches out and wants to jump out
[1:33:42] and scratch and bite and go after
[1:33:45] anybody who's close enough to get at the
[1:33:49] year called to be long-suffering because
[1:33:52] that Holy Ghost has come to give you
[1:33:54] that power to be long-suffering you know
[1:33:58] not too many people would would look at
[1:33:59] long suffering and look oh that's that's
[1:34:01] a super power but long suffering can
[1:34:06] only come through the power of the Holy
[1:34:08] Ghost gentleness goodness faith and they
[1:34:18] that are Christ's have crucified the
[1:34:20] flesh and the affections and lusts we'll
[1:34:25] close with that we'll come back over and
[1:34:28] we'll take another look at this on
[1:34:29] Sunday because just like each one of
[1:34:34] these fruits of the spirit they're not
[1:34:39] big things but it takes a big God and a
[1:34:45] real revelation and a real surrender of
[1:34:48] your will your thoughts your abilities
[1:34:53] in order to have these fruits become
[1:34:57] attributes in your life so is it the
[1:35:02] things that he calls us not to be like
[1:35:06] we we we always real quickly identify
[1:35:11] the big things
[1:35:12] stealing adultery fornication and we're
[1:35:16] like oh we know what those are there's
[1:35:18] some little ones in here
[1:35:20] and when you begin to look at what they
[1:35:22] are they're little they're real little
[1:35:25] there's things we don't even think about
[1:35:27] but we'll come back to that
[1:35:29] let's just pray musicians if you would
[1:35:33] come back
[1:35:34] Heavenly Father Lord we just bring you
[1:35:38] this before you this little broken
[1:35:41] message father I know I at least as far
[1:35:43] as my notes go I skipped all over Lord
[1:35:47] but I asked it it would be a blessing to
[1:35:49] one person father if nothing else if
[1:35:52] lord I know this is something that I
[1:35:55] need more of father that you lord I
[1:35:58] would be a completely surrendered vessel
[1:36:00] that there would be a victory over this
[1:36:03] flesh father that you would be come the
[1:36:06] one that would be the complete and
[1:36:10] guiding light and the one who would
[1:36:13] bring direction to my life father Lord
[1:36:18] that I would have nothing to do in the
[1:36:21] influencing of decisions that Lord take
[1:36:24] me through life father but that you
[1:36:26] would be the one I'd reach up and take
[1:36:29] you by the hand and father just
[1:36:31] following your footsteps Lord not not
[1:36:34] looking to see how can I see into the
[1:36:37] distance or can I see the future or can
[1:36:39] I see what's gonna happen Lord but let
[1:36:42] go of all the doubts and the fears
[1:36:43] father that would want to bind me father
[1:36:46] to not trust an Lord build a fully trust
[1:36:50] and obey and enter into this commandment
[1:36:54] where the love of God is expressed to
[1:36:57] your people I pray in Jesus most
[1:37:00] wonderful and precious name I ask you go
[1:37:02] with your people father
