see many people you know with with all the the riots that is going on in people's mind and in people's spirit people turned to look at thanksgiving with all the evil that came after but the truth the real thanksgiving was when the foreign fathers got here you know it was it was it was a time to bring the entire nation to to her knees and say lay for your hands and give thanks it was after before people start doing the rest of what you know to be the evil that is attached to thanksgiving he says [Music] the pilgrim father said that they decided to give thanks to god for what we had what he had done for us for blessing them giving them crops and so forth is one real american day all the other days like saint patrick's i will put christmas and the rest of them and halloween and whatever it is

make it and we sure thank the lord for all he's done for us amen amen god bless you if you have your bibles this morning while you're standing with us uh we won't try not to hold you too long but we do have some things here burning up on our heart this morning in the book of psalms the hundredth chapter the book of psalms 100th chapter we want to look there in the first verse and we say god bless you all and pray that you have a wonderful thanksgiving with your families and time together and we just thank the lord for all he's done for us amen amen i have a thought here on my heart this morning and i just pray it'll be a blessing and a help to you in the book of psalms the hundredth chapter we want to look there and uh we want to say the lord is good this morning and i think every now and again we just need to take some time and give him some praise and i think this morning ought to be one of them times he's done a lot for us amen in psalms 100 verse 1 david says make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture into his gate into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise notice this be thankful unto him be thankful unto him and bless his name be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and it's true somebody say his truth his truth not necessarily our truth or your truth but his truth endureth to all generations in the book of colossians the third chapter i have one verse there we want to look at amen colossians chapter 3 and verse 15. amen colossians 3 and verse 15. paul here writing says let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body so the bride of jesus christ is one body this morning you're called in one body notice what paul says and be thankful my isn't that something you're called by the peace of god let the peace of god rule in your hearts then you're called into the one body and paul says and be thankful amen i'll say this morning i'm thankful to be in the body amen must bow our hearts together heavenly father lord thy word is true this morning and as your believers have gathered here today father we have not gathered out of ritual we have not gathered out of tradition we have not gathered out of just coming for another service but oh god we have gathered here because your word is a lamp and to our path it is a lot lord unto our path it is a lamp and to our feet and lord we have gathered here this morning as eagles lord not as vultures not as buzzards lord feeding up on vulture ideas but here eating the eagle food lord the eagle man oh god and i pray this morning lord that the spirit of god would rain down in this building father may the heart of thanksgiving burst open here today lord made lives realize that they're only here because of the grace of god may we realize today lord there's nothing we could have done lord to merit or to to to be where we are today but god who is rich in mercy lord you loved us when we was unlovable you called us lord when we was uncallable lord you you beckoned to our hearts and there was a seat there it was placed there for before the foundation of the world lord desiring that quickening power the holy ghost may you move here today father satan you are defeated today in the name of jesus christ may the spirit of god have liberty in the hearts of your children lord move us aside today dear god and give us the grace lord to speak the things which you've laid upon our hearts and we'll be sure to give you all the praise and to give you all the honor it's in jesus mighty name we ask amen and amen and all the believers said amen god bless you this morning as you have your seats i want you by the help of the lord here just to speak to you for a few moments and if i would title this today i want to speak to you for a few moments here on lord i am thankful lord i'm thankful how many this morning we could just open up the service and say lord i'm thankful lord i'm thankful i i realize you've done a lot for me you you provided a lot for us you brought us through another year you sustained this through a world that's fallen apart through confusions through all kinds of things lord i'm thankful you've been good to me and i think of here how david in psalms 104 says enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise and be thankful unto him and bless his name now we all realize this morning that we are in the house of god we have gathered here in the house of god we've gathered here for one purpose that is to worship him that is to magnify him that is to amen to lift him up above all of our problems to lift him up above all the things we're going through and to bless his holy name and i think it's amazing how that david gives instructions on entering the house of god he actually gives us instructions he says when you come into where you've been invited to he said first of all recognize that this is his house amen recognize this as his gates and in other words david is saying amen be thankful that you've been invited into his gates be thankful that he's given you a privilege be thankful that he's given you a call amen to come into his house and then david shows you amen that when you come in here how you should come in amen you should come in with thanksgiving unto god amen with praise and blessings unto his name david knew amen that if praises went up then blessings would come down amen amen when praises go up amen blessings come down and to thank this morning church amen that we come to church too many times and we come even with all kinds of things on our mind the troubles and the situations and the trials and all the things we're going through we come with those things amen up on our mind and it's so easy amen to come in here and still be thinking about those things it's so easy they meant to be sitting there hearing the word amen and be thinking about all the troubles and all the things you're going through amen but to think here this morning amen that we have not come here to give our attention to the problems amen but we've come to give our attention to the problem solved amen we've not come here have been to talk about our troubles and talk about our problems amen but to remember that there is still a god amen that can change the situation my when i think of that i think of how the prophet says lord i am thankful i i am very thankful thanksgiving to you lord amen not for natural feud yet that but lord the end time is here amen how many will agree this morning the end time is here amen i'm thankful for this spiritual food amen amen lord the spiritual food of the seven seals was promised to be open you say that'll be something different no no you can't add one word it's already in there it's just he and it's sealed how many understands that say amen amen see well that's a mystery will come forth oh no it's already written you can't add one word to it or take one word from it it's in there already in there it's just got to be revealed in the last day amen now if we were living in any other day amen then that quote right there should not cause us to say amen if we was living in another age amen that quote would not inspire a praise to come out of our hearts amen but because we're living amen in the end time amen we're living in the last days amen well what is head has been revealed amen what right to shout and dance and rejoice in the spirit of god it's the bride you say why amen because the word has come open and it has produced a food it has produced a sustaining food it has produced a word that will change our bodies my i'll say it like the prophet said lord i'm thankful amen lord i'm thankful i'm thankful this morning that i'm not preaching from a close book amen i'm thankful this morning that i'm not preaching from a mystery i'm thankful this morning that my god amen is not hid behind a veil amen but he sent a man by the name of william branham amen that would fulfill malachi 4 and would fulfill revelation 10 and when fulfilled luke 17 30 and would fulfill first thessalonians 4 and would take the mighty god amen and unveil him before the church and say now church amen the god that was back there is the god that is here this morning and he is the same he is the same yesterday amen today and forever oh somebody said lord i'm thankful amen lord i'm thankful i know who god is lord i'm thankful i know what he is i know what he does i know how he moves i am thankful and then we find that in the end time we're living in there is going to be two types of people amen there's going to be a thankful people and then there's going to be an unthankful people now timothy says in second timothy 3 1 this know also that in the last days which is the days we're living in in the last days there shall be perilous times perilous times shall come amen for men shall be lovers of their own selves they shall be covetous and boasters and proud and blasphemers disobedient to parents amen unthankful unpleasing and unholy now that word unthankful means unpleasing so amen so no matter how much you do amen you can never do enough that'll please them hey amen no matter how much you give you can never give enough it'll please them it's actually amen an end-time sign amen that there'll be an unthankful people amen but remember if there's a unthankful people then there's got to be a thankful people the prophet said we see lazarus he went away from the home speaking of jesus and as soon as jesus left the home amen sickness set in sorrow said him and listen christians when jesus leaves your home amen sickness and trouble will set in right behind it when he leaves your home get ready for trouble because it's on its road right then you welcome him into your house and you let him be the unseen guest and set down at the table and never eat without thanking him for it i see many people call themselves christians he said never return thanks just as illiterate as a hog under an apple tree amen a hall can sit under an apple tree and the apples would beat him on the head all day long and he'll eat till he can't eat no more and grunt no more hardly but he'll never look up amen and see where they're coming from he said that's exactly right and people just so unthankful unholy without natural affection they're truth breakers they're false accusers they're incontinent they're fierce despises those that are good traitors hating amen high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god amen having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away that's what the spirit said in timothy he said the time is coming when they're going to be unthankful now amen can i preach this morning amen america has lost her identification amen let me say it this way she has lost her identification as a christian nation can you say amen amen what she done was she took on amen the identification of the world and become a sinful nation now psalms 9 17 david said the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god the prophet comes along and says let every enemy wind themselves to death because they couldn't get to them oh they felt perfectly safe they had the best and it come to pass that when any nation that forgets god and puts all their hopes up on military mind they're on the road to destruction god is no respecter person sin is a reproach to any nation he said so while inside the great walls fell amen they felt very safe amen then to thank this morning church that america right now the very nation we're living in the very country amen that we're sitting in this morning is right for judgment amen is laying in a perfect condition amen for destruction amen she's laying in a perfect place amen for the bombs and all the things to fall upon her you say how did she get there because she lost her thanksgiving and then she lost her spirit of thankfulness amen and by losing that she lost her identification as a christian nation and she put her military as the principle she put her hopes upon other things other than god amen and i'll say this morning church any person that'll take their hope off of god and put it up on the military put it up on a church put it upon a man that man that woman that family whatever it is is headed for destruction may i say this morning we may never amen we can never take our hope out of god my then to think this morning amen that thanksgiving what a what a thanksgiving time it is thanksgiving is the only american amen christian holiday left amen you say what about easter well you see easter they swap christ on easter for a rabbit and new clothes and a couple of flowers amen amen you say well what about thanksgiving amen how can you say that amen they meant but right now they're even trying to break thanksgiving yes that's right amen can we preach this morning amen right now they're trying to break the backbone of thanksgiving amen what was thanksgiving it used to be families come together amen friends come together and then you get around a table and you would offer thanks unto god for the food that was sitting there and then you would bow your head you would shake each other's hand you would hug each other's neck you would begin to talk about all the things amen that god had done for you that week and you would partake of a meal and you would have a good time amen but you realize right now amen there's an all-out attack even on thanksgiving amen where we can't even come together as families and i'm going to preach this morning can't even come together amen and get together and have fellowship amen a few years ago amen it used to be that thanksgiving was a good time to get together amen but you know what they done they said well we'll make it a little bit more we'll make black friday back thursday night amen so then you had families that couldn't even sit down and eat together amen because they was worried about something on sale at the store and they had to get out there by six o'clock had to get out there by five o'clock amen see what happened amen the spirit of the nation is an unthankful nation it's an unfaithful spirit amen but i defy that spirit in the name of jesus christ i say oh god whatever you do lord don't take the spirit of thanksgiving away from my heart don't ever let me come to a spot that i lay aside amen a spirit of thankfulness amen for a spirit of greed or a spirit of money my to thank this morning church the only american christian holiday left is thanksgiving now brother brother juan didn't know i had this quote in my notes but it was there amen tomorrow is thanksgiving it's a day that is set aside where our pilgrim forefathers set that day aside amen to give thanks unto god for what he has done for blessing them for giving them crops and so forth it's one real american day all other days like st patrick's and so forth come across from the seas but this is an american holiday thanksgiving day and tonight i want to say there's so many things that i'm thankful for i don't know how amen to give thanks to god for so many blessings amen set your family down set your children about and tell them that this nation was built upon such as that amen our forefathers who brought to bring us this freedom and left the other country that so we could have freedom of worship and freedom of speech and freedom of press and so forth and we're thankful yet for it amen how many will say i'm thankful amen for the freedoms amen that our forefathers fault amen to bring into this country amen that we could sit here this morning we could preach from the bible we could gather without the threat of going to jail we could lift up holy hands oh i don't know what the devil's trying to press against this meeting this morning but i'm going to press back against him i think right here this morning is a good time amen to lift the roof off of this place with a thanksgiving praise unto god my to thank amen we come here amen we're here this morning and we are thankful amen i'm just going to preach here for a little bit and give you some things that i'm thankful for amen lord i'm thankful you brought me to the banqueting table amen to partake of the spiritual thanksgiving feast song of solomon 2 amen verse 1 says i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys as the lily among thorns amen soul is my love among the daughters as the apple tree among the trees of the wood amen soul is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow amen with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste he brought me amen he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me is love thank you jesus he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me is love the prophet said neither will a christian amen eat on that dedicarians from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of god amen press the promise of the hour god promised rabbits in the days of luther he promised other things in the days of others but now somebody say but now amen but now he promised us a full square meal the full seven course menu for all the seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of god amen to those who can receive how many receivers have we got here this morning amen how many will say lord i believe the word is open i believe the table is spread i believe the seven course meal is laying on the table i believe it this morning god and now i come amen to receive from it [Applause] says something to me how that people say they're getting in the holiday spirit amen they'll say they are getting in the thanksgiving spirit they'll say they are getting in the christmas spirit amen i believe we as christians and especially especially as the bride of the lord jesus christ i believe we should dwell in the spirit of thanksgiving amen i don't think we should be thankful amen one week out of the year no i don't think we should be thankful one service out of the year i don't think we should be thankful amen just on the sunday before thanksgiving or the sunday after thanksgiving but i think on the fourth of july we ought to be faithful i think in the middle of march we ought to be thankful i think in the middle of august we ought to be thankful every day amen that we live upon this earth we ought to be faithful we ought to be thankful we ought to be thankful amen that god saved our soul amen that god ain't been provided a lamb and then god provided a sacrifice i thank you this morning lord i thank you for healing my party i thank you for saving my soul i thank you for the holy ghost i thank you for the message of the hour i thank you for a message church i thank you for a message pastor i thank you for divine healing i thank you for redemption i thank you for restoration i thank you lord lord i'm thankful oh lord i'm thankful amen by losing the spirit of thanksgiving you know what it does it opens the door to corruption by losing the spirit of thanksgiving it opens the door to corruption paul said in romans 1 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god amen notice what paul says and neither were thankful amen when they knew god they glorified him not as god and neither were thankful but became vain they become vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened even see what that word glorified means it means to cause the dignity amen the worth of some person or the thing amen to become manifest and acknowledged amen the re they they reasoned away amen they are reasoned away the manifestation of god in the church amen they reasoned away the power of god they reasoned away the ability of god amen and in doing that they devalued the power of god amen among his people now and the message is your life worthy of the gospel he said the other day down here a certain little church little league team was playing down here at the park and my brother-in-law's with a boy is a pitcher amen for some of their teams he said there was a pastor with these little fellows out there on the ground amen playing and the pastor smoked a cigarette after cigarettes of a real neighborly church right here by us and can you imagine even people sitting in the audience noticed it but it's getting so that they don't even pay attention to it and a certain great church a baptist church that i know of lets the church out from sunday school 15 extra minutes so that the pastor and all them can stand outside smoke before they come back in to serve the duty of the lord he said john smith the founder of that church prayed so hard that god sent a revival till it swolled till his eyes swole shut at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon that man would turn over in his grave yes if he know that church had got in that condition he said what is it they were bidding to come and turned it down they were bidding to come and turn it down that's the only thing and you remember jesus said in here that those were bitten amen turned it down would not taste his supper amen now think of this church those that were bitten amen would not taste his supper now let me say this the hour has come when the people of this nation because they're unthankful amen will accept something of earthly value amen and reject the things of heavenly value which is of eternal value amen what are you talking about preacher i'm saying it like this amen the denominations are in the condition they're in this morning because they accepted they meant a man's idea about the bible than to accept the prophet amen that god sent in this generation with more than an idea about the bible amen but the perfect interpretation of the scriptures now in luke chapter 19 verse 41 and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it amen saying if thou has known even now at least in this day the things which belong unto thy peace amen but now they are hid from that eyes for the days shall come upon me that thine enemy shall cast the trench about me and capacity round about and keep me on every side and shall lay even thee with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee amen one stone upon another because thou knewest not amen the time of thy visitation amen somebody say the time of thy visitation they knew us not amen the time of thy visitation now that word visitation actually means inspection it means visitation the act by which god looks into and searches out the ways amen deeds and character men in order to judge them there lot accordingly whether joyous or sad to investigate now the prophet picks this up and says what if i was giving away capsules here that's scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well i'd have to get a militia out here and swarm them away from the place you wouldn't have to make an altar call for you would just have to beat them away to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the eternal god all his power of his resurrection which promises you eternal life and satan will put his legions out there and keep you away from it see yet you can look and sensible enough to look the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down see something ain't some kind of an excuse it's too hot i'm too tired i will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting by rejecting amen the day of visitation it separates you from god amen by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from god amen now how many has heard of the tape is your life worthy of the gospel you've heard of that tape and preaches is your life worthy of the gospel amen two of you three of you you've heard of it right are you awake amen you've heard of that tape amen now if you listen to it you'll find in there that brother takes luke 14 and he's going to show you amen or ask you a question he's going to say is your life worthy of the gospel but as you study through that tape you're going to hear him turn and say is your life worthy of the spiritual feast of the lord is your life worthy of the gospel is your life worthy of the spiritual feast amen in luke 14 let's let's look there in luke the 14th chapter and the 16th verse in luke 14 verse 16 then he said unto him a certain man made uh made a great supper and made many and is serving at separate time a sin is serving at supper time to say them that we're bidding come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray they have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray they have me excused and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant came and showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly in the streets and the lane to the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou is commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out in the highways amen and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be full be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bid and shall taste of my supper amen they were they were asked they were bid and there was a call given amen come and partake of this amen and let me say this they turned it down amen in other words they missed amen their day of hesitation amen they separate amen are you with me this morning amen they separated themselves from god amen by rejecting the invitation to come to the feast amen and let me set this way christ has given an invitation amen to the spiritual feast of the lord of these last days prophet says now we see when god gives a man an invitation to receive the invitation we find that man is done in all ages he gives excuses when god said noah his servant amen and made a way of escape for all the people who want to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned it noah but god made the way but they had an excuse amen he said they made an excuse in the days of moses made an excuse in the days of elijah made excuses in the days of christ and they make excuses today not him speaking directly to israel the ones that was called to the feast then i would also apply the day to men the church who has been been to come the feast and won't do it the spiritual feast of the lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses amen now now have you ever just taken time to read through there in the book of luke and hear the excuses they give like this i bought about oxen and i've got to go prove them i bought cattle i've got to go prove them let me ask y'all something who buys cattle without looking at him first are you hearing me amen they were coming with all kinds of excuses amen and you know what their excuses was as weak as this water amen y'all just have to forgive me i'm just a country preacher okay and that's all i can use is country terms amen their excuses had no value to him amen but notice here the prophet said what they were doing is they thought they were just excusing themselves from a feast but they was excusing themselves from the presence of the lord jesus christ and he said today the same excuse the same thing they don't want to come to the spiritual feast of the promised vindicated word so they don't come the spiritual feast they're invited to do you believe that god has given america an invitation the last 15 years to a great revival to a spiritual feast amen did they come no sir no sir then to reject to come is that life worthy of the gospel though they call themselves that amen see without even opening their mouths amen their very actions of refusing to come amen identified that their life was not worthy of the gospel or of the spiritual feast let me just quit get to the punch of this the message of the hour is the bride spiritual thanksgiving feast the message of the hour is the bride spiritual thanksgiving feast let me just go and preach here for a second if you're feeding on anything outside of this message you are wasting your time if you're eating on any other food outside of this message you are wasting your time this message is the promise vindicated amen inspired food of the hour and is going to lift the church off of the ground someday this is the message of the hour my then to thank this morning church amen that the prophet said now upon that basis we come to the feast of the trumpets amen they hid mysteries it's prophesied it was to be that way therefore it had to be revealed in the day it was but to be revealed in this last day to fulfill exactly what i'm just saying amen malachi the fourth chapter luke 17 30 hebrews 13 8 hebrews 4 12 and many of those scriptures that tell us now if that's foreign to some of you may i say that god always is known amongst his people by being prophetic amen let me just preach this morning if you have a problem with a prophet then there's a problem if you have a problem with this message you got a problem and if you got a problem with william branham being the fulfillment of malachi 4 and luke 17 30. then you've got a problem because god promised to come in the prophetic as a matter of fact he said they would return amen a prophetic message that would come to a prophetic people amen by a prophetic utterance oh church don't you see why the devil hates you it's because you're not a religious people amen you're not amen just citizens of a country even but you are a prophetic class of people that is received amen a prophetic message that'll lift you off the earth one of these days my mercy amen then to thank this morning church the prophet said god in sundried times that's what the bible says right in diverse matters amen spoke to the fathers through the prophets in this last days somebody say in this last days in this last days through his son christ jesus amen now notice here people argue and say there there can't be a prophet in this last day amen but paul says in ephesians 3 5 or 4 whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ verse 5 which in other ages was not made known unto the son to man as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by his spirit now when you think of this you begin to realize the prophet says what we've got today is a bunch of modern day lots are you with me they meant a bunch of modern day lots now what was lot they meant a lot amen abraham was a silver dollar amen lot was a penny right you know brother i'm taught that amen abraham was a super dollar he said now watch lot did not have the guts to make a stand amen lot did not have the backbone amen to go out there you realize a lot didn't agree with what was going on the bible i've got it right here in front of me the bible says for that righteous man dwelling among them and seen in hearing it vexed his righteous soul from day to day with the unlawful deeds amen what what lot was seeing done amen it vexed his soul they mean he knew it was wrong amen but there was not a backbone there ain't meant to go out there and stand face to face and say what's going on in this city is wrong it's an abomination amen and a prophet takes that and says do you realize we've got a lot of modern day lots amen but they're modern day lots when it comes to the pulpit he says now look how many lots in america yesterday reading their bible to prepare their message for the day and run across the water baptism in the name of jesus christ how many of them run across the baptism of the holy ghost how many ran across mark 16 john 14 12 if he abided me my words and you ask what you will shall be done how many lots saw that but because of their excuse of their denomination they look out and see in the bible look at their congregation of bob-tared women and they know the bible condemns it look going down the street is their own church members going down the street with shorts on and they know the word is against it but they haven't got the nerve to call out against it do you see why they don't have the nerve to call out against it it's because when they knew god they glorified him not as god and was unthankful and they bet oh god help me church and the spirit of corruption amen come in the church and they lost their guts to make a stand let me just go and take the breaks off and preach amen ain't got the guts to make a stand because they're an unthankful people but you're looking at one preacher this morning i am thankful for the message of the hour i am thankful for the voice of revelation 10 7. i am thankful for the spirit of prophecy i am thankful and as long as i've got breath in my body i'll make a stand for this message oh my they ain't got the nerve to call out against it he said give us somebody that'll crowd against it amen they made excuses what they didn't realize was their excuses actually killed the prophets now the prophet said it this way they accepted their creeds that men had given them instead of taking the word of god and by doing so they made the word of god of no effect they accepted a creed they accepted a dogma they accepted a tradition they accepted some man's idea and made the word of god of no effect now let me just go ahead and go into something else i'm thankful for lord i'm thankful that the scripture is of no private interpretation but we have been given the perfect interpretation see peter says amen knowing this verse that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of men amen but the holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost amen now if you look at that word interpretation it's a powerful word you know brother what that word interpretation means it means lucy it means to unleash something amen to interpret something means to loose it amen it means to unloose it amen see now what private interpretation does is private interpretation binds it brings a fear it brings a scare it puts a chain upon somebody and then that if you don't come to who's got the private interpretation then you don't understand it amen see private interpretation binds the church amen do you see why they hated a prophet coming on the scene because the world was full of private interpretation private interpretation on the godhead private interpretation on the baptism of the holy ghost amen but when god sent a prophet the days of private interpretation was now over amen and by the message of the hour he would stand there and in season by the message would loose the church by the perfect interpretation now do you see why i said lord i'm thankful for the perfect interpretation of the scriptures you say what are you talking about well the prophet says this way the message actually qualifies the messenger if you look at question answers he said now what if jesus would have come and said now is moses come taking you all out of egypt i've come taking you somewhere else what if he said let's go to work and build an ark i'm the lord god i'm going to float the world away now i'm going to drown the world all them why he had been out see the scripture never said he'd come like that he wouldn't have been the messiah no matter how much ark he had built or whatever he had done he had not qualified the messiah there you are it's the qualification see oh my when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect has come and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication if anybody has got a right to be happy this morning it's the bride of jesus christ we now have the perfect interpretation oh what are you thankful for this morning lord i'm thankful for the spirit of prophecy i'm thankful for the spirit of prophecy that the spirit of prophecy came upon the prophet joel and spoken said i will pour out my spirit in the last days see you'll either accept amen the fulfillment of the prophecy or you'll reject it amen and to accept it a minister come to a thanksgiving feast amen to reject it is to go into corruption to reject it is to go into bondage you say what are you talking about the prophecy when the holy spirit poured out on russia they was called to a feast of pentecost spiritual feasts and they turned it down england the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down america the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down he bit three times three times he sent out they did not listen he said oh there is still room i believe that maybe within the next few months or something or a year or whatever it is god is going to sin another shaking across the country for there is somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed let me just quit preacher for a second i do not believe that you receive a seed at the altar i do not believe amen that mama planted a seed in you when she set you on her knee but a prophet said there was a gene seed of god amen laying on the inside of you which was eternal life which always was there always was in there waiting for the quickening power of the holy ghost you say now where are you getting that it's called thinking man's filter you can go hear it for yourself amen somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere in the world and may not know something the nation itself it's gone the nation is corrupted the nation is gone but there can be a thankful people in the middle of an unthankful nation amen then what are you saying i'm saying lord i'm thankful i'm laying in the sunlight of god's word in the message invisible union the brother said then the life comes out the nomination goes in the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grow and to get bigger so it can cover over something the denomination pulls away from it why ain't we got a denomination out of this there never will be it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now has to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripe and that's exact the word to be rapping in your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about you may say what's this all got to do with thanksgiving what are you talking about brother branham here it is a quarter tonight you didn't say nothing about thanksgiving but what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were thankful for their newfound way of life being separated from the old english denominations and creed they could marry somebody say mary they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for their age for their day so can we be thankful as the pilgrims amen like abraham separate ourselves from the things of the world all of our associates abraham was a pilgrim and god has separated us amen from all the dead religions i'm speaking across this nation separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day pentecost dried up and it died like luther wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together good people there it has got to come out what did he do he opened up the seven seals of the last message you notice that the seven seals which all the mysteries of the seven church ages was sealed in those seven seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the seven seals it's open to us in the last day from a prophecy it was a prophecy but today church it's a fulfillment what was prophecy is now fulfillment what was in prophecy is now in fulfillment this morning now what are you getting that preacher well i'll tell you what i'm getting at it was that same message that a prophet took time to show you luther's message was dead wesley's message was dead pentecost dried up and died and a seed come out of the shuck ain't meant to lay are y'all with me amen to lay in the presence of the son that's the same message that he says these next words you are the sinless spotless brother i hope y'all are with me this morning you say what are you thankful about all this ain't no thanksgiving message oh yes it is lord i am thankful i am justified [Music] [Applause] what does he say he says you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every child every title where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from the sucks get out here in the weeds where you can get right before the sun i hear the combine coming you're standing complete justified like you never did it like you never did it in the first place don't you see if it wasn't for this message we would know that if it wasn't for prophets we wouldn't know that oh church help me this morning [Applause] we are justified this morning brother andrew i ain't got nothing to shout about i ain't hardly got enough money to buy a cheeseburger after church but can i give you something to shout about you are justified [Music] you're justified are y'all hearing me you are justified sitting here this morning because of this message through the lips of god's prophet introducing the power of the blood of jesus christ back in the church we've never done it we've never done it in the first place he said talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of more thankful for the revelation that i'm justified [Music] well church i'm just going to preach here for a second lord i'm thankful lord i'm thankful you made me worthy to move into this new anointed land you realize in this last day there's going to be two classes of people there's going to be a worthy people and there's going to be an unworthy people there's going to be a thankful people and there's going to be an unthankful people see there's going to be a faithful people that's going to be worthy and because they're worthy is because they were thankful and because they're thankful they're worthy are you hearing me amen there's a connection between there's a there's a connection between a thankful person and a worthy person he's thankful because he's worthy amen an unworthy person is unthankful and you know why they're unthankful it's because they're unworthy now now what are you saying i'm saying this we find there's going to be a minority and there's going to be a majority there's going to be a minority of unthankful there's going to be a minority of thankful people that's going to be the worthy people then there's going to be a majority of unthankful people that's going to be the unworthy people are you hearing me see the bible says fear not little flock for it's your father's goods we good pleasure to give you the kingdom he said this tabernacle that you're on your feet i want you to keep on pressing towards the mark of the high calling whatever you do you cling together be as cleanest as you can be but always with an arm out to reach and get someone else to bring them in but in this faith that we're now preaching and earnestly contending for don't you move one inch from it for if you believe me to be his servant this is the program of god it'll never be in the majority it'll always be in the minority always has always will then what is the minority the minority is going to be an elected few who have been predestinated have been elected have been chosen who have been called who have been justified who have been sanctified who have been holy ghosts filled can i go ahead and say what paul said who have already been glorified there's going to be a minority but that's going to be the worthy that's going to be the thankful people yes sir amen god has identified amen who is worthy of the full promise the elect seed amen of each age that presses the battle they move closer and they move closer to the fullness until jesus will say in revelation 3 4 for thou hast a few names amen with your people even in sardis which have not defied their garments which are defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy for they are worthy oh my i don't have time to get into all this but i love it this morning amen can i take another portion here with you amen for they are worthy do you realize who is saying this it's jesus the worthy one himself see amen an unworthy person cannot identify a worthy person can i preach this morning oh unworthy person they can't identify a worthy person and a worthy person can't identify an unworthy person but when a worthy who is the most worthy who is beyond worthy who is above worthy says they are worthy it was jesus christ himself you all can be mad at me you can look at me like i'm crazy you can get mad when we shout and we carry on but just leave us alone we're just thankful that the lord called us worthy we're just thankful that he looked beyond our faults and he looked beyond our failures and he looked beyond our shortcomings and he looked beyond the family we come out of and the home we was raised in and said they are worthy lord i'm thankful i'm worthy this morning hey the world don't think i'm worthy but it don't matter if the world thinks i'm worthy when he says i'm worthy i'm worthy for they are worthy the only one this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his saints you are worthy [Applause] ain't got a lot of money but i'm worthy ain't got a lot of popularity but i'm worthy ain't very famous but i'm worldly worthy ain't got a lot ain't got a lot of standing in society but i'm worthy this morning are y'all hear me he has called you worthy and when you hear him say you are worthy it don't matter anymore what anybody else says they can say you're lost they can say your serpent seed they can say you're a blasphemer they can say you're a hypocrite they can say you're an unbeliever they can say you're a make-believer they can say what they want but it does not matter because the worthy one has already spoken and said they are worthy he said it church he said you are worthy are y'all hear me are y'all hearing who i'm talking about i'm talking about the god that sits high and looks slow [Applause] you realize your pastor may not see you on your worst days are you hearing me your mama mate or daddy may not see you on your worst days your pastor may not see the things that's been done in secret and the battles you've had and the struggles you've had he may not see that amen but you know what jesus sees it all and he still calls you worthy he sees the struggles he sees the lonely nights he sees the setting sins he sees the strongholds he sees the battle that you're in he sees the things that you're going through but he still says you are worthy lord i'm thankful [Applause] there is this only one the only qualified judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says [Music] the judge above all judges the king of all kings the most righteous judge of all judges the judge who's never lost the case the judge who has never been defeated the judge who has never had to back up for one thing he said the judge who has never lost the case the judge who has never made a bad ruling still looks at you and says they are [Applause] worthy my bible says amen that you're worthy amen that how many can say lord i'm thankful i'm worthy remember a few minutes ago when we talked about justified why do we talk about justified to get to this point right here who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect to the charge of god's worthy to the charge of god's gene seed it is god it is the judge that justifier [Applause] oh my what are you saying andrew i'm saying you're worthy i'm saying the bride has been accounted worthy then we see the separation in the foolish virgin and the bride are you with me you say what are you talking about well i'll say it this way the foolish virgin is working she's working she's washing her garments she's trying to get her garments clean she's trying to get right she's trying to get there she trying real hard brother brother she's working she's a worker she's working real hard amen but my bible says the bride which is the word he says unto her was granted [Music] y'all get that tomorrow about 12 o'clock and you'll scare everybody to death around you when you start shouting about that the foolish virgin is working trying to get her garments clean trying to get her garments white trying to get her garments pure trying to get her garments underfound but the bible says but to her the bride was granted that she should be arrayed and find clean and lean and wide clean and wide and for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints see what that word granted means to give one to someone to whom he already belonged [Music] you already belonged to god you already belong to the judge he already before he was ever even born he already said you're worthy prophet said what is it sin he said sin is unbelief oh but thank your garments are washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bleed for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the field of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stained on god and on his word hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding ban of grace unmerited of your own god did it himself come on church lord i'm thankful thank you what are you thankful for by the andrew i'm thankful that before i was born he slipped a wedding band he slipped the wedding band of unmerited favor of pre-predestinated grace upon my finger before i was ever born are y'all with me this morning amen what are you talking about i'm talking about this you take a young girl and you let her find her a boy and you let that boy and her get to know each other and get to talking and before long they find out they're they fall in love with each other and he gets down on one knee and proposes to her and he takes a he takes a wedding band or a engagement ring rather and he takes that engagement ring and he places on her finger you know what she might have come to church for years and all she'd do is raise that right hand a little bit she'd just wave a little bit like that or she'd shake hands with the right hand you know i mean you hardly saw that left hand amen but you let her get a wedding band on it you let her get an engagement ring over oh she'll come in and start waving that hand from the time she gets in amen she now shakes with the left hand she waves with the left hand she wants everybody to see that left hand why because there's something on that left hand that has separated her from every other girl in the church has separated her from that brother girl in the world and there is a man that has claimed her and is called her worthy to be his bride oh come on this morning church you've got the wedding band on your finger jesus christ he called you worthy he claimed you he anointed you don't mind showing it off i've got it this morning i'm not ashamed i'm the bride of jesus christ i've been married to this new anointed word my first husband is

the bride of jesus christ praise the lord are you ashamed of it [Music] i'm proud of it because my prophet said three stars lined up over the earth to announce the infant christ was on the earth somewhere that's right three stars lined up to announce somewhere on the earth is laying the infant bridegroom somewhere on the earth is laying the bridegroom and three stars lined up and three majors they they they saw those three stars and they followed that star they followed that star until that star led him now everybody said what happened he said what's done in the heavens is done on the earth he said three stars lined up and then three magis on the earth lined up under those stars and they followed that bright star until it went all the way over amen to to where the baby was laying now isn't it something amen that they follow that star oh i'm a hurry here i'm about done i don't want to preach too long but i pray this is okay he said they followed that star all over the valleys they went down to the mountains they went up on top he said whenever the star stopped they stopped he said but when the star stopped there for good he said they knew it was there because there was let me say it this way in other words they were not wondering where he was they knew if the star was there then somewhere was going to be the manifestation of what the star was pointing to right you realize what they done those three magis they began to go to door to door they went to door they knocked on the door they said where is he that is born king of the jews brother brother juan isn't it something they never one time went to the door and said is he here brother they never one time went and said is he that is born king of the jews has he been born is he here can you tell me where he's at is is this really real should we really believe this is there really something no every door they went to they said one thing where is he that is born king of the jews where is he do you realize they went to king's houses who was kings and you know what they done they trumped those kings they looked at those kings and said you know what we know you're a king but we got a question for you we're speaking we know you're a king but we're a speaking brother you know what if one of them would looked at him and said you know what what makes you think there's a king here there's no king here one of them made times would square back his shoulders and say if there wasn't a king down here there would be a star up there if there was a star up there that means there's a king down here and they kept on and they kept on until they found the king they said here he is and they brought gifts oh come on church you know what happened when they found the king it was not a time for crime it was not a time for mourning it was not a time for sadness it was not a sorrowful time it was shouting time it was rejoice in time it was thanksgiving time it was praise time we have found what we were looking for we have found it what are you saying preacher i'm saying this three stars that's right lined up to announce somewhere on the earth is an infant bridegroom 1962 prophet said you probably saw it you probably saw the ruler in the paper he said just to today five planets [Applause] where is she where is she where is she the word made flesh in this hour where is that worthy bride where is she is she in jeffersonville is she out in tucson is she out somewhere she is here where is she she's here this morning she's not coming she is here oh she is him [Applause] what are you talking about a few days ago men i say a few days ago back back august of 2017 i my wife and i got married and my wife bless her heart she worked hard on that wedding she she put a lot of time and effort into making that her dream beautiful wedding right now now brothers come on you know as well as i know it's like just tell us what the word what time to be there and we'll be there right yeah hey but but but she put all this effort into and i'll tell you what she had some ideas that really i'd never thought of anybody else really thought it but she thought of so one of the things was this brother one so so when it began we come out and i would stand there and uh the brothers would stand there and and the the the groomsmen was all there and we was all standing there and the bride's mage was up there the the bride was waiting on the bride they was i was waiting on the bride where's the bride you know and you ever been to a wedding you know about that time it gets real quiet and then all of a sudden there's a hush comes over the building and somebody sits up on the piano and all of a sudden you hear this you hear that you know what that is that is the announcement that is the introduction amen and it gets your attention and you stand up and you turn back because that is the announcement the bride is coming [Applause] [Music] that's the announcement the bride is coming you know what they meant we was all standing there and all of a sudden my wife she planned this herself all of a sudden we're all standing there it's real quiet and there's no traditional bomb bomb but about that time brother the door busted open back there and little boy brother levi this little buddy of mine he come running down the aisle he had a sign in his hand just little boy he come running down the aisle screaming the bride is coming the bride is coming the bride is coming the bride is coming the bride is coming the bride is coming the bride is coming [Applause] brother one it was hilarious to look across the congregation people were jumping they were looking around there was an audible gasp oh and then people began to think oh no some kids got out of control and he's run the wedding what's going on you know what they were looking for the traditional bomb bomb but something different come that was against tradition are y'all hearing me this morning and the reason why the world is unthankful this morning it's because they was looking for a traditional announcement that a bride was coming but there was a man stood up and said good evening friends good evening friends the bride he is here oh mercy let us be glad and rejoice let us enter his courts with thanksgiving let us open up our heart let us worship him let us lift up holy hands let us praise god [Applause] lord i'm thankful thank you lord i'm faithful i'm thankful for the blood i'm thankful that we now have the mind of christ amen praise the lord thank you let this man be in you which was also yes in christ jesus if i was shakespeare i'd do the works of shakespeare amen i was a poet whatever but if i'm dead to myself and shakespeare lives in me then the works of shakespeare i'll do i will do and if the life of jesus christ lives in the person amen they become identified with him yes it's christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the holy ghost is a token upon you that your life says amen amen to every scripture that's right what are you saying andrew i'm saying you can't be a secret boy about this token you can't be secret that somebody let me let me rephrase that the body the person called you worthy can't be ashamed of it you're worthy probably gonna sit this way he says talk about a thanksgiving day i tell you not a tradition not at all we got too many traditions now what we need today is a refreshing a baptism of the holy spirit back in the church not a celebration but a feeling then that ought to be our thanksgiving day celebration as we would call it it ought to be the holy spirit coming into our lives if we could eat a turkey like our forefathers eat we ought to receive the holy ghost like the forefathers had amen not a tradition but a commandment from god we should receive it lord i'm thankful i'm thankful lord i'm thankful that i have recognized my day of visitation and accepted it with thanksgiving and praise unto the lord who is sinned lord i am thankful for supernatural vindication of the message and the messenger that i'm believing and following oh god lord i am thankful for a simple message that is so simple that the pharaohs of this day have rejected it looking for something great church david says it this way the lord preserveth the simple i was brought low and he helped me simple means simple foolish open-minded open-minded to believe the word of god is the truth what are you doing brother andrew i'm just giving you things to be thankful for lord i'm thankful that we can have a personal relationship with christ our king and he can so change our nature that the sinful desires no longer control the thirst on the control tower of our soul lord i'm thankful for an example for jesus himself said i've given you an example that you should do as i've done to you example means a pattern a copy an example for imitation of the thing to be imitated or of a thing to be shunned can i can i leave you all with this this morning jesus left us more than an example in foot washing and communion the prophet said now look let's watch jesus not just for a minute he was your example i hope you're not getting too tired look let's look at it jesus just a minute he was our example he said so for i've given you an example that you should do as others as i've done unto you now watch when he came into the world when there was more as much unbelief in the world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same and healing just the same never bothered him there were critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir what was his goal always do that which the father has written always do what pleases him lord i'm thankful i'm thankful for an example aren't you this morning you love him today can i give you one more lord i'm thankful for the anchor of the new birth in the soul hebrews 6 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil you realize what anchors are used for they're used in troubled waters in troubled times anchor is in the book oh god anchors in the book of acts when the ships are going through storms anchors and paul but the prophet said this way we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous waters lord i'm thankful can i ask you a question how many sick of this whole world are you sick of it are you tired of all the confusion [Music] are you tired of all the arguing and all the fuss all the hatred and all the belittling and tearing down and killing are you tired of all that you know what's in that condition you know why i'm thankful open up the door to corruption now they're sitting in the corruption they welcomed in but as i close this morning i say this lord i am thankful that the same pillar of fire that led moses and israel out of egypt into the promised land was the same pillar of fire that led paul amen from law in the grace was the same pillar of fire that appeared on the ohio river and said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming of christ is the same pillar of fire that appeared in houston coliseum and had his picture taken above william branham's head is the same pillar of fire that whirled through those meetings for years and years is the same pillar of fire that is here in this building this morning what's it here to do church it's here to lead us from the confusion of this world into the new city as musicians come today lord i'm thankful i love what the prophet says look at it today friends you talk about a thankful people we ought to be the most thankful people of everybody in the world we us besides the healing besides these things has taken place what is it it's the absolute assurance that the same god by the same nature the same pillar of fire the same angel of god the same jesus yesterday today and forever is doing the same things by the same power through the same name what an anchor of the soul steadfast and sure [Music] he says may the lord god of heaven rich you bless every one of you lord i'm thankful [Music] when a man is born again there's a little spot like size of his fingernail the rim says that god injects into him system and it falls into his heart and their anchors then then satan makes you prove it and if it ain't there you're gone you know how many will agree that we need an anchor during these times i think of how the prophet of god preached so many things time and time and time and time again but he says at this speaking about when he went through his trial of losing his wife and baby he said there laid the baby before the hospital the isolated ward flies all over her little eyes like that i took the old mosquito bar and shoot them away and put it over here i got down i said god there lays my daddy and my brother yonder the flower is on their grave there lays hope laying yonder and here is my baby dying don't take her lord he just pulled down the curtain as if say shut up i don't want to hear you at all he wouldn't even talk to me then if he wouldn't talk to me it was satan's time he said and i thought you said he was a good god what's all this you're hollering about you're just a boy look around over the city every girl every boy you ever associated with think you've lost your mind you have now he couldn't tell me there's no god because i'd already seen it but he told me he didn't care for me continue to talk to him and i said that's right i begin to think well what see everything began to break away when it come to reasonings but when it come to that that hung it stayed there i was just about ready to say then i'll quit but when it got down to all the reasoning powers that broke away then it come to that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't been there what if it hadn't had we wouldn't have known one another the way we do now the church would have not been here like this the thousands and millions around the world but thank god it was there then i thought what are you talking about andrew i'm thinking lord i'm thankful for an anchor then i thought what who am i anyhow who am i to question his majesty who am i to question the creator that give my very life give his very life here on earth where did i get that baby who gave it to me not mine anyhow he just loaned during me for a while and i said satan get away from me i went over and laid my hand on the baby i said god bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down to put you on mommy's arms and the angels will pack your little soul away and i'll meet you in that morning i said lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet i love you and i believe you and if you send me to hell i'll love you anyhow i can't get away from that there you are just an intellectual it all broke away but you've got to have a personal relationship you've got to be born again brother andrew why did you read that to say this lord i am thankful for a personal relationship with you that'll keep me i want you to lift your hands and say lord thank you lord thank you for keeping me lord i am thankful this morning that all things i've been through you have kept

[Music] glory to me [Music] alright praise the lord praise the lord amen amen amen amen amen the lord bless you may have your seat we will worship you at a little bit as we express our our gratefulness to the lord but we we want to thank the lord we can say lord i'm thankful amen i hope that is not just a salmon i hope that would be our language amen the lord i'm thankful praise the lord amen you know uh when brother brandon preached invisible union message he actually said that was his thanksgiving message he preached there a lot of messages he preached around thanksgiving but invisible union message was a thanksgiving message and one of the things that is that is uh that is that is uh a blessing in that message is because there was after the opening of the seals amen and after the seals has been opened the mysteries has been revealed all we have to do is to be thankful praise the lord you know the the the the denominationer which wishes that that jezebel spirit that has that has control denominationalism in every revival the the failure of every revival was where the people got to the place and they thought they could do something they could do something to make the revival to sustain the revival praise the lord instead of being thankful for what god has given them praise the lord we always trying to think is because we have prayed a lot are we faithful in church or we are paying our tithes that's the reason why god is blessing us no that's not god has already made a provision and all we have to do is to be thankful for what he has given us praise the lord amen the reason why we do these things is an expression of our gratitude we are not doing it to gain god's favor praise the lord you're not in church every church service to gain god favor but if you appreciate what he has done for you you will not wait for those doors to be open praise the lord some people think that you have to get on the on the mountain or go in the desert like moses you know you gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta do penis before god that was one of the things that the catholic church introduced to the church that you gotta do pennies you gotta reassure to god that you are sorry for your sin so you got to crawl on your knees you got to bleed in your hands there is only one blood that god will take for the sin of man that's the blood of jesus christ now your blood now your sweat god will not take your sweat but what he wants you to do is to be thankful for what he has done for you we live a life of appreciation it's not alive to gain god's favor there is nothing you can do for him to not love you there is nothing you did for him to love you praise the lord amen if god has set his love upon you he's not going to draw back he's not going to take it back because he's depending on his own ability and not your ability praise the lord verbatim in a invisible union he said this he was talking about the revival it's very important he said this he said oh my lord i'm thankful amen he talks and he says the word i fell on the day of pentecost will now work this day he says so that was for pentecost this is for the bride going home or the bride so so we got something different and what we got different is that we can be thankful is that we can be thankful jesus says when you pray say father who are in heaven hallowed be your name i'm thankful i praise you i worship you praise the lord you start your prayers with praise and worship and you end your prayers with praise and worship you start your day we praise and worship and you end your day with praise and worship that's what this seventh season has come for this this seventh seal message is to take from in your hands that there is nothing you have to do you have to appreciate what god has given you you have to appreciate what the message has given you the message has put neckties on your neck gave you decent dress or as you have been just like the ones in the street with our clothes on walking naked is this message that have dressed you it is not what you have done is that because you have been in the messy i read the message and no you know what one thing this message also did for us is there amen under the roman system under that jezebel's uh religion it lift up the priests they lift up the bishop and it corrupt the people they condem it kept the people out of condemnation all the time amen in this message we're not lifting up william branham amen praise the lord god waved that ministry before us because he has called you all he's lifting the people up is not to live for one man and condemn the people no it's to say god used one man and brought that man to that place and he can bring you to that same place as a child of god as a daughter and son of god [Music] that's what we are thankful for that's our thanksgiving it's that what you can do is appreciating what god has done for you if you don't appreciate it there is nothing you would do to ever get yourself to where you think you want to get yourself you have to appreciate everything what god has given you the people he has put in your life amen just like brother andrew said god line up three stars to identify that the bridegroom was on earth he landed a five planet a vindication of the fightful ministry to identify this bride that's the work of the fightful ministry to tell you that he has made you walking not to make you to work work yourself out but to tell you appreciate what god has given to you if god has given you a family appreciated if god has given you a husband appreciate it if he have given you a father that would that would that would discipline you by the word of god appreciate it if he gives you an assembly appreciate it is having a heart of thankfulness just having a heart of thankfulness can heal you from sicknesses just being thankful to know that the lord is my healer i'm thankful that he's my healer no matter what pain i feed in my body but i'm thankful that he's my healer we always want to tell people what we have done and what we are doing and what we can do instead of telling people what he has done what he is doing and what he can do it's all about he and not about you that's the thanksgiving message we got to be thankful for the message thankful for the messenger oh praise the lord amen i just believe this was a wonderful wonderful lord i'm thankful praise the lord oh true yes yes [Music] lord we worship you so yes you know what if you grow up in the system in the family where you would never praise well you were never appreciated when you were never taught to give praise back be able to say thank you to say i appreciate you and you have not grown under there [Music] because it was it was at a time where you did something before you were ever appreciated so it almost looked like we want to work our way in we want we want to impress god that we are doing something no we have to be thankful amen we have to be thankful because it's what he's doing it's not what you are doing praise the lord it's not because you pray that god answered your prayer no there are millions in the word people out there they don't pray and say god provide my daily bread but because he's the father of creation he makes sure he provides for him [Music] our prayer to god is an appreciation the bible say even before you ask him you already know but brother branham said we have to come as children and appreciate him and appreciate him now lord you know my needs lord you know my struggle lord thank you for providing a message thank you for giving the holy ghost that can deal with me that can bring my heart on a conviction not crying to god and knocking your head against the wall oh god deliver me no thank god for the power of deliverance because if there is not a power of deliverance there is nowhere [Music] there is no way you will be delivered dry yourself you would just die a drowned person thank yourself judas hang himself and he died as a source of betrayal it did not change him the act of being thankful the act of being thankful having a grateful heart that is the best treasure you can ever have in this world because it makes you to be content lord i'm thankful you make me who i am and you give me what i have it makes you you are not jealous about somebody you are not envying somebody you don't walk around the street hanging your heads down oh see this person driving bmw lord when will my with my life reach there that's those are all the things that the character gospel is walking the people through but having a thankful heart having a grateful heart that you have a father and he is your father he knows your name he knows your needs he knows where you are [Music] let's think through our feet let's give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah thank you jesus thank you father thank you lord amen we are grateful father thank you lord thank you for everything that you have [Music] done my amen [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] [Music] i thank is [Music] [Music] glory glory [Music] is [Music] oh yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] praise the lord and just like
