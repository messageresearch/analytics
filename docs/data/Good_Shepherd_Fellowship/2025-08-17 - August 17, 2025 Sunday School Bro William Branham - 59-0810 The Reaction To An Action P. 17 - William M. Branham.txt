TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I said, "Since I got saved 30 years ago as a boy, ever since then, it seems like I'm in a nightmare." She said, "What do you mean?" I've said in this life something happened down in me that makes me know that there's a land somewhere and I'm shaking myself to wake up. &gt;&gt; Someday death will wake me into his presence. &gt;&gt; Did you ever have a nightmare and just wanted to get out of it and you were jerking and jumping? You want to wake up because you know there's a reality somewhere that's far beyond that nightmare. So is it the ever Christian born again? Always has been. Abraham and Isaac and them said they were pilgrims and strangers. They were seeking a city to come. &gt;&gt; That's who he was. We were going to the grocery a few weeks ago and we noticed a woman with a dress on. It was the most uncommon thing we'd seen in a long time. So we mey said to me, she said, "Bill, what is the matter?" I said, "Honey, here's what it is. We don't want to get accustomed to the world." She said, "Well, some people has said, and I've got letters, you're going to ruin your ministry by making such remarks as you do." I said, "If preaching the truth ruins a ministry that it ought to be ruined, right?" &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, what makes Christians feel different?" I said, "When I was in Sweden or in Finland, the women in the bath house give the man the bath." They were nurses. They said that's their customs. When I was in Paris, all the restrooms is both men and women together. That's a custom of Paris. They think nothing of it. I made a mention to Dr. money and over in when we were staying at the YMCA and they wanted me to go down and take one of those sundras which I thought was fine but not with the women there and so he said but brother Brandham said those are wash women I said but it's not right he said what about your doctors examining your women over in America then see so there you are see it's just six of one and half a dozen of the other but It's the nation that you belong to in the customs. When a man or woman is born again of the spirit of God, they are born from a place that's holy and this is not their home. &gt;&gt; And they are seeking a city to come whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; Your spirit comes from above. She said, "Then we're not Americans." I said, "We are as long as we're in the flesh." But when we are born again, we're of heaven &gt;&gt; and of God, and we're citizens of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit that dwells there that comes into you will make you act and look and think as it does in that nation where we're going to. &gt;&gt; Sure. Idolatry taken over all the preachers under the great heavy load. the prophets had give away because the people demanded it. The people demanded it and the the ministry gave away to it. That's the way it is today. Many good preachers bend under the load because the congregation calls for it. They'll walk right out of his church. Many times the great denominations if they caught one of their ministers preaching against such smoking and so forth like that that excommunicate them. And the ministers has to bend under that load. But there was one in that day didn't bend under the load. They hated him. But he's setting up on a mountain. God told him to go up there. He'd feed him with the crows and Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give him water to drink. &gt;&gt; But he wouldn't bow down to their modern trend. He still believed God was the same holy God &gt;&gt; that made heavens and earth. I'm so glad that he's got still got some today that believes the same thing. No matter what the world says, they still won't bow to the modern trend on modern religion. &gt;&gt; No social gospel for them, man. They believe God's still holy. &gt;&gt; They believe he requires holiness and he requires a new birth. He requires a separation from sin. Oh, I know she hated him, but God loved him. And God was fixing to take his prophet off the mountain to bring him down into the valley. And she must have been a good woman or God would have never chosen her to entertain his prophet though she was a widow and she must have been young. She had a young son and she was a righteous person or God would have never chose her. But as she began to come down after years, her husband being dead, the barrel began to get low in meal. And of course, as a mother would, she would lounce herself so she could feed her little boy. Finally, she began to see that his clothes was getting threadbear. Her own elbows was perhaps through the sleeves. Night after night, she could give him maybe one little corn cake and put him in the bed. And perhaps night after night he'd wake up and say, "Mama, I'm hungry. Can't you fix me just a little to eat?" And maybe the next day she would do without her own cake and give it to him. Death stalking at the door. No more meal after that was gone. No more oil to mix it with. And closer and closer, death came as the barrel went down. Finally, maybe they got two cakes a week. Then it got down to just one more cake. Isn't it strange how God does things? He'll let us get right down to the last the last mile of the way. You know, he he likes to do that. He did it with the Hebrew children. He knew who he could trust. So he let that them boys walk right up to the fiery furnace so they could almost smell the fire. And he never moved. But when it comes time, he'll move. &gt;&gt; He'll move, but he waits till his own time. He wanted to see what kind of a reaction they'd have. He knew they had made their stand. And when he knows that you make your stand, he'll let Satan take you to the last mile of the way. &gt;&gt; But just remember, he's still there. &gt;&gt; He wants to see if you really mean what you're talking about. Oh, I believe God's a healer. Yes, I sure believe it. And the next day, you still got your pain healed. Well, maybe I never got it. Sure you got it. You just want to see how you're going to react on what you said. You say, "Oh, praise God. I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit." The first little temptation comes along, you fly off like a buzz off. He's trying to see your reaction on your action. He's trying to test you. Every son that cometh to God must first be chasened, tested. Every child that comes to him, he puts him through a test to see how he'll act. Anyone, a chemist, anyone else will always test something. Great pipes. I used to work for a gas company and they test those pipes by putting a plug in the end and a valve and I don't remember now just how many hundred pounds of pressure they put on them pipes to see if there was a little sand hole that would blow. And if the it could not stand the test then it was thrown into the scrap heap. And when you're put under a test, when you're fixing to be used for God, for a testimony, like the lady you're in the wheelchair, the man, the little boy, some of you people out there, maybe you're Christians and wonder why you're put under this test. God's fixing to use your testimony, &gt;&gt; but he wants to see how you react. &gt;&gt; So, he puts a pressure on If you blow up, well then he can't do nothing with you. But if you hold on, stand the test. This little woman, I can imagine seeing her that last night when she know there's just enough in that barrel, a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil for one little cake for she and her son. And then she is to die and he was to die. There's no more available anywhere. And I can imagine all night long as she walked over and patted his little bare skinny hands and she looked at his little ragged night shirt and she'd hear him in his sleep turn over and say, "Mama, I'm hungry. But there was nothing to give him. Isn't it strange when we have done all that we know how to do and after she had prayed and and seen the end come like some of you cancer cases here. You sinned right at the end and you wonder why she'd examine herself. Lord, is there anything that I've left undone? God test like Job. They accused him that he was a secret sinner and Job was righteous. There was no man on earth like him. And yet God let the devil take everything he had. And when they accused him of being a secret sinner, he knew that he was righteous before God. He knew he had done no sin. But God lets those things happen to see what you'll do. You see, he and Satan had a a proposition. Satan said, "I'll make him curse you to your face." God said, "You can't do it." &gt;&gt; And the test had to come. &gt;&gt; And your test comes. my test comes and we all go through those testings. The Bible said if we cannot stand that it proves that we're illegitimate children. Our testimony was not right. We're not real children of God but we become illegitimate. We're not the children of God. We just claim to be. When they laugh at you when you receive the Holy Ghost and you go back in the world with them, that shows you never got it. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're testifying of your healing, knowing that God's done something for you and your neighbors say you're crazy, you're no better at all. You say, "Well, maybe I'm not." It shows you wasn't worthy of your healing to begin with. &gt;&gt; You stand on your testimony. &gt;&gt; Don't you give away. You stand right there. Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth until last days he'll stand on the earth. Though the skinworms destroys this body, yet in my flesh I'll see God." &gt;&gt; Lightning's flashed. The thunders roared. It's held out to the end. This little woman had done all she know to do. And yet God kept silent. But when real faith has caught the vision, it can keep silent and rest calmly because it knows it's going to happen. Don't forget that faith will rest with perfect assurance. No matter what the storms are saying, how contrary it looks, faith rests with assurance. Faith can take its stand up on a rock. Look into a grave or into the waters where a lovely little chunk of your own loving heart has been buried. And faith can look across the sea to him that said, "I am the resurrection and life." &gt;&gt; Faith rest asssurance. We speak of faith. We talk of faith. But I wonder sometime if we know what we're talking about. I wonder if it isn't hope instead of faith. Faith doesn't move. No matter how contrary it looks, faith stays right there. It never moves. When Moses was put into the the bull rush in a little slimy ark, pushed out into the sea where the crocodiles were fat with children. The mother Jezebel with the faith resting assure that she was putting the proper child of God on the water. She pushed him right into the jaws of death knowing that God could raise him back. &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes me feel religious. &gt;&gt; She knew God would take care of him. &gt;&gt; Though he didn't even have a name, God could give him a name. She pushed the sweetest little baby was ever in the world nearly out into the jaws of death knowing that she was following the instructions of Almighty God. And faith could rest assure that God would do something about it for she know he was born a deliverer. And if you're sure that you're born of the spirit of God, that you have the Holy Ghost, and the promises of God is yours, I don't care what the devil does, you can still rest assure. Faith takes its unmovable stand. Faith cannot rest upon the shifting sands of man's theology, but it takes its solemn stand on the rock of ages, which is unmovable. There it rest with assurance. No matter what comes or goes, my faith holds. how sick I get, how contrary it looks, and how this is. My faith is anchored within the veil, and nothing can move me. Now, you can't bluff it. You've got to have it. You can't bluff it. Satan knows when you're bluffing, and he also knows when you've got it. Your heart condemns you not, and you're a Christian, you have a right to every promise that God made in his book. It's yours. No matter what the consequences is and what the outcome, you don't look at that. You look at the faith that God give you to the promise &gt;&gt; and it stands there. Nothing will move it. How she must have felt. I've met every requirement Jehovah gave. I've met everything that God told me to do. And the barrels down to one little handful of meal. And the cruise has just a spoonful or two of oil enough to mix it. But God was setting an angel's on every bed post folks watching to see how she's going to react. If you're sure that it's God and you met every requirement that God required you to do, you've met every scripture that you know, you love him, you've been baptized, you've been filled with the spirit, and you've got the insurance in your heart that God will do it, then just hang on. God will bring you through. He'll never fail. Hold to it. how it looked at a Christian woman and there maybe Ahab in his palace and Jezebel with plenty to eat. We wonder why the wicked prosper. David asked that once but the word came back. Watch him at the end. &gt;&gt; Prosperity isn't a sign of God being with him. That's so our nation is blessed. The people are all Christians and so was it in that day. Prosperity then was by subversing. This poor little woman as she looked at that little baby all night long she couldn't sleep. First place she was so hungry she couldn't sleep. And she knew that one handful of meal stood between her and death. What would she do? She couldn't stand it any longer. She's frail. She's walking reeling as she walked. the little fella crying for a mouthful of bread. And yet she was a Christian, a believer. And Jehovah, as we'd call Christian today, loyal, proved that God selected her above all the other women. He selected her. Yet she had done all that could be done. Along towards daylight, the birds wouldn't even hollow. They were all starved, gone. Day begin to break across the room. I can see her sitting in an old rocking chair, ringing her hands, the tears running down her cheeks as she looked. The little boy had spent a resting night. Mama, can't you just find one little piece of bread? Papa was a good man. God taken him. What's the matter, mama? But the woman stood. She knew she had met the requirements of God. She had one little handful of meal. She went in and tucked this little handful of meal out into the the pan and poured the oil into it. Begin to mix it up. Now, the meal was Christ. Christ is the meal offering. Any of you clergymen know that? Amen. &gt;&gt; When the meal was ground for the for the meal offering, it had to be ground with a certain burr that every little burr had to grind the meal just exactly the same. Why? Because Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; What he was then, he is tonight. &gt;&gt; What he is tonight, he'll always be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now the oral represents the spirit and the we know that by the scriptures that's the reason we anoint by oral. When Elijah one time at the school of the prophets had come up there and just sent some of them man out from the school and they didn't know the difference between wild gourds and peas. some prophets. But he picked the lap full of wild gourds and throwed them into the pot. And one of them screamed out, "There's death in the pot." And Elijah said, "Don't get excited." He went and got a handful of meal and throwed it into the pot and said, "Eat." &gt;&gt; Why? When Christ is putting death, life comes instead of death. Don't care how far you've gone, how low you're s, how immoral you are, how degraded you are, how sinful you are. When Christ comes into the heart, death fades away and life comes into the same place. &gt;&gt; From death in the pot coming life in the pot. If the cancers eat you up, if two berkeland your doctor has turned you down, nothing else can be done. Let a handful of Christ come into you &gt;&gt; that Jesus the same yesterday. Not a handful of religion now. A handful of Christ, the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; come into your heart with genuine faith and death will flee out and life will take its place. The meal offering and the oral is the spirit. Now what is that? Christ is the word. In the beginning was the word. The word is with God. The word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the spirit. Jesus told the woman at the well said the time is coming when God seeks people that will worship him in spirit and in truth. That's the word with the spirit. Some people has the word, others has the spirit. But when you get spirit and truth together, something's got to happen. &gt;&gt; And it was just a little bit just a little bit, but it was all she needed. &gt;&gt; God let this saint deep in the people's heart. You may be down to your last handful. I've heard people say, "I don't have very much faith, Brother Brandham." But what you got, if it's real faith, mix it with God's word. &gt;&gt; Look what it'll do. You say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I've been to every doctor, been the clinic. Oh, I've joined church for my sins and I've done this. I can't help what all you've done. What little faith you got enough faith to be out here tonight. Then mix it with the word. Get ready. She stirred it up together. That's the only thing between her and death. That may be the only thing left for you tonight, between you and death. Is what little spirit that you can muster up in your heart to believe it. Mix it with God's eternal word. When she did, I can see her pull the little ragged curtain back and look in the little boy's holding his little stomach. Mother, mother, are you ready to cook the little cake? She'd say, "Yes, dear. Just wait a few minutes. Mother's mixing it up. Mother, break it in two and you take half of it." Oh, honey, we'll take care of that. She had the what was it now? The word and the spirit mixed together. And she went out into the yard to get, did you know this? The scripture says, two sticks. What is the two sticks? The cross. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
