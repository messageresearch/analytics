[6:38] but the predestinated will hear and be
[6:40] ready for the rapture
[6:41] the royal seed of abraham with like
[6:43] faith as abrahams will hold to the word
[6:45] with him for they are predestinated
[6:48] together
[6:50] the last day messenger will appear in
[6:52] god's appointed time
[6:54] it is the end time now as all know for
[6:56] israel is in the homeland
[6:58] any time now he will come according to
[7:00] malachi
[7:01] when we see him he will be dedicated to
[7:03] the word
[7:04] he will be indicated pointed out in the
[7:07] word revelations 10 7
[7:09] and god will vindicate his ministry
[7:12] he will preach the truth as did elijah
[7:14] and be ready for the mount zion showdown
[7:17] many will misunderstand him because they
[7:19] have been taught scripture in a certain
[7:21] way which they consider truth
[7:23] when he comes against that they will not
[7:25] believe
[7:26] even some true ministers will
[7:28] misunderstand the messenger because so
[7:29] much has been called god's truth by
[7:31] deceivers
[7:33] but this prophet will come and as the
[7:36] forerunner to the first coming cried
[7:38] behold the lamb of god that taketh away
[7:40] the sin of the world
[7:42] even so will he no doubt cry out
[7:44] behold the lamb of god coming in glory
[7:47] he will do this for even as john was the
[7:49] messenger of truth to the elect so is
[7:52] this one the last messenger to the elect
[7:54] and word born bride
[7:58] christ eulogizes the church
[8:01] revelation 2 13
[8:04] i know thy works and where thou dwellest
[8:07] even where satan's seat is and thou
[8:09] holdest fast my name and has not denied
[8:12] my faith even in those days wherein
[8:14] antipas was my faithful martyr who was
[8:16] slain among you where satan dwelleth
[8:20] i know thy works
[8:22] these are the identical words uttered to
[8:24] each of the seven messengers relative to
[8:26] the people of god in each age
[8:29] as they are spoken to the two vines true
[8:31] and false
[8:32] they will bring joy and gladness to the
[8:34] hearts of one group but they ought to
[8:36] strike terror in the hearts of the other
[8:38] for though we are saved by grace apart
[8:40] from works true salvation will bring
[8:43] forth works or deeds that will please
[8:45] god
[8:46] first john 3 7
[8:49] little children let no man deceive you
[8:51] he that doeth worketh righteousness is
[8:54] righteous even as he is righteous
[8:58] if this verse means anything at all it
[9:00] means that what a man does he is
[9:02] james three eleven
[9:05] dot the fountain sent forth at the same
[9:07] place sweet water and bitter
[9:09] romans 6 2
[9:12] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[9:14] any longer therein
[9:16] matthew 12 33-35
[9:19] either make the tree good and his fruit
[9:21] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[9:23] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[9:26] by his fruit
[9:27] o generation of vipers how can ye being
[9:30] evil speak good things for out of the
[9:32] abundance of the heart the mouth
[9:34] speaketh a good man out of the good
[9:36] treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[9:38] good things and an evil man out of the
[9:40] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[9:43] now if a man is born of the word
[9:46] being born again not of corruptable seed
[9:48] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[9:50] which liveth and abideth forever
[9:52] first peter 1 23
[9:55] he will produce the word
[9:58] the fruit or works of his life will be a
[10:00] product of the kind of seed of life that
[10:01] is in him
[10:03] his works therefore will be scriptural
[10:05] oh what an indictment this truth is
[10:07] going to be against the pergamian age
[10:10] there stands that matchless one and in
[10:12] his hand the sharp sword with the two
[10:14] edges the word of god
[10:17] and that word will judge us in the last
[10:19] day
[10:20] in fact the word is judging even now
[10:22] for it is the discerner of the thoughts
[10:24] and intents of the heart
[10:26] it cuts asunder the carnal from the
[10:27] spiritual it makes us living epistles
[10:30] read and known of all men to the glory
[10:32] of god
[10:34] i know thy works
[10:36] if a man fears that he might not please
[10:38] god then let him fulfill the word
[10:41] if a man wonders if he will hear those
[10:43] words
[10:43] well done good and faithful servant
[10:46] let him fulfill the word of god in his
[10:48] life and assuredly he will hear those
[10:50] words of praise
[10:52] the word of truth was the criterium then
[10:55] it is the criterion now
[10:57] there isn't another standard there isn't
[10:59] another plum line
[11:01] as the world is going to be judged by
[11:03] one christ jesus even so it is going to
[11:05] be judged by the word
[11:07] if a man wants to know how he is making
[11:09] out let him do as james suggested
[11:12] look into the mirror of god's word
[11:15] i know thy works
[11:17] as he stood there with the word
[11:19] examining their lives and the light of
[11:21] the blueprint he had laid out for them
[11:23] he must have been pleased in a goodly
[11:24] measure
[11:25] for they like the others who had gone on
[11:27] before
[11:28] were enduring the persecution of the
[11:30] unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto
[11:32] the lord
[11:34] difficult though it was at times to
[11:36] serve the lord yet they served him and
[11:38] worshiped him in spirit and in truth
[11:40] but with the false vine it was not so
[11:43] alas they had repudiated the life that
[11:45] is built upon the word and were now
[11:47] going further and further away from the
[11:49] truth
[11:50] their actions bore witness to the depths
[11:52] to which they had sunk
[11:56] thou holdest fast my name
[11:59] to whom can we go
[12:01] thou alone has the words of eternal life
[12:04] they held fast then they were holding
[12:06] fast now
[12:07] but not with fatalistic dread as men who
[12:09] live out barren lives
[12:11] they were holding fast in his strength
[12:13] in the assurance of the spirit that they
[12:15] were one in him
[12:17] theirs was the sure knowledge of sins
[12:19] forgiven and they bore the name of
[12:21] christian in testimony to it they knew
[12:24] and loved that name that was above every
[12:26] name
[12:27] their knees had bowed to that name
[12:30] their tongues had confessed to it
[12:32] whatsoever they did they did it all in
[12:34] the name of the lord jesus
[12:36] they had named that name and departed
[12:38] from evil and having taken their stand
[12:40] they were now prepared to die for that
[12:42] name being assured of a better
[12:44] resurrection
[12:46] take the name of jesus with you child of
[12:48] sorrow and of woe
[12:50] it will joy and comfort give you
[12:52] take it then where you go
[12:55] precious name oh how sweet hope of earth
[12:58] and joy of heaven
[13:01] already in the second century those
[13:02] words
[13:03] father son and holy ghost had spelled
[13:06] out trinity to many
[13:08] and the polytheistic idea of three gods
[13:10] had become a doctrine in the false
[13:12] church
[13:13] it would not be long until the name was
[13:15] taken away as indeed it was in this age
[13:18] and in its stead the titles of the one
[13:20] great god would be substituted for the
[13:23] name
[13:23] lord jesus christ
[13:26] while the many apostasized and embraced
[13:28] a trinity and baptized using the titles
[13:30] of godhead
[13:32] the little flock still baptized in the
[13:33] name of jesus christ and so held to the
[13:36] truth
[13:37] with so many dishonoring god turning him
[13:40] into three gods and changing his
[13:42] gracious name to titles
[13:44] one would wonder if the signs and
[13:45] wonders that attend such a great name
[13:47] would still be visited amongst the
[13:49] people
[13:50] indeed those signs were mightily and
[13:52] wonderfully manifested though certainly
[13:54] not in the false vine
[13:56] men like martin were greatly used and
[13:58] god bore them witness both by signs and
[14:01] wonders and gifts of the holy ghost
[14:04] that name was still effectual as it
[14:05] always has been and ever will be where
[14:07] the saints honor him through the word
[14:09] and faith
[14:12] thou hast not denied my faith
[14:16] in acts 3 16
[14:18] when peter was asked how the mighty
[14:20] miracle had taken place upon the
[14:21] crippled one at the gate beautiful
[14:24] he explained it on this wise
[14:26] and his jesus name through faith in his
[14:30] jesus name have made this man former
[14:33] strong
[14:35] yea the faith which is by from him jesus
[14:38] hath given him the man
[14:40] this perfect soundness in the presence
[14:42] of you all
[14:44] see there it is
[14:46] jesus name and jesus faith brought about
[14:48] the miracle
[14:50] peter did not claim it was his own human
[14:52] faith any more than he claimed that it
[14:54] was his own name
[14:55] he said that jesus name used in the
[14:57] faith which is from jesus performed that
[14:59] great work
[15:01] this faith is what the lord was speaking
[15:02] about in revelation 2 13.
[15:05] it was his faith
[15:07] it was not faith in him
[15:09] but it was his own faith that he had
[15:12] given to the believers
[15:14] romans 12 3
[15:17] according as god hath dealt to every man
[15:19] according to verse 1 the men are
[15:21] brethren the measure of faith
[15:24] ephesians 2 8
[15:26] by grace are you saved through faith and
[15:29] that faith not of yourself
[15:31] it is a gift of god
[15:33] and it also says in james 2 1
[15:36] my brethren notice he too is talking to
[15:39] brethren
[15:40] have not the faith of not in
[15:43] our lord jesus christ with respect of
[15:45] persons
[15:47] in this pergamian age where men were
[15:49] humanizing salvation having turned from
[15:52] the truth that salvation is of the lord
[15:54] having cast aside the doctrine of
[15:56] election and opened wide the church door
[15:58] and their fellowship to any and all who
[16:00] subscribe to their tenants never mind
[16:02] the word
[16:04] in this age of rapid degradation
[16:06] there were still the few who had the
[16:08] measure of that faith of our lord jesus
[16:10] christ
[16:11] and not only used that faith in acts of
[16:13] power but withstood those who dared to
[16:16] say that they were saved simply on the
[16:18] grounds of joining a church
[16:20] they knew that no man could truly
[16:22] believe unto eternal life and the
[16:23] righteousness of god apart from the
[16:26] measure of the faith of the lord jesus
[16:27] himself
[16:29] as today's church is filled with mental
[16:31] believers who endorse the virgin birth
[16:33] the shed blood
[16:34] going to church and taking communion and
[16:37] are not reborn at all
[16:39] even so in that third age was the same
[16:41] problem
[16:42] human faith wasn't enough then and it is
[16:44] not enough now
[16:46] it takes the very faith of the son of
[16:48] god to drop into a man's heart so that
[16:50] he can receive the lord of glory into
[16:52] the temple not made with hands
[16:55] this was a living faith
[16:58] i live by the faith of the son of god
[17:01] paul did not say that he lived by faith
[17:03] in the son of god
[17:04] it was the faith of the son of god that
[17:06] had given him life and kept him living
[17:08] in christian victory
[17:11] no they had not denied that salvation
[17:13] was supernatural from start to finish
[17:16] they kept alive the truth of his name
[17:17] and his faith and they were blessed by
[17:20] the lord and accounted worthy of him
[17:24] antipas my faithful martyr
[17:27] there is no other record in the word or
[17:29] in any profane history concerning this
[17:31] brother
[17:32] but surely there need not be
[17:34] it is more than enough that he was for
[17:36] known and known of the lord
[17:38] it is more than enough to see his
[17:40] faithfulness unto the lord recorded in
[17:42] the living word
[17:43] he was a christian
[17:45] he had the name of jesus
[17:47] he had the faith of our lord jesus
[17:48] christ and he was amongst those who
[17:50] lived by it
[17:51] he had responded to the words of james
[17:54] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[17:56] christ with respect of persons
[17:59] full of the holy ghost and faith as was
[18:01] stephen he respected no one he feared no
[18:03] one and when death was pronounced upon
[18:06] all who would take that name and walk in
[18:08] the faith of jesus christ he took his
[18:10] stand with those who would not turn back
[18:13] yes he died but like abel he obtained a
[18:16] witness from god
[18:17] his name is written in the word
[18:20] and though dead his voice still speaks
[18:22] in the pages of god's divine record
[18:25] another faithful martyr was carried to
[18:27] his rest
[18:28] but satan did not triumph then even as
[18:30] he did not triumph when he killed the
[18:32] prince of peace for as satan was
[18:34] despoiled at the cross
[18:36] even so now will the blood of antipas
[18:38] cry out to hundreds more who will take
[18:40] up their crosses and follow him
[18:43] where satan's seat is
[18:46] the reason that this is part of the
[18:47] eulogy of the spirit is because these
[18:49] brave soldiers of the cross were
[18:51] overcoming satan right in the midst of
[18:53] his own throne room
[18:55] they were winning the battle through the
[18:56] name and faith of jesus right in the
[18:58] camp of the leaders of darkness
[19:00] what a tremendous commendation
[19:03] like the mighty men of david who invaded
[19:04] the camp of the enemy to bring david
[19:06] thirst quenching water
[19:08] so these giants of faith invaded the
[19:10] realm of satan's earthly stronghold
[19:13] and by preaching and exhorting brought
[19:15] the water of salvation to those who
[19:16] lived under the shadow of death
[19:20] now as much as these words concerning
[19:22] the throne and realm of satan are a part
[19:24] of god's praise for his elect
[19:26] they actually set the stage for the
[19:27] denouncement of the evil that has gained
[19:29] supremacy in the church
[19:32] pergamus
[19:33] satan's throne and dwelling place
[19:36] to many these phrases have been merely
[19:38] pictorial rather than truly historical
[19:41] but they are surely real and history
[19:43] bears that out
[19:44] pergamus was indeed the throne and
[19:46] dwelling place of satan
[19:48] it happened on this wise
[19:50] pergamos was not originally the place
[19:52] where satan as concerning human affairs
[19:55] dwelt babylon has always been literally
[19:57] and figuratively his headquarters it was
[20:00] in the city of babylon that satanic
[20:02] worship had its origin
[20:04] genesis 10 8-10
[20:06] and cush begat nimrod he began to be a
[20:09] mighty one in the earth
[20:11] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[20:13] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[20:15] babel and iraq and akhad and kalna in
[20:18] the land of shiner
[20:20] genesis 11 1-9
[20:23] and the whole earth was of one language
[20:25] and of one speech and it came to pass as
[20:28] they journeyed from the east that they
[20:30] found a plane in the land of shiner and
[20:32] they dwelt there
[20:33] and they said one to another
[20:35] go to let us make brick and burn them
[20:38] thoroughly
[20:39] and they had brick for stone and slime
[20:41] they had for mortar
[20:43] and they said
[20:44] go to let us build us a city and a tower
[20:46] whose top may reach unto heaven and let
[20:49] us make us a name lest we be scattered
[20:51] abroad upon the face of the whole earth
[20:54] and the lord came down to see the city
[20:56] and the tower which the children of men
[20:58] builded
[20:59] and the lord said
[21:01] behold the people is one and they have
[21:03] all one language and this they begin to
[21:06] do and now nothing will be restrained
[21:08] from them which they have imagined to do
[21:11] go to let us go down and there confound
[21:14] their language that they may not
[21:15] understand one another's speech
[21:18] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[21:19] thence upon the face of all the earth
[21:22] and they left off to build the city
[21:24] therefore is the name of it called babel
[21:27] because the lord did there confound the
[21:28] language of all the earth
[21:30] and from thence did the lord scatter
[21:32] them abroad upon the face of all the
[21:34] earth
[21:36] babel is the original name for babylon
[21:38] it means confusion
[21:40] it was literally started by cush the son
[21:42] of ham but was brought to a kingdom of
[21:45] power and grandeur under his son nimrod
[21:47] the mighty hunter
[21:49] nimrod according to the genesis 11
[21:51] account and also according to profane
[21:53] history set out to accomplish three
[21:55] things he wanted to build a strong
[21:57] nation which he did he wanted to
[21:59] propagate his own religion which he did
[22:01] he wanted to make a name for himself
[22:03] which he also accomplished
[22:05] his accomplishments were so monumental
[22:07] that the kingdom of babylon was called
[22:08] the head of gold amongst all world
[22:10] governments
[22:12] that his religion gained prominence is
[22:14] proven by the fact that scripture
[22:16] identifies it with satan completely in
[22:18] isaiah chapter 14 and in revelation
[22:21] chapter 17 through 18.
[22:23] and by history we can prove that it
[22:25] invaded the whole world and is the basis
[22:27] for every system of idolatry and the
[22:29] theme of mythology though the names of
[22:32] the gods differ in various sections of
[22:33] the land according to the language of
[22:35] the people
[22:36] that he made a name for himself and his
[22:38] followers goes without saying for as
[22:40] long as this present age goes on until
[22:42] jesus reveals himself to his brethren he
[22:45] will be worshipped and honored though
[22:47] under a different name from nimrod and
[22:49] in a temple slightly different from the
[22:50] one in which he was originally adored
[22:53] since the bible does not deal in the
[22:54] histories of other nations in detail it
[22:57] will be necessary to search the ancient
[22:59] profane records to find our answer as to
[23:01] how pergamos became the seat of the
[23:03] satanic religion of babylon
[23:05] the major sources of information will be
[23:08] in records of egyptian and grecian
[23:09] culture
[23:10] the reason for this is that egypt
[23:12] received her science and mathematics
[23:14] from the chaldeans and in turn greece
[23:16] received them from egypt
[23:18] now since the priests were in charge of
[23:20] teaching these sciences and since these
[23:22] sciences were used as a part of religion
[23:24] we already know the key as to how the
[23:26] babylonish religion gained its strength
[23:28] in these two countries it is also true
[23:31] that whenever a nation was able to
[23:32] overcome another nation in due time the
[23:35] religion of the subduer became the
[23:36] religion of the subdued
[23:39] it is well known that the greeks had the
[23:40] very same signs of the zodiac as did the
[23:42] babylonians and it has been found in the
[23:45] ancient egyptian records that the
[23:47] egyptians gave the greeks their
[23:48] knowledge of polytheism
[23:50] thus the mysteries of babylon spread
[23:52] from nation to nation until it appeared
[23:54] in rome in china india and even in both
[23:57] north and south america we find the very
[23:59] same basic worship
[24:02] the ancient histories agree with the
[24:03] bible that this babylonish religion was
[24:05] most certainly not the original religion
[24:07] of earth's early peoples
[24:09] it was the first to drift away from the
[24:11] original faith
[24:13] but it was not itself the original one
[24:15] historians such as wilkinson and mallet
[24:18] have proven conclusively from the
[24:20] ancient documents that at one time all
[24:22] the peoples of the earth believed in one
[24:24] god supreme eternal invisible
[24:27] who by the word of his mouth spoke all
[24:29] things into existence
[24:31] and that in his character he was loving
[24:33] and good and just
[24:35] but as satan will always corrupt
[24:37] whatever he can we find him corrupting
[24:39] the minds and hearts of men so that they
[24:41] reject the truth
[24:43] as he has always attempted to receive
[24:45] worship as though he were god and not
[24:47] the servant and creation of god he drew
[24:49] worship away from god to the end that he
[24:52] might draw it unto himself and so be
[24:53] exalted
[24:55] he certainly did accomplish his desire
[24:57] to spread his religion throughout the
[24:58] whole world this is authenticated by god
[25:01] in the book of romans
[25:03] when they knew god they glorified him
[25:06] not as god until they became vain in
[25:07] their imaginations and through darkness
[25:10] of heart accepted a corrupted religion
[25:12] to the extent that they worshiped
[25:14] creatures and not the creator
[25:16] remember satan was a creature of god son
[25:19] of the morning
[25:20] thus we find that where once truth was
[25:22] disseminated amongst men and all hell to
[25:25] that one truth there later came a day
[25:27] when a vast group turned from god and
[25:29] spread a diabolical form of worship
[25:31] around the world
[25:32] history bears it out that those of the
[25:34] tribe of shem that stood with the
[25:36] unchanging truth were in solid
[25:38] opposition to those of ham who turned
[25:40] away from truth to the devil's lie
[25:42] there is no time to engage in a
[25:44] discussion of this it is merely
[25:46] introduced that you may see there were
[25:48] two religions and two only and the evil
[25:50] one became worldwide
[25:52] monotheism turned to polytheism in
[25:55] babylon the devils
[25:57] [Music]
[26:29] you
