[2:42] we ask this in jesus name
[2:44] amen
[2:46] okay um
[2:48] let's see how do we get started with the
[2:51] powerpoint okay what this this year is
[2:54] um
[2:56] i've condensed it considerably and the
[2:59] reason is because we have very limited
[3:00] time uh as opposed to times in the past
[3:05] so we're going to cover
[3:06] five things i'm going to cover the
[3:08] general account the missions account the
[3:10] building fund account the tithe and
[3:11] offering box and we'll talk about that
[3:13] unfortunately we do this we're doing
[3:15] this during sunday school and there's
[3:17] only nobody here
[3:18] and the and everyone that needs to hear
[3:20] it are the ones that aren't here
[3:22] so i don't know hopefully they'll show
[3:23] up before i talk about tithe and
[3:24] offering box
[3:25] and then uh we have a vote also on the
[3:27] change to the bylaws
[3:29] so there's going to be a change that
[3:30] that we've needed actually it was like a
[3:32] year ago we had talked about this and
[3:34] just hadn't happened
[3:38] okay the general account did everybody
[3:40] see that okay
[3:42] all right we had we started with the
[3:44] beginning balance of sixteen thousand
[3:46] four hundred fifty nine dollars and
[3:48] seventy cents
[3:49] um
[3:50] and then our our income for the year
[3:54] was twenty thousand nine hundred fifty
[3:56] two dollars and nine cents now this is
[3:57] the general account
[3:59] so in offerings we had the offerings of
[4:01] twenty thousand seven fifteen ninety
[4:03] nine
[4:04] i don't know why i'm looking back there
[4:05] actually i printed all this out so i
[4:06] didn't have to do that
[4:08] um
[4:13] and then the uh we had other i have no
[4:15] idea what the other is for you know we
[4:17] have a contribution
[4:19] envelope
[4:20] and on the contribution it's a generic
[4:22] envelope that we buy at the bookstore
[4:26] and it's got a lot of um categories one
[4:28] of the categories is other well we had
[4:30] 67 somebody gave for other
[4:33] i have no idea what the others supposed
[4:35] to be so but it was other
[4:37] so we had 767 another and then youth
[4:39] ministry of 170 so our total again 20
[4:43] 950.99
[4:45] our expense
[4:46] was 17
[4:49] 376 dollars and 33 cents
[4:52] now amazon is our what i would call our
[4:55] primary vendor that's kind of a new
[4:58] thing for us
[4:59] we used to never spend money with amazon
[5:02] but once we went um
[5:06] what we call it we start streaming
[5:08] where you know we could people could see
[5:10] the services live
[5:12] on the internet
[5:14] um and using the internet for you know
[5:16] for our website and things
[5:18] amazon became a real
[5:21] source of things that we needed
[5:23] so they've basically become our primary
[5:25] vendor and so we spent 4811.79
[5:30] last year with amazon which to me was a
[5:32] lot of money
[5:35] we had condolence of
[5:37] cents
[5:39] and that was actually for it was two
[5:40] people um
[5:42] brother don furon part of that was when
[5:44] we went down for brother uh brother
[5:46] scott went down there
[5:48] and uh then also there was um
[5:52] there was one for
[5:53] [Music]
[5:55] i can't remember who it was i think it
[5:56] was
[5:59] what's that
[6:02] no
[6:03] no
[6:04] it wasn't it was um
[6:07] i can't remember
[6:09] anyway it was uh it was a card that we
[6:11] sent to someone
[6:13] and then anyway the easy tithe uh
[6:16] fees
[6:18] easy tithe is where people that
[6:20] give money
[6:22] online
[6:24] it goes through a company called easy
[6:25] tithe
[6:27] or through an application as well as
[6:28] company business application
[6:31] and
[6:32] so our fees for them was one thousand
[6:34] ninety dollars and thirty eight cents
[6:37] now those fees
[6:38] were all the fees for everything they
[6:40] gave so that was tied that was offering
[6:42] that's everything
[6:44] and
[6:45] when people give their money
[6:48] they have the option to
[6:51] to cover the expense they have the
[6:53] option to it's a
[6:55] it's called a convenience fee
[6:57] and they can give i think it's that we
[7:00] it's a two percent charge but in reality
[7:02] there's actually two char there's
[7:05] either if you give if you use the bank
[7:07] to pay
[7:08] it's a one percent charge if you use
[7:10] your credit card is a three percent
[7:11] charge so we just split the difference
[7:14] it's like we just charge you by two
[7:15] percent
[7:17] now to those who give the money it
[7:18] actually goes back to them as a
[7:20] contribution so even though they're
[7:22] giving that money to offset the cost
[7:24] it still goes back to the person who
[7:26] gave it as a contribution to the church
[7:28] so it goes back as an offering
[7:31] and so the the 1090 was
[7:35] was
[7:35] most of that was covered it was like 900
[7:37] of it was covered by the
[7:39] by what people gave
[7:42] then we had grounds maintenance
[7:44] of 660 now i might mention with the
[7:46] amazon
[7:48] there's there's a lot in the in the
[7:50] amazon and so there's some grounds
[7:52] maintenance in there there's some
[7:54] janitorial in there there it's mostly
[7:56] though
[7:56] most of it i say there's ground main and
[7:58] not really probably any grounds
[8:00] maintenance maybe
[8:03] like
[8:04] it would be
[8:05] building uh
[8:07] maintenance and things but most of that
[8:10] with the amazon was
[8:12] uh computers
[8:14] it was uh enter the expense of
[8:18] the internet and things like that not
[8:19] the internet actual or the the service
[8:22] charge of internet
[8:23] but the the all the pieces that have to
[8:26] be put in place
[8:28] for everything that we do
[8:31] uh hospitality we had forty eight
[8:32] dollars and thirty thirty six cents
[8:35] our insurance last year was three
[8:36] thousand nine hundred one dollars and
[8:38] thirty four cents it went up about 700
[8:40] last year
[8:41] which is
[8:43] yeah i mean it's
[8:44] it was about went up about
[8:46] 20 percent
[8:47] and that's you know for insurance that's
[8:50] pretty typical
[8:52] our janitorial was 513.8 cents
[8:56] our medical supplies i just lost sound
[9:00] our medical supplies i got it back
[9:03] thank you
[9:05] our medical supplies now i was like well
[9:07] okay what are our why do we have medical
[9:08] supplies well we we actually bought a
[9:11] first aid kit and some band-aids and
[9:14] that was 80 and 13 cents we spent with
[9:16] for medical supplies i think we got some
[9:18] masks in the included in that too
[9:20] because we've provided mass for a long
[9:22] time
[9:24] a music ministry of 20.21
[9:28] office supplies of 55.25
[9:33] we had a table rental
[9:35] and that was for the
[9:37] uh
[9:38] what was that uh
[9:40] the couple's banquet at uh
[9:42] at the carlins
[9:44] there was a table rental
[9:46] 53.75 cents we had utilities our
[9:49] utilities went up
[9:51] ah last year was like i think it was i
[9:53] believe it's like 5200 last year
[9:56] something like that so
[9:58] our utilities did go up
[10:01] but our utilities include gas water
[10:04] trash
[10:07] gas water trash
[10:09] our
[10:10] internet service
[10:13] and seems like there's one more
[10:17] pardon me
[10:18] i'm sorry
[10:21] electric i didn't say electric yeah
[10:23] electric
[10:24] sorry
[10:25] so yeah
[10:27] uh and then youth ministry where youth
[10:29] ministry
[10:30] expense of thirty dollars and eight
[10:32] cents
[10:33] so our total again our total expense is
[10:35] 17 376.33
[10:38] so we ended up with a net income
[10:43] of
[10:45] and 3576.66 cents
[10:47] and our ending balance for the year
[10:49] for the general account is twenty
[10:51] thousand thirty six dollars and thirty
[10:53] six cents
[10:55] so anyway but i was going to mention is
[10:56] if anybody has any questions just talk
[10:58] to me after the service i can give you
[11:00] all the detail any detail you want
[11:03] but so if you have any questions
[11:05] um
[11:07] the next thing that we want to talk
[11:09] about
[11:10] i got a point this way
[11:14] we're going to talk about the um
[11:17] the missions account
[11:21] our beginning balance was 1 920
[11:25] and 65 cents
[11:27] we had income of two thousand five
[11:29] hundred fifty dollars
[11:31] of that income
[11:32] [Music]
[11:33] um 365 dollars came from individuals
[11:38] and then two thousand one hundred eighty
[11:39] five dollars came from the tithe so
[11:42] there's a portion of tithe that always
[11:43] goes
[11:45] that uh brother one always wants to give
[11:47] to missions and
[11:49] so we had like i said we had an income
[11:51] of 2 550
[11:54] our
[11:54] expense uh we had expenses one thousand
[11:57] six hundred eighty dollars that was
[11:59] sixteen hundred dollars that we sent to
[12:01] tanzania and then there was an eighty
[12:03] dollar for a transfer fee actually there
[12:04] were two transfers each one was forty
[12:06] dollars
[12:07] so that's all right so that's our
[12:09] expense
[12:10] so we had a net income of 870 dollars so
[12:12] we ended up with an indian balance of
[12:14] 2798.65
[12:20] then our
[12:23] building fund account
[12:26] we had a big beginning balance of
[12:28] 1780.57
[12:31] our income total was for 405 dollars and
[12:34] 20 cents
[12:36] we had um individual contributions of
[12:38] 405 we had interest of 20 cents
[12:42] interest isn't anything like it used to
[12:44] be
[12:45] i mean years ago you'd get
[12:47] three four five percent now you might
[12:49] get
[12:50] 0.3.4
[12:52] or 0.03 i don't know it's just it's
[12:54] almost nothing
[12:57] but anyway our net net income i mean
[13:00] that's our expenses
[13:01] we had zero expenses basically we
[13:03] haven't used the building fund we we
[13:05] started it a few years back and
[13:08] there haven't been many contributors to
[13:09] it
[13:11] and so our ending balance is 2185.77
[13:17] and as you all know
[13:19] we
[13:20] we are at a point where we will soon
[13:22] need a building it doesn't look like it
[13:24] right now
[13:24] [Music]
[13:25] and you look you look at it right now
[13:27] it's like well we don't need a building
[13:29] but hey we fill up i mean when the
[13:31] service starts you know there aren't
[13:33] many people here for sunday school
[13:35] but when the regular service starts with
[13:37] so it gets pretty full i know last
[13:39] sunday of course it was mother's day
[13:41] with mother's day
[13:42] they were they have to set up chairs in
[13:44] the back
[13:45] in the four-year area
[13:47] yeah you know additional seating so we
[13:49] are
[13:50] we're we're going to be running out of
[13:51] room
[13:52] or we are running out of room
[13:55] okay i wanted to talk about that the
[13:56] tithe and offering box
[13:58] i'm
[14:00] sorry the um the tithe and offering box
[14:03] now everyone knows except our visitors
[14:06] god bless you for coming
[14:09] what's your names
[14:12] joey omega omega okay welcome
[14:16] so
[14:18] anyway
[14:19] um
[14:20] right behind joe is our tithe and
[14:22] offering box
[14:24] and um
[14:26] so i just wanted i want to explain this
[14:28] about the tithe offering box because i
[14:29] want to make sure everybody understands
[14:32] how i perceive the money that's put in
[14:34] there
[14:36] if you put loose cash in the tithing
[14:39] offering box
[14:40] it's considered a general offering
[14:42] so if you just throw cash in there it's
[14:44] an offering
[14:47] if you put cash in an unmarked envelope
[14:51] in other words you don't mark anything
[14:53] on that envelope and you stick the money
[14:55] in there and you put that in the in the
[14:57] tithe and offering box
[14:59] it's considered an offering
[15:01] anything that's anonymous unmarked is an
[15:04] offering
[15:07] if you put
[15:08] cash in a contribution envelope
[15:11] and you put your name on it and you
[15:13] don't mark anything on that envelope
[15:15] i will come and talk to you
[15:17] so if i have your name i will find you
[15:21] and i will find out where that money was
[15:22] supposed to go
[15:24] so that's how i do it just so everybody
[15:26] knows of course we don't have everybody
[15:27] here
[15:28] so maybe they'll watch it
[15:30] they'll watch the this is being recorded
[15:32] there you go so they'll be able to watch
[15:34] it if they want to
[15:36] you know what
[15:37] the
[15:38] the business
[15:39] meeting
[15:41] is not really popular
[15:43] i mean it's just
[15:44] you're talking numbers and stuff and
[15:46] [Music]
[15:48] it's not like people are really
[15:50] interested in being here and going
[15:51] through numbers
[15:54] there's only a few people like numbers
[15:58] okay so the last thing
[16:00] i believe is the last thing
[16:04] we want to talk about is a change to the
[16:06] bylaws
[16:08] so before we start we're going to vote
[16:10] on this i realize we don't have many
[16:11] people but we're going to vote anyway
[16:13] and just but so everybody knows so
[16:15] you'll know
[16:16] joe and omega we're not trying to leave
[16:18] you out but
[16:19] you have to be a voting member to vote
[16:22] and to be a voting member
[16:24] according to our bylaws you have to pay
[16:28] ties and get offerings you have to have
[16:30] regular attendance
[16:31] and you have to have been doing that for
[16:34] at least a year
[16:35] to vote
[16:37] so just so you know for everybody that's
[16:39] here
[16:40] anyway in the by-laws article
[16:43] article eight
[16:45] officers third paragraphs first and only
[16:48] sentence of that article
[16:51] currently reads
[16:52] the salary of the pastor shall be
[16:54] determined year by year at the annual
[16:56] meeting
[16:57] this is the annual meeting
[17:00] and so we're going to change that
[17:02] because last year i i and i did it i did
[17:05] it intentionally last year
[17:07] i brought this up last year to change
[17:09] brother one's salary
[17:11] and i did it intentionally because by
[17:12] our bylaws that's when we're supposed to
[17:14] do it
[17:15] and
[17:16] obviously that's not what it should be
[17:21] so what i would like to do is have it
[17:23] amended to read
[17:25] the salary of the pastor shall be
[17:27] determined year by year at the annual
[17:30] trustee meeting
[17:32] so that's a so basically all we're doing
[17:34] is we stuck one word in there trustee
[17:36] and that's what we're trying to change
[17:38] is it's rather being something done
[17:40] at the annual congregational meeting
[17:44] it's at the annual trustee meeting
[17:45] because it's really the it's between the
[17:47] the pastor
[17:49] the treasurer and the trustees
[17:51] and and all the traffic and the pastor
[17:53] and treasurer and trustees are supposed
[17:56] to be at the trustee meeting
[17:58] so that's when we will do that
[18:00] so we need to vote on that
[18:02] so and i don't think we need to be
[18:04] secret about it unless somebody thinks
[18:06] we need to be secret about it is anybody
[18:08] is anybody opposed to changing the
[18:10] bylaws
[18:13] okay has anybody
[18:15] in anybody agree with changing the
[18:17] pylons raise your hand
[18:19] okay all right well we got it all right
[18:24] and
[18:27] that's it
[18:29] how did i do for time
[18:33] this was a test
[18:35] because
[18:37] normally in the past i would take an
[18:39] hour to an hour and a half and we would
[18:42] get into the detail
[18:44] i
[18:45] i used to love getting into the detail
[18:47] but that's changed i'm not into the
[18:49] detail as much i don't i don't love
[18:51] getting into the doing the reports and
[18:53] everything and like i used to
[18:55] so i guess i'm getting old no i'm not
[18:57] i'm vintage
[19:00] sorry
[19:02] but you know i was gonna i was gonna
[19:03] mention but i i in case in case uh
[19:07] someone is watching this
[19:08] online you know we have we have a sister
[19:12] in our church
