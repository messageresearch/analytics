message and what we have and what God has given us in this hour in this day and so we're grateful for that grateful for all God has done if you'll turn with me in your Bibles this morning we'll begin reading at Revelations 81 and for a titled this morning I just entitled it Revelations 10 1-7 the third poll in full force the book The Bible open the Seven Seals revealed because the seventh seal was open in this 20th century and uh but brother Daniel we're in the 21st Century yes it's been open for some time now what God has done in our midst Revelations 8 and verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning you add the blessing of your word to each and every heart in Jesus name am amen you may be seated in a message brother Brenham preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed in 1963 he says this not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this but God knows this but if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of the second poll the third poll is at hand William bram's Ministry had three pools a vision that was given to him many years ago and it was three stages of his ministry Jesus had the same three stages in his ministry the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths that been sealed in the word of God the message anointed ones at the end time a prophet said this notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first poll healing the second pull prophesying the third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word and Prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by his word and he told us how that Vindication would come it would come by the first and second pull of the ministry he said no more higher order to reveal the word and Prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word remember the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he says do you see it and the congregation said amen and they didn't see it it wasn't the time it wasn't the season and the message what is the attraction on the mountain the question is what happened on Sunset Mountain he says what's happened upon sunset Mountain God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10: 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 1 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed he says and there shall rise false prophets and false Christ show great signs and wonders in so much a deceive the very elected if possible the people still in doubt but as usual the church is just as puzzled it was it was July of 1965 he said the people in doubt and as usual the church just this puzzles there wasn't in 1965 there was no such movement as what's called message Believers in 1965 it didn't exist the prophet was out amongst the denominations by 1965 they were not only in doubt but in most in total rejection of this ministry total rejection of what God the prophet that God had sent in the message Feast to the the trumpets Revelations 10 brother B says was the seven seal you might say well we just read Revelations 81 it says that's the seven seal ah but you see a prophet was bringing all the loose ends together what does that mean he was bringing scripture and tying scripture with scripture for us bringing it together in the message Feast of the trumpets he says look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh angel messenger of the seven seal message in Revelations 10 Revelations 10 was the seven seal he said to the seven trumpets between those two times oh God how can we say this to make the people see it and he said it exactly how it had to be said many times this style of English was an English difficult for most of us to understand unless maybe you were from Kentucky but it was spoken even as he spoke it was spoken in Parables because it was still going to require though it would come out of the mouth of a prophet it was still going to require a revelation to see it and Isaiah said a virion shall conceive and when he said it how many laughed and how many said I believe it I believe he was a man totally rejected I believe what he said said a virgin shall conceive was something that they could not see they couldn't understand it and yet it was thus saith the Lord and it came to pass there was a magazine that was put out called the Science magazine it was uh it was from the University of Arizona the head of that department at the time in 1963 was a man by the name of James E McDonald and he wrote this concerning this Cloud that appeared in the heavens it say he says an unusual ring-shaped Cloud was widely observed over Northern Arizona near Sunset on the 28th of February 1963 from a large number of obsorb observers report reports it is known to have appeared overhead near Flagstaff Arizona from initial computations based on four PHS photos taken in Tucson 1990 miles south of the cloud its altitude was approximately 35 km the most distant observation reported was made 280 mi from the cloud and the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local Sunset irid iridescence was noted by many absorbers tentatively the cloud may be regarded as similar to a nous cloud but its unusually great height and unusually low altitude plus its remarkable shape suggest it was a cloud of previously unrecorded type never seen a cloud like this before cuz it wasn't a cloud it was seven angels that came down to fulfill the word of God in Revelations 8 And1 it said and when the seven and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour John didn't tell us to the minute of of what that half hour was he just simply said about the space of a half hour but today science recorded it and tells it tells us to the minute the cloud remains sunlet for 28 minutes after Sunset it wasn't a full half hour that's why John that's why John said it was about the space of a half hour and now science in this day 2,000 years later is telling us folks it was exactly 28 minutes we recorded it they said it that was most close to narus Cloud narus clouds are Ice polar Stratosphere stratospheric clouds are a rare type of cloud that forms in very cold conditions and at high altitudes they're known for their iridescent colors which are created when sunlight interacts with tiny ice crystals they are made of according to the word m mological organization the name nous comes from NRE another name for mother of pearl which we refers to their iridescent appearance they are sometimes called mother of pearl clouds but this type of cloud it takes Ice polar Stratosphere to create this type of cloud you'll have to believe me when I tell you there ain't no Ice polar stratospheres in Arizona that didn't happen but what did happen is God descended God came down to fulfill his word in Acts 7 and verse 1 in Acts chap 1: 7 Luke says this as he's writing down all the things that he saw and to testify of and he said verse one chapter 1 verse 7 and he said unto them it's not good for you know for you to know the times or the seasons he said to it's it it is not not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and and at this point it'd be a little bit of a stretch for me to tell you and that cloud was seven angels be a little bit of a stretch if if more wasn't recorded in God's holy word yes and when he had spoken these things and they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven because of the statement that these two angels from the very presence of God made then we realize it was seven angels because he's Hebrews 13 and8 he's the same yesterday today and forever unchanged in all his ways and if we can see the pattern of the opening of the word when the first seal opened at the first coming of Christ we can then begin to see and recognize our day in its message Isaiah 28 and verse 9 and 10 it says Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and they're a little when when the when the prophet Isaiah wrote this prophecy it was a time when much had to be added to this book called The Bible yet but at the end of the book it said no one can add to it or take from it now the book is complete both statements are true must be line upon line and word upon word precept upon precept here a little and there a little and the latter is also true in the last pages of the Bible that's it it is finished Revelations 10 verse 1 and 2 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand the little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth verse verse one says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head I don't know how many of you have had the opportunity to see the original Life Magazine of the picture of the cloud in there and you you open up the magazine and it's towards the back last few pages towards the back and you open it up they have the the cloud picture and a short little thing mysterious ring Cloud appeared over Arizona they go in to say and uh they don't say a lot about it because they don't know anything of it yeah it was all assumptions it was it was a supernatural phenomenon that they never could explain but it was it was worthy of them noting it because it was so unusual and that's what they called it but there was something else that happened was that was so unusual also at the same time on the islands of Hawaii there was what they called a midnight rainbow very un un usual very unusual and they also included that picture in the Life magazine and they say it this this was one of the first times that uh uh that a midnight rainbow had ever been photographed and they took that picture of that midnight rainbow and guess where they placed it they placed it back to back on the picture with the cloud and uh so when you take that Life magazine and you pick up the picture and put it to the light you see a rainbow over the cloud picture right God Alone can bring circumstances together and fulfill his word Revelations 10:7 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were a sun and his feet as pill of fire and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand the little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left on the earth so on the front side of the magazine is the picture of the cloud and a high cloud ring of mystery that took place they took the picture but on the back side we have rainbow of moon beams but it happened at at about 11:00 at night very unusual the photographer had to be at the right place at the right time for everything to fall in place and him to be able to take a picture of that and when you put it up to the light you see you you you see this rainbow exactly overhead on the cloud picture here back to back only God could anoint men who aren't even Believers some even ungodly atheist and take a picture that was taken in Arizona and take a picture that was taken Haw and bring them together so that we could see this day this scripture was fulfilled modern events being made clear by prophecy the message modern events made clear by prophecy in 1965 it's December the 6 and God will be taking them home soon he said these modern events is slipping by us too swiftly and that one day we're going to find out we'll be left behind with nothing and be caught sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age for it foretells us the author has done this before the author has done this before at the first coming of Christ the author has done this before and now it's the second coming and he's doing it again the author has done this before and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in the Methodist age the Baptist age we're living in the bride Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back he promised to do it brother bandom called Revelations 10 the bride age in the message this day the scriptures fulfilled he says and I and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus' name and all these things have been revealed but there are secrets that's hid inside because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I must go there to find it and you must go there to find it yeah it's in the Bible it's not it's not another book it's a book you have laying around the home it's a book you have on the shelves it's a book that maybe you that you carry in your that you that you carry in your car it's a book that we've had under our arms and packing it in and out of church for many years it's in that book where you must go to find it yes and you've got to know that there's something there that God wants you to find so that you can recognize your day your message and who you are in this book yeah that's right he said that morning when those seven angels came down and blasted the Earth the Rocks flew Every Way Seven Angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be open and some say it's not open yet and yet a prophet said the angel told him seven angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be open all we lack is revelation yes amen here here we are today understanding serpent seed in a few days if God willing will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and we do by the grace of God and all these things that God has opened every seal the Mysteries and the the Mysteries since the foundation of the world and we've been enjoying the presence of his Blessing that is true and this day the scriptures fulfill he says he said of Revelations 10 Revelations 10 it's his coming it's his second coming he said in the in the message the breach he says now it's wrote mysterious because no man know where knows it God Alone Jesus Christ see now but it is a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will be be will will not be thoroughly understood it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed at and the Mysteries come down from God is the word of God reveals the entire revelation of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed now now you see I'm just not making that up that's what it's thus saith the Lord he says I'll read it to you out of the book The sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared By His prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seven Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel on the earth at the time of his coming so what is Revelations 10 a prophet said it's the seventh seal I thought and you thought that Revelations 81 was the seven seal and that's it but a prophet came and he's dub tailing scripture with scripture now so now the seven seal we don't have just one verse but now he just added 11 verses to that detail upon detail of what God would do at the opening of The Seven Seals what is Seven Seals it's seven parts of one Plan of Redemption amen it's the Lamb's Book of Life that was sealed yes and when the Lamb's Book of Life is unsealed you and I have the life of the Lamb that's right what is Revelations 10 it's the seven seal what is Revelations 10 it's the time of the Bride age he told us what is Revelations 10 it's his coming it's his second coming what is Revelations 10 it's when the Seven Seals of God were open there on the mountain and we ask the question when were the Seven Seals open and we get the answer when the Seven Seals of God were opened there on the mountain him and he hadn't even preached it yet why because when God opens his word he doesn't need anyone to be around to open his word God said let there be light in the beginning was anyone around no when was it written about 2200 years later Moses wrote it gave the account of it yeah it didn't even have to be written for him to do it for him to bring a creation in the beginning he just had to speak it and it came to pass and he told us later I hope this is the L the latter time for us now when he's telling us and you can receive it by Revelation his word what is Revelations 10 it's when those Seven Seals of God were opened there on the mountain what is Revelations 10 he told us it's the third po you say where did he say that brother brother Daniel the Seven Seals of God who was open there in the mountain in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother brandham says this and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain let God no let me die right now at this point open if that ain't the truth and many say no it's not open and brother brandom says and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain let God no let me die right now at this Pulpit if that ain't the truth and I foretold you a year and six months before it happened I told you a year and 6 months before what had happened how many years has has it been since then oh God help us to get into his word amen God help us to be Bible readers God help us to grow and be spiritual how do we do that we read our Bibles and pray every day it'll raise your level of spirituality it'll raise your level of being sensitive to the holy spirit in your life not just at church where our emotions can get worked up but at home at work everywhere you go your level of your level of spirituality to be able to sense the presence of God wherever you're at and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there in the mountain let God no let me die right now at this Pulpit if that ain't the truth and I foretold you a year and six months before it happened what he told me go to Arizona and what would happen out there in the desert there's men sitting here tonight was standing right there present when the seven angels came down and even the magazine Life Magazine packed the whole article of it it's right there in the observatory and everything now they don't even know what it's all about and many today are members of a movement called the message movement and and and they don't even know what it's all about because you know why because it's a personal experience with Jesus Christ that's why and that's what people are lacking a personal experience with Jesus Christ to be able to have Revelation because Revelation is communing with God yes Revelation is a friendship restored with the Father the Born Again experience the three steps of Grace the baptism of the Holy Ghost and filling after refilling of his spirit it's a personal experience not just one time over and over and over again am over and over the song said he molds me and makes me a vessel of clay I'm in his hands oh God and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain the cloud was photographed on February the 28th 1963 on March the 17th 1963 William Brandon Begins the sounding of the seventh angel M Ministry with with God in Simplicity March the 24th he preaches the seventh seal from the time that the cloud was photographed to the day he preaches the seven seal 25 days have passed so from the appearing of the cloud to the preaching of the seven seal was 25 days so from Revelations 101 to Revelations 10:7 was 25 days you say whoa brother Daniel slow down is anything too hard for the Lord we'd like to think that it's still not fulfilled but it is fulfilled we'd like to think that we're not living in darkness but sometimes we are living in darkness if we'd like to think that that it's still that we've got a lot of time on this Earth to prepare ourselves no today is the day today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts as to what God has done in this hour and God can lift you up by Revelation to a level that has maybe taken others 30 years 40 50 years to get where we're at me included but he can lift you up today with Revelation so from the appearing of the cloud on February the 28th to the preaching of the seventh seal in March 24th 25 days so from Revelations 10:1 to Revelations 10:7 25 days and the prophet is in the full cycle of a third po Ministry the revealing of the word oh if you could see how incredible the day that we're living in he says the seals has now been broke he says we're breaking them now the thing is open he say in the message of first seal 1963 now them reformers know there was something wrong Luther knowed that that the bread wasn't the body of Christ and so he preached the just shall live by faith and that was his message and when John Wesley came along he saw that there was sanctification so he preached sanctification that was his message see the Pentecostals brought in the message the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts but in the last days in the last age the messenger is not to start any Reformation but is to take all the Mysteries that those reformers left off gather them together and solve them to the people let me just read it again it sounds so good to me I like to read it I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his head and his face was the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire now we've saw the same thing which was Christ and we know Christ is always the messenger to the church all right he's called the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant and so forth he had in his hand a little book open now the he says now the seals he said had done been broke because he saw them what God did there upon the mountain now the seals have done been broke and then he says why we're breaking them now this thing is open Revelations 10:3 and 4 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not what was these Thunders the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened in the first seal 1963 paragraph 263 we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that se he says we found what the thunder means years ago we were visiting in another state and and uh we were talking a little bit and some brother's at a table and I tell them well I think we found what the thunder means and that it's perfect and we know that we all know that and everyone's just quiet no one says nothing and then a brother that's right next to me he elbows me with his hand he says brother Daniel we don't all know that why don't you just tell us and he said we found what that thunder means that's perfectly we know that see the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about questions and answers 1963 they asked him a question have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet no he says they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seven Church age when brother Bram preached the first seal he said he says let's turn to The Book of Matthew and then he says no let's go to St John 12 first so in his in his mind he was going to take us back to Matthew because he said no let's go to St John 12 First St John 12 is where Bible readers where you you'll remember Jesus saying that then all people are all around him there and some said they heard as though it was the sound of a thunder some said said no it was the voice of God and brother brandom when he's preaching the first seal takes us to that scripture in St John 12 where where they heard the voice as of though it was a thunder and if you'll remember in Revelation 61 and the first seal he says and when the lamb had opened the book he says I heard as though it was a thunder the opening of the first seal a thunder broke loose and a prophet when he preaches the first seal takes to takes us there to St John 12 and shows us where the first seal opened because the first seal is the first coming of Christ and the first seal is part one of seven parts of this great Lamb's Book of Life bringing Redemption bringing salvation not only for Israel but for a gentile Bride for on the cross of Calvary when Israel rejected and believe me what they rejected was the opening of the book and the Revelation and the loosing of these Seven Seals when Israel rejected that then that was given to a gentile bride the open book and the loosing of these Seven Seals which is seven parts of our great plan to save us to baptize us to cleanse us to give us overcoming power against all immorality of this day Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about no they were revealed and the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make it out John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it John knew it was the ministry of another Prophet to come John knew it wasn't his place to say it John knew it wasn't the time to say it John knew it wasn't for him to say it he said John knew what it was about but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church ages John Couldn't Write it because if he' had wrote it he would have said and go back to Jeffersonville Indiana and you'll be given the revelation of those Seven Seals they didn't even know what a Jeffersonville Indiana was back in those days in the days of John just hide it the time will come when what what told what I told you not to write will make sense to the Bride of Jesus Christ in the last Church age at the second coming of Christ so what is Revelations 10 that a prophet told us he said it's the seventh seal he said Revelations 10 is the bride age he said Revelations 10 it his coming to the bride he said Revelations 10 it's the sounding of the seventh angel this third pole Ministry the revealing of the word he he said Revelations 10 it's a heart turning time not information not education but Revelation a personal experience with the father made possible through the blood of Jesus Christ seven Thunders will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers in an exposition of the seven Church ages it's written now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so he says and the message standing in the Gap June of 1963 he said the first night the first angel came he says and they all came the same way and they all came the same way it was seven Thunders now we know what they said to John so a prophet said in the standing in the gap it's June now three or four months later he said the first night the first Angel and they all came the same way so you so if you've listened to these Seven Seals and heard them all and couldn't hear in what a prophet was saying that they all came the same way go back and hear it again but I will tell you this of what he told us about those Seven Seals when he preached them there in 1963 was this much of what the Holy Spirit continued to add of this third po Ministry all the way to 1965 when God took him home he was continuing to add more and more Revelation about these Seven Seals what is Seven Seals Seven Seals is seven parts of one book of redemption because you see a seal if I could the Bible was written in Scrolls and a scroll was just a paper a a something made of animal skins they would take and they'd roll it up and when you listen to the first heal you can hear the prophet doing the same thing rolling up a piece of paper and the seal was placed on the outside of that scroll it holded shut amongst men of nobility amongst the rich the Kings they pour wax on it maybe pour the wax on a leather strap they'd embed their logo of their ring on it have the messenger take it to the to to whom it was going to go this this important message when that man would receive it he would pull off the seal he just Let It Drop to the ground don't let the term seal confuse you he would take off the seal drop it to the ground because what he wanted was contained in the Lamb's Book of Life what you want for your life the changes you're looking for is contained in the Lamb's Book of Life what you want is in this Bible yeah amen this Bible will teach you how to be a good father this Bible will teach you how to be a faithful husband this Bible will teach you how to set your home in order the pastor must set the church in order but the head of every home you must set your house in order you must make it a place where is Jesus when he went into the synagogue that day and he grabbed himself the Bible says he made himself off a strap of leather and he begin turning over the tables of the money changers he began opening the cages let all the doves fly loose can open the cages let all the Lambs go go out he said the Zeal of God is upon me he says he says my house is to be a house of prayer and you've made it a den ofes we've come back again when the Zeal of God should be in our lives and our homes should be houses of prayer amen wouldn't be a den of Thieves a den of Thieves my house brother Daniel yes it just depends what you let come on the screen those are the thieves that come into your lives those are the thieves that steal steal your children away those are the thieves that bring deception those are the thieves that bring discouragement those are the thieves that bring doubt into your life and into your hearts oh beware of this internet system are we in a time when you must work with it all yes but beware be sensitive to his presence even while you're working even while you're in these systems God rich in Mercy he says well it it happens standing in the Gap well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning or was standing here when it happened it actually shook the Rocks off the mountain we find out that during that time I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for God he didn't fail neither did God fail it's exactly what took place and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for God if you haven't got them if Jesus terries and I my great grandchildren little Paul's children that will still be that will still be the Eternal truth of the Living God now that was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain that wasn't wrote it had to be interpreted and when I come back the first Angel and the first night opened the seal contrary to anything we ever heard in our life and all seven came out the same way you know that you were present when it happened many of you but the things he said about this seven seal increased dramatically from 1963 to 1965 and when God finally took him home we now have an open book and all Seven Seals have been loosed so we can so the so that we can take our fingers and turn the pages of this Bible and it's no longer a book of confusion should I be baptizing the titles of father son Holy Ghost so I be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ which is it well most of the world tells us I'd rather take what Jesus said than a backslid fisherman that denied him three times mind you three times I can understand once I can understand twice but three times no no I'll take what Jesus said but Jesus ministry was in Parables that was a parable and The Parables were prophecies and the Fulfillment of the prophecy it was Acts 238 so now they come together exactly prophecy and the revelation of the prophecy that's how this Bible was written he said I'll hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and I'll reveal it to babes such as could be taught born those who can be born again will catch the Revelation but unless you be born again you cannot see this Kingdom of Heaven the time of the seven sealed voices is when he begins to sound in the message is this a sign of the answer Prophet says this now when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished now note then it's time for the seven seal voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed do you understand he says when all the mysteries of the book has completed and the Bible said here that it would finish the Myst Mysteries when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished so then it it it brings the question well when did he begin to sound brother Daniel when did that sounding begin Revelations 10 it's the seven seal Revelations 10 he told us it's the bride age Revelations 10 it's his coming all of these things Revelations 10 is all of these things Revelations 10 it's when the Seven Seals were opened there on the mountain February the 28th 1963 Revelations 10 it's when the seventh angel begins to sound March 17th 1963 this precious Bible by the mouth of a prophet we even dare to put dates of when it unfolded you say be careful brother Daniel no I'm not looking forward for this I'm looking back to what a prophet has said I'm not saying I see the future and yet I see the future by his grace Revelations 10: 5 and 6 and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein the earth and the things that are therein the Sea and the things which which are therein that there should be time no longer and they asked the the Prophet The Question Time ended with the preaching of the seals with the renom Seven Seals seven Thunders he says it's all in there what happened he says the Mysteries was revealed no he says time didn't end in the message questions and answers 1964 he says now if time ceases when the seals were open they're asking him this question now if time ceases when the seals were open if time ceased pardon me when the seals were open then the Millennium is also finished is it not no no time didn't cease when the seals were open you misunderstood it what happened the Mysteries was revealed not time ceased see just look watch real close now play your tape if you got it from a tape see time never ceased until this must be a post millennial or something that ask the question because see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the Earth then time ceases in the new heavens and the new Earth now the Millennium is not the new heavens and the new Earth there's still to be sin after the Millennium the Millennium is a type of Noah going in the ark and carried over brought ham and them other on the other side and sin is even come out of the Ark see Revelations 10:6 and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things therein are and the Earth the things there in are and the Sea the things there in are that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophet Revelations 10 is when the seventh angel begins to sound his message then he tells us it wasn't the healing service it was the message that follows that healing service when Revelations 10:7 would be fulfilled so he he wasn't acting out that part of Revelations 10:7 back in 1946 when he began having a Ministry of praying for the sick he was fulfilling his word the word of God as a prophet of God but he was fulfilling it was the second coming of Christ and he was falling into the pattern of the word remember Matthew 4 when Jesus begins his ministry how did he begin as an evangelist having great campaigns of thousands and thousands and he's praying for the sick so this idea of the three poles of the prophet in this age it's nothing new he's done this thing before in the beginning at the first coming of Christ because he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's unchanging in all his ways and once we can see the pattern of his word as we read our Bibles then the Bible becomes a whole new book for us listen to this the message I have heard but now I see now we're promised the church age through reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern in the last days of what would took place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers for that very purpose and the church is so bre broke up in denominations and ISM it's so tore to Pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and you know what there's a carrier yet today in this day that we're living there is don't say it brother Daniel don't go there there is a carrier today it's called a message movement but within this message movement there's a little bride there's a mystical body of Jesus Christ how many want to be part of that body he said you belong to a local church that's good he says but if you don't belong to that Mystic physical body you won't make it you won't make it how do you get into that body you must be born again if if ever there's been a time when less people are being really born again it's this day we're living the last days now we're promised the church ate the reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he' keep his pattern in the last days what would take place they turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers for that very purpose and the church is so broke up and denominations and ISM it's so tore to Pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angels message the Seven Seals would be revealed the mysteries of God would be declared Revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service is the Fulfillment of Revelations 10 in the message the Rapture 1965 a prophet says the seventh angel when he began to sound forth his mystery not when he started out praying for the sick that wasn't the Fulfillment of Revelations 10:7 listen now there's a messenger above always and a messenger on Earth the English word angel means a messenger and in the seventh Angel's message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and Afflicted all that great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church but when he sat down one day and said I and my father are one that was different that was different and except you eat the Flesh of the son a man and drink his blood you have no life in you Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and Afflicted oh that great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church when you when you sat down one day and said I and my father are one that was different when you sit down to witness to someone this day and say I and my father are one I I've entered into a relationship a restored friendship with the father that's what the Born Again experiences about that's what being a son and daughter adopted of the holy spirit is all about it's a friendship that it's restored with the father even as Adam had that friendship in the beginning once again God restoring it and he told us through the prophet Joel I shall restore all that these worms that eaten I shall restore he's not going to restore a nation and make it great again that's not going to happen but he will restore you through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ you Jesus and give you the greatness that he gave to his son Christ in us the hope of glory the Seven Seals were preached on March 17th 1963 beginning with God in Simplicity it was 10 services in 8 Days March the 24th 1963 he preaches the seventh seal so from February the 28th 1963 to March the 24th 1963 is 25 days total so from Revelations 10:1 to Revelations 10:7 fulfilled in 25 days is anything too hard for the Lord the prophecy was in the books for a few thousand years and yet God can bring it to pass just like this the promise to you of a born again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been in the books for thousands of years and yet God can give it to you this morning just like that he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says and I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen I'll give you Revelation I'll make you grow to the stature of a perfect man but you've got to surrender you've got to give him your life as he gave his life for you so from Revelations 10:1 to Revelations 10:7 fulfilled in 25 days what has begun is the ministry of the sounding of the seventh angel the third pole Ministry continues to 1965 the revealing of the word until God takes his prophet in an automobile accident December the 24th 1965 and the message of the seventh angel is completed and if you can believe that you are the minority that's believing that that the message is completed and it is if there's something we lack is not for God to come back and finish it's for God to come back and finish the work in your life and mine is what's La in the message is this the sign of the answer brother B says the book that's written within is then completed when this Angel ceases even his passing away told us something the book that is written within is then completed when this Angel ceases now please understand this when the seventh Angel's message is completed understand when the message has been completed it's when he ceases when God takes him off the scene it's a finished work and we must trust in that finished word he says the book that is written within is then completed when this Angel ceases now please understand this when the seventh Angel's message is completed the godhead mystery the serpent seed mystery all the mysteries of all these things completed how do we know it's completed when the seventh angel ceases when God takes him off the scene then God is saying it is f finished it is finished and he lifted up his voice on the cross he said it is finished and he just lift up his voice again in this age and he said it is finished again the pattern of God's word in the message influence 1963 Prophet said I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place what was a prophet seeing what was a prophet pointing to us to Jesus Christ the son of God the great Holy Spirit listen to this what did John the Baptist do the man that Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time the great prophet ordained of God before the foundation of the world spoke of 127 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before he came to the Earth by the prophet Isaiah here what did he do when he seen a man come walking down to the audience and he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove he cried out I have need to be back baptize Of Thee I must decrease he must increase see God can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message you know and then he says I must decrease he is the messenger wow it's 1963 and the prophets already seeing an idolatrous Spirit rising up and he says I must decrease he is the messenger he says I've been up to this time now he takes my place as Elisha with Elijah went up and throwed back his robe to Elisha his ministry was finished Elisha must take up where he left off he must increase I must decrease he says John the Baptist then he says be conscious of your littleness because he's in the Pulpit being conscious of his littleness that's why he said be conscious of your littl know sometimes as ministers will say be conscious of your littleness and people might get offended but I can tell you from experience we're speaking because we're conscious of our own littleness also yeah be conscious of your littleness you're nothing or how I would like to dwell on that a few minutes but you're nothing in other words you're saying I'm nothing and I'm conscious of my littleness he said I must decrease he is the messenger it's 1963 and God's already revealed to him he needs to decrease so that Christ can increase in our lives I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place it's November the 30th 1963 and he's told us he's the messenger I've been up to this time up to this very moment of 1963 November the 30th I've been up to this time and maybe he's having a few regrets and wishing he would have brought Christ more to the people we all believe that way as ministers have I done enough have I said enough have I believed enough am I even worthy to stand before God's Blood Washed Saints to share and speak to them he said I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place I too must decrease for he that speaks to you this morning is that same messenger the great Holy Spirit God rich in Mercy for us after the Forerunner has left the scene who is the messenger follow the pattern the Holy Spirit Christ in his bride as he was in his prophet and what follows a ministerial change from a oneman Ministry to the fful ministry of a many membered body prophets been off the scene for many years Revelations 10 1-7 in 25 days but there's more to Revelations 10 then just verse 7 but when you realize that he decreased so that Christ could be born in us and that Christ would increase in our life we appreciate all God's prophets from Adam to a to William brandom to Paul to Peter all God's all God's prophets the Apostle Paul the price they paid to share the gospel imprisonment hungers beatings I haven't passed through any of those yet but the price these men paid the price William Brandon paid on his mind on his heart on his body body we have yet to pay those prices but we must be willing to pay that price the only way you'll be willing is if you've been born again otherwise you won't be willing and you won't be able you must be born again Revelations 108 is the ministry that will follow Revelations 10:7 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book from the seventh angel no it doesn't say that and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake to me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth a prophet came on the scene delivered the word of God and then the Bible reminds us for you to understand what was spoken and catch a revelation you you must go back and have a relationship with the original holder of this book almighty God himself you need an experience with Jesus Christ it didn't tell us go back to the seventh angel because he was just a vessel of clay that God used if you've ever witnessed to anybody and their life has been changed it's because they went to Christ it's because they received Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and believe it or not once you've done that they don't need me no more they got Jesus though we want to continue in a friendship they've got Jesus that'll see them through every hard trial that'll see you through every tribulation that'll keep your friendship together in unity revelation 10:8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel not the seventh angel the original holder of the Book of Revelations 51 said go and take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey Jesus said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me he said the same thing as was been spoken here at the first coming at the seeven second coming and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and Kings who would finally take this word into every corner of the Earth the mystical body of Jesus Christ would take this message to God's people to places where the the prophet could never be you say he went seven times around the world yes but he did that between 1946 and 1965 do the math what year is it today 2024 who's heard the message since then and who has spread it far and wide you and I with our neighbors at work wherever we get a chance to talk about Jesus and bring him on the scene Seven Seals is seven parts of one planed Redemption for the bride tree and the Fig Tree in the message Revelations 5 in 1961 brother the random says this almost speaking before time you might say and this seven sealed book of seven Redemption plans has been brought to us and that's what this book holds now we're going to get over into the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaims something that he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly it was bitter but his but in his lips it was sweet in other words when this word of God when you're baptized with his holy ghost when when Jes when when the Holy Spirit comes in and and awakens the soul from spiritual Amnesia you can't you can't go months and weeks and days without wanting to share it with someone it's something churning within you you've got to tell someone do you know Jesus lives do you know Jesus Christ is alive and well you know there's a revival going on they say Revival where I don't see no Revival right here it's happening right here this revival that's the prophecy of the book of the last few verses he says when this seven seal book of redemption plans has been brought to us and that's what this book holds now we're going to get over there in 10 the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaims something that he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet he couldn't hold it down it had to come up and every time he talked about Jesus he could taste the sweetness for himself again sometimes bitterness drops in because maybe we ain't talking about Jesus enough to taste the sweetness all over again like the day he first delivered us from sin like the day we were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ oh don't let the honeymoon end it can still will be sweet when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're a Holy Roller you're just this that or the other you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips that's all and when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to God hallelujah oh when you're going through that great Siege it's hard but when you're out but but when you're out of that great Siege you can testify it then it's sweet in the lips that's right that's this book of redemption and those are the refilling of his Spirit when he sees us through our trials God rich in Mercy what was to follow what are the days that we're living in Revelations 10 8 to 11 because Revelations 10 1 to 7 came to pass in 25 days though it sat in the books for thousands of years yet God unfolded it in 25 days and what we've been living today spoken of very little is Revelations 10 8 to 11 God call you that this book that was delivered to you come eat it take eat this is my flesh come drink this is my blood my new testament do you love him this morning God has been so good the book The Bible it's not as mysterious as it used to be and your privileged people this morning to know something that the great theologians of this world have no idea what God has done in this age because it's for a little flock it's for the mystical body of Jesus Christ

bit this is your [Music] house and this is your house our Holy House of Prayer where the Lord and the lonely bring their birs and yes this is your house this is your house come andw this is your house

house I am your [Music] high come and [Music] work let's just bow our heads this afternoon [Music] just like I said earlier right after the service we will Carri out a baptising right in the for there of one of our little sisters and uh we want to just appreciate the Lord the holy spirit for speaking to us this morning and re-echoing those things that are very necessary for us to know the time that we are living in and what God has done in our the Bible says uh the uh the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy every time the word is preached God has released the spirit of Prophecy over our life because just like it was in the beginning when the spirit of God begin to move over the Earth as he was moving over the Earth he was rolling over the Earth and is trying to get in contact with those seeds that he had placed in the earth and every time the word is preached sometimes it go over our heads sometimes just a little bit we understand about it but you see there is more there is more Supernatural to our dealings to the way that God is dealing with us the way he's bringing us to Faith the way he's bringing us to understanding the things that he's doing in our life there is more Supernatural to them than what we can understand that's the reason why Jesus says only believe all things are possible because there is more Supernatural to the things that God is doing in our life in our home if we would just only give him a chance he can change our life for the better he can break us away from [Music] Habits he can make us a different person he can make us a decent person whatever we are struggling with in our lives almighty God the creator of Heaven and Earth he can change us that's why we call him the almighty there is nothing [Music] impossible and that's what we want to believe for this [Music] morning whatever we are Desiring in our in our hearts even our our our desires for our children The Young Ones whatever they are going through if you could change it you will have changed it long time ago but we have to believe in the one that can change it just like our brother said this morning God is more interested in bringing us to a relationship then just bringing us to an organization just making a new church again just joining church God is more interested in bringing each and every one of us to a relationship I mean a deeper relationship where when we wake up in the morning he's the first one we speak to we go to him to get instruction and directive from him we open the word of God and say God speak to me order my steps seizing my words with with grace that I will not be overtaken and the Very and the Very tongue I used to bless you I used to curse he can change our life that's what that's that's the reason why that blood was shared that's the reason why that price was paid on Calvary that's the reason why the book was open that that's the reason why the seals were loose is to have a relationship amen yes Lord [Music] Jesus that's what I want this morning Lord prepared me to be a [Music] centuary pure and [Music] holy Tri and true oh with Thanksgiving I'll be all living [Music] sent you wor for you let's sing that

God with the spirit of reverence and and and worship it's not a it's not a d of thiefs but all we do is just money and money and money no we want to get closer to him we want to create an atmosphere
