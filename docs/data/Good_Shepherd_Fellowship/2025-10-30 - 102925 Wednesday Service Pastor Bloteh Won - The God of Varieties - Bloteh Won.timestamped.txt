[24:43] um
[24:47] a sister
[24:48] Mandy. She's been sick and not exactly
[24:52] know what is going on. So we just want

[25:04] there in Jamaica with with all of u the
[25:10] the high winds [music] and and uh almost
[25:14] like a tsunami they had the wind has

[25:20] Uh we all have properties and and uh
[25:24] livestock [music]
[25:26] challenges. Electricity is off on the on
[25:30] the the island wide and most roads are
[25:34] blocked by falling trees. In fact, most
[25:37] of our trees [music] are down

[26:09] thank the Lord for taking them through.
[26:12] Sometimes those words really do not
[26:15] express [music]
[26:17] uh you know the gravity of things that
[26:20] they experience but just to know that
[26:23] there is no uh uh death recorded among
[26:27] them and uh we just want to thank the
[26:30] Lord for that. Amen. And uh uh we just
[26:34] uh want to be grateful tonight and and
[26:39] uh uh
[26:42] let's just bow our hearts together and
[26:45] if we have uh any special need or spoken
[26:48] prayer requests, [music] we can just
[26:50] lift our hands or lift our hearts to the
[26:53] Lord and
[27:05] As we go to prayer tonight, I just want
[27:08] us to once again uh just appreciate the
[27:11] Lord for blessing us on the weekend.
[27:15] What a wonderful time of fellowship we
[27:17] had and uh blessing the the service in
[27:23] the evening.
[27:25] uh for the long time uh or for a little
[27:27] while. We had good uh uh numbers uh in
[27:32] the prayer meeting on Sunday evening in
[27:36] the communion service. That was uh good.
[27:39] That was encouraging. So we just wanted
[27:41] the Lord to just help us and
[27:45] and uh uh we just see how the Lord is
[27:49] just dealing dealing with us, dealing
[27:51] with his children and uh uh setting
[27:55] their life right according to the word
[27:58] and uh working out things around their
[28:01] life, around their family, different
[28:03] things happening. We just want to thank
[28:05] the Lord for his divine intervention.
[28:09] If you remember, I said a couple of
[28:10] weeks ago,
[28:12] uh, by the grace of God, he can help us
[28:14] to to lift this thing up. And we know
[28:18] that it's just the spirit of the Lord.
[28:21] Just the spirit of the Lord. when the
[28:23] people become uh earnest and and sincere
[28:27] and pour their heart before God,
[28:31] let's realize that this is the only
[28:33] opportunity we have in this life. And uh
[28:36] this is our time
[28:39] to write the book of Acts. This is our
[28:42] time
[28:43] to live for God. This is our time to
[28:46] serve God. We cannot put it up in the
[28:48] future. There is not a better time
[28:50] coming. This is the opportunity that we
[28:53] have every time that is given to us.
[28:55] Let's make the best use that we can.
[28:57] It's not just only coming to church but
[29:00] also our daily life, our family life,
[29:04] our time with our children, our time
[29:06] with our loved ones, talking to our
[29:09] parents. Let's make the best out of it.

[45:26] into this into the building, you know,
[45:29] Brother Brandon was closing that
[45:30] message, the church in his condition,
[45:32] you know, talking about the lamb, the
[45:35] dove coming on the lamb and and uh and
[45:38] he was in prayer and and it just created
[45:42] such an atmosphere
[45:44] uh that uh it kind of a blessed service.
[45:47] Amen. So, we thank the Lord for that.
[45:49] Revelation chapter 4, let's go back
[45:51] there. That was where we read on on
[45:54] Sunday
[45:56] and we just want to pick up and talk
[45:58] from there. Again, like I said, I'm I'm
[46:01] not a I'm not a teacher, but we're just
[46:04] we are just pick up picking up bit and
[46:07] pieces for us to be able to fellowship
[46:09] around. So, Revelation chapter 4, let's
[46:12] read from verse one. After this, after
[46:15] the church ages
[46:17] and uh after this I look and behold, a
[46:22] door was open in heaven. In Revelation
[46:25] chapter 3, the door was closed on earth.
[46:28] The church closed his door. God opened
[46:30] his door in heaven. Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. After this, I look and
[46:35] behold, a door was open in heaven. And
[46:38] the first voice I which I heard was as
[46:42] it were, the voice of a trumpet talking
[46:45] with me, which said, "Come up, hither,
[46:49] and I will show thee things which must
[46:53] be hereafter. And immediately
[46:57] I was in the spirit, and behold, a
[47:00] throne was set in heaven, and one sat on
[47:05] the throne.
[47:07] And he that sat was told looked upon
[47:12] like a jasper, and sat in stone,
[47:17] and there was a rainbow
[47:20] around about the throne. So it was a
[47:23] fullness of a of of of a rainbow. Amen.
[47:27] It was a fullness. It was not half a
[47:29] board this time. It was a complete
[47:32] because it was round about round about
[47:35] the throne in the uh in sight like onto
[47:40] an emerald. And around about the throne
[47:44] were four and 20 seats.
[47:49] And uh upon the seats
[47:53] I saw four
[47:55] and 20 elders sitting
[47:58] clothed in white ramen and they had on
[48:03] their head
[48:05] crowns of gold. I was listening to
[48:07] revelation chapter 4 today brother
[48:09] Brandon said it cannot be angels because
[48:11] angels are not promised crown. Amen. So
[48:15] this have to be rewards of uh of of
[48:17] humans that he says it cannot be angels
[48:21] because angels were not promised crowns.
[48:24] And out of the throne proceed lightning
[48:27] and thunder
[48:30] uh and thundering and and voices and
[48:33] there were seven seven lamps of fire
[48:36] burning before the throne which are the
[48:40] seven spirits of God. Back to the
[48:42] subject of the seven spirits. Let's pray
[48:45] together. Heavenly Father, in the name
[48:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we just want
[48:50] to thank you again that we have another
[48:52] opportunity to be in your house, Lord,
[48:55] to be in your presence tonight. Bless
[48:57] the effort of your children after a busy
[49:00] day, Lord. Father and uh the children
[49:04] going to school and and and Father Lord
[49:07] and and who make it together tonight,
[49:10] Lord. Father, especially Lord God, these
[49:13] these little ones that come Wednesday
[49:15] night and then uh Thursday, they have
[49:18] school. We want to just ask special
[49:20] blessing upon them. Father, Lord God, uh
[49:24] uh it will go before them for many days.
[49:26] Lord Jesus we pray that Lord you will
[49:29] bless your word now to our heart in
[49:31] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Praise the
[49:35] Lord. Hallelujah.
[49:37] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[49:39] seat.
[49:42] Going to speak a little bit tonight on
[49:43] the God of varieties.
[49:47] The God of varieties.
[49:50] Amen.
[49:57] But it's it's it's all part of uh the
[50:00] subject of the seven spirits that we
[50:02] we've been talking about. And uh uh I
[50:06] want to read uh Matthew chapter 19 verse
[50:10] 27. Matthew 19:27.
[50:14] Matthew 19:27.
[50:20] I had a prophet referring to that today
[50:24] and uh and it was uh I want to share
[50:28] that's when he's talking about
[50:32] uh
[50:35] crowns are not promised to angels.
[50:37] Matthew 19:27
[50:40] the Bible says then answered Peter and
[50:43] said unto him Jesus behold we have
[50:46] forsaken all and follow thee what shall
[50:51] we have therefore praise the Lord do you
[50:55] feel like that sometimes
[50:57] &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord
[51:00] &gt;&gt; that what is the benefit of this thing
[51:03] &gt;&gt; what is the benefit you know uh uh uh I
[51:06] mean We could we could we could dash
[51:09] into the pleasure of life and just have
[51:12] pleasure. And uh uh and yet uh uh it
[51:18] seems strange,
[51:20] you know. Uh sometimes I think about if
[51:23] God would just allow us and says, "Well,
[51:26] okay, today just for one day do whatever
[51:30] you want to do." I wonder what are some
[51:33] of the things that we would do.
[51:36] Praise the Lord. I wonder what are some
[51:38] of the things that we want to do that we
[51:40] would just do for that one thing. I pray
[51:43] that uh
[51:45] uh there be no desire in us to do wrong.
[51:48] Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even if the even if the
[51:52] opportunity was given, I pray that there
[51:55] is no desire in us
[51:57] &gt;&gt; to do wrong. Praise the Lord. Because
[52:00] after you come back to your senses,
[52:02] you're going to regret it.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And so uh uh behold, we have forsaken
[52:12] all and followed thee. What shall we
[52:15] have? Therefore, and Jesus said unto
[52:18] them, verily I say unto you, that ye
[52:22] which have follow me in the generation
[52:25] of the son of man
[52:29] shall sit in the throne of his glory.
[52:35] Ye shall also sit upon 12 thrones. So,
[52:39] so you see there in Revelation chapter
[52:42] 4. Now the reason why I'm saying this is
[52:45] because uh in the seals when brother
[52:48] Brandham said John saw John
[52:52] he saw his his name on the book of life
[52:55] or he saw himself when the seals were
[52:58] open. It was not uh uh uh it was not
[53:03] sometimes it it sounds uh very uh uh
[53:08] mysterious to us. But you realize that
[53:12] uh uh brother Brandon never make up
[53:15] things.
[53:17] He never make up things as a prophet. He
[53:20] sent he was his his ministry was to help
[53:23] us to understand the word. Here is Jesus
[53:26] giving the disciples and John was part
[53:30] of these disciples and Jesus is telling
[53:33] them you people that have forsaken the
[53:36] synagogues, the Sanhindrance council and
[53:38] all to follow me. This is this will be
[53:41] your reward. I will give you 12 thrones.
[53:43] Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And uh and he says here also shall sit
[53:50] upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[53:53] Israel. And here is John now caught up
[53:56] in the spirit. And he seen that
[53:59] representation
[54:01] before before the throne.
[54:04] That was what brother Brandon was
[54:06] referring to when he said John saw John.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Because your name in the book of life is
[54:14] not John Davis. It's not blotted one.
[54:17] That's not your name. It's is it's a
[54:20] revelation. It's a representation.
[54:23] So when that when that representation
[54:26] becomes so real to you,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Then you can say my name is in the book.
[54:33] Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; You can say I saw my name in the book.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; So Jesus here is giving John this
[54:44] promise that that or giving his disciple
[54:47] this promise uh and here shall sit upon
[54:50] 12 throne judging the 12 tribes of
[54:52] Israel and uh and everyone that have
[54:56] forsaken houses, brethren, sisters,
[54:59] father, mother, wives, children or land
[55:04] for my name's sake shall receive a
[55:06] hundfold and shall and shall inherit
[55:09] very everlasting life. Praise the Lord.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So year uh uh over year now John
[55:18] is now getting a true understanding of
[55:22] the things that Jesus said to them while
[55:25] he was with them in in his earthly
[55:27] ministry. Praise the Lord.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So it is that understanding that that
[55:32] that that makes it real to John. And I
[55:36] think that's what brother Brandham was
[55:37] referring to when he said John saw his
[55:41] name on the book. Amen. Or John saw John
[55:45] because he's represented in the 12 in
[55:48] the 24s which is the 12 apostles and the
[55:53] 12 patriots. Are we together?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, uh, I I just wanted
[55:58] to to bring that one also as we uh as we
[56:04] as we continue in in our our fellowship
[56:07] around um
[56:10] around the throne. Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord as we continue in our
[56:16] fellowship around the throne. So, so uh
[56:18] uh tonight uh uh looking at this uh uh
[56:22] and and and and talking about the 12
[56:24] spirits. I not 12 spirits, seven
[56:27] spirits. Uh I I thought that uh we
[56:32] should look at something a little bit
[56:33] here [clears throat]
[56:35] because uh uh uh God is one
[56:42] and his spirit is one.
[56:46] So we want to see the sense of this
[56:50] seven spirit. Why the Bible say the
[56:52] seven spirit of God? We want to look at
[56:55] it a little bit and uh and one of the
[56:57] the simplest way I think I can bring it
[57:00] tonight is to look at the God of
[57:02] varieties. Amen. For us to look at the
[57:06] God of varieties. So let's let's just uh
[57:08] let's just jump right in there. Now
[57:12] another thing here that we want to we we
[57:14] want to look at here is that and there
[57:17] was a rainbow around the throne. Now we
[57:20] know the first time uh the Bible would
[57:22] talk about a rainbow was what God gave
[57:25] to Noah. Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; God gave him therefore a sign.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible says God gave him a board. So
[57:33] it was just like a board. Praise the
[57:36] Lord.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; God was the first one that handle bow
[57:39] and arrow. Amen. He was the first one
[57:42] that handle bow and arrow. So he gave
[57:45] Noah aboard in the heavens and of of of
[57:49] these of of this rainbow. And we know
[57:52] that the rainbow is made out of seven
[57:55] colors.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Seven colors. Now, so God is
[58:03] representing in the heavens uh uh and
[58:06] making a covenant with the earth that
[58:10] he's not going to destroy the earth like
[58:13] this anymore. Praise the Lord.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to destroy the
[58:18] earth and destroy the life of everybody
[58:21] on the earth. No. God will send
[58:24] judgment. He will send plague. We will
[58:26] be right here. Some people will die and
[58:28] some people will survive.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Like uh like all of these uh flaws and
[58:35] things that is taking place, it takes
[58:36] some people life and yet some people
[58:39] stays right here. Praise the Lord.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Which of course in the days of Noah when
[58:44] the flood came, it swept EVERY LIFE that
[58:47] was not in the ark.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; God say it's not going to happen again.
[58:52] No matter what amount of flaw that comes
[58:54] upon the earth, it will destroy life.
[58:57] But some people will survive.
[59:01] Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So, he should have board in the heavens
[59:04] and uh and and and then he made a
[59:06] covenant with the earth that he's not
[59:08] going he's not going to just take the
[59:11] life of every everyone on the earth
[59:13] anymore in the flood. If he ever destroy
[59:16] the word and take the life of everyone,
[59:18] it's not going to be a flaw. Is going to
[59:20] be a fire. And when he and when he do
[59:23] that, uh uh when that happen, then he's
[59:26] just going to just, you know, make a new
[59:29] heaven and a new earth and start
[59:32] everything brand new. Close the page of
[59:35] sin and sickness and just get rid of
[59:38] this devil. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And then just stay with heed and his and
[59:43] his subjects. Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He and his attributes.
[59:47] So that was the first time that God uh
[59:50] shoot rainbow in the heaven. Now brother
[59:52] Brandham said if we see yet in
[59:55] revelation that there was a rainbow that
[59:58] was around the throne it was a complete
[1:00:02] cycle. It was in a complete cycle. So if
[1:00:05] we look back to Genesis and see that
[1:00:08] there was a half of a rainbow. Brother
[1:00:11] Brandon make us to know that in that
[1:00:14] half of the rainbow, God also gave us a
[1:00:17] message.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; That there is half of the story of
[1:00:22] redemption that is not told.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness is kept before the
[1:00:29] throne. There are a lot of things that
[1:00:32] we will never understand in this life.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some of the why does
[1:00:39] not have an answer.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; The answer will be given to you before
[1:00:44] the throne.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's before the throne that we have a
[1:00:48] complete rainbow. In this life, we will
[1:00:51] always have partial understanding.
[1:00:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; We will always have partial
[1:00:58] understanding of things that we deal
[1:01:00] with and things and and why this is
[1:01:02] happening and why that is happening. We
[1:01:05] you will never get the complete
[1:01:06] understanding because almighty God has
[1:01:09] choose to keep it to himself.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You will get to know it when you get on
[1:01:17] the other side.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you will never be
[1:01:21] disappointed.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; When you get on the other side and get
[1:01:26] to know the fullness of the you will
[1:01:28] say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew that. I wouldn't have been
[1:01:34] frustrated as I was.
[1:01:37] Praise the Lord. You will not be
[1:01:39] disappointed. I promise you when you get
[1:01:41] to know the fullness of everything. So,
[1:01:45] brother Brandham says h it was also a
[1:01:48] sign when God shoot that that rainbow in
[1:01:51] the heavens. It was a sign to tell his
[1:01:54] redeeming children that their the part
[1:01:56] of the story of our redemption on this
[1:01:59] earth is kept to God alone. Amen. So we
[1:02:02] see around the throne there was a
[1:02:06] complete rainbow, a complete cycle, a
[1:02:08] rainbow. There was a rainbow round about
[1:02:12] the throne. Amen. So we want to look at
[1:02:15] that a little bit. And it was there for
[1:02:17] a sign. So that's what we want to look
[1:02:19] at tonight as we look at uh uh this uh
[1:02:25] uh god of varieties. I I title it
[1:02:28] tonight god of varieties. And uh let's
[1:02:30] let's read this first thing brother Ben
[1:02:32] Brand says here in Revelation chapter 6
[1:02:34] as we start off with this whole thing.
[1:02:36] He says this great forerunner has gone
[1:02:40] before us making the way. He he become
[1:02:45] from spirit
[1:02:47] the great fountain of the rainbow of God
[1:02:53] who had no beginning or no end. He was
[1:02:57] forever
[1:02:59] through the seven perfect colors which
[1:03:03] is the seven spirit of God. Now that's
[1:03:07] what I want for us to look at this
[1:03:09] thought of the God of variety
[1:03:12] that this seven perfect colors the
[1:03:14] reason why the Bible is saying h God has
[1:03:20] seven spirits
[1:03:22] is is is shown out here in in in the
[1:03:25] book of revelation. It is the the seven
[1:03:28] spirit represent God's attributes.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just think about it. On the day of
[1:03:37] Pentecost, it was the one Holy Spirit,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That came down on the day of Pentecost.
[1:03:45] But God broke it into 120.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says on the head of each
[1:03:53] of the 120 there was something little
[1:03:56] pillar of fire was hanging fire like
[1:03:59] tongue. It was just in a little shape.
[1:04:03] You see how the fire can be on on the
[1:04:06] candle just like a tongue
[1:04:08] was sitting on the head. So God broke
[1:04:10] himself out into
[1:04:14] 120. The Bible gave us a sense of that.
[1:04:18] One time Jethro advised Moses and said
[1:04:21] Moses look you're going to kill
[1:04:23] yourself. You are doing too much. You
[1:04:26] are having men among you. called those
[1:04:29] men that so they can take care of the
[1:04:32] you know the affairs of the people. So
[1:04:34] Moses gathered the men and the Bible
[1:04:37] says he and and the Bible will say it
[1:04:39] this way that uh the spirit of Moses
[1:04:42] came upon the people. It was not the
[1:04:45] spirit of Moses. It was a spirit of
[1:04:47] leadership.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God took that spirit of
[1:04:52] leadership that Moses had and he broke
[1:04:55] it among those men so they can be able
[1:04:58] to help Moses in the work of God. And I
[1:05:02] believe that's where Peter took that
[1:05:04] inspiration from in the book of Acts
[1:05:07] when he says choose men among you that
[1:05:10] will be able to take care of your
[1:05:12] affairs. Let them be men filled of the
[1:05:14] Holy Ghost. So it's the same thing.
[1:05:17] Praise the Lord. The same Holy Ghost
[1:05:19] that the preacher have is the same Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost that the deacon has. It's the same
[1:05:23] Holy Ghost that the musician have. The
[1:05:25] same Holy Ghost the brothers and sister
[1:05:27] have. It just that is a God of variety.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It will not do the same work in every
[1:05:33] one of us. Everybody will have their
[1:05:36] unique place in the body.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He's the God of variety.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; The preacher preaching do not have a a a
[1:05:46] greater Holy Ghost than the people. You
[1:05:49] see that's the reason why you look
[1:05:51] sometime there in the prayer line.
[1:05:52] Brother Brandon was says that uh uh uh
[1:05:55] uh he he will say Satan the church of
[1:05:58] the living God come against you. Why is
[1:06:01] he saying that is because uh uh no one
[1:06:05] person has a 100% of faith.
[1:06:09] No, I might have two, you might have h
[1:06:14] five, another person will have three. Is
[1:06:17] when we bring our faith together.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Even when WE BRING ALL OUR FAITH
[1:06:23] TOGETHER, WE WILL NEVER HAVE 100%. God
[1:06:27] will have to come and fill it up.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He will have to come and complete it.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even when WE BRING OUR
[1:06:35] FAITH TOGETHER AND IT'S JUST 5%.
[1:06:38] Let's wait on him.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; When he come in our maze, he will bring
[1:06:42] the 75%. And it becomes 100%.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he said where two or
[1:06:52] three I gather in my name, I will be
[1:06:55] there.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; So he he brings the completion.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Let's bring our little fire.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; LET'S START THE FIRE. AMEN. He will come
[1:07:06] and just bring the wind and just blaze
[1:07:09] everything up.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; That's how I felt on Sunday. Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I felt like he just came and just took
[1:07:15] up our little faith.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; So, he's the God of variety. He is our
[1:07:23] completion. We are complete in him.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; We are complete in him.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] So there's there just no competition in
[1:07:41] this sink.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; There is no competition. The Bible talks
[1:07:46] about the measure of faith that we have
[1:07:48] the measure of grace. So it's by
[1:07:51] measurement.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But no one has complete. No, no. We need
[1:07:58] him.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; We need him to come. So we see here that
[1:08:03] uh he's talking about this great
[1:08:05] fountain of the rainbow of God who had
[1:08:09] no beginning no end through the seven
[1:08:12] perfect colors which is the seven spirit
[1:08:16] of God
[1:08:18] which went from that great fountain or
[1:08:23] that great diamond.
[1:08:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] That great diamond that Jesus spoke of,
[1:08:32] the great diamond
[1:08:34] was checked to reflect this color. God
[1:08:40] was made flesh and dwared among us that
[1:08:44] he might reflect his goodness and his
[1:08:47] mercy among us by gifts, signs, and
[1:08:52] wonders
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; is God's goodness
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; and mercy. Amen.
[1:08:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That God that was the great internal
[1:09:03] spirit that was dwelling by himself,
[1:09:08] he had to condense himself. He has to
[1:09:11] come down and break himself for us to
[1:09:15] really know him.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why sometimes God
[1:09:23] take us through things. It looks like
[1:09:27] God is breaking us when we are going
[1:09:30] through things. But he's breaking
[1:09:32] himself
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; and we are we are feeling the effect
[1:09:37] because the effect is to MAKE US TO KNOW
[1:09:40] him through the trials that we are going
[1:09:43] through.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; It's just like when he came upon the
[1:09:51] mountain, the mountain shook. So if GOD
[1:09:55] COMES UPON YOU to reveal himself to you,
[1:09:58] you going to shake.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AND AND THAT SHAKING
[1:10:04] that you go through becomes like trial.
[1:10:07] It looks your body DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
[1:10:09] YOUR MIND don't understand it. And then
[1:10:12] and sometimes it throw you in a place of
[1:10:14] sorrow. AND YOU FEEL LIKE WHY AM I GOING
[1:10:16] through this? But it's God revealing
[1:10:19] himself to you.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Is God revealing himself to you? Praise
[1:10:30] the Lord.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; So, he's the he's he's just like that
[1:10:34] great diamond that was chipped to
[1:10:37] reflect these colors. God was made flesh
[1:10:40] among us that he might reflect his
[1:10:43] goodness and his mercy among us by gift
[1:10:47] signs and wonders. Are we together?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] Let's let's drop down. Let's take the
[1:10:54] one on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:57] and see what he says here. Then he says
[1:11:00] u you see there is seven spirits of God
[1:11:06] just like the seven colors of the
[1:11:09] rainbow.
[1:11:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; These seven colors is all coming from
[1:11:16] one color.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; The seven spirit is coming from one
[1:11:24] spirit.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say God is spirits.
[1:11:29] [snorts]
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:11:33] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:11:36] truth.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Now, so let's go a little bit here.
[1:11:41] There's the seven spirits of God just
[1:11:44] like the seven colors in the rainbow.
[1:11:46] And did you ever notice
[1:11:49] a three corner piece of glass
[1:11:53] reflects seven perfect color?
[1:11:57] Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Benham is teaching us
[1:12:02] something here. You can you can you can
[1:12:04] take it. You can you can try it. He's
[1:12:06] telling you you can try it. Take take a
[1:12:08] glass. One glass that that has that has
[1:12:12] three three colors. I mean I mean three
[1:12:15] corners
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; you look right in between it you will
[1:12:18] see a mixture of colors
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; that is formed right in between you
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; is because of reflection
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; now so uh h a three corner piece of
[1:12:32] glass reflects seven perfect color. Did
[1:12:35] you ever try that? See see so you go and
[1:12:38] try it. see a three corner piece of
[1:12:41] glass yet
[1:12:43] it's only one piece of glass. It's one
[1:12:47] piece of glass but because it have three
[1:12:50] corners.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is it is the light that is
[1:12:57] that is pressing its way trying to find
[1:13:02] its way in the in in the midst of the
[1:13:04] three corner
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; that is that is reflecting the light
[1:13:09] that is reflecting that seven colors
[1:13:13] is light that is trying to find its way
[1:13:16] through there. Praise the Lord. that you
[1:13:19] ever try set
[1:13:21] set a three corner piece of glass yet
[1:13:24] it's only one piece of glass but in
[1:13:28] three corner will reflect seven colors
[1:13:33] that's how father son and holy spirit
[1:13:37] being one yet reflect the seven
[1:13:41] spiritual attributes.
[1:13:44] Amen. So it is it is not uh it is not uh
[1:13:49] uh uh uh seven spirit uh seven you know
[1:13:53] uh individual spirits these are God's
[1:13:56] attributes.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; These are God's attribute just like we
[1:14:01] read from uh Isaiah chapter 11 uh uh uh
[1:14:06] if if we just want to look there again.
[1:14:08] We read that was that on Sunday? I can
[1:14:11] remember. [clears throat]
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] But uh
[1:14:19] [clears throat]
[1:14:20] you love the Lord.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 11, we read that
[1:14:25] verse one. There shall come forth a rod
[1:14:27] out of the steam of Jesse, and the
[1:14:29] branch shall grow out of his roof. The
[1:14:33] spirit of the Lord, the spirit of the
[1:14:36] Lord coming down. Amen. That one spirit
[1:14:41] is going to break out into this.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to break out. The spirit of
[1:14:46] the Lord is going to be the spirit of
[1:14:48] wisdom. Is going to be the spirit of
[1:14:51] understanding. It's going to be the
[1:14:53] spirit of counsel and might. It's going
[1:14:56] to be the spirit of knowledge. And it's
[1:14:59] also going to be the spirit of what? The
[1:15:01] fear of the Lord.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So we see seven spirits right there.
[1:15:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So is one spirit breaking itself out
[1:15:16] into seven colors.
[1:15:18] Are we together?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Seven varieties [snorts]
[1:15:22] now. So uh uh if uh if uh if uh if our
[1:15:27] people there want to put out my first
[1:15:29] picture, if he ever made it true.
[1:15:32] Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] So yeah, this is this is an example of
[1:15:37] it. So it's white light coming through
[1:15:41] there. Praise the Lord. I still have my
[1:15:43] point again. Amen. White light coming
[1:15:46] through three. So this this is a three
[1:15:50] corner glass.
[1:15:52] Okay. Three corner glass. There is one
[1:15:55] corner on this side. This is one corner.
[1:15:57] This is another corner. So a white light
[1:16:00] coming through forcing its way through
[1:16:03] here will always present three seven
[1:16:07] colors.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; SO IS GOD ALMIGHTY God condensing
[1:16:17] himself to come down and become man
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; for us to be able to understand him. We
[1:16:24] cannot understand him in his greatness.
[1:16:28] He had to break himself
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; and we will experience him through
[1:16:32] provision, through healing, through
[1:16:35] comfort, through strength. So he's
[1:16:37] breaking himself so we can be able to
[1:16:40] understand him.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why we go through
[1:16:45] trials. So it's almost like u uh uh this
[1:16:49] this three corner represent you and
[1:16:52] myself.
[1:16:54] Soul, body, spirit.
[1:16:57] So when we experience the effect of God
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; which is the puress of light
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; when we experience him
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; then it brings us into multiple
[1:17:11] experience. [snorts]
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; We go through multiple trials. We go
[1:17:17] through multiple rejoicing. We go
[1:17:19] through different things.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; It's the God of variety.
[1:17:25] That is the way that God choose to
[1:17:27] express himself to us.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Now, so you will you will see here that
[1:17:35] trinity
[1:17:37] is devilish when you apply it to God.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; No, because he's one
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; manifesting himself IN THREE. BUT GOD
[1:17:50] WORKS through trinity
[1:17:53] and THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE make us so
[1:17:56] body spirit.
[1:17:58] That's the reason why he become father,
[1:18:01] son, holy ghost. HE WORK IS A CHANNEL HE
[1:18:04] WORKS THROUGH. THAT IS THE WAY HE CAN
[1:18:06] EXPRESS HIMSELF.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; If he remain A SPIRIT GOD, WE WILL NOT
[1:18:13] UNDERSTAND HIM.
[1:18:15] If he only remained a spirit god,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; we would have never understood him.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO BE BORN.
[1:18:25] He had to express himself and come in
[1:18:28] our form.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; EVEN WITH THAT, WE WILL STILL NOT
[1:18:32] UNDERSTAND HIM.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; SO THEN HE HAD TO NOW COME AND DWELL IN
[1:18:37] US.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; SO WE CAN LOOK BACK TO THE TIME HE WAS
[1:18:43] SPIRIT. WE CAN LOOK TO THE TIME he was
[1:18:45] flesh
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and we can now understand what he's
[1:18:48] doing in us.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; IF YOU NEVER HAD NO EXAMPLE OF GOD BEING
[1:18:56] IN FLESH, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT
[1:18:58] HE'S DOING IN YOU.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] SO THAT'S HOW THE SEVEN THAT'S THAT IS
[1:19:11] THE THOUGHT THAT is behind the seven
[1:19:13] spirit.
[1:19:16] It's the attribute of God is God making
[1:19:20] himself simple for us to understand.
[1:19:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; He's making himself He's making himself
[1:19:29] tangible.
[1:19:31] He's making himself visible.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now give give us the next picture.
[1:19:43] So yeah there there we see again the
[1:19:45] seven colors it came through the
[1:19:49] threesided
[1:19:51] parameail and now is becoming
[1:19:55] the very thing that came through us is
[1:19:58] now becoming us.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] Are we together?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS PARAMED REPRESENT the
[1:20:09] church ages. It also represent the
[1:20:12] believer.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; In the church ages, we can say Ephesus
[1:20:20] uh uh seminar Philadelphia. We can go
[1:20:23] through the church ages. We can take the
[1:20:26] seven spirit and and represent it with
[1:20:28] each of the seven messengers.
[1:20:32] WE CAN ALSO TAKE IT BACK TO PETER and
[1:20:35] says uh ADD TO YOUR FAITH VIRTUE and to
[1:20:38] virtue knowledge
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; that is to the individual.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Am I confusing you?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Am I going too fast?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; So we see the same light. THAT'S WHY
[1:20:57] BROTHER BRANDHAM CALL him the the the
[1:20:59] the fountain of God. that pure fountain
[1:21:02] of God.
[1:21:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take for example here. Let me give
[1:21:08] you another example as we go on here.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; If I gave you another example,
[1:21:18] uh Jacob had a son, Joseph.
[1:21:24] Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And for the love of Joseph, the love for
[1:21:30] this boy because of the love that he
[1:21:33] have for Richard.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So when when Joseph was born,
[1:21:38] he treated him a little bit special.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] and and AND WITH THAT SPECIAL LOVE THAT
[1:21:47] HE HAD FOR JOSEPH, we see that the he he
[1:21:51] he got this inspiration and he was able
[1:21:54] to sow him
[1:21:59] a coat of many colors,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; which of course that coat of many colors
[1:22:07] turned out to be a sign of the rainbow.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:14] Jo Jacob was not thinking about God gave
[1:22:17] Noah a sign of the rainbow. Let me give
[1:22:20] uh uh Joseph uh uh seven colors. No, he
[1:22:25] was expressing his love to his son.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; But now it's going to be a lesson for
[1:22:31] you and myself.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:37] THE DAY THAT JOSEPH WILL COME out with
[1:22:40] this coat in the morning to show his
[1:22:44] brothers.
[1:22:46] Let me wear mine. It's not seven colors,
[1:22:48] but
[1:22:50] Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I I should have looked for the seven
[1:22:53] color preaching this. I never thought
[1:22:55] about it. But he came out showing his
[1:22:58] brothers and you know trying to show to
[1:23:00] them that very day
[1:23:04] will cause trouble for him.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; THAT THING will will raise A SENSE OF
[1:23:14] JEALOUSY in his brothers.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what THEY WERE DOING.
[1:23:18] HE NEVER KNEW WHAT he was doing. ARE WE
[1:23:22] TOGETHER? BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT
[1:23:25] an attribute of God, a thought of God
[1:23:28] was going to be expressed.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; So just like I said, IS GOD TRYING TO
[1:23:41] EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH YOU? Like
[1:23:43] brother Brandham said, in Christ is the
[1:23:45] mystery of God revealed. I never thought
[1:23:47] about that, but I will have I put that
[1:23:49] quote and read it to you tonight, but we
[1:23:51] know it. He says he says uh uh uh uh he
[1:23:54] says why are you going through these
[1:23:56] things?
[1:23:59] He said it is the father that is trying
[1:24:02] to express himself through you but you
[1:24:05] allow your husband, you allow your wife,
[1:24:07] you allow your children to handle it. So
[1:24:10] it's the SAME THING WHEN GOD IS
[1:24:12] EXPRESSING HIMSELF. You see that is the
[1:24:15] reason why Peter will tell us that if
[1:24:18] you don't go through trial then you are
[1:24:21] a bastard child. You are an illegitimate
[1:24:24] CHILD BECAUSE EVERY CHILD OF GOD GOES
[1:24:27] through one thing OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT
[1:24:30] IS THE FATHER'S WILL that how God can
[1:24:33] make himself known to you.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; God don't make himself known to you
[1:24:37] intellectually.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; He make himself KNOWN TO YOU BY
[1:24:41] EXPERIENCE. AMEN.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; By the things you go through.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And then WHEN YOU COME OUT OF FAITH, YOU
[1:24:47] CAN SAY, I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVETH.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH MY SKIN WARM, MY BODY, BUT I
[1:24:55] KNOW I WILL SEE GOD NO MATTER WHAT I GO
[1:24:58] THROUGH
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT BECOMES SO REAL TO YOU.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; WHY OTHER PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT?
[1:25:05] BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH IT. So
[1:25:07] God hate them.
[1:25:09] BUT YOU AT A CERTAIN PER AT A CERTAIN
[1:25:11] POINT OF TIME IT WILL BECOME SO REAL TO
[1:25:14] YOU.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; IT IS THAT WHITE LIGHT PRESSING HIMSELF
[1:25:20] through your soul, body and spirit.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Should I send you home now?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Did you understand everything?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you understand it,
[1:25:36] then I don't need to preach again.
[1:25:40] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] Let's take another call here. Revelation
[1:25:48] chapter 7. [snorts]
[1:25:50] [clears throat]
[1:25:51] God is beautiful. Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[1:25:56] It's beautiful.
[1:25:58] God is so good.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; God is so good. That's that's that's the
[1:26:04] reason why uh uh uh the scripture which
[1:26:07] says uh you know uh uh rejoice in your
[1:26:10] trial is hard for us to nobody really
[1:26:13] rejoice in their trial.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody really rejoice in your trial. The
[1:26:19] reason is because our human mind cannot
[1:26:22] process it that this is God goodness to
[1:26:25] us.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; The human mind can never process it.
[1:26:30] the human mind when it fell when Adam
[1:26:34] fell
[1:26:36] maybe he fell on his head. [laughter]
[1:26:39] Praise the Lord. I don't think he fell
[1:26:42] on his head. I don't know whether it was
[1:26:43] forward or backward but when he woke up
[1:26:47] his brain was not working well.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN MAN FELL HE LOST SOMETHING.
[1:26:57] He lost something that it is so easy for
[1:27:01] him to think negative than positive.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's so easy.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Negative thing just come so easy. We
[1:27:10] don't even we don't even try for it. It
[1:27:11] just comes.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Revelation chapter 7.
[1:27:19] Let's take this one and then we can
[1:27:21] bring this to close tonight. See Abraham
[1:27:23] says here he says and in there we find
[1:27:26] out that he has seven varieties of
[1:27:31] spirit. I just changed my subject right
[1:27:33] in the office there when I when I was
[1:27:35] reading this. I was thinking how what
[1:27:37] should I name this tonight? Okay. The
[1:27:39] God of varieties. He says in there we
[1:27:42] find out that he has seven variety of
[1:27:45] spirit. Is that right? The Bible said in
[1:27:48] Revelation that there's seven spirit
[1:27:51] before the throne of God. Praise the
[1:27:54] Lord.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to our first image.
[1:28:01] The seven spirit before the throne of
[1:28:04] God.
[1:28:05] What it means that God from his throne
[1:28:09] expressing himself to mankind,
[1:28:13] he will have to come through a three
[1:28:18] h a he will come through a a a prison.
[1:28:23] Amen. a a a three-sided
[1:28:28] being whether he will come as father,
[1:28:30] son or holy ghost or he will be dealing
[1:28:32] with man that is soul, body and spirit.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; So he's the god of varieties.
[1:28:43] That's the reason why God God is not
[1:28:46] playing the racist game to make us
[1:28:48] different.
[1:28:50] He gave us different shades in the color
[1:28:53] of our skin, different heights,
[1:28:55] different weight. He's the God of
[1:28:57] variety. He enjoy it like that.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And join God to enjoy the way he made
[1:29:02] you.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; It's just the devil that is playing
[1:29:09] politics with our lives.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; So is God from his throne expressing
[1:29:15] himself, condescending
[1:29:20] Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. Tonight, let's go back
[1:29:27] to our our court here.
[1:29:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And in there, we find out that HE HAS
[1:29:36] SEVEN VARIETY of spirit. Is that right?
[1:29:39] The Bible said in revelation that the
[1:29:43] seven spirit
[1:29:46] before the throne of God, the seven
[1:29:50] manifold, seven manifestation, seven
[1:29:54] expression.
[1:29:57] Are we together?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:01] Some some people uh h think that the
[1:30:04] seven spirit is just only subject to the
[1:30:07] seven messenger of the seven church
[1:30:09] ages. No, we we we we saw that in in
[1:30:13] brother Ben is something from the old
[1:30:15] testament.
[1:30:19] Are we together? Amen.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; So, uh uh uh uh and just like I said, it
[1:30:28] was because
[1:30:30] the blood has not atone because there
[1:30:33] was not a perfect atunement. Without a
[1:30:36] perfect atonement, we can never had a
[1:30:38] perfect understanding.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] Just like Paul will say
[1:30:49] without Without the perfect atonement of
[1:30:51] the blood, we will have never have
[1:30:53] perfect understanding. So all of those
[1:30:55] things were back there in the Old
[1:30:56] Testament. But it took the perfect
[1:30:59] atonement of Jesus Christ blood to bring
[1:31:01] us a a clearer understanding.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Because if you look you look you look at
[1:31:13] at the prism the first the first the
[1:31:16] first color is the color of red.
[1:31:20] Amen. That's the first color, the color
[1:31:23] of red representing redemption.
[1:31:27] Though your sin be as scarlet.
[1:31:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Put put that our picture up back again.
[1:31:38] [clears throat]
[1:31:40] Amen.
[1:31:42] Now when brother Brandham in the
[1:31:44] brereech when he talks about the bleach.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He says the bleach if you put a bleach
[1:31:53] on all of these color it will break it
[1:31:55] down and send it back to white.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] If you put a bleach on all of these
[1:32:08] color, it will break them down and send
[1:32:10] them right back to white
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; because that's where they came from.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; So in another sense, God is saying even
[1:32:25] though your sin be as scal
[1:32:29] praise the Lord,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; you will go back to white.
[1:32:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because white is your original
[1:32:41] color.
[1:32:43] White is your original expression.
[1:32:49] Are we together?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That white means puress. That's what it
[1:32:57] means. It means puress. It does not mean
[1:33:00] your your white paint.
[1:33:04] That's why he says you from the the
[1:33:06] fountain of puress. He talks about love.
[1:33:10] He says he says the love of God he says
[1:33:12] what we what we have on earth and we are
[1:33:14] experiencing he said is so perverted
[1:33:18] is so diluted.
[1:33:21] He says the pure fountain of God when it
[1:33:25] came down
[1:33:27] it it started becoming corrupted
[1:33:30] that somebody out of lust will tell
[1:33:32] another person I love you when all they
[1:33:35] are doing they just lusting after the
[1:33:37] person
[1:33:39] praise the lord
[1:33:44] he says even the one we have for our
[1:33:46] children our wives and for one another
[1:33:48] he say it's still perverted because it's
[1:33:50] just failure you. One time we happy,
[1:33:52] another time we best we angry.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; It's not constant.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It's perverted. That's the reason why
[1:34:04] it's not constant.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:14] I hope uh we can have time to just go
[1:34:17] through all of the colors, but not
[1:34:18] tonight. Maybe sometime in the future.
[1:34:20] Amen. But let's let let's let's just
[1:34:22] read. Let's go back to Hebrews 7 here. I
[1:34:24] want to close on this.
[1:34:27] I hope I hope something was to encourage
[1:34:29] you tonight. Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; I hope something was there to encourage
[1:34:34] you tonight.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; The way that God is dealing with us is
[1:34:38] no sign of hatred.
[1:34:41] It's no sign of God want you to roll on
[1:34:44] the ground seven times.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:48] is if God is no sign of God want you to
[1:34:50] go on hunger strike so your problem can
[1:34:52] end no is God way of making you to
[1:34:55] understand him
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; it's God way of making you to understand
[1:35:01] him that's the reason why when Job had
[1:35:03] all of those question
[1:35:06] he had all of those question because he
[1:35:08] knew by the grace of God he did what he
[1:35:12] knew was right to do he would not drag
[1:35:15] his integrity in the in in the mud
[1:35:18] because people are saying this or people
[1:35:20] are saying that when he did God had to
[1:35:22] come in flesh in a form of elwood
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; to be able to help him to understand.
[1:35:30] Job these things were taught before the
[1:35:32] foundation of the word.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; It was taught. It was plain. God
[1:35:39] designed it for you.
[1:35:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:47] Are we together?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; So let's let's let's close this thing up
[1:35:52] here. And in there we find out that he
[1:35:55] has seven varieties of of spirit. Is
[1:35:58] that right? The Bible said said in in in
[1:36:02] Revelation that the seven spirit before
[1:36:04] the throne. Is that right? The seven
[1:36:07] manifold seven spirit.
[1:36:10] We find out there is seven colors.
[1:36:14] There is seven church ages.
[1:36:17] Seven is complete and God was complete
[1:36:22] in seven spirit.
[1:36:24] And those seven spirits were perfect.
[1:36:28] We find the first ones the color red
[1:36:32] perfect law redemption
[1:36:35] and how if we had time to uh to give
[1:36:38] those color will show each one of of
[1:36:41] those color represent God purity.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Represent God purity. Why? Because they
[1:36:51] they all came out of the pure fountain
[1:36:53] of God.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:00] Our our our status in life does not make
[1:37:04] one one person superior and another
[1:37:06] person inferior.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; What what is happening is just our mind.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; The color of our skin does not make one
[1:37:14] person superior and another person
[1:37:16] inferior. It's just our mind.
[1:37:22] To God is pure.
[1:37:26] That's the reason why David will express
[1:37:28] in a psalm and realize how wonderful and
[1:37:33] fearfully we are made.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He say how wonderful and fearfully even
[1:37:41] even our oh man there there is there is
[1:37:44] something there is some there's no time
[1:37:46] tonight. It's 9:00 already.
[1:37:50] I I pray that I I will not lost it but I
[1:37:53] will find time to share that with you.
[1:37:56] Amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I'll find time to share that. Even even
[1:38:00] even the way that God make our
[1:38:02] temperament,
[1:38:04] he took his time.
[1:38:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; God was never in hurry to meet us. He
[1:38:12] took his time to be able to give us the
[1:38:16] temperament that we needed.
[1:38:20] to deal with the things that we will
[1:38:22] have to deal with.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; The same way you look at somebody and
[1:38:33] you admire THEM, I I JUST LIKE THE way
[1:38:35] that he's doing, that's the same way God
[1:38:37] will allow somebody look at you and
[1:38:39] admire you. I JUST LIKE THE way that
[1:38:40] she's doing.
[1:38:51] Seven is completed. God is completed in
[1:38:54] seven spirit. And those seven spirit
[1:38:56] were perfect. The first was the color
[1:38:58] red perfect law of redemption.
[1:39:00] And
[1:39:03] and how if we had time he says we can go
[1:39:06] through each of these color represent
[1:39:08] God's purity. Those color there are
[1:39:12] seven natural color. Those color
[1:39:14] represent the purity of God. Those color
[1:39:17] represent the motive of God, the
[1:39:21] attributes of God.
[1:39:24] God trying
[1:39:26] to help us to understand him.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And the only way that he can do it
[1:39:34] is to touch you.
[1:39:37] Is to touch you. Is to come down and
[1:39:41] touch you.
[1:39:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes when when the
[1:39:46] battle gets tough
[1:39:49] and it just looks like it's so tough and
[1:39:53] there sometimes it just it looks like
[1:39:54] there is no way you can see God in it.
[1:39:57] He's right there. David said, "Even if I
[1:40:00] made my bed in hell, behold, thou was
[1:40:03] there."
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When the disciples were
[1:40:07] the the the boat was all twisting life
[1:40:11] and right and left and and and
[1:40:13] everything and they thought that it was
[1:40:15] a ghost coming to to swallow them. Jesus
[1:40:18] said it is I be not afraid.
[1:40:21] He said it is I be not afraid.
[1:40:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. That is the way that God
[1:40:31] can help us to understand him. The great
[1:40:35] internal one is piercing. The Bh
[1:40:41] said in Hebrew, the word of God is
[1:40:43] sharper than the two edges swore.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Piercing the dividing the sun of our
[1:40:48] spirit and soul. So the word is going
[1:40:51] through all of those things. The marrows
[1:40:53] of our bone, our our tissue, our
[1:40:55] seniors, our our nerves and and
[1:40:58] everything. He's going through it just
[1:41:00] like that. pure light going through
[1:41:04] those that that that that uh h
[1:41:07] prism and then it it just it just
[1:41:09] reflects self light.
[1:41:12] That is the same way
[1:41:15] the great internal spirit
[1:41:18] is pressing through this body of yours.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; To express himself
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; to you. It looks like it's so hard, but
[1:41:28] when you get outside, he makes you seven
[1:41:32] colors to somebody. I just love this
[1:41:34] person. They are so kind. Praise the
[1:41:37] Lord.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And they tell you, says, you know, I
[1:41:40] really appreciate you. And then you say
[1:41:43] to yourself, if you really know me,
[1:41:46] if you really know me,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You know, there there is just something
[1:41:54] about you
[1:41:57] And you sitting there, okay,
[1:42:01] what is about me?
[1:42:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; You already your your your hand is on
[1:42:08] the trigger.
[1:42:10] Your gun is already automatic. You want
[1:42:12] to stop
[1:42:14] just just blasting everywhere.
[1:42:18] You are so peaceful.
[1:42:21] Okay.
[1:42:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Then you telling in yourself you say the
[1:42:30] person I know what I'm going through
[1:42:33] know what I'm going through. But you see
[1:42:34] it is it is not your work. It is not
[1:42:36] your makeup.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; No is that pure fountain that is
[1:42:41] pressing through.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's expressing himself.
[1:42:49] Realize we are made for his pleasure. He
[1:42:52] can do with all whatever he please.
[1:43:00] Musicians come tonight. Let's just let's

[1:57:53] on me from heaven. [singing]
[1:57:57] And [music] I can't be the host in this
[1:58:01] world. Let's take the first verse down.
[1:58:03] [music]
[1:58:07] This word is not my home. I'm just
[1:58:11] passing through my [music and singing]
[1:58:13] treasure. I
[1:58:16] somewhere beyond the moon. The [music]
[1:58:20] angels I call me from [singing] heaven.
[1:58:24] They know. Oh, and [music] I can see our
[1:58:27] home in this world.
[1:58:30] Oh yes. Oh Lord, [music and singing]
[1:58:33] you know I have no friend like you.
[1:58:37] [music]
[1:58:38] If heaven is not my own, [singing]
[1:58:41] there was one I see and I ain't just
[1:58:45] like
[1:58:47] [music and singing] never.
[1:58:50] And I can't be the whole [music] in this
[1:58:53] world. The next verse
[1:58:56] is this respecting me and that's [music]
[1:58:59] one thing I know I face up with Jesus
[1:59:06] as I go. I know he will see [music] me
[1:59:10] true. Though [singing] I'm weak and bow
[1:59:17] [singing] in this [music] world.
[1:59:19] Yes, my Lord Jesus. You know I have
[1:59:24] [music] no friends like you.
[1:59:28] If not my [singing] home,
[1:59:30] what would I do? The picture of me from
[1:59:36] [music] that. Oh yes. And I won't be a
[1:59:40] [singing]
[1:59:47] [music]
[1:59:50] go in the peace of the Lord.
[1:59:52] Let the Lord bless you and keep you. We
[1:59:56] will see you Saturday night.
[2:00:00] [music]
[2:00:03] Oh [singing] yes. Oh Lord, [music] what
[2:00:06] would I do?
[2:00:09] Oh, the angels [singing]
[2:00:11] back on me [music]
[2:00:14] from heaven. Okay.
