continue in a little bit from where we were speaking on Sunday we were talking about a great woman uh Matthew Chapter 5 that's what we want to read from this evening praise the Lord praise the Lord our God is faithful our God is good amen amen Matthew Chapter 5 let's just read uh if I can be able to flip my pages right here okay Matthew Chapter 5 we read from verse 13 ye are the sword of the Earth but if the salord have lost it savior how W shall it be salted it is hence for good for nothing but to be cast out and to be tro in on the forth for man ye are the light of the word a city that is set on an hell cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it on a Bushell but on a Candlestick and he gave a light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven am amen father we ask that you bless your word tonight and uh come Lord speak to us speak to us father we don't want to play religion we come Lord your children has driven from all around the city tonight to be here we just pray that father you will come Break Your Word Of Your Word of Life to our hearts tonight May something be said Lord that will draw us closer to you help us father we love you we appreciate you father once again you know the desire of our hearts you know the needs in our life you know the needs in our home father you know the needs of this assembly the spiritual need Lord if there is one thing that we need the most we need you we need you in our midst father Lord so we we ask that you would bless us now and bless your word in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so by the word of uh a title we can title this tonight uh uh uh the great woman part two and what I want to do tonight is there a uh I want to I want to run a parallel tonight if if uh if the if as the Lord will help me tonight and and then in doing that we can be able to look at few history and we can be able to look at few of the things that is happening in our midst now we were talking about we've been speaking about that great woman jessibel and uh uh and her influence on on Sunday we talk about her being a great woman in Revelation chapter 18 it talk about uh uh um the uh Mr Babylon the great and uh so but y said where where my mind is tonight and and and I want for us to look at in a parallel is how uh that woman jessibel and Babylon relates amen I want us to look at how the woman jessibel and Babylon relates now the the the scripture talks about uh you know a Babylon and a liking Babylon onto uh that that that woman Babylon you know that great Babylon you know and and when you read right there it starts to talk about how she and all the things that she has done now it's is all of that is is because of the place of a woman in the scripture you know she's uh uh she has she has a special place to with with God and and that was the reason why when God made a woman he put the man to sleep is because of some of the the the values that she has you know and she was giving the promise of redemption as we have said before but so tonight we want to run a parallel to see that there is there is there is a connection between Babylon and that woman Jezebel and there is a connection between the New Jerusalem and the bride amen so that's that's what we want to we want to be able to look out for the few minutes that is before us now see here the Bible says that we have just read in uh in Matthew chapter chapter 5 uh the the the the scripture says that uh um you are the light of the word a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid amen that you are a city praise the Lord that you are a city so we seeing here that uh the city Babylon which uh became uh uh uh a civilization After the flood and we know where where were near buil and there was a system that was built and and and in uh uh in a religion and and all of that a form of worship that was contrary to uh to the worship that Noah and his sons had which of course they came through the flood you know they were the one that God deed with but then we see that but then uh through through the through the history Through the Ages we see there are very system there are very system of Nero going down through the lineage of uh of uh uh uh Abraham and his seed and they have to deal with all of that they came out of that place uh uh uh Canan the amorites and all of those nations came out of you know that great Babylon and and and and there was a man also that came out of Babylon his father Abraham he came out of Babylon that's where his father came out of but from this man God will make a covenant God will start once again approaching the heart of man God once again will start speaking to the conscience of man and God start dealing with Abraham and he has have to call him out he has to come out of that system of Babylon and then we see down Through the Ages as we as we'll realize a Seed of Abraham bought the land from the jebusites which is now called Jerusalem and David make that place a special place he called it Zion he makes it his capital and and then we realize that the eyes of God says watching over that place and watching over that people are we together now so there's a parallel here that's that's what we want to look at Babylon and Jezebel Jerusalem and the bride are we together amen now look at Revelation chapter 21 let's look at Revelation chapter 21 a little bit here and uh because when we look through all of this we will want to see that uh uh just like how God brought Abraham father and Abraham formally out of Babylon and God started dealing with Abraham for him to become a Hebrew for a race to come out of out of Abraham called h h h a people that God will start dealing with just just at a time just like how God did that that is the very same thing that he's doing with you amen our our sinful nature that we were born under is Babylon confusion we came into the word speaking lines we came into the word confused we never knew our right identity so he had to bring us out of Babylon he has to start dealing with our conscience he has to start dealing with our heart and he then he brings us into a covenant that we call the new birth amen amen then pretty soon God's eyes cannot move from on us now because we are in a covenant with him and then he start dealing with us from our life he start casting out an influence that's what a city is praise the Lord every city and many appolis uh uh when people talk about Los Angeles it's a city and one thing about a city is that it has influence every city has influence people talk about New York City it's busy it's not a slow City it's a fast moving City amen amen our said it say uh uh uh uh uh what is it Minnesota friendly amen we try to be nice to everybody so but what what I'm saying is that every city has an influence in and and and uh uh I'm almost losing my thought here but it's okay praise the Lord now so let's let's look at this let's look at this Revelation chapter 21 verse 1 and two and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were pass away and there was no more seed amen and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride so the New Jerusalem year is having an influence as a bride are we together she's coming down when God looks at her he looks at her as a bride and we know definitely the Bride is a is is a wife it's a woman so we see here there's a parallel All Through the Bible all through the scripture Jerusalem is always having having an influence and and and when God talks to Jerusalem in the book of Jeremiah he says he says how how you were a young virgin unto me he's talking to the people he's talking to the city but he says I you know you were just like a Young Bride unto me praise the Lord and the same thing when he talks to Babylon he he he talks about h h h i mean how she was a war even from the Old Testament is running down are we together now see see something again Revelation chapter 18 Revelation chapter 18 Revelation chapter 19 Revelation chapter 18 verse1 the whole the whole chapter talks about the destruction of Babylon it talks about the bumping of the Vatican okay that's that's just the reality it talking about it talks about the blasting of this great wle the Judgment of this great hole are we together now wash now the Bible talks about that you you can read the rest of that and and and and after these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven having a great power and the Earth was was was was was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen that great woman with all of influence now she has come under God's judgment now see what will happen chapter 19 chapter 19 verse1 and after these things I heard a great voice of of much people in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto our God for truth and righteous are his judgment for he have judged the Great War he has judged that great woman amen and uh uh uh the great world which did corrupt the Earth with her fication and her and her vengance and her blood and and the blood of his servants at his hand and again they said Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever now you think about this here said in chapter 18 there is the the the great world is Judge and as soon as the great will judge now these these these people that are rejoicing and is praising God Amen the the scripture says in a great voice of people in heaven saying that I mean the Saints and all of that it it just tell that the destruction of this woman the eliminating of of influence bring a great joy and that's what happened when God visit the heart of a sinner by his power by his word word and he break you free from sin you rejoice and say thank God because now you have found your truth identity amen so until until we get out of this body until we leave this earth there is that attachment to jerus to to Babylon and what is the Babylon is our sinful nature there is there is that attachment I I was telling this to this and and I and I saw the scripture Ezekiel chapter 16 let's look at it quickly I might be running you all over the place but it's okay again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man cause Jerusalem to know her Abominations amen now he's talking to the city now tell these people tell them where they are coming from tell them what their problem is tell them to know their sin the the evil that they are doing and said thus said the Lord God unto Jerusalem their birth their Nativity is of the land of Canaan amen you have had all of this special treatment love has been poured over you but let me tell you where your root is from let me tell you where your birth is from amen that City Jerusalem was the city of the jebusites it was it was one of the city of the many city in in in the land of Canaan that was occupied by the by you know by the people there you know the Canaanites the the the havit the jebusites it was a city of the jebusite praise the Lord it was where it was when h h h uh Kaleb was was was asking for his mounting he and he captured that City and then when David came also David had to to to redeem that City and that's that's how the name was changed from the city of the jebusite to jerusalen a city of Peace but its origin was not a city of Peace its birth is Nativity where God brought that City from was right from out of idolatry amen even Abraham the father of Faith where did his father came from Babylon is that that's where his root is from and that's what we all have to be conscious of it's not because Grace has come to us and the grace of God is dealing with us that you would think that you are better than somebody else amen amen amen oh when you think about where the Lord brought you from go back to the Lane of your Nativity go back to your roots just like how it was in the beginning there were Darkness upon the face of the Earth Darkness representing sin Darkness all over the faith but yet God was able to bring an edting out of a a a earth that was in chaos and that is the same thing that he's doing to you and myself to be able to bring the best out of us in the midst of all of our confusion and all of our misrepresentation and all of the thing that we think we are are we together he says tell Jerusalem the their abomination maybe let let them know their Roots then they will appreciate how I have been I has been winning their hearts every time I draw them I deal with them they go back to the idolatry if is because that's their root and that is the reason why we struggle amen amen that is the reason why we fight different things because that's our root we were born in sin shap in iniquity come to the word speaking lies amen that's why we had to fight to be able to keep our truth identity because there is there is a connection there there is a connection just stay away from the presence of the Lord stay away from Reading God's work stay away from praying you will see what will root up in your heart you will see the kind of evil things you will be thinking about the evil things you will be Desiring that's right that's right because that's our root that's the lane of our Nativity this body was born in sin are we together but what what God want to do do of you is to make a bride a door for her husband that's what he want to make out of you praise the Lord amen and what he would do out of the wicked is the same way he blasted h h h Babylon the same way he WEP the vatic WEP the Vatican out of the Earth with we by out of the earth that is the same way he would do with the wicked so you see that paraller being running praise the Lord right from Genesis there's a parer that's been running of the two cities praise the Lord now so you see the the the mystery there is that the T the hidden thing behind it is how God is dealing with the hemid where he's bringing us from and where he's carrying us to and the things that he want to do in our lives that's the reason why Jesus said don't look here don't look there the kingdom of God is in you it's in you God is dealing with the thing in you he's dealing with your heart he's dealing with your mind you have to be looking in yourself he's doing in you because it is not it is not joining a system it's not becoming a part of a country of a part of a church is what God is doing in you praise the Lord that is the reason why the man that takes consciousness of himself the man that takes consciousness of his inner being don't want to keep hatred don't want to keep malice don't want to keep Grudge it's the man that is getting closer to God it's it's not a man that is changing suit to be in church every Sunday but it's the one that is looking within and say oh God give me Grace oh Lord help me this is I I I need your grace here praise the Lord amen think about it out of this city like like like like Babylon right from it beginning it was it was it was a it was a very big massive city are we together very big city until all the little towns and little Nations that was around them was intimidated by the greatness of Babylon I mean the way to build a city and and and and n and all of those people but with all of that greatness what was happening inside that City they were worshiping Idols amen with all the greatness and all the pillars and all the civilization and all the building highrise building the thing that is done in the city that's what matters and you see that same Spirit you see the same system has come to our Bay you see big Cathedrals you see big buildings you see big all of those but the things that are done inside Jesus rebuked the system of his days he said you are full of dead men bones you attract people by the outside with with great pain and great architecture but you are evil inside you are evil inside that's what Babylon is praise the Lord amen but see Jerusalem when David redeemed that City it was just a little place a little despised Place praise the Lord the thing that made the greatness of that city was when God came down and honor the worship of David you remember when the Ark of the Covenant was coming back and David was dancing before the AR he he threw His Garment and God came down and honor the worship it was not because of The Skys strier that was in the city it was because of a Heart of Worship amen it was because of a heart of a man that was ready to worship God a man that was ready to throw himself down forget about what people think about me forget about what people said about me amen his own wife tried to despise him he said you never see nothing yet tomorrow is going to be worse than this because he had a heart to worship God that's Jerusalem amen that's Jerusalem not the City Jerusalem is the people Jerusalem I'm talking about the people Jerusalem I'm talking about you the people Jerusalem the people that have a heart to bring God into their home to bring God into their lives to bring God into their mid amen as soon as Babylon was dead with there was a stream Hallelujah they started praying prising God and that's the same thing that happen to the believer as soon as God comes and he deals with our sinful nature it put Praise on our lips when he cut us away from that Babylon system where we are not worshiping the man we are not worshiping the church we are not worshiping the Creed but the one that we are worshiping is the god of Heaven and Earth hallu amen it help us it help us are we together so you see the parallel with that system that later on all through just just think about it it started there with nerra amen and then for the period of time you know h h h nothing of Babylon was said it came later on it came later on in the time of Isaiah in the middle of the book then after that physical City came and Israel went to Aire and all of that nothing of Babylon was said again and at the end of the book we see here and not a great Babylon but it's associated with a woman praise the Lord so it's a system it's a spirit that's the thing that we are Waring against for our bottle is now flesh and blood amen but it's against principalities it's against Power it's a it's against Great influence praise the Lord it said gains great influence that's that is that is that is where we are now so we see here look Paul Paul Paul deare with that Paul deare with that in uh uh uh Genesis in in in Galatians chapter 4 in Galatians chapter 4 Paul there with that Amen in Galatians chapter 4 praise the Lord see the way the the the Apostle approach it here when he talks here in galatian chapter 4 verse 26 oh praise the Lord the influence of uh a great woman amen we were talking about that uh on Sunday and we show that great woman the shimina woman her greatness was not because she was a queen her greatness was in her character amen her greatness was in her character to be able to identify that this man is a holy man of God and she build a place for him to rest praise the Lord she was able to support him that's why God call her a great woman and we saw this other woman here Mr Babylon the great her greatness was in her influence to dominate to destroy praise the Lord Paul in Galatians chapter 4 he P he he he speak of this when he talks about the Alle Glory between uh uh hagga and Sarah he says but Jerusalem verse 26 which is above is free which is the mother of us all amen it's above it's freed is the mother of us all that's where our new birth comes from amen that's where our our our our new nature is attached to when it talks about our old nature and our our Nativity Our Roots is from Babylon so he said you are a city on a hill you are a city the Bride is a city she's typed as New Jerusalem as a bride is a door for her husband when God looks at all that he has brought his church through and all the system that has fought against his church amen the Bible talks here in in Revelation I I I was I was trying to avoid this but let's read this and then I will try to wrap around this thought and close the meeting for the night amen let's go to revelation amen you love the Lord tonight that's uh in Revelation chapter 13 in Revelation chapter 13 now in Revelation chapter 13 we read this and we deare with it a little bit here and and I and and uh and I stood upon the sand of the seed and saw a beast rise up out of the seed and rise up out of the people amen this Beast is a system it's a system that has rised up out of the people it's a system that we tracing right from Genesis it has rised up out of the people in different forms just like here in Revelation chapter 13 is showing itself as a leper is showing itself as a as a h rise out of the people having seven heads and 10 horns and upon the horns 10 crowns and upon uh and upon the head the name of blasphemy it has taken different names some great names with great meaning but it's a name of blasphemy now see what I want to get to tonight and the Beast which which I saw was like unto a leper and the feet was like a bed and the mouth was like a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority now see this now and I saw one of the head as it were wounded to death and his daily wound was healed and all the word Wonder after the Beast now when brother Bram talks about this this is what happened Pagan Rome which is the last part of D Daniel Vision or Nebuchadnezzar dream the fot of iron Pagan room we know right at a time where our lord Jesus came and and even through the time of the ear Church Pagan room was ruling at that time amen but that head of pagan room was wounded to death as if to say room die off but the daily WB was healed when when it came back again it never came as an Empire it came as a church called the Roman church but it's the same Roman Empire that was ruling in the time of our Lord Jesus they they that that that that that that crucify him that that that kill the apostles All Through the Ages but now it has come in another form amen so that da W that was healed he has changed his form and that's why we be we we we see throughout the same Babylon that was there as ner they were trying to build a a tower to heaven and all of that when when that changes right there in the book of Jeremiah asai in the middle of the book we see another babyon again a change of system over in the Book of Revelation we see Babylon resurrect again but this time it's not a great City like it was of Nero it was not not like the one of of Nebuchadnezzar now it's a it's a church it's a system changing forms changing forms that's all the devil does amen that's all the devil does he just change form if he can't get you in this he will change to another thing to attract you so so you see you see what we kind of for looking at amen where we driving our TS tonight God in his Mercy he's dealing with us he's trying to bring us amen trying to bring us to our truth identification out of these two cities run parallel through and and and the history of the whole world is connected in it praise the Lord am the history of the whole world is connected in it our history is all connected in it praise the Lord every one of us before we came to the knowledge of the truth God brought us out of some kind of a system and if you check the root of that system it goes right back to Rome it goes right back to Babylon if the father of faith our Father Abraham that's where his root came from you see that's why God had to call him out God had to call him to Total separation praise the Lord to Total separation and God started dealing with him until he lost the identity of Babylon and God said your seed will so John you go back right there in the Book of Genesis it says that man Abraham the Hebrew he gain a name among the people because of his character he gained a name among the people there was one man that was standing in the earth and talking about God spoke to me one man that was standing in the earth and he was talking about God's visitation he was talking about a truth and a living God he he he gained a repetition called a Hebrew they never call him Abraham the the the Babylon might all the man out of Babylon I mean he came to Total separation until he lost his identity from Babylon and that's that's what God want to bring us to where we will lose our identity amen lose our identity lose our national spirit amen praise the Lord and having one one identity and identity is I'm a Child of God am I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm not an African I'm not an American I'm not I'm I'm a Child of God Abraham lost his identity everybody started calling him the Hebrew Abraham the Hebrew praise the Lord but his root came out of Babylon praise the Lord this bride church that is going to be the bride where did our root came out of Jesus John the Baptist Came Calling repent the kingdom of God from Heaven John Jesus came preaching the apostles came what were they doing calling the people out of Judaism right calling them out of Judaism to a new identity and the Pharisees and the Sadducees they fought against it no we cannot allow these people to do this but you can't fight against God you can't fight against God if God is calling your heart there is nothing you can do about it there is nothing you can do about it go and make yourself the most worse sinner he's going to bring you out the only thing that is going to happen to you is that you're just going to Reg regret you're going to regret why I didn't hear the first time because it's not you choosing he's making the choice it's not you pulling he's the one pulling are you stronger than God he's the one pulling is not you changing he's the one doing the changing he's the one doing the transformation praise the Lord he told Paul when he was s is hard to kick against the price amen you can't kick you can't kick a knife you can't look at a knife and kick it you are the one going to bleed and that's what happen when we are resisting God when we are resisting God dealing with us you are the one going to be hurt amen you are the one going to be hurt but that's what is happening here Babylon the great is falling and then all the saints shouted hallelujah praise God thank God this whole thing is done with my goodness and you and myself will have the opportunity to shout that shout hallelujah amen amen amen that would be our our final Jubilee thank God I can wake up without an evil thought thank God Amen when we get on the other side amen but while we are here we have to fight we have to fight to maintain our truth identity our new identity you are a great woman that is set on the hell amen a great woman that is set on the hell and your influence is stronger because your influence is from above that's why Jesus says let men see your good work and glorify your father in Heaven if you are looking for you to be glorified no it's a father in Heaven praise the Lord
