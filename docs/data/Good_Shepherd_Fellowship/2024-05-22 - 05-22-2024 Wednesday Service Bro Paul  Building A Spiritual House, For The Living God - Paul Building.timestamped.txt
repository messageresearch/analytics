[45:41] seting let's go to the book of
[45:44] Acts Acts chapter 7 we read verse
[45:51] 44 Acts chapter 7
[45:58] Acts chapter
[46:01] 7 we read from I believe verse
[46:06] 44 as
[46:12] 7even he says
[46:14] this our
[46:16] fathers had a tabernacle of
[46:19] witness in the
[46:21] wilderness that he had appointed
[46:24] speaking unto Moses that he should make
[46:28] it according to the
[46:31] fashion that he had
[46:33] seen which also our fathers that came
[46:38] after brought in with Jesus into the
[46:44] possession of the Gentiles whom God draw
[46:48] out before the face of our fathers unto
[46:53] the days of
[46:55] David who found favor before God and
[46:59] desired to find a tabernacle for the god
[47:05] of
[47:06] Jacob but Solomon buil him a house how
[47:12] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[47:17] made with hands as sayeth the prophets
[47:22] Heaven is my my throne and Earth is my
[47:27] full stool which house will he build me
[47:32] sayeth the Lord or what is the place of
[47:36] my
[47:38] rest may the Lord add a blessing to his
[47:42] word amen amen so this evening as I said
[47:47] we want to speak on building a spiritual
[47:51] house for the Living
[47:54] God now we see that when we look around
[47:58] today we see many many
[48:01] mansions being
[48:03] built but little
[48:05] attention is given to the the spiritual
[48:12] house and you see that
[48:14] today people are building
[48:18] mansions
[48:19] but uh is a reflection of the age that's
[48:23] right but there is one building that
[48:27] people are
[48:29] neglecting now we recall that we not
[48:31] come on Earth by
[48:33] ourselves is the almighty God that
[48:37] brought us on Earth for a purpose right
[48:42] and that
[48:43] purpose is that he will come and dwell
[48:47] in US amen and that is his purpose of
[48:51] creating men now we recall in Genesis
[48:55] 1:26
[48:57] God creating a spirit
[49:00] man and after creating that Spirit man
[49:04] he formed a
[49:06] body a physical body and then he placed
[49:10] that Spirit man in that body now you see
[49:14] when you look at Adam in the Garden of
[49:17] Eden he was
[49:20] motivated by that Spirit man that dwell
[49:24] in him now Adam didn't didn't do
[49:28] anything unless being
[49:31] motivated by that Spirit man that was in
[49:35] him now we will recall that after God
[49:39] creating
[49:41] everything he brought it to Adam Adam it
[49:46] is now your turn I have created
[49:51] everything now it is your turn to give
[49:54] names to these things that have cre
[49:56] created amen and as he was giving the
[50:00] names to the various things God was
[50:03] there saying Amen to
[50:06] it why because Adam had the mind of God
[50:10] Amen it was God in him giving names to
[50:15] those things Lord now we can see that
[50:18] after the
[50:19] fall that Spirit man that was in Adam
[50:25] took flight
[50:27] he left Adam so Adam was left now to
[50:32] shift by himself as a prophet
[50:36] said so we see that after the fall God
[50:40] has been trying to bring man back to
[50:44] him all that God was
[50:47] doing is to restore man back that he
[50:51] himself will come back and dwell in man
[50:56] that the purpose for which he created
[50:58] men will be
[51:01] accomplished that was the purpose of God
[51:05] now we see that after the
[51:09] fall God started building something we
[51:13] see Prophet after Prophet came but we'll
[51:17] see that at the end of the seven Church
[51:20] AG in the Old Testament the fullness of
[51:24] God in the form of Jesus came on the
[51:29] scene now we see that after Jesus was
[51:34] crucified was buried and
[51:37] resurrected he promised the people that
[51:40] uh They will receive a power amen from
[51:44] on high what was it it was God coming
[51:48] back again Amen to dwell in man amen in
[51:53] order to
[51:54] fulfill his own plan plan and will right
[51:58] amen so you see that from the very first
[52:01] age God started
[52:04] something now we can see that throughout
[52:07] the ages Messengers after Messengers
[52:11] came and at the end of this age which is
[52:16] the seventh age God sent a prophet again
[52:21] now to do what to bring a total
[52:24] restoration and we see out again that
[52:28] the fullness of God came again and that
[52:33] is why Revelation
[52:34] 10 came it say in the days of the voice
[52:38] of the Seven Angels that's
[52:40] right all the Myster of God will be
[52:43] fulfilled amen as he had declared to his
[52:46] servant the
[52:48] prophets now we see that from the very
[52:52] first age God started building a church
[52:58] do you agree with me now you see that in
[53:02] building a natural house you need a
[53:09] contractor now when this church was
[53:11] being built you needed a
[53:15] contractor you see and that
[53:18] contractor had to employ the services of
[53:22] other men like electrician a carpenter
[53:27] and mes all sort of
[53:29] things so God when he started building
[53:33] this church he had seven
[53:37] contractors and Paul was the first
[53:41] contractor and after that came other
[53:45] contractors and in this last age he
[53:50] brought a
[53:52] contractor that will finish the work
[53:55] prise the Lord
[53:57] amen I hope you following me now brother
[54:01] brother PR preached the message the
[54:03] stature of a perfect
[54:06] man now before he preached that message
[54:10] he preached a message the
[54:13] key in that message he was emphasizing
[54:18] on
[54:20] something and he said in that
[54:24] message that uh
[54:27] faith is very
[54:31] important he said
[54:34] faith is the
[54:36] key that open the scriptures yes
[54:40] sir now this Tabernacle has a key yes
[54:46] anybody who comes first here he has to
[54:50] use the key to open the door but why do
[54:55] you have to close the door because you
[54:58] have some valuable things in this place
[55:02] you don't want anything to breaking and
[55:05] steal the things that's right not
[55:08] spiritually speaking we have a key right
[55:11] and that key opens the
[55:14] scriptures and Christ is the
[55:17] door now inside Christ we have many
[55:22] valuable things that's right things that
[55:26] to life amen and we need that
[55:30] key which is Faith which is
[55:35] revelation and without a revelation you
[55:38] cannot enter into Christ right glory and
[55:42] that is why the prophet kept on doing
[55:44] what emphasizing on Revelation yes when
[55:49] you go to pray ask God for Revelation
[55:53] that's right and Revelation is the
[55:57] key that an open the door that's right
[56:00] for you to enter
[56:02] in think about it is very very
[56:09] important the prophet of God
[56:15] says he
[56:22] says it says
[56:24] this through that blood we are
[56:28] cleansed and now our
[56:31] blood our life which came by living
[56:35] through sexual
[56:37] desire brought our life in the
[56:40] world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[56:45] us changes our Nature by sending upon us
[56:51] the Holy
[56:52] Spirit then we become into the div
[56:56] divine nature of God then we become a
[57:00] dwelling place for God Amen Jesus said
[57:05] at that day you will know that I am in
[57:09] the
[57:09] father and the father in me I in you and
[57:15] you in me now I'll not dwell so much on
[57:20] that now the prophet of God when he was
[57:23] preaching uh the seven Church age
[57:27] he drill the pyramid and placed every
[57:31] messenger in it now when he was
[57:34] preaching the last age the angel of the
[57:37] Lord came down and Dre the same thing
[57:41] that the prophet
[57:43] Dre vindicating that the message that he
[57:47] was preaching was the
[57:49] truth now you see that from the very
[57:52] bottom of the Statue of a perfect man
[57:55] was faith
[57:57] right and Faith was the
[58:00] foundation for the Christian church and
[58:03] for every believer that starts faith is
[58:08] the foundation yes that's right and we
[58:12] will see that uh faith comes by what
[58:17] hearing by the
[58:19] hearing you see and the prophet of God
[58:22] says without a new birth there is no
[58:25] faith
[58:26] it is the new birth that brings the
[58:30] faith and that faith is the
[58:34] Revelation you see so every Christian as
[58:37] we start we start by faith and Faith
[58:42] come by hearing the word of God am now
[58:46] the Apostle Peter was saying the this he
[58:49] said Peter a servant and an apostle of
[58:53] Jesus Christ to them that have obtain
[58:57] like Precious faith in other words to
[59:01] them that have been born
[59:05] again you see and then he continued to
[59:08] say uh they have obtained a life
[59:12] precious with us through the
[59:14] righteousness of God and our Savior
[59:18] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[59:22] multiplied unto you through the knowled
[59:26] know of God and of
[59:29] Jesus according as his divine power are
[59:34] given unto us all things that pertain
[59:37] unto life and godliness through the
[59:41] knowledge of him that has called us to
[59:46] glory and virtue yes
[59:50] now uh he said he has called it through
[59:53] what not by our own effort but by his
[59:57] divine
[59:59] power he has called us and it is that
[1:00:03] divine power that works in every
[1:00:06] believer it is that divine power that
[1:00:10] brings what transformation to the
[1:00:12] believer amen now we were in the world
[1:00:15] we were born in sin shap in
[1:00:17] iniquity but we needed something yes we
[1:00:21] needed God divine
[1:00:23] power and when you f the go for and you
[1:00:27] responded to it it was God divine
[1:00:31] power calling you to himself Hallelujah
[1:00:35] because before the foundation of the
[1:00:37] world he saw you and he predestinated
[1:00:41] you to
[1:00:44] life now when that day you heard a
[1:00:49] message it was God talking to
[1:00:52] you it was God calling you you did come
[1:00:56] by your own will but it was
[1:00:59] God God doing something in your life
[1:01:04] amen then he continues to
[1:01:07] say he said verse three according to his
[1:01:10] divine power had given unto you all
[1:01:14] things that pertain to your existence
[1:01:17] life means
[1:01:18] existence and
[1:01:20] godliness and through the knowledge of
[1:01:23] him that has called you to glory and and
[1:01:26] power now when God calls you and fills
[1:01:29] you with the Holy Ghost there is a glory
[1:01:32] around you that's right there is power
[1:01:36] in you that is virtue when Jesus came on
[1:01:40] the earth and as he went Healing The
[1:01:43] Sick sometime they say virtue came out
[1:01:46] of him true amen you see and in a in a
[1:01:50] certain message he said as he went along
[1:01:54] people were drawing God out of him and
[1:01:58] you sitting here this evening if you are
[1:02:01] filled with the Holy Ghost God is in you
[1:02:06] am and that is why we can pray for
[1:02:09] people they are healed Hallelujah why
[1:02:12] they are drawing some power out of you
[1:02:15] they are drawing God out of you amen
[1:02:19] Jesus and when your pastor son stands
[1:02:22] here he's a messenger to this to this
[1:02:25] church
[1:02:27] and as the word he preaches the
[1:02:30] word Virtue follows the
[1:02:33] word and those who come your burden amen
[1:02:36] as the word comes forth amen that burden
[1:02:39] is taken away amen what was it is God in
[1:02:44] operation
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:48] hallelujah verse four
[1:02:50] whereby are giv unto us exceeding great
[1:02:56] and precious
[1:02:58] promises that by this you might be
[1:03:02] partakers of the divine
[1:03:05] nature having escaped the
[1:03:09] corruption that is in the world through
[1:03:12] last now we see that today there is a
[1:03:15] lot of
[1:03:17] corruption in the world
[1:03:20] today and God wants us to do what to
[1:03:23] escape that corruption
[1:03:25] you cannot Escape it by your own power
[1:03:28] yes there must be something in you right
[1:03:32] Amen to overcome the
[1:03:36] corruption and that is why when you hear
[1:03:38] the word there is a
[1:03:41] buildup word upon word upon word upon
[1:03:45] word as you receive the word there is a
[1:03:48] build up of power in youen which will
[1:03:52] overcome the world that will overcome
[1:03:55] the corrupt
[1:03:57] that is in the world
[1:03:59] Amen and you must count yourself I mean
[1:04:03] blessed to be here this evening there
[1:04:06] are many in the world this evening who
[1:04:08] have not got this opportunity but as you
[1:04:12] have got this
[1:04:13] opportunity you need to take it
[1:04:16] seriously because God has been mindful
[1:04:19] of
[1:04:20] you to be able to send this message to
[1:04:23] you amen than you Jesus thank
[1:04:27] you and in verse five he says beside
[1:04:31] this give all
[1:04:35] diligence give all
[1:04:38] diligence and I was I went to the
[1:04:40] dictionary to look at the meaning of
[1:04:42] diligence I mean those who are English
[1:04:44] speak speaking people they know exactly
[1:04:48] what diligence means now the dictionary
[1:04:52] tells me uh this
[1:04:56] he said diligence is To Be
[1:05:00] steady is to be
[1:05:04] Earnest
[1:05:07] devoted and then
[1:05:09] energetic now when somebody is
[1:05:13] diligent he's
[1:05:15] steady he's
[1:05:17] Earnest and he has that sense of
[1:05:21] devotion
[1:05:23] yes you see yeah that is being
[1:05:27] diligent now what about
[1:05:30] uh uh to be uh
[1:05:34] Earnest to be Earnest is to show what
[1:05:39] sincere and intense
[1:05:42] conviction when you Earnest in doing
[1:05:45] something you have a
[1:05:47] conviction a strong conviction yes that
[1:05:51] this thing that I'm doing I'm going to
[1:05:54] succeed amen this thing that I'm doing
[1:05:57] is the right way this thing that I'm
[1:06:01] doing is the true thing that is Being
[1:06:05] Earnest and when you are diligent in
[1:06:08] doing something you are devoted to it
[1:06:11] yes you are stable you are balanced amen
[1:06:16] amen you don't go to one side of the
[1:06:19] other side you are
[1:06:22] balanced that is to be stable amen now
[1:06:26] if you see a ship on the
[1:06:29] ocean and as it's well
[1:06:32] loaded it is
[1:06:35] balanced now if he goes to this side too
[1:06:37] much it's going to
[1:06:40] sink but you see it is steady on the
[1:06:44] ocean it is balanced and it can go
[1:06:47] straight to its
[1:06:49] destination and that is what the prophet
[1:06:51] of God said we must be balanced in the
[1:06:54] scripture
[1:06:56] amen we don't link too much to
[1:06:59] legalistic or uh the other side the
[1:07:03] middle of the way is the road amen so as
[1:07:07] Christian Believers we need to be
[1:07:10] diligent we need to be stable we need to
[1:07:13] be convicted amen of what we are
[1:07:17] doing and know when you are you have a
[1:07:19] conviction doing something amen you are
[1:07:23] very particular about things
[1:07:26] look take for instance the the
[1:07:28] Muslim they have uh they believe that uh
[1:07:32] if you kill somebody uh you you go
[1:07:34] straight to heaven but that is a
[1:07:37] deception of the
[1:07:40] devil you see there's so much believe
[1:07:43] that there's so much convicted about
[1:07:45] that but it is a deception yeah right
[1:07:49] you see but a Christian
[1:07:52] conviction is through the word of God
[1:07:55] Amen amen it's not through the mind of
[1:07:58] somebody it's not through a certain
[1:08:01] Creed Creed but when you really
[1:08:04] convicted of the word you have a
[1:08:06] revelation and that Revelation convict
[1:08:09] you am that this is the truth yes there
[1:08:12] is no other truth amen and we see that
[1:08:15] the message of the
[1:08:17] hour God has proven that this is the
[1:08:22] truth and all I receive this message and
[1:08:25] are convicted of it amen you see the way
[1:08:29] they live is different from the other
[1:08:33] churches God has called us to
[1:08:37] that and he
[1:08:39] said uh add to your faith virtue so you
[1:08:45] see that when God Peter was talking
[1:08:48] about this thing going back to verse one
[1:08:50] again that Simon Peter servant of an
[1:08:53] apostle of Jesus Christ Christ to them
[1:08:57] that have obtained what like Precious
[1:09:01] faith and in verse five he saying that
[1:09:04] what and beside this giving all
[1:09:08] diligence besides what because he has
[1:09:10] already receive the faith he has already
[1:09:13] been born
[1:09:15] again and he's telling that what add to
[1:09:19] your
[1:09:21] faith you see so the new birth brings
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:27] faith in the message the statue of a
[1:09:29] perfect man the prophets of God was
[1:09:34] saying this it says the new birth bring
[1:09:39] Faith now he says
[1:09:43] this there was a prophecy that was
[1:09:46] fulfilled when he spoke about uh the gly
[1:09:50] be he said last evening some friends
[1:09:53] come in they had heard that Vision told
[1:09:59] about the
[1:10:00] Caribou that had 42 in on and a silver G
[1:10:06] steep grizly bear I don't know how many
[1:10:11] people that is SC at the house wants to
[1:10:16] see that I said yes is the tape the tape
[1:10:21] measure get on the horn and he heard it
[1:10:26] before it
[1:10:27] happened see why When God says anything
[1:10:33] is God to
[1:10:35] happen that is the reason is
[1:10:39] based then he continued to say this now
[1:10:43] here is the Plan of
[1:10:46] Salvation and then if his
[1:10:49] vision happened
[1:10:52] perfectly exactly the way
[1:10:55] they say they
[1:10:57] do and this church here knows that is
[1:11:01] right then what about his word see there
[1:11:06] is more sure than the
[1:11:09] vision if the vision didn't speak with
[1:11:13] the word then the vision is
[1:11:17] wrong but is the word first because the
[1:11:22] word is God see
[1:11:26] so he's
[1:11:27] omnipotent he spoke that here and made
[1:11:31] it come to pass in Canada amen see he's
[1:11:38] omnipotent now listen carefully now
[1:11:41] first you must be born
[1:11:44] again and then when you are born again
[1:11:49] you have
[1:11:51] faith you believe the word
[1:11:55] until you are born
[1:11:58] again you will argue against it if you
[1:12:02] are just
[1:12:04] religiously
[1:12:06] inclined and you got a little human
[1:12:10] knowledge that you should do right you
[1:12:15] will never be able to agree upon the
[1:12:17] word of
[1:12:19] God you will never do it you've got to
[1:12:23] be born again
[1:12:26] and born again it produces
[1:12:30] Faith all right then after you get
[1:12:35] Faith this right here talking about the
[1:12:38] faith at the bottom the statue of a
[1:12:40] perfect
[1:12:41] man faith f a i t h Faith then you are
[1:12:47] just in a position of growing prise the
[1:12:53] Lord faith when you get it then you are
[1:12:57] just in a position of what growing
[1:13:00] that's right now we see in the
[1:13:04] natural every child that is born has to
[1:13:09] grow do you agree with
[1:13:11] me and so spiritually when you are born
[1:13:14] again you got to
[1:13:17] grow and the first thing when you are
[1:13:19] born again is what you receive the
[1:13:22] faith that is the Revelation that comes
[1:13:26] and the prophet of God says what you are
[1:13:28] just in a position of
[1:13:31] growth now when a child is
[1:13:34] born and he's fed
[1:13:37] well that child is going to De develop
[1:13:41] well and brother Bram in a message he
[1:13:44] preached in
[1:13:45] 1962 after preaching the spoken word is
[1:13:47] the Original Seed he preached about the
[1:13:51] end time seat sign in Georgia and then
[1:13:55] he was making a
[1:13:57] statement that uh a an infant church was
[1:14:02] born and when that infant church was
[1:14:05] born it has to grow that's right that
[1:14:08] was prior to the what the revelation of
[1:14:11] the
[1:14:12] seals now when that infant church is
[1:14:15] born it has to be fed fed with what with
[1:14:20] the word of God that's right and that is
[1:14:23] why the seal have to be open
[1:14:25] for this infant CH that was born to be
[1:14:29] fed on the word that came
[1:14:32] out because the prophet of God came to
[1:14:35] do what to gather the loose
[1:14:39] end you see and the revelation of the
[1:14:42] seals brought the true way back into
[1:14:46] manifestation so that chair that was
[1:14:49] infant CH that was born needed to be fed
[1:14:52] that's right Amen on the opening of the
[1:14:57] for it to be able to get what all the
[1:14:59] new spiritual
[1:15:00] nutrients for it to grow into the
[1:15:03] stature of a perfect man now the prophet
[1:15:06] continued to say this he said now a lot
[1:15:12] of people go up to the Altar and pray
[1:15:17] and say Lord forgive me and a great
[1:15:22] experience of sanctification come upon
[1:15:25] upon them and things then you have a
[1:15:29] great time get up to the altar
[1:15:34] shouting you go back say bless God I got
[1:15:39] it no you just started to a place where
[1:15:45] you can
[1:15:47] grow you ain't done nothing yet see the
[1:15:52] only thing you done is just lay the
[1:15:59] foundation you
[1:16:01] see you just lay the
[1:16:04] foundation now the foundation that you
[1:16:07] laid you got to build upon
[1:16:11] it and it doesn't take just one
[1:16:15] day now you have the foundation which is
[1:16:20] Faith and on that Faith you have to lay
[1:16:23] stone upon Stone
[1:16:25] amen Revelation upon
[1:16:30] Revelation and as you are laying upon it
[1:16:34] many things come against
[1:16:36] it trials
[1:16:39] Temptations they come here and
[1:16:43] there God is testing the building that
[1:16:46] you are putting
[1:16:47] up is just like when the children of
[1:16:51] Israel went to
[1:16:53] captivity and some of they have to come
[1:16:56] back to build the temple to restore and
[1:17:02] as they were
[1:17:03] building there were people that were
[1:17:06] coming against that's
[1:17:08] right but these people they had a sword
[1:17:13] in their
[1:17:14] hand and then with the other
[1:17:17] material putting up the
[1:17:20] building and there were some coming to
[1:17:22] discourage them
[1:17:25] there were some coming wanting to
[1:17:28] destroy but they have to fight as they
[1:17:31] were building the
[1:17:33] Temple and so it is for every Christian
[1:17:36] every individual when you are born again
[1:17:39] said
[1:17:40] what all the armors of Hell attend
[1:17:45] against you yeah right but what you need
[1:17:48] to do is to St with the word of
[1:17:51] God prise
[1:17:53] lord we see the same thing going on
[1:17:56] today and as you grow they will come
[1:17:59] against
[1:18:00] you now the target is not this
[1:18:04] flesh their target is the inner man that
[1:18:07] is in you right that's right they
[1:18:11] wouldn't want the inner man to grow
[1:18:13] that's right but the more you grow go
[1:18:16] through this those
[1:18:18] things the more you become
[1:18:22] firm and steady
[1:18:25] and the prophet of God put it this way
[1:18:28] giving the example of a tree
[1:18:32] growing Sometimes some storm will come
[1:18:36] and the storm comes and Shakes the
[1:18:39] tree what does he
[1:18:41] do it becomes more
[1:18:44] firmed and the room get deeper and
[1:18:48] deeper and the more trials that you
[1:18:53] have the that inner man in
[1:18:56] you don't
[1:18:59] worry stand
[1:19:04] firm you see and that is why God has to
[1:19:07] send
[1:19:09] trials
[1:19:11] Temptations but there is something that
[1:19:13] is in you amen there is an anchor that
[1:19:16] is in
[1:19:17] you as you just
[1:19:19] s your anchor will
[1:19:23] hold and those trial that come they just
[1:19:27] want to make sure that what you are
[1:19:30] believing is the
[1:19:33] truth because those who went ahead of us
[1:19:38] they face the same
[1:19:41] situation the Paul the peters and
[1:19:45] others they didn't have it
[1:19:48] easy and that is why they if you read
[1:19:51] Rew Hebrews
[1:19:53] 11 they were
[1:19:55] recounting the life of those men amen
[1:19:59] Joshua Caleb
[1:20:03] David they didn't have it
[1:20:07] easy and you will not have it this that
[1:20:12] easy because the one who made a promise
[1:20:15] say he will never forsake you yes nor
[1:20:18] leave you I will be with you even in you
[1:20:23] amen until the consumation of the
[1:20:27] ages though you might look very
[1:20:30] few but God is not in big
[1:20:35] numbers you see so what I just want to
[1:20:38] do this evening is to encourage
[1:20:42] you don't be
[1:20:44] discouraged God who made a promise he
[1:20:47] said I'll be with you amen I'll not
[1:20:50] forsake you
[1:20:53] amen discourage me will
[1:20:55] come but look at the life of the Apostle
[1:21:00] Paul when he met the pillar of
[1:21:04] fire he had to face a lot of
[1:21:07] things somewhere he he went to a place
[1:21:11] the brother had Vision spoke in Tong
[1:21:15] said this brother the person whom it
[1:21:18] belongs
[1:21:19] to this this and that will happen to him
[1:21:23] but the apostle so Paul was really
[1:21:28] convicted God met him and spoke to
[1:21:31] him you have been chosen to take this
[1:21:34] gospel to the
[1:21:38] Gentiles and God told him the things
[1:21:41] that he was going to go
[1:21:43] through and as he was going those
[1:21:46] things those things strengthen
[1:21:50] him they strengthen his faith
[1:21:54] I know whom I have believed that's right
[1:21:58] praise the Lord even if I go through all
[1:22:00] these things the one who call me is more
[1:22:04] than
[1:22:05] able to protect praise the Lord thank
[1:22:09] you
[1:22:11] Jesus I said now you are going to build
[1:22:14] a
[1:22:16] house and you
[1:22:18] pour the
[1:22:20] foundation say boy I got her see you you
[1:22:24] got a foundation to build your house
[1:22:28] on and you got to build a house now
[1:22:32] there is there is where the thing comes
[1:22:37] in this morning we are going to talk
[1:22:41] about now all right a
[1:22:46] house this Foundation is
[1:22:49] first what is the foundation of the
[1:22:52] Christianity faith
[1:22:55] in the word of God Amen that is your
[1:22:58] foundation that's right then you begin
[1:23:01] to
[1:23:02] grow then you start you begin to add
[1:23:08] this to the
[1:23:12] foundation
[1:23:15] now when you are building a house what
[1:23:19] is your motive for building a house
[1:23:25] is to dwell in the
[1:23:28] house you see so the house that God is
[1:23:34] building he wants to dwell in that
[1:23:39] house you
[1:23:43] see on their Journey from Egypt going to
[1:23:46] the promised
[1:23:48] land God showed a vision to
[1:23:52] Moses of a tabernacle of a
[1:23:56] temple and he was telling Moses that
[1:23:58] what he should build it exactly as he
[1:24:02] saw in the
[1:24:04] vision because what he saw in the vision
[1:24:07] was the
[1:24:11] model and he has to build it according
[1:24:14] to the model that he he
[1:24:18] saw and the prophet of God when he
[1:24:21] came he show us the model
[1:24:27] the type of go house that God is
[1:24:32] building now in the physical you see
[1:24:37] that when somebody is building a house
[1:24:40] he has diverse
[1:24:43] materials that go into the building of
[1:24:45] the
[1:24:48] house and then we have TR
[1:24:53] men that do various things on the
[1:24:56] building
[1:24:57] Warehouse the Mas SC the Carpenters SC
[1:25:02] the electrician
[1:25:04] come the painters they come and they use
[1:25:08] different
[1:25:11] materials but that spiritual H that we
[1:25:14] are building the material is the word of
[1:25:17] God that's
[1:25:20] right and you must use the proper
[1:25:22] materials amen at the proper time
[1:25:27] amen it's very
[1:25:30] important you see that the messengers
[1:25:33] that
[1:25:34] came they had different
[1:25:37] skills Paul was a
[1:25:40] messenger he led the
[1:25:44] foundation he was the master
[1:25:47] builder and he said the foundation that
[1:25:50] I have laid anybody that comes and build
[1:25:53] upon it
[1:25:55] he must be very
[1:26:00] careful and the material that you use in
[1:26:03] building the
[1:26:05] house but the prophet of God in this
[1:26:08] last age those that the material is the
[1:26:12] word of
[1:26:15] God you cannot build this spiritual
[1:26:18] house out of the material that God
[1:26:21] himself has provided amen amen
[1:26:26] if you don't use the appropriate
[1:26:29] materials if you are really child of God
[1:26:32] he will come he tell you no you have to
[1:26:34] break it
[1:26:36] down you know there was a brother who
[1:26:39] had a dream one time
[1:26:42] contractor that he was building a
[1:26:45] house the owner came and said no this is
[1:26:48] not the plan that I gave
[1:26:50] you and they had to break it down and
[1:26:54] start it
[1:26:56] again so the house that we are building
[1:26:59] that spiritual house we must follow the
[1:27:02] instructions from the
[1:27:05] prophet out of that you know build you
[1:27:09] build a house a house that is not of the
[1:27:12] plan of
[1:27:15] God for God to be for for the house to
[1:27:19] be able to be approved of God you must
[1:27:21] follow the model
[1:27:24] you must follow the
[1:27:27] plan other than that you finish
[1:27:30] building and the one that you are
[1:27:32] building it for will say no this is not
[1:27:35] the type of house that I
[1:27:38] need and you are you have to break it
[1:27:42] down and start
[1:27:44] again now you'll see
[1:27:47] that
[1:27:49] Ezekiel Saw a
[1:27:52] vision and the vision that Ezekiel
[1:27:57] Saw about God giving
[1:28:00] whatness a new heart and a new
[1:28:05] spirit and his own spirit in
[1:28:09] it it talks about the same
[1:28:13] thing because he said I'll come and take
[1:28:17] what the Stony heart that's right out of
[1:28:21] you and give you a heart of
[1:28:25] flesh
[1:28:28] amen and I will put a new spirit give
[1:28:32] you a new
[1:28:34] spirit and after giving you a new spirit
[1:28:38] I'll put my own spirit in
[1:28:42] it now sometimes people go through the
[1:28:46] process of
[1:28:48] sanctification as the prophet was saying
[1:28:50] they will go to the Altar and pray I
[1:28:53] have it
[1:28:55] but said you haven't got it
[1:28:58] yet now when you are
[1:29:01] Sanctified they think they have it all
[1:29:05] but they haven't got
[1:29:09] it because that state of
[1:29:13] sanctification is just a process
[1:29:16] preparing
[1:29:18] you for the spirit of God to come and
[1:29:22] dwell in that new spirit
[1:29:25] amen now that new spirit God is giving
[1:29:29] it to you to be able to get along with
[1:29:31] your
[1:29:33] neighbor to be able to get along with
[1:29:37] God then when all is
[1:29:40] set then he himself will
[1:29:43] come and dwell in
[1:29:46] it and when he come to dwell in
[1:29:49] it then he will do his own will
[1:29:54] the purpose for which he has brought you
[1:29:56] on
[1:29:57] Earth because we are all we've all been
[1:30:00] brought here for a
[1:30:02] purpose and that building that you God
[1:30:05] is
[1:30:06] building you occupy the position this
[1:30:10] sister occupies a position this brother
[1:30:13] occupies a
[1:30:15] position and the position that you
[1:30:18] occupy in the
[1:30:22] body shows the type of person you
[1:30:26] are because the position I
[1:30:29] occupy it may be different from that of
[1:30:32] brother brother
[1:30:35] Wong and
[1:30:38] God process according to our
[1:30:41] position now when brother Bram came on
[1:30:45] Earth he occupied a unique
[1:30:49] position and in the message experience
[1:30:52] he preached 1947
[1:30:55] he was in Phoenix
[1:30:57] preaching he prayed and after that a
[1:31:01] brother
[1:31:02] came and when the brother came he spoke
[1:31:06] some
[1:31:07] words he said he has been in a Ministry
[1:31:10] for about 35 years but he has never seen
[1:31:13] a man as humble as brother
[1:31:18] Bram and he said this
[1:31:22] man the the trial that he go
[1:31:27] through the way Satan comes against
[1:31:31] him is more than against any other
[1:31:36] preacher because he was the messenger of
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:39] age he was the pastor of the
[1:31:44] age and as the messenger of the age all
[1:31:49] hell will turn against
[1:31:51] him because he was carrying against
[1:31:56] gift and when you are carrying a gift of
[1:32:00] God Satan comes against you that's
[1:32:04] right and the gift that brother Bram was
[1:32:07] carrying was a unique type of
[1:32:11] gift and Satan was against him why
[1:32:16] because that gift was to bring
[1:32:19] Deliverance to the children of God
[1:32:24] now your pastor here you don't know what
[1:32:27] he goes
[1:32:29] through brother Abram was talking about
[1:32:32] brother
[1:32:33] Neville he said I have a little bit
[1:32:35] Insight of what brother Neville goes
[1:32:38] through because he has that gift of
[1:32:42] discernment brother Neville goes through
[1:32:44] things yes he never speaks of
[1:32:48] them and the prophet through
[1:32:52] discernment he knows what he goes
[1:32:55] through and if the prophet of God has to
[1:32:59] go through those
[1:33:01] things what about you and
[1:33:05] I because we are building a spiritual
[1:33:08] house for the Living God to come and
[1:33:11] dwell
[1:33:12] in now today the battle today is a
[1:33:17] battle of
[1:33:18] possession possession of what of our
[1:33:21] souls
[1:33:25] God want to dwell in our
[1:33:27] souls and Satan is also fighting for
[1:33:33] that but as predestinated children of
[1:33:37] God no matter what Satan
[1:33:40] does we overcome am am am we will
[1:33:45] Triumph amen amen but you must know who
[1:33:50] you
[1:33:51] are amen and when you know who you
[1:33:56] are he gives you
[1:33:58] confidence he gives you
[1:34:01] Faith to be able to
[1:34:04] persevere Paul he knew who he
[1:34:10] was he knew that he was Call of
[1:34:13] God and all that he went
[1:34:16] through he knew that the God who has
[1:34:19] called
[1:34:19] him will fight for
[1:34:22] him amen will see him
[1:34:27] through as a little group
[1:34:31] here don't
[1:34:33] fret amen stay with the word of
[1:34:37] Goden and one important thing is this
[1:34:41] stay with your
[1:34:43] pastor if he has led you thus
[1:34:48] far trust
[1:34:50] God that he will lead you through amen
[1:34:54] and
[1:34:55] today there are many things going on you
[1:34:59] see people Living Church no we are going
[1:35:02] to do this we are going to stay with the
[1:35:05] tapes or listen to
[1:35:07] tapes but the tape that they are
[1:35:09] listening said what they must have a
[1:35:12] church that they call
[1:35:17] home they must have a church where they
[1:35:20] support with their
[1:35:22] presence their offering
[1:35:24] and they are
[1:35:26] tight that is what the tape
[1:35:29] says stay with your
[1:35:31] pastor and together build that spiritual
[1:35:37] house with with
[1:35:39] him and if you do that you stay with the
[1:35:43] instruction of the
[1:35:44] Prophet you see this little church
[1:35:47] little group here in uh
[1:35:50] Minneapolis will be the lighthous yes of
[1:35:54] Minneapolis Amen brother Bram in the
[1:35:57] message a
[1:35:59] guide was saying this he said don't
[1:36:02] forget now always remember this that
[1:36:07] these are the things that build the
[1:36:11] servant of Christ see Faith
[1:36:15] first then
[1:36:17] virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit
[1:36:22] cannot cap the the building of
[1:36:25] God until these things are operating by
[1:36:31] the
[1:36:33] spirit remember faith is the first
[1:36:38] one that is the new
[1:36:41] birth then you are only in position of
[1:36:46] growth then when you have the faith then
[1:36:49] you cannot act upon it
[1:36:54] a child who is not born how can he
[1:36:59] grow he
[1:37:01] cannot but first the condition of growth
[1:37:04] is
[1:37:06] what new a birth that's right if you are
[1:37:10] not born how can you
[1:37:14] grow you see so when you are born again
[1:37:18] you are only in the position of growth
[1:37:21] now then you'll be able to add
[1:37:24] to
[1:37:26] that and the prophet of God is saying
[1:37:30] faith is the first thing he said you
[1:37:33] should remember that see Faith first
[1:37:37] then
[1:37:38] virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit
[1:37:42] cannot cap the building of God until
[1:37:47] these things are operating by the
[1:37:51] spirit no matter what you do see those
[1:37:56] are the things that he that builds the
[1:38:01] body of Christ see those things now
[1:38:06] don't forget
[1:38:08] that that is here is first faith is your
[1:38:14] faith virtue knowledge and so forth is
[1:38:19] to be added to it until the complete
[1:38:25] stature of Christ is made
[1:38:29] manifest then the Holy Spirit
[1:38:32] comes upon it and seals it as one
[1:38:37] body these things must be therefore
[1:38:43] Jesus said by their fruits they are
[1:38:47] known see
[1:38:50] fruits you could not bear fruit without
[1:38:54] these things to Bear to Bear it in you
[1:38:58] and then when all this takes the
[1:39:03] place of
[1:39:05] we and
[1:39:08] ungodliness and so forth then all
[1:39:11] unbelief is cast out then all the things
[1:39:17] of the world is pass
[1:39:20] away then there is nothing
[1:39:24] but a new
[1:39:25] creature in Christ and then Ephesians
[1:39:29] 4:30 says gri not the holy spirit of God
[1:39:35] whereby you are sealed to the day of
[1:39:38] your
[1:39:39] Redemption sealed unto the kingdom of
[1:39:42] God now don't forget keep that in
[1:39:47] mind now take these things first then
[1:39:52] Sealing is the Holy Spirit the cup that
[1:39:57] seals us onto the body that's
[1:40:02] right and again I want to say don't
[1:40:06] forget the new
[1:40:08] birth Faith
[1:40:11] first is the
[1:40:14] foundation then you can build on
[1:40:18] it and building upon it doesn't take a
[1:40:21] day
[1:40:24] for some it can take many
[1:40:28] years is according to the
[1:40:32] calling you see we are called
[1:40:36] differently we are called to to occupy
[1:40:39] different position in the
[1:40:45] building do you get what I'm
[1:40:49] saying because the more the trial
[1:40:55] shows the kind of
[1:40:57] calling that God has called
[1:41:01] you what one go through you might not go
[1:41:05] through what I go through you might not
[1:41:08] go
[1:41:10] through some go through deep
[1:41:13] trials some through the flood some
[1:41:17] through
[1:41:18] fire but all of us through the blood
[1:41:21] that's right praise the Lord
[1:41:25] it's according to our
[1:41:27] positions now if you take a building
[1:41:30] that is being put
[1:41:32] up
[1:41:34] sometimes the Architects they have to
[1:41:37] take the sample of the
[1:41:39] soil send it to the
[1:41:42] laboratory study
[1:41:44] it what kind of materials are in
[1:41:49] there and when they are able to find
[1:41:51] that they'll know know the sort of
[1:41:54] foundation to put up
[1:41:58] there you see now when there there is a
[1:42:02] rock in that place they need a sort of
[1:42:06] concrete that will have to go in
[1:42:09] there now you see some building you see
[1:42:12] that it will take 6 months for them to
[1:42:15] build the
[1:42:18] foundation some might take about two
[1:42:21] months it depends on the quality of the
[1:42:24] soil that is
[1:42:28] there you remember the prophet of go
[1:42:30] preached the message uh I forgot the
[1:42:34] title where they had to put a bridge in
[1:42:40] Australia and Engineers came from
[1:42:42] different places some said no I cannot
[1:42:45] build
[1:42:47] it but the one that came from
[1:42:50] UK he went there and to the some
[1:42:54] post under the river
[1:42:56] bed and he came no I can build this
[1:43:03] brid and he went on and built the
[1:43:07] bridge and when they buil the bridge was
[1:43:11] built there was a railway line on
[1:43:15] it yeah and the
[1:43:18] engineer had to walk on a on a bridge
[1:43:22] with a railway way following
[1:43:25] it and when they saw that everything was
[1:43:29] strong what was it the mayor of the city
[1:43:33] have to come to inaugurate the
[1:43:38] bridge and the building that you are
[1:43:42] building when it is
[1:43:45] complete the owner of the house will
[1:43:48] come and test it
[1:43:51] you if it is well
[1:43:55] built then you
[1:43:58] commment this is my
[1:44:01] son in whom I'm well
[1:44:04] placed to dwell
[1:44:07] in then you'll be
[1:44:10] adopted into the family as he did the
[1:44:13] Lord Jesus
[1:44:15] Christ when he took Peter James and
[1:44:18] John to the mount that
[1:44:21] day and the voice
[1:44:24] came this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:44:30] pleased to dwell
[1:44:32] in why he came to do the will of
[1:44:37] God he never failed anything that the
[1:44:40] father asked him to
[1:44:42] do because he said I do nothing until I
[1:44:48] see my father do
[1:44:50] it and every child of God his desire is
[1:44:55] to do the will of
[1:44:57] God his desire is to build a spiritual
[1:45:01] house for the Living God to come and
[1:45:05] dwell
[1:45:07] in what stage are you in your building
[1:45:12] today are you using the certified
[1:45:16] materials which is the word of
[1:45:19] God because the word has been certified
[1:45:24] the Holy Ghost has satified the
[1:45:28] word and if you building that
[1:45:31] building then must use the certified
[1:45:35] word he has
[1:45:37] proven that his word will never
[1:45:40] fail and that is the
[1:45:43] material that we are using today to
[1:45:47] build the living
[1:45:49] house for the Living God
[1:45:53] I'll stop here God bless
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:46:12] you
[1:46:14] bless
[1:46:16] Beau Wednesday night praise the Lord
[1:46:19] we'll have more of that on on Sunday
[1:46:22] praise the Lord
[1:46:25] and been poor for a very long time let
[1:46:29] me a few things from you as I just U
[1:46:33] encourage you from what our brother was
[1:46:34] speaking tonight you know David said
[1:46:37] something in the psalm he said uh Psalm
[1:46:39] 127 except the Lord built the house the
[1:46:43] man they buil it he build it in vain
[1:46:46] amen so what I want you to know like our
[1:46:49] brother is saying
[1:46:51] tonight uh God is not building apartment
[1:46:55] buildings okay and the matter of fact
[1:46:59] there is that you are not the one that
[1:47:00] is
[1:47:01] building you have to know that you are
[1:47:05] just a
[1:47:06] material you are not the Builder you are
[1:47:09] not the one that is building it's just
[1:47:11] like Solomon Temple you know the uh ENT
[1:47:15] evangelism brother brandom says uh uh
[1:47:18] all of these years we've been Gathering
[1:47:21] Stones now
[1:47:23] now what God is actually doing he's
[1:47:26] shaping those
[1:47:28] stones for it to fit in the
[1:47:31] building okay he's cutting all the ESS
[1:47:34] out of us the ESS habit the essess
[1:47:38] weaknesses the ESS nature for us to fit
[1:47:42] into that
[1:47:44] building you see everything that was
[1:47:46] done in the Old
[1:47:49] Testament all the
[1:47:51] prophets were successful to build only
[1:47:54] one building that was Jesus
[1:47:58] Christ as God says uh you know this is
[1:48:01] my son I'm well pleased to do it so
[1:48:03] everything the whole Old Testament did
[1:48:06] it was enough to achieve that building
[1:48:10] and in this age or in this in the New
[1:48:13] Covenant from Paul and everything they
[1:48:15] have been doing was building one
[1:48:17] building and that's the bride
[1:48:19] building to make a bride body
[1:48:23] you see that's the reason why people
[1:48:25] think that they have their personal
[1:48:28] revelation they have their individual
[1:48:31] way that God no no God is not building
[1:48:34] you as a person by yourself no he's
[1:48:38] building a building he's building a
[1:48:40] barding he's building a
[1:48:42] house it's a bride house am you are not
[1:48:47] an individual building standing by
[1:48:49] yourself that's the reason why you can't
[1:48:51] run your individual life you don't have
[1:48:53] your individual uh H Revelation
[1:48:58] no it's not an individual work God is
[1:49:00] doing it's a building work and brother B
[1:49:02] told us that the hardest thing in
[1:49:05] building is to turn the
[1:49:08] corner it's hard that's the hardest
[1:49:10] thing if it is just putting walls it's
[1:49:12] easy running the walls is very easy but
[1:49:16] when you want to make
[1:49:18] rooms you want to make the dining room
[1:49:20] big the kitchen big you got to turn
[1:49:24] corners and that is the thing that gets
[1:49:26] tough for
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:29] us because we we we get so used to one
[1:49:33] way of doing things when God want to
[1:49:35] turn Corners in our
[1:49:38] lives that's why he allowed us to go
[1:49:41] through the things that we go through
[1:49:43] because he want to turn Corners let me
[1:49:45] show you something h h a beautiful
[1:49:47] thought brother Paul spoke on today uh
[1:49:50] this evening let me let me show you
[1:49:51] something he talks about the birth
[1:49:54] feeding and
[1:49:55] growth studying the message uh uh statue
[1:49:59] of a perfect
[1:50:00] man many
[1:50:05] times
[1:50:07] uh slow that a little bit uh uh brother
[1:50:10] arel many times uh uh people think what
[1:50:15] what Peter said add onto your faith that
[1:50:19] word makes us to feel like it's
[1:50:22] something we need to do
[1:50:26] no that's the reason why the principle
[1:50:29] is birth faed and
[1:50:34] grow you can't you can't give birth to
[1:50:37] yourself something has to give birth to
[1:50:40] you look in Genesis let's just read
[1:50:42] Genesis uh uh 3024 tonight and
[1:50:46] uh this kind of a settled this thought
[1:50:50] of that principle
[1:50:52] Genesis 30 see what happened here when
[1:50:57] uh when When Rachel gave birth when
[1:51:00] Joseph was born now you have to realize
[1:51:03] brother B said Joseph was the was the
[1:51:05] fourth Cornerstone amen when God was
[1:51:08] being his Old Testament spiritual house
[1:51:10] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph was the
[1:51:13] four the four Cornerstone that that he
[1:51:17] laid down but look at this verse it will
[1:51:19] it will help us tonight to be able to
[1:51:22] understand something here there uh
[1:51:24] that's uh Genesis 30:
[1:51:27] 24 you will appreciate what brother Paul
[1:51:30] was bringing to us
[1:51:32] tonight the Bible said verse 22 and God
[1:51:35] remember Rachel and God he him to her
[1:51:38] and opened her womb and she conceived
[1:51:40] and bear a son and said God has taken
[1:51:43] away my reproach verse 24 watch now she
[1:51:47] the Bible says and she called his name
[1:51:51] Joseph
[1:51:52] and said the Lord shall
[1:52:00] add now that I will add the Lord shall
[1:52:04] add so when when Peter say add unto your
[1:52:08] faith it's not what you
[1:52:11] do it's not what you going to
[1:52:15] do because you are not the Builder you
[1:52:18] are not the one building this if you are
[1:52:21] the one building your your your
[1:52:23] spiritual house that is the reason why
[1:52:25] it is the way it is because you are
[1:52:27] building
[1:52:30] it she said the Lord shall
[1:52:36] add so the same God that brings Faith by
[1:52:40] the new birth is the same God that
[1:52:43] brings virtue when you are feeding on
[1:52:46] the
[1:52:48] word now when you are making things up
[1:52:50] by yourself when you are F him the Lord
[1:52:54] shall add he V you and you see the thing
[1:52:58] there is that it is not an individual
[1:53:01] think no is a body think just like
[1:53:05] brother Paul was talking about our
[1:53:06] different strength and our different
[1:53:08] trial you see the thing is it's
[1:53:10] something that God gives to the
[1:53:15] body praise the Lord you find bunch of
[1:53:19] people trying to impersonate V you you
[1:53:21] know brother say to get V you you know I
[1:53:24] I need to get vet you it it just it just
[1:53:26] him
[1:53:28] workout it is not you iding it has to be
[1:53:32] the Lord that is
[1:53:33] hiding and how is he
[1:53:37] hiding is through our feeding on the
[1:53:41] word
[1:53:43] yes feeding on the word staying on the
[1:53:46] right
[1:53:49] atmosphere that's the first time the
[1:53:51] word ad is you used in the Bible this
[1:53:53] this verse that we just
[1:53:58] read if if it was the Lord that add it
[1:54:01] it has to be God that will add this vud
[1:54:03] to the
[1:54:05] church he brought it in a spiritual form
[1:54:07] through the seven Church
[1:54:10] ages now he's bringing it imortal
[1:54:13] spiritual form it's for the entire
[1:54:15] body it is not for you as an individual
[1:54:18] because you are not an apartment God not
[1:54:20] building apartment houses
[1:54:23] he's building a build a a body it's a
[1:54:26] body that he's
[1:54:29] building you are just one stone that
[1:54:33] need to fit in that body and for God to
[1:54:36] get you to your place he need to cut all
[1:54:39] the asss and sh
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:56] so the principle is
[1:54:59] birth birth is the one that brought the
[1:55:06] faith it's
[1:55:09] birth and let me let me tell you
[1:55:12] something whatever you are feeding on
[1:55:14] shows the kind of a birth you have
[1:55:16] that's
[1:55:19] right praise the Lord whatever you are
[1:55:22] feeding on shows the kind of a birth you
[1:55:36] have we love the Lord
[1:55:38] tonight we want to thank the Lord for
[1:55:40] the word we look we look forward for
[1:55:43] more on
[1:55:45] Sunday good to have brother Paul
[1:55:48] here give me a little bit of a break
[1:55:51] here but
[1:55:52] uh sit down and and enjoy the word just
[1:55:55] like you praise the Lord amen
[1:55:59] amen glory be to God David said except

[1:56:17] praying you can do all your religion
[1:56:19] that you want to do except God is
[1:56:21] building it
[1:56:23] house so that's the reason why we have
[1:56:25] to realize we need to submit ourself in
[1:56:28] his hands he's the one that is doing the
[1:56:35] building let's stand on our feet
