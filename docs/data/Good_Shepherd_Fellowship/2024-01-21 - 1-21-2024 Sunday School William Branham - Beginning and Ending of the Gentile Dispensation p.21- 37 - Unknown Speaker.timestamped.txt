[5:41] walked and poured water on the hands of
[5:43] the Prophet a great position he had but
[5:47] when he seen the the Syrian Army All
[5:51] Around dolphin had it all backed up he
[5:54] said my father look out there what a
[5:57] great number what while we're
[6:00] surrounded now that's sin natural
[6:03] whenever things seems to go wrong part

[6:09] the doctor says you can't get well and
[6:11] so forth that's just the natural thing

[6:55] that Syrian Army by the Thousand the
[6:58] mountains is on fire
[7:00] angels of fire horses of fire Chariots
[7:04] of Fire and the Bible said the angels of
[7:07] God encamp about those who fear Him just
[7:11] the same tonight I wonder what would
[7:14] happen if a man here tonight had the
[7:16] power to strike across your eyes and say
[7:18] look standing around this Tabernacle
[7:20] tonight you'll be a member here the rest
[7:23] of your life sure Hallelujah yes sir
[7:28] sometimes you can't see with your
[7:29] natural eyes but you can feel the
[7:31] impulse of it something near a sick
[7:35] sense that denotes something is near
[7:38] watch him this morning opening up the
[7:41] deaf ears making the PO old cripples
[7:43] walk around here like there was nothing
[7:45] wrong with them what is it it's the
[7:48] incense I mean the sense the six sense
[7:52] it's conscious the spirit that something
[7:55] is
[7:56] there have faith in God now they didn't
[8:01] he didn't see that first but Elijah
[8:03] probably didn't see it but he asked for
[8:06] the boy's eyes to see it but Elisha was
[8:09] conscious that they were there amen amen
[8:12] amen Thomas one time said let me put my
[8:15] hands in his side Jesus said now you see
[8:18] and believe how much greater is their
[8:19] reward who has never yet seen and yet
[8:21] believe amen that's us tonight and
[8:24] whosoever will believe without seen and
[8:27] notice then El walked out there to where
[8:30] this circumstance was and he said to
[8:33] them first he went out there and the
[8:36] Bible said he smok them
[8:38] blind blind and walked right out to him
[8:42] everyone had perfect eyesight as far as
[8:44] I know but the scripture said they were
[8:46] blind amen amen a little fell a few
[8:50] nights ago said to me if you be a man of
[8:53] God smite me blind I said you're already
[8:55] blind

[9:03] where this great circumstance was this
[9:06] great thing was and he said do you look
[9:09] for Elijah said yes said come on follow
[9:12] me I'll take you right to him Elijah
[9:15] said it to them what was they blind
[9:17] about they were blind to the fact that
[9:19] that was the prophet of God they were
[9:22] blind to it and he led them right
[9:25] straight down in the Ambush again amen
[9:29] said come on I'll show you Elijah and it
[9:31] was Elijah taking them down there and

[9:52] principle today de feed your enemy amen
[9:56] do good to those that do evil to you
[9:59] amen Holy Name there now the blindness
[10:04] now Elijah I mean not Elijah now but
[10:07] Daniel Daniel fora he was a prophet he
[10:12] saw the coming of the Lord he saw the
[10:16] end time come he saw the Gentiles start
[10:20] and if you notice the Gentiles started
[10:23] off with
[10:24] a uh idol
[10:27] worship they is wor in a great Idol
[10:30] setting out in the field an idol of a
[10:33] man I believe Daniel
[10:36] himself because King Nebuchadnezzar had
[10:39] called him Bel toer which was his
[10:42] God and he started to Worship in an
[10:45] image of a righteous holy man and Daniel
[10:50] refused to do it so did the the Hebrew
[10:53] children the Shadrach mishak and abedo
[10:56] that's the way it was issued in and it
[11:00] was condemned that head of gold was
[11:03] issued in by image worship forced to it
[11:07] and ended up in a supernatural hand
[11:11] writing a supernatural language that
[11:13] only Supernatural understanding could
[11:16] understand it amen that's the way the
[11:20] Gentile Kingdom issued in and go out the
[11:22] same
[11:24] way by Supernatural Works Supernatural
[11:28] inter
[11:31] interpretation amen you know what I'm
[11:33] talking about the working of the
[11:37] supernatural amen oh how marvelous

[11:54] depended yet on the Jews he said the
[11:57] Messiah shall come he'll prophesy in the
[12:00] 70th weeks which is 3 and 1/2 years in
[12:02] the midst of it he'll be cut off which

[19:18] great Prince shall stand up for what for
[19:21] thy people amen
[19:24] amen all right and many of them
[19:29] that sleep in the dust of the Earth
[19:32] shall awake when when these times take
[19:38] place and some to everlasting life and
[19:42] some to shame and everlasting
[19:45] contentment just as sure as there's an

[19:49] departure amen it determines on how you
[19:53] treat Jesus Christ in your life amen if

[20:05] of Life you have Immortal Life if it's
[20:08] not written there you'll not be
[20:10] recognized what is it all those
[20:13] prophecies are fulfilled everything
[20:16] right down to this
[20:18] time the head of gold has passed away as
[20:21] Daniel said it would the Babylonian
[20:24] Kingdom succeeding that he said would be
[20:26] the Ms and persas they succeeded the
[20:29] Babylonian Kingdom and they fell away to
[20:32] who the grecians Alexander the Great and
[20:35] they fell away to what the Romans and
[20:38] the Romans broke up to all the world
[20:40] eastern and western Rome the two legs
[20:42] and he said Iron and Clay was on the
[20:44] toes the 10 toes the 10 kingdoms and he
[20:48] said they wouldn't mix that inary among
[20:50] one another romanism and protestantism
[20:55] and in that day when this thing exist
[20:59] then the stone was shoot out of the
[21:01] mountain without hands and rolled in it
[21:03] broke the thing to pieces and it took
[21:06] the place of the image so my brethren
[21:09] we're having troubles tonight
[21:12] Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and
[21:16] diverse places perplex of time distress
[21:19] between nations I've just come back from
[21:22] overseas and I haven't seen a nation but
[21:26] what's trembling in their
[21:29] they don't know what's going to take
[21:30] place next but aren't we thankful
[21:34] tonight that we do know what's going to
[21:36] take place next the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:38] shall come the second time in glory and
[21:41] majesty and every this town written in
[21:44] the Lamb's Book of Life shall rise with
[21:46] their loved ones to meet the Lord amen
[21:49] oh what a marvelous
[21:52] thing that's the reason we say our hope
[21:54] is built on nothing less than Jesus
[21:56] blood with righteousness amen All Around
[21:59] My Soul gives way he's our hope and
[22:02] state and at that time Michael should
[22:05] stand the great Prince Michael was
[22:07] Christ of course who fought the Angelic
[22:09] Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and
[22:12] Michael fought together or fought
[22:14] against each other brother and now and
[22:17] at that time he said as many was found
[22:19] written in the book was delivered and
[22:22] those who have done righteous watch this
[22:26] and they that
[22:28] and they that be
[22:31] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[22:34] the
[22:35] Furman and as the and they that turn
[22:40] away man your rightness as the Stars
[22:45] forever I look at that sometime I think
[22:49] Brethren I go out of the morning I love
[22:52] to get up early don't you like to rise
[22:55] early I remember when brother and I were
[22:58] in the mountains real early in the
[23:00] morning around 4:00 we'd rise up look
[23:02] hanging back there and there was a
[23:04] Morning
[23:05] Star it gets real dark just before the
[23:09] break of day we see the darkness
[23:12] Gathering now what is it it's light
[23:16] pressing against the darkness one has to
[23:18] give away all the creeping things that's
[23:21] been running through the night when that
[23:23] sun comes up they take to shelter when
[23:26] the light shines
[23:28] night and dark night and light cannot
[23:32] exist in the same building it's either
[23:35] dark or it's light and light is so much
[23:38] more powerful in darkness so is Christ
[23:41] so much more powerful in all the the
[23:43] world Amen prise now we're taught by
[23:47] scientists as the light begins to come
[23:49] it condenses the darkness and the
[23:51] Darkness gathers all its host together
[23:54] to fight against the light but the light
[23:57] prevails and comes on Amen and the Bible
[23:59] said the last
[24:04] [Music]
[24:13] days
