hallelujah thank you musicians that was beautiful that was beautiful thank you thank you for giving us an entrance to the word this morning amen the Lord bless you as we remain standing let's take our Bibles and uh we read and then we allow you to S sit in the comfort of your seats Amen in Luke chapter 10 in Luke chapter 10 it's in Luke chapter 10 we want to do something this morning where we just want to remind ourself uh it's in Luke chapter 10 praise the lord we greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus it's good to see the grace of God on your faces amen hallelujah praise the lord it's in Luke chapter 10 Let's uh let's read something about the foundation of the church in Luke chapter 10 we will read from verse 17 we will read from verse 17 we went over this before I I'm trusting the Lord to be able to bring it in a different way because that's the only thing we do in preaching the same message in many different ways praise the Lord so Luke chapter 10 verse 17 and the 7th returned again with joy they returned again with joy Joy saying Lord even the Devils were subject unto us through his name now what I want us to realize is this is before the atonement this is before Jesus Paid the price this is before even the Holy Ghost came and here is the devil being subject to the church so even with the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost the devil is subject to the church amen without the Holy Ghost the devil is subject to you praise the Lord that's what I want you us to realize this morning The 7even Returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them this is Jesus I beheld Satan as Laing fall from Heaven praise the Lord so it's a continuous falling Isaiah Isaiah told us uh you know how he was cast in from cast from heaven so it's a continuous falling and brother bam says that's what the bottomless pit is it has no resting so it's a continuous falling so even at the beginning of the church before the atonement was given before the the promise of the Holy Ghost uh came Satan is falling because there's a group of people here that is taking position with the word of the hour amen there's a group of people here that have identified that Jesus was the Messiah that that was the promised word of the hour so what makes the devil to fall is your position with the word praise the Lord verse 19 we read behold I gave unto you power to tread down serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you praise the Lord not withstanding in this Rejoice net but the obvious is that's what we rejoice in but Jesus says that's not what we should rejoice in Praise the Lord amen not so much of how the devil is subject to us you know now so much of uh you know uh uh how much we Fe the the holy ghost moving in our vein like an electric now we're standing in this Rejoice net that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven praise the Lord and in that hour Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the the wise in prudent and have re them unto babes even so father for so it seems good in that sight amen let's pray together father We Just Want to Thank You Lord that this morning we can realize no matter how much revelation we have we are babes because you said to babes these things are revealed oh God help us Lord to see our Litt help us to see father where you want us to be oh God we just love you this morning we appreciate you father thank you uh for your presence Lord that is Hing over us we just ask that now come break the word to our hearts please Lord let something be said this morning that will encourage us that will bring us closer to you we love you we appreciate you father we will also remember remember the many that are now with us this morning that are joining us oh Father Lord streaming the service that we stream the service later oh God the ones that travel we want to remember them Father Lord Brother Andrew sister chrisan Lord we pray that your Grace will be with them thank you Father for granting brother Ben and his family a trip in the middle of the week Lord father we just we we we just want to thank you for the things that you are doing in our midst Lord we just ask your blessing this morning now in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord praise the lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning like I said there are few things that we want to go after over there are few things that we want to go over and uh uh it's uh it's uh we we want to pray and ask that the Lord will just minister to us this morning amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah if you are not happy just wait a while maybe the Lord will do something special for you and make you happy praise the Lord amen praise the Lord good to see you brother desima amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen you know it's is this time of the year the the weather is changing we're getting into to summer summer is always a busy time praise the Lord and uh so uh we you know we we plan a lot of things uh uh you know to to get across the street greet the neighbors and you know and different things we want to do so but as a church there are few things also we want to go after over over if you realize we've been uh couple of weeks we've been go playing the church all uh uh uh uh both uh the first and uh and and also the the second Church order there and uh uh the reason we're doing it is because uh we just want to remind ourself amen we want to remind ourself and uh uh so there are few things I want to go over before I get into what I want to share with you this morning but it's all part of uh it's all part of the word it's all part of the word because uh just like we have read to you this morning you see that Jesus right from the from the emphasis of the church you know from uh the very beginning of the church before even the uh the church will be set in order or the you know the Holy Ghost will come he's he's trying to positionally place the people what they should pay attention to praise the Lord what they should pay attention to and with with uh uh uh you know uh without there a lot of those things even went over the heads of the disciples but when the Holy Ghost came then the Holy Ghost started to remind them of the things that Jesus said because that's what he said the Holy Ghost would do it would bring to it would bring us to remembrance amen it will bring to remembrance the things that were said so this morning uh just for the little exhortation we want to speak on rejoicing in the truth rejoicing in the truth Rejoice now because uh demons are subject unto you but Rejoice because your name is written in heaven praise the Lord so we want to we want to speak on rejoicing in the truth that's that's actually where our joy is it's in the truth it's in the revealed word it's in the things that God is revealing to us as we are seeing our trueu identity praise the Lord but before we go into that like I said we've been impl the church order I want to go over few things that I think are very necessary for us as a church one of the things there is that that I have seen that is not only with this local assembly is something that is that is becoming you know uh uh uh uh everywhere is becoming in everywhere and uh uh what I've been paying attention to as we we've been playing this uh uh series of the church order is How We Begin our service how the service begin very very important because you remember at the beginning of the year we took a series on in the beginning and we said the beginning of everything is very important how the service begins how are we being instructed to begin the service is very important praise the Lord because no matter what we do we can blast the music we can run around the art if we don't have a good beginning we would just go home so tired amen it would just be all of our flesh in it and we year for one purpose and is to Worship the Lord amen we want to see him coming down in our midst we want to see you know uh uh the the the the effect of his presence we want to see God moving in a special way praise the Lord are we together so uh uh as as as uh went back steing through the the message of the hour I realized that one thing that is beginning to to to be overlooked is uh uh you know brother Brandon said uh uh you know when when those doors are open he says uh you know if we have the grace to to wait until those doors are open this morning you will see that he uh they were playing the second Church order I think the 1963 series and much of that brother brandom spent on talking about gifts and Ministry he talking about different Ministry the people with gifts of speaking in tongues prophecy and all of that so if you go to that one you will see a whole lot of that but what I pick up this morning while I was in the office listening as well he also identify he says those things are Ministry and and and we have a Ministry of opening the service and that Ministry is to come and uh and pray the 30 minutes of the service is actually when those doors open and we come into the building the truth of the matter there is that the service has already began the people that open the Service are the people that come and pray they come they s they pray you are actually opening the the service praise the Lord you will soon see where I'm going with this you you are actually opening the service and you see it's a it's a kind of a Ministry that is overlooked praise the Lord and sometimes it thinks we think that they have so much time on their hands and they come early but that's when the service opens because what I have realized and we will look through the scripture a little bit is that uh this last day church I'm talking about the church the last day Church brother brand want us to watch the last day Spirit the last day church has changed the order of worship the order of worship in the scripture is prayer the word before praise praise the Lord amen why because praise is uh is is the people are rejoicing in their Victory when the soldiers are going to war that's why we sang their son God has an army and in that Army I am a part praise the Lord I hope you are a part too amen when the when when when the men are about to go to war you find that they you know the the they are they concentrated they thinking you know their minds and it's after the battle is over they comes back rejoicing you know because they have won the victory so that is that is the thing I have seen twisted around and most of that has come from our church word praise the Lord amen most of that has come from the church world because uh uh you know uh uh uh in the way that things have been set up and the way that they do it there is that uh you know uh uh we we we we play the music We Sing We we get the people rejoicing and worshiping the Lord you know uh uh and then we preach the word and then what happened is that uh after uh you know uh we prayed so the word you know can take effect in our life Lord you know uh let the word have that but you see the thing that is that you are not the planting of the word you the planter of the word praise the Lord as as as we sit under the word and the word being preached to us it is almost like the natural food that we eat when we eat that food chew it and send it down as it enter into our system God has designed our system to be able to take the different parts of the food and distribute it to our body so there's a whole lot that goes on in our stomach than in our mouth we have to do a good work to break it down and chew it but when it gets in our stomach God have set an other of how the nutrients will be pulled out and What needs to go to the blood what the liver would you know will benefit from and what the different cells our of our body would benefit from and then what our body don't need God also have designed it how to get it out of our system praise the Lord and that is the same way that he deals with his church when the word is preached and we receive the word he have already designed and assigned the Holy Ghost how to be able to allow Thy word to deal with us praise the Lord amen most of the time we think they are the I'm not I'm not blasting against this don't don't I'm really been praying this weekend Lord let the people not misunderstand me praise the Lord amen and uh uh uh in as much as uh you know uh the the the the the the the beauty the joy we want to remind ourself when when we take notes that's a beautiful thing to do you take that into your own meditation you go around it but that is not when the Holy Ghost is dealing with you praise the Lord amen when we sit under the word uh uh uh uh in Mark chapter 5 the Bible says what Jesus taught why he taught why the the the teaching of the world was going on he says the people were healed are we together so I I get in preaching and then get out of what I want what what the way I wanted to St so uh the thing about it there is that uh uh you know is uh we we we want to be grateful you know and appreciate you know those that the Lord has given the grace that has been you know that that are able to come you know early and and just sit in their seats pray for the service thank the Lord for being here you know bringing us here pray for those that are on their way coming as as uh you know uh uh uh as humble and simple that I say is very very important for this service praise the Lord many times we think is when the song leader comes up here that's when the service begin no one thing you will now find in the church order looking both of them you find it please bring it to me I'm learning also brother Bram never talks about opening prayer you'll never find it in the church order why because the T Mees is the opening prayer you are opening the service praise the Lord it is just as important when you come walk through those doors and and you sit to your seat or kneel down whichever position you take and commit the service in the hands of the Lord it is just as important as if a brother says brother Steven or brother Hillary please come and open the Service the service has already been open it has already been open praise the Lord now you will see that is the reason why he says the people comes into the Tabernacle 30 minutes you know sit down prayed he says read the Bible or you know as the Lord will place on your heart he says and let the organist begins to play praise the Lord let the organist begin to pray play now the church word has given us a a a system where you know it's it's written down you go in the denomination churches you will find other of service order of service opening prayer first scripture reading second scripture reading choir special and that those are the order of service praise the Lord are we together so what happened is that uh uh uh uh because that uh uh ton time that that meditation time we call it is is is being overlooked so many of the times when we come and open the Service in the way that we've been doing it you find that not only this Tabernacle you find it many places around the message praise the Lord then a brother we say what you know what brother Joel pleas uh we ask brother Joel to come and open the Service he comes up you know Lord thank you for being here we invite your spirit Lord you know we rebuke the devil from Over the people Lord God and uh we just uh you know uh that's wonderful but that's what the T me is for because that is the order of worship I will show you something in the book of Acts Acts chapter 16 let's look there I don't want to get out of track this morning but uh uh I want to do my best to be able to ask chapter 16 we'll ask the preachers to preach but uh for now we had a good service with brother dicks last week amen we had a good service just like I said Wednesday night I forget to ask him to leave that amen thing with me praise the Lord I forgot to ask him because the way he printed it out if he will have left it here you would never forget any time I lift that thing up you will noce Brother D if I do my own it will be an impersonation Acts chapter 16 let's look at verse 16 Acts chapter 16 verse 16 and it came to pass as we went to prayer watch this now as we went to prayer a setting Dam it possessed with uh a spirit or divination met us which brought her master much gain by SM saying praise the Lord and you know the story what happened after that Paul had to cast that Spirit out of the Gil amen I did that I I used that just to show that uh that's what praying does amen and that's why the service begin with their praying because it cleans the atmosphere praise the Lord amen it prepare the place of worship you know push back one of the one of the the the uh famous scripture that is used uh uh we sang there this morning I bless your name Paul and Salas you know uh it's it's it's right here this was the act that makes them to be arrested before they were put in prison so if if you just read that I'm I'm just trying to go over this before I get into the word this morning if you just read that and you go down to verse 25 you will see something also and at midnight Paul and Salah prayed and sang praises to the Lord so Praises don't come before prayer prayer always proceed the word word and Praises are we together and that's the reason why that time of the service is very important I told the told the the the brothers we have a uh officers meeting uh now uh officers workers which whichever way and uh uh because uh we will we try to approach it the the you know the clothes the better way that we know how to do I'm not going to uh stop some service praise the Lord don't don't think that we would not have some service no you know but uh uh I would just I would just want us to be to be very conscious of uh uh you know uh trying to approach the service the right way praise the Lord amen are we together because you know what what I've seen is that uh uh uh when and when what we have as an auth does not happen it looks like oh we begin the service and it didn't and we didn't pray amen We Begin the service and we didn't pray why because we have Overlook the prayer time if you have noticed it on that even on Wednesday night when we have have a prayer meeting what is normally done in the church word is that the message is preached on a Prayer meeting then the church goes into praying I don't approach it like that if you notice on Wednesday night we start our prayer meeting before I preach praise the Lord I remember one one time a few years ago one brother visited us and and Wednesday night I told him we having a prayer meeting you know and then uh we will have the prayer meeting and then we will call you up to preach so uh you know I came and started the service that Wednesday night and then took a few prayer requests we when he came up to preach he preach and started preparing us for prayer meeting praise the Lord and then when we when we finish uh uh when he finished preaching I came and closed the service now after the service he said I told you said you were having prayer meeting I said yeah we have prayer meeting he said Oh I thought I was going to preach before the prayer meeting we will have stay here until 11:00 are we together praise the Lord because you see it it's it's it's it's easy if you don't pay attention we we see those things we admire it and we think that it's effective and pretty soon I mean we we we want to we we we you know we want to uh uh uh you know uh because most of the time people thingss like that you know I've heard I've had people appr me says well you know we we we really don't have prayer meeting every time you say we having prayer meeting we don't have prayer meeting God people don't pray you see if we have if we have by God's grace have developed uh our individual prayer life like brother Brandon would say if we are prayed up even if we come and spend five minutes it will be effective yes praise the Lord amen because by God's grace you have already have your key how to enter we will not have to drag you to enter what brother Bram talks about prayer meeting he says there uh you know uh he he he term it as a special meeting it maybe when we set a time to you know set up a time and and you know we just want to pray that yeah that can be done but when we are bringing you know a time of a song service the preaching of the word and then there's a you know before you realize is that if if you actually want to be sincere you'll realize that after we go through worshiping the Lord the the the preacher come and and and and preach the word that your body is already exhausted praise the Lord because many times we think that it is those things that we do that make know is the work of the Holy Spirit to deal with us are we together are you understanding what I'm going this morning praise the Lord amen so you see that t minutes he says everyone you know comes and wait on their Ministry the the musicians must wait on their Ministry and they wa to wait before the Lord generally you take it through the scripture waiting means praying they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength it does not means sitting down and staring waiting in the scripture means to pray the way we wait on God is praying praise the Lord so the way we wait on our ministry is to pray and ask the Lord Lord make me the blessing this morning as I go up to lead the songs make me a blessing as I as I play the instrument and and you know and and all of that praise the Lord because all of those things are Ministry even the people that comes and open the door open the Service sit here and pray before we come in it's a Ministry those are the things where brother brandham says is the ministry behind the curtains he said the success of my Ministry is those people behind the curtains which of course is the one that we don't see we see the musician we see the the the the pastor preaching we see all of those on but the people that are behind the curtains the ones that wait on the Lord L the ones that you know that that intercede and and and and uh uh uh uh those that's the engine room that's the engine room praise the Lord that's the reason why your your car hood is covered what carry that car is that engine the engine is never seen it's behind the curtains are we together praise the Lord are we together that's the thing that create the atmosphere that's the thing that's that's the spiritual warfare those are the people that comes in and and fight the enemy and you know and and and rebuke the devil and then we we com in and you know and we go right into the the the praise and worship the preaching of the word and many times we don't realize that we don't realize even the people that do it don't realize that you have a Ministry you have a Ministry praise the Lord the burden that God will place on your heart to come early and just pray and just commit the service in the Lord sit right in your seat take your Bible it's very simple in in one sense you know you you you try to use that as your own time to prepare yourself as you are preparing yourself you are preparing the service if you listen carefully this morning he says he says just the same thing that the minister would do he must wait on the Lord praise the Lord that's the same thing you do when you come to church you wait on the Lord praise the Lord no doubt uh uh our little assembly is spread about over the city amen if if if the lord gave us Grace it would be very easy to conquer Minneapolis very very easy brother Wesley and sister uh Cara are coming from Briner uh brother Jordan and his wife coming from St Cloud brother Steven bir and his family somewhere there in Wisconsin brother Ben and his family brother uh uh desima they com in from Rochester I mean we spread about we have uh these other young people coming from Meo Minnesota is surrounded Minneapolis is surrounding it will be easy to conquer the city if we only know what we are called to do if we only know that where we are place is not just a living place but we have a responsibility praise the Lord do you believe that we can conquer this [Laughter] city so you see that that make it in a place that many drives an hour hour plus two hours to be able to make it to come to the service that's a great sacrifice that's a great sacrifice it must never be taken lightly that in this day and age where at every turning corner there is a church that a person would drive an hour an hour plus two hours just to come to this Square building praise the Lord you see and that's the reason why I think you know is it's it's it's our responsibility to be able to uh you know uh uh uh remind ourselves what we are called to do amen the day that we are not in service and and uh uh we come here Wednesday night Sunday morning unless we have a a preacher in town and do it a Saturday night s but uh just imagine we have prayers going on all around the city when you sit in your home you are not just having your own private devotion you are not just you know reading your Bible and prayed and say Lord you know pray that bless my family and all of that and then you say Lord uh remember our little church bless the brothers and sisters I mean uh I mean I mean it's it's it's that's a blessing are we together are you seeing where I'm going this morning it's a spiritual responsibility it's a Ministry it's a Ministry behind the curtains amen it's a Ministry behind the curtain so we talk we'll talk with the brothers you know because I feel that uh you know we can we can approach things a little bit different in the light of the word and then uh uh we can do it better praise the Lord does that mean we will not call a brother to come and pray yes we will do and uh what is done in uh uh most of the time is that that person should come and take up the special request maybe saints come in the right special request then Deacon should be called or one of the brothers should be called and say brother Wesley we have some special needs here can you take that to the Lord in prayer but that's not the opening of the service the service are already been open that's why when we walk through those doors we must be referenced the space back there I mean we must greet one another with a holy case that's what the scripture says but it's not a place for us to be lecturing and yelling and all of that when people are in here you know praying and you know when uh no there's not a place for us to do that you know we greet one another that yeah it must be done nicely quietly are we together praise the Lord because you see that we come in into the house of the Lord uh uh uh am I preaching this morning a different way that's so I will tell you what happened uh you know I'm trying to be very slow this morning Wednesday night I was I was actually I was very word instructed you know when I was preaching I was I was I was a little bit disturbed uh uh I've been I've been having uh you know uh changes in my body something was happening to me that I did not know what happening until the last time I went for my physical almost like uh uh like an icid reflex but I got an infection in my stomach and that's the thing that been battering my throat my voice I did not I did not know so Wednesday when I was preaching uh uh I felt a uh you know kind of a sharp pain that went through my chest twice I didn't wanted to scare you you didn't know nothing about it so I I still close to this place I said I got to hold on to this poop it if I'm about to fall you know and all of that so it really bothered me it threw me off so uh uh if you if you really observe me Wednesday night you will know that uh I was repeating myself because I was thinking what is happening here what is going on here with me twice that happened to me so Thursday I was supposed to travel for the wedding I canceled the trip and I just thought that I needed to observe myself a little bit went to uh an orent kid and and I found that it was that uh uh gas that was moving up to my heart my heart is okay they told me I could live a little bit longer so [Laughter] amen so it was that it was that gas that was moving in my in my chest but uh so uh you my wife kept asking me are you okay I said yeah I'm fine I didn't want to scare you people so and uh uh but the Lord is good amen the Lord is good the Lord is good and we thank the Lord for that so I I hope you understanding what I'm goinging this morning we we you know we have a responsibility it's not uh it's not uh you know like Jesus said you know uh it's not uh uh you know the the the shouting that we do and you know we must we must Rejoice you know like last Sunday we had a blast I just Joy how the Holy Spirit had the Liberty amen I mean we were rejoicing in the word and that is where our rejoicing should be in the word you know we must be rejoicing in the word so that's that's just a few things that I wanted to go over as we go as we go on you will you will you will realize let's look at Matthew chapter 26:3 another scripture in the Bible that is very very well overlooked and uh uh Matthew Chapter 26: 30 I could say this pray close the service and go home praise the Lord amen if you look closely this was just after the communion the Bible says here and when they had sunk a him they went out pay attention to that the entire service of the communion has already gone on Jesus has preached he has ministered the communion and then Praises came after when they have sank him the went out praise the Lord amen are we together so yeah so there they are just they are just uh you know all of those uh things we want to pay attention to you know we want to pay attention to to know that uh uh and and you know what what I've also realized is that uh sometimes it's the people that just come in the middle of the service you know and then they just feel like the service has stayed so long and they never even remember that there were people that were here before they came praise the Lord so we we will we will we will realize and and and want to appreciate you know that God has given us uh an order to be able to approach him praise the Lord amen we be he had given us an order we we want to do the best you know that's what the prophet told us he said come back to that TP play it again you know uh and and remind yourself you know as long as we stayed in this life we will be we we have been taught to be reminded and that's what I wanted to do this morning to remind you that that uh uh the order of worship look through the scripture I have a lot of scriptures written down here and uh uh has always been you know prayer has always been the preparation for the people to go into war amen and then when the people are returning back from war after the word has been preached and we been we have identified ourself with the word you know we have uh we have uh uh uh you know uh uh uh Reb nuke the enime you know and and then uh we realize we get the victory you know I mean we can stay 3 hours in sink we can take stay you know two hours and sing if if we have the time if we have the anointing to do but you realize that uh uh the church word takes all of the time in the music they sing the music they dance and and when it comes to the word it's just 50 minutes why because the people are already tired they are they are tired and you know uh uh uh and then it comes to the word you know we just we just uh uh read a scripture you know uh uh you know uh remind our said a few things and then we go home I'm saying this because like I said it's not only our assembly it's something that is beginning to creep in a little bit We complain when the word is preached when that music is going on oh man oh man praise the lord it's either about how loud our music can be or how fast we can sing and how we can move our body and all of that but sometimes we just need the Stillness of the music we just need to worship our minds need to concentrate on what we are singing We need to enter in with him praise the Lord you need to be singing where you can embrace the Lord you feel his embrace you feel his closeness praise the Lord so this morning we want want to talk about rejoicing in the truth taking much of my time here and uh I pray that the Lord will be able to to uh to help us as we just look right here brother Bram will says this in the church order I think something that that was said this morning that's where I should have be from and I started with our reading this he says and remember God is looking to me to see that I stay with the word I'm looking to you to see that you carry it out praise the Lord now so you will see John said it in another way over in first John chapter uh 1 uh uh verse 4 and chapter 3 uh uh uh 1 verse three he says uh uh you know I was glad to see my children rejoicing in the truth praise the Lord amen be just like brother bam says here God is looking out to me to see that I preach these things I'm looking out to you to see that you carry out so what happen is that uh uh uh the the people rejoice in the preaching of the word the preacher rejoice when he sees the people taking victory in the word praise the lord it's not how you know how much I can come and and recul and rebuke you and that it's not the thing that makes me joy that brings me joy I see I I I have joy when when I can when I can see you taking position in the word knowing that there are lot of things that you are dealing with but I see grace helping you praise the Lord are we together we continue to read here he says uh and keep it spiritual now remember all the forces all the dark kingdom of Satan will turn against you as you begin to grow in the Lord and that's what we doing as a church we are growing amen growing in the Lord is not about the members it is how much we are identifying with this word is how much we know that we have an inheritance how much we know that uh uh uh a word has been given us the message of the hour that God is looking for men and women that can stand for his word and as you begin to grow that's when your spiritual battles will begin amen if you think you don't have none you are not growing you are still a baby Satan don't play around babies he played around Sons because he knows that the inheritance are for Sons inheritance are not given to you when you are baby you will eat that paper t p in the trash praise the Lord that's the reason why the father hire a tutor when the boy start paying attention to his father inheritance the father set from far he look at the sons and try to see which one have an interest in protecting what belongs to the family praise the Lord and as much as the father is looking the devil is also looking who having an interest and is that very one that he attacks praise the Lord amen look at the story of the prodal son it looks like the younger son or the one that went away he was he was he was he was ruling and uh you know uh uh uh and uh you know he he went and wasted the father inheritance that's truth praise the Lord amen but as you look in the story then you look at a closing you will realize even the one that have stayed home that stayed home you know that he tried to do everything to please the father he never saw the value of how much the father have praise the Lord he was more about pleasing the father than protect protecting The Inheritance if you don't if you don't see the value of what you have there is no way you can fight for it if you don't see the value of living a decent life there is no way you can fight for it if you think the people that are out there you know undressing thems and with every the faction out there are better than you that's where you will drift to because it's in every one of us to be better we desire to be better but when if you have the you you you have recognized the the the the value of what you have that in the day and age like this you have have the grace to be able to live a v life amen that a young woman would take to herself and uh not kissing everybody in the street amen if I kisse the body will be the one before the altar let my first case be be before the altar if that is not of value to you you will not fight for it you will not fight for it praise the Lord even though this young boy has realized he has wasted everything but he remember there is an inheritance he remember I'm just you know I'm just I'm just wasting my life here instead of eating in the in the pig patch my father has everything the beauty of that story The Beauty of what Jesus was the one that told that Parable the beauty of that why he brought that story to the to the the the the the Pharisees if you read the setting of The Story Jesus had the Pharisees on one side he had the publicans which were the Sinners on one side praise the Lord the beauty of that story that he was trying to bring to them is that is is uh is uh uh uh there there there an inheritance that we must identify praise the Lord and just during the week I was uh uh you know reading and and and and uh and and and I taught about that story and in my mind I was thinking I say it's uh uh uh uh uh it's it's one of the story in the Bible where you were realize that a setting R the Bible says the father asks that he must be dress in a set rod and it's it's one of the story also where you find that the the the the there is an exchange of rink the father put a rink on his finger brother Bram says it was it it signify that his name was good on the check just like the father's name praise the Lord and then I started thinking in my mind I says well is that where we took our wedding culture from because it's in the wedding where a certain Rob is bought every every girl look for that set Rob and then it's it's where ring is also exchange why because that's what marriage is marriage is all about Redemption the story of the prodical son was all about redemp Redemption the father said my son was lost now he's found he was dead now he's alive praise the Lord so when a young man takes a woman it's it's an act of redemption and is also an act of adoption her name is good on the check as your name praise the Lord amen it's an act of Redemption where you don't you don't say well you know I I I I bought my car before I marry you I build my house before I marry you whatever you have when that person is redeemed to that position the name is good on the check as your name are we together praise the Lord amen this agean Society has given us sheer property we have lot of people coab beting together and they are not really under the covant of marriage because it's a covenant of redemption it's a covenant of adoption praise the Lord amen are we together what am I talking about this morning I might not even say what I want to say until my time will finish he says and all the other kingom is against you as you begin to grow and you must he says and you must be a soldier not just a recruit you have been around the world for the long time you must be know you must be able to know how to fight you must know how to stand for something praise the Lord amen and in the military you know uh uh uh uh the recruits identified by that shiny head praise the Lord you know straight that this one he just entered amen and it's a it's an identification they take you is is it's an identification that is identified with you changing hair shape no matter what your hairstyle is praise the Lord you like to run that line in your head you like to shape your hair like no matter what it is they strip everything off to make you to know you are under a different hair shape you are going to follow our Command you can do your own things here is an identification of the church change of hair shape so brother Braham says you are not a recruit you been around your hair has grown a little bit now praise the Lord amen are we together you have to know that I mean that that that was that was what Samson was was waiting for amen that's what he was waiting for he didn't have an eyes to see but he knew that his Covenant was not in his eyes praise the Lord his Covenant was not in his muscle his Covenant was his hair shape so he kept touching his hair when he started feeding grein of hell he said take me to the post I'm man I see the forces around me but I know I'm under a covant praise the Lord amen he says and SED will he will he he will come and mourn you cause you to dispute with one another if he can turn him down just immediately praise the Lord just immediately what is the benefit of of of uh you know fighting against one another praise the Lord it's not a place of competition here let me tell you there's there there's a difference there's a difference yeah I mean and and and that's what the communion represent to the church when we come to that communion and we identified ourself with uh with with his body and the blood and then we set ourself aside to to wash one another another Faith that's what it's all about the ministry is all about serving you realize that uh uh uh uh uh uh the people that don't have the heart to self they are always controlling it's a spirit of detector sh you feel like people must serve you Jesus said you call me Lord and Masters and I have washed your feet now do the same to one another so what we are called to do is to serve one another are we together he said turn him down immediately you are Brethren and is the enemy and we are here to whole extender in this evening light that when the word is darking and the whole church kingdom is going into the Council of churches and that's and that is the thing that that caught my attention most of what we want our our our service to be is is is all of the things we see on the internet praise the Lord you watch all of those great worship [Music] leaders you think about how much prayer time do they have how much prayer time it's not about the curliness of the voice it's not the hard tone that we can take I've seen brothers that cannot even carry a tone like brother Brandon would say carry the tone in the cup they can't carry the tone but they are great worship leaders because it's all about creating an atmosphere it's all about bringing the people in and say we are children oh let Rejoice the Lord is with us the Lord is good are we together amen maybe I take one more yeah I won't be able to get through everything I want I wanted through this morning in the message brother BR take this he said when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joob way back before the foundation of the word how do we know that wasn't the time when the lamb was slain that's when God in his great thinking seeing us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus Christ praise the Lord you know because uh so that's that's that's what Jesus was trying to connect the disciples with your shouting and joing rejoicing should not be uh uh only in uh H uh your daily Victory because at as much as you have Victory you will also have defeats praise the Lord so are we going to be rejoicing one day and now when we going through a a little time of trial we are s we are no no no no and when you identified and you're rejoicing whether you are having Victory what you are going through trial you know that my name is in the book that's where our joy is because you have got you you you have got an Heavenly identification so we came right into our time with something that we never knew we had praise the Lord and that's the reason why the word have the preeminence in the service the real time of worshiping is when the word is preached we must now sit down like Spectators we must rejoice in the word we must Rejoice that things have been said that have call us out things has been said that has identified what I'm dealing with I must rejoice in the fact that God took time to identify what I'm dealing with when when he spoke to Judas he never said Judas go and betray me he said no there's one among you yeah that will betray me and let he go and do it quickly but when he spoke to Peter he said pet he call him by name if God call call you by name identifying what you are dealing with you better rejoice in it praise the Lord he said one year will be tring they started asking one another is it you me oh they did not know so Jesus identifying Peter and says uh Peter Satan seek to shift you as a we but I have prayed for you that should be enough for him to start rejoicing whoa I just missed a bullet praise the Lord I just missed a bullet are we together and brother bam says here when the morning star sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that shouted for Joy Jesus told them I had Joy with you before the foundation of the word so what is he doing he's connecting what job said to what we just read in St luk don't Rejoice because uh you know demons are subject unto you it give us some sense of Joy amen when we know that at least by the grace of God uh I mean uh the the the Lord is uh uh is helping us to get over some our fleshly nature it give us some sense of Joy but the thing about it there is that your flesh will never come to Perfection praise the Lord you will have battles but when if you can identify yourself with the word it's the word that brings our rejoicing amen praise the Lord is the word that brings our rejoicing let me take this one and then we close here Mery believe I'll take that one and then we close praise the Lord thank you for bearing with me amen kind of started the service in a complete different way but uh I can I can feel the connection amen I can feel that you are connected with what I'm saying brother bam says to take God at his word is to hear his word accept it and start rejoicing with it now start performing it now start carrying it out hear the word accept it and start rejoicing are we together because every seed will bring forth of his kind his world will never go out and return back to him without accomplishing the purpose so if God has spoken a promise to you that you can take as your own you don't have to see the seed producing fruit before you are happy that the seed was planted praise the Lord talk to brother Wesley he will teach you more about that about planting seed Amen brother B says here we could see 500 rush to the altar tonight which will be a sign then that the Revival is going to break we don't we don't have to have 500 at the altar we just have to take God's word for it and start rejoicing praise the Lord amen are we together and that is one of the thing that the Church lives is rejoicing in the word it don't have to be the preaching of the word like we are doing but I mean if you have cultivated the habit of rejoicing in the word whether you are reading it in your home or you are listening to it on H you know driving behind the wheel praise the Lord sometimes I just feel like parking my car running around the c a little bit because something have just something have just sounded so beautiful to me praise the lord it's not seeing 500 at the altar he says but if we just have to take God at his word and start rejoicing see what will happen when you learn to cultivate rejoicing in the word when you read the scripture that says the angels of the Lord are incal about them you don't have to see the Angels before you be happy start rejoicing because you are protected God there is more with us than them that are against us are we together can we say Amen to the word am amen take God word for it start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to Life As We water it with praise you see that's why praise comes after the preaching of the word because a seed has been planted We Must Praise we must worship Him and when we praise the lord we are watering the seed that has been planted praise the Lord that brings the word to Life As We water it with praises what makes the sea grow water what makes the word of God grow is the Praises of God learning to praise God praise the Lord let me tell you if you don't cultivate a habit to praise God you will seek self Praises praise the Lord amen you you you were you you will you will seek self praises to feel like you're doing something are we together when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room all the C of Jerusalem until they are endu with power from on high Thy word f in their ears amen a seed was s TI wait until you are in you with power that word fed in their ear they was in the temple continuously praising God day and night praising God day and night conditioning himself for the promise to come to pass Mary said be it unto me according to your word they were in the temple praising God day and night what was they doing watering the promise all of a s there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it f the house word they were sitting the word was being watered and it took life and started growing there is no way you can bring anything of what God have said in your life it's not about practicing it's about appreciating the fact that you have identified that God has said this praise the lord it's not about practicing and you know you are you we must have some sense of discipline we must not just be loose amen our sense of discipline plan create an expectation you cannot be expecting someone to come and visit you and then you go shopping no you set a time and you know they might be coming around that time and then you wait for them are we together the word was being watered and it took life and started growing you are wanting a Revival start watering the word the promise that makes me feel religious myself brother Brandon say Amen if you want to come out of the wheed chair start watering the word if you want to come from that cancer start watering the word praise the Lord when we identify that what God have said that we are not just carrying you know what uh h a black a black Cover Book in our hands we are not just carrying the religious book we Are carrying the book that is full of promises and every word in this book is a Living Word every word in this book can take flesh it can take your flesh are we together let's water the word with Pro with praise let's water the promises with praise amen Jesus said when you pray say our father who are in heaven a hall I adore you I praise you I worship you Hallowed be thy name holy is your name precious is your word beautiful is your presence learning to water the word with praise musicians can come forth praise the Lord the musicians can come for this
