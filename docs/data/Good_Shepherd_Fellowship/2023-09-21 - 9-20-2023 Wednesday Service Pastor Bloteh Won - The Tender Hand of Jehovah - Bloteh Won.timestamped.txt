[31:19] said uh
[31:21] uh Christian Fellowship over in DC had
[31:24] the the election for for the pastor
[31:28] after brother mirror went to be with the
[31:31] Lord I think they were in three years or
[31:34] so or a little more than that we filed a
[31:37] pastor so they were able to vote brother
[31:39] James uh amward in on Sunday
[31:43] and uh so this coming Sunday they want
[31:48] to place him in office and uh yeah they
[31:51] have asked that we come over and support
[31:53] them so I will be away and uh but today
[31:57] I will take the service for us pray for
[31:58] our brother
[32:00] praise the Lord and then so I was
[32:04] talking to brother James on Monday I
[32:07] called him to congratulate him and I
[32:11] knew that his dad was was also now well
[32:14] so I was also checking uh with him
[32:17] concerning the health of his dad he's
[32:20] pretty much dealing with the same Health
[32:23] situation I like brother Steve John Bibi
[32:27] he has a pancreatic cancer but he's more
[32:31] in a common like state
[32:33] so he's in the hospital so it's kind of
[32:36] a tough for our brother and so he asked
[32:40] that we pray for him and it's strange
[32:42] enough because I was driving over to see
[32:45] brother Steve John baby and they know
[32:47] both one another because they are from
[32:49] the same background with church there in
[32:52] Ghana
[32:53] so I want to see him and then now you
[32:56] know spending some time there then and
[32:58] just talking with him and
[33:00] and then uh
[33:04] you know when I got there he asked me to
[33:06] help him sit up and help him you know
[33:10] and he said we talking and then after he
[33:14] wanted for me to help him back into bed
[33:17] so why he lied there and uh
[33:21] and and dealing with with with all the
[33:24] the pains in his body
[33:27] I was sitting down and just looking and
[33:29] his daughter was also helping and uh and
[33:33] and the thought just
[33:35] hit me
[33:37] he's in the tender hands of Jehovah
[33:42] and then when I left left the house
[33:45] uh I you know I started strolling
[33:48] through my phone to look for I know I've
[33:51] preached his message
[33:52] many years back
[33:54] and then I started looking through my
[33:57] phone and I just bought the tender hands
[33:59] of Jehovah and I realized that uh it
[34:03] never came to me like the way they came
[34:05] to me just uh this go on Monday it was
[34:08] in the message that Exeter and that will
[34:11] be the only place that brother Brandon
[34:13] will use their phrase the tender hand of
[34:16] Jehovah
[34:17] so uh uh so then it kind of caught my
[34:22] attention and and in a way that it
[34:24] caught my attention is that it's an
[34:27] element for an Exeter
[34:30] in a way that he said it and I will read
[34:34] some of the statement to you so so then
[34:37] all through the week I just I'll just be
[34:40] looking at different different things uh
[34:43] uh in light with that uh uh statement
[34:46] the tender hand of Jehovah and uh uh he
[34:50] couldn't leave my mind it was not what I
[34:53] was talking so I thought I said okay I
[34:55] will pray about it and then we will
[34:57] speak we will speak on that uh
[35:00] on the first Sunday of October and let's
[35:03] let's pray may we we will be planning to
[35:06] have a convenience service
[35:08] on on the first Sunday of October so
[35:12] let's just put there before the Lord and
[35:15] so I thought I said well okay maybe I
[35:17] will talk about that but then all
[35:19] through the week I mean it was just the
[35:21] thought that was just going through my
[35:22] mind the tender hand of Jehovah and I
[35:25] was just looking at different things
[35:27] looking at the hand of the Lord through
[35:29] the scripture you know uh and then they
[35:32] just couldn't leave my mind I was I was
[35:34] here a couple of hours today just before
[35:36] service and and it just kept coming back
[35:39] to my mind I said well Lord okay maybe
[35:42] if if that's the only thing on my mind
[35:45] then that's the only thing I can talk
[35:46] about what is on my mind
[35:49] praise the Lord so then I went back and
[35:52] and I got a few few of uh the the quotes
[35:56] I were looking at today uh looking at
[35:58] through this week and then also uh uh
[36:02] got in he had an AXA brother uh Jordan
[36:06] to to get us a few uh photo as a slide
[36:11] that we would like to use tonight so
[36:14] just for a scripture reading let's just
[36:16] stand and then we will we will read
[36:18] Jeremiah chapter 18 reading from verse 1
[36:22] to verse 6.
[36:25] Jeremiah chapter 18 reading from verse 1
[36:29] to verse 6.
[36:37] praise the Lord
[37:01] Jeremiah chapter 18 let's read from
[37:04] verse 1 the word which came to Jeremiah
[37:08] from the Lord saying arise and go down
[37:11] to the Potter House
[37:13] and there I will cause thee to hear my
[37:18] words
[37:21] then I went down to the Potter House and
[37:23] and behold
[37:25] he wrote for work on the vessels and the
[37:29] vessel that he made of clay was marked
[37:32] in his hands in the hand of the Potter
[37:35] so he made it again another vessel
[37:39] our same good to the porter to make it
[37:43] then the word of the Lord came to me
[37:46] saying O House of Israel
[37:50] cannot I do with you as this Porter
[37:55] say the Lord behold as the claim
[38:00] is in the hands in the porter hands so I
[38:04] hear in my hands O House of Israel
[38:08] praise the Lord
[38:10] amen Jeremiah 29
[38:20] as the clitus in my hands
[38:23] in the hands of the Potter so I hear in
[38:26] my hands Jeremiah chapter 29.
[38:29] familiar verse
[38:33] 11.
[38:35] for I know the thoughts that are that I
[38:38] think towards you say the Lord thoughts
[38:41] of peace a man of evil to give you an
[38:45] expected end
[38:47] then called upon me and uh yes I go and
[38:52] prayed unto me and I will yaken unto you
[38:56] and he shall seek me and find me when
[39:00] yeh shall seek me seek for me with all
[39:03] your heart and I will be fond of you
[39:06] said the Lord and I will return away
[39:10] your captivity and will and will gather
[39:13] you from all the Nations all the
[39:18] denominations if we want to see their
[39:19] way and from all the places whether I
[39:23] have driven you said the Lord and I will
[39:27] bring you again into the place where
[39:30] Wayne's I cause you to be carried away
[39:34] captive let's pray together
[39:37] Heavenly Father
[39:39] dear Lord
[39:43] I can I can really say that this is a
[39:46] subject tonight Lord because I don't
[39:48] know how I got here
[39:50] but Lord as I just sat there Lord
[39:52] guarding and seeing our brother
[39:54] struggling in pain Slaughter
[39:57] this talk just struck my heart he's in
[40:00] the hands of
[40:01] the tender hands of Jehovah
[40:04] and father I pray to God that you will
[40:06] bless this prayer meeting tonight and
[40:09] the few things that we will say may they
[40:11] be blessing may it be and encouragement
[40:14] to your children Lord we love you we
[40:17] appreciate you father
[40:19] Jesus name we pray amen
[40:22] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[40:24] your seat
[40:25] amen go to be in the house of the Lord
[40:29] praise the Lord
[40:33] so just like I said I went and then uh
[40:38] you know sometimes you are
[40:41] you are so consumed with a thought that
[40:43] you don't pay attention to certain
[40:45] details
[40:46] and but this time it came to me in a in
[40:49] a different way so that's what I would
[40:52] love to share with you tonight
[40:54] and uh man if you if you uh uh uh go and
[41:00] and read or play the message there
[41:02] actually you realize that brother
[41:04] Branham opened the service actually with
[41:06] a prayer
[41:07] and then he he made comments so uh uh
[41:11] then just before he will he would get to
[41:14] reading the word
[41:16] he decided to to pray it again
[41:19] and it was actually in that prayer that
[41:22] he made this statement so we will read
[41:24] that we'll read that together
[41:27] and then maybe that would just help us
[41:29] to be able to gather our thoughts yeah
[41:33] [Music]
[41:34] taxider he says I'm looking now by faith
[41:38] towards the coming something Lord upon
[41:41] the Earth
[41:42] that's going to draw that people
[41:45] together
[41:46] when we see the denominational churches
[41:50] Soul uh uh paying down and and getting
[41:54] so different
[41:56] is really pushing people out just as it
[42:01] was in Egypt
[42:03] a pharaoh Rising who knew near Joseph
[42:08] as it was in Germany
[42:11] up into Russia and Italy the people rise
[42:14] up
[42:15] uh he said Joseph Hitler Stanley
[42:19] Mussolini who hated the Jews they had to
[42:23] go back to their Homeland now you have
[42:27] to realize that under the seals
[42:30] but Brandon said it takes uh political
[42:33] pressure
[42:35] to take the Jews back to their Homeland
[42:38] but for the church it takes religious
[42:41] pressure
[42:43] praise the Lord
[42:44] so just as God will create a political
[42:47] pressure on on the people of Israel that
[42:51] was the same thing there in Egypt a
[42:54] pharaoh race of that they didn't know
[42:55] Joseph just to be able to fulfill the
[42:58] promise of a 400 year visitation and uh
[43:02] uh that that that is the same thing that
[43:05] it took in all of this but we we want to
[43:08] keep that in our mind because what is
[43:11] happening to them in the physical is
[43:13] happening the same is also happening to
[43:16] us in the spiritual praise the Lord
[43:18] amen
[43:21] he says in
[43:23] they had to go back to their Homeland
[43:26] God you you got ways of doing things
[43:31] that we don't understand
[43:35] and and you press them
[43:39] go home in Germany everything taken away
[43:43] from them also in italic Russian no
[43:47] place to go
[43:49] and they were sent back to their
[43:52] Homeland just to fulfill the word
[43:56] all the loving hand of God
[44:00] how sometimes
[44:02] it looks cruel
[44:05] the way that people suffer
[44:09] but is still
[44:12] it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading
[44:17] his little children
[44:19] we thank you Lord
[44:22] praise the Lord
[44:24] amen
[44:25] I like to read that again before I
[44:28] continue
[44:29] how sometimes he says uh
[44:34] oh the loving hand of God
[44:37] how sometimes it looks cruel
[44:42] the way that people suffer
[44:46] but it's still
[44:49] praise the Lord
[44:51] the way people suffer the things we go
[44:54] through
[44:56] he said but it's still
[45:01] what a paradox
[45:04] praise the Lord
[45:06] amen
[45:07] but it's still the tender hand of
[45:10] Jehovah leading his children
[45:13] we thank you Lord
[45:15] I'm looking now by faith
[45:19] I think I'm repeating this yes I'm
[45:22] repeating it
[45:24] I will drop down now I pray God as I see
[45:29] the day that the denomination is
[45:33] pressing the believer as communicating
[45:35] then saying there their names must be
[45:38] upon their book and they are lost have
[45:42] nothing to do with uh
[45:45] with the other group
[45:48] is only the tender hand of Jehovah
[45:50] leading them to the Tree of Life
[45:53] the tenor hand of Jehovah was leading
[45:55] Israel to a Promised Land the hand of
[45:59] Jehovah is leading us to the tree of
[46:01] life which is the word
[46:03] praise the Lord so when those
[46:06] Trials come
[46:08] is to lead us back to the word
[46:12] are we together
[46:13] that's the place we can find our comfort
[46:16] that's the place we can gather strength
[46:19] that's the place our healing comes from
[46:23] are we together
[46:30] I pray God that each I know they will
[46:33] because it's your word it cannot fail
[46:36] and may we be led to the tree of life
[46:39] that we might be a possessor of internal
[46:42] life see the hand of God and by the eyes
[46:46] of it look Beyond this shadow that we
[46:51] are walking in today see the promised
[46:54] land line just ahead praise the Lord
[46:58] amen
[47:02] and then while he went on uh uh um he
[47:05] started preaching and he was gathering
[47:07] his thoughts and and then the thoughts
[47:10] struck him again
[47:12] he was actually talking about the terror
[47:14] Exeter but then as he went on talking
[47:16] they thought struck him again and he
[47:19] made the statement he says uh he says
[47:22] now you can see what we were speaking in
[47:25] prayer a few moment ago
[47:28] why did God have to hide in Pharaoh's
[47:32] heart
[47:34] to put the people back in the Promised
[47:37] Land
[47:38] before he could blessed him
[47:40] to bring forth the Messiah to them
[47:45] how how did he have to hide in Hitler's
[47:49] heart
[47:49] to be against the Jews when he was half
[47:53] Jews himself
[47:55] how could he have to do that Stanley
[47:59] messalonia see
[48:01] people
[48:02] that's not inspired not a nation God has
[48:06] to take and think that they are living
[48:10] by the lord of the land many times to
[48:13] make his promise comes true
[48:16] he had to harvest those detectors had to
[48:20] run the Jews back to the promised land
[48:23] it had to be that way
[48:27] praise the Lord
[48:29] amen so as I was thinking about that and
[48:32] uh just like I said I asked brought
[48:34] Jordan to just get a few slice of
[48:37] pictures here so we ask him to project
[48:39] that and then we will go into our
[48:41] thought tonight remember that this is
[48:44] just a prayer meeting
[48:50] now these are few photos
[48:52] from
[48:54] from the Holocaust
[48:56] and in in all that those Jews have to go
[49:00] through now see all of the you know the
[49:03] innocent faces of these babies
[49:06] that should be home playing with their
[49:08] friends
[49:09] praise the Lord
[49:11] now they were all set apart and they had
[49:15] to be put in trained they have to be
[49:17] separated from their parents and women
[49:19] away from their husband and all of that
[49:22] and yet a prophet is saying is the
[49:26] tender hand of Jehovah
[49:28] praise the Lord
[49:31] if you sit back and just think about
[49:34] this
[49:36] I don't know about you
[49:38] but as I thought about it
[49:43] I just sit back and just weeping
[49:48] praise the Lord
[49:50] because you see this is one thing to
[49:53] read black and white
[49:56] is the tender hand of Jehovah
[49:59] it's another thing to really be in the
[50:02] tender hand of Jehovah
[50:05] is one thing to read about his tender
[50:07] hands
[50:09] it's another thing to be in the hands of
[50:13] God
[50:14] the Bible says it's a fearful thing
[50:17] to fall in the hands of the Living God
[50:23] fearful not mostly in the sense of
[50:26] scaring it's fearful mostly in in a
[50:30] sense of is is a sacred thing like when
[50:33] the Bible says you are wonderfully and
[50:34] fearful in me
[50:37] are we together
[50:50] and all of these things that the people
[50:52] have to go through I mean I mean the the
[50:55] Jewish people had to go through I mean
[50:58] all of these uh uh family plans and uh
[51:02] uh preparing for for for birthday and uh
[51:07] yeah happy birthday Emmanuel you had
[51:09] your birthday yesterday and and all of
[51:11] that and then all of a facility
[51:16] things just change
[51:19] how to take them from their homes
[51:22] praise the Lord
[51:26] they have to be giving a certain
[51:28] identification
[51:31] your life will never be the same
[51:36] praise the Lord
[51:40] I was listening to a brother talking
[51:43] about this and he said uh he said I
[51:46] struggle with this he said I struggle
[51:49] with this when I heard people saying
[51:51] that there was the tender hand of
[51:53] Jehovah he said I struggle with it I
[51:56] struggle to to understand it to believe
[51:58] it
[51:59] right
[52:00] it's not that I doubt that the prophet
[52:02] but I just couldn't fight on me I
[52:04] couldn't put it together
[52:07] he said but when I went and listened to
[52:09] the message to Exeter and I listened to
[52:11] it again and I listened to it he says
[52:13] then God was gracious he came down and
[52:17] gave me a sense of understanding for me
[52:19] to be able to understand
[52:22] to look at this photo and say this is
[52:24] the tender hand of Jehovah
[52:36] praise the Lord
[52:39] are we together the Bible says uh in in
[52:44] in in the Book of Revelation the the the
[52:46] New Jerusalem uh was coming down like a
[52:51] bride a door for her husband
[52:53] do you have another one there brother
[52:55] Jordy just just go through just go
[52:57] through all of the ones you gather if
[52:59] that's the last one then we can get back
[53:02] to our subject here
[53:05] praise the Lord
[53:19] in future home
[53:25] who will read this now notice Jesus said
[53:28] as in John 14 go to prepare a place oh
[53:32] what will it looks like how did you ever
[53:35] think now right what will it looks like
[53:40] it's a
[53:42] uh it is prepared and designed by their
[53:47] Divine architect
[53:50] what will that City looks like
[53:54] now we are going to talk about it for a
[53:57] few minutes the Divine architect has
[54:00] prepared design it
[54:02] and look
[54:04] he designed it with tender hands
[54:10] for his beloved bride
[54:14] praise the Lord
[54:17] the same tender hands
[54:22] that hold us in the time of our trials
[54:25] and our our sicknesses and uh
[54:30] the difficult things we go through
[54:33] he's making us to realize he's the same
[54:36] tender hands
[54:38] that have built the New Jerusalem
[54:42] praise the Lord
[54:44] this great architect just like we look
[54:46] at the temple in this progression from
[54:49] the Tabernacle to the temple and even to
[54:52] ourself thus as it as as a tabernacle of
[54:55] the Living God
[54:57] realize that God was giving us a picture
[55:00] of how he would deal with us
[55:03] not only be with us but how he will come
[55:06] down
[55:07] endure in US
[55:10] praise the Lord
[55:12] amen how he would come down endure in US
[55:15] is is uh is uh is uh a rating and
[55:19] testify that in the Bible after Solomon
[55:22] dedicated the temple the the shakhana
[55:24] glory came down and and is still it
[55:28] stayed there it was it was not going and
[55:30] coming it rested right there in in the
[55:33] in the temple of Solomon because
[55:35] everything was in place and God was so
[55:38] pleased with the place until he came
[55:40] down and he endured
[55:43] and the people who see the glory of the
[55:45] Lord
[55:48] in the same way their fathers could see
[55:50] the the cloud by night and see the the
[55:54] the you know the the pillow the pillar
[55:56] of Fire by night and the cloud by day
[55:58] right in the Tabernacle there they could
[56:01] see the glory of God
[56:04] praise the Lord
[56:05] and the people that that witness uh uh
[56:08] uh uh the uh the outpouring uh at Azusa
[56:12] they will tell you that uh uh when
[56:15] William Simon came up and he started to
[56:17] sink the comforter has come the
[56:19] comforter has come I mean they were not
[56:21] running over the place they were now
[56:23] being loud they were just worshiping
[56:25] they would tell you that right in
[56:27] California you will see the place being
[56:29] milky you can feel the presence of God
[56:34] the glory of God will come down you will
[56:37] see a clown
[56:39] hanging in the building
[56:45] praise the Lord
[56:48] what was the Shekinah Glory it's now the
[56:52] indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost to
[56:54] the believer
[56:57] praise the Lord
[57:00] whatever was that pillow of Fire by
[57:03] night is now the indwelling presence of
[57:06] the Holy Ghost in The Believer
[57:11] are we together
[57:13] but you think about it yet think about
[57:15] what uh we are looking at here he says
[57:18] that uh the uh what would that City
[57:21] looks like we think about the New
[57:23] Jerusalem we think about uh uh acidic
[57:26] coming down and uh a place that we are
[57:29] looking forward to going he says you
[57:31] think about it in your mind that place
[57:33] is built by the great architect of God
[57:40] he says I go and prepare a place for you
[57:47] the same hand that have gone to prepare
[57:50] a place for you is the same hand that is
[57:52] preparing you to go to that place
[57:56] the Lord
[57:57] amen oh yeah we wonder we want the glory
[58:01] of that place we want to enjoy the place
[58:03] no more sickness no more pain
[58:07] but just like as he's preparing the
[58:09] place he should also prepare us
[58:14] prepare us to go to a prepared place
[58:19] because it's a prepared place for a
[58:21] prepared people
[58:28] are we together
[58:32] the tender hand of Jehovah
[58:40] it's hard to feel it
[58:43] it's hard to feel the tenderness of his
[58:46] hands
[58:48] when you are in pains
[58:51] or going through something and you can't
[58:53] explain it
[58:55] how can you feel tenderness
[59:00] in trials
[59:03] how can you explain tenderness
[59:06] when an Egyptian is taking a whip
[59:09] and whipping the Hebrew boy on his back
[59:12] how can you explain tenderness
[59:22] praise the lord it's a prayer meeting
[59:24] tonight so
[59:26] try not to keep you too long
[59:29] I'll just we just prepare you here it's
[59:32] I mean it's just it's just one of those
[59:34] things I mean your mind gets so filled
[59:36] with a thought and and it's just it just
[59:39] it just it just won't leave you
[59:48] praise the Lord
[59:51] how can we explain
[59:55] the tender hand of Jehovah
[59:59] that way but let's see what David said
[1:00:01] here
[1:00:03] are we together
[1:00:05] praise the Lord
[1:00:09] awesome
[1:00:14] Psalm chapter 119.
[1:00:24] Psalm chapter 119.
[1:00:28] let's read verse a 66 David said
[1:00:32] teach me good judgment
[1:00:35] and knowledge
[1:00:37] for I have believed thy commandment
[1:00:43] before I was afflicted I went astray
[1:00:49] but now have I kept that word
[1:00:56] meditate on that
[1:00:58] just for the meaning
[1:01:01] before I was afflicted
[1:01:04] I went straight and we wish me
[1:01:07] before you got a hold of me I was lost
[1:01:11] right my mind was now thinking right my
[1:01:15] life was not right
[1:01:17] but when you got a hold of me
[1:01:21] praise the Lord
[1:01:23] he says now I can keep your word now and
[1:01:27] I can walk in your statues
[1:01:30] before I was afflicted before I went
[1:01:34] through triers
[1:01:36] I was astray
[1:01:40] praise the Lord
[1:01:41] that's that's the reason why the prophet
[1:01:43] was says you are not in our right mind
[1:01:47] until we have the man of Christ right
[1:01:51] praise the Lord
[1:01:53] until we have the man of Christ
[1:01:59] Express there in the book of Philippians
[1:02:04] what the Bible says he taught it not
[1:02:06] Robert to be equal with God being God he
[1:02:09] suffered even to the death of the cross
[1:02:16] but that's the Eternal hand of Jehovah
[1:02:18] Isaiah said it pleased the Lord to see
[1:02:21] him striking
[1:02:28] they please the Lord
[1:02:31] and I believe that I say please the Lord
[1:02:34] in the bridegroom so it's also pleased
[1:02:36] the Lord in the bride
[1:02:41] when we are going through
[1:02:43] what God has allotted us to go through
[1:02:51] praise the Lord
[1:02:53] you know the truth of the matter there
[1:02:55] is Saints this picture
[1:02:57] will never come fully right to us
[1:03:02] until we get on the other side
[1:03:05] because no matter how much you think you
[1:03:07] understand it get in the fire
[1:03:11] it almost looks like when you're getting
[1:03:13] tires everything you know about Trial
[1:03:15] goes from your mind
[1:03:19] may I try us impatient love the Lord in
[1:03:22] try yours trial give you faith
[1:03:24] everything you know ever tried every
[1:03:27] virtue you know it almost looks like it
[1:03:29] goes from your mind
[1:03:34] and that Williamsburg we cry Lord what
[1:03:36] I've had done oh Lord what I've had done
[1:03:38] have mercy upon me forgiving all my sins
[1:03:41] you know then you want to be reap after
[1:03:42] I say again you want to you you just
[1:03:44] want to look through your life and it
[1:03:46] just it just almost looks like it's gone
[1:03:48] from our mind
[1:03:55] before hours of lectured I went astray
[1:04:04] are we together
[1:04:16] the tender hands of Jehovah
[1:04:21] their great architect
[1:04:28] is dealing with us
[1:04:33] the prophet said that's what the great
[1:04:35] Shepherd would do
[1:04:40] the shepherd comes reached down with
[1:04:43] tender hands and bring that little and
[1:04:46] bring that one safely in place it upon
[1:04:49] his shoulder
[1:04:51] and bring it safely back
[1:04:56] to the father
[1:04:58] he's using every key
[1:05:01] and every gentleness to bring us back to
[1:05:04] the Fort but to you and myself is
[1:05:07] horrible it's unbearable
[1:05:10] why me
[1:05:13] praise the Lord
[1:05:15] to the great Shepherd he's using every
[1:05:18] Tender Care to pick you up
[1:05:22] and put you upon his shoulder and take
[1:05:25] you safely back into his presence
[1:05:29] but with you and myself know
[1:05:33] we don't have no money we don't have no
[1:05:35] food
[1:05:38] nothing going right
[1:05:41] How can there be The Tender hands of
[1:05:43] Jehovah
[1:05:45] praise the Lord he says so pray the song
[1:05:47] we can't see the hands of God anymore
[1:05:49] than what we start looking for we start
[1:05:51] looking for you know uh uh uh family
[1:05:54] problem family curse we start looking
[1:05:57] for all sorts of things
[1:05:58] when it is just
[1:06:00] the lovely hand of God picking you up
[1:06:05] putting you on his shoulder
[1:06:07] the Bible says as the heaven is higher
[1:06:10] than the Earth
[1:06:12] so are his ways
[1:06:15] higher than our ways it's hard to it's
[1:06:18] hard to put it together
[1:06:22] because we would think the tender hands
[1:06:24] of Jehovah we will start to feel a a
[1:06:28] wind blowing when when there is no wind
[1:06:30] blowing we know that the angels are
[1:06:32] flopping their wings you know I could
[1:06:34] feel the breeze the Angels were moving
[1:06:36] their wings I mean I was lifted off of
[1:06:39] the ground I could feel myself
[1:06:40] suspending I was walking on the air that
[1:06:43] that is the way we think about it in our
[1:06:45] mind sure
[1:06:50] that's the way we want it
[1:06:57] oh how we enjoy Seth praise and
[1:06:59] self-glory
[1:07:01] self-gratification
[1:07:04] we enjoy those things
[1:07:09] but his thoughts are higher than our
[1:07:11] thoughts
[1:07:15] praise the Lord
[1:07:17] amen I don't know if I'm preaching
[1:07:19] tonight
[1:07:20] but uh
[1:07:22] I'm just sharing with you
[1:07:26] be not afraid
[1:07:29] I saw this thought also you know along
[1:07:32] when
[1:07:33] you are in the present alone when you
[1:07:35] are in the presence of Christ
[1:07:37] you always see miraculous things
[1:07:39] taking place
[1:07:41] that's the reason I love to live in his
[1:07:44] presence is to see his great tender
[1:07:47] hands going out to minister
[1:07:50] praise the Lord
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:54] I would love to have walked with him in
[1:07:58] those days
[1:07:59] but I think today is maybe the greatest
[1:08:02] privilege
[1:08:04] because he's walking inside of us
[1:08:09] now everybody I'm talking about that
[1:08:11] kind of hand of Jehovah going to
[1:08:14] minister is he is his honor thy gift
[1:08:18] going to minister to the needs of the
[1:08:20] people
[1:08:21] when there are people that are having uh
[1:08:24] uh uh illnesses in their life what the
[1:08:26] devil is taking some right to stand
[1:08:28] there and he will go out the tender
[1:08:31] hands of Jehovah through vision will
[1:08:33] reveal what is their problem
[1:08:39] praise the Lord and is that same tender
[1:08:42] hands that comes through the preaching
[1:08:44] of the word
[1:08:47] it might look like a rebuke
[1:08:51] it makes us to feel uncomfortable
[1:08:55] praise the Lord
[1:08:59] that's the reason why the scripture says
[1:09:01] we can never stand God's judgment we
[1:09:03] must not even ask for the hand of the
[1:09:05] Lord we must not ask for him to lay his
[1:09:08] hands on us we must only ask him to pick
[1:09:10] us up
[1:09:12] praise the Lord
[1:09:13] no matter what we are going through he's
[1:09:15] only picking us up to bring us to a
[1:09:18] better place
[1:09:30] attend the hands of Jehovah
[1:09:35] I know every one of us
[1:09:39] has gone through one thing
[1:09:42] or the other
[1:09:46] praise the Lord
[1:09:49] and sometimes to the onlooker
[1:09:53] you just think wow that thing is not
[1:09:55] trying
[1:09:57] praise the Lord
[1:09:58] it's only not trial because you are not
[1:10:00] in it right
[1:10:03] it's only not a trial because you are
[1:10:06] not in it
[1:10:07] that's right wow they say what they call
[1:10:09] trial wow it's because you are not in it
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:17] because when you are in a trial is is is
[1:10:21] is difficult it's difficult it takes
[1:10:23] time for it to hit you that this is a
[1:10:25] Triumph
[1:10:27] you you first don't see it as a try you
[1:10:30] see it that the whole world is against
[1:10:31] you everybody don't like you
[1:10:35] your whole world is crashing at you we
[1:10:37] don't see it I said try it
[1:10:45] I used to turn the hands of Jehovah
[1:10:50] the tender hands of Jehovah you you just
[1:10:53] think about that
[1:10:56] tender hand is picking us out dealing
[1:11:00] with us spiritually
[1:11:01] but look at those photos
[1:11:04] look at those people going through the
[1:11:06] gas chamber
[1:11:08] right how can you understand that in
[1:11:12] your mind to be the tender hand when
[1:11:14] he's the very God that deliver one man
[1:11:16] down there in the lion then give
[1:11:19] something such a great power to split a
[1:11:21] lion into two
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:40] for Social Power he opened the red seed
[1:11:42] you know how many how many
[1:11:45] good
[1:11:47] decent
[1:11:50] Christians
[1:11:52] theologians that that very thing has
[1:11:55] stumbled
[1:12:03] and they dropped their Bible they won't
[1:12:05] read it anymore
[1:12:08] they won't believe that God that has in
[1:12:10] his word and opening the Red Sea
[1:12:14] when he couldn't stop cruel-hearted man
[1:12:16] like Hitler
[1:12:34] he loved the Lord tonight
[1:12:40] try to bring this to a close
[1:12:44] so we can find some time to speak to the
[1:12:46] Lord tonight
[1:12:53] but just like I said brother Brandon is
[1:12:56] placing this within the tear Exodus he's
[1:12:59] associating this
[1:13:02] he's associating base
[1:13:05] with the first accident
[1:13:08] how their rose up a pharaoh
[1:13:13] that they didn't know Joseph
[1:13:17] praise the Lord
[1:13:19] amen and he will go back
[1:13:23] and talk about how even Joseph got into
[1:13:26] Egypt
[1:13:27] it was just jealousy of his brothers
[1:13:32] praise the Lord now that the Egyptians
[1:13:35] are Egyptians they are not Hebrews but
[1:13:37] before he could get to the Egyptians for
[1:13:40] for for the Hebrews to be punished by
[1:13:42] the Egypt right in the same house
[1:13:47] in the same family
[1:13:53] jealousy
[1:13:59] they got jealous
[1:14:05] and they decided to sell him
[1:14:09] right in the same family
[1:14:13] praise the Lord
[1:14:14] just like we were speaking on Sunday
[1:14:19] you see why they can cause a church if a
[1:14:21] people don't rightly discern the body of
[1:14:23] the Lord
[1:14:26] and they will just sit there with a lot
[1:14:28] of comparison in their mind
[1:14:31] you are not doing Justice to yourself
[1:14:34] you are not doing Justice to yourself
[1:14:37] because this is the place you call
[1:14:39] Church
[1:14:40] this is the place you come
[1:14:45] can you imagine what that would be like
[1:14:48] where you call home
[1:14:50] your parents are endlessly laboring and
[1:14:53] doing everything for you
[1:14:56] and then you feel so pleased with the
[1:14:58] neighbor's house and just look at your
[1:15:01] house as a trash
[1:15:05] and that's that very same trash you're
[1:15:06] going to sleep in
[1:15:11] praise the Lord
[1:15:20] if they would just realize that
[1:15:22] is going to carry them hundreds of years
[1:15:25] under slavery something that their
[1:15:27] children children will suffer from
[1:15:30] just one jealousy
[1:15:36] praise the Lord
[1:15:44] we know that's a word of God 400 years
[1:15:46] your people will so joined in The
[1:15:47] Strange Land we know that's the word of
[1:15:49] God they could not bypass it but you
[1:15:51] just think for the moment
[1:15:54] what it could have been if they would
[1:15:56] have rallied around Joseph
[1:16:01] and say oh wow
[1:16:17] just in the same house
[1:16:19] they are jealous around them over into
[1:16:23] Egypt into slavery then our year comes
[1:16:26] another Joseph again you you realize
[1:16:28] that all of those things is happening
[1:16:30] right under the end time spirit
[1:16:35] praise the Lord
[1:16:38] because you'll find bunch of these men
[1:16:41] that are having problems with the move
[1:16:42] of God the message of the hour it's just
[1:16:45] a spirit of jealousy many many of them
[1:16:47] has thought they will rise to that place
[1:16:51] now this gave us now for Brother Brad
[1:16:53] I'm alone
[1:16:55] but I call into God's plan it was just
[1:16:58] one man right
[1:17:01] right behold I send you Elijah there is
[1:17:03] no s
[1:17:04] it was not Elijah's
[1:17:09] praise the Lord
[1:17:13] just a spirit of jealousy
[1:17:17] that God will pick up an electric man
[1:17:19] with no education and every one of them
[1:17:22] with their degree will sit right back
[1:17:24] there
[1:17:26] he can highly pronounce his words good
[1:17:29] but yet they can see the demonstration
[1:17:31] of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:35] praise the Lord
[1:17:42] can you imagine what it was
[1:17:45] sitting down behind behind a prophet
[1:17:49] and he's telling people what is on their
[1:17:51] mind
[1:17:55] you're trying everything to be in your
[1:17:57] best behavior
[1:17:59] and brother Brown can say I can feed it
[1:18:02] some of you are doubting me
[1:18:05] can you imagine what it is
[1:18:10] to walk with a man that can just look in
[1:18:12] your life and tell you exactly the
[1:18:14] things you are doing
[1:18:19] how many of those Pentecostal preachers
[1:18:21] and even preachers around the message
[1:18:23] who have love
[1:18:25] to rush to that place
[1:18:27] where they can hold the people
[1:18:30] they can hold them hold their nose by
[1:18:32] their finger
[1:18:35] because they should just have a dream
[1:18:38] and somebody should just appear in that
[1:18:40] room to them now it's a divine
[1:18:41] revelation God has spoken to them I saw
[1:18:44] this brother is this I saw him in my
[1:18:46] dream
[1:18:48] praise the Lord
[1:18:50] well sometimes the dream gives you only
[1:18:53] a Cause
[1:18:56] and they don't give you the result
[1:19:02] praise the Lord
[1:19:05] are we together
[1:19:08] so among the brothers it was a spirit of
[1:19:11] jealousy
[1:19:12] over in Egypt
[1:19:16] it was now a pharaoh
[1:19:20] praise the Lord
[1:19:23] that they didn't know Joseph
[1:19:26] that they might regarded no spiritual
[1:19:29] dream do you know what would have
[1:19:31] happened to Egypt Egypt who have who
[1:19:33] have now been in Egypt if it was not
[1:19:35] because Joseph could interpret their
[1:19:38] dreams and he received the nation not
[1:19:40] only Egypt he said the present word his
[1:19:44] gift save the present word
[1:19:47] his gift was enough as Jesus on the
[1:19:50] cross of calvary
[1:19:54] explaining to them a year a seven year
[1:19:57] of surplus and seven years of farming
[1:20:06] praise the Lord
[1:20:07] but yet there will be a man that will
[1:20:10] raise up and despise
[1:20:14] they will despise the name who is Joseph
[1:20:17] those are all in days and there will be
[1:20:20] men that will raise up
[1:20:29] if God did not had a man in his hands
[1:20:33] to turn our heart back to the apostolic
[1:20:35] fathers
[1:20:37] praise the Lord
[1:20:38] some of us won't have the life that we
[1:20:40] have
[1:20:42] praise the Lord who will marry the wives
[1:20:45] that we might will not even raise the
[1:20:47] family that we have raised
[1:20:53] in church
[1:20:56] praise the Lord with all with all the
[1:20:59] truth that is given to us we are still
[1:21:01] struggling
[1:21:04] to compose ourselves
[1:21:07] Wilderness is still coming in and out of
[1:21:10] the church how much more that we did not
[1:21:12] have uh a Revere word
[1:21:19] so you see a spirit that is rising up to
[1:21:22] despise
[1:21:25] the gift that has brought us this
[1:21:27] Liberty
[1:21:32] it has to be part of the Exeter it was
[1:21:35] in the first Exeter it was in the second
[1:21:37] Exeter it has to be in our Exeter
[1:21:42] but you see there's going to be a little
[1:21:44] bride that is going to bear it
[1:21:47] she's not going to understand everything
[1:21:49] because when you are in the tender hands
[1:21:51] of Jehovah you don't understand
[1:21:52] everything
[1:21:57] you only believe that God is in control
[1:22:00] and you believe that he has the last
[1:22:03] word
[1:22:05] praise the Lord
[1:22:11] you will be a little bride that will
[1:22:13] that will that that would be gathered by
[1:22:15] the tender hand of Jehovah she would
[1:22:17] come under the Press
[1:22:27] the Lord
[1:22:31] brother Brandon says the church has
[1:22:33] always done its best
[1:22:36] under pressure
[1:22:39] she has always done is her best on the
[1:22:43] persecution
[1:22:47] praise the Lord
[1:22:51] sometimes
[1:22:53] they take our hardest trial
[1:22:58] to bring
[1:23:03] some of our best moments
[1:23:06] but you see it is not the moment that
[1:23:09] you that you would capture
[1:23:11] is the moment the heavens capture
[1:23:18] praise the Lord sometimes it takes hour
[1:23:20] hour
[1:23:22] hardest trial
[1:23:26] can you imagine
[1:23:29] going through something in a state of
[1:23:31] confusion
[1:23:34] praise the Lord
[1:23:39] be in a state of confusion
[1:23:42] and you just say oh God
[1:23:46] and sometimes that's the movement that
[1:23:48] heaven like
[1:23:51] haven't just captured that
[1:23:54] so the father is so beautiful
[1:24:07] oh may God give us Grace
[1:24:11] may God give us Grace and may God help
[1:24:13] us
[1:24:14] praise the Lord
[1:24:17] may he give us Grace
[1:24:21] help us as individuals help us as a
[1:24:24] family help us as a church
[1:24:33] because
[1:24:35] I mean that's the path that we we will
[1:24:37] have to go it will take the tender hand
[1:24:39] of Jehovah
[1:24:40] support us in the Promised Land
[1:24:44] praise the Lord
[1:24:45] sometimes we have a
[1:24:48] loved ones
[1:24:50] and I you know I've said this
[1:24:54] in a while
[1:24:57] brother John Bibi then his wife you know
[1:25:00] I've got to know them when I got here
[1:25:03] and uh
[1:25:06] here in order
[1:25:08] you I was I was I was very fond of him
[1:25:11] because it looks like at a certain at a
[1:25:13] certain point of time it looks like uh
[1:25:18] we were we were we were chasing one
[1:25:21] another
[1:25:22] because you know he was living here in
[1:25:24] Brooklyn Center and I've you know
[1:25:26] sometimes I will come come from work and
[1:25:28] just and just come come right in there
[1:25:30] and I will you know find him right here
[1:25:33] just just praying and lifting different
[1:25:36] things to the Lord and you know and
[1:25:39] sometimes he will wish that I don't see
[1:25:41] him praise the Lord
[1:25:43] and uh
[1:25:46] but I'll tell you he's doing okay amen
[1:25:48] he's uh his body going through a lot of
[1:25:51] pains it's hard to witness you know
[1:25:54] that's that's that's what the human body
[1:25:56] cannot handle you know when you see a
[1:25:59] loved one
[1:26:01] the one that you love
[1:26:04] and you are just at a place where there
[1:26:07] is nothing you can do
[1:26:09] there is just nothing Himalayan
[1:26:11] that you can do even if you choose to
[1:26:14] change places
[1:26:17] humanly it can never be done
[1:26:22] praise the Lord
[1:26:24] and sometimes it's not only that person
[1:26:26] that is in the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:26:28] even you yourself
[1:26:31] you are in the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:26:33] because God is using that situation to
[1:26:37] work on you
[1:26:47] musicians you can come tonight
[1:26:51] praise the Lord
[1:27:12] thank you

[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:30] not just by our house together tonight
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:50] what you see this is it's it's glorious
[1:27:53] and it's pressure
[1:27:55] very precious
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:01] we might go through a state of confusion
[1:28:05] most of the time that's the first state
[1:28:07] you you are in a state of confusion you
[1:28:10] can really identify yourself you can
[1:28:12] identify why these things are happening
[1:28:14] you can identify who is the cause and
[1:28:17] you are just in a state of confusion
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:28] but almighty God will take us through
[1:28:31] another state
[1:28:34] where he will come around and and try to
[1:28:37] reassure us
[1:28:42] he will come and bring some comfort
[1:28:45] even though he might not take the pain
[1:28:47] away but you you bring he will just
[1:28:49] bring a sense of comfort
[1:28:51] he will set that in tears what comes
[1:28:54] from your eyes and
[1:28:56] and you will remember the thing that the
[1:28:58] Lord has done and how the Lord has been
[1:29:00] good and how the Lord has been merciful
[1:29:02] and you will think about all of those
[1:29:04] things and you were just weak it still
[1:29:06] does not taste the pain away it does not
[1:29:08] change the situation
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:17] imagine how many nights those Jewish men
[1:29:20] they met together

[1:29:24] they will not even want to hear the name
[1:29:26] about Jehovah don't talk about Yahweh
[1:29:29] don't remind us about about our arrested
[1:29:32] to them there is nowhere to put those
[1:29:35] stories together

[1:29:46] and myself
[1:29:48] he will say blindness happened to Israel
[1:29:53] foreign
[1:29:56] his people
[1:29:59] so the gospel can come to you and myself

[1:30:50] we can just when it come to the place
[1:30:53] and surrounded ourself if we can just
[1:30:56] only just just just get a grip of him

[1:31:06] to hold you tight

[1:31:33] thoughts of evil
