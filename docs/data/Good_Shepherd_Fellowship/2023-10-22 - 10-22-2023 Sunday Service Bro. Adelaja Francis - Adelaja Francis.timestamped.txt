[10:21] Justice uh I'm not a kind of cameram man
[10:24] I don't love coming up here because I'm
[10:26] not a public speaker but um you know
[10:29] sometime when God does something in your
[10:31] life you just don't want to keep sitting
[10:33] back that you want to come in from and
[10:36] just give God all the
[10:37] glory
[10:38] [Music]
[10:40] um this is all about my daughter um
[10:43] she's personally with us here in service
[10:47] today um I would just sum this whole
[10:50] thing up
[10:53] uh it was couple of years back um pretty
[10:57] much I want to say like seven to8 years
[11:02] um my wife and myself we had the um
[11:05] opportunity to travel to the United
[11:08] States
[11:10] so but then my daughter was just 3
[11:13] months
[11:14] old
[11:17] and I mean you know we we were scheduled
[11:21] to pick our visa from the embassy on a
[11:24] Tuesday Morning a Tuesday afternoon
[11:26] rather so
[11:29] Tuesday around like 4:00 a.m. in the
[11:32] morning my wife got in the liver pain
[11:35] and she gave birth to my daughter who
[11:37] sit here right
[11:39] now
[11:40] so that's that Tuesday in the afternoon
[11:43] we were to appear to the embassi to get
[11:45] our Visa so I went to the ambassy
[11:48] and and just explain you know everything
[11:51] to the counselors and they were like
[11:54] okay if you can get um the child
[11:57] ready you can go with the child to the
[11:59] United States so and all we needed was
[12:03] 600 United 650 United stat to get her
[12:06] ready but we never had a money so
[12:10] um we were unable to bring our daughter
[12:13] so we left her with my mom at the age of
[12:16] uh three months
[12:17] old and I mean it was really hard for us
[12:22] it was really hard so we came and then
[12:25] pretty much after 2 years we decided to
[12:28] P in our p two to three years we decid
[12:30] to put in their
[12:31] paperwork and then um before putting in
[12:34] the paperwork um decid I decided
[12:37] actually to talk with a lawyer
[12:39] concerning the entire process so then
[12:42] this lawyer based on what I explained to
[12:46] him he would then tell me that you
[12:49] know getting my children here would be
[12:52] really
[12:53] difficult because I would have to go
[12:55] through courot martiall and it was just
[12:57] a lot that he told me so I brother one
[12:59] on the phone and then I explain
[13:01] everything to brother
[13:02] one so brother one said um you know I
[13:08] don't think you guys have to go in the
[13:10] way of the lawyer because immigration
[13:12] did not get back to you people
[13:13] immigration did not ask you any question
[13:15] concerning your children then why you
[13:16] want to go back to lawyer you know so uh
[13:20] based on what brother one told me they
[13:22] you know the advis he gave my wife and
[13:24] myself you know we just asked him to
[13:26] just keep us in prayer and then we went
[13:29] about uh doing the paperwork brother Max
[13:31] was one of those that helped me in the
[13:34] process of you know doing all of the
[13:35] paperwork for my children so we
[13:37] submitted the paperwork in and then it
[13:40] took like three and a half
[13:44] years so after three and a half
[13:49] years immigration got back to me and
[13:53] they were ready to give my children
[13:55] Visa so you know our just so excited
[13:59] about it
[14:02] and they told me to tell the boy and the
[14:05] girl to go to the Embassy to get a Visa
[14:08] so when my father-in-law took them there
[14:11] they would not give the boy a Visa
[14:13] that's the reason the boy is not even
[14:14] here with us
[14:15] today so they told me then they called
[14:18] me direct the the the the embassy called
[14:20] me directly from the um from the country
[14:25] and they told me that you know um we
[14:29] will only give your daughter the Visa we
[14:30] will not give your son the visa for what
[14:32] reason up to now I don't even know but
[14:35] anyway just to you know sum everything
[14:37] up they give my daughter the Visa and
[14:40] you know by the grace of God brother
[14:41] Hillary and his family they were in
[14:42] Liberia and I just called them and
[14:45] talked to them about it and they were
[14:47] willing to bring my daughter and they
[14:48] brought the girl uh while coming back to
[14:51] the United States so um I just want to
[14:54] be thankful to God for everything that
[14:56] he has done I know Grandma Kelly and
[14:59] brother Ste uh brother Steve have been
[15:01] really praying for us in regard to our
[15:03] children including brother ju and I
[15:05] believe most of the s in here today so
[15:09] I'm just so thankful to almighty God
[15:11] that my daughter can you know join us in
[15:14] the United State here and we are still
[15:16] looking forward to having the board to
[15:18] also join with us so thank you all for

[27:43] friend uh uh pressure friend of of hers
[27:47] and uh um she want to
[27:52] [Music]
[27:56] testify
[28:12] um so while we were singing this song um
[28:15] I just got back from Israel and um I was
[28:18] there for six weeks with a place called
[28:21] highl we were able to work The Vineyards
[28:23] for six weeks and help the um
[28:26] settlements of Judea and Samaria and I
[28:29] just think of where it says there were
[28:31] there will be Showers of Blessings um
[28:34] this is the promise of love and I really
[28:36] got to experience that I just want to
[28:38] testify because one thing he said we
[28:40] would be able to do when we come back is
[28:42] Testify the beauty of working the land
[28:45] for the children of Israel in their hard
[28:47] times and in their need and then it says
[28:51] there shall be seasons of refreshing
[28:54] working those
[28:55] Vineyards um what was a season of
[28:58] refreshing for me because I got to put
[29:02] my hand to something so
[29:05] precious to God's
[29:08] heart and I always wanted to go there
[29:11] but my friend said I want you to go
[29:12] there and you need to serve because you
[29:14] know we go on tours we see the SS we're
[29:18] touched but it says um sent from the
[29:20] Savior above I really think it was a
[29:22] Divine appointment to go there and be
[29:25] with them people and see the love of the
[29:27] land that they had and
[29:30] that um it says the Bible says Those Who
[29:33] bless Israel are blessed and I was just
[29:36] showered with blessings from them by
[29:39] serving them and I just wanted to share
[29:42] that with you that um it was actually
[29:46] kind of hard to leave because the needs
[29:49] are even more and actually when we were
[29:53] flying back we had a lot of turbulence I
[29:56] actually was more afraid of the plane
[29:58] flying back than being in the midst of
[30:00] the Land There was such a precious um
[30:04] protection there even though a lot of
[30:06] atrocities occurred um there are
[30:10] Miracles when you are in the blessings
[30:12] of God no matter what you're doing
[30:15] wherever you're at and I just want to
[30:17] testify that I love that you guys
[30:20] testify um out every place gives you
[30:22] that opportunity you know to do that and
[30:25] I just want to let you know that it was
[30:27] I hope to go back I don't want to be
[30:30] presumptuous that I get to go back but
[30:32] when we were in Jerusalem during the
[30:34] holidays of
[30:35] sukot I ordered some fish and chips and
[30:38] I was waiting you know for them to be
[30:40] made and I'm listening to the person um
[30:43] the pizza guy um and he didn't say this
[30:47] to anyone else but my heart you know
[30:49] wants to go back and he handed me my
[30:53] fish and chips and he goes I'll see you
[30:54] next year in Jerusalem I just wanted to
[30:56] scream praise the Lord but I'm like keep
[30:59] your cool thank you yep thus sayth the
[31:03] Lord know but I I just kept calm because
[31:06] that may not be How They Roll um but um
[31:10] what's also really beautiful is um we
[31:13] were part of hael they're a Tennessee
[31:16] family and they got
[31:18] soul and I was like you know I knew I
[31:22] wanted to come with Naomi to her church
[31:24] I haven't been to your church before and
[31:27] and it was so refreshing to know that
[31:28] there's Soul here you know what I mean
[31:31] it's refreshing like it's saying and
[31:34] this song just really you know spoke to
[31:36] me because that's not
[31:38] everywhere and um I miss it over there
[31:42] and I'm apprecia that I was able to come
[31:44] today and be part of that with you guys
[31:47] and so I just want to let you know
[31:50] that praise the Lord thank
[31:56] you
[31:57] praise the Lord praise the Lord we thank
[32:00] the Lord for that and uh and thank you
[32:04] for serving the people of Israel

[32:12] uh back there on the on the bulletin uh
[32:15] brother uh uh there are some uh messages
[32:21] that I put up uh life story 19 19
[32:28] 1959 April 19 and also the message God
[32:35] uh brother brother Ariel uh working with
[32:39] the young people want to encourage us to
[32:44] be able to play those uh messages with
[32:46] our children and uh uh and they also
[32:51] have the uh uh time of uh Fellowship
[32:54] where they will they they will go
[32:56] through question questions and answers
[32:57] and different things but you see uh
[33:03] uh the powerful way one of the powerful
[33:06] way of teaching as it is in
[33:10] scripture is by
[33:13] examples no matter what we preach no
[33:16] matter what we instruct our children to
[33:19] do if
[33:21] uh if we are not making an example of
[33:25] it it will be hard for them to see the
[33:28] importance of doing
[33:30] that praise the
[33:32] Lord and uh and it's it's it's always a
[33:36] blessing and very important and uh when
[33:40] we can take time to read the Bible with
[33:43] our children listening to a message with
[33:46] them and and and be able to understand
[33:49] from their young mind what are they
[33:52] grapping from those words that they are
[33:54] listening to praise the Lord
[33:57] sometimes it might surprise you that
[33:59] they are getting more than you are
[34:01] getting uh sometimes it might surprise
[34:04] you or they might challenge you to go
[34:07] back and study the word praise the Lord
[34:10] so we want to encourage you to do that
[34:13] and uh uh there is also a prayer need
[34:16] here that we want to remember brother

[47:19] once again to have this opportunity to
[47:24] once again be in uh
[47:26] Minnesota I I think I've been here some
[47:30] years back about 6 years ago and uh so I
[47:34] know there are faces that were not that
[47:36] were here that we Fellowship together
[47:38] and they are not here anymore and then
[47:41] we still got the privilege by the grace
[47:43] of God to still have many of us that
[47:46] were here we were together some six
[47:47] years ago that we still here together to
[47:49] Fellowship this morning and then we
[47:51] still have new ones that we're meeting
[47:54] for the first time
[47:56] well I know I'm not part of you here but
[47:59] I don't I don't feel like a stranger
[48:00] actually no I don't I don't feel like a
[48:03] stranger uh God's people Jesus people
[48:07] are my people and Jesus friends are my
[48:09] friends and wherever people know the
[48:11] name of Jesus Christ I certainly am not
[48:14] going to be a stranger there and so that
[48:16] is why I feel uh very welcome by my
[48:21] friend here uh Pastor one I think U his
[48:25] min back in my church also back in in my
[48:29] country Nigeria and then uh I've uh
[48:33] since he came here I've had the
[48:34] privilege of passing by here and
[48:37] speaking for him once in a while I'm
[48:39] just I'm just just on my way I was just
[48:42] passing by but this about he about the
[48:45] only friend I've got left around North
[48:47] America here so I ain't got them many so
[48:52] I just thought it's not going to be good
[48:54] to pass by uh United States and then I I
[48:58] was just supposed to have a stop over on
[49:00] my way to Canada uh to have uh a
[49:04] vacation there and uh so but I just
[49:08] thought no it's not going to be nice if
[49:10] he was passing in Nigeria I would have
[49:12] said oh no it's good you pass by my
[49:14] place so that's why I planned it in such
[49:17] a way that as soon as I landed just
[49:19] spend uh maybe two days or so at New
[49:22] York then I find my way right here and
[49:25] then my go Grace within the week I'll be
[49:27] off to Canada and I'll be praying for
[49:30] you I trust you remember me in prayer
[49:33] the Lord bless you in the name of Jesus
[49:34] Christ God bless you my brother shalom
[49:37] it's nice to meet you and God bless you
[49:39] richly now um it's a
[49:43] Pity
[49:46] that the prophet of God
[49:49] said in the debate of life as it were I
[49:53] can't qu the exact words the word words
[49:55] of men are always more heard than the
[49:59] words of
[50:00] God and it's such a sorrowful
[50:05] situation that you wake up every morning
[50:08] you look and see everybody's
[50:11] hustling everybody's hustling where the
[50:15] brother the friend that I stay with in
[50:16] New York he lived on the 24th floor and
[50:20] I said that's my first time of living
[50:21] that kind of a place in my life like a
[50:24] bird
[50:26] you know and uh I stand there I wake up
[50:31] like 2 2: a.m. and and I'm standing and
[50:35] I'm seeing cars are still moving people
[50:37] still going to work just everybody's
[50:39] just busy every everybody's
[50:43] running and then you begin to think then
[50:46] you think of that poet that said I look
[50:50] and
[50:51] see that Sor picture the whole M for
[50:57] selfish gain there are toils of Earth
[51:02] all this movement on the road is nothing
[51:06] but for
[51:07] what for ease and
[51:11] comfort that's
[51:12] it every gasoline that is burned on the
[51:16] highway every car is moving every waking
[51:20] up by 4:00
[51:22] a.m. and running is never for things of
[51:28] eternal
[51:30] life never when it comes to things of
[51:33] eternal life we get a nice sleep and
[51:36] wake up at 10 to 8:00 in the morning and
[51:38] then come around spend some 35 40
[51:42] minutes in the church and that's so much
[51:45] you know we just we got bills to pay
[51:47] going to go to pay man has not begin to
[51:50] live by for
[51:51] bills you've just
[51:54] become purely
[51:57] animalistic who single the forest life
[52:01] the life in the jungle is basically
[52:05] Survivor just wake up every money and
[52:07] look for what grass to
[52:09] eat only to build up a body that will be
[52:12] used by lion that's all there's nothing
[52:16] the deer that is eating every day and
[52:18] getting Fir and robust and feeling nice
[52:21] where is it going to end
[52:24] up so human
[52:26] beings the devil has just so quick
[52:29] twisted our
[52:32] lives that we have basically become
[52:36] purely
[52:38] animalistic without even
[52:41] knowing wake up every day there is
[52:45] nothing about
[52:47] tomorrow life tomorrow where am I going
[52:52] after leaving here where's the next bus
[52:54] stop where am I heading to I got a few
[52:57] years to spend
[52:59] here those that live this same life 100
[53:01] years ago where are they what happened
[53:04] to them where am I
[53:07] going we we just leave just run and run
[53:11] and run and run and things of eternal
[53:13] life just take second place in fact not
[53:16] TI of fourth place sometimes and they
[53:18] just about a soring picture the hold
[53:21] move just just just eat and drink for
[53:23] tomorrow just just leave just leave pay
[53:25] bill pay your bill pay your bill send
[53:26] your children know just pay bill just
[53:28] pay bill just pay bills you know and we
[53:30] just become Perpetual
[53:33] depts never
[53:35] free our Visions have become largely
[53:41] distorted what a break of heart it is to
[53:45] God that a whole man that I made have
[53:50] become a subject of what to eat and
[53:53] drink and what kind of house to live in
[53:57] you know when I'm what kind of car to
[54:00] drive that's how can I hold human
[54:03] life in the image of God be
[54:07] reduced be that is what you call
[54:10] decimation is
[54:13] decimated how can a whole human life be
[54:16] so decimated all it thinks about all he
[54:20] lives for all he works
[54:22] for is just EAS just to make life
[54:26] easier and more comfortable and at the
[54:29] end of it where does it end up
[54:34] gve you got more you got more time to
[54:37] spend in the grave than you spending
[54:38] right here
[54:40] now so true so what what's the end of it
[54:44] all so eternal life matters have taken
[54:46] backstage I I pray God helps us this
[54:49] morning to just what what your computer
[54:52] comes
[54:53] redirecting to direct the system to look
[54:57] the right way and relax ourselves and
[54:59] just let's just think about things of
[55:03] life things that are
[55:05] higher things that are
[55:08] nobler let's not just
[55:11] become
[55:14] animals just look at things that are
[55:16] higher things that are nobler let those
[55:19] things are aside let those things be the
[55:22] things we live for we think about
[55:26] because here we've got no continuous
[55:30] City ER seek for the one that is to
[55:35] come this party is soon
[55:39] ending see this party see this church
[55:42] you see all this it's soon
[55:45] ending if you don't quit it it will quit
[55:49] you what we have to do so we want to
[55:52] think on these things this morning as
[55:55] way I I got some things in my heart you
[56:00] know it's always difficult you know
[56:02] coming
[56:03] here you have a lot of things to think
[56:06] you know you'll be thinking oh man I got
[56:09] to get the shortest seron I have so that
[56:12] people don't get angry and leave you
[56:14] know you get a lot of things to think
[56:15] that you don't think back home in
[56:17] Africa you you you think a lot of things
[56:21] then you think of the shortest sermon
[56:22] and it's very bad should I should think
[56:24] of the sermon that is the will of God
[56:26] and not the one that is
[56:28] shot you know and uh then you think
[56:31] about that then you
[56:33] think
[56:35] uh of again how easy it is for you to
[56:39] get through it so I was actually having
[56:41] in
[56:42] mind coming here I thought today I was
[56:45] going to speak on a subject because
[56:47] we've got a lot of troubles around us
[56:49] I'm sorry for people that are maybe new
[56:52] Among Us and uh and are not uh used to
[56:55] our language please I pray you bear with
[56:57] me I'm a visitor here so your pastor
[56:59] will continue the regular sermon so I
[57:02] just I just got I just got this morning
[57:04] alone I was going to speak on Wednesday
[57:07] here again but I'm told I've been
[57:08] scheduled for hour to preach with
[57:12] brother Isaiah Brook so on Wednesday so
[57:14] I'm not going to so that effectively
[57:16] means I just have this morning to speak
[57:19] here and um so I you know so he's going
[57:23] to continue there but for me I want to
[57:25] address
[57:26] some things you know you know there's a
[57:30] way the word of God goes there was a
[57:33] time that the Bible said there were two
[57:35] disciples in the Book of Luke chapter 24
[57:37] the Bible say there were two disciples
[57:39] that were walking on their way to a
[57:40] miles and they were
[57:42] sad and there was a stranger that came
[57:45] out and joined him and he said what
[57:49] Manner they were talking the Bible said
[57:51] they were talking about they were they
[57:53] were talking about all the things that
[57:56] has happened to them among them and in
[58:00] the city of Jerusalem around that time
[58:05] they weren't actually discussing about
[58:06] the preachings the previous preachings
[58:09] of Jesus no no no no no they were not
[58:12] they were so
[58:13] heartbroken they were so sad they were
[58:16] so confused as as a matter of
[58:19] fact all they have tried to live their
[58:22] life for all they gave their life for
[58:24] they left their country home of Emos and
[58:27] they have literally relocated and left
[58:29] their job to follow the man if you look
[58:31] at the conversation I won't have time to
[58:33] read all of that if you look at the
[58:35] conversation in the Book of Luke chapter
[58:37] 24 he said and we trusted that it could
[58:40] have been this man that would have saved
[58:42] Israel from his
[58:44] problems and now he's crucified and
[58:47] beside today is the third day so the
[58:50] Bible said they weren
[58:52] discussing the preachings that Jesus
[58:54] Jesus Christ has preached before they
[58:56] weren't discussing the wonderful Sermon
[58:58] on the Mount and all of that they were
[59:00] discussing about the current
[59:02] affairs the things that has happened
[59:05] among them and has saided it broke them
[59:10] because what they have devoted their
[59:12] entire life for has suddenly come to an
[59:16] end or so they thought and so the fils
[59:21] had broken and that was what we were
[59:23] discussing when this stranger joined
[59:26] himself with them but you notice this
[59:29] when he joined himself with them and
[59:31] they told him are you he said what
[59:32] manner of conversation is this that you
[59:34] have they say thou a
[59:35] stranger in Israel so if you're a
[59:39] stranger in
[59:41] Israel I pray you just kindly bear with
[59:44] me this morning yeah it's possible to be
[59:46] a stranger in Israel because we're in
[59:49] Israel now we're talking to the Israel
[59:50] okay you know the a sister just talking
[59:53] about the visiting is Israel there yeah
[59:55] that is what the Bible
[59:58] call the natural Israel the real Israel
[1:00:02] the Bible say not
[1:00:05] all that are Israel are of
[1:00:09] Israel yeah the the the tribe of Israel
[1:00:14] is actually not
[1:00:17] traced by the physical
[1:00:20] DNA Judas carried the DNA if you test
[1:00:23] the blood of Judas it's Carri and you
[1:00:25] test the Blood of Abraham you will
[1:00:26] notice that he come from that tribe but
[1:00:29] Jesus say you of your father the
[1:00:32] devil even though the physical blood is
[1:00:34] traceable to Abraham Jesus say you are
[1:00:36] not Abraham's
[1:00:37] seed meaning there's another way of
[1:00:39] reconing Abraham seed that is deeper and
[1:00:43] higher than the physical blood the
[1:00:45] people that crucify Jesus Jesus said you
[1:00:47] have the fire you have your father the
[1:00:48] devil they say we they say we are
[1:00:50] Abraham seed if you were Abraham seed
[1:00:52] you canot kill me he said because
[1:00:54] because Abraham rejoiced to see my day
[1:00:56] saw it I was glad Abraham rejoiced to
[1:00:57] see my day so Jesus provided another
[1:01:01] means of identifying Abraham seed and
[1:01:03] they call it the the test the proof of
[1:01:08] Abraham's
[1:01:10] seed is the belief of
[1:01:15] Abraham if if you saw if you were
[1:01:19] Abraham's seed you will see what Abraham
[1:01:22] See Saw and you will believe what he
[1:01:24] believes that is what proves you that is
[1:01:27] why it is said of the seed which is of
[1:01:29] faith of Abraham there is a defining
[1:01:32] characteristics of Abraham in the Bible
[1:01:35] the defining characteristic of Abraham
[1:01:37] is not ability to to breathe that's
[1:01:40] characteristic of General characteristic
[1:01:43] of living things living things breathe
[1:01:45] living things uh respirate living things
[1:01:49] you know those stuff you learn in the in
[1:01:51] the in the elementary school you
[1:01:53] understand
[1:01:54] that's not the defining characteristic
[1:01:56] of Abraham the defining characteristic
[1:01:58] of
[1:01:59] Abraham Paul said in the Book of Romans
[1:02:02] chapter 4 he says what shall we say then
[1:02:04] that Abraham our father has
[1:02:07] discovered he say it was Faith ability
[1:02:12] to
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:14] believe what is
[1:02:19] impossible What God Says and there is
[1:02:22] nothing that declares it to natur let me
[1:02:24] tell you this you have four ways five
[1:02:27] mechanisms of believing either you see
[1:02:29] it to believe it you hear it there's
[1:02:31] only one thing that makes you to know
[1:02:33] that there's a brother from Nigeria
[1:02:35] Brother Francis that is talking to you
[1:02:36] this morning but you can see him and you
[1:02:38] can hear him if you can't see him you
[1:02:40] cannot hear him how do you know he's
[1:02:42] here what's a proof how do you know so
[1:02:47] it's your s your hearing the five senses
[1:02:50] that declare but Abraham got another
[1:02:53] thing that goes beyond beyond that when
[1:02:55] sight cannot tell you something when
[1:02:58] hearing cannot tell you something when
[1:03:00] feeling cannot tell you something then
[1:03:02] God can tell you that
[1:03:04] thing and that was what that was the
[1:03:06] defining character that's what makes him
[1:03:08] to identify the Savior the Lord Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ and he rejoice and these other
[1:03:12] people did not have that characteristic
[1:03:13] and that is why Jesus said you were not
[1:03:15] Abraham's
[1:03:17] seed amen you have your devil and yet
[1:03:19] they have the DNA of Abraham so if you
[1:03:22] are talking about the Israelite there
[1:03:24] this is the real Israel of God the B St
[1:03:27] Paul was talking to the church he say
[1:03:29] and now to the Israel of
[1:03:32] God the Bible say not all Israel of
[1:03:34] Israel the Bible say we take on the Seed
[1:03:37] of Abraham Christ by faith when we
[1:03:40] believe that's why the Bible say the
[1:03:42] Seed of Abraham shall be in all nations
[1:03:45] people are still looking for Seed of
[1:03:46] Abraham in jerus in Israel no no no no
[1:03:48] it's it has done pass It's All inde
[1:03:52] Shall how many families of the Earth
[1:03:56] you understand brother Bram say I am
[1:03:59] more Jewish than a Jew in
[1:04:04] Israel yeah absolutely all right let's
[1:04:06] leave that so what I'm saying it's
[1:04:08] possible for somebody to be a stranger
[1:04:10] in Israel so I'm sorry if you a stranger
[1:04:14] in Israel this morning you will bear
[1:04:15] with us uh I want to address some things
[1:04:18] that has happened to us Among Us of
[1:04:20] recent I was going to talk to you there
[1:04:23] has been a a lot of noise around around
[1:04:26] all over the Internet a lot of
[1:04:28] information a lot of information
[1:04:31] disinformation and Miss information Miss
[1:04:34] together yeah that's serious when you
[1:04:37] have
[1:04:39] information
[1:04:41] misinformation and
[1:04:43] disinformation all mixed together it
[1:04:46] creates a
[1:04:49] complex in which you don't even know
[1:04:52] which way to go and that is actually the
[1:04:55] program of Satan some people will not
[1:04:58] believe anything they simply say I don't
[1:05:00] know what to believe so therefore I
[1:05:01] believe
[1:05:04] none and that again is part of Satan's
[1:05:07] program right I don't want I don't want
[1:05:09] to to risk I don't want to risk
[1:05:11] believing the same thing so I end up
[1:05:13] believing
[1:05:15] none it's just like being given a a
[1:05:17] question paper and they answer and they
[1:05:19] given a question a b c you look at it
[1:05:22] and say I don't choose none I don't
[1:05:23] choose n is still
[1:05:26] wrong you still get the same
[1:05:29] zero as the person that chose the wrong
[1:05:31] thing so taking the idea of I'm not
[1:05:36] going to take anyone does not save you
[1:05:38] from the Wrath right so it's not an
[1:05:41] Escape Route we got to Jesus said we've
[1:05:44] we we we you you got the
[1:05:48] assignment that you must know truth it's
[1:05:52] not an option
[1:05:56] there's no option to it you got to know
[1:05:59] truth or you are done you are dead you
[1:06:04] are a
[1:06:05] gunner there is no option to knowing the
[1:06:08] truth we just got to know the truth and
[1:06:11] because that is our only way to freedom
[1:06:15] to
[1:06:16] Salvation now so there's been a lot like
[1:06:19] I said
[1:06:21] especially America is the base of every
[1:06:24] everything good to the Gentile World
[1:06:26] pram says a seat is an Israel of the
[1:06:29] Gentiles it's a seat of every every good
[1:06:33] thing that has happened as a matter of
[1:06:35] fact I took time to study all the
[1:06:39] inventions both scientific
[1:06:45] philosophical material and everything
[1:06:48] that has happened to the
[1:06:50] 21st 20th and 21st century every single
[1:06:54] one of them originate from America
[1:06:57] almost the percentage that goes come
[1:07:01] from any other countries they are
[1:07:03] negligible if you want to take all of
[1:07:06] these modern inventions of the computer
[1:07:09] the the the the the all those things are
[1:07:13] from here and what it is again the land
[1:07:17] where the truth that set men free the
[1:07:20] last move of God that was to free men
[1:07:22] and set them in order for the Rapture
[1:07:24] this was the land where he come from but
[1:07:26] I want to tell you also anywhere you
[1:07:28] find the right the wrong is always
[1:07:32] present anywhere you find the good the
[1:07:34] bad is always there I want you to notice
[1:07:37] this darkness is never far from light
[1:07:39] it's always a
[1:07:42] neor just watch it anywhere light
[1:07:45] stops that's why Darkness began they are
[1:07:48] neighbors they live together and so it
[1:07:51] becomes also every Force
[1:07:55] Hood every wrong
[1:07:58] idea every debasement as a matter of
[1:08:01] fact that was the absolute reason why
[1:08:04] brother bam under the spirit of the
[1:08:06] almighty God put a curse on the west
[1:08:08] coast of Los of California and he say he
[1:08:10] going to go down the ocean it doesn't
[1:08:12] matter what anybody
[1:08:15] think it stands quoting
[1:08:19] now so because of that when when you
[1:08:22] have all this mixed together
[1:08:24] it creates such a big problem that
[1:08:26] people don't even know which way to
[1:08:30] go so I was there's been a lot of stuffs
[1:08:35] out there in the news and on the on the
[1:08:37] net and all of that about the prophet
[1:08:40] about BR Braham about the message about
[1:08:42] all the things if you if if you just
[1:08:44] impute BR braham's name online the first
[1:08:47] set of people things that's going to
[1:08:48] greet you is how demonic he has been and
[1:08:51] all other those are the first things
[1:08:53] that will be flooding your your search
[1:08:56] engine and it's very it's always natural
[1:08:59] to want to begin when you Google it it
[1:09:02] happens to me the first one you you
[1:09:04] click on to start reading is the first
[1:09:05] one that appear first and many time by
[1:09:08] the time you finish reading the first
[1:09:09] one you don't you don't proceed and so
[1:09:12] you don't know the rest of the things
[1:09:13] that's there so this is the point now I
[1:09:16] don't know I not even find your watch
[1:09:18] why is the watch in the church oh thank
[1:09:20] you thank you so now where so this is
[1:09:25] how it
[1:09:26] works so because of that so I was going
[1:09:30] to because there been lot of stuff I
[1:09:32] wanted to actually approach the subject
[1:09:35] I titled was
[1:09:37] Moses on Mon sunset on February 28
[1:09:42] 1963 I wanted to take on that subject
[1:09:45] which people have taken and black all
[1:09:47] kinds of things have been spoken about
[1:09:49] and all kinds of things and I I wanted
[1:09:52] us to face it squarely we don't touch we
[1:09:55] don't touge
[1:09:57] facts we don't touge truth we follow
[1:10:01] facts where Le we're
[1:10:04] afraid because we know we' not believe
[1:10:07] we not believe conly divice
[1:10:10] fables if we are wrong we are humble
[1:10:13] enough and honest enough to admit that
[1:10:14] it's
[1:10:15] wrong I'm coming there and then I I
[1:10:19] thought on that then I look at it that
[1:10:21] hey this subject is going to take me a
[1:10:23] bit of time to to drive it through so
[1:10:26] okay let me leave it so I thought okay I
[1:10:28] was just going to talk to you on the
[1:10:30] last pH of this work this work that is
[1:10:33] going on the last phase of it and what
[1:10:35] will be happening among what's actually
[1:10:37] the state of things and why are things
[1:10:39] the way they are I wanted to speak on
[1:10:41] that and then that was what I prepared
[1:10:44] in my heart and then as I landed on
[1:10:47] Wednesday
[1:10:48] morning slept over the night the news
[1:10:52] that greeted me as I woke up on on
[1:10:53] Thursday morning is that the son of our
[1:10:56] beloved
[1:10:57] Prophet brother Billy Paul has gone to
[1:10:59] be with our lord
[1:11:01] said I said
[1:11:04] oh hey we're in
[1:11:07] trouble I said hey we are in trouble
[1:11:10] here because our
[1:11:13] cousins the twins our twin
[1:11:16] brothers that uh what you call I think
[1:11:20] you go online they call it living the
[1:11:22] message or ex message Believers I don't
[1:11:24] know whether you're you're familiar with
[1:11:26] them they call them living the message
[1:11:28] ex message Believers which has become
[1:11:31] like a Club International club with the
[1:11:33] headquarters here in America and uh and
[1:11:36] and Canada and then so and uh we I have
[1:11:39] a say back home when they started with
[1:11:44] with believe this sign because when
[1:11:46] believe this sign
[1:11:49] bug bites
[1:11:51] you you develop a Jun Callin
[1:11:55] syndrome and John Callin
[1:12:00] syndrome uh almost has no
[1:12:04] cure it's a
[1:12:06] particular is a particular strain of
[1:12:09] unbelief it's a strain is a particular
[1:12:13] strain of unbelief that is peculiar only
[1:12:15] to Christians belie of the message
[1:12:18] Christians that believe the message of
[1:12:20] brother William Braham and that unbelief
[1:12:22] works like this
[1:12:25] destroy William Branham at all
[1:12:32] cost kill Maline anybody that has any
[1:12:36] news against him accept it celebrate it
[1:12:41] anybody never mind facts never mind
[1:12:46] truth just keep on the attacking line
[1:12:50] because look at it this way it's it's a
[1:12:53] strain of of unbelief that is
[1:12:55] particularly allergic to William bram's
[1:12:58] name he has a serious
[1:13:01] allergy once he
[1:13:04] hears and it's mostly I was listening to
[1:13:06] your Sunday school this
[1:13:08] morning when B Brown was preaching and
[1:13:10] he was talking about that a woman was a
[1:13:13] judge in a particular City that woman
[1:13:15] has no business you know teach that take
[1:13:18] that to
[1:13:20] CNN and broadcast it by tomorrow morning
[1:13:24] what do you get 1 billion
[1:13:30] dislike unfollow him what unfollow and
[1:13:35] the internet will be a Gog what kind of
[1:13:38] a human being is this nobody is going to
[1:13:41] ask what does the word of God say no no
[1:13:44] no no no no no no no no nobody's going
[1:13:46] to ask what does the Bible say what did
[1:13:49] is he saying something different from
[1:13:51] what God Said in the Bible nobody's
[1:13:53] going to has that everybody's going to
[1:13:54] Bas on reasoning and they're going to be
[1:13:56] pouring all listen just that statement
[1:14:00] alone pick that statement alone just cut
[1:14:02] that two
[1:14:04] paragraph and put it on any
[1:14:06] international news and check by tomorrow
[1:14:08] morning is going to be
[1:14:11] labeled as the greatest disaster that is
[1:14:15] worse than
[1:14:17] Hamas and that is the how the
[1:14:20] strain the strain of the John Callin
[1:14:24] syndromes works it has a peculiar
[1:14:29] hit for the name of the ministry of
[1:14:31] William Bram let me illustrate it for
[1:14:33] you like this if to the John con
[1:14:37] syndrome you know why it's called John
[1:14:39] Collins
[1:14:42] syndrome now I don't want to take me
[1:14:44] back John Collins was the like the
[1:14:47] founder of that
[1:14:49] move he was the son I think the grandson
[1:14:53] is it the son of grandson sister it was
[1:14:55] the Grand brother uh Reverend Collins
[1:14:59] was the pastor of brand Tabernacle that
[1:15:02] he was a Deon where Brown was there and
[1:15:05] his
[1:15:06] son yeah was the one that had the polio
[1:15:09] very serious case that was almost there
[1:15:11] that was supernaturally healed during
[1:15:13] the preaching of the Seven Seals and
[1:15:15] then that his song had a son who is now
[1:15:18] John Colin who was with in the brand
[1:15:22] tacle for many years and over the years
[1:15:25] for some reason can't cope the teachings
[1:15:28] of the prophet of the Bible is not for
[1:15:32] everybody you need to carry the specious
[1:15:35] train and Gene of Abraham to be able to
[1:15:37] believe and follow this not everybody
[1:15:39] can cope with this thing it's not meant
[1:15:41] for
[1:15:43] all it's not meant for all it's the
[1:15:46] message of Moses was is that is why you
[1:15:49] will never check your Bible you are
[1:15:51] never going to find anywhere in the
[1:15:53] Bible that says and the Lord spoke unto
[1:15:55] Moses and say speak unto the
[1:15:58] world go and check it in your Bible and
[1:16:00] produces for me where and the Lord spoke
[1:16:03] unto Moses and say speak unto the people
[1:16:05] of the world where is it was Moses not a
[1:16:06] prophet of God to the Nations you never
[1:16:09] find it you will hear where the Bible
[1:16:11] say and the Lord spok un Moses speak
[1:16:13] unto who the children of Israel his
[1:16:16] message cannot be received by the world
[1:16:19] was not meant for them don't receive a
[1:16:22] message that was not meant for
[1:16:24] you stay with the one that's meant for
[1:16:27] you so Moses message was never meant for
[1:16:29] the world Paul's messy was never meant
[1:16:31] for the world no no no no no it was
[1:16:35] meant only for a specific people the
[1:16:38] elect of God that's what that's what for
[1:16:40] and that's exactly the way it is with
[1:16:42] brother it's the same thing he he he
[1:16:45] speaks to the elect it say he was a
[1:16:47] messenger of God to gather the elect and
[1:16:50] if you don't have enough Faith to become
[1:16:52] that you are one of them it's not really
[1:16:53] sent to you you don't have to be
[1:16:56] there you don't have to come there you
[1:16:58] don't have to be part of it it's not a
[1:17:01] problem the Believers of the message is
[1:17:04] a tiny super tiny
[1:17:07] minority to the so he started the move
[1:17:12] to reel out anything and everything
[1:17:16] against the person of brother just like
[1:17:18] some people have the move you know go go
[1:17:20] online to reel out any and everything
[1:17:24] against Jesus Christ they said Jesus
[1:17:26] Christ married Mary Magdalene they
[1:17:28] discover his grave he really did not
[1:17:30] this thing he really did not it's there
[1:17:32] all over the
[1:17:33] place yeah that does that make Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ to be forse he make nothing he
[1:17:38] don't mean
[1:17:40] nothing God does not as a matter of fact
[1:17:43] open a website to Define
[1:17:46] himself have you seen the website of
[1:17:48] God where you now query him what about
[1:17:51] these allegations they put against you
[1:17:53] he didn't do that because he has warned
[1:17:54] you there is only one way you are going
[1:17:56] to know things about me and that's our
[1:17:59] Mystic just because in
[1:18:02] America anything you need you just turn
[1:18:05] to your iPhone hi
[1:18:08] Siri hi
[1:18:11] Siri which turn am I going supposed to
[1:18:13] make at this point and Siri is going to

[1:18:20] Siri how can I get to heaven
[1:18:27] well you think you can also do because
[1:18:29] you are so used to Sir
[1:18:32] answering so many questions of natural
[1:18:36] life you also you've trusted it so much
[1:18:40] until you think you could also say hi
[1:18:43] Siri what can I do that I have eternal
[1:18:47] life what can I do that I may not
[1:18:51] die when you Google to find God and
[1:18:57] things about God you get
[1:19:01] opinions did you hear what I said you
[1:19:04] come up with what opinions opinions may
[1:19:07] I tell you the internet is a
[1:19:15] vorum everybody vomits
[1:19:19] anything there is a vomitorium did you
[1:19:22] understand Jesus Christ established the
[1:19:24] a search engine before leaving check
[1:19:27] your Bible he says search the
[1:19:33] scriptures are you looking for peace
[1:19:38] search are you looking for
[1:19:41] God do you want to have information
[1:19:44] about
[1:19:46] me whether I am true or I am false
[1:19:49] search the
[1:19:51] scriptures you
[1:19:54] cannot you cannot use something to
[1:19:57] search me that I live before that thing
[1:20:00] was invented it doesn't make
[1:20:04] sense may I say it again it doesn't make
[1:20:08] sense to look for a search engine that
[1:20:11] was
[1:20:12] invented after I had lived and
[1:20:15] died to now use that to find out about
[1:20:18] me and you rely on the information there
[1:20:20] as absolute truth that's nothing say
[1:20:24] that is unfair that's wickedness that's
[1:20:27] Injustice and I want to say the entire
[1:20:31] system is
[1:20:32] unjust against God against the truth
[1:20:35] against the message against the prophet
[1:20:38] that's
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:41] so
[1:20:43] I so when I wake up I said
[1:20:46] God I say ah this thing that has
[1:20:49] happened our cousins our the twins of
[1:20:53] our Revival they have a feast now this
[1:20:56] going to be a serious Feast for them oh
[1:20:59] my it's going to be a serious
[1:21:00] feast and that is the reason why have
[1:21:02] you noticed something I'm going to read
[1:21:03] the scripture now have you noticed
[1:21:06] something for so many
[1:21:09] people once they
[1:21:12] heard it's a big disaster that has
[1:21:14] happened to us because our ranks are
[1:21:17] been
[1:21:17] depleted we are losing
[1:21:21] soldiers and they basically not
[1:21:26] replenished we are losing a gener a
[1:21:29] precious
[1:21:30] generation that we haven't seen the
[1:21:34] youths that are in that
[1:21:36] mold to carry that fire I want you to
[1:21:40] ask yourself if in 50 years to come
[1:21:43] brother one is no longer here brother
[1:21:46] you no longer here What Becomes of this
[1:21:48] church
[1:21:50] right what happened
[1:21:53] is it all this was up is it all this was
[1:21:55] up
[1:21:56] guys and that man
[1:21:59] Jesus you know is it those kind of you
[1:22:02] want to carry the fire of this
[1:22:04] R the church will simply
[1:22:07] die look they're going to
[1:22:11] die when a
[1:22:14] system is losing its old and is not
[1:22:17] replenishing with his young right that
[1:22:21] system is nearing Extinction
[1:22:28] liation that's why I want to think so
[1:22:32] it's it's a big disaster that happen to
[1:22:33] but have you
[1:22:36] noticed whenever you go on a hunting on
[1:22:41] a Hunting Expedition to kill somebody to
[1:22:44] destroy somebody you lose love and you
[1:22:47] lose
[1:22:49] feeling the death of Billy Paul
[1:22:53] is treated like a saw dust as if it's a
[1:22:57] saw
[1:22:58] dust that has no
[1:23:00] feeling people are rather using it for
[1:23:04] debate there's no feeling I if to say
[1:23:07] it's a
[1:23:09] sest all you mostly what I hear oh he
[1:23:13] said this brother said this one is
[1:23:15] debate debate nobody thinks this brother
[1:23:18] has
[1:23:19] family he's got children he's a wife
[1:23:23] he's got loved ones there's no empathy
[1:23:26] how many of us when we heard he died
[1:23:28] bowed our
[1:23:29] head how many of us how many of us bowed
[1:23:33] our heads and said
[1:23:35] God thank you thank you for a while a
[1:23:39] life that was donated for the
[1:23:43] furance of this message we it
[1:23:47] saddened yes that is lost and there's
[1:23:51] nobody to replenish it
[1:23:54] how many of us take time to pray for the
[1:23:57] family it's all about
[1:24:00] debate on whether sharks are
[1:24:05] flowing are swimming in Los Angeles or
[1:24:09] not has covered the thing and that is
[1:24:13] Christians have lost feelings and when
[1:24:16] you lose feeling you have lost love when
[1:24:17] you lose love you lost God and with you
[1:24:20] lose God you have lost the direction to
[1:24:22] Heaven you got no part with god brother
[1:24:26] Bram say nothing will enter there except
[1:24:30] perfect love you can't have love without
[1:24:33] having
[1:24:37] feeling
[1:24:39] so let list our
[1:24:45] Force you know David in the Bible he
[1:24:49] lamented when Jonathan died he said
[1:24:53] David the Bible say David cried he wept
[1:24:56] and David said how are the mighty
[1:24:58] Fallen how are the mighty fallen and the
[1:25:01] weapons of war destroyed he said oh
[1:25:05] Jonathan you were a mighty man of war he
[1:25:08] said how are the mighty fallly he said
[1:25:10] tell it not in
[1:25:12] GTH publish it not in ascalon you know
[1:25:14] what is GTH GTH is the same lineage with
[1:25:18] Gaza they are all
[1:25:21] Philistines
[1:25:23] tell it not in gath publish it not in
[1:25:26] ascalon he said L the
[1:25:30] daughters of the world
[1:25:32] Rejoice the Bible say they will rejoice
[1:25:35] at the death of Jonathan why David was
[1:25:37] busy lamenting doing lamentation some
[1:25:40] busy I can imagine John cin believe this
[1:25:42] sign now they saying praise God didn't
[1:25:44] we say it we said it they were they are
[1:25:48] jumping yeah yeah prophecy has failed
[1:25:50] now we are proven to the world that will
[1:25:52] is forse and all kind of nonsense is
[1:25:55] going down and David said tell it not he
[1:25:58] said L the daughters of he not the
[1:26:01] daughter of Israel the Bible say he
[1:26:03] taught the daughters of Israel
[1:26:05] lamentation
[1:26:08] right lamentation is what we have our
[1:26:11] enemies are the one rejoicing in
[1:26:13] somebody's
[1:26:17] Calamity and taking somebody's failure
[1:26:20] to mean their success you don't need
[1:26:23] somebody to fail before you are
[1:26:27] promoted you are just being
[1:26:32] Wicked oh you know because you fail the
[1:26:34] exam you want somebody else to fail so
[1:26:36] that you be the you miss the question
[1:26:38] you want the other your friend to miss
[1:26:39] you so you'll be the first position you
[1:26:41] are
[1:26:42] wicked you are Godless if you have God
[1:26:46] you will wish your neighbor the best sir
[1:26:50] even in the face of your own failure
[1:26:53] that is Christianity and I tell you all
[1:26:55] of the
[1:26:57] soal believe this sign folks and Liv in
[1:27:00] the message have no feelings you cannot
[1:27:03] be a Christian and producing evil
[1:27:13] work if your belief is good your deed
[1:27:17] will be
[1:27:19] good yes sir it takes an evil
[1:27:23] belief to produce an evil
[1:27:27] wishes but
[1:27:30] L the enemies of the Cross
[1:27:33] Rejoice I want us to take up the subject
[1:27:36] we're not
[1:27:37] afraid he brother Bram told a lie and
[1:27:41] prophesy fely we want to say it that he
[1:27:42] prophesy
[1:27:45] fely did you hear
[1:27:48] me don't be
[1:27:50] scared we at home we're not afraid of
[1:27:53] facts we don't Dodge brother Bram said
[1:27:57] when you see a he didn't touch didn't
[1:28:00] teach us the principle of dodging
[1:28:02] facts and dodging
[1:28:05] truth if brother say when you see a man
[1:28:08] dodging scriptures Dodge that
[1:28:11] man Dodge that man is very dangerous so
[1:28:15] we want to
[1:28:16] take the subject I want to do this so
[1:28:20] that the faith of the Saints can be
[1:28:22] established I cannot brother Bram said
[1:28:25] study the problem of the people and
[1:28:27] begin your sment from there I cannot do
[1:28:29] justice to this message by going to
[1:28:32] teach some other things where there are
[1:28:34] fundamental
[1:28:36] questions that is afflicting the church
[1:28:39] and people are getting confused even
[1:28:41] though they don't talk how many churches
[1:28:43] are closed in the United States can you
[1:28:45] count
[1:28:46] them have you heard a Catholic Church
[1:28:49] Clos how many churches of Catholic you
[1:28:51] see they say he
[1:28:53] closed let's say brother Bram message
[1:28:55] was wrong is he as wrong as

[1:29:02] wrong as
[1:29:03] that but have you ever seen that the
[1:29:05] church cannot close we did the last how
[1:29:08] many years from the testimony you
[1:29:11] imagine big big name big churches in
[1:29:13] America close down denounce the message
[1:29:16] what theyve lived for for years
[1:29:19] denounced it call the prophet on
[1:29:22] printable names and all of that and they
[1:29:24] they lost their faith and so many of us
[1:29:27] that are not talking is working
[1:29:29] underneath our
[1:29:30] mind you got
[1:29:32] doubts you've heard things you got
[1:29:36] doubts you got fears you're just
[1:29:38] trudging alone you can't move like
[1:29:40] that let us lay the fact down I just

[1:29:48] I'll do the I'll do the bit again anyway
[1:29:51] I leave it it's fine but it's not a
[1:29:54] thing that I must let the background of
[1:29:55] it for you to be able to go so that is
[1:29:57] why I want to talk to
[1:29:59] you I'm not just really preaching this

[1:30:14] to have a talk this morning I want to
[1:30:16] address your
[1:30:17] faith because the faith of so many are
[1:30:21] shaken
[1:30:25] shaking I want us to address these
[1:30:29] issues I want to find out let us lay the
[1:30:32] facts
[1:30:33] down what is the truth of this matter is
[1:30:37] it what is this message worth believing
[1:30:40] or we're just deceiving ourselves let's
[1:30:43] be honest with ourselves we ain't got
[1:30:45] too long to stay around here we cannot I
[1:30:48] can't be telling myself lies I'm I'm
[1:30:50] going to 53
[1:30:54] how many days have I got to live on here
[1:30:56] for me to not be fellowshipping on
[1:30:59] lies that will not take me anywhere I I
[1:31:02] got to tell myself truths my candle is
[1:31:04] more than half
[1:31:08] burned so want to take these
[1:31:11] things I want to give it talk to you and
[1:31:14] I want to just simply title it now that
[1:31:17] our brother our precious brother Billy
[1:31:20] Paul the son of brother Abraham is
[1:31:24] gone as a matter of fact Joseph has very
[1:31:26] little memory he was just 10 the real
[1:31:30] person that has all the
[1:31:32] facts was
[1:31:34] Billy he one among some of the last
[1:31:37] soldiers and he has laid down his armor
[1:31:40] and he's gone to rest now that our
[1:31:43] precious brother Billy Paul is dead
[1:31:44] that's my that's what I want talk
[1:31:47] about what what about the prophecy of
[1:31:51] the sharks
[1:31:56] swimming in front of May Company in Los
[1:31:59] Angeles and what about the California
[1:32:02] earthquake prophecy a lot of ministers
[1:32:05] have preached these things approached it
[1:32:08] and it has destroyed the faith of people
[1:32:10] I just want us to let us pick the things
[1:32:13] separate the we from the chaff and then
[1:32:16] you can draw your own
[1:32:17] conclusion God bless you let's stand
[1:32:34] precious
[1:32:37] father I know this is if you don't help
[1:32:41] me
[1:32:43] Lord know where I'm standing
[1:32:47] Lord I won't be able to get it through
[1:32:49] Lord and yet it's burning in my heart
[1:32:53] for the people got to know the truth of
[1:32:55] this matter I need your help Lord to be
[1:32:58] able to condense these things and yet
[1:33:00] leave nothing out that will be helpful
[1:33:02] to their people because your your Bible
[1:33:04] said have not shown to declare unto you
[1:33:06] the whole councel of God please help me
[1:33:09] and help this
[1:33:11] church our aim is to help to strengthen
[1:33:15] the faith of the people confirm it Grant
[1:33:18] it Lord in Jesus name we
[1:33:20] pray amen God bless you let's turn to
[1:33:22] the Book of Luke
[1:33:25] Chapter Luke
[1:33:28] chapter 1 I'm going to read from verses
[1:33:31] 1 to 6 Luke chap 1 veres 1 to 6 and then
[1:33:36] I'll take another reading from the book
[1:33:38] of Acts
[1:33:40] chapter I'll take another reading from
[1:33:42] the book of act chapter 15 all right I
[1:33:45] want us to listen to the reading of the
[1:33:46] word for as
[1:33:50] much I wish I got time to give you the
[1:33:52] background of this man Luke The
[1:33:54] Physician that wrote this book Luke this
[1:33:57] is the out of the four gospels two were
[1:34:00] written by direct Disciples of Jesus
[1:34:04] that were one of the 12 the other two
[1:34:06] Mark and Luke is the second book that is
[1:34:09] written that people that were not
[1:34:11] actually part of the original 12 but
[1:34:14] they were part of the larger group of
[1:34:16] disciples but not of the
[1:34:18] 12 they were part of this other 120 that
[1:34:22] was in the upper room now listen for as
[1:34:25] much as many I want to give this as a
[1:34:29] basis for my subject for as much as many
[1:34:32] have taken in
[1:34:34] hand to set forth in
[1:34:38] order a
[1:34:39] declaration of those things which are
[1:34:42] surely believed Among Us brother things
[1:34:47] that are what surely believed and among
[1:34:51] not just believed surely
[1:34:54] believed not among the
[1:34:58] world Among Us it's not everybody verse
[1:35:03] two even as they delivered them unto us
[1:35:07] which from the beginning I want you to
[1:35:09] notice the kind of people that wrote
[1:35:10] this thing eye
[1:35:13] witnesses God does not rely on we can't
[1:35:16] rely on testimony of people that went
[1:35:20] online yeah they head from them that
[1:35:23] head from the that
[1:35:26] head under the law they unfit to be
[1:35:29] listened
[1:35:31] to you got to give testimony of a true
[1:35:35] witness were you there did you see
[1:35:38] it so I want to see how God God was so
[1:35:42] mindful of his word and the kind of
[1:35:45] people he allowed to pend down these
[1:35:47] things so that there will be no
[1:35:50] doubt because we can serve God you can
[1:35:53] serve god with doubts in your heart he
[1:35:55] can
[1:35:56] work the little B of doubt that is in
[1:36:00] your heart will eventually lead you out
[1:36:02] like a LED lost
[1:36:04] wife even as they delivered them unto us
[1:36:07] which from the beginning were I
[1:36:10] Witnesses and then what Ministers of the
[1:36:14] word to be a minister of the world it
[1:36:16] going to be what eyewitness now we got
[1:36:19] ministers that are not eyewitnesses what
[1:36:21] are they going to
[1:36:23] minister listen so because Luke was not
[1:36:29] of the actual 12 disciples he has to
[1:36:32] write it there because God wanted to let
[1:36:34] it see even apart from the 12 disciples
[1:36:36] there were still
[1:36:38] others who saw and knew and testify so
[1:36:44] he said it seemed good to me also
[1:36:47] Luke oh I love this having what had
[1:36:52] what
[1:36:53] perfect understanding now if you check
[1:36:57] the Greek word translated understanding
[1:37:00] here is not our English
[1:37:02] word the Greek word translated
[1:37:04] understanding here comes from the word
[1:37:08] to follow closely and be present when
[1:37:12] something
[1:37:13] happened maybe let me illustrate it like
[1:37:16] this so that you understand why I use
[1:37:17] the word
[1:37:18] understanding a lot of people are
[1:37:20] passing this people place this road
[1:37:22] there's a road directly here they know
[1:37:25] this church but they don't understand
[1:37:26] this
[1:37:27] church they know
[1:37:30] it to understand it you have to come
[1:37:32] under
[1:37:35] it that is where you get the word
[1:37:37] understand from under stand under and
[1:37:43] know that's right that's why you get the
[1:37:46] word understanding they know the chur
[1:37:48] they don't understand it to understand
[1:37:51] you going to be under it be part of it
[1:37:55] feel it see it then you can tell truth
[1:37:58] about it what is the guy that is passing
[1:38:00] here every morning to walk what's he
[1:38:01] going to say about this church he's
[1:38:02] going to say they are just just group
[1:38:04] group of Hermits they don't talk to
[1:38:06] nobody they just alone to themselves
[1:38:09] they don't just a cake people you know
[1:38:12] they don't earring they should be Mark
[1:38:14] they look like CST and they look yeah
[1:38:18] that's what going say he he knows the
[1:38:19] place but he doesn't understand it and
[1:38:22] so what he's going to be saying is
[1:38:24] nonsense and once you can pour it on the
[1:38:27] internet people will be reading it and
[1:38:30] conclusion so Paul sorry Luke says it
[1:38:34] seems good to me as is prepared by God
[1:38:38] it seems Godly to me good is God having
[1:38:41] had what perfect understanding of what
[1:38:46] all it is not
[1:38:49] partial all all things from where from
[1:38:53] the very first from the very first the
[1:38:56] word translated from the very first is
[1:38:58] deeper than the word from the time it
[1:39:00] started no no no no no no no it means
[1:39:02] from the first
[1:39:04] CA from
[1:39:06] Source from above go and check
[1:39:09] it go check it when you get home now to
[1:39:13] write onto
[1:39:16] D in
[1:39:18] order most excellent theophilos if you
[1:39:21] go to verse one of the book of act
[1:39:23] you're going to see this same name there
[1:39:26] theophilos nobody actually know who that
[1:39:28] guy is history does not nobody no
[1:39:32] history I've read a lot trying to find
[1:39:34] out history does not know who that guy
[1:39:36] is but suffices to know you know what
[1:39:39] that means theophilos means Theo is come
[1:39:43] from the word God phos love it is those
[1:39:46] the person who God
[1:39:49] loves oh God I don't know whether you
[1:39:51] getting my point nobody know what got
[1:39:53] but it is to write onto the most
[1:39:55] excellent Theos most excellent the
[1:39:59] brothers and sisters whom God
[1:40:03] love didn't that's is he wrote it to us
[1:40:06] whom God
[1:40:08] loves that doubt why God does not live
[1:40:13] in doubts that is what the songwriter

[1:41:14] God Ser is that we may know the
[1:41:19] certainty of those things that has been
[1:41:22] told to
[1:41:23] us and
[1:41:25] now I want to stop here while you got to
[1:41:28] see there was listen now there was in
[1:41:32] the days of Herod have you noticed how
[1:41:34] it started there was not I was
[1:41:38] told I read I
[1:41:41] Googled right there was I was there
[1:41:46] there was in the days of Judea are
[1:41:49] certain not some a certain certain it's
[1:41:51] not an
[1:41:54] uncertain a certain priest named
[1:41:58] Zacharias of the ca of her and his wife
[1:42:00] was of the daughters of Aaron and her
[1:42:01] name was Elizabeth God bless you that
[1:42:04] thank you

[1:42:13] get this thank you all right thank you
[1:42:15] God bless you you know we just need to
[1:42:17] get these things have you noticed this
[1:42:22] then let's turn to the book
[1:42:23] of act chapter 15 let's start from verse
[1:42:26] one let's see the contrast let's see the
[1:42:29] contrast to this this brother said he
[1:42:33] seemed good to me he seemed good to me
[1:42:36] the Lord placed it in me because good is
[1:42:38] God to write unto you you may know the
[1:42:42] certainty let's go to act 15 verse1
[1:42:45] listen close to
[1:42:46] this
[1:42:48] and there were set came
[1:42:52] men which came down from Judea look look
[1:42:57] at they come from BR tacle Judea was
[1:43:00] where Jesus came
[1:43:01] from Juda Judea was where Jesus
[1:43:05] basically did this his last face of his
[1:43:11] ministry the tpol was in
[1:43:15] Judea and there were certain men who
[1:43:18] came from Brown
[1:43:19] Tabernacle who came from Judea and
[1:43:23] taught the Brethren they started what
[1:43:25] have you noticed it's a teaching they
[1:43:27] established a teaching system okay they
[1:43:31] had churches where they teaching they
[1:43:33] were dishing out these things and taught
[1:43:36] the pren they were trying to teach the
[1:43:38] church and said
[1:43:42] except ye be circumcised after the
[1:43:46] manner of Moses you cannot be saved
[1:43:48] meanwhile salvation is alone is in
[1:43:50] Christ right in other word they are
[1:43:52] overthrowing the faith of people they
[1:43:55] make Jesus
[1:43:57] unnecessary and they are returning the
[1:43:59] people back to the very thing Jesus in
[1:44:01] fact they cancel the work of redemption
[1:44:03] they destroy
[1:44:05] C it's a simple this teaching was very
[1:44:08] simple but the effect is to cancel the
[1:44:11] entire bed life
[1:44:15] work death burier resurrection and
[1:44:18] future Promises of Jesus is to CR CR it
[1:44:21] out that was the effect of that
[1:44:26] teaching now that's
[1:44:28] serious and when therefore Paul and
[1:44:31] Barnabas had no small dissension and
[1:44:34] disputation with them have you noticed
[1:44:37] this Paul and Barnabas did what cont
[1:44:40] this is why some people say why are you
[1:44:41] talking like this we have to
[1:44:43] contend with them Paul and Barnabas are
[1:44:47] Ministers of Christ they cannot sit down
[1:44:50] and pretended as if nothing is happening
[1:44:52] I don't want no problem just believe
[1:44:54] anyhow they didn't tell the church to
[1:44:55] believe anyhow let me tell you this you
[1:44:58] can begin your Christian journey by
[1:45:00] believing anyhow you will not go through
[1:45:01] it by believing anyhow you got to know
[1:45:04] to believe anyhow we no
[1:45:08] work it's not enough anyhow I believe
[1:45:11] anyhow cannot Rapture
[1:45:13] you it's enough to take you out of
[1:45:16] Egypt but he will never take you to the
[1:45:18] promised land we got to know the
[1:45:22] certainty of the things whereof we've
[1:45:25] been
[1:45:26] instructed and when Paul and B that's
[1:45:29] why you expect us you expect our Our
[1:45:32] Generation people like CRA one stand
[1:45:34] against it we can't fold our arms and
[1:45:38] behave as if there's nothing going on as
[1:45:40] if the people are healthy our churches
[1:45:42] are not healthy people are in doubt
[1:45:44] people are in
[1:45:46] fears people are
[1:45:48] uncertain they will be
[1:45:51] backsliding our churches will become
[1:45:53] empty as the year goes by if we don't
[1:45:57] stand like
[1:46:00] Paul when Paul therefore Paul and
[1:46:02] Barnabas had no small dissension and
[1:46:04] disputation with them can you see no
[1:46:06] small dissension and disputation with
[1:46:09] them they determined that Paul and
[1:46:11] Barnabas and certain other them should
[1:46:13] go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and
[1:46:15] to the and Elders about this
[1:46:17] question right and when therefore sorry
[1:46:20] move on move move move please and being
[1:46:22] brought on their way by the church they
[1:46:24] passed through finess and Samaria
[1:46:26] declaring the conversion of the Gentiles
[1:46:28] and cause great joy unto the all the
[1:46:30] Breen they were going to Jerusalem let's
[1:46:32] go all right four I'm going to seven and
[1:46:34] when they were come to Jerusalem they
[1:46:35] were received of the Church of the of
[1:46:37] the Apostles and elders and they declare
[1:46:38] all the things that God had done with
[1:46:40] them okay go and there are listen this
[1:46:42] is where I'm going
[1:46:44] okay but they they declare what God had
[1:46:47] done and they said but there are
[1:46:51] certain of the sect of the Pharisees
[1:46:53] those guys were actually
[1:46:55] Pharisees who did not belong to the
[1:46:59] message but were moved into the message
[1:47:03] by the enemy to do a
[1:47:07] curse they were
[1:47:11] Jesuits they never really were
[1:47:15] converts they never
[1:47:17] believed they never belonged there
[1:47:20] can you notice this brother among the
[1:47:22] disciples this is the first early Church
[1:47:24] of Jesus
[1:47:25] Christ this do you let me let me do you
[1:47:29] notice that Paul himself was a
[1:47:31] Pharisee Peter was a Pharisee why didn't
[1:47:34] the Bible say and Paul a
[1:47:37] Pharisee the real strain and gen of Paul
[1:47:41] was not Pharisee he but this guy were
[1:47:45] original say Judas real church was the
[1:47:49] Pharisees
[1:47:51] he only moved to the message of the hour
[1:47:54] for crucifixion of the
[1:47:57] message let me tell you
[1:48:00] something no
[1:48:02] Revival has ever died as a result of
[1:48:06] persecution from
[1:48:08] outside persecution from outside only
[1:48:10] strengthen it every Revival has been
[1:48:14] killed by the children that raised in
[1:48:18] that Revival a generation that raised
[1:48:21] there and KN not the Lord that's right
[1:48:23] that's
[1:48:24] right because when they have stayed just
[1:48:27] imagine me I came to this message when I
[1:48:31] was
[1:48:33] 16 when I was
[1:48:36] 16 I've lived practically all my life
[1:48:39] inside here I've been preaching this
[1:48:41] message possibly since I
[1:48:43] 18 I'm 53
[1:48:45] now almost by November just imagine I
[1:48:49] putting about 40 years I've traveled
[1:48:52] length and wise defending it and I
[1:48:54] suddenly turn around and say you know
[1:48:58] what if anybody supposed to know this
[1:49:01] thing I'm supposed to be the one you
[1:49:03] know what I found out I knew all along
[1:49:05] this guy is false he the devil what do
[1:49:08] you think happens to the my
[1:49:10] church what do you think happen to the
[1:49:12] people following me what do you think
[1:49:14] happened to the world they will say you
[1:49:16] know what you know how the word judges
[1:49:17] cases it's an unjust world they would
[1:49:20] say if it's an
[1:49:21] enemy outside then we could say maybe
[1:49:24] it's a maybe it's not true but if this
[1:49:28] person who is an
[1:49:30] Insider can say these kind things
[1:49:34] therefore means it must be true that is
[1:49:36] how the world judge if you judge it like
[1:49:39] that unnown that it is the kingdom of
[1:49:42] God that
[1:49:43] suffers elect do not plant spice among
[1:49:47] non-elect amen it is we that the Bible
[1:49:50] said the enemy came to spy our
[1:49:54] Liberty it is we that
[1:49:58] suffers M wheat does not grow get shot
[1:50:02] among test it is test that come among
[1:50:05] wheat to distur and to distort it so
[1:50:09] these guys really were never par of it
[1:50:14] one of my very close
[1:50:16] friends who has in South Africa who has
[1:50:19] invited me as a matter of fact have been
[1:50:21] their Church they have put beautiful big
[1:50:23] big revivals special meetings wonderful
[1:50:27] meetings BR one has been there I have
[1:50:29] been there very close he has spent and
[1:50:32] has been spent for this
[1:50:35] message he has actually invited me to
[1:50:38] this 40th year
[1:50:40] anniversary of the ministry of Malachi 4
[1:50:44] in his life and 60 years next coming
[1:50:47] year I Was preparing to go he just came
[1:50:49] now
[1:50:50] he has caught John cin
[1:50:54] syndrome and
[1:50:56] he that he denounced brother he
[1:50:59] denounced the message and callaham on
[1:51:02] printable
[1:51:05] names for me to repeat some things he
[1:51:07] said will amount almost to
[1:51:10] blasphemy what do you think people
[1:51:12] people people said all of his followers
[1:51:14] how many many churches are
[1:51:18] gone so we we we we we need to purse and
[1:51:22] find out
[1:51:23] so this I want you to understand the
[1:51:26] Affliction that is bef falling us this
[1:51:29] we are the elect we are the one that
[1:51:31] have weeds among
[1:51:33] us to SP now the Bible say these people
[1:51:36] were originally who
[1:51:40] Pharisees who came in among us to Lear
[1:51:44] away until they mature enough to now let
[1:51:47] me tell you this explosions don't don't
[1:51:50] fully destroy something is
[1:51:53] implosion when something
[1:51:55] implodes from inside he has no chance of
[1:51:59] Survivor he can hit it by an explosion
[1:52:01] he can survive and this is why the devil
[1:52:04] seem to want to implode it but let me
[1:52:06] tell you this no matter what the devil
[1:52:11] does whether he likes it or not you
[1:52:14] can't kill this
[1:52:16] message look look even if me even if me
[1:52:22] brother decide now to start curing it it
[1:52:25] will only use me as a stepping stone and
[1:52:29] continue it is
[1:52:32] indestructible because it is godall we
[1:52:35] want to find out so sir so I want to I
[1:52:39] want to quickly call your
[1:52:41] attention to this you know so many of
[1:52:45] our
[1:52:47] Brethren they try to be
[1:52:50] diplomatic with this case and you know I
[1:52:54] I listened to one of the ministers
[1:52:55] somebody somebody was quoting one of the
[1:52:57] ministers in my country yesterday to me
[1:52:59] he said you know what me I just believe
[1:53:02] the message me I don't go and be
[1:53:05] studying prophecy and I don't go I just
[1:53:07] believe even if brother bram's prophecy
[1:53:11] concerning Los Ang or concerning
[1:53:14] swimming even if you fail may I still
[1:53:17] believe that sounds ni
[1:53:20] ni and I know a lot of people say yeah
[1:53:24] it's
[1:53:26] nonsense I will prove it to you in the
[1:53:28] light of the message of is this
[1:53:30] complimentary to God Hand the message
[1:53:34] what are you talking you think you think
[1:53:36] God
[1:53:37] allows you think God is
[1:53:43] helped by
[1:53:45] life listen oh yeah you know what even
[1:53:49] though he's prophecy
[1:53:51] fails me I still believe I believe
[1:53:53] anyhow you are
[1:53:55] lying let me tell you
[1:53:58] this when I have problem in my
[1:54:02] country I don't bother to die
[1:54:05] 999 if you guys have problem here
[1:54:08] emergency I think is
[1:54:10] 999 H 911
[1:54:12] sorry sorry all right when you guys have
[1:54:16] emergency here you have some hijackers
[1:54:19] or somebody with
[1:54:21] armed or you emergency Health crisis you
[1:54:24] die
[1:54:26] 911 I don't bother to die it in my
[1:54:29] country you know why nobody will
[1:54:33] come it doesn't
[1:54:36] work you know why you call it here you
[1:54:39] know why you call it here it
[1:54:42] works you can't trust a system that does
[1:54:46] not work human beings are not design to
[1:54:50] believe in something that is
[1:54:54] failing you you
[1:54:57] can't if this Prophecy of the message is
[1:55:00] failing and failed just one of
[1:55:04] it brother Bram said if
[1:55:08] one that is if one of this thing fail he
[1:55:13] say it's all a failure in God's economy
[1:55:17] 99.99 accuracy does not work right
[1:55:20] because that little percentage there
[1:55:23] will introduce
[1:55:25] fear and it will make it you can't trust
[1:55:29] something that has possibility of
[1:55:30] failing and then you rest your soul on
[1:55:33] it it's not possible so you can't tell
[1:55:35] me when you say even if the message of
[1:55:38] yah fails I still believe what where you
[1:55:40] get
[1:55:42] Faith where you get it you think faith
[1:55:45] can rest anywhere faith can only rest on
[1:55:48] something that is failing proof yes sir
[1:55:52] am so it is a defe attitude it's a lie
[1:55:56] of the devil it is part of Satan's
[1:55:58] program to claim that even if he fails I
[1:56:01] still believe it you are being dis
[1:56:04] complimentary to the message you are
[1:56:06] disgracing to the message you are
[1:56:07] disgracing the message and as a matter
[1:56:09] of fact you are working for the
[1:56:11] enemy you are part of our
[1:56:14] enemy I am telling you if there prophecy
[1:56:18] or anyone failed the entire thing is a
[1:56:21] failure let's close
[1:56:25] it so I want us to examine the facts I'm
[1:56:29] sorry I can give you all the quotes

[2:04:25] ever mention I said directly or
[2:04:29] indirectly that did he ever mention

[2:04:50] not
[2:04:51] nowhere now let me let's get the record
[2:04:55] clear if anybody could speak on the
[2:04:58] message I say I have I not only read
[2:05:01] most of the messages F by reading I
[2:05:04] listenting to
[2:05:05] them many of the people talking and
[2:05:08] listening to a
[2:05:10] cter they follow
[2:05:12] nothing I've devoted my life to this
[2:05:15] thing the book of my life I gave my Life
[2:05:18] as a
[2:05:20] youth to this
[2:05:22] thing and I'm ready to die with
[2:05:25] it I've told
[2:05:28] God lock the key of my soul with the
[2:05:31] message of William Bram and throw it
[2:05:32] away I don't want to find
[2:05:35] it my case is done gone finished it's my
[2:05:40] choice you can make
[2:05:45] yours listen listen I want to make it
[2:05:50] let us get the record clear not any way
[2:05:54] did did directly or indirectly it's only
[2:05:56] Common Sense Listen Now it only stands
[2:05:59] to
[2:06:00] reason it was only simple application of
[2:06:02] common sense that we Breen do that if
[2:06:07] now there's no doubt about it when I'm
[2:06:09] coming to read it that he prophesied in
[2:06:12] 1965 said God told me and of course if
[2:06:16] it doesn't come to pass it's a first
[2:06:17] Propet absolutely he said God told
[2:06:21] me
[2:06:22] California will go under the ocean
[2:06:25] before the coming of the
[2:06:27] Lord the hole will go he say God told me
[2:06:31] may I make it clear there's nothing
[2:06:33] mentioned of shars go back and listen or
[2:06:36] anything it's only common sense that we
[2:06:39] people used that if sharks are in the
[2:06:46] ocean and the oan
[2:06:49] floods the place it naturally
[2:06:53] me sharks will be swimming there it's
[2:06:55] only common sense they were not words of
[2:06:58] brother
[2:06:59] Abraham don't use what he doing God
[2:07:02] don't use frivolous statements he
[2:07:06] precise
[2:07:10] now I am not by this please I want I
[2:07:13] want to be I want to I'm sure I'm on
[2:07:15] record I want to be put right straight
[2:07:18] on record you know what because there my
[2:07:19] friend in South
[2:07:21] Africa you know he through a challenge

[2:07:59] terrorist simple Christians that are
[2:08:02] living I'm turning hoodlums and wicked
[2:08:06] people to to become good

[2:08:11] same roow with heras and
[2:08:14] esbah and Al
[2:08:17] shabab is not
[2:08:20] wickedness KN that once you report such
[2:08:23] to government you are actually assumed
[2:08:26] guilty
[2:08:27] first until you prove yourself otherwise
[2:08:30] you are not deemed to be innocent you
[2:08:33] are deemed to be
[2:08:35] guilty

[2:12:57] brother Billy Paul
[2:13:02] said in
[2:13:04] 1965 in 1965 April
[2:13:07] 29 when brother Bram Bram in company of
[2:13:10] so many Ministers of the Full Gospel
[2:13:12] businessman La William deosaran and so
[2:13:15] many people they were having some
[2:13:16] special meeting in California Los
[2:13:18] Angeles and brother Brenan was to
[2:13:19] deliver his sermon that evening he was
[2:13:22] to deliver the message he was to be the
[2:13:24] one to preach in the evening in the
[2:13:25] morning was another preacher that was
[2:13:26] preaching he was on the platform sitting
[2:13:28] down and prior to that sister uh
[2:13:31] Florence
[2:13:33] sharan had had a cancer case and was
[2:13:37] almost dead when and brother Brown was a
[2:13:41] personal friend of the sharian and they
[2:13:43] contacted bra prayed for her and told
[2:13:46] them told bra demons that she she won't
[2:13:48] die she's going to survive this
[2:13:51] particular Illness but she will not live
[2:13:53] that was a private stuff now it's not on
[2:13:55] tape now it's all reported many years
[2:13:59] ago written down in
[2:14:02] book all right that sister Florence will
[2:14:07] not live to see the coming of the Lord
[2:14:08] but she's not going to die for that
[2:14:10] she's going to take survive that and
[2:14:11] sister Florence survived that cancer
[2:14:14] attack and came to that meeting and in
[2:14:18] the morning meeting of that day of April
[2:14:20] 29 1965 sister Florence sang a very
[2:14:26] inspiring special in that meeting bra
[2:14:29] was sitting on the platform and when
[2:14:32] when when she left H the record it's on
[2:14:35] record says that bra brah
[2:14:39] nudged brother car Williams that was
[2:14:41] sitting with him I said can't you see
[2:14:43] how she's going and he said where he say
[2:14:45] toward the case of Heaven that was a
[2:14:48] private
[2:14:49] conversation and immediately after the
[2:14:53] sister a
[2:14:55] thunderous speaking in tongues came from
[2:14:59] the
[2:15:00] audience and the pro and gave a message
[2:15:03] in his tongues and immediately there
[2:15:05] followed an interpretation which said
[2:15:08] Daughters of Zion and he was so vivid
[2:15:11] Daughter of Zion that was talking about
[2:15:12] sister f sharan That Be not Afraid thou
[2:15:16] shall leave to see the coming of the
[2:15:19] Lord directly
[2:15:22] contradictory BR Bram did not even move
[2:15:25] but bil Paul was in that meeting I'm
[2:15:28] giving you the background to the story
[2:15:31] so we know the truth there is only one
[2:15:33] way you can defeat the enemy is to know
[2:15:35] the truth it's not just to say anyhow
[2:15:37] anyhow I believe what is the meaning of
[2:15:38] anyhow don't believe God anyhow you
[2:15:41] believe God by
[2:15:43] truth all right then after that meeting
[2:15:48] bilip Paul was very disturbed it was in
[2:15:50] the evening of that day that brother
[2:15:51] Bram preached the message choosing of ab
[2:15:55] Bri where the prophecy of Los Angeles
[2:15:58] now came out now so Billy Paul and
[2:16:01] brother BR were walking on the street
[2:16:03] were together and Billy was so could see
[2:16:07] that Billy was so agitated so Disturbed
[2:16:09] and brother Bram was said is all
[2:16:11] documented to have asked him Billy
[2:16:13] what's what's the
[2:16:14] problem Billy Paul said no nothing Daddy
[2:16:17] and they were going and he called Billy
[2:16:20] what's what's the matter with you he
[2:16:22] said Daddy you had didn't you hear that
[2:16:27] prophecy but you had prophec you have
[2:16:30] said this is also all of them out of not
[2:16:34] on tape you've also
[2:16:36] told Brother demon sharian that this
[2:16:39] sister will not live to the coming of
[2:16:40] the Lord but the prophecy said she's
[2:16:42] going to live to the coming of the
[2:16:44] Lord and B said brother Bram told him
[2:16:48] Billy all I can tell you is that the
[2:16:50] angel has not told me anything
[2:16:55] different it was in the evening of that
[2:16:58] day that the prophet now I want you to
[2:17:01] notice they are the two are not
[2:17:02] connected that is February sorry April
[2:17:05] 29 oh God I just pray
[2:17:09] God I hope you're not tired please
[2:17:12] please just pardon me I I will not be
[2:17:13] here I I I I will go I I will not be
[2:17:15] here please pleas just pardon me I we
[2:17:17] need to I need to put I can leave I can
[2:17:20] I can drop it it's not it's not a
[2:17:21] problem to me I can leave it but I just
[2:17:23] want you to know so that your faith can
[2:17:27] stand
[2:17:29] unshakeable and it's only truth alone
[2:17:31] not foolish
[2:17:34] belief listen it was that day that was
[2:17:38] on April 29 that was the evening of that
[2:17:42] day it has nothing to do with sharks now
[2:17:45] that the prophet gave thus said the Lord
[2:17:47] thou C that called by name of the Angel
[2:17:49] you will go under the ocean and say
[2:17:51] Market is th say the Lord is finished
[2:17:53] going to happen it was that evening in
[2:17:59] iay now fast forward to
[2:18:05] September of that
[2:18:08] Year brother Brown was again in Los
[2:18:11] Angeles his last
[2:18:13] series of ever been in Los Angeles
[2:18:16] before the Lord called him home he was
[2:18:17] again there for another set of meetings
[2:18:20] that was the day he preached power of
[2:18:21] transformation you can check
[2:18:23] it in U September 9th sorry September 11
[2:18:31] 1965 they were together brother
[2:18:34] Bram the day he preached after preaching
[2:18:37] power of transformation in the morning
[2:18:39] afternoon they were together with bilip
[2:18:41] Paul on the streets of Los Los
[2:18:44] Angeles and then they got the news
[2:18:48] that sister Flores
[2:18:50] sharan whom the prophet spoke about has
[2:18:53] just passed
[2:18:55] on to be with the Lord then the prophet
[2:18:57] say hold on they should call back and
[2:18:59] check what time because the angel told
[2:19:02] him it's going to be between 2 and
[2:19:06] 3 what time and they phoned back and
[2:19:09] said 3:45 a.m. sorry 2:45 a.m. so that
[2:19:15] was just so he and Billy were was that
[2:19:18] not what the Lord
[2:19:19] said can't
[2:19:23] feel listen and while in that
[2:19:27] conversation was where B remember the
[2:19:30] prophec of had happened
[2:19:34] April nothing like sharks or anything
[2:19:37] then they were together that afternoon
[2:19:41] in September these things are if you go
[2:19:44] to Pages go to pages one 109 to 119 109
[2:19:50] to 119 of Act of the Prophet written
[2:19:54] there it was not written after B Paul
[2:19:56] died they couldn't have published a book
[2:19:58] after all perig died so how could have
[2:20:01] written a book he was written many many
[2:20:03] years ago all these things were
[2:20:05] documented so we are not defending
[2:20:07] anything and may I pause to tell you
[2:20:10] this somebody said defend brother Bram
[2:20:13] may I make something clear to
[2:20:15] you can you defend
[2:20:20] defense can you guide can you guard
[2:20:24] God I know g u r a d God can you guard
[2:20:36] God can you protect
[2:20:40] protection can you protect
[2:20:42] protection you can't may I make it very
[2:20:45] clear there is nothing like the
[2:20:47] defending brother Bram brother needs no
[2:20:50] defense truth cannot be defended truth
[2:20:54] defends
[2:20:56] itself anything you defend is a
[2:21:01] lie that was why you notice this have
[2:21:04] you noticed when Jesus Christ Jesus
[2:21:06] Christ say I am the way I am the truth I
[2:21:08] am the life have you noticed that when
[2:21:10] the Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:21:11] arranged no defense
[2:21:15] came ordinarily when you to be charged
[2:21:17] for treason as he was charged and killed
[2:21:21] they asked for
[2:21:22] defense the Jewish law required defense
[2:21:25] have you noticed nobody came Jesus
[2:21:28] nobody could stand to defend him because
[2:21:30] he was
[2:21:32] truth you can't defend truth right truth
[2:21:36] defends
[2:21:38] itself that's right he is truth he
[2:21:41] defends you know so the say my message
[2:21:45] is perishable and is not through it will
[2:21:48] perish and I will perish with it if it
[2:21:51] is the truth he said you people watch it
[2:21:53] it will be exactly that way he won't F
[2:21:57] he will stand out after all the critics
[2:22:01] are dead and gone he will live right
[2:22:04] on he will March right on right on right
[2:22:08] on nobody a't going even if this church
[2:22:10] decid that we're not going to believe
[2:22:13] you don't look let me tell you this
[2:22:14] Heaven is not aware that you
[2:22:16] around
[2:22:18] yeah it's American government that make
[2:22:20] you
[2:22:20] important and you feel you know you know
[2:22:23] you feel big you know you know I've
[2:22:26] noticed when people in advanced country

[2:27:09] longer or or are change beyond
[2:27:11] recognition a few of them are still with
[2:27:13] us and provide an interesting connection
[2:27:15] to North Americans rich past the others
[2:27:18] are presented so that they can probably
[2:27:20] be remembered as a tangible part of our
[2:27:22] life to their customers so this is where
[2:27:24] we went to this is why the brothers went
[2:27:26] to check all these things and then they
[2:27:28] had a chat room for all the people
[2:27:31] different different question and
[2:27:33] memories of former staff people that are

[2:27:39] hold I just want to see that we have not
[2:27:42] follow conly devised
[2:27:45] Fables

[2:27:54] hide we are not I was telling the Breen
[2:27:58] if the American government know who I am

[2:28:33] me through stress for
[2:28:35] nothing I am not of them that get Visa
[2:28:38] and have
[2:28:40] scorned no sir no
[2:28:45] sir so is we are we as true men we are

[2:29:10] he said I'm coming back to it he say
[2:29:13] sharks he told him we in front of and
[2:29:17] can see that that big is not even there
[2:29:19] any
[2:29:21] longer you won't be an old
[2:29:25] man and may I make it very
[2:29:28] clear brother Bram said
[2:29:32] from
[2:29:34] 25 your youthful days are
[2:29:39] over and say from
[2:29:42] 45 you're an old man direct
[2:29:45] statements I can read it for
[2:29:48] you Billy died at
[2:29:52] 88 as a matter of fact at the time he
[2:29:54] was giving those testimonies he was
[2:29:55] already an old man yes sir so how do you
[2:29:58] balance
[2:30:00] it you got to be honest is bram's words
[2:30:05] I got the quotes down there 45 say I'm
[2:30:07] an old man old man and he said bil it
[2:30:10] told Billy you will not be an old man
[2:30:14] until sharks be flowing in this
[2:30:17] place that was
[2:30:21] 1965 Billy Paul was about 25 no Billy
[2:30:26] was 1935 was 30 years
[2:30:29] old Billy Paul was 30 years old that
[2:30:33] time all
[2:30:35] right now I want us to bring I want to
[2:30:39] bring it down so that we can see the
[2:30:41] lines so that your faith can stand
[2:30:44] strong now but I want us to understand
[2:30:48] something so I am not and we are not in
[2:30:52] any way claim claiming the B lies
[2:30:54] against nope but what we are
[2:30:58] saying
[2:31:00] is it is the placing of the prophecy and
[2:31:04] the interpretation and the placing that
[2:31:06] is the
[2:31:08] issue we are not debating he didn't say
[2:31:11] it and we are not debating that will
[2:31:14] bilip died an old man what we are saying
[2:31:17] is the we are talking about the placing
[2:31:20] and the
[2:31:22] interpretation and I want to make it
[2:31:25] clear let's begin from scripture I need
[2:31:27] to read certain things to you here to be
[2:31:30] able to know what is the truth of this
[2:31:32] man brotherr spoke all these things long
[2:31:34] years ago so it's not going to be an
[2:31:37] afterthought second Peter chapter 1
[2:31:40] verse 15 let's begin please oh oh oh oh
[2:31:43] oh oh oh this is hurtful
[2:31:47] I wish I wish I don't have to go
[2:31:50] elsewhere I want to preach on on
[2:31:52] Wednesday but I'll try my best it's just
[2:31:55] that I don't want to miss any fact I
[2:31:57] could just please second Peter chapter 1
[2:32:01] ver1 15 I want us to get the template
[2:32:04] for scripture interpret prophecy
[2:32:06] interpretation listen close moreover I
[2:32:09] will endeavor that ye may be able to
[2:32:11] after my decease to have these things
[2:32:13] always in remembrance Peter knew that
[2:32:16] after I'm dead a lot of things going to
[2:32:18] happen not know a lot of things going to
[2:32:19] happen I dead for we listen close for we
[2:32:23] have not followed canly devis
[2:32:27] favors when we made known unto you the
[2:32:29] power of the and the coming of our Lord
[2:32:31] Jesus Christ
[2:32:33] but but we were what ey Witnesses of his
[2:32:38] majesty continue pre 17 for he received
[2:32:41] from God the Father honor and Glory when
[2:32:44] there came such a voice from him from
[2:32:45] the excellent Glory this is my beloved
[2:32:48] Son in whom I am well
[2:32:50] pleased and this voice which came from
[2:32:55] heaven we heard when we were with me in
[2:32:59] the Holy mon hold it let's pause a
[2:33:00] little bit according to the John Collins
[2:33:04] and the belief sign this time people
[2:33:07] because this particular thing that
[2:33:09] happened or Transfiguration is not
[2:33:12] recorded in Times
[2:33:15] magazine so therefore it didn't
[2:33:19] happen yeah that's what they say they
[2:33:22] said they went to check the newspapers
[2:33:24] then it was not reported so because it's
[2:33:26] not reported so because it was not
[2:33:29] reported in the
[2:33:31] paper the day I arrived United States I
[2:33:35] didn't come to United States at
[2:33:38] all it there's no record of
[2:33:41] it it's not there in the papers it it's
[2:33:45] nonsense
[2:33:47] what the Bible use is what you we must
[2:33:50] base braam on Bible basis of
[2:33:53] verification Bible uses word
[2:34:01] eyewitnesses did you notice this which
[2:34:04] newsp I want to ask you did you think
[2:34:06] they didn't used to write stories and
[2:34:07] newspaper in the days of Jesus they do
[2:34:10] have you read
[2:34:12] Josephus they do they write records do
[2:34:15] you know there is no place Joseph there
[2:34:18] is no history nowhere that ever
[2:34:21] mentioned that there came Moses and
[2:34:23] Elijah Transfiguration and that Jesus
[2:34:25] was transfigured before that is never
[2:34:27] recorded So we we assume because of that
[2:34:30] it does not not happen
[2:34:32] right
[2:34:34] okay if I may ask you I don't know if
[2:34:37] somebody oh BR
[2:34:39] one what is the name of the great what's
[2:34:42] the name of the father of the father of
[2:34:44] the father of the father of the father
[2:34:45] of your father what's his
[2:34:48] name I don't know you don't
[2:34:50] know the death for means you didn't
[2:34:53] have the father of the there's no there
[2:34:55] was nobody that born the father of the
[2:34:57] father of the father of your father
[2:34:59] because it's not on
[2:35:01] record oh yeah that's how he
[2:35:04] works because you don't know that means
[2:35:06] it didn't happen what a
[2:35:11] foolish What a
[2:35:13] wicked way of drawing conclusion
[2:35:17] this thing was not recorded they used to
[2:35:19] have record it was not
[2:35:20] recorded you can base things on that
[2:35:23] list let's let's go please I just I just
[2:35:25] need to drop all this information oh oh
[2:35:27] my and this voice came from we also have
[2:35:30] listen now we also have what a more sure
[2:35:34] word of Prophecy whereby ye do well that
[2:35:38] ye take he oh God as unto what a light
[2:35:42] shineth in the dark place until the day
[2:35:44] down and the day time arising in your
[2:35:46] hearts okay knowing this fact this is
[2:35:48] where I'm going I want me and you to
[2:35:51] establish the scriptural way of dealing
[2:35:53] with
[2:35:54] prophecy knowing this F there are no
[2:35:58] prophecy not a single
[2:36:01] one is allowed by God to be of
[2:36:05] what any
[2:36:09] private go and check the word private
[2:36:11] there is
[2:36:12] personal you can say to
[2:36:14] me my take there's nothing like your
[2:36:18] take on a prophecy
[2:36:20] right it's not allowed there's nothing
[2:36:23] like to me never it's not bra that wrote
[2:36:27] this things this is the basis in which
[2:36:30] bra is to be tested that is where all
[2:36:32] prophets are tested you can't use T
[2:36:35] magazine to
[2:36:36] testam we must use the same Time
[2:36:38] Magazine to test
[2:36:41] Moses why you talking now knowing this F
[2:36:45] that no no Prophecy of the scripture is
[2:36:49] of any any
[2:36:54] any private
[2:36:58] interpretation for the prophecy did not
[2:37:01] come by the will of man if it was man
[2:37:04] that said it man can interpret
[2:37:06] it but because holy men of God were what
[2:37:10] speak as they were
[2:37:13] what so it will be the speak normally
[2:37:16] the person that has the bra
[2:37:17] interpretation of a thing is the speaker
[2:37:19] of the
[2:37:23] thing how can you give Samsung to
[2:37:26] interpret the
[2:37:27] manual of
[2:37:30] Apple how do you do that
[2:37:33] so I want us to understand according to
[2:37:36] the scripture this scripture
[2:37:40] removes ability to interpret that
[2:37:42] prophecy and place it even away from bil
[2:37:44] Paul
[2:37:46] not even bilip has the
[2:37:49] right to say this is what it means this
[2:37:51] is what it means I've he look listen I
[2:37:54] heard
[2:37:55] him in testimony saying
[2:37:58] that I'll see that I'm not an I'm not a
[2:38:02] old man yet I heard it according to
[2:38:05] brother Bam from
[2:38:08] 45 I want you to understand this is why
[2:38:11] somebody wrote to me the other day I got

[2:39:25] prophet I I said I don't answer my
[2:39:27] question when did the prophet change it

[2:40:25] word I said when did he change it he
[2:40:27] couldn't tell
[2:40:28] me say you know you know just
[2:40:33] reasoning and a lot of churches are
[2:40:35] closing because of that and all of that
[2:40:36] stuff like that don't go to I I don't
[2:40:38] know I I'm not
[2:40:40] interested said th say the Lord I am
[2:40:42] leaving the field after me there will be
[2:40:44] nobody right and I said let me tell you
[2:40:46] something there is nothing like Deputy
[2:40:48] eight
[2:40:50] messenger and there is nothing like
[2:40:52] assistant Prophet
[2:40:56] messenger that position does not exist
[2:40:59] or
[2:41:05] vice vice leader of the Bride there's
[2:41:08] nothing like
[2:41:09] that it is the voice and br br said the
[2:41:13] opening of The Seven seal
[2:41:16] put a final fo stop to the New Testament
[2:41:18] say what has happened now there can be
[2:41:20] no further
[2:41:22] advancement may I say it again I said
[2:41:25] the pro I can give you all children you
[2:41:26] can get I get give you the quotes there
[2:41:29] can be no further advancement so he
[2:41:32] can't Advance nowhere this is the final
[2:41:35] thing I said so you can tresen Me by any
[2:41:37] of those
[2:41:38] things when did he change it he talked
[2:41:41] he couldn't he all reasoning and this
[2:41:45] you know once people are looking for
[2:41:47] physical leader I will prove it to you
[2:41:49] that's
[2:41:53] adolat listen
[2:41:55] close
[2:41:58] so I want to understand we verify what
[2:42:01] the message says no prophecy that
[2:42:06] prophecy not even Billy Paul has the
[2:42:08] right to interpret it according to the
[2:42:10] scripture and let me prove it to you now
[2:42:14] please
[2:42:17] the word of
[2:42:19] God Is So set in perfect
[2:42:23] Precision
[2:42:24] that no human being is allowed to give
[2:42:29] his idea and his this on a prophecy is
[2:42:32] of no private oh God if I read all these
[2:42:34] quotes we're not going to live here
[2:42:36] today so I'm so sorry I'll just give you
[2:42:39] brother Bram said oh God wish I can read
[2:42:42] them more he said visions and prophecy
[2:42:45] he say when Visions are given they have
[2:42:47] to be
[2:42:49] interpreted visions and I'll give you
[2:42:51] the an example BR give this example for
[2:42:55] instance when Peter saw a vision of a
[2:43:00] sheet coming down and all kinds of
[2:43:02] four-footed Beast you remember the
[2:43:04] vision
[2:43:06] right that's a vision if you look at
[2:43:09] that Vision it look like God is going to
[2:43:11] give
[2:43:12] Peter some animals
[2:43:15] to catch and for for
[2:43:19] dinner that's what if God left that that
[2:43:22] was just a vision if God left that
[2:43:24] Vision alone it could he said but no
[2:43:27] when the minute came it means
[2:43:29] that there was actually no
[2:43:33] animal the animal is not going to come
[2:43:35] down physically it just means that some
[2:43:38] people are coming they are
[2:43:41] Gentiles and I have Sanctified them they
[2:43:43] are holy go to them don't call them
[2:43:46] Unholy that's the meaning so you could
[2:43:49] see Vision a prophecy must be
[2:43:51] interpreted there was a time Abraham saw
[2:43:54] a vision concerning judge right you can
[2:43:56] get it he saw him with a
[2:43:59] grave he said I don't know it needs to
[2:44:02] be interpreted whether judge right he
[2:44:04] was sick either they digging his grave
[2:44:06] to bury him or it means that some people
[2:44:10] were making fun of him for believing in
[2:44:12] Divine that he is going to bury them he
[2:44:15] said I don't know which way it mean it
[2:44:16] got to be interpreted say visions and
[2:44:19] prophecy itself that there is a vision
[2:44:22] for something does not mean he can he
[2:44:23] must still be
[2:44:25] interpreted and no church member
[2:44:28] including Billy
[2:44:30] Paul
[2:44:32] can ever brother bam
[2:44:36] said
[2:44:37] the
[2:44:40] interpretation of a vision is the
[2:44:44] Fulfillment of of that
[2:44:46] Vision oh
[2:44:51] God please not it down I think I should
[2:44:54] read this one can you be patient with

[2:45:11] together this is braam spoke this in
[2:45:14] 1964
[2:45:18] he said Visions prophecies must have
[2:45:21] inter now let me give you another one

[2:45:29] 64205 paragraph 14
[2:45:33] 64205 paragraph 14 okay now did you
[2:45:37] remember did you remember the vision of
[2:45:40] this constellation of the seven angels
[2:45:42] that the prophet saw in 1962 and
[2:45:44] narrated in s this is the time I
[2:45:45] reproach for the cause of the word do
[2:45:47] you remember did you remember in that
[2:45:49] Vision BR ABR says Joseph was with
[2:45:52] me according to div Vision it's in S
[2:45:56] note it down it's in
[2:45:59] s which is say is this is time which is
[2:46:02] 62
[2:46:04] 1230e paragraph 2 no please don't open
[2:46:07] that one just open the one I'm I'm just
[2:46:08] giving them to note it down open the one
[2:46:10] I give you open
[2:46:12] 64205 but you don't need to open just
[2:46:14] not this one now
[2:46:16] 62230 paragraph 206 you can that you can
[2:46:19] get it there braam saw a vision of the
[2:46:22] constellation of seven angels coming
[2:46:23] down from heaven and there was a blast
[2:46:27] in tuon he saw he was in tuon and there
[2:46:30] was a blast and and he saw that Joseph
[2:46:34] was standing by his side in the
[2:46:38] vision now and the blast was so heavy
[2:46:44] that he said no human being can survive
[2:46:46] that blast and bra say oh my it means
[2:46:48] I'm going to die I must not tell my
[2:46:52] family when listen now when the
[2:46:55] actual if bra had not announced it in
[2:46:58] 1962 people would have said he lied when
[2:47:01] the actual Vision fulfilled in
[2:47:03] 1963 Joseph was not
[2:47:05] there Joseph was at home they were in Du
[2:47:09] Joseph was in school was in school what
[2:47:12] happened God told incest is this the
[2:47:16] time he say the reason why you are
[2:47:18] seeing Joseph in that vision is to show
[2:47:21] you if it was a blast you are thinking
[2:47:23] you are going to God you would think you
[2:47:24] are going to die that does not mean your
[2:47:26] if the you did you remember in that
[2:47:29] Vision when the blast happened to you
[2:47:31] you you were hearing Joseph a small boy
[2:47:33] you were hearing him talking he said
[2:47:35] that Vision if that blast would have
[2:47:37] killed you it would have killed Joseph
[2:47:38] also Joseph presence in the vision does
[2:47:41] not mean when it
[2:47:42] happen I don't know where you get my
[2:47:44] point
[2:47:45] it will be there it just is to show
[2:47:48] you that it does not mean your
[2:47:51] debt that is how he this is why he
[2:47:54] preached Revelation book of
[2:47:56] symbols this is a book of symbols this
[2:48:00] is how he
[2:48:02] works Canal does not work here these are
[2:48:05] not your words leave the things to for
[2:48:08] be interpreted by the person that spoke
[2:48:09] it I want you to understand you were not
[2:48:11] the owner of the prophecy you can't tell
[2:48:13] the meaning
[2:48:16] it's unfair for me to have a dream and
[2:48:18] you are the one interpreting it for
[2:48:21] me you you can't all right please can
[2:48:25] you give me can you give me are you
[2:48:27] there right please listen to this God is
[2:48:30] his own interpreter he don't need
[2:48:34] anybody to interpret for him he
[2:48:38] does his own is that not what Peter said
[2:48:42] in First Peter he does his own
[2:48:43] interpreting who is the
[2:48:47] man not even B PA that can interpret God
[2:48:52] God is his own interpreter
[2:48:56] 15
[2:48:59] 15 oh praise the
[2:49:02] Lord oh brother I love the word of God
[2:49:05] it solves 15 paragraph 15 please
[2:49:07] paragraph
[2:49:12] 15 paragraph 15 I need 15
[2:49:18] please all right I I can continue while
[2:49:20] they looking for it so I'm trying to let
[2:49:24] you know the principles oh okay thank
[2:49:27] you he said now Peter speaking here we
[2:49:32] found out in the beginning Peter when
[2:49:36] God said let there be light and there
[2:49:38] was light that is the interpretation to
[2:49:41] it listen when God said anything
[2:49:46] and it is
[2:49:47] manifested then that is God's
[2:49:49] interpretation of his
[2:49:52] word it is not me to say this is when it
[2:49:57] l it happened that is the
[2:50:00] interpretation all right when he said
[2:50:03] let there be light that was his thinking
[2:50:06] first before there was such a thing at
[2:50:08] light and he said let there be light
[2:50:10] light sprang into the sky that is the
[2:50:14] interpretation
[2:50:15] nobody has to interpret that for God
[2:50:18] said so and there it was when God speaks
[2:50:22] and it's manifested that is in the
[2:50:24] interpretation of the why can't men see
[2:50:28] that why don't people see
[2:50:31] it this is the same problem here why are
[2:50:35] men not seeing it is when he speaks it
[2:50:38] in manifest that's it you do not need
[2:50:40] somebody to say I'm going to no it may
[2:50:45] not ever work the way you ever
[2:50:49] think I want you to underline it why
[2:50:51] can't men see that why don't people see
[2:50:55] please give
[2:50:57] me the slide or the this thing on that
[2:51:01] preaching the video of it I wanted to
[2:51:04] play it why I go

[2:51:41] reported it by
[2:51:43] themselves the fact that you are not
[2:51:46] aware does not your awareness is not
[2:51:48] does not mean whether something is true
[2:51:50] or
[2:51:51] not
[2:51:56] right you know I'm just going to deviate
[2:52:02] here I'm just going to talk about
[2:52:05] something you've heard the testimony for
[2:52:08] years and years and
[2:52:11] years you
[2:52:13] know so Mr rler you and your husband
[2:52:16] told some of your goat
[2:52:18] friends about the California
[2:52:21] earthquake about what Billy Paul said
[2:52:24] won't be you won't be an old man when
[2:52:27] sharks will be swimming
[2:52:32] here I
[2:52:33] know cuz I received emails from
[2:52:40] them telling
[2:52:43] me we were told this by Ivan and Barbara
[2:52:47] many years
[2:52:49] ago we've heard the story
[2:52:54] told how brother
[2:52:56] brandham spoke to his young son Billy
[2:52:59] Paul after the prophecy in Los Angeles
[2:53:03] and

[2:53:23] here you know we have ideas of how
[2:53:26] things are going to be and people have
[2:53:29] built doctrines and thoughts now we look
[2:53:32] at brother Billy Paul is 82 so this Bo
[2:53:35] pre be 82 years old well he's by
[2:53:39] definition an old man he says three

[2:53:45] so how could all this
[2:53:46] be let me just give you some
[2:53:50] information in the
[2:53:54] 1970s brother Charlie Spencer that's
[2:53:56] brother Ron Spencer's father and his
[2:53:59] wife sister
[2:54:01] Spencer they were in their kitchen like
[2:54:05] many of us did back in the day listen to
[2:54:08] Paul Harvey
[2:54:11] news and in the 19 in the in the late
[2:54:15] 1970s or somewhere mid to late whatever
[2:54:18] it was I don't know exactly the date but
[2:54:21] he reported there has been an earthquake
[2:54:24] in Los
[2:54:25] Angeles and then he spoke of the May
[2:54:29] building and that the resulting flood
[2:54:32] from the earthquake had brought in
[2:54:36] sharks that were swimming around the May
[2:54:41] building this very story was also
[2:54:44] confirmed by a member in brother Jason
[2:54:47] Watkins Church his sister this brother's
[2:54:51] sister worked at the May building and
[2:54:54] they were given a memo a warning do not
[2:54:58] go into the basement because there are
[2:55:00] sharks sing in the
[2:55:03] basement sometimes we get things figured
[2:55:06] out yes sir and things have already
[2:55:10] happened yes sir for brother brandham

[2:57:42] apology now in that departmental in that
[2:57:46] departmental store is a whole lot they
[2:57:49] they run these things you see October

[2:57:55] years ago bip was still alive okay there
[2:57:58] were previous to this you will see if
[2:58:00] you go there you can take it and run it
[2:58:03] they started from 1950 something the
[2:58:05] people that W there they were talking
[2:58:07] about sorry they started 197 80
[2:58:10] something and they were making chat
[2:58:12] people was send question they will
[2:58:13] answer different people that knows what
[2:58:15] happened we answer so I we just I just
[2:58:17] cut this one from the big chunk of
[2:58:19] things so you could see the other things
[2:58:21] there somebody
[2:58:23] ask October 19 2017 into into
[2:58:27] this place hi I hear some
[2:58:32] rumor sorry I wonder if you could help I
[2:58:36] heard a rumor that there was a flood in
[2:58:38] the May Company building
[2:58:40] downtown Los Angeles sometimes during
[2:58:44] 1970s and
[2:58:45] sharks were supposedly swimming in the
[2:58:48] basement is there any truth to this this
[2:58:51] guy is just people volunteers that were
[2:58:53] there this guy said there is no
[2:58:55] reference I want to notice the way he
[2:58:57] put it there is no reference to a flood
[2:58:59] or shars and make company in Los Angeles
[2:59:01] Times
[2:59:02] archives okay I want you to notice how
[2:59:06] how it is the AR of Los Angeles Times
[2:59:09] don't say so
[2:59:11] therefore it didn't happen they archives
[2:59:14] of the Roman Empire did not show that
[2:59:16] Jesus resurrected so therefore Jesus
[2:59:19] never rose from the dead the archives
[2:59:21] did not say that Mary mag Mary was
[2:59:26] conceived as a Virgin It is not reported
[2:59:29] in the paper so therefore it did not
[2:59:33] happen if such a thing as a virgin
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:38] conceive
[2:59:40] virgin a
[2:59:42] virgin come
[2:59:44] amen Brethren a virgin it has never
[2:59:48] happened before a virgin conceived
[2:59:50] wooden news have carried it so since no
[2:59:53] news reported it so therefore no it
[2:59:57] didn't
[2:59:58] happen you judge you yourself this guy
[3:00:02] wasn't
[3:00:05] there he said no reference he Mak in Los
[3:00:10] Angeles it was probably an Oran leg
[3:00:14] you just imagine somebody will just sit
[3:00:16] down and cook and say sharks are flowing
[3:00:18] with does it make
[3:00:19] sense just imagine somebody just sat
[3:00:22] down nothing nothing at stake he just
[3:00:24] had to cook a story there were shars
[3:00:26] flowing in the street of
[3:00:28] milap and people will be debating it as
[3:00:30] telling the story does it make sense so
[3:00:34] nonsense it was probably an orand I'm
[3:00:36] reading both sides so that you will see
[3:00:38] we have nothing to hide around the time
[3:00:41] of the popularity please give me the
[3:00:42] next slide give last
[3:00:47] slide another person asked December
[3:00:51] 2017 when the person read it I ask the
[3:00:55] question again please did the
[3:00:58] shars swim in the May Company basement
[3:01:01] during the California earthquake did
[3:01:04] there have let me tell you this
[3:01:06] according to the American I have the
[3:01:08] website here uh I think of Geological
[3:01:12] Survey more than 10,000 earthquakes
[3:01:15] happen in California every
[3:01:19] year till now in fact there's no day
[3:01:21] without earthquake they said the reason
[3:01:24] why it does not show is that some of
[3:01:26] them are on the Richer scale just two on
[3:01:27] the Richer scale so it was not over it
[3:01:30] happens all the time many times it now
[3:01:35] did the wat came till
[3:01:37] May Company downtown Los Angeles please
[3:01:40] let me know this person writer said that
[3:01:43] he didn't didn't say I read this
[3:01:44] somewhere he say
[3:01:47] yes there were
[3:01:49] sharks swimming in May building basement
[3:01:52] this was
[3:01:54] confirmed by a
[3:01:56] coworker this were workers there at the
[3:02:00] basement this was confirmed by a worker
[3:02:02] there at that time a
[3:02:05] memo this is what his brother was saying
[3:02:07] because there are some Believers that
[3:02:09] were walking there back then but their
[3:02:11] voices are not heard
[3:02:15] there was a worker there at that time
[3:02:17] the M was sent to All worker to stay out
[3:02:19] of the basement due to shark
[3:02:21] swimming this is the one that F
[3:02:23] scripture the Bible say ey
[3:02:25] witness it's not about I didn't read it
[3:02:28] somewhere somebody a did not report it
[3:02:30] and so is it everything the newspaper
[3:02:33] reports many of the reports are not even
[3:02:36] so this is it I am saying this that we
[3:02:39] may know now I've given you the last
[3:02:42] please let me give you
[3:02:44] the last proof I want to tell you
[3:02:47] friends it is a
[3:02:49] case of misplacement of Prophecy Billy
[3:02:54] Paul was still a young man at this time
[3:02:56] it happened
[3:02:58] exactly think linking it with the
[3:03:01] earthquake of Los Angeles is human
[3:03:04] thinking the two prophecies had no
[3:03:08] link we never connected Satan connected
[3:03:11] it for
[3:03:12] mischief
[3:03:14] listen close there are no connection and
[3:03:17] let's go by scripture Matthew chapter
[3:03:21] 24:34 Matthew
[3:03:24] 24:34 I'm sorry I know you don't stay
[3:03:26] this long but uh just a few minutes more
[3:03:29] minutes I'm I'm going to get through
[3:03:32] Matthew 24:34 please I'm sorry I just I
[3:03:34] want I want us to read
[3:03:36] this Matthew 2434 and it says this
[3:03:41] generation shall not pass please
[3:03:45] this generation verily right I say unto
[3:03:49] you this generation shall not pass till
[3:03:53] all these things are fulfilled have you
[3:03:57] read what Muslims and other critics of
[3:03:59] the Bible said about this scripture they
[3:04:01] say Jesus prophecy
[3:04:04] failed Jesus said this
[3:04:08] generation shall not pass until how many
[3:04:12] all
[3:04:17] but do you know the meaning Jesus did
[3:04:20] not he's talking about the
[3:04:22] generation that shall see the victory
[3:04:25] right that's right not the generation he
[3:04:29] was talking to but human being that are
[3:04:32] taking it for private
[3:04:33] interpretation and do you know Jesus
[3:04:35] knew they said it he didn't bother he
[3:04:37] didn't answer him he doesn't need to
[3:04:38] defend
[3:04:40] himself how do you accuse a man that is
[3:04:43] dead
[3:04:44] when you know he's not there to defend
[3:04:47] himself what a world Wicked World listen
[3:04:52] they say he never fa he was talking
[3:04:54] about the generation so if was accused
[3:04:57] he was not the first to be accused Jesus
[3:04:58] was accused before him of the same thing
[3:05:01] I may ask you how will you I give you
[3:05:04] this as a as a as as a homework how will
[3:05:06] you explain when Paul say and we which
[3:05:09] were
[3:05:10] alive for the trumpet of the Lord shall
[3:05:13] sound
[3:05:13] and the dead in Christ shall rise and
[3:05:17] we which are alive so where is
[3:05:22] Paul battle with
[3:05:26] that batt when you find solution to that
[3:05:28] then you can come on accuse
[3:05:32] braam listen then let's go to let me
