over this church Lord the pastor Lord all those connected in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray church say amen amen amen if you have your Bibles amen you have your Bibles let's let's turn to um Genesis chapter 17 Genesis 17 then we're going to um we're going to go to um Hebrews chapter 6 Genesis 17 first and then Hebrews 6 let's start reading at verse uh five in chapter 17 Genesis 17 let's just back up let's just start at verse one everybody all right amen verse one and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shal be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceedingly exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generation for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou are a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God Amen Hebrews chapter 6 Hebrews 6 and verse 13 Hebrews 6 and 13 the Bible says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessings I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us amen may the Lord add a blessing to his word amen you can um have your seats by the grace of God hallelujah you know by God's grace tonight you know uh just around the thought the Lord's just really been kind of dealing with me um my subject tonight is the Everlasting Covenant the Everlasting Covenant now um one thing about this before we get into if it's God's grace before we get into the actual Covenant let's understand what God did first first of all when you look at the Covenant he said God made it very very clear he said Abraham now I'm going to do something and I'm going to give you a covenant and this Covenant is going to be between you and me can I get amen God told Abraham he said what I'm going to do is going to be between you and me and then but God didn't stopped there he said and to your seed after you so what I want us to understand tonight that this Covenant what God did every promise that he gave to Abraham he also gave to us hallelujah hallelujah and he called Abraham the father of Faith Hallelujah and and he said you know I'm going to establish this Covenant now nobody did it Hallelujah but God hallelujah Every Blessing every every every multiplying and everything that Abraham possessed in his life came from God hallelujah but it was a part of the Covenant that God gave to Abraham but I want you to understand tonight that what God did for Abraham he also established with his seed after him Hallelujah and you know when we look in the Bible you know God uh uh he's he's you know is one of my favorite words God is very strategic Hallelujah he's strategic amen God is he's very direct God is intentional he knows exactly what he's doing God God doesn't do anything by perhaps or maybe that was just by chance no he's strategic Hallelujah if God ever heals you he meant to heal you if God ever bless you he meant to bless you but I'll say it like this God saved me he meant to save me Hallelujah that's just who he is God Don't Make Mistakes God don't do a maybe or might be he's very intentional Hallelujah so I can say tonight if you're here listening to the word of God you're here by purpose Hallelujah this not no coincidence oh it's Sunday I'm going to church no there was a purpose before the foundation of the world and God saw you here but let's understand something church when we think of the Covenant between God and man now in the beginning God always laid need something out for the believer amen and and when he first started he gave adam a covenant too amen he told Adam hey everything around here is yours just don't touch that am I in the book right Hallelujah he said everything is your just don't touch that if you don't touch that I continue to bless you everything will be all right you'll continue to be a God but the day you touch it is the day you die those were the circumstances of his Covenant so as long as Adam stayed with the with the Covenant between him and God everything was all right but one thing about man man always messes up his part of the agreement man always mess up his part of agreement but God hallelujah is so strategic Hallelujah you look at what the devil the devil say hey I'm going get in creation I'm going to mess up everything but he couldn't mess up the Covenant right Hallelujah because it was just a part of God to redeem man so God would allow things to happen so he can show you what's really in your Covenant Hallelujah see I I give you a little one onone right now on real estate Hallelujah you know if if you if you if for those of us who bought a house you know uh let's just say you got a seller and a buyer amen you know you maybe the seller is selling the house and he got a price and the buyer see the house and you know what the buyer got to do the buyer got to meet the seller's desire Hallelujah he can't just come in there and say Hey I want this house give it to me no you got to come under a covenant right you got to come under a contract Hallelujah and you know what happens that seller lays out he say hey I want x amount of dollars now if you smart Hallelujah you're not going to provoke the seller because he knows what he wants you you ain't going to tax for a $300,000 house say hey sell it to me for a100 sell look at you like you ridiculous s look at you like man who you think you talking to don't you know what this is worth and I to think about God hallelujah sometimes we come to God with ridiculous things and God just wants to remind us don't you realize what your life is worth don't you realize what the salvation I've given you is worth don't you realize the joy the peace and all the things that I've given you in this Covenant is worth Hallelujah why spend your time out there in the world trying to be something in the world when God gave you a covenant hallelujah oh my and you know those two people they get together in the seller Hallelujah the seller has an agent Hallelujah and the buyer has an agent now it's up to the two agents to come together on behalf of the clients now we got a a agent that never misses Hallelujah we got an agent Hallelujah that knows what needs to be taken care of before it even happens Hallelujah we got an agent there's a thing in the real estate in real estate Hallelujah in the real estate era they call a dual agent he can work on both ends Hallelujah and the Holy Ghost it can work on both ends it can work for you and it can touch your enemy Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost can do the Holy Ghost can give you a job Hallelujah and put your boss in check Hallelujah the Holy Ghost can allow you to go to the doctor and walk out of there with a testimony come on now cuz he's a dual agent Hallelujah he sees everything knows everything and knows how to operate to get things accomplished but church when you think of this deal now you got these two agents working for these two clients now they have to come together and make what an agreement a covenant and once hallu the buyer says okay I'll do this and the seller says I'll do this and they come together Hallelujah they say okay I can agree with that that's not good enough Hallelujah that won't hold up in court it has to come under a contract Hallelujah not just a contract cont but there has to be signatures on the line Hallelujah there has to be something that makes the contract binding Hallelujah there has to be something Hallelujah that if me and you in a contract I can come back and say no matter what you say I got your signature oh you might not want to give me the house but I got your signature Hallelujah you might not want to give me the money but I got your signature Hallelujah see what that means is now the contract has been ratified W Hallelujah and when something is ratified that mean it's confirmed and once it gets confirmed then you're bound to what's in the contract Church you may not believe this but we're in a contract with God and the contract has been ratified Hallelujah not only rified with ink no it's been ratified with blood we got his signature in blood so he came back oh Hallelujah all I got to do is pull the contract out and say God you say it Hallelujah I can bring it back put it in his face and say God you have to abide by the contract that you gave me now what I want you to understand Hallelujah once Hallelujah once I buy that house Hallelujah my children got all the same rights I got under that contract that's right W nobody can put them out as long as I own the [Music] house nobody can put you out once you realize what's in the contract there are some things Hallelujah that you're just born with there are some things that you're born into Hallelujah and as the children of Abraham we're Abraham's seed aren't we Hallelujah and he said I'm going to establish my Covenant with you and your seed after you Hallelujah that should excite you because God did some powerful things with Abraham Hallelujah let's just say tonight for anybody who's feeling a little queasy you know you may not be feeling a little good don't you know that one of the first things God promised Abraham Hallelujah that he would touch his body that's in the contract Hallelujah the devil can't stop your healing Hallelujah he can't stop Hallelujah your Rejuvenation of your body that's in the contract if you're Abraham seed it don't matter what you going through God made a put a promise in there he said I'm going to establish this Abraham Hallelujah no matter what's going in your flesh I can make you whole again W no matter what it look like I can make you whole again h no matter what the doub say hu I'll bring you back to a place where you are able to fulfill the words that I gave you and that's what he did Hallelujah that's what he did with Abraham Hallelujah if y'all don't mind can you turn that a off it's it's all on my head Hallelujah but church when we look and when we look into the contract and we see what God has done church we need to step up and say thank you Lord thank you Lord what we need to do we need to go back and look into the life of Abraham and see what God did because he said I'm going to what I do for you I'm going to do for your seed after you and we look one of the first things God did Hallelujah he built up in in the midst of Abraham going through trials what was God doing God was building up his confidence woo Hallelujah you ought to be confident when God gives you a promise see when God first gave Abraham the promise Abraham didn't believe so what God did God allowed him to go through things to build up his confidence that was in the Covenant Hallelujah but church I want you to realize one thing about our God he's so strategic Hallelujah he's so strategic I'm going to say something going to shake your boots right now God is so strategic he will say things he'll speak promises about you in your life knowing you don't believe it yet he said Abraham you going to have a son by Sarah Abraham didn't even believe it but did that change the contract did that change the promise did that stop God from bringing him to it hallu so it don't matter whether you see it or not you can't stop the Fulfillment of what God told you Hallelujah it will come to pass Hallelujah that contract has been confirmed Hallelujah he said he'll speak things in your life knowing you will even believe yet he comes to Abraham and Sarah say hey y'all going to have a child the first thing they start doing they start looking at they their own circumstances Sarah say I'm old shall have pleasure with my Lord did that stop the contract did that make it void did that make it out of date did it expire no God said no you see you see and then Abraham come Abraham say but I'm old I'm this I'm that did that stop the promise no Hallelujah so don't worry about Hallelujah if you don't see it right there stay with it stay with it because it's up to God to bring it to pass Hallelujah because look this is the thing about the old contract God comes and he says AR he comes and says hey the last people I had on contract they fail they couldn't do their part Adam and Eve couldn't do their part they they were under contract and they couldn't do it he said but this time it's going to be unconditional this thing is going to stand Hallelujah it'll stand in a hurricane it'll stand in a snowfall it'll stand in a tornado it'll stand when you lose your job it'll stand when CS is in your body hallelujah it's unconditional God has us under a contract that has nothing to do with what we can do somebody ought to be saying hallelujah cuz you can make mistakes but the contract still stands the Covenant is still there that's right did Abraham make mistakes yes pretty of them but all those mistakes couldn't stop him from fulfilling what God said about him Hallelujah and church as we look and we see what God what God did in the word of God Church let's go back let's go back to Genesis Genesis 17 I want you to understand something a lot of times we look at the word of we look at the revealed word what we have and we're quick to say you know God did this through brother Brown God did this through Moses god do this to Paul you need to ask yourself am I se am I Bri H so Hallelujah if brother brandham did Hallelujah so can I if if if if if Paul did it so can I if if if if Sarah did it so can I Hallelujah church that's what we need to fall back on Hallelujah who you are who we are amen see we're not connected Hallelujah by uhuh let's just say Jews and Gentiles yeah I'm a gentile you say hey no I can't trace my bloodline back to a natural Seed of Abraham no that ain't what we're doing we're not doing this by natural tra we're not looking up your an your an ancestral uh de and all that no we ain't doing that we are royal seeds of Faith right and when you H you tap into the Holy Spirit and you believe on Christ Hallelujah the prop of God say then you know you are Abraham's seed Hallelujah because Abraham could see God for who he was when everybody else didn't even know hallelujah look at the promise of Abraham Church Hallelujah Abraham saw one God when there was three right y'all don't let that go over your head now don't let that go over your head that's why we not Baptist that's why we're not Catholic that's why we're not Presbyterian because Abraham saw three coming and he saw one Hallelujah W that's in the promised church for us not to be confused because even though Abraham Hallelujah he couldn't see himself bringing forth a child he still knew who God was that's right cuz you remember Hallelujah when the three came to Abraham Abraham looked at all three of those men coming maybe we should say the father Son and Holy Spirit Hallelujah you see those three coming Abraham looked at all three of them bowed down and say yes my Lord why did he do that that was in the sea Hallelujah that was in the Revelation and that's why we can follow this message of the yah Hallelujah because Abraham saw God for who he was and you notice how it went through the generations you had Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph Hallelujah you look at all that coming down through the seed amen let's just start with Abraham one thing that came out of that seed was what faith faith is in your contract you don't have to muster up nothing you just have to take God that his word you just got to believe it Hallelujah Church think about it the element of Faith the element of faith is in Abraham God so you know what you didn't did some stuff he said you know what but this what I'm going to do I'm going help you get there I'mma change your name I'mma change your name so your name will reflect what you're going to be God [Music] my you talking about speaking into somebody life Hallelujah his name was Abram but God said no I'mma change your name to Abraham because you are a father of Nations and didn't even have a child yet that's what's in your seed prise Lord oh lord lord we just praying we know the economy bad Lord I just need another car speak it step and do it look what God did to Abraham when God changed his name he said now this what I want you to do he said your name is going to be Abraham cuz you're a father of Nations and that God is gonna God's going to encourage him God's going to take away all his doubt he may be looking at himself as an old man and then God say hey your name is Abraham now cuz you're a father of nation and then God say something to him that he never would have thought about he said now go walk before me and be thou perfect yeah D look at that church God was telling the man before you even get there you already perfect I want you to believe in what I tell tell you these things are in the seed already you know when you plant a apple Hallelujah the color of the seed is already in it Hallelujah you know when you plant it Hallelujah the taste of what it's going to be is already in it you don't have to add some elements to it no all you have to do is put it in the right ground and as it come forth everything that's in that seed has already been passed down he W it don't come as the seed starts to grow no it's already been passed down from the previous seed hallelujah it's already been passed down from the root that's already been planted Hallelujah church and there are things that are in us that have already been planted it just come with it so you can understand what I'm saying you know he says how do he become Abraham's seed we are born into this hallelujah we're baptized into this amen that's right there's nothing we we per se naturally do but we're there by election amen Church we've been elected to do this it's just a part of who I am you know what I didn't wake up one morning brother war and say I want to be an evangelist no the gift just started percolating one day Hallelujah I was reading the word and looking at it and I something just started happening to me what was it it was already in me Hallelujah the gift of a pastor was already in him Hallelujah somebody started talking to him one day and he sat him down he said brother you see here you sit there and after they fin they say man you must be a pastor it was already in the seed before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and you think about Destiny and election and all these things it goes together with predestination but I want you to show you that there's nothing we're doing is God's grace some of us are working so hard to try to make something he said you know what he said since nobody else can do this I'm going to swear by myself nobody's going to mess this up Hallelujah I'm going to make sure that this comes to pass now back to the devil the devil thought he was so smart by messing up the first Covenant messing up Adam and Eve say ah man I didn't messed up I I got it I didn't messed I'm in there now got my SE going God say you big dummy I let you do that so the attributes of who I am can come out right God allowed the fall why Hallelujah because he was a protector he was a deliverer he was a savior he was a father and see Satan didn't even know Hallelujah by breaking the covet he oh my by breaking the Covenant God revealed more of what was in there that's right cuz you know when you buy certain things it comes with a warranty when you get that new house built it comes with a warranty Hallelujah and sometimes you have to go back and see how long do this thing happen as long as you stay with the house but there are things that comes along with who you are okay you take a child just seen a little baby you take a child he's born into a family right because he's born into a family there's things that that child will experience that just comes along with a bir hallelujah amen that child is born and then the mother starts the Love on the child baby don't ask for it it just come child get hungry Hallelujah he got to ask for the mother's dare to make sure he's fast hallah see there there's things within her that just begins to operate because that child need it there are things in God that just begins to operate because we need it and your circumstance your situations will just bring it out of him Hallelujah you look Church the prophet of God say when that child is born that child really don't know nobody who he is but as it grows it gets more and more familiar with who first the mother right because she's the caregiver hu Daddy's standing right over there but he don't just looking at Daddy because he ain't connected with Daddy yet but he's connected with Mama Hallelujah Mama picks them up and everything get quiet Hallelujah even though father is the natural daddy the baby is still cry why because he hasn't made that connection yet Hallelujah but that mother she just loves on the child she gives the child clothes and food and rainment all that comes without asking because it's a part of the birth it's a part of the birth and it's in her to do these kinds of things hallelujah look amen you take a real mother She'll always protect that child walking across a busy highway out there I can't even think of name of the highway but say they got to cross the highway the mama ain't going to just say to an infant Child come on follow me walk up let's go oh she going to grab his hand come on and the child might be trying to get away like no uh-uh this for your good and I know right now God got some of y'all hand and y'all trying to get away and he want to make sure that you don't get trampled he want to make sure you don't get hurt so he got your hand Hallelujah want to make sure you get to the other side Hallelujah he got that grip on you why it's for your good you didn't ask for protection but that's just who he is he's a protector Oh my he he said I'm going to establish this with you and your seed after you and you look what God established Hallelujah Abraham Hallelujah Abraham was worried about his family and different things and then God told him to say Hey you get rid of everybody I'm going just take care of this hu you let lot go down there lot got lost and all these other things and then Abraham came back crying for his family he came back saying Lord will you destroy h uh the righteous with the wicked he said if I can find 50 will you just have mercy God say I have mercy couldn't find 50 God who's longsuffering Hallelujah could still see the family out there God say if you find he said if you find 40 I'll wait on you if you find 30 I'll wait on you church if you waited on Abraham's family he'll wait on your family also praise the Lord hallelujah but it's up to you to keep pleading Mercy for them Hallelujah because look the Bible says that the sins of Sodom Vex Right light righteous Soul what made lot righteous cuz he didn't do anything according to the scripture what made him righteous he looked like an unbeliever what made him righteous it was the prayers of Abraham God could not deny those prayers that was going up for the family and now the prophet comes and he says all that love you and you you ever love praise we worried about this we worried about that no look you got the power to go get them didn't Abraham do that lot was down there carrying on whole family acing up first thing God did God sent Angels down God sent Angels down there first Hallelujah to to prepare them for the visitation and then you know what Hallelujah God destroyed the place you know before he got there some Kings went it took lot Abraham say hey I'm G Fight for my family my family ain't just going to the world I'm GNA fight for my family Abraham took 316 or 18 servants people that were Cooks that's right gardeners one of your people that had no experience in war but an anointing fell on him yes an anointing fell on them in the moments of adversity Hallelujah and I want you to understand that's in your Covenant Hallelujah when you don't know what to do there's an anointing that will fall in your life Hallelujah for that battle that you will win Hallelujah Church let's look at the scriptures how many battles did Abraham lose none none cuz that was a part of the COV you say well you say well the man the man came and took his wife no reason why he couldn't keep him because because God had a promise he had to keep and if that man Hallelujah would have took Sarah and Mar Sarah it would made the promise of God Bo now what you need to do is go back to the promise that God gave you how many got the Holy Ghost the scripture says hallelujah and the promise is unto you and unto your children and unto those who are a far off Hallelujah church we have promises and things that God has given to the seed after Abraham that we need to tap into right Hallelujah but what I love about Church don't get nervous I'm about to close what I love about it when we see what God did for Abraham we ought to be able to go back and say Yes Lord cuz the promise and I keep repeating this the promise is for you and your seed after him how many believe Abraham was blessed anybody ever made mistakes ever ever ever did somebody wrong what did God say he say I'll make your enemies your foot stool look we be worried about stuff look what God did Abraham lied God didn't even look at the lie all God want to do is make sure nothing mess up his promise and then he takes the person who was right and make him repent woo make him man you told my favor you do my favor somebody apologizing to you for what you did the man apologized to Abraham for what he did why because God keeps his word oh my look my daughter the one who came here with me or her job they they they pretty much uh set her up to get rid of her cuz she's a Christian you know how that work there'll be somebody looking at you jealous of you or whatever the case is and all you doing is just working for the Lord Mighty own business they don't like it cuz you clean looking you ain't got no makeup on you ain't got no butterfly eyelashes way out here in front of your nose and all you ain't got none of that stuff you just you just living for God you know what I mean and I you know I ain't saying that to to laugh but what I'm saying there's a there's a certain look in character that a woman looks at a Christian woman and say in their heart of hearts that's what they desire to be real Beauty Hallelujah and you know what you know she don't do all that other stuff and what they did was they had some some coupons and different things and everybody was using them when she used it it was wrong everybody else used it now when she used it uhoh we got we got to we got to uh hold her to charge we got to do something about this so the manager told her say hey you can't come back to work till we have a talk so she comes and comes back to work the manager sits down with her and and and she begin to pray she say Lord you know I'm just trying to live for you and give me some extra dollars and uh uh whatever your will is Lord I I accept it so she get in how often we do that do you ever go in before a trial or go in before something and say Lord whatever your will is church I do that when I walk in the bank Hallelujah I walk in the bank I don't be afraid of them telling me no because they can only tell me what God's will is if they say no that's God's Will and they say yes that's God's will that's the attitude we need to take Hallelujah when you go into things put God first because God has to honor his Covenant Hallelujah he said in blessings I Will Bless thee and multiply I will multiply thee Hallelujah so when I go into a place I expect multiplication because that's what happened with Abraham Hallelujah and if it don't happen that means it was God's will for me not to get it Hallelujah see then you don't have to go out second get oh my credit my credit God God don't care about no credit I don't know about y'all but I got perfect credit perfect y'all looking like oh boy show wish I had it's it's you know what it is it's Faith perfect credit is hallelujah being born again Hallelujah all things are possible Hallelujah can nothing about no experience hu but you look Church she she everybody all right she came to the job the boss man sat down he said look well you use this coupon look looked it up and use this coupon coupon really for the customers she was thinking that everybody be using us you know so why me you know and then things started coming out there's another little little young manager on the job and say hey we got to watch her like why why we got to watch her what she doing she ain't doing nothing but see spirits of jealousy will be sitting there looking at you and all you doing is just living for God hallelujah she at work with her long dress on you know just just looking like a Christian and now there somebody else saying we got to keep our eyes we got to watch her so they pretty much set her up you know they set up and everybody doing this so when she did it they brought it to the big manager's attention say she did this right here one of the other women that worked there she came out and she said what are they doing she said they say I should have used I should she said everybody's using it why they picking you out and this lady who don't know what we know she said I don't agree with this she's a denominational Christian she said I don't agree with this me and my husband going to go pray right now when you ain't got time to call nobody God got people working Hallelujah God got people working in your favor Hallelujah remember brother brandom said it's the system that's bad there still good people in there Hallelujah this this this this woman say hey um I when I get off me and my husband we F to go pray right now so she sat down talked to the boss boss said well I'm going just have to let you go because you did this my daughter didn't argue she didn't fuss she didn't kick and stream or nothing and that baffled him that baffled him he was looking for her to raise them say everybody else will do it don't plead your case hold your peace let God fight your battles that's in the Covenant hallelujah amen Abraham didn't have to say a word he lied he did wrong God said let him go go pray let the liar pray for you Hallelujah so she said well if that's what it is that's what it is said you know I had a good time working I appreciate y'all walked out soon as she got in the car with me her phone rang soon as she got in the car from from the restaurant to the car soon as she got in the car it was that same manager he said when you walked away I got convicted W Hallelujah he promised to fight your battles Hallelujah remember the man saying God you know the Integrity of my heart he said it's because the Integrity I Won't Let You sin against me and that same manager who's Prof professing to be a Christian he said the way you handled me and convict me nobody never did that before he say so this what we going to do he said I'mma call all the other managers and I'm going say hey we going to give you Thanksgiving off all the way to Christmas and then the first of the year you start back up again you talking about favor is in our seed so she didn't have to take days off for Thanksgiving she didn't have to take days off for Christmas she didn't have to take days off for New Year God gave her time off praise the Lord and when she came back when she started back that's my longarm oh my run out of time when she came back after not being there for those what almost month and a half when she came back she got a raise in a higher position [Music] in blessings I Will Bless thee in multiply I will multiply thee Hallelujah your enemies Hallelujah is God's enemy he said I'll curse those that curse you I'll bless those that bless you and she didn't have to plead her case that manager went to everybody else and say this is what we're going to do for Kiara she didn't have to say a word why because that's passed down for the seed after him Church you don't have to fight your battles God will it's in the seed so let's look as we go down we see what happens and I'm going run this down real real fast I'mma close as we look and we see what happened went from Abraham building a faith God changed his name to a father of Nations and Abraham steps into it why because God put a word out there God put a word out there on only for him Hallelujah and then he said you're going to have a child with Sarah only Sarah Hallelujah and you know what he had the child now here comes Isaac Hallelujah and then more of what's in that seed start to come out you don't have to worry about perfect love he was already in the seed Hallelujah remember the Bible says hallelujah he who lays life down shall gain it hallelujah what did Isaac do he laid his life down Hallelujah Glory he said hey Dad we got the altar we got the wood we got all this stuff but where's the sacrifice and Abraham speaks over his son and says God shall provide himself a sacrifice but what I want you to understand Isaac had already laid his life down Hallelujah and if you lay your life down you'll gain it again why because that's the promise of Abraham Hallelujah but you know what church there's a part in that seed that we look at that comes after Abraham boy it look bad bad and it's called Jacob I was saying the other night I was preaching yall know Jacob was the first one who was tricking that's the saying they got in the world boy she she out there tricking he tricking everybody tricking Jacob was the first one who was tricking cuz every time you turn around he was tricking somebody out of something trick trick his brother out his birth right birth right trick his father out the blessing he went the father Lord trick him out of some Camel trick trick trick trick trick trick Jacob was Jacob was the master of tricks and you know what his nature his nature at that time didn't fit with the promise but he was a part and just like all of us we were born in sin shapen in iniquity but God had to had to Hallelujah had to bump into us with this truth Hallelujah because this truth was the only thing that could change our nature Hallelujah this truth was the only thing Hallelujah that could turn us into a new creation Baptist Doctrine couldn't hold us Pentecostal Doctrine couldn't hold us Catholic Doctrine could hold us so God had to bump into us with something that could change us so we could match the testimony of what he told Abraham Hallelujah and he says look your name is Jacob which is a planter and Jacob was tricking trick and tricken then he had to get to a place where he got sick of who he was that's in the Seas yes that's in the cover right you have to get sick of that owe you you have to get sick of your flesh and that's what Jacob did he got sick of who he was and his past begin to bring up old fears now he's he's God told him said I want you to go back to your Homeland go back where you came from and on his way back his past met him he said Esau's coming and you know the last thing you heard from Esau I'mma kill you I'mma kill you Jacob you stole my Birthright I'mma kill you cuz remember he left home because of Esau and his last testimony his last memory of his relationship with Esau was he was running for his life now God is telling him I want you to go meet that fear I'm getting into the just of closing all of us in here tonight we have to meet that in which we are afraid of now I'm talking about in your service to God you got to meet that and Conquer it because that's in the Covenant hallu and Jacob had to look at himself and say you know what this is not who I want to be Hallelujah I don't want to be afraid of my past but one there one thing about some people that're in church they'll come and pay TI and do all these things and still be a slave to their past I can't we can't go in that restaurant they playing music you go in there to eat or dance what you going to do we can't we can't go to that they got a bar in there you going there to drink or eat what you going to do I can't go to that gym they be playing worldly music what you going you going to work out or dance which one you going to do we find out people are afraid of their past and they supposed to be delivered yes you delivered it has no hold over you right that's right Hallelujah that's right if you're delivered amen you're not afraid of it Hallelujah I wasn't a a big alcohol drink or whatever you know I casually sip God delivered me from casually sipping and you know what I could walk a Walmart walk down the beill out look at all over it and say oh they selling 18 packs now walk right on by don't do nothing to me you know why because God destroyed that crav when he saved me listen when he saved me he saved me from my own fleshly desires W that's the power of the Covenant Hallelujah see the blood of bulls and goats couldn't change your desire so God hallelujah he made a covenant with his blood Hallelujah his is his blood he's on the other end of that Chinese piece of paper h Hallelujah Glory oh my church you know you have people they so afraid of their past I I used to do this I can't go here I you need to get delivered person say smoke do that smoke in my facee they better they better go for our backslide you ain't delivered praise the Lord you ain't delivered Hallelujah because once God Saves you from something then you become the enemy Hallelujah he saved me from rap music and all that nonsense whatever they listening to now ain't got no ho no power like man cut that foolish all what they talking about bunch of jble jble jble jble jble you don't even know what they talking about when you get delivered Hallelujah God takes the taste away Hallelujah that's in the seed Church Hallelujah he took Jacob's fear completely away hallelujah how did he get that though he had to wrestle and that's what's wrong some of us ain't in desperation this world is not getting better Hallelujah you better get down to business with God and make sure you've entered into a nature change CU that's what it was about for Jacob it was about Hallelujah Born Again experience it was about being changed that's the promise of Abraham than Hallelujah Jacob had to look at his past remember AR he was Esau said I'mma kill you but he tried to reason his way out of it you can't reason your way out of your bad habits no God has to touch you and Abraham I mean Jacob he he he said hey you know I walk across this Jordan with just a rod now I got two bands families he says Hey I want y'all to go this way I want y'all to go that way and I'mma go down here and meet Esau but before I go before I go I'm going get business with God I'm G make business with God before I go meet him I'm going get on my knees and cry out to God and Jacob Hallelujah when you go back and read in Genesis 32 is one of the first and only times you really see Jacob crying out every other time he was just tricking people he was just letting his hand do the work he wasn't praying about nothing he was just doing it but in this moment he say the god of My Father Abraham the god of my father Isaac oh my God how I need you you see what he did he started to bring up the promise he started to he started to go back and look in the Covenant Hallelujah he said God you was a god of Deliverance to Abraham Hallelujah you was a god of my father Isaac and he said Lord I need you right now and he got a hold of God and he didn't let go until he was changed that's what we need in church we need a change we don't need just good quotas good Bible vers us no we need change people hallelujah church he got down the business he said let me go the day is almost breaking let me go he said no I let you go not until who whoa what was it until not until you bless not until you bless where did that come from he didn't ask for something different he said I want the same blessing you gave my father you said I'm G to bless you're going and you're coming in I'm G to multiply and and Jacob grabb a hold of and Jacob wouldn't let go who was the last time you grab a hold of God and didn't let go until you got a blessing brother ju one of the greatest Arts of getting in contact with God we don't hardly utilize no more fasting and praying the church used to fast and pray yeah consecrate their lies push the plate back say Lord I need an answer Lord I need an answer now we God ain't answer me yet can you give me more apple pie when do you mean business with God Church fasting Hallelujah is one of the most powerful tools God has ever given us to give in contact with you say is it that powerful listen Hallelujah remember the Judgment God was going to put on Ahab Hallelujah he said he said look out Abraham Ahab humble himself before me I'm not going to bring the judgment on him I'm going to do it on his son and we I want me some more Nando I me some more chicken some more Burger we got to push it back jur mean business of God so with God say Lord take God back to his word say Lord I seen what you did for Abraham I seen what you did for Isaac now I'm in need right now and Jacob he wrestled with the angel wrestle and the Bible says and he prevailed think about that church the power that's in the Seed of Abraham we got the ability to Prevail over God oh my that mean you can get down there stay down there until God come through where's that church where are those people instead of brother I need to pray can you pray for me you in what about you getting down and praying making business with God until you're changed until you get a touch from God Jacob Hallelujah he didn't let go willfully look at the church he didn't let go willfully Hallelujah he had to get a touch on from the angel that he had to let go God basically pushed him off say he got hit in his thigh change his walk Hallelujah where is that desperation Hallelujah that's in the seat of Abraham Hallelujah and then not only that here comes God again a part of the Covenant he said you know what I'm going to do now he said you're no longer going to be a trickster you're no longer going to be Jacob I'm G to I'm going to make your name match your testimony Hallelujah he said you're no long going to be Jacob but your name is going to be Israel because you're a prince Hallelujah God changed his name to match his testimony Hallelujah Glory you you know he did the same thing for you and I he say I no longer call you church but I call you bride Hallelujah and if I'm a bride Hallelujah that means I've been accepted I've been proposed to Hallelujah that there's a house waiting on me Hallelujah not a bride a bride is a carrier of seed Hallelujah a bride she's going into the chamber Hallelujah not the church with a pride oh my in my closing as we look at that whole journey from Abraham and his seed after him last one we want to look at look what God did through Joseph he overcame jealousy he overcame envy and hatred he overcame being lied on he overcame bondage being thrown in jail W he overcame he overcame disappointment cuz he was forgotten in jail hallelujah oh my and he overcame his own self- bitterness Hallelujah he didn't get bitter in the midst of going through his trial look at all the things Hallelujah that's promised to the seed after Abraham you can overcome he overcame lust demons parer's wife was chasing him y'all realize that that woman was chasing him it wasn't just one day she you man come has a hard day worship man M don't be doing his work she come up again just like how those men and those women those worldly ones out there chasing God's children right because they they want something clean and genuine hallelujah oh my Jacob I mean Joseph he overcame that Hallelujah he overcame all the things that he was going through he overcame Hallelujah being put in jail even though he was innocent he overcame bondage he overcame his own mind battles probably saying Lord what did I do to deserve this but in the midst of it all he was telling people I can't sin against my God hallelujah that's the aborah have seed to stand strong in the midst of all adversity keep in mind it ain't you doing it it's the grace of God because he said Hallelujah I'll never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah and you look at how the promise of Abraham was reflected out through the sea after him and they obtained the promise Hallelujah just because of what they came just because of being deceived after Abraham and you can see everyone reflected the god of my father Hallelujah the god of my father that was the testimony the god of my father church that went all the way down to our day cuz remember before Elisha got the promise what did he do he called out the god of his father Hallelujah and Elijah Hallelujah on Mount camon what did he do he called out the god of his father see Abraham seed has a right to call on the god of their father because it's in the seed it's in the Covenant Church we're in a covenant with God and I want each and every one of us to go back and look at the life of Abraham and what God gave to him at every promise remember the prophet of God said he said he said the right midle attitude will bring every Divine promise to pass if we can believe it if we can believe it Hallelujah just like women that are Barren HJ God opened up Sarah's wom why because that's a part of the promise Hallelujah I know a sister who was baren after she got prayer she had twins I know I I know a sister say she wanted a she remember remember that one that the the the the boy or the child was blind uh and the prophet say they didn't even have eye sockets he said he started to pray this is the testimony so he started to pray but he stopped right in the midst of the prayer and he said what color eyes you want W oh my and been Paul's testimony he said he said dad asked him what color eyes he want and and and the person said blue he said he looked and saw a blue Street coming out the [Music] sky oh my Hallelujah that ain't just for our Prophet that's what the see children of Abraham look I might not never need squirrels but I got a promise Hallelujah I might not never need to talk to a storm but I got a promise Hallelujah and it's so in in fact right now when I was flying out here hallelujah and he was he was watching it I was flying out here from from from Carolina to Atlanta the wind was blowing so bad they delayed the flight they said no we can't we can't this was the pilot the pilot words he said we can't fly right now because the winds are so bad and it it's going to be a very bumpy ride all the way down there so we just waiting till all the planes get diverted because the winds were so bad so Air Traffic Control had so many planes in Atlanta because the wind was so bad they couldn't all come in at one time so we sit there waiting on the TAC about 30 minutes finally Hallelujah I'm sitting in the plane and I'm hearing all this so I started praying if you ain't got to have a bumpy ride why have a bumpy ride Hallelujah I don't think y'all hearing me you got the power to change your circumstances so I I didn't want a bumpy ride on the plane and I believe Hallelujah that I can ask and have what I ask for so I prayed I said Lord please father in your name whatever the prayer was Lord just give us a smooth ride church we got up in the air we hit that altitude and I started thinking what happened to the bumping ride that ride was smooth like butter all the way down Hallelujah church I don't think I felt a bump till we got in Atlanta descending Hallelujah I say so much for your bumping ride your bumping ride got caught up in prayer Hallelujah and I'm here to say for those of you who are having a bumpy ride you need to pray about it hallelujah it's time to pray about some of these things and watch God change the situation we need to take God at his word hallelujah let's pray let's pray Hallelujah Lord we love you and we thank you Father for all things we pray Lord something said to help your people we know we just kind of all over the place but Lord we know you've given us a covenant Lord a true Covenant Lord a a ratified agreement with you and your blood Lord the death Buri and resurrection of our

here and he was talking about something that uh is getting away from the church and he he mention fasting I just I just wrote a little thing down here just to remind myself of how much even science medical doctors are beginning to discover the benefit that's right of fasting praise the Lord that even uh they beginning to realize that's one of uh uh the best meod that most of these doctors are introducing into their uh uh weight loss you know program you know fasting and different different things but you will realize that for the believer it's it's more of or discipline right it's not about starving yourself it's just it's just coming into that place and and uh uh you know U taking on some Godly discipline where you can just set a set a set a time aside that you just you just want to be with the Lord you know brother Brandon taught us that it is not something that you just you just jump into and you just take it you got to pray about it because all hell is going to be against you praise the Lord you know people give themsel you know over to uh fasting and and sometimes they come out with uh with different things you know you got to be ready for it but it has to be something that uh is more of a of a spiritual discipline to the believer you know like I said to to most of the people you know uh the religious word has set a time clock to fasting brother Bram said no he said it's how much he said your body needs food and water to be able to sustain itself so if you discipline yourself to spend uh just 3 hours before the Lord or just uh uh uh to to to Asain from breakfast uh give up your breakfast and just spend that morning time with the Lord or uh stay from the morning till noon just what your body can be able to take because it's something that you have to grow into if you just uh set yourself aside and say well I want to fast s to say and you don't have the spiritual strength to be able to endal you will just be PL in your mind and pl in your body but it's all about discipline praise the lord well we want to thank the Lord for the word tonight reminding us all the things that is with in the Covenant amen all the benefit that can come with the
