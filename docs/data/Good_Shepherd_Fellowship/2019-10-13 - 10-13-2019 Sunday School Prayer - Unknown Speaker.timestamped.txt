[1:36] minutes we are still going to be looking
[1:37] at our prayer topic and we are trusting
[1:40] your grace or dad to help us we know
[1:44] that a revision can be very boring some
[1:46] of the times but we are trusting your
[1:49] grace that you bring some excitement for
[1:50] the old guard even as we continue to
[1:52] look at his prayer topic help us further
[1:55] in our walk with you and let a name be
[1:58] glorified in all of this we're just
[2:01] thanking were shitty father once again
[2:03] in Jesus name Amen
[2:06] you're all warmly welcome welcome radar
[2:11] normally on Sundays in the morning
[2:14] between 1015 and 10:45 which is 30
[2:19] minutes we have adult Sunday School so
[2:25] not to confuse you
[2:28] yes so just bear with us praise be to
[2:31] God
[2:31] so we are so with two of our revision
[2:38] looking at prayer now before I go into
[2:43] what I want us to look at today let me
[2:47] just take a moment you know to encourage
[2:49] I was talking to somebody the other day
[2:54] over over an issue they mentioned that
[2:59] oh they have prayed and prayed and
[3:02] prayed and prayed and it's like there is
[3:06] nothing happening when you get to that
[3:11] stage it is not a button to feel like
[3:18] there is nothing happening but it's a
[3:20] button when you get to that point and
[3:22] then you cave in or you give up so it
[3:26] looks like doubt was beginning to set in
[3:29] or doubt had already set in you know for
[3:34] every prayer we offer to God if that
[3:39] prayer is not been answered God has no
[3:43] weight according to our timing god works
[3:46] according to his timing so in our walk
[3:51] with God and in our prayer lives we
[3:53] ought to be very very patient with God
[3:56] when you have prayed and prayed and
[3:58] prayed and prayed and it's like nothing
[4:01] is happening still keep holding on by
[4:07] you holding on shows how much you have
[4:10] faith in God that God would answer the
[4:13] prayer when you begin to doubt that is
[4:17] where the problem comes in for every
[4:20] prayer you say let just just take it
[4:22] this way maybe there's a bucket
[4:24] as I study for buckets and every prayer
[4:27] you see maybe it's a cup of water you
[4:28] put in the bucket every prayer you see
[4:33] it's a cup of water you put in the
[4:35] bucket and the water level keeps rising
[4:38] even though we are not seeing the result
[4:40] yet but when you begin to doubt it's
[4:45] like you have suffered so much praying
[4:48] over something and then you put a hole
[4:52] in the bucket
[4:53] probably the bucket was almost full
[4:57] you've been praying and trusting God but
[5:00] when you begin to doubt now it's like oh
[5:03] the water you put in the bucket which is
[5:06] getting to is brim now you ended up
[5:09] putting a hole under the bucket and
[5:11] draining the water out that is what
[5:14] doubt does but so long as your faith in
[5:19] God remains there it keeps you said keep
[5:24] holding on to God that prayer is good it
[5:30] doesn't matter how long it takes God is
[5:33] going to glorify himself praise be to
[5:35] God so never get tired praying never
[5:39] give up never let doubt come between you
[5:45] and God praise be to God so today we are
[5:59] so talking about prayer and just picking
[6:03] bits and pieces here things we've
[6:06] already talked about and trying to add a
[6:09] few things trusting that God would
[6:12] continue to help us now when you read
[6:17] first Timothy 2 1 2 3 if we can open our
[6:23] Bibles
[6:34] kimochi if you get it before me you can
[6:46] read it
[6:46] first Timothy two two one two three okay
[6:56] I exotic therefore that first of all
[7:01] supplications prayers intercessions and
[7:05] giving of thanks be made for all men for
[7:11] kings and for all that are in authority
[7:15] that we may lead a quiet and peaceful
[7:18] life in all godliness and honesty for
[7:24] this is good and acceptable in the sight
[7:27] of God our Savior praise be to God now
[7:31] when you look at the life of the Lord
[7:33] Jesus Christ all his life was just
[7:39] nothing but prayer and as the song goes
[7:44] Jesus that I would prayer and he ended
[7:47] with prayer prayer was his companion and
[7:53] he would pray to the Father pray for the
[7:58] sick deliver people from the earth from
[8:02] from from from from evil spirits just
[8:06] praying sometimes is very very easy for
[8:12] us to pray for one another as brothers
[8:13] and sisters in God but when it comes
[8:16] your neighbor your next-door neighbor or
[8:21] the fellow seated next to you in the
[8:23] office we are quick to brand them and
[8:28] prayer is the last thing we would ever
[8:31] think doing for them but it was also
[8:36] with Jesus not only was he praying for
[8:42] those in the household of Israel but
[8:46] even outside
[8:48] he prayed for them we can talk about
[8:51] there is sort of machine and woman the
[8:54] Greek woman whose daughter was possessed
[8:57] by evil spirit and she went to the Lord
[9:01] Jesus we know the story we don't have
[9:04] much time not when to go into it and
[9:06] Jesus said it is not me to give daily
[9:10] deterrence bread to the dogs and she
[9:14] said how be it the crumbs that fall to
[9:16] the ground the dogs can't can take that
[9:19] and Jesus saw her faith and healed
[9:23] Hedorah not only that we can also talk
[9:27] about the Centurion whose beloved
[9:30] servant was sick to the point of death
[9:33] and he called the elders of Israel and
[9:37] sent them to the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:39] asking him to come and heal his servant
[9:41] and then they wanted a lord and they
[9:44] were telling him oh this is a very
[9:47] wonderful man he loves our nation he has
[9:51] built us a synagogue they give a very
[9:53] good report about him and the Lord Jesus
[9:55] could not turn him down and while he was
[9:58] on his way go into his house and a
[10:01] Centurion hell jesus was coming he sent
[10:04] his servants it's a good and tell him
[10:07] that I am not worried that he should
[10:10] come under my roof needed wife counted
[10:13] ready to come to him but wherever he is
[10:16] he she just stopped his just picked away
[10:19] praise be to God I am a man set in
[10:23] authority I tell this go and they go I
[10:25] tell this come and they come
[10:27] I tell these do this and they drew it
[10:29] what was he saying he recognized the
[10:33] Lord Jesus was a man of authority that
[10:37] he could speak to the storms and the
[10:40] storms would be good would obey he
[10:44] speaks
[10:49] and the Lord Jesus marveled he said what
[10:53] I have not found such a faith in Israel
[10:57] I have not found it
[11:00] praise be to God so prayer was his
[11:04] companion he didn't only have to pray
[11:08] for those he called brethren but even
[11:12] outside of the camp wherever there was a
[11:17] need and he was called upon
[11:19] he still prayed bear with me I want us
[11:23] to go to a place here now as we said
[11:32] prayer was his companion on his life and
[11:36] even on the cross he still prayed when
[11:41] he was crucified and he hung on the
[11:46] cross when he was lifted between the F
[11:49] and the heaven he's afraid when he said
[11:54] Father forgive them for they know not
[11:57] what you are doing he was praying praise
[12:01] be to God and not only that a bit on the
[12:08] cross he was still answering prayer the
[12:14] two male factors that were crucified
[12:16] with him and one read on him started
[12:24] making fun of him if you had a Christ
[12:26] ago self and save us and the other one
[12:29] rebuked him and told him that we are
[12:33] suffering this because we deserve it
[12:37] because of the crime we have committed
[12:41] but this man here is innocent he has not
[12:44] done anything wrong don't you feel good
[12:47] and after that he said Lord remember me
[12:54] when you come in that Kingdom praise be
[12:57] to God and Allah Jesus told him
[13:01] verily I say unto you today you are
[13:05] going to be with me in paradise even on
[13:08] the cross he was an answering prayer if
[13:11] there was any time in his life that he
[13:16] was not supposed to another prayer I
[13:18] would have thought there was going to be
[13:20] the time that he was he was he was in
[13:25] the most agonizing moment of his life
[13:30] the most terrible time
[13:32] the most terrible time that time he
[13:35] foresaw and he told the Father father if
[13:37] it is possible let this cup pass away
[13:40] the most agonizing moment of his life if
[13:44] there was any time that he was supposed
[13:47] to turn down prayer or not as a prayer I
[13:50] would have thought that was going to be
[13:52] the time but that did not stop him from
[13:55] answering prayer that did not stop him
[13:59] praise be to God he said today you would
[14:03] be with me in paradise
[14:06] praise be to God now there is no special
[14:14] time for prayer there is no special time
[14:19] for prayer every prayer time is a
[14:23] special time do not wait until you are
[14:32] caught up by events do not wait until
[14:41] the store
[14:43] begin to come do not wait until life
[14:52] begins to get sour there is no special
[14:56] time for prayer every prayer time is
[15:01] special now the thief on the cross
[15:08] sometimes we think you have to pray in
[15:11] volumes one hour straight two hours
[15:16] straight three hours straight before God
[15:19] begins to hear you or before God answers
[15:21] your prayer the rare Branham talked
[15:24] about quality prayer quality prayer
[15:29] so we confer a different sheet prayer
[15:32] between quality and quality by this I am
[15:37] NOT saying that it is wrong to pray for
[15:42] an hour or two three four hours I am NOT
[15:44] saying it is wrong so that somebody can
[15:48] use that as an excuse for laziness and
[15:51] no children of God are led by the Spirit
[15:56] of God if you are being led by the
[15:58] Spirit of God to pray and pray for hours
[16:01] on end do it to the glory of God but
[16:05] what I'm trying to establish here
[16:06] sometimes God is just waiting for that
[16:10] last way to come out of your mouth that
[16:14] last word that is what God is just
[16:17] waiting to move on the same it that that
[16:23] team did not know himself he didn't know
[16:26] himself he didn't know who he was where
[16:30] he came from and why he was going he
[16:33] didn't know but a Lord Jesus Christ knew
[16:36] him but just look at this under cross he
[16:42] didn't turn to him to tell him oh you I
[16:44] know you are going to be in paradise
[16:46] with me you had told about know he
[16:47] little miniature of that it was when he
[16:52] prayed Lord remember me
[16:56] when you come in your kingdom prayer
[17:01] move mountains it was when he prayed
[17:07] when he was hanging day he was probably
[17:10] thinking of oh so finally death has
[17:13] caught up with me oh my life is wasted
[17:16] away and he was probably thinking of how
[17:20] many rooms you broke into and how many
[17:22] robberies you committed the pain he
[17:24] brought on people and how he had
[17:26] disappointed father and mother and
[17:27] disappointed the community just with
[17:30] death looking at him in the face just at
[17:34] the eleventh hour just at the eleventh
[17:38] hour when all hopes were gone he didn't
[17:41] know that next to him was eternal life
[17:44] praise be to God it took a word of
[17:48] Prayer
[17:49] Lord remember me and when you coming in
[17:52] your kingdom for birth to open his eyes
[17:58] so it is so good to pray for hours on
[18:03] end and it is ok sometimes it is it is
[18:07] probably a weight or true a weight or
[18:11] two and that is what the Lord is just
[18:14] waiting for now when he ascended into
[18:20] heaven the Bible says he is seated on
[18:22] the right hand of God the Father what is
[18:25] he doing
[18:26] interceding for us interceding he has
[18:32] not stopped praying all his life on
[18:37] earth he was praying when he was lifted
[18:40] on the earth and he will be 28 and in
[18:43] heaven praying and answering prayers and
[18:47] now in heaven still interceding for us
[18:51] praying never get tired of praying never
[18:58] get tired still interceding for us
[19:02] now I want us to take a scripture here
[19:39] you somewhere down so let's keep rolling
[19:41] we'll get there so what am I trying to
[19:47] establish air this morning
[19:57] I'm missing something here
[20:00] praise be to God
[20:11] I Tara her
[20:13] scripts are down but I think I have it
[20:16] somewhere oh good day let's keep going
[20:19] so still on a cross he is prayed and it
[20:22] has heated for us now intercessory
[20:26] prayer is a very very very important and
[20:30] we must not overlook the Bible says we
[20:36] should pray for people in authority as a
[20:41] child of God when you get up in the
[20:44] morning on a beautiful Sunday morning
[20:47] like this on your coming to church
[20:51] you ought to pray for the service you
[20:59] are to pray for the service the night
[21:03] before or probably in the course of the
[21:05] week or in the morning before you come
[21:08] to church or when you come to church you
[21:10] are to commit yourself committed service
[21:14] into the hands of God for their service
[21:17] to be a blessing to you you must pray
[21:20] for it pray for the pastor or whoever is
[21:23] going to minister the word pray pray for
[21:26] the ministry pray for the song service
[21:28] prefer I mean really did it did they
[21:32] instrument Amira Harvick on the present
[21:35] brothers and sisters on the instruments
[21:37] pray for them we are it a duty to God to
[21:47] commit the service into the hands of God
[21:53] do not take those things lightly in the
[22:01] priya is a very very important in and as
[22:06] I said before I'm saying it again that
[22:09] selfishness is not only in the physical
[22:15] sometimes we are also very very selfish
[22:21] spiritually that we pray for only
[22:26] ourselves and for only those who belong
[22:30] to us it's very difficult to just look
[22:36] at a brother or a sister and live them
[22:39] before God and keep them till you see
[22:41] God vindicate himself in the life of
[22:43] their older sister but it always has to
[22:49] be guess me or somebody close to me it
[22:54] doesn't have to be that way
[22:59] praise be to God there is something here
[23:03] I want us to look at you know as a
[23:12] Jeremiah
[23:13] one five or Jeremiah five one can we
[23:17] look at that Jeremiah I said one five I
[23:33] believe yes Jeremiah 1:5 before I found
[23:41] thee in the belly I knew thee and before
[23:45] thou camest forth out of the womb I
[23:47] sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[23:51] prophet unto the nations praise be to
[23:55] God
[23:57] now the Bible says that give son Colin
[24:00] are without repentance gifts and Colin
[24:07] are without repentance
[24:11] Jeremiah was not ordained a prophet unto
[24:14] himself he was not ordained a prophet
[24:18] unto the family he was coming from not
[24:22] on to his father not on to his mother
[24:24] but unto the nations
[24:26] so the gift of God in a man's life or
[24:30] the gift of God in a woman's life is not
[24:32] meant for that person it's meant for the
[24:36] kingdom of God now there is a way I
[24:41] bring I want us to watch this we are
[24:42] talking about what intercessory prayer
[24:45] if by the grace of God you can see the
[24:49] gift of God in a life you all got a duty
[24:54] to pray for that gift you don't owe it
[25:00] to that person as a matter of fact
[25:02] sometimes the person who has the gift
[25:05] does not even know they have a gift they
[25:10] don't know it and sometimes they even
[25:12] know it but they will know the
[25:15] importance of that gift and what happens
[25:18] is that the devil can take a hold of
[25:21] that gift and instead of that gift be
[25:24] used to the glory of God
[25:27] that devil can use that gift to his own
[25:29] glory so we are it to God not to that
[25:35] person not the family from which the
[25:37] person comes not his father
[25:39] not with my dad not to his son not his
[25:41] daughter we owe it to God to pray for
[25:45] that gift that is what intercessory
[25:53] prayer would sometimes we see the gift
[25:58] we say Oh
[25:59] his father should be praying for him or
[26:03] should be praying for him his parents
[26:05] should be praying for him oh hey I mean
[26:09] their family he comes from and know that
[26:13] gift doesn't belong to that family it
[26:15] belongs to the household of God if we
[26:19] sit down and then we just look at it and
[26:22] then something happens and the devil
[26:25] takes glory instead of the glory being
[26:26] taken by God then guess what
[26:29] we have a problem that fellow is not the
[26:34] one losing the gift it is not the family
[26:38] that is losing the gift it is the
[26:42] household of God that is losing the gift
[26:46] we owe it to God not that person we owe
[26:50] it to God not the family we owe it to
[26:53] God to pray for the sanctity of that
[26:56] gift praise be to God
[27:10] now Jesus was a gift to the world and
[27:21] when he was born that three wise men saw
[27:25] his star and the following star all the
[27:29] way till they got to Herod and when her
[27:32] head that a king was born he got
[27:39] interested not for the good reasons and
[27:42] then he asked the wise men when they saw
[27:47] the star and then he was able to narrow
[27:50] it down to the time that the child was
[27:54] born and he told the three wise men go
[27:58] and find out who he is and why he is and
[28:01] then when you are done come and tell me
[28:03] so I would also go in worship Him the
[28:06] three wise men went worship the Lord
[28:09] Jesus and a Lord warned them never to go
[28:13] back to Herod because Herod wanted to
[28:15] kill him
[28:16] so they went back using a different
[28:20] route and when Harald got to know later
[28:24] on that they mocked him he was so angry
[28:26] he just killed a children two years and
[28:30] below but before then an angel of the
[28:34] Lord appeared to Joseph say Joseph take
[28:38] that child take his mother
[28:39] you guys go to Egypt for Herod is
[28:44] seeking the life of this child what was
[28:49] God doing God was protecting his gift
[28:54] God was protecting that gift
[28:57] they went to Egypt and everything come
[29:01] back until Herod died and the end of the
[29:04] law went to Joseph that now take the
[29:08] child take his mother go back because
[29:11] Herod is dead what was God doing God was
[29:15] protecting his gift the gift of God
[29:19] might be protected
[29:22] we don't do it just because we feel like
[29:26] doing it you will do it because it's
[29:30] part of our duty it's part of our
[29:33] god-given duty to protect the gift of
[29:37] God in our midst
[29:38] if we as an assembly come together and
[29:43] we don't see the gift of God in has been
[29:46] manifested then there is a problem we
[29:51] should be happy the gift does not have
[29:55] to come from under your roof to be
[29:59] relevant it doesn't matter where the
[30:02] gift is coming from but if we can see
[30:04] the gift of God in a sister the gift of
[30:06] God in a brother we shall rally behind
[30:08] that gift pray protect that gift that
[30:13] the devil does not lay his hands on that
[30:16] gift because when the devil lays his
[30:18] hands on that gift is affecting the
[30:20] entire body praise be to God we are
[30:24] talking about intercessory prayer my
[30:26] time is up once again praise be to God
[30:29] shall we pray so I remember we need to
[30:34] intercede for one another it's not just
[30:38] enough to pray for yourself and then
[30:41] always it's just me me I I we we know
[30:46] try to lift others before God it's okay
[30:50] to lift others before God praise be to
[30:54] God you've prayed for yourself enough
[30:56] shall we pray our Lord and our master
[31:00] Jesus we're trying this oh very much for
[31:02] this opportunity once again O God we
[31:05] thank you so very much for the pieces of
