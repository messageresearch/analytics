[0:14] you don't want to do that
[0:16] Jesus taught the same thing
[0:18] when you got a talent don't hide it
[0:22] you got to put it to use
[0:24] groin
[0:26] I may be talking to Presbyterian
[0:28] Methodist Baptists in these breakfasts
[0:30] and whatever more you never know who's
[0:32] setting before you see so
[0:35] remember if you've got some investment
[0:38] something to invest in invested in
[0:41] something that's good something that's
[0:43] real something that's been proven
[0:46] that'll pay off
[0:47] some good a reliable identified firm
[0:52] that has been proven to pay off in the
[0:55] past
[0:56] it's got a name behind it
[0:59] you may know that
[1:01] even if you have to take a slower coming
[1:05] up
[1:06] your your Dividends are are smaller yet
[1:09] I'd rather know all my money I was
[1:12] drawing two percent and sure to get it
[1:14] and drawing fifty percent never get it
[1:17] promise fifty percent
[1:19] see you want to you want to stay with
[1:22] the firm or the the business that's got
[1:25] a background it's got a a name behind it
[1:28] something is going to pay off and
[1:31] something that's right
[1:33] now
[1:35] this young fella that we're speaking
[1:38] about this young businessman well he was
[1:42] he was given the opportunity
[1:45] to make an investment
[1:47] and one of the greatest
[1:50] businesses that he could invest in
[1:53] he was given the opportunity to follow
[1:56] Jesus Christ
[2:00] and
[2:02] what a ridiculous saying that he did
[2:05] what a rational thing that this young
[2:10] fella given this type of an opportunity
[2:13] to invest this is soul and his money and
[2:19] whatever he had in the kingdom of God
[2:21] and he turned it down flatly
[2:26] we look at him this morning as this
[2:28] young businessman as a as a very uh poor
[2:33] businessman
[2:35] but you couldn't have told him that
[2:36] Jesus couldn't tell him any better
[2:39] see the word of God when Jesus speaks
[2:42] it's so it's all truth it doesn't have
[2:45] to be explained
[2:47] God just speaks the truth and you don't
[2:49] have to go around like we do to them
[2:51] explain it it's that's all there is to
[2:54] it he said follow me that's all
[2:56] he didn't have to tell him why uh
[2:59] explain it all like I do and other
[3:01] people do but his words are all truth
[3:04] we don't have to go around with it
[3:07] just said he said follow me and that
[3:09] settled
[3:10] you had the invitation to make an
[3:14] investment in Jesus Christ
[3:17] and that's the person I'm speaking about
[3:19] this morning
[3:21] the investment that I want you to make
[3:24] if you haven't made it
[3:26] but the Rich Young fella the teenager of
[3:30] his day
[3:31] I had probably an aired a lot of money
[3:34] and and which that's all right there's
[3:37] nothing against that
[3:39] and uh I'll be thankful for any man or
[3:43] anybody that's been uh given that
[3:46] privilege but when the what I have
[3:48] against the fella is this
[3:51] being a man of business
[3:53] and did you notice he asked for
[3:56] eternal life
[3:58] that was his business proposition
[4:01] what must I do now to have eternal life
[4:05] and Jesus told him exactly what to do
[4:09] but he wasn't interested
[4:12] because of the thing that he had to do
[4:15] to have eternal life
[4:19] and now we look on that we Pentecost so
[4:21] people who think that man was out of his
[4:24] mind and not to do a thing but let's
[4:25] let's take it down home for a few
[4:27] minutes
[4:29] see there was something went with it he
[4:32] was asked about the Commandments
[4:34] he said this I've done sets my youth
[4:37] probably raised in a in a good Orthodox
[4:40] home where he was raised up not to steal
[4:43] her lie or cheat or commit adultery
[4:46] maybe the boy was a cheater
[4:49] the boy was a liar
[4:51] they've been raised with good parents
[4:53] somebody that taught him and there was a
[4:55] god
[4:56] and that God would bring into judgment
[4:58] someday and he'd have to give an account
[5:01] for all that he did
[5:04] and that teaching of his of his parent
[5:06] maybe it's stuck with him and he knowed
[5:09] that there was a God but now it comes a
[5:13] time where he's got to to personally
[5:16] meet this God
[5:18] he's got to meet this person
[5:21] and he was asked why he asked what could
[5:25] he do and uh to have this eternal life
[5:27] and Jesus told him what to do but he was
[5:31] not interested in that kind of
[5:33] investment because it took away the
[5:37] things that he had held so dear
[5:41] well you say that man had money
[5:44] and it was taken from him because uh the
[5:47] money rather Jesus has taken because
[5:49] that was his Earthly possessions but it
[5:52] don't all together mean money
[5:56] there's just a lot more things
[5:59] that we hold to us just as much as our
[6:02] Idol as that young man held to that
[6:04] money
[6:07] popularity
[6:09] denominational difference
[6:13] fashions
[6:15] lusts of the world
[6:17] idols
[6:20] everything there's so many things that
[6:22] that man today instead of being risk
[6:26] holding to things they of money they
[6:29] they hold to different things like that
[6:33] just as tight as that young man because
[6:36] they're not interested in the investment
[6:39] that Christ is offering them
[6:42] it might mean that Christ would call you
[6:45] out of the group that you're in
[6:48] Christ might call you out from the card
[6:51] party that you have in your church the
[6:54] bunco game the society that you belong
[6:56] to
[6:58] and if you hold to that you're you're
[7:01] just as much making a rational mistake
[7:03] as this young rich man did
[7:05] see you're holding to something more of
[7:08] a treasure than investing your life's
[7:12] journey in Jesus Christ
[7:16] now this may not have a shouting
[7:19] background to it but it's got a gospel
[7:22] background to it a word
[7:28] it's the thing that the children uh
[7:31] laugh and dance and rejoice and so forth
[7:34] but you got to know what you're doing is
[7:36] about if you don't that becomes idolatry
[7:38] to you
[7:40] just becomes Idol
[7:43] and if we look and notice it at the
[7:46] conditions that we're winding into
[7:49] it comes so sneaking it's just like a
[7:53] man a tree standing on a highway and a
[7:58] little Vine Rises up a wild Vine and
[8:01] begins to wrap around that tree the tree
[8:03] wants to grow
[8:38] now this may not have a shouting
[8:41] background to it but it's got a gospel
[8:44] background to it a word
[8:50] it's the thing that the children uh
[8:53] laugh and dance and rejoice and so forth
[8:56] but you got to know what you're doing is
[8:58] about if you don't that becomes idolatry
[9:00] to you
[9:02] just becomes Idol
[9:05] and if we look and notice it at the
[9:08] conditions that we're winding into
[9:11] it comes so sneaking it's just like a
[9:15] man a tree standing on a highway and a
[9:19] little Vine Rises up a wild Vine and
[9:23] begins to wrap around that tree the tree
[9:25] wants to grow straight
[9:27] but that vine finally gets a hold of
[9:29] that tree in such a way until it's
[9:32] forced to move the other way
[9:35] so do we get in those kind of places
[9:38] or we let other things slip in them to
[9:42] us and wind us from that real sincerity
[9:45] in the word
[9:48] uh Israel was very sincere
[9:50] and what they did
[9:52] at the beginning
[9:54] well I can imagine a Jew coming down the
[9:57] road with his sick sacrifice the best
[9:59] he's got in this herd going down to the
[10:02] the sacrifice puts his hand up on the
[10:06] animal and identifies himself with the
[10:08] Animal by placing his hand up on this
[10:10] animal
[10:11] and then the blood is shed and that Q
[10:15] goes back home just as happy as he could
[10:18] be
[10:18] because he know he had done Jehovah's
[10:21] bidding that was signed for a long time
[10:24] then after a while that same thing
[10:26] become a family tradition
[10:29] it was this sake of an animal but
[10:32] someone would perhaps say you know this
[10:34] is the new moon oh perhaps maybe yes
[10:36] I've got to offer a sacrifice when he
[10:39] took down the way the first man did but
[10:41] he he didn't have that sincerity to it
[10:44] and when he did Jehovah said the thing
[10:47] has become a stake in my nose
[10:52] and it raised a great man on the scene
[10:55] Isaiah the prophet who cried out and
[10:58] said your sacrifices your solemn Feast
[11:01] is a stink before me
[11:04] be careful Pentecost
[11:10] your sacrifices and rejoicing will
[11:12] become a stink in the nostrils of
[11:14] Jehovah
[11:17] if it is an idiot deepness of sincerity
[11:23] we we must come deadly sincere not just
[11:27] laughing and rejoicing and rallying
[11:30] around we've got to calm deeply and
[11:33] sincerely to the word of the promise
[11:35] there take a holy altar
[11:39] stay there
[11:41] until something happens so we thoroughly
[11:45] die out till we are making an investment
[11:47] in the Kingdom of God in Jesus Christ
[11:52] then we're on no matter how
[11:55] fundamentally we can be fundamental yet
[11:57] you got to come under sincerity
[11:59] now this young Jew we're just as sincere
[12:02] as he could be and what he was doing but
[12:04] when the the time come to change his
[12:08] Creed
[12:10] then that's where the turtle come
[12:13] I wonder if the same God isn't just as
[12:17] able today to rise itself in Isaiah
[12:20] rise us up somebody
[12:23] that can tell us at our solemn Feast
[12:26] becomes esteem
[12:29] we should be ready for the Rapture at
[12:31] this time of the age
[12:33] look where we're at
[12:37] something needed
[12:39] and that's back to the word
[12:42] we're promised over in Malachi that we
[12:44] would be brought back to the word the
[12:46] original faith
[12:47] and so let's remember that
[12:49] now
[12:51] but the the price that this young fellow
[12:55] was asked to pay was too great he had to
[12:58] sell out all these worldly possessions
[13:00] in order to have this eternal life
[13:09] [Music]
[13:17] thank you
