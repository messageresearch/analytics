========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] there's something in you or do you want to serve a Creed somewhere say I go to church I'm just as good as you are see if you hold an old birth rights you will never see it you can't see it but if you do hold a possession of this Birthright you can't help from seeing it amen because it's part of you and you're a part of it how could I know my other mother give me birth how could I have a father that his own blood is in me how could I organize Charles Brown for me and my father I could not do it I'm willing to stand his reproach or anything else because I am his son Hallelujah Landing the Son of God and he was the word of God how can I deny that Bible being truth that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and see in the hour that we're living in we eat our Easter in the church Direction renew a resurrection to power of pain man and women to stand out for that which is God's Vindicated word say well we have in our Youth for Christ that's all right our church is having a meeting we want to know so many members nothing against that that's all right but that's only the atmosphere that might be an old hens feathers but if you'll get in the right atmosphere there he'll hatch an eagle if you're an eagle egg and if you were for our date of God the Sid you can't help from seeing it you're coming forth in her Resurrection that's the way the Baptist is born that's why the Methodist is born in the resurrection of that day but they turned off to him instead of an eagle I said not long ago going down from Tucson I watched a very strange thing I've seen a hawk sitting on the wire down there that Hulk has long lost its identification it used to be a bird next to the eagle it could not follow the eagle no by no means nothing can fall an eagle but he was a hawk Christ is the eagle and the church should at least be a hawk they could fly higher than any other rest of verse but that Hulk has become soft it's lost his identification he sits on the telephone wires and waits for some dead rabbit amen he hops like a vulture and instead of flying like a hawk oh my brother's sister you Pentecostal people which is my own dear people the church is losing its identification it's coming down and depending on some dead formal Creed instead of flying in the Heavenly Center for precious manner a Hulk used to hunt his own manner but today he takes what the automobiles run over what the Boxers eat [Music] the hot psych one he looks like one we saw adorned ourselves in the modern world our women cutting their hair and wearing shorts are a man but not enough backbone to stand the pulpit and tell the truth we've long got soft on the word whole gods and the Holy Ghost and look out let me go somewhere that's ready to stand now no matter what takes place that'll soar into the unknown not set on the telephone wires and look for some Sunday school literature to come in let me have the word in it as precious and a power demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen we need an Easter a resurrection that's potentials my friend if you're satisfied with sets a Karen of the world there's something wrong my sister my brother let me say to you send Godly fear knowing that I may never live to see an Easter again but there's one thing sure what a genuine four deemed Son of God by the word of God hears that voice of God he'll rise and go to me to it's the potential that he's going to meet the real living word as he was the bride will meet the groom she's a part of his body notice long have we we're losing our identification we come on Wednesday night some of us others stay home to us who love Susie televisions all kinds of worldly things all kinds of entertainments to keep you away from church long have we lost it our seminaries our schools are putting out a bunch of rookies with a whole lot of Theology and entertainment and everything in the church to take the place of the prayer meeting we've talked rest and try to fulfill what the modernists try to do bring them in you will never win them but that they got more of that you have you ain't got no business on your ground on their ground let them come over on yours for their real baptism is shining further real power of the Resurrection don't try to build a church like theirs don't try to have a pastor like that don't try to do this other or cooperate with the world they shine with Hollywood the real gospel goes with power Eagles hear that they don't look for a shine they look for a goal going with humility glowing with love glowing with power that's what the real Eagle hunts you can't scratch in a barnyard and please him you'll never be able to do it you'll never touch him because he don't believe it let that voice spring from the heavens I am here that was dead or alive again amen something takes place I am the same yesterday today and forever and it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out of myself upper Halls flesh glory to God I'll Quicken your Immortal language I'll Quicken your Immortal tongues I'll give you the evidence so I'm going to bring in the resurrection with me hungry hearted Eagles reach for that just as hard as they can it's a pearl of great price if they sell everything else to go by God help us friend our churches are losing their identification that's quickly now how to go to Sun what's the action of those disciples are scared they know Jesus was the truth but you see it was against a popular idea the proper religion of the hour the most strictest religion Sarah Pharisees Sadducees no so forth they're close to Clans and denominations they were they were against that heresy but Jesus was the identified word and Jesus is the Holy Ghost and spirit amen a little while in a world see if you know more you shall see me not the body the life that was in in God it is upon the church to call Sons like he did then obedient I'll always do that which is pleasing to my Father which one of you confused me of sin in other words sin is unbelief what has the word said about me that I haven't done show me what the word said that I do it I didn't do which one can accuse me which one can lay your fingers on me and say that I haven't fulfilled my father's word or when the Pentecostal Church gets to that spot who can accuse me of unbelief oh Christians be identified not as a hawk but an eagle that Hulk is soft he'll come down you never see Eagle doing that you don't ever do that he hunts his own food out of the blue God's prepared him so he could see it he gets fresh Manna not something is dead in the Hebrews when he crossed to the Wilderness they eat try to eat dead Manna it'll become stagnant it had it had wheel tails in it you know what we mean it's a contaminated rotten maggots is in it why would I eat a food that had been dead years ago it might be in farm and shape but it isn't fresh we got to get food every generation new so does the eagle look for that food every generation as we're in our journey notice now let's take some people again let's take some of the Old Testament prophets see what they did let's look first at Stevens house Stevens in the midst of that Sanhedrin Council when that counselor brought him up there that great assembly of Believers there are supposed to be Believers brought him up and tried to condemn him why he said you stiff necks uncircumcised in the heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost that's that eternal life is your father's did it back in Earth through the prophets so are you doing it today and they messed upon him with their teeth they didn't want to hear that here's the gifts their Credence against their denomination and they stoned the man to death and he raised his hands up and look towards him and say I see Heavens open and Jesus stands the right side why he had the resurrection quickening power in him that took him into the bosoms of Jesus notice quickly now look at Philip down there in a great Revival having a Revival for it had been garrisoned for any man well if we had got a big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there is having a great Revival and the quickening power of God's Pope James said Stephen may have said this you're having a great Revival but I got one man I want you to talk to and Stephen's obedient no matter what it is how much criticism oh Stevens you can't leave but I can God said so and he went out into the desert and out there he found this eunuch and what happened he said has uh if thou Believers with all thine heart that Jesus is the son of God uh I'll baptize him when he baptized him look he was quickened by this quickening power to leave a Revival of thousands of people to go out into the desert to one man oh that'll be against all reasons see while these ten thousand won't you hear but there's one wanting out there see and the quickening power sent into God's provided place Hallelujah man and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do the things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about the neighbor said well that person's lost her mind pray all night they'll read the Bible I don't care what they say it's what God called you to do yes that's right or they say we can't have these old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals like oh yes we can too you can have it in yourself and you are the majority in God no matter what the rest of them think notice after in obedience listen close now after obeying God to his word when he fulfilled his mission that quickening power that he received at Pentecost caught him away quick in his body miles and miles away he was taken in the spirit and was found over in another country somewhere quickening power of God and if we be Pentecostals that same power that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in your mortal bodies all right notice let's take another man with his quickly power there was a man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch want a new thing come along when something come along and say well now we have go back to the old school or this side the other Enoch walk with God whatever God said dude Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was the son of God he was an eagle and been called to that day and when he come to him he was so full of that quickening power remember he'd walk 500 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything that God told him knew he went and done it no argument about it he just wasn't done it no matter what anybody else thought he went and done it why he was full of that quickening power and when it comes time for the old man to die God is sent out a letter and he walked up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture amen that's that quickly power look at Elijah after his work was finished on Earth he was so full of that quickening power he condemned them Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day he told Jesse about what he thought of her he told them preachers and Priests what was right and wrong and they didn't believe him but he condemned them painted face women and things so bad and he's so full of that quickly power to nothing could harm him God had fed him in the heavens tuck him out and set him aside and he was so full of creating power come time to Die the Jordan opened up and he just walked to sit down a chair and talking about home so full of their quickening power he become a true genuine Son of God notice he had a successor and his name was Elisha and Elisha had a double Post in this quick and Power see he had a double potion of it now he preached for about 80 years or he's about 80 years old he touched sick and die now he didn't get to go home like Elijah did see both of them is represented there in the church some Saints Go in some resting but notice when Elijah was taken up in the rapture then Elisha went to sleep and God full acquainting power look at his prophecy just before he died okay now let me show you I don't care if you're dead or where you're at that quickening power never leads years and years after his death his meaning rotted away the skin worms that heated up but they were packing a dead man one day throwed him in on that bones and there was much quickening power there actually man come back to life again Hallelujah raise him up from the dead because that quickening power that was upon that saint of God never left him stayed right on those bones all remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power at all though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God glory to God I don't know what to say not a hope for an old man like me knowing I see my end time that I understand that's 56 years old that's that's a little bitty boy I've stood here trying to Proclaim this but I know that in me nothing good that I have nothing I've done but in me is that quickening power it quickened me one day for the things of the world upon the eternal life all the things that's happened I've seen Visions foretold things he's never let nothing fail yet I spoke in other tongues I prophesied I've done those things by the spirit of God that dwelt in me that's quickly power I know that someday my redeemer is living now and it's Sunday when he comes these bones shall rise again they're going to meet him oh Hallelujah you may fear me in the sea burn it up wherever you want to that quickening power is eternal I feel Easter right now yes sir I've had it for years it's in me it's in you if you the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it's Quicken you from the things of the world to the word of God only yeah it's Quicken you from this life to life eternal you were once dead is sin and trespasses has now been quicker together to sit and play Heavenly places with Christ Jesus feasting on manna from above seeing the hand God made manifested prove the promise of this day as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they were eating drinking marrying giving and married and as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on Earth not Son of God no more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not that line not the ox and the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when it come to sacrifice our the ox went because he's a sacrifice Beast to the Lord then come the reformers down through the church Ages come the face of a man and that reformers have been sentenced Luther Wesley Hall Calvin on down down Pentecostal age but in the last message it went forth there come a flying eagle reveal time the word of God made manifest the word of God proved hold children walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart God will fill you look at here now we find now remember we are flesh of his flesh and born of his bone as God raised his bones and flesh out of the Grave they cannot find the man that has the potentials amen death cannot take him Jesus said all the father has given me will come to me how raise them up at the last day amen amen oh my Easter while we're right in Easter when he raised we raise with him he sent the abstract back we hold it as the baptism of the Holy Ghost He Is Alive forevermore the same yesterday and forever Hebrews 13 8 proves that he's the same his Messiah anointed ones believe that what is a messiah what is a messiah Messiah is Anointed one and now if he was the Messiah being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the Redeemer and the anointed one who God raised up that body his bride is the only one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one amen I wish I could tell you where I see it I wish I had the education I could do it with see I will I hope you sit I hope God the Holy Ghost comes down there and puts that in your heart to see what I mean the resurrection we are now in the resurrection we are sitting with him in the resurrection but only those who have life not those who do not have life they won't know it they'll never know it he'll go right on thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost being saved in the Rapture run me over with and gone said Elias has already come and they did that and you knew it now see notice death does not stop the quickening power of God notice death can't stop it you say well my mother was a Spirit-filled woman my daddy I never seen a man so full of power of my daddy but he died brother Branham sure that didn't stop the quickening power Moses had that quickening power you believe that there never was a man like him on the earth until Jesus for he didn't only see Visions he talked face to face with God even a prophetess Mary of disputed his word one day he said don't you fear God consider my servant Moses not nobody in the world like him this hour there's never been anybody like Moses I speak to Moses what did he ever say it wasn't truth see I speak to him or is it don't you fear God don't you say a word against him and right then she was stricken with leprosy it was dying she didn't live very long afterwards Moses prayed for her and Moses climbed up on the mountain in 120 years of ministry or 80 years of ministry 120 years of life climbed up on the mountains and died and was buried in the valley but that quickening power was on him about 800 years later here he stand on Mount Transfiguration amen what was he he was included in that Resurrection true he was he had the quickening power of God here was standing look at Joel Abraham Isaac the Saints on the day of the Resurrection that great morning at job and all of them knew that would come when he said I know my redeemer lives [Music]
