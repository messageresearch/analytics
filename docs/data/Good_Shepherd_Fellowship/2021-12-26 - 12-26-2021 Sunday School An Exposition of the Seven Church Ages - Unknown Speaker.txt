========================================

[Music] [Music] to join in the attack upon the true believers who had the word and the signs and wonders with them thus some priscillaists were brought to trees by bishop ithacas 385 he accused them of witchcraft and immorality and many were executed martin of tour and ambrose of milan protested this and pleaded in vain for the persecution to cease when the persecution was prolonged these two bishops refused to fellowship with bishop hidatas and others like him strange to say the synod in trees approved of the murders from this time on especially through the dark ages we will see the children of the flesh persecute and destroy the children of the spirit though both claim one father even as was in the case of ishmael and isaac the darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the true light of god will fade until number wise it glows ever so faintly yet the promise of god will hold true the light shineth in darkness and the darkness can do nothing about it now up to this time i have not brought out that point in history that i promised to cover that is the intermingling of the religion of nimrod and the christian religion you will recall that adolescent babylon to pergamos and set up his kingdom outside the reaches of the roman empire it flourished over the years nurtured by the god of this world a succession of priest kings followed atolus until the reign of atlas iii when for reasons known only in the sovereignty of god he willed the kingdom to rome julius caesar then took both the kingdom physical and spiritual for he became pontiff maximus of the babylonish religion and was therefore priest king this title passed on to the following emperors until the time of maximus the third who refused it according to stephen's history it was then that the pope took the headship the emperor rejected and today there is still a pontiff in the world and he is truly pontiff maximus he wears a triple crown and resides in rome and in revelation 17 god does not any longer refer to pergamus as satan's seat nor does he say that is where satan dwells no the throne room is no longer in pergamos but it is mystery babylon it is not in babylon but in mystery babylon it is in a city on seven hills its head is antichrist for he has usurped the position of christ who alone is mediator and who alone can forgive sins yes pontiff maximus is with us today the doctrine of the nicolaitans revelation 2 15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate you will recall that i brought out in the ephesian age that the word nicolaitan comes from two greek words niko which means to conquer and leo which means the laity nicolaitan means to conquer the laity now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because god has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit-filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between god and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the lord god wants all to love and serve him together nicolaitanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants now this doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age it appears that the problem lay in two words elders presbyters and overseers bishops the scripture shows that there are several elders in each church some began ignatius among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter is the word elder signifies who the person is while the word bishop signifies the office of the same man the elder is the man bishop is the office of the man elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the lord he is an elder not because he is elected or ordained etc but because he is older he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience and long-standing proof of his christian experience but no the bishops did not stick to the epistles of paul but rather they went to paul's account of the time he called the elders from ephesus to miletus in acts 20. in verse 17 the record states elders were called and then in verse 28 they are called overseers bishops and these bishops no doubt political minded and anxious for power insisted that paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local elder with official capacity only in his own church to them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders such a concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the stature of polycarp leaned towards such organization thus that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal doctrine and so it is today bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the holy ghost who said separate me paul and barnabas for the work where unto i have called them this is anti-word and anti-christ matthew 20 25-28 but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many matthew 23 8-9 but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven in order to clarify this even more let me explain nicolaitanism in this way you recall that in revelation 13 3 it says and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast now we know that the wounded head was the pagan roman empire that great political world power this head rose again as the roman catholic spiritual empire now watch this carefully what did political pagan rome do that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered that was the seed of rome divide and conquer her iron teeth tore and devoured whom she tore and devoured could not rise again as when she destroyed carthage and sowed her to salt the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same divide and conquer that is nicolaitanism and god hates it now it is a well-known historical fact that when this error crept into the church men began to vie for the office of bishop with the result that this position was being given to the more educated and materially progressive and politically minded men human knowledge and program began to take over divine wisdom's place and the holy spirit no longer controlled this was indeed a tragic evil for the bishops began to maintain that it no longer required a transparent christian character to minister either the word or the rights in the church for it was the elements and the ceremony that counted this allowed evil men seducers to ran the flock with the man-made doctrine of the elevation of bishops to a place not accorded them in scripture the next step was the handing out of graded titles that built up into a religious hierarchy for soon there were archbishops over bishops and cardinals over the archbishops and by the time of boniface the third there was a pope overall a pontiff what with the nicolaitan doctrine and the amalgamation of christianity with babylonianism the net results had to be what ezekiel saw in chapter 8 10. so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel portrayed upon the wall around revelation 18 2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornications now this nicolaitan doctrine this rule that was established in the church did not hit it off too well with the lord of the people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the word written by some godly person so what did the church do it excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the scrolls they said it takes a special education to read and understand the word why even peter said that many things paul wrote were hard to understand having taken away the word from the people it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say and doing what he told them they called that god and his holy word they took over the minds and lives of the people and made them the servants of a despotic priesthood now if you want proof that the catholic church demands the lives and minds of men just listen to the edict of theodosius the tenth theodosia's first edict this edict was issued immediately after he was baptized by the first church of rome we three emperors will that our subjects steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by saint peter to the romans which has been faithfully preserved by tradition and which is now professed by the pontiff damasis of rome and peter bishop of alexandria a man of apostolic holiness according to the institution of the apostles and the doctrine of the gospel let us believe in one god head of the father the son and the holy spirit of equal majesty in the holy trinity we order that the adherents of this faith be called catholic christians we brand all the senseless followers of the other religions with the infamous name of heretics and forbid their conventionals assuming the name of churches besides the condemnation of divine justice they must expect the heavy penalty which our authority guided by heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict the 15 penal laws that this emperor issued in as many years deprived the evangelicals of all rights to the exercise of their religion excluded them from all civil offices and threatened them with fines confiscation banishment and even in some cases death do you know what we are headed right that way today the roman catholic church calls herself the mother church she calls herself the first or original church that is absolutely correct she was the original first church of rome that backslid and went into sin she was the first that organized in her was found the deeds and then the doctrine of nicolaitanism no one will deny that she is a mother she is a mother and has produced daughters now a daughter comes out of a woman a woman robed in scarlet is sitting on the seven hills of rome she is a harlot and has borne daughters those daughters are the protestant churches that came out of her and then went right back into organization and nicolaitanism this mother of the daughter churches is called a that is a woman who was untrue to her marriage vows she was married to god and then went off fornicating with the devil and in her fornications she has brought forth daughters that are just like her this mother and daughter combination is anti-word anti-spirit and consequently anti-christ yes anti-christ now before i get too far along i want to mention that these early bishops thought that they were above the word they told people they could forgive their sins upon confession of those sins that never was the truth they began to baptize infants in the second century they actually practiced regenerational baptism no wonder people are mixed up today if they were so mixed up then so close to pentecost now they are in a most desperate condition being about two thousand years away from original truth oh church of god there is only one hope get back to the word and stay with it the doctrine of balaam revelation 2 14 thou hast them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication now you just can't have a nicolaitan set up in the church and not have this other doctrine come in too you see if you take away the word of god and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells balaamism if we are going to understand what the doctrine of balaam is in the new testament church we had better go back and see what it was in the old testament church and apply it to that third age and then bring it up to the present the story is found in numbers chapters 22-25 now we know that israel was the chosen people of god they were the pentecostals of their day they had taken refuge under the blood they had all been baptized in the red sea and they came up out of the water singing in this spirit and dancing under the energy of the holy ghost while miriam the prophetess played her tambourine well after a certain time of journeying these children of israel came to moab you remember who moab was he was the son of lot by one of his own daughters and lot in turn was a nephew of abraham so israel and moab were related i want you to see that the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not so israel came up to the borders of moab and sent messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people or our animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for it but king balak got very excited that head of that nicolaitan bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the holy ghost with their faces shining with the glory of god it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd so balak refused to let israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to an hireling prophet called balaam and asked him to mediate between him and god and petition the almighty to curse israel and render them impotent and balaam being eager to take part in political affairs and become a great man was only too glad to do so but seeing that he had to approach to and receive an audience from god to get the people cursed as he could not do it by himself he went to ask god if he could have his permission to go now isn't that just like the nicolaitans we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way when balaam asked god for permission to go god turned him down my that stung but balak insisted promising him even greater rewards and honor so balaam went back to god now one answer from god should have been enough but not for self-willed balaam when god saw his perversity he told him to get up and go quickly he settled the donkey and the way he went he should have realized that this was simply god's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to curse them if he went 20 times and tried 20 times how like balaam are people today they believe in three gods get baptized in three titles instead of the name and yet god will send the spirit upon them as he did upon balaam and they will go on believing that they are exactly right and here they are actually perfect balaamites see the doctrine of balaam go ahead anyway do it your way they say well god has blessed us it must be all right i know he has blessed you i don't deny that but it's the same organizational route that balaam took its defiance to god's word it's false teaching so balaam went wildly down the road until an angel from god stood in his way but that prophet bishop cardinal chairman president and general overseer was so blinded to spiritual things by the thought of honor and glory and money that he could not see the angel standing withdrawn sword there he stood to block the mad prophet the little donkey saw him and dodged back and forth until he finally crushed balaam's foot against a stone wall the ass stopped and would not go on he could not so balaam jumped off and began beating him the donkey then began to talk to balaam god let that donkey speak in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid he was original seed he said to the blinded prophet am i not your donkey and haven't i carried you faithfully balaam replied yes yes you are my donkey and you have carried me faithfully until now and if i can't get you going i'm going to kill you whoa what's this talking to a donkey that's funny i thought i heard the donkey talking and i was answering it back god has always spoken in a tongue he spoke at belshazzar's feast and then at pentecost he is doing it again today it's a warning of soon coming judgment then the angel was made visible to balaam he told balaam that except for the donkey he would be dead even now for tempting god but when balaam promised to go back he was sent on with the admonition to say only what god gave him so balaam went down and set up seven altars for the clean beasts of sacrifice he killed a ram signifying the coming of the messiah he knew what to do to approach unto god he had the mechanics just right but not the dynamics same as now can't you see it nicolaitans there was israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same things but only one had the signs following only one had god in their midst form won't get you anywhere it can't take the place of spirit manifestation that is what happened at nicaea they put over balaam's doctrine not the doctrine of god and they stumbled yay they fell they became dead men after the sacrifice was made balaam was ready to prophesy but god tied his tongue up and he could not curse them he blessed them balak was very angry but there was nothing that balaam could do about the prophecy it had been spoken by the holy ghost so balak told balaam to go down below into the valley and look upon their back parts to see if there wasn't possibly some way he could curse them the tactics that balak used are the same tactics they use today the big denominations look down at the little groups and anything they find amongst them to make out a scandal they bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin no one says anything about it but let one of the elect get into trouble and every paper blasts it across the country yes israel had her back carnal parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of god that works through election by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night they had the smitten rock the brazen serpent and the signs and wonders they were vindicated not in themselves but in god god didn't have any respect for those nicolaitans with their phds llds and dds and all their fine organizations and the best that man could boast but he did have respect unto israel for they had the word vindicated amongst them certainly israel didn't look too polished up just having come out of egypt in precipitous flight but she was a blessed people anyway all she had ever known for over 300 years was hurting flocks tending fields and slaving away in fear of death under the egyptians but she was free now she was a blessed people through the sovereignty of god certainly moab looked down on her all the other nations did too organization always looks down on the unorganized and either will by determination bring them into organization or destroy them when they won't come now someone might ask me brother branham what makes you think that moab was organized while israel was not where do you get that idea i get it right here in the bible it is all typed out here everything written in the old testament that is in story form is written for our admonition so that we can learn from it here it is right in numbers 23 9. from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him though the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations there it is god looking down from the top of the rocks not in some valley looking for their bad points and condemning them god seeing them the way he wanted to see them from the height of love and mercy they dwelt alone and they weren't organized they didn't have a king they had a prophet and the prophet had god in him by the spirit and the word came to the prophet and the word went to the people they didn't belong to the u n they didn't belong to the world council of churches to the baptists presbyterians assembly of god or any other group they didn't need to belong they were joined to god they didn't need counsel from any council they had thus saith the lord in their midst hallelujah now in spite of the fact that balaam knew the proper approach to god and could bring forth a revelation from the lord by means of a special endowment of power he was still for all of that a bishop in the false group for what did he do now in order to win favor with balak he formulated a plan wherein god would be forced to deal with israel in death just as satan knew that he could beguile eve cause her to fall in fleshly sin thus causing god to pass his pronounced sentence of death against sin so balaam knew that if he could get israel to sin god would have to deal with them in death so he planned a way to get them to come over and join in sin he sent out invitations to come to the feast of baal pior come over and worship with us now israel no doubt had seen the feasts of the egyptians so they did not feel it was too wrong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people what is wrong with fellowship anyway we are supposed to love them aren't we or how can we win them being friendly never hurt anyone or so they thought but when those sexy moabitish women began to dance and undress while they whirled around doing their rock and roll and twist the lust rose up in the israelites and they were drawn into adultery and god in wrath slew forty two thousand of them and that is what constantine and his successors did at nicaea and after nicaea they invited the people of god to the convention and when the church sat down to eat and rose up to play partaking of church form ceremonies and pagan feasts named after christian rites she was trapped she had committed fornication and god walked out when any man turns from the word of god and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he is don't join a church don't get into organization and get taken up with creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from god that is what has happened in every age since god delivers the people they come out by the blood sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit but after a while the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back in the second generation and sometimes even before then they no longer have the spirit of god just a form of worship they are dead they have hybridized themselves with creed and form and there is no life in them so balaam got israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion i said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire that is what god thinks of organization yes sir the and her daughters will be in the lake of fire denominations are not of god they never have been and never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of god into hierarchy and laity and it's therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people that's what organization and denominations do in organizing they separate themselves from the word of god and bring themselves into spiritual adultery now notice that constantine gave special feasts unto the people they were the old pagan feasts with new names taken from the church or in some cases christian rites were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the sun god and changed it to the son of god instead of celebrating on december 21st which is when they used to celebrate the feast to the sun god they put it up to december 25th and called it the son of god's birthday but we know that he was born in april when life comes forth not in december and they took the feast to astarte and called it the easter celebration wherein the christian is supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection of the lord actually it was a pagan feast to astarte they placed altars in the church they put in images they gave the people what they called the apostles creed though you can't find it in the bible they taught the people ancestor worship thereby making the roman catholic church the greatest spiritistic church in the world every foul bird was in that cage and you have the protestants with their organizations doing the same thing they ate things sacrificed to idols now i don't say that this really means they were literally eating meat sacrificed to idols for though the council of jerusalem had spoken against such paul did not make much of it as he said the idols were nothing it was just a matter of conscience except where it offended a weaker brother and then it was not allowed furthermore this revelation has to do with gentiles and not jews as these are gentile churches i see this in the same light i see the words of the lord except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god you can see that eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense so when these people were bowing to the images lighting candles using pagan holidays confessing their sins to men all of which belongs to the devil's religion they were partakers with the devil and not of the lord they were in idolatry whether they admitted it or not they can talk all they want that the altars and the incense are only to remind them of the prayers of the lord or whatever they think it means and they can say that when they pray before the image it is just for the sake of emphasis and that when they confess to the priest it is really to god they are doing it in their hearts and when they say the priest forgives them it is just that he is doing it in the name of the lord they can say what they want but they are partaking in the well-known babylonian satanic religion and have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication which means death they are dead so the church and the state were married the church joined up with idols with the power of the state behind them they felt that now the kingdom had come and god's will had been enforced upon the earth no wonder the roman catholic church is not looking for the return of the lord jesus they are not millennialists they have their millennium right here the pope is reigning right now and god is reigning in him so when he comes according to them it has to be when the new heavens and the earth are prepared but they are wrong that pope is the head of the false church and there is going to be a millennium but while that is going on he won't be in it he will be somewhere else the warning revelation 2 16 repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth what else can he say can god overlook the sin of those who have borne his name in vain there is only one way to receive grace in the hour of sin repent confess you are wrong come to god for forgiveness and for the spirit of god this is a command from god to disobey is death for he says i will make war with you with the sword in my mouth the beast made war with the saints but god will make war with the beast those who fought the word will one day find the word fighting them it is a serious thing to take from or add to the word of god for those who changed it and did with it as it suited them what will their end be but death and destruction but still the grace of god cries out repent oh how sweet are the thoughts of repentance nothing in my hands i bring simply to thy cross i cling i bring my sorrow i repent that i am what i am and what i have done now it is the blood nothing but the blood of jesus what will it be repentance or the sword of death it's up to you [Music] you
