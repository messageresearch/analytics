[45:33] and
[45:33] [Music]
[45:35] praise the lord
[45:38] sister miracle center sent us a prayer
[45:40] request this morning to pray for her
[45:42] homeland
[45:44] beginning there is a little bit of
[45:46] unrest there
[45:47] and uh
[45:49] which of course affect the entire
[45:52] west coast of africa so
[45:54] we want to keep the people in the
[45:56] republic of gaining in prayer
[45:58] that the grace of god will
[46:03] guide him and protect him
[46:05] praise the lord
[46:07] amen
[46:17] for a while now we've been dwelling
[46:20] in uh
[46:21] on the bulk of uh
[46:24] uh
[46:25] obi dies
[46:26] we've been reading on the prophecy of
[46:29] obedience one chapter
[46:31] and but i want us to read this morning
[46:33] from jeremiah chapter 49
[46:37] jeremiah 49
[46:40] the only reason why i want for us to
[46:42] read there because
[46:44] as we read it you will see that
[46:46] it paraphrased exactly the prophecy of
[46:49] obi dies that we've been reading
[46:51] so uh
[46:52] uh let's let's go back to it and and
[46:55] then we
[46:56] we will be able to do a little review
[46:58] this morning
[47:00] and uh and then trust that the holy
[47:02] spirit will be able to pick up the
[47:04] context and speak to us this morning
[47:06] praise the lord
[47:09] jeremiah
[47:10] chapter 49.
[47:27] let's read from verse 14.
[47:30] jeremiah 49 reading from verse 14.
[47:55] if we would just draw back a little bit
[47:57] of verse 13 it will give us an idea yet
[48:00] as we go along for i have sown
[48:02] by myself said the lord
[48:05] that basra shall become a desolation a
[48:09] reproach a waste place that curse
[48:11] and all the cities thereof shall be
[48:14] perpetually waste
[48:17] i have heard a roman from the lord
[48:20] and an ambassador is sent unto the head
[48:23] and saying
[48:25] gather here together and come to and
[48:28] come against her and rise up
[48:31] to the battle for lord i will make thee
[48:35] small among the headings and despise
[48:38] among
[48:39] men
[48:41] praise the lord
[48:44] that terribleness
[48:46] have deceived thee and that and the
[48:49] pride of that heart
[48:51] all thou that dwellers in the cliff of
[48:53] the rock that hold the height of the
[48:56] hills
[48:57] though thou should make their nets
[49:00] as high as the ego i will bring thee
[49:03] down
[49:04] from him said the lord
[49:06] also edom shall be a desolation everyone
[49:10] that goeth by it shall be astonished and
[49:13] shall haste
[49:15] at all the plague thereof
[49:19] let us pray father
[49:21] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[49:24] are approaching your sacred word
[49:27] father that we believe no man has the
[49:29] right
[49:31] to interpret this word
[49:33] office of their own intellect lord
[49:36] father because man of all
[49:38] by inspiration wrote this word it takes
[49:42] the same inspiration of the holy spirit
[49:44] to bring a context out of faith
[49:47] dear lord we are needed people
[49:49] and lord i will most need that we have
[49:53] we need you
[49:54] so we pray this morning lord come take
[49:56] your word break into our hearts of god
[50:00] father we ask that lord things will be
[50:03] said of internal value this morning
[50:05] maybe we might leave the 99 and just go
[50:08] after one
[50:10] if it is your will let it be done father
[50:13] oh god it would be a great thing father
[50:15] lord that in 99 will you we unite their
[50:18] faith lord when they see that one is
[50:20] being gone after
[50:22] may we now sit in the seat of this
[50:24] comfort this morning may we not sit in
[50:26] the seat of no at all
[50:28] but may we pour our house to you lord
[50:31] and just humble ourselves before you
[50:33] because what almighty god you are
[50:36] you know our uprising you know our down
[50:39] setting there is nothing of our life
[50:41] that is hidden from you
[50:43] for paul said always of a man is naked
[50:45] in your eyes and here we come this
[50:48] morning just as i am like the songwriter
[50:50] said without no play the blood is my
[50:53] only play
[50:54] i asked this morning father but we find
[50:57] grace in your sight this morning
[50:59] oh god may we be a privileged people
[51:02] to say he spoke to my heart
[51:04] not the preacher the lord spoke to my
[51:07] heart
[51:08] father that's our prayer this morning
[51:10] come now father
[51:13] and glorify yourself in jesus name we
[51:15] pray
[51:16] amen
[51:17] amen
[51:19] praise the lord the lord bless you you
[51:20] may have your seat amen
[51:23] amen
[51:26] we started speaking
[51:28] uh if this is not close to a month now
[51:30] uh we're getting close
[51:32] but we we've been speaking on
[51:36] on edom
[51:38] the prophecy
[51:40] that
[51:41] derived from esau and jacob
[51:43] now you see that's the reason why i
[51:45] asked
[51:46] brother jordan and his
[51:48] staff for them to change what we were
[51:50] playing for sunday school
[51:52] in the church age book but i asked them
[51:54] to change it this morning
[51:56] and played a portion of that message
[51:59] hearing recognizing and acting upon the
[52:01] word
[52:02] and uh because that's what i want to
[52:04] draw my inspiration from to to speak to
[52:07] you this morning
[52:09] so uh uh but we will do a little review
[52:12] here like we said
[52:15] and
[52:16] when we read the scripture this morning
[52:20] it was uh
[52:24] but brandon read from romans
[52:27] and that if you go back to romans
[52:30] where paul was talking about
[52:34] israel he was approaching the subject of
[52:36] election
[52:37] and he was talking about uh easter and
[52:40] jacob
[52:41] and uh
[52:44] let's go back there a little bit in
[52:46] romans chapter eight
[52:52] that's romans chapter nine
[53:16] romans chapter 9 we read from verse 6
[53:18] coming down not as though the word of
[53:21] god has taken
[53:22] non-effect
[53:24] for they
[53:25] are not all israel which are of israel
[53:29] neither because they are the seed of
[53:32] abraham
[53:33] are they all children
[53:36] but in isaac
[53:38] shall that seed be called
[53:40] now we talk about all the children of of
[53:43] of abraham like i said in our review
[53:45] here we we spoke a little bit about
[53:47] abraham having having
[53:51] sarah
[53:52] uh
[53:54] his wife that was giving the promise by
[53:56] whom he would become the father of many
[53:58] nations but we know heger was introduced
[54:01] praise the lord hagar was
[54:04] grafted into the program and out of haga
[54:07] came ishmael and ishmael to our sons and
[54:11] then after abraham isaac
[54:14] that was not the only son
[54:16] in ishmael that abraham had when sarah
[54:19] died
[54:20] abraham married keturah and he had
[54:24] another psalms with keturah praise the
[54:27] lord so paul yet addressing their
[54:30] subject is saying that
[54:32] neither because they are seed of abraham
[54:36] from hager or
[54:38] from keturah
[54:40] neither because they are seed of abraham
[54:44] they are children
[54:47] but in isaac
[54:49] shall that see be called
[54:51] that is
[54:52] they which are the children of the flesh
[54:56] these are not the children of god
[54:59] but the children of the promise
[55:01] accounted
[55:03] for seed
[55:05] praise the lord
[55:06] spoken word is the original seed
[55:10] god's principle from the beginning
[55:12] before he started creating everything
[55:15] he took everything that he created into
[55:18] a sea form
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:24] before god made the trees
[55:27] he started in a sea form
[55:34] so
[55:35] uh the the uh
[55:38] the sea the power of the sea
[55:41] can now be
[55:44] unestimated
[55:49] with god will deal with you he have to
[55:52] start dealing with you in sea form
[55:55] amen
[55:58] praise the lord
[56:01] let's not miss that principle
[56:07] there is a flesh form
[56:09] and
[56:11] verse 8
[56:13] that is they which are
[56:15] the children of the flesh
[56:17] they are now children
[56:20] uh of god but the children of the
[56:23] promise are counted for seed
[56:26] for this is the word of promise
[56:29] at this time i will come
[56:32] and sarah shall have a son
[56:36] praise the lord
[56:38] amen
[56:40] now so what paul is saying here is that
[56:43] abraham waited for this promise
[56:46] for 25 years until elohim show on the
[56:49] scene and spoke a word amen
[56:53] it was that spoken word that created a
[56:57] seed in syria
[57:00] are we together are you seeing the
[57:02] principle
[57:04] so it is not how long you've been around
[57:07] or how long you've been in the church is
[57:09] the
[57:10] the grace of receiving the spoken word
[57:17] are we together
[57:22] for this is the word of promise
[57:25] at this time
[57:26] will i come and sarah shah
[57:29] have a son
[57:31] and not only this
[57:34] but when rebecca also had conceived
[57:38] by one
[57:39] even by our father isaac
[57:43] for the children
[57:46] being
[57:47] not yet born
[57:49] neither having done any good or evil
[57:54] that the purpose of god are calling to
[57:58] election
[58:00] praise the lord
[58:02] that the purpose of god are calling to
[58:04] election the purpose of god that can
[58:07] never fail
[58:09] the purpose of god that can never be
[58:11] defeated
[58:13] the purpose of god that nothing in time
[58:15] can affect
[58:17] praise the lord
[58:18] john was put on the island of patmos and
[58:22] he was poured into a boiling oil
[58:25] the purpose of god could not burn him
[58:28] kept him safe
[58:30] shadrach meshach and abednego was put
[58:32] into a phonics of fire heated seven
[58:35] times the purpose of god could never be
[58:37] burned
[58:39] daniel was put into the lion then the
[58:41] purpose of god can never be eaten
[58:44] the purpose of god can never be defeated
[58:51] praise the lord
[58:53] and i believe that the purpose of god in
[58:55] this coronavirus still will never be
[58:57] defeated
[58:59] i believe that god is going to use this
[59:01] to draw his children closer to him the
[59:04] shock is going to fall away then the
[59:06] seed will comes to maturity
[59:15] for the children being not yet born
[59:17] neither having done any good or evil
[59:20] that the purpose of god i call into
[59:22] election must stand
[59:25] not of works
[59:28] not of works
[59:30] but of him that calleth
[59:33] and the one that calleth is almighty god
[59:38] praise the lord
[59:41] it was said unto her
[59:44] the other shall save the younger
[59:47] as it is written
[59:49] jacob
[59:50] have i love
[59:52] but either have i hated
[59:56] what shall we say then is there
[59:58] unrighteousness with god god forbid
[1:00:02] praise the lord
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] so we we look at this we have gone
[1:00:07] through this like i said i'm doing a
[1:00:09] review this morning but when we look at
[1:00:11] this and uh uh
[1:00:14] narrowing it down to
[1:00:16] to uh esa and jacob we realized that
[1:00:20] paul had two part of the word
[1:00:23] he heard what the angel told rebecca in
[1:00:26] genesis and he also hear what malachi
[1:00:30] say in malachi chapter 1
[1:00:34] because at the birth of the children
[1:00:37] there is nowhere that is written either
[1:00:39] allah or jacob ahead
[1:00:42] it is not ready the angel only told
[1:00:45] rebecca
[1:00:46] that
[1:00:48] the other will save the younger
[1:00:51] praise the lord
[1:00:55] but then we will realize that right down
[1:00:58] through time it would come to the
[1:01:00] prophet malachite in malachi chapter 1
[1:01:03] where malachi was trying to show israel
[1:01:07] the love of god
[1:01:10] praise the lord
[1:01:11] the love of god
[1:01:13] which of course is a love that
[1:01:16] you and myself
[1:01:18] cannot understand
[1:01:22] we cannot understand it we cannot fart
[1:01:24] on the love of god
[1:01:30] are we together amen
[1:01:33] so malachi trying to tell the children
[1:01:36] of israel about how god loved them
[1:01:39] because he's bringing them to a place
[1:01:42] you know these people have gone through
[1:01:43] a lot of things in their lives and and
[1:01:46] and and you know there's questioning
[1:01:49] you know how can i be a child of god and
[1:01:52] be going through these things in my life
[1:01:54] you know how how can it be you know
[1:01:57] is is is god ever asleep
[1:02:00] you know and and and malachite is trying
[1:02:03] to help them to see there so then he
[1:02:06] brings out this story about esau and
[1:02:09] jacob as it is written in the lord uh
[1:02:11] jacob i love he says was not easier than
[1:02:15] jacob brothers but yet god said jacob i
[1:02:18] love and esau ahead so
[1:02:20] so the apostle paul here now is taking
[1:02:23] both revelation and malachi to be able
[1:02:25] to address this subject of election
[1:02:29] praise the lord
[1:02:30] because you see the subject of election
[1:02:34] our call and our election is not only
[1:02:37] when we show up in church
[1:02:42] praise the lord
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] our quarter in election it's now when we
[1:02:48] show up that's the reason why we don't
[1:02:49] have no roster yet to call names for you
[1:02:51] to stay present
[1:02:54] the roll call will be done someday
[1:02:56] but now from the back of this pulpit
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:00] amen and i i prayed and hoped that when
[1:03:04] the royal court is done you show up amen
[1:03:06] because i will be there watching amen
[1:03:12] praise the lord
[1:03:14] amen amen
[1:03:17] praise the lord so uh
[1:03:20] you know so that the the subject about
[1:03:22] election and calling and and all of that
[1:03:26] you see this is a subject just like god
[1:03:28] knows the the the end from the beginning
[1:03:31] okay it's a subject that also runs from
[1:03:34] the from the from the beginning to the
[1:03:36] end
[1:03:37] now so uh uh these ones that god has
[1:03:42] elected called elected and predestinated
[1:03:45] he have already seen them
[1:03:47] in glory
[1:03:49] because paul said yet in romans chapter
[1:03:51] chapter 8 him that god has called he has
[1:03:55] justified and then that he has justified
[1:03:58] has already been glorified
[1:04:03] praise the lord
[1:04:05] you know so so god has he have seen us
[1:04:08] true
[1:04:10] that's why he's not nervous
[1:04:13] the god we serve is not a nervous god
[1:04:16] he's a god that is fully under control
[1:04:20] praise the lord
[1:04:22] the only thing there he does not sleep
[1:04:24] or as he will have just gone to sleep
[1:04:27] because he has everything under control
[1:04:30] but he do not sleep
[1:04:32] and he don't slumber
[1:04:34] praise the lord
[1:04:36] now so we see this here
[1:04:39] and and paul is addressing this let's
[1:04:41] let's uh let we will come back to this a
[1:04:44] little bit let's uh re-yell it a little
[1:04:46] bit let's study together and uh uh we
[1:04:50] look in our notes here i have something
[1:04:52] on the laodicea church age
[1:04:54] that talks about
[1:04:57] examining the love of god
[1:05:04] let us examine the first phrase
[1:05:06] this is actually from revelation
[1:05:08] chapter 3.
[1:05:10] that's exactly the first phrase as many
[1:05:12] as i love
[1:05:14] in the greek
[1:05:16] the emphasis is upon the personal
[1:05:19] pronoun ah
[1:05:22] as many as i love not as many that love
[1:05:25] me
[1:05:28] because your love for god will fail with
[1:05:30] circumstances
[1:05:33] but god love for you will never fail
[1:05:39] are we together
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:46] jesus said because iniquity shall abound
[1:05:49] the love of many
[1:05:52] or what's called
[1:05:54] so circumstances can affect our love
[1:06:03] no wonder after the flood of noah god
[1:06:05] saves both winter summer
[1:06:07] uh uh uh seeding time and uh
[1:06:11] dry time and everything he says it will
[1:06:13] it will never stop it will keep coming
[1:06:15] because that's what that's one of the
[1:06:18] elements of time you have to remember
[1:06:20] one of the element of time is change
[1:06:27] one of the elements of time is change
[1:06:32] if nothing around you can tell you
[1:06:36] look at your age
[1:06:40] look at your strength
[1:06:43] praise the
[1:06:44] lord amen
[1:06:47] so there is one thing that that time
[1:06:49] brings
[1:06:50] it brings change
[1:06:52] and as long as we stay in time there
[1:06:56] will be changes
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:02] so circumstances can affect our love but
[1:07:06] god he's not a god of time
[1:07:10] amen he's an intent of god
[1:07:13] and eternity is constant
[1:07:19] as many as i love
[1:07:22] the greek emphasis is upon the personal
[1:07:25] pronoun i
[1:07:26] he does not say that as many
[1:07:29] who feel
[1:07:30] he
[1:07:32] as as many who feel he should say it as
[1:07:36] many
[1:07:37] as love me no sir we must never
[1:07:42] try to make
[1:07:44] jesus
[1:07:46] the object
[1:07:48] of human love
[1:07:52] praise the lord
[1:07:54] we must never make jesus
[1:07:57] the object
[1:07:59] of human
[1:08:01] love
[1:08:02] in another way to help us understand
[1:08:05] this that's what brother branham said
[1:08:07] jesus never died on the cross that we
[1:08:10] would feel sorry for him
[1:08:12] and save god
[1:08:14] he said oh my goodness he had to be oh
[1:08:16] man lord jesus oh man i need to give my
[1:08:18] life to god
[1:08:20] no
[1:08:22] isaiah chapter 53 say a please god
[1:08:26] a please god
[1:08:32] whatever places you you have no regrets
[1:08:38] a please god
[1:08:41] that he must be stricken
[1:08:47] we should never try to make jesus the
[1:08:50] object of human love
[1:08:53] in this verse
[1:08:54] no
[1:08:56] it is
[1:08:57] the many
[1:09:00] that are
[1:09:01] the loved ones of god
[1:09:05] it is his love in question
[1:09:08] not our love
[1:09:12] it is his love in question
[1:09:15] not our love
[1:09:17] you see when when the word of god is
[1:09:19] challenged when the message of the hour
[1:09:21] is challenged and and and and we want to
[1:09:24] come on the scene you know and and you
[1:09:26] know i'll prove to you that this is the
[1:09:28] word of god you can defend god's word
[1:09:36] god is more than able amen
[1:09:40] amen see shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:09:42] he says our god will deliver us but even
[1:09:45] if he if he does not
[1:09:50] you see because if you stick to that
[1:09:52] place that god that herself he's going
[1:09:55] to he's going to show you
[1:09:59] praise the lord
[1:10:00] and you have to realize that
[1:10:03] god weighed every element
[1:10:07] of your body
[1:10:12] you might be talking the god that
[1:10:14] herself he's almighty god he will show
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:19] and in all that confession
[1:10:22] when god put it on the scale he could
[1:10:23] see a little proud in it
[1:10:26] and say i'm not going to associate with
[1:10:28] that because my glory i would give to no
[1:10:31] man
[1:10:37] praise the lord
[1:10:40] and then god doesn't show
[1:10:42] up oh my god
[1:10:45] the bowers i don't even believe this
[1:10:47] bible i've got a church again
[1:10:52] that's just what was in you
[1:10:55] that's all that was in you
[1:11:01] and you wanted to associate god
[1:11:06] with that
[1:11:12] are we together
[1:11:16] praise the lord
[1:11:22] it is the many that are the loved ones
[1:11:24] of god it is his love in question not
[1:11:28] ours
[1:11:30] so once again we find ourselves
[1:11:34] glorying in his salvation his purpose
[1:11:37] his
[1:11:39] and
[1:11:41] we are we are confirmed
[1:11:45] even more strongly in the truth
[1:11:49] of the doctrine
[1:11:51] of the sovereignty of god amen
[1:11:57] even as he said in romans 9 13
[1:12:00] jacob have our love
[1:12:05] they'll say now obtain
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:08] since he loves only
[1:12:11] the meaning
[1:12:13] is he therefore
[1:12:15] in a state of
[1:12:18] complacency
[1:12:20] awaiting the love of those who
[1:12:23] have not drawn nigh to him
[1:12:25] by no means is the soul
[1:12:29] for he declared also in romans 9 13
[1:12:33] easter
[1:12:34] have i hate it
[1:12:36] praise the lord
[1:12:39] this is a very big uh controversial uh
[1:12:43] verse in the bible for the atheists
[1:12:46] you know and
[1:12:47] and you know in in the many of them that
[1:12:50] are struggling with biblical truth
[1:12:54] praise the lord
[1:12:56] you know you see it i was thinking about
[1:12:57] this the other day you know when people
[1:13:01] argued about whether god is real or ned
[1:13:04] you know and uh
[1:13:06] it's it's just as simple
[1:13:09] as
[1:13:10] you know me telling you about your
[1:13:12] father
[1:13:14] there is no way i can do it
[1:13:19] i might think i have an idea about your
[1:13:21] father but i can tell you about your
[1:13:23] father
[1:13:28] from the outside i might be looking at
[1:13:30] him in all my knowledge and thought
[1:13:33] would be what i know from the outside
[1:13:35] but you are the one that is in
[1:13:37] relationship with him
[1:13:43] praise the lord
[1:13:50] so young people if anybody want to
[1:13:51] bother you about what a god being real
[1:13:55] you should just ask them
[1:13:57] you know that question
[1:14:02] are we together amen
[1:14:05] now so we read down here either half i
[1:14:08] ate it hate it
[1:14:11] and in verse 11 the spirit bowling call
[1:14:14] out for the children
[1:14:16] not being born neither having done any
[1:14:19] good or evil
[1:14:21] that the purpose of god according to
[1:14:24] election might stand you see that is the
[1:14:27] major thing
[1:14:29] in this whole thing that we are reading
[1:14:33] the purpose of god
[1:14:36] the purpose
[1:14:38] of god
[1:14:42] his determined counsel
[1:14:48] shall always stand
[1:14:53] praise the lord
[1:14:58] not of works
[1:14:59] but of him that calleth
[1:15:01] this love is elective love
[1:15:08] it is his love for his elect
[1:15:13] it is his law for them
[1:15:17] for his law for them is a part
[1:15:23] from human merit
[1:15:26] for it says that the purpose of god
[1:15:29] staying in election
[1:15:31] which is exactly opposite to work or
[1:15:34] anything
[1:15:36] man has in himself
[1:15:40] because before the children were born
[1:15:44] he has already said jacob i love and
[1:15:47] easily i hate let me let me just stick
[1:15:49] on this a little bit
[1:15:51] because that's the next session i was
[1:15:52] going to
[1:15:54] and and and for us to be able to look at
[1:15:57] some things here
[1:15:59] let's look at this
[1:16:01] famous uh statement
[1:16:04] that came out of uh
[1:16:07] uh
[1:16:12] praise the lord
[1:16:15] are we together
[1:16:17] let me find myself here the little bit
[1:16:19] here
[1:16:26] we'll come back to there but let's look
[1:16:27] at this uh behold a greater than solomon
[1:16:30] is here we all know this we have heard
[1:16:32] it before a pardon
[1:16:34] is not a pardon
[1:16:36] unless it has
[1:16:39] been accepted as a pattern
[1:16:42] praise the lord
[1:16:44] now
[1:16:46] for us to understand this is for us to
[1:16:48] be able to appreciate
[1:16:51] god's on rating laws
[1:16:55] there is an unwritten lord of god that
[1:16:58] is in nature
[1:17:01] the lord of reproduction is anonymity
[1:17:03] lord
[1:17:05] what you saw
[1:17:06] is what you will reap
[1:17:09] praise the lord
[1:17:11] and as much as thy lord is truth
[1:17:14] it is also the lord of contracts
[1:17:17] is also truth
[1:17:22] understanding the lord of contracts will
[1:17:24] be will be able to help us to appreciate
[1:17:28] when you struggle with the thought of
[1:17:30] how can god hate
[1:17:32] or how
[1:17:33] can god say i create good i create evil
[1:17:38] praise the lord
[1:17:39] the lord of contracts
[1:17:41] help us to appreciate that because with
[1:17:45] a lot of contracts
[1:17:47] you we will not appreciate
[1:17:50] day if we did not have night
[1:17:54] praise the lord
[1:17:57] amen
[1:18:02] if we never had a global crisis where
[1:18:05] people
[1:18:06] are caught up in the icus on ventilator
[1:18:11] many of us who have gone and never
[1:18:13] appreciate the good health
[1:18:15] that we have
[1:18:20] praise the lord
[1:18:22] so it takes
[1:18:25] one ugly
[1:18:27] to be able to appreciate
[1:18:29] the goat
[1:18:32] praise the lord
[1:18:34] now so
[1:18:36] god
[1:18:37] this sovereign god trying to manifest
[1:18:42] his attributes
[1:18:44] praise the lord
[1:18:46] has to allow a law of contracts to play
[1:18:50] out
[1:18:54] for his attributes to be appreciated
[1:18:59] if there was none sake we would never
[1:19:01] know him as a healer
[1:19:05] praise the lord
[1:19:07] so you see in one sense it's the beauty
[1:19:10] of almighty god
[1:19:12] trying to make himself known and trying
[1:19:15] to reveal himself his potential to his
[1:19:18] people
[1:19:22] so it's lay out in the lord of contracts
[1:19:27] we can appreciate good behavior because
[1:19:29] we know bad behavior
[1:19:34] praise the lord
[1:19:41] now so as we look at this
[1:19:44] we all know the story
[1:19:46] uh the story was told from
[1:19:49] the revolution
[1:19:50] you know about this uh
[1:19:54] soldier
[1:19:55] that was that was going to be forgiving
[1:19:58] and then uh
[1:20:00] his pardon was ready and was taken to
[1:20:02] him in the praising
[1:20:05] from from the commander from the leader
[1:20:07] and whoever it is and it was handed to
[1:20:09] him
[1:20:11] but he kind of looked at the sheet that
[1:20:13] the pattern was written on
[1:20:15] and
[1:20:16] the problem was not the writing the
[1:20:19] problem was not the the problem was
[1:20:22] he has already condemned himself to
[1:20:25] death
[1:20:27] he has filled in his mind that he will
[1:20:29] be hanged tomorrow
[1:20:34] he never found no room for mercy for
[1:20:37] himself
[1:20:39] so even if it was written with gold in
[1:20:42] pain and it was sealed and it was put in
[1:20:44] an envelope there is no way he he will
[1:20:46] struggle to accept it
[1:20:51] because he has been eating up with his
[1:20:53] own guilt
[1:20:58] praise the lord
[1:21:02] so you see the problem was met that he
[1:21:05] was forsaking and there was no mercy
[1:21:08] given to him the problem there is that
[1:21:10] because he has already consumed himself
[1:21:15] with his problem
[1:21:19] praise the lord
[1:21:24] are we together
[1:21:26] just like jesus said
[1:21:29] all things are possible
[1:21:31] to them
[1:21:32] that belief
[1:21:35] all things still remain possible
[1:21:38] but the ones that will experience that
[1:21:41] possibility
[1:21:42] we have to be the ones that believe
[1:21:46] not believe in your abilities
[1:21:49] not believe in your strength
[1:21:51] but believe in the one that has made the
[1:21:54] promise now so the struggle comes to the
[1:21:58] place where we look at ourselves and and
[1:22:01] and we know all of our thoughts we know
[1:22:03] that our struggle
[1:22:08] so the problem is now with the promise
[1:22:11] the problem is with the things you are
[1:22:14] dealing with
[1:22:16] you cannot rise above those things
[1:22:19] and believe
[1:22:20] that the god that have created you is
[1:22:23] the god that have made this promise
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:31] are we together
[1:22:37] are you seeing the picture
[1:22:43] it's not a god that is possessed with a
[1:22:46] with a hit character
[1:22:50] but a god that is showing
[1:22:53] he's manifesting
[1:22:57] that this pure fountain of love that he
[1:23:00] is
[1:23:03] the only ones that will receive it are
[1:23:05] the ones from him
[1:23:11] praise the lord
[1:23:13] this is two rivers that run parallel and
[1:23:16] never meet
[1:23:18] there is no way you can jump from one to
[1:23:20] the other
[1:23:26] are we together amen
[1:23:30] all this now by might it's not about
[1:23:32] power
[1:23:33] what is by the spirit of god
[1:23:36] that is going to rise his children above
[1:23:39] the situation of their lives
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:43] to be able to receive
[1:23:44] god's word and god's mind about you
[1:23:49] praise the lord
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:52] there is one
[1:23:54] that has the desire and the thing that
[1:23:56] drive him to church because he have
[1:23:58] heard you know god is a good god you
[1:24:00] know he's a god of prosperity and and as
[1:24:03] he approached this
[1:24:05] it's all about himself
[1:24:07] his reasoning about serving god is to
[1:24:10] have a better job a better life a better
[1:24:13] wife a better house it's just order by
[1:24:17] himself
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] praise the lord
[1:24:22] and there is another one also that is
[1:24:24] approaching this promise
[1:24:26] and it's all about
[1:24:28] be it unto me not calling to your word
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:35] whatever is your purpose in in your mind
[1:24:37] concerning me
[1:24:43] are we together
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:58] oh god has been so merciful he's being
[1:25:00] so gracious he's been he's been so good
[1:25:03] i mean protection you can see his hand
[1:25:06] in many places of our lives
[1:25:12] the one
[1:25:14] whose approach to god is odd about
[1:25:16] himself
[1:25:17] as long as he does not have what this
[1:25:19] person has or has what that person has
[1:25:22] no
[1:25:24] the goodness of god has not reached to
[1:25:25] that level yet god has said goodbye i
[1:25:27] have not reached to that level
[1:25:30] because it's all about self
[1:25:35] and what is behind seth pride
[1:25:42] pride
[1:25:47] but it's the other that said don't you
[1:25:49] slave me
[1:25:53] yet i would still love you
[1:25:57] because you separated me from my
[1:25:59] mother's form
[1:26:03] when there were millions of sales from
[1:26:05] my father you said this one will live
[1:26:09] i never had no choosing in it
[1:26:15] praise the lord
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:21] so you understand what brother bannon
[1:26:23] says year in recognizing the nighting
[1:26:25] upon the word
[1:26:26] is because
[1:26:29] the ability
[1:26:32] to accept god's will for your life
[1:26:34] and rejoice in it amen
[1:26:39] the ability of identifying
[1:26:43] god's way for your life
[1:26:47] job struggle with it but when the vision
[1:26:51] broke forth
[1:26:52] he said i know my redeemer levitt
[1:26:56] praise the lord
[1:26:58] he said i know my redeemer live it
[1:27:00] naked i came naked i'll return but i
[1:27:03] know that we see him face to face
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:09] at the beginning job struggle with the
[1:27:11] bob's struggle with lost in his
[1:27:13] children's struggle with everything but
[1:27:15] when he break through that china
[1:27:20] he said be it unto me
[1:27:22] i call him
[1:27:23] to your word amen
[1:27:27] praise the lord
[1:27:29] that's the reason why all these meager
[1:27:32] churches or prosperity they only go for
[1:27:34] three years
[1:27:37] because the people have been promised to
[1:27:39] i mean to live in beverly's hills they
[1:27:41] have been promised to ride the
[1:27:43] uh
[1:27:44] 2022 vehicles and it keeps sowing and it
[1:27:47] keeps sowing and it keeps sowing
[1:27:52] and nothing is happening
[1:27:58] praise the lord god is not an atm
[1:28:11] are we together amen
[1:28:15] let's look at this other promise also
[1:28:18] introduction church h book the bible
[1:28:20] said
[1:28:21] first corinthians chapter 5 verse 21
[1:28:24] that we have become the righteousness of
[1:28:28] god
[1:28:29] by our union
[1:28:32] with jesus christ
[1:28:35] did you get it
[1:28:37] it says that we
[1:28:39] are
[1:28:41] the very
[1:28:42] righteousness
[1:28:44] of god himself amen
[1:28:47] just by reading that
[1:28:51] and with the amen i can see how you're
[1:28:53] struggling with that in your mind
[1:28:55] i can feed it already
[1:28:58] i can feed it
[1:28:59] how are you struggling with that because
[1:29:01] all devil is just right my friend you
[1:29:04] know you know what i know
[1:29:06] and the devil is just breathing
[1:29:07] everything in your ears and your mind
[1:29:09] your mind is gone out of this building
[1:29:11] you're looking back
[1:29:15] instead of reading this word and
[1:29:18] embracing god's truth
[1:29:26] so you see is the ability
[1:29:29] to receive what god has said
[1:29:32] not to function it in your mind
[1:29:35] not to understand it the way you want to
[1:29:37] understand it
[1:29:39] but to take god's word just like he have
[1:29:41] said
[1:29:52] praise the lord
[1:29:56] that becomes the battle of the believer
[1:30:00] he fights
[1:30:01] because the devil will remind him and
[1:30:03] flood his mind with all of his failures
[1:30:05] and all of the things that he's going
[1:30:07] through
[1:30:08] but there is enough power in him like
[1:30:10] jesus said he that had received has been
[1:30:13] given power to become the sons of god
[1:30:16] there is enough power in him to fight
[1:30:18] every bed as he gets on his knees and
[1:30:20] say god your word is true
[1:30:24] i don't care what my body goes through i
[1:30:26] don't care how my mind is abused by the
[1:30:28] devil but your word remains true if
[1:30:31] there is a that father's in me is
[1:30:33] not with your word that thought is never
[1:30:35] with your word because your word is yeah
[1:30:38] and amen
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:46] why should we blame god because of our
[1:30:48] failure
[1:30:50] when he has never failed
[1:31:01] it says that we are the very
[1:31:04] righteousness
[1:31:07] praise the lord
[1:31:09] okay it's posted in
[1:31:11] this it's posted nassau

[1:32:48] amen
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:50] thank you for pressing true
[1:32:52] and let there be your confession
[1:32:58] praise the lord
[1:33:00] it says that he jesus
[1:33:04] became sin for us
[1:33:06] it does not say
[1:33:08] he became sinful
[1:33:10] he said he became sin
[1:33:14] and say he became sin
[1:33:19] he took on our sin
[1:33:23] he took on lust he took on adultery he
[1:33:26] took on whatever sin there is in the
[1:33:28] word
[1:33:29] he became sin for us
[1:33:36] are we together
[1:33:43] it does not say he became sinful he
[1:33:46] became sin for us
[1:33:50] that by our union
[1:33:53] with him we might become the
[1:33:56] righteousness of god amen
[1:33:59] if we accept the fact
[1:34:02] and we must
[1:34:06] praise the lord
[1:34:07] we must
[1:34:11] it's a must just like the new birth is a
[1:34:14] must this is a must
[1:34:18] the lord
[1:34:19] if you don't accept it as a must you can
[1:34:21] never go free
[1:34:23] because you give him half and you
[1:34:25] carrying half with the rest of your life
[1:34:28] but he became sin for us
[1:34:30] it's a must you must let it go
[1:34:34] you must give it to him amen
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:39] praise the lord
[1:34:41] oh
[1:34:42] my
[1:34:44] let's say thank you jesus
[1:34:46] thank you jesus
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:53] if we accept the fight and we must
[1:34:56] that he literally
[1:34:59] literally
[1:35:01] the roman picture
[1:35:03] tried to put a little cloth around him
[1:35:06] but he was stripped naked
[1:35:09] literally naked
[1:35:21] that he literally became seen
[1:35:24] for us
[1:35:26] by his substitute for us
[1:35:30] then we must also accept
[1:35:34] you see the problem is accepting one and
[1:35:37] not accepting the other
[1:35:41] it does not work
[1:35:43] it does not work that way
[1:35:46] it does not work that way
[1:35:51] are we together
[1:35:53] it does not work that way
[1:36:01] we must also accept the fact
[1:36:04] that we about our union with him have
[1:36:07] become the very righteousness of god
[1:36:11] to reject one
[1:36:14] is to reject the other
[1:36:19] praise the lord
[1:36:23] the man never believed that he was
[1:36:25] pardoned so nothing could free him
[1:36:30] nothing could free him the possibility
[1:36:32] of letting him out of prison is for him
[1:36:34] to commit suicide
[1:36:38] the possibility of just opening the
[1:36:40] present gate and say go you are free is
[1:36:42] for him to commit
[1:36:45] he go and hang himself
[1:36:46] that's what judah said
[1:36:58] because there was nothing in him to
[1:37:00] accept that he was free
[1:37:02] his mind has condemned him
[1:37:05] he have accepted in his heart
[1:37:09] he wrote his will what is what he should
[1:37:11] give to his children
[1:37:16] he has already buried himself
[1:37:19] before he was dead
[1:37:27] and how many times
[1:37:28] god's children walk like this
[1:37:35] we come to church and we sing the songs
[1:37:37] of zion and we praise god we dance to
[1:37:39] the music and in every one of that
[1:37:42] and we go through those doors
[1:37:45] we go through those doors
[1:37:50] just the way we came in
[1:37:54] the fact that you cannot go just the way
[1:37:56] you came you either go better or you go
[1:37:59] worse
[1:38:06] praise the lord
[1:38:09] if you believe with me that we serve an
[1:38:11] almighty god
[1:38:12] that there is
[1:38:14] nothing impossible with him praise the
[1:38:16] lord
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:18] then we must never leave this building
[1:38:20] defeated
[1:38:21] we must never leave this building with
[1:38:24] hidden things in our lives we must never
[1:38:27] leave this building
[1:38:28] with sin struggle
[1:38:32] or as you have just come to church and
[1:38:34] you have never met god
[1:38:50] praise the lord
[1:38:58] unto the lord be the glory
[1:39:01] great thing he have done
[1:39:04] praise the lord
[1:39:09] i believe that great thing he's still
[1:39:10] doing
[1:39:14] i believe that great thing he's doing
[1:39:15] right now
[1:39:20] praise the lord
[1:39:22] just like i said wednesday now all of
[1:39:24] these people having problems with the
[1:39:26] message
[1:39:26] they are all failures
[1:39:29] they have failed to produce god in their
[1:39:31] lives
[1:39:35] they have failed to see the
[1:39:36] manifestation of god
[1:39:41] how can you blame the seventh grade man
[1:39:43] seventh grade man with a seventh grade
[1:39:46] education
[1:39:47] that shook the world
[1:39:50] with the move of god
[1:39:56] oh he was a man yeah he was a man
[1:39:59] oh yeah he was a man
[1:40:01] he had his floor like every other man
[1:40:04] but the thing about that
[1:40:06] man he took god at his word
[1:40:13] amen praise the lord
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:22] can't even blame the pastor
[1:40:25] how can you blame the pastor
[1:40:27] for your work with god
[1:40:30] how can you blame the church
[1:40:32] when god is ever pressing
[1:40:35] when god has made himself available that
[1:40:38] you don't have to go through another
[1:40:40] person
[1:40:44] you can be able to experience him right
[1:40:46] handed
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:57] praise the lord
[1:41:01] if there is anybody to blame is yourself
[1:41:05] you must blame yourself
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:09] praise the lord
[1:41:11] oh if we would just learn to be like
[1:41:13] that man lord i believe help my own
[1:41:16] belief
[1:41:20] then cassie blame him and cast him blame
[1:41:22] you then cast him blame thee
[1:41:25] when we have the word of god
[1:41:28] given to us like in no other age
[1:41:33] in no other age
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] we have the word of god
[1:41:38] given to us
[1:41:42] i have an app on my phone that has the
[1:41:44] bible in every written language
[1:41:50] i went to visit my auntie the other day
[1:41:52] and she was not welding i prayed for her
[1:41:55] and all of that so i checked through my
[1:41:57] arm and i saw the you know uh one of our
[1:42:01] vernacular that is close to her
[1:42:03] to to what what they speak there so
[1:42:06] uh
[1:42:07] i never told her i just i just went to
[1:42:09] the app put the the bible on and started
[1:42:12] playing
[1:42:13] and she says
[1:42:16] oh that's var
[1:42:21] she said yeah that's va i can't i can't
[1:42:23] understand what to say
[1:42:25] i can't understand that i cannot
[1:42:26] understand it
[1:42:31] but i i just i just did i wanted to
[1:42:34] change the mood around her a little bit
[1:42:37] and i just did that and
[1:42:40] and yeah and she felt good about it
[1:42:45] praise the lord
[1:42:54] so the problem
[1:42:57] is with
[1:43:00] laodicea's christians
[1:43:04] this is a rich age
[1:43:07] this age is not only reaching goals this
[1:43:10] age is rich in god
[1:43:15] this age is rich in god
[1:43:18] this is a rich age
[1:43:23] but the christians of this age are lazy
[1:43:27] lazy
[1:43:28] to be able to reach out
[1:43:32] just like we have press button for
[1:43:34] everything
[1:43:36] we also want to press button and put
[1:43:38] ourselves in the rapture
[1:43:40] we won by the press button you will
[1:43:41] receive the holy ghost no brother
[1:43:44] no you have to get down on your knees
[1:43:46] you got to get in business with god
[1:43:49] you got to get in business with god
[1:43:53] because god will not give you a portion
[1:43:55] of himself that you don't value
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:07] praise the lord
[1:44:09] so you see where where where are we
[1:44:11] coming to them where we are with the
[1:44:12] thought
[1:44:13] you know we we try to make this law we
[1:44:16] we understand it in our mind
[1:44:20] you know we understand it in our mind
[1:44:22] why all the people on earth at that time
[1:44:25] god will only choose job to wipe out all
[1:44:28] his children why
[1:44:30] can you see love in there
[1:44:35] the human mind will never see love in
[1:44:38] that
[1:44:42] but with god that is love
[1:44:44] it's election i choose this man to trust
[1:44:48] him
[1:44:51] i choose this man among everybody on the
[1:44:54] earth
[1:44:55] to trust him
[1:44:58] because the human mind will never
[1:45:00] understand that as love that's the
[1:45:02] reason why your friends thought he was a
[1:45:04] secret sinner
[1:45:07] because no way you can think that that
[1:45:08] is love
[1:45:10] why god will wipe all the all his family
[1:45:13] all his wealth
[1:45:16] i mean it would have even been better
[1:45:18] keep him healthy he will work and get it
[1:45:20] again but god struck his health
[1:45:27] for 14 years
[1:45:35] let it just cut your phone off one day
[1:45:38] because you don't go on facebook
[1:45:44] oh god what is this oh god
[1:45:47] oh god what is this
[1:45:49] oh god
[1:46:00] we have
[1:46:01] we have
[1:46:02] limited ourself
[1:46:06] because you can limit god
[1:46:13] we have turned in our mind to think that
[1:46:16] god is touchable things yes
[1:46:22] material things
[1:46:28] we must be able to catch up with the
[1:46:29] technology then god is good to me
[1:46:32] god is good to me
[1:46:36] praise the lord
[1:46:39] a songwriter said even if you don't pay
[1:46:41] for one more miracle
[1:46:43] he still remain good
[1:46:45] he still is a good god
[1:46:49] because just the the thought of you
[1:46:52] acknowledging that is a miracle
[1:46:56] it's a miracle in himself
[1:47:01] so i'm all over the place
[1:47:03] but i think i'm standing at a good place
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:07] praise the lord
[1:47:08] so you see yeah we we we kind of are
[1:47:11] looking at the life year of uh of of
[1:47:14] issa and jacob
[1:47:16] and all like brother branham said in
[1:47:18] crisis the mystery of god revealed
[1:47:20] god choose his man
[1:47:23] in all the ages
[1:47:25] even in this time
[1:47:27] god has chosen a people
[1:47:30] to rise up
[1:47:32] above the situation of this age
[1:47:35] praise the lord god will always have a
[1:47:38] witness he will always have a son of god
[1:47:42] he will have a daughter of god no matter
[1:47:44] what people say no matter what people
[1:47:46] think amen
[1:47:49] praise the lord
[1:47:50] it can be in a hidden part of the earth
[1:47:53] there will still be a man or a woman
[1:47:55] that says i know that god is real
[1:48:01] i know that there is a living god
[1:48:08] praise the lord
[1:48:11] so god choose this character
[1:48:14] these characters
[1:48:16] in the bible
[1:48:18] to to display his attributes
[1:48:21] just like in the beginning when he said
[1:48:24] let the water divided from the land
[1:48:26] let it let let the letter f bring forth
[1:48:30] grass
[1:48:31] so he did the eating but now when it
[1:48:34] comes over to the time of abraham isaac
[1:48:37] jacob and all of those men through the
[1:48:39] ages
[1:48:40] god
[1:48:41] wanted to show
[1:48:43] his attribute of faith working in human
[1:48:46] flesh
[1:48:48] now you have to know that this body is
[1:48:51] produced by eve in the serpent
[1:48:54] but yet god is going to raise a man up
[1:48:59] called abraham
[1:49:01] from
[1:49:03] uh uh uh i idolatrous background
[1:49:06] he was worshiping idols
[1:49:08] now god is going to use that one man in
[1:49:12] that generation
[1:49:13] to show that a man can come from a worse
[1:49:17] path
[1:49:18] but because he's in the election of god
[1:49:22] god can get ahold of him
[1:49:25] and he can stand up in his generation
[1:49:28] [Applause]
[1:49:31] abraham separated from his father's
[1:49:33] house
[1:49:36] going to a place
[1:49:37] where he had never been before
[1:49:41] praise the lord
[1:49:44] you call it faith
[1:49:46] abraham
[1:49:48] he didn't know how to cut it
[1:49:51] you are the one that said abraham walked
[1:49:53] by faith
[1:49:55] for abraham he didn't know how to cut it
[1:49:59] for him there was something that was
[1:50:01] dealing with his heart
[1:50:06] he was just going
[1:50:10] you said enough walk by faith
[1:50:13] that's not what enoch said
[1:50:17] there is no way in the scripture where
[1:50:18] the bible says enoch said i walk by
[1:50:20] faith you are the one that said it
[1:50:23] or maybe you took the language from paul
[1:50:27] in hebrew 11. but for enoch
[1:50:31] there was a time in his life
[1:50:34] where something struck him
[1:50:38] and he find this time in his everyday
[1:50:42] to get along
[1:50:45] just be alone
[1:50:49] no matter what was going on he had his
[1:50:51] farm he had his tattoos he had
[1:50:53] everything but he fought the time
[1:50:56] every day to get along
[1:51:01] whether it was in the bush whether it
[1:51:03] was by the beach he just found a time to
[1:51:06] get alone
[1:51:10] and every time he was alone it was
[1:51:12] wonderful
[1:51:15] praise the lord
[1:51:16] maybe he talking by himself look at the
[1:51:18] stars it's so beautiful
[1:51:20] oh my goodness
[1:51:22] it's so wonderful
[1:51:25] don't mind me he's losing his mind
[1:51:27] i see that old man every day he comes
[1:51:29] here he's losing his mind
[1:51:35] and paul says by faith
[1:51:38] but for enoch it was not faith
[1:51:41] it was something that was part of him
[1:51:48] abraham got tired with the idols of his
[1:51:51] father for some reason something just
[1:51:53] came on him every day we got to go and
[1:51:55] carry rice and oil water to this image
[1:51:59] there it does not talk we make sacrifice
[1:52:01] you don't even move you touch your smile
[1:52:03] it falls down you got to put it all back
[1:52:04] again
[1:52:10] something just came in his mind and says
[1:52:13] i don't know what happened to my daddy
[1:52:15] he's losing his mind the same thing that
[1:52:17] came over gideon when he broke all his
[1:52:19] father idols
[1:52:23] and he said given why you did this
[1:52:25] abomination he said why are you people
[1:52:27] fighting for god
[1:52:29] why you're fighting for god
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:41] and abraham walking he walked he took
[1:52:44] his his nephew locked along and and he
[1:52:47] walked and uh
[1:52:49] i mean abraham talking all of these
[1:52:51] things it does not make sense to to lot
[1:52:53] father of nation your part is not a
[1:52:56] general how you going to be father of
[1:52:57] national you are you know you are you
[1:52:59] feeling living your inheritance
[1:53:05] but it was just
[1:53:08] a revelation
[1:53:10] that he could not understand
[1:53:13] something kept
[1:53:15] telling him
[1:53:18] praise the lord
[1:53:20] now you see the human mind what the
[1:53:22] human mind will produce is that as soon
[1:53:25] as abraham steps up god must make sarah
[1:53:28] pregnant and god must give him favor
[1:53:31] with everything the human mind wants it
[1:53:33] so easy
[1:53:40] but abraham stepped out he don't even
[1:53:42] know where he's going
[1:53:45] he's even going with fear
[1:53:48] he's afraid that they're going to kill
[1:53:50] him because of his wife
[1:53:54] but yet he's glory
[1:53:57] [Laughter]
[1:53:59] yet he's glory
[1:54:08] oh may god help us
[1:54:12] praise the lord
[1:54:14] may god help us
[1:54:18] so god choose these men in the ages
[1:54:23] he choose this man jesus
[1:54:25] would come and tell the i mean the
[1:54:27] pharisees were asking the sadducees
[1:54:29] about the resurrection
[1:54:31] and they were bringing this crazy story
[1:54:33] to jesus
[1:54:34] and said there was a man that had a wife
[1:54:37] he never had a child and he died and the
[1:54:40] next brother married him married a woman
[1:54:42] she never had a child and she died and
[1:54:45] the next brother and he died
[1:54:47] now they want to be stupid to prove that
[1:54:50] there is no resurrection so they are
[1:54:52] asking jesus
[1:54:54] in the resurrection who wife will she be
[1:54:58] but watch now
[1:55:00] god in the old testament
[1:55:02] in the life of their father jacob
[1:55:06] or judah
[1:55:08] in the life of their father judah
[1:55:11] god wrote the very thing they were
[1:55:13] talking in the new testament god wrote
[1:55:14] it in judah life
[1:55:16] because judah had a daughter-in-law
[1:55:18] called tema that she gave her first
[1:55:20] santo and he died and the next one came
[1:55:23] and behaved stupid god killed him and
[1:55:26] the next one came
[1:55:29] so what the cyruses were talking about
[1:55:32] god has already wrote it in in terms
[1:55:34] life
[1:55:40] praise the lord
[1:55:46] are we together amen
[1:55:55] god will use a hallowed woman called
[1:55:57] rahab
[1:56:02] that got herself involved with
[1:56:05] high-class men
[1:56:09] praise the lord
[1:56:12] rehab was not going for any
[1:56:14] beggar on the street
[1:56:17] praise the lord
[1:56:20] she was going for the high-class man and
[1:56:23] the foreigners
[1:56:25] thinking like she was a woman always
[1:56:26] around the airport
[1:56:31] praise the lord
[1:56:36] and just ask how that looks horrible in
[1:56:39] the life of rahab
[1:56:42] a divine purpose
[1:56:45] kept her that way
[1:56:47] because that is the desire
[1:56:50] that will attract her to the spice
[1:56:54] because she's always looking for
[1:56:55] foreigners
[1:57:01] oh that god's purpose of election
[1:57:04] will stand
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:08] that's why he passed us through the
[1:57:10] things
[1:57:11] that we go through in our lives
[1:57:15] if we only give it back to him
[1:57:19] and say lord
[1:57:20] just ask her aim amen we found no play
[1:57:27] i bring all of this back to you
[1:57:33] god
[1:57:35] will choose these
[1:57:36] men and women throughout
[1:57:43] so when it comes to
[1:57:45] esa and jacob
[1:57:49] before that's why the scripture said
[1:57:51] before they were even born
[1:57:53] so it goes back
[1:57:56] to the foundation of the word
[1:57:58] it goes back to the mind of god it goes
[1:58:01] back to god's internal purpose
[1:58:12] praise the lord
[1:58:16] before they were even born
[1:58:24] malacca the prophet picking up from
[1:58:26] god's mind
[1:58:28] read malachi chapter 1 you will
[1:58:29] appreciate that scripture you will not
[1:58:31] see it in the kind of sense of loving
[1:58:34] and hating
[1:58:35] you will see it in the sense of god
[1:58:37] expressing his love
[1:58:40] and the ability for you to receive it
[1:58:43] you'll be always grateful
[1:58:47] because the bible says god for god so
[1:58:49] loved the word
[1:58:51] he loved to the word is the same
[1:58:55] the only difference
[1:58:57] is you have the ability
[1:58:59] to receive it
[1:59:01] and appreciate it
[1:59:03] and some done
[1:59:06] some done
[1:59:07] they argue they insult god
[1:59:16] are we together
[1:59:19] let's go back to something we we all
[1:59:21] heard this morning if you if you did
[1:59:22] follow the sunday school
[1:59:28] now we are fully acquainted
[1:59:31] we people who search the scripture day
[1:59:33] tonight and read our papers
[1:59:35] and yeah
[1:59:36] the news coming true let's bring it to
[1:59:39] our day
[1:59:41] that
[1:59:43] this word is now standing
[1:59:46] in the gaps of two great spiritual
[1:59:48] forces
[1:59:51] praise the lord
[1:59:52] amen two great spiritual forces
[1:59:56] that's the reason why i believe that
[1:59:58] christians should not feed on the media
[2:00:01] christian must take god's promise and
[2:00:03] get down on their knees and say lord
[2:00:06] there is a deaf angel over the land
[2:00:08] there is a death angel over the land i
[2:00:11] want to make sure that the talking is
[2:00:13] applied i apply the talking for my
[2:00:15] neighbors i apply it for my relatives
[2:00:17] instead of feeding on the news media
[2:00:21] and cooking our minds with uh conspiracy
[2:00:24] theory and all sorts of things two great
[2:00:26] spiritual forces can you see it
[2:00:31] we're living just in a town like it was
[2:00:34] in egypt the bible says there were
[2:00:36] darkness that could be felt
[2:00:39] and every one of us can feed this virus
[2:00:42] if not you will not wear maxes in the
[2:00:44] area that you wearing maxis
[2:00:46] i do too
[2:00:48] it's because we all can feed it
[2:00:52] it's a darkness that can be fed
[2:00:59] two great spiritual forces
[2:01:11] and they are both
[2:01:13] religious
[2:01:16] they are both religious
[2:01:18] jesus said the two spirit of this end
[2:01:21] time will be so close
[2:01:23] that if possible
[2:01:26] the illet will be deceived
[2:01:28] and that's the reason what i said
[2:01:30] right from the beginning
[2:01:32] i'm never going to approach this
[2:01:34] coronavirus thing on faith
[2:01:38] oh if you have it you don't have faith
[2:01:40] if you i don't have it you have faith
[2:01:42] don't bring that here
[2:01:46] because it's not truth
[2:01:50] god will allow some of his children to
[2:01:51] go by that way
[2:01:53] and we will still lift our hands and say
[2:01:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:01:58] and yet god will raise some
[2:02:04] visiting them by an angel
[2:02:07] just like brother brother fling
[2:02:08] testified to brother amos
[2:02:10] over there in alaska god visited him by
[2:02:13] an injure
[2:02:15] and say fear not you won't die
[2:02:21] because it's two great spiritual forces
[2:02:29] religious
[2:02:30] very religious
[2:02:36] and i believe that these great forces
[2:02:39] are soon coming to the head
[2:02:43] means they are coming to a clash
[2:02:48] they are coming to a clash
[2:02:52] and we will see what they are made of
[2:02:58] we will see what they are made of
[2:03:07] and i believe that these forces
[2:03:09] are sown coming to the head and both of
[2:03:11] these great forces was represented
[2:03:16] in these two
[2:03:18] sons of isaac
[2:03:23] praise the lord
[2:03:25] just like how god used abraham
[2:03:28] to show how through the ages he will
[2:03:31] raise men of faith
[2:03:34] praise the lord
[2:03:35] amen
[2:03:37] when it came to isaac
[2:03:40] in god's mind was a love story
[2:03:45] it was a love story the beautiful the
[2:03:48] beauty is love story
[2:03:51] now abraham will call
[2:03:53] eloiza
[2:03:57] and say go to a land go back to my
[2:03:59] father's home
[2:04:03] and find a wife
[2:04:05] for my son
[2:04:07] put your hand on my tired and promise me
[2:04:13] you will not bring
[2:04:17] no one except the one
[2:04:20] from my father's house
[2:04:24] praise the lord
[2:04:27] amen
[2:04:30] this brother had a problem with his wife
[2:04:35] and before he got married i mean he was
[2:04:36] so on fire and he was testifying to the
[2:04:38] pastor you know god gave him his wife
[2:04:41] god gave me my wife
[2:04:44] so he came to the pastor and says pastor
[2:04:45] i have to send her back
[2:04:47] to her parents i can't stand her
[2:04:49] the pastor said well you kill her then
[2:04:52] say well i don't want to kill
[2:04:54] he said well you told me that god gave
[2:04:56] her to you
[2:04:57] the only way to send her back to god is
[2:04:59] for you to kill her
[2:05:02] okay let's get back
[2:05:03] praise the lord
[2:05:07] the most beautiful love story in the
[2:05:09] bible
[2:05:11] god using the life of isaac
[2:05:17] read the bible
[2:05:18] when when when god promised abraham
[2:05:22] he told abraham he will possess the
[2:05:24] gifts of the enemy
[2:05:28] rebecca parents were met with abraham
[2:05:32] but when they were sending rebecca out
[2:05:34] they pronounced those same words
[2:05:38] over rebecca
[2:05:44] so what was god doing with that with
[2:05:46] that with the life of isaac
[2:05:48] just bringing out
[2:05:50] love story
[2:05:53] for god so loved the world that he gave
[2:05:55] us his only begotten son abraham taking
[2:05:58] isaac up on the hill it was a love story
[2:06:02] god never wanted isaac
[2:06:05] god just wanted for abraham to express
[2:06:07] love to him amen
[2:06:12] it was not about isaac it was about the
[2:06:14] love of abraham
[2:06:16] amen
[2:06:18] amen
[2:06:19] are we ready
[2:06:20] to let go
[2:06:25] the things we love the most
[2:06:32] praise the lord amen
[2:06:34] so god god faith in abraham he expressed
[2:06:38] love all through the life of isaac
[2:06:42] nanny and jacob
[2:06:46] god's purpose
[2:06:48] was to show his grace
[2:06:52] it was to show his grace
[2:06:59] praise the lord
[2:07:01] jake i mean david was raised up
[2:07:04] for god to show a man after god's own
[2:07:08] heart
[2:07:10] that's what god raised him up for
[2:07:13] and gave him a trial for 30 years
[2:07:18] he was on the run
[2:07:22] praise the lord
[2:07:24] amen
[2:07:29] he was on the run running running from
[2:07:31] from uh from uh
[2:07:33] sword
[2:07:36] turtle close to 30 years because i
[2:07:38] thirty years he came on the throne so
[2:07:39] close to 30 years he had to go through
[2:07:41] the striatus
[2:07:45] so you see these two great forces are
[2:07:47] coming to a cloud they are religious
[2:07:49] spirit and i believe the two grace
[2:07:51] forces are coming to the head and both
[2:07:52] of these forces are represented in these
[2:07:55] two songs how that god in his infinite
[2:07:58] wisdom
[2:08:00] has foreshadowed
[2:08:02] all things to us
[2:08:05] like paul said they were for our good
[2:08:09] god foreshadowed these things
[2:08:14] that we might but these things know
[2:08:17] of asserting
[2:08:19] what lays
[2:08:21] before us
[2:08:23] he made it plain
[2:08:28] just like how uh
[2:08:30] jacob had to prepare himself to meet
[2:08:33] ease her that is the same way this last
[2:08:36] day church have to prepare herself for
[2:08:38] the world council of churches
[2:08:44] praise the lord
[2:08:48] and we realize that every man that has
[2:08:49] been in our ranks
[2:08:51] they are not carrying order of our
[2:08:53] secrets
[2:08:54] they say the cloud is no more than he
[2:08:56] said this is no more than he said that
[2:08:58] is no more
[2:09:00] praise the lord
[2:09:07] coming to a close here
[2:09:17] made it so plain
[2:09:19] that god in his word and his nature
[2:09:23] and his universe is so perfectly
[2:09:26] arranged together amen
[2:09:30] now even the sinner can see something is
[2:09:33] fixing to take place
[2:09:37] god has arranged his soul
[2:09:40] and no one
[2:09:44] is to fire skills
[2:09:50] now we see
[2:09:51] these two sounds
[2:09:54] the evening day before
[2:09:56] they were even born
[2:09:59] they were at war one with another
[2:10:02] even though they are virgin mother
[2:10:05] for she was a virgin the beautiful
[2:10:07] rebecca that married the righteous seed
[2:10:11] of god's promise isaac
[2:10:13] that they were two
[2:10:16] consecrated spirit-filled believers of
[2:10:18] god
[2:10:20] of their time
[2:10:22] praise the lord
[2:10:25] how isaac entreated the lord for his
[2:10:27] wife
[2:10:30] and said god
[2:10:33] you raised me up from the dead
[2:10:35] because you heard the hands of my father
[2:10:38] before that knife came down
[2:10:42] and you that raised me up from the dead
[2:10:45] you can also give life to the womb of my
[2:10:48] wife
[2:10:49] the bible said he entreated the lord
[2:10:52] for his wife
[2:10:53] they were righteous god the people
[2:10:56] of their day
[2:10:58] are we together
[2:11:00] spiritual fall ordained to the very
[2:11:03] marriage
[2:11:04] that they were united together
[2:11:07] god for knew it and how could such a
[2:11:11] thing comes true
[2:11:12] that one mother
[2:11:14] by one father
[2:11:16] one
[2:11:18] a very evil person
[2:11:20] and another
[2:11:22] a good person
[2:11:24] praise the lord
[2:11:30] you know it just all go to show that
[2:11:33] you know we we never
[2:11:36] we never
[2:11:37] gave birth to to uh uh uh
[2:11:40] you know uh have let me free me let me
[2:11:43] see the right way so it will now sound
[2:11:45] very ugly you know when we give birth to
[2:11:48] our children they need a new
[2:11:50] birth amen
[2:11:53] we don't bone believers
[2:11:55] it would break the scripture
[2:11:57] because david said in sin did my mother
[2:11:59] conceive me
[2:12:00] so every child that we born is born in
[2:12:03] sin
[2:12:04] as long as they come by the natural
[2:12:05] birth
[2:12:16] they need an experience with god
[2:12:20] they need a visitation they need a birth
[2:12:22] of god
[2:12:25] there has always been the program of god
[2:12:27] you cannot change it
[2:12:29] he says
[2:12:31] we will know it today as the lord of
[2:12:33] contracts there's word there is good
[2:12:36] there is evil where there is right there
[2:12:38] is wrong and we will never know matter
[2:12:42] what our environment will be
[2:12:45] maybe
[2:12:46] ever be able to shake ourselves
[2:12:50] from the presence of either
[2:12:54] because paul said when i will do good
[2:12:57] evil is present
[2:12:59] you have a flesh that is not converted
[2:13:05] you have a flesh that is not converted
[2:13:10] that birth of god is in you is in your
[2:13:12] soul
[2:13:14] it's a c word that is in your soul
[2:13:17] and as you feed it with the world you
[2:13:19] nourish it it grows to bring this body
[2:13:22] honest objection
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] but this body will never be a seed of
[2:13:27] god it was never and it would never be
[2:13:34] you will root it
[2:13:36] you will possess it
[2:13:38] until you step in your new body
[2:13:41] you must fight to keep it under control
[2:13:45] bring is thought subject to the word
[2:13:47] bring his desire subject to the word
[2:13:50] bring his feelings subject to the word
[2:13:55] for everything of this flesh is of this
[2:13:57] word
[2:13:59] the loss of the eye
[2:14:03] the loss of the flesh the pride of life
[2:14:11] no matter what your environment is you
[2:14:13] will never be able to shake yourself
[2:14:14] from the presence of
[2:14:16] of either
[2:14:18] the sinner will never be able to shake
[2:14:20] himself away from christians and the
[2:14:22] christians from the sinner
[2:14:24] there will be a witness
[2:14:27] there of right and the testimony of
[2:14:30] wrong
[2:14:31] always
[2:14:33] and you make your choice
[2:14:38] that's where your free moral agency is
[2:14:41] it's your choice
[2:14:43] to receive or reject
[2:14:47] that's where your free moral agency is
[2:14:51] god does not he don't have put things
[2:14:53] down our truck
[2:14:55] he don't force us
[2:14:57] no he present his word
[2:15:01] now you have to make a choice
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:05] and what is in you will drive your
[2:15:07] choice
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:12] that's what your free moral agency is
[2:15:20] if god will not force you why you want
[2:15:21] to force him
[2:15:26] you can have
[2:15:27] one or the other
[2:15:32] glory be to god
[2:15:34] amen
[2:15:38] this is when people start to judge
[2:15:40] children
[2:15:43] you know take children attitude
[2:15:46] the bible says foolishness is in every
[2:15:48] child amen
[2:15:51] and because we sometimes we become so
[2:15:54] self-righteous and think that well the
[2:15:56] mother is not training him right or the
[2:15:58] father is not training him right
[2:16:00] you know
[2:16:03] all you have to do just pray
[2:16:06] you know just pray wait until you get
[2:16:08] there
[2:16:18] but you see this is this is god's
[2:16:20] purpose
[2:16:22] this is what is in his mind
[2:16:24] that's what bran said this morning he
[2:16:25] says this is this is doctrine this is
[2:16:27] teaching
[2:16:28] this is where the rubber meets the road
[2:16:35] because that's where we come into
[2:16:38] we are coming to that climax
[2:16:41] the people in the world they can feed it
[2:16:43] they don't know what is happening but we
[2:16:45] know what is happening
[2:16:48] we have the information
[2:16:50] because the word of god declared it to
[2:16:52] us
[2:17:01] and just like i said wednesday night
[2:17:06] the baptising of the holy ghost
[2:17:08] is our way of escape amen
[2:17:16] the holy ghost
[2:17:17] young people
[2:17:20] is your way of escape from this present
[2:17:22] evil word
[2:17:24] don't take nothing less than that
[2:17:28] don't take a favorite pastor
[2:17:33] don't take nothing less
[2:17:35] than the holy ghost
[2:17:38] because if you don't have the holy ghost
[2:17:41] we will soon read your own post on
[2:17:42] facebook
[2:17:47] how i was in the message
[2:17:49] and this is what it do in the message
[2:17:54] and in the message it's just control in
[2:17:56] a message is bunnish
[2:17:58] i have to be free
[2:18:05] you kept yourself in bondage out of this
[2:18:06] why
[2:18:10] you kept yourself because those things
[2:18:12] were in you to do
[2:18:20] [Music]
[2:18:23] you love the lord this morning
[2:18:28] praise the lord
[2:18:31] that's the time we are coming to sorry i
[2:18:33] was just all over the place i couldn't
[2:18:34] go go in any direction i don't know who
[2:18:37] was you had staring anyway
[2:18:39] so you were the one driving the car this
[2:18:41] morning
[2:18:42] you know so uh
[2:18:44] uh
[2:18:45] but we just want to thank the lord
[2:18:47] we want to be grateful to him for
[2:18:50] for encouraging our hearts
[2:18:52] reminding us of those things that we
[2:18:54] have been told before
[2:18:56] if you i mean if you didn't hear it
[2:18:58] before you hearing it the first time you
[2:19:00] know uh i will be glad to share more
[2:19:02] with you
[2:19:03] and uh so uh
[2:19:05] [Music]
[2:19:07] we are just so grateful but you see
[2:19:09] that's the time that we are living in
[2:19:11] you know we are coming to that time
[2:19:13] where there is a great spirit of
[2:19:14] jealousy
[2:19:16] you know that is that is creeping up
[2:19:18] every man want to be the man of the hour
[2:19:21] praise the lord
[2:19:23] every man wants to be the man of the
[2:19:25] hour
[2:19:28] so a spirit of jealousy
[2:19:30] is creeping
[2:19:32] people that comes uh you know around the
[2:19:35] message and i really never you know
[2:19:38] grabbed the revelation they struggle
[2:19:39] with the thought
[2:19:40] of a preacher referring to brother
[2:19:42] brandon brother brandon brother branham
[2:19:44] people that have sat around the message
[2:19:46] long and i have never got a revelation
[2:19:48] they also struggle with that thought
[2:19:51] you know
[2:19:52] why can't i be free to say what i want
[2:19:54] to say
[2:19:57] they want some glory they want some
[2:19:59] manifestation they want they want to
[2:20:01] produce something
[2:20:07] just a spirit of jealousy
[2:20:14] because of jealousy jacob i mean joseph
[2:20:17] woke up early in the morning he just go
[2:20:19] to his father
[2:20:20] daddy had this dream
[2:20:22] he did not make it up
[2:20:29] why were the brothers jealous
[2:20:34] that he had to save him i mean sell him
[2:20:37] that youth
[2:20:41] he was robbed of all his youthfulness
[2:20:43] never got to play games
[2:20:47] because he went to egypt as a seven
[2:20:52] but it was jealousy
[2:20:55] it was jealousy
[2:20:57] when quran and dayton rose up in the
[2:20:59] wilderness why moses moses is just moses
[2:21:02] and aaron moses and aaron
[2:21:07] praise the lord
[2:21:09] but you remember all of these years
[2:21:11] they've been in egypt
[2:21:14] whether they were riding big cars
[2:21:16] whether they were living in decent homes
[2:21:18] they were still slaves
[2:21:21] they did not change their status
[2:21:24] they were still a slave because a
[2:21:26] pharaoh rose of that never knew joseph
[2:21:32] they were all in egypt and none of them
[2:21:34] enter pharaoh house and say let my
[2:21:36] people go
[2:21:41] but when moses step on the scene they
[2:21:43] say you want to cause problems for us
[2:21:49] praise the lord
[2:21:54] when he got to the red city we're all
[2:21:55] complaining this is what we said you
[2:21:57] just wanted to bring us here to for us
[2:21:59] to die
[2:22:02] none of them had the road to stretch it
[2:22:04] over that river for it to part and with
[2:22:06] their eyes not in their dream
[2:22:09] with their eyes
[2:22:10] they saw the water pattern
[2:22:15] but yet it was not enough to convince
[2:22:18] them that this was the vindicated man of
[2:22:20] the hour
[2:22:24] they wanted their name to be in the
[2:22:25] story
[2:22:31] they wanted for people to talk about
[2:22:32] them
[2:22:37] you know that brother he got a mighty
[2:22:39] ministry
[2:22:41] he got a mighty ministry
[2:22:45] so what was it a spirit of jealousy
[2:22:49] they say we we too we are from the levi
[2:22:51] tribe
[2:22:53] we have a right to minister to the
[2:22:55] people now only moses
[2:22:58] and what did god there
[2:22:59] he opened the earth
[2:23:03] and swallow
[2:23:05] innocent people
[2:23:08] innocent people that will not take time

[2:23:19] we are from the liver trap too it's not
[2:23:21] only moses and this is so everything

[2:24:01] and swallowed those people
[2:24:03] because they never took time
[2:24:06] to stay with god's word
[2:24:08] and read god's word
[2:24:10] they should have asked themselves a
[2:24:12] question what was quran and dayton when
