remembering the saints in general that in the [Music] in south africa praise the lord and [Music] as we as you remember them we will also be praying for a needy from uh the believers in china there is uh there is a uh pressured on the believers the uh persecution and some of the uh brothers are going through a tough time there and uh now because uh of what we have going on with some of the scenes following the service line we just remember three of the of the believers there that are in praising and uh the convert our prayers as many of the saints around the world in canada that are familiar with these stories will be remembering them i will also want for us to bring them before the truth of mercy tonight praise the lord there is uh a prayer need here for for the lady by the name of dawn that is suffering brain and raising and she's in the hospital right now as we talk in a state of coma we want to also remember her in prayer so we have in all of this need with sister jackie not feeling well we want to pray for her brother stephen was called and asked that we remember him he's down with the cold and his little daughter grace we want to pray for them brother jordan also uh convert our prayers tonight and we have all of these needs before us tonight so let's just take our hearts to to the throne of mercy as we as we will remember these knees and i know brother joseph traveled brother ben sent a message that couldn't be in service tonight and and all the different ones that are streaming into the service we're going to remember them uh but andrews told me he and his wife will be traveling on the weekend so let's also remember them in prayer let's just buy our house now as we would just have a little communion with the father tonight have the little communion with the father from the beginning of this weekend i've been caught up into uh a testimony of uh of a woman back a few years back and she was in a muslim country of pakistan and she was a woman of a very high class life she was from a wealthy family a ruling family but god met her in a very supernatural way and her testimony just been so tremendous tremendous testimony and i mean there's different supernatural things that god did to be able to get her attention but she entitled her testimony i dared to call him father and when i realized what she what she got her the title of that from she started reading the bible and she was reading both the bible and the quran she was comparing them as she was reading and things from the bible one of the first thing that struck her in the bible was when she read the story of the woman caught in that doctrine and she knows what the muslim law will require there she knows what a sharia law will require of a woman caught in a doctrine so she said when that portion of the stricture caught her attention she froze on her bed because in her mind she was preparing to know what it was what was going to happen to the woman but as she continued to read the bible and she came to the place where jesus spoke to her accuser and say he that is without saying take the first stone and she saw how the story ended she said i could not believe my imagination she said this man jesus must be a different kind of a prophet because the quran speak of him being the prophet and right in there there was not a conviction she was just reading because she needed information and then one day she went to a catholic hospital when her little grandson was now well when she went to the hospital she met oh she met a catholic nom dear okay it was catholic hospital so they started talking and the catholic nun was surprised to see her carrying the bible and when he started talking and you know she was sharing with the catholic nuns she's reading the bible and the different things because supernatural things started happening around her but she couldn't put it together she didn't know what it was so she said that lady leaned over to her and said just speak to him like your father she said just speak to him like your father yes and she said she could not imagine it she could not imagine that was what she named the book i dare call him father you know because and i would say the christian religion is the only religion that teach us because the only time where a prayer were taught to approach god as father was when jesus was teaching his disciples praise the lord and she said as she drove back home she was thinking about it call him father her father has passed and she was love of her father just like abigail and she said thoughts started flowing through her mind the good memories she could remember of her father the time they would play together and you know and and the different things as she walked as she drove back home she said she got home she went into her room and she knelt down and she put those precious words on her lips father she said when she said those words there was a warm feeling that came in the room and she could identify that feeling with the many supernatural things that were happening around her life and then she knew that god was dealing with her all of those times but i'm telling you i mean i was just i was just flooded with with the same presence oh i cried behind my wheel when i drive and i mean uh just to see how god makes himself real because he's a real god yes he's not a he's not a god of imagination he's real his presence can be felt he can talk he have ears he can hear praise the lord let's buy our heads tonight let's buy our heads tonight tonight reach out and touch the lord let's sing the chorus tonight and we can bring these needs to the lord in prayer oh yes jesus not too busy too [Music] all your needs as he goes by yes reach out and touch the law i see passes by oh you will find it's not too busy to get your heart crying he is [Music] out and touched along [Music] [Music] let's go to the lord in prayer tonight i believe we can call him father tonight you can call him papa god you can have an intimate expression tonight not a god that is far away off the one that is so nearby every time we put his name on our lips his present is so real oh hallelujah

read the promise tonight praise the lord automatic goal itself amen praise the lord saint john it's in john chapter 14. seen john chapter 14. we serve an awesome god yes amen yes praise the lord we serve an awesome goddess he's a wonderful father he's been good to us and we can ask for anything less amen john chapter 14 let's take verse 12 and 13 to 9. it's in john chapter 14. we're being kind of for speaking sunny day on uh the family name and family resemblance will take a little bit on the resemblance tonight uh we just read the scripture yet and read a few close to you the time has already gone i was kind of a little bit overburdened with some of these needs to date especially with the things there in south africa and i just thought that it'd be a good thing for us to spend some time before the lord and standing with uh those believers amen praise the lord tell you a little testimony about brother babes but let's read the word tonight verily verily i say unto you that's verse 12 of saint john chapter 14 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than this shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever yeshua asks in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son if yeshua asks anything in my name i will do it have we asked tonight in his name yes we can surely believe that he will do it amen praise the lord he said we can we cannot we cannot hold back to action his name because it's the family name amen when you realize that the blessing it is to be associated with the name of jesus christ even if you don't have nothing to say just say the family name amen father acts we ask your blessing upon the portion of your word that we have read tonight in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed amen praise the lord amen now years back uh years back i think that was that was back in uh uh 2006 i was over in south africa and that was that was the first time i heard about blood of babes and have a tremendous testimony he just just got married and i think when he just just had his first child and just a young preacher too he was pastoring an assembly at the time and i just had his first baby and he was traveling to another town he tried to recollect the story here and but it's it's a it's a popular story in south africa every south africa believer is edified by the baby story and uh so he was hitchhiking when some robbers came and uh they were they were being uh looked for by the police but then they pick him up now he didn't know what was happening got in the vehicle and before they could get to the to the next time the vehicle was stopped they were arrested i think one of them ran away or so and he was arrested with one or two whatever the case was but he was arrested and then he never felt no guilt in him he never felt you know anything didn't even know what was happening before he realized these guys has either robbed a car or you know and stole in a car or something like that and then uh what will happen is that i mean but dave was so relaxed he told his story how he got on the car and the police that were there write the record and saw well you know if you just jump in this car i mean there is nothing to be afraid of you know so uh as the story will go there was a date there they were supposed to be uh uh persecuted come back to the court but because bert babe really never saw uh he never saw the the weight of the danger so he never he never looked for a lawyer and and maybe hoping that the police that did the arrest who have been there you know or something like that but it turned out that he was persecuted you know with the robbers and he was sentenced to praising if i can if i can rightly collect i think it was something that was going to be about maybe is it 20 25 years something like that and that's how he found himself in praising but you know uh uh you know he said he preached a message after he came out of praising he says he never he never said a sentence he said the purpose he said he served purpose he never said a sentence because he rocked the praising and brought many of the gang's guys to a conviction i mean even uh the the the the prison guys and all the dead i was there that year brother brother brother david the pleasure junior was going to take me to the praising uh to see brother babes i remember coming back from from pier by possible elizabeth port elizabeth i just preached for his dad and he was bringing me back and we were making plans to go and see brother bates but i think that weekend uh there was something that was going on because uh the saints have started you know uh taking message box and materials to the praising and uh computers you know and and there was a serious prison ministry that was going out there and with with all of the changes you know the effect of the law through uh brother babe's life and his ministry in the praising uh reduce his sentence you know and uh uh i don't i don't think this is what the george said but if i was the george this is what i would saying if this man is a robber that's the kind of a robber we need out there amen praise the lord but they realized that no they got the wrong man in the prison because i mean he rocked the praising amen before he left from there there was a church in praising amen so yeah i mean he had a tremendous tremendous testimony and i mean just to know that he was he was put awaiting from his wife his family his church and uh i think he he said i think five year old over five years something like that i don't have my number straight but uh it does not matter how many years he spent there it's what the lord did there amen praise the lord and and i mean it's it's kind of for the great loss you know kind of for the great loss that uh that the lord i mean that happened there but you know our loss is his gain amen praise the lord our loss is his gain that's why paul says praise the lord so i was i was kind of a following uh memorial service today it was it was just emotional but we want to thank the lord we want to thank the lord and and blessed be the name of the lord amen praise the lord what a wonderful savior we serve amen what a wonderful savior we serve he's so amazing amen our god is faithful praise the lord our god is faithful praise the lord i was looking at something today and he was talking about family resemblance i prefer to uh physical similarities here between closer relatives especially between parents and children and between siblings and uh you know i was trying to take those things from the natural and compare it to the spiritual but i realized that i have i have about 15 minutes to do it tonight amen praise the lord are you ready do you have your seat belt on amen praise the lord we will just trust that he can be able to lift us up in his presence amen praise the lord but we've been talking about this uh uh uh amazing thing uh of of of of family resemblance amen is is such an amazing thing you know that the power of the blood amen the power you just think if if if the natural blood if the natural human blood of of our parents is able to produce a resemblance unto them what would the blood of god do [Music] what would god's own blood do for his children amen if the natural blood of our parents not only resemblance they are they are i mean they are traits of our parents praise the lord amen the only thing that the baptising of the holy ghost does is to destroy the curse that's all the baptising of the holy ghost destroyed the curse that runs in our family line but it does not take habits away there are some habits that we have of our father of our parents i know i do i've chewed my lips i know that's that's from my dad praise the lord there are sometimes when i laugh i catch my mama as soon alive i see her face and it just sounds like her in my ears the new birth does not take our family traits away no i know i have to i i had to talk that over with some brothers and and and it was i mean referring to uh that quote brother branham said over there in in in paradox and and some people believe that the new birth take our family tree no the new birth only destroyed the curse that's what the baptism of the holy ghost does if the neighbors were taking our family trace away we would have children they would know they would look nothing different from us because even our facial resemblance is all part of our of the traits that's in the blood but you think about it tonight think about it if i don't if if nothing is said that that draw you closer to god i hope this won't there if the natural blood of your parents could produce a physical resemblance and there in the book of revelation the bible says we've been loosed by his blood amen what will the blood of jesus by the new birth produce that's one thing i know it will not produce it will not produce a physical resemblance right amen it will not produce a physical resemblance that one thing i know it will not produce it will not produce a physical resemblance yes yes because it's not human blood it's not a fleshly blood let me say it that way so it will not produce a physical resemblance so we are not i mean we're not called to resemble you know what churches want to resemble uh uh want their people to look alike by giving them uniforms to wear by giving them code of others you know let all the sisters tie their heads let all the men sit this way love the woman i mean they try to find a uniform way to make the people look alike that's not what the blood of jesus christ oh praise the lord amen they will not give us because we have to realize that this blood is producing a mystical body it's not producing a physical body is producing a mystical body praise the lord mystical body from all nations around the world every tribe praise the lord i mean you can go down to the darkest village you will still find somebody that have a nature of jesus christ they don't look nothing like you they don't speak the same language with you [Music] but the life of christ runs through their veins when they have experienced the new breath of jesus christ amen amen praise the lord we have to realize it's not the church that is giving birth no that's the reason why don't compel people to be like your assembly the way you do things in your church because it's not your church that is giving birth to those people it's god that is giving birth and he's a god of varieties praise the lord hey amen he's a god of varietage that's why some are taught in the family come on amen amen praise the lord hallelujah it's god that is giving birth we are born of the sea incorruptible which is the word of god praise the lord we are born by the sea incorruptible thank you jesus thank you but every child has a unique way that they resemble the father that's right every child has a unique way praise the lord oh this is the god that we serve yeah amen and then when the body comes together when the mystical body comes together then the full image of the father comes together praise the lord because there in the mystical body there is prophecy there is tons there is vision all the gifts out there amen amen oh praise the lord tonight amen hallelujah praise the lord my goodness amen amen we refer to this on the uh sunday why why why people can keep their victory brother branham says you notice how beautiful it is to go to to go to the bedroom he says i do with my with my little boy i stand there with uh little joseph and with my wife and and we would kiss him from one side of the cheek to the other as we laid him on the bed and i said to mama you know he got eyes something like yours you think about it they are not even from the same parents they are from different parents the husband and the wife different background but yet when they come under they come under that coveted of marriage is able to produce a resemblance praise the lord the wife can look and says just like my mama and the husband look at the same person and say no just like my mama what a mystery what a mystery then what will the life of christ produce what will the life of christ produce are we together oh my goodness i mean you get so stuck in that thought it's just hard for you to get away from it amen as chapter 11 you all know this verse 20 says and when they have found him they brought him unto anter and it came to pass that the whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in answer amen they call them christians because they saw the amount of life praise the lord they saw the way they were living they saw the abandon of life and they were first called christians because they recognized the life that they were living they were all now wearing their hair like christ they were now wearing their sandals like christ even though all the people in the east look alike in the weighted dress and normally that is that is that is think that some one of the things that comes with nation but it was from the way that they were living from their life that they were called christians praise the lord which means uh christ like amen christ like followers of christ they could see they could see the resemblance of all the things that they have heard all the things some of the people there in anchora perhaps might have never met jesus in his ethnic ministry but of all the things that they have heard of this man called jesus now they could see being displayed and these bunch of believers praise the lord amen why because jesus gave them this promise verily i said unto you he that believeth in me the works that i do i mean the works that i do that's where the family resemblance is tied the family resemblance is not in our our physical traits we all don't have to wear white shirt and pull back here praise the lord for us to look alike okay then we can find out the ones that come to good shepherd is the ones that are in white shirt and and black paints the family resemblance is in this the work that i do shall you do also and greater which of course brother branham says more work but you see the thing about it there is that in in a family structure a father he worked so hard he sent his children to school he supported them if he's a fisherman he he teach them a tray to fishing and what is in the mind of the father is that the son all the children will get a better life greater than this you will do that the children will get a better life than what the father had very good amen that's why he invest in them he tried to empower them for them to get a better life for them to go up a little higher so jesus speaking to to us his children the work that i do you will do the same even greater works praise the lord amen if the natural blood of our parents praise the lord you see some you see some some family is just i mean it's it's it's just it's just it's just dripping down the blood the father is a medical doctor the wife is a medical doctor the first son is a surgeon i mean it's just driving down their blood it's there and it's there in in in that in their in that in that family strain ca giving mean ca giving just run down their family stream if the natural blood can be able to produce that then you as a son of god you as a daughter of god his blood amen will be able to produce overcoming life in you his blood will be able to produce sacrificial life in you because that's the thing that is in his blood sacrificial love true overcoming power praise the lord that's the reason why there is no door movement for for a christian because from the first day to the sixth day there was no dull moment for our father every day was he did something and he said it is good and god expect that everyday something will be good in your life i mean the devil can bless you here then he can blast you here and he i mean he can do everything but when you come to the end of your day you should be just like father god you can look back and say it was a good day i really had a good battle today but i didn't give in every day when papa ended his day he said it was a good day praise the lord amen amen you know when when when papa comes home he have all the challenges and all the frustration he don't carry the family into that he looked for some beautiful picture of the day he don't come home and says oh man ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i don't even think i'm going back there tomorrow oh my goodness oh praise the lord hey amen the brother branham in teaching moses he said that was the thing that amram did and i believe personally that's what it it please god that the deliverer should come through him brother branham says after they will be whipped on the field he said when amra comes home he would crawl in the attic and he would get down and say oh jehovah you say to our father abraham your seed shall sow john in a strange land he said and jacob would come and say amram you are tired it was a busy day today he says but i have to call him jehovah amen and pretty soon amra and determination and prayer alive started contaminating the camp the angel of the lord started visiting the camp and every household started praying because it was time for the for the deliverer to come on the scene if the people that are called by my name will humble themselves amen praise the lord oh the lord can take a prayer flame from your life and spread it all over the city amen i'm a physical witness of that amen he can take a prayer flame from your life just like how the the the tabernacle candle is light it goes right down there to the to the fire and one candle back to another god can do the same thing to the life of his people he can spread a praying influence on his people and people that be crying out for the holy ghost be crying now for more of god praise the lord because we see family resemblance in praying the bible say he was leave his disciple find a private place that is something that is in the family resemblance that is the way we resemble the father when we love to commune with him is the likeness like paul said his spirit constrained us is the likeness it's a powerful thing it's a powerful thing it's a powerful thing and just like i said on sunday when science struck the dna court when they struck the dna court they had to reveal a lot of their formal scientific research because there were things there were things there are things in the dna court that without that if we never had that in this time that we are living in the world would have been a scary place amen just like how god had to lose the the the seals the secrets that were in the back part of god's mind that's the same way he had to bring signs to that place praise the lord because god knew the evil that is coming upon the world realize such a word that we are living in with violence amen if we never had a d in the call there would be nowhere to do up topsy i mean with the dna called it had just made investigation so easy fingerprints and that same thing had just made the trace of the bible so easy oh my goodness praise the lord amen the opening of the word the losing of those seals we can we can find satan in all of his tracks amen i mean we can find satan in all of his tracks because and what what did the suit brought to us it was the scene it was the same rather from the first house he was seen rather he was just he was just it was just an immortal he was changing his farm but every time he changed his phone and went to the next edge the dna called picks him up and said he's the one on the white house he's the one on the red house he's the one on the black house he's the one on the pill house god the nicole picks him up so the bride can be able to identify him in all his tricks in all his strengths even when he's tracking us in our mind because she has the word amen and she's been giving power to use the world she knows what to do with the world that's what is making this bride an invincible army because she's not depending on her intelligence she's using the word she's using the word lord what did your word says what that's your verses praise the lord amen you know when you when you get yourself into a material whether you're reading a book or something it just floss your mind it's hard for you to say something without talking about it you know just just you know sharing testimony of that of that lady i mean it was just just so so blessed i mean and and the thing there that was that was so wonderful was if you ever had a closer walk with god and someone is talking about an intimate relationship with god it just it just reflects it reminds you it plays back you say to yourself i have been there before i've been down this road before praise the lord look this bible speaks this bible speaks this bible can speak to you directly this is the word of god this is god amen in print form praise the lord we have a mirror to look for the family resemblance this is the merit of god's word where we go and look for the family resemblance you look out your life you bring it to the word you say do i resemble my father in this way is this a resemblance of my father or it's just my own selfish ways oh it's just my own stubborn ways like sometimes people will take their self-stubbornness as zeal praise the lord they will take it as as as they have a zeal for god praise the lord verily verdi i say unto you he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also greater work than this shall he do because i go on to the father i mean there are a lot of things i could share with you tonight but we we trust that the lord will deal with us but you just think about this if natural blood of our parents can leave family traits in us that we would take to the grave how much more of the father amen that's what brother branham says we came into this world naked but we're not leaving from here naked leaving from here with character we will be enclosed in his character that's the reason why when we get there we will look just like him amen like the scripture says i think it's james that say that we i mean we we don't know what we would be like but when we see him we'll be just like him it is not physical appearance is the character of his word is a character of the word of god that we would take that we would be just like him let's buy our hats together tonight to be like jesus all that i long for is to be like him is that your desire tonight do you really desire to be like jesus do you have that longing in your heart amen let's buy our hairs to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love to be
