first one god bless you since yes this testimony was actually about what went on last week there were a lot of storms that came my way and it you know after brother Darrell came and preached it was a very wonderful moment with the Lord and you know in moments like that after moments like that you can expect anything to happen because the devil is very upset and he's going to come back at you so what actually happened the Monday after that Sunday achieve entered into my car and then they just ransacked I had a lot of valuables in the truck I don't know what it took but a lot of tents were taken so and I had I always keep my wallet some of the times in the truck but for some reason that they I didn't keep it day I don't have much on that wallet by the only concern I had was the company credit card I have which has unlimited funds and if they had taken it it was easy to block it but I was kind of imagining sometimes I would live home are to something to go to wake and I was wondering what would happen if I had walked into them probably they were armed and then they seized you at gunpoint and then they carry you away and who knows what is going to happen so I just saw the hand of God right there and that's the same day in the afternoon I was driving with my wife to go to Danny's place and a truck just left it's lame and then crossed my lane and then went to the next Lane and stopped I mean who does that it was very weird but thank God and nothing happened and I went to whack no that's same night I had two terrible dreams I went to work the following day and I have never been distracted on job like that very day I was so distracted more than 10 times there were terrorism's why everything was supposed to go wrong but by the grace of God it never happened there one time that it happened I was supposed to add some ingredient to a mix which I didn't do ain't had already gone through the system so I just prayed over it and I asked God to sign it and you to win add that whichever way God did it I don't know that you know normally they will detect that downstream on the system nothing was detected and I knew that the grace of God had prevailed that same day there was water 180 degree water I saw it just gushing out I was on a phone which how did I call it these people you know because my identity theft to protect my identity information I was on the phone with them because I don't know what information that people have taken and I went out Kim walked right back into the 180 degree water with my left foot in fact a lot of things happened now the last of it I wouldn't say the last of it I have been through the storm all this week back the last of those series I hung a super sack of corn flour which is 2,000 pounds and normally you will guide it into a hopper and then you take there are two roofs you take the first one out then you take the second one then it will just drop when I was trying to open the Rope it wouldn't open so I used a knife and then I cut open it and then I put out the ropes so I pulled out a rope and the inner rope and a 2,000 pound of coneflower was hanging in the air about seven feet and it didn't come down so I guided it all the way to the hopper as soon as he got there it just dropped that was when I got to know that it was opened but it was just a miracle they didn't just drop on the floor God held it until a go to weight was supposed to be before it was opened and I saw that devil made a move every single time God countered that move we are serving a living God let your faith be in God to put your trust in him

and helping you so a man just appreciate you all so much and he asked me if I would share a couple things from our trip and we drove almost 2800 miles in one week so we had a wonderful time on the road anyway we went down for brother David Wright's memorial service our dear brother that went to be with the Lord and about three weeks ago and so we on the way down we actually stayed at brother Mike Pinkston Mike and Connie pinks and old friends of ours who used to be in our assembly here and they certainly send their greetings a man it was good to be with them again and we actually stayed with him one night on the way down and one night on the way back and we were actually down by a little town called Mount Holly which was in the northwest side of Charlotte North Carolina and we got there in the evening before the memorial service and brother David Wright's oldest daughter Teresa invited those that were coming from out of town to come over they had a little supper there and there was a hole there was a large group from Toronto brother from brother Dan Quayle's Church and also from brother Gerard's Samuel Gerard Church a couple of churches that brother David had really ministered to quite a bit up there probably more than any other Church I think as far as when he traveled he was with them and so and so we had a wonderful time there brother Gerald Hughes and his wife Cheryl send their greetings I hadn't seen brother Gerald since 1990 when we had the appreciation dinner for brother Baird back in December of 1990 so 29 years since I'd seen her brother and so oh my time just goes by so fast and kind of made me feel sad in the sense that to let so much time go by between times of seeing somebody but he and his wife's and greetings and I think they're for the bought he would like to have him up to preach he's an old veteran and he'd like to come up to Minnesota once again so he sends his greetings also brother Dwight Hall some of the Steve sister Kelly he was there for the memorial service and so we had a chance to talk he sends his greetings to the church here he came and preached a couple of times and he he also sings he has this beautiful mellow voice and certainly they had that for the memorial service he and brother Gerald got up there and and saying see the bright light shine of course we all helped him too so a man so he sends his greetings and of course brother Dan quoi sends his greetings also a lot of wonderful brethren we hadn't actually seen Rebekah we hadn't seen her they actually brother David lived up here in Minnesota when we used to go to brother Barrett's church they were here in 1983 1984 so that was the last time I believe that I we had seen Rebekah his youngest daughter so she lives up there right up there in Mount Holly along with her sister Teresa and so um so it hadn't been even longer but since we had seen her and then we after that we traveled up to Toledo Ohio brother John and sister-in-law Fontaine we have spent the day with them and this actually this past Monday they send their greetings brother Paul la Fontaine sends his greeting he and Sharon and of course we're the BLA T has asked with a pole to come up and preach and and brother Paul confess that that he still hasn't fulfilled his obligation and so but yet he still didn't give us a definite day and time that he would be here so but we're coming back he said he would come we just don't know and so brother John had been diagnosed oh it was about I think four or five months ago with four stage cancer and he's doing well and he told us specifically tell everybody that I am a four stage cancer survivor so we were up there in Toledo we'd got there Sunday night and then stayed until Tuesday morning and I would be remiss brother Steve to tell you I was actually we had left there we were heading back through Indiana and I said I had to call brother Steve because Elkhart Indiana is kind of his home stomping grounds from many years ago and so I had to call him and say brother what is that restaurant that you always say that we ought to and I've been there a few times and believe me it's never disappointed amen so I just have to say that we found callaghan's restaurants so if you ever going through Elkhart Indiana you must stop there ordered the omelet potatoes and the pancakes I ate the two pancakes and that was enough I couldn't eat anymore I did pack the rest out the omelet was the size of a small football she absolutely get their money's worth when you go there so but I always thought you know there are different places where I visited it I always look for that that little cafe in a little town and whatever town or deals there's always one where the old-timers get together and I fit right in and so I've done that with most Eva I've been like out in Arizona when there's a place out there up in Sedona and I just had to call him because they had 101 different omelets and I thought I had to tell her the Steve above that so amen so I didn't mean to get on food I hope y'all eat breakfast this morning so any matter but I had to tell him that because I wish brother Steve and sister Kelly could travel like a thot and just be with us there at the restaurant and he told he reminded me of his good friend Marvin and I said well what does he look like and I said and he told me and he's bald thinner than him a little bit taller and so sure enough brother I didn't just get up and I now ask if Marvin was there but I did see a couple of fellows that were bald and had wore glasses and so I went over there and asked him if their name was Marvin so didn't didn't turn out this time but maybe next time so that's all right if they think I'm crazier than then you're right so amen you know we we actually had planned on being in Rockford Illinois on Tuesday night kind of the halfway point between Toledo is in Minneapolis and then stay overnight there and then come back Wednesday afternoon but we saw the weather reports even in Ohio they were saying they were going to be having 50 mile an hour winds on Wednesday and so the oh man I talked about and so we decided to push through we got here we had a beautiful sunshiny day all the way and then when we got here I stopped in my office to pick up my laptop about 5:30 in the evening stopped over at the all DS grocery store faith had told Naomi that it was supposed to start snowing at 6 o'clock p.m. well about quarter after 6:00 she came out of the store it started snowing so we only had 20 minute drive left and I got home and of course then that gave us the opportunity to get up in the morning and shove 10 inches worth of heavy wet snow I just appreciated that a lot so but I'm in good shape not you're working out so a ma'am so I'm just so thankful to the Lord for traveling mercies and again setting greetings from all these folks and I sure appreciated your prayers and I'll tell you what it's good to be home amen anything else honey that I missed oh yeah that's someone that I'm gonna hold that you know I just son the way back naomi was reading a book about Martin Luther to me while we were driving along and I just got into this train of thought where I just had just a flood of thoughts just thinking about home and where's our real home I just I got so I'll just start about weeping and but there's some oh my heart that I you know I'm gonna save because I've got a burden on my heart now for something and so and I'd like to share some time so actually already got my sermon notes ready to go and but there's something on my heart and so when it's a fitting time will perhaps have that opportunity to share that with you so but God Bless You Saints it's good to be back amen well can we ask you to stand one more time I think we ought to sing we get since I am and I just got to make up for lost time now since I came back maybe wrap with a block anybody in erease this morning you know you worked so hard to get here there's

Lord you know over over in the book of Job job chapter 37 when God came down and he started asking job about you know stand up like a man and where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy you know there was one question he asked joke and that's why I was going to preach him last night was do you know the treasure of the snow amen the snow has a treasure amen so and then I started looking into daring I mean it's just there are just some beautiful things that you can learn through the scripture and about the snow remain and after that you will not hit the snow so much praise Allah amen but I was just talking with some of the brothers back there we don't know what the weather is going to be the thing the snow is coming down so we will have the service this morning and just excuse you

the Lord take our Bibles in the Book of collusion amen right after the bulk of Philippines let's take read chapter one praise the Lord Philippians chapter 1 unnecessary collusion chapter 1 reading from verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light now you have to know these things are not in darkness they are in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and ikeda is the kingdom of light in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created which are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or power all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Amen efficent chapter 5 efficent chapter 5 you praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 5 let's read verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and why see there she reverence her husband this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church let's pray together Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Oh God we want to ask your help this morning Oh father and Sui as we come Lord God in approach your word we want to just ask your special blessing of father God in you come in bless us this morning speak to us out of the pages of your word father Oh precious lord let

again we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus it's good to see brother Daniel back there and his wife and and big son here praise the Lord amen amen I want to speak a little bit on preeminence this morning I want to speak on preeminence this morning well what I would like to take over from from invisible Union if you've been following the tape just before the reading of the of the scripture brother Branham said this he says now in in Romans 7 trusting that you have your Bible open everywhere now across the country we want to reclose Lee this message out of year it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it really isn't I mean he says to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last day amen then he's talking here on invisible Union and he's going to talk about the union that is between Christ and his bride and and he's taking now Romans chapter 7 and many of us we are off familias with Romans chapter 7 it was in Romans chapter 7 where Paul spoke about a year and he says know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the Lord how that the Lord hath dominion over a man as long as he lived for the woman which heart and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband and so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if the husband be dead she is free from the law so there she is no adulteress though she be married to another man now so really from this trip sure that's what he's looking at and he's saying that in one sense it looks like a stripper that these with marish and their vows wish of course we go to that scripture many of the time when we want to you know we want to settle a problem of whether someone can get married again or net but you said he says the other poor being a prophet of the New Testament he's speaking on this and in one sense is a prophecy for the church in the last day and that is the reason why I think that that is that is a tense giving message for us because we can be grateful amen we have to know that God is obligated to his word he praise the Lord amen and God is bound by his own world praise the Lord now so if the Lord of God required both in the physical sense or the spiritual sense there that a woman wish of course types the church I have Elijah was asking me last Sunday you know he had some few questions to come and ask me you know how can we the brothers be the bride when the bride is a woman amen praise the Lord I thought that was interesting for a young man amen and also we had a little talk on there but we we the bride you know of Jesus Christ and and and knowing that it was that's the reason why brother Branham see a prophecy in this age in this last age because it was going to be in the last age that the bride was going to be called praise the Lord Brahe was not going to be called in in the age of the reformers praise the Lord and I want you to pay attention to me this morning because they are just some few things I would like to go down the line in and and that's what I want to speak on on preeminence this morning you know I have a little note here that I wrote down as mine inspiration the lack of preeminence taught to the Lord that's why we have a lot of impersonation of Christianity praise the Lord Amen because you see a woman can impersonate to be the wife of a man praise the Lord and she can dress like you know like like like like the wife she can try to do everything like the wife but she would just be impersonating but the requirement from from the scripture but a lot of God it would take a wife you know to to be able to give the husband preeminence cry supposed to take her preeminence on the bride but it would take the wife to give him that place he's not going to force it that's where it is that's where the mystery is he's not going to force himself upon you when you have come to that level in your relationship with God were you are a bride you will be glad for him to have the first place in everything you do brother Branham say he's a gentleman he don't abuse his wives amen whatever place you gave him he would gladly take it but he deserve the first and the best praise the Lord but if you put him in the back seat he will he would gladly ride in the back seat praise he put him in the trunk he might get there and he will even be in the trunk and keep you safe along the road that just how love it he is even though he deserve the first and the best well whatever place you give him he would take so that the thing about the mystery of preeminence it is it is the it is the man cries to have preeminence on his church on his bride but the mystery is that is a woman that is going to give him that place for him to take preeminence that's what Paul says I speak this as a mystery concerning Christ and the church I will together so he says here that Paul speak of this as a prophecy to the last date church for a year is giving an illustration out out of the scripture about the Lord and grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce so he's taking Lord in grace how grace how on the Lord under the Lord of God we were born in sin shifflett in iniquity come to the word speaking lies amen praise the Lord so by our natural birth we were we were we were born and and and condemned by the Lord of God praise the Lord now so this is word the illustration comes in where it becomes a prophecy it's in a place that by our natural birth we are born under the Lord of God and a lot of God required death as a penalty for scene Fraser law and we were born with that nature in us and now the Lord of God here requires that the first husband must be dead before we can be married praise the Lord so when grace comes in are we together when grace comes in and we been saved by grace which is God's love the love of God at Christ as pain I mean that's what grace is it's God's love at crisis Ping's the love of God comes in and God by grace save you amen so in another sense what grace is doing grace is destroying grace is killing the first husband bridge is is subjecting the first nature that dominated your life and until you are there that's the reason why we must be born again is not a church membership unless you are dead you cannot go into another marriage you can go into another marriage with Christ that is the reason why people play church they don't make it don't make no sense to them because the reality of grace have that sundown yet they are not really honest to what God is doing how we together so when grace comes in for year giving an illustration in the scripture about loading grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce the passage is very sullen apprec-- on because is more or less 13-2 like marriage in divorce but is also Pat into a greater portion of marriage and divorce and how there he is trying to sit in all the year as a church we can no more be married to the word that thinks of the word and to Christ at the same time you are just impersonating that you are a bride you are not a blind until the first man is dead you are just impersonating he's trying to sell in all the years us as a church we can no more be married to the word in Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it amen then it can be for a woman to be living with a husband why she she got a living hospital praise the Lord now you see that is the reason why invisible Union is a tense giving message to see what God has done for us praise the Lord by nature and by nature we are Gentiles we we are right down from from idolatry other worshipers we will worship anything we will wash him anything that's the reason why when a man does not have a real true born-again experience with Christ you know they can put anything before crimes because Gentile by nature we worship anything praise the Lord but to see that God in His mercy will step down in you know show us his love praise the Lord brother Branham says he would take the reign of America favor and slip it down our hands amen he would say that that he will you he would justified us and says you had never done it in the first place and as all of those things that were being brought in this message to just show how much we can be thankful that this is not just by church affiliation it's not because you say no I'm not a Baptist or a merriday and now in a message that makes you a bride are we together so we can be thankful for these things praise the Lord amen and those are some other things we want to look at this morning in and trust that the grace of God who helped us you know there he he talks in that message about your modal experience reading Romans chapter 7 in running running down the street asking for grace you know asking for grace he when he read that you know God just show a revelation to him you know most and people read the scripture him in pretty soon it brings other people into the picture and they're not even able to apply to themselves you know but the omadi saw grace rescuing him amen from from from the lord of sin and death but who have condemned him he ran down the street asking for grace do you know grace amen Amazing Grace praise the Lord Amen and that's what we want to talk about this morning I just want to travel with you a little bit and you know we're coming to to the close of another year then and the Lord has been good to us and you know different things but we have to know that you know the more we travel in this life the closer we get to the coming of the Lord every day brings us closer to the coming of the Lord praise the Lord and we want to make our call in our election show every day every moment every opportunity we have we want to make sure you know that we have we have put everything in order we have the blood on the lintel of the doorpost you know we have we just have everything you know we have everything unpack to get out of this place amen amen glory be to God so we will just be looking at some few things here as we as we as we just look at this you know I mean I've been thinking about that or through the weekend thinking about preeminence and to know that is is is a 3/4 mystery you know crisis the measure of gore evil it's a 3/4 mystery of one goal and and the first mystery was God to reveal himself and in the second one it's after he had make himself known to his people is to also have preeminence now you can see that over in Exeter when God told Moses to build a tabernacle he stole Moses the Moses you build a tabernacle because his desire was to come down and dwell among his people praise the Lord Amen the reason why he wanted that tabernacle was to have his presence and mourn his people praise the Lord that's the reason of the of the of the tabernacle and you know and and that is God greater sense of achievement when God can have his presence among his people this God we self is not a God I want to be in distance from you know he don't want to be in the distance God don't want you to know him by a secondhand experience he don't want you to have a passed down experience he want you to have a personal experience a daily experience and abiding experience praise the Lord Amen he want to go with you every day he want to dwell with you so I the second full purpose was for him to have a premium eNOS among his people and then the tariff for purpose now you have to realize it would takes the first and the second to be able to fulfill the tail the tail is to get us back to Eden praise the Lord and so when we're talking about a rapture and really in an in an expectation for the rapture then we we we also say in another sense that we want to get back to Eden and we're not going to get back to eating until God gather people that he had the preeminence praise the Lord Amen because their gear in eating there was on Adam and Eve and and go hard about the place word he had the preeminence because everything they were doing was told the desire amen fulfilling God's Word everything they were doing are we together blessed be the name of the law so we just want to take our time a little bit here and let's read this conference 1960 the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get-together call together ministers break down their middle wall of partition church members that will forget the differences between the denominations of churches church members and ministers hold to the Horn of the altar amen we've one Accord and prayed until the fire of God began to fall again go knows that the stubbornness the the indifference of Maine is broke up and godly fear and and brotherly love takes his place in the Hema hot praise the Lord but received a baby get this young me back that is like he's sleeping and he's then you will become salting then the message will have his preeminence in your heart it will have his influence in the city amen we could stream and shout and do whatever we want to it will it will never influence man until they see the life of Christ being projected in you someone who someone whose tender and thankful and forgiving and ready to turn the other side of the cheek to gave a second thought oh go a second mais Christianity in action not just taught from the pulpit but uttered among the members among the pastor's that's when you see Christ living in the church amen praise the Lord the place is born is other autre when people can get back other water in their homes get back at the author on their knees surrounding himself that's where preeminence is born amen so running in ourselves giving up you know our our desires and things that are so dear for to us and you know the ones that you know we tried and we tried and we can't give up just still right other alter that and keep confessing it to God and keep surrounding our house to him praise the Lord you he also said this in the v identification of a truth church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead in all things that he might have the preeminence who is the head of the church Jesus Christ what key Demaryius is a Masonic Edom the church not an organization the church a mystical body to which Christ is the head all I love that walking in the spirit obeying the king foolish to the word precious in the sight of God walking in the spirit missed on us to laugh at all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution praise the Lord amen now when we go back to Christ as the mystery of God reveal we read that a few weeks ago word you know Bourbon talks about how God wrote his word in the lives of his prophets in the life of men and women that he have chosen in the ages gone by he wrote his word in their lives praise the Lord one time he wrote his word in the heavens job and the rest of them could look in the heavens that is the reason why job is the book they have one of the beautiful picture of creation than any other book in the Bible praise the Lord amen it talks about it talks about the heavens in a way that I mean they're just they're just no prophet in the Bible where ever talks about the heavens because the thing about it is that the Zofia was their Bible they look in the heavens praise the Lord amen when clouds are gathering it's so easy for them to see a man on a cherub it's a can you see it I just see clouds praise the Lord a mean and I mean as a season change those men were reading the heavens so when God gave His Word over to his prophets the prophets brought the Word of God to the people now said the Lord and and you know the spoke in the name of the Lord and and an instructor people in the name of the Lord and different things today but yet instead God used the oppression of life I mean he used the oppression of life and things that they were going to be on what the prophesied beyond what the spoke in the name of the Lord God used the oppression of life and in your personal life there was a hidden wisdom of God praise the Lord now I mean this times giving message from brother Branham talks about the bride he talks about her as their elected Lady amen he talks about her as us as the election lady she was a special woman amen the bride of Jesus Christ she is praise the Lord now so for the type of this of this bride I would take a woman that God wrote something in her life and that would be over in the book of Esther praise the Lord we all know the book of Esther and we know the story of Esther praise the Lord the Jewish people love the story of Esther because it was one of the time in the history were the gain a tremendous victory over one that was plotting to terminate him amen the Jewish people have suffered the threat of being terminated for for for ages so the law of this book of Esther praise the Lord Amen but just like we are saying God use people throughout the scripture like you look up you look at the book of Esther you realize yet as you read through the through the through the entire book there was net it's not a verse in that book that somehow brings out brings out innocence or the word God is never used in the book that's one one thing for the fact you know it's never used in the book and it just looks like it was just either all about this woman Esther and her uncle mother kind but reminding you again God in the edges he choose people amen and that is the reason why he wanted people in this age that he can have a preeminence in their life why because once again God is having people that are written episode praise the Lord people that are written I mean a working Bible amen and you see the age the age is is getting more evil and getting more weak I mean wicked and people hearts is going away from the Lord I mean I mean just also some things they are doing in this age once again the god of this evil age has gained his sense of victory in our Supreme Court when once again this nation they have had their first inset marriage abroad marrying the sister and then in the nation and the age the age in general is growing I mean there there are things that are going to happen things are going to happen and that's the reason why God is looking for the people a people that was completely so rather themselves to hear praise the Lord when Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was down there in Babylon there was they were just there was no other Church there was no other religion Babylon was just an adulterous evil nation praise the Lord Amen when children Misha and Abednego was down there in Babylon and Babylon at that time was the superpower of the world Babylon was just like the United States superpower great nation in the world every nation around the world feared him and when the King speaks praise the Lord but there was a little group of people there was a men that was determined not to defy themselves a little group of people and you know the problem there Shadrach Meshach Abednego heart they never had problem with the Babylonians because the Babylonians knew that they were worshippers of Jehovah they higher problem with backsliding Jews back sledding Jews amen they were not ready to stand for the Word of God that were ready to compromise with everything that was where they had problem their problem was with those box lady Jews praise the Lord that would tell them you know that the the Temple of Solomon is now here we don't have no priests to make sacrifices what is the need of worshiping Jehovah there is no preacher to make sacrifices we don't have we don't have the Temple of Solomon yet to go and pray let's just follow them praise Lord oh but there was a Daniel that prayed three times a day even against the Kings come I mean praise the Lord he didn't look for the secret place he opened his window and he make his voice to be heard praise the Lord now you see it was not God impressing himself on those people it was those people determined to give God the preeminence generally they were determined to give God the first place in their lives praise the Lord Amin and after the the the King had his dreaming no one who could interpret the dream Daniel came and interpret the dream the handwriting on the wall and all of those things happen praise the Lord the King bill honey and an image just to get him to compromise build him an image build him a statue okay now we will be owe you an image bill this image in your name dedicated to your God praise the Lord praise the Lord that's the spirit of our age everybody want their name Alby praise the Lord yet Daniel refused he refused you know what he refused he refused safe washing he says if there is anyone that should be worship is God Jehovah God he refused SAP washing me and myself that's the spirit of this age even if I were God on deliver us praise the Lord even if God don't deliver me I will now worship myself praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen you know people like to wash it themselves to go back to their old stories you know oh when I used to be like this oh when I used to be like this praise the Lord then you say if God don't deliver me I will not even wash it myself praise the Lord preeminence amen yeah people you gotta ticular yourself in about yourself oh you got oh yeah you know if you don't take it on yourself nobody would take care of you that was a good thing you gotta take care of yourself amen don't don't be yeah you know there just just don't don't you know don't be careless about yourself praise the Lord but the first person is Almighty God he deserved the first place Amen so we see that you know Dania he went through his age he was able to give God for him eNOS you know and and if you go through the scripture right from Eden right from Eden Adam who have never been successful if he didn't give God the preeminence the secrets of all the prophets through the ages even the secret of brother Branham in his ministry wants to make golfers praise the Lord Amen and if you want to be successful in your Christian life you got to learn that principle of putting golfers that's that just that was just a secret right through the ages he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me I mean that is the secret of Christian life is no longer I the laborer Christ I live we must women we must talk about him we must praise Him we must magnify him we must serve Him praise the Lord so you know what happened the aired when when Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you are know the story when this true for God and even refused to worship themselves and say even if I were God don't deliver us we wouldn't I would not wash it myself amen I will not praise myself I would have and I don't know what a woman need to be mentioning this praise the Lord and God saw that there those those those young people were determined to give him the preeminence that he will make himself known as God when you give God the first place God will surely take the first place and he will show himself above everything and he came down in the midst of the fire you know the story praise the Lord Amen I believe if I you know the King dear belchy shares are whichever one of them was the enabling NASA whichever one you know called Daniel to a meeting and say well but I don't understand you my friend you know you interpreted the dreams and everything right that that image is in honor of you why you want to make the thing difficult I just I just see you know young daniel looking at the face of the king and says well you know king with you know no disrespect to you but i think it's my god that i want to be worshiping man it's my god that i want to be glorified not me now man ability praise the Lord trying to push the thought of preeminence here so you be able to see it Amen that's that's what God that's what God desire from the people that we just so rather give him the first place let's go to the book of Esther a little bit here I could take all the time here Oh glory be to God amen now the book of Esther year has a very beautiful picture that I want for us to just read together and instead it a little bit year now the the book of Esther open open up wafer they came desiring Vashti his wife to come praise the Lord and and the scripture says that shows that she refused to come to the king's bidding are we to get him amen we have to realize that is you know it was it was customary those days were in royal polish the king has the King chamber were were heed words and he take care of everything that he has to take care of and and and the Queen is also in the same Palace but she also over in another chamber and you know she take care of things that she has to take care of and and there was a time where the King will desire his wife to come amen now you have to keep in your mind what we're dealing with here is preeminence Christ and his bride amen that's what we're dealing with so as as Vashti this you know Queen refused to comes to the king's command right there it was she was destroying you know the image of the ones that they ruled over the nation I mean she was showing the you know destroying reference to the king praise the Lord Amen so because of their the King councillors who advised him that she thought the soup would wash it away you know the shapour away this is a disgrace you know she being the quaint that the quaint when the King request of her she should come so meeting herself because that's the way she is going to influence the rest of the lady you have read the scripture before and you know exactly what it is he meant now so we see in them that because of their the Queen that the king is now going to make a request to have to have a new wife he's going to make a request now you know all the young version in the in the province the young virgin in the kingdom to come and present themselves praise the Lord hallelujah amen and then all the all the young virgins you know what went over you know and and the king will give them somebody do you know that would be the a caretaker that will be their you know their custodian to take care of them and get them ready and all of that as we look through the scripture year now you see God year this kind of for writing out something and and and and in all through the ages you know like I said the Jewish people love this and people will read the story about Esther but you see there there are something of God's divine wisdom that I hear right in the pages of the book I've tried to try and just trust that along with just help us now as we will you know try to bring this out and then right there we see that this young Jewish woman now Esther she was under the guidance of her uncle Mordecai T man and he and he heard that now remember now you just remember this was after the Lord of Moses and a lot of Moses also required that there should be no Jew be able to give his daughter to a Gentile man Amen or gave his son over to a Gentile woman and now they're in the Ghent I kiddin amen and here is a request of a gent I king praise the Lord amen are you seen the hidden wisdom of God praise the Lord something that that the maja bloke contrary to God's Word but yet is going to run right down the peph a will of God because his hidden wisdom is in it are we together and Molokai called his his little nation and said to her well did you hear that the King needed young women to go down oh yeah I heard about it but you know Papa maybe she could call him Papa because he was just like a dad to to her I'm a dude amen then he's trying to talk to her and and let her know that oh he's honoring his guidance and he will allow her to go and we know the story how she went through and as she came over to the king's chamber even the custodian that was given to her found favor in her side amen praise the Lord that I want I want to bring us over to chapter 2 here let's look to chapter 2 a little bit here there was something I was telling last night I was so beautiful now there were many other women many other young ladies that there came to the king praise the Lord many other young virgin that came to the king and wore them preeminence he had a little baby and the scripture says from verse 3 then let the King appoint officers in all the provinces and the kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins in Shushan the polish told the house of the women and in the custody of Haggadah the Kings Chamberlain keepers of the women and let and let their thing thing for purification be given to them praise the Lord amen okay let's drop them down to verse verse 12 now when every meeting term was come to go in to King has a serous after that she had been 12 months according to the model of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished wait six months with or of mirth and six months with sweet altar and wave other things for the for the purifying of the woman then dust came every meeting unto the king whatsoever she desire was given to her to go go with her out of the house of the women on to the king's chamber in the evening she went praise the Lord now you have to know that if you bring this over to the church ages the messenger of every age comes in the evening time amen and as the messenger of the age he takes the people of their age to the Lord in the evening time amen it keeps it keeps the the order of creation from the evening to the morning was the first day from the evening to the morning was the second thing amen so it starts in the evening time now this young medium was taking after her purification and everything she was taking over to the king's chamber in the evening time now you watch how the scripture what makes it a little bit beautiful year for us in a evening she went and on the morning she returned into the second house of the women told the custody of shochet gasps the Kings Chamberlain which kept that which kept the concubines praise the Lord she came in on to the king normal except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name praise the Lord now I was looking into in today's last night what I said I was telling you last night was I was telling you see all through the scripture David hi concubines and and and and and and Solomon have concubines in and that word is used over in the scripture as I was studying this and trying to apply a tool to the church and trying to apply it to what God they throughout the ages of reformation even down to our age I went back I started studying a little bit like a poor brought a little bit of death over in Romans chapter seven worried about the way he brought it was he spoke on the sense of between the wife and the virgin where he was going to talk about you know if a woman married a man and I don't believe in and she want to serve the Lord and you know there's nothing that stopper and out of that he went into death but then I was trying to look how what was the difference between the concubines and the wives praise the Lord because it was a culture that was held all through the ages now so as as you studied in as you even see right here in the scripture the Bible says that this young women would come into the King in the evening time and on the morning he was given over to talk to one of the caretakers and she would take her right down to the to the other house the second house and their house was the house of the king's concubines and she came normal she came normal to the king until when he thinks about her once in the wine and he sent for her it just is just he thinks about how she comes and and she well she goes back into that you see God in a way that he works through the church ages it was almost the same thing when on the days of pentecost you know and then after the first church was born and and the the jewish church that went in the influence the birth of the gentile church in Acts chapter 10 and then we realized and the church age went from the first church age to the second church age and then to the Terr church age it got down into a dark period praise the law and after that that period God started raising man of there were reformers great men that were also blessed to be able to revive the people like Luther Wesley and all of those people but you see after every church had an experience with God the messenger would come on the scene and he would brings the people there will be a move of God amen something that will move the people just like Luther putting those theses on the church and then I mean calling out the things that the Catholic Church was doing trying to bring the people back to the Bible praise the Lord and God will bring every vibra among the people praise the Lord it was a true revival it was a move of God among the people praise the Lord but after a little why the people will go right back into the things that they were doing before they will go right back to that all Catholic teachings and doctrines so what happened in that type like we see right here in the book of Esther the church is put in the house of the concubine once in a way that will have a revival because God move with them praise the Lord and the scripture was speaks then the next evening another young woman will be brought over to the king until the morning he was send her over to the second house praise the Lord I love when the scripture plays this thing out verse 15 now when the turn of Esther the doubt sort of I beheld the uncle of mother Kai who have taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she requested nothing but what had got the King's Chamber Chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and Esther our team favor in the sight of all them that look upon her praise the Lord so when Esther was sticking onto King has Osiris into his house Roya in the tenth month which is the month of Tibet in the seven year of his reign amen remember years back when I used to preach this I always preached 10-7 amen then I gave the young people running all over the place and the King loved Esther above all the women and she attained Grace praise the Lord Amen she attained grace are we together and favor now that was the only thing that was special it was Ned it was near her physical appearance she attained grace amen she attained Grace and favor in the sight in his side more than all the virgins so that he said the royal crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of Vashti and the King made a great feast now when you go back and you see that is the thing that's separated the wife from the virgins the Jews call it the removing of the veil amen praise the Lord all of the Jewish law dear tradition is that a man can love a woman and take the woman to his house or take the woman to him as a wife but when there was never the removing of the veil she was never considered a wife now for for them to remove the veil they have to follow all the Moorish Paulinus praise the Lord like I said like I said to you here before marriage in the scripture has never been a secret thing right from the beginning everything is brought right before the elders of the city everybody knows about it praise the Lord Amen you know and and and and the devil has a way of working and his way of working is always to isolate people amen if he can get you into isolation and think that you are doing something in secret I'm doing a secret thing and when I bring Allah everybody will be surprised praise the Lord that is his way of working glory be to God I was talking to one young woman and I taught I say sir you know we talked a little bit and I just told I says well you know well if you look through the scripture that's what the Bible says there nothing secret about this praise the Lord Amen if you fulfilled if you fulfill the right because before they come down to that fish that called the removing of the veil all the rights you know you know your your parents and everything that has to get involved in it praise the Lord now a woman that was taken as a concubine does not have to go through this right now do you see why marriage had never been successful in our age praise the Lord in this age word young people are just feeling their minds from all the things that Hollywood is giving to them now Facebook has come on the same they can get that and they will be talking to this person and it will be talking to that person it will be talking all over the place their parents don't know that nothing about it nobody is guiding them and it get they are emotional all Weaver in an internet sensation praise the Lord Amen same thing with the church the church comes true that that that experience it's a constant it's it's an ongoing experience you don't have to make your pass your hero what I used to be this what I am now praise the Lord O because the I young woman can sit right there in the house of the concubine it's you know when I was in a king palace man I saw this thing when you see the design on the wall maybe when you left from there they change it maybe when they put you outside they took that picture down and they hang another one up praise the Lord if you are living in his presence every day you will be talking about what is happening everything praise the Lord that's what you see a person comes into a concubine experience with the Lord when we can just only talk about the past Christ Wang a deal it experience with his people with his bride a daily a preeminence over our live we are we are praising him we are submitting ourselves to him well you say that they never had an experience with God every age had an experience of God amen but he allowed their experience to die out with main steel logic and mains reasoning when he tried to take all the holiness out of the church and feed the church with just geological ideas praise the Lord there was nothing special about Esther and there's nothing special about you and myself is the grace of God for God to open your eyes to the message of your day the message of your age is the grace of God to see God's tear we were in out your hearts they're dealing with your heart still checking on your heart praise the Lord people can sit in church in there yeah I mean the walk right out of the church that goes right into things not nocardia conscious is not alive but you have a living conscious praise the Lord tell a lot is just like you want to take your tongue out of your mouth and throw it away what is that grace and favor it's not something you can boast about praise the Lord it's something that God has brought your way and you know what we try to do sit on the bish and make it this grace out of faith young people sneak in doing things amen you're just gonna troll yourself in the house of the concubine you can talk about the profit you can talk about the message but when there is no living experience with you you might be sitting in the house of the concubine praise the Lord once and once in a while you think about the goodness of the Lord and then you cry and then you go right back into into what you are doing he wanted la experience with his people people on earth that would give him the first praise in the morning praise the Lord when the eyes open to give him the first place to give him the first of the strength they would give him the first of their soft things praise the Lord now that's the mystery like I said that is the mystery amen now as you read in the book of Esther you see another beautiful picture that plays out after she became King I'm a queen the the Jewish people God honored the intimidation of a man I wanted to get rid of them praise the Lord amen and as you read the scripture says it was just about that time were it was not time for Esther to go in the presence of the king now if you see it if you if you just if you just keep preeminence in your mind amen giving preeminence Molokai has spoken to her and to her well this is what is happening yes sir and you have to know that you also you are a Jew amen maybe the Lord in His infinite wisdom that knows everything saw that we will have come to this very place and for this reason he place you into the kiddo praise the Lord I mean his his hidden wisdom that will put us at a particular place or put us in a particular situation with without you having a full idea of why but when things ready to play out then you say oh my goodness glory be to God she said Molokai not been to the king because he had that car for me praise the Lord I have to wait by the Lord of the median in the persons I have to wait the king have to call before I can go over to his chamber but she said tell the people of the Jews to pray for me if I Darren let me die praise the Lord and we know how the story play out she went out there and when when the King saw her coming even for God he thought that among us even pass amen he thought that the man has passed he have not seen his wife for this long praise the Lord but that's of people there has relationship with your maker you don't have to wait for the Wednesday service praise the Lord you don't have to wait for the Sunday morning praise the Lord Amen the best time to go when it's when you don't even feel like you want to go then you get down on your knees people that would give him pretty minutes make him first in their life praise the Lord now better Bannon brought a little bit of that out in the message marriage in Davos and when he talks on this subject he went in using some extreme languages when he talks about trying to bring out the picture writing the air of Christ and his bride and then he reminds us that wish you remember what he did to Vashti amen and we should remember that he can do without us praise the Lord that he can do without you but we can do without him praise the Lord you have to remember that he made us amen if there is anything good in you he gave it to you praise the Lord and if we will not take what he gave to us to bring worship and bring appreciation to him he gave it to us he made us verb and says that was what she did she refused we have to know that we were made for his pleasure I mean he made us for his pleasure to do with us as it pleased him Lord be to God that is the reason why every son and daughter of God that's born again there is always that desire in our heart wanting to do something for the Lord we want to do something for the law we want to we want to wait we want to be an influence that he will use us to bring somebody closer praise the Lord or some people think they suffer for the oscillation they need to protect it and it just so happy they're a Christian and so happy their family is a Christian and sometimes it becomes a difficult thing we become selfish in a way that we live our Christian life will become self center you know whenever self is coming there that's a dangerous thing praise the Lord amen whenever self is coming there in the picture we have to wash up people if there was anything that we can be thankful for God by His grace amen I love you Amy praise the Lord he is showing grace you have shown favor to you praise the Lord and now you think about it what he could do if you just put him in his rightful place if you just allow God to be the Lord of your life if you just come to the place where there is doubt there there is nothing that can come between your soul and your Savior praise the Lord our God is a jealous God and you must be jealous that there was there will be there is nothing that would come between your relationship in God not a person not a system musicians you can comfort this morning well nothing come between that was sold and I will save you God [Music] [Music] [Music] as bad way haze [Music] just think about all that he has done for us his love is mercy [Music] when Eliezer went to get Rebecca the Bible says when the chera came closer [Music] and she saw a man standing on the field [Music] she took her veil and she Troy over her face [Music] because she wanted to go to the one that she loved without veil over her face [Music] sometimes we allow the things of this world we allow to take the whole evil away when we're supposed to ourselves to things that we should matter suppose I myself [Music] when the seals were open 1963 God took the veil from over his bride the Bible is no longer a real book the scripture should not be a
