[2:01] and this David a man after God's Own
[2:04] Heart had 500 watts
[2:12] see what I mean
[2:14] David with his 500 wives Solomon with
[2:17] his thousand and Solomon is the son of
[2:20] David in the natural which represents
[2:22] Jesus Christ the son of David and the
[2:24] spiritual but that's natural sex life
[2:26] this is going to be spiritual created
[2:28] why created amen that's the way it was
[2:31] at the beginning but not now in this
[2:33] life we live in now
[2:36] notice
[2:39] don't fail this now take it all down to
[2:41] your hearts
[2:42] but not one of those women could even
[2:46] have one more husband
[2:49] amen
[2:51] he's original creation not her
[2:56] not one of those women could have one
[2:58] more husband
[3:00] but that one husband could have a
[3:01] thousand wives
[3:05] that's thus stay at the large that's the
[3:08] Bible
[3:10] now I've went back took my time and
[3:12] showed you back I don't know what
[3:13] started what Jesus said
[3:15] now do you see it clearly
[3:18] they could have as many oh you say that
[3:20] was just for Israel is it when Abraham
[3:22] took Sarah down into the Philistine
[3:25] country there was a king down there
[3:27] named Emily and Sarah was 100 years old
[3:30] right at it but she had been changed
[3:32] back to a young woman and been made
[3:33] beautiful you know that
[3:35] all right an amalek
[3:38] wanted her for a wife
[3:41] you remember my message on it
[3:44] amalek wanted to take Sarah for a wife
[3:48] probably had a harem
[3:50] but he could not take her if she was
[3:52] married to Abraham
[3:54] so Abraham said to Sarah say that you
[3:58] are my brother because he'll kill me so
[4:01] that he can have you
[4:03] why don't you just Chase Abraham out of
[4:04] the country and take his wife him alone
[4:06] not only Allah was it with Believers but
[4:09] to all people in the creation
[4:12] Center our Sanctuary responsible man
[4:15] for these acts
[4:17] there was a heathen King
[4:21] how many knows that story is true
[4:23] it's a Bible
[4:24] Genesis about 16th chapter I think
[4:28] you noticed
[4:29] Emily would have Tucker for a wife he
[4:32] fixed himself to have this new Hebrew
[4:34] girl and he said this is my she said
[4:37] that's my brother he said that's my
[4:39] sister
[4:40] and everybody said I'll just take her
[4:42] for a wife and could you imagine a man
[4:44] doing a thing like that
[4:46] but it did it and then that night while
[4:49] he went to sleep the Lord appeared to me
[4:51] a dream and said amlik you're as good as
[4:53] a dead man
[4:55] he's protecting that that stream of
[4:57] Jewish blood there you see he said
[4:59] you're as good as a dead man you've got
[5:01] another man's wife you're fixing to
[5:02] marry
[5:04] he said Lord you know the Integrity of
[5:07] my heart
[5:08] said did not she tell me that was her
[5:10] brother did not he himself say that's my
[5:12] sister he said I know the Integrity of
[5:15] your heart
[5:16] that is the reason I wouldn't permit you
[5:20] to sin against me
[5:22] is that right
[5:24] said restore his wife
[5:28] prophet
[5:30] and unless you taking back his wife and
[5:32] let him pray for you not your priest
[5:35] if he don't pray for you a whole
[5:37] nation's gone amen there's Amazing Grace
[5:41] your whole nation's gone that's that
[5:44] man's wife and he's my prophet
[5:47] amen that's thus saith the Lord that's a
[5:50] scripture
[5:51] now we find out
[5:53] death was caused
[5:55] death is the cause of sin of the woman
[5:58] come to the woman and not the man by her
[6:02] way of living her life
[6:05] and by her all death comes
[6:09] her way of giving life is death how many
[6:11] knows that
[6:12] Job 14 if you want to put down the
[6:14] scripture God if you question this I got
[6:17] scripture go down for every bit of this
[6:19] if you don't read Job 14 it says man
[6:21] that is born of woman is of a few days
[6:24] and full of trouble
[6:25] is that Ryan
[6:26] you cometh up like the flower each cut
[6:28] down and waste away and so forth see uh
[6:31] every man that's born of a woman is born
[6:34] in death as soon as he comes but when
[6:35] he's born into the creation of God he
[6:38] cannot die
[6:40] he's in that other tree that was in the
[6:42] Garden of Eden Christ
[6:47] eternal life come by the tree
[6:50] or you say she was a tree Shore well he
[6:53] said thou shall not take of this tree
[6:55] God said in Genesis back there thou
[6:58] shall not take of this tree while the
[7:00] woman is the tree she's a fruit tree
[7:03] you're the fruit of your mother
[7:04] the fruit of the womb as you
[7:08] that's right and then the fruit of the
[7:10] tree of life that was in the Garden of
[7:12] Eden is Christ
[7:13] through the woman come death to the man
[7:16] in the original creation come life
[7:18] the be born of woman is death be born of
[7:21] Christ's life
[7:23] get the hottie
[7:25] that's where now you see where the
[7:27] goddesses went to don't you
[7:32] first Adam and Eve
[7:34] type the second Adam and Eve see the
[7:38] multiplication now the multiplication of
[7:40] Adam and Eve was through sex to
[7:42] replenish the Earth but it wasn't so at
[7:44] the beginning God just made a male and a
[7:46] female like he did his other creatures
[7:49] see
[7:50] legal
[7:52] just like the church
[7:54] now let us in view of these Vindicated
[7:59] truths of God search a little further if
[8:01] you want to
[8:03] all right
[8:04] now this may hurt just a little bit till
[8:06] we get down to the bottom of it I'm just
[8:08] going to show you the truth of it there
[8:10] is no Minister that can marry a widow
[8:15] do you know that
[8:16] you want to read that aren't you getting
[8:19] Leviticus Leviticus 21 7 and Ezekiel 44
[8:23] 22.
[8:27] it'll show you that the priesthood
[8:30] was not to marry a woman that's been
[8:32] touched by man
[8:34] this type is of the Virgin bride of
[8:37] Jesus Christ because they handle the
[8:39] fire of God the priesthood Aaron's sons
[8:43] we haven't got time to read it all and
[8:44] get out but noon we got 20 minutes yet
[8:46] and that was Aaron's sons of the Handler
[8:48] the the fire of God so they could not
[8:51] marry a woman that had been touched by
[8:53] another man
[8:55] the unchanging God said so they could
[8:58] not marry another woman at a woman being
[9:00] touched by a man showing and type here
[9:03] if you want to see it that's the Church
[9:05] of the Living God is purely
[9:08] unadulterated the word of God and not a
[9:11] denomination has been handled by man
[9:15] no
[9:16] let's read this show I want to get this
[9:18] to you Matthew 5 Jesus spoke here of
[9:21] something really of a vital importance
[9:24] we want to see it Matthew 5.
[9:27] I wrote on my I marked out some of the
[9:29] things I was going to say just to the
[9:31] man so I've had quite a little time
[9:32] saying it just before our sisters but I
[9:35] want to go out here now before now
[9:37] sister I want to put you into the place
[9:39] where God's word promised you and you
[9:41] see them you stay in that place too
[9:43] Matthew 5 32
[9:46] I want you to know sure to support this
[9:48] same idea of one in many
[9:53] Matthew 30 uh I think it's Matthew 5 32.
[9:59] 31 to begin with
[10:01] it has been said whosoever shall put
[10:04] away his wife let him give her a writing
[10:07] of divorcement
[10:09] us Jesus speaking once said from the
[10:12] beginning now watch
[10:13] but I say unto you that whosoever shall
[10:17] put away his wife
[10:19] saving the cause of fornications causes
[10:22] her to
[10:25] commit adultery
[10:27] see whosoever shall put away his wife
[10:29] saving the cause of fornication causes
[10:31] her to commit adultery wash your Mary
[10:34] again and whosoever married her and is
[10:37] divorced committed adultery
[10:41] see she's got a living husband so no man
[10:43] can marry her
[10:44] care what she does and who she is she's
[10:46] got a living husband there's no grounds
[10:47] for her at all
[10:49] but it's not for him causes her not him
[10:52] get it you have to make the word run in
[10:55] continuity
[10:56] see nothing's saying he couldn't but she
[10:59] can't
[11:01] causes her not him
[11:05] that's exactly what the Bible says
[11:07] causes her it is not stated against him
[11:11] to remarry but her
[11:14] why
[11:16] Christ and the type
[11:18] notice it is stated that he cannot
[11:21] remarry only a virgin
[11:23] he can remarry he can he can remarry
[11:25] again if it's a virgin but he can't
[11:27] marry somebody else's wife no one needy
[11:30] and if he does marry a divorced woman he
[11:33] is living in adultery I don't care who
[11:36] he is the Bible said whosoever marries
[11:38] her that is put away liveth in adultery
[11:42] there you are
[11:44] not no divorces
[11:46] see that Regional back to her from the
[11:47] beginning now
[11:49] remarrying now notice he can but she
[11:54] can't
[11:55] like David
[11:56] like Solomon like the continuity of the
[11:59] whole Bible now same as David and the
[12:02] rest of them now you notice
[12:06] in First Corinthians 7 10 notice Paul
[12:10] commands the wife that is that divorces
[12:14] her husband to remain single or be
[12:18] reconciled
[12:20] not to remarry
[12:22] she must remain single or to be uh
[12:26] reconciled back to your husband she
[12:28] cannot remarry she must remain single
[12:31] but notice he never said about the man
[12:34] see you can't make the word lie from the
[12:37] beginning the sex law by polygamy now
[12:42] the word of God
[12:44] runs true with nature of God runs into
[12:48] continuity see how there is one school
[12:52] went East and the other went West on it
[12:57] you got to come back to the truth to
[12:58] find out what it is it's always been
[13:02] that way that's a regular Covenant with
[13:04] God from the beginning
[13:06] first before the beginning from the
[13:09] beginning
[13:10] there's just one in one
[13:13] after the sin came in then there was one
[13:16] man and a bunch of women
[13:17] run that way in nature every animal
[13:20] and human beings and natural flesh is
[13:23] animal we're a mammal we know that all
[13:25] of us see it's all God's nature and
[13:28] continuity but now
[13:31] that the seals are open the spirit of
[13:33] Truth directs us to the word that
[13:36] explains why all the mistakes has been
[13:39] down to the ages because the seals was
[13:41] not open
[13:42] this was not revealed
[13:44] that's true
[13:46] notice
[13:48] you you can't make the Shadows fail as I
[13:51] preached to you last night about the
[13:52] shadow across the floor it's got to come
[13:55] out right
[13:55] [Music]
[13:57] how could there be a shadow of an
[13:59] elephant coming across the floor and a
[14:00] little bitty spindly man come out to be
[14:02] the elephant
[14:03] or the elephant's a little spindly man
[14:06] now if you'll notice it in perfect time
[14:09] now there is a true woman
[14:13] a true woman virgin that marries her
[14:17] husband and lives that she's a blessed
[14:19] thing to the man
[14:22] if God could have given his son any
[14:24] better thing than a wife he would have
[14:26] given to him
[14:29] but she's designed to be a sex act
[14:33] and no other animal is designed like
[14:35] that no other creature on the earth is
[14:37] designed like that that's the reason you
[14:39] see polygamy
[14:41] because of that that's what brought it
[14:43] in now look in the final analysis look
[14:47] there is one Jesus Christ is that right
[14:51] amen one man God Emmanuel you believe
[14:55] that
[14:56] but the members of his wife are many
[14:59] amen
[15:01] thousands times thousands of thousands
[15:05] is that right
[15:07] his
[15:09] why
[15:10] the bride the church
[15:12] you understand now
[15:14] that's why he said to Adam before sex
[15:17] was ever induced
[15:19] are introduced multiply to replenish the
[15:22] Earth
[15:23] when he was yet in the beginning when he
[15:26] was yet both male and female in himself
[15:29] their shoes and that the bride's got to
[15:32] come from the word
[15:36] the spiritual multiplication
[15:39] multiplications
[15:42] see
[15:44] replenishing the Earth
[15:47] now in the sex acts see the schools got
[15:50] those two things mixed up
[15:53] therefore you can't do it you've got to
[15:55] bring it back to the truth of it
[15:58] in the beginning and at the end there
[16:01] will be one Lord Jesus
[16:04] and his bride many
[16:06] singular
[16:08] you get it
[16:10] there was one David
[16:13] on one throne
[16:16] one king
[16:17] after God's Own Heart with 500 wives
[16:23] all right
[16:25] right
[16:25] Jesus setting on his throne Hallelujah
[16:30] in the Millennium with the wife like it
[16:33] was at the beginning created out of the
[16:35] Earth by the hand of almighty God in the
[16:37] resurrection
[16:39] of many members
[16:41] there you are
[16:43] women struggle to be that
[16:45] come into Christ then you'll not be in
[16:47] that filthy mess out there
[16:49] but as long as you're just a church
[16:50] member trying to live morally good
[16:52] yourself you'll never make it
[16:54] neither can a man make it outside of
[16:56] Christ
[16:57] as Paul went on to say but they're in
[17:00] Christ there is neither male or female
[17:02] they're all one but to get this marriage
[17:05] in divorce straightened out
[17:07] so that you would know which was right
[17:09] and which was wrong now
[17:13] he plainly shows her in these times
[17:15] there is one Christ and many members of
[17:19] that wife
[17:21] notice
[17:22] he can put us away for our spiritual
[17:26] fornications and false Doctrine anytime
[17:28] he wants to
[17:29] but how dare you try to put him away and
[17:32] make it
[17:34] the man can put away his wife and marry
[17:37] another but not the woman put away her
[17:38] husband and marry another
[17:40] see all the shadows and types there
[17:43] perfectly balanced them
[17:46] the original creation
[17:48] not the byproduct nowhere not the church
[17:51] the bride to the word
[17:53] not the woman the man each time that's
[17:56] which never says anything against the
[17:58] man doing it it's always the woman
[18:00] exactly but she
[18:02] can be the bride of Christ by being and
[18:07] remember she being a part of a man the
[18:09] Bible said she can own nevertheless I
[18:11] suffer not a woman to teach or to serve
[18:13] any Authority but to be in silence for
[18:15] Adam was first form then even Adam was
[18:17] not deceived but the byproduct was
[18:19] deceived now we're standing she shall be
[18:23] saved if
[18:26] she continues
[18:28] and Holiness and sobriety and in
[18:31] childbearing and all such because then
[18:34] she becomes a part of this man
[18:39] that's what bring why didn't Abraham why
[18:41] didn't God kill Sarah sitting right
[18:43] there the night
[18:46] of God sitting there as a mortal man
[18:47] eating flesh eating bread drinking milk
[18:51] and he said why did Sarah laugh back
[18:53] there in the back behind him in the Tina
[18:55] never seen her saying these to how can
[18:57] these things be
[18:58] she said I never said it oh my God
[19:01] tell God he's a liar to his face
[19:05] but he couldn't take her
[19:07] why she's a part of Abraham
[19:13] he couldn't hurt her without hurting
[19:16] Abraham
[19:17] now you women see where you belong
[19:20] and the Bible said you women be like
[19:23] Sarah was which adorned herself in
[19:26] modest apparel live honest and true to
[19:28] her own husband loving him so much that
[19:31] he she called him her Lord ruler
[19:36] ownership
[19:38] and you some of the women put on these
[19:40] nasty clothes eat out here to throw
[19:42] yourself before man Jesus said whosoever
[19:44] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[19:46] has committed adultery with her already
[19:49] in his heart
[19:52] then who's guilty the man or you
[19:56] he's a male
[19:58] made so he could take this act
[20:02] see
[20:03] and you're the female that ought to
[20:05] refuse
[20:07] now why do you put yourself out like
[20:09] that it ain't for comfort
[20:11] you know what can't be when your half
[20:12] froze to death for them shorts on
[20:16] it can't be for comfort and what is it
[20:19] is for Filth
[20:21] you won't admit it but it's the Bible
[20:23] says so
[20:24] amen it's the truth it's a filthy Spirit
[20:27] that's in you you don't want to be
[20:28] filthy but you don't realize spiritually
[20:31] you are filthy
[20:33] because you're presenting yourself
[20:34] filthy
[20:36] now a man is old dirty naughty knees and
[20:38] if he had on hardly any clothes all
[20:40] we're making difference his body's not
[20:41] tempting
[20:42] why he was in the original creation
[20:44] character should be
[20:46] but you're the byproduct to tempt by
[20:51] God have mercy on my this sinful world
[20:54] I'll be glad when it's over
[20:57] notice
[21:04] he can put away his wife anytime he
[21:07] wants to but she can't put him away
[21:10] he can make me he can throw me in the
[21:13] dust anytime he takes an ocean to you
[21:14] but oh brother I better try and throw
[21:16] him there
[21:18] I'm finished
[21:20] Solomon can marry any woman that wasn't
[21:22] married
[21:24] he can marry any woman he wanted to a
[21:26] priest could marry only a woman that was
[21:28] a virgin Solomon like David he married
[21:30] uh what was her name Abigail which says
[21:33] a man called a fool he had a nice wife
[21:35] and he died
[21:37] and Abigail was married to David he was
[21:40] a king not a priest thing so he he
[21:44] married but a priest could not do that
[21:45] because it touched a god a woman to be
[21:48] his wife that was already been some
[21:50] man's wife so that shows the urgency of
[21:52] the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[21:54] bridal had to be unadulterated the word
[21:57] not one word missing nowhere
[22:00] certainly
[22:01] could you imagine a correct bride one
[22:03] breast off and the other something other
[22:05] wrong you know that's not going to be
[22:07] the bride of Christ she's perfect
[22:09] She's Everything the word not one word
[22:12] failing anywhere no
[22:14] notice
[22:15] he can put her away but she cannot put
[22:18] him away he did it and proved it in the
[22:21] days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost
[22:23] when they refused to become the further
[22:26] part of him
[22:28] by having
[22:31] spiritual sexual Affair to become
[22:34] pregnant with further part of the word
[22:40] you understand
[22:41] she refused the Lutheran Church refused
[22:45] for Christ to have any more Desire with
[22:47] her
[22:49] Luther refused it
[22:51] let me say this
[22:53] I'm going to call me something anyhow so
[22:56] is it the day with every one of them
[22:58] they fail to take that word they refuse
[23:01] Christ and any woman that refuses a man
[23:04] is child has no right to be alive to him
[23:09] man
[23:12] you remember the Bible when the King
[23:14] married Esther
[23:16] because the queen refused
[23:19] he just got him another one
[23:22] and when the what happened when she
[23:24] refused to come out with the King
[23:26] obeying
[23:28] the same thing it is with a woman that
[23:31] refuses to be white
[23:33] to her husband
[23:35] so is it with the church
[23:37] that refuses to become pregnated in the
[23:41] age that we now live in to bring forth
[23:43] children of this age
[23:46] we are not lutherans we're not Wesley's
[23:48] neither are we Pentecostals we've got to
[23:51] be the children of this age to the
[23:53] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[23:55] forth a child of this age
[23:59] the sea child
[24:01] amen I hope you understand
[24:07] couldn't be pregnant and no
[24:09] so what did he do put her away in
[24:12] divorcement
[24:13] it's Ryan
[24:15] but she dares put him away
[24:17] he put her away
[24:20] he went right on revealing his word to
[24:22] the body and vindicating him saying by
[24:25] himself his children began to go look
[24:27] more like him
[24:28] because it's fully mature
[24:32] or they become children of the word
[24:35] not children of the church Children of
[24:37] the word and the bride will be a lovely
[24:39] little lady of the word
[24:42] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[24:44] organization
[24:46] any man-made Theory should be purely
[24:48] unadulterated Bride of the word
[24:52] amen amen
[24:54] I hope you get that out on the air
[24:59] she'll be the impregnated
[25:03] daughter of God
[25:06] see what a great honor a woman can be
[25:08] see what a great thing the church can be
[25:10] but you see where filth has got her to
[25:13] then trying to compare that church out
[25:14] there with the church here you can't do
[25:16] and trying to come out the street
[25:17] hearted with the Church of the Living
[25:18] God or the woman the correct woman with
[25:20] a harlot why is there such things as
[25:23] that it's a law of God
[25:25] a contrast how will we know how to enjoy
[25:28] the daylight if there was a night
[25:31] how do we know how to enjoy the dry
[25:32] weather if there wasn't rain
[25:34] how would we normally enjoy and respect
[25:36] a real woman if there was a dirty one
[25:45] right on revealing it right revealing
[25:47] his word but dare any one of us to try
[25:50] to put away him and marry another
[25:53] now surely it's plain why both
[25:58] theories are wrong
[26:00] you can't make it run this way it's gone
[26:02] you make it run that run from a past the
[26:04] promise here's the promise
[26:06] here's the thing right here
[26:08] the word is not contradictory it has to
[26:11] stay in continuity
[26:13] now no more than Matthew 28 19
[26:17] contradicts Acts 2 38. now some of you
[26:21] women some of you man uh I know you're
[26:23] you're disagreeing with it because you
[26:25] know you can't hide that right now
[26:28] you can
[26:30] but let me just show you something if
[26:32] Matthew 28 19 said go ye therefore teach
[26:34] All Nations baptizing them in the name
[26:36] of the father and of the Son and the
[26:37] Holy Ghost and they turned around and
[26:39] every person has ever baptized was
[26:41] baptized contrary to that
[26:45] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[26:48] the for even all through the Bible agent
[26:50] for 300 years after the Bible age to the
[26:53] nicia council
[26:55] then the adopted dogmas instead what's
[26:57] the difference if it isn't revealed and
[27:00] you know the whole book the whole Bible
[27:01] is a revelation
[27:03] that's how you have to go the truth
[27:04] between this and and yeah
