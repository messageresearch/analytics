[46:07] and it's good to be back in the house of
[46:09] the Lord amen
[46:10] and uh I will tell you
[46:13] a truth confession is the other
[46:16] uh I've not have not recovered for some
[46:20] reason I have not recovered from those
[46:22] meetings in South Africa I've just been
[46:25] uh
[46:26] kind of been struggling with my strength
[46:29] amen for some reason I mean
[46:32] I've not and I recovered from from those
[46:37] meetings here
[46:38] so keep praying for me
[46:40] and that the law will just kind of give
[46:46] me back my strength
[46:48] praise the Lord
[46:49] so uh this morning I like to go over
[46:53] some few things from uh from the tape
[46:56] that was played this morning we in
[47:00] marriage and divorce for many of you
[47:02] that have been following the pleasure of
[47:04] the tape and if you realize we were
[47:07] going through the entire series of the
[47:10] tips leading to marriage and divorce and
[47:12] after marriage and divorce so we end up
[47:14] in a serious year if you've been
[47:16] following the tip if that you are not
[47:20] doing good to yourself praise the Lord
[47:24] and uh
[47:26] if uh if if the the if the technicians
[47:31] back there have my my notes up I just
[47:34] want to go to their first tape there's
[47:35] something brother Brandon said it kind
[47:38] of confirmed something that I had on my
[47:40] heart so uh uh he said so yeah that uh
[47:47] um and now this morning is that great
[47:51] subject we we are to discuss on marriage
[47:56] and divorce
[47:57] and the reason I made it Sunday school
[48:01] now that caught my mind because if you
[48:05] realize we we for for for The Good Wife
[48:08] now we've been we've been playing tapes
[48:11] for for our Sunday school session
[48:16] it is not because we don't have teachers
[48:18] to do that but you will realize if you
[48:21] go back and you look at that uh uh you
[48:25] take Sunday school you will see that
[48:28] brother Branham was making those tapes
[48:31] on Sunday school he will say the other
[48:34] uh you know we take this subject as a
[48:37] Sunday school you know so he will come
[48:40] to the Tabernacle he would teach a
[48:42] subject
[48:43] during Sunday school and then uh and
[48:47] then uh later the regular service but
[48:50] anivia will be in charge of the regular
[48:52] service so most of the tips especially
[48:55] after the opening of the sales most of
[48:58] those tapes were taught for Sunday
[49:00] school and he says uh
[49:04] he says here uh
[49:10] this morning is the great subject we
[49:12] have been uh to discuss on marriage and
[49:15] Davos and the reason I made a Sunday
[49:17] school so that we could talk about it
[49:20] and take our time instead of preaching
[49:22] the sermon on it it is a teaching from
[49:25] the scripture so so uh and that's what
[49:30] we want to do that's what we want to do
[49:32] one of the reason major reason did is
[49:35] that I want the voice of the messenger
[49:37] to go forth from this Tabernacle there's
[49:40] one the second reason there is to be
[49:42] able to encourage you to listen to The
[49:45] Prophet amen if you don't do it on your
[49:47] own and maybe you choose not to come on
[49:50] time Sunday morning then you will not
[49:52] listen to The Prophet but if you come
[49:54] here during the Sunday School time you
[49:56] will have a such a short session to
[49:59] listen to uh brother Brandon and uh and
[50:03] and and again I would say is if you
[50:06] listen to anything on the table whether
[50:08] at home or during during the Sunday
[50:11] School period year and you have a
[50:14] question if you create a question in
[50:16] your mind not only on this subject or
[50:19] marriage and divorce but any tip that is
[50:21] played I remember brother Dan uh
[50:24] preaching
[50:25] one of his message he preached is that
[50:29] three minutes to midnight and he says
[50:32] you know I was listening to brother
[50:34] Brandon down and brother Branham said he
[50:36] picked up on tape he gave him my
[50:37] inspiration to preach so that's good
[50:40] praise the Lord I do the same also amen
[50:43] I do the same also and I think that's
[50:46] the way the Holy Spirit deal with us
[50:48] praise the Lord so uh if you if anything
[50:51] create a question on your mind just just
[50:53] write it down give it to the day comes
[50:55] and uh if it is necessary I will answer
[50:59] it before the congregation if not if I
[51:03] can be able to discern who write it I
[51:05] will call you and we will talk about it
[51:07] praise the Lord
[51:09] amen so if I can descend your writing
[51:13] and you don't have your answer then you
[51:16] get back to the Deacon or you come to
[51:17] see me then I know who wrote it praise
[51:20] the Lord
[51:21] so uh uh but it is it is in a place that
[51:26] uh you know uh let's encourage ourselves
[51:29] to to uh uh Place those tips it is very
[51:33] important amen it is very important
[51:37] even the ones that are playing here go
[51:39] back play it listing pick up some things
[51:41] ask questions praise the Lord because uh
[51:44] one thing that uh uh uh you know we we
[51:49] we want to know and instruct ourselves
[51:52] and there is nothing that we are forcing
[51:55] down your throat if God do not give it
[51:57] to you by Revelation there is no way you
[51:59] will swallow it the way God feed his
[52:01] children is by revelation we are not
[52:04] forcing anything down your throat no
[52:06] praise the Lord and if it is if it is
[52:10] the revelation of God's word it will be
[52:12] right in this Bible
[52:13] amen there are things that are being
[52:16] seen in the scripture uh uh that was one
[52:20] of the reasons why I brought that little
[52:21] picture last Sunday on design it was it
[52:25] was it was to show you that uh not only
[52:29] in the animals now only in the things
[52:32] that God created but you have to realize
[52:34] that everything was created by his word
[52:38] amen so the word is the designer
[52:43] God's word
[52:45] is is is uh is is a designer is is is is
[52:50] the blueprint
[52:52] praise the Lord so just like how you see
[52:56] uh uh the design in the bird that's
[52:59] another there's another animal I was
[53:01] looking at you know uh uh uh I I
[53:05] stumbled into these things as I'm
[53:08] looking up over the place
[53:10] with a kind of a curious mind
[53:13] and uh uh but I'm stay I'm still
[53:17] Gathering Gathering Man pictures and and
[53:20] things uh to to share that with you but
[53:23] it was it was very very very amazing
[53:25] very amazing I will share that with you
[53:27] as I get myself together on that a
[53:30] little little bit on the on the zebra no
[53:33] matter the zebra the uh
[53:35] how you can call it now
[53:37] the giraffe
[53:40] okay
[53:41] and uh
[53:43] is is very amazing very amazing when you
[53:47] when you look into some of the things
[53:50] that are that are you know that are that
[53:53] are there very amazing it has it has a
[53:57] very powerful blood pressure
[54:00] to be able to take the blood from his
[54:02] heart to its long neck
[54:05] and if you have that blood pressure you
[54:07] will die instantly
[54:10] if a human will have that blood pressure
[54:12] that runs in the giraffe to take the
[54:15] blood from his heart to to his neck to
[54:19] this head you would die
[54:21] but the the the beautiful thing there is
[54:24] there
[54:25] now and I was keeping this thing and I'm
[54:27] into it okay
[54:29] the beautiful thing there is the other
[54:33] when a jirai put his
[54:37] it's neck down to to drink is vulnerable
[54:41] with that blood pressure the brain
[54:43] should blow off
[54:47] with that powerful blood pressure when
[54:49] the giraffe put his neck down the the
[54:52] brain should blow off immediately
[54:55] but God puts something there in the
[54:57] giraffe's head like a sponge
[55:02] that control the blood pressure
[55:05] and it stopped that powerful blood
[55:07] pressure from getting down to the Giroud
[55:09] neck
[55:10] you know so for that animal to be able
[55:13] to bend his hair down and put his head
[55:15] up if there was not a design that
[55:18] controls
[55:19] the the blood pressure it would not
[55:21] survive
[55:24] praise the Lord so when David said have
[55:27] fearful
[55:28] and wonderfully
[55:30] that we are made
[55:36] there's a great intelligence
[55:39] behind that now so let me get through
[55:41] this whole uh uh Sunday school thing
[55:44] just to encourage you but bam said it
[55:47] again on that tape he said this morning
[55:49] out there some things that could not be
[55:54] said out before a mixed audience and
[55:58] some that are
[55:59] probably will say must be understand
[56:04] he said take it from me your brother to
[56:07] the best that I know
[56:10] you will sit in the doctor's office and
[56:13] listening to him and he who have to say
[56:17] very plain words to you
[56:20] praise the Lord sometimes that's not
[56:23] what you want to hear
[56:25] but the reason why you go to the doctor
[56:26] because you have confidence in him
[56:29] and if you don't have confidence don't
[56:31] go there
[56:32] because it's not going to help you
[56:35] it does not help you for you to sit down
[56:37] to listen to a person and you are
[56:39] doubting everything they are saying
[56:41] it does not help you
[56:44] praise the Lord it does not help you I
[56:46] don't know what you want me to say
[56:49] just write a note bring it to the office
[56:51] say this is what I want you to say if I
[56:53] have time I will slot it in
[56:56] but you have to be a calling to the word
[56:58] and it must be a revelation to me
[57:02] praise the Lord so you see there's a
[57:05] blood brand saying here you say you will
[57:06] go we go to the doctor we sit down and
[57:09] sometimes they have to say plain words
[57:10] to us
[57:11] to the best of their their medical study
[57:15] to their the best of their examination
[57:17] they have to tell you this is what I see
[57:22] praise the Lord
[57:24] amen
[57:26] but we also have
[57:29] the word of the great physician
[57:33] so you can think what the doctor says
[57:36] don't don't fight against it don't fight
[57:38] against it
[57:39] don't fight against it because if you
[57:42] fight against it and you bring it to the
[57:44] great physician it's going to be
[57:45] conflicting
[57:46] [Music]
[57:49] praise the Lord
[57:51] for you to doubt what the doctor says it
[57:55] does not give you a lot of ground to
[57:57] believe what the great physician says
[58:02] the right attitude is to say Lord this
[58:04] is what the doctor says
[58:07] and I'm bringing it to lay it upon your
[58:10] world because I know you have the
[58:13] fantasy
[58:14] [Music]
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:18] praise the Lord that's how Faith Works
[58:22] praise the Lord Faith does not work by
[58:25] deny
[58:27] denied is fear
[58:31] is fear sometimes that throw people into
[58:34] deny Faith does not works like that
[58:38] praise the Lord
[58:41] so what I mean uh there's uh
[58:45] so yeah but I'm saying this here you say
[58:47] damn you listen to him he will have to
[58:49] say plain words to You and some of you
[58:53] young ladies and young men
[58:55] I don't want you to get the wrong
[58:59] impression and that's that's what I took
[59:02] this uh uh because uh as you as you
[59:07] listen to the table what about home in
[59:09] home or a year I don't want you to get
[59:11] the wrong Impressions amen don't come to
[59:14] a full-stop conclusion until you really
[59:17] understand the subject
[59:19] you know because just like brother
[59:21] Brandon would say here he says I don't
[59:23] want you to get a wrong impression I
[59:24] want you to believe and just sit still
[59:27] remember truth has to be
[59:30] and Truth has got to be stated truth
[59:34] he says this scripture after he read the
[59:37] scripture he says this scripture
[59:39] the question confronting Jesus at the
[59:43] beginning of his ministry he will he
[59:46] will show us that this was a question
[59:48] through all ages
[59:50] it was the question from Genesis to
[59:53] revelation
[59:56] praise the Lord
[59:57] because just like it was a question in
[1:00:00] Genesis Genesis chapter 3 that's the
[1:00:03] same way it's a question in Revelation
[1:00:04] because we are seeing two women that are
[1:00:07] claiming to be the bride
[1:00:10] amen so it creates a question who is the
[1:00:13] bride
[1:00:17] so he says yeah this scripture the
[1:00:20] question confronting Jesus at the very
[1:00:23] beginning of his ministry
[1:00:27] and a confront Moses at the beginning of
[1:00:31] his ministry
[1:00:33] it's a foremost question in believer's
[1:00:38] heart
[1:00:39] the Sinners don't care
[1:00:41] but it's to Believers because the
[1:00:46] believer is trying to do all that he
[1:00:50] knows how to do to live right before God
[1:00:53] therefore
[1:00:56] it's any question come up on religion
[1:00:59] then
[1:01:01] the marriage and divorce case come up
[1:01:04] see because
[1:01:06] it is the cause of the original sin
[1:01:10] praise the Lord amen the cause of the
[1:01:13] original sin there were two male one
[1:01:15] female
[1:01:18] if there were two males two female we
[1:01:20] would not have that problem
[1:01:25] but there were two male in the beginning
[1:01:27] with one female
[1:01:30] praise the Lord
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:35] and by then when it came to our time is
[1:01:37] one meal with seven female
[1:01:39] seven women would take hold to one man
[1:01:43] in the beginning it was two mil to one
[1:01:46] female
[1:01:46] that's what caused the problem
[1:01:51] so that's what better Brandon is saying
[1:01:53] here is is that's that's the reason why
[1:01:55] every time that subject comes up it
[1:01:58] becomes very important
[1:02:05] so uh he says because is the cause of
[1:02:09] the original sins that's where sin
[1:02:11] started and that's the reason is brought
[1:02:15] up every time because it is the very
[1:02:19] beginning of the same question
[1:02:24] praise the Lord so we we will be going
[1:02:27] through the series like I said you know
[1:02:29] if you can make a year on time follow
[1:02:31] the portion that will be played in
[1:02:33] church you have a question write it down
[1:02:35] if you want to follow it at home you can
[1:02:37] follow it the the the the
[1:02:42] the services online you can play it
[1:02:45] drive into church and just to help
[1:02:48] create an atmosphere to get into the
[1:02:51] Sunday morning service let's stand on
[1:02:53] our feet and go right to the word
[1:02:56] praise the Lord as we will trust this
[1:02:58] morning that the Lord will just give us
[1:03:01] the strength to be able to bring
[1:03:03] something to you but uh earnestly
[1:03:06] requests that you continue to keep me in
[1:03:08] prayer that the Lord will just just give
[1:03:11] me my strength amen
[1:03:14] he will give me my strength I'm telling
[1:03:16] you I've never been wept out like the
[1:03:18] way I feel like being wiped out let's go
[1:03:21] to the word this morning Genesis chapter
[1:03:24] 15. Genesis chapter 15.
[1:03:28] praise the Lord
[1:03:31] praise the Lord amen
[1:03:33] if you uh
[1:03:38] you you get used to preaching with
[1:03:40] emotions and you don't have strength
[1:03:42] then you become a teacher
[1:03:45] you know you become a teacher and you
[1:03:47] take your time amen praise the Lord I
[1:03:50] realize sometimes I admired you know uh
[1:03:52] brother Jordan and brother Dan you know
[1:03:55] to stay right here and yet their word is
[1:03:57] forceful
[1:03:59] it looks like for me to push my word I
[1:04:01] have to move let's go
[1:04:02] [Laughter]
[1:04:06] but we are made different Genesis
[1:04:08] chapter 15 let's read
[1:04:13] after these things
[1:04:15] after War thing
[1:04:18] the Lord bless you you can have your
[1:04:19] seat
[1:04:30] Genesis chapter 14.
[1:04:33] let's go back
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:37] after War thing
[1:04:40] after these things after one thing after
[1:04:47] the visit to Abraham
[1:04:50] so Genesis 15 will not make a lot of
[1:04:53] sense to you until you go back to
[1:04:55] Genesis 14 and see what happened
[1:04:59] before Abraham was brought to Genesis
[1:05:01] 15.
[1:05:03] so let's go back a little bit and then
[1:05:06] we we would read yeah we would pick up
[1:05:07] few of what took place here over we see
[1:05:12] here is where Abraham I'm his household
[1:05:15] to get his uh his brother lot uh uh uh
[1:05:21] that was that was that was ticking
[1:05:24] praise the Lord
[1:05:26] and uh because of that
[1:05:39] all right
[1:05:41] from verse 14 and when Abraham heard his
[1:05:44] brother was taking captive he am his
[1:05:48] trained servants born in his own house
[1:05:52] 300
[1:05:55] and 18 MPS and persuade him unto them
[1:05:58] and he and he divided himself against
[1:06:02] them he and his servant by night and
[1:06:06] smoke them and and pursued them onto our
[1:06:09] Harbor which is on the left hand of
[1:06:12] Damascus and he brought back all the
[1:06:16] girls and and also brought again his
[1:06:19] brother Lord and his goals praise the
[1:06:22] Lord and the women also and the people
[1:06:26] and the king of Surah went out to meet
[1:06:28] him after his return from the slaughter
[1:06:32] of the Chad doll lomites and all the
[1:06:37] kings that were with him at the Violet
[1:06:40] of Sheva which is the king of Dil and uh
[1:06:45] Melchizedek the king of Salem brought
[1:06:48] for Bread and Wine
[1:06:50] and he was the priest of the most high
[1:06:54] God praise the Lord now after marriage
[1:06:57] and divorce brother Brandon we now
[1:06:59] preach for us who is this melchized so
[1:07:02] we'll have time to listen to there too
[1:07:03] it's all part of the series of marriage
[1:07:06] and Devils it's very is is is very
[1:07:10] uh uh unique in a way that everything
[1:07:14] plays out if I start talking and I will
[1:07:17] miss my trained off thoughts so let's
[1:07:19] just stay right to you
[1:07:22] and he blessed him because he said bless
[1:07:25] Abraham and said
[1:07:27] Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god
[1:07:32] possessor of Heaven and Earth
[1:07:36] now he's repeating to Abraham the very
[1:07:39] promise that was given to Abraham amen
[1:07:42] he's he's repeating to Abraham
[1:07:45] and blessed be the most high God which
[1:07:49] have uh uh delivered our enemies into
[1:07:52] the hand and he gave him TI of all and
[1:07:57] the king of Sodom said unto Abraham gave
[1:08:00] me
[1:08:01] the persons and take the goose to
[1:08:04] thyself and Abraham said to the king of
[1:08:07] Sodom I have
[1:08:09] lifted up my hands unto the Lord the
[1:08:12] most high God the possessor of Heaven
[1:08:14] and Earth that I will not take from
[1:08:18] take from a trade even to a shoe lashes
[1:08:22] and that I will not take anything that
[1:08:26] is dying at least thou should have said
[1:08:30] I have made Abraham rich
[1:08:33] praise the Lord save only that wish the
[1:08:36] young men have eaten
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] the portion of the man which went with
[1:08:44] me now so that's what the Bible is
[1:08:47] saying after these things
[1:08:51] so you get the picture after Abraham has
[1:08:54] gone down there and uh uh he has he has
[1:09:00] gone to to rescue his Fallen brother
[1:09:05] now you have to remember now we've been
[1:09:07] talking around exceeding righteousness
[1:09:11] that's what we've been talking about so
[1:09:14] we we have to keep that subject in mind
[1:09:16] I know uh last Sunday I I saw the
[1:09:20] message there and and the title is uh
[1:09:23] something about design but that was just
[1:09:25] that was just above my notes but we
[1:09:28] stayed part of our series of uh of
[1:09:31] righteousness that we've been talking
[1:09:32] about exceeding Rogers and I want you to
[1:09:34] keep that in mind now as we look at the
[1:09:38] subject as we look at the subject from
[1:09:40] the very beginning there was something
[1:09:43] that I was driving there for us to be
[1:09:45] able to understand how God playing of
[1:09:49] redemption
[1:09:50] how God plane of redemption was the very
[1:09:54] reason of creation
[1:09:57] praise the Lord there are very few
[1:10:00] places uh Genesis uh uh over in Jeremiah
[1:10:04] in few places in the Bible what the
[1:10:07] Bible talks about creation but right
[1:10:10] from Genesis to Revelation Redemption is
[1:10:12] play out
[1:10:14] in types and Shadow and different ways
[1:10:16] so Redemption is very very important
[1:10:21] and I would say this this morning
[1:10:23] Redemption should be influencing Our
[1:10:26] Lives
[1:10:29] our action if we are if you are taking
[1:10:32] an action to do anything
[1:10:36] the question behind it is that how is
[1:10:39] this applied to Redemption
[1:10:44] praise the Lord
[1:10:46] amen just like I said uh Paul talks
[1:10:49] about uh uh if if I believe in wife
[1:10:54] wants to stay with an unbelieving
[1:10:56] husband he says the man will be
[1:10:58] Sanctified by by her faith what he says
[1:11:02] that what is the driving thought
[1:11:04] it's not just to keep a man in her life
[1:11:07] but the talk behind it is that for the
[1:11:10] fact that her faith will sanctify the
[1:11:13] man is redemption
[1:11:17] amen why will uh uh Jesus live in a
[1:11:22] bunch of Parables about forgiveness
[1:11:25] you know if a brother how many times
[1:11:27] seventy thousand why is there what what
[1:11:30] is behind the Redemption
[1:11:36] while we ask God for Mercy why we must
[1:11:39] leave our our our
[1:11:41] sacrifice our Altar and go and make it
[1:11:45] right with a brother or make it right
[1:11:46] with a sister to make it right with
[1:11:48] somebody that we have done why we should
[1:11:50] do that it's all because of redemption
[1:11:56] so if Redemption the thought of
[1:11:59] redemption is not influencing our
[1:12:01] decision you will realize that you will
[1:12:05] never glorify God in what you are doing
[1:12:09] because it is that thought of redemption
[1:12:12] that make us to do things even beyond
[1:12:16] our better judgment
[1:12:18] you are doing it because the word says
[1:12:20] so
[1:12:25] in uh uh Joshua paralyzed uh uh
[1:12:29] efficient parallel Joshua better Brandon
[1:12:31] would take this very scripture that we
[1:12:33] are talking about uh Abraham going out
[1:12:36] to redeem his Fallen brother
[1:12:40] you can go back and study that brother
[1:12:42] Brown would take that and he will say
[1:12:44] how God adopted Abraham
[1:12:48] Abraham experienced his adoption God put
[1:12:52] him aside and sent and sent mechanic to
[1:12:56] to do to to offer communion to Abraham
[1:12:59] because Abraham did what was in God's
[1:13:02] mind
[1:13:06] Lord was the one that brought the first
[1:13:08] about fighting over Carlos Abraham gave
[1:13:12] him the auction you choose wherever you
[1:13:13] want to go you go left I will go right
[1:13:16] what you you make the choice give him
[1:13:18] the first uh uh uh preference
[1:13:23] amen
[1:13:24] and Abraham where I mean lot went away
[1:13:27] and and and and and yerry said he got
[1:13:29] into trouble he never even sent a letter
[1:13:32] Abraham heard about it
[1:13:38] what was the Draven thought behind him
[1:13:40] Redemption
[1:13:41] so you will see uh uh behind behind lord
[1:13:46] of the types behind a lot of the times
[1:13:49] sometimes the times that are that that
[1:13:52] can even choke us up
[1:13:56] like the one we read there over in uh uh
[1:14:00] uh uh Genesis 38 there with with uh with
[1:14:05] uh with chairman
[1:14:08] there is something here uh in in line
[1:14:10] with that I want to show you if the
[1:14:14] if the I would attack people they can go
[1:14:17] to our
[1:14:19] our pictures
[1:14:24] you go go to the ones that have uh
[1:14:28] our boss Ruth Obel Jesse and David
[1:14:34] if you can put that picture up and then
[1:14:37] cut this light off
[1:14:41] you'll not be able to see it uh I hope
[1:14:43] you can see it better now this is
[1:14:47] Genesis where were we reading is it 38
[1:14:50] or 39
[1:14:52] was that Genesis 38 or 39
[1:14:57] no no no no now what we read the story
[1:14:59] about tema
[1:15:04] that was Genesis today this is Genesis
[1:15:07] 38 in the Hebrew Bible
[1:15:11] this is Genesis 38 in the Hebrew Bible
[1:15:15] and after every 49 letter
[1:15:21] the fifth year letter
[1:15:23] spell boss
[1:15:29] because you have to realize that uh
[1:15:32] uh I loved it someone said every
[1:15:34] language go back to Jerusalem
[1:15:37] okay those on the west of the of
[1:15:40] Jerusalem derides from left to right and
[1:15:43] the other ones right you know so the the
[1:15:46] Hebrew goes from right to left
[1:15:51] just like Arabic and all the other
[1:15:53] language that goes from right to left
[1:15:55] and and we on this side of Jerusalem and
[1:15:58] we go from from uh from from left to
[1:16:01] right now so uh
[1:16:04] uh
[1:16:06] and then every 49 letter in the Hebrew
[1:16:11] Bible this this is this is very amazing
[1:16:13] I mean it blew my mind when I was when I
[1:16:17] was studying this I have I have a uh
[1:16:20] steady thing I use on uh what I try to
[1:16:23] do parallel I look through through the
[1:16:26] the you know the great just just to be
[1:16:28] able to help me
[1:16:30] you know in a way my mind my mind runs
[1:16:32] but it's it it amazed me when I saw this
[1:16:35] it makes me blew my mind
[1:16:38] every 49 letter the first 49 letter I
[1:16:42] spell out Boaz the next 49 after every
[1:16:46] 49 uh then you you know it spell out the
[1:16:50] word ruth is spelled out of the word
[1:16:53] Obel is spelled out Jesse is spelled out
[1:16:56] and uh uh just again again is for us to
[1:17:02] be able to see that this is God's
[1:17:05] internal thoughts
[1:17:08] hmm
[1:17:10] this is God's internal thoughts
[1:17:16] that write in their story
[1:17:19] that might look like an abominable story
[1:17:24] because it's not a decent story
[1:17:28] with all of the the Mysteries we try to
[1:17:31] to bring out of it is not a decent story
[1:17:35] it will have to it will have to be that
[1:17:39] God has healed something profound in
[1:17:43] that for him to Allure in his word
[1:17:49] praise the Lord
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:56] and but to be able to see that
[1:18:02] is holding such I mean it brings out uh
[1:18:06] the the the the very you take this over
[1:18:09] to the Book of Matthew it brings out the
[1:18:12] very genology of Jesus Christ
[1:18:17] the Lord
[1:18:18] and for it to be able to line it up just
[1:18:22] exactly not not even missing it but for
[1:18:25] it to be placed just in the order
[1:18:36] and then and the reason why I keep
[1:18:38] bringing this thing is to is to bring
[1:18:42] that that emphasis which cannot be we
[1:18:46] cannot over emphasize but we will do the
[1:18:48] best that we can to to you know to to
[1:18:51] kind of impress our mind how the word of
[1:18:55] God is very important
[1:19:00] Heaven and Earth
[1:19:02] will pass away
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:19:14] but now one jot of God's word
[1:19:19] will fail
[1:19:24] praise the Lord
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] as you see that and that is the reason
[1:19:29] why we have I mean we we have to to
[1:19:33] brother bamboo talks about the
[1:19:35] importance of Revelation is because even
[1:19:38] our Bible that we have
[1:19:41] the Old Testament was translated from
[1:19:44] the Hebrew the New Testament was
[1:19:47] translated from the Greek
[1:19:49] and and and all of these men that did
[1:19:52] this translation they did their best to
[1:19:55] be able to bring us what was there but
[1:19:59] but you see men laboring to do their
[1:20:02] best
[1:20:04] we have heard the same thing around the
[1:20:06] message people that have tried to write
[1:20:08] the message in different languages
[1:20:10] that's where we have the birth of all of
[1:20:12] these false doctrines that have come
[1:20:14] come around the world
[1:20:16] because somebody listening to brother
[1:20:18] Brandon and they are doing their best
[1:20:20] with what they know in English
[1:20:23] to translate into German or something
[1:20:25] else they express and say something
[1:20:28] completely different
[1:20:34] and if the spirit of Revelation don't
[1:20:36] help them
[1:20:38] those people are going to do it in false
[1:20:41] Doctrine
[1:20:43] but because God promised that not one of
[1:20:46] his Elias will be deceived
[1:20:50] he will find a way to bring a balance to
[1:20:53] Thy Word
[1:20:54] amen amen we're getting and corrected
[1:20:58] from behind the pulpit and people will
[1:21:00] say I knew there was something with that
[1:21:08] I knew there was something with that
[1:21:13] glory be to God
[1:21:17] so I mean when I when I saw that I would
[1:21:19] just I mean all of these things they can
[1:21:22] just they can just finish the strength
[1:21:25] in me and I'm saying oh my God
[1:21:28] how can this be
[1:21:30] how can this be
[1:21:35] how can this be
[1:21:40] praise the Lord
[1:21:43] but we thank the Lord amen we thank God
[1:21:46] because he's faithful so yeah we read
[1:21:49] the scripture after these things and now
[1:21:51] we are going back to see the thing that
[1:21:54] happened that God is about to speak this
[1:21:57] word to Abraham yeah Genesis 15 after
[1:22:00] these things the the word of the Lord
[1:22:02] came unto Abraham in a vision
[1:22:05] same fear not Abraham
[1:22:08] I am the shield and the exceeding great
[1:22:13] reward
[1:22:16] does something wrap your mind here
[1:22:19] when you read that
[1:22:23] why is God expressing himself to Abraham
[1:22:27] Abraham just refused a reward
[1:22:33] he just refuse
[1:22:36] something from the king of of of of
[1:22:38] Sodom
[1:22:41] and say I will not take even down to a
[1:22:44] shoelace I will take a thread
[1:22:50] I won't take a trade I'm not doing this
[1:22:52] because I want your favor or I want your
[1:22:55] blessing
[1:22:58] and God
[1:22:59] honoring Abraham
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:07] and coming to him right after that
[1:23:10] and saying I am
[1:23:14] You're great and your exceeding reward
[1:23:19] let me tell you people God Rewards
[1:23:23] when we do the right thing God Rewards
[1:23:28] the Bible say he's the rewarder of them
[1:23:31] that diligently seeking
[1:23:34] he's not evil to forget your labor of
[1:23:37] love God Rewards
[1:23:44] praise the Lord
[1:23:46] God Rewards
[1:23:50] God rewards in good health
[1:23:55] praise the Lord
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:57] God Rewards
[1:24:04] in also good homes
[1:24:07] those are some other things that we get
[1:24:09] into this morning I'm just I'm just I'm
[1:24:11] just so
[1:24:13] I'm just so uh all over the place and
[1:24:16] and just trusting that God will will be
[1:24:18] able to help me
[1:24:20] but
[1:24:22] I mean you just you just think about it
[1:24:25] you think about it and and and and you
[1:24:28] say so uh
[1:24:31] you know you and and and God coming to
[1:24:34] to to to to Abraham
[1:24:37] and uh and expressing himself to Abraham
[1:24:41] this way that uh I am your great and
[1:24:45] you're exceeding reward now what are we
[1:24:49] talking about we are talking about
[1:24:51] uh uh righteousness that exceed
[1:24:57] amen
[1:24:59] righteousness that exceeds Jesus is the
[1:25:02] righteousness I see the righteousness of
[1:25:03] the strap and Pharisees so we will look
[1:25:06] we will look at that word exceed
[1:25:08] exceeding what it means
[1:25:11] because it goes through the Scripture it
[1:25:13] does not only talks about uh
[1:25:14] righteousness the Bible talks about
[1:25:16] exceeding Faith exceeding power what
[1:25:19] does that means
[1:25:21] glory be to God
[1:25:23] are we together
[1:25:25] but I mean if I don't if I can if I
[1:25:29] don't say anything because I just don't
[1:25:31] feel like saying anything I just feel
[1:25:34] like holding you on this one structure
[1:25:37] on this one verse
[1:25:41] to remind you that God Rewards
[1:25:47] praise the Lord
[1:25:48] God Rewards
[1:25:55] glory be to God
[1:25:58] and if he followed the pep this morning
[1:26:00] brother Benham is talking about how thy
[1:26:02] young baptist boy came to him and said
[1:26:05] Brother Band of me you know this message
[1:26:07] that you have preached uh uh can be can
[1:26:10] be copied down as the 23rd chapter and
[1:26:14] why him saying that he just he just
[1:26:16] started prophesying over Broadband
[1:26:19] speaking in tongues and the
[1:26:20] interpretation came in uh and and and
[1:26:23] and their God is is declaring over
[1:26:26] brother Branham because because of this
[1:26:30] tremendous decision because of your
[1:26:34] choice
[1:26:36] they ask for fake eggs
[1:26:40] be unto you are calling to your faith
[1:26:43] it's the same as be it unto you
[1:26:45] according to your choice
[1:26:54] praise the Lord that's what faith is
[1:26:58] is the choice that we make
[1:27:01] based on God's word
[1:27:04] that's what faith is
[1:27:07] it's not this thing that we think there
[1:27:09] is
[1:27:11] I feel it no
[1:27:14] it's the choice that you make
[1:27:20] the choice you make to live your life
[1:27:23] the choice you make for the stain you
[1:27:25] take
[1:27:27] that's your faith
[1:27:40] praise the Lord
[1:27:45] fear that
[1:27:47] hey Brandon I'm your and uh and
[1:27:51] that exceeding great reward
[1:27:56] but Abraham had a question in his mind
[1:27:59] they have something that have been
[1:28:02] bothering him bugging him even though he
[1:28:05] could gather the strength to go in and
[1:28:08] and fight her for Lord but there is
[1:28:10] something in his mind
[1:28:12] there's a cloud in his mind there's a
[1:28:14] question in his mind and what is this
[1:28:17] question Abraham said Lord God
[1:28:20] what will thy give me
[1:28:24] sin I go childish
[1:28:28] praise the Lord what will you give me
[1:28:31] God is expressing himself I am your
[1:28:35] great and your exceeded reward you see
[1:28:37] it is that place where we have the word
[1:28:40] of God we know the Bible says God will
[1:28:42] bless us God will provide our needs he
[1:28:45] will take care of us but yet it saved us
[1:28:49] now answer the question
[1:28:51] that is in our mind
[1:28:53] the question is when
[1:28:55] when will it happen God I know you would
[1:28:58] do it but when
[1:29:02] that's the same thing that Abraham is
[1:29:04] asking God I know Lord he says he says I
[1:29:08] mean I I mean uh uh what what a what a
[1:29:12] dream water than experience you know
[1:29:13] what a God made Abraham on the bed
[1:29:16] whether it was by the dream or the
[1:29:18] vision whatever way that God was
[1:29:20] speaking to Abraham it was just a
[1:29:22] blessing you know it's it's almost like
[1:29:24] brother Branham said in the message I he
[1:29:27] says when you know what the word of God
[1:29:29] said and you do that what the word of
[1:29:31] God said he said it's just like eating
[1:29:34] honey out of the score of a lion that's
[1:29:38] what that's what uh uh uh something
[1:29:41] there the very lion he killed
[1:29:44] he ate honey out of the scar
[1:29:47] praise the Lord amen so it is almost
[1:29:51] like waking up and and God coming to
[1:29:54] Abraham and saying I'm your greatest
[1:29:55] reward Abraham getting the feeling oh
[1:29:58] thank God
[1:30:00] amen even if I was tempted to take what
[1:30:03] the what the king of Sodom gave me thank
[1:30:06] God I did not corrupt myself
[1:30:10] what could have happened if I would have
[1:30:12] taken what the king of Sodom gave
[1:30:15] thank God
[1:30:18] what a feeling it brings
[1:30:22] what a feeling it brings to you that oh
[1:30:25] God thank God I did the right thing
[1:30:29] God is saying I'm your great and your
[1:30:32] exceeding reward
[1:30:36] praise the Lord
[1:30:37] he said okay God but now now
[1:30:43] I'm childless all this thing we are
[1:30:45] talking I'm childish
[1:30:47] praise the Lord as many of you people
[1:30:49] are saying all this thing we are talking
[1:30:50] I'm not married yet
[1:30:53] praise the Lord
[1:30:54] I I don't have a job yet
[1:30:58] pray whatever whatever is is you are
[1:31:00] dealing with whatever is in your mind
[1:31:02] I don't have the Holy Ghost yet
[1:31:07] oh I don't have victory in this area in
[1:31:10] my life yet
[1:31:14] praise the Lord
[1:31:16] amen you see the thing there is the
[1:31:18] other uh uh people will always say if
[1:31:21] you are dealing with that it means that
[1:31:23] you don't have faith that's not truth
[1:31:26] truth our faith does not take away your
[1:31:29] reality
[1:31:31] praise the Lord Faith makes you to
[1:31:33] identify your reality and yet believe
[1:31:35] God
[1:31:37] you identify I'm dealing with this but I
[1:31:39] believe God is able to deliver me
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:46] that's not a Pentecostal fail it does
[1:31:48] not make you to deny your reality
[1:31:53] you identify your reality you identify
[1:31:56] your struggle but your faith raise your
[1:31:58] head up and said I know my redeemer
[1:32:01] lives I know he can deliver me
[1:32:07] foreign
[1:32:20] it means that you don't have faith
[1:32:22] that's not true
[1:32:26] praise the Lord
[1:32:28] some of us that say those things we are
[1:32:30] bad about things
[1:32:31] we know we are bad about it we try to
[1:32:34] act like we are Superman but you know
[1:32:36] you are bothered
[1:32:42] Faith helps you to identify your reality
[1:32:50] he said Lord God what will thy give me
[1:32:52] sin I go chalice
[1:32:55] and the only boy that I have in my house
[1:32:59] is Eleazar
[1:33:02] praise the Lord
[1:33:12] his and Abraham said behold to to me
[1:33:16] thou have given no seed
[1:33:18] and low one bone in my house
[1:33:21] he's the one
[1:33:23] that I'm bringing up
[1:33:25] praise the Lord
[1:33:27] I'm beginning to trust things to him
[1:33:29] he's becoming the leader of my house
[1:33:33] of Damascus
[1:33:38] praise the Lord
[1:33:42] so God so Abraham is taking God into
[1:33:49] a sincere conversation conversation he's
[1:33:52] not he's not struggling he's not uh I I
[1:33:55] I don't want to talk like this as if to
[1:33:57] say I'm doubting
[1:33:59] praise the Lord God already know your
[1:34:01] heart so talk to God the way you feel
[1:34:09] talk to God the way you feel inside
[1:34:16] because you can deceive him
[1:34:18] you can't impress him
[1:34:21] I I don't want to pray as if to say I'm
[1:34:24] doubting
[1:34:28] say Lord I'm struggling here
[1:34:30] I'm strong I need you I I need your help
[1:34:41] praise the Lord
[1:34:47] the scripture said verse 4. behold the
[1:34:50] word of the Lord came unto him
[1:34:54] saying this shall not be done here but
[1:34:58] he that shall come forth
[1:35:01] out of that own bowel shall be down
[1:35:04] here's Abraham is having conversation
[1:35:06] God speaking back to him because this
[1:35:08] man is on speaking terms with God Amen
[1:35:10] praise the Lord he then not made his
[1:35:13] situation to weaken his prayer life amen
[1:35:16] the more that his situation is standing
[1:35:18] before him the more he's he's on
[1:35:20] speaking terms with God so he speak to
[1:35:22] God God speaking back to him amen praise
[1:35:25] the Lord
[1:35:27] and uh
[1:35:30] and he brought him
[1:35:33] where am I
[1:35:34] okay verse 5. you brought him for the
[1:35:37] brother and said look now towards the
[1:35:40] heavens and tell the Stars
[1:35:43] if if if if they'll be able to number
[1:35:46] them
[1:35:47] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[1:35:50] be
[1:35:51] praise the Lord
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] and Abraham believed
[1:35:59] in the Lord
[1:36:02] praise the Lord
[1:36:04] Abraham believed in the Lord
[1:36:09] and it was counted to him
[1:36:12] for righteousness
[1:36:15] after God God dealing with Abraham he
[1:36:19] got down praying and and and and and the
[1:36:22] word of the law spoke back to him after
[1:36:25] God God dealing with Abraham in that
[1:36:27] time of conversation or praying or
[1:36:30] whatever was going on
[1:36:33] Abraham woke up with a strength
[1:36:37] amen Abraham believed the Lord
[1:36:43] and it was counted unto him
[1:36:47] praise the Lord
[1:36:50] even though he have not received
[1:36:53] his heart desire but he still believed
[1:36:56] that God was more than able
[1:36:59] something from God's word brought
[1:37:01] Comfort to Abraham
[1:37:06] I don't know when yet but I believe it
[1:37:12] it was that attitude
[1:37:15] that God looks at encountered Abraham as
[1:37:21] a righteous man
[1:37:24] despite where his fears that's probably
[1:37:26] his struggles
[1:37:30] but God looks at the attitude of Abraham
[1:37:34] believing his word
[1:37:40] after he makes all his complaints
[1:37:44] after he confessed all his inabilities
[1:37:50] but yeah he can take God's word God is
[1:37:52] saying nor Eliza will not be the one you
[1:37:56] will have a son that will comes out of
[1:37:58] you
[1:38:02] looking at his age and looking at the
[1:38:05] age of Sarah and everything and yet God
[1:38:07] Abraham said amen God
[1:38:10] Hallelujah you spoke to me this morning
[1:38:13] through the message you spoke to me
[1:38:15] through your word
[1:38:18] amen and God looks at that attitude
[1:38:25] amen he looks at that attitude of of
[1:38:29] believing his word that's what he called
[1:38:31] righteous
[1:38:34] we look at the Arts of a person life and
[1:38:37] call the righteous
[1:38:39] the art of believing God's word that's
[1:38:42] what God called righteous
[1:38:48] are we together
[1:38:50] and he believed the Lord and he counted
[1:38:54] it to him for righteousness
[1:38:57] Romans chapter 4.
[1:39:00] let's go to Romans chapter 4.
[1:39:03] praise the Lord
[1:39:06] Hallelujah
[1:39:08] let's go in Romans chapter four we can
[1:39:10] we're coming back to that Genesis 10
[1:39:12] year
[1:39:14] I am that great and I exceeding reward
[1:39:18] so you see yeah God is rewarding Abraham
[1:39:23] with righteousness
[1:39:26] not because Abraham
[1:39:30] say God I still believe your word but
[1:39:32] Abraham confessed his inability to the
[1:39:36] righteous one
[1:39:41] and that's what God loved
[1:39:48] God love a sincere heart
[1:39:56] and that's what Jesus
[1:39:59] they're not appreciate of the Pharisees
[1:40:02] because he could see their heart
[1:40:05] different from the action
[1:40:08] with the gift that he was born in he
[1:40:10] could see their heart
[1:40:15] right there is Simon house
[1:40:18] he can look at some on heart and see
[1:40:20] that this guy just brought me down here
[1:40:23] to make a joke out of me
[1:40:27] and he can look down at that woman's
[1:40:29] heart weeping there
[1:40:31] even though she has a bad repetition but
[1:40:34] he can see in her heart
[1:40:40] that she identify that this is the
[1:40:43] Messiah this is a man of God he must not
[1:40:46] be treated like this
[1:40:49] if we will just realized that God looks
[1:40:52] at the heart
[1:40:55] if we will realize that
[1:40:58] it's not what we put on
[1:41:01] he looks at the heart
[1:41:04] and that's what Solomon said we must
[1:41:07] guide our heart
[1:41:08] you must guide your heart
[1:41:11] don't allow bitterness to get in your
[1:41:13] heart don't allow your heart to
[1:41:15] misunderstand things
[1:41:18] because a wounded spirit
[1:41:23] who can heal
[1:41:28] praise the Lord
[1:41:29] when something when something affects
[1:41:32] your heart
[1:41:33] it can bring sickness
[1:41:36] now what better bound with talks about
[1:41:38] how Warrior brings sickness
[1:41:43] the fear and all of those things
[1:41:45] Romans chapter 4 the Apostle Paul
[1:41:49] this great teacher
[1:41:51] will bring us down to this place
[1:41:53] oh Hallelujah you love the Lord this
[1:41:55] morning
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] I'm not even started preaching here my
[1:42:00] time is off
[1:42:03] but that's fine I believe I've said
[1:42:04] something
[1:42:06] to help you amen
[1:42:08] hmm
[1:42:10] if you don't remember anything remember
[1:42:12] that God Rewards
[1:42:14] he rewards our actions
[1:42:16] praise the Lord
[1:42:18] he reward our actions
[1:42:22] and especially to you young people
[1:42:26] the Bible says obey
[1:42:29] your father and mother
[1:42:31] let me not go ahead of myself
[1:42:35] because I want I want to come to that
[1:42:37] scripture the reason why is that there
[1:42:40] are things just like what we did
[1:42:44] to understand
[1:42:47] why God is expressing to Abraham
[1:42:52] the Bible
[1:42:54] place it in a way after these things it
[1:42:56] makes you curious to go back
[1:43:00] Revelation chapter 4 the Bible says
[1:43:03] after this brother Branham say after
[1:43:05] what
[1:43:07] he said after the church ages so you
[1:43:10] will not appreciate Revelation chapter 4
[1:43:13] until you go to see what happened
[1:43:17] oh my God
[1:43:20] it's the Scarlet that wrote the Bible
[1:43:23] that break them into chapter
[1:43:27] but in the original straw is just one
[1:43:30] thing that rolls on and on and on and on
[1:43:34] even in the in in the original straw
[1:43:37] where where the passage end when you
[1:43:40] come to our Bible sometimes it's a
[1:43:42] middle verse
[1:43:44] of another chapter
[1:43:47] so the grace of connecting the events
[1:43:51] how one event leads to another
[1:43:54] comes by understanding the context
[1:44:01] praise the Lord
[1:44:02] now so Romans chapter 4.
[1:44:06] what shall we say then that Abraham our
[1:44:09] father as pertaining to the flesh has
[1:44:12] found
[1:44:14] when we think about Abraham flesh we
[1:44:17] think about Abraham weakness in his lies
[1:44:20] and everything that he did
[1:44:26] what can we say that that he have found
[1:44:30] for If Abraham were justified by works
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:38] he have whereof to Glory
[1:44:41] but not before God
[1:44:46] if he was just looking at his works
[1:44:49] how much what he can do then you know
[1:44:52] how much time he can pray how much time
[1:44:54] he can he can read and how come he if he
[1:44:57] if it was just those things that he was
[1:44:59] counting on
[1:45:01] he can glory in himself he can make
[1:45:04] himself to feel good but not before God
[1:45:11] but not before God
[1:45:15] so it will tell you that Abraham action
[1:45:18] Abraham action of Goring after a falling
[1:45:22] brother
[1:45:23] was not to be praised by a lot
[1:45:27] was not to have a connection with the
[1:45:30] king of Sodom
[1:45:33] he did it because he realized her
[1:45:36] brother has fallen from Grace
[1:45:39] praise the Lord
[1:45:41] and let him that stand there take Heat
[1:45:44] at least he fought also
[1:45:47] the best thing to do let me go and get
[1:45:49] him off so we can be too standing
[1:45:57] are we together
[1:46:00] for what Syria the scripture Abraham
[1:46:06] Abraham believed God
[1:46:08] and it was counted unto him for
[1:46:12] righteousness that's what the scripture
[1:46:15] says
[1:46:16] the scripture they now speak of Abraham
[1:46:18] Works they did not speak
[1:46:20] Abraham believed God
[1:46:26] now to him that worketh
[1:46:29] is the reward
[1:46:32] not reckon of Grace
[1:46:35] bar of debt
[1:46:38] praise the Lord
[1:46:39] if we think we can pay the debt of sin
[1:46:44] by by doing paintings and doing this
[1:46:47] there was that was the cursed thing that
[1:46:50] the Roman Church brought and introduced
[1:46:53] into Christianity
[1:46:56] praise the Lord
[1:46:58] that they have that that is that is just
[1:47:00] that is just a robin over uh uh the the
[1:47:04] the the car Master movement saw seed and
[1:47:07] and people would think that if they can
[1:47:09] do these things then they can gain God's
[1:47:12] favor
[1:47:16] praise the Lord
[1:47:20] Hallelujah
[1:47:27] you have to realize that Grace
[1:47:32] is on meritable favor
[1:47:37] praise the Lord
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:46] you receive from God something that you
[1:47:50] do not marry
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:56] amen then you know what Mercy is
[1:47:59] Mercy is also you receive from God
[1:48:04] what you do not deserve
[1:48:10] because what we deserve is a whip
[1:48:14] and mercy that's not what we deserve
[1:48:17] when we look at our action
[1:48:21] we look at our stubbornness what we
[1:48:23] deserve is Judgment condemnation but
[1:48:26] when God gave Mercy every morning
[1:48:33] that's why we can be grateful because we
[1:48:36] don't deserve it
[1:48:41] praise the Lord
[1:48:43] it's the same it's just it's just uh you
[1:48:46] know what it's just coming both ways and
[1:48:49] leave us out there is nothing nothing of
[1:48:52] ourself
[1:48:55] now so the scripture says here now to
[1:48:58] him that worketh is the reward not
[1:49:00] reckon of Grace but of there but to him
[1:49:02] that walketh net but believe
[1:49:05] on him they are justifying
[1:49:08] amen
[1:49:10] they're ongoing
[1:49:12] his faith is counted
[1:49:16] that faith
[1:49:18] their faith is counted
[1:49:22] praise the Lord
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:25] his faith is counted
[1:49:29] for righteousness
[1:49:36] your faith
[1:49:38] in the promised word
[1:49:42] let me let me read them your faith in
[1:49:45] the promised word is counter for
[1:49:47] righteousness
[1:49:49] but to him that worketh met Bob believed
[1:49:53] on him that justify it
[1:49:56] they're ongoing
[1:49:58] his faith is counter for righteousness
[1:50:01] even as David also described they were
[1:50:06] understanding that
[1:50:07] the way God was dealing with him
[1:50:11] he understood it that if God was dealing
[1:50:14] with me not calling to my iniquity I
[1:50:16] will be dead
[1:50:20] praise the Lord
[1:50:23] so he honest to it
[1:50:26] and he said blessed is the man unto whom
[1:50:29] God impute
[1:50:31] righteousness with our works
[1:50:37] blessed is the man that God will call A
[1:50:40] righteous Son of God a righteous
[1:50:43] daughter of God better man him said
[1:50:45] because you are believing in the
[1:50:46] righteous one
[1:50:51] you are confessing to the righteous one
[1:50:56] you are trusting in the righteous one
[1:51:03] Hallelujah
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:09] can you think about it a man after God's
[1:51:12] Own Heart
[1:51:13] that God will Express that you know and
[1:51:16] and and and and and and and make a man
[1:51:18] to to realize that you are a man after
[1:51:21] my own heart
[1:51:26] his desire of bringing the world back
[1:51:28] into the camp
[1:51:30] praise the Lord and everything that
[1:51:34] David
[1:51:36] but to realize that in the midst of all
[1:51:40] of that
[1:51:41] he had one of the worst fault
[1:51:48] praise the Lord
[1:51:50] he had one of the worst fought
[1:51:56] that even even all through the scripture
[1:51:59] the Bible will always refer to Solomon
[1:52:02] mother as you re uriah's wife
[1:52:07] praise the Lord can you imagine what it
[1:52:10] is when David comes to church
[1:52:13] and the preacher will be saying
[1:52:15] something and says uh you know uriah's
[1:52:18] wife you know what happened couple of
[1:52:20] years ago with uriah's wife
[1:52:24] if you know how Debbie fed
[1:52:28] he says in the congregation
[1:52:31] praise the Lord
[1:52:33] but yet he honors too that blessed is
[1:52:36] the man
[1:52:37] to whom that God
[1:52:40] do not impute his iniquity
[1:52:45] even David also describe the blessedness
[1:52:47] of the man to whom God imputed
[1:52:50] righteousness with our work saying
[1:52:52] blessed are they whose iniquity are
[1:52:54] forgiven
[1:52:57] and whose Saints are covered
[1:53:01] blessed is the man to whom the law will
[1:53:03] not impute iniquity
[1:53:06] praise the Lord
[1:53:08] amen
[1:53:10] am
[1:53:13] that that uh how can we call it
[1:53:16] backslided or or uh uh uh uh you know
[1:53:20] the Bible belong such a unique place in
[1:53:24] the scripture
[1:53:26] praise the Lord
[1:53:27] unique place in the scripture that God
[1:53:30] is dealing with him balam dreams and
[1:53:33] vision his heart they are Vindicated by
[1:53:36] scripture
[1:53:40] because the only place in the Bible
[1:53:42] where you can confirm the styles that
[1:53:45] the wise men saw is by uh Balaam
[1:53:48] prophecy a style will rise out of Jacob
[1:53:54] praise the Lord
[1:53:56] it's not much of a false prophet as you
[1:53:58] would think he has a place
[1:54:00] he has a very unique place
[1:54:03] now even he showed up over in the Book
[1:54:06] of Revelation
[1:54:08] bellam knew that these people were
[1:54:10] blessed
[1:54:13] he knew that there is no word there is
[1:54:16] nothing that balak is going to pay him
[1:54:18] that we work
[1:54:19] because from the very time he prayed God
[1:54:23] told him those people are blessed
[1:54:29] praise the Lord
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:34] he said I have not be held iniquity
[1:54:38] in Jacob
[1:54:41] I tried I tried I'm not saying
[1:54:45] nothing wrong
[1:54:47] but you know what Bill I'm dead
[1:54:50] you know what Bill I'm dead just to
[1:54:53] please balak
[1:54:55] he advised balak
[1:54:58] and told him you know how you will get
[1:55:01] these people
[1:55:02] send your girls among them
[1:55:10] praise the Lord
[1:55:11] he still wanted that favor
[1:55:15] so he advised Bala to bring them down to
[1:55:18] Barbour
[1:55:21] praise the Lord he said flesh is flesh
[1:55:25] I know they have a pillow of fire
[1:55:27] leading them
[1:55:29] I know there is Supernatural that is
[1:55:32] happening in their mess
[1:55:33] but strip the women naked
[1:55:37] praise the Lord
[1:55:39] just just get them to that place
[1:55:45] that's the reason why the Book of
[1:55:46] Revelation recorded
[1:55:49] villain and that's what the Bible says
[1:55:51] in the Book of Revelation he is the one
[1:55:53] that instructed by like that there is no
[1:55:56] way I can curse these people
[1:55:59] there is no way
[1:56:01] he went on the different types of the
[1:56:04] mountains every place that he went
[1:56:08] when you look at them he saw something
[1:56:10] Supernatural
[1:56:12] he can't see anything wrong
[1:56:16] why because
[1:56:18] the shout of the King was in the camp
[1:56:23] praise the Lord the Lord was among his
[1:56:26] people
[1:56:28] so he advised by like he says the way to
[1:56:31] get him
[1:56:34] is to bring them down to her feet don't
[1:56:36] stop them from coming true
[1:56:40] advise them just like how the
[1:56:43] Philistines wanted to know the strength
[1:56:45] of something what did they do
[1:56:47] the god of woman
[1:56:54] are we together
[1:56:56] blessed is the man in whom the Lord will
[1:56:59] not impure iniquity
[1:57:02] so faith is counter for righteousness
[1:57:06] when we can believe God
[1:57:10] believe God now not argue with the word
[1:57:13] of God not struggle with the word of God
[1:57:16] but take the word of God
[1:57:20] Lord your word is truth
[1:57:23] but I'm struggling
[1:57:26] Lord I believe
[1:57:28] my unbelief
[1:57:32] praise the Lord
[1:57:33] Lord I believe I believe the message of
[1:57:37] the hour I believe the word of God will
[1:57:40] help my own belief you know where my
[1:57:43] struggles are you know the things I'm
[1:57:45] dealing with
[1:57:46] don't put them off and think they will
[1:57:48] fly away supernaturally no
[1:57:51] address it
[1:57:53] identify it
[1:57:55] it's it's it's Grace
[1:57:59] it's the grace that is given to us in
[1:58:02] this hour
[1:58:03] because this is the hour of the
[1:58:06] Overcomers amen
[1:58:07] this is the hour of the Overcomers
[1:58:10] that's the reason why they're formed as
[1:58:13] the truth of God's word has come in this
[1:58:15] age like I said I've never even started
[1:58:17] preaching yet
[1:58:21] but it's it's okay we get it somewhere
[1:58:23] amen
[1:58:24] we are getting somewhere
[1:58:27] Hallelujah
[1:58:28] we are getting somewhere people
[1:58:33] glory be to God
[1:58:35] Hallelujah
[1:58:38] what if you
[1:58:40] if you heard my prayer requesting you
[1:58:42] and you said a word of prayer I can feed
[1:58:45] it
[1:58:49] amen
[1:58:51] I can feed it
[1:58:56] oh yeah I wanted to show you this also
[1:59:00] as I was talking on the emphasis of
[1:59:02] God's word Potter
[1:59:04] put the uh
[1:59:06] the slide up
[1:59:08] that have to do with Matthew chapter
[1:59:09] five
[1:59:11] uh
[1:59:12] I don't know how it's showing on you but
[1:59:14] it looks on my end it's the last slide
[1:59:17] uh is is uh it has that one jot or one
[1:59:21] title I wanted to show this to you
[1:59:25] because it's it's all part of our
[1:59:27] reading Jesus says now one
[1:59:30] job or one title will
[1:59:34] will uh we pass away okay if you want to
[1:59:38] just switch this light up again for us
[1:59:39] now so uh uh uh the English word say the
[1:59:45] Hebrew word is yuck
[1:59:47] and and it is just this apostrophe
[1:59:51] that what Jesus was referring to
[1:59:54] it looks like an apostrophe that I I
[1:59:57] will keep this in my mind there's
[1:59:59] another there's another scripture that I
[2:00:02] will bring to you to show you a York in
[2:00:05] in the Bible when Jesus said when they
[2:00:09] asked Jesus and he says my lord said
[2:00:12] unto my Lord what change that statement
[2:00:16] was just an apostrophe
[2:00:23] it's in the sense that Jesus is saying
[2:00:27] thing that I have come to destroy the
[2:00:30] Lord or the prophets have not come to
[2:00:32] destroy but to fulfill for verily I say
[2:00:35] unto you till heaven and have passed one
[2:00:39] judge one yard
[2:00:41] or one title
[2:00:43] not a period not an apostrophe
[2:00:48] of God's word
[2:00:52] we ever fail
[2:00:55] God will make sure that every dot in his
[2:00:58] word
[2:00:59] he would he would point he would put
[2:01:02] every God he will cross every team
[2:01:07] and just as how he would do it in the
[2:01:10] Fulfillment of his word that is the same
[2:01:12] thing he would do in our life
[2:01:16] praise the Lord he will make sure that
[2:01:18] every doctor needs to be placed in your
[2:01:21] life will be in place
[2:01:23] brother Branham said if he has to take
[2:01:25] you on the sick bed he will make sure he
[2:01:28] laid you down and put that dog across
[2:01:30] the team
[2:01:33] image
[2:01:37] the same way that now one
[2:01:40] dot our title will fall
[2:01:43] God will watch over his word
[2:01:47] and everything will fulfill just as he
[2:01:50] said it
[2:01:54] in fulfilling his word in the Bible
[2:01:56] and also fulfilling his word that is the
[2:02:00] purpose for your life
[2:02:02] he will make sure that every dot will be
[2:02:05] in place
[2:02:06] and every tea will be crossed
[2:02:09] you can trust him for that
[2:02:11] praise the Lord
[2:02:13] glory be to God
[2:02:15] are we together
[2:02:16] amen
[2:02:19] amen amen amen where am I
[2:02:24] where am I that let's go to an efficient
[2:02:26] efficient let's go to Ephesians chapter
[2:02:28] five Ephesians chapter five
[2:02:31] uh It's haunting my mind
[2:02:36] is haunting my mind
[2:02:38] Ephesians chapter 5.
[2:02:51] Ephesians chapter 5.
[2:02:55] now if you read the book of Ephesians
[2:02:58] brother Branham says efficient parallel
[2:03:00] Joshua he said just like how the book of
[2:03:03] Ephesians I mean the Book of Joshua
[2:03:05] plays the children of Israel rightly in
[2:03:07] the promised land he said that is the
[2:03:09] same thing that the book of Ephesians
[2:03:11] does a place to Believers right into the
[2:03:14] promise
[2:03:15] okay
[2:03:17] now so if you go through the book of
[2:03:19] Ephesians let's we will take that in in
[2:03:21] a kind of a fast way now in Ephesians
[2:03:24] chapter one that's where Paul talks
[2:03:25] about blessed be the God and father of
[2:03:28] our Lord Jesus Christ that have blessed
[2:03:30] us with all spiritual blessing in
[2:03:32] Heavenly places so Ephesians chapter 1
[2:03:35] brings us from the mind of God it's
[2:03:37] something that God did in his mind he
[2:03:39] blessed us I call him as he has chosen
[2:03:41] us before the foundation of the word so
[2:03:44] Ephesians chapter 1 takes us before
[2:03:46] there was a beginning
[2:03:48] it shows us what God did before he even
[2:03:52] brought you here
[2:03:54] okay that's what Ephesians 1 uh would do
[2:03:57] Ephesians chapter 2 what it does is
[2:04:01] there the Bible says you there were uh
[2:04:04] you have he quickened that were once
[2:04:06] dead in sin and trespass so Ephesians
[2:04:09] chapter 2 shows us our first birth
[2:04:13] we were born in sin and trespass
[2:04:16] but he have quick enough
[2:04:19] okay so better man is showing us that
[2:04:22] the Apostle Paul is placing us
[2:04:26] he's telling us that we we did not begin
[2:04:29] on whatever your birthday is
[2:04:32] your actual birthday goes back to the
[2:04:34] man of God
[2:04:37] praise the Lord
[2:04:38] amen now I'm not I'm not studying any
[2:04:41] Doctrine here and saying don't celebrate
[2:04:43] your birthday please please
[2:04:46] thank you
[2:04:47] your actual birthday because that
[2:04:50] religious groups do these things
[2:04:53] praise the Lord people get so fanatic I
[2:04:56] don't care about birthday I was born in
[2:04:57] the mind of God
[2:04:58] when they don't even understand what
[2:05:00] they're talking about
[2:05:02] they don't have a life to reflect it
[2:05:07] now so uh so uh Ephesians chapter 2
[2:05:11] brings you into your your your flip
[2:05:15] Earth Ephesians chapter one goes back to
[2:05:17] the man of God something that we are not
[2:05:19] conscious of we were not conscious of it
[2:05:22] that God choose us in him for us to be
[2:05:25] holy we were never conscious of it
[2:05:28] now efficient 2 brings us to our natural
[2:05:31] birth that we were born and seen in
[2:05:33] trespass and and and as as efficient two
[2:05:37] goals
[2:05:38] uh in verse 8 it says for by grace are
[2:05:43] you safe through faith
[2:05:45] so it brings us through our effort
[2:05:48] joining
[2:05:49] to show us that we were born in sin and
[2:05:52] trespass but we are saved by grace
[2:05:55] because God rich in Mercy
[2:05:58] amen because God reached in Mercy now
[2:06:03] when you come to Ephesians chapter 3 I'm
[2:06:05] just trying to do a a quick run here
[2:06:10] in Ephesians chapter 3 you will see
[2:06:13] where we are placed in the body
[2:06:18] we are placed in the body of Jesus
[2:06:21] Christ
[2:06:23] so we are saved by grace and because now
[2:06:26] we are saved by grace we are placed in
[2:06:28] the body let me take my verse here in
[2:06:31] Ephesians chapter three I never I never
[2:06:33] thought about this or else I could have
[2:06:34] done a good job
[2:06:35] in in lining up my my verses but uh
[2:06:40] now look here the Bible says verse 14
[2:06:44] for this cause I bow my knees toward the
[2:06:48] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[2:06:52] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[2:06:55] near what's the family name
[2:06:58] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:00] so when we are saved by grace Ephesians
[2:07:03] chapter 3 introduce us into the family
[2:07:08] he puts us in the family the family of
[2:07:12] God
[2:07:15] praise the Lord
[2:07:18] now and and now Ephesians chapter 4
[2:07:21] where Ephesians chapter 4 brings us now
[2:07:24] the Bible says there is one body and one
[2:07:28] spirit that verse four even as we are
[2:07:31] called in one hope of our calling one
[2:07:35] Lord One Faith one baptism one God the
[2:07:39] father of the father of all who is above
[2:07:43] all and true all and in you all
[2:07:47] praise the Lord
[2:07:49] but unto every one of us is giving Grace
[2:07:52] according to measure so what Paul is
[2:07:54] doing here now he's saying the other
[2:07:57] I identified our natural birth we are
[2:08:00] born in sin we are saved by grace
[2:08:03] we are placed into the family of God
[2:08:06] then God put us under his protective kid
[2:08:11] of the faithful Ministry
[2:08:13] tonight goddess
[2:08:15] so in Ephesians chapter 4 he's going to
[2:08:18] identify a fight for Ministry that is
[2:08:21] lacking onto the charity the same with
[2:08:24] the Caribbean God the throne there is a
[2:08:27] fight for Ministry that must guide us to
[2:08:30] the treat of life
[2:08:32] gun yeah it's guiding us back to what is
[2:08:36] in Ephesians chapter one
[2:08:38] it's just the love story of redemption
[2:08:42] this is your actual life
[2:08:45] that's the reason why you were born
[2:08:46] wherever you were born the day you were
[2:08:48] born and how you were born
[2:08:51] and that's the reason why you went
[2:08:52] through whatever you are when because
[2:08:54] this is the Journey of your life
[2:08:56] God choose you before the foundation of
[2:08:59] the word that you should lay before him
[2:09:01] holy Without Blame not depending on your
[2:09:05] ability but depending on what he's able
[2:09:08] to do because that is his word that was
[2:09:11] his choosing he's more than able to
[2:09:12] bring it to pass what are you believing
[2:09:14] or not if you don't believe it you will
[2:09:17] only deprive yourself and you will be
[2:09:20] enslaved to your sinful nature
[2:09:22] and make excuse of it but if you believe
[2:09:26] it you become an overcomer so Ephesians
[2:09:29] chapter 4 noun introduce you a post you
[2:09:32] on the F5 for Ministry for you to be
[2:09:35] able to identify the gifts that is in
[2:09:37] you
[2:09:38] the Bible says here uh
[2:09:44] come on now help me praise the Lord he
[2:09:47] gives some Apostles and some prophets
[2:09:49] and some evangelists some Pastor teacher
[2:09:51] for the perfecting of the sins for the
[2:09:54] working of the ministry for the edifying
[2:09:57] of the body till we all come to the
[2:09:59] unity of the faith the knowledge of the
[2:10:01] Son of God onto a perfect man
[2:10:04] not seamless perfection
[2:10:06] amen but on to a mature man because you
[2:10:11] see God did not made babies
[2:10:15] don't be out don't don't get me wrong
[2:10:17] now
[2:10:18] the Bible says God said let's make man
[2:10:24] let us make man in our image
[2:10:28] that's the reason why that very
[2:10:30] statement will tell you that there is no
[2:10:33] place for infant baptism in the
[2:10:34] scripture
[2:10:37] praise the Lord because the blood covers
[2:10:40] the child until they reach to the age of
[2:10:42] accountability that's when that's when
[2:10:45] gods are looking down upon their child
[2:10:48] to start breaking forth
[2:10:52] his work of creation
[2:10:55] yeah
[2:10:56] in your life
[2:11:03] praise the Lord
[2:11:05] every child goes right into the hands of
[2:11:07] God if you leave this life before the
[2:11:10] age of maturity so you see that the sins
[2:11:13] that is behind this is that
[2:11:18] the purpose of the Gospel
[2:11:21] is to make sounds
[2:11:24] and daughter in the image of God
[2:11:28] he's the one he used his word to work on
[2:11:32] us
[2:11:35] are we together
[2:11:39] praise the Lord
[2:11:40] so if we still want to play babies
[2:11:43] and be baby God is not he's he's not
[2:11:46] he's not attracted to that
[2:11:49] he's not attracted to that
[2:11:55] God is attracted to sonship
[2:12:00] here God is attracted to responsibility
[2:12:05] when you when you start learning to be
[2:12:07] responsible
[2:12:12] praise the Lord
[2:12:14] that's why he said tractor talk
[2:12:16] now bunch of complain and you complain
[2:12:19] about everything
[2:12:23] just looking for painting and looking
[2:12:24] for somebody to feel sorry for you
[2:12:28] God is not interested in that
[2:12:32] that's a baby you need butter to suck
[2:12:35] or we can give you a pacifier
[2:12:39] you pick this little thing you suck on
[2:12:41] it you chunky iron Crown wow wow wow
[2:12:45] when will we be a Son of God or the god
[2:12:47] of God still on God's word
[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:54] he can trust the past
[2:12:56] and look for the new beginning
[2:12:58] we say Sarah creating God
[2:13:02] he can give you a new beginning right
[2:13:04] now he can give you a new beginning
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:10] always dragging things from the past
[2:13:15] just looking for some kind of attention
[2:13:18] to complain and whine and one and one
[2:13:21] you can never go anywhere with god with
[2:13:24] that kind of for attitude
[2:13:36] so we can come to the Statue of a
[2:13:38] perfect man onto the measure of the
[2:13:41] Statue of the fullness he says verse 14
[2:13:45] there we hence for be no more children
[2:13:49] what no more children
[2:13:53] oh let me wait for the boys to put that
[2:13:55] thing up so we can read it together
[2:13:58] we can be no more children what the
[2:14:02] Bible says
[2:14:04] tall and fourth
[2:14:07] carried away with everything
[2:14:14] every small thing we want wow
[2:14:18] blow it out of proportion
[2:14:21] what kind of God we said that is not in
[2:14:23] control
[2:14:25] what can I call yourself that is not in
[2:14:27] control
[2:14:28] that whatsoever you are dealing with he
[2:14:30] can't bring it under control
[2:14:36] carried about with every
[2:14:39] toss about and carry it about with every
[2:14:41] wings of Doctrine
[2:14:46] praise the Lord but that's not why I'm
[2:14:48] getting to you let's travel so chapter 4
[2:14:51] it Place us on a God's protection
[2:14:55] we are introduced into the body
[2:14:58] baptized by one baptism One Faith one
[2:15:02] hope
[2:15:04] so now we are under God's protection
[2:15:07] he gave us a four five four Ministry to
[2:15:10] guide us point us to the Tree of Life
[2:15:13] so we can start eating
[2:15:17] we can start eating we can start feeding
[2:15:20] from our to your family
[2:15:21] we can start going back to the beginning
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:29] because he expects us to be mature
[2:15:33] chapter 5 what does he do he does he
[2:15:36] brought he brings us into a marriage
[2:15:42] now Paul always starts right here
[2:15:45] be here therefore follower of Maine as
[2:15:48] dear children and walk in love as Christ
[2:15:50] has to love us then he goes on then he
[2:15:53] brings us into the marriage coveting
[2:15:57] amen
[2:15:58] praise the Lord now this is where I want
[2:16:01] to I want to grab you just follow me
[2:16:03] he brings us here he talks about all
[2:16:06] these wonderful things
[2:16:07] and then he brings us at the end of
[2:16:10] faith
[2:16:11] verse 32 this is a great mystery I speak
[2:16:15] of Christ in the church he's talking
[2:16:17] about all the marriage now man like like
[2:16:19] Christ woman like the church and all of
[2:16:20] that he brings us right here he said
[2:16:23] this is a great mystery I speak of
[2:16:24] Christ and the church nevertheless let
[2:16:27] every man every one of you
[2:16:30] in particular so love his wife even as
[2:16:34] himself and a wife
[2:16:37] sees there she reference of her husband
[2:16:40] now look at what is going to happen
[2:16:44] look at what is going to happen people
[2:16:46] I want you to pay attention
[2:16:48] praise the Lord
[2:16:50] I want you to pay attention because when
[2:16:52] brother Branham says when the seals open
[2:16:54] the Bible became a new book it's not
[2:16:56] just a slogan
[2:16:58] it is not just a slogan
[2:17:02] it is because thou opening of the seals
[2:17:05] has make us to now pay attention
[2:17:09] when we are reading
[2:17:11] and make us to pay attention what what
[2:17:13] what is happening here what is this
[2:17:16] connection that Paul is going to bring
[2:17:18] from this great marriage
[2:17:21] great mixture of marriage
[2:17:24] and then he brings it right into
[2:17:28] children obey your parents
[2:17:31] in the Lord
[2:17:34] for this is right
[2:17:37] honor your father
[2:17:39] and mother
[2:17:41] which is the first commandment
[2:17:44] with promise
[2:17:46] that should grab your attention
[2:17:51] that you grab your attention
[2:17:54] and when we talk about
[2:17:57] gory was
[2:17:59] I see it right here
[2:18:03] that this Commandment that is with
[2:18:05] promise
[2:18:07] comes with the reward of God blessing
[2:18:09] you
[2:18:10] with a garlic marriage
[2:18:15] praise the Lord
[2:18:18] amen
[2:18:19] oh we know the devil right from the
[2:18:22] beginning he fights against marriage
[2:18:23] just like I said
[2:18:25] amen he was a serpent that was made
[2:18:27] without a wife
[2:18:30] he was the only creature that didn't
[2:18:32] know how to help mate
[2:18:35] God made him alone because he was
[2:18:38] designed
[2:18:41] for the work of redemption
[2:18:44] praise the Lord if he had a wife he
[2:18:46] would not bother with Adam why he will
[2:18:48] go on with his wife
[2:18:52] praise the Lord
[2:18:57] so right from the beginning he's not
[2:18:59] happy because he was the only one that
[2:19:02] was left out
[2:19:03] one time it was Adam and myself we were
[2:19:06] alone
[2:19:08] but after a while I see Adam walking
[2:19:10] with her help me I don't have no help
[2:19:12] mate
[2:19:18] praise the Lord but this is what I want
[2:19:20] to I want to assure you here
[2:19:22] amen the scripture fights I mean the uh
[2:19:27] shows us that the devil you know he he
[2:19:30] fights against it because he knows
[2:19:33] this is the progression
[2:19:35] this is the progression of uh
[2:19:40] uh many years ago I preached on
[2:19:43] intimate relationship when uh when I use
[2:19:46] the book of of
[2:19:50] efficient
[2:19:52] to just show how our relationship
[2:19:55] progress
[2:19:57] how God deals with us
[2:19:59] and then he expects also that our our
[2:20:03] relationship you know with our family we
[2:20:07] also progress
[2:20:10] praise the Lord no doubt many families
[2:20:14] they have high struggle over the years
[2:20:18] they were able to find promises in God's
[2:20:21] word that they fought for their home
[2:20:23] they fought for their marriages
[2:20:25] and God reward him because he said
[2:20:28] rewarded
[2:20:30] praise the Lord but some were rewarded
[2:20:34] amen
[2:20:37] and it goes It goes in in many different
[2:20:40] ways now don't miss understanding me now
[2:20:42] don't misunderstand me I want you to
[2:20:45] just us to just bring ourselves in a
[2:20:47] place where we can be able to understand
[2:20:49] all of these things because he's a
[2:20:52] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[2:20:54] him
[2:20:56] praise the Lord
[2:20:57] yeah we're seeing a promise here where
[2:21:00] God is now
[2:21:02] time something year uh uh uh you know
[2:21:07] children obey your parents in the law
[2:21:09] for this is right honor your father and
[2:21:11] mother and Paul is making us to realize
[2:21:14] that this is a Commandment that is tied
[2:21:16] to a promise
[2:21:19] it's tied to a promise
[2:21:24] praise the Lord
[2:21:25] it's tied to a promise and especially
[2:21:27] for for many of our young people
[2:21:32] the the the place of Parenthood
[2:21:37] is a very beautiful design
[2:21:41] the reason why God gave us parents he
[2:21:44] did not churn Us From Heaven
[2:21:48] for us to just drop down in the hospital
[2:21:52] some of us would not even live
[2:21:55] the reason why he gave us parents
[2:21:58] is a beautiful design
[2:22:00] of God
[2:22:03] praise the Lord
[2:22:04] amen
[2:22:06] many things that we we deal with in our
[2:22:11] lives
[2:22:12] you know most most especially as
[2:22:14] children uh you have to go back
[2:22:17] sometimes just reflect a little bit
[2:22:23] your relationship with your parents
[2:22:27] now for many that did not hide that it
[2:22:31] can really create a struggle
[2:22:35] they can really create a struggle
[2:22:39] faith is not blind
[2:22:42] praise the Lord
[2:22:44] faith is now blind
[2:22:47] Faith instruct us
[2:22:50] Faith make us to reflect
[2:22:53] especially when we are dealing things
[2:22:54] dealing with things
[2:22:57] praise the Lord
[2:22:59] it makes us to reflect
[2:23:01] that's the reason why that great story
[2:23:03] about The Prodigal Son
[2:23:06] a laser place in Scripture
[2:23:11] a laser place in Scripture
[2:23:16] many of us are not from fought in their
[2:23:18] homes where we have everything that was
[2:23:20] provided for us
[2:23:27] but yet I mean some of us are even our
[2:23:30] parents were not we're not we're not
[2:23:32] Christians some were not dedicated
[2:23:34] Christians some were not message
[2:23:35] believers
[2:23:37] even the ones that were message
[2:23:39] believers they still had their struggle
[2:23:44] praise the Lord
[2:23:46] they still had their struggle you will
[2:23:48] see when Paul deals with this situation
[2:23:50] over in the book of
[2:23:54] collusion
[2:23:56] he deals with faith in another way
[2:24:00] he said parents do not provoke your
[2:24:02] children
[2:24:05] amen because you could stumble them
[2:24:09] you could stumble them
[2:24:13] you you go it can be almost like the
[2:24:16] Young Rich ruler brother Branham said
[2:24:18] their Young Rich ruler was successful
[2:24:21] until it came to the place where he was
[2:24:24] supposed to get under a Godly leadership
[2:24:28] that he did not even know his way
[2:24:32] he was he was stumbled by his parents
[2:24:34] they taught him everything right they
[2:24:36] make him a successful businessman but
[2:24:39] the leadership of the ministry he was
[2:24:41] honored the Pharisees were dwelling on
[2:24:44] on the things of all they could not
[2:24:46] identify the promise of the day yes
[2:24:49] so when he got to that place
[2:24:52] they stumble him
[2:24:55] he'll stumble him
[2:24:57] even though he fulfilled he obeyed the
[2:25:00] Commandments from the day he was he was
[2:25:02] just doing it because his parents told
[2:25:04] him to do it
[2:25:06] this idea from the days of my youth
[2:25:09] but how can I get internal life he knew
[2:25:12] that he was empty
[2:25:14] Within
[2:25:18] he was empty
[2:25:20] praise the Lord
[2:25:25] and that's why we don't want for you
[2:25:26] young people
[2:25:29] we want you to have an experience with
[2:25:32] Christ
[2:25:33] he want we want your experience to be a
[2:25:35] personal experience
[2:25:38] not just holding to your parents
[2:25:41] amen
[2:25:43] we want you to have a personal
[2:25:45] experience and that's the reason why I
[2:25:48] will continue to stand against it
[2:25:51] as Paris you are not the Holy Ghost for
[2:25:54] your children
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:25:58] you need to point them to the Holy Ghost
[2:26:01] we are God we we are there I'm not your
[2:26:04] Holy Ghost either I'm not your Holy
[2:26:07] Ghost
[2:26:16] are we together
[2:26:19] this is the problem it's both ways
[2:26:22] is both ways
[2:26:25] train up a child in a way that he will
[2:26:27] grow though he can order he will not
[2:26:29] depart from it
[2:26:30] we supposed to be the trainer
[2:26:34] we're supposed to be preparing them
[2:26:36] because there are different stages in
[2:26:39] life brother Branham says the first
[2:26:41] teacher is the mother
[2:26:43] she's the Fifth Gospel
[2:26:45] that's the first teacher
[2:26:48] praise the Lord
[2:26:51] then the mother works with the school
[2:26:53] teacher
[2:26:54] amen and you you will find it you will
[2:26:57] find it in most home
[2:26:59] praise the Lord
[2:27:01] and then the next teacher is the father
[2:27:06] just when that charm is is is getting to
[2:27:09] their Teenage life is getting to that
[2:27:12] place of decision
[2:27:14] they need to have a Godly father
[2:27:17] they need to have a man
[2:27:20] that can point them back to the
[2:27:22] scripture
[2:27:25] they need to have a man that can wave
[2:27:28] they're talking before them
[2:27:31] you need to have a father that that the
[2:27:35] sea Goring told the doorpost and put in
[2:27:38] the blood on the lintel of the door
[2:27:40] pulls
[2:27:42] they need to see that
[2:27:45] they gave the child confidence
[2:27:50] are we together
[2:27:51] now you have to realize that I'm doing
[2:27:53] this because I promise you that I would
[2:27:55] do it I just did not know when
[2:27:58] I told you about all of these Wild
[2:28:00] Brothers to the series of marriage and
[2:28:01] divorce so that's that's what I'm
[2:28:03] thrilling on now so and uh so you you
[2:28:06] you see that
[2:28:09] okay yeah Paul have it right down yeah
[2:28:11] he have it right down here uh right here
[2:28:13] in efficiencies verse four and your
[2:28:15] father provoked not your children unto
[2:28:17] Wrath but bring them up in in in the
[2:28:21] nurture and ammunition of the Lord
[2:28:23] so you see here
[2:28:26] uh there's there's a great thing yeah I
[2:28:28] I have to find a place to close here uh
[2:28:31] uh before I kind of fall over overburden
[2:28:34] you but I I just want to grab your mind
[2:28:37] on this you know I was thinking on that
[2:28:39] the whole last night uh uh God telling
[2:28:41] Abraham I'm your great in exceeding
[2:28:44] reward God rewarding Abraham because he
[2:28:48] he did the right thing
[2:28:50] and the whole thing about reward is on
[2:28:53] my uh what's on my mind the hold of last
[2:28:55] night uh uh you know and and trusting
[2:28:58] the Lord how to bring it you know God
[2:29:01] rewards when we follow God's word and do
[2:29:04] the best you know uh that uh that uh we
[2:29:07] know how to do from a True Heart
[2:29:11] praise the Lord
[2:29:13] amen
[2:29:14] God never reward a rebellion spirit
[2:29:20] don't take off no form of rebellion
[2:29:22] Spirit to your parents
[2:29:25] because you know what
[2:29:27] it will wait for you in your house
[2:29:31] if you take out a rebellious Spirit it
[2:29:33] will wait for you in your house
[2:29:38] God told David because you did this
[2:29:41] your sons will do it
[2:29:49] praise the Lord
[2:29:52] disagreeing is not it's not
[2:29:56] being rebellious
[2:29:58] amen if you can just only says well
[2:30:02] because I don't understand it I don't
[2:30:03] see it that way
[2:30:07] and let me be to the place to pray for
[2:30:09] the grace for you to see it
[2:30:14] that's that's not being rebellious
[2:30:15] that's Being Earnest I don't see it
[2:30:19] it's completely different from oh I I
[2:30:21] see it but I'm not going to do it
[2:30:26] it's completely different
[2:30:30] and it's all in your heart
[2:30:33] it's all in your heart it's all in your
[2:30:35] mind
[2:30:40] so you see there is a connection here
[2:30:43] there is a connection
[2:30:45] poor cloud in this whole thing with a
[2:30:48] mystery of Christ in his church
[2:30:52] and it's a mystical body coming into
[2:30:55] that that mystical relationship
[2:31:02] we are growing into that mystical
[2:31:05] relationship
[2:31:06] that's the reason why we want to be
[2:31:08] acquainted with the word because this is
[2:31:10] the voice of our bridegroom
[2:31:17] this is the voice of our bridegroom
[2:31:25] are we together
[2:31:27] praise the Lord as as much as many times
[2:31:31] it's difficult
[2:31:33] is difficult when we get in debt cycle
[2:31:37] of uh as uh you know experiencing our
[2:31:41] emotion and the changes of feelings that
[2:31:43] we have in us as much as it is difficult
[2:31:47] to be able to trust anyone with the way
[2:31:50] you feel within you
[2:31:52] I will advise you
[2:31:54] don't keep it from your parents
[2:31:59] praise the Lord
[2:32:01] they're not going to make choices for
[2:32:03] you
[2:32:04] but it has to be on a very Earnest
[2:32:09] ground of conversation
[2:32:14] praise the Lord don't go on the shopping
[2:32:18] spree
[2:32:19] and everything
[2:32:22] buy what you want to buy
[2:32:25] and then bring it home
[2:32:28] no make it a conversation
[2:32:32] the prophet of God said we should have
[2:32:33] our homes open right minority friends of
[2:32:36] our if this is your friend yet it's my
[2:32:38] friend
[2:32:39] praise the Lord
[2:32:41] amen
[2:32:43] and as as we all growed we realize then
[2:32:46] we we don't become judgmental
[2:32:49] it helps it helps the parents to to know
[2:32:52] what you are dealing with and it gets
[2:32:53] they get down in praying for you
[2:32:58] now if you make if you have already made
[2:33:01] the decision so what is going to be now
[2:33:02] is that you you get you you are either
[2:33:05] going to accept what I'm bringing to you
[2:33:07] or you and myself we're going to be in
[2:33:09] trouble that's when most of the parents
[2:33:12] and children relationship becomes rocket
[2:33:16] praise the Lord
[2:33:18] amen but when but when it has got to
[2:33:21] that place where it says and and most of
[2:33:23] the time what parents are looking for is
[2:33:26] to realize that you are convinced of
[2:33:29] what you are doing if you can prove it
[2:33:31] to them that you are convinced it's not
[2:33:33] your ma now that your head is spinning
[2:33:35] on your shoulder but you are convinced
[2:33:38] because I can see it in the word of God
[2:33:40] you know the scripture says this and I
[2:33:42] did the prophet if you can convince them
[2:33:44] any parent will back up
[2:33:47] any parent that fear God will back up
[2:33:50] because they know that they cannot play
[2:33:52] God in your life they know that they
[2:33:55] have a son and a daughter of God that is
[2:33:57] in connection with God they are praying
[2:34:00] about what they are dealing with
[2:34:02] any parent will back up
[2:34:06] but if you just coming to them you know
[2:34:09] because they have a cracked Heating and
[2:34:10] their teeth is white in their you know I
[2:34:12] like their smell they know it's just
[2:34:15] like your hair just spinning on your
[2:34:16] shoulder
[2:34:17] because when your hair starts spinning
[2:34:19] you just see things you see things they
[2:34:22] just become so colorful to you
[2:34:27] praise the Lord
[2:34:36] that's what God bless
[2:34:39] he know that he have a son he have a
[2:34:41] daughter
[2:34:42] that have have done the ideal diligence
[2:34:44] they have prayed they have sorted God
[2:34:46] the Lord through God's word they are
[2:34:48] following this thing by the word of God
[2:34:50] it does not mean that you will not have
[2:34:52] battle you will have it but because you
[2:34:54] have started with the word you will
[2:34:56] always resolve it with the word
[2:35:00] it will not be difficult for you to come
[2:35:02] back to the world
[2:35:09] praise the Lord
[2:35:11] now let me let me let me go quickly here
[2:35:13] and close up
[2:35:15] I promised you I was closing in an hour
[2:35:17] a year
[2:35:19] it's been one hour ago I said that
[2:35:22] let me close up there there are a few
[2:35:24] things I want to I want to I want to
[2:35:27] bring here this is this is one Terry
[2:35:30] musicians you can come we will close
[2:35:33] we'll find another time to share with
[2:35:35] you what we left up

[2:35:40] I am your great and exceeding reward
[2:35:44] God Rewards
[2:35:46] praise the Lord
[2:35:48] that's the reason why we must not go
[2:35:51] on our feelings it must be on the word
[2:35:54] of God
[2:35:55] because heaven and F will pass away
[2:35:58] but now one Apostle feeding God's word
