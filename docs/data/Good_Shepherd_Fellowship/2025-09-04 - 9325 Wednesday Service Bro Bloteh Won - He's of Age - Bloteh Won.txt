We love you father in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you musicians. That will be it for the music tonight. And uh uh let's take our Bibles. St. John chapter 9. Praise the Lord. St. John chapter 9. I know uh we left off uh talking about uh uh building and uh troubles time. That's what we were speaking on before we took a break. And uh but tonight we just we just want to look at something uh just to encourage you and then on Sunday we can get back to our subject if the Lord will allow us to so so so John chapter 9 tonight. Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you for for coming out and uh praise the Lord St. John chapter 9. This is uh chapter a part of the Bible that is very familiar to us. But I just want to look at something a little bit. Let's read together. And as Jesus passed by, he saw the man which was blind from his birth. Praise the Lord. I always make this mistake when I say, "Let's read together." I meaning I'm reading. So I said, "Let's read together." And I start reading so fast and and you say, "But he said, "Let's read together." Why is he reading that way? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want you to just follow me. That's that's why I say that. So I'm sorry. Verse uh uh verse two. And his disciple asked him, saying, "Master, who did sin, this man or his parents? That he was born blind?" And Jesus answered, "Neither had this man seen none his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day. The night cometh when no man can work. As long as I am in the word, I am the light of the word. &gt;&gt; When he had thus spoken, he sat on the ground and made clay of the sp. And he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. And he said unto him, "Go watch in the pool of Salem, which is by interpretation sin." He went and he went his way therefore and watched and came seeing. The neighbors therefore and they which behold which before has seen him that he was blind said, "Is not this he that sat in the egg?" Some said this is he. Others said he is like him. But he said I am he. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You can have your seat while we continue to read. Therefore said they unto him, how were thine eyes open? He answered and said, "A man that is called Jesus make clay and anoint my eyes and said unto me, go to the pool of Salem and watch." And I went and watched, and I received sight. Then said they unto him, "Where is he?" He said, "I know that." They brought uh to the Pharisees him their full time was blind and it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made a clay and open his eyes. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he have how he have received his sight. He said unto them, he put clay upon my eyes and I washed and do see. Therefore says some of the Pharisees, this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others said, "How can a man that is a sinner do such miracle?" And there was a division among them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a division among them because uh it was evident that what has happened is of God. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the division was because there was one group that was trapped in their tradition and uh and unless it comes through their tradition, unless it comes through the way that uh uh they have known it to be, they don't accept it to be of God. But there is another group of them also that uh uh they can't explain it but they know it is only God that can give a man his sight back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And uh this is the very same scripture that brother Brandham uh read when he preached the message taking sides with Jesus. you know, he he referred to this and then he said uh uh uh even though they could see that this was evident that this was of God, but they were trying to blackmail Jesus for the people not to believe the work that God has done. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will read a little more verse 17. They said unto the blind man again, what sever thou of him that he have opened thine eyes? He said he is a prophet. But the Jews did not be believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that have received his sight. And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son? Who you said was born blind? How then does he now see?" What does that matter? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the danger of of uh of religion. Yeah. &gt;&gt; His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. But by what means he now seeth, we know not." &gt;&gt; All who have opened his eyes, we know not. &gt;&gt; He is of age. &gt;&gt; It is just that word that caught my mind. He is of age. &gt;&gt; Are you of age tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you of age? &gt;&gt; Can you be able to defend what is happening in your life? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you of age to be able to defend what is happening in your life? Are you of age for you to be able to give your testimony &gt;&gt; even if nobody believe you? &gt;&gt; Are you of age to stand alone? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We know that he is of age. Ask him. &gt;&gt; He shall speak for himself. &gt;&gt; These words speak his parents because they fear the Jews. For the Jews have agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogues. Therefore his parents, therefore said his parents, he is of age. Ask him. Then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him, give God the praise. We know that this man is a sinner. The man of age said, he answered and said, whether he be a sinner or no, I know not. &gt;&gt; One thing I know &gt;&gt; that whereas I was blind, &gt;&gt; now I see. Amen. &gt;&gt; First about whether he's a sinner, &gt;&gt; first about whether he's a devil. &gt;&gt; But what I know, &gt;&gt; I was not seeing &gt;&gt; and now I can see. &gt;&gt; This one, you can't tell me I'm blind. &gt;&gt; You can say he's a sinner. He's a Greek. &gt;&gt; He's a Samaritan. He's a Roman. But this one, &gt;&gt; for the fact that I can see this one, you can't deny it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads tonight. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; oh God, we just want to thank you, Lord. We want to thank you for what grace has done in our life. &gt;&gt; We sing that song, Amazing Grace. How sweet that sound. You save a rush that I am. &gt;&gt; I once was blind, but now I see. is not just a song oh God but father is a reality Lord yes a man oh God father that we have just read about the parents say he's of age and oh God I pray tonight that your grace Lord will just come and help us as we just look into your word to you be the praise glory and honor in Jesus name amen praise the lord we'll come back to that let's go to Ephesians Ephesians chapter 4. Ephesians chapter 4 tonight. I'm trying to dust myself up a little bit. Amen. Trying to dust myself up a little bit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 4, Paul will speak here unto us. Paul will speak here unto us. Uh Let me now take uh from verse 11. Let me add the five for ministrating to it. And and then we get to what I want to I want for those to notice tonight. And he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry for the edifiring of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man onto the measure measure &gt;&gt; of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the statue of the perfect man is the image of the fullness of Christ. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will go there in a little bit tonight. And uh uh till we all come to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the son of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To the knowledge of the son of God is not knowing Jesus of Nazareth. &gt;&gt; The knowledge of the son of God is the word of God for your age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word of God for our age is the son of God is the manifestation of the son of God in our day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we want to come to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the son of God. unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was of age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we henceforth be no more children to store to and forth and carried about with every winds of doctrine. Not only wings of doctrine, but carried about with every little wind that blow us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What what we what we don't realize is that the uh when a when a when a seed is planted when the tree grows it grows in two different direction we see the plant that comes upward but there's another growth that goes down into the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and when the uh the wind comes and go uh we can tell that that sea has a root in the earth. It has a growth in the earth because it is standing the toes and forth of the wind. Amen. that we hencefor be no more children to and for and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the side of men and the con craftiness whereby the they the laid in way to deceive. that speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this uh this evening just uh just uh for the little hesitation and uh uh to uh to kind of for reconnect with you again uh we just uh uh want to talk a little bit on uh uh on growing up. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's of age. We want to talk about that. We just want to take that as uh as uh a little hesitation tonight. I will read few things uh uh some things that were said in the light of uh of the quote that we or the scripture we read tonight. And uh I didn't send note up there to the to the tech team. So you just there with me. Just follow follow with me tonight. Amen. And uh just follow with me believing that the Lord will will be able to to help us. Praise the Lord. Amen. We thank the Lord for a few brothers that came through. Brother Tim and brother came in and brother Solomon they all called and greet him and uh they wanted us to to greet you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandon will talk here in the message taking sides with Jesus. Just follow me as we will just want to make few comment here. But Brandon says, "So they wanted to make a big display out of it because they hated him. They wasn't thinking of the poor blind man that had just received his sight. &gt;&gt; They were not happy &gt;&gt; that joy has come to this family. &gt;&gt; This boy has laid from since he was a little boy. Everyone knew that uh you know and even just just even see the mind of the disciples asking was it because of his parents it is is because that's the way they were taught whether it was sin or whether it was sickness it was always attributed to uh either the child sin or the parent sin or the great parent sin praise the lord &gt;&gt; so they were not concerned about the Right. Uh they were not thinking of that poor blind man. They but they wanted to make a big display to make the people keep away from him. They said they wanted to ask his father and his mother. So they went and got his father and his mother and they asked him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the father and mother was afraid. The Bible says cause they know that they will put them out of the synagogues if they emate but they emitted to what they know that this is our son as far as we can tell the one that was born blind this is him. We can identify by his fingers, by his toes, you know, uh his height. This is the boy. &gt;&gt; But that part of where he went from blind to receiving his sight, we can tell you what happened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon says, "Oh, probably a few thousand people standing there. If them Pharisees could only put uh a blame on his name right there or done something to scare the people that they have run him out of there for that meeting all of his influence who have been lost. So all of this was just to destroy his influence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this was just to destroy his influence. The last time we preached we spoke on borrow vessel and we have to know that every one of us are borrow vessels and and men through the scripture that God will use. Brother Brandon was a borrow vessel. Amen. A a vessel that God took from the house of a drunken father and uh hh you know and and and had an angel to watch over him. If not, he was going to be a drunker himself. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. If he was going to be a drunker himself and uh uh but God borrowed that vessel to be able to fulfill his word in this day. Praise the Lord. Now, so uh it is it is at this place as we grow together and we talk about growth. One of the thing that is important is for us to be able to to separate the the the working of God from the flesh of a man. &gt;&gt; We must be able to separate what is divine and what is human. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because uh uh uh we will realize that's what these Jews were struggling with when it comes to this. And uh uh Paul will say I also have that in my reading here. When I was a child, I spoke as a child. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when we grow up, when we become of age, Paul says, I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I think the marriage of the lamb is of a bride that is uh that is that is coming to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is uh uh uh is is is for the bride is for the people that are coming to maturity. And our maturity is a better understanding of what God is doing in our day, what he's doing in our life, &gt;&gt; what he's doing in our home, &gt;&gt; what he's doing in our family. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. At least we must be able to put u uh uh give a reason why we come here why why we come here you know why why we come here into this assembling why we still believe the message of the hour &gt;&gt; what what does it means to you praise the lord &gt;&gt; as we come up to age we are not just following because we should follow &gt;&gt; but uh uh we have an answer amen &gt;&gt; we have an answer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have an answer. So in in the principle of growing tonight, just like I said, Paul referenced something here. He says that and onto the perfect man onto the measure of the statue of the fullness of Christ. So let's go to Peter where he talks about the statue of the perfect man. because in our our uh our subject of uh building in troubleous time that's one of the place we were going to come to and uh uh I'm just trying to find like I said trying to find my foot in tonight. Amen. trying to get back into the pull pit after being away for just a week. Praise the Lord. Just after having a week away, I'm feeling backsliding. So, I'm trying to get back into the pit. Let's go to second Peter chapter 1. Second Peter, chapter 1. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I have something I was going to talk on tonight, but I thought, well, let me just find my 14. Peter will talk here and which of course we we are very familiar with uh Simon Peter the seven and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen. according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and to virtue whereby I ging unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the word through lust &gt;&gt; and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look at this this principle of adding to your faith uh for for the wide as babies growing up in the message, we we first thought that you know it is something that we can we can uh you know do for our faith to grow or you know we have to do for us to be able to get virtue knowledge and the rest of them. But uh uh uh one time I was studying on this subject and uh I was I was thinking about it and one of the thing that helped me to be able to understand you know brother Brandon he talked about it. If you if we go over uh if we go over to Genesis that is the C chapter. If we go over to Genesis that is the C chapter. You look in Genesis chapter 30. You look in Genesis chapter 30 verse 24. The Bible says here this is Richard that is speaking 30 verse 22. And God remember Richard and God here came to her and opened her womb and she conceived and be a son and said God has taken away my reproach and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to mean another son. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even in in in her in her in her child labor laboring to bring forth Joseph, she's prophes she's prophesying. Now the word I want you to watch is add. The Lord shall add. &gt;&gt; Add unto your faith. &gt;&gt; So the Lord adding to her another son. He's not coming from somewhere else. Are you seeing the are you grabbing the concept? &gt;&gt; She's not going to get him from outside. It's going to come from inside. &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brandon says all these virtues are already in you. &gt;&gt; So add onto your faith. you know uh add in the in a sense that we we understand the word add is take something else and put it on top &gt;&gt; but it said in childbearing she says the Lord will add onto me another son &gt;&gt; if I'm giving birth to this one definite another one is going to come &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; and then Think about it. Now we all we talking what we are talking on tonight is a growing principle. So uh if you think about it, you look here the Bible says that u uh uh giving all diligence uh to your faith. But uh uh we are adding to faith and uh we are not adding to anything to get faith. Are you are you seeing what I'm saying? Praise the Lord. The Bible says add to your faith which mean there is that just like uh uh uh you know uh uh Paul says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. Brother Brandham says faith is a gift just like salvation is a free gift that is given to us. Faith is a gift that is given to the believer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are not hiding faith, but you are adding onto your faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's coming to that man that is of old age. Coming to the statue of the perfect man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh we we we see here that uh yeah uh uh faith is a gift that is given to the believer and then uh uh as as as we grow as we give birth to faith. Let me say it in that way just like Richard giving birth to to Joseph and saying the Lord lay out to me another son. Praise the Lord. As we are giving birth to faith, which mean we we we we are beginning to express faith in God's word, we are beginning to take God at his word. We are beginning to trust God, we are beginning to live out the word of God. Praise the Lord. As we are giving birth to faith, &gt;&gt; then he has on virtue. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you are we are you are you understanding? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But now see uh uh uh see the way that uh uh that brother Brandham will will lay the foundation for this faith that we give birth to vetu. And uh and then uh as virtue is being born, we know that he will add to us another son knowledge. As knowledge is being born, he will you will add to us another son. And then we will grow as we grow up like that into the statue of a perfect man. But uh yeah, brother Brandon would tell us, praise the Lord. Let's uh let's go back to the Bible. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh Let's go to Mark. Uh let's go to Mark chapter 10. Praise the Lord. Now we know that uh uh in in the message perfect faith brother Brandham will will tell us that uh how uh that's actually Mark chapter 11 how uh you know Jesus grew in perfect faith and uh uh and then all of this will come to this place of heard uh you know u uh he would speak to the disciples about uh them being of little faith and we know how Mark chapter 11 is tied over to the temple. Mark chapter 11 is tied to perfect faith. So all of that and then and is is right at the beginning of where the rest of the virtue is added on. So, so brother Brandham in perfect faith he tells us and he also speak of that in in uh uh the statue of the perfect man that's Mark chapter 11 sorry I said Mark chapter 10 and it it all goes back to the uh the fig tree verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roof and Peter called to remembrance prince said to the master, "Behold, the fig tree which thou cursed is wither away." And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Have faith in God." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. He's telling them to have faith in God, but yet he's also going to show a principle how this faith will grow. Now remember now we are not adding faith because faith is is a gift that comes with our birth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It it comes with our new birth when we are born again. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we are born again uh uh uh uh something is in us to believe the supernatural to believe the invisible God. Amen. To believe that he is there. He is here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is with us wherever we go. &gt;&gt; That's that sense that six sense is is inact in us is is stimulated in us for us to believe in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; but he also going to show us a principle which of course that is what uh uh the Lord also showed brother Brandham in this uh uh uh tu. Have faith in God. Verily I said unto you, that whatsoever ye shall uh uh that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be there removed, and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he have said shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore I said unto you, what thingsoever ye desire, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever ye desire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This desire is not just a thought. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this desire is a is a painful emotion &gt;&gt; that a person has within them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This desire uh uh uh whatsoever you desire this desire is uh is something that comes from uh from the inside of the inside. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read a little bit. My mind is trying to carry me into something, but the spirit of the prophet is subject unto the prophet. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever thingsoever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive it &gt;&gt; and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Have faith in God and whatsoever thing you desire when you pray, believe that you will have them." &gt;&gt; But then he brings us the principle. And when you stand praying, &gt;&gt; forgive &gt;&gt; if ye have ought against any. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham in the statue of the perfect man will now tell us that the foundation of this param or the foundation of faith is forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now remember that Peter never said he never said add on to forgiveness faith. &gt;&gt; He never said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Add onto your faith virtue." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are not adding faith unto anything. Just like I said, because faith is a gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He that cometh unto God must what? First believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It must that it must be it must be released from you &gt;&gt; to believe that God exists and God is real. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you see all of these things is not a mind work. It is something that works within us. Just like I said Richard saying he will add onto me another son. Jacob is not going to bomb uh bar Benjamin from the store. He's not going to take Benjamin from the nations around. Benjamin is coming to come out of her womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That other son that will be added onto her is coming from in her. &gt;&gt; That is the same where all of these virtue are going to come out of the believer. But you see like brother Brandham said the foundation of faith is forgiveness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is very powerful. And that's where we want to stand tonight just for this uh exaltation because you realize here is that Jesus said, "And when you when you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so we see here that uh uh uh uh think about this. Think about this. I was uh I was talking about this uh uh uh in one of my my uh uh services and I was talking about which of course we spoke about it here before talking about God coming to reconcile Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling Adam, Adam, where are you? Just for the fact that Adam has left his position. Amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to call him. He had left his position. And that position that Adam has left was not a geographical position in the garden. &gt;&gt; The position that Adam left, he fell. from approaching God from his soul &gt;&gt; to now his flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's he fell from the consciousness. &gt;&gt; The consciousness of where he knew that God has given him power and authority. He could speak and the mountain could move. He fell from that place. Yes, &gt;&gt; that is his position where he fell from. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As we talk about position, I think about this a little bit because you know uh uh we are we are fond of saying the woman position is in the kitchen. There was no kitchen in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam and Eve was not cooking. Praise the Lord. So you see the position was not a a a geographical position. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Her position when God placed her, she was placed to be a helpmate. &gt;&gt; And I was just looking at that word this morning in my in my devotion as I was as I was meditating. And that word is uh uh uh uh is is the same word that word helpmate is the same word that David used when he said my help cometh from the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew is called a it's eer. Praise the Lord. So you see it was it is not uh you know a a position a setting place in the garden of Eden but it was something that she was called onto. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the same thing with Adam. When Adam fell from his position his position was not that he was standing on a mountain. He was supposed to be on a mountain or he was supposed to be down in a valley. But his position was uh at the time he was approaching God with a consciousness from his soul. &gt;&gt; Where he did not even he he didn't have conscious that the beast around him could harm him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't have consciousness that he never had consciousness of evil. that were just how much he was so h connected to God and how much he was worshiping God and serving God from his soul. &gt;&gt; Now, so see what is going to happen here. He fell from there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if God will bring him back to that place, he had to forgive him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God will bring him back to that place, if God will bring him back to the place of fellowship, &gt;&gt; he had to forgive him. So God provided a bleeding line. I'm trying to make a picture of why forgiveness is the foundation of faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because faith is not a mind game. Faith is a sense of your soul. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that sense of the soul where we fell from. And if God will bring men back into fellowship, he had to bring men back by the way of forgiveness, providing a a a sacrifice or an atonement to be able to bring man back. So you see with God, you are back. &gt;&gt; The problem now is you. Do you forgive yourself to be back? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To God, he has he has already made made a sacrifice provided. He has already made a way of forgiving us. He went on the cross. He said, "It is finished. I have paid the price." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I mean he's uh he's uh he's he's he's coming close. He's bringing himself close to us and and and and trying to bring us in his presence. So with God, he has already done his part. He has forgiven us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has forgiven us. Now it is now with with with man to be able to come back to that place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To come back to the place of the six sense to come back to live in the the the the sense of faith. Now you see uh I mean we we have to work and we have to do everything. Uh uh but you realize that uh uh uh you know we we we we are doing all of these things just to create some sense of security for ourself. But in the actual sense God is our provider. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the actual sense he is our provider. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even with all our working and everything we are doing, he's the one providing for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one blessing us with strength. He's the one blessing us with uh with with abilities and jobs and everything. He is our provider. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But think about it at a place of word right there from the beginning you know uh uh uh Adam was not he was not he was not hustling to make it work. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was just living out of it is it is just that place of uh that that the the full consciousness of God that we are coming to. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we are coming to the full consciousness of God. So I'm I'm trying to bring where forgiveness becomes the foundation because here is it now that uh God has reconciled us back to himself because he have paid the price and he has done uh everything that he is supposed to do and yet in our self we still struggle with guilt. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are still reminded and all of the guilt that we still struggle with create doubt in our mind whether we can stand and ask the mountain to be moved and it will move. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not that the power is not there for you to do it but what is happening here is that we are too much in our mind and we are not in our heart. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are too much in our mind. We are too much in the realm of memory and and reasoning and uh and affection. I feel good. I don't feel good. You know, I really don't feel up to the tax. We are so much in that realm of our spirit in our mind. Praise the Lord. So you see the thing the thing that makes faith to come up to its potential is forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh most of the time you know we we just think about as soon you talk about forgiveness your mind run on another person. But even think about your very self. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about your very self when the word says you have not done it in the first place. Do you really believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you are still captured. You are still struggling in in your mind with with condemnation and fear and doubt because as soon as condemnation set in that's the thing it produce fear and doubt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It produce fear and doubt. And most of the time that that is the realm that we we we live in. We are afraid. We don't you know want people to talk bad about us. We are afraid you know uh we we I mean we really don't know what tomorrow will brings. Uh you know and and and all of that. So it's just in that rain now. So see how faith how the sea of faith comes to life is when we have been able to accept what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When we have been able to fully accept what he has done for us. when we can be able to drop down from that realm of uh being haunted by our past. Praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; we can be able to to to get out of that realm of guilt like Paul says uh uh uh uh you know uh uh therefore there is no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. It is truth. But the reality there is that have we grown &gt;&gt; to really be able to behave that there is no condemnation? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're talking about growth tonight. Have we grown to that place &gt;&gt; to be able to behave that there is no condemnation? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see one uh one group of people taken to the place there is no condemnation so they can just keep doing wrong. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You just making a disgrace to yourself &gt;&gt; because that's not the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see that's that is the sense of growth that I'm talking about because we will never be able to to to fully express faith to really be able to express faith like like like that young man. Praise the Lord. They says, "Oh, he he he's a devil. He's a sinner. the man I open your eyes and and and and and and this boy never he never grew up with Jesus. He never knew Jesus. He don't know where he came from. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But let me let me let me share this with you. Do you realize that uh if if those Pharisees could could tarnish the repetition of Jesus Christ to that boy, they could easily make him to believe that he's still blind. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If they could if if they could just just make make uh h Jesus. So, for the matter of fact, it's even the Sabbath day. Don't you know the Sabbath day &gt;&gt; that he not? Can Can you see it? How demonic this man is? How even the Sabbath is a dishonor to the Sabbath day. So, how can you believe that God is in this? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you see how they could have trouble his mind and then he will go back for his uh his blind stick? Let me use this thing here. I hope I don't spot it. He'll go back for his blind stick. His eyes is open. But they have told him that man is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll go, he will still hold his blind stick and close his eyes. Oh my God. He dishonor the Sabbath. Jehovah is not happy. He's going back. And many of the time that's the thing we do. &gt;&gt; He is of age. When you become of age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you become of age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you become of age, &gt;&gt; then you realize that &gt;&gt; sometimes you are the one that is writing the story. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you become of age, you realize that this is my day. &gt;&gt; This is my opportunity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As much as I can say, I don't care what anybody said. I will say loud. I don't care what the devil said to me in my head. I know that by God's grace, he has opened my eyes to see the message of the hour. I believe the messenger of my day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the promise of my day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's faith &gt;&gt; of age. A man that is of age &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said they were trying to discredit him. They were trying to just blackmail him. But the danger of blackmailing him was enough to send this man back blind. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you have to you have to see this. Now, Brother Brandham says when uh when when when the Lord heals you, &gt;&gt; it is faith that makes you to walk in your healing. &gt;&gt; When you start to doubt it, you can you can backslide and go right back to your sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. So see if they will have tried to convince this man for him to doubt the man. &gt;&gt; So so it more like they enjoy him being blind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They enjoy him being blind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is just an exesation to now lead. &gt;&gt; Good. But there's a there's a there's a there's a there's a little conversation I heard one time. I heard this conversation that uh one time the pope was with some of his cabinets and they were looking at uh uh how much uh you know they were just they were just talking about uh you know how much how the how their organization how the church has traveled and with the wealth that the church has accumulated And the pope said to the cabinet, "We can no longer say we can no longer say savor and go. We have none." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I mean, we have got so much wealth that it would not be fair for us to say savor and go. We have none. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the cardinal said to the pope, we can also now say rise up and walk. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture did not only end on silver and gold, we have none. &gt;&gt; So if the church cannot say silver and gold, we have none. The church will not be able to say rise up and walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What's the principle there? Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the fact that uh uh uh they were trying to introduce a lot of things just to be able to destroy this man repetition, just to be able to make him ugly. And in that sense, I mean there's there is there is none of his work that we can believe. Well, coming to the place where they could not convince him that this man is a sinner, he's a devil. They say, "Okay, just take him from out of the picture and give praise to God." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's of age. I believe the bride is of age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that this bride is of age. &gt;&gt; She's been walking with this word now. &gt;&gt; For some years, she's of age. And brother Brandon says the the mind of Christ is given to her so she can know what to do with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is more of what God is expecting us to do in giving situation than what we are expecting God to do &gt;&gt; because he has given us the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I come back to this again. Brother Brandham says the power is lying dominant in the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The power that creative power &gt;&gt; to say is uh let the mountain be is it's here. It's in you. The thing that is holding it back, unforgiveness. Praise the Lord. Because it all goes back to doubt and fear that we stay haunted in our mind that uh uh uh uh we could backslide. Are you still haunted in your mind that uh I mean uh that you could leave the message, you could stop serving God? Are you at that place? Are you still haunted with some questions in your mind? Are there are there questions that are tempering with your faith? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because forgiveness is the bedrock is the foundation of faith. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when faith comes to it's just like that seed when that seed has burst out of the shed and starts to spring out the sky is it limit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it will add onto itself leaves. It add onto itself branches. It add onto itself fruits. It is the same thing that Paul I mean Peter is saying. Add onto your faith. Add unto virtue. Knowledge. Add unto knowledge. Temperance. It all comes from the seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not something you have to practice. It comes from where your faith it solidly based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your faith is not is not like he said in in in uh uh Ephesians, we are not tossed about with every wings &gt;&gt; every little thing that come around. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have a solid faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are things that will happen and when and and and whenever these things happen you know uh uh we have been taught we are at a place to realize that uh nothing will happen to us until God allow it &gt;&gt; and when anything happen praise God he allowing it's another opportunity for a testimony it's another opportunity for God to show himself &gt;&gt; it's not well to the place I will say why me Lord why why all of these years I've been serving you why why Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you see the out of the why question goes back to a place of doubt and guilt. That's the reason why many times when we are dealing things dealing with things in our life, we start to go back and start digging. Is there something that I did that God did not forgive me for? Why? Because there is still an element of guilt &gt;&gt; that keeps haunting us. &gt;&gt; Why all of these things happening to me? Is there something that I've done, man? We must come up to age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must come up to age. I I mean it is it it it it don't look real to you but you see religious pressure if the council the the the Sahedrin's council could pressure that man h that young man and and and and just give him every court that is in the book and everything to prove to him that he was not blind. If there was not an inner experience, if there was not something that has captured his his his heart, if there was not something that was real to him that he know that now he can tell the difference between colors. I might not be able to explain it, but I'm seeing things better than I used to see it before. I'm understanding things better than I used to understand it before. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, recently I was I was uh reading the story of a Jewish girl and her brother that became Christians. and they were talking to this uh Christian family and uh and the lady took uh the the the New Testament and started to they took the the the Torah and started to show comparison the fulfillment of the of the of the Old Testament in the New Testament. You know, this Christian family &gt;&gt; and uh the the the young lady says they could see the reality but the fear because of all that they were taught of Judaism. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh uh her brother got safe and he uh he was out. The parents found out that he got saved. He came back home. He, you know, he uh first prayers did not find out. It was his sister that found out, you know, and u uh he decided that he would not go to see the woman again. You know, he don't want to see her again. He don't want to talk anything. You know, he got rid of his Bible and everything. And then he was to his house trying to practice Judaism. Amen. So, so what so what is happening there is that the light that he have seen, he's closing his eyes. He's making every effort not to see &gt;&gt; Jesus as the one that fulfilled Isaiah 53. &gt;&gt; He's closing. He's doing everything. But you see the thing about it is that when your eyes comes open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you did not open it, you can't close it. &gt;&gt; The principle of he that open it and no man close it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You did not open it. You can't close it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He tried everything. Everything. &gt;&gt; So one day the his sister asked him, you know, believing that her brother has come back to Judaism, asking for them to go and they say, "Okay, when we go, we must not talk anything about the Bible, not anything in this." But you see, it's a work that is done in &gt;&gt; the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the most miserable feeling &gt;&gt; after God has dealt with our hearts, &gt;&gt; after God has revealed truth to us and you don't want to see it. You want to unsee what you have seen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's of age. &gt;&gt; Let him speak for himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you are of age tonight, you must speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need me to confirm that you have the Holy Ghost. You must know what God is doing in your life &gt;&gt; and stand and speak for yourself. Speak to that devil. Speak to your mind battles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must speak for yourself if you are of age. If you can't speak for yourself and I mean you you you just you want us to to pick you up, we will do it. We will just want to understand that you have not grown yet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You might get a little bit over with for us. But I mean we we will be able to carry you the best that we can. But what we understand is that you have not grown yet. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; If you are of age, you must speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; Speak to your situations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must speak for yourself &gt;&gt; because just like how the Pharisees was trying to destroy the evidence but the man himself was the evidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; What has happened happened in his own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the reason why we cannot look at what is happening far. You look at what is God doing in your life. &gt;&gt; Now what happened yesterday? What happened today? &gt;&gt; What is happening now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he doing right now in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is your experience with God? &gt;&gt; Don't make the past your history. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or else I mean don't make the past your hero or else your hero will be dead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe we are of age. &gt;&gt; We can speak for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ask me what God is doing here. I will tell you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I believe it &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; Ask me what God is doing in my home. I will tell you. &gt;&gt; Because I'm part of that house. &gt;&gt; I believe what he's doing there. &gt;&gt; Ask me what he's doing in my life, I will tell you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm of age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's no time to be toast about &gt;&gt; with they say this and they say that and the other person say this and the other person say that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, that the young Jewish boy and guilt end up believing the Lord Jesus. They were rejected by their parents and that young girl had to suffer a lot of lot of trouble in her walk with God just because they have believed the Christian faith. But the the the the thing of the story there is that you cannot unseen you know you cannot unsee what God has shown you what he have opened your eyes to. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. And I want to see you. Oh, open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. to see you high and lifted up. Shining in the light of your glory. Pour out your power and love as we sing. Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. Let's stand on our feet tonight. Yes. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. Oh, open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. And I want to see you. to see you hide and lift all shining in the light of your glory. Who are your coward and Lord as we sing holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. Let's sing that one more time. Lord, open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. Oh, open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. To see you high and lifted up. Shine me in the light of your glory. Pour out your power and love as we sing holy, holy, holy, [Music] holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. Fed is a free gift. God has given it to you. It's a seed that comes with your birth. [Music] It's a seed that comes with your birth. The thing that is stopping us from uh operating in faith, walking in faith, living in faith, speaking in faith. Sometimes it's a sense of condemnation, [Music] things that we allow in our life that we shooting. [Music] A sense of fear, a sense of doubt. [Music] But faith is there. It will it will handle you from operating. It will handle you from walking in faith. It will handle you for faith to be as fully expressed in you because you are allowing something that is contrary to the word. [Music] When your faith come up to be a mature faith, a faith that has that has stand the storm, a faith that can stand alone with God, a faith that can believe God for the impossible. [Music] &gt;&gt; Then that faith will give birth to virtue. God will add onto your faith virtue and people will be strengthened from your life. Virtue came out of him. The Bible said people were healed in the shadows of Peter because his faith was a mature faith. Then virtue will give will give birth to knowledge and God will add knowledge to your virtue. [Music] You we will have some sense of spiritual discernment. We will not just be we will not have kind of judgment. Lot of our judgment are kind of judgment because they said this, because they look at me like this, because I I It's just kind of judgment. It's not discernment. It's not knowledge at all. You cannot base it on the word. But it goes back to that place of fear. It goes back to that place of guilt. It goes back to that place of condemnation. It go back to that place of unforgiving. [Music] If you if we experience if we have really come into the atmosphere of God's forgiveness, if we have break away from our fear, if you if we if you experience that, I mean there is nothing nothing you can hold against any mortar. Nothing you can hold against any mortar. [Music] Heavenly Father, that man was born blind. We were born in sin and shipless in iniquity. Our condition, Lord, Father, is even worse than his Lord. But Father, that's a that's a that just a biblical description of us born is sin shiply in iniquity. Father God, come to the word speaking lies. And yet the message of the hour of the word of God, Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ came our way. This is not a church thing. It's not a religious thing. It's a personal experience. He met this man. He took him by the hands just like he took you by the hands and brought us into a personal experience. He took a clay the man couldn't see it but the man could feel it. He said he took a clay and he rub it upon my eyes. [Music] All of these people, they had testimony and they know that this boy was born blind. They know that this is he. This is he. Is he really the one? They had to call the parents. Do you have another son? Is it really the one that was born blind? Can you see how blind those Pharisees were? [Music] Sometimes uh we just we just let's let's not hide behind this message. This message is the light of God. It's it's is it's the light of God to open our eyes. [Music] He want us to grow in the things that we have seen, in the things that we have heard. Heavenly Father, we stand tonight. Oh God, we stand tonight. Jesus, precious Lord, this hour is upon us. This is our day. This is our time, oh God. Are we going to be suaded away by people testimony or what people says about a brother or what people says about this church or what they think about the message or what they said about are we going to be sued you are of age be able to speak for myself. When we were children, we talked like children. We struggle with peer pressure. We run after one another. But Paul says when we are full grown, we speak for ourself. We speak for ourself. We speak faith in love. [Music] Father, help us tonight, Lord God, that we can be able to speak to our storm. We can be able to speak love, Father, to to the wings of doubts that the enemy, Father, is trying to to throw on our mind and want us to accept whatever condition you said. Whatsoever we desire in our hearts, oh God, whatsoever we have heard in our hearts, Lord, whatsoever we have been believing for you, oh God, you said, whatever we desire in our heart and we ask it, oh God, [Music] Father, we thank you tonight. We thank you, precious Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father God. [Music] And your grace, Lord Jesus, has dealt with us. You have heard our hands. You have brought us this far, oh God. Shedra, Mishad and Abednego they were of age. They said king even if God do not deliver us we are not going to deny him. Daniel were of old age. He didn't care what the king's commandment was as long as it were contrary to the word of God. He lift up his hands in prayer three times a day. Father, try to bring that solidness to our faith. Oh God, try to bring, oh God, Father, pull us, Lord, to that place, Lord. Pull us to that place. There's no time, oh God, Father, for comparison, comparing, oh God, Father, Lord Jesus, who is here, who is not here. As long as I know that Jesus is here. As long as I know he promised to meet us, oh God. Oh father, give me grace. Give me strength, Lord Jesus. Let me be able to show up with you. Let me stand. Oh God, let me take sides with your word. Oh God, let me take sides with you, Father. Lord God, bring us to full age, Lord. Bring us to maturity, oh God. Father, that you promise you will never leave us. You will never forsake us. No matter what is going around our life, we have to believe that you are in control. Father God, we are not going back. Lord God, Father, if if if I confess that sin, I sincerely confess it. I place it under the blood. You don't have to be visiting the other time. Oh God, forgive me. He said, because of this that I've done, he's not an Indian giver. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, I'll have your way. Oh yes, Lord, I give you my heart. I gave you my soul. Lay for you. For you alone, every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, [Music] your heart has your way. Oh Jesus, Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you. For you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I will win. your heart, your way. Father, pray tonight. Oh God, Lord Jesus, just like Paul says, you're bringing us to a perfect man. You're bringing us to a measure in Christ. A measure, Father. Lord, you are taking us, oh God. Father, we're right into the holiest of holy. We have gone past the altar cord. We have gone past the inner call, the church ages. We arrived in the presence of the glory of the Lord. So God, we pray, Father, this evening. Help us, Lord. Help us, oh Father God, we are living in a time, Lord, where we must be able to speak to our storm. Father God, we must be able to tell that devil, you get her from here. [Music] We must not be living under condemnation. If we are doing things that we must not do, Father give us grace. Bring convict our hearts Lord. Convict our heart Lord Jesus to get away from it because there is no way we will grow in faith this way. There is no way we will grow in faith. [Music] We love you tonight. We appreciate you.
