next weekend as well so just commit us in the hands of the lord that god will be able to to help us praise the lord and uh [Music] tonight uh we will get back to our subject we've been speaking on but i was thinking to to uh look into something there i prayed uh the lord would make it a blessing so uh we will read in john chapter five now you have to remember that we've been talking on the harmony the harmony with the father and the son or harmony between the father and the son whichever way we've been we've been saying it it's just something like that we've been trying to say praise the lord you know it's one of those things trying to say something and highly get to see it right amen and you just you just have a thought right there in your head so uh but uh when when uh [Music] brother branham referred to that uh which of course is being our uh primary quote we've been reading through this subject from the pagaramus church age he says notice the harmony of the father and the son the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father saint john 5. so he was referring to saint john 5 19. now i want for us to go back and and read in john 5 uh reading reading from verse 1. praise the lord saint john 5 let's uh read from verse 1. praise the lord amen saint john chapter 5 after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem now jerusalem what uh now there is at jerusalem by the ship market a pool which is called in the hebrew town they'll test there having five pouches in this late a great multitude of important folks of blind hearth weather waiting for the moving off the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water step in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmities thirty and eight years when jesus saw him lay and knew that he had been now a long time in this case he said unto him will thou be made hold the important man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but why i am coming another step down before me jesus said unto him rise take up that bed and walk and immediately praise the lord amen and immediately the man was made hold and took up his bed and walk praise the lord what a sight to see the man what a sight to see that in an immediate healing and immediate moving of god and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the lord bless you you may have your seat because you continue to read maybe that's what we might just do tonight just read read the bible pray and go home praise the lord amen that's god's word that's that's what uh that's the most important word here tonight verse 10 and the jews therefore said unto him that was killed it it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry their bed amen he answered them he that made me hold the same said unto me and take up that bed and walk then you know what the jews were talking about they were they were trying to tell the man you know this is church order trying to say this is church order you know don't break the church order now praise the lord i'm just i'm just saying it that way because i want to grab your attention on something tonight and he answered he that made me hold the the same said unto me and take up the bed and walk then ask the him what man is that we said unto thee take up that bed and walk and he that was healed with that who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in the place afterward jesus foundeth him in the temple and said and said unto him behold thou are made whole saint no more lest a worse thing come unto them the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which have made him whole praise the lord well he said it in bad faith oh he said it in good faith i believe he said it in good faith amen because they wanted to know who gave him that instruction let's read a little bit and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he have done these things on the sabbath day not because he have healed the man praise the lord amen but because he has he has breaking the the church order all he you know uh he has breaking what to them is the lord hallelujah then jesus answered them my father worketh heaven in our work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only have broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i said unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he serious the father do for what things so ever he does this also does the son likewise may the law our blessing on the reading of the word praise the lord amen now i made a a a comment a phrase on sunday and uh and that's what i was i was actually thinking on speaking tonight on on rachel and her father's idol praise the lord on rachel and her father's idol now that's over in genesis 31 uh jacob was about to to leave the house of his father-in-law and uh and the scripture says uh richard took her father idol and she hated and jacob never knew anything about it praise the lord now as we read this scripture tonight what i want to to grab your attention on this wednesday night is for us to realize how uh when we when you just look at the the the the scripture there the story about rachel and think about it this way uh uh they are about to have an exeter amen god has been dealing with jacob uh all through the night to return back to his father house to return back to that mountain where god met him praise the lord and year he said he's about to leave he's about to leave his denomination praise the lord he's about to leave his denomination and and then [Music] rachel the church a type of the church is now going to take uh you know an idol she's going to take something of the old beliefs system praise the lord amen she's going to take something of the old belief system now what i want to write on tonight is that uh it has always been whenever man is is moving on you will see that all true history uh whenever man god called abraham you know to a land who maker and bitter was god when he was coming he brought his his his father brought his his nephew lord and all of that so it is it is always with us amen it is always with us when god calls us when he calls when we hear the voice of god and we give in to the call if we did not bring with us a religious idol we would bring some family idol praise the lord or we would bring our own self idol some kind of a sticky nature of ourself we will we will we will come to the court of god praise the lord now so you will realize that uh uh it has always been like that it has always been like that i'm i'm caught up in between the thought here but i pray that the lord will will be able to to to help us as we as we will study tonight and uh and and as we as we go along serving the law we realize that uh you know uh it has always happened in every revival i was just i was just listening to something standing a little bit this uh uh sometime today and and uh uh even when when luther came out when he when he got the revelation you know that the josh shall live by faith you have to remember now he was a catholic priest amen and uh uh this this scripture this uh scripture in the bible came to life praise the lord he saw it it is not it is it is not by works it is not you know dragging on the ground and cutting yourself and whipping yourself and and trying to self-please god he saw it it just came to life that is it is the just the just shall live by faith is what christ have done amen having faith in the finished work of jesus christ praise the lord that's what he saw but you you you will see it also that even though even though uh uh during that revival you know uh people started uh uh rejoicing in the word you know this there they started uh uh now having access to the bible when they never who have asked us to to read the bible you know and all of that but there was a system that was already on the ground catholicism was ruling the word at that time praise the lord now they are seeing a a work of god they are seeing a work of grace and uh but yet there is there was there was some sense of fear for the people to completely move into what god was doing praise the lord those that that that move into a zwingling and the rest of them you know the broad uh are legalizing and and you know in a way to control the people praise the lord amen that's the reason why brother branham says uh uh luther greatest miracle that he had in his revival was to keep his head above all the foundation and all the fanaticism that was happening around him people were still sticking to the uh uh catholic worship people were were running ahead and becoming fanatics you know people were you know now now you know uh uh uh condemning the the old system in a very rude way you know and all of those things were happening praise the lord but the messenger was keeping himself right in the middle he was doing his best to stay with with what with the way that god was dealing with him are we together praise the lord now watch this also and uh uh i mean capitalism was ruling europe at the time but after uh a luther revival broadband make us to know that that that that wane of revival started going now and it's leaving germany now is going down to england okay and what happened was the the the how we were calling now the cardinal you know uh uh uh the cardinal the bishop dead of england of the church of england has come to a conviction that he must get away from uh uh uh being single and and and married and the catholic church will not change that doctrine watch now praise the lord because uh luther have already started a revival for the people to go back to the word okay so now they are reading the word and now he he has come to a conviction that no this thing is not a calling to the word i have a right to get married the church said no you won't this is our daughter and you will not get married praise the lord so what happened because now he was the cabinet he was the the bishop over england he decided to cut the church that he was bishop over all the people of england away from the catholic system so there the church of england gave birth to death praise the lord so the cop they cut away now from uh from from catholicism only with the sense that now the priests no more can live under that dogma of catholicism amen now the the priests honor this new church system the church of england now can get married for their king our agglican church and all of that praise the lord amen now wash now what i want you to see is this even though they got that understanding but the church still kept the adult richer still kept the idol of her father praise the lord amen until when the truth revival came of sanctification through john wesley the african church could not embrace it are you grabbing the picture even though now they are saying that we we are no longer uh a catholic church this is the church of england and we we're going to we we are going back to the bible like every one of them says let's go back to the bible amen but yet when when the revival what god wanted to do that he stirred the water the real move of god was not just to bring the people out of catholicism but to cleanse them and take them into a life of sanctification but when that real move started the church of england could not embrace it they rejected it i was uh and then as we learned brother branham says every revival comes almost at the end of the age amen at the end of the age entering into the new day the principle of creation the evening and the morning where the first day the evening and the morning was the second day so the light comes in the evening time praise the lord amen so when england rejected the revival then pretty soon all those evangelists that was seeing the importance of preaching sanctification started running to america nyani started having great revival meetings in america just to bring to birth azusa street which is the pentecostal revival are we together the the uh the tennessee now let's get to our strip tree a little bit here i could i can get in this thing and just keep going here and keep going and keep going we read here there's a place i want for us to get but the reason why i read this is to show us how they have kept the the ordinance of coming to this pool and waiting waiting for for for the angel to move upon the water amen and this man has been yeared you know about about 38 years what he's been there for 38 years or his sickness his was 38 years uh uh but he was he was you know always at this place hoping hoping that either somebody would feel sorry for him because i think he was pleading to jesus i don't have anybody to push me in the water if you really care for me stand by maybe when the water moves then you can push me praise the lord are we together but the same angel that was moving upon the water now was on two feet are we together now that's that's uh uh the place where god has always made provision for his people amen because divine healing has always been part of the covenant of god amen he has always made provision for his people it's it's it's always part of the atonement it's uh divine healing is part of the atonement so god has always made provision for his people during the time of moses he gave them the brazen serpent praise the lord and their instruction was to look at the serpent that's the only way they will be healed from the snake bite praise the lord now even at the time that plagued finish the the serpent the brazen serpent remain as a symbol of healing praise the lord so now when the people are sick or someone is a child is crying from a stomach ache or wake up with a headache because now something is in the camp that represents healing the first thing in the morning the first thing that mama will do is to run that boy up and say and say honey look no don't look at me look dean honey look look turn your eyes this way and look there amen because that was god's provision are you getting the hiding amen and the people you know uh now who looked to the brazen serpent and they kept it in the camp it was a sign of healing because they experienced healing praise the lord now what happened then pretty soon the people started making the the the brazen step and their their attention is now caught up to the brazen serpent that god is not even in their mind anymore as god the healer praise the lord they can they will disobey the commandments of god praise the lord they will disregard god's word but now they have embracing second that when they are sick they can go there and you know and play some religion praise the lord something that god raised up among them to testify that he is the one that healed their disease god raised it up among them praise the lord for them to acknowledge him it was just a matter a price that moses burned now grab this again he's the same lord god that commanded his children against grieving image amen he commanded them against grieving image to now worship no grieving image now so when god gave them the order to build embracing separately this is what i want you to watch now it was it was a symbol of his word it was pointing to the word praise the lord amen god god is an object of worship amen if that object do not have a base in the word is idolatry you you're grabbing the concept amen praise the lord if we will come and uh and and and uh uh uh and and and kneel down to the altar you know like brother branham says he says he says uh uh uh uh people you know he says uh you know uh uh he was correcting something that people think that i have problem against auto call see people ask questions he says brother brahm you say you say auto call is catalyzing he said no i believe in autocall but not just the form of the people just coming to the altar of the way that the catholic church make the altar to them praise the lord but people bringing their house to god so whether they come to the altar or they sit in their seat and they can be able to open their heart to god they will get the same result [Music] praise the lord amen so when the people uh uh uh will no longer approach god if your heart and mind is no longer after god and he had just go into that brazilian serpent because uh uh you know uh uh enter went there last week she got healed and and and and brother also his foot was broken they took him there he got healed now it is just all noun just the brazen altar is no longer almighty god that healeth our diseases so when it starts becoming an idol then god is no longer in it praise the lord then god is no longer in it praise the lord hallelujah let's read second king second kings second king chapter 18 let's read from verse one and it came to pass in the ten years of hosier son of eli king of israel that hezekiah the song of ahaz king of judah began to reign 25 years old he was when he began to reign and and he reigned 29 years in jerusalem his mother name also was ivy the daughter of zechariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did he remove the high places and break the images and cut down the growth he break in pieces the brazen serpent that moses has made for all for unto those days the children of israel did burn insane onto it praise the lord amen now they were not uh making sacrifices unto the lord anymore the brazen serpent has become their god praise the lord they could not go past the brazen serpent they could not see that god just used that as a symbol and all that he was speaking about as moses lifted up the brazen serpent so the son of man will be lifted up that's all he was speaking about praise the lord trying to trying to point them trying to give them a vision of what he would do but they couldn't see that far are we together praise the lord so this this brazen separate now has become a complete idol they are burning incense they are bringing food they are they are offering gifts and and and everything you know when and and people having a little bit of that in their house exactly the way it is they kiss it before they go to bed it has now become a god in the camp praise the lord now so we see hezekiah year he break the whole thing in pieces and the generation will go and gradually as a young people starts to grow up they're no longer saying the brazen serpent is growing away from their mind praise the lord they are some uh you know there are some there are some people that really had they really had a supernatural experience in that brazen serpent it's just hard to leave them and we have to go with them to the grave praise the lord because i was i was dying my i mean i i had cancer i was i was my body was rotting when it took me to that place i just lifted my eyes i wish you were alive to see it i wish you were alive it used to be right right on that mountain praise the lord but a god that is always mindful of his people year he gave them another provision and this time is the moving of the angel on the water praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why uh you know brother branham has has has always had a special place in his heart for medical science because just like how god provided a brazen serpent the brazen serpent was their clinic it was their medical center praise the lord amen it was their medical center yeah we raised in john chapter five there were a bunch of people lying just they were lying on on on the show before the porch and waiting for the angel to move it just like people at the hospital waiting for the doctor to come and call their names that was their clinic that's the reason why the prophet god said that's you know that's he says that is the thing that is the right thing a normal person would go to see your doctor because it's not the doctor that heals is god that heals but you see it's an institute that god has bless is god's provision he brought us here just like he took care of two million people in the wilderness praise the lord that's the same way that he has made this provision amen now so the the brazen serpent i mean the the the the uh uh the pool there the uh uh uh what's now the place where god was blessing the people saw the angel moving upon the water and someone got healed praise the lord and they have had experience they have had experience they have hard experience and and year by year then and people have got experience i mean until uh those that was welfare they paid people to stay right there and and and take care of the uh the the sick people praise the lord if you can throw him in the water and he be the first one i will raise your wages praise the lord so just like how you are working double there were people that were working double there were people that were also working overnight because maybe the angel could come overnight are we together now and they stay there and then you know and and you know and and here is it now the the very god that was also healing them on the basis of moses commandment look at the brazen serpent it was not the brazen serpent that was healing it was the commandment of god that was healing there was nothing in the brazen serpent to heal it was what god said look and live obedient to that that was what was giving them their healing praise the lord but you see there were people that went to the brazen serpent they were looking but they were still not getting healed praise the lord because they were doing it in in in worship of the brazen september not in obedience of god's word is the obedience to god's word that brings the result is the obedience to god's word that brings the healing it's not uh uh uh the pills that we take is not the touching of the doctor's hands is the obedience to god's word i'm the lord that healeth all they are diseases praise the lord and god because you say said in obedience to your word i would do that i wanted to share something with you now that i'm i'm in this i hope i see it here praise the lord hallelujah i was actually going to take it on on on something i wanted to talk about but what what actually it is is the other [Music] brother brandon was out hunting amen he was out hunting and then there was uh there was one of the brothers that were out hunting with him i actually took this because i wanted to i wanted to show you uh uh the same as we are talking about so he's hunting and then this brother this family have one of their boys you will get the story on tape that was suffering from epilepsy one of his trip dead in british columbia hunting with brother ed bisco and uh and when they told brother branham he said now this is it's a complete scriptural principle and i i will i really wanted to take it and just do it on there and show you something but now that is that it's on my on my mind let me just let me just share that with you and then maybe another time so uh he told them and said uh well uh the next time that the that this boy ever had the epilepsy take the shirt that he's wearing take the take his shirt off him and throw it in the fire now you have to realize that uh the scripture says from the body of the apostle we're taking aprons okay from the body of the apostles were taking aprons and they were they were laying on the sick and they were healed now so it's it's it's more of the place of where uh uh yeah i i never wanted to go into this but we are already in it so we'll just go amen praise the lord my mind is now wearing in different directions praise the lord now so you see it even even in the way that uh faction designers you know design clothes and uh sometimes they have setting uh a person in mind you know this close is you know is is like this person how they call them a lady gaga or whoever you want to call and uh but what it represents it represents the the spirit that is behind that amen praise the lord the spirit that is behind there now so uh uh uh we we know we deal with that when we were speaking on the message inspiration we know that uh the apostle paul uh uh took that when when the sheminar woman went to elijah praise the lord and elijah took his staff and gave it to geheza to go and lay it on the baby praise the lord now what does that represent is that uh because he's a prophet of god he's always in the presence of god he's always praying so it has to do with the atmosphere the atmosphere praise the lord amen so during the time of the revival all of those prayer clubs were kept in an atmosphere though the claws were cut into pieces they were kept in an atmosphere where the prophet of god would go and pray over them they were kept in a garlic atmosphere because it's not the cloth that brings the healing is god's promised word praise the lord are we together now so the same thing also with this sick child because when he when he gets vexed when when that when that spirit possesses him he gets this and whatever he's doing now that spirit that is that is now tormenting the body is is also it's in the atmosphere praise the lord it's in the atmosphere so brahms says the next time it happened take his shirt off him and just throw in the fire said i do this that's what he said say i do this in the name of the lord jesus christ what is that bringing it back to the word because it's the word that brings the result if you are not doing it in the name of the lord jesus christ then you are doing another other worship right are you grabbing the picture are you grabbing the sense of what it is amen most of the time the same thing uh adores in medical science that's the reason why when the patient leaves the bed the first thing they want you to do to go and take all the sheets and go and wash it praise the lord amen if the same thing in hospitality when a person sleeps in the room they must go there and clean the room take the sheets off the bed and go and wash it how did i find myself here i don't know now so you see the the the but yeri said now jesus the same god that was healing them through the brazen serpent the same god that was moving upon the water has promised that a virgin shall conceive amen he has promised that i would tabernacle myself among men praise the lord and that same god has stepped among men and he's moving he's healing the sake praise the lord amen carrying on great healing revivals someone going to bury their dead and they pass through jesus wait and he stopped and look at the mother crying he said young man wake up praise the lord but this is the principle of richard staying hiding the idol of her father with all of that that was happening because the angel moving of the water has been the move of god or has been the way that god has been healing his people supernaturally even though they were all healing revival and people were talking about oh he opened the blind eye oh he did this and they were stuck to death praise the lord even when jesus told that man pick up your bed and walk the next day people came back to the pool praise the lord they came back to the pool waiting for the angel to move upon the water praise the lord so you see the uh uh uh that's that is the principle that i was trying to bring out of there now but that's the scriptures in john 5 19 that that we've been kind of for dealing on here with the harmony of the father and the son so but jesus now is now saying you know he tell the man pick up your bed and walk and the bible says immediately a man that was bound down with uh with with uh whatever demons that were holding the bible said immediately he took his bed praise the lord now think about it why didn't the people rejoice while they're in all those pharisees and and suffer keeping people said this is the sabbath day god has healed somebody on the sabbath day oh praise god why didn't they rejoice they say hey you you know that today is the sabbath day why are you picking up your beard why are you picking your bear where are you going he says no him that told me i will be whole say i should pick up my bear who told you that well this is a man that could not barely stand up he couldn't walk right he couldn't live right praise the lord instead of rejoicing in his healing praise the lord they're asking all these technical questions because it's it's it's completely contrary to the way their church is set up completely contrary to their doctrine this is the sabbath day they're eating the healing of a man that was bound for 30 plus years never even rejoiced the people because they are bound in their creeds religious prison is the worst prison a man can be you see that's the reason why when the preaching of the world comes it comes to free us in our spirit because the most place we are in prison is inside praise the lord we might look free on the outside and try to put up a little smile and life with the neighbor praise the lord even that did not move the people yeah i seen who is this man the man made jesus go and see no more the worst will come upon you he went quickly out of excitement he went to meet him come and see it it's jesus sure he said okay now we find a person to persecute we find a man now to persecute call the council he's breaking the sabbath even on the sabbath day why couldn't they see that he was the lord of the sabbath amen why couldn't they see it and sometimes we build a a big expectation in our mind and we can see god in the simple things when we learn to start appreciating god dealing with the hearts of our young people picking up their bible to read or even saying the prayer praise the lord we want them to have the holy ghost and be on fire but they have to start from the birth they have to start from at birth we cannot be expecting a blast when there is not a birth praise the lord asking jesus and he said i do nothing except that wish my father have shown me praise the lord amen that's oh wow that now and now he's making himself god where is god that heals why couldn't they see it there is god that is able to free a man that's been bound for 38 years why couldn't they see it so you see every time every every time every move of god every move of god even though the church of england rejoice in the father they are not they are not catholic church anymore but yet they are left with the idol of catholicism praise the lord they are left with the ideal of capitalism glory be to god amen now so you will realize the other uh brother branham speaks about our birth our natural birth he says our natural birth came from the earth with eve and the serpent praise the lord amen and and most of the time it's like that when the person gives their heart to the lord we have uh that that affection with the the first ministry that impresses us the pastor that baptized us the one that preached the gospel and really explained the godhead that really convinced me to give my heart to the lord that first impression praise the lord amen the serpent had an impression on eve it goes with our falling nature i would say we are born just like rachel leaving her father house we leave the womb with our idol praise the lord that pride nature it came from the serpent in eve the lying tongue came from the seven and ever and rachel all through her journey we struggle with her idol sure because jacob don't know about it praise the lord amen check up on those about it oh that's the reason why you know when when we go and visit churches you know you sit there you listen to the music you you listen to the preacher and then your favorite preacher comes to your mind your pastor comes to your mind now he's not preaching like brother warren praise the lord that's the way our that's that's the way himalaya we are made that's the way humanly we are made but you see we have to destroy that idol we have to destroy that idol and and and and and and be and be attached to the world you see that's when brother branham says you know what i i mean if you don't believe the mayor respect his office it's on the basis of the word you are respecting the word you see that's what brings the blessing it's whatever we do in words or in these as much as we are doing it through the word we are doing it by the commandment of the word that's where the blessing is if it is not coming through the word then it's just becoming an idol praise the lord now you go back to genesis 31 the scripture says jacob called his wives and they were about to leave he says now we have to leave a father house and all of that rachel said in herself that what what what is my inheritance praise the lord that my father our father will not even give us anything of his inheritance praise the lord so then she goes and take her inheritance she take an idol for for her inheritance and she hated praise the lord a prophet of god will come and says uh there's a place that sat on harvard he says and that is that place that we should keep under the blood every one of us by our natural birth have that place amen some this is just it's just lying tongue yeah i mean they struggle with it just saying the truth is is just i mean they plan and everything and they don't even know how they tell lies they just run in their blood praise the lord some i mean i mean they don't see they just take things i just took it i never stole it i just took it i'm going to carry back anyway i'm going to carry back i just i just took it and they're talking to themselves nobody talking today i'm saying i never saw it i just i just took it [Music] praise the lord and i mean we can go in different ways i'm just i'm just kind of for painting that tonight so you can you can be able to drive but i mean you can get right in there and see which idol you came with amen you see which idol you came with praise the lord and do you realize that even richer in the hour of death giving birth to her son she still had to fight the struggle with her idol that's the battle you have that's what the holy ghost is giving for to empower you to destroy that idol because it's in your bloodstream you don't come to the message and it's just gone praise the lord that's what i want to come to tonight before we close here it's just good when god brings things out amen kind of a struggling to bring this to you tonight but uh thank the lord brahma says here in the message presuming i was i was just reading uh listening to to the tape a couple of them he says this he says he says now i'm going to teach on the subject of presuming it's just presuming and webster says to presume is to venture without actual authority now you have to know that we don't have no other authority if it is not based on the world so anything that you are doing that is not based on god's word you are venturing god is not going to back you up are we together venture without actual authority or to take it for granted now that was the that was the thing that hit me because that exactly what we do we take these things for granted praise the lord rachel say after all is my father's idol and she's and she's sitting right there sitting on the idol the bible says she sat right on it and told her father you know you know that it is this time of the year for me as a woman she's sitting right there and jacob is saying search for it the person you find her with let the person die and she's sitting right there why she didn't speak she never spoke up because she took it for granted praise the lord and uh that's that's the thing that kind of forget with my heart just just in couple of days here while we were away and i was just oh my god i was just thinking oh where have we come to sure where have we come to we have we have we have we have taken things for granted until i mean the world has creeped in not only creeping but it have it's it's swollen us up swallowing the church up until those things that used to matter no longer matter to people and this message brother brad i'm crying to the church and saying he said well i mean where's your prayer life he says you have taken fasting out of the church what's the all-night prayer meeting and he just crying to the church and you know just just just rebuking the people but we have taken things for granted until we have placed ourselves in social condition that we enjoy the story of the supernatural just when it is still and there is nothing in us wanting to experience the supernatural praise the lord he says that's why the word presumed means go without authority or just taking it for granted and that's how these people also fall into idolatry because they took it for granted until the mist they missed the spiritual application they missed the real reason why god raised up a brazen serpent why god troubled the water praise the lord we'll stay on that talk tonight and see if the lord will bless it as we prepare our house to pray i mean that guard will be doing something a divine healing heal the man and it will not grab the attention of the people praise the lord amen that it will not grab the attention of the people that this must be god and i'll say it for for disassembling to see that we still have our doors open praise the lord amen and the wednesday night service it used to be a tape service for just two three persons we can come together tonight praise the lord let's not take this for granted praise the lord it has to be god that is moving right here on sister 900 it's not a man it's god because i believe that tears and prayers have gone into this place but what happens when god starts to move and bless the people then they take it for granted they come to church if you want to sure they don't yeah i mean they don't care praise the lord i mean the age is going in in in such a way i was just thinking about it this morning as as i was meditating and just it was just kind of a blasting on my mind and saying uh you know uh one of the biggest biggest money-making thing in our age is advertisement this age is an age of advertisement that's one of the biggest thing that is making money that's what has made zach a millionaire because he built a platform called facebook and it's all advertisements he get a bunch of people working for him that he's not paying the damn and all the money going in his pocket on a few that really knows uh how to get their money is getting out of him but that's that's the age that we are living it is the time it's the season praise the lord i mean if you if you if you if you get a product you get a little product like this a bottle of anointing or you really want to sell you better get a site to put it on and if you can get aside and just get everything set up you can get people buying it from india they can buy it from everywhere that's that's the world that we are living in that's the global village praise the lord but we have to also realize that the devil make use of every move of every opportunity that has ever come to the world when it was an industrial age he make use of it praise the lord he used there to break a a family he used that to break morris because we may have to get out to work so because it was an industrial aid they have to they have to dress like the dress code for the job right they took it for granted and now when you see the dress on the woman you say to yourself she's a sister he said wow that's a sister there why because they took it for granted brother branham says that was the place of the ephesian church age that least got that moment on god at moment he said praise the lord now remember as i close tonight rachel she was the beloved wife of jacob the one that jacob loved praise the lord she was the mother of joseph a type of christ she was the mother of benjamin the one that times the 144 thousand at the love of the father she is the type of the church right from the time that god called our father abraham he came out of mesopotamia from the land of babylon praise the lord idolatry has always run in parallel praise the lord that's why let's let's not take things for granted when things are coming up deal with them when you know that it's not the word praise the lord don't take it for granted deal with it ask god for grace paul there with that in in the church there in kalusha where he was dealing with those people that had so much pride on them until they were involved in self-worship you know sometimes you you uh you see a lot of things they kind of inspire you you know to to to speak on things and uh you know sometimes people think the other uh uh you know you trying to talk to a particular person in church no i'm just i'm just dealing with a spirit amen because that's what i see creeping creeping around the people i mean i was out on this on this trip i was back home oh man i couldn't sleep because my heart was just torn i said oh my god how did we get here praise the lord when grace found us we reign in the dust we praise god i mean uh uh uh uh you you tell the brother something and and and it was not the right thing that you you want to make sure that you say it right to him i mean i walk right to that same place i look at things that were happening and i said oh god how did we got here how did these people got here taking things for granted you are venturing without authority you are letting down your protection praise the lord churches go in 10 20 years provide a convenience service church church of the living god that represent the body of jesus christ and all that matters to the people is to have a huffman picture on one side and brought a random picture on the other side we are in the message we are going to the rapture praise the lord amen i don't force against none of those things but if we have all of those things there and we don't have the word we have just built another grieving image for ourself if we will not come back to the world we will not have the effect of the word in our homes and the effect of the word in our life if the world will no longer break our conscience the people would do things claiming the holy ghost when when when when the early church was a church of shamefistness this last this church is a bold-faced church she have she have both face she can tell lie bowling without a bling of an eye she can come right from out there out of worshiping her idols right out of the house of adultery and come and take god's word when early christians gave their life blood for this word let's not take change for granted who come and the spirit of god will move in our midst don't take it for granted and god will be speaking to your heart don't take it for granted you better take that thing back to the lord in prayer and say god if this thing is becoming an idol in my life use the word and destroy it it was a stone that was caught out of the mountain without hand that was what broke that image of babylon down and it would take the stone the revealed word of the hour god's word to break every form of idol in our lives people come with their denomination or idol that it's it's just a mindset the same way those people are stuck to worshipping uh the brazen altar praise the lord they are just you just they are just stuck in that mindset right and if you don't do it that way no to them no i can be part of it the body of jesus christ is a mystical body praise the lord i have the holy ghost if i go to a spanish church i might not yell one word of spanish praise the lord and i stay right there when they are sinking i must be able to lift my hand and worship my god am i going to require you have to get an english interpreter down there for me to really watch it praise the lord we got to get our musicians together and i really really never felt it what you wanted to feel just emotion that's all you wanted to feel it's the spirit of god in your heart you will feel it all the time if you are prayed up and you come to church you will feed the spirit of god all the time if you are prayed up and your heart is in the right place your expectation is for god to speak to you you will hear from god you will now wait for your favorite music to be sunk or your favorite preacher to preach you will hear from god all the time yes sir rachel give birth she had a gift of the spirit she stayed high her idol praise the lord it's reading that today then and that place right there jacob i mean joseph dream and he said the second dream his father came and says joseph you mean me and your mother and all your brothers will bow down to you i was just thinking about that today did that fulfill did that dream fulfill do you realize that rachel died before that dream was fulfilled they broke the vision praise the lord rachel died jacob could say that and rachel is there so i mean joseph dream are never fulfilled might never come to pass and all the people that are looking for this thing came to pass and that one never came to pass and this thing came to pass praise the lord when god bring his word to pass it happen before we even see it praise the lord how did we know that that luther was was uh was a messenger how did we know that it was a revival that he was a church head messenger he came he did his work he went before him even we knew that he was a messenger let us not presume people let's not venture like we read on that quote but branham says the bride she was not she will not do anything until it is the word that is the authority that we stand on in this hour praise the lord is the authority that we stand on in this hour to wait for the rapture we have to be standing on the word because it's that power that will rapture us is that power that will lift us up from here if it is not the word you are on your own you need the mercy of god people just just presume because you know because it makes sense it makes sense it sounds right praise the lord but think about that tonight praise the lord may god give us grace hallelujah whatever we came out with as our idol may he give us grace for us to break it praise the lord we have the privilege not to be like rachel we can tell our jacob cries that this is this is my idol christ i brought this thing out in my in my first birth this thing is what is bothering amen do you know what what uh uh uh what what what happened if rachel said to to jacob i was the one that took the idol but we can say to our jacob amen this is what was handed down to me at my birth i came into the word telling lies like david said born is saying in iniquity lord this is my struggle lord i'm struggling in this area i need your grace praise the lord just like rachel said to her husband one time she said give me child right praise the lord she was she was brought she was i mean we can say the same thing to our our jacob now i only ask him for the gifts and the blessing but we can also ask him for our struggles we can take our struggles to him we can take our weaknesses to him and don't take them for granted musicians you can come tonight we can take our struggles i must tell jesus blessing their courage tonight [Music] um [Music] g i must tell jesus yes jesus can help me oh jesus [Music] jesus [Music] solo [Music] [Applause] [Music] i must have jesus yeah jesus can't pass [Applause] [Music] jesus let's sing that for us one more time oh yeah i must have jesus [Applause] [Music] lord tell jesus i must have jesus oh yeah jesus can't help me jesus one of the reasons why god had to curse the second and break every bone in his body because god had to destroy that image it has such an impression on eve if god did not destroy it there was a possibility of it repeating itself and that's the reason why god has to destroy the separate break every born in his body change his form [Music] and that's the same thing that the holy ghost comes and does it comes down and and then he says that you you're baptized with the holy ghost and fire fire consumes [Music] thank you let's just pray together tonight and just thank the lord as we put our house before god
