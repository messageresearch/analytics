[38:25] important
[38:27] very important i will tell you if you be

[38:34] he take out all the air out of my tired
[38:36] i'm sitting in the office i see what's

[39:05] one of the brothers down there from
[39:08] from tennessee
[39:10] wrote a song
[39:11] that he entitled eliezer tell me more
[39:15] and
[39:18] and it's all about uh the the messenger
[39:22] that went to go and get a bribe for
[39:24] isaac
[39:25] and so i want to i want to speak on
[39:27] there tonight eliezer tell me more
[39:31] and uh i thought
[39:34] we will we could
[39:36] learn the chorus together
[39:38] it's it's actually not a congregational
[39:41] song sometimes that's the thing that is
[39:43] difficult in singing some songs that are
[39:45] not congregational songs when you try to
[39:49] introduce it to the congregation
[39:52] it's different when you are singing
[39:53] alone and it's also different when
[39:56] you're singing in a group praise the
[39:57] lord
[39:58] hallelujah
[40:01] so uh
[40:06] you know i
[40:07] i love singing
[40:09] and then
[40:10] it's not so it's not so
[40:14] difficult for me to spoil the songs to
[40:16] very easy
[40:19] praise the lord
[40:22] so what let's let's just put the chorus
[40:24] up let me see if
[40:26] if we can learn it together

[43:21] of moriah and offer him
[43:24] there for a burnt offering
[43:26] upon one of the mountain which
[43:29] i will tell thee off
[43:32] praise the lord
[43:34] and abraham arose
[43:36] up early in the morning and soldered
[43:39] his eyes and took two of his young men
[43:43] with him
[43:44] and isaac
[43:46] his son and clint and enclaved the wood
[43:50] for the burnt offering and rose up and
[43:52] went unto the place of which god had
[43:55] taught him
[43:57] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[44:00] his eyes
[44:02] and saw the place far off now three days
[44:06] joining
[44:07] and abraham said unto
[44:09] his young men about year
[44:13] by year here
[44:14] with the eyes and i and the lead will go
[44:18] yonder and worship
[44:20] and come again
[44:23] to you
[44:24] which of course actually that could be
[44:26] like a prophecy
[44:27] because abraham god is telling him go
[44:30] and sacrifice your son but he's telling
[44:32] these men we are going to sacrifice and
[44:34] we will come back
[44:36] praise the lord
[44:38] so uh in one sense he was prophesying
[44:41] the lord bless you have your seat we
[44:42] continue to read
[44:46] praise the lord
[44:48] amen okay i will stop there to that
[44:50] verse five
[44:51] i will stop there because there are
[44:53] there are few verses
[44:55] that i want to uh
[44:57] i want to pick up
[44:58] pick up on this
[45:00] praise the lord but jordan i'm going to
[45:02] spoil this thing tonight
[45:04] because
[45:06] it's uh
[45:07] for some reason it's kind of for eating
[45:09] up my ears
[45:14] praise the lord
[45:19] now if we look into the scripture
[45:21] tonight
[45:22] uh
[45:23] uh like we that like we love to do
[45:26] you will realize
[45:28] you realize this it actually struck me
[45:32] and because it struck me
[45:34] that's the reason why
[45:35] you know
[45:37] i can do without talking about it you
[45:40] realize that the word love
[45:44] was first time used in the bible
[45:47] in this chapter
[45:53] praise the lord
[45:56] the word love
[46:00] the first time
[46:03] love will be used in the scripture
[46:07] oh praise the lord
[46:09] kind of struck me and it kind of forgot
[46:11] my attention
[46:13] that the first time
[46:15] love will be used in the bible
[46:20] will be at this very same
[46:23] it just tell you
[46:25] what really love is it's not all the
[46:28] emotion that we go through
[46:32] love
[46:34] is sacrifice
[46:38] that almighty god
[46:40] honor the direction
[46:42] of the god of heaven and earth that is
[46:44] the altar of his word
[46:47] the first time that he will use love
[46:50] will be on this scene
[46:53] of isaac
[46:54] abraham and isaac
[46:59] we're talking about there in the book of
[47:00] malachite and we we we we spoke a little
[47:03] bit about uh uh
[47:06] the four different laws that we could
[47:08] bring out of the scripture we are uh
[47:11] redemptive loving and uh sacrificial
[47:15] love elective love and and and also
[47:18] corrective love
[47:20] now
[47:21] uh uh it i mean it really struck me
[47:24] yesterday i was i was uh i was listening
[47:27] i was uh molding the learning and uh uh
[47:30] i had my earphone in my ears and and
[47:33] listening to
[47:35] you know i was just uh
[47:37] listening to some things and
[47:39] message and different things
[47:41] and uh and and uh because i had i had
[47:44] this subject on my mind
[47:47] but then it just it just kind of struck
[47:49] me you know when when uh realized
[47:53] i said no i had to go back in and kind
[47:55] of look look look at the scripture
[47:58] and so i when i got done what i was
[48:00] doing i went back and looking and
[48:02] realized i said oh yeah
[48:04] you know uh it's it's it's it's actually
[48:08] you know actually strange
[48:11] praise the lord
[48:13] and and
[48:15] it it also goes to show that uh
[48:21] you know
[48:21] god never just
[48:23] gave the instruction of writing his word
[48:27] because he did not have anything to say
[48:31] you know and even the men that were
[48:34] inspired
[48:35] you know about by the holy spirit to be
[48:37] able to pull the scriptures together
[48:39] just to see the way they lay it out
[48:42] is is is kind of for
[48:45] you know uh uh is is is fascinating but
[48:48] yeah this really got my attention
[48:50] yesterday
[48:51] that uh the first time that god or i
[48:54] mean uh love would be written in the
[48:57] bible would be in this uh in this
[48:59] chapter
[49:01] and just to see that uh it's a great
[49:04] senior but that's not what i i want to
[49:06] draw your mind to tonight what i wanted
[49:09] for us to look at tonight is this
[49:12] abraham
[49:14] and uh uh i go to abraham and says go
[49:17] and sacrifice your son and with many
[49:20] account it is proving that isaac was
[49:22] almost about the age of spiritual
[49:25] maturity he was about 30 years old when
[49:29] when god told abraham to go and
[49:31] sacrifice him now so you can see some
[49:34] some some places there but the all of
[49:36] that is now what i want to get to
[49:38] tonight what i want to get to tonight is
[49:41] that uh
[49:42] uh for many times for many years to i've
[49:45] always thought that uh when god told
[49:47] abraham to do this he was just a little
[49:50] boy i've i've always thought that i've
[49:51] preached that before but i come to
[49:53] realize that it was natural but that is
[49:56] now what i'm getting to tonight what i'm
[49:59] getting to tonight is that um i want for
[50:01] us to watch
[50:03] uh a pattern in the scripture
[50:06] now brother branham said you will find
[50:08] it in the church-ish book you will find
[50:11] in in revelation series brother branham
[50:14] said this i have one quote here
[50:16] revelation chapter four verse one i mean
[50:19] revelation four number one let's let's
[50:21] read that he talks about the church ages
[50:24] and he talks about how the first three
[50:27] church the first three chapters of
[50:30] revelation showed the church it showed
[50:32] christ in his church amen one standing
[50:35] in the midst of the seven golden candle
[50:37] state
[50:38] and uh
[50:41] and then
[50:42] revelation chapter four
[50:45] come up and says after these things
[50:47] which is after the church ages
[50:49] and and and and the lord called unto
[50:52] john and the angels say come up heaven i
[50:55] will show you things that must shortly
[50:58] come to pass
[51:00] praise the lord and that come of hatha
[51:03] is is another term for the rapture
[51:06] brother branham says the church was
[51:08] raptured
[51:09] in
[51:11] revelation chapter 4
[51:13] and she never
[51:16] came up again until revelation chapter
[51:19] 19.
[51:21] praise the lord
[51:22] when it talks about the lamb's wife
[51:28] are we together
[51:29] is that familiar with to you but let's
[51:32] let's just read a portion here he says
[51:34] after the church ages
[51:36] after the ages of the church the church
[51:40] never appeared again
[51:42] until
[51:43] revelation the 19th chapter
[51:46] when she returns
[51:49] wave her bridegroom
[51:51] praising god for the wedding
[51:55] so honor a type
[51:57] now honor a type
[52:00] praise the lord you have to understand
[52:02] this is honor a type
[52:06] the uh uh the holy spirit went through
[52:09] the seven church ages in revelation
[52:12] chapter two and three
[52:14] after he introduced himself in
[52:16] revelation chapter 1 and then in
[52:19] revelation chapter 4
[52:21] come up higher
[52:23] shows a type of the rapture
[52:26] the church is caught up
[52:29] praise the lord
[52:30] and the church does not appear again
[52:34] until it comes in revelation chapter 19
[52:37] where she referred to us the lamb's wife
[52:42] are we together
[52:44] now
[52:47] this thing really caught my mind
[52:51] it kind of reflect to my mind because uh
[52:54] there's something here in this chapter
[52:56] that plays that out
[52:58] you will see that after abraham
[53:01] uh uh uh everything that's happening up
[53:04] there we we we know the story jehovah
[53:06] jairo how abraham called the place
[53:08] jehovah jarrah and uh and on the mount
[53:12] it will be said you know the lord will
[53:14] provide for himself and uh
[53:17] and and all of that
[53:19] now you will realize that where we
[53:22] stopped
[53:23] abraham said to his seven
[53:25] he said wait for me here me and the lad
[53:29] we're going up
[53:30] he says abide here
[53:33] with the eyes and i and the lord will go
[53:36] yonder and worship
[53:38] and come again to you
[53:42] praise the lord
[53:43] are we together
[53:48] now so if you look at
[53:51] verse 19
[53:52] in the same chapter
[53:54] after all of this is done god told
[53:57] abraham blessing i will bless you
[53:59] because you held back you held that back
[54:02] your only son for me
[54:04] now in chapter in verse 19 the bible
[54:07] says so abraham returned
[54:11] on to his young man
[54:14] so abraham returned where is isaac
[54:21] praise the lord
[54:24] where is isaac
[54:27] oh definitely i believe that abraham
[54:29] returned with isaac
[54:31] i believe so
[54:33] but watch what is happening here
[54:36] the holy spirit
[54:39] the the the author of this book
[54:43] is doing something very unique
[54:49] that's the reason why brother branham
[54:51] will tell us
[54:53] that you have to run every teaching from
[54:56] genesis to revelation
[54:59] it has to run if not there is a problem
[55:02] somewhere
[55:03] the problem is now with you the problem
[55:05] is just that the holy spirit wants to
[55:07] help you to understand the text
[55:10] now just watch this now so abraham
[55:13] returned onto his young man
[55:17] and the rose up and went
[55:20] to belsheba and abraham dwer did
[55:24] and the bible went on but what you will
[55:26] realize here is that isaac is not
[55:30] mentioned year
[55:32] the next time isaac will be mentioned
[55:35] will be when he's in the field
[55:38] waiting for rebecca
[55:41] so from genesis chapter 22
[55:44] isaac is no longer mentioned in the text
[55:55] praise the lord
[56:01] are we together
[56:07] praise the lord
[56:11] are we together
[56:23] well if that make you quiet it also make
[56:25] me quiet
[56:28] because
[56:31] it's enough for you to think about it
[56:36] and for you to just see the accuracy of
[56:40] the holy spirit
[56:42] the accuracy
[56:44] of the holy spirit
[56:48] when people argue
[56:49] that the bible contradict itself
[56:52] is because they have never met the altar
[56:56] amen
[56:57] they have not sat down enough
[57:00] to learn
[57:01] they have not sat down enough
[57:03] to know who is the author
[57:06] of this book
[57:12] isaac will now be mentioned again
[57:15] until chapter 24 verse 63
[57:20] after rebecca is found
[57:25] after eliezer
[57:28] is found
[57:29] now so what what is happening here is
[57:32] that
[57:33] uh uh uh
[57:35] ma memor uh man
[57:38] moriah is uh
[57:41] calvary
[57:43] christ have died on calvary
[57:46] the lamb has has has all the price has
[57:49] been paid
[57:51] now so what is happening what is going
[57:53] to happen here now the next pressing on
[57:56] the scene
[57:58] of action is eliezer
[58:01] is the comforter
[58:03] now you also let me show you another
[58:05] thing in scripture
[58:08] chapter 24
[58:14] verse 1 and abraham was old and well
[58:17] striking in age
[58:19] and the lord have blessed abraham in all
[58:22] things
[58:24] and abraham said unto his other seven
[58:28] in his house
[58:30] that rule over
[58:32] all
[58:34] that he had put i pray thee
[58:38] the hand honor
[58:40] my time
[58:42] and i'll and and i will make this sword
[58:46] by the lord the god of heaven
[58:50] and the god of the earth
[58:53] praise the lord
[58:55] amen
[58:56] that thou shalt not take a wife
[59:00] unto my son of the daughters of the
[59:03] canines among whom i'd word
[59:07] but thou shalt go unto
[59:10] my country and to my kindred to take a
[59:13] wife unto my son
[59:16] praise the lord
[59:18] amen
[59:21] now so it's beautiful here you get over
[59:24] to chapter you get over to chapter 24
[59:27] the bible
[59:29] says here abraham called his seven
[59:32] but you will also realize here in
[59:35] chapter 24 the seventh name is not given
[59:42] who is this seven
[59:45] his name is not giving
[59:47] why did the holy spirit allow that
[59:52] oh my
[59:54] saint john chapter 16 verse 13 let's
[59:57] let's read it i heard brother brandon
[59:59] referring to that in message
[1:00:04] again
[1:00:08] in john chapter 16
[1:00:10] verse 13.
[1:00:12] the scripture says how be it when he
[1:00:16] the spirit of truth is come
[1:00:18] he will guide you into all truth
[1:00:22] for he shall not speak
[1:00:25] of himself
[1:00:30] praise the lord
[1:00:32] he shall not speak of himself
[1:00:34] so the holy spirit deliberately never
[1:00:37] gave us the name
[1:00:39] of this seven
[1:00:44] because what is going to happen here it
[1:00:47] it's not about
[1:00:49] who is this man it's all about what he's
[1:00:52] told to do
[1:00:54] it's all about what he's going to
[1:00:56] achieve
[1:00:57] it's not about him
[1:00:59] it's not about his personality what his
[1:01:01] name is where he was born and what
[1:01:03] happened in his life
[1:01:06] what is important here is to get a bribe
[1:01:09] for abraham's son
[1:01:14] praise the lord
[1:01:16] so the holy spirit deliberately took the
[1:01:19] name of the seven away
[1:01:22] the only reason why
[1:01:25] we can say it's eleazar is because of
[1:01:28] genesis 15.
[1:01:34] all through the text
[1:01:39] oh praise the lord
[1:01:44] i'm signing crazy tonight
[1:01:48] am i losing my mind tonight
[1:01:50] praise the lord
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:58] are we together
[1:02:02] the holy spirit deliberately
[1:02:07] took the name of the seven away
[1:02:11] because jesus says when the spirit of
[1:02:14] truth
[1:02:15] comes
[1:02:17] that's where you know the spirit of
[1:02:18] truth when a man is just all about
[1:02:21] promoting himself
[1:02:24] there is something about it
[1:02:27] praise the lord
[1:02:28] when he will spend more time talking
[1:02:30] about himself
[1:02:34] i'm talking about the lord jesus
[1:02:36] or what he have done in our age and what
[1:02:38] he's doing in the life of his people
[1:02:41] then there is something
[1:02:43] maybe that man need more of the grace of
[1:02:46] god
[1:02:47] he need another dose of the comforter in
[1:02:49] his life
[1:02:53] praise the lord
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:58] because you see that's the reason that's
[1:03:00] the way people establish themselves in
[1:03:02] the hearts of the people
[1:03:06] instead instead of establishing christ
[1:03:09] you will see that's the reason why the
[1:03:11] holy spirit took his name
[1:03:13] out of the text and you also watch the
[1:03:16] character of this man
[1:03:18] when he marry back her he never told
[1:03:20] rebecca where he was born who his mother
[1:03:23] is and how long he been in abraham a
[1:03:25] house all he told rebecca was all about
[1:03:28] isaac
[1:03:39] because jesus said when the comforter
[1:03:41] comes
[1:03:43] will not talk about himself
[1:03:48] so you you just look at it there
[1:03:51] see
[1:03:51] a divine work of the holy spirit
[1:03:56] it took isaac from the same
[1:04:01] because there is a seven now that is
[1:04:03] going to be called
[1:04:06] just in that period
[1:04:08] before christ and his bride return on
[1:04:11] the earth before you see the bride and
[1:04:13] the bridegroom together there's a seven
[1:04:15] that is going to be called there's a
[1:04:17] work that is going to be done
[1:04:20] and that work
[1:04:22] is to find a bride
[1:04:27] the work is to find a bride what is
[1:04:30] major
[1:04:31] what is major is to find a bride
[1:04:40] are we together
[1:04:47] yeah well you might think that i'm crazy
[1:04:49] but that's okay
[1:04:51] praise the lord
[1:04:59] hallelujah
[1:05:02] amen brother brown said in the super
[1:05:04] sign he says
[1:05:06] when elisa a type of the holy spirit
[1:05:11] that
[1:05:12] that come to find a bride
[1:05:15] he found how
[1:05:16] in the cool of the evening
[1:05:21] get what it is this day last day last
[1:05:24] part of the day
[1:05:26] when the evening light is shining
[1:05:29] he phoned her
[1:05:31] and noticed he had to be
[1:05:34] with two different people
[1:05:37] two different people he had to deal with
[1:05:40] she had a family
[1:05:42] but the only one that eliezer had to
[1:05:46] deal with was
[1:05:48] her mother which is her old church
[1:05:51] [Laughter]
[1:05:57] praise the lord
[1:05:59] oh
[1:06:00] my
[1:06:01] and one of the church members
[1:06:04] praise the lord
[1:06:08] praise the lord
[1:06:10] amen brother jordan you can come and
[1:06:12] finish the message tonight
[1:06:15] amen because it looks like i'm about to
[1:06:17] lose it
[1:06:20] glory be to god
[1:06:24] now you see i i just wanted to show you
[1:06:26] this i just wanted to show you that you
[1:06:29] can never go wrong
[1:06:31] when you stay with god's word
[1:06:34] praise the lord don't put an
[1:06:36] interpretation to it
[1:06:38] allow god
[1:06:40] to run his word true
[1:06:45] he will bring out everything
[1:06:50] that the messenger of this age said he
[1:06:52] would bring it out of the bible
[1:07:06] that's why we love the message
[1:07:08] because it's out of the bible
[1:07:13] it's now something from jeffersonville
[1:07:16] it's not some kind of excluded teaching
[1:07:20] it's something right from the pages of
[1:07:22] the bible
[1:07:31] so we want to talk a little bit about
[1:07:33] eliezer because that's that's what the
[1:07:35] holy spirit is is major on the name
[1:07:38] eliezer means god is his help
[1:07:44] god is his help
[1:07:47] eliza means the comforter that what he
[1:07:50] names means
[1:07:54] oh
[1:07:55] praise the lord
[1:07:58] amen
[1:08:00] are you glad that we have the comforter
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:05] the comforter is the spirit of truth
[1:08:10] praise the lord
[1:08:18] hanes means
[1:08:21] god is his help
[1:08:23] god is help
[1:08:30] so we realize that
[1:08:33] he comes
[1:08:35] right after
[1:08:37] the time of the sacrifice
[1:08:40] he comes right after
[1:08:43] abraham has proven his love to god
[1:08:47] like i said the first time that the word
[1:08:50] love will be used in the bible if
[1:08:53] sacrifice is not attached to your love
[1:08:55] you have problem
[1:08:57] praise the lord
[1:08:59] if if what you think about love is all
[1:09:02] about you and your your feelings and
[1:09:05] your thoughts you got it wrong
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:11] you are talking about infatuation
[1:09:13] you're not talking about the love of god
[1:09:17] because in the love of god there is
[1:09:19] correction
[1:09:21] god love is based on sacrifice for god
[1:09:24] so loved the word
[1:09:29] man it kind of blew my mind
[1:09:32] yesterday so my goodness
[1:09:36] the first time
[1:09:38] that love
[1:09:40] it is it's almost like the first time
[1:09:42] the word pleasure
[1:09:45] will be mentioned in the bible was when
[1:09:47] sarah said it i've been an old woman
[1:09:50] where i have pleasure with my husband
[1:09:52] and yet the bible says god made us
[1:09:54] for his pleasure amen
[1:10:00] glory be to god
[1:10:03] now so we see here that
[1:10:06] abraham is sending out this his seven to
[1:10:09] go and get a bribe for isaac
[1:10:16] and he has a mission he's he has to go
[1:10:19] over
[1:10:21] not in the world now to the canaanites
[1:10:24] but to go over to the kingdom where i
[1:10:27] mean abraham country abraham home and
[1:10:29] find a wife for isaac
[1:10:32] praise the lord
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:38] amen
[1:10:48] now let's read here endlessly contending
[1:10:50] for the faith let me just share some
[1:10:52] things with you
[1:10:53] what i wanted to get you tonight i i
[1:10:56] think if i i've been able to express him
[1:10:58] i'm just stressing that the holy spirit
[1:11:00] will be able to to to help you to see it
[1:11:03] remember it was isaac
[1:11:05] that wanted a wife
[1:11:07] then father abraham sent his seven out
[1:11:12] a very beautiful type of god the father
[1:11:14] sent him out
[1:11:16] for his bride
[1:11:18] to get his bride his seventh the holy
[1:11:20] spirit
[1:11:21] eliezer and it was in the court of the
[1:11:24] evening
[1:11:26] when beautiful rebecca came out
[1:11:30] to water the candle
[1:11:32] you know the story and beautiful rebecca
[1:11:35] came out and he said now
[1:11:38] ever who watered this campaign
[1:11:41] he said lord let thou be the one you
[1:11:45] have chosen now that was abraham i mean
[1:11:48] that was eliezer praying
[1:11:50] we ever come out and water this candle
[1:11:53] now somewhere there but brahms said uh
[1:11:55] uh
[1:11:56] it kind of
[1:11:57] uh uh you know it struck my mind when i
[1:12:00] heard him saying that he says
[1:12:02] he said eliezer
[1:12:05] sweated it out
[1:12:07] till he finds character
[1:12:11] in rebecca
[1:12:13] we will get to that
[1:12:15] let's just read a little bit here
[1:12:17] so he prayed and said whoever lord will
[1:12:20] come out
[1:12:22] and water the campbell
[1:12:25] he said lord
[1:12:27] let that be the one you have chosen and
[1:12:29] rebecca went out and watered the candle
[1:12:31] and gave them to drink and then water it
[1:12:35] and after after
[1:12:36] after giving them to drink uh you know
[1:12:39] uh uh uh i mean you know if you know
[1:12:41] about campbell and how much they can
[1:12:43] drink you will know that that was not
[1:12:44] children's plan
[1:12:47] the very animal
[1:12:48] that that she was watering animal
[1:12:52] represented beasts caused a beast
[1:12:55] of burden which means power in the bible
[1:12:58] amen
[1:13:00] he says in the very animal that she
[1:13:02] water was the very animal that packed
[1:13:04] her to see
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:08] her bridegroom is that right yeah he see
[1:13:10] her bride but it's the bridegroom we
[1:13:12] know that and and and what is watering
[1:13:15] their very power that we are watering
[1:13:21] now
[1:13:22] with praise and thanksgiving
[1:13:25] praise the lord
[1:13:27] the glory the power of the might is the
[1:13:29] very holy spirit that will pick us up
[1:13:33] now this is very important tonight to
[1:13:36] realize that when we come in the house
[1:13:38] of god
[1:13:39] i mean that uh like we say over and over
[1:13:42] it's not a showmanship that's why we
[1:13:44] must come pray up because when we come
[1:13:46] in the house of god
[1:13:48] you have a responsibility to help the
[1:13:51] song leader bring worship to the house
[1:13:53] of god praise the lord amen and and and
[1:13:57] and just like how the preacher must
[1:13:59] prepare
[1:14:00] i believe the song leader the musicians
[1:14:02] even the worshiper we all must prepare
[1:14:05] because it's very important we come to
[1:14:08] water the the holy spirit we come to to
[1:14:11] to be able to bring praises and glory to
[1:14:14] god
[1:14:15] because he's saying the very same power
[1:14:18] that we raise up that we worship that we
[1:14:20] glorify will be thus very same power
[1:14:23] that will pick us up
[1:14:25] praise the lord
[1:14:27] i mean that's that's that's our place
[1:14:29] just like how rebecca how to water those
[1:14:33] candles
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:37] pulling water from the well not just
[1:14:39] turning the top on and going to play on
[1:14:41] her phone
[1:14:42] she was pulling water out of the well
[1:14:46] she needed to get some muscles
[1:14:48] to be able to feel those uh candles and
[1:14:51] get them to drain and even store water
[1:14:54] for the joining back home
[1:14:57] praise the lord
[1:14:59] that's the place of the church
[1:15:01] we must come clap our hands lift our
[1:15:04] hands up lift our voices to worship and
[1:15:07] sing to god
[1:15:17] praise the lord
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:21] because our attitude in worship shows
[1:15:23] how much we are prepared for the world
[1:15:27] if you come singing and slumbering and
[1:15:30] and knocking your hands and your spirit
[1:15:32] is all over your mind thinking about
[1:15:34] everything you are not ready for the
[1:15:35] word what you would what are you doing
[1:15:37] is that you are punishing the preacher
[1:15:43] you are punishing the preacher
[1:15:47] because you're coming he's got to be all
[1:15:49] over the place so nervous because the
[1:15:51] atmosphere is now right the minds of the
[1:15:53] people are all scattered about
[1:16:06] songs is not just singing hymns
[1:16:08] it's communication you got to get a hold
[1:16:11] of the people
[1:16:13] you are leading the people in the
[1:16:15] presence of god it's not just passing
[1:16:17] saying kingdom number four let's just
[1:16:18] sing no
[1:16:20] you are leading these people before the
[1:16:22] tune of grace
[1:16:27] praise the lord
[1:16:30] don't be like me singing and missing all
[1:16:32] the words
[1:16:43] praise the lord
[1:16:45] the very same beast the same animal
[1:16:50] that she water
[1:16:53] praise the lord
[1:16:55] you see that's the reason why after the
[1:16:57] preaching of the world we must
[1:17:00] water the beast
[1:17:02] we must praise him
[1:17:04] we must say thank you lord for your word
[1:17:06] so when we are singing hymns and we are
[1:17:08] worshiping after the services is now to
[1:17:11] play down the world that's what the
[1:17:13] scriptures command us to do
[1:17:20] brother branham says we must water the
[1:17:22] world with praise
[1:17:25] that's how you water the word with
[1:17:27] praise
[1:17:30] you lift your hands up and say lord
[1:17:32] thank you for your word that has come to
[1:17:34] us
[1:17:36] father thank you for the holy spirit
[1:17:37] dealing with my heart
[1:17:43] when we sing victory this mind you say
[1:17:45] lord yeah your word brought victory
[1:17:46] tonight so victory is mine
[1:17:53] i don't know how much victory we have
[1:17:54] when we vader it is mine
[1:17:58] victory is mine praise the lord
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:07] you're actually showing something
[1:18:09] different from what you are confessing
[1:18:12] people with victory are people that
[1:18:13] shout
[1:18:14] that strain
[1:18:16] that rejoice
[1:18:20] so the same base
[1:18:22] that we water
[1:18:24] will be the same power that will take us
[1:18:27] off from here
[1:18:29] praise the lord
[1:18:31] the bride is not leaving from here with
[1:18:33] side faces
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:38] we're not leaving from here we side
[1:18:39] faces with we head hanging down
[1:18:43] and our mouth open staring no
[1:18:46] we are leaving from here victorious
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:51] praise the lord
[1:19:01] are we together let's go on a little bit
[1:19:03] here
[1:19:04] praise the lord
[1:19:06] amen the very power animal that she
[1:19:10] water was the same animal that packed
[1:19:12] her to see her bridegroom is that right
[1:19:14] that's what that's that's
[1:19:16] and what is watering the very power that
[1:19:19] we are watering now with praises and
[1:19:21] thanksgiving and glory then power might
[1:19:25] is the very same holy spirit that will
[1:19:27] pack us pack us up
[1:19:30] to see jesus someday
[1:19:33] look it was in the court of the evening
[1:19:34] when isaac walked out
[1:19:38] and some people says what if
[1:19:41] you see him
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:44] he is a real dark juice i don't care
[1:19:47] what he looks like
[1:19:49] he's my savior
[1:19:51] and when the bride sees him
[1:19:54] it will be love at first sight
[1:19:59] on rebecca seeing isaac
[1:20:01] she jumped off her camera
[1:20:04] and run to meet him
[1:20:06] it was love at first sight
[1:20:10] praise the lord
[1:20:12] when she seen isaac why because
[1:20:15] of how much eliezer spoke of isaac
[1:20:20] praise the lord
[1:20:22] of all the things that eliezer said this
[1:20:26] was a man that grew up in abraham house
[1:20:29] as a child he grew up he saw sarah
[1:20:32] waiting for the promise he knew how many
[1:20:34] years this was he knew when isaac was a
[1:20:37] baby
[1:20:40] this was the eldest the seven in abraham
[1:20:43] house
[1:20:45] he was not talking about himself all
[1:20:48] through the joining he was telling
[1:20:52] rebecca all about isaac what he likes to
[1:20:56] eat what he don't likes
[1:20:58] so when when she saw him he was no
[1:21:01] longer a stranger
[1:21:05] praise the lord
[1:21:07] he was no longer a stranger to to her
[1:21:10] she knew everything
[1:21:12] no wonder he could pack her right into
[1:21:14] her to his mama house
[1:21:21] are we together
[1:21:23] now so uh that's that that's that's uh
[1:21:27] uh uh uh uh uh the important things i
[1:21:31] want you to watch out tonight are we
[1:21:32] almost out of time here so you have to
[1:21:35] realize and just just like we said uh
[1:21:38] now don't misunderstand me now don't
[1:21:40] don't misquote me tonight
[1:21:42] i'm i'm just i'm i'm putting it in a
[1:21:44] type you know because brother branham
[1:21:46] lay out here and says
[1:21:48] uh uh you know when uh
[1:21:50] the
[1:21:52] the the church raptured in uh revelation
[1:21:55] chapter four
[1:21:56] she's not
[1:21:58] you know she's not seen again
[1:22:00] now
[1:22:01] that that will buy for you in a little
[1:22:03] bit because revelation chapter five
[1:22:05] comes up and says who is walter to take
[1:22:07] the bulk and to lose the seals now
[1:22:10] revelation chapter 5 we know that that
[1:22:13] is the redemption of the church
[1:22:17] praise the lord
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:20] now so
[1:22:21] the church does not show up until
[1:22:25] she comes to her bridegroom in
[1:22:27] revelation chapter 19 so that's that's
[1:22:29] the scene i'm trying to play out for you
[1:22:31] here that uh genesis gave us
[1:22:34] a similar account the isaac after
[1:22:41] the experience on the mountain
[1:22:44] for some reason isaac just disappeared
[1:22:47] from the text
[1:22:50] the scripture was said nothing about him
[1:22:52] again until
[1:22:53] in
[1:22:54] chapter 24
[1:22:57] verse 63
[1:22:59] yeah verse 63 before the bible says and
[1:23:01] then you know uh rebecca saw the man
[1:23:04] walking in the field then isaac comes
[1:23:07] back on the scene and this time it is
[1:23:09] with his bride
[1:23:14] praise the lord
[1:23:16] but in chapter 4 chapter 24 now we're
[1:23:19] open with abraham
[1:23:21] instructing his seven to go and get a
[1:23:24] bride
[1:23:26] but also the name of the seven
[1:23:29] will not be mentioned in the text
[1:23:32] why because on a time
[1:23:36] he's representing the holy spirit
[1:23:39] he's representing the comforter
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:44] that is going that has been working
[1:23:46] through
[1:23:47] the church ages to get a bride
[1:23:55] to get christ a bride
[1:24:05] sign sign of this time
[1:24:08] and uh that's a true seven of god always
[1:24:12] is obedient to his master
[1:24:14] see
[1:24:15] not to show off or say something
[1:24:19] to to elect somebody else he said but
[1:24:22] be earnest and truth to him that sent
[1:24:25] him
[1:24:27] that's the true seven of christ like
[1:24:30] elijah
[1:24:32] a representative coming from abraham to
[1:24:35] pick up the bride to isaac
[1:24:38] the beautiful rebecca obedient
[1:24:41] the more than seven he was about the
[1:24:44] master's business alone what a type
[1:24:48] of the holy spirit today the same thing
[1:24:52] picking
[1:24:53] picking out a bride in the evening time
[1:24:57] when the lights
[1:24:59] are going out
[1:25:01] praise the lord
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:11] he was an obedient seven
[1:25:14] he was an earnest heaven
[1:25:20] even messenger brother branham said
[1:25:22] eliezer wasn't speaking of himself
[1:25:26] but he was speaking all the one he was
[1:25:29] sent from
[1:25:32] and he had the gifts to prove
[1:25:36] that he was saved
[1:25:39] from him
[1:25:42] praise the lord
[1:25:44] because he never just underwent with
[1:25:46] candles he went with gifts
[1:25:50] praise the lord because the bible says
[1:25:52] he gave rebecca gifts
[1:25:58] he brought gifts to the church
[1:26:02] praise the lord
[1:26:03] amen and you know why why he brought
[1:26:06] gifts to the church because he don't
[1:26:08] want you to be a bench warmer
[1:26:10] [Laughter]
[1:26:12] he wants for each and every one of you
[1:26:14] to have something to do
[1:26:17] that's why he brought gifts to the
[1:26:18] church
[1:26:20] so we can all have something to do
[1:26:24] praise the lord
[1:26:25] we can all be worshipers we can all be
[1:26:28] singers we can all
[1:26:30] praise the lord
[1:26:32] hallelujah
[1:26:34] glory be to god
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:40] preaching at the back of the pulpit is
[1:26:41] not the only gift
[1:26:44] praise the lord
[1:26:49] singing special playing music
[1:26:53] bringing
[1:26:54] a prayer warrior
[1:26:58] praise the lord
[1:27:00] he had a gift to proof that he was sent
[1:27:06] just one more lord he said eleazar
[1:27:09] sweated it out till he found character
[1:27:13] in rebecca
[1:27:14] because he was not just going to take
[1:27:16] any kind of a girl
[1:27:19] so he lay out some
[1:27:22] strong condition
[1:27:25] one that would come without me asking
[1:27:31] that we have a desire to do something
[1:27:34] without me asking
[1:27:37] that's why eliezer said without me
[1:27:39] asking
[1:27:45] why because he won the same holy spirit
[1:27:48] that was dealing with his heart must
[1:27:50] also be able to deal with the heart of
[1:27:52] the people
[1:27:56] now waiting to be told and waiting to be
[1:27:58] back
[1:28:04] he said lord without me asking
[1:28:07] if any young woman would come and be
[1:28:10] willing
[1:28:13] to give me water to drink
[1:28:16] praise the lord
[1:28:17] now only be interested in giving me
[1:28:20] water to drink
[1:28:22] but also to water my camels
[1:28:33] because every young woman might be
[1:28:35] attracted to a stranger where are you
[1:28:37] coming from where are you going
[1:28:40] are you hungry
[1:28:43] and then i have no thought to think
[1:28:44] about there was a camera that wrote this
[1:28:47] man out of this way
[1:28:50] elaiza sweated it out
[1:28:53] till he found
[1:28:54] character in rebecca
[1:28:58] then he had to get her dress up
[1:29:04] that was some of the work
[1:29:06] of eleazar that is some of the work of
[1:29:09] the holy spirit
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:12] he had to take our wallet desires away
[1:29:15] amen our wallet ambitions away and get
[1:29:18] us dressed up for our bridegroom
[1:29:24] praise the lord
[1:29:25] do you know that rebecca was a gentile
[1:29:27] bride
[1:29:29] oh yeah she was a gentile bride
[1:29:32] you know that eve was a gentile bride
[1:29:36] she was a gentile bride
[1:29:39] sure
[1:29:41] oh praise the lord
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:46] glory be to god
[1:29:48] i'll say the same two to brother wow
[1:29:51] amen
[1:29:52] hallelujah
[1:29:54] that's when the holy spirit strikes you
[1:29:55] that's why you do you say wow
[1:29:57] glory be to god
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:05] he sweated it out
[1:30:07] then he had to dress her up ready
[1:30:10] let her stand still and listen to his
[1:30:14] message
[1:30:15] stop the too much talking rebecca if you
[1:30:18] annoy about isaac you must listen
[1:30:23] praise the lord
[1:30:24] you don't have no idea where are you
[1:30:26] going
[1:30:27] you don't have no idea what are you
[1:30:29] arguing about
[1:30:31] praise the lord
[1:30:32] your opinion does not matter this time
[1:30:35] rebecca
[1:30:37] praise the lord
[1:30:39] she had to stand still
[1:30:41] enlist him
[1:30:47] praise the lord
[1:30:49] and say speak my lord
[1:30:51] your seven listen
[1:30:54] that's the word that's the way the bride
[1:30:55] that's the way the believer of this hour
