[51:39] lad to be in his presence
[51:43] [Music]
[51:45] this is uniting time in sign
[51:48] time for the invisible union of the
[51:50] earthly bride and the heavenly
[51:52] bridegroom Christ
[51:54] now I want to speak on a subject not too
[52:00] deep at we want to eat on egos food
[52:06] I want to speak on the unseen world and
[52:08] the supernatural under the subtitle the
[52:11] mystery of the Resurrection and our
[52:12] loved one
[52:14] in theory Exodus Branham says
[52:17] we had it on slide but I don't know
[52:21] oh this region Minnesota
[52:24] our point he says in paragraph 1555 he
[52:28] says God never forget his promises in
[52:30] the season the Jew time God always makes
[52:34] these promises right therefore you can
[52:37] rest assured that what God has promised
[52:39] in the Bible is going to do it here we
[52:41] go if God promised to Holocaust
[52:45] if God promised to heal you he would do
[52:47] it he is not a man that he should die
[52:50] what's power to truck lied he says God's
[52:54] Word never does grow old through every
[52:57] generation this word has been read by
[52:59] men by priests and so forth and it never
[53:02] does grow old as each time I read it I
[53:05] find something new that I overlooked the
[53:07] first time because it is inspired it's
[53:10] God in letter form now if you read if
[53:13] you buy and use yesterday it's already
[53:15] expired am i communicating but if I read
[53:19] the Bible I find something new why
[53:22] because it is inspired it is bored in
[53:24] letter form so if you read your Bible it
[53:27] can filter your friends if you read your
[53:29] Bible to filter the kind of music that
[53:31] you listen to I want to appreciate the
[53:33] entire church for coming this morning I
[53:35] can always that comes to town but our
[53:38] intention to preach to tears and be
[53:41] first pair is not meant
[53:43] and for human being it is always a
[53:46] blessing and encouragement when it
[53:48] becomes finds people amen don't take
[53:52] that for granted really fast that's all
[53:55] of em ha I'll be a blessing
[54:00] I believe that today you not miss
[54:02] anything it's me man that you want to I
[54:06] want you to arrest what that God is
[54:09] going to bless you now
[54:12] Bravo nancies
[54:16] want to appreciate the part
[54:26] so there's so much love well together
[54:29] with you ice is the greatest success in
[54:32] the industry cause of divine love
[54:34] knowledge is good but it is but in the
[54:37] stem cutting love a lot of people seek
[54:39] knowledge from 1,200 tips from the Bible
[54:43] Radha but it was love that sent them
[54:45] Oh hundred tips reviews the one who is
[54:48] defined love and it does didn't give us
[54:51] to know about it or to know about him
[54:55] but they just like to know him first to
[55:00] know him his life not to know about him
[55:03] knowing about someone is like someone
[55:05] giving you information about someone
[55:07] else but to know him his life meaning
[55:10] you must have a personal relationship
[55:12] with God so the Seventh Seal open
[55:15] another world to us them ensue are the
[55:18] hidden secrets of redemption if Essex
[55:20] use is and suffering the white horse of
[55:24] religious deception that deceived the
[55:26] church if the first Eve and the second
[55:29] if I have some volume here the second
[55:31] seal is the Red Horse of war in
[55:33] bloodshed let's see the Black Horse of
[55:36] economic famine and death what she
[55:39] refused the pestilence fifty shows the
[55:43] Holocaust am I going too fast the sixty
[55:46] point to the thousand earth the Great
[55:49] Tribulation and the Battle of Armageddon
[55:51] but the seventy see who shows us how to
[55:54] get back from where we fell from the
[55:57] seven seals are refused the mighty God
[56:00] his seven seals the reveals Christ in
[56:02] every scripture problem says if you read
[56:05] your Bible and you don't find Jesus
[56:07] Christ go back and read again because he
[56:09] was the entire team of the whole Bible
[56:11] instead law it is region of me i come in
[56:13] the volume of the book he's from Genesis
[56:15] 1 to revelation 22 and there's been
[56:18] unveiled before us we see him we know
[56:21] him we know who he is we know what he
[56:24] was we know who he is today and we know
[56:27] what is to come so this sue that opened
[56:30] up check our our amnesia and make us see
[56:32] the mystery of our names in the Lamb's
[56:34] Book of Life because to know your
[56:36] perfect position is connected with
[56:38] perfect faith your position is connected
[56:41] with your power not 7zu book revelations
[56:44] 10 H 2:11 John was taught to eat a book
[56:47] there was a time was in the message but
[56:49] when you eat the book he messages into
[56:52] in that he says in that day you know
[56:55] that I in you and you in me that's why
[56:57] Paul says we have this treasure
[56:59] in our earthly vessels he reminds says
[57:01] we have the title deed in our earthly
[57:03] vessels and Brom says this is the secret
[57:05] the word is in the bride as Christ was
[57:09] in Mary Mary was walking around knowing
[57:11] the mister of Christ formed in hair he
[57:14] knew the prophets prophesy formed inside
[57:16] of her when the mighty angels came to
[57:19] her and give her the food and of Isaiah
[57:21] 7:14 and he said the Virgin shall
[57:23] conceive a sire so we see Haga was
[57:27] carrying Ishmael Ishmael was a fighter
[57:29] as a persecutor his hand was continually
[57:33] against his brethren but Sir I received
[57:36] a new name
[57:38] Donna was bringing the mister of Isaac
[57:40] Isaac was bringing the mr. of Christ and
[57:43] you move with me the brothers on the
[57:45] slides so there were three women in that
[57:47] time it was Hagar there was lots wife
[57:51] and they were Sarai in Genesis 17 verse
[57:54] 15 the Bible says and God said unto
[57:56] Abraham as for thy wife Sarai thou shalt
[58:00] not call sorry but chorus Sarah with an
[58:03] H now be her name so God put an edge in
[58:06] Sarah and an etch in Abraham H in Hebrew
[58:10] represent God
[58:12] the Bible says let's read once again the
[58:16] risk that we have read let's read once
[58:17] again together let's not your heart be
[58:19] troubled let's read together you believe
[58:22] in God leave also in me in my father's
[58:25] house are many mansions I go to prepare
[58:29] a place for you and if I go to prepare a
[58:31] place for you I'll come again and
[58:33] receive you unto myself that where I am
[58:35] maybe also and whither I go you know the
[58:39] way then Thomas said unto Him Lord we
[58:42] know not whither thou goest how do we
[58:45] know the way and Jesus said unto Him
[58:47] let's wait together I am the way come on
[58:50] let's read together I am the way the
[58:52] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[58:56] the father but by me
[58:58] so without the way there is no going
[59:01] without the truth day's no knowing
[59:05] without the life there is no living but
[59:08] the way is seven steps to God the truth
[59:12] is seven voices the life is seven
[59:15] virtues the whole plan of redemption
[59:17] laid in the son of man he was the super
[59:20] sign he was the head of a new creation
[59:24] he came by a virgin birth we see the
[59:27] serpent seed brought before
[59:29] everyone of us died in Adam when he died
[59:32] Moses couldn't redeem us Elijah couldn't
[59:36] redeem us here a Maya could not redeem
[59:38] us Isiah couldn't redeem us don't the
[59:41] greatest man born of a woman couldn't
[59:42] redeem us so the serpent seed made a way
[59:45] for the virgin birth the virgin birth
[59:48] made a way for the incarnation of God
[59:50] God the Creator by creation created a
[59:55] body and came and stepped into that body
[59:57] or redemption to redeem his fallen
[1:00:01] creation who is the way is the truth and
[1:00:04] is the life he says no man cometh to the
[1:00:06] Father but by me he says in my father's
[1:00:09] house are many mansions the theologians
[1:00:12] they couldn't decode what the Bible
[1:00:13] meant they thought that was mansions a
[1:00:15] seven-bedroom the house with an end suit
[1:00:17] but when the prophet went to the city
[1:00:19] dimension he came back and said heaven
[1:00:21] is not what mama thought it was he says
[1:00:24] those mansions which were being talked
[1:00:26] they are not houses they are bodies in
[1:00:28] my father's house are many bodies as
[1:00:31] does this earthly Tabernacle be
[1:00:33] dissolved you have another man shot
[1:00:35] waiting for you but to get there we are
[1:00:38] trapped in this sex born body we are
[1:00:40] bound here in grab by time we are held
[1:00:44] in a dimension called time
[1:00:46] Luther Wesley and Pentecostal message
[1:00:50] couldn't check us out horse and buggy
[1:00:52] couldn't check us out motorcar couldn't
[1:00:55] check us out aeroplane couldn't take us
[1:00:58] out but in this astronaut age in this
[1:01:01] ego age 11 thunders uttered their voices
[1:01:04] open this new book to reveal to us the
[1:01:08] way to come from flesh to words like
[1:01:10] Enoch world the pyramid was the second
[1:01:12] Bible the first Bible was destroyed yak
[1:01:15] the second Bible was the pyramid and the
[1:01:17] tied Bible is the rich and Bible that we
[1:01:19] have in bra Branham says we are living
[1:01:21] in the 22nd chapter of the Book of
[1:01:23] Revelations we are living in the age of
[1:01:25] the caption of the pyramid we are living
[1:01:28] in the age of Leo the Lion so we have
[1:01:30] three Bibles but one author but the
[1:01:33] Bible is a plan of redemption
[1:01:35] six edges died to go to heaven Enoch was
[1:01:39] disturbed from the first Adam so six
[1:01:42] edges died to go to heaven but in this
[1:01:45] hour the seventh from the second Adam
[1:01:47] there is a people in Minnesota who
[1:01:51] received the opening of the Seventh Seal
[1:01:53] it's a mystery to show us how to prepare
[1:01:56] for great translation faith who knows us
[1:01:58] from time to eternity this is the hour
[1:02:01] this board will put on immortality this
[1:02:04] is the hour the churches to be raptured
[1:02:05] this I said I've got to prepare place
[1:02:08] and now come again so Paul saw a
[1:02:10] three-fold mystery Festus and a lens for
[1:02:12] our speaking of Jesus coming again with
[1:02:15] a shout number one and a voice and a
[1:02:17] trumpet so we see in second
[1:02:19] Thessalonians one who speaks about Jesus
[1:02:22] being reviewed with his mighty angels
[1:02:25] coming in flaming fire from heaven and
[1:02:27] we saw the cloud came in 1963 then when
[1:02:30] it comes to be glorified in his Saints
[1:02:32] he has to come in glorification change
[1:02:35] dimension rupturing faith lays in the
[1:02:39] message it must be taken away from
[1:02:42] message books and tips and putting us
[1:02:44] lose the read the same Bible that
[1:02:47] brother brother bred but he only saw
[1:02:49] justification he got the materials and
[1:02:52] went and made horse and buggy Wesley saw
[1:02:55] a little more than Luther because they
[1:02:57] were based on the father made our
[1:02:58] teachings so he went because remember
[1:03:02] that time the the church was - it bound
[1:03:05] him we went and made a motor car at the
[1:03:07] Pentecostal started seeing something to
[1:03:09] do with the gifts of the Spirit like
[1:03:11] they made an aeroplane something that
[1:03:13] would take them up but the problem is
[1:03:16] aeroplanes only fly around
[1:03:18] but there was one who came who looked
[1:03:22] for materials that load the Wesley and
[1:03:24] Pentecostals couldn't find in the Bible
[1:03:26] he found a man that God made in the
[1:03:29] Garden of Eden he found how the four
[1:03:32] came by the Serpent's seed he began to
[1:03:34] understand why Jesus couldn't be born by
[1:03:36] sex he found what condition new birth to
[1:03:39] bring a man into he found that only the
[1:03:42] elect is eternal because God is eternal
[1:03:45] he found that we bypassed our - you're
[1:03:48] funny because when we came we were
[1:03:50] supposed to come from thought to word to
[1:03:52] flesh but a man born of the woman goes
[1:03:55] from thoughts to flesh by passing the
[1:03:56] word am i preaching well he found that
[1:03:59] only the redeemed of angels behold in
[1:04:02] their father's face and is the great
[1:04:04] Albert Einstein you know Albert Einstein
[1:04:06] was a scientist who says that many of
[1:04:09] power to create worlds but him this one
[1:04:11] was the great Albert Einstein he created
[1:04:14] squirrels as God did in the beginning
[1:04:16] when he said let there be light and they
[1:04:19] led everything in 1,200 chips so these
[1:04:21] experiments of spiritual scientists must
[1:04:24] be raised in our local churches so that
[1:04:27] we can have this supernatural Atmos
[1:04:30] now before you travel in natural journey
[1:04:32] or you travel probably to any country
[1:04:37] we do this every day you want to
[1:04:40] understand it times and season it is
[1:04:43] before you go there you want to
[1:04:45] understand the time you're going to
[1:04:47] arrive you want to help the research and
[1:04:50] the knowledge and the requirements
[1:04:53] that that country has for example if I
[1:04:56] came here in America - Oscar what the
[1:04:59] season day was we always want to come
[1:05:01] when it's summer because no one wants
[1:05:03] white people's weather
[1:05:07] why don't you have the research to have
[1:05:09] the knowledge of what season I'm going
[1:05:11] to arrive there so that I know what kind
[1:05:13] of clothing I'm going to carry and ask

[1:05:34] on Transfiguration conference
[1:05:37] now Moses was bought 1,400 years before
[1:05:40] Christ and was born in Egypt and Pharaoh
[1:05:43] was king of Egypt as Elijah was born 800
[1:05:47] years before Christ and he lived in the
[1:05:50] time of AAHA been Jezebel Moses and
[1:05:53] Elijah never lived in the same time
[1:05:56] and we see them in the Monde
[1:05:58] Transfiguration we see Peter James and
[1:06:01] John earthly witnesses in that
[1:06:02] terrestrial body in this natural body
[1:06:05] play tired Moses and Elijah appeared in
[1:06:08] their teo funnies and then Jesus passed
[1:06:11] into glorification what was happening
[1:06:13] there what was reading the second coming
[1:06:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ what coming are
[1:06:18] we in - we are in the second coming of
[1:06:20] the Lord Jesus Christ and we are living
[1:06:22] in the time of the four raptures
[1:06:24] Alleluia the first rapture was Enoch
[1:06:27] when he walked with God and he was not
[1:06:29] and God took him the second one was
[1:06:31] Elijah the third one was Jesus when he
[1:06:34] came to pick up his Old Testament Saints
[1:06:36] in the fourth one that's us can you give
[1:06:38] me the picture of the Prophet now in
[1:06:41] 1950 Houston Texas
[1:06:46] some preachers who wanted to debate with
[1:06:49] brother branham sobre Branham stood on
[1:06:51] the podium and they wanted to take
[1:06:53] pictures they wanted to debate with Rob
[1:06:55] ROM but the first picture that they took
[1:06:57] it was blank the second picture was
[1:06:59] blank the third default was blank the
[1:07:03] fifth the sixth was blank at the seventy
[1:07:06] picture I said by the server in the
[1:07:08] picture we are now in the days where
[1:07:10] people like to take selfies so God came
[1:07:13] to take a selfie with his own profit I
[1:07:15] wish I was preaching in Minnesota I said
[1:07:18] God came in to take a selfie with his
[1:07:20] own profit don't play with that thing
[1:07:22] brother that is what permits when he
[1:07:25] said who are you lord and he said I am
[1:07:27] Lord Jesus whom thou persecute now the
[1:07:30] promises were made to Abraham and his
[1:07:32] seed I feel like preaching now the
[1:07:35] promises were made to Abraham and his
[1:07:37] seed animal baptized in Christ is
[1:07:39] Abraham's seed Abraham is the father of
[1:07:42] many nations Abraham is the father of
[1:07:44] all them that believe so Abraham has got
[1:07:47] H am pranam has got H a.m. seven letters
[1:07:50] which means he's the father of many
[1:07:51] nations cuz I promised children in
[1:07:54] America Ron amazed children in Zimbabwe
[1:07:57] Panama's children in South Africa
[1:07:59] promised to turn in New Zealand he is
[1:08:01] also a father of many nations who was
[1:08:04] showing him a vision when his children
[1:08:06] were marching onward Christian soldiers
[1:08:08] and he said stay in line stay in line
[1:08:11] and they reach to a certain place where
[1:08:13] they begin to break the law of gravity
[1:08:15] and they were taken up in the heavens
[1:08:17] all those who rejected brother ministry
[1:08:20] they were going down in the hell so we
[1:08:22] see these seven messengers from Porto
[1:08:24] brother branham they all went to heaven
[1:08:26] by the way of the grave as greatest poor
[1:08:29] ones as great as brother Branham was
[1:08:30] they went to heaven by the way of the
[1:08:32] grave but we were alive and remain
[1:08:35] until the coming of the Lord we shall
[1:08:38] not all sleep but we shall be changed in
[1:08:41] a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's
[1:08:43] the promise hallelujah we've got a

[1:09:23] hit him then the snake was generous to
[1:09:25] him because when it hit him here he just
[1:09:27] shook it in the fire and this morning
[1:09:30] there is a fire here to shake every
[1:09:33] situation

[1:09:53] in danger today the Prophet is in danger
[1:09:55] today because you are a tailor to your
[1:09:58] dangers
[1:09:59] Alleluia I love this word of God I'm
[1:10:03] reminded when Peter was working going
[1:10:05] passing the beautiful gates get
[1:10:07] beautiful he saw a beggar day he was
[1:10:10] asking for money and the Prophet says
[1:10:12] Jesus said fast there's many at times
[1:10:15] but he says he did not attend to this
[1:10:17] person because he knew that they say
[1:10:19] people there was a people who is who was
[1:10:23] coming Alleluia so Peter Peter said you
[1:10:26] know silver and gold have I none because
[1:10:29] he had received power I got my god he
[1:10:33] said silver and gold a finance such as I
[1:10:35] have I give it unto you Peter didn't say

[1:10:39] gonna call me tomorrow it is say give me
[1:10:42] your phone number or I'll bring you
[1:10:44] spoken word book he didn't say that we
[1:10:46] have this spoken word power
[1:10:48] after receiving the Holocaust you had
[1:10:50] attained po power he said rise up and
[1:10:52] work because there was a people always
[1:10:54] coming hallelujah woo I love this word
[1:10:58] of God this gospel was being preached
[1:11:01] and ministering to the needs of the
[1:11:03] people present tense you know that Jesus
[1:11:05] had dominion over cooked fish this is a
[1:11:08] dominant overcooked bread he could
[1:11:10] multiply it he could say one I can make
[1:11:13] it to two I can make it four oh I could
[1:11:15] make it eight I could multiply whatever
[1:11:17] is put in my hands hallelujah I don't
[1:11:20] have to accept that is one for one bread
[1:11:22] this is two fishes I can multiply it
[1:11:24] whenever I want
[1:11:25] one time they brought a crippled friend
[1:11:29] and
[1:11:31] this friend what happened was you know
[1:11:34] he was he was he was crippled and this
[1:11:36] friend said no these four brothers said
[1:11:38] no we love our friends so they took this
[1:11:40] brother they had Jesuses around and when
[1:11:43] Jesus is around something has got to
[1:11:45] happen Jesus is not a quiet man it's
[1:11:48] either he's raising someone from the
[1:11:49] grave he's opening someone's eyes but
[1:11:52] they had Jesuses and when Jesus is is
[1:11:54] already here today you are not going
[1:11:57] home the same way you came today if you
[1:11:59] come sick you are going home delivered
[1:12:01] Jesus is here but the head Jesus is the
[1:12:04] town so they went and they said the room
[1:12:07] was full it was packed they could enter
[1:12:10] by the door what did they do they went
[1:12:12] and they put a ladder they start
[1:12:13] climbing on the roof they start walking
[1:12:16] on the roof they said what's the plan
[1:12:17] they say let's tear the roof they knew
[1:12:19] that Jesus is a kapenta he's going to
[1:12:21] fix that later
[1:12:24] Jesus seeing the kind of faith they saw
[1:12:28] even this brother who was on a stretch I
[1:12:30] had to help faith think these brothers
[1:12:32] coming him and they put him down and
[1:12:35] Jesus said what do I do for this kind of
[1:12:38] faith and there's another kind of faith
[1:12:40] that provokes God you know that's the
[1:12:43] kind of faith that I like I don't like
[1:12:45] ordinary ordinary things I believe in
[1:12:48] extra extra extra ordinary and Jesus
[1:12:51] saying he said what should I do for this
[1:12:53] world should i free you should i what
[1:12:55] should I do because I can do what I can
[1:12:57] I can forgive you all your sins I can I
[1:13:00] can make you work hallelujah even when
[1:13:03] you came here Paul he can free you this
[1:13:05] morning and
[1:13:06] the brother was helped hallelujah I love
[1:13:10] this word of God so I remember when the
[1:13:14] Prophet went into the sixth dimension he
[1:13:16] went to this dimension he they were
[1:13:18] believers in those days when he reached
[1:13:20] there the brothers they came embracing
[1:13:22] him our precious brother god bless you
[1:13:25] our precious brother and you know Brian
[1:13:27] I wanted to see God these brothers these
[1:13:31] Saints he said I want to see God he says
[1:13:33] no we are actually waiting he's in the
[1:13:36] seventh dimension but we are waiting for
[1:13:37] you to present us to him Robert says
[1:13:41] will pour do the same I said certainly
[1:13:42] will Peter do the same letter
[1:13:45] he said okay so if horse group ends up
[1:13:48] mine will enter because I preach what
[1:13:51] Paul preached I please what Peter
[1:13:53] preached and the Saints we had going
[1:13:55] upward with one voice and said on this
[1:13:58] we are resting
[1:14:00] we are still resting upon these coats
[1:14:03] William Branham died nine 16 1965 but we
[1:14:06] are still resting upon this Word of God
[1:14:08] we are still resting upon these coats
[1:14:10] that's why I'm not even scared brother
[1:14:12] even if the devil tries to send this
[1:14:14] demon this morning it's nothing to the
[1:14:16] church because when the weakest of
[1:14:19] Christians begins to pray not the
[1:14:21] strongest not dishonest when the weakest
[1:14:24] of Christians begins to pray there's
[1:14:27] confusion in Hell as you are sitting
[1:14:29] there saying hallelujah amen that is
[1:14:32] what Paul and Silas were doing when they
[1:14:34] were in the prison and all the channels
[1:14:35] started breaking as you were saying
[1:14:38] hallelujah amen all sickness is breaking
[1:14:40] up rocky streets are breaking all
[1:14:43] sickness is breaking where the preaching
[1:14:45] of the word it casts out demons all
[1:14:47] things are possible we have to
[1:14:49] personalize this service you might be
[1:14:51] like Hannah Hannah was barren you might
[1:14:53] be spiritually barren but I want to tell
[1:14:55] you this morning God breaks tar Baroness
[1:14:57] the Church of God humiliates the devil
[1:15:00] you have to put your situation in the
[1:15:02] word you see some people know their
[1:15:03] problem more than they know their God
[1:15:05] there are your problem about your God
[1:15:07] that my God is bigger than my mountains
[1:15:11] the Word of God has got creative power
[1:15:13] as I am preaching like this we can
[1:15:16] create something in your life I was
[1:15:18] preaching in Congo there was a sister
[1:15:20] with a kidney problem it was a wife of a
[1:15:22] doctor that see that doctors only treat
[1:15:25] but it is God that Hughes he said I am
[1:15:27] the lord that healeth all thy diseases
[1:15:29] he is the great doctor that I've ever
[1:15:32] seen and he's here in the building so
[1:15:35] when I was preaching the way I'm
[1:15:37] preaching and she received a healing
[1:15:39] instantly the Word of God has got a
[1:15:41] creative power as I am preaching like
[1:15:44] this God is healing you right now we can
[1:15:47] creative in your own job if you don't
[1:15:49] have a job where the power to create
[1:15:51] your Morocco is not even far away
[1:15:53] brother it is right near where you are
[1:15:56] if you only believe things are possible
[1:15:58] that's it I Know Who I am
[1:16:01] I Know Who I am I walk in power I walk
[1:16:05] in miracles I live a life for favor
[1:16:07] because I Know Who I am when Mars is so
[1:16:10] far and Egyptians coming they didn't get
[1:16:12] afraid just that these Egyptians you see
[1:16:14] from today you shall see them no more
[1:16:17] this sickness that you came with today I
[1:16:19] want to tell you that from today you
[1:16:21] shall see it no more Moses was not
[1:16:24] kidding a boy in an Arab but he was
[1:16:26] caring fast says the Lord we come with
[1:16:28] verses the lot this morning that's why I
[1:16:30] want to say bye-bye Satan bye-bye
[1:16:33] unbelief bye bye from generational cases
[1:16:36] bye-bye evil spirits we the Church of
[1:16:38] God is moving on I believe in
[1:16:41] deliverance because whatsoever the Sun
[1:16:43] sets free is free indeed if you came
[1:16:46] with the situation you I'm not going
[1:16:48] home the same way you came I feel like
[1:16:51] many forces are resisting what I'm
[1:16:52] saying right now but that is what I
[1:16:54] normally enjoy when I travel that's when
[1:16:56] we see the captain of the walls coming
[1:16:58] down because we don't come with our own
[1:17:00] power brother the one who sent us is
[1:17:02] able to perform if you need the Holy
[1:17:05] Ghost may receive the Holy Ghost in the
[1:17:06] name of Jesus Alleluia from today your
[1:17:09] tests shall become a testimony no matter
[1:17:12] what your pulse is you I'm speaking your
[1:17:14] job in your existence you know we are in
[1:17:16] the heavenly grocery store if you go to
[1:17:18] all much you can choose to buy just a
[1:17:20] few things you know just a few things
[1:17:22] it's not you meal it's just a few things
[1:17:24] well myself when I come into the house
[1:17:26] of the Lord I come with the trolleys
[1:17:27] full brother because every promise that
[1:17:31] is written in the book is mine every
[1:17:33] chapter every verse every line it's mine
[1:17:36] hallelujah well
[1:17:39] we stand on a promise then what we bind
[1:17:42] here on earth is found in heaven if you
[1:17:45] believe where you are you can receive it
[1:17:47] where you are there's an unseen hand
[1:17:49] what can touch you wherever you are you
[1:17:51] see this - in technology there are
[1:17:54] lights that are voice controlled you can
[1:17:56] say lights on they switch on when you
[1:17:59] say lights of they switch off but they
[1:18:01] only know your voice if but I see who
[1:18:04] comes and say lights on they don't
[1:18:05] switch on because they only know his
[1:18:07] voice so your situation hears your voice
[1:18:09] it's you I've got to speak say no no no
[1:18:13] not in my territory not in heaven
[1:18:17] because we are seated in heavenly places
[1:18:18] I want to draw a line to the devil that
[1:18:21] he can't cross that's like what happened
[1:18:23] in Goshen the question was in Egypt but
[1:18:25] Egypt was not in Goshen what put your
[1:18:28] spiritual boundary what was respected by
[1:18:30] frogs even the locusts they couldn't fly
[1:18:33] to the other side they knew that the
[1:18:35] people from this side are different from
[1:18:36] the other people from the other side
[1:18:37] there must be a difference between a
[1:18:40] message believer in an unbeliever
[1:18:41] because if my people who are called by
[1:18:44] my name shall humble themselves you
[1:18:47] shall speak to any mountain and when you
[1:18:49] speak that word will flash like
[1:18:51] lightning before the drop that touches
[1:18:53] you over the Great Physician is here I
[1:18:55] sent you home and the Great Physician is
[1:18:57] here in the tales of Luther they used to
[1:18:59] say he's coming in the days of Wesley
[1:19:01] the days of Pentecost they used to say
[1:19:03] he's coming but us here today we are
[1:19:05] saying he's here right now I said he's
[1:19:07] here right now he's not too busy he's
[1:19:10] able to change your situation I want to
[1:19:13] join all these gentlemen that was said
[1:19:15] by man of God who came by this poop if
[1:19:16] the man of God came and said you receive
[1:19:18] your healing you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:19] you receive I'm training all these
[1:19:22] statements and I want to release it to
[1:19:24] you I believe there's going to be an
[1:19:25] explosion because we are not going to
[1:19:28] heaven by running away from sickness we
[1:19:30] are not going to heaven by running away
[1:19:32] from poverty we are not going to heaven
[1:19:34] by running away from depression heaven
[1:19:36] is not a refugee camp for cowards it's a
[1:19:39] rest haven for Eagles we must overcome
[1:19:42] we must overcome pornography we must all
[1:19:45] become spirits of this world so by faith
[1:19:47] we shall overcome give God a shout of
[1:19:50] praise
[1:19:56] the bride knows who she is and what
[1:19:59] she's raised up for so that she could do
[1:20:01] the great awakes hallelujah let us go to
[1:20:05] Christ is reviewed on wait
[1:20:13] some people think that heaven is a very
[1:20:16] far place when we were growing up were
[1:20:18] told heaven is very far a problem says
[1:20:22] you're got to find out one of these days
[1:20:24] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[1:20:26] off somewhere else you are still right
[1:20:29] here
[1:20:31] just in another time mention faster than
[1:20:34] this next slide
[1:20:37] and redemption is two different parts
[1:20:40] come out and entering into first you
[1:20:44] have to come out some people want to
[1:20:46] bring on the world with them but you've
[1:20:49] got to come out of the world to enter
[1:20:52] into Christ you have to come out of
[1:20:54] unbelief and enter into faith
[1:20:58] there cannot be one thing in your way
[1:21:01] who really have sorry to really have
[1:21:05] genuine faith you must absolutely leave
[1:21:08] everything that's contrary to the Word
[1:21:10] of God
[1:21:12] behind to enter into your face
[1:21:16] let's check out this
[1:21:20] thank you
[1:21:24] so the Bible aware of God and the
[1:21:28] message of the hour is the will of God
[1:21:29] you didn't hear me the Bible is the Word
[1:21:33] of God and the message of the hour is
[1:21:35] the will of God there are times when the
[1:21:38] Word of God is not the will of God in
[1:21:40] the time of Noah it was the Word of God
[1:21:43] to build an ark and it was the will of
[1:21:46] God for that particular time but today
[1:21:48] is still the Word of God but it's no
[1:21:51] longer the will of God so if you come
[1:21:53] with you can show me the face and say no
[1:21:55] it's the Word of God we should build an
[1:21:57] IKE but if you put if you make it today
[1:22:00] that it's no longer the will of God
[1:22:02] because God promised a rainbow came and
[1:22:06] said I will not destroy the earth again
[1:22:07] with a flood so your eye could be
[1:22:10] useless
[1:22:13] now we see seven messengers in groups of
[1:22:16] over comas they're in their terrorists
[1:22:20] 37 messages in the comas terrestrial
[1:22:23] bodies are in the tomb they're in their
[1:22:26] celestial bodies that your Fannie's and
[1:22:28] at the last tram the Prophet says they
[1:22:30] will come in Ian's pick up their bodies
[1:22:34] do funny plus resurrection board is
[1:22:36] equals to Laura fight body let's go to
[1:22:40] the next slide days but if we are
[1:22:42] Christians we ought to be kindly
[1:22:45] notified ahead
[1:22:46] see we don't just live an ordinary life
[1:22:49] we don't just live a life that that we
[1:22:54] don't know what's happening but he says
[1:22:55] but if we are Christians I think we all

[1:24:46] excuse she became Rahab and insist of
[1:24:48] Christ
[1:24:50] Mary Magdalene he was possessed of seven
[1:24:54] demons he didn't have an excuse but she
[1:24:56] was the first one to see the
[1:24:58] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:59] even the tip at the cross didn't have an
[1:25:02] excuse he was the first one to be the
[1:25:04] beneficiary of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:06] so we ain't a new stat Center this

[1:25:13] the Holy Ghost in your family may you be
[1:25:15] the first one
[1:25:16] for lumba went to a barren land but he
[1:25:19] didn't have an excuse there was
[1:25:21] fruitfulness there age is not an excuse
[1:25:24] Josiah started at 8 years old we have a
[1:25:27] cyst and our church who got married at
[1:25:28] 35 years old though age is not an excuse

[1:25:34] excuse but she became Esther the Queen
[1:25:36] even if you came as a newcomer this

[1:25:54] receive the Holy Ghost even Peter the
[1:25:56] betrayer he didn't have an excuse it was
[1:25:58] also part of the one trend who received
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost evenly John the demoniac
[1:26:02] didn't have an excuse I believe he was
[1:26:04] part of the 120 who received the Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost no you don't even excuse my
[1:26:08] brother now let's get into the mystery
[1:26:11] of the loved ones and the resurrection
[1:26:13] can you give me 15 more minutes
[1:26:17] all right now want to speak about the
[1:26:21] mystery of our loved ones in the
[1:26:23] resurrection
[1:26:24] when Jesus rose from the grave who was
[1:26:27] the first one to see him Mary Magdalene
[1:26:31] another Mary alone me who really loved
[1:26:35] Jesus
[1:26:36] where Jesus was going with Mary and all
[1:26:39] these women they were following it come
[1:26:41] to the grave early in the morning to
[1:26:43] spice up the body of Jesus Christ pause
[1:26:45] way he's real friends cause we're his
[1:26:47] loved one and the cross everyone every
[1:26:50] disciples everyone had ran away except
[1:26:53] these women and born so they were duly
[1:26:55] last ones to who were to the end when
[1:26:59] Jesus first appeared from the grave he
[1:27:01] didn't appear to Thomas because he was a
[1:27:03] doubter he appeared to the Pharisees the
[1:27:06] first ones to test with the real ones
[1:27:09] who really loved him as he rolls up his
[1:27:12] these
[1:27:14] people at first so wherever there is a
[1:27:17] resurrection a mystery of love now who
[1:27:20] was the other one who loved him the
[1:27:22] James and John and those were also one
[1:27:26] of the ill ones who or him now remember
[1:27:29] when Elijah was going to be raptured who
[1:27:31] was around him Elijah let's let's
[1:27:34] cooperate that was Elijah right now when
[1:27:37] he said I'm going go Dan so he said
[1:27:41] Elijah stay here then Elijah said no go
[1:27:44] together we'll cross Jordan together and
[1:27:46] Elijah opened it by the power of God and
[1:27:48] they cross over but when they cross over
[1:27:50] and I just said to Elijah you have been
[1:27:52] a real friend of you've been a dear
[1:27:55] friend now that I am going ask what you
[1:27:58] will and I will and
[1:28:03] right clap your hands which
[1:28:08] now I want you to catch this
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:13] Elijah said now that I am going I wanted
[1:28:17] to ask what you will
[1:28:18] now as you have been a real friend and
[1:28:22] you know what Elijah says says I want
[1:28:24] the taboo pushing of your spirit bro you
[1:28:28] have asked for a hard thing but if you
[1:28:31] see me go in other words if you see me
[1:28:34] go in my rapture in other words if you
[1:28:37] see me go in my resurrection the power
[1:28:39] on me who come upon you there is a
[1:28:42] mystery day when you see the power of
[1:28:45] God work on another believer that same
[1:28:47] power will come upon you
[1:28:50] so
[1:28:51] the Bible says the dead in Christ shall
[1:28:54] rise first what raises them the voice
[1:28:57] what are you hearing the shout what to
[1:29:00] take us to heaven the dead and the
[1:29:02] living the trumpet all these three
[1:29:04] things are in the Xu's now
[1:29:07] the same voice that said Lazarus come
[1:29:10] forth it's the same voice of Christ
[1:29:11] that's the one that you hear now but we
[1:29:14] will all be this body the prophet says
[1:29:17] the rapture would take about forty days
[1:29:21] because when Jesus rose from the dead he
[1:29:23] woke on it for forty days fellowshipping
[1:29:27] with his loved ones so when those who
[1:29:29] died in Christ when they come and pick
[1:29:31] their bodies they don't go to heaven
[1:29:33] straight now pick their bodies and
[1:29:36] they'll appear to you to the loved ones
[1:29:38] so maybe you are seated in your house
[1:29:41] he's catching it maybe you are sitting
[1:29:43] in your house you just strange face you
[1:29:46] just appear to you you just say ah this
[1:29:49] is my brother but at a young age around
[1:29:51] 19 you say this is this present the
[1:29:53] moment they see you you see them
[1:29:55] immediately your quickened
[1:29:58] they know where you are they come in a
[1:30:01] body that's called glorified body that's
[1:30:04] somebody that can go through the world
[1:30:06] they don't have to knock at your door
[1:30:07] they can get through the world that's
[1:30:10] somebody when Jesus came my god when
[1:30:12] Jesus came he just appeared in the room
[1:30:15] and he said Shalom so they'll appear in
[1:30:18] that kind of a body and when you see
[1:30:20] them they see you immediately
[1:30:22] you are quickened so this is the season
[1:30:26] for the rapture this is the season of
[1:30:28] love so remember the day Elijah got
[1:30:32] raptured particular day he visited his
[1:30:35] loved one code Elijah so when they went
[1:30:38] together and Elijah good raptured now
[1:30:40] and Elijah saw it so rupturing power
[1:30:42] came in him I wanted to catch this so
[1:30:45] when he went to Jordan the first miracle
[1:30:47] of the last miracle of Elijah was the
[1:30:50] first miracle of Elijah
[1:30:52] so we see
[1:30:54] in the book in the in adoption the
[1:30:57] prophet also says that he says in red eg
[1:31:00] adoption chapter 2 he says for if we
[1:31:03] believe that Christ died and rose again
[1:31:04] the third day even so those who are
[1:31:07] sleeping Christ will God bring with him
[1:31:10] Oh with what we say this unto you by the
[1:31:13] commandment of the Lord not which were
[1:31:15] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[1:31:17] Lord shall not prevent or hinder that's
[1:31:20] the best word given that those which are
[1:31:21] asleep for the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:31:23] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:31:25] first and which were alive and remain
[1:31:28] shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:31:30] twinkling of an eye and shall be caught
[1:31:31] up together with them and meet the Lord
[1:31:33] in the air so the dead in Christ will
[1:31:36] rise first I said when you see them they
[1:31:38] see you immediately you are quickened
[1:31:41] but the rapture or the resurrection is
[1:31:44] the mystery of love so remember when
[1:31:47] Lazarus for him to raise up for Lazarus
[1:31:50] rise up was up around a they had to
[1:31:54] Kamata had to be day and Mary because
[1:31:56] those were his loved ones but the
[1:31:59] rapture happens in a midst of the loved
[1:32:01] ones remember when brother buzz within
[1:32:03] brother branham their head contact
[1:32:05] proposed with was in South Africa and
[1:32:07] Branham was driving up in up hill and
[1:32:10] God showed him a vision and he says for
[1:32:13] almost 30 minutes he was driving it
[1:32:15] means that God was driving that car
[1:32:17] because that appreciate twisting and
[1:32:20] turning and he broke into a vision but
[1:32:22] the Kyle kept on moving
[1:32:24] yummy
[1:32:27] no problem was driving he broke into a
[1:32:30] vision the angel of the Lord said pray
[1:32:31] for your friend in South Africa what
[1:32:35] knows no distance
[1:32:36] the angels came to brahmana immediately
[1:32:39] pray for your friend because he's your
[1:32:41] loved one he has fallen from the Train
[1:32:43] and you know what Robin I'm said Robin I
[1:32:46] prayed for him and from there
[1:32:48] immediately
[1:32:50] Bosworth was huge because when the
[1:32:52] Telegraph came later he asked her what
[1:32:54] time did you pray for me says during
[1:32:56] that time
[1:32:57] the the supernatural happens where their
[1:33:00] loved ones involved remember when Jana's
[1:33:03] daughter died who was caught into the
[1:33:05] room Jesus did there were a lot of
[1:33:07] people around that room Jesus keep them
[1:33:10] out he says Judas out he says Thomas out
[1:33:15] and decode to Peter James and John his
[1:33:18] loved ones and the father in the mother
[1:33:20] in that atmosphere of love there was a
[1:33:22] resurrection
[1:33:23] but the rapture the resurrection happens
[1:33:26] when they our loved ones involved when
[1:33:28] Jesus was to be raptured whom did he
[1:33:30] code to call the witness of his
[1:33:32] resurrection he quote he didn't Co he
[1:33:35] wrote because he was not a loved one he
[1:33:36] didn't call the Pharisees they were not
[1:33:38] the loved ones he called his eleven
[1:33:40] disciples because Judas died and he said
[1:33:43] come they went to mount Olive's and in
[1:33:46] that atmosphere of his loved ones he
[1:33:48] said bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye and
[1:33:51] immediately they were raptured amen so
[1:33:54] let's stay in love and love one another
[1:33:57] so like I said for 40 days we'll be
[1:33:59] seeing our loved ones and after 40 days
[1:34:01] all of us who go to heaven and who meet
[1:34:05] Christ in the air but here on this earth
[1:34:07] Dobie i'ma go off Armageddon there'll be
[1:34:10] tribulation there will be great
[1:34:12] earthquakes but in heaven there's a love
[1:34:14] story he's in a honeymoon for three and
[1:34:16] half years the Bible is a love story
[1:34:19] this the bride and the bridegroom hope
[1:34:22] in love so this is this season our
[1:34:24] bodies will be changed in a twinkling of
[1:34:27] an eye that's why I can rejoice and say
[1:34:29] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:34:32] now when brother Branham was hunting he
[1:34:35] got into the bush he was hunting he got
[1:34:38] into the bush God came as a friend to
[1:34:41] brother Branham if you don't have a
[1:34:43] friend what becomes your friend when
[1:34:45] Enoch walked with God God was his loved
[1:34:48] one
[1:34:49] that's why he was not the bra Branham
[1:34:52] was in the in the in the bush God
[1:34:55] appeared to brother branham in as him
[1:34:58] would you want to walk with me in
[1:35:00] brother Branham says sure
[1:35:02] certainly that would be a great
[1:35:04] privilege for me and
[1:35:06] immediately you know what what happened
[1:35:10] Rob Roblin was not an old man he started
[1:35:13] feeling young again he looked at these
[1:35:16] wrinkles in the skin he found that he
[1:35:17] was a young man again what was happening
[1:35:20] let me tell you something before an
[1:35:22] aeroplane starts off those ones who have
[1:35:24] used an aeroplane before an airplane
[1:35:26] takes off what happens they revved the
[1:35:28] engines first they say
[1:35:32] when is two on the ground why do they
[1:35:35] rev the engines because they want to see
[1:35:37] if the engine has got power to maneuver
[1:35:39] in the air so what was God doing what
[1:35:43] was testing rupturing power to brother
[1:35:46] Branham so when he saw that it worked on
[1:35:49] brother Branham he knew that it work on
[1:35:51] his followers
[1:35:53] so with brother branham he started
[1:35:55] feeling young again he looked at his
[1:35:57] skin where drink with you he's not a
[1:35:59] young man again is just feeling the
[1:36:00] energy here he had lost his hair it ties
[1:36:03] here he found here came and crew again
[1:36:06] he became ruptured
[1:36:08] quad tail was testing rupturing power
[1:36:11] and getting and immediately got reversed
[1:36:15] the power and problem says God why
[1:36:17] didn't you leave me like this and God
[1:36:19] says no Branham when it's not yet time
[1:36:22] heaven was happy at quickening power can
[1:36:25] wake because if it could work on brother
[1:36:27] branham it would work on his followers
[1:36:29] well you've got a shout of praise
[1:36:37] this message is good power it can change
[1:36:40] your boarding so one time he was
[1:36:42] involved in an accident and they took
[1:36:44] him to Amarillo hospital now everyone
[1:36:48] there's a picture of his accident day
[1:36:49] everyone who was in that hospital after
[1:36:52] the accident the moment he entered
[1:36:56] into the hospital everyone was touched
[1:36:59] why because picketing power was already
[1:37:03] in the bones of brother Branham
[1:37:04] quickening power even if you die it
[1:37:07] remains in your bones I'm gonna prove it
[1:37:09] in a minute it remains in your bones
[1:37:12] right no when he got into the now
[1:37:15] problem it got into the hospital when he
[1:37:18] got into the hospital the moment he
[1:37:20] enters there because he had that
[1:37:22] experience so what happened was everyone
[1:37:25] goes discharged because the atmosphere
[1:37:27] was just too much
[1:37:30] so he had broken bones and
[1:37:33] when they were burying him they said the
[1:37:36] doctors checked the bones of brother
[1:37:38] branham and they found out that is the
[1:37:39] bones which were broken got back
[1:37:41] together
[1:37:43] quickening power
[1:37:45] and after that they also said that his
[1:37:48] face brother Tom Brown said his face he
[1:37:51] was an odd man when he died but when he
[1:37:53] was being buried he became a young man
[1:37:54] again I wish I was preaching to somebody
[1:37:57] who can understand what I'm saying here
[1:37:59] quickening power
[1:38:01] if it could work on problem it can wake
[1:38:04] up on you remember Elijah saw Elijah
[1:38:08] Elijah saw Elijah going so that power
[1:38:11] came inside of him one time there was a
[1:38:13] war Elijah he died so they put him in
[1:38:16] the grave my god I feel the anointing
[1:38:18] now they put him in the grave and there
[1:38:20] was a brother though he was not a
[1:38:22] product while he was not a message
[1:38:24] believer you are just an ordinary
[1:38:25] soldier they took this soldier and threw
[1:38:28] him can you give me can you show me they
[1:38:29] threw him on Elijah's bones when they
[1:38:32] just threw him on Elijah's bones there
[1:38:34] was picketing power
[1:38:37] it's Elijah's book you see this surge I
[1:38:39] had died
[1:38:41] and so Joe's dead they just threw him
[1:38:43] they is they just threw him on dead
[1:38:46] bones what does bonded quickening power
[1:38:48] the soldier jumped and started working
[1:38:51] our King
[1:38:54] this message is called power it can
[1:38:57] change your body it can change your
[1:39:00] situation
[1:39:01] one time there was a brother Donovan
[1:39:04] wits Rob Onam went to him here the

[1:39:32] your port it can take away all sickness
[1:39:34] that you have this message is power even
[1:39:38] in this room there is power
[1:39:40] Alleluia I'm being reminded of one you

[1:39:50] about to close now Aunt Jemima she
[1:39:52] prayed to God she said I want God to
[1:39:55] touch my life
[1:39:56] so she prayed to God
[1:40:00] okay before I talk of Aunt Jemima I'm
[1:40:02] about to finish now before we were
[1:40:05] created men were congregation in the
[1:40:07] mind of God when we were created God was
[1:40:11] now congregation so what happened was in
[1:40:14] the Garden of Eden God who come in the
[1:40:15] cool of the day he was not coming to
[1:40:17] preach God was coming to sit down where
[1:40:20] you are sitting and his son Adam who
[1:40:22] stood on a puppet and said in the
[1:40:24] morning I saw an animal with big ears
[1:40:27] and a long trunk and I caught it
[1:40:29] elephant and God sitting there you would
[1:40:31] say I mean I mean that's right he said
[1:40:34] in the morning I saw Eva you roof rats
[1:40:37] flowing like this and I told you to stop
[1:40:39] and God sitting there you say amen amen
[1:40:41] that's right problem says we are back
[1:40:44] now where God is congregation where men
[1:40:46] shall speak and God shall pick it up
[1:40:50] and did your mama pray to God she wanted
[1:40:52] God to touch her life and to change to
