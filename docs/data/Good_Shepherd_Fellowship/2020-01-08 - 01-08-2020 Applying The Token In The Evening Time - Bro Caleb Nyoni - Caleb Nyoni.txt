together in concert Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ Christ blessed be the God and the father Jesus Christ let's repeat that verse blessed be God the Father follow Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus let us go to Exodus chapter number 12 we're gonna read verse 3 and 13 Exodus chapter 12 verse 3 to 13 let's read together in concert speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man according to their house their fathers and the lab for a house let's go to West 18 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smiled the land of Egypt let us go to Genesis chapter number 22 one more scripture to go or to Genesis chapter number 22 we go to this seven and eight and eyes expect unto Abraham let's work together his father and said My father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire in the world but where is the lamb for a burnt offering verse eight and Abraham saying my son go to provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they built on up together John chapter number 1 verse 29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world common scripture Revelation chapter number five this one two five and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sued with seven seals let's wait together raise two to five and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the silver and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book know that to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the other said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof may God bless the reading of the word shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this wonderful time we have come o mighty God with our hearts open we actively father that you speak to us O God I must decrease you must increase I asked Heavenly Father o my speak to your children this evening in Jesus name we pray amen you may take your seats while I remain standing don't sit on your mouth I want to hear that Amen that hallelujah how many remember me how many remember me Wow like 80 percent or something like that very happy to be back to this church and I want to appreciate the pastor who has given me the opportunity to minister it to you on this very day understand it was a prayer meeting but I believe that God for ordained this day before the foundation of the world and he knew that I was going to minister and speak to you I wasn't supposed to be here tonight because yesterday was my birthday I was supposed to celebrate my birthday back home thank you I'm also accepting gifts just words but the kingdom of God is not in word only but it's in power in demonstration okay so I detect the pastor forgive me this opportunity and to those who I hear I say God bless you so much I want you to greet the brother next to you and say god bless you you're looking good looking good you're looking good one thing that I like go up a bit one thing I like about this church is I can preach from 1947 to 1965 and this church you say I'm into the world because what has brought us together is the message what to separate us is the message what will keep us together is the message so if you want to make me happy give me the message this is not a Pentecostal Church this is a gathering of eagles Who am I I'm a son of God where the caucus is there will the eagle's be gathered that's why problem says you are not feeding on me but you are feeding on the unfailing body weight of this son of man now I'm going to preach on the message code applying the talking in this evening time can you say that can you say that Amen now before we start God did not put us here on earth without a purpose there is a reason and a purpose to why we are here even as we don't just do things without a reason there must be a reason to everything you are here not by mistake good for ordained you before the foundation of the world now according to the natural laws there are many gems which could have made it when probably we understand science like they're their gems which we're trying to fight you know to make it but some of them died right there but your gem your sperm only made it through that's reason why you are here and we see that it was not by accident there are so many would-be siblings of yours who did not make it but you made it to come here on earth so I believe in predestination and I want you to know that we are destined ated there is going to be a bride come on shout amen can I hear better amen there is going to be a bride and they will be a bride I don't care what's going on around the message I don't care of those people who are cold or backslidden or too formal but I believe there is going to be a bride I am thankful this evening that I am one of them I am one of them if there are only 1000 members chosen bride members I believe that I'll be one of them if there are only 500 chosen members who are going to make it to the rupture I will be right one of them if there are only hundreds who are going to make it I will be one of them let me trim it down a little bit if they are only 50 who are going to make it I will be one of them if they are only three who are going to make it I want you to know that I will be one of them if there is only one who's going to make it I'm sorry about all of you I will be one of them that's how you're supposed to see it the scripture says blessed be the God of the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places right where you are I want to tell you that you are blessed it might not look like you are blessed but you are blessed the Bible says he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places our God is rich in mercy our God is rich in Graces and our God is rich in love yes blessed us with all spiritual blessings so if the Bible says you are blessed then you are blessed shout I am blessed shut I am blessed whether the devil likes it or not I am blessed whether my neighbor doesn't like it or not I am blessed you are blessed we are blessed and the bride is blessed don't look sad and look and look for pity you are the bride of Jesus Christ you are plain someone shot I am blessed you must wear a smile on your face and shout I am pleased because God is shining upon you I don't care how sick you are but you are blessed I don't care how many problems that you have but you are blessed if you are blessed receive your blessing I want my blessing I want my healing I want my Holy Ghost baptism now the scripture that we have read in the book of Exodus now we see we are now living in an hour with some are getting tired where some are getting swept away from the message with a lot of things going on and it's bringing discouragement on a lot of people but I do believe that there is so much on the positive side of the message to never allow depression to ever come to us in our lives God has revealed so much he has emptied himself so much in this last day to us I believe the brighter side is too bright that we can almost see the black spots the dev was trying both so we see in the time of Exodus God prepared a lamp for a house it was not one lamp for one family member it was one leg it was one lamp for every house Jesus the lamp of God this sufficient was sufficient for Zacchaeus in his whole house he said this day is salvation come into your house it was what Zacchaeus who repented it was what Zacchaeus who said if I've taken anything to you by false I'll restore it for fold and when the answer came from Jesus he was saved with his whole house it was one Rahab who received the lamp message it was one Rahab who received the messenger it was wondering who received the trap boys but she was given a token where whole house could come in the blood of Jesus who never lose its power to everyone who's in the mind of God who be saved to sin no more it was one Cornelius who had a baton to know Jesus it was one Cornelius who fasted it was one Cornelius who prayed when Peter came his whorehouse could come in it was one Jacob who got convicted it was one Jacob who saw the power of God and he said what can I do to be saved he didn't say what can we do to be saved then Paul says believe that God believed God it that you and your house shall be saved so it's a lamp for a house now your children have been given to you by the word of the Lord that's what the Bible says so God knows that you never be happy as long as your husband is outside God knows that your rejoicing coming to church but your joy will never be full as long as your father is outside so God is giving you a lamp for every house this message is not looking for you alone it's looking for your brother it's looking for your sister it's looking for your father it's looking for your mother it's looking for your children now it Pentecost when the word was preached people were pricked in their hearts not the children but the father's the way they said how can we do what can we do to be saved say so repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit it's for you fathers and your children by the authority of God's Word I want to tell you this evening that I give you your house come on judge I give you your house you must apply the token upon your house apply the token upon your brother apply the token upon your sister apply the token upon your children that's how we are supposed to see it how can I be happy to be ruptured without my wife how can I be happy to be ruptured without my husband so the token is going to draw in power in Genesis 22 Isaac had a question where is the lamp that question went for generations and if in Isaac's grand grand children kept asking where is the lamp Moses gave them limbs to sacrifice Moses ordained the sacrificial lambs but still that was never satisfactory then in Chapter number 1 and 29 of the poem of Jordan after so many years Jordan sees Jesus he's standing in the River Jordan and sports Jesus the ego eyes of Jordan so Jesus coming and said Behold the lamp behold the token behold the lamp that would take away the sin of the world so John answered Isaac's question in the River Jordan am i communicating so John answered Isaac's question when Abraham answered when Isaac has to say ways the lamp and what did Abraham said he said the Lord Himself not the priest not Moses the Lord Himself in other words the Lord himself shall become the Lamb the Lord Himself who provide another office of himself to take away the the sin of the world so when Jesus came the Prophet eyes of the Inka John spotted Jesus and said behold they'll talk him and John began to smile in his heart to say this is what I've been telling you about this is what he came to forerun you know my coming then the church ages came through then the lamb disappeared from the scene it disappeared from the physical scene then at the time of the opening of this news in Revelation chapter 5 the question was asked who is worthy to open the book or to look at the book and the Bible says no one was found worthy then the elder says whip not John behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's ready to look at the book he's ready to take the book so don't look for the liar but he never saw the lion he saw the Lamb of God I wish I was preaching in Minneapolis he said behold my God my God my God clap your hands for Jesus so John you say John said all right so he's got to be a lamb before he becomes a lion he must bleed as a lamp before he rose like a liar who of us here ever thought that before you roll like a lion you must bleed at the level then after a while the Lord will lift you up because the way up is down before you come to church you must say I'm a sinner I make the token the left took our place and reviewed the suit so in the book of Exodus the lamb was given the blood they offer a token so when Isaac brought his question I promise anta was manifested on the River Jordan John answered Isaac's question so now at the time of the seven seals which is this day the book of redemption is reviewed again by the lamp the identification of the lamp in this endtime message is the climate of this message that we believe it cannot go beyond the identification of Christ this message cannot advance beyond the opening of the seals I'm preaching to Leonard people today this message cannot advance beyond the opening of this news amen you say men of God what about the rapture that's this opening of the seals that's what the rapture is all about we are not waiting for the manifestation of the rapture the rapture is not a one-day event the rapture is a process you are raptured before your rap chart Enoch was raptured before he was raptured he kept walking with God he was walking with God and he reached a higher dimension I'm no longer operative from America I'm no longer offering from from Africa I'm not operating from the dead poor realm I am in the word and the word is in me I'm in this pocket word and the spoken word is in me I'm in the tech poo and the dead poison me rather I'm in the rapture but the rapture is in me you are already ruptured that's why you are rejoicing that's why you are saying amen because there is something in you that tells you that you're a rupture candidate there is something in you that tells you that you shall be changed before you a change you start rejoicing because there is a substance that is inside of you whoa clap your hands for Jesus so you no longer smoke you no longer drink you no longer do this but if the devil overcomes you the blood is there for you once you confess all your sins God does not remember that you ever did it there are people can't keep coming to God and say God you you keep telling God of the things that you have already confessed before you are wasting your precious time because what is under the that is under the plan and what does not remember brother branham with his gift of discernment if you confess your sim quad was not showing him confess the sins that's how powerful the blood of Jesus is so you are justified you are cleared your case has been dismissed if you accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior you are clean and you are washed by the waters of the world and God does not remember so who is worthy nobody was fought worthy then the lamp came isn't it strange that the lamp took our place in innocent lamp a lamp is a young one of his sheep now if I report here because of time I have 23 minutes to go now if I put the board here the scripture says at that pay you shall know that I am in the father and the father is in me listen listen listen listen if I report here I was going to draw a big circle in our right code on it inside that big step I draw another smaller circle and I'll write Christ on it inside that one I draw another smaller circle and all right brother callipygian here so before the paper touches you you have to go through court get it to Christ before he touches me my God my God my God the devil cannot touch you you are eternally secure a believer has got nothing to worry about we are protected we are surrounded by the Lord Jesus Christ brother sister God is not complete without you God is waiting upon you not devil can touch you you are predestinated your destination is predetermined I am going to heaven because I am supposed to go to heaven I will be raptured because I am meant to be raptured you will overcome at all Terry because you are meant to overcome a totally you will be changed because you are meant to be changed you are loved terrible you are rapture material whoa there's something that happens when I hear about New Jerusalem I hear my tío funny calling don't worry brother you are predestinated unto perfection you are predestinated to overcome American spirits you are predestinated to overcome pornography you are predestinated to overcome fashion you are predestinated to overcome the world the one who overcame is already inside of you but that does not excite me much that is already inside of me I get so much excited that I have been him if Rob the harlot was not destroyed I open up chat oh stop my shout hallelujah someone shout hallelujah someone shot hallelujah when you eat the book the book is already inside of you so you speak like the book but the book speaking inside of you that's why tonight I want to look at the temple with the fairness of faith on my face I don't say by faith I shall be healed that is not our caliber before the foundation of the world I received my healing before the foundation of the world I received my baptism of the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world I received my salvation this is the manifestation only when you see me shouting today I didn't start again tonight I started way back that's why job where were you when the children of God shouted for joy before CATSA was there I was in the mind of God before depression was there I was in the mind of before depression was there I was in the mind of God when Michael stood with when my girls stood with with the Almighty go and hours/day when David foot : I was there when after her foot with cheddar oh my I was there I'm not worried about the 2022 moon because I was there before Lucifer was day I was dead before Lucifer so good taxi devil because I was there Michael I'm on your side I'm on your side the Bible says you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover because when you when you become the talking you are a walking talking on two feet the Bible says you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall be healed in other words you are becoming healing yourself in other words we have pick up the salvation yourself in other words you have become disabled it's not your hand it's the head of Jesus Jesus there's no hand outside of your hand Jesus there's no rapture without you there is no new Jerusalem without you someone shout apply the token someone said I applied the talking come on chase I apply the talking that's why this message has done me so good that's why I can testify to you today that I'm no longer the peasant that I used to be this message has changed me this message has healed me this message has provided all my needs this message is given me hope in the hopeless generation this message is helped me to love my brother and there will not be any other Elijah other than Malachi 4 I always say Elijah worked with Elijah and got a double portion of the anointing what about you you are following Elijah Malachi for all the blessings if you need them you your dog do you receive are you hearing me are you hearing me so this message is changed me right now I'm feeling good I feel like just praising my god I can't appraise him because there is something that is inside of me that say thank you Jesus for sending Malachi for I say thank you Jesus for talking thank you Jesus for the message of the hour I can hey right now I'm feeling something inside of me I can feel it in my hands I can feel it in my toes I can feel it all over me hallelujah I feel like telling liked if it ends I feel like singing like Miriam sang that's what this message is all about and when you you know there are people who are always ignored you know lay hands on me lay hands on me we are a bit acalypha when you speak away when you speak await only believe is the message of the hour spit the weight is the Deadpool why cry speak and go forward if you want healing tonight you are healed the angel of healing is here tonight you have to say Sutton you are finished but we've got the power in the name of Jesus hallelujah may you receive your healing in the name of Jesus may receive your healing in the name of Jesus receive your promotion in the name of Jesus receive your eye sight in the name of Jesus receive your desire the name of Jesus receive it the Holy Ghost UCD the Holy Ghost you have to praise him in the morning you have to praise him in the noon in afternoon you have to praise him in the midnight hour you have to get up with a song get up with a shout because we cannot prize it I can appraise this night I feel like praising him tonight I cannot praise Him and I cannot let it out I gotta praise it you gotta praise Him [Applause] it was of Jericho when they fell it was because of the pricing there were no miss out they you know when you praise God even sugar tap because you just go away there's something in praise this power in Prince says would see Jesus I call you mrs. Jesus he says I in you and you in me that makes you the Hat of God you are inside Jesus the devil is going to be justified yes got to be sanctified and before he touches years already receive the Holy Ghost it is already oh brother do you know who you are you are uncomfortable you it's irreversible this message is our heritage this message is our inheritance the Bible says when to omnipotence meet God is omnipotent you are omnipotent when to only put and submit what happens this miraculous will take place something is fixing to happen tonight the kingdom of God is not in the word only but it's in power in demonstration you know in heaven they singing and shouting that is not preaching up there when you see me preaching like this shouting don't get too angry because if you see me shouting too much here there's no room for you in heaven you got a shout as long as you are here when I get it when I get happy I sing and I shout glory to God glory to God there's power in praise when the prices go up his blessings when the prices go up his blessings come down you know when one time Paul and Silas were in the prison as they began to worship in praise you know what happened the change started breaking and they began to walk out of the prison as you are praising tonight you are going to walk out of your problems you are going to walk out of your sickness the Lord is going to bless you your enemies will flee away cata will run away when you praise God even people we've seen people praising God when they come with with their crutches when they come and start praising God they forget that they've got crutches and they begin to walk I feel the power of God in this place if you want your children to be saved the token is here you must receive the token you must say thank you Jesus for sunset mountain thank you Jesus for the pillar of fire thank you Jesus for the message of the hour the walls of Jericho are falling tonight I don't care how white your problems are but I believe that we are going to be blessed tonight I believe it the devil doesn't believe it but I believe it something is going to happen tonight let me tell you a little story there was a brother you know those who have been in an aeroplane you know you pass through you know they search you I don't know what what you call that where you you need to declare whatever you have you put all your good past by the security that's right so this brother I don't know how he entered with his neck with a bag full of snacks in the plane I don't know what happened but they managed it's got a bag full of snakes they enter into the plane so the plane was around 39,000 feet remember the scripture which says remember like the old serpent we know its job he's the devil right the scripture says when John was - was when John saw the angel he was taught to come up higher right and he says immediately I was in the spirit so when we come into the house of the Lord we must come up higher immediately you should receive your healing immediately you should receive your blessing they got into the plane around 39,000 feet I don't know how if the bag was under the seat I don't know how this this next escaped they started coming out one by one one by one they started coming out and people were so scared screaming just imagine just imagine your your update then these snakes are all over the plane some were speaking in tongues with capital letters someone is screaming and crying if you know what happened the pilot had to communicate with the guys on the operations ground say we have a big problem here there are snakes up here behind the play the operations guy says okay you know what you need to do he says change your operation operating zone come up higher he says go higher you know when they went higher you know what I've been to this next they became powerless there's an altitude that snakes cannot survive so when they went higher business became powerless and they the owner went and even took the snakes and put them back in the bag come up higher come up higher come up higher basic I mention wasted can attacks you visit I mention Weston is powerless come up higher change your operations operation zone plays it time what the message of the our aircraft is going to go higher and the table be bound for 1,000 years do you know the name of the message aircraft it is called the rapture Airlines the visa is the part is about the Holocaust the visa is the talking without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no rapture for you the passport is the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and your ticket is the message of the hour come up higher come up higher Oh scientists they noticed that you know what you don't have to go to to the upper room house might you don't have to go to upper room he says you can create some atmosphere so they realize that the eggs that we have on earth they are not too powerful there they can feed everyone they can feed the whole world so they invented what we call incubators so this incubators they put the eggs there and they produce the same atmosphere and you know what they realized that after a certain time the chicks started coming out so it is about the atmosphere the same atmosphere which was in the upper room if you create that same atmosphere you receive that Holocaust the same atmosphere which was in the time of brother prana is here tonight we can have the same results we can have these seven healings it's about the atmosphere because of time I have a lot that I wanted to do I think I have to come back here let me tell you one more story before I close we all know a frog right we know frogs right now a frog what happens is when it starts when it begins to lay its eggs those little things they look like we call them Ted posed right that thing it doesn't have legs but it's a frog it has got it to you you might not look like a child of God but you are a child of God you might not have the faith to live up certain things but you are a child of God children of God are God's I didn't hear good a min or that it is child of a donkey a donkey a child of a talk is a talk a child of God is God's so in frog is good you know that kid poor it just got a tail it does not have legs but it's a frog you might not have certain things in your life but God loves you so what happens is so that Ted Paul it's not it's a frog it's not your fish but you look like a fish but it's a frog so what happens if it keeps eating if it keeps eating when you come to church brother when you keep eating from the hand of Malachi 4 when you come to church when you keep eating when you keep eating when you keep eating eat the book it's the book something is changing around you something is changing how something is changing something is changing as you keep eating it gets to a stage you know as you are eating the message gossip is disappearing lust is disappearing a daughter is disappearing keep eating from the
