[14:48] you know just in the physical
[14:51] you know it used to be where
[14:54] uh churches
[14:58] hospitals and schools were the most
[15:02] considered community safe place
[15:06] you know they were considered community
[15:09] safe place
[15:10] those places where no gun zone
[15:14] you know no one taught to go with a gun
[15:17] through a church
[15:18] or a hospital or school and
[15:22] and you know we we have had school

[15:30] uh shootings in churches

[49:53] [Music]
[49:56] amen
[49:58] shall we be seated since god bless you
[50:00] musicians
[50:02] [Music]
[50:08] praise be to god
[50:12] you all warmly welcome once again
[50:17] to the house of god
[50:21] as i was seated in the pastor's office
[50:23] and i was thinking
[50:26] just trying to gather myself together a
[50:29] thought just came
[50:30] running through my mind and i said
[50:34] you can never prepare enough
[50:38] it's like if you are given the chance
[50:41] to prepare you always ask for extension
[50:45] of time
[50:48] yeah and i thought just came to my mind
[50:53] uh you may think all soldiers are brave
[50:56] it's not the case and some paratroopers
[51:01] when they are in the air especially when
[51:04] they are training
[51:06] and they are in the air and they are
[51:07] pushing them out
[51:10] it's not easy because they look at the
[51:13] distance
[51:14] probably 20 30 000 feet
[51:17] in the air and they are just trusting
[51:20] that
[51:21] the parachute will deploy
[51:24] and they jump out of the plane and they
[51:27] pull the pin or whatever it is
[51:29] and then the parachute deploys and then
[51:32] they find themselves
[51:34] floating in the air so
[51:37] that is where i find myself tonight
[51:41] praise the lord we are jumping anyhow
[51:46] believing that god will deploy the
[51:48] parachute
[51:50] praise me to god and remember we are
[51:52] jumping together
[51:54] amen so a lot of things
[51:58] were on my mind um
[52:01] last sunday i last two weeks sunday
[52:05] and i was just wondering just going back
[52:08] and forth but as the lord would have it
[52:10] tonight we'll be looking at a sermon
[52:14] the prophet preached and he titled it
[52:17] as i was with moses so
[52:22] will i be with you praise be to god
[52:25] shall we please stand for the original
[52:27] scripture
[52:29] turn with me to joshua 1.
[52:39] joshua 1 we are reading from 1
[52:42] to 5.
[52:47] now after the death of moses the servant
[52:50] of the lord
[52:51] it came to pass that the lord speak
[52:54] unto joshua the son of none
[52:58] moses minister saying moses my servant
[53:02] is dead
[53:03] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[53:08] thou and all these people unto the land
[53:11] which i do give to them even to the
[53:14] children of israel
[53:16] every place that the soul of your foot
[53:19] shall trade upon
[53:20] that have i given unto you as i said
[53:24] unto moses
[53:25] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[53:29] even unto the great river
[53:31] the river euphrates all the land of the
[53:34] hittites
[53:35] and unto the great sea toward the going
[53:38] down of the sun
[53:40] shall be your coast
[53:43] there shall not any man be able to stand
[53:46] before thee
[53:48] all the days of their life as i was with
[53:51] moses
[53:53] so i will be with thee i will not fail
[53:57] thee
[53:58] nor forsake thee if we can either save
[54:01] us
[54:02] be strong and of good courage
[54:06] for unto these people shall i divide
[54:09] all the an inheritance the land which i
[54:12] swear
[54:13] unto their fathers to give them praise
[54:16] be to god
[54:17] may the lord add his blessings to the
[54:20] religion of his word
[54:21] shall we be seated
[54:26] as i was with moses so will i be with
[54:30] you
[54:31] now i want us to look at moses a little
[54:39] from birth
[54:44] the life of moses was in the hands of
[54:46] god
[54:48] right from birth
[54:52] and his mother knew
[54:55] that the life of moses was in the hands
[54:58] of god
[55:00] she knew that moses was born a deliverer
[55:04] that was why she could death pharaoh
[55:07] because there was a law that was passed
[55:10] and a male born should be killed
[55:14] and she went and put the baby on the
[55:15] nile because she knew
[55:18] that the life of that baby was in the
[55:21] hands of god
[55:22] praise be to god and no matter what was
[55:25] going to happen
[55:28] she knew that god was going to take care
[55:30] of moses
[55:33] and for us believers i want us to know
[55:36] that our lives are in the hands of god
[55:39] right from
[55:40] breath sometimes you grow
[55:44] and your mother will tell you oh when i
[55:46] was pregnant with you
[55:48] i almost miscarried but by the grace of
[55:51] god what was god doing
[55:52] god was protecting his gift sometimes i
[55:56] would tell you oh i had to bed rest
[55:58] for six months because of you what was
[56:02] god doing
[56:03] god protecting his gift
[56:07] you know sometimes
[56:12] you see people grow and then they wish
[56:15] that oh
[56:16] i should have been born in this family
[56:19] why are my parents poor
[56:22] why are they this why are they not
[56:25] educated
[56:26] why are they this why are they that but
[56:29] you forget that they have to sacrifice
[56:30] everything for you
[56:33] it is better to be born
[56:37] by a poor wretched parent
[56:41] who will teach you the will of god
[56:44] than to be burned by the richest man on
[56:47] earth
[56:49] who will tell you that oh once upon a
[56:51] time you were a monkey you developed
[56:53] into an
[56:53] earth and you became a human being
[56:56] teaching you about
[56:56] evolution is better to be a child of god
[57:00] to be told the way of god
[57:03] than to seek the riches of this world
[57:08] the hand of god was upon moses
[57:12] right from his infancy and we know the
[57:16] story
[57:16] how moses ended up in pharaoh's house
[57:21] the man that had passed the law
[57:25] god brought his gift right under his
[57:27] nostrils
[57:28] and he had to take care of that gift
[57:31] praise be to god
[57:32] now just look at it
[57:36] all the education moses had
[57:39] all the training he had could never
[57:43] prepare him
[57:44] for the assignment god had for him
[57:48] his mother had told him that he was the
[57:50] deliverer
[57:52] that god was going to use him to deliver
[57:54] the children of israel
[57:56] from bondage and he grew up with it
[58:00] and in his heart he was not looking
[58:04] at the beautiful things in egypt he was
[58:08] not looking at the throne he was not
[58:10] looking at the benefits
[58:12] he was looking at the promises of god
[58:17] sometimes for the love of god you have
[58:20] to turn down a lot of things
[58:22] and people will look at you and think
[58:24] you are out of your mind
[58:26] of course you have to be out of your
[58:28] mind to gain the mind of christ
[58:30] praise be to god
[58:33] but you look at you know he was getting
[58:37] his
[58:37] influence from a different dimension
[58:41] he was not looking at the beautiful
[58:44] things around
[58:46] his heart was set on heavenly things
[58:53] moses growing up he had in him
[58:57] he knew that he was a deliverer
[59:00] but he went about it the wrong way
[59:06] when he killed that egyptian
[59:12] all his years of education
[59:16] could not get him
[59:19] to do what god wanted him to do
[59:24] he did it the way he thought was the
[59:25] best
[59:28] you don't serve god the way you think
[59:31] you serve god according to the will of
[59:33] god
[59:35] if it is anything less than what the
[59:38] world requires
[59:40] god is dishonored in that i don't care
[59:43] how good it is praise be to god
[59:48] now we know the story how moses ran
[59:51] and he found himself in median now at
[59:54] this point
[59:56] to moses it was all over
[1:00:02] he found himself a wife
[1:00:05] married got settled
[1:00:10] and i don't think moses planned
[1:00:13] to ever go back to egypt
[1:00:17] he was comfortable with life in media
[1:00:23] he would just get up in the morning
[1:00:27] just take his rod and the ship go before
[1:00:31] him
[1:00:32] and he's behind them all day
[1:00:36] when the sun was shining the sun shone
[1:00:39] on him
[1:00:41] when it was raining the sun rain that
[1:00:44] came on the ship came on him
[1:00:47] he was just out there and i wonder what
[1:00:50] was going in moses mind
[1:00:53] because at this point he may have been
[1:00:55] thinking
[1:00:57] but my mummy told me that i was the
[1:01:00] deliverer
[1:01:02] was mommy lying to me probably my mom
[1:01:06] was lying to me the deliverer
[1:01:11] to lead the people of god out of bondage
[1:01:14] and here i find myself
[1:01:15] following sheep
[1:01:19] in the wilderness and sometimes he may
[1:01:24] have thought
[1:01:27] would it have been better if i inherited
[1:01:30] the throne
[1:01:32] and became the next pharaoh and then
[1:01:35] allowed the people to go was that the
[1:01:37] right way
[1:01:38] probably that was the way god wanted me
[1:01:40] to go
[1:01:43] and he may have thought
[1:01:46] a lot of thoughts came to him as he was
[1:01:49] just roaming
[1:01:51] with a sheep going out and coming in
[1:01:55] every single day now when you look at
[1:01:58] the name of his son
[1:02:00] eliasa the meaning of that name
[1:02:05] it tells you of a man that had given up
[1:02:11] praise be to god eliasa means
[1:02:14] the god of my father says
[1:02:18] he is my helper and has delivered me
[1:02:21] from the sword of pharaoh
[1:02:25] now with my limited english knowledge
[1:02:31] if you are telling me that he says he's
[1:02:35] my helper
[1:02:36] i think it is different from saying he
[1:02:39] is my helper
[1:02:42] so at this point it was painting a
[1:02:45] picture of somebody that was
[1:02:46] disappointed
[1:02:51] and moses kind of felt that oh i have
[1:02:55] let god down
[1:02:58] he never saw his way back
[1:03:01] i don't know how many of you have ever
[1:03:03] been there
[1:03:04] but i have walked those corridors
[1:03:08] that you got to a point in your life and
[1:03:11] you
[1:03:11] know deep down your soul that you have
[1:03:14] let god down
[1:03:15] that you have turned your back on god
[1:03:18] and you look behind
[1:03:19] you and there is no way of ever tracing
[1:03:22] your steps back
[1:03:24] to the altar of god and you feel so
[1:03:26] condemned
[1:03:28] and the devil capitalizes on it and he
[1:03:30] would hammer you down
[1:03:32] day and night if god does not help you
[1:03:36] you wouldn't know when you put the ropes
[1:03:37] around your neck
[1:03:43] moses had given up
[1:03:46] but one day he got up and it was meant
[1:03:49] to be
[1:03:51] one of those days one of those
[1:03:54] normal days and then he took his sheep
[1:03:59] and while they were out there
[1:04:04] he saw that the bush was on fire
[1:04:08] and yet it was not burning
[1:04:12] and that caught his attention
[1:04:16] at this point he didn't hear anything
[1:04:20] it was when he turned
[1:04:24] to look at it because it was a strange
[1:04:27] sight
[1:04:28] that he had moses moses
[1:04:35] and moses could identify himself with
[1:04:38] that voice
[1:04:40] praise be to god this was the first time
[1:04:43] moses was hearing the voice of god
[1:04:46] and you think moses could identify
[1:04:48] himself with that voice
[1:04:50] how possible is it
[1:04:54] that sounds like an irony praise be to
[1:04:57] god
[1:04:59] this reminds me of the story about the
[1:05:03] eagle
[1:05:04] when he enter picked the egg of that
[1:05:07] eagle and gave it to a hand to hatch
[1:05:11] and the hand hide that eagle and it was
[1:05:14] just in the hand coupe
[1:05:16] there with the other with the brothers
[1:05:18] and sisters
[1:05:19] just scratching the floor looking for
[1:05:22] food here and there
[1:05:24] he may have looked different from the
[1:05:28] others
[1:05:29] because the mouth was different the big
[1:05:33] the feathers
[1:05:34] the brothers may have looked at it so
[1:05:36] weird but how does this brother look
[1:05:38] like this
[1:05:39] and what have you but one day
[1:05:43] mama eagle was in the air just going
[1:05:46] around
[1:05:47] and the mama eagle saw the baby eagle
[1:05:50] and then she screamed
[1:05:53] that was the first time that the baby
[1:05:56] eagle would hear the voice of the mother
[1:05:59] but that baby ego could identify itself
[1:06:02] with that voice
[1:06:04] praise be to god and when he turned to
[1:06:07] look
[1:06:08] and she screamed back he said yes i am
[1:06:12] your mommy
[1:06:13] i have been looking for you all this
[1:06:15] while
[1:06:16] he said mommy so i don't belong here she
[1:06:18] said no you don't belong here you belong
[1:06:20] to the skies
[1:06:22] they say mommy if it's you build me to
[1:06:24] come mommy says come over
[1:06:26] praise be to god and the baby iggy just
[1:06:29] flopped his wings
[1:06:30] and just hit the fence and came down oh
[1:06:33] just
[1:06:33] right and mommy eagle realized that oh
[1:06:37] it is not your time but she knew what
[1:06:40] bit where the baby eagle was
[1:06:42] and she just flew away oh
[1:06:46] something happened there was a revival
[1:06:51] going on in the soul of that baby eagle
[1:06:56] because that baby had a voice
[1:07:01] their brothers and sisters were dead
[1:07:03] they didn't know what was going on
[1:07:05] when a deep cross there is a deep to
[1:07:07] answer
[1:07:08] praise be to god oh there was a revival
[1:07:11] going on in the hell group
[1:07:13] and i see the baby eagle running from
[1:07:15] left to right
[1:07:16] just jumping up and down because there
[1:07:18] was something going on
[1:07:21] and then the brothers and sisters who
[1:07:22] look at it so weird
[1:07:24] what is going on with this guy it looks
[1:07:27] like he's getting out of his mind
[1:07:30] probably it needs a physician
[1:07:33] oh yeah we need to help him we need to
[1:07:36] carry him to see the psychologists
[1:07:39] praise be to god but the baby eager
[1:07:42] would not have any of that
[1:07:43] because it knew what was going on
[1:07:47] and another time mama eager comes around
[1:07:52] and when mama eagle screamed the baby
[1:07:55] eagle
[1:07:56] looked and screamed also
[1:07:59] mama you said come and flop your wings
[1:08:02] the baby flopped his wings i was just
[1:08:06] going up
[1:08:07] mama you said come on come with me and
[1:08:10] then they weren't flying in the skies
[1:08:13] and i can imagine the baby telling mama
[1:08:15] oh mama
[1:08:16] oh we are going too high i'm afraid mama
[1:08:19] said just come over don't be afraid i'm
[1:08:21] with you
[1:08:22] you belong to the skies and then they
[1:08:25] went
[1:08:26] but just remember that it was
[1:08:29] when the baby eagle turned
[1:08:33] time to see the voice
[1:08:37] that was when
[1:08:40] things changed
[1:08:45] so you asked me how moses could identify
[1:08:47] himself with that voice
[1:08:49] i don't know how but i believe with all
[1:08:52] my heart
[1:08:54] it's like the first time you heard
[1:08:57] god speaking to you deep down
[1:09:00] in your soul you knew it
[1:09:05] and nobody could talk you out of it you
[1:09:08] could identify yourself with that voice
[1:09:11] praise be to god and when moses stand
[1:09:16] and god spoke to him
[1:09:20] i wouldn't want to go into all that
[1:09:24] and now just fast forward
[1:09:28] all the drama as i was with moses
[1:09:33] so will i be with you now moses finds
[1:09:36] himself in egypt
[1:09:39] god told moses that you have become
[1:09:43] a god to pharaoh
[1:09:49] and aaron is your prophet
[1:09:54] the man moses
[1:09:57] even though an ordinary human being he
[1:10:00] was not
[1:10:01] ordinary
[1:10:05] god took that man moses
[1:10:09] god sat into that man moses
[1:10:12] he used his hands his feet
[1:10:17] to glorify himself
[1:10:21] when he called moses he said
[1:10:24] i have heard the cry of my people and
[1:10:27] i have come down to deliver them
[1:10:32] it was not moses it was god in moses
[1:10:39] now all the miracles moses calling place
[1:10:43] upon
[1:10:44] plagues placed upon plagues
[1:10:47] turning the rivers into into blood
[1:10:50] calling frogs grass i mean
[1:10:53] all just miracles until finally
[1:10:58] the first bones of both human
[1:11:02] including pharaoh's first son and animal
[1:11:05] had to die
[1:11:07] and then they couldn't take it anymore
[1:11:11] and at this point pharaoh had gotten
[1:11:14] enough
[1:11:16] can a man fight god and win
[1:11:19] it is only a foolish dog that would see
[1:11:23] a lion and run after it
[1:11:29] a wise dog would choose his fight
[1:11:33] wisely it knows where to venture
[1:11:37] and where not to venture
[1:11:44] pharaoh had gotten enough and then he
[1:11:48] let the children go now
[1:11:52] when they got before the red sea
[1:11:55] god had in pharaoh's hearts
[1:11:59] and he took his army and they ran after
[1:12:02] the children of israel
[1:12:04] to bring them back
[1:12:08] and to subject them again
[1:12:11] to punishment
[1:12:14] now when the children of israel saw the
[1:12:16] army of egypt
[1:12:17] the egyptian army coming and they could
[1:12:20] see
[1:12:22] the dust below it in the air and the
[1:12:25] straw started crying
[1:12:27] and shouting and complaining
[1:12:31] when moses turned and looked at them he
[1:12:33] had already passed judgment on the
[1:12:34] people
[1:12:35] he said these people you see you would
[1:12:38] never see them again
[1:12:40] and god was waiting on moses to take an
[1:12:43] action
[1:12:44] and moses was waiting on god now
[1:12:46] remember
[1:12:47] at this point moses had used that
[1:12:51] road in his hands several times
[1:12:56] brother branham said that road in moses
[1:12:59] hand
[1:13:00] was god's judgment road
[1:13:05] so when moses declared that these people
[1:13:09] you see you will never see them again
[1:13:11] i believe at that point if he has
[1:13:14] straight down road and called for fire
[1:13:16] fire was going to come down but he stood
[1:13:20] and god told moses why are you crying
[1:13:23] unto me
[1:13:25] why are you crying unto me moses
[1:13:30] is that not a rod in your hand turn and
[1:13:32] stretch it towards the sea
[1:13:35] and divide the sea and when he turned
[1:13:37] and stretched it
[1:13:40] he divided the sea praise be to god
[1:13:45] and the children of israel walked on dry
[1:13:48] ground and their enemy perceiving them
[1:13:52] god consumed in the midst of the sea
[1:13:55] when he strayed the road again and the
[1:13:57] sea just came back
[1:14:00] remember we are talking about as
[1:14:03] i was with moses
[1:14:07] so will i be with you i'm skipping a lot
[1:14:11] of things
[1:14:12] because i want to make it as short as
[1:14:15] possible
[1:14:17] and to cover enough grounds praise be to
[1:14:20] god as i was with moses
[1:14:23] now god was with the man moses
[1:14:26] so much
[1:14:31] that even when his own sister
[1:14:35] didn't speak right about the prophet
[1:14:39] god came down in the pillar of cloud
[1:14:43] god was not happy with miriam and aeron
[1:14:47] and god said if there is any prophet
[1:14:50] amongst you
[1:14:51] i the lord will make myself known unto
[1:14:53] him
[1:14:54] in dreams and will speak to him in
[1:14:56] visions
[1:14:57] but as for my servant moses
[1:15:00] it is not so i speak to him live to live
[1:15:06] praise be to god and god struck him with
[1:15:10] leprosy
[1:15:11] struck her with leprosy
[1:15:16] and when aaron saw it because iran was
[1:15:20] part of it
[1:15:21] he was so scared
[1:15:24] and moses had to pray for miriam
[1:15:28] upon all that they had to keep her away
[1:15:32] for seven days
[1:15:35] god was so much with moses
[1:15:38] and god so much vindicated his prophet
[1:15:44] when deaton kora and abiram conspired
[1:15:48] against the prophet of god
[1:15:50] what happened the grand opening of
[1:15:54] swallow them there together with their
[1:15:56] families
[1:15:58] even the 250 men
[1:16:01] who offered sacrifice who were of their
[1:16:05] company
[1:16:07] fire came down and consumed them
[1:16:12] that even when god was displeased with
[1:16:15] the children of israel
[1:16:17] and he came down to consume them
[1:16:21] moses stood in the gap
[1:16:25] and he told god do not do it
[1:16:28] if you do it the egyptians are going to
[1:16:31] laugh at us
[1:16:32] they will say you brought us out of
[1:16:34] egypt you couldn't get us to the
[1:16:35] homeland
[1:16:37] and god had to listen praise be to god
[1:16:42] that was how close moses was to god
[1:16:47] god on two feet
[1:16:52] now but i want us to look at something
[1:16:56] here
[1:16:59] never get complacent
[1:17:03] in your work with god complacency
[1:17:08] i try to look out the definition of the
[1:17:10] word complacency
[1:17:11] and what i picked is a feeling
[1:17:16] of satisfaction that comes from your
[1:17:20] achievement
[1:17:27] so you can look at how far you have come
[1:17:29] with god
[1:17:30] where he picked you from and why he has
[1:17:33] brought you
[1:17:35] and then you allow
[1:17:38] things into your life which you
[1:17:40] shouldn't allow
[1:17:42] you get complacent
[1:17:48] moses who on earth would
[1:17:51] think that a man like moses
[1:17:55] would do something and god will be
[1:17:56] displeased with it
[1:18:00] when the children of israel needed water
[1:18:02] to drink and moses spoke to
[1:18:04] god spoke to moses to go and speak to
[1:18:07] the rock
[1:18:08] that the rock may bring forth its water
[1:18:12] for them to drink they're together with
[1:18:14] their beasts
[1:18:16] moses took iran and the elders of israel
[1:18:20] and when they got to the rock instead of
[1:18:22] speaking to the rock
[1:18:24] moses smote the rock and then smote it
[1:18:28] again
[1:18:31] brother branham said
[1:18:34] that moses striking the rock
[1:18:38] twice through the picture of god
[1:18:43] the whole picture threw it out of order
[1:18:47] it was a serious thing because
[1:18:50] the rock that followed them was christ
[1:18:54] and he was so much he was he was smitten
[1:18:57] once
[1:19:00] and for moses to strike and strike again
[1:19:03] the second time
[1:19:05] was breaking scripture
[1:19:10] and god was not happy with moses
[1:19:14] and god said moses because of this thing
[1:19:18] you have done
[1:19:21] you will see the promised land but you
[1:19:24] are not going to go in there
[1:19:27] i don't care how far god has brought you
[1:19:33] i don't care if you speak and fire comes
[1:19:36] out from heaven
[1:19:38] never let complacency get in your way
[1:19:41] with god
[1:19:48] was it king of zia at the age of 16 who
[1:19:51] became the king of judah
[1:19:53] and he found favor so much in the sight
[1:19:56] of god
[1:19:59] and he went to the temple one day to go
[1:20:02] and burn incense
[1:20:04] that was not his office
[1:20:09] god was displeased with him and god
[1:20:11] struck him with leprosy
[1:20:14] do not let complacency get
[1:20:18] in your way with god
[1:20:22] that is a dangerous thing to do
[1:20:25] moses saw the promised land
[1:20:30] and moses did not enter
[1:20:34] so at this point
[1:20:38] god talks to joshua
[1:20:42] if we can just go back to that scripture
[1:20:44] again
[1:20:46] just show one
[1:21:04] joshua went
[1:21:26] seven only be thou
[1:21:29] strong and very courageous that thy
[1:21:32] mayors observed to do according to
[1:21:34] all the law which moses my servant
[1:21:37] commanded thee
[1:21:38] turn not from it to the right
[1:21:42] hand or to the left that
[1:21:45] thou mayest prosper whether so ever
[1:21:49] thou goes this book of the law
[1:21:53] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:21:57] but thou shalt meditate there in day and
[1:21:59] night
[1:22:00] that that mayors do that that may have
[1:22:03] observed
[1:22:04] to do according to all that is written
[1:22:07] during
[1:22:08] for them thou shalt make
[1:22:12] thy way prosperous and then thou shall
[1:22:15] have good success
[1:22:18] have i not commanded thee be strong
[1:22:22] and of good courage be not afraid
[1:22:25] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[1:22:28] thy god
[1:22:28] is with thee with us so ever
[1:22:32] thou goes praise be to god
[1:22:36] god telling moses god telling joshua
[1:22:40] do not turn to the left do not turn to
[1:22:44] the right
[1:22:46] walk in the statues
[1:22:50] walk according to the law what you have
[1:22:52] been told
[1:22:54] do not deviate from the word
[1:23:01] full obedience to the word of god
[1:23:05] is what brings the victory
[1:23:09] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:23:14] there is no way
[1:23:17] you can prosper in the things of god
[1:23:21] when you disrespect the word
[1:23:26] the word is the absolute
[1:23:31] and god told joshua not
[1:23:34] to depart from the word
[1:23:37] and joshua caught it
[1:23:41] he knew that to be successful
[1:23:44] he had to put the word first to be
[1:23:47] victorious
[1:23:48] he had to put the word first to please
[1:23:51] god
[1:23:52] he had to put the white first
[1:23:56] and god brings joshua and the church of
[1:23:59] israel
[1:24:01] to the jordan brother branham said
[1:24:05] the river jordan was three four times
[1:24:09] its normal size
[1:24:13] it was full
[1:24:16] flew in his banks
[1:24:21] and god told joshua in three days
[1:24:25] you guys are crossing over
[1:24:29] brother brother said that god
[1:24:32] was testing joshua
[1:24:37] he was testing him to see whether he was
[1:24:41] a real joshua
[1:24:42] he knew and joshua told the people
[1:24:46] that god said in three days
[1:24:49] we are going over and in three days
[1:24:53] we are going over how the people may
[1:24:56] have looked at him
[1:24:59] and wondered what was wrong with him
[1:25:02] they may have suggested to him why don't
[1:25:04] we wait
[1:25:06] till the waters recede in the dry season
[1:25:08] so we can just walk across
[1:25:11] it is not what you think it's what
[1:25:15] god wants them praise be to god
[1:25:21] and joshua told them god said
[1:25:24] in three days we are going over and in
[1:25:27] three days
[1:25:28] we are going over and look at what
[1:25:30] joshua does
[1:25:32] god commanded him to stay with the world
[1:25:36] and what he does he puts the word first
[1:25:41] the ark of the covenant
[1:25:45] the ark of the covenant went first
[1:25:48] and you commanded them go ahead
[1:25:53] now the children may have heard
[1:25:56] the story being told that when they got
[1:26:00] before the red sea
[1:26:02] the waters parted and they walked
[1:26:04] through
[1:26:05] and i hear joshua is telling them with
[1:26:08] all the water overflowing the banks
[1:26:10] joshua said come on go ahead
[1:26:15] and they were wondering what is going on
[1:26:18] but they believed
[1:26:19] god was with him
[1:26:22] and when joshua commanded the priests
[1:26:25] who were bearing the act to go forward
[1:26:27] they went forward and as soon as their
[1:26:29] feet
[1:26:30] tied the walls of jordan the waters
[1:26:33] parted
[1:26:34] praise be to god and they walked through
[1:26:39] and when they got to the other side of
[1:26:41] jordan
[1:26:42] and the enemies heard of what the lord
[1:26:45] had done
[1:26:46] there was no man left in the camp
[1:26:48] anymore
[1:26:50] praise be to god as i was with
[1:26:54] moses so will i be with you
[1:26:58] and now the people saw that yes
[1:27:03] the god of moses was in the camp
[1:27:10] now they go ahead they go to jericho
[1:27:15] goddess christ his father what to do
[1:27:18] and they just did it according to the
[1:27:21] word
[1:27:22] it is the word that brings the victory
[1:27:28] following the leadership of the word
[1:27:32] brings the victory
[1:27:37] don't try to fine-tune it you can't
[1:27:40] fine-tune the word of god
[1:27:44] it may not make sense to you
[1:27:48] it doesn't have to make sense to you
[1:27:51] if it makes sense to you where lies the
[1:27:54] faith
[1:27:57] praise be to god
[1:28:00] and we know the story how the words of
[1:28:02] jericho came down
[1:28:05] as i was with moses
[1:28:08] so will i be with you
[1:28:16] and now
[1:28:22] when the opportunity came
[1:28:26] and the prophet of god did a time
[1:28:31] to finish a battle he spoke to the sun
[1:28:36] spoke to the moon something that had
[1:28:38] never happened before
[1:28:40] and god had to listen
[1:28:48] as i was
[1:28:51] with moses now
[1:28:55] in this day and in our age
[1:29:02] god also sent us a prophet
[1:29:09] i will not read everything i have here
[1:29:11] but i think i can take this first page
[1:29:16] brother brad i'm speaking
[1:29:20] now when god gave me my commission i
[1:29:23] have based
[1:29:24] all this back
[1:29:27] for this one purpose
[1:29:30] gifts and calling are without repentance
[1:29:34] no man can make himself anything
[1:29:38] god makes you what you are
[1:29:41] by his grace we have no way of making
[1:29:46] ourselves
[1:29:47] jesus said who taking thought
[1:29:51] can add one cubit to his toucher
[1:29:56] who can make himself bigger or
[1:29:59] littler than you know by taking thought
[1:30:03] you can't do it
[1:30:07] when god gave the commission i
[1:30:09] questioned it i
[1:30:10] said i'm insufficient
[1:30:14] i have no education
[1:30:17] i cannot do this.
[1:30:21] it is not what you can do
[1:30:24] it is not your strength
[1:30:28] its what god is willing to do in your
[1:30:32] life
[1:30:34] it is not your education
[1:30:37] education is good those of you that are
[1:30:40] in school
[1:30:41] when you go to school study and study
[1:30:43] hard
[1:30:46] if there is anybody in school who is the
[1:30:49] best
[1:30:50] it should be one of you here
[1:30:54] give it your all when you are in class
[1:30:57] pay attention
[1:31:02] give it your all
[1:31:05] but education does not help men to know
[1:31:08] god
[1:31:12] education can only help you to read
[1:31:16] it doesn't even help you to understand
[1:31:18] the word
[1:31:25] you would think that some of the most
[1:31:27] educated men we have
[1:31:30] probably should be those that get so
[1:31:32] close to god but there are those that
[1:31:34] are farther away from god
[1:31:37] there are people as we speak they are
[1:31:39] sitting on the moon
[1:31:42] and they see the mystery of god more
[1:31:45] than we do
[1:31:47] they are seeing the heavenly this
[1:31:50] and you would think that that would give
[1:31:52] them
[1:31:53] some fear to know that yes
[1:31:56] it's true that there is a god who
[1:31:58] created this thing
[1:31:59] and some of these people are those that
[1:32:01] are propounding those theories
[1:32:04] that human beings evolve from apes or is
[1:32:07] it
[1:32:07] monkeys i don't know yet praise be to
[1:32:10] god
[1:32:13] the prophet did not have any good
[1:32:15] education we know
[1:32:19] we know about the birth of the prophet
[1:32:21] the mystery
[1:32:22] surrounding his breath um let me just
[1:32:25] cover a little ground here so we can go
[1:32:26] into some of these things
[1:32:32] and many of you people here this morning
[1:32:37] are still living here today
[1:32:40] when he appeared down here on the river
[1:32:44] in that form of the pillar of fire
[1:32:48] and stood there and spoke back and said
[1:32:51] as john the baptist was sent
[1:32:55] forth for a forerunner
[1:32:58] of the first coming of christ so will
[1:33:01] your message
[1:33:03] be the forerunning of the second coming
[1:33:09] look was done that light hanging over
[1:33:12] there
[1:33:13] it entered the paper it went
[1:33:17] all the way across the united states
[1:33:20] and into other nations
[1:33:24] talks about dr lee lee
[1:33:27] level um there was in canada at the time
[1:33:32] he remembers when it appeared in the
[1:33:34] canadian paper i believe it was
[1:33:37] wasn't it i spoke to the brother now
[1:33:40] let's just take a step down
[1:33:42] but one day god decided to stop the
[1:33:44] mouth of the unbelievers
[1:33:47] because he stayed with the word
[1:33:50] the same pillar of fire that led the
[1:33:52] children of israel
[1:33:54] is just the same today leading
[1:33:58] the church spiritual is the same
[1:34:01] as it led the natural it appeared again
[1:34:06] and they took the pictures before the
[1:34:09] critics
[1:34:10] and before the examiners here it hangs
[1:34:13] now
[1:34:14] infallible infallibly the
[1:34:18] truth doing the same works
[1:34:21] leading a people spiritually as it
[1:34:25] led them naturally back there staying
[1:34:28] with the word praise be to god
[1:34:32] i charge you before god
[1:34:35] and the elect angels and jesus christ
[1:34:39] the commission was pray for the sick
[1:34:42] the question was insufficient to do it
[1:34:48] for this course you were born
[1:34:51] this is the means of your peculiar
[1:34:55] breath
[1:34:56] and life that you are to pray for the
[1:35:00] sick
[1:35:02] if you will get them to believe you and
[1:35:04] be sincere
[1:35:06] when you pray nothing shall stand before
[1:35:08] your prayer
[1:35:10] not even a cancer how many has read that
[1:35:14] through the years is all over the world
[1:35:18] praise be to god
[1:35:26] he said as moses was given two
[1:35:29] signs to vindicate his commission
[1:35:36] so uh
[1:35:40] so are you you are given two signs
[1:35:44] one of them will be
[1:35:47] your hand the other one
[1:35:51] will be you will know the very secret
[1:35:54] of their heart and thoughts of their
[1:35:57] mind
[1:35:58] and by this they will believe
[1:36:01] by these signs now remember listen
[1:36:04] don't you fail to get this
[1:36:08] the sign is not the commission
[1:36:11] the sign only points to the commission
[1:36:15] praise be to god
[1:36:19] i have another page
[1:36:23] i wouldn't go into that i'll be running
[1:36:26] up very soon
[1:36:30] we know about the peculiar breath of the
[1:36:32] prophet
[1:36:35] how that during his birth that light
[1:36:37] came into the room
[1:36:38] and again at his age seven
[1:36:42] and how did the pillar of fire
[1:36:45] god coming down to vindicate the
[1:36:49] ministry
[1:36:50] of his servant the prophet
[1:36:55] and allowing the cameras
[1:36:58] to capture it praise be to god
[1:37:03] that god was with him
[1:37:06] as he was with moses
[1:37:10] god was with the prophet
[1:37:14] god worked with him in fact
[1:37:18] i cannot think of any healing ministry
[1:37:21] that comes so close to the healing
[1:37:24] ministry
[1:37:25] that brother branham heard nothing
[1:37:28] compares to it
[1:37:31] god uses so much
[1:37:35] that he could tell the secret of man's
[1:37:38] heart
[1:37:40] praise be to god
[1:37:43] but look at it the prophet did not have
[1:37:46] an easy life look at the family his
[1:37:50] family background
[1:37:52] from a very poor background look at his
[1:37:56] father
[1:37:57] spoke of his father being a drunk
[1:38:01] never hate that how life was so
[1:38:04] difficult
[1:38:06] look at the home why he was raised up
[1:38:10] in
[1:38:13] a prophet of god
[1:38:18] with that humble humble
[1:38:21] background
[1:38:27] i don't know what you may be going
[1:38:29] through
[1:38:31] the things you are going through do not
[1:38:34] define who you are
[1:38:44] and to think of the prophet of god
[1:38:47] losing his wife his first wife and his
[1:38:50] baby
[1:38:51] all together
[1:38:57] i mean it it blows your mind
[1:39:04] sometimes we are start life to be rosy
[1:39:08] to be comfortable that we want this we
[1:39:11] got it
[1:39:12] we want that we get it
[1:39:15] and by that we think that oh god is with
[1:39:17] us
[1:39:18] no it is not always like that
[1:39:25] and the pillar of fire
[1:39:29] that you see hanging over the prophet
[1:39:35] when god took his prophet away
[1:39:40] he didn't take that pillar of fire away
[1:39:46] wherever this message of
[1:39:48] america foregoes
[1:39:50] that pillar of fire goes to vindicate it
[1:39:54] and as we sit here tonight the pillar of
[1:39:57] fire is here
[1:40:00] the bible says that one two or three i
[1:40:03] gotta remind them there i am in their
[1:40:05] midst
[1:40:06] god is here tonight god is here tonight
[1:40:12] his wife says i will never leave you nor
[1:40:14] forsake you
[1:40:16] i will be with you alway and as i was
[1:40:19] with moses
[1:40:21] so will i be with you
[1:40:24] god was with moses god was with joshua
[1:40:28] god was with the prophet and god is with
[1:40:31] you tonight
[1:40:34] do not look at the storms
[1:40:38] look at the promises of god
[1:40:41] i will never leave you not forsake you
[1:40:44] the pillar of fire is here to vindicate
[1:40:48] the ministry of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:51] it was not brother branham's message
[1:40:56] he came to reveal christ
[1:40:59] to point the bride to christ
[1:41:04] be to god i don't care what it is that
[1:41:07] people say about
[1:41:08] random i don't give a damn about that
[1:41:11] the most
[1:41:11] important thing is that his
[1:41:15] message has changed my life
[1:41:19] praise be to god oh
[1:41:22] something just kicked in i remember
[1:41:25] brother
[1:41:26] brother once saying something was it
[1:41:28] last last two weeks
[1:41:31] i'm not quoting him verb at him in other
[1:41:33] words i'm not quoting him what
[1:41:35] word he just dropped in
[1:41:38] because he says something like what will
[1:41:40] be
[1:41:42] the importance of
[1:41:46] the god of rhetoric after all that the
[1:41:50] or after all that god did in his life
[1:41:53] all the miracles the wonders
[1:41:57] and that god cannot change his life
[1:42:00] what is the use he says something like
[1:42:03] that
[1:42:07] it is not about brother browner he came
[1:42:11] he has done his part he is gone
[1:42:14] what are you doing the ball is in your
[1:42:18] cut now
[1:42:20] what are you doing with the weight what
[1:42:23] are you doing with the word
[1:42:31] remember that the god we serve
[1:42:34] is a no-nonsense god
[1:42:40] there is some blood
[1:42:43] on the mercy seat
[1:42:50] when the blood leaves that mercy seat
[1:42:53] that same seat becomes a judgment seat
[1:42:59] and while there is some mercy
[1:43:03] let's reach out
[1:43:06] let's keep crying out to god
[1:43:09] because god hears the cry of his
[1:43:11] children
[1:43:13] and at the appointed time
[1:43:17] god will show forth
[1:43:23] do not take the things of god for
[1:43:25] granted
[1:43:29] it's just the grace of god that is
[1:43:31] keeping us
[1:43:33] but some of us can look at our lives and
[1:43:36] then see what we have done in our lives
[1:43:39] and we know that if it hadn't been for
[1:43:42] the grace of god
[1:43:43] will not be living he would have struck
[1:43:46] us dead
[1:43:49] but grace came our way
[1:43:54] and while grace still lasts
[1:43:59] make good use of it
[1:44:02] make goodness of it
[1:44:06] as i was with moses
[1:44:10] so will i be with you so remember
[1:44:13] that you are not alone in this journey
[1:44:17] when the going gets tough
[1:44:21] remember that you have a god that is
[1:44:24] with you and that you are not alone
[1:44:30] when sickness comes remember that god is
[1:44:32] there with you
[1:44:34] when troubles come remember that god is
[1:44:36] there with you
[1:44:38] when the stops are coming remember that
[1:44:40] god is there with you
[1:44:42] when you are surrounded by the enemy on
[1:44:44] every side
[1:44:45] remember that god is there with you
[1:44:48] and who can fight against god and win
[1:44:54] our lives are in the hands of god
[1:44:58] and our lives are altered by god
[1:45:03] from the cradle
[1:45:06] all through life nothing takes god by
[1:45:08] surprise
[1:45:10] praise be to god as i was with moses
[1:45:15] this is a very good place to bring the
[1:45:18] kitchen down
[1:45:21] so if you don't take anything from
[1:45:23] tonight's service
[1:45:25] remember that
[1:45:28] god has not called you only to sit on
[1:45:32] your fence
[1:45:33] and then look at you struggle by
[1:45:36] yourself
[1:45:38] because he knows that you can't do it
[1:45:42] so remember that you are in the hands of
[1:45:45] god
[1:45:47] wherever you find yourself remember that
[1:45:49] god is there
[1:45:50] be conscious of the presence of god
[1:45:54] the reason why sometimes we do this we
[1:45:56] shouldn't do
[1:45:57] is that we lack that consciousness
[1:46:00] but if you are conscious that the god
[1:46:03] you are serving is with you
[1:46:05] you are careful the things you do
[1:46:09] you are careful you are careful the
[1:46:12] words that come out of your mouth
[1:46:14] you are careful the places you go
[1:46:18] you are careful that is you do
[1:46:21] because you are conscious of the
[1:46:23] presence of god
[1:46:26] and remember that
[1:46:29] he would never leave us and he would
[1:46:32] never forsake us
[1:46:34] he is in the camp
[1:46:38] he is in the camp praise be to god
[1:46:44] the musicians can come over are serving
[1:46:54] a living god
[1:46:59] and if it hadn't been for the grace of
[1:47:01] god will not be here
[1:47:05] if you look at all that is happening
[1:47:08] and we are still alive we are so strong
[1:47:12] we are healthy it's not because we know
[1:47:14] how to take care of ourselves
[1:47:19] if you ever got admitted to the hospital
[1:47:22] and then you came back home
[1:47:26] just think about it that somebody ever
[1:47:29] slept on that bed and never went back
[1:47:31] home
[1:47:33] you drive on a particular road in and
[1:47:36] out every day
[1:47:37] somebody drove down that road and never
[1:47:39] came back
[1:47:43] year in year out the grace of god has
[1:47:47] never left us
[1:47:50] as i was with moses so will i be with
[1:47:54] you
[1:47:55] god bless you saints
[1:47:59] and let's just say a word of prayer
[1:48:04] our lord and our savior jesus we thank
[1:48:06] this so much oh god for how far you have

[1:48:35] us

[1:50:58] you know brother branham said in that
[1:51:01] message but
[1:51:02] dan was reading from tonight and he
[1:51:04] spoke spoke
[1:51:06] from you know the lord gave brother
[1:51:08] branham that that message as i was with
[1:51:10] moses
[1:51:12] and talking about the two phases of his
[1:51:15] ministry
[1:51:16] and one of the things that the law was
[1:51:18] dealing with brother branham on
[1:51:19] was the the fear of failure
[1:51:24] praise the lord can you imagine the
[1:51:27] prophet of god like brother dan was
[1:51:28] saying
[1:51:29] all of the things that god did in his
[1:51:31] ministry giving him
[1:51:33] a sign in his hands i mean he can touch
[1:51:36] people
[1:51:36] and there will be a vibration right here
[1:51:38] on his hands and he will be able to know
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:42] diseases he got to a place in his
[1:51:46] ministry
[1:51:48] what he was afraid to feel
[1:51:52] praise the lord and
[1:51:56] it's kind of amazing because we read the
[1:51:59] book of
[1:52:00] ezekiel this morning and as i was
[1:52:02] driving to work
[1:52:04] i was thinking about the ministry of
[1:52:06] precision
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:08] how god has been precise right from the
[1:52:11] beginning
[1:52:13] you know that was just on my mind this
[1:52:15] morning as i was driving to work
[1:52:17] talking about measurements you know uh
[1:52:20] and
[1:52:21] and and different things uh i got a
[1:52:23] little story i'll share with you and
[1:52:25] if i had the time to talk on that but uh
[1:52:30] it's very amazing you know i that kind
[1:52:32] of
[1:52:33] caught my mind i went i went somewhere
[1:52:36] and i was uh
[1:52:37] i was looking at a uh a trouser
[1:52:41] and i took the trouser and i put it
[1:52:44] around my neck
[1:52:46] you know and and the gentleman was
[1:52:48] looking at me you know
[1:52:49] asking what am i doing i was trying to
[1:52:51] see if you know if it's going to fit me
[1:52:55] and he was just looking at me i said no
[1:52:57] i just want to make sure if he can get
[1:52:59] around my waist
[1:53:01] you know he says i've never seen people
[1:53:03] do that
[1:53:04] i said oh yeah if you can get around
[1:53:06] your neck you can get around your waist
[1:53:08] is it real you know and then when i was
[1:53:12] left from there
[1:53:12] i started thinking about measurements i
[1:53:15] started thinking about the different
[1:53:16] measurements you know of the act
[1:53:18] of the covenant and the different
[1:53:20] measurements through the scripture
[1:53:22] but we were talking about that if the
[1:53:24] lord gave us grace
[1:53:25] but just think about that you know
[1:53:28] brother branham goes
[1:53:29] to a place in his ministry
[1:53:32] where he i mean
[1:53:35] just that sense of failure that sense
[1:53:38] of being afraid to fail you know was
[1:53:41] haunting him
[1:53:43] you know and and every time he wanted
[1:53:45] the law to show him a vision
[1:53:47] you know uh you know he wanted to go on
[1:53:50] a vision he wanted to pray on the vision
[1:53:52] he wanted to
[1:53:53] you know and the lord was telling him as
[1:53:55] i was with moses
[1:53:56] so will i be with you you know if i
[1:53:59] didn't feel you in the first phase of
[1:54:01] the ministry
[1:54:02] i'm not going to fail you now amen and
[1:54:04] if god has kept us still now
[1:54:07] he's able to keep us into a rapture amen
[1:54:10] he's able to keep us into a body change
[1:54:12] praise the lord
[1:54:14] if we just keep that word before us on
[1:54:16] my way to service tonight i taught about
[1:54:18] that song
[1:54:19] i share with you one time it's an old
[1:54:22] song that a la fountain sang
[1:54:24] about family resemblance i just i just
[1:54:27] uh

[1:54:31] of the sensor but i would like for us to
