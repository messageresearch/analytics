[19:53] another opportunity to be together
[19:56] tonight.

[20:29] good to
[20:31] have you all in the service tonight. And
[20:33] we also greet those that are streaming

[20:47] happen. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's
[20:50] God's promise. That's God's promise.
[20:53] Wheresoever two or three I gather in my
[20:55] name, he said I will be there in their
[20:57] midst. So we thank the Lord for them.
[21:00] Praise the Lord. And our our friends and
[21:03] brothers uh traveled yesterday and they
[21:06] all sent their greetings and
[21:08] appreciation for for having them on a
[21:12] weekend. Even though it was not a
[21:15] planned trip, but uh they really enjoy
[21:17] the fellowship. They enjoy the people.
[21:20] They enjoy the services and they also
[21:23] enjoy the blessings and we thank the
[21:26] Lord for that. Amen.
[21:28] Praise the Lord. So uh uh I think this
[21:32] evening uh uh sister Joy the her
[21:38] mother and and sister get in this
[21:41] evening and uh I'm not seeing her. So I
[21:44] think uh that's that should be one of
[21:46] the reason. And uh sister Naomi also
[21:50] sent a text. Uh she and brother Jordan
[21:53] is uh talking with the folks working at
[21:56] her house there. So we we want to
[21:59] remember them in prayer. They're not
[22:01] here with us tonight.
[22:03] And uh spoke with brother Wesley
[22:06] yesterday.
[22:08] uh
[22:10] um he called for us to remember
[22:15] uh brother Cra and and and sister April.
[22:18] Now that that was a family that was
[22:20] always joining them in Illinois. Every
[22:23] time one time they were there in
[22:25] Illinois, that family would come over at
[22:28] their house to be able to stream the
[22:30] service together because they did not
[22:32] have a church in that area. So, uh, uh,
[22:37] Brother Wesley called yesterday and it
[22:40] looks like, uh, the sister is, uh,
[22:42] beginning to deal with, uh, uh,
[22:45] something that looks like a mental
[22:47] problem. And, uh, so we want to, we want
[22:51] to stand in the gap for her tonight,
[22:54] whatsoever that is bothering her mind,
[22:56] battering her spirit, that the Lord will
[22:59] be able to step in and uh, and just
[23:02] break the curses. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[23:06] And uh uh Brother Wesley is supposed to
[23:08] go in uh also uh
[23:13] uh
[23:14] to be able to uh uh treat his second
[23:18] eyes. He went in uh I think last week or
[23:21] so for one of the eye. They kind of give
[23:24] him an a steroid in his eyes. So they
[23:26] want to do the second one. And uh uh we
[23:30] are hoping and praying that uh it will
[23:33] kind of a work for him to be able to see
[23:35] better.
[23:38] And uh we will also continue to remember
[23:40] uh Sister Cara. She's supposed to go in
[23:43] on the 29th. Um
[23:46] uh for them to be able to um they also
[23:50] want to check her heart uh
[23:54] and then uh the situation with her
[23:56] knees. So we want to bring all of that
[23:59] to the Lord in prayer tonight. Is there
[24:01] any an unspoken prayer request in our
[24:03] midst tonight? You want to do that by an
[24:06] uplifted hands
[24:11] can see there from the back. Yeah. Uh
[24:25] yes. Yes.

[24:48] uh the owner of Tracy uh business
[24:50] property. She's uh is at uh large

[25:01] And uh so we want to remember that
[25:04] praying that the Lord will be that the
[25:07] Lord mercy will be with uh sister west
[25:10] that's another sister
[25:12] uh praying that everything goes well uh
[25:16] and the issue is solved and there's
[25:18] another prayer needs tonight uh for an
[25:20] unspoken prayer request

[25:40] is going down rapidly. He's in the
[25:43] hospital again and they are not
[25:45] expecting him to make it through

[42:58] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; You know, worship is all about how you
[43:04] make it. Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You can make it personal if you want to
[43:08] make it personal.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; And I like personal worship
[43:12] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said the truth worshipper
[43:14] will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[43:17] You might have different words up here
[43:19] and I'm singing something different. I
[43:21] feel good about it. Amen.

[43:44] brother Ara. Sister Joy, thank you. Aha.
[43:47] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[43:53] Glory be to God.
[43:55] Glory be to God. And uh let's start our
[43:59] our
[44:04] let's start our preaching tonight.
[44:08] I want to preach on something that is uh
[44:11] that has been long said and and then uh
[44:15] brother Brandon echo a few times. I want
[44:18] to talk on the cow die many times before
[44:21] their death.
[44:24] Amen.
[44:26] The cow died many times before their
[44:28] death
[44:30] when actually we were reading from uh uh
[44:34] uh the book of Ecclesiastic and you
[44:36] remember the the Bible said don't be
[44:39] foolish and wicked and die you die
[44:41] before your time
[44:43] &gt;&gt; and that verse has been the most ideal
[44:46] religious voice nobody can die before
[44:48] their time you know people don't die but
[44:50] the Bible say people can die before
[44:52] their time you know and everything is
[44:54] there So I think the only person that
[44:57] died before their time is a cow.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; So that's what I choose to preach on
[45:01] there tonight.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; A cow die many times before their death.
[45:06] 2 Samuel chapter 3.
[45:10] 2 Samuel chapter 3. You know when you
[45:13] you take those kind of a things and and
[45:15] you just preach on the verse, it's easy
[45:18] for people to to argue. But when when
[45:21] you preach your inspiration, then it's
[45:22] your inspiration. Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I would just want to preach my
[45:26] inspiration tonight. There's no need of
[45:29] fussing. There's no need of arguing.
[45:34] Let's just enjoy the fellowship of the
[45:36] Lord. Tonight, we read from 2 Samuel
[45:39] chapter 3. Let's read from verse 30. 2
[45:43] Samuel chapter 3. We will read from
[45:46] verse 30.
[45:50] And so Joab and the Abishad his brothers
[45:54] sold Abnne because he has slain their
[45:58] brother Aahel
[46:01] at Gibian in the battle. And David said
[46:04] to Joab and to all the people that were
[46:07] with him, "Rent your clothes
[46:10] and g
[46:13] you with sackcloth and moon before
[46:17] Abna."
[46:20] And King David himself
[46:23] followed the bird
[46:25] which mean he spread himself on the
[46:28] ground. He just don't he he did not only
[46:31] just tell the people to mourn but he got
[46:34] into the into the art of mourning. That
[46:37] word means that he he himself spray
[46:39] himself on the ground and started to
[46:41] weep.
[46:45] Praise the Lord.
[46:47] And uh
[46:49] uh okay, I kind of a little strike here.
[46:52] Okay, verse 32. And they buried Abnad in
[46:54] Hebrew. And the king lifted up his his
[46:57] voice and wept at the grave of Abnne.
[47:01] And all the people wept. Praise the
[47:04] Lord.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; And the king lamented over Abnne and
[47:10] said, "Die, Abnne,
[47:14] as a fool dareth."
[47:17] Thy hands were not bound, none thy feet
[47:21] put into filter.
[47:24] As a man fallth before wicked men, so
[47:27] fall down, and all the people wept again
[47:30] over him. David is saying these words
[47:34] and is just making the people to be
[47:37] emotional.
[47:39] If you know if you we will talk a little
[47:41] bit about the background of of what
[47:43] David is saying and then you'll be able
[47:45] to get the picture. Ecclesiastes chapter
[47:47] 7. Let's read u uh that famous verse
[47:51] there from from the preacher.
[47:56] We'll read that famous verse there from
[47:58] the preacher and then uh
[48:03] uh we will
[48:05] chapter 7.
[48:12] Praise the Lord.
[48:14] Chapter 7 verse 17. Be not over much
[48:17] wicked, neither be thou foolish.
[48:22] Why should I die before that time?
[48:26] Praise the Lord.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; So in another sense, wickedness is
[48:30] foolishness before God.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Because the two is the same.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Wickedness is foolishness before God.
[48:38] We'll look at that also in the type. And
[48:40] let's look at Revelation chapter 21.
[48:43] Revelation chapter 21 tonight.
[48:50] Revelation chapter 21.
[48:54] Let's read verse five.
[48:56] Revelation 21, reading from verse 5.
[49:00] [Music]
[49:02] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[49:04] "Behold, I make all things new."
[49:07] And he said unto me, "Write, for these
[49:10] words are truth and faithful."
[49:14] And he said unto me, "It is done." Which
[49:17] mean, it is finished. Amen. I'm the
[49:21] Alpha
[49:23] and Omega, the beginning and the end. I
[49:26] will give unto him that is at thirst or
[49:30] the fountains of the water of life
[49:33] freely.
[49:34] He that overcometh shall inherit all
[49:37] things, and I will be his God, and he
[49:43] shall be my son. Praise the Lord.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Let's read that verse 17 again.
[49:50] He that overcomemeth
[49:53] shall inherit all things and I will be
[49:57] his god and he shall be my son. Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And uh son not only in the sense of uh
[50:05] just a man or the male or the boy but he
[50:08] will be my child. Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; So here said God is giving a promise
[50:14] here. He that overcome it. He that
[50:17] overcometh, I don't care what it is.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; What it is, he that overcomemeth, he's
[50:23] saying he that overcometh all things. I
[50:27] can even say he that overcometh
[50:29] anything.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because you see, it is
[50:34] not just one thing that we will
[50:35] overcome.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; When you finish with one, another one is
[50:39] waiting for you.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And when you overcome one, you must be
[50:43] able to overcome the other one. You see,
[50:46] you cannot only survive on the testimony
[50:48] of what you overcome yesterday.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; It's what you are overcoming today. It's
[50:53] what you will overcome tomorrow.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Even on our dying bed, we will overcome.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Because we will say death, where is your
[51:02] stain?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Grave, where is your victory?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Thank be unto Jesus that gave us the
[51:07] victory. So he that overcome shall
[51:10] inherit all things and I will be his
[51:12] God, and he will be my son.
[51:15] But the fearful,
[51:18] the fearful, the foolish, the cow,
[51:23] that's what that word means.
[51:26] The fearful,
[51:28] the foolish, the cow,
[51:32] and they're unbelieving.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; So you see, cowardness is an attribute
[51:39] of uh of unbelief.
[51:42] When a person really don't believe God
[51:46] for who he is
[51:52] and is backing up on God's promises,
[51:57] &gt;&gt; then he's a cow.
[52:00] But the fearful,
[52:03] Amen.
[52:04] The fearful, the unbelieving, the
[52:06] abominable, the murderers, the
[52:08] homongers, the sorcerers, the
[52:10] idolattors, the liars
[52:13] shall have their part in the lake of
[52:15] fire. They'll have their part in the
[52:17] lake which burned with fire and
[52:20] brimstones, which is the second death.
[52:23] Praise the Lord.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; You see, so to the cow, there is no
[52:27] resurrection that is promised.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:30] So that's the reason why we want to nail
[52:32] the coward tonight.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; We want to deal with cowardness tonight.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And before you sit down, uh let's
[52:43] let's just read this together.
[52:46] Uh
[52:48] praise the Lord. Uh expectation.
[52:50] Expectation. And I was I was listening
[52:52] to this message and that's where I took
[52:54] my my mine uh my inspiration from
[52:58] tonight. The message expectation.
[53:00] Brother Brandham say he says we we are
[53:04] going towards the dark chamber.
[53:07] We are going towards the dark chamber.
[53:10] We were singing the song uh into the
[53:13] chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit
[53:16] speak to me gently as I close the door.
[53:21] But he's talking about a dark chamber
[53:23] here.
[53:25] We are going towards a dark chamber, a
[53:28] chamber of death.
[53:31] Everyone enter that chamber.
[53:34] And every time our heartbeat, we go one
[53:38] step closer.
[53:40] Some days I shall enter that chamber.
[53:44] And when I get down to the last habitat,
[53:49] I do not want to go in there as a cow.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go I don't want to face
[53:59] death as a cow.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; We are all going to die if Jesus tried.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; If he tries, we might go by the word of
[54:09] death.
[54:11] and uh and some will stay to be
[54:13] translated. Praise the Lord.
[54:17] But it won't change anything. Amen. For
[54:20] the believer, it will not change
[54:22] anything.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; If we drop dead here, we get our body
[54:26] changed. We step into a a founding body
[54:29] on the other side. And uh but the main
[54:33] thing here is how do we go towards that
[54:35] chamber? Brother Brandham says, "I do
[54:38] not want to go in there as a cow. I want
[54:42] to wrap myself in his righteousness.
[54:45] I want to pull it up around me and enter
[54:48] that chamber to know him in the power of
[54:53] his resurrection."
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Do you feel the same tonight?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You want to know him in the power of his
[54:58] resurrection?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Then let's say, "Come with me." Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you tonight. You
[55:03] may have your seat. The Lord bless you
[55:06] tonight. You may have your seat. Praise
[55:08] the Lord.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you if you take the the uh
[55:13] a little bit of a history back here and
[55:16] you look at the life of uh of Abna,
[55:20] Abnner was the captain of the army of
[55:23] Saul because he was a Benjamite.
[55:27] You see those days men would choose
[55:30] their general. Sometimes they are men
[55:33] from their family
[55:35] like uh Joab. Joab was uh he was a
[55:39] relative to David. He was related to
[55:42] David.
[55:44] And that's the same with Abna. Abna was
[55:46] the captain of Saul army and Joab was
[55:49] the captain of David's army. Amen. He
[55:53] was a captain of David's men. So uh uh
[55:57] uh that that is that is the picture
[55:58] here. But if you if you look at this
[56:01] character of this man David, you look at
[56:04] the character of this man David, you go
[56:06] back when David went down to the place
[56:08] where Saul was and and he was able to
[56:12] find himself in the in the in the in the
[56:15] in the in the cave and he caught Saul G.
[56:18] When he came up when he yelled, he he
[56:22] called Abnner. He says, "You are the
[56:25] captain. How did you manage that I was
[56:28] able to cut your master garment?
[56:32] Because you supposed to be protecting
[56:34] this man.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And and and and in a way it it was it
[56:42] was in one sense it was degrading but in
[56:45] another sense it was challenging because
[56:47] you have to remember that David
[56:50] respected Saul because he was an
[56:53] anointed of the Lord.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And touch not my anointing and do my
[57:00] prophet no harm. Praise the Lord. David
[57:03] said, you know, God God reminded Israel
[57:06] that all along traveling. So he kept
[57:08] that in his mind. He was not going to
[57:10] touch Saul. He was not going to kill
[57:12] Saul. But moreover, he was concerned
[57:15] that the man that's supposed to be the
[57:17] gatekeeper, the man that's supposed to
[57:19] be the the protector.
[57:22] Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. the captain of the guide.
[57:26] How did you manage that I enter? I went
[57:29] as close as to your master
[57:33] &gt;&gt; and I cut off his garment.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And then you remember when Saul and
[57:42] Jonathan died, David did not rejoice.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; There was a young man of uh of uh of uh
[57:49] the the Ammonites that was that was so
[57:51] foolish. He was trying to gain favor
[57:53] with David. He ran down into the camp
[57:55] and he says he's losing his birth. Oh
[57:59] yeah, David, I I came I brought you news
[58:02] and uh uh Saul and Jonathan is killed.
[58:05] He make up his own story for his own
[58:07] death.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; That was another cowardness.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; He died before his time
[58:15] &gt;&gt; because he was trying to gain the favor
[58:17] of a man that feared God.
[58:21] You can't you can't gain the favor of a
[58:23] man that fear God with sympathy.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; No.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; If you want that man's favor, fear God
[58:30] as well.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he came and and and
[58:34] told David, you know, and the battle was
[58:37] on and and you know, and Saul say I
[58:40] should kill him and I took the sword, I
[58:42] killed him and he just make up his own
[58:44] story,
[58:45] &gt;&gt; his own death sentence.
[58:49] And David asked him, "Who child are
[58:51] you?"
[58:52] Praise the Lord.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; He he he didn't even lie to say I of
[58:57] Benjamin
[58:58] &gt;&gt; or of Judah.
[59:01] He said I'm I'm an Ammonite.
[59:04] David said before my eyes b
[59:08] before I b my eyes, his hair should go
[59:11] off.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] and uh and and and the same cowardness
[59:20] was shown of of one of the servant of
[59:22] David. He did the same thing. He went
[59:23] and killed one of Saul's son and then
[59:25] came running to David bringing the head
[59:27] and and and and David had to kill him
[59:29] again. All of those things are
[59:31] cowardness.
[59:32] They are all cowardness.
[59:35] You die before your time when you are a
[59:38] coward.
[59:41] I love that. Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We want to talk about
[59:45] cowardness. You see when you talk about
[59:47] calness another thing that you talk
[59:50] about is courage.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The contr the the the contrary to be a
[59:57] cow is to be courageous is to be brave.
[1:00:00] So we we we want to expose cowardness
[1:00:03] tonight. We want to bully cowardness
[1:00:06] tonight. We want to rebuke cowardness
[1:00:09] tonight. And we want to say to the
[1:00:11] church be of a good chill. Amen. He
[1:00:14] said, "Because I have overcome the
[1:00:15] word."
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do tonight. Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So, we see here that Abnner was uh uh uh
[1:00:35] uh Saul captain. Let's let's go back to
[1:00:37] 2 Samuel chapter 3. 2 Samuel chapter 3.
[1:00:43] 2 Samuel chapter 3. Just look at verse
[1:00:46] one. And the Bible says, "Now there was
[1:00:48] a long war between the house of Saul and
[1:00:51] the house of David. But David walked
[1:00:55] stronger and stronger, and the house of
[1:00:57] Saul walks weaker and weaker." Praise
[1:00:59] the Lord.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So, so the house, so these two men, Abna
[1:01:04] and and Joah, you know, they were the
[1:01:06] men in the front of the battle. They
[1:01:08] were the men that were giving, you know,
[1:01:10] command. and they they they were the one
[1:01:12] that was instructing the battle.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here that after Saul
[1:01:22] died, uh, Abna was was was the chief in
[1:01:26] command. So, he had one of Saul's son to
[1:01:30] be the king. Are we together?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He had one of Saul's
[1:01:35] son to be the king. Now you see that is
[1:01:37] that is the place of the captain the
[1:01:39] commander of the army. He can either put
[1:01:42] one of the son of the king into power or
[1:01:45] he put himself into power.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That was just how those men were
[1:01:50] trusted.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; That was that was just how they were
[1:01:56] trusted. They were they they had they
[1:01:58] had they had so much command under their
[1:02:01] belt.
[1:02:02] Praise the Lord. So we see here that uh
[1:02:06] uh after Saul and Jonathan died uh
[1:02:10] Abnner knew Abna knew if you read you
[1:02:14] were here he he even told the son of
[1:02:16] Saul he says he says if I can turn the
[1:02:19] kingdom over to David because you know
[1:02:21] there was a prophecy
[1:02:24] there was a prophecy after David killed
[1:02:27] Goliath we all knew
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; that this is the next king.
[1:02:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "We all knew that this man was
[1:02:38] the next king
[1:02:40] because if he never rose to the
[1:02:43] challenge to kill uh Goliath, we all
[1:02:45] would be under the Philistines. So we
[1:02:48] know
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; we were just we were just applying our
[1:02:53] loyalty to your father."
[1:02:58] So he came to meet David
[1:03:00] and he told David, you know what? I'm
[1:03:03] ready to turn the kingdom over to you.
[1:03:05] If you're ready to work with me, I'm
[1:03:07] ready to turn the kingdom over to you
[1:03:08] because all the heart of Israel is after
[1:03:11] you.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But just before that,
[1:03:17] just before that h they came, he and Jo,
[1:03:23] they were on both sides and uh they they
[1:03:26] came to a field and it says, "Let the
[1:03:28] young men play." My goodness, I don't
[1:03:30] know what kind of a play is that they
[1:03:32] put the young soldiers in the ring, they
[1:03:34] took their sword, you know, and they
[1:03:36] play with it, chop one another head,
[1:03:38] punch one another in the stomach. What
[1:03:40] kind of a play is that?
[1:03:43] and uh and and the young men they killed
[1:03:44] themselves right in the field. They were
[1:03:47] trying their strength, the strength of
[1:03:50] war. And then right after that, the
[1:03:53] brother
[1:03:55] of uh of uh uh of of Abna Asahel, he ran
[1:04:01] after he ran after the the brother of
[1:04:04] Joab. Sorry, the brother of Joab asel.
[1:04:07] He ran after Abnner
[1:04:10] and he started chasing Abna. And when he
[1:04:13] looked behind, he saw him. He says, he
[1:04:15] said, "Young man, you turn around. Stop.
[1:04:17] Stop making me to go out of breath.
[1:04:21] Stop. Stop what you are doing. You see,
[1:04:24] because these men that were captains,
[1:04:27] they were not Je choosing captain just
[1:04:29] because of favoritism.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; They were men that were brave.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; They were men that knew how to fight.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; We would call them gorilla fighters.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Little boy, stop what you
[1:04:47] were doing. I I don't want I don't want
[1:04:48] uh and and and and and Abisha was still
[1:04:51] running after him and this old man is
[1:04:53] losing his birth stop what you are doing
[1:04:56] and you know and he felt threatening and
[1:04:58] he killed him but that was the younger
[1:05:00] brother of Joab. So a kind of a role a a
[1:05:03] it brought rage in the heart of Joab
[1:05:06] also he wanted to revenge
[1:05:09] but why he was away now has come and
[1:05:11] talked to David and David says well you
[1:05:14] go and do whatever you want to do if you
[1:05:16] turn the people over I will become the
[1:05:18] king of all Israel
[1:05:20] praise the Lord
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; and then on his way he met Joab
[1:05:28] and the people told Joab oh yeah Abda
[1:05:30] was here, you know, and uh and uh uh uh
[1:05:34] uh and he and he and David how to talk.
[1:05:37] So, I'm not talking personally why the
[1:05:39] king never arrested this man. This man
[1:05:42] uh fought against us. This man was
[1:05:44] seeking your life and then moreover,
[1:05:47] this is the man that killed my brother.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; But you see that that uh that honor that
[1:05:57] God gave David was an everlasting honor.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Whose heart?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That was just that was just David. Yeah.
[1:06:13] I mean, if if if he's going to save the
[1:06:15] people, if they are going to surround
[1:06:17] us, that's that's okay. Amen.
[1:06:20] If I did not kill Saul uh h
[1:06:24] and I had the opportunity told I did not
[1:06:27] rejoice at his death, why will I rejoice
[1:06:30] at the death of Abna?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; A man that revealed the heart of God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; A man whose heart
[1:06:46] was moved.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:50] Amen.
[1:06:52] So the the the Bible would tell us there
[1:06:55] now and then and Joab heard that he ran
[1:06:57] after Abna. He called Abna
[1:07:00] you know as a friend to Abna. Now now he
[1:07:04] has just talked to David and everything
[1:07:06] is okay. So if David captain is calling
[1:07:10] him he's not going to fight because he
[1:07:12] have already settled thing with David.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; According to him I'm going to turn the
[1:07:17] kingdom over to David. We all Israel
[1:07:20] going to be one. It's not going to be
[1:07:22] Israel and Judah. We are all going to be
[1:07:24] one and we will all serve. I I will even
[1:07:26] get in the army. I can self honor Joab.
[1:07:30] So when Joab called him, he felt like
[1:07:32] the new commander is calling in. Let me
[1:07:34] surround myself. And when he came, he
[1:07:37] never even defended himself. That's what
[1:07:40] that's what David was lamenting. Your
[1:07:42] hands were not tied.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Your feet were not in feathers. They
[1:07:47] never put it in chains. You mean you
[1:07:49] couldn't fight?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You couldn't even give a fight.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; You couldn't give a fight.
[1:07:59] That's what we are talking about
[1:08:01] tonight.
[1:08:03] You mean you just you will just
[1:08:04] surrender
[1:08:06] to whatever you are dealing with.
[1:08:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; After you know that it is not for your
[1:08:13] good.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. After you know that it is it's not
[1:08:18] the Holy Ghost that is working in your
[1:08:20] body. It's not the Holy Ghost that is
[1:08:22] working in your mind. It's not the Holy
[1:08:24] Ghost that is giving you that desire.
[1:08:26] You will just surrender.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Your hands are not tied. You can't lift
[1:08:31] your hands and praise God.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Your feet are not bound. You can't stand
[1:08:35] up and jump and say praise God.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will just sit there and the
[1:08:44] devil will just keep doozing you on your
[1:08:46] head,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; slapping you in the face
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; as if you don't have a living God.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You don't have a book full of promises.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; There is not one promise you can find in
[1:08:57] this book.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And show it to the devil.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And you will die like a fool.
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; David cried. He wept.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, David could say, "If there was
[1:09:18] one man that gave me hard time in battle
[1:09:20] was Adna."
[1:09:22] He knew how to fight because the
[1:09:24] Benjamins, they were left-handed.
[1:09:27] And there were people that were good in
[1:09:29] bow and arrow. According to the
[1:09:32] scripture,
[1:09:33] they were left-handed and they were very
[1:09:35] good in shooting bow and arrow.
[1:09:38] They knew how to fight.
[1:09:41] So when David think about how how easy
[1:09:45] it was not even war. We were not
[1:09:46] fighting war to say Joab and I'm that
[1:09:50] troop were fighting against one another.
[1:09:52] It was not war.
[1:09:54] You just stand there like a statue.
[1:10:00] Oh abna.
[1:10:04] Why you die like a fool? You die like a
[1:10:08] coward.
[1:10:09] You die like a man that have never been
[1:10:11] in battle.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; When you come from one battle, it must
[1:10:16] encourage you to be able to fight the
[1:10:18] next battle.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Because we know that we we are not in a
[1:10:28] picnic.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We are on a battlefield.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You don't look for a come after you.
[1:10:36] Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; The same way Jesus said this son shall
[1:10:39] follow you, the devil said this trouble
[1:10:41] will follow you also.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; It depends on which one you embrace.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; The devil swear that these troubles will
[1:10:51] follow you, these affections will follow
[1:10:53] you, these sicknesses will follow you.
[1:10:55] Praise the Lord. But you can give him a
[1:10:57] border.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You can raise a war
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; and say when the enemy come as a flaw,
[1:11:03] the Lord will raise up a standard. Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And I will hide myself behind that
[1:11:09] standard.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; I know we all will die.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; But I will not die without a fight.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; I will not die without a fight.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; If you come and see my dear body, my
[1:11:23] teeth is together like this, you must
[1:11:25] realize that this guy fought.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You must say he fought. Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you tell those undertaker to
[1:11:34] leave my teeth like that. Let everybody
[1:11:36] know I'm a fighter.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Am I scaring you?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz uh please uh I'm serious
[1:12:00] tonight.
[1:12:02] Amen.
[1:12:04] I'm serious tonight because you see uh
[1:12:08] brother Brandham said this in the in the
[1:12:10] message flashing red light. Uh you know
[1:12:13] he talked about the the ugliness of the
[1:12:16] age and he said this he says well it's
[1:12:19] such uh conglomerations of rottiness
[1:12:23] until it it produce a bunch of soft lazy
[1:12:28] no good hellbound generation.
[1:12:32] We have a generation that don't know how
[1:12:34] to fight.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; We have a generation that don't know how
[1:12:41] to fight. I was looking at a little clip
[1:12:44] of a of a slave mother that was talking
[1:12:46] and says in those days when when we got
[1:12:48] a cut, he she said it if it was a bar
[1:12:51] cut on the hand and we did not have
[1:12:54] treatment. And she says what we what we
[1:12:55] do is that we go in the bound and we
[1:12:58] look for the the the uh uh uh the spider
[1:13:03] web. She said we look for she said we
[1:13:06] look for the spider web and and we take
[1:13:09] those web of the spatter and we spray it
[1:13:11] in the c. See a person will be will will
[1:13:15] be bleeding we will we will clean the c
[1:13:17] and we we take the spider web and we
[1:13:19] spray it in the c. She says that web ser
[1:13:23] like a stitching.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Says she said medical science today will
[1:13:30] look at us and think that we are
[1:13:32] foolish.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; She said but we improvise with what we
[1:13:36] had.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That was a generation
[1:13:40] that knew how to fight.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; They just don't cry, oh my soul, I'm
[1:13:44] bleeding. They do something about it.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; They just don't cry. Mhm.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my soul, oh my my my my father, oh my
[1:13:53] house, oh my family, all my No, they do
[1:13:56] something about it.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] living in such a hu
[1:14:20] a lazy generation
[1:14:22] people just gave up so easily sometime
[1:14:25] gave up for nothing
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; for nothing they just gave up they just
[1:14:30] throw in the tow I can't do this again
[1:14:32] you can't do it who will do it who
[1:14:34] should do it
[1:14:39] praise the lord
[1:14:42] And I believe when you read the book of
[1:14:45] of of Ecclesiastics, I believe that's
[1:14:48] that's the kind of a person that uh that
[1:14:50] that that Solomon was talking about, the
[1:14:52] fool, the wicked.
[1:14:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:58] Because you see brother Brandham say in
[1:15:00] the message expression he says many
[1:15:02] times it have been said that a person
[1:15:04] died prematurely or something uh uh uh
[1:15:08] that maybe some sin the date they did uh
[1:15:12] they did something wrong. He says that
[1:15:15] isn't a case to a Christian. Praise the
[1:15:18] Lord. He says it's not a case to a
[1:15:20] Christian to say that they die before
[1:15:23] their time. know it's not a case to a
[1:15:25] believer.
[1:15:28] Are we together?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Because I believe that a believer with
[1:15:33] all the promises that is in this book
[1:15:35] must not die like a coward.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; We have something to fight for.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; There is something to fight for.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you don't have one,
[1:15:50] look for one because it's there.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It's right there. is staring right in
[1:15:54] your eyes. You are behaving as if you
[1:15:56] are not saying it.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are complaining
[1:16:00] about it
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; when you need to be fighting.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; You need to be You need to be fighting.
[1:16:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:15] Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] Where are the fighters? You know where
[1:16:24] are the fighters?
[1:16:27] Oh my.
[1:16:29] Oh my. We know that um this is this is a
[1:16:32] old statement. You know uh a cow died
[1:16:35] many times before their death is a old
[1:16:37] statement. Actually it came out of a
[1:16:40] Shakespeare play. You know Julius Caesar
[1:16:44] was the one that made that statement.
[1:16:46] But it it kind of was stow out.
[1:16:49] It stole out most of the time when
[1:16:52] people, you know, when people complain,
[1:16:56] when people make excuses
[1:16:59] for things that they can deal with,
[1:17:01] things they can do.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; They come up with just flucent excuses.
[1:17:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; And uh they just they just they want
[1:17:12] they just want to pull it on God, you
[1:17:14] know. Uh uh well it's the word of God.
[1:17:16] Uh uh some sometimes it's not.
[1:17:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Because if you take the promise of God
[1:17:24] and you and and and you approach that
[1:17:27] thing, God can change it around.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] He always speak to those who are fearful
[1:17:42] and avoid challenge experiences
[1:17:46] uh
[1:17:50] the anxieties and emotional pain of
[1:17:54] potential failure or harm repeatedly.
[1:17:56] Why those who are brave face difficult
[1:17:59] situation and they go right on. Praise
[1:18:02] the Lord.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; They go they face difficult situation
[1:18:05] but yet they keep their heads high up.
[1:18:08] They have a song. They have a smile on
[1:18:10] their face.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; They have a smile on their face and they
[1:18:18] praising God. They are thanking God for
[1:18:21] for for for his goodness.
[1:18:30] And you find you find people like that
[1:18:32] all through the scripture. Look at the
[1:18:34] husband of Abigail.
[1:18:37] Amen. The Bible says the man by by by
[1:18:41] name is even called a fool.
[1:18:45] His name is means a fool.
[1:18:49] It just don't means that he's foolish.
[1:18:51] It means that he's a cow.
[1:18:54] Praise the Lord. See, this man was he
[1:18:57] was so blessed.
[1:19:00] He was he was he was in the wealth of
[1:19:02] his farm, his sheep, and everything
[1:19:04] there.
[1:19:08] And you know what the story is? The
[1:19:10] Bible says and David and his men you
[1:19:12] know that they make their tent by by by
[1:19:15] you know by by his farm and never even
[1:19:18] never even harm anything. But because of
[1:19:21] their presence the Philistines could not
[1:19:24] come and invade his farm. Praise the
[1:19:27] Lord.
[1:19:29] Just because they knew that David and
[1:19:31] his men were in that area. So I mean
[1:19:33] they were not even paying this man even
[1:19:36] though David was running away from Saul
[1:19:39] but yet the Philistines knew the name
[1:19:41] David. Praise the Lord. All the armies
[1:19:45] around when they hear David they knew
[1:19:48] that that was Israel army. They were not
[1:19:50] even thinking about Saul and Abna and
[1:19:52] their army. They all they have to hear
[1:19:54] David and his men.
[1:19:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] So when one of the worker went and told
[1:20:03] Abigail, she came there and uh uh uh you
[1:20:07] know, she knelt down and said, "Oh, oh
[1:20:09] my lord, David, I never knew that you
[1:20:11] and your men were here. If we knew we
[1:20:13] were going to feed you dearly, we were
[1:20:15] going to, you know, supply everything
[1:20:17] that you need. Oh, I mean such a way
[1:20:20] that she she I mean she just uh make a
[1:20:23] plea to David
[1:20:25] and she went back and told her husband.
[1:20:29] Praise the Lord. And what did he said?
[1:20:33] Oh, David just running away from Saul.
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] Those are the kind of people they don't
[1:20:40] work. They want for people to jet feed
[1:20:42] him.
[1:20:44] He was supposed to be working with sword
[1:20:46] and he running away all over the place
[1:20:47] and hiding on people farm.
[1:20:50] I should come and give mine uh uh my my
[1:20:54] ghost to him. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You see his his uh his wealth has
[1:21:07] entered his head.
[1:21:10] the few sheeps and few farms that he
[1:21:13] had, it has entered his head and he he's
[1:21:16] he's now watching his mouth.
[1:21:20] Drink some wine and is all in his eyes
[1:21:23] is I mean his stomach has got so big
[1:21:26] that is leading him.
[1:21:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And he just open his mouth and just talk
[1:21:34] to people anyhow
[1:21:38] to him now he has arrived. He's one of
[1:21:40] the rich man in Israel.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; He can count all the things he have done
[1:21:44] by his hands.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; That's what Solomon said in in
[1:21:47] Ecclesiastic. He said it's it's vanity.
[1:21:49] It's the way of a food. It's a way of a
[1:21:51] cow.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And what will happen is that you will
[1:21:54] labor and other men will come and enjoy
[1:21:56] your labor.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Because wisdom is not applied to it.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Those are some of the things that
[1:22:05] Solomon is dealing with in the book of
[1:22:07] Ecclesiastic
[1:22:09] when he say vanity, vanity. These things
[1:22:11] I have seen under the sun. How men has
[1:22:14] labored and labored and labored and
[1:22:15] labor
[1:22:21] because it's cowardness.
[1:22:24] Most of they are the men they are men
[1:22:27] that are trusting in uh in in their
[1:22:29] muscles. They are trusting in their
[1:22:31] ability.
[1:22:33] They are making name for themselves and
[1:22:34] not making the lost name.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Let God give you a name.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look for one.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Because he's a name giver.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; He told David, I will give you a name.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; He did not change David name but he gave
[1:22:51] him a name.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; He magnified his name.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He associated with David's name.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:02] He was a cow.
[1:23:07] The Bible says that very night
[1:23:10] that he opened his mouth against the
[1:23:13] anointed of the Lord, the death angel
[1:23:15] came and pack him home.
[1:23:18] The Bible says David said, "Thank you,
[1:23:20] Lord. You saved my hands from blood
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; because I will have killed him for his
[1:23:25] foolishness
[1:23:27] and I will always remember that I killed
[1:23:29] him." But let his own foolishness kill
[1:23:32] him. Let he die before his time because
[1:23:35] that's cowardness.
[1:23:37] Praise the Lord. When people are so so
[1:23:40] in their in in in their arrogancy is
[1:23:43] cowardness.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; When we when we believe in our proud and
[1:23:47] we believe in our in in in what we it's
[1:23:50] cowardness
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; because when God take your birth one
[1:23:54] thing it will just be zero. No matter
[1:23:57] your muscle mass, no matter your weight,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; if that breath of life leaves you, you
[1:24:02] hit this ground and you gone.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; That's cowardness.
[1:24:19] If you if you know the story of Aito
[1:24:22] also a man the Bible say this man was so
[1:24:25] wise. He has such a gift. He will give
[1:24:30] he will set you down and give you advice
[1:24:32] and it will come to pass just like he
[1:24:34] said it. When David is going to war
[1:24:37] David will call him into the cabinet.
[1:24:39] When everybody talk he will says what
[1:24:41] did you what you think are he talking?
[1:24:43] He will say, "No, David, let now the man
[1:24:45] go this way." I advise let them go this
[1:24:49] way because early in the morning, the
[1:24:50] enemy will come and just like that it
[1:24:52] will happen.
[1:24:54] That's just such a gift that he had.
[1:24:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; But when he when he went, he joined
[1:25:02] himself to Abselon, David's son, when
[1:25:05] David was kicked off the throne.
[1:25:09] And now Abselon called him into meeting
[1:25:11] because Abselon knew that this man you
[1:25:13] knowh he was a blessing to his father.
[1:25:16] So he called him into meeting and
[1:25:17] everybody talk
[1:25:21] and I talk and advised them and says you
[1:25:23] know your father Abselon he's a man of
[1:25:25] war. He's not going to be down there.
[1:25:27] He's going to be this way. So let the
[1:25:29] army go this way. But David has David
[1:25:32] knew he knew that if I give a counsel
[1:25:36] they will grab him. So what he did, he
[1:25:39] sent another man into the camp.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; After a Toher gave his counsel, this man
[1:25:45] came and said, "Look, I I saw David and
[1:25:47] his men. They will not be down there.
[1:25:49] They will be here." He turned the
[1:25:51] council of Aito to around.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; You know that's why brother Brandham
[1:26:00] says to overcome, you must understand
[1:26:02] the tricks of the enemy.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we are in a
[1:26:06] warfare. You must understand the tricks
[1:26:09] of the enemy. You must understand your
[1:26:11] body.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; You must understand your mind.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Tell your body just from eating. Why you
[1:26:23] behaving as if to say you have not eat
[1:26:25] this morning?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; All you want to do is just eating,
[1:26:27] eating, eating, eating.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You must speak to it
[1:26:34] sometimes.
[1:26:37] He turned the council of Aayito around
[1:26:43] and the battle went against Abselon.
[1:26:46] And when I heard it, he went and hang
[1:26:50] himself. That was a coward
[1:26:55] because he felt like I have never failed
[1:26:58] before.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I have never given a counsel and he has
[1:27:02] ever failed. If you are a human, you
[1:27:04] will always fail. You were born a
[1:27:06] failure and if God don't help you, you
[1:27:08] die a failure.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; When we fail, we must be humble and come
[1:27:14] back to the Lord and say, "Lord, be
[1:27:16] merciful to me. I make this choice. It
[1:27:18] was wrong.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; We must get a repented heart.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; You can't hold yourself before God and
[1:27:24] be justified."
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, I never make mistake before. You
[1:27:28] You deceive me. Lord, Lord, you you Who
[1:27:32] are you?
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:27:34] just a vapor and you are gone.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; We will not even remember you.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Because the only thing we remember is
[1:27:42] the things that people do for the Lord.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that live after them.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; It's not your names.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It's not your height, your weight.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He died like a cow.
[1:28:02] He should have waited and said, "What
[1:28:05] went wrong?
[1:28:07] What went wrong?"
[1:28:09] He should have asked the man, "Did you
[1:28:12] people follow my counsel?" He never
[1:28:14] waited for that. He just went and hank
[1:28:17] himself.
[1:28:20] He went and he hang himself.
[1:28:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; There was a whole lot to that though.
[1:28:27] There's a whole lot to that. I don't
[1:28:29] want to go into that because if you sell
[1:28:31] it the background that man ah was
[1:28:35] related to Urias.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; So his council of killing David was like
[1:28:46] a revenge for Urias.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; But let's get into our subject tonight.
[1:28:52] Just trying to give you example
[1:28:55] of men that die before their time.
[1:28:59] Not really in a sense that they die
[1:29:01] before their time, but they die like a
[1:29:03] cow. And it's only a cow that die
[1:29:06] thousand times before he time before his
[1:29:09] time.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Because even before death reach you, the
[1:29:14] fear will kill you.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "She that liveth in
[1:29:20] pleasure is there while she live."
[1:29:21] That's that's a life of coward.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's cowardness.
[1:29:28] Any life without God in it is
[1:29:29] cowardness. It don't have a value.
[1:29:34] Praise the Lord. It don't have a good
[1:29:37] expiring date. It will expire at any
[1:29:40] time.
[1:29:43] Hallelujah.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; See what brother Bon says here. God's
[1:29:51] covenant with Abraham. He says uh
[1:29:56] he took the father word and defeated
[1:29:59] Satan right on his own ground. That
[1:30:02] Matthew chapter 4 Jesus in on on the
[1:30:05] mountain of temptation he defeated the
[1:30:07] devil on his own ground. He said yeah uh
[1:30:11] uh what did he do? He he was proving to
[1:30:14] the weakest of Christian that you can
[1:30:17] defeat Satan any word any time
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; on the plain word of God. Amen.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for some kind of
[1:30:27] a crafty thing to say. You don't have to
[1:30:29] pick up some kind of a Pentecostal, you
[1:30:32] know, h slogan. You can just I am the
[1:30:37] Lord that healeth all your diseases.
[1:30:39] Just the plain word of God. Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make it to sound like
[1:30:43] you're so spiritual. Just the plain word
[1:30:45] of God.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You see, and that's the reason why when
[1:30:48] we learn to memorize scripture, it help
[1:30:50] us sometime because it's just the plain
[1:30:52] word of God.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes when we paraphrasing
[1:30:58] it, we start to say some things that the
[1:30:59] Bible never say
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; and you say the Bible said. Don't make
[1:31:03] God alive.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] He was proving that the weakest of
[1:31:13] Christian, no matter what state you are
[1:31:15] in
[1:31:17] no matter how how weak you are, you can
[1:31:20] still fight.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You might not have a strength to throw a
[1:31:24] hand.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You might not have a strength to sing a
[1:31:27] song,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; but you can reverse back to a promise in
[1:31:30] this book.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You can rehearse it in your heart.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; When there is no strength to say Jesus,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; you can say it in your stomach. Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; You can say it in your mind. It will say
[1:31:42] have the same strength.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; You can keep saying Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[1:31:48] Jesus. It will have the same strength as
[1:31:50] somebody that is saying Jesus from on
[1:31:53] top of the hill.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] The weakest of Christians
[1:32:04] can defeat Satan any time
[1:32:08] on the plain word of God. Just take it
[1:32:11] and says, "Thus say the Lord, it is
[1:32:13] written."
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Says, "Satan, it is written,
[1:32:18] greater is he that is in me
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the word." Praise the
[1:32:22] Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Satan is written that he is the alpha
[1:32:26] and omega.
[1:32:29] Hallelujah.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Satan is writing that the son of
[1:32:33] righteousness will rise with healing in
[1:32:35] his wings.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to cook it with anything.

[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Praise. Let's let some blood be in it.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] Sometime we roast it and we roast all
[1:32:57] the blood out.
[1:32:59] Okay, let's let's go ahead here now.
[1:33:02] Uh,
[1:33:04] thou said the Lord, it is written.
[1:33:07] He says, "Thou takes all the cowness out
[1:33:10] of the church."
[1:33:15] It takes all the cowness out of the
[1:33:18] church. It takes the washbone out and
[1:33:21] put a backbone in there.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; People say now what what are you wishing
[1:33:27] about? No witching. God promised it and
[1:33:31] so and it's so. Amen.

[1:33:36] Sunday and I repeated that. Amen. I know
[1:33:39] you know sometimes when you have in a
[1:33:40] preacher preaching preaching with a
[1:33:42] translator if if the if the if the
[1:33:45] church is not used to that sometime you

[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially when the person say I'm
[1:34:22] coming.

[1:34:25] time. It even make you nervous.

[1:34:36] start cleaning the house. you go, you
[1:34:37] start uh buying food and uh finally you
[1:34:40] look through the window, you look at

[1:34:53] condition you.

[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, uh uh please let me
[1:35:01] know when you are coming." And you look
[1:35:03] at your phone, no respond. He's not even
[1:35:04] responding. I don't even know if he's on
[1:35:06] his way. Maybe he's driving. I don't
[1:35:08] know. Maybe he's in the traffic.
[1:35:11] It condition you.
[1:35:13] It put you in a place. So, so that's
[1:35:16] what brother Brandham is saying. He says
[1:35:18] God has given us a promise. So, we don't
[1:35:20] need to be wishing.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; I wish it happened.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I wish I was this. No, you don't need it
[1:35:26] because you have a promise.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; You can get a good meal beside a
[1:35:35] sandwich.
[1:35:36] That's right.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "You don't need to be
[1:35:42] wishing this." And uh he says, "Uh God
[1:35:45] promised it and and sold." He says, "Uh
[1:35:47] we we we get a meeting staring like that
[1:35:50] and we could have a healing service get
[1:35:53] started. When you get to some of that,
[1:35:56] when you take that, oh wish, I wish I
[1:35:58] could." No wishing or nothing about it.
[1:36:01] God gave the promise and that settle it.
[1:36:04] When God says anything is wrote in
[1:36:07] heaven and that makes it good forever.
[1:36:10] Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; That makes it good forever.
[1:36:18] You see where where
[1:36:21] God put the fear for
[1:36:24] those that are fearing
[1:36:28] quick to be afraid. we get into a panic
[1:36:32] or our faith is is quick to be out of
[1:36:34] the window.
[1:36:36] This little crisis come in hand. Our
[1:36:38] faith goes out of the window. And let me
[1:36:41] tell you, let me tell you something.
[1:36:43] When you are uh the the thing that gives
[1:36:45] you the the the character to behave,
[1:36:49] the things that puts you under control,
[1:36:52] it gives you the right behavior, the
[1:36:55] right attitude is is the promise of God.
[1:36:59] Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It's when you are believing that God
[1:37:02] will do it.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; When your faith goes out of the window,
[1:37:06] your attitude will change.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You can become rude. You don't get
[1:37:12] control. You don't have respect.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; It's faith that gave you respect.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; When people lose faith,
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; they become now they can say anything.
[1:37:27] They can blasphe without fear,
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Not without fear,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; but they are driven by fear.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; When you see people behaving like that,
[1:37:39] it's fear that is behind it.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes they just want for
[1:37:44] God to kill them so everything can end.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But God don't work on your feelings.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He will make you come from out of it.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Count to yourself.
[1:37:57] get sober.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Then he wait for you now to choose what
[1:38:02] to do.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; That's how people behave sometimes. They
[1:38:08] get so unruly. All they thinking in
[1:38:10] their mind now, you know, judgment will
[1:38:12] fall, fire will fall from God will just
[1:38:15] sit there and look at you.
[1:38:19] You you do all your misbehaving,
[1:38:23] do everything
[1:38:25] and then you get sober. Then it starts
[1:38:27] to rain down on you. What have I done?
[1:38:31] What did I use my mouth to say?
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And even they will not come seeking God
[1:38:40] and crying to God. They wanted you to
[1:38:42] come and beg them. Brother, can sister,
[1:38:44] can you make your life right? Please can
[1:38:46] you tell God to to forgive you? Do you
[1:38:48] want us to beg you?
[1:38:51] Who was energizing you to say those
[1:38:52] things?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; It's fear.
[1:39:00] Many times it's fear.
[1:39:04] Fear is an unruly force.
[1:39:08] Faith can be governed
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; because faith is governed by the word
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; but fear is unruly. That's the reason
[1:39:17] why it can destabilize your mind. It
[1:39:20] destabilize your your everything you are
[1:39:22] doing because you are afraid.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; It can destabilize your health
[1:39:30] and that's cowardness.
[1:39:36] That's cowardness.
[1:39:38] I mean after after everything
[1:39:42] that you have gone through then you say
[1:39:44] I don't know what to do really
[1:39:48] you mean till your age at this time
[1:39:52] when you see the word in it in its
[1:39:54] condition and what is happening
[1:39:59] I don't know what to do is should that
[1:40:01] be your your your your language
[1:40:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.

[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And that's not what God want for his
[1:40:24] church. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not that's not what he want
[1:40:29] for his church. Do you do you remember
[1:40:31] right there in the book of Kings, you
[1:40:33] know, this prophet came out and
[1:40:35] prophesied that tomorrow, he said,
[1:40:37] "Tomorrow God is going to bless." He
[1:40:40] said, "There is going to be a pouring of
[1:40:43] of of of food that that that flour will
[1:40:47] be sell so cheap. You will have so
[1:40:49] much."
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; There was one cow in the midst. He says,
[1:40:54] "Uh, he called himself Ben." He says, he
[1:40:57] says, uh, I don't see how this is going
[1:41:00] to happen. Amen. It's the same people
[1:41:03] that that says, I don't see, I don't see
[1:41:05] what is happening in this church.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I don't see what is happening.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, I don't see how this
[1:41:17] is going to happen. The prophet said,
[1:41:20] you will see it with your eyes.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; You will see it with your eyes. You will
[1:41:25] hear it by the hearing. You will see it
[1:41:27] with your eyes but you it will never
[1:41:28] touch your tongue.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a coward.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You can you cannot defy doubt. Said the
[1:41:38] Lord.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; If God said he will get a church without
[1:41:41] spot wrinkle. I don't care whether you
[1:41:44] see it or not.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you see it. I don't
[1:41:47] care whether you believe it.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; because you can't defy thou said the
[1:41:56] Lord.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; For you to defy thou said the Lord is to
[1:42:01] defy your existence because your very
[1:42:03] existence is the spoken word of God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; The very existence of this word God
[1:42:08] spoke it into existence. It was thou
[1:42:11] said the Lord that brought it to pass.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; So you know what God would do? There was
[1:42:16] farming in the land. Farming everywhere.
[1:42:20] God took some lepers that had courage.

[1:42:25] die.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just go in the town. Let them kill
[1:42:28] us." Lord,

[1:42:53] pack and leave." Everybody started
[1:42:55] running to the village, running in the
[1:42:56] bush. The lepros came. They see
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; somebody was doing barbecue.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; They left the barbecue and they run in
[1:43:05] the bush.

[1:43:38] they they don't like us lepros, we are
[1:43:40] despised. But let's stand on the
[1:43:42] mountain and shout and tell them there
[1:43:44] is food.

[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And you know when they said there is
[1:43:50] food, you know who started running? Ben
[1:43:52] Heidi. He was the first one. He jumped
[1:43:54] to the gate and started running. Started
[1:43:58] running. The Bible says and he stormed
[1:44:00] his legs and fell and the people walked
[1:44:02] over him
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; because that doubt said the Lord. Praise
[1:44:07] the Lord.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Cowards do not enjoy the blessing.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Brave and courageous people.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; They are the one that see the word of
[1:44:14] God coming to pass. They are the one
[1:44:16] that enjoy the blessing.

[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Let's read this. Brother Bam says here
[1:45:56] take take on the whole armor of God. He
[1:45:59] says the Christian church is is an army
[1:46:01] of God.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He said it's an army of God. We are
[1:46:07] soldiers. Soldiers of the cross
[1:46:10] and it is the business of every nation
[1:46:13] to see that their soldiers has the best
[1:46:18] there is.
[1:46:20] Praise the Lord. He says, "I was
[1:46:22] preaching the other night about
[1:46:24] achievement
[1:46:27] uh at another meeting somewhere. I
[1:46:29] talked about the American soldier." He
[1:46:31] says, "Uh uh uh when Washington was at
[1:46:35] Valley Fort uh about half of them had
[1:46:39] shoes on, which mean the rest of them,
[1:46:41] they were barefooted,
[1:46:43] but they had a general that prayed all
[1:46:46] night. He swept across the Delaware the
[1:46:49] next day. That's why we got America.
[1:46:52] Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Because there were men that knew how to
[1:46:57] fight.
[1:46:58] They were men that knew how to fight.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what God has raised us up for
[1:47:06] this for this hour is to fight.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Because we cannot be overcomer without a
[1:47:13] fight.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; You cannot overcome without a fight.
[1:47:18] Sometimes you got to fight your own
[1:47:19] ideas.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; You got to fight your own thoughts, your
[1:47:22] own desires. You got to fight it. That's
[1:47:25] what Jesus did. Not my will, but your
[1:47:27] will, Lord.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Let it be done.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; How can how can the people be there? You
[1:47:38] you sitting down there and and and and
[1:47:40] the promises of God don't excite you.
[1:47:42] Sure.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; They are reading the promises of God to
[1:47:45] you
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; and you are not excited.

[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; If we are if if if we get into the
[1:48:12] fight, praise the Lord.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Every promise becomes an armor to the
[1:48:18] church.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what excite fighters.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; That's what excite fighters.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; When when when the Americans send an
[1:48:30] ammunation to to the Ukrainian, they are
[1:48:33] excited.
[1:48:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; They know that if they die, they are
[1:48:38] dying for their freedom.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; So every time a promise of God is given
[1:48:47] to the church, it must excite the
[1:48:50] church.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; The the the the the Lord says this in
[1:48:55] his word. The apostle Paul said, Peter
[1:48:57] said, John said, brother Brandham said,
[1:48:59] it must excite us.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] We can't just sit there and expect that,
[1:49:06] you know, you know, go God has already
[1:49:08] given his word.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; It's for us to take it.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; We must be able to take it. Take the
[1:49:14] book and eat it.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Let's take the book and eat it.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; We're not a denomination church where I
[1:49:27] mean the preacher must come and be
[1:49:29] begging you to say amen. Let a church
[1:49:31] say amen. Let a church say amen. just to
[1:49:33] get you excited.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; The word must get you excited.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus said h you know h
[1:49:46] don't rejoice because uh uh you get
[1:49:48] healing and miracle. He said rejoice
[1:49:50] because your name is in the book. Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; There is something when the word comes
[1:49:56] rejoicing the among the people,
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; the people that are enjoying the
[1:49:59] promises, they are happy. They are
[1:50:01] ready. But it it looks like the people
[1:50:03] are just ready to show up to church and
[1:50:05] they're ready to go back home.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; It looks like our attitude sometimes
[1:50:10] just show like, "Hey, my friend, shut up
[1:50:11] and let's go home."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:21] When we supposed to make the best of the
[1:50:23] few minutes we come and spend together,
[1:50:25] we we we made the best. You know,
[1:50:27] sometimes it's like that. You know, the
[1:50:28] people says, "Well, we guess who
[1:50:29] excited." You know, the preacher preach
[1:50:31] long.
[1:50:36] It looks like when we get excited, the
[1:50:38] guy preach long. He don't they don't
[1:50:40] stop so easy,
[1:50:44] you know. But brother Bam says it's just
[1:50:46] like a hunting dog. That's all you're
[1:50:48] doing.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Because what we doing, we're chasing
[1:50:51] spirits.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're trying to do
[1:50:54] tonight. We are coming against
[1:50:55] cowardness.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; We are coming against a spirit of fear.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; We are coming against a spirit that
[1:51:01] makes people to just fold their hands.
[1:51:03] The spirit that makes you sorrowful.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; As if to say your God is dead.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's why we are coming again. We're
[1:51:10] coming against that spirit tonight.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Because it's the spirit that want to
[1:51:15] kill you before your time. It want to
[1:51:18] kill your zeal.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; It want to kill your knowledge for the
[1:51:21] Lord,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; your love for God. They want to kill it.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; The devil don't mind if you come and sit
[1:51:27] in church and sleep. He don't mind.
[1:51:29] That's the kind of a person he want in
[1:51:31] church.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "That's why we got
[1:51:46] America because they were brave men. Men
[1:51:49] that never had no shoes on their feet,
[1:51:52] but they were ready to get through the
[1:51:54] rivers.
[1:51:56] To bring freedom, to bring liberty.
[1:52:00] They were able to raise something. What
[1:52:03] are we risking?"
[1:52:05] Amen.
[1:52:10] You see that's that's that's that's the
[1:52:11] loudish age. It's the age of
[1:52:15] convenience,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; the age of plenty, the age of laziness,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; That's that's our age.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it can creep on you so easy.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You don't realize I mean uh you you just
[1:52:32] there. You I mean you are just there.
[1:52:36] You are just there. A whole day can go
[1:52:38] and you ask yourself what did I do
[1:52:39] today? Tell yourself.
[1:52:43] Amen. That's the age we are living in.
[1:52:45] He says he says that's how we got
[1:52:47] America is mening men who has something
[1:52:50] to fight for.
[1:52:52] We should never let that down. Why
[1:52:55] should we why we should never let down?
[1:52:57] We have something to fight for.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have a loved one to
[1:53:02] fight for. We have a relative to fight
[1:53:05] for.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; We have a child to fight for.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a community to fight for.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; There is something to fight for.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; And when when that thing register to
[1:53:17] you, you will have a prayer chamber.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Because you will always want to go to
[1:53:23] that place because you know there is
[1:53:25] something to fight for.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] We must be bringing prayer requests of
[1:53:30] our relative, prayer requests of a
[1:53:32] coworker, prayer request of somebody. I
[1:53:35] saw the girl at Walmart today. She was
[1:53:37] looking so distressed. I want let's take
[1:53:39] a prayer for. We don't need to know her
[1:53:40] name. We don't need to know where she's
[1:53:42] living.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; But because you have something to fight
[1:53:46] for.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that make Christian
[1:53:54] life sweet.
[1:53:56] It gives you something to fight for. It
[1:53:57] does not have to be me and myself.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; No, it does not have to be be because it
[1:54:04] is it is it is now you that that is more
[1:54:07] serious.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Like I say,
[1:54:15] serving the Lord.
[1:54:17] Matthew chapter 5, we just went through
[1:54:19] it.
[1:54:22] Serving the Lord. How do we serve the
[1:54:23] Lord?
[1:54:26] How do we serve the Lord? It is not in
[1:54:29] keeping the commandments. It's not in
[1:54:32] living right. If you take yourself
[1:54:34] serving the Lord as that
[1:54:36] self-righteousness
[1:54:38] because it's just you and what you are
[1:54:40] doing.
[1:54:43] God do not have no corporate body. His
[1:54:46] body is the church.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; So in serving the Lord is what we do for
[1:54:51] the church. What we do for the people.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. what we do for humanity. That's
[1:54:56] how we serve God.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; You don't serve God in keeping his
[1:55:00] commandment. Oh, I read my Bible. I pray
[1:55:02] every day. I'm serving the Lord. You
[1:55:04] know, I'm a Christ. That that's how we
[1:55:05] think Christianity is.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; So, it is just me and myself.
[1:55:12] Do you have a desire for someone else to
[1:55:14] be saved?
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Who do you have a burden on your heart?
[1:55:17] Oh, I wish that God would do this for
[1:55:19] this person.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I remember many years
[1:55:22] ago, 1993, uh uh uh uh back there when
[1:55:26] when we started uh uh uh you know, uh uh
[1:55:29] preaching,
[1:55:31] you know, we we were all just young boys
[1:55:33] in church and and uh it it used to
[1:55:36] bother me. I was so bad about it. I just
[1:55:38] thought I I said, "Lord, you can't tell
[1:55:40] me that in this in in this entire
[1:55:42] setting there is not a girl here that
[1:55:44] can be saved."
[1:55:46] I was just so burdened for us to have a
[1:55:49] sister in church.
[1:55:51] because it's just all brothers and you
[1:55:54] know young young guys everybody ego gets
[1:55:56] up then pretty soon we start
[1:55:58] disrespecting one another.
[1:56:01] How can we run a church without a
[1:56:02] family? I said Lord your church is a
[1:56:05] family. How can we run a church? None of
[1:56:07] us are married.
[1:56:09] How is this thing ever going to look
[1:56:10] like we are serious?
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I remember one day I was out there in
[1:56:15] the market and uh uh uh you know I was I
[1:56:17] was I was selling.
[1:56:19] We had this brother uh James Nimler. He
[1:56:22] used to uh uh make our product. We used
[1:56:24] to sell and I I used to go sell and the
[1:56:27] other brother was a teacher. We three
[1:56:28] was living together. The teacher was the
[1:56:30] song leader, the the the uh producer. He
[1:56:34] was uh the the asher and I was the
[1:56:37] preacher.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, preachers are
[1:56:42] businessmen. So I was doing the selling.
[1:56:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:54] So I went out this mo that morning that
[1:56:57] I went in the market, you know, and and
[1:56:59] everything. I was there and and I and
[1:57:01] and and as I was walking that just that
[1:57:03] was just all that was in my heart. I was
[1:57:05] just praying and I saw this young lady
[1:57:08] walking before me. I said, "Oh God,
[1:57:11] there's a young lady that is walking.
[1:57:14] She could be a sister in church." You
[1:57:16] know, I just I just said that. I just I
[1:57:18] just pray that in my heart. And as soon
[1:57:20] I went past her.
[1:57:23] She said, "Oh, are you selling the car?"
[1:57:26] I said, "Yes." She says, "Oh, man. I I
[1:57:29] finished uh oh, I've I've used all my
[1:57:32] money, but can you go back with me?" So,
[1:57:33] she wanted for me to go back with her to
[1:57:35] the market. She was going to ask
[1:57:37] somebody to give her money so she can
[1:57:39] buy. and uh uh you know so we walk back
[1:57:42] and you know we started talking all the
[1:57:44] things she's talking you know I'm
[1:57:46] hearing her but I'm praying in my heart
[1:57:48] I'm just I'm saying Lord I don't know I
[1:57:50] just prayed and here says this young
[1:57:52] woman call me whatever is going to
[1:57:54] happen you know I you know I didn't I
[1:57:56] didn't I didn't bring no preaching to to
[1:57:58] her I was selling my copa I wanted to
[1:58:00] make sure she buyed
[1:58:05] you know and and then we w we went we
[1:58:07] went over but this is this is this This
[1:58:09] is going to be very strange though
[1:58:11] because uh we went over and uh and uh
[1:58:14] and the lady that she took me to later
[1:58:16] on I will leave that lady song to the
[1:58:19] Lord. And then uh uh you know and she
[1:58:22] she she met the woman and she told the
[1:58:24] woman oh I wanted to buy this but I use
[1:58:27] all my money. Can you give me money and
[1:58:28] I'll give it back to you? And you know
[1:58:30] she talked all of that. So she so uh he
[1:58:34] said yeah I really wanted to buy two you
[1:58:37] know and and all of that. So I just told
[1:58:38] her I says, "Well, let's do it like
[1:58:40] this. Where do you live? I can bring it
[1:58:42] to your house." She says, "Oh, really?"
[1:58:46] I wanted to know her house.
[1:58:48] Why? Because I was I was selling on
[1:58:50] Tuesday. Thursday were my witnessing
[1:58:53] day. I changed in Muffy Thursday. I'm in
[1:58:57] a suit.
[1:58:59] I'm in my clean cart. You would never
[1:59:02] know that this guy was the guy that was
[1:59:03] selling. So I I I told her, I said,
[1:59:06] "Sir, where do you live?" I can bring it
[1:59:08] to your house. She said, "Oh, really?" I
[1:59:10] said, "Yeah, I go bring it to your
[1:59:11] house." She said, "I don't want for
[1:59:13] somebody to buy." I said, "I can bring
[1:59:14] it to your house."
[1:59:16] She said, "Okay." Gave me the house
[1:59:19] number. Then she said, "Well, okay."
[1:59:20] Then just bring it to the house. She
[1:59:22] told the woman, "Thank you." You know,
[1:59:23] and she went home. Gave me the house
[1:59:25] number and everything. So, uh, I went
[1:59:28] about, you know, I I sold the ones that
[1:59:30] were in my hands. I went back home
[1:59:31] because we had some home and then and
[1:59:34] collected it. I ate, you know, talked
[1:59:37] with my friends, you know, and I I was
[1:59:38] just sharing the testimony with them. I
[1:59:40] said, "Wow, you know, there was it was
[1:59:41] very strange today, but you know, I'm
[1:59:43] I'm I'm going there." So, I went there,
[1:59:46] you know, long story short, I'm doing
[1:59:48] too much talking now tonight.
[1:59:51] Long story short, that will be the first
[1:59:54] couple I will lead to the Lord.
[1:59:58] That young lady and her husband will be
[2:00:00] the first couple and that will be the
[2:00:03] birth to the church in her bell.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; It was very awesome because I carried
[2:00:18] the car the cop I said when I turn when
[2:00:20] I when I show up Thursday, she never
[2:00:22] knew I was the one.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:27] She never knew I was the one. I mean, I
[2:00:30] put on my makeup.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:37] I just want to cheer you up a little bit
[2:00:39] tonight. I dress. I put on my makeup,
[2:00:43] make sure my hair was good, everything,
[2:00:45] shave, everything. She never knew. And
[2:00:48] they never knew until
[2:00:52] I knew that I got them
[2:00:55] because I was not going to talk about
[2:00:57] coat. I came to talk about the Lord.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; So when they started coming to church
[2:01:07] and then one day then I asked them I
[2:01:09] said where you bought your copper from?
[2:01:11] He says, "Oh yeah, that one guy saw this
[2:01:13] hopper to us and you know she's talking
[2:01:14] about her dad." I told her I said I'm
[2:01:16] the guy that really
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; But you see what I'm talking about is is
[2:01:24] that thing when soul become a burden on
[2:01:26] your heart, you go to bed talking about
[2:01:28] it, you praying about it, it's just on
[2:01:30] your heart.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. When it's
[2:01:33] just on your heart that Lord just give
[2:01:36] me one soul. Let me lead somebody to the
[2:01:39] kingdom. Let my life become a testimony.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to die like a cow.
[2:01:48] That's what I'm talking about tonight.
[2:01:51] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:56] Because if this word is truth, if this
[2:01:59] is truth and is good for you,
[2:02:03] it must not be only for you. Amen.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Christian life is
[2:02:08] not a selfish one. Brother Brandon says
[2:02:10] that's how we got America. Gilling men
[2:02:14] who had something to fight for. He says
[2:02:16] we should never let that down. Now they
[2:02:19] had h a musket in them days knives. He
[2:02:23] says some kind of a small knife that
[2:02:25] that was the best thing that they had.
[2:02:26] And today we look at it in a we we look
[2:02:30] at a different in our army today
[2:02:33] than than there was then. But you know
[2:02:39] being infinite uh infinite he cannot
[2:02:41] change there where my faith rest is on
[2:02:46] God's word because it is God. Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Now see what brother Brandon was says
[2:02:51] your testimony. He says now remember I'm
[2:02:53] I I am an American. He says generation
[2:02:56] after generation back to the third and
[2:02:59] fourth generation being an American. If
[2:03:02] this country ain't worth fighting for,
[2:03:05] it ain't worth living in.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; And I I I you know, just studing on this
[2:03:12] tonight, I I I was just I was just
[2:03:14] looking into something that is worth
[2:03:16] fighting for.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; He says, if it's not worth fighting for,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; if you if we just only want to enjoy the
[2:03:23] benefit of America and and and and uh
[2:03:26] and we don't have nothing good to say
[2:03:27] about it, then we should not be here.
[2:03:29] Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; That just that just a plain true story.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; The same thing will happen to your
[2:03:35] family. The same thing will happen to
[2:03:37] your home.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; If your home is not worth fighting for,
[2:03:42] then you should not be in it.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; The same thing will happen to the
[2:03:45] church. If the church is not worth
[2:03:47] fighting for to keep it clean and holy,
[2:03:50] then we should not be here. Find another
[2:03:52] place to go.
[2:03:59] If it's not worth fighting for, it's not
[2:04:01] worth living in. Praise the Lord.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; If the message is not worth fighting
[2:04:06] for, it's not worth believing.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; If you can't defend it, then how do you
[2:04:10] believe it?
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "Believe." Yeah. Uh uh that I'm
[2:04:21] able to do this. He said this is the
[2:04:23] greatest gener greatest greatest nation
[2:04:25] there is on the heaven. I'm glad to be
[2:04:28] an American. If it worth anything, it
[2:04:31] worth fighting for. It worth standing
[2:04:34] by.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe.
[2:04:39] Amen. Because I mean you would you will
[2:04:42] not you will not you will not even enjoy
[2:04:44] the blessing. You will not even enjoy
[2:04:47] the blessing if if you just only want
[2:04:49] the blessing. You will not enjoy your
[2:04:52] time being here.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, you will not enjoy your time being
[2:04:55] here
[2:04:58] because you don't you don't count it to
[2:05:00] be home. It's not your country. You are
[2:05:02] just here because you are here. You will
[2:05:04] not enjoy your time being here because
[2:05:06] what you're doing is that your body is
[2:05:08] here. Your spirit is living somewhere
[2:05:10] else.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You see what you're doing?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; You are you keep disconnecting yourself
[2:05:17] from your reality. This is your reality.
[2:05:20] If there is ever a time on earth you
[2:05:23] will serve God is now.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; If there was a record like the book of
[2:05:29] Acts to record us,
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; if they will say anything about you of
[2:05:35] 2025, it's because you were in a church
[2:05:37] in Minneapolis.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not going to write a
[2:05:41] record for you and say you were over in
[2:05:43] uh uh Airbis Church or you were in h one
[2:05:47] church somewhere else. Your record will
[2:05:49] be you were part of what took place in
[2:05:51] Minneapolis.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; This is our time.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; This is our own history we are writing.
[2:06:09] We are putting ourself back in the book
[2:06:12] of Acts.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; If it was wrote of you, what will be
[2:06:18] said?
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; If your name were in Acts chapter 6,
[2:06:22] Acts chapter 7, what will they say about
[2:06:24] you?
[2:06:32] No, I don't want to be a setting man. I
[2:06:35] don't want to be one of those guys that
[2:06:37] were called a setting man.
[2:06:40] Praise the Lord. I don't want to be a
[2:06:42] settlement man
[2:06:45] because you find out through the
[2:06:46] scripture sometimes is the troublemaker
[2:06:49] that I call settlement.
[2:06:53] Amen.
[2:06:57] Not all the time.
[2:07:00] But sometime even the woman with with
[2:07:02] the blood issue her name was never
[2:07:04] mentioned. She was called a certain
[2:07:06] woman. So it's not all the time. Praise
[2:07:09] the Lord.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; But even even even at that point,
[2:07:16] people thought that she was the
[2:07:17] troublemaker because when Jesus says,
[2:07:19] "Somebody touch me."
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Lord, no, don't don't even
[2:07:23] say that. Who is whoever is the one that
[2:07:25] touch you with all the people that are
[2:07:28] touching you? The person that touch you
[2:07:29] for you to say somebody touch me." you
[2:07:32] know, uh, she caught a stirred because
[2:07:34] she got Jesus attention.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; But what are we talking about? This is
[2:07:43] our time.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; If it is not worth standing by, it's not
[2:07:48] worth supporting, it's not worth uh,
[2:07:51] presenting yourself, then just count
[2:07:53] yourself out
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be a blessing
[2:07:57] to you anyway.
[2:08:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; That's that's what has become some some
[2:08:05] of the national crisis that we have
[2:08:08] because I mean there there are people
[2:08:09] that just want the benefit of the US and
[2:08:12] but they just don't want to be part of
[2:08:13] the country.
[2:08:18] And you find that uh that same spirit
[2:08:20] creeping into the church.
[2:08:23] They want the blessing. They want they
[2:08:24] they want the blessing of uh of of of
[2:08:27] William Brandon. You find many people
[2:08:30] says William Brandham God you know
[2:08:32] because the Bible uh brother Brandham
[2:08:34] says uh you know he were told behind the
[2:08:36] curtain of time all those that love you.
[2:08:39] So for them they must only love brother
[2:08:41] Brandham
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; because he was told all those that love
[2:08:46] you will be there.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; For them they must only love brother
[2:08:50] Brandon. Whether they obey God they obey
[2:08:53] the word they are breaking churches.
[2:08:55] They are living wrong
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; but they say I love brother Brandon
[2:08:59] because the angel those that love you
[2:09:01] and them that you love will be there.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; That's a perversion. That's a deception.
[2:09:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; That is a deception.
[2:09:14] Go back and read the testimony. Go back
[2:09:16] and read it properly. Study it. Run it
[2:09:19] through the message and see what what uh
[2:09:21] what what what was told the prophet.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; So that's all they want to do. They come
[2:09:26] in church. They are never there. They
[2:09:28] are never there to be part. They just
[2:09:30] they just want they just want brother
[2:09:32] Brandon.
[2:09:34] That's all they prayed in. Brother
[2:09:37] Brandham, God, oh brother Brandham, God
[2:09:39] come, come and deliver me.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Because they are thinking, they are
[2:09:43] creating a kind of a idol for
[2:09:45] themselves.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; That's cowardness.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If Jesus Christ is the
[2:09:52] same yesterday, today, and forever, then
[2:09:55] the God of Willing Brandham, he's the
[2:09:57] God tonight.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's the god of sister
[2:10:02] now me sister Al's brother Hillary. He's
[2:10:05] the god of all of his children.
[2:10:09] [Applause]
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Don't give me your idol.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; I won't be part of it.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can bring me whatever you want
[2:10:18] to bring me. I will not be part of it.
[2:10:20] Praise the Lord. When God met me, you
[2:10:22] were not there.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He met me and before he showed me
[2:10:31] his prophet.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; I met God before I know brother
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Brandon.
[2:10:40] Amen.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Because you will not even understand the
[2:10:42] message of the hour. Until you really
[2:10:44] meet God. You will not appreciate
[2:10:46] brother Brandon message until you have
[2:10:49] an experience with God.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; You will not live to honor this message
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; until God has really met you and changed
[2:10:56] your life.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Don't go on that. Don't never bagging on
[2:11:00] that. Let brother Brandon God be your
[2:11:02] God.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Those some of those
[2:11:09] cowardness, you know, the people have
[2:11:12] found among themselves. The Lord bless
[2:11:13] you. Musicians, you can come tonight.
[2:11:16] Let's just pray and close.
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:21] Hallelujah.
[2:11:23] Amen.

[2:11:33] warm the benches. You got to be in the
[2:11:36] worship. You got to be in the word. You
[2:11:38] got to be in the service. You got to be
