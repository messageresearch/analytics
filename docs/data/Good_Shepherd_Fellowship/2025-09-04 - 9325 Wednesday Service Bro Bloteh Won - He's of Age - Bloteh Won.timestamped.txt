[46:28] And uh uh let's take our Bibles.
[46:31] St. John chapter 9.
[46:35] Praise the Lord. St. John chapter 9. I
[46:38] know uh we left off uh talking about uh
[46:43] uh building
[46:46] and uh troubles time. That's what we
[46:50] were speaking on
[46:53] before we took a break.
[46:56] And uh but tonight we just we just want
[46:58] to look at something
[47:00] uh just to encourage you and then on
[47:04] Sunday we can get back to our subject if
[47:06] the Lord will allow us to so so so John
[47:10] chapter 9 tonight.
[47:14] Praise the Lord.
[47:17] Amen. Thank you for
[47:20] for coming out and uh
[47:30] praise the Lord St. John chapter 9. This
[47:32] is
[47:33] uh
[47:35] chapter a part of the Bible that is very
[47:38] familiar to us. But I just want to look
[47:42] at something a little bit. Let's read
[47:44] together. And as Jesus passed by, he saw
[47:48] the man which was blind
[47:51] from his birth. Praise the Lord. I
[47:54] always make this mistake when I say,
[47:55] "Let's read together." I meaning I'm
[47:57] reading.
[48:00] So I said, "Let's read together." And I
[48:02] start reading so fast and and you say,
[48:04] "But he said, "Let's read together." Why
[48:06] is he reading that way? Praise the Lord.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; I want you to just follow me. That's
[48:11] that's why I say that. So I'm sorry.
[48:14] Verse uh
[48:16] uh
[48:18] verse two. And his disciple asked him,
[48:20] saying, "Master, who did sin, this man
[48:23] or his parents?
[48:26] That
[48:27] he was born blind?" And Jesus answered,
[48:29] "Neither had this man seen none his
[48:32] parents, but that the works of God
[48:35] should be made manifest in him. I must
[48:38] work the work of him that sent me while
[48:41] it is day. The night cometh when no man
[48:44] can work. As long as I am in the word, I
[48:48] am the light of the word.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; When he had thus spoken, he sat on the
[48:53] ground and made clay
[48:57] of the sp. And he anointed the eyes of
[49:02] the blind man with the clay. And he said
[49:05] unto him, "Go watch in the pool of
[49:08] Salem, which is by interpretation sin."
[49:12] He went and he went his way therefore
[49:15] and watched and came seeing. The
[49:18] neighbors
[49:20] therefore and they which behold
[49:25] which before has seen him that he was
[49:27] blind said, "Is not this he that sat in
[49:32] the egg?" Some said this is he. Others
[49:35] said he is like him. But he said I am
[49:39] he. Praise the Lord.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You can have your
[49:42] seat while we continue to read.
[49:45] Therefore said they unto him, how were
[49:49] thine eyes open? He answered and said,
[49:51] "A man
[49:54] that is called Jesus make clay and
[49:57] anoint my eyes
[50:00] and said unto me, go to the pool of
[50:03] Salem and watch." And I went and
[50:06] watched, and I received sight. Then said
[50:10] they unto him, "Where is he?" He said,
[50:13] "I know that." They brought uh to the
[50:18] Pharisees him their full time was blind
[50:22] and it was the Sabbath day when Jesus
[50:26] made a clay and open his eyes. Then
[50:29] again the Pharisees also asked him how
[50:33] he have how he have received his sight.
[50:36] He said unto them, he put clay upon my
[50:39] eyes and I washed and do see. Therefore
[50:43] says some of the Pharisees, this man is
[50:46] not of God because he keepeth not the
[50:51] Sabbath day. Others said, "How can a man
[50:55] that is a sinner do such miracle?" And
[50:59] there was a division among them. Praise
[51:03] the Lord.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; There was a division among them because
[51:09] uh it was evident that what has happened
[51:12] is of God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Now, the division was because there was
[51:17] one group that was trapped in their
[51:20] tradition
[51:21] and uh and unless it comes through their
[51:24] tradition, unless it comes through the
[51:27] way that uh uh they have known it to be,
[51:31] they don't accept it to be of God. But
[51:34] there is another group of them also that
[51:37] uh uh they can't explain it but they
[51:40] know it is only God that can give a man
[51:43] his sight back.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:47] [Music]
[51:48] &gt;&gt; And uh this is the very same scripture
[51:50] that brother Brandham uh read when he
[51:53] preached the message taking sides with
[51:55] Jesus.
[51:57] you know, he he referred to this and
[51:59] then he said uh uh uh even though they
[52:03] could see that this was evident that
[52:05] this was of God, but they were trying to
[52:08] blackmail Jesus for the people not to
[52:12] believe the work that God has done.
[52:16] Praise the Lord.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I will read a little more verse 17. They
[52:21] said unto the blind man again, what
[52:24] sever thou of him that he have opened
[52:28] thine eyes? He said he is a prophet. But
[52:33] the Jews did not be believe concerning
[52:36] him
[52:38] that he had been blind and received his
[52:41] sight until they called the parents of
[52:44] him that have received his sight. And
[52:47] they asked them, saying, "Is this your
[52:50] son?
[52:52] Who you said was born blind? How then
[52:57] does he now see?"
[53:00] What does that matter?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the danger of of uh of
[53:09] religion. Yeah.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; His parents answered them and said, "We
[53:15] know that this is our son and that he
[53:19] was born blind.
[53:22] But by what means he now seeth, we know
[53:27] not."
[53:29] &gt;&gt; All who have opened his eyes, we know
[53:33] not.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; He is of age.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; It is just that word that caught my
[53:38] mind.
[53:40] He is of age.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Are you of age tonight?
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Are you of age?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Can you be able
[53:53] to defend what is happening in your
[53:55] life?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Are you of age to be able to defend what
[54:02] is happening in your life? Are you of
[54:04] age for you to be able to give your
[54:07] testimony
[54:08] &gt;&gt; even if nobody believe you?
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Are you of age to stand alone?
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; We know that he is of age. Ask him.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He shall speak for himself.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; These words speak his parents because
[54:28] they fear the Jews. For the Jews have
[54:31] agreed already that if any man did
[54:34] confess that he was Christ, he should be
[54:37] put out of the synagogues.
[54:41] Therefore his parents,
[54:44] therefore said his parents, he is of
[54:46] age. Ask him. Then again called they the
[54:49] man that was blind and said unto him,
[54:53] give God the praise. We know that this
[54:56] man is a sinner.
[54:58] The man of age said, he answered and
[55:02] said, whether he be a sinner or no,
[55:08] I know not.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; One thing I know
[55:13] &gt;&gt; that whereas I was blind,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; now I see. Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; First about whether he's a sinner,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; first about whether he's a devil.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But what I know,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; I was not seeing
[55:32] &gt;&gt; and now I can see.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; This one, you can't tell me I'm blind.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You can say he's a sinner. He's a Greek.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He's a Samaritan. He's a Roman. But this
[55:43] one,
[55:44] &gt;&gt; for the fact that I can see this one,
[55:47] you can't deny it. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads tonight. Heavenly
[55:54] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:56] Christ,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; oh God, we just want to thank you, Lord.

[56:19] just a song oh God but father is a
[56:22] reality
[56:24] Lord yes a man oh God father that we
[56:26] have just read about the parents say
[56:29] he's of age and oh God I pray tonight
[56:33] that your grace Lord will just come and
[56:35] help us as we just look into your word
[56:38] to you be the praise glory and honor in
[56:40] Jesus name amen
[56:44] praise the lord we'll come back to that
[56:47] let's go to Ephesians Ephesians chapter
[56:49] 4.
[56:53] Ephesians chapter 4 tonight.
[56:58] I'm trying to dust myself up a little
[57:00] bit. Amen.

[57:28] will speak here unto us.

[57:47] Let me now take uh from verse 11. Let me
[57:51] add the five for ministrating to it. And
[57:53] and then we get to what I want to I want
[57:56] for those to notice tonight.
[57:59] And he gives some apostles and some
[58:01] prophets and some evangelists and some
[58:04] pastors and some teachers for the
[58:07] perfecting of the saints for the working
[58:10] of the ministry for the edifiring of the
[58:13] body of Christ till we all come to the

[58:40] image of the fullness of Christ. Are we
[58:44] together?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; We will go there in a little bit
[58:46] tonight.
[58:48] And uh uh till we all come to the unity
[58:52] of the faith
[58:54] and to the knowledge of the son of God.
[58:57] Praise the Lord.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; To the knowledge of the son of God is
[59:02] not knowing Jesus of Nazareth.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; The knowledge of the son of God is the
[59:08] word of God for your age.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God for our age is
[59:13] the son of God is the manifestation of
[59:16] the son of God in our day.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; So we want to come to the unity of the
[59:22] faith and to the knowledge of the son of
[59:25] God.

[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; What what we what we don't realize is

[1:00:17] planted when the tree grows it grows in
[1:00:21] two different direction
[1:00:25] we see the plant that comes upward

[1:02:03] hesitation tonight.

[1:03:17] make few comment here.
[1:03:20] But Brandon says, "So they wanted to
[1:03:22] make a big display out of it because
[1:03:25] they hated him.
[1:03:27] They wasn't thinking of the poor blind
[1:03:29] man
[1:03:31] that had just received his sight.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; They were not happy
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; that joy has come to this family.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; This boy has laid from since he was a
[1:03:43] little boy.
[1:03:44] Everyone knew that uh you know and even
[1:03:48] just just even see the mind of the
[1:03:50] disciples asking was it because of his
[1:03:53] parents it is is because that's the way
[1:03:55] they were taught whether it was sin or
[1:03:59] whether it was sickness it was always
[1:04:01] attributed to uh either the child sin or
[1:04:05] the parent sin or the great parent sin
[1:04:09] praise the lord
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; so they were not concerned about the
[1:04:12] Right.
[1:04:15] Uh they were not thinking of that poor
[1:04:18] blind man. They but they wanted to make
[1:04:21] a big display to make the people keep
[1:04:25] away from him. They said they wanted to
[1:04:28] ask his father and his mother.
[1:04:31] So they went and got his father and his
[1:04:34] mother and they asked him. Praise the
[1:04:36] Lord.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And the father and mother was afraid.
[1:04:41] The Bible says cause they know that they
[1:04:43] will put them out of the synagogues if
[1:04:45] they emate
[1:04:48] but
[1:04:50] they emitted to what they know that this
[1:04:53] is our son as far as we can tell the one
[1:04:57] that was born blind
[1:05:00] this is him. We can identify by his
[1:05:03] fingers, by his toes,
[1:05:06] you know, uh his height. This is the
[1:05:09] boy.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But that part of where he went from
[1:05:13] blind to receiving his sight, we can
[1:05:17] tell you what happened.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] Brother Brandon says, "Oh, probably a
[1:05:33] few thousand people standing there. If
[1:05:36] them Pharisees could only put uh a blame
[1:05:41] on his name right there or done
[1:05:44] something to scare the people that they
[1:05:47] have run him out of there for that
[1:05:51] meeting
[1:05:53] all of his influence who have been lost.
[1:05:57] So all of this was just to destroy his
[1:05:59] influence.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; All of this was just to destroy his
[1:06:06] influence. The last time we preached we
[1:06:08] spoke on borrow vessel and we have to
[1:06:11] know that every one of us are borrow
[1:06:13] vessels and and men through the
[1:06:15] scripture that God will use. Brother
[1:06:17] Brandon was a borrow vessel. Amen. A a
[1:06:21] vessel that God took from the house of a
[1:06:23] drunken father and uh hh you know and
[1:06:27] and and had an angel to watch over him.
[1:06:30] If not, he was going to be a drunker
[1:06:32] himself. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] If he was going to be a drunker himself
[1:06:41] and uh uh but God
[1:06:44] borrowed that vessel to be able to
[1:06:46] fulfill his word in this day. Praise the
[1:06:49] Lord. Now, so uh it is it is at this
[1:06:53] place as we grow together and we talk
[1:06:56] about growth. One of the thing that is
[1:06:59] important is for us to be able to to
[1:07:04] separate
[1:07:06] the the the working of God from
[1:07:12] the flesh of a man.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; We must be able to separate what is
[1:07:19] divine and what is human.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] because uh uh
[1:07:30] uh
[1:07:34] we will realize that's what these Jews
[1:07:37] were struggling with when it comes to
[1:07:38] this. And uh uh Paul will say I also
[1:07:44] have that in my reading here. When I was
[1:07:46] a child,
[1:07:48] I spoke as a child.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when we grow up,
[1:07:55] when we become of age,
[1:07:59] Paul says, I put away childish things.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And I think the marriage of the lamb is
[1:08:06] of a bride that is uh that is that is
[1:08:09] coming to maturity.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Is uh uh uh is is is for the bride is
[1:08:16] for the people that are coming to
[1:08:18] maturity. And our maturity is a better
[1:08:21] understanding of what God is doing in
[1:08:24] our day, what he's doing in our life,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; what he's doing in our home,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; what he's doing in our family.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. At least we must be able to put u
[1:08:39] uh uh give a reason why we come here why
[1:08:42] why we come here you know why why we
[1:08:45] come here into this assembling why we
[1:08:48] still believe the message of the hour
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; what what does it means to you praise
[1:08:53] the lord
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; as we come up to age we are not just
[1:08:57] following because we should follow
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; but uh uh we have an answer amen
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; we have an answer.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have an answer. So in in the
[1:09:12] principle of growing tonight, just like
[1:09:15] I said, Paul referenced something here.
[1:09:18] He says that and onto the perfect man
[1:09:21] onto the measure of the statue of the
[1:09:24] fullness of Christ. So let's go to Peter
[1:09:28] where he talks about the statue of the
[1:09:31] perfect man.
[1:09:35] because in our our
[1:09:38] uh
[1:09:42] our subject of uh building in troubleous
[1:09:46] time that's one of the place we were
[1:09:48] going to come to and uh uh
[1:09:54] I'm just trying to find like I said
[1:09:56] trying to find my foot in tonight. Amen.
[1:10:00] trying to get back into the pull pit
[1:10:03] after being away for just a week. Praise
[1:10:08] the Lord. Just after having a week away,
[1:10:13] I'm feeling backsliding.
[1:10:15] So, I'm trying to get back into the pit.
[1:10:18] Let's go to second Peter chapter 1.
[1:10:23] Second Peter, chapter 1.
[1:10:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I have something I was going to talk on
[1:10:35] tonight, but I thought, well, let me
[1:10:37] just find my 14.
[1:10:41] Peter will talk here and which of course
[1:10:44] we we are very familiar with uh Simon
[1:10:48] Peter the seven and an apostle of Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ to them that have obtained like
[1:10:53] precious faith with us through the
[1:10:55] righteousness of God and our savior
[1:10:58] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[1:11:01] multiplied unto you through the
[1:11:03] knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:07] Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:13] according as his divine power had given
[1:11:16] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:11:18] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:11:21] of him that have called us to glory and
[1:11:25] to virtue whereby I ging unto us
[1:11:29] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:11:32] that by this ye might be partakers of
[1:11:39] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:11:41] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:11:44] word through lust
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and beside this giving all diligence add
[1:11:50] to your faith. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] When you look at this this principle of
[1:11:57] adding to your faith uh for for the wide
[1:12:02] as babies growing up in the message, we
[1:12:04] we first thought that you know it is
[1:12:06] something that we can we can uh you know
[1:12:10] do for our faith to grow or you know we
[1:12:13] have to do for us to be able to get
[1:12:16] virtue knowledge and the rest of them.
[1:12:19] But uh uh uh
[1:12:25] one time I was studying on this subject
[1:12:28] and uh I was I was thinking about it
[1:12:32] and one of the thing that helped me to
[1:12:35] be able to understand you know brother
[1:12:37] Brandon he talked about it.
[1:12:41] If you if we go over
[1:12:47] uh
[1:12:52] if we go over to Genesis
[1:12:55] that is the C chapter.
[1:13:01] If we go over to Genesis that is the C
[1:13:03] chapter.
[1:13:12] You look in Genesis chapter 30.
[1:13:17] You look in Genesis chapter 30 verse 24.
[1:13:26] The Bible says here
[1:13:29] this is Richard that is speaking
[1:13:35] 30 verse 22. And God remember Richard
[1:13:39] and God here came to her and opened her
[1:13:42] womb and she conceived and be a son and
[1:13:46] said God has taken away my reproach
[1:13:50] and she called his name Joseph and said
[1:13:55] the Lord shall add
[1:13:58] to mean another son.
[1:14:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] So even in in in her in her in her child
[1:14:10] labor laboring to bring forth Joseph,
[1:14:13] she's prophes she's prophesying. Now the
[1:14:16] word I want you to watch is add. The
[1:14:19] Lord shall add.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Add unto your faith.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; So the Lord adding to her another son.
[1:14:29] He's not coming from somewhere else.
[1:14:33] Are you seeing the are you grabbing the
[1:14:35] concept?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; She's not going to get him from outside.
[1:14:39] It's going to come from inside.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brandon says all
[1:14:46] these virtues are already in you.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; So add onto your faith. you know uh add
[1:14:56] in the in a sense that we we understand
[1:14:58] the word add is take something else and
[1:15:01] put it on top
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; but it said in childbearing she says the
[1:15:07] Lord will add onto me another son
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; if I'm giving birth to this one definite
[1:15:15] another one is going to come
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and then Think about it. Now we all we
[1:15:25] talking what we are talking on tonight
[1:15:26] is a growing principle. So uh if you
[1:15:30] think about it, you look here the Bible
[1:15:33] says that u uh uh
[1:15:38] giving all diligence uh to your faith.
[1:15:43] But uh
[1:15:45] uh we are adding to faith
[1:15:51] and uh
[1:15:54] we are not adding to anything to get
[1:15:56] faith.
[1:15:59] Are you are you seeing what I'm saying?
[1:16:01] Praise the Lord. The Bible says add to
[1:16:04] your faith
[1:16:07] which mean there is that just like uh uh
[1:16:12] uh you know uh uh Paul says faith cometh
[1:16:17] by hearing and hearing the word of God.
[1:16:20] Brother Brandham says faith is a gift
[1:16:24] just like salvation is a free gift that
[1:16:27] is given to us. Faith is a gift that is
[1:16:30] given to the believer.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; So you are not hiding faith, but you are
[1:16:38] adding onto your faith.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; It's coming to that man that is of old
[1:16:48] age.
[1:16:50] Coming to the statue of the perfect man.
[1:16:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh we we we see here that uh
[1:17:01] yeah uh uh faith is a gift that is given
[1:17:04] to the believer and then uh uh as as as
[1:17:09] we grow as we give birth to faith. Let
[1:17:13] me say it in that way just like Richard
[1:17:16] giving birth to to Joseph and saying the
[1:17:20] Lord lay out to me another son. Praise
[1:17:23] the Lord. As we are giving birth to
[1:17:26] faith, which mean we we we we are
[1:17:29] beginning to express faith in God's
[1:17:32] word, we are beginning to take God at
[1:17:35] his word. We are beginning to trust God,
[1:17:38] we are beginning to live out the word of
[1:17:40] God. Praise the Lord. As we are giving
[1:17:43] birth to faith,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; then
[1:17:47] he has on virtue.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] Are you are we are you are you
[1:17:56] understanding?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; But now see uh uh uh
[1:18:04] see the way that uh uh that brother
[1:18:07] Brandham will will lay the foundation
[1:18:11] for this faith that we give birth to
[1:18:14] vetu.
[1:18:16] And uh and then uh as virtue is being
[1:18:19] born, we know that he will add to us
[1:18:22] another son knowledge. As knowledge is
[1:18:25] being born, he will you will add to us
[1:18:27] another son. And then we will grow as we
[1:18:30] grow up like that into the statue of a
[1:18:33] perfect man. But uh yeah, brother
[1:18:35] Brandon would tell us,
[1:18:38] praise the Lord. Let's uh let's go back
[1:18:41] to the Bible.
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:49] Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And uh uh
[1:19:25] Let's go to Mark. Uh
[1:19:33] let's go to Mark chapter 10.
[1:19:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:51] Now we know that uh uh in in the message
[1:19:56] perfect faith
[1:19:58] brother Brandham will will tell us that
[1:20:01] uh how uh that's actually Mark chapter
[1:20:06] 11 how uh you know Jesus grew in perfect
[1:20:10] faith and uh uh
[1:20:15] and then all of this will come to this
[1:20:18] place of heard uh you know u uh
[1:20:25] he would speak to the disciples about uh
[1:20:28] them being of little faith and we know
[1:20:31] how Mark chapter 11 is tied over to the
[1:20:35] temple. Mark chapter 11 is tied to
[1:20:38] perfect faith. So all of that and then
[1:20:40] and is is right at the beginning of
[1:20:42] where the rest of the virtue is added
[1:20:45] on. So, so brother Brandham in perfect
[1:20:48] faith he tells us and he also speak of
[1:20:52] that in in uh uh the statue of the
[1:20:55] perfect man that's Mark chapter 11 sorry
[1:20:57] I said Mark chapter 10
[1:21:02] and it it all goes back to the uh the
[1:21:06] fig tree verse 20 and in the morning as
[1:21:09] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[1:21:12] dried up from the roof and Peter called
[1:21:14] to remembrance prince said to the
[1:21:17] master, "Behold, the fig tree which thou
[1:21:20] cursed is wither away." And Jesus
[1:21:22] answered and said unto them, "Have faith
[1:21:26] in God." Praise the Lord.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. He's telling them to
[1:21:32] have faith in God, but yet he's also
[1:21:35] going to show a principle how this faith
[1:21:38] will grow. Now remember now we are not
[1:21:41] adding faith because faith is is a gift
[1:21:45] that comes with our birth.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; It it comes with our new birth when we
[1:21:51] are born again. Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; When we are born again uh uh uh uh
[1:21:57] something is in us to believe the
[1:22:00] supernatural to believe the invisible
[1:22:03] God. Amen. To believe that he is there.
[1:22:06] He is here tonight. Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He is with us wherever we go.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's that sense that six sense is is
[1:22:14] inact in us is is stimulated in us for
[1:22:17] us to believe in the supernatural.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; But
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; but he also going to show us a principle
[1:22:26] which of course that is what uh uh the
[1:22:30] Lord also showed brother Brandham in
[1:22:32] this uh uh uh tu. Have faith in God.
[1:22:36] Verily I said unto you,
[1:22:39] that whatsoever ye shall uh uh that
[1:22:44] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[1:22:47] be there removed, and be cast into the
[1:22:51] sea, and shall not doubt in his heart,
[1:22:54] but shall believe that those things
[1:22:56] which he have said shall come to pass,
[1:22:58] he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore I said unto you, what
[1:23:06] thingsoever ye desire,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever
[1:23:14] ye desire.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; This desire is not just a thought. Yeah,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; this desire is a is a painful emotion
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; that a person has within them.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; This desire
[1:23:39] uh uh uh
[1:23:42] whatsoever you desire this desire is uh
[1:23:46] is something that comes from uh from the
[1:23:51] inside of the inside.
[1:23:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Let's read a little bit. My mind is
[1:24:00] trying to carry me into something, but
[1:24:03] the spirit of the prophet is subject
[1:24:04] unto the prophet.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever thingsoever ye desire when ye
[1:24:09] pray, believe that ye receive it
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; and you shall have them.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] He said, "Have faith in God
[1:24:23] and whatsoever thing you desire when you
[1:24:27] pray, believe that you will have them."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; But then he brings us the principle.
[1:24:34] And when you stand praying,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; forgive
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; if ye have
[1:24:42] ought against any. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:46] Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham in the statue of
[1:24:48] the perfect man will now tell us that
[1:24:52] the foundation of this param or the
[1:24:55] foundation of faith is forgiveness.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Now remember that Peter never said he
[1:25:05] never said add on to forgiveness faith.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; He never said it.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Add onto your faith
[1:25:16] virtue."
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; We are not adding faith unto anything.
[1:25:23] Just like I said, because faith is a
[1:25:27] gift.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; He that cometh unto God must what? First
[1:25:34] believe.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] It must that it must be it must be
[1:25:40] released from you
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; to believe that God exists and God is
[1:25:46] real.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Now you see all of these things is not a
[1:25:52] mind work.
[1:25:54] It is something that works within us.
[1:25:57] Just like I said
[1:26:00] Richard saying he will add onto me
[1:26:02] another son. Jacob is not going to bomb
[1:26:06] uh bar Benjamin from the store. He's not
[1:26:09] going to take Benjamin from the nations
[1:26:11] around. Benjamin is coming to come out
[1:26:14] of her womb.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That other son that will be added onto
[1:26:19] her is coming from in her.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That is the same where all of these
[1:26:24] virtue are going to come out of the
[1:26:26] believer. But you see like brother
[1:26:28] Brandham said the foundation of faith is
[1:26:32] forgiveness.
[1:26:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Which is very powerful. And that's where
[1:26:38] we want to stand tonight just for this
[1:26:41] uh exaltation
[1:26:43] because you realize here is that Jesus
[1:26:46] said, "And when you when you stand
[1:26:49] praying, forgive if you have ought
[1:26:52] against any that your father also which
[1:26:56] is in heaven may forgive you your
[1:26:59] trespasses."
[1:27:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so we see here that uh uh uh
[1:27:07] uh think about this. Think about this. I
[1:27:10] was uh I was talking about this uh uh uh
[1:27:14] in one of my my uh uh services
[1:27:18] and I was talking about which of course
[1:27:21] we spoke about it here before talking
[1:27:23] about God coming to reconcile Adam and
[1:27:26] Eve.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling Adam, Adam, where are
[1:27:33] you?
[1:27:36] Just for the fact that Adam has left his
[1:27:40] position.
[1:27:42] Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Trying to call him. He had left his
[1:27:46] position. And that position that Adam
[1:27:49] has left was not a geographical position
[1:27:53] in the garden.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; The position that Adam left, he fell.
[1:28:00] from approaching God from his soul
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; to now his flesh.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; He's he fell from the consciousness.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; The consciousness of where he knew that
[1:28:17] God has given him power and authority.
[1:28:21] He could speak and the mountain could
[1:28:23] move. He fell from that place. Yes,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; that is his position where he fell from.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; As we talk about position, I think about
[1:28:34] this a little bit because you know uh uh
[1:28:37] we are we are fond of saying the woman
[1:28:40] position is in the kitchen. There was no
[1:28:43] kitchen in the garden of Eden.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] Adam and Eve was not cooking.
[1:28:53] Praise the Lord. So you see the position
[1:28:56] was not a a a geographical position.
[1:29:03] Are we together?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Her position when God placed her, she
[1:29:09] was placed to be a helpmate.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And I was just looking at that word this
[1:29:15] morning in my in my devotion as I was as
[1:29:18] I was meditating. And that word is uh uh
[1:29:22] uh uh is is the same word that word
[1:29:26] helpmate is the same word that David
[1:29:28] used when he said my help cometh from
[1:29:31] the Lord.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew is called a
[1:29:36] it's eer.
[1:29:39] Praise the Lord. So you see it was it is
[1:29:42] not uh you know
[1:29:46] a a position a setting place in the
[1:29:48] garden of Eden but it was something that
[1:29:51] she was called onto.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the same thing with Adam. When
[1:29:59] Adam fell from his position his position
[1:30:02] was not that he was standing on a
[1:30:05] mountain. He was supposed to be on a
[1:30:07] mountain or he was supposed to be down
[1:30:09] in a valley. But his position was uh at
[1:30:13] the time he was approaching God with a
[1:30:16] consciousness from his soul.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Where he did not even he he didn't have
[1:30:23] conscious that the beast around him
[1:30:25] could harm him.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't have consciousness that he
[1:30:32] never had consciousness of evil.
[1:30:36] that were just how much he was so h
[1:30:40] connected to God and how much he was
[1:30:43] worshiping God and serving God from his
[1:30:46] soul.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so see what is going to happen
[1:30:49] here. He fell from there. Praise the
[1:30:52] Lord.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And if God will bring him back to that
[1:30:56] place, he had to forgive him.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; If God will bring him back to that
[1:31:06] place, if God will bring him back to the
[1:31:08] place of fellowship,
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; he had to forgive him. So God provided a
[1:31:14] bleeding line. I'm trying to make a
[1:31:16] picture of why forgiveness is the
[1:31:19] foundation of faith.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Because faith is not a mind game. Faith
[1:31:26] is a sense of your soul.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Is that sense of the soul where we fell
[1:31:35] from.
[1:31:37] And if God will bring men back into
[1:31:40] fellowship, he had to bring men back by
[1:31:43] the way of forgiveness, providing a a a
[1:31:48] sacrifice or an atonement to be able to
[1:31:51] bring man back. So you see with God, you
[1:31:54] are back.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; The problem now is you. Do you forgive
[1:31:58] yourself to be back?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; To God, he has he has already made made
[1:32:10] a sacrifice provided. He has already
[1:32:12] made a way of forgiving us. He went on
[1:32:15] the cross. He said, "It is finished. I
[1:32:17] have paid the price."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And and I mean he's uh he's uh he's he's
[1:32:27] he's coming close. He's bringing himself
[1:32:30] close to us and and and and trying to
[1:32:32] bring us in his presence.
[1:32:39] So with God, he has already done his
[1:32:42] part.
[1:32:44] He has forgiven us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] He has forgiven us. Now
[1:32:53] it is now with with with man to be able
[1:32:57] to come back to that place.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; To come back to the place of the six
[1:33:04] sense to come back to live in the the
[1:33:08] the the sense of faith. Now you see uh I
[1:33:13] mean we we have to work and we have to
[1:33:15] do everything. Uh uh but you realize
[1:33:18] that uh uh uh you know we we we we are
[1:33:23] doing all of these things just to create
[1:33:26] some sense of security for ourself.
[1:33:30] But in the actual sense
[1:33:33] God is our provider.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; In the actual sense he is our provider.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; And even with all our working and
[1:33:46] everything we are doing, he's the one
[1:33:48] providing for us.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; He's the one blessing us with strength.
[1:33:54] He's the one blessing us with uh with
[1:33:57] with abilities and jobs and everything.
[1:34:00] He is our provider.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But think about it at a
[1:34:05] place of word right there from the
[1:34:08] beginning you know uh uh uh Adam was not
[1:34:12] he was not he was not hustling to make
[1:34:15] it work.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:21] He was just living out of it is it is
[1:34:24] just that place of uh that that the the
[1:34:27] full consciousness
[1:34:31] of God that we are coming to.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; That we are coming to the full
[1:34:41] consciousness of God. So I'm I'm trying
[1:34:43] to bring where forgiveness becomes the
[1:34:46] foundation because here is it now that
[1:34:49] uh God has reconciled us back to himself
[1:34:53] because he have paid the price and he
[1:34:55] has done uh everything that he is
[1:34:57] supposed to do and yet in our self we
[1:35:00] still struggle with guilt.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; We are still reminded
[1:35:08] and all of the guilt that we still
[1:35:10] struggle with create doubt in our mind
[1:35:13] whether we can stand and ask the
[1:35:15] mountain to be moved and it will move.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; It's not that the power is not there for
[1:35:23] you to do it but what is happening here
[1:35:26] is that we are too much in our mind and
[1:35:28] we are not in our heart.
[1:35:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; We are too much in our mind. We are too
[1:35:38] much in the realm of memory and and
[1:35:41] reasoning and uh and affection. I feel
[1:35:44] good. I don't feel good. You know, I
[1:35:46] really don't feel up to the tax. We are
[1:35:48] so much in that realm of our spirit in
[1:35:52] our mind.
[1:35:57] Praise the Lord. So you see the thing
[1:36:00] the thing that makes faith to come up to
[1:36:03] its potential is forgiveness.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh most of the time you know we we
[1:36:15] just think about as soon you talk about
[1:36:16] forgiveness your mind run on another
[1:36:19] person. But even think about your very
[1:36:21] self.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about your very self
[1:36:29] when the word says you have not done it
[1:36:32] in the first place. Do you really
[1:36:33] believe that?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Or you are still captured. You are still
[1:36:38] struggling in in your mind with with
[1:36:40] condemnation and fear and doubt because
[1:36:43] as soon as condemnation set in that's
[1:36:45] the thing it produce fear and doubt.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; It produce fear and doubt.
[1:36:56] And most of the time that that is the
[1:36:59] realm that we we we live in.
[1:37:03] We are afraid. We don't you know want
[1:37:05] people to talk bad about us. We are
[1:37:07] afraid you know uh we we I mean we
[1:37:10] really don't know what tomorrow will
[1:37:12] brings. Uh you know and and and all of
[1:37:14] that. So it's just in that rain
[1:37:18] now. So see how faith how the sea of
[1:37:22] faith
[1:37:24] comes to life
[1:37:27] is when we have been able to accept what
[1:37:30] he has done for us.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; When we have been able to fully accept
[1:37:40] what he has done for us.
[1:37:43] when we can be able to drop down from
[1:37:45] that realm of uh being haunted by our
[1:37:49] past.
[1:37:51] Praise the Lord,
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; we can be able to to to get out of that
[1:37:55] realm of guilt like Paul says uh uh uh
[1:37:59] uh you know uh uh therefore there is no
[1:38:04] condemnation.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:07] Therefore, there is no condemnation to
[1:38:10] them that are in Christ. Praise the
[1:38:13] Lord.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. It is truth. But
[1:38:17] the reality there is that have we grown
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; to really be able to behave that there
[1:38:25] is no condemnation?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; We're talking about growth tonight. Have
[1:38:31] we grown to that place
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; to be able to behave that there is no
[1:38:35] condemnation?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; You see one uh one group of people taken
[1:38:43] to the place there is no condemnation so
[1:38:45] they can just keep doing wrong.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You just making a disgrace to yourself
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; because that's not the word.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; So you see that's that is the sense of
[1:39:00] growth that I'm talking about because we
[1:39:02] will never be able to to to fully
[1:39:06] express faith
[1:39:08] to really be able to express faith like
[1:39:11] like like that young man.
[1:39:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:16] They says, "Oh, he he he's a devil. He's
[1:39:20] a sinner. the man I open your eyes
[1:39:24] and and and and and and this boy never
[1:39:26] he never grew up with Jesus. He never
[1:39:28] knew Jesus. He don't know where he came
[1:39:30] from.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; But let me let me let me share this with
[1:39:35] you. Do you realize that uh if if those
[1:39:39] Pharisees could could tarnish the
[1:39:42] repetition of Jesus Christ to that boy,
[1:39:46] they could easily make him to believe
[1:39:48] that he's still blind.
[1:39:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; If they could if if they could just just
[1:39:57] make make uh h Jesus. So, for the matter
[1:40:02] of fact, it's even the Sabbath day.
[1:40:04] Don't you know the Sabbath day
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; that he not? Can Can you see it? How
[1:40:10] demonic this man is? How even the
[1:40:13] Sabbath is a dishonor to the Sabbath
[1:40:15] day. So, how can you believe that God is
[1:40:18] in this?
[1:40:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see how
[1:40:29] they could have trouble his mind
[1:40:33] and then he will go back for his uh his
[1:40:36] blind stick? Let me use this thing here.
[1:40:39] I hope I don't spot it. He'll go back
[1:40:41] for his blind stick. His eyes is open.
[1:40:44] But they have told him that man is of
[1:40:46] the devil.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; He'll go, he will still hold his blind
[1:40:52] stick and close his eyes.
[1:40:56] Oh my God. He dishonor the Sabbath.
[1:40:59] Jehovah is not happy.
[1:41:02] He's going back.
[1:41:04] And many of the time that's the thing we
[1:41:06] do.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; He is of age. When you become of age.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; When you become of age.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; When you become of age,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; then you realize that
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; sometimes you are the one that is
[1:41:29] writing the story.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; When you become of age, you realize that
[1:41:35] this is my day.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; This is my opportunity.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; As much as I can say, I don't care what
[1:41:44] anybody said. I will say loud. I don't
[1:41:47] care what the devil said to me in my
[1:41:49] head. I know that by God's grace, he has
[1:41:53] opened my eyes to see the message of the
[1:41:55] hour. I believe the messenger of my day.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I believe the promise of my day.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; That's faith
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; of age. A man that is of age
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said they were trying to
[1:42:21] discredit him.
[1:42:25] They were trying to just blackmail him.
[1:42:28] But the danger of blackmailing him was
[1:42:33] enough to send this man back blind.
[1:42:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you have to you have to see
[1:42:42] this. Now, Brother Brandham says when uh
[1:42:44] when when when the Lord heals you,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; it is faith that makes you to walk in
[1:42:50] your healing.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; When you start to doubt it, you can you
[1:42:55] can backslide and go right back to your
[1:42:57] sickness.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So see if they will have tried to
[1:43:02] convince this man for him to doubt the
[1:43:05] man.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; So so it more like they enjoy him being
[1:43:11] blind.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; They enjoy him being blind.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; This is just an exesation to now lead.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Good. But there's a there's a there's a
[1:43:30] there's a
[1:43:33] there's a little conversation I heard
[1:43:36] one time.
[1:43:41] I heard this conversation
[1:43:44] that uh
[1:43:47] one time the pope was with some of his
[1:43:51] cabinets
[1:43:53] and they were looking at uh uh how much
[1:43:56] uh you know they were just they were
[1:43:58] just talking about uh you know how much
[1:44:01] how the how their organization how the
[1:44:03] church has traveled
[1:44:06] and with the wealth that the church has
[1:44:10] accumulated
[1:44:12] And the pope said to the cabinet,
[1:44:16] "We can no longer say we can no longer
[1:44:19] say savor and go. We have none."
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Because I mean, we have got so much
[1:44:27] wealth
[1:44:29] that it would not be fair for us to say
[1:44:31] savor and go. We have none.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:37] And the cardinal said to the pope, we
[1:44:40] can also now say rise up and walk.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture did not only end
[1:44:54] on silver and gold, we have none.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; So if the church cannot say silver and
[1:45:01] gold, we have none. The church will not
[1:45:03] be able to say rise up and walk.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What's the principle there?
[1:45:11] Glory be to God.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; For the fact that uh uh uh they were
[1:45:20] trying to introduce a lot of things just
[1:45:23] to be able to destroy this man
[1:45:26] repetition, just to be able to make him
[1:45:29] ugly.
[1:45:32] And in that sense, I mean there's there
[1:45:35] is there is none of his work that we can
[1:45:37] believe.
[1:45:41] Well, coming to the place where they
[1:45:43] could not convince him that this man is
[1:45:45] a sinner, he's a devil. They say, "Okay,
[1:45:48] just take him from out of the picture
[1:45:50] and give praise to God."
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] He's of age.
[1:46:02] I believe the bride is of age. Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; I believe that this bride is of age.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; She's been walking with this word now.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; For some years, she's of age. And
[1:46:16] brother Brandon says the the mind of
[1:46:18] Christ is given to her so she can know
[1:46:20] what to do with the word. Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; So it is more of what God is expecting
[1:46:29] us to do in giving situation than what
[1:46:33] we are expecting God to do
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; because he has given us the word.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; But I come back to this again. Brother
[1:46:44] Brandham says the power is lying
[1:46:46] dominant in the church. Yeah.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; The power that creative power
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; to say is uh let the mountain be is it's
[1:46:56] here. It's in you. The thing that is
[1:46:59] holding it back,
[1:47:02] unforgiveness.
[1:47:05] Praise the Lord. Because it all goes
[1:47:07] back to doubt and fear
[1:47:13] that we stay haunted in our mind that uh
[1:47:17] uh uh uh we could backslide.
[1:47:22] Are you still haunted in your mind that
[1:47:24] uh I mean uh that you could leave the
[1:47:26] message, you could stop serving God?
[1:47:36] Are you at that place?
[1:47:41] Are you still haunted with some
[1:47:43] questions in your mind? Are there are
[1:47:46] there questions that are tempering with
[1:47:48] your faith?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:01] Because forgiveness
[1:48:05] is the bedrock is the foundation of
[1:48:07] faith.
[1:48:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] And when faith comes
[1:48:15] to it's just like that seed when that
[1:48:18] seed has burst out of the shed and
[1:48:22] starts to spring out the sky is it
[1:48:25] limit.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Then it will add onto itself leaves. It
[1:48:31] add onto itself branches. It add onto
[1:48:33] itself fruits.
[1:48:36] It is the same thing that Paul I mean
[1:48:38] Peter is saying.
[1:48:40] Add onto your faith.
[1:48:42] Add unto virtue. Knowledge. Add unto
[1:48:46] knowledge. Temperance.
[1:48:48] It all comes from the seed.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not something you
[1:48:54] have to practice. It comes from where
[1:48:57] your faith it solidly based on the word
[1:49:01] of God.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:05] Your faith is not is not like he said in
[1:49:08] in in uh uh Ephesians, we are not tossed
[1:49:12] about
[1:49:14] with every wings
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; every little thing that come around.
[1:49:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; We have a solid faith.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are things that will happen
[1:49:29] and when and and and whenever these
[1:49:31] things happen you know uh uh we have
[1:49:34] been taught we are at a place to realize
[1:49:37] that uh nothing will happen to us until
[1:49:39] God allow it
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; and when anything happen praise God he
[1:49:43] allowing it's another opportunity for a
[1:49:45] testimony it's another opportunity for
[1:49:47] God to show himself
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; it's not well to the place I will say
[1:49:51] why me Lord why why all of these years
[1:49:53] I've been serving you why why
[1:50:05] Are we together?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; And you see the out of the why question
[1:50:09] goes back to a place of doubt and guilt.
[1:50:14] That's the reason why many times when we
[1:50:16] are dealing things dealing with things
[1:50:17] in our life, we start to go back and
[1:50:20] start digging. Is there something that I
[1:50:22] did that God did not forgive me for?
[1:50:26] Why? Because there is still an element
[1:50:28] of guilt
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; that keeps haunting us.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Why all of these things happening to me?
[1:50:36] Is there something that I've done,
[1:50:39] man? We must come up to age.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; We must come up to age. I I mean it is
[1:50:48] it it it it don't look real to you but
[1:50:51] you see religious pressure
[1:50:55] if the council the the the Sahedrin's
[1:50:59] council could pressure that man h that
[1:51:03] young man and and and and just give him
[1:51:06] every court that is in the book and
[1:51:09] everything to prove to him that he was
[1:51:11] not blind. If there was not an inner
[1:51:14] experience, if there was not something
[1:51:17] that has captured his his his heart, if
[1:51:20] there was not something that was real to
[1:51:22] him that he know that now he can tell
[1:51:24] the difference between colors. I might
[1:51:26] not be able to explain it, but I'm
[1:51:29] seeing things better than I used to see
[1:51:30] it before. I'm understanding things
[1:51:33] better than I used to understand it
[1:51:34] before.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] Now, recently I was I was uh
[1:51:52] reading the story of a Jewish girl and
[1:51:55] her brother
[1:52:00] that became Christians.
[1:52:02] and they were talking to this uh
[1:52:04] Christian family
[1:52:07] and uh
[1:52:14] and the lady took uh the the the New
[1:52:17] Testament
[1:52:18] and started to they took the the the
[1:52:21] Torah and started to show comparison the
[1:52:23] fulfillment of the of the of the Old
[1:52:25] Testament in the New Testament. You
[1:52:27] know, this Christian family
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; and uh the the the young lady says they
[1:52:34] could see the reality
[1:52:37] but the fear
[1:52:39] because of all that they were taught
[1:52:43] of Judaism.
[1:52:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:49] And then uh uh her brother got safe
[1:52:54] and he uh he was out. The parents found
[1:52:58] out that he got saved. He came back
[1:53:01] home. He, you know, he uh first prayers
[1:53:04] did not find out. It was his sister that
[1:53:06] found out, you know, and u uh he decided
[1:53:11] that he would not go to see the woman
[1:53:12] again. You know, he don't want to see
[1:53:14] her again. He don't want to talk
[1:53:16] anything. You know, he got rid of his
[1:53:17] Bible and everything. And then he was to
[1:53:20] his house trying to practice Judaism.
[1:53:23] Amen. So, so what so what is happening
[1:53:26] there is that the light that he have
[1:53:27] seen, he's closing his eyes. He's making
[1:53:30] every effort not to see
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus as the one that fulfilled Isaiah
[1:53:35] 53.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; He's closing. He's doing everything.
[1:53:40] But you see the thing about it is that
[1:53:44] when your eyes comes open.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Because you did not open it, you can't
[1:53:49] close it.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; The principle of he that open it and no
[1:53:54] man close it.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; You did not open it. You can't close it.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He tried everything. Everything.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; So one day the his sister asked him, you
[1:54:09] know, believing that her brother has
[1:54:11] come back to Judaism, asking for them to
[1:54:13] go and they say, "Okay, when we go, we
[1:54:16] must not talk anything about the Bible,
[1:54:18] not anything in this." But you see, it's
[1:54:21] a work that is done in
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; the heart of the believer.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And it's the most miserable feeling
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; after God has dealt with our hearts,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; after God has revealed truth to us and
[1:54:38] you don't want to see it. You want to
[1:54:40] unsee what you have seen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; He's of age.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Let him speak for himself. Amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; And if you are of age tonight, you must
[1:54:58] speak for yourself.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; You don't need me to confirm that you
[1:55:06] have the Holy Ghost. You must know what
[1:55:08] God is doing in your life
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; and stand and speak for yourself. Speak
[1:55:12] to that devil. Speak to your mind
[1:55:15] battles.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; You must speak for yourself if you are
[1:55:21] of age.
[1:55:24] If you can't speak for yourself and I
[1:55:27] mean you you you just you want us to to
[1:55:30] pick you up, we will do it. We will just
[1:55:32] want to understand that you have not
[1:55:34] grown yet.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; You might get a little bit over with for
[1:55:39] us. But I mean we we will be able to
[1:55:41] carry you the best that we can. But what
[1:55:44] we understand is that you have not grown
[1:55:46] yet. Oh yes.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; If you are of age, you must speak for
[1:55:52] yourself.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Speak to your situations.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; You must speak for yourself
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; because just like how the Pharisees was
[1:56:02] trying to destroy the evidence but the
[1:56:06] man himself was the evidence. Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; What has happened happened in his own
[1:56:10] life.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] And that is the reason why we cannot
[1:56:15] look at what is happening far. You look
[1:56:17] at what is God doing in your life.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Now what happened yesterday? What
[1:56:24] happened today?
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; What is happening now?
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; What is he doing right now in your life?
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; What is your experience with God?
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Don't make the past your history.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Or else I mean don't make the past your
[1:56:38] hero or else your hero will be dead.
[1:56:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I believe we are of age.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; We can speak for ourselves.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Ask me what God is doing here. I will
[1:56:54] tell you.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Because I believe it
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm part of it.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Ask me what God is doing in my home. I
[1:57:03] will tell you.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Because I'm part of that house.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; I believe what he's doing there.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Ask me what he's doing in my life, I
[1:57:10] will tell you. Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Because I'm of age.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And there's no time to be toast about
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; with they say this and they say that and
[1:57:20] the other person say this and the other
[1:57:21] person say that.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you tonight.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come up.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Father, that the young Jewish boy and
[1:57:36] guilt end up believing the Lord Jesus.
[1:57:38] They were rejected by their parents and
[1:57:41] that young girl had to suffer a lot of
[1:57:45] lot of trouble in her walk with God
[1:57:50] just because they have believed the
[1:57:52] Christian faith. But the the the the
[1:57:56] thing of the story there is that you
[1:57:58] cannot unseen you know you cannot unsee
[1:58:01] what God has shown you what he have
[1:58:05] opened your eyes to. Praise the Lord.
[1:58:08] Hallelujah.
[1:58:10] Amen. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:58:14] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:58:20] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:58:24] I want to see you.
[1:58:29] And I want to see you.
[1:58:34] Oh, open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:58:41] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:58:45] I want to see you.
[1:58:51] I want to see you.
[1:58:56] to see you high and lifted up.
[1:59:03] Shining in the light of your glory.
[1:59:08] Pour out your power and love as we sing.
[1:59:14] Holy, holy, holy,
[1:59:20] holy, holy, holy.
[1:59:24] I want to see you. Let's stand on our
[1:59:28] feet tonight. Yes. Open the eyes of my
[1:59:33] heart, Lord.
[1:59:36] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:59:40] I want to see you.
[1:59:46] I want to see you.
[1:59:52] Oh, open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:59:58] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:00:02] I want to see you.
[2:00:07] And I want to see you.
[2:00:13] to see you hide and lift all
[2:00:19] shining in the light of your glory.
[2:00:25] Who are your coward and Lord as we sing
[2:00:31] holy, holy, holy,
[2:00:36] holy, holy, holy.
[2:00:41] I want to see you. Let's sing that one
[2:00:45] more time. Lord, open the eyes of my
[2:00:50] heart, Lord.
[2:00:53] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:00:57] I want to see you.
[2:01:02] I want to see you.
[2:01:07] Oh,
[2:01:09] open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2:01:15] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:01:19] I want to see you.
[2:01:24] I want to see you.
[2:01:29] To see you high and lifted up.
[2:01:36] Shine me in the light of your glory.
[2:01:42] Pour out your power and love as we sing
[2:01:48] holy, holy, holy,
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:53] holy, holy, holy.
[2:01:58] I want to see you.
[2:02:07] Fed is a free gift. God has given it to
[2:02:10] you.
[2:02:13] It's a seed that comes with your birth.
[2:02:16] [Music]
[2:02:18] It's a seed that comes with your birth.
[2:02:21] The thing that is stopping us from uh
[2:02:25] operating in faith, walking in faith,
[2:02:28] living in faith, speaking in faith.
[2:02:32] Sometimes it's a sense of condemnation,
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:37] things that we allow in our life that we
[2:02:39] shooting.
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:55] A sense of fear,
[2:02:58] a sense of doubt.
[2:03:01] [Music]
[2:03:06] But faith is there. It will it will
[2:03:09] handle you from operating.
[2:03:11] It will handle you from walking in
[2:03:13] faith.
[2:03:15] It will handle you for faith to be as
[2:03:18] fully expressed in you
[2:03:21] because you are allowing something that
[2:03:23] is contrary to the word.
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:32] When your faith come up to be a mature
[2:03:36] faith, a faith that has that has stand
[2:03:39] the storm, a faith that can stand alone
[2:03:43] with God,
[2:03:44] a faith that can believe God for the
[2:03:47] impossible.
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Then that faith will give birth to
[2:03:54] virtue.
[2:03:57] God will add onto your faith virtue and
[2:04:00] people will be strengthened from your
[2:04:02] life.
[2:04:05] Virtue came out of him. The Bible said
[2:04:08] people were healed in the shadows of
[2:04:11] Peter
[2:04:13] because his faith was a mature faith.
[2:04:21] Then virtue will give will give birth to
[2:04:24] knowledge and God will add knowledge to
[2:04:27] your virtue.
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:34] You we will have some sense of spiritual
[2:04:37] discernment. We will not just be we will
[2:04:39] not have kind of judgment. Lot of our
[2:04:42] judgment are kind of judgment because
[2:04:45] they said this, because they look at me
[2:04:47] like this, because I I It's just kind of
[2:04:50] judgment. It's not discernment.
[2:04:53] It's not knowledge at all.
[2:04:57] You cannot base it on the word.
[2:05:02] But it goes back to that place of fear.
[2:05:06] It goes back to that place of guilt.
[2:05:09] It goes back to that place of
[2:05:11] condemnation.
[2:05:13] It go back to that place of unforgiving.
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:24] If you if we experience if we have
[2:05:27] really come into the atmosphere of God's
[2:05:30] forgiveness, if we have break away from
[2:05:33] our fear, if you if we if you experience
[2:05:35] that, I mean there is nothing nothing
[2:05:38] you can hold against any mortar.
[2:05:41] Nothing you can hold against any mortar.
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:53] Heavenly Father,
[2:05:57] that man was born blind. We were born in
[2:05:59] sin and shipless in iniquity. Our
[2:06:02] condition, Lord, Father, is even worse
[2:06:05] than his Lord.
[2:06:08] But Father, that's a that's a that just
[2:06:10] a biblical description of us born is sin
[2:06:13] shiply in iniquity. Father God, come to
[2:06:16] the word speaking lies.
[2:06:19] And yet the message of the hour of the
[2:06:21] word of God, Jesus Christ,
[2:06:24] the Lord Jesus Christ came our way. This
[2:06:28] is not a church thing. It's not a
[2:06:31] religious thing. It's a personal
[2:06:33] experience.
[2:06:36] He met this man. He took him by the
[2:06:38] hands
[2:06:40] just like he took you by the hands and
[2:06:43] brought us into a personal experience.
[2:06:46] He took a clay the man couldn't see it
[2:06:49] but the man could feel it. He said he
[2:06:51] took a clay and he rub it upon my eyes.
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:06] All of these people, they had testimony
[2:07:09] and they know that this boy was born
[2:07:11] blind. They know that this is he. This
[2:07:14] is he. Is he really the one?
[2:07:17] They had to call the parents. Do you
[2:07:19] have another son?
[2:07:22] Is it really the one that was born
[2:07:24] blind? Can you see how blind those
[2:07:26] Pharisees were?
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:36] Sometimes uh we just we just
[2:07:39] let's let's not hide behind this
[2:07:41] message. This message is the light of
[2:07:44] God. It's it's is it's the light of God
[2:07:46] to open our eyes.
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:57] He want us to grow in the things that we
[2:07:59] have seen, in the things that we have
[2:08:01] heard.
[2:08:05] Heavenly Father,
[2:08:08] we stand tonight. Oh God, we stand
[2:08:11] tonight. Jesus,
[2:08:13] precious Lord,
[2:08:17] this hour is upon us. This is our day.
[2:08:19] This is our time, oh God.
[2:08:24] Are we going to be suaded away by people
[2:08:27] testimony or what people says about
[2:08:31] a brother or what people says about this
[2:08:34] church or what they think about the
[2:08:37] message or what they said about are we
[2:08:39] going to be sued
[2:08:43] you are of age
[2:08:47] be able to speak for myself.
[2:08:51] When we were children, we talked like
[2:08:53] children.
[2:08:55] We struggle with peer pressure.
[2:08:58] We run after one another.
[2:09:02] But Paul says when we are full grown, we
[2:09:05] speak for ourself.
[2:09:10] We speak for ourself. We speak faith in
[2:09:13] love.
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:19] Father, help us tonight, Lord God, that
[2:09:22] we can be able to speak to our storm.
[2:09:25] We can be able to speak love, Father, to
[2:09:27] to the wings of doubts that the enemy,
[2:09:30] Father, is trying to to throw on our
[2:09:33] mind and want us to accept whatever
[2:09:35] condition you said. Whatsoever we desire
[2:09:38] in our hearts, oh God, whatsoever we
[2:09:41] have heard in our hearts, Lord,
[2:09:42] whatsoever we have been believing for
[2:09:45] you, oh God, you said, whatever we
[2:09:47] desire in our heart and we ask it, oh
[2:09:49] God,
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:10:01] Father, we thank you tonight.
[2:10:04] We thank you, precious Lord Jesus. Thank
[2:10:07] you, Father God.
[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:13] And your grace, Lord Jesus, has dealt
[2:10:16] with us. You have heard our hands. You
[2:10:18] have brought us this far, oh God.
[2:10:25] Shedra, Mishad and Abednego they were of
[2:10:27] age. They said king even if God do not
[2:10:31] deliver us we are not going to deny him.
[2:10:37] Daniel were of old age.
[2:10:42] He didn't care what the king's
[2:10:44] commandment was as long as it were
[2:10:46] contrary to the word of God. He lift up
[2:10:48] his hands in prayer three times a day.
[2:10:57] Father, try to bring that solidness to
[2:10:59] our faith. Oh God, try to bring, oh God,
[2:11:03] Father, pull us, Lord, to that place,
[2:11:06] Lord. Pull us to that place. There's no
[2:11:09] time, oh God, Father, for comparison,
[2:11:12] comparing, oh God, Father, Lord Jesus,
[2:11:15] who is here, who is not here. As long as
[2:11:18] I know that Jesus is here. As long as I
[2:11:21] know he promised to meet us, oh God. Oh
[2:11:24] father, give me grace. Give me strength,
[2:11:26] Lord Jesus. Let me be able to show up
[2:11:28] with you. Let me stand. Oh God, let me
[2:11:31] take sides with your word. Oh God, let
[2:11:33] me take sides with you, Father. Lord
[2:11:35] God, bring us to full age, Lord. Bring
[2:11:38] us to maturity, oh God. Father, that you
[2:11:41] promise you will never leave us. You
[2:11:43] will never forsake us. No matter what is
[2:11:45] going around our life, we have to
[2:11:47] believe that you are in control. Father
[2:11:49] God, we are not going back. Lord God,
[2:11:52] Father, if if if I confess that sin, I
[2:11:55] sincerely confess it. I place it under
[2:11:58] the blood. You don't have to be visiting
[2:12:00] the other time. Oh God, forgive me. He
[2:12:03] said, because of this that I've done,
[2:12:07] he's not an Indian giver.
[2:12:14] Every breath that I take,
[2:12:19] every moment I'm awake,
[2:12:27] I'll have your way.
[2:12:31] Oh yes, Lord, I give you my heart.
[2:12:39] I gave you my soul.
[2:12:47] Lay for you. For you alone,
[2:12:54] every breath that I take,
[2:12:59] every moment I'm awake,
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:06] your heart has your way. Oh Jesus,
[2:13:13] Lord, I give you my heart.
[2:13:18] I give you my soul.
[2:13:26] I live for you. For you alone.
[2:13:33] Every breath that I take,
[2:13:38] every moment I will win.
[2:13:46] your heart, your way.
[2:13:52] Father, pray tonight. Oh God, Lord
[2:13:55] Jesus,
[2:13:58] just like Paul says, you're bringing us
[2:14:00] to a perfect man. You're bringing us to
[2:14:03] a measure in Christ.
[2:14:06] A measure, Father. Lord, you are taking
[2:14:09] us, oh God. Father, we're right into the
[2:14:11] holiest of holy. We have gone past the
[2:14:15] altar cord. We have gone past the inner
[2:14:18] call, the church ages. We arrived in the
[2:14:21] presence of the glory of the Lord.
[2:14:24] So God, we pray, Father, this evening.
[2:14:27] Help us, Lord.
[2:14:29] Help us, oh Father God, we are living in
[2:14:32] a time, Lord, where we must be able to
[2:14:34] speak to our storm.
[2:14:36] Father God, we must be able to tell that
[2:14:38] devil, you get her from here.
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:44] We must not be living under
[2:14:46] condemnation. If we are doing things
[2:14:48] that we must not do, Father give us
[2:14:51] grace. Bring convict our hearts Lord.
[2:14:54] Convict our heart Lord Jesus to get away
[2:14:57] from it
[2:14:59] because there is no way we will grow in
[2:15:01] faith this way. There is no way we will
[2:15:04] grow in faith.
[2:15:07] [Music]
[2:15:09] We love you tonight. We appreciate you.
[2:15:12] Bless us until we meet here on Sunday.
[2:15:15] Go with each and every one of us and
[2:15:16] bless the rest of our week. In Jesus
[2:15:19] name we pray.
[2:15:22] Amen.
[2:15:24] Amen.
[2:15:26] Praise the Lord. The Lord bless you. We
[2:15:28] are dismissed. Let's go in Jesus name.
[2:15:32] Amen.
[2:15:33] Take the name of Jesus with you. Let's
[2:15:36] sing there. And we are dismissed.
[2:15:46] with you
[2:15:48] child of sorrow and of
[2:15:56] it will joy come for
[2:16:01] you
[2:16:06] everywhere you go this
