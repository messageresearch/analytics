[0:00] do you see that he was wounded for our
[0:02] transgressions with the stripes we were
[0:05] healed when you look away can you see
[0:08] that or can you just see one side of the
[0:10] atonement can you see both sides of it
[0:13] when you look if you look at through the
[0:15] Creed they'll tell you the days of
[0:17] healing is past but if you look at
[0:20] through the word you'll see he's the
[0:21] same yesterday today and forever
[0:25] the disciples looked to him when they
[0:30] were in a trouble see and they saw the
[0:33] only help that could help him coming
[0:36] Martha look to him in a time of death
[0:39] and she saw he was a resurrection in the
[0:43] life amen
[0:46] in time of death Martha saw when she
[0:50] looked at him he had been rejected by
[0:53] her people he had been turned down even
[0:57] she had sent for him and he did not come
[0:59] to her brother but when finally he come
[1:02] and she went and fell down so she could
[1:04] look at him she found out that he was
[1:06] both resurrection and life a man jiraiya
[1:11] stood the same thing a secret believer a
[1:14] little Presbyterian methodist baptist
[1:16] that really believed but couldn't get
[1:19] around on the count of his denomination
[1:21] with let him because he'd be
[1:23] excommunicated but he's only little
[1:26] daughter lay at the part of death and he
[1:30] had to go but when he found him he found
[1:34] out that he was a resurrection in life
[1:37] when he sent farmer runner come and said
[1:39] don't trouble the master or the girl
[1:42] he's already dead he and his little
[1:44] heart almost failed but he said did not
[1:45] I say if you'll only believe you'll see
[1:48] the glory of God dries found out that he
[1:51] could raise up today and when he looked
[1:55] at Jesus
[1:56] the hungry looked to him and found
[2:00] sustaining food for life that was
[2:03] natural
[2:04] the hungry spiritual can look to him and
[2:07] find out he's the bread of life
[2:10] the dyeing feet look to see what he
[2:13] could see and he found in Jesus's porn
[2:17] remember me Lord when thou comest into
[2:20] that kingdom jesus said today shalt thou
[2:22] be with me in paradise that's what he
[2:24] saw in the hour of his death the sick
[2:27] look dream and saw the healer the blind
[2:31] look and could see depends on what
[2:34] you're looking at now what do you look
[2:36] Peter and Nathanael looked and seen the
[2:40] promised word other prophet Moses made
[2:43] manifest the Lord your God shall raise
[2:47] up a prophet liken unto me and to him
[2:51] the people shall clean and all that
[2:53] don't believe him and hear that prophet
[2:55] will be cut off from the people and when
[2:58] Peter walked up into his presence Jesus
[3:01] said your name is Simon and you are the
[3:06] son of Jonas he knew right then when he
[3:10] looked the first time all Jesus that
[3:11] there was a fulfillment of what the Word
[3:14] of God said he'd be hey I wonder if you
[3:18] found the same thing when you looked at
[3:19] him for the first time I wonder if the
[3:22] promise word manifest itself to you when
[3:26] you looked at him Nathanael as soon as
[3:29] he come into the presence of Jesus a
[3:31] little bit and down we find out that
[3:35] Philip had went and told him come see
[3:37] who we found and Nathanael come and he
[3:42] said which one is he he said probably
[3:43] someone up there praying for the sick he
[3:46] pressed his way through to get a look at
[3:48] him
[3:48] and when he looked Jesus said Behold an
[3:51] Israelite and whom there's no guy he
[3:56] said rabbi when did you ever know me he
[3:58] said before Philip called you when you
[4:00] were under the tree I saw you then what
[4:04] didn't attain you'll find he found out
[4:06] that there was the king of Israel he
[4:09] said thou art the son of God you are the
[4:11] king of Israel that's what he saw when
[4:14] he looked he got the interpretation of
[4:19] the scripture brought to light before
[4:22] him
[4:23] he saw it the same scripture that the
[4:27] anointed prophet Moses had said he will
[4:31] be a prophet likened unto me the woman
[4:34] at the well she got a look one time and
[4:38] what did she see she expressed it in the
[4:41] city she said come see a man who told me
[4:46] that things are done
[4:47] isn't this the very Messiah when she
[4:50] took her first look at Jesus Christ she
[4:53] saw the Messiah people can look at the
[4:56] same thing today and call it mental
[4:59] telepathy
[5:00] they have College spiritualism they'll
[5:03] call it any kind of devil mean they can
[5:05] call it because they don't know what
[5:07] they're looking for a man I don't
[5:11] understand they're looking for greed
[5:14] they're looking for our genius to set
[5:16] the church in order they're looking for
[5:17] more members and fail to see the Blessed
[5:20] Lord Jesus Christ it is identified word
[5:24] rang depends on what you're looking for
[5:28] if you're looking for the fulfillment of
[5:31] the promise of today you'll see it but
[5:35] if you're looking for some interaction
[5:36] or something that they've always looked
[5:39] for some great found or some historian
[5:41] some other person something else you'll
[5:44] fail to see it but when you look at him
[5:46] through the word the word declares who
[5:49] yes he challenged the people of his days
[5:53] to do the same they conceived he said
[5:55] you blind leaders of the blind you clean
[5:57] Moses to be your prophet if you have
[6:00] known Moses you ignore me Moses wrote
[6:04] about me and they were too glad to sit
[6:08] looking right at it and too blind to sin
[6:12] I'm dovetailing that glare this morning
[6:15] for a few minutes you see they're
[6:16] looking and don't know what they're
[6:18] looking for because they've got the
[6:21] wrong conception of what you're trying
[6:23] to find how would you know what you
[6:26] wanted to find if you didn't know what
[6:28] you was looking for
[6:30] how would you go hunt for a pumpkin and
[6:32] you never seem on an ever heard one
[6:35] how would you go find a watermelon if
[6:37] you never know there was such a thing in
[6:38] hot look why you could find a tub and
[6:41] think it was a watermelon you can find
[6:44] something else you could find a block
[6:45] and think it was a watermelon but you've
[6:48] got to know what you're looking for and
[6:51] the only way you'll never know what
[6:52] you're gonna what you're looking for if
[6:54] you're looking for Jesus you'll look to
[6:56] the word for he is the word they are
[7:01] they that testify of me search the
[7:04] Scriptures yeah you claim you are the
[7:08] believers of the prophets but you're
[7:11] your father the devil
[7:12] your father's you claim when God sent
[7:15] the promised tomb he put him in the
[7:17] grave they they kill the prophets every
[7:21] one that comes G zhis said which one of
[7:23] your father's didn't stone and the works
[7:26] of your father you do P man righteous
[7:31] man holy man a man that you come to put
[7:34] a finger on and yet he called him
[7:36] serpents and devils what are you looking
[7:39] for if you're looking for some pious
[7:41] person some people thinks it because the
[7:45] Holy Spirit would work to you you'd have
[7:47] to be some long spies feller walk around
[7:50] and not even that's not the Holy Spirit
[7:52] God don't deal to angels like that are
[7:56] supposed to be God deals you man the
[7:59] Bible said Elijah was a man subject to
[8:03] like passions as we are but you couldn't
[8:05] be with him till you seen Jesus Peter
[8:08] and John at the gate called beautiful
[8:10] and when they pulled him up there about
[8:12] healing that man they perceived that
[8:14] they were ignorant unlearned it but the
[8:18] also perceived that they had been with
[8:21] Jesus
[8:23] because his life was reflecting through
[8:25] them now depends on what you're looking
[8:28] for
[8:29] the woman had read the Bible she know
[8:32] there was a coming Messiah and she know
[8:34] what that Messiah would do and as soon
[8:36] as Jesus said to her bring me a drink
[8:38] she said it's not customary he's just an
[8:41] ordinary man
[8:42] now if he'd been sitting there was a
[8:43] great big turban on and all kinds of
[8:45] armlets over him of some holy person
[8:48] well the woman had said well there's a
[8:49] priest and went on or there's some
[8:52] copper rabbi went on minister something
[8:55] that I've seen a man come to eat today
[8:57] where I went to eat and that fella come
[9:00] in here
[9:00] you had enough crosses and things on you
[9:03] it's a good thing sometimes then fellows
[9:06] had that I think you're to live a life
[9:09] you don't have to have a lot of clergy
[9:11] clothes to prove what you are sometimes
[9:13] they drink carry on so much to smoke
[9:15] cigarettes and everything that's where
[9:17] clergy clothes even over there a
[9:18] minister or not that's trying I'll tell
[9:22] you the clergy clothes for a man to wear
[9:24] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[9:26] that'll identify you as being with Jesus
[9:30] now we find out there depends on what
[9:34] you're looking for a well-dressed Rael
[9:35] groom some kind of a turban you'll never
[9:38] see him because he was just an ordinary
[9:40] man God deals with man Jesus was a man
[9:43] God was in the man and he was gone
[9:46] now we find out that this woman when she
[9:50] saw this mysterious sign that he could
[9:54] tell her what she had done that was
[9:56] wrong or what was on her heart she knew
[10:00] right then that was the Messiah so when
[10:02] she looked at Jesus she saw the Messiah
[10:06] the Messiah
[10:08] what was the works of the Messiah we
[10:09] know the secret of the heart did that
[10:13] catch you right I wonder if you'll
[10:16] understand if you look for him tonight
[10:18] what would you look for you'd be the
[10:21] same the Messiah is the word the word
[10:25] and the Bible said in Hebrews the fourth
[10:26] chapter that the Word of God is quicker
[10:29] more powerful than a two-edged sword
[10:30] cutting even to the Sun or bone and aid
[10:33] Cerner of the thoughts that's in the
[10:35] heart and when she know that Messiah was
[10:39] to be that word made manifest and he
[10:41] could tell her what was wrong with her
[10:42] she knowed that was Messiah not how he's
[10:46] dressed not how much education he had
[10:49] but by the sign that he shoulder he was
[10:53] Messiah when she saw Jesus she saw the
[10:57] Messiah God in a man as promised for
[11:01] that anointed age but you know what many
[11:04] of them same age that I have spoke of
[11:07] never seen that thing many of them
[11:12] didn't see it same today granny didn't
[11:17] recognize Moses Manny didn't recognize
[11:19] Elijah many did they never recognized it
[11:22] till they're gone
[11:24] then they recognized it the unbelievers
[11:27] seen in the days of Noah only what did
[11:30] the unbelief look at I've told you what
[11:32] to believers saw now let's see what the
[11:34] unbeliever saw in the days of Noah what
[11:37] did the unbeliever saw see back there
[11:39] when they look they saw a fanatic
[11:42] blundering around on a so-called boat
[11:45] that's all they saw some crazy old man
[11:50] the long white whiskers that had lost
[11:53] his mind and against scientific research
[11:56] and proof said this water up there well
[11:59] poor old fellow they felt sorry for him
[12:01] passing by he'll be declared insane soon
[12:04] he's lost his mind but he had the word
[12:06] of the Lord he was building away on it
[12:08] and God was showing evidence that the
[12:10] flood was coming it was a sign to them
[12:13] them who did not believe nor story
[12:15] wandered on into darkness and ended up
[12:18] and death in the water and a grave of
[12:21] hell they ruled
[12:23] he looked one time what did he saw why I
[12:26] saw Pharaoh
[12:27] he's seen a fanatic so-called prophet
[12:31] with many so-called claims of deliveries
[12:34] that's only saw a mud dauber a slave
[12:37] standing up amongst the people and
[12:39] saying himself a son of God to perform
[12:41] miracles while they thought they fell or
[12:44] lost said go let him rave on
[12:46] came in seen in July but he had thus
[12:49] saith along the believers Aaron Joshua
[12:54] and many haven't seen God in Moses and
[12:57] the works of God Moses done that's the
[13:01] reason they know God was in him they
[13:04] looked and saw God in Moses the rich man
[13:08] looked and seen exactly who he was see
[13:12] but he refused to follow him because he
[13:17] loved the things of the world too much
[13:20] to follow Jesus how many are rich man
[13:24] well listen to this tape of that time
[13:26] don't have to be always rich in money no
[13:30] you can be rich and lust rich and
[13:33] pleasures of this life how many men how
[13:37] many young girls how many young boys
[13:39] will not sell out their popularity some
[13:43] sex queen are some Ricky with a badge or
[13:47] guitar poor not entertaining some rock
[13:50] and roll or some dance that he's able to
[13:52] do how many of clean that riches of
[13:55] popularity and refused when they set
[13:59] like the meetings and what's the hand of
[14:01] God move into Clary's word how many will
[14:05] do it he chose his denomination he could
[14:08] live by Jesus was a fanatic to his
[14:10] denomination so he had either take what
[14:12] Jesus said or either he had to take why
[14:15] didn't he go to his priests and say what
[14:16] can I do to have eternal life you know
[14:19] the priests know nothing about it so he
[14:21] come to Jesus and said what can I do
[14:22] jesus said keep the commandments taught
[14:24] it right back his left he said I've done
[14:26] this he said keeping the commandments
[14:28] and he still didn't have eternal life
[14:29] any note he didn't you can keep all the
[14:31] commandments he have got eternal life
[14:33] yet so jesus said now if you want to do
[14:36] what's right go sell what you got and
[14:37] give it to the poor come follow me that
[14:40] was too much for anything we find out
[14:42] that he looked and seen who he was but
[14:45] yet refused to take it and his next look
[14:49] was in hell looking away up and send
[14:52] Lazarus in the bosoms of Abraham pilot
[14:56] looked one time when they brought him he
[14:59] never seen him
[15:00] for his hands tied blood running out of
[15:04] his back a crown of thorns on his head
[15:09] Pilate looked and was convinced because
[15:14] a horse come galloping down the street
[15:16] and a rider jumped off and run over said
[15:19] here's a wife have sent you a letter and
[15:22] he looked at it and she said Pilate my
[15:26] beloved husband have nothing to do with
[15:30] that just man for today I've suffered
[15:33] many things in a dream because I mean he
[15:36] trembled his knees beat together and he
[15:40] said if you are the son of God if you're
[15:42] the king
[15:43] why don't you speak out are you the king
[15:45] of Israel he said you have said it that
[15:50] tell us truth he said to this end I was
[15:53] born and Pilate marvelled he all
[15:58] everybody was begging and crying at his
[16:00] feet he said I have power to kick your I
[16:03] have power to release he said you have
[16:05] power of nothing lesson he gives you in
[16:07] my father
[16:08] sir he was convinced so that was more
[16:11] than a man he was fairly convinced that
[16:14] it was more than a man certainly he was
[16:16] a what his politics and popularity was
[16:21] too great the he turned him down his
[16:26] popularity was too great the politics
[16:29] his position in life was too great to
[16:31] accept this for any wonder how many
[16:34] pilots will be listening to this that's
[16:37] your position in some denomination will
[16:40] be too great to accept the real Lord
[16:42] Jesus standing in the position that he
[16:47] is today the Roman soldier at the cross
[16:50] looked on Jesus after the earth had had
[16:53] a nervous prostration shook to the rocks
[16:56] wrung out of the mountains and there's
[16:59] someone out of the middle of a and
[17:00] turned dark the stars didn't come out to
[17:04] give its life in the earth burst forth
[17:07] with rocks and earthquake the zigzag
[17:10] line you swept the skies and ripped the
[17:12] temple to
[17:13] from the top to the bottom and people
[17:16] running to screaming they didn't want to
[17:18] take it place that Roman soldier that
[17:20] helped nailing their had punched the
[17:23] sword to his heart then he looked what
[17:27] was too late he looked and believed but
[17:31] it was too late for him to believe what
[17:33] he had done had sealed his doom
[17:36] he had run the spirit through the
[17:38] Savior's heart it was too late I wonder
[17:41] how many Romans today has done the same
[17:43] thing and will do the same thing you
[17:46] might look some day but it might look
[17:48] too late many of the day will come and
[17:52] that day and be the same way they have
[17:56] known brother woods your yesterday
[18:00] saying this is close it's in this
[18:02] message down your slider company a Roman
[18:06] Catholic setting there he went out and
[18:08] get some concrete for the church here
[18:10] and when he did he's told him where he
[18:12] wanted par the Roman Catholic studies
[18:15] that brother branham yes he said I say
[18:18] one thing when he prays God answers they
[18:22] wonder then knowing it
[18:25] seeing the vindication that is truly the
[18:30] gospel not me any man representing
[18:33] Christ a word we're talk about not man
[18:36] what am I trying to say is this that
[18:40] they see there clearly a vindicated word
[18:42] like power than the rest of them did
[18:44] like the Roman soldier but are you going
[18:47] to wait too late to do anything about it
[18:49] you should have used the spear the other
[18:52] way the doors will be closed like it was
[18:55] in the days of Noah and then it's too
[18:58] late you might wake up some morning say
[19:00] I intend to get out of this mess don't
[19:03] wait too long you better look and live
[19:05] now Luther looked away from the Catholic
[19:08] denomination what did he see a pillar of
[19:11] fire he saw an independent church
[19:14] Wesley looked away from the angle and
[19:17] denomination he saw the same thing the
[19:19] Pentecost looked away from all the
[19:22] denominations what did he become a great
[19:24] mighty people what did each one of them
[19:26] do
[19:27] when the founders Luther and Wesley mm
[19:31] and when they looked away and saw what
[19:33] they didn't start out their children
[19:35] come in behind him look back to where
[19:37] they come from out of the denomination
[19:40] took that group of people right back
[19:42] into the same mess at the came out of
[19:45] what are you looking at the founders
[19:48] look right but the people followed him
[19:51] look back to what the founders come out
[19:53] of her and had done exactly what the
[19:56] founders was against the Anointed One of
[19:59] God you know I got a hurry cause I got a
[20:03] prayer line coming in and whole menu has

[22:23] stepped out and said well I guess this
[22:24] is the end he said BRABUS you're
[22:27] absolutely free what I'm what I'm
[22:33] absolutely free you're free I said so
[22:37] how can I be free he says what come here
[22:40] BRABUS look up there you see that man
[22:43] dying up there he took your place I
[22:47] wonder if we all tonight to look and see
[22:50] what Brava saw someone taking our place
[22:53] he was wounded for our transgressions
[22:56] bruised for our iniquities the
[22:59] chastisement of our peace is upon him
[23:01] and with His stripes I was healed you
[23:04] were healed wonder if we either guilty
[23:06] ones who should be sick can see in him
[23:09] our deliverance you should go to hell
[23:12] seeing him your freedom your pass to
[23:15] heaven wonder if you can see what BRABUS
[23:18] saw on that day he said a little while
[23:21] and the world won't see me no more
[23:23] yet ye shall see me o Church then if he
[23:28] said you shall see me it's proof that
[23:31] you can look again you'll see me or I'll
[23:36] be with you even in you to the end of
[23:39] the world why how do you see him at the
[23:42] word he is the word look at the word and
[23:45] see what two promises for he's the same
[23:47] yesterday today and forever what he was
[23:52] when he walked in Galilee is the same
[23:55] is tonight in Jeffersonville the same
[23:58] thing he is at the Branham Tabernacle
[24:00] what do you look to see a founder a
[24:02] denominational man
[24:04] you'll never sit in Jesus do you look to
[24:07] see some great priestly you'll never see
[24:10] it in Jesus no how do you see Jesus by
[24:13] the Word of God being made manifest
[24:16] because he was a manifested Word of God
[24:19] what he was then he is tonight and will
[24:22] be forever let's bow our heads just a
[24:24] moment I'll cut this off kind of shortly
[24:29] Lord Jesus is my prayer let me look away
[24:34] from the cares of life Lord I know we're
[24:38] just a common people uneducated we have
[24:42] not much of this world's goods but we
[24:46] love you Lord and I'll speak for this
[24:48] people they were not set in a place like
[24:50] this a squeeze and mashing around in the
[24:53] crowds and set burning up in the heat
[24:56] are freezing in the cold and standing it
[24:58] and bringing their children and them
[25:00] sick and the afflicted coming around if
[25:02] they come here to see anything else
[25:04] besides you those people Lord would
[25:08] never come to see a man there's plenty
[25:11] of man on the street they all look alike
[25:12] but they come to see that man that man
[25:16] of God that Jesus of Nazareth a flesh
[25:21] being gone now father you have told us
[25:26] that a little while in the world would
[25:29] not seen him or no matter how much they
[25:31] look they'll never see it but you said
[25:34] ye shall see me the true believer
[25:37] because I'll be with you even in you to
[25:41] the end of the world
[25:42] you promised us if we look we would see
[25:45] and I pray tonight that you'll fulfill
[25:48] that scripture to us again tonight that
[25:51] we might look and see Jesus making
[25:55] himself known to us in the same way that
[25:58] he always has fulfilling his word from
[26:03] henceforth Lord and I made a statement
[26:05] before this and I've
[26:07] truly said these things from my heart
[26:10] about the pools and that you told me and
[26:13] now as mysterious as it may seem if we
[26:18] could only pitch our inner conscience
[26:20] and see that those things could not be
[26:23] foretold perfectly as they are unless it
[26:28] did come from God how could we see that
[26:32] first thing take place how could the
[26:35] second take place how could the third
[26:37] take place how could we stand here
[26:41] months before happened and tell what
[26:43] would take place in Tucson and would
[26:45] open up the seven seals and bring back
[26:47] the mystery and reveal the hidden things
[26:49] of God that's been here since the
[26:51] beginning of time and to see it both
