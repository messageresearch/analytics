[28:30] Yes.
[28:31] [Music]
[28:33] Yes.
[28:37] [Music]
[28:41] Oh,
[28:43] wrong
[28:45] way.
[28:47] Oh, this
[28:49] is
[28:50] [Music]
[28:52] my
[28:53] [Music]
[28:58] teach.
[28:59] [Music]
[29:06] Now, you think about this before we
[29:09] pray.
[29:11] Think about this.
[29:14] I believe that uh
[29:18] the disciples one time
[29:25] after being around our Lord Jesus
[29:30] and seeing how he was dedicated to
[29:33] praying.
[29:36] I believe this too bad and and hear him
[29:39] speaking to the father, lifting up his
[29:41] his voice and thanking God.
[29:47] And he came and said, "Lord, teach us
[29:49] how to pray."
[29:53] And we know that in this in the hour in
[29:56] the time that we are living in,
[29:59] if there is if there is one thing across
[30:02] the board
[30:04] that the enemy get
[30:07] towards every one of us,
[30:12] it's our prayer time. We can never pray
[30:15] enough.
[30:19] We can never pray enough.
[30:22] It is not
[30:24] The amount of time
[30:28] [Music]
[30:29] just like brother Brandon said we read
[30:31] the other day,
[30:33] our intentions,
[30:36] our half a cry, how we pour ourself out
[30:42] in that moment that we stay before him.
[30:48] Since we have to realize that
[30:52] we have a we have an age and
[30:55] uh the lead is taken out of hell through
[31:00] the wave of the four dimension
[31:04] that we all are connected to one way or
[31:06] the other.
[31:08] We have to do everything on our phone.
[31:12] I mean the time we spend on our phone
[31:14] and the way we could be easily
[31:16] distracted,
[31:18] we want to make a call, you want to send
[31:20] a text and you have to check this and
[31:22] and check that and and and uh and and
[31:25] and just to see how and and and and for
[31:30] for many they they are just caught up in
[31:32] that place of the fourth dimension
[31:35] feeding on the things there and and and
[31:37] sometimes it it it take away our
[31:40] strength and sometimes Uh I mean we
[31:43] spend hours and hours in time there that
[31:46] uh uh for some they have to use it for
[31:49] work. For some uh uh I mean they they
[31:52] become creative and they send out things
[31:54] to edify others. But for for some and
[31:58] for most
[32:01] we just consume the news and consume and
[32:03] and all all the negative thing that is
[32:06] out there.
[32:09] And that's a real of the fourth
[32:10] dimension.
[32:13] That's a real but we know that we are
[32:16] called to a higher realm.
[32:20] We are called
[32:22] to heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[32:28] So you think about it now.
[32:33] I believe there was something that the
[32:35] disciples saw. There was something that
[32:38] they felt. There was something that was
[32:40] different.
[32:42] They saw him entering in and they said,
[32:45] "Lord, teach us how to pray."
[32:48] Just like John
[32:51] taught his disciples.
[32:54] Heavenly Father, Almighty God, Lord
[32:57] Jesus,
[32:59] that is that is with every one of us,
[33:01] Lord. We we Lord God, we all father God
[33:06] need Lord a prayer life. The Apostle
[33:10] Paul encouraged us to pray in and out of
[33:13] season, Lord God. Oh, Father God, we I I
[33:18] just pray tonight, Lord God. Father that
[33:21] even Lord as we come oh God father Lord
[33:24] Jesus to the Wednesday service oh God
[33:27] and especially around this time oh
[33:29] father Lord we want to thank you Lord
[33:31] God for brother Lawrence and and just
[33:33] praying that God father you would you
[33:35] would bring our brother to full recovery
[33:37] to God he can be able to step back Lord
[33:40] Jesus and his office of son leading and
[33:42] uh uh ministration in praise father God
[33:46] but Lord and and uh uh we we still
[33:49] praise you this way. Lord God, we say
[33:51] thank you, Father God. And Lord God, as
[33:54] we take this time, Lord Father, to be
[33:56] able to pour our hearts before you, oh
[33:59] God, help us, Lord Jesus. Help us to be
[34:02] able to enter in. Oh God, Father, help
[34:04] us to be able to shut the word behind
[34:07] us, oh God. Oh precious Lord Jesus, help
[34:10] us, Lord, Father God. Oh Lord, just to
[34:14] be able, oh God, Father, to go beyond,
[34:17] Lord, all the things that could be lying

[34:22] God, that could be lying in our
[34:24] imaginations, Lord, help us, oh Father,
[34:27] to rise above it, oh God. Lord Jesus, oh

[34:40] Christ. Oh father, where we can be able
[34:42] to come together Lord God and unite our
[34:45] faith Lord Jesus and create an
[34:47] atmosphere Lord Father God. Oh precious
[34:50] Lord Jesus because we believe in your
[34:53] promised word. You said oh God father
[34:56] Lord you inhabit the praises of your
[34:58] people. You said Lord Jesus unto you the
[35:01] gathering of your people will be. You
[35:04] said father Lord wherever two or three
[35:06] are gather Lord God. And tonight we are
[35:09] more than that Lord Jesus. But Father
[35:12] God we pray Lord God beyond all of that
[35:15] Lord Jesus. We want to enter in with you
[35:17] oh God. We want to enter in with you
[35:20] Father. We want to be shouting with you
[35:22] Lord God. And let the word be shout out
[35:25] for the moment Lord. Oh God. Father.
[35:28] Lord Jesus. All the things we have to go

[35:33] everything. Lord God, we can just shout
[35:35] it out and just get in with you,
[35:37] precious Lord. Learn to appreciate you,

[35:44] God." Say, "Sather, thank you, Lord God,

[46:32] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians.
[46:36] That will be it for singing tonight. We
[46:39] will just uh take a little portion of
[46:42] the word here.
[46:45] Praise the Lord.
[46:48] Amen.
[47:31] Praise the Lord.
[47:34] Amen. Actually, I was looking in uh um
[47:39] Jesus prayer in uh Matthew uh m uh St.
[47:43] John chapter 17. That's not what I was
[47:46] what I want to go into tonight. But as
[47:48] we were singing the song, blessed be the
[47:50] name of the Lord, I was just thinking
[47:52] about that. You know, Jesus said, I I've
[47:55] manifest thy name unto the man which
[47:57] thou have given me out of the word.
[48:02] Thine they were, and thou gave them me,
[48:07] and they have kept thy word. And you see
[48:11] over and over in St. John chapter 19, he
[48:14] associate the name of the Lord with the
[48:16] word of God. Amen. Amen. That's what I
[48:19] was thinking about while we were singing
[48:20] that song. Blessed be the name of the
[48:22] Lord. Amen. The name of the Lord is a
[48:25] strong tower is when we run to the
[48:27] promised word. Amen. Amen.
[48:31] So that's what I was thinking about.
[48:34] That's why you saw me flipping because
[48:36] uh I was I was it was on my mind and I
[48:38] was trying to look for the verse there.
[48:41] Uh we stay in St. John Matthew chapter
[48:44] 5. But before we read Matthew chapter 5,
[48:48] uh let's go to Romans chapter 10.
[48:52] We will open with Romans chapter 10
[48:54] tonight and and then we go back to
[48:56] Matthew chapter 5 and and be able to
[48:58] close that chapter tonight.
[49:04] Praise the Lord. We've been speaking on
[49:07] the lawgiver
[49:09] and uh Romans chapter 10.
[49:13] You want to read Romans chapter 10.
[49:26] Praise the Lord. I hope uh it's been a
[49:28] blessing to you talking about the the
[49:30] Lord gave her and uh that we can be able
[49:34] to see clearly the very one that gave
[49:36] the Lord over to Moses. He's the same
[49:40] one that came right down here. uh uh and
[49:43] then uh there man Mount Olive with were
[49:46] the disciples and then he's he's
[49:48] breaking the law. He's manifesting the
[49:49] law. Now Romans chapter 10, let's read
[49:53] from verse 4. Romans chapter 10, we will
[49:56] read from verse four and I want us to
[49:59] just to just uh uh
[50:03] just read it uh uh together and uh uh oh
[50:10] just like we normally do. Uh let me read
[50:12] verse four and then you read verse five
[50:14] and we will read the last verse
[50:15] together. For Christ is the end of the
[50:18] Lord for righteousness to everyone
[50:23] that believeth.
[50:33] But the righteousness
[50:35] which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
[50:39] say not in the heart, who shall ascend
[50:43] into heaven? That is to bring Christ
[50:46] down from above.
[50:52] That is to bring Christ
[50:54] from the dead. But what sareth it? The
[50:59] word is nigh thee,
[51:02] even in thy mouth, and in thy heart.
[51:09] That is the word of faith which we
[51:13] preach. And let's read verse.
[51:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's read verse
[51:29] nine together.
[51:32] Thou shall confess with her mouth the
[51:34] Lord Jesus and shall believe in thy
[51:37] heart that God has raised him from the
[51:40] dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the
[51:44] heart man believeth unto righteousness,
[51:48] and with the mouth confession is made
[51:51] unto salvation. Let's pray. Father, we
[51:54] just love you tonight, Lord. And uh we
[51:59] we don't want to be
[52:01] estranged to your word. We want to enjoy
[52:05] your word. We want to
[52:08] fellowship around your word, Lord. And
[52:11] oh God, we just uh want to thank you
[52:15] that Father, you have allow us to be a
[52:19] partaker of the open book. We want to
[52:22] thank you father that Lord God you
[52:26] ordained us to be in this generation
[52:29] in this time Lord Father God when u the
[52:33] seals were open the mysteries that were
[52:36] hid from the foundations of the word and
[52:39] oh God this uh book has become a new
[52:43] book
[52:44] why because you have stepped out of the
[52:47] pages to make yourself known to your
[52:50] children.
[52:52] Father, we love you. We appreciate you.
[52:55] We ask, oh God, your special blessing
[52:58] tonight that you would just bless us in
[53:00] your presence now. And those that are
[53:03] following the service online, we ask
[53:05] that you bless them too. What a
[53:07] wonderful Jesus you are. In Jesus name
[53:10] we pray. Amen.
[53:12] Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[53:14] your seat.
[53:18] Praise the Lord.
[53:22] Praise the Lord. Amen. You love the Lord
[53:26] tonight.
[53:29] Amen. Amen. What a wonderful Jesus we
[53:32] serve. Like I said, I hope that uh
[53:35] speaking on the Lord gave uh has been a
[53:38] blessing to you.
[53:41] If not this time, uh if you are uh might
[53:45] be a blessing to you another time.
[53:47] Praise the Lord.
[53:50] Amen.
[53:54] Amen.
[53:57] I was looking at some few things today
[54:00] and uh I want to get back to uh Matthew
[54:04] chapter 5 like I said and uh and and uh
[54:08] just try to finish the chapter. We we've
[54:11] been dragging on it uh for a while,
[54:15] but uh I want to get there in and uh
[54:20] let's see if we can finish the chapter
[54:22] tonight.
[54:25] Praise the Lord.
[54:28] But before we do that,
[54:37] I want to read Hebrew chapter 10 verse
[54:40] one. We will get to Matthew, but let's
[54:43] read Hebrew Hebrew chapter 10
[54:47] verse one.
[54:49] For the Lord having a shadow of good
[54:51] things to come,
[54:54] and not the very image
[54:57] of the things,
[55:00] the Lord having a shadow of good things
[55:04] to come, but not the very image
[55:10] of the things
[55:13] can never with those sacrifices which
[55:16] they offer year by year continuously.
[55:20] Make the cumber there onto perfect. The
[55:25] Lord only had a shadow
[55:30] and the shadow is a reflection of an
[55:33] object or a being. Praise the Lord. So
[55:37] the Lord had a shadow of good things to
[55:40] come,
[55:41] not the very image.
[55:45] So you see that's the reason why when we
[55:48] when we when we approach God in the
[55:51] legalistic sense you are just grabbing
[55:54] the wind because you can't catch a
[55:56] shadow.
[55:59] You are just grabbing the wind or you
[56:01] just beating against the wind and pretty
[56:04] soon you'll get tired.
[56:07] you are just working yourself up and
[56:09] pretty soon you will get tired because
[56:12] the shadow is not the real image is not
[56:16] the real object. So the Lord was just a
[56:19] shadow and that's what Paul's saying
[56:22] here and that's the reason why uh the
[56:26] worshippers the comer year after year
[56:34] they could never be perfect.
[56:38] They could never be perfect. They could
[56:41] never rise above
[56:43] their uh their uh their sin or their
[56:47] whatever they were doing. And uh uh they
[56:50] went with the guilt uh believing that
[56:54] you know they brought the right
[56:55] sacrifice and uh you know and and animal
[56:58] was killed but they just could not rise
[57:00] above that. They go back with the same
[57:03] vestation, you know. Uh uh
[57:12] so I read that again. The Lord for the
[57:16] Lord having a shadow of good things to
[57:17] come and not the very image of the
[57:20] things can never with those sacrifices
[57:24] which they offer year by year
[57:27] continuously make the comer there onto
[57:30] Pet. For then who they not have ceased
[57:35] to be offered because the worshipper
[57:38] once porch
[57:40] should have no more conscious of sin.
[57:44] Now I I I was I was meditating on this
[57:48] verse the whole day and where my mind
[57:50] was is that when when do the worshipper
[57:54] wants porch? When when in his journey
[57:58] do he wants porch?
[58:03] Praise the Lord.
[58:07] Amen.
[58:09] When in the worshipper journey do he
[58:11] once p when do he gets to that place
[58:14] where he he push out all his desire? You
[58:19] know like like uh uh uh the apostle said
[58:23] he had no more conscious of sin, no more
[58:26] desire.
[58:29] When do that happen in our walk?
[58:34] Praise the Lord. I pray that the Lord
[58:37] will will u he will he will help us.
[58:40] Amen. Let's go to Matthew chapter 5. I'm
[58:44] praying that uh uh we will be able to to
[58:48] get back to that. Uh Matthew chapter 5
[58:53] and uh let's read from verse 43.
[58:59] Matthew chapter 5.
[59:04] Praise the Lord.
[59:29] Matthew chapter 5.
[59:31] I'm uh
[59:39] Matthew chapter 5. Let's read from verse
[59:42] 43.
[59:43] Uh just finding a place to kind of a
[59:46] close out of the the the chapter here.
[59:50] Ye have heard
[59:52] that it have been said, thou shalt love
[59:56] thy neighbor
[59:58] and hate thine enemy.
[1:00:02] But I say unto you, love your enemy,
[1:00:07] bless them that curse you, do good to
[1:00:12] them that hate you, and pray for them
[1:00:16] which despully use you and persecute
[1:00:19] you, that ye may be the children of your
[1:00:25] father, which is in heaven. Now, uh uh
[1:00:29] follow this. Now follow this because
[1:00:32] this could also sound like a
[1:00:35] commandment. It could also sound like a
[1:00:37] requirement.
[1:00:40] Love your enemy. Bless them that curse
[1:00:42] you. Do good to them that hate you. Pray
[1:00:45] for them that despisefully use you and
[1:00:48] persecute you that ye may be. So does
[1:00:52] that means that if you do that then you
[1:00:55] become
[1:00:58] are we together now? So just follow that
[1:01:01] keep that in the back part of your mind
[1:01:04] because that's not what he's saying
[1:01:07] that yeah may be the children of your
[1:01:09] father which is in heaven. For he maketh
[1:01:13] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:01:16] good and send it rain on the just and
[1:01:20] the unjust. For if ye love them, we
[1:01:23] shall love you, what reward have ye?
[1:01:28] Do not the publicans the same?
[1:01:32] And if ye salute your brethrens only,
[1:01:36] what do ye more than the others? Do not
[1:01:39] even the publican soul.
[1:01:42] Be ye therefore perfect.
[1:01:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:48] Does that sounds like a requirement?
[1:01:52] You see, does that sounds like a
[1:01:54] commandment? Does that sound like uh ex
[1:01:56] Exodus chapter 20? Be ye perfect
[1:02:02] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:02:06] is perfect.
[1:02:08] Now think about it this way. Why if it
[1:02:12] was written, "Ye be perfect."
[1:02:18] Well, it also sounds like a like a
[1:02:20] requirement.
[1:02:25] It sounds more like he's telling you
[1:02:27] what he want you to be.
[1:02:31] Are we together? Amen. Now, be ye
[1:02:36] therefore perfect, even as your father
[1:02:40] which is in heaven is perfect. That's
[1:02:42] what we want to talk on tonight. Be ye
[1:02:44] therefore perfect.
[1:02:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:48] Amen. That's what we want to speak about
[1:02:51] tonight. Be ye therefore perfect.
[1:02:56] Hallelujah.
[1:03:13] So we want to
[1:03:17] uh
[1:03:26] We want to start uh by taking this
[1:03:29] tonight and and uh uh do a little bit of
[1:03:32] a review here.
[1:03:36] And I uh I was just
[1:03:41] trying to look at something here.
[1:03:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:04] Okay.
[1:04:14] I want to read something to you that's
[1:04:16] uh that's that's what I'm I kind of
[1:04:19] looking into.
[1:04:21] Um
[1:04:43] Okay.
[1:04:46] What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:05:08] Well, I think there's uh
[1:05:13] Okay, that's not in my notes. So, let me
[1:05:15] read this to you. Uh I think uh it's not
[1:05:20] it's not in my notes back there. So, I
[1:05:23] don't know why I didn't put it there,
[1:05:24] but that's what I was looking for. Now,
[1:05:27] now uh listen to this as we start up
[1:05:31] here. Uh this is from uh a question and
[1:05:33] answer on Lord having the shadow.
[1:05:39] Now the Lord having the shadow of good
[1:05:41] things to come can never make the come
[1:05:44] of perfect.
[1:05:46] Now the Bible says then if that if the
[1:05:51] Lord could if the Lord could not make
[1:05:54] perfect then the Bible speaks that there
[1:06:01] There can be a perfection. Do you
[1:06:03] believe there is a perfection? Now he
[1:06:06] says, "Turn to Matthew chapter 5 and uh
[1:06:10] verse 48 that we just read. Be ye
[1:06:13] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:06:17] which is in heaven is perfect." How you
[1:06:20] going to do that? How are we going to do
[1:06:24] that? Praise the Lord.
[1:06:29] Be ye perfect as your father.
[1:06:32] And those sacrifices
[1:06:35] under the Lord could not make the comer
[1:06:38] perfect. Why? Watch a little while. For
[1:06:42] then who not they they have not ceased.
[1:06:47] And if they made the comer perfect, then
[1:06:49] they will they would not have ceased.
[1:06:53] They will have kept the Lord.
[1:06:59] Because the worshipper, he goes back to
[1:07:02] what we read because the worshipper
[1:07:03] wants parch and have no conscious.
[1:07:07] What's happening to you out there then
[1:07:12] now? So, uh uh okay, I wanted to start
[1:07:17] with this as as as we look into this
[1:07:19] tonight. Be perfect as a heavenly father
[1:07:23] in heaven is perfect. But think about it
[1:07:26] like I said,
[1:07:28] why if the the translator will have
[1:07:32] written it as
[1:07:35] be perfect or ye be perfect,
[1:07:40] yay, be therefore perfect
[1:07:43] as your father in heaven is perfect.
[1:07:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:49] Now, when you look over in the in the in
[1:07:52] the Old Testament, let's uh uh
[1:07:58] go in the old Old Testament a little
[1:08:00] bit.
[1:08:04] You will see there
[1:08:06] uh even as uh
[1:08:10] we read in Exodus chapter 19 where God
[1:08:12] told the children of Israel, "And ye
[1:08:15] shall be unto me uh a kingdom of
[1:08:18] priests, a holy nation."
[1:08:24] And uh uh and and and over and over he
[1:08:26] says this to the people.
[1:08:30] He tells them
[1:08:33] when we look over in uh in Deuteronomy.
[1:08:43] Trying to get settled in my thoughts
[1:08:45] here.
[1:09:04] If you look at Deuteronomy chapter 26
[1:09:07] verse 19,
[1:09:16] Moses telling the children of Israel
[1:09:36] Let's read from verse 16. This day the
[1:09:39] Lord thy God has commanded thee to do
[1:09:42] these statutes in judgment.
[1:09:45] Thou shalt therefore keep and do them
[1:09:48] with all thine heart
[1:09:50] and all and with all thy soul. Thou has
[1:09:56] uh advised the Lord this day to be thy
[1:10:00] God and to walk in his ways and to keep
[1:10:02] his statute, his commandment, his
[1:10:04] judgment, and to yaking unto his voice.
[1:10:07] And the Lord have uh avoided thee this
[1:10:11] day to be a peculiar people, as he have
[1:10:16] promised thee, and and and that thou
[1:10:19] should keep all his commandments, and to
[1:10:22] make thee hide above all nation, which
[1:10:27] he hath made, in praise, in name, in
[1:10:30] honor, and that thou may be an holy
[1:10:35] people unto the Lord thy God as he have
[1:10:39] spoken,
[1:10:40] not as what you have been doing, but
[1:10:44] because he said it.
[1:10:48] Are we together? Amen. Now, so the
[1:10:50] picture I'm trying to bring to us
[1:10:52] tonight is that the even from the Old
[1:10:55] Testament, we realize that God gave the
[1:10:58] people the commandments when they said
[1:11:00] all that the Lord said we would do and
[1:11:03] uh and and and and they have never been
[1:11:05] able to keep the commandment. They
[1:11:06] rebelled against Moses. They rebelled
[1:11:08] against God. And and we know through
[1:11:11] their joining and all the things that
[1:11:12] was happening, all the abominations that
[1:11:15] were happening in their camp. But yet
[1:11:18] yet the prophet Moses after traveling
[1:11:21] with the people,
[1:11:23] are we together? After traveling with
[1:11:26] the people, now he's coming getting
[1:11:28] closer to the end of his journey. He has
[1:11:31] he has in in in traveling with the
[1:11:33] people and seeing how God has been
[1:11:36] dealing with him and God has been
[1:11:38] dealing with the people. He has now
[1:11:40] understood that uh well we never grabbed
[1:11:43] this thing from the beginning. From the
[1:11:45] beginning we taught that it was a
[1:11:46] commandment but now I'm realizing here
[1:11:50] that uh this is God's thought concerning
[1:11:52] us.
[1:11:55] This is his thought. This is the his
[1:11:57] desire.
[1:11:59] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:02] He has loved us with an everlasting
[1:12:06] love. Praise the Lord. Amen. He has draw
[1:12:10] us to himself.
[1:12:12] He came down and met me in a burning
[1:12:15] bush at the backside of the desert with
[1:12:17] with no effort of mind. He gave me two
[1:12:21] supernatural sign to go right back to
[1:12:25] the same Egypt where I ran away from.
[1:12:29] Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:12:33] Now, because Moses himself had to grow
[1:12:36] in this understanding.
[1:12:39] Are we together? Amen. As the Lord is
[1:12:43] dealing with him, as he's dealing with
[1:12:45] the people, he's also growing in
[1:12:48] understanding.
[1:12:50] That God
[1:12:52] saying, "You will be a peculiar people
[1:12:54] unto me. It was not from your works. It
[1:12:58] was because he said it. And the God that
[1:13:01] said it is able to bring it to pass.
[1:13:05] When God says you will be a holy nation,
[1:13:08] he was not looking at you to manufacture
[1:13:11] holiness.
[1:13:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. He was going to
[1:13:16] make sure that what he said, I want you
[1:13:18] to be a peculiar people unto me. Amen. I
[1:13:22] want you to be a holy nation unto me.
[1:13:26] That very God that is that said that
[1:13:28] he's more than able to bring it to pass.
[1:13:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:38] So if he says that uh uh uh uh repent
[1:13:41] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:13:43] Jesus, you shall receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:46] he's not looking at your your works.
[1:13:48] He's looking at his promise because he
[1:13:50] said it. He's able to bring it to pass.
[1:13:54] If he says you will be adopted, he's
[1:13:57] able to bring it to pass. If he says we
[1:14:00] will be raptured, he's able to bring it
[1:14:03] to pass.
[1:14:05] Amen. Are we together? Let's look at
[1:14:08] something in that light a little bit.
[1:14:10] Okay. I was struggling here a little
[1:14:12] bit, but I think I've I've got my
[1:14:14] balance now. The Lord. Amen. Look at
[1:14:17] this uh from the message perfection. I
[1:14:20] have that one there. So uh they can
[1:14:22] share it with us. He says uh
[1:14:26] you see God's sovereignty. Oh, I hope
[1:14:30] they soak well down way down deep. Now
[1:14:35] look, God knows
[1:14:37] he has sheep in the word. He knows he
[1:14:42] was going to have people to be safe. Are
[1:14:46] we together? Amen. Amen. And he and and
[1:14:50] and uh his love looked down and seen
[1:14:55] those who will be saved. Therefore, by
[1:14:58] full knowledge, he predestinated a
[1:15:01] church to meet him yonder.
[1:15:05] So he predestinated a church that would
[1:15:08] meet him. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:15:12] Lord. Glory. Amen. He predestinated a
[1:15:16] church that will meet him. Amen. Are we
[1:15:18] together?
[1:15:20] Let's let's follow this a little bit
[1:15:22] now.
[1:15:26] That would meet him without spot or
[1:15:29] wrinkle. And if God require a church
[1:15:32] without spot or wrinkle, he had to have
[1:15:36] something
[1:15:38] to make it that way. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:42] He said he will present himself.
[1:15:46] Praise the Lord. Amen. He said he will
[1:15:49] present himself a bride, a church
[1:15:54] without spot or wrinkle. So if he said
[1:15:58] that,
[1:15:59] he has everything it takes. Amen. To
[1:16:03] bring us to that place. Amen. So if he
[1:16:06] says be ye perfect as your heavenly
[1:16:09] father in heaven, he's not telling you
[1:16:12] that you know be walking and counting
[1:16:15] your steps. No. What he want you to do
[1:16:19] is to appreciate. Amen. Is to
[1:16:22] appreciate. Fall in love that if he said
[1:16:25] it, he's more than able to keep it.
[1:16:32] Are we together? Amen. Oh, I love that
[1:16:34] tonight. Amen. If God required a church
[1:16:37] without spot to wrinkle, he had to have
[1:16:40] something to make it that to make that
[1:16:43] way. He could not require it. His
[1:16:46] justice, his judgment could not let him
[1:16:49] ask such a thing if there wasn't a way
[1:16:54] to make it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:03] He will not ask for what
[1:17:08] he can get.
[1:17:11] Amen. Just like in the beginning when he
[1:17:14] said let there be light.
[1:17:17] He was not thinking whether it whether
[1:17:20] the light will be or not. He knew it
[1:17:22] will be.
[1:17:26] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:29] The word was spoken and he knew that it
[1:17:32] is going to be just like he said it.
[1:17:36] A man cannot do it in himself.
[1:17:40] He's a total failure. God let him see
[1:17:44] through the law.
[1:17:46] Do you see the picture?
[1:17:48] All that the Lord said we would do.
[1:17:50] Okay. God allowed them to see through
[1:17:53] the law that they are a failure. I'm not
[1:17:55] I'm not asking you.
[1:17:58] I'm telling you I raised you up for this
[1:18:01] purpose. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:06] I'm telling you that I have raised you
[1:18:08] up
[1:18:10] to be a people in this generation. Let
[1:18:13] the generation go crazy. Let the
[1:18:16] generation go filthy.
[1:18:19] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let
[1:18:22] the generation I mean uh h let the
[1:18:26] internet step up against amen. Amen.
[1:18:30] Amen. A prophet told us the lead is
[1:18:32] taken out of hell and demon spirits are
[1:18:35] streaming into the earth. But yet God
[1:18:37] has a people. Because God said he will
[1:18:41] have a people.
[1:18:44] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, what a
[1:18:48] mighty God we serve.
[1:18:51] Amen. We can we can rest in his word.
[1:18:54] What a mighty God we serve.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:58] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:02] We might look around us and it looks
[1:19:04] like oh everything is getting bad and
[1:19:07] everything is getting dark and
[1:19:08] everything but look at the promise.
[1:19:10] Hallelujah. You see that's the reason
[1:19:12] why Joshua and Caleb they were not
[1:19:15] looking for giants because giants were
[1:19:17] not in the promise. They were looking
[1:19:19] for a land that was flowing with milk
[1:19:21] and honey.
[1:19:23] They knew giants were there, but giants
[1:19:26] was not in the promise. God never
[1:19:28] recorded giants to them. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:32] Amen.
[1:19:34] Amen.
[1:19:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:41] God is never without a witness.
[1:19:44] He always have a people. Yes. Praise the
[1:19:47] Lord. Amen. He always have a people.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:54] Are we together? Amen.

[1:20:13] everybody running and there
[1:20:20] there was uh mef. Yeah. His
[1:20:26] nurse was trying to run with him also.
[1:20:28] He fell down, broke his legs,

[1:20:34] When David came to the throne, and he
[1:20:37] wanted to remember his friendship with
[1:20:39] Jonathan,
[1:20:41] he started looking around. Is there any
[1:20:44] song of Saul?
[1:20:49] Glory. Someone said there was one. Yeah.
[1:20:52] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:55] He's lame, but he's a son of salt.
[1:21:00] Are we together?
[1:21:02] Oh, glory. Amen. Amen. You know what I'm
[1:21:06] saying this uh uh people is because if
[1:21:09] we don't trust this word,
[1:21:12] you will fail and fail and fail. Yes.
[1:21:16] And yet you will not fail.
[1:21:20] Amen.
[1:21:22] Amen. You will fail. You will fail. You
[1:21:25] will fail. And yet you will not fail.
[1:21:27] Because at the end of the day, the world
[1:21:29] will pick you up.
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:33] You will fail in yourself. You will fail
[1:21:36] in your effort. And God will bring you
[1:21:38] around the block. No matter how many
[1:21:40] times he ought to bring you around the
[1:21:42] block.
[1:21:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:50] Amen.
[1:21:53] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:21:58] Let's go to Hebrew chapter 6.

[1:22:42] And when God met him on the road of
[1:22:45] Damascus and God started to deal with
[1:22:47] him,
[1:22:49] when he got back there at the uh uh the
[1:22:51] desert of Arabia
[1:22:53] and and and God started to open the word
[1:22:56] to him,
[1:22:58] he started to see Jesus in everything
[1:23:02] in everything in the Old Testament.
[1:23:07] He started to see how everything
[1:23:09] represent God. There there's something I
[1:23:13] I'd like to share to share with you on
[1:23:15] Sunday. Uh it was it was very beautiful.

[1:23:58] taking what the prophecy as a command is
[1:24:01] as if to say you don't do it. I mean,
[1:24:04] fire is going to fall from heaven and
[1:24:06] consume you. But you are taking that
[1:24:08] word and is revealing Christ to you.
[1:24:10] Amen.
[1:24:12] Are we together?
[1:24:15] You're not just only hearing the word or
[1:24:18] loving the word just for a mental
[1:24:21] conception,
[1:24:22] but it's dropping down in your heart.
[1:24:25] Amen. And you falling in love with
[1:24:27] Jesus. See what the what uh uh the
[1:24:30] apostle said here.
[1:24:33] He says verse uh 1 chapter 6, therefore
[1:24:37] leaving the principle of the doctrine of
[1:24:41] Christ. Yeah.
[1:24:43] Let us go unto perfection.
[1:24:48] Amen.
[1:24:50] We can understand the godhead. We can

[1:24:56] you know. Uh h and and I mean we can
[1:24:59] understand, you know, the the the
[1:25:01] serpent seed. We can understand the the
[1:25:04] church order. I mean, and we can get all
[1:25:05] of these things right. The the
[1:25:07] manifestation of gifts in the church. Uh

[1:25:13] that.
[1:25:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. And you see that is
[1:25:22] the first thing. Take take for the
[1:25:23] example here when uh when la eer went
[1:25:27] and got Rebecca.
[1:25:31] Rebecca wanted to know
[1:25:34] about Isaac.
[1:25:38] She wanted to know his height.
[1:25:43] Whether she's marrying a man that she
[1:25:45] started.
[1:25:48] Do you know his weight?
[1:25:57] I mean you you I mean you you you said
[1:26:00] you were in the house when he was born.
[1:26:01] You know his favorite diet
[1:26:05] and she she was she was knowing all of
[1:26:07] these things about Isaac.
[1:26:11] But when the cherub came up the hill
[1:26:13] right amen. And she saw Isaac in the
[1:26:17] field. Amen. She left all of those thing
[1:26:20] behind.
[1:26:22] Ah
[1:26:24] leaving behind the doctrine. Amen. The
[1:26:28] principle.

[1:26:45] step out of there. Yes. Amen.
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:49] She got more interested in the pressing
[1:26:52] of Isaac
[1:26:55] than everything she had heard about him.
[1:27:00] Are we together? Amen.
[1:27:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:08] Now, so uh uh uh uh Paul says here now
[1:27:13] therefore because you have to look back
[1:27:15] in in chapter 5, he's talking about the
[1:27:17] priesthood. He's talking about uh uh you
[1:27:20] know the the uh uh uh the high priest,
[1:27:25] the the mechetic order and all of that.
[1:27:27] He's talking about I don't want to go
[1:27:29] into that. Let's stay here before I lose
[1:27:32] my my trench. He says uh therefore
[1:27:36] living the principle of the doctrine of
[1:27:38] Christ let's go unto perfection.
[1:27:42] Amen. Amen. Let's go to the perfect one.
[1:27:51] You see when we when when we when we
[1:27:54] when we think about it this way,
[1:27:57] we must think about the one the person.
[1:28:03] Let's go on to perfection
[1:28:05] is not let practice to be perfect. Let
[1:28:08] try to be perfect. Let's stop all of
[1:28:10] this argument. Let's let's live the
[1:28:12] word.
[1:28:16] Are we together? Amen. Are you seeing
[1:28:18] the picture? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:23] Let's go on to perfection. Not laying
[1:28:25] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:28:27] dead works. And then he goes on and on
[1:28:30] and on.
[1:28:33] So you see the thing that is that Jesus
[1:28:39] came stepping out here and he started
[1:28:42] telling these people uh uh uh uh blessed
[1:28:45] is the poor in spirit.
[1:28:48] Blessed is the meek.
[1:28:51] Blessed is the peacemaker.
[1:28:53] And he blessed are those that hunger and
[1:28:55] test for righteousness. He's saying all
[1:28:58] of this all of these things to them. And
[1:29:01] then he goes back again and take the
[1:29:03] Lord. Ye have heard that it was said an
[1:29:06] eye for an eye, you know, a tooth for
[1:29:09] the tooth. But I said unto you, he that
[1:29:11] hit his brother. Now he he was trying.
[1:29:14] This is where he was bringing them. He
[1:29:16] was bringing them to this statement of
[1:29:19] be perfect.
[1:29:24] And he was telling them how we going to
[1:29:26] get there.
[1:29:29] Amen. Amen. I've not come to destroy the
[1:29:32] law, but I've come to fulfill it. And
[1:29:35] the purpose of the Lord was to reveal
[1:29:38] our sinful nature. And that is the
[1:29:41] reason why he started talking about poor
[1:29:44] in spirit is a sense of the spirit. He
[1:29:47] started dealing with things inside
[1:29:49] because we are born in sin, shamelessly
[1:29:52] in iniquity.
[1:29:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:59] As much as we as as as much as we love
[1:30:02] our little ones that that that that
[1:30:05] comes to the earth like an angel, they
[1:30:07] are innocent.
[1:30:09] But right in that body,
[1:30:14] there are James that have come down for
[1:30:16] generation.
[1:30:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:21] Are we together? Amen. Amen. So you see
[1:30:25] that's that's what Jesus that's where he
[1:30:27] was bringing him. He was trying. You
[1:30:29] have heard. But this I say to you
[1:30:33] that the purpose of the Lord was to
[1:30:35] reveal our sinful nature to give us a
[1:30:38] desire. Amen. Amen. To want to be
[1:30:42] changed. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:48] Praise the Lord. Yeah,
[1:30:51] the purpose of the Lord was to reveal
[1:30:53] our sinfulness. So he started goring. He
[1:30:57] is writt adultery. But how do this
[1:31:01] happen? He say it started from lust.
[1:31:03] It's something in you.
[1:31:07] Something inside that stirred up that.
[1:31:11] So he's taking us all the way back to
[1:31:13] the beginning.
[1:31:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:19] that right in uh uh uh uh uh Genesis
[1:31:23] chapter 3 when he stopped to listen to
[1:31:26] the serpent, he break through her spirit
[1:31:29] in her sense of reasoning. There's a
[1:31:31] seed that was sown that corrupt the
[1:31:33] human spirit.
[1:31:36] Amen.
[1:31:41] That's what he that's where he's
[1:31:43] bringing us to. He's trying to tell us
[1:31:45] why why we why we keep struggling.
[1:31:51] There's a desire in us to do good.
[1:31:54] Amen.
[1:31:57] But our our body keep
[1:32:00] reversing to do evil.
[1:32:04] We go on we go on seven day fasting and
[1:32:08] and and I mean we we fast and pray. We
[1:32:10] try to shake our head and we don't want
[1:32:12] to eat any any evil thing and then one
[1:32:15] week it looks like we are on the
[1:32:17] mountain. Praise the Lord. Lord Jesus,
[1:32:18] you are good to me or you are on fire
[1:32:21] for God. And before you realize down in
[1:32:23] the valley, you down in the valley
[1:32:25] again.
[1:32:32] Lord, what wrong with me? What wrong
[1:32:34] with me? Oh my god, what wrong with me?
[1:32:36] All Jesus will report the very same
[1:32:39] apostle one that tried to do good evil.
[1:32:43] That's what he said. Yes sir. He
[1:32:45] recognized that. Yes. So the purpose of
[1:32:49] the Lord
[1:32:51] was to expose the inner man. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:56] Amen. To tell us that we we need help.
[1:33:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. To tell us that
[1:33:05] we need help. Yeah, I think I told you
[1:33:08] told you this story before and uh uh
[1:33:11] about uh uh one young lady that come to
[1:33:14] church here once once in a while. I saw
[1:33:15] her in services on Sunday and uh uh uh
[1:33:19] she she lived somewhere there in in in
[1:33:21] the Freley area. I think it's is maybe
[1:33:23] about 15 20 minutes away from here where
[1:33:25] she lived. And she came one Sunday to
[1:33:28] service and she wanted to see me. And I
[1:33:31] I'm I'm telling you this it brought me
[1:33:35] to a very truth experience. And after
[1:33:38] the service, I went I went in the
[1:33:40] office. I still remember Pastor Martins
[1:33:42] from Nigeria preached for us that
[1:33:44] Sunday. And then I went in the office to
[1:33:46] talk to her and I was supposed to
[1:33:48] baptize someone. I can't remember who
[1:33:50] was there. And uh and then we started
[1:33:53] talking. But this this young lady, I
[1:33:55] mean, she was just crying. She was just
[1:33:57] balling. She was crying. I couldn't get
[1:34:00] a word out of her. So I brought the
[1:34:03] tissue, set it right there. I told her,
[1:34:04] "Take your time. You just take your
[1:34:06] time." And when she want to say
[1:34:08] something, she just she just crying, you
[1:34:10] know. She just crying
[1:34:13] when, you know, when uh when she finally
[1:34:16] got to the place where she could speak
[1:34:19] to me and then she she tell she told me
[1:34:22] that uh I mean uh you know the the Lord
[1:34:25] just been dealing with her. She need to
[1:34:26] make her life right. She need to get to
[1:34:28] church and and some different things
[1:34:30] that she told me.
[1:34:33] And uh
[1:34:35] uh
[1:34:38] and then after we talked a little bit, I
[1:34:40] asked her where she live. I I thought
[1:34:42] she live around here. She said, "No, I
[1:34:44] live in I live in the Freley area."
[1:34:48] I said, "Oh, wow." I said, "Who gave you
[1:34:51] our our address?" She said, "When I woke
[1:34:54] up this morning, I felt like I needed to
[1:34:57] be in church. When I took my phone, your
[1:35:00] church was the first address that came
[1:35:02] up. Praise God.
[1:35:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:09] And she said she drove right here. She
[1:35:10] came right into service and uh you know
[1:35:13] and and she she she enjoyed the worship.
[1:35:15] She enjoyed the word and she just felt
[1:35:18] like she needed to talk to me. Now she's
[1:35:20] talking to me, telling me about her
[1:35:23] condition, and she's needing the Lord.
[1:35:26] And as she's talking to me, I'm coming
[1:35:28] under conviction
[1:35:33] because I did not invite her. I didn't
[1:35:35] send her a text. I never sent her an
[1:35:38] address.
[1:35:40] And and and I'm I'm coming on a
[1:35:41] conviction to see that
[1:35:45] God will never become real to you until
[1:35:49] you desire.
[1:35:52] Amen. You will play church.
[1:35:56] You will come to church, go through the
[1:35:58] door, come out until you desire, until
[1:36:01] that thing become real, until you need
[1:36:04] him.
[1:36:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:11] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:15] I remember the man, Brother Bam, talking
[1:36:17] about that everybody been trying to get
[1:36:19] him to church. you he never want to go
[1:36:20] to church
[1:36:22] until one day the the pastor called him
[1:36:24] up for him for them to go in fishing and
[1:36:27] they went to fishing and this guy was
[1:36:29] not much of a fisherman
[1:36:31] but that day he got a good catch
[1:36:36] and as they were walking back home he
[1:36:38] told the the he told the pastor and says
[1:36:41] I'll be in church on Sunday the pastor
[1:36:44] was shocked and wanting to know
[1:36:47] what did I
[1:36:53] What did I say? Sometimes sometimes you
[1:36:55] think it's the preacher. No. The word.
[1:36:59] It is the word. Hebrews 4:12. The word
[1:37:03] is sharper than any two-edged sword.
[1:37:06] Amen. Amen. The person of the word, he
[1:37:09] just need to step out of the Bible.
[1:37:11] Amen. Walk down the aisle. He knows what
[1:37:14] you're thinking. He knows what you need.
[1:37:16] He knows what your struggle is. Amen.
[1:37:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. Then he asked the
[1:37:24] man and uh I mean uh uh is it because I
[1:37:29] was talking about baptism? Man said no.
[1:37:33] And the man told him he says he says the
[1:37:37] good Lord might have been looking down
[1:37:39] on me today.
[1:37:43] He feared the love of God by the grace
[1:37:47] of catching fish when he was not a good
[1:37:49] fisherman.
[1:37:51] He fear that God if if God will pay
[1:37:53] attention to him. Amen. Give him
[1:37:56] patience to sit down there and give him
[1:37:58] fish to catch. Hallelujah. Then he
[1:38:00] realized, Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:05] Amen.
[1:38:07] Are we together? Amen.
[1:38:12] Be ye perfect.
[1:38:14] Be ye therefore perfect.
[1:38:18] It's not a commandment.
[1:38:21] It's not a commandment. He's telling you
[1:38:24] what his thoughts concerning you is.
[1:38:27] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:31] Be ye holy as God is holy.
[1:38:35] How can we be? It's not a competition.
[1:38:38] We're not running race with him.
[1:38:40] It's just a sense of uh he's trying to
[1:38:43] get our attention.
[1:38:45] Trying to get our attention to realize
[1:38:47] that our father is a holy God. Amen. The
[1:38:53] one from whom we come from is a holy
[1:38:56] God.
[1:38:58] He's not a God that condemn in sin.
[1:39:02] He's not a God that love
[1:39:04] unrighteousness.
[1:39:07] That's where you came from. It's it's
[1:39:10] it's just like a man sitting down and
[1:39:12] setting the ball down and trying to tell
[1:39:14] him, "Look, I know your dad. I know the
[1:39:17] family you are coming from.
[1:39:22] They are people of reputation. Your
[1:39:23] father and myself went to school. We
[1:39:25] grew up together. That man suffer
[1:39:29] said you are misrepresenting him.
[1:39:37] That's what the Lord was bringing to us.
[1:39:41] You are coming from the fountain of
[1:39:43] love. You are coming from a pure
[1:39:46] fountain. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:52] Sin has make us to miss our way.
[1:39:56] It has robbed us of our identity. Yes.
[1:39:59] Oh yes.
[1:40:01] And then God comes back and says, "I
[1:40:03] want you to be a holy nation. I want you
[1:40:06] to be a peculiar people to me." Amen.
[1:40:11] Because the people were abused with
[1:40:13] slavery. It's the same way we are born
[1:40:17] in the in in in sin slavery.
[1:40:20] We had lived in it. We lie, we cheat, we
[1:40:23] do all of this. So because of that we we
[1:40:26] we we are haunted in our mind we are in
[1:40:30] that mindset
[1:40:32] that every time we hear the word of God
[1:40:34] we think that
[1:40:38] God is requiring no he's just coming to
[1:40:40] remind us like that mama eagle flying
[1:40:43] and and she's crying and she's crying.
[1:40:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:48] And when the the the the little eaglet
[1:40:51] Yeah. The mama cry. She looks up. She
[1:40:54] look in the in the in the chicken pan.
[1:40:58] And then she looks up. She look in the
[1:41:00] chicken pan.
[1:41:03] Pretty soon she start connecting. There
[1:41:05] is something different here. I'm
[1:41:07] connected to that voice. But this is my
[1:41:10] family.
[1:41:11] No way. Oh, I see what I'm strange.
[1:41:15] I'm connected to that voice. Amen. Thank
[1:41:18] you, Lord. The more she keep hearing
[1:41:20] mama eagle crying. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:41:23] more she having more desire to fly
[1:41:27] because she don't even know how to
[1:41:28] stretch. Well, the more she keep hearing
[1:41:31] mama eagle flying, the desire continue
[1:41:34] to create and build in her to get away
[1:41:37] from here. My sheep hear my voice.
[1:41:41] And we are watched by the watching of
[1:41:44] the word. The more you hear the word,
[1:41:47] the more it gives you desire to get out
[1:41:49] of wrong, to get out of sin, to confess
[1:41:52] your thought, to become better.
[1:41:55] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:59] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Paul
[1:42:03] says
[1:42:04] Christ is the end of the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:09] Amen. He says it's the end of the Lord.
[1:42:12] He abolished the Lord.
[1:42:15] The abolishing of the law is not to says
[1:42:19] the law, we don't believe in the law,
[1:42:21] the ten commandment does not exist. No,
[1:42:23] the abolishing of the law happy in a
[1:42:26] believer.
[1:42:30] Amen. He don't abolish the law to say
[1:42:33] the law of Moses get rid of the law of
[1:42:35] Moses. No, no, no, no. He abolished the
[1:42:38] law in their believer. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:42] Amen. Good.
[1:42:45] How does he abolish the Lord?
[1:42:50] By the new birth. The love of God.
[1:42:53] Now you are falling in love with God.
[1:42:55] You are not serving God for for reward.
[1:42:58] Amen. You are loving him. Thank you
[1:43:00] Lord. Thank you Lord. Oh my God. Amen.
[1:43:03] So the Lord is abolish in you.
[1:43:06] Amen.
[1:43:09] You see that's the reason why we can
[1:43:10] still preach from Exod. We can say
[1:43:12] preach from Leviticus. We can say preach
[1:43:14] from numbers because he say I never came
[1:43:17] to to uh uh uh get rid of the Lord. I
[1:43:20] came to fulfill it. Amen. But yet Paul
[1:43:23] says he is the end of the Lord in the
[1:43:26] believer.
[1:43:28] Why? Because when the revelation when
[1:43:31] the righteousness of God is revealed to
[1:43:34] you and you know that it is not your own
[1:43:36] righteousness, I need to trust him. I
[1:43:39] need to believe him. I need to love him.
[1:43:43] Then you know what he says? What is that
[1:43:46] righteousness? It's even in your mouth.
[1:43:49] Say what the word says. If the word says
[1:43:52] I'm free, say I'm free. If the word says
[1:43:54] I'm healed, say I'm healed.
[1:43:59] Amen. Amen. He says that's the
[1:44:02] righteousness that the law supposed to
[1:44:04] produce. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That
[1:44:08] was what the law was supposed to do. It
[1:44:10] expose our wrong but yet it teach us
[1:44:14] what we what we actually was. Amen. It
[1:44:18] gives you the language of the father.
[1:44:20] Yes sir.
[1:44:23] So instead of speaking the earthly
[1:44:26] language and the e thing now starts to
[1:44:28] say what the father says. Say what you
[1:44:31] are learning from the word. That's the
[1:44:33] righteousness of the word. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:37] Amen. The word is even ny in your mouth.
[1:44:41] He says it's in your mouth. Amen. Don't
[1:44:43] make it up. Just say what he says.
[1:44:47] Praise the Lord. Don't make it up. Just
[1:44:51] say what he says. Amen. This is heavenly
[1:44:54] darling.
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:58] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:02] So I say to you tonight, be ye perfect.
[1:45:05] Amen. Yes. Amen. Being perfect as your
[1:45:11] father in heaven is perfect. Be perfect.
[1:45:15] Amen. Do with it whatever you want to.
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:22] Oh, glory. Thank you, Lord. Praise the
[1:45:26] Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] What a wonderful Jesus we serve. Amen.
[1:45:34] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:40] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:42] I'm going to share something with you,
[1:45:45] but I will find time and and talk about
[1:45:48] it another time. You know, I was talking
[1:45:50] last week on the on the
[1:45:54] how powerful our spirit is. We are more
[1:45:58] spirit being than flesh.
[1:46:03] We are put in this flesh to discover who
[1:46:07] you are.
[1:46:10] Who really you are is in you. Amen.
[1:46:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:16] Amen. Who you are is in you.
[1:46:20] You are put in this flesh to be able to
[1:46:23] discover.
[1:46:29] and how we discover who we are. Now look
[1:46:33] at Exodus chapter 3. I'll close right
[1:46:35] here. when when when when God came down
[1:46:38] in a burning bush,
[1:46:42] uh
[1:46:45] Moses
[1:46:51] Moses asked the Lord
[1:46:56] Moses asked the Lord and said, "When I
[1:46:59] go into Egypt
[1:47:02] and the people ask me,
[1:47:04] who should I say send
[1:47:08] What should I tell them? If you read
[1:47:11] closely, God did not answer his
[1:47:13] question.
[1:47:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:27] We have a Bible before us. We must not
[1:47:29] make up the story.
[1:47:32] I know time is not it's not on our side
[1:47:35] but uh
[1:47:41] praise the Lord.
[1:47:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:53] Now, if you if you uh
[1:48:03] when the Lord saw that he turned, that's
[1:48:05] that's over in verse four. Verse six,
[1:48:07] moreover, he said, I am the God of your
[1:48:10] father and the God of Abraham, um the
[1:48:13] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. Moses
[1:48:16] hid his face because his mother had told
[1:48:19] him all those things
[1:48:22] for he was afraid to look upon God.
[1:48:26] He says, "I'm come down.
[1:48:33] I'm calm down." Okay, I got I got the
[1:48:36] picture a little bit I got my my picture
[1:48:39] a little bit out of place. Let me
[1:48:40] readress it here. This is what I wanted
[1:48:42] to bring out.
[1:48:45] Verse 11.
[1:48:47] Verse 11,
[1:48:49] God is telling Moses, "Therefore, I've
[1:48:51] come down.
[1:48:54] I've heard a cry." Verse 9, "Of the
[1:48:56] children of Israel, I've come."
[1:48:59] Verse 10, "Come now, therefore, I will
[1:49:02] send you." Verse 11, "And Moses said
[1:49:05] unto God, who am I?"
[1:49:10] Okay. Trying to look for his identity.
[1:49:12] That's that's what I wanted to say. got
[1:49:14] it wrong. But if you realize God did not
[1:49:17] ask him. God God didn't answer him. God
[1:49:19] never told him you are the son of Amra.
[1:49:23] No, God never told him dead. That's
[1:49:26] that's what I want to bring out. It was
[1:49:27] good that I turned to the Bible or got
[1:49:30] my my story, my picture out of place.
[1:49:33] Who am I that I should go onto Pharaoh
[1:49:36] and I should bring for the children of
[1:49:37] Israel? Now, what was haunting him? Why
[1:49:40] he asked that question? It was his
[1:49:43] failure, right? Because he knew he had
[1:49:46] failed. Because he knew he had just ran
[1:49:48] away.
[1:49:50] If God would have said to him, "Go to
[1:49:53] Kaa." He would have prefer going to Kaa
[1:49:56] because nobody know him to Canaan. He
[1:49:58] have gone to Kaa like a hero.
[1:50:03] But God is telling him, "Go and face
[1:50:05] your failure.
[1:50:09] Go and face your failure.
[1:50:14] Are we together? Sometimes is the things
[1:50:17] that we are afraid of.
[1:50:21] To face our fear. Yeah. But then you
[1:50:24] realize actually there is really nothing
[1:50:26] in there because you already knows about
[1:50:28] that thing. You already been there
[1:50:32] and there is nothing there to be afraid
[1:50:34] of. It's just a scarecrow.
[1:50:37] So God did not answer him
[1:50:40] when he says who am I and then God comes
[1:50:43] down and he says certainly I will be
[1:50:47] with thee. God just answer him, I will
[1:50:48] be with thee and this is a token that
[1:50:50] you will know. And then when you go on
[1:50:55] verse 13, and Moses said unto God,
[1:50:57] behold, I come unto the children if I
[1:51:00] come to the children of Israel. And then
[1:51:01] I asked him, the God of your father have
[1:51:03] sent me. And he said unto me, what is
[1:51:05] his name?
[1:51:10] Praise the Lord. It says, what is his
[1:51:13] name?
[1:51:15] Yeah. Let's let's play on words a little
[1:51:17] bit here.
[1:51:18] Moses says, "Who I am?"
[1:51:22] Amen. Who am I?
[1:51:26] God says, "I am."
[1:51:30] That I am.
[1:51:34] And pretty soon he will find his
