[1:23:21] it's not to say nothing

[1:23:27] happen but we still living in the word
[1:23:29] the word never comes to an end for the
[1:23:31] matter of fact this word does not have
[1:23:33] an
[1:23:34] end it does not have an end it does not
[1:23:37] have a full stop things will keep
[1:23:41] happening things will keep happening and
[1:23:44] one day time will roll into
[1:23:49] enity things will keep happening so
[1:23:52] don't look for a full stop in this word
[1:23:54] the word does not have an end time came
[1:23:57] out of Eternity and one day inity will
[1:24:01] swallow time before there was time
[1:24:04] before there was a beginning there was
[1:24:06] an internal God there was a great
[1:24:09] internal
[1:24:10] Spirit praise the Lord yes sir that
[1:24:13] wanted to show his attributes and the
[1:24:16] only way he can do it is to step out of
[1:24:19] Eternity and begin time
[1:24:23] and one of these days when all of what
[1:24:26] he wanted to do which of course we
[1:24:27] believe we are just at the final end of
[1:24:30] what he's doing he will swallow up time
[1:24:32] back into
[1:24:34] eternity but there is no full stop to
[1:24:37] this
[1:24:38] word praise the Lord the word does not
[1:24:42] have an end dispensation have an end one
[1:24:46] dispensation can end and we move into
[1:24:48] another dispensation Church ages have an
[1:24:51] end praise the Lord amen our life spent
[1:24:56] on this Earth have an
[1:25:03] end but this word does not have an
[1:25:06] end and in saying there we would just
[1:25:09] want to encourage you we are
[1:25:12] entering one of
[1:25:17] uh uh one of the darkest
[1:25:20] time of uh uh of the word we are
[1:25:25] entering one of the darkest
[1:25:27] time science is advancing and everything
[1:25:31] is now moving to
[1:25:33] LED more powerful than brighter light
[1:25:37] but the age is getting
[1:25:41] darker praise the Lord there is lot of
[1:25:44] artificial lights around us that we
[1:25:46] cannot see how dark the age
[1:25:49] is and even with all of these artificial
[1:25:52] life men are
[1:25:54] doing dangerous
[1:25:56] things right in right in right in light
[1:26:00] before then men used to look for
[1:26:03] Darkness to do horrible
[1:26:06] things praise the Lord they tried to
[1:26:09] light in every street corner and put
[1:26:11] camera every word around the world but
[1:26:14] yet evil is happening more than
[1:26:18] ever more than
[1:26:21] ever
[1:26:24] if you ever tune into news feed or if
[1:26:26] you have it on your phone you see all of
[1:26:28] those atrocities that come every day
[1:26:31] killing suicide I mean people uh little
[1:26:34] drum drum over the roof with her
[1:26:36] children dashed them to the floor and
[1:26:38] then kill herself I mean the word is
[1:26:41] just becoming
[1:26:43] horrible it's becoming
[1:26:47] horrible it's all over the
[1:26:51] world
[1:26:52] praise the
[1:26:55] Lord this world is not a safe place to
[1:26:57] live the only safest place we have is in
[1:27:03] Christ but Daniel was speaking on Sunday
[1:27:05] and he was talking about an
[1:27:08] introvert when when and uh uh uh the
[1:27:11] laws and the prophet was until
[1:27:13] John there was a giving space of time
[1:27:17] where when Lord and Grace
[1:27:19] meet the laws from the prophet and the
[1:27:22] coming of Jesus Christ was Grace when
[1:27:25] when when when those two dispensation
[1:27:27] met there was there was there was a kind
[1:27:30] of a introvert a changing over and that
[1:27:34] space was a difficult space we don't
[1:27:37] have much much of a time to talk about
[1:27:40] it but it was just like let me give you
[1:27:42] an example just like the days of Noah
[1:27:45] amen once again when Grace and judgment
[1:27:50] met the Great of God to that age met the
[1:27:55] Judgment of God in the ark of
[1:27:58] Noah and there was an interval of seven
[1:28:02] days a junction of seven days where no
[1:28:07] man could go out of the Ark and no man
[1:28:10] could come in the ark but yet the doors
[1:28:13] were
[1:28:17] open it was an introvert right there but
[1:28:22] it was at that moment where the grace of
[1:28:25] God and judgment
[1:28:28] met and we are living in the very same
[1:28:32] time where Grace is leaving the Earth
[1:28:36] and judgment is sneaky in all of these
[1:28:40] things killing and shooting they are all
[1:28:42] signs of judgment Jesus call it the
[1:28:45] beginning of
[1:28:47] Sorrow that's how he called it the
[1:28:50] beginning of Sorrow
[1:28:56] that's the time we are living in Grace
[1:28:59] is living and the way you can know it is
[1:29:02] that the
[1:29:04] effect of the Gospel is not like it used
[1:29:08] to
[1:29:11] be it's not like it used to
[1:29:15] be let's just go back 10 years
[1:29:18] ago tell the first night people ran to
[1:29:21] church
[1:29:22] even if they never went to church
[1:29:23] through the whole year that New Year
[1:29:27] night they just go to church and and and
[1:29:29] maybe just spend few minutes there just
[1:29:31] to be grateful but it's not like that
[1:29:35] anymore Jesus said Matthew 24 12 because
[1:29:39] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:29:44] will was
[1:29:46] C and the effect is even upon
[1:29:50] believers even upon people with the Holy
[1:29:56] Ghost the arch for praying and
[1:30:00] dedication is not
[1:30:03] there I mean things are just done
[1:30:07] carelessly it's not there because you
[1:30:11] see the thing about the people there is
[1:30:13] that it is not you driving this
[1:30:16] car the Bible says asaiah said it's the
[1:30:20] anointing that breaks the
[1:30:22] yor and when God takes that anointing
[1:30:25] off you will just be like any other
[1:30:29] person the desire of coming to church
[1:30:31] and serving God is Not You It's Grace
[1:30:35] unto
[1:30:37] you when that desire
[1:30:40] leave you will be like any other
[1:30:43] person you will insult the Bible you
[1:30:46] will tear the pages and
[1:30:50] smoke
[1:30:54] so you are
[1:30:58] blessed if there is something that is
[1:31:01] still speaking to your heart to do right
[1:31:04] you are
[1:31:09] blessed that's the age we are living in
[1:31:11] judgment is sneaking because the church
[1:31:14] will not go through the
[1:31:16] tribulation so before the full judgment
[1:31:19] step in the bride will be gone
[1:31:25] that's that is the last greatest event
[1:31:27] the world is waiting for and they don't
[1:31:29] even know what they waiting
[1:31:32] for that is the last biggest even that
[1:31:35] will take place and they will know
[1:31:37] nothing about
[1:31:40] it when the Rapture take place but we
[1:31:44] see that creeping
[1:31:46] in you see that creeping you see men
[1:31:49] that have stood for this message and I
[1:31:52] mean St for
[1:31:55] righteousness it's no longer like
[1:31:59] that people finding excuses to sin they
[1:32:03] keep finding excuses to go far away from
[1:32:10] God when it used to be people would take
[1:32:13] their pillows and they would cry and
[1:32:15] they would CED and said God help me God
[1:32:17] help me it's not there
[1:32:20] again Church is just becoming a fun
[1:32:23] thing people come to dance to the music
[1:32:26] and every other thing especially when it
[1:32:28] comes to the preaching of the word they
[1:32:29] are lacked out they are completely
[1:32:32] lacked
[1:32:35] out say just hurry or let's go home
[1:32:38] you're talking too
[1:32:43] much they completely lack
[1:32:45] out when is the singing the dancing the
[1:32:48] music playing they could be thinking we
[1:32:50] all be worshiping but when it comes to
[1:32:52] the word they just lock out they sit
[1:32:55] right in church and go
[1:32:59] shopping they out there they I mean they
[1:33:01] are just doing everything they hurry up
[1:33:03] looking at time it's time for work and
[1:33:06] and and and everything I mean church is
[1:33:08] just like
[1:33:10] that that's the age we are living in
[1:33:12] it's a sign that Grace is
[1:33:18] living it's a sign that Grace is leing
[1:33:31] are we together I trying I was trying to
[1:33:33] build a scale so I can I can show you
[1:33:36] that of something I'm not a good TR but

[1:33:54] uh uh uh you know we just we just want
[1:33:57] to encourage you
[1:34:00] tonight amen there was something that
[1:34:03] brother Daniel said that was so
[1:34:05] powerful so powerful we were we were
[1:34:08] just fellowshipping on Christmas and we

[1:34:13] know uh how the ministry in this last
[1:34:16] day has Has Lifted us up you know uh the
[1:34:20] experience of behind the curtain of time
[1:34:23] and and you know the prophet of God
[1:34:24] telling that God took a picture of you
[1:34:26] your you know uh uh you never did it in
[1:34:29] the first place in all of that it was it
[1:34:31] was it was God seeing how difficult our
[1:34:36] age is God was trying to make it
[1:34:42] accessible he was trying to make this
[1:34:44] Grace
[1:34:46] accessible he knows there are a lot of
[1:34:48] things that is fighting against us that
[1:34:51] Information Age the internet age those
[1:34:53] are all Spirits from the fourth
[1:34:55] dimension that is that is just battling
[1:34:58] against us so he's trying doing
[1:35:02] everything like like Isaiah says when
[1:35:04] the enemy come as a flaw the spirit of
[1:35:07] the Lord raiseed up a stander he's
[1:35:09] trying to raise us
[1:35:11] up for us for this thing to be
[1:35:15] accessible and it is
[1:35:19] accessible praise the Lord right so we
[1:35:22] want to speak a little bit with a few
[1:35:24] minutes that is before us we want to
[1:35:26] talk about speaking to
[1:35:32] yourself is the thing that we do all the
[1:35:34] time it just that some of the things we
[1:35:37] speak to ourself are wrong things are
[1:35:40] negative things praise the Lord some of
[1:35:44] us we stay speaking the devil's language
[1:35:46] to
[1:35:48] ourselves but we want to tell you speak
[1:35:51] to yourself your
[1:35:52] tonight St Luke chapter
[1:35:55] 7 I want to take this thing that John
[1:35:57] the Baptist said or Jesus said about
[1:36:00] John the Baptist amen are we together
[1:36:04] that's in Luke
[1:36:08] 7:31 Jesus
[1:36:11] said and the Lord said wherefore then
[1:36:14] shall I liking the men of this
[1:36:20] generation
[1:36:21] wherefore shall I like in the men of
[1:36:23] this generation and to what are they
[1:36:28] like they are like unto
[1:36:31] children sitting in the
[1:36:34] marketpl and

[1:36:52] this generation is like children in the
[1:36:56] marketplace praise the
[1:36:59] Lord now so my inspiration is from a
[1:37:01] true life
[1:37:03] story there was a old man that was
[1:37:06] babysitting his uh his
[1:37:11] grandson and uh uh spending time with
[1:37:14] his grandson and he decided to take the
[1:37:16] boy to go
[1:37:19] shopping and then had the boy in the
[1:37:22] cart and he's driving you know talking
[1:37:24] spending time with his
[1:37:26] grandson and and you know children their
[1:37:29] their their their time spent is very
[1:37:33] short amen I mean it can just be two
[1:37:37] minutes they want to do something
[1:37:39] else they want to jump down from the
[1:37:41] cart and start running around and
[1:37:42] scattering everything and he was trying
[1:37:45] to keep his
[1:37:46] grandson and the and and the little boy
[1:37:49] took a faith and started
[1:37:51] crying
[1:37:53] yelling
[1:37:55] crying man I mean he was everybody was
[1:37:57] just looking in that direction praise
[1:38:00] the Lord and he was sticking things from
[1:38:02] the C and just throwing it away and and
[1:38:05] uh and the old man was just people look

[1:40:23] myself because the one that needed to be
[1:40:26] under control was
[1:40:33] myself he said I was talking to
[1:40:36] myself and I believe that's what the
[1:40:39] Apostle Paul is telling us to
[1:40:42] do and I think it's time that we need to
[1:40:45] talk to
[1:40:46] ourself praise the lord we have great
[1:40:48] preachers that have great Mysteries and
[1:40:51] and I mean have great gifts they can be
[1:40:53] able to give to people and not able to
[1:40:55] give
[1:41:00] tosel and I think what we need is to
[1:41:03] talk to
[1:41:08] ourself praise the
[1:41:10] Lord are we together we have to be like
[1:41:13] Jarry
[1:41:15] tonight when all the noise is going
[1:41:17] around and and and uh I mean and the
[1:41:19] devil is blasting our heads and things
[1:41:22] are happening and and I mean and sin is
[1:41:24] appealing all over you need to talk to
[1:41:27] yourself and say I'm a Son of God Son of
[1:41:30] God behave
[1:41:32] yourself Son of God is just a temptation
[1:41:34] is going to pass don't lose
[1:41:38] it young people you need to talk to
[1:41:42] yourself and people are talking about
[1:41:44] you and they are saying this and other
[1:41:46] person said don't go fting just talk to
[1:41:49] yourself because you have a
[1:41:57] responsibility praise the
[1:42:01] Lord speaking to
[1:42:04] yourself what are the things that we
[1:42:06] speak to
[1:42:09] ourself that's the age that we are
[1:42:11] living
[1:42:14] in we need to be preaching to ourself
[1:42:17] singing like like the like like uh uh uh
[1:42:20] uh
[1:42:21] uh the Apostle says
[1:42:23] there singing to yourself Psalms and
[1:42:28] hymns
[1:42:35] amen Psalms hymns and
[1:42:40] Psalms praise the
[1:42:44] Lord that's why we need to be telling
[1:42:46] ourself in another in another form is
[1:42:49] that we need to be bringing the word
[1:42:51] that we hear back to ourself we need to
[1:42:55] be repeating those things that we hear
[1:42:57] from God's word we need to be speaking
[1:43:00] it to ourself because the promise of God
[1:43:03] is not for the
[1:43:04] air if God made a promise to deliver is
[1:43:08] not for the air is to deliver you if God
[1:43:10] made a promise to heal is not for the

[1:45:13] hymns praise the
[1:45:15] Lord oh if you can just be able to get
[1:45:18] yourself to that place
[1:45:21] where you can speak his
[1:45:28] promises you know it's it's just like
[1:45:32] you know the prophet of God says the
[1:45:33] word of God is lying
[1:45:37] D in The
[1:45:41] Believer we don't
[1:45:46] need 50 days of church we just need one
[1:45:49] time to year the the word of God when a
[1:45:51] person comes in contact with God and
[1:45:56] that channel is open to your soul to be
[1:45:59] able to receive from God it's not when
[1:46:02] the word of God is preaching you push
[1:46:04] your mouth up and you throw it ear and
[1:46:06] you says what the person thinking this
[1:46:08] but when you can be able to receive
[1:46:10] every time you receive from God you
[1:46:13] receive the word that word goes and lie
[1:46:16] in your
[1:46:17] soul it lies D in your soul
[1:46:23] amen and that's that's the thing that
[1:46:26] that reminds you when things happen it
[1:46:30] that word is Quicken when you are going
[1:46:33] through situation that word that truth
[1:46:36] that you receive and that is lying there
[1:46:39] it quickens oh yeah the Bible
[1:46:41] says it's because you receive that
[1:46:46] promise and it's lying
[1:46:49] there
[1:46:53] praise the
[1:46:59] Lord you know in the in the in in in in
[1:47:02] the days of Noah the Bible said it like
[1:47:05] this trying to I'm trying to uh I'm
[1:47:08] struggling here to keep keep in my notes
[1:47:10] and I go to Sunday praise the
[1:47:15] Lord the scripture
[1:47:18] says that the spirit of God there was a
[1:47:21] time in the days of Noah where the
[1:47:24] spirit of God no longer
[1:47:28] strive with me so which mean there was a
[1:47:32] time there is a time where God strive
[1:47:35] with
[1:47:36] you amen he troubl your mind he trouble
[1:47:40] your heart with things and he keep
[1:47:42] bringing his promises to you I never
[1:47:44] leave you I never forsake you trust
[1:47:46] me I'm a Healer I can
[1:47:49] deliver and then we are struggling in
[1:47:51] our minds with different things there's
[1:47:53] a time where the spirit of God struggle
[1:47:56] with man just like how he rise up with
[1:48:00] Jacob but there is a time where God for
[1:48:04] his
[1:48:05] hands and he can no longer strive with
[1:48:11] you he can no longer strive with you
[1:48:16] because you have not given room to
[1:48:18] receive correction
[1:48:21] every time you argue against the word
[1:48:23] you you you have a better reason why you
[1:48:25] did what you did you argue against the
[1:48:27] word and who who even knows whether the
[1:48:30] Bible is true that thing they whole
[1:48:31] there I mean you argue again there is no
[1:48:33] place in you to
[1:48:39] receive when the preacher preaching his
[1:48:41] sermon you preaching your own in your
[1:48:46] mind you have your own
[1:48:48] God and you have have your own way to
[1:48:51] worship

[1:48:57] if it's the truth and the Living God
[1:48:59] that you have it will always bring you
[1:49:02] back to the
[1:49:04] word praise the Lord but if you don't
[1:49:07] you are not reading the Bible you just
[1:49:09] have all of this concept in your mind of
[1:49:11] what you think God is God Is Not Your

[1:49:44] think we living in an age of arrogance
[1:49:48] and people are drinking that arrogance

[1:50:59] are done
[1:51:03] here if we ever want God to be real in
[1:51:06] our midst we must respect the things
[1:51:08] that are done
[1:51:10] here praise the Lord you also have the
[1:51:16] choice you can either choose to start
[1:51:19] yours you can choose to move to another
[1:51:21] place if you just think that is just
[1:51:23] it's it's just all about laws and rules
[1:51:25] it's not really it
[1:51:28] is look we have a generation that is
[1:51:31] losing
[1:51:32] God it's just all about
[1:51:43] entertainment and all we trying to do as
[1:51:47] brothers and sisters is to make this God
[1:51:49] real in our
[1:51:51] Miss is to make him a prayer answering
[1:51:55] God when we come together and pray we
[1:51:58] know we mean what we are
[1:52:06] saying praise the
[1:52:10] Lord
[1:52:14] amen where Steve if you can just reduce
[1:52:16] the heat a little bit I'm getting on
[1:52:18] fire
[1:52:25] amen I'm getting on fire am I just am I
[1:52:30] just just run out there now amen and the
[1:52:33] neighbors will call the police because
[1:52:35] I'll be shouting all down the street
[1:52:37] repent 2020 this
[1:52:41] year praise the
[1:52:45] Lord
[1:52:48] amen what it it's a way of redemption
[1:52:51] the way to the Cross you might belong to
[1:52:54] the church that don't mean nothing
[1:52:57] that's all right I have nothing against
[1:52:59] it but that's not coming through the
[1:53:02] word of redemption through the blood by
[1:53:05] the watching of the word about the word
[1:53:07] that's the way you come to
[1:53:10] Christ Faith come by
[1:53:13] hearing and hearing of the word not
[1:53:17] joining the church hearing word and when
[1:53:21] you hear that word you must be able to
[1:53:24] have the ability to speak it to
[1:53:29] Yourself Praise the
[1:53:32] Lord you must be able people people that
[1:53:36] there I mean recently I've been going
[1:53:38] through a lot of different documentary
[1:53:40] and and seeing people that that able to
[1:53:42] memorize a whole book in the
[1:53:46] Bible a whole book not just memorizing
[1:53:49] verse I mean memorizing Matthew Mark
[1:53:52] Luke and John the whole
[1:53:55] book and many of their secret is to keep
[1:53:58] saying it over and over to
[1:54:03] themselves because as you keep saying it
[1:54:05] over and over to yourself it sticks in
[1:54:07] your
[1:54:12] mind and that is the way when you keep
[1:54:14] telling yourself I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:54:16] daughter of God it sticks in your mind
[1:54:19] it becomes your
[1:54:23] identity and when your body want to do
[1:54:25] something contrary to your
[1:54:28] confession praise the Lord
[1:54:31] amen then your body comes back because
[1:54:33] you keep telling
[1:54:35] yourself I'm a Child of
[1:54:40] God I'm a super
[1:54:43] race I'm of the royal
[1:54:48] seed praise the
[1:54:50] Lord I mean it's
[1:54:53] fascinating you go through that and and
[1:54:56] you see people I mean
[1:54:57] memorizing which of course is difficult
[1:55:00] that's one of the difficult thing in our
[1:55:03] age Christians no longer memorize
[1:55:09] scripture and you know why because it's
[1:55:12] all part of meditation we don't meditate
[1:55:15] we just sit down and
[1:55:17] worry we just lay down on our bed and
[1:55:20] worry and start thinking about thinking
[1:55:25] about we CAU up between the past in the
[1:55:31] future but it's all part of
[1:55:35] meditation when you can
[1:55:39] Mur God's promises to
[1:55:43] yourself young people that's what you
[1:55:45] should do just saying I mean the message
[1:55:48] is not enough
[1:55:51] learn to memorize
[1:55:55] scripture and when you can keep those
[1:55:57] things part of you then the Bible
[1:56:01] becomes
[1:56:02] sweeter that's why the Bible is we we we
[1:56:05] we become bold to read the
[1:56:07] Bible because as soon as you start going
[1:56:09] through the first 10 verse your eyes
[1:56:11] start
[1:56:12] closing your mind is all scattered so
[1:56:15] you can't even read a
[1:56:18] chapter
[1:56:20] fight through
[1:56:23] it devote yourself to it sooner you will
[1:56:26] find yourself reading one chapter to
[1:56:28] don't don't bother about understanding
[1:56:30] just keep
[1:56:31] reading just keep reading pretty soon a
[1:56:34] vision is going to break out and you
[1:56:36] will see the images of the Bible the
[1:56:38] whole story will start playing out to
[1:56:40] you then the Bible become a book you
[1:56:48] love
[1:56:53] if we should take resolution that's some
[1:56:55] of the things we should be thinking
[1:56:57] about there are some of the things we
[1:56:59] should be speaking to
[1:57:10] ourself by faith you are saved through
[1:57:12] Grace God speaking at your heart that's
[1:57:16] Grace whenever the word of God can speak
[1:57:19] speak to your heart that's
[1:57:23] Grace when God's word can no longer
[1:57:26] speak to your
[1:57:31] heart that's one of the that's one of
[1:57:34] the most pitiful person on the
[1:57:37] earth praise the
[1:57:39] Lord when you cannot be able to look at
[1:57:42] nature and see
[1:57:44] God praise the
[1:57:48] Lord
[1:57:50] amen when you can't even be able to look
[1:57:53] look out of your window see the snow and
[1:57:55] and and see God in
[1:57:57] it I mean just just because of couple of
[1:58:00] dollars we get so angry what the snow
[1:58:02] and what the what just angry there
[1:58:05] nothing you can do about
[1:58:07] it whether you like it or not if God
[1:58:09] bringing it down he's going to bring it
[1:58:12] down you just complain and you make
[1:58:14] yourself feel
[1:58:16] bad and he look down on you and so
[1:58:18] pitiful
[1:58:20] so you don't know that the snow bless
[1:58:24] your Harvest for the next year you don't
[1:58:26] know
[1:58:40] that it's Grace when God can speak to
[1:58:44] your
[1:58:48] heart
[1:58:50] when you when even you can be able to
[1:58:52] look
[1:58:54] at trouble things and still see God in
[1:58:58] it and be able to take the first thought
[1:59:00] maybe this is God that's
[1:59:07] Grace but if the devil can show up in
[1:59:10] all our things is the devil is the devil
[1:59:13] is the devil is the devil is the devil
[1:59:16] he show up in everything the guy he
[1:59:17] likes to show up
[1:59:20] but if you will start looking for God in
[1:59:22] every
[1:59:23] situation even in your sickness you
[1:59:26] start looking for God you will see
[1:59:30] him if you start looking for God you
[1:59:33] will see
[1:59:41] him God speaking to your heart yeah not

[2:04:28] God don't take Grace from my
[2:04:42] heart what are we speaking to
[2:04:47] ourself
[2:04:49] we know the story about Moses right down
[2:04:51] there when he came to the Red Sea have
[2:04:53] to close up yet it's almost time to pray
[2:04:56] when he came down there to the Red Sea
[2:05:00] we know what happened there Moses just
[2:05:03] said to the people the Egyptian you see
[2:05:06] today you will see them no more
[2:05:11] forever praise the
[2:05:15] Lord and then he turned around and then
[2:05:17] and then he started cry crying and

[3:58:10] God bless you s
[3:58:12] amen there is um a lot we can be
[3:58:15] thankful
[3:58:16] for and uh personally I think
[3:58:20] um the first miracle God performed in
[3:58:22] our lives is that we were bir into this
[3:58:25] earth and the last miracle is that we
[3:58:29] went to bed and we woke up praise be to
[3:58:32] God and in
[3:58:35] between they having been a lot of highs
[3:58:37] and a lot of low lows and for every High
[3:58:41] we see God for every low we see God I
[3:58:44] remember when brother one was preaching
[3:58:47] he said it is sad that
[3:58:49] sometimes we even look at nature and we
[3:58:51] are not able to even see God in it and
[3:58:53] he talked about it's sow and what I view
[3:58:56] and it just reminded me of something I
[3:58:59] already had on my mind when we came to
[3:59:02] church I just wanted to drink
[3:59:05] coffee so I went to the gas station here
[3:59:07] there was no coffee
[3:59:09] and I had gone to two other places who
[3:59:12] were just all over the
[3:59:13] place so I dropped my family and I went
[3:59:16] to our old area there I knew I would
[3:59:19] have some unfortunately I got some
[3:59:21] coffee on my way
[3:59:24] back I just enjoy nature it's just part
[3:59:27] of me if I had my own way I'll be living
[3:59:29] in the
[3:59:31] bush praise God so you know sometimes I
[3:59:36] just take pictures at random when I see
[3:59:37] something unusual I I take pictures so
[3:59:40] when I was coming from 6:10 to
[3:59:43] 252 I saw in the sky it was night but
[3:59:47] there were two white
[3:59:49] lines that crossed this way so I wanted
[3:59:52] to stop and then take a picture of
[3:59:55] it but there was traffic and then before
[3:59:58] I realized the light was green so I
[4:00:01] moved on but I was looking at it
[4:00:03] sometimes I'll be driving and I'll still
[4:00:05] take the
[4:00:06] picture but for some reason I said no
[4:00:08] let me just go when I get to
[4:00:10] church I will look for where the
[4:00:12] direction is and take the picture and
[4:00:14] when I got to church I was sitting in
[4:00:16] the I was in front there sipping my
[4:00:19] coffee then it struck me again you not
[4:00:21] taking the
[4:00:22] picture so when I looked it was right
[4:00:26] over this building over the church I
[4:00:29] took pictures of it it's not very clear
[4:00:32] but you can see the church and you can
[4:00:34] see the two white lines crossing over
[4:00:36] the church this way
[4:00:39] um I have no interpretation for
[4:00:43] that praise be to God but you know what
[4:00:47] we are serving a living God Amen am and
[4:00:49] the and and the God we are serving is
[4:00:51] pleased with whatever is going on here
[4:00:53] tonight our services to God would never
[4:00:56] be in vain amen praise the Lord like he
[4:00:59] said that one of these days you real you
[4:01:02] you already in the Rapture I remember in
[4:01:05] those days when my wife and family had
[4:01:07] been here for so
[4:01:09] long sometimes I'll be on the farm and
[4:01:11] the Aeroplane will be flying and I'll
[4:01:13] look at it so would I one day be in this
[4:01:17] I didn't know my time was coming it's
[4:01:20] just going to be like a dream like our
[4:01:22] pastor just said you know in between I'm
[4:01:26] going to be very
[4:01:27] Snappy God has done a lot for me I
[4:01:31] consider my life as a gift and it is
[4:01:37] there are several
[4:01:40] moments in my life where I should have
[4:01:42] been dead and
[4:01:44] gone several
[4:01:46] moments I can count up to four that I
[4:01:50] should have been dead and
[4:01:52] gone but there are some I don't even
[4:01:54] know
[4:01:57] about and I'm just going to take the
[4:01:59] first and I'll take a little bit because
[4:02:02] I'm a family man now I'll be very
[4:02:03] selfish talking about only
[4:02:05] myself praise the Lord you know I never
[4:02:09] told this story to anybody and my wife
[4:02:12] doesn't even know about it my mom told
[4:02:15] me when I was 3 months old coming back
[4:02:19] to what brother one was saying that this
[4:02:20] world is just a very sinful Place very
[4:02:23] nasty very Dairy it's not a place you
[4:02:26] want to be a 3 month old baby I was sick
[4:02:31] according to my mother she took me to
[4:02:33] the hospital I was giving some
[4:02:34] medication she brought me home and then
[4:02:38] my auntie who was in the
[4:02:42] house went and opened the
[4:02:45] medicine she emptied it in the
[4:02:48] sink and then she filled it with
[4:02:50] something else only God knows what she
[4:02:52] filled it with so she came now to give
[4:02:56] me the medication it was time and when
[4:02:59] she looked at it it was something
[4:03:02] else so she Drew my father's
[4:03:05] attention that this medicine is
[4:03:07] different
[4:03:09] it was not what she gave me the first
[4:03:10] time and when they proed into it it was
[4:03:13] my auntie who did that you can't imagine
[4:03:17] a threeyear old baby I mean a 3mon old
[4:03:20] baby who doesn't even know anything who
[4:03:23] has never insulted anybody has never
[4:03:25] caused anybody any pain or
[4:03:27] harm that somebody could hate a baby so
[4:03:30] much to do
[4:03:32] that this world is a place you wouldn't
[4:03:35] want to have anything to do with God has
[4:03:37] been so so good to me apart from that 7
[4:03:40] years later I got drowned completely
[4:03:44] drowned end of story but the hand of God
[4:03:47] brought me out I'm not going to go into
[4:03:49] it all because I know time is very
[4:03:50] precious
[4:03:51] now and a few years ago I had a dream
[4:03:55] that there were two casket in my home
[4:03:59] and then my first born and my second
[4:04:01] born were dead and people came to
[4:04:04] sympathize with
[4:04:05] us um we didn't know where it was going
[4:04:07] to come from but we just started praying
[4:04:11] and just
[4:04:12] praying and I can count three places
[4:04:16] where that was going to happen but God
[4:04:18] has been very very faithful that all of
[4:04:21] this never happened his grace has kept
[4:04:25] us and I just want to give God the glory
[4:04:27] for it and I praise His holy name
[4:04:30] tonight I wouldn't take much of your
[4:04:32] time because I know everybody has a
[4:04:35] story to tell God bless you all amen
[4:04:38] [Applause]
[4:04:41] amen wonderful Jesus amen praise the
[4:04:46] Lord
[4:04:52] amen who uh who want to come
[4:04:57] next come on sister
[4:05:00] Faith then uh after
[4:05:03] sister oh okay come on okay
[4:05:10] not really want to talk about a lot of
[4:05:12] personal things but I just felt like the
[4:05:13] Lord just kind of laid this on my heart
[4:05:15] so maybe it's for somebody
[4:05:17] tonight
[4:05:19] um over the last probably about two
[4:05:22] years um I just have really been
[4:05:25] struggling with a lot of fear um and
[4:05:28] nothing that you would think would be
[4:05:30] any big deal but just I guess what most
[4:05:32] people call anxiety um and it's you know
[4:05:35] starts out as something really small but
[4:05:37] the thing about fears that when you
[4:05:39] start to accept one Satan will multiply
[4:05:41] that for
[4:05:42] you and you know it i' kind of just push
[4:05:45] it off and push it off and I just kind
[4:05:48] of come to the place where sometimes I
[4:05:50] just would lay down at night and I just
[4:05:52] would have my head would just be
[4:05:53] swimming just with just fearful thoughts
[4:05:56] and it would just make me feel just so
[4:05:58] paralyzed and um brother Daryl Ward was
[4:06:02] here about a month and a half ago and I
[4:06:05] just been you know thinking about it and
[4:06:07] just kind of holding it in my heart and
[4:06:09] just thinking you know Lord I kind of
[4:06:10] found some ways to cope some ways to
[4:06:13] kind of distract myself and to get
[4:06:16] myself out of that mindset but I just
[4:06:18] was thinking you know Lord I don't have
[4:06:20] to live like
[4:06:21] this if I'm a Child of God I don't have
[4:06:24] to accept this
[4:06:26] and that first night the de War preached
[4:06:29] on fear
[4:06:34] and as he was he kind of gave some h
[4:06:37] hypothetical examples of you know maybe
[4:06:40] Satan's telling you this or maybe you're
[4:06:42] feeling this and it's like I could have
[4:06:43] gone down the line check check check
[4:06:45] check check it was just everything that
[4:06:48] I had just been battling with and it
[4:06:51] just at that moment just it made me
[4:06:53] aware that the Lord had heard my prayer
[4:06:57] as weak as it was in that moment and I
[4:07:00] walked away from that service and I just
[4:07:04] felt like the Lord had just planted the
[4:07:05] seed in my heart and convicted me that
[4:07:08] you haven't been in the word much how
[4:07:11] can you expect to be prepared to face
[4:07:14] the enemy when you haven't you know yeah
[4:07:16] you pray but where's your Bible how
[4:07:19] dusty is it have you really been in the
[4:07:21] word and I just kind of went forward
[4:07:24] from that moment and said Lord even if
[4:07:27] it's five minutes even if it's 10
[4:07:28] minutes every day I'm going to set aside
[4:07:31] some time and
[4:07:33] just just spend with you and maybe I
[4:07:36] don't like brother the blad they was
[4:07:37] saying tonight maybe I don't understand
[4:07:39] what it says maybe I don't have time to
[4:07:42] pull out my strongest concordance and
[4:07:44] the message and my Bible all in one spot
[4:07:46] but I believe that you'll bless even the
[4:07:50] six verses I get in tonight you
[4:07:52] know um but it still kind of it stuck
[4:07:56] with me and I just found from that
[4:07:58] moment it's like Satan was just battling
[4:08:00] me even
[4:08:01] worse and it was not
[4:08:05] maybe two and a half weeks later i'
[4:08:07] actually stayed home that night because
[4:08:10] Jordan and I had a trip the next morning
[4:08:12] and I was at home and I thought well I'm
[4:08:15] going to get ready for our trip and I'm
[4:08:17] going to be The Good Wife and get us all
[4:08:18] packed up and um it was probably
[4:08:21] honestly I believe it was just the Lord
[4:08:23] because you know me being back in The
[4:08:24] Sound Room I I don't often get a chance
[4:08:27] to really kind of just involve myself in
[4:08:29] the service as much and so I live
[4:08:32] streamed it and um brother blatte was
[4:08:36] preaching on uh uncovering the shame and
[4:08:40] I kind of realized at that
[4:08:43] moment that I had just ignored it and I
[4:08:48] guess I had kind of approached it with
[4:08:49] the thought of you know I'm not going to
[4:08:51] give the devil any Glory I'm not going
[4:08:53] to claim this so I'm not going to talk
[4:08:54] about it I'm not going to I'm not going
[4:08:56] to expose it and I didn't think of it in
[4:08:59] that way but I realized at that moment
[4:09:02] that I hadn't exposed it I hadn't
[4:09:04] uncovered it and so when my husband got
[4:09:07] a home that
[4:09:08] night uh we just I laid in bed and I
[4:09:11] said did you hear did you get a chance
[4:09:13] to really listen to the service cuz of
[4:09:14] course he's back in the S room too and
[4:09:16] he said well you know I heard some bits
[4:09:18] and beeses here and I just said well I
[4:09:20] just want to I need to tell you
[4:09:21] something and I just kind of told him
[4:09:23] exactly what had been going on in my
[4:09:25] heart and in my mind and I just said I
[4:09:29] just I just feel like I just can't shake
[4:09:31] it and he just looked at me and he said
[4:09:34] you know
[4:09:35] faith if Satan is trying to tell tell
[4:09:37] you these things if he's trying to put
[4:09:39] these things in your head that's proof
[4:09:41] that it's not true because he's lying to
[4:09:44] you and we're just going to pray and
[4:09:46] we're just going to ask the Lord to just
[4:09:49] take these things from you and we prayed
[4:09:52] and it was just simple it was just
[4:09:55] simple but from that moment I've been
[4:09:58] delivered and I just want to thank
[4:10:06] Lord so I just want to encourage each of
[4:10:09] you maybe you know in my mind before i'
[4:10:12] had gone through this I thought well
[4:10:14] it's all in your head you just brush it
[4:10:15] off right maybe you're afraid to talk
[4:10:18] about it maybe you're afraid to expose
[4:10:21] that for what it is just know that it's
[4:10:24] it's not you find somebody that you
[4:10:26] trust and pray with them and accept that
[4:10:30] Deliverance because you know it's it's
[4:10:33] like that song that brother darl had had
[4:10:35] sang during that service you know I I
[4:10:37] don't have to be a slave to fear because
[4:10:39] I'm a Child of God so just want to give
[4:10:42] the Lord glory for
[4:10:48] that praise the the Lord amen I'm no
[4:10:54] longer as

[4:11:05] testimony and that week

[4:11:09] song I was actually at work and I was
[4:11:14] uh uh I've really never paid attention
[4:11:17] to it I might have heard it but that was
[4:11:19] the first time that particular week and

[4:25:53] amen and God Rich bless you um I I mean
[4:25:58] it's just like a testimony I think on
[4:26:00] Monday I was uh I think I was with the
[4:26:04] pastor on Sunday night so we pretty much
[4:26:07] spend a lot of time together and then
[4:26:09] right after that I was supposed to go
[4:26:11] you know to get ready for uh to go to
[4:26:13] work on Monday then uh the same Monday
[4:26:17] when I was on my on my way back to work
[4:26:19] I was driving because usually I put
[4:26:21] music in the car to make sure that you
[4:26:23] know I can't sing and stuff so I was
[4:26:25] just you know my mind went through a lot
[4:26:27] of things because it was based on the
[4:26:29] job and difficulties I've been going
[4:26:30] through and I was just singing in the
[4:26:32] car and I was really really s it was one
[4:26:34] of like the worst day of my life so I
[4:26:37] was just driving and when I got home um
[4:26:41] I usually have the habit of playing
[4:26:43] music most of the time or reading the
[4:26:45] prophet you know or I'll just let the
[4:26:47] prophet play you know and I'll sit there
[4:26:49] just listening to it or maybe just study
[4:26:52] the Bible or something like that so I
[4:26:55] start listening to um to a sermon I
[4:26:58] think one of the preacher actually back
[4:27:00] home so he was preaching about different
[4:27:02] things and after that I got on my knees
[4:27:04] and I started praying so I stopped
[4:27:06] praying and then when I was praying I
[4:27:08] asked God I said God I want you to come
[4:27:10] in my room tonight you know that was my
[4:27:13] desire I wanted him in my room that tues
[4:27:16] that Monday uh night so I stopped
[4:27:19] praying and praying and praying I said
[4:27:21] if Simon the Pharisee called you and to
[4:27:25] embarrass you how much more me I need
[4:27:26] something from you so that night I just
[4:27:29] pray about it I put a tape and went went
[4:27:32] to sleep because that's Al also the deal
[4:27:34] with this the dream when when I have bed
[4:27:36] dreams I usually just let the tap play
[4:27:38] all night so that's what I usually do
[4:27:40] and it helps me a lot so I went to bed
[4:27:43] and I had this dream um I was
[4:27:47] actually walking in the middle of like a
[4:27:50] bu like in the middle of big build uh uh
[4:27:53] big buildings and stuff so as I was

[4:28:02] people were leaving the whole the houses
[4:28:04] to join me and to sing only the leave
[4:28:06] with me so as I was walking then I saw a
[4:28:10] young man running because apparently he
[4:28:12] had like bad Spirit or something like of
[4:28:14] such so he was running and then I
[4:28:17] stopped I was kind of turning around to
[4:28:19] try to find him but it was just slipping
[4:28:21] out of my eyes and stuff so something
[4:28:23] spoke in my heart you can't just speak
[4:28:26] the word and that child will stop and he
[4:28:28] would be healed oh I turned my eyes and
[4:28:31] I saw the kid and I said it you demon of
[4:28:33] this get out of this child and and then
[4:28:36] I saw the child falling on the ground
[4:28:38] right right away so when the child fall
[4:28:40] on the ground I went to him then he he
[4:28:42] came to me and said oh you know what I
[4:28:44] have to testify I said what happened so
[4:28:46] he told me you know when you you cast
[4:28:48] that demon I saw something like a steam
[4:28:50] getting out of my my chest like a spirit
[4:28:53] or something dark left me and stuff so I
[4:28:55] got up on my bed I didn't know what you
[4:28:57] know most of the time I usually have
[4:28:59] such a dream before so it happened more
[4:29:01] often so I just pray and you know went

[4:29:05] thank God for it for everything he has
[4:29:07] done

[4:30:12] start standing before you he it's just
[4:30:15] go it's SC that got the life thing in
[4:30:21] here from
[4:30:23] 2016 to 2019 was a year for
[4:30:27] me I have a
[4:30:32] lot but coming to the end of 2019
[4:30:36] God did it for
[4:30:38] me he did it for me I don't even know
[4:30:40] what to see because it wasn't
[4:30:45] easy it all started in November because
[4:30:50] I've been sick since
[4:30:52] 2016 most of you here know the story so
[4:30:55] I don't need to go back at him because
[4:30:59] when I came into the country I knew
[4:31:01] nothing about
[4:31:03] transpl I have my baby
[4:31:07] it was when they told me that my li was
[4:31:10] faing I had liver
[4:31:13] sorosis
[4:31:15] so it was sis ir and sister Kelly was
[4:31:20] the one took me to the hospital and then
[4:31:23] they did a labor biy and came up with
[4:31:25] the result I had labor
[4:31:28] sosis so we were just on it the day they
[4:31:32] told me I have some roses sis IR and sis
[4:31:37] KY we sat to the hospital a hour goog we
[4:31:41] went on YouTube checking for what they
[4:31:42] call
[4:31:44] roses say she don't
[4:31:46] know we we I we can't reading let just
[4:31:50] go home she said but my first hearing
[4:31:54] anything but they told me they said oh
[4:31:56] you young so probably the L will get
[4:31:59] better by itself you don't have to worry
[4:32:01] about it but if it don't get better then
[4:32:04] you will need a
[4:32:06] SP and then I told sis I say sis it will
[4:32:10] get better I got a fear that it will get
[4:32:11] better S say yeah let's go home not but

[4:32:18] check on theet for the Roses because the
[4:32:22] thing that they calling roses I don't
[4:32:23] see it in you so I really don't know and
[4:32:26] they say this thing come for people who
[4:32:27] drink and smoke in your entire life you
[4:32:29] don't drink you don't smoke so how come
[4:32:32] and most of the time we see this thing
[4:32:34] in older people

[4:53:37] prayers uh as you all know I felt sick
[4:53:40] after church I went home I wasn't really
[4:53:44] sick I was home doing laundry and I just
[4:53:48] SC P just crack me down to the ground
[4:53:52] and uh I was taken from home by 911 and
[4:53:58] they had to fight with me sometime in
[4:54:01] the ambulance as they said
[4:54:04] but uh I open my eyes and after a while
[4:54:08] I saw my my father and my brother and
[4:54:13] he's just
[4:54:14] my he's a lot to
[4:54:17] me and uh he look at me and he said baby
[4:54:21] don't worry just keep the faith I know
[4:54:25] it's not easy to kind of take up the
[4:54:29] cross but when you do take out the cross
[4:54:34] and decide to follow Christ there are a
[4:54:36] lot of things that happen along the way
[4:54:38] so I had this horrible pain that keep
[4:54:41] bothering
[4:54:42] me uh I've been to the hospital they did
[4:54:45] a lot of different test C SC M and
[4:54:49] everything and they said everything is
[4:54:52] normal we don't know what is causing
[4:54:54] your
[4:54:55] pain we just can't figure it I say well
[4:54:58] that's good I'm happy to know that
[4:55:01] everything is okay and God is in control
[4:55:03] so I'm Standing on the Promises of God
[4:55:07] so when I come to church sometimes I
[4:55:09] feel pain sometimes I don't I come to
[4:55:12] church and when people say how you do I
[4:55:14] say well I'm Standing on the Promises
[4:55:16] because uh God is a God that cannot lie
[4:55:21] he's a God that cannot fail and I know
[4:55:25] that and I trust that and I believe that
[4:55:28] and because of the grace of God I'm
[4:55:30] standing here today because the pain
[4:55:33] that I I feel when I feel it it's like
[4:55:35] my heart is about to stop I cannot move
[4:55:38] my life I cannot do
[4:55:41] anything I open my mouth and scream and
[4:55:45] my kids would be so confused and it
[4:55:47] would keep running head to scatter and
[4:55:49] then I would have this core that would
[4:55:51] run from my toe all the way to my head
[4:55:54] and then I would after that I would
[4:55:56] start to bleed it just not once you know
[4:56:00] not just the pain so I look at it and my
[4:56:03] husband we will keep praying all the
[4:56:06] time he would look at me he say you know
[4:56:08] sometimes I wonder how you go about
[4:56:11] these things you go to work and come
[4:56:13] back I say yes I go to work because I
[4:56:15] know I'm a Christian and I know that God
[4:56:18] is in control I go to work I do my
[4:56:20] normal Duty because that's why God
[4:56:23] require of me and I cannot complain
[4:56:26] because the more I complain is is like
[4:56:29] I'm trying to make the devil to continue
[4:56:31] his attack so
[4:56:34] I got on my name I said devil you are a
[4:56:37] liar you're not going to
[4:56:40] succeed not today not even tomorrow not
[4:56:44] into another word I say I'm a Child of
[4:56:47] God I know God is able I know God is has
[4:56:51] healed me I know that I have this
[4:56:54] testimony and I told myself today I said
[4:56:57] I'm going to testify to the glory of God
[4:56:59] because I know greater is he that live
[4:57:01] in me than he that live in the world
[4:57:04] amen so uh I also want to give God the
[4:57:07] glory for all
[4:57:09] other cumstances that I've have been
[4:57:12] faced with when it comes to my
[4:57:15] career I've been a nurse from back home

[4:57:28] up to continue in my feeld of study and
[4:57:31] it has been a lot of challenge
[4:57:34] uh at the time I felt sick it was the
[4:57:37] time I I had to go and uh challenge the
[4:57:41] state bow and I because I I felt sick I
[4:57:44] ran out of time and then I was councel
[4:57:48] and I have to start everything all but I
[4:57:50] give God the glory because I have life
[4:57:52] because with life everything is possible

[5:12:52] brother I don't want to get in trouble
[5:12:54] with the
[5:13:00] Deacons
[5:13:12] I just want to thank the whole
[5:13:15] church for your
[5:13:20] prayers I came to this country without a
[5:13:25] child after seven years of
[5:13:29] marriage and when we came to this church
[5:13:33] and God visited
[5:13:36] us and gave us
[5:13:38] Grace and it was a miracle for
[5:13:44] us when we told the family back in
[5:13:47] Africa that we have a child
[5:13:49] now and they were all
[5:13:53] happy not only they were
[5:13:56] happy and they were expecting another
[5:14:00] child and Grace it took a time
[5:14:06] while and people start asking thems qu
[5:14:09] start asking
[5:14:10] questions why is it taking longer than
[5:14:15] expected and my husband was asking
[5:14:17] himself some question as
[5:14:21] well and then we were kind of having
[5:14:28] arguments uh we just thank the pastor
[5:14:33] once once one time he told
[5:14:37] him look at
[5:14:40] Grace and continue to maintain that
[5:14:43] faith and if God gave
[5:14:47] Grace and if you need another
[5:14:49] child and God will always
[5:14:54] [Music]
[5:14:55] providece I thank God for
[5:14:58] Grace because it's just a miracle
[5:15:04] when we stopped praying for our second
[5:15:10] child I was praying without a choice
[5:15:13] saying it can be a girl and
[5:15:17] boy and Grace told
[5:15:21] me Mom you have you first have a
[5:15:26] boy and after the boy you have a
[5:15:30] girl
[5:15:34] and I took it
[5:15:41] seriously when I was pregnant uh having
[5:15:44] Samuel people start asking me are you
[5:15:46] going to have a boy or a
[5:15:50] girl if Grace was probably on my side we
[5:15:52] say it's a GU it's a
[5:15:58] boy and when we went to check on the sex
[5:16:01] to verify if it was a
[5:16:04] boy oh it was the boy
[5:16:10] actually and when we started praying for
[5:16:12] the SEC the third
[5:16:16] child she was very specific in her
[5:16:19] prayer God blessed my mom with a baby
[5:16:23] girl
[5:16:28] mhm Pap no
[5:16:32] his dad was
[5:16:35] saying he said no I also have another
[5:16:42] boy I told him that we cannot you know
[5:16:45] we cannot discuss with Grace
[5:16:52] Fai and Grace said it's going to be a
[5:16:54] boy then a girl then I believe there's
[5:16:56] going to be a girl effective and that's
[5:16:59] exactly what happened
[5:17:08] above all I just want to thank God
[5:17:14] because for others it's easy to have a
[5:17:17] child for me wasn't
[5:17:20] easy I came I actually came from a
[5:17:23] family of seven
[5:17:25] children and I am the
[5:17:29] third and uh dear a child of my my
[5:17:37] dad and when I had a problem with child
[5:17:40] and it became his
[5:17:43] problem the first day when I told him
[5:17:49] that and when I told him that the doctor
[5:17:51] said it was not going to be possible for
[5:17:53] me to have a
[5:17:55] child he cried all
[5:17:58] night as a child like a child
[5:18:03] and my mom called
[5:18:08] me they said why did you tell your dad
[5:18:10] about that
[5:18:13] news and I told her that I wanted
[5:18:16] everybody to
[5:18:20] know and it just went
[5:18:28] back above all I just want to thank God
[5:18:30] and it wasn't easy
[5:18:34] allith and with
[5:18:39] faith I was in the
[5:18:43] hospital before I delivered the
[5:18:50] child when I was getting closer to the
[5:18:52] due
[5:18:54] date and my husband was supposed to
[5:19:00] travel
[5:19:03] God told him to cancel the
[5:19:08] trip I told him don't cancel the trip
[5:19:11] you have to go because it's your work
[5:19:12] your
[5:19:18] job even though it was near the due date
[5:19:21] you can just go you can still
[5:19:29] go he told me that you know he was
[5:19:31] feeling something in his heart that he
[5:19:33] had to uh to cancel the the
[5:19:42] Trap and the same day they were supposed
[5:19:45] to travel is the day that they called me
[5:19:46] in the hospital to have the
[5:19:50] child I went to the
[5:19:54] hospital and the child was now
[5:20:00] well and they had to stop the pr the
[5:20:03] pregnancy as soon as
[5:20:07] possible and after the c
[5:20:12] section and I had very different
[5:20:18] complications and the doctor say I don't
[5:20:20] know why do you have a lot of
[5:20:23] complications and I kept my
[5:20:28] faith because I believ that God
[5:20:32] what he started and he had to finish
[5:20:37] it he is the beginning and the
[5:20:45] end I left the hospital and went
[5:20:55] home and the devil came to visit me like
[5:20:58] he did the same way uh during the the
[5:21:01] birth of
[5:21:04] Grace but this time he just lost
[5:21:08] battle
[5:21:13] amen when he wanted to bring some
[5:21:15] complication
[5:21:20] in I threw up all
[5:21:24] night and I
[5:21:28] feared and the next day I went to the
[5:21:31] emcy
[5:21:34] room and the doctor check
[5:21:43] everything you you have something in
[5:21:53] your and you had to go through surgery
[5:21:58] again I said Lord we give me this child
[5:22:03] and the Bible
[5:22:05] says it's the blessing of the Lord that
[5:22:19] enrich okay so basically the the
[5:22:23] blessing of the Lord that enriches you
[5:22:25] and it doesn't bring any he
[5:22:29] no
[5:22:34] and remove that I ask God to remove that
[5:22:36] sorrow inside of
[5:22:40] me thank God because you have removed
[5:22:47] [Music]
[5:22:55] it so I went back to the hospital and
[5:22:58] the doctor says I don't think that it's
[5:23:00] real
[5:23:04] and we're going to observe you for a
[5:23:08] while and after a while they they let me
[5:23:12] go I thank the Lord for
[5:23:17] it also want to thank the church for
[5:23:19] your
[5:23:21] prayers
[5:23:23] [Music]
[5:23:24] [Applause]
[5:23:26] amen praise the
[5:23:28] Lord amen
[5:23:31] uh
[5:23:33] sister

[5:23:38] testimony about her health her
[5:23:41] hands and uh sister
[5:23:45] K
[5:23:47] uh sister Lawrence
[5:23:50] Titi
[5:23:52] uh uh we talk about brother Ezekiel he
[5:23:56] bring his on the testimony when he show
[5:23:59] up uh
[5:24:01] Aon you have to go to Liberia and come
[5:24:03] back before you give your testimony
[5:24:06] okay so he's not
[5:24:09] here praise the Lord he's not here we'll
[5:24:11] send him by faith amen make sure that
[5:24:14] that is done I just want to say a little
[5:24:18] bit uh I know we all try to do our best
[5:24:22] as we come here to serve the
[5:24:25] Lord but I'm hoping that the coming year
[5:24:28] the Lord will really help us we have uh
[5:24:32] there are gifted people in this church
[5:24:35] you see uh sister terce by the way I
[5:24:38] wanted for brother Ariel to to interpret
[5:24:41] I wanted to jump in but I said no he
[5:24:43] should interpret and then he was kind of
[5:24:46] struggling with some of those maternity
[5:24:48] words you he will learn
[5:24:55] them some of them he was a bit shy
[5:24:59] but
[5:25:01] well yeah so I'm hoping that a coming
[5:25:03] year the Lord will really help us and
[5:25:05] there are some things we have to work on
[5:25:08] and uh because if if he can get us to
[5:25:12] where uh he can get us this assembly has
[5:25:16] gone through a lot the coming year we
[5:25:18] make this church 25 years and uh uh
[5:25:22] there was a there was a 10 year about 10
[5:25:25] 12 years of a desert period for this
[5:25:27] church and now when we get to that Time
[5:25:30] Lord history will be will be given to
[5:25:32] you but I believe we are at a place
[5:25:35] where uh there's a new crop that is
[5:25:38] growing and if God can be able to help
[5:25:41] us and we can really dedicate ourself to
[5:25:44] it and uh and mean business for the
[5:25:47] reason why we come here there are things
[5:25:50] that will happen through this
[5:25:52] church and uh that will be a blessing to
[5:25:56] many of us and uh you know when uh you
[5:25:59] know uh
[5:26:01] sister uh uh well might gave her
[5:26:04] testimony but darl W up I invied him
[5:26:07] specially for that Thanksgiving service
[5:26:10] because I knew there was something that
[5:26:12] we had to be thankful for and I talked
[5:26:14] to brother dared about it I told him
[5:26:17] about it I told him what we were dealing
[5:26:18] with in church and I says I think you
[5:26:21] are the man that we need to come we just
[5:26:24] don't invite preachers because we want
[5:26:26] preachers to come or we don't have
[5:26:28] message to preach having lot of them
[5:26:30] that have not even preached yet and uh
[5:26:34] even though you know we have a lot of
[5:26:36] brothers that comes through most of them
[5:26:39] are my friends they comes to visit me
[5:26:41] and then we give them the privilege to
[5:26:44] preach but when we set up special
[5:26:46] meetings there's there is reason why we
[5:26:49] do it the different meetings that we
[5:26:51] have through the year Easter Memorial
[5:26:54] Day service and all of those things
[5:26:57] there reason why we do it as we go on in
[5:27:00] in this year here we will talk about
[5:27:02] those things it kind of break my heart
[5:27:04] sometimes we set up meeting we bring
[5:27:07] preachers and there is no and the people
[5:27:09] are not ready you know you will expect
[5:27:12] that people will take up time from their
[5:27:13] work and I mean to be into it you
[5:27:17] announce meeting you announce meeting
[5:27:19] the services come and people don't uh
[5:27:21] you know uh you know they don't even
[5:27:23] they forget some says I forget I mean
[5:27:26] it's just it's just a kind of a but we
[5:27:29] are getting there praise the Lord Lord
[5:27:31] and I mean I see people I talk to them
[5:27:34] and I see even in the life of some of
[5:27:36] the young people you know they will talk
[5:27:39] to me and and talk about the way God is
[5:27:41] dealing with them and I mean dreams and
[5:27:43] different things and uh uh you know uh
[5:27:48] and all of those things so I mean
[5:27:50] there's there there's lot of things that
[5:27:54] uh we went through uh this gone year in
[5:27:57] this church I mean there was we were
[5:27:59] very close to have in the

[5:36:02] what is ahead of us I don't know what's
[5:36:04] going through his mind but I still have
[5:36:08] God I want day you know we come through
[5:36:11] this door we become the church together
[5:36:13] because I just want a family I don't
[5:36:16] want to be alone that's what I want to
[5:36:19] come to church I see all my friends with
[5:36:20] my husbands and everything it's like I
[5:36:23] don't even have you know so I just pray
[5:36:26] that God will touch his heart
[5:36:30] he will
[5:36:31] come he's not
[5:36:33] like the perfect person but we all are
[5:36:37] not but at least you know that that
[5:36:40] little courage that we can be a family
[5:36:42] and share the word of God together so I
[5:36:45] just want to okay so I just want to
[5:36:49] bless God and tell the almighty God
[5:36:51] thank you that this new year will be a
[5:36:54] different year for me for me and my
[5:36:56] family me and my sisters my daddy my
[5:36:59] momy me and everybody and when sister
[5:37:03] testify with fear I also have that kind
[5:37:08] of evil thoughts that comes through my
[5:37:11] mind you know um since I lost my mother
[5:37:14] I think I share with brother one one
[5:37:16] time but that fear of death is always on
[5:37:23] my mind like when I'm driving some you
[5:37:25] would just come to me what if this truck
[5:37:27] just run over you and you die you know
[5:37:30] or somebody is telling me something
[5:37:32] sometime at work something just come to
[5:37:35] me why if somebody call you and say
[5:37:36] something happened to pray at home what
[5:37:38] are you going to do you know all those
[5:37:40] things they just keep playing on my mind
[5:37:42] like I don't even think I don't even
[5:37:44] know what to think and sometimes when I
[5:37:46] lie night night I have to like U just
[5:37:48] put my headphone my ear and then put my
[5:37:51] Bible on reading the volume and then it
[5:37:54] would just be playing my ear reading
[5:37:56] from one chapter to the another and then
[5:37:59] I will I sleep on it so when the pastor
[5:38:02] came down night that was my prayer
[5:38:04] request to him that the Lord should
[5:38:06] renew my mind and take away these kind
[5:38:09] of evil thoughts away from me so and he
[5:38:14] told me that I should just continue to
[5:38:16] read my Bible each and every day I
[5:38:18] shouldn't give up I would just be
[5:38:20] reading and be reading and be reading
[5:38:22] and then whenever the thought come to my
[5:38:24] mind I should just whatever Bible verse
[5:38:26] that come to my heart I should just say
[5:38:29] out and then I I thought to leave my
[5:38:32] head so the fear or whatever they call
[5:38:36] it is real it take over you and you are
[5:38:40] not able to do anything over yourself it
[5:38:41] make me so weak I'm tired I don't even
[5:38:44] know what to do when I L I'm triming
[5:38:46] when it come because sometimes in my
[5:38:48] hair like I'm playing my own funeral
[5:38:50] like I'm washing my own funeral like
[5:38:52] somebody is telling you that you know
[5:38:53] you are Ying this is you ly out right
[5:38:55] here you know it just be playing on my
[5:38:57] mind and I don't know what to do about
[5:38:59] about it but sometime I think I don't
[5:39:01] know if the death of my mother you know
[5:39:04] is still troubles me I don't I don't
[5:39:06] know I don't understand it I haven't
[5:39:08] shared with anybody before but sister f
[5:39:10] have brought the courage for every to S
[5:39:12] here today and be able to share among
[5:39:14] you guys so can to remember me in prayer
[5:39:17] that this spirit of fear or whatever it
[5:39:20] is where they coming from I come to take
[5:39:21] over the church or whatever the children
[5:39:23] of God and God will take it away from us
[5:39:25] in Jesus

[5:40:07] continue to love that
[5:40:09] person and live the word of God the best
[5:40:13] way possible become the Living Word of
