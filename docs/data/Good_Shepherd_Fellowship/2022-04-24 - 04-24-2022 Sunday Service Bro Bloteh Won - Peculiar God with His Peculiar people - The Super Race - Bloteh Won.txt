if i'm not seeing you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] praise the lord hallelujah but uh it's good to be here uh uh uh this morning and uh i think we did that uh it's it's also it's a chorus from uh from south africa i think one of those brothers uh wrote that uh for us we sunk it before and it's uh uh in the secret place come the super race those who have seen elohim face to face the capstone has come down crying grace grace grace we are heading away we are heading away in the secret place from the secret place [Music] face to face the capstone has come down crying grace grace grace we are

are heading the way we are heading away in the secret place one more time oh yeah from the secret place come the super race those who have said elohim face to face the capstone sky i'm crying grace grace grace we are heading away we are heading away in the secret bless the lord bless you let's take our bible i want to talk something a little bit on the super race this morning that's what i thought on that chorus i'll be speaking on the peculiar god with his peculiar people peculiar god with his peculiar people the super race let's read psalm 100. praise the lord hallelujah exam 100 make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye land save the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that have made us i want to emphasize on that verse because of a portion of my inspiration is coming from there know ye that the lord elohim amen amen know he that the lord jehovah is elohim that's that in hebrew that's the way it is know ye that jehovah yahweh he is elohim it is he that have made us and not we ourself amen he's the one that have designed us he's the one that have craft our ways and not ourself sometimes we think we are having our own way but god's people are peculiar and the way he made us is very peculiar no matter how much we try to imitate and impersonate we there is no two persons the same that's right thank you lord know ye that the lord he is god and it is he that have made us and now we ourself we are his people and the sheep of his posture enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his couch with praise be thankful unto him why because he made you praise the lord amen the only way to be able to appreciate the way that god made you is for you to be thankful to him praise the lord and if you are not appreciating the way that god made you you are not being thankful to him praise the lord [Music] be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good and his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth for all generations praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seat let's go to ask chapter 17 the book of acts chapter 17 and pretty soon you will see where we are drawing our our thoughts from but we want to talk on the peculiar god with his peculiar people over and over john right on from exeter god started speaking about his people being a peculiar treasure so we want to look into that this morning and trust that the lord will be able to help us praise the lord amen glory be to god i know those brothers from uh from iowa they you know they have they have a way of holding the service down so if i stay along this morning you blame them they have a way of just grounding the preacher they either run you out of your notes or they ground you danny i'm putting a lot of responsibility on you buddy god bless you amen as chapter 17 let's read verse 26 house chapter 17. let's read verse 26. praise the lord this was at athens on mars hill verse let's read from verse 24 god that made the word in all things therein seeing that he is the lord just the same as david said in the son the lord of heaven and earth do all if not in temple made with hints neither is worship with man's hands as though he need anything seeing he gave it to all life and breath into all things and have made of one blood all nation now this scripture is very powerful because the word blood here in the greek is uh uh amara if i pre if i'm if i'm pronouncing the right it means that god from one race made all men amen god from one blood meaning from one race make all men are we together and he has he have made of one blood all nations of men that uh of men fall to dwarf on the face of the earth and have determined the times before i pointed and the bounds of the habitation of i had a translation that i wanted to read to you i forget i did not add it to my notes so uh uh uh but it it right here it expressed how god from one race made all men and distribute us to our different nations and he determined our time on the face of the earth that's very powerful amen because we'll realize as uh if we have time to look into it that you know that brother branham says it's a place that we grow up is the environment that changed our color scheme praise the lord but of one race that is the human race amen so god of one race made all men praise the lord so if you look at the word peculiar this blew my mind blew my mind it took me it took it took me off my feet so if my mind is blown in my feet i'm off my feet then you should know that i'm dead it blew my mind the word peculiar in this origin it's a latin word that starts uh pecued means cattle it means cattle cattle like a sheep fall you know like like you get cattles and it also comes from a word called peculium which means property you know and it means private property and peculiar in the in the latin means particular so if you if you think about it as we'll go and look in the scripture you realize that like like david said in the psalm knowing that he is our god we are his people the sheep of his posture so that's why we are peculiar to him because god looks at us as his cuddles the sheep of his pasture praise the lord and it's not just only a group of herbs of cattle but a private property a private property that's how he looks at each and every one of us we are his private property we don't belong to no bishop no man no church we don't belong to no nation we are god's heritage we are his private property praise the lord you see we belong to god so much that it's only god that understand us and we don't even understand ourselves that's that's that is such a hole that he has on us that he knows our laying down he knows our waking up he knows our going out and our coming he number the hairs on our head amen praise the lord he know which train is one and which one is the last number he numbered him now that he count them but he numbered he said this one is one this other one here is two the other one is three praise the praise the lord and when the lord wants you to start losing your head he says well let's section four leave your head then you get a little ball here you get a little ball on his eye he calls them by number praise the lord [Laughter] i better want to understand what i'm talking about so glory be to god the hebrew carried the same sense of word it means possession it means property value property peculiar treasure amen so let's go to exodus chapter 19. we want we just want to trace do a little tracy and then we will get into getting to preaching amen exodus chapter 19 uh let's let's let's get in chapter 19 there you know uh we've been taught by the prophet never to take one verse to make a doctrine you can never take one verse in the bible neither can you take one quote in the message to make a doctrine out of it you have to run it through the scripture amen because then you see the bigger picture so exodus chapter 19 listen to this verse 3 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thou shalt thou say unto the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto their egyptians and how i beared you on eagle wings and brought you unto myself praise the lord amen we never saw no physical wings that the children of israel was bearing on even though they were walking through the the red sea they were walking all over the place but god says supernaturally i bear you on eagle wings in the sense that you are under my protection all of those chairs that were running from egypt could never harm you even though you saw the dust in the air you saw the the the the you heard the noise of the cherub you could see the sword of the egyptian but you were all my wings you are honor my protection praise the lord and how i bury you on ego wings and brought you to myself listen to this now now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my coveting then yes shall be a peculiar treasure unto me now when you read this it sounds like god was saying if you do this then you're going to be this is that how it sounds praise the lord or i'm the one reading it wrong if you obey my voice indeed and keep my coveting then yes shall be a peculiar treasure unto me praise the lord above all people for all the earth is mine but i have pulled you aside to make you a peculiar treasure all the earth is my all the people living on the earth i created them but i have pulled you aside to make you a peculiar treasure are we together deuteronomy chapter 14. praise the lord 14 less uh let's read now verse 14 let's chapter 14 let's read verse 1 ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut yourself not make any borders between your eyes for the dead for thou art unholy people unto the lord thy god and the lord have chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself now as you all know above all the nations that are upon the earth as you all know the people traveling in the wilderness moses speaking to them in exeter and telling them how god beared them on eagle wings and god is saying if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant i will make you a peculiar people now here is moses here telling the people that they are peculiar so does that mean that they obey god's voice before god make them a peculiar people we know that israel was stubborn they were rebellious they wanted to go back to egypt they wanted to stone moses to death but how did they achieve being peculiar people now moses here is now telling them you are children of the lord your god so don't cut yourself don't make no uh you know a strange uh uh you know uh thing on your body for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord has chosen thee to be a peculiar people now if god has choosing them then why the moses stole them if you will obey the voice of the lord and keep his covenant you will become a peculiar people praise the lord glory be to god amen that's our god he's peculiar in a way he talks he's peculiar in the things that he does he's peculiar are we together let's take another verse here that that to be chapter 26 that will be chapter 26 of the same the book of deuteronomy now you have to know that these the book of deuteronomy some of the last words of moses before he left the people are we together amen because sometimes when you read the word and you you look into the the law that's the reason why paul the apostle taught us that no man can be justified by the law because the lord was not actually giving uh uh in the sense of a requirement for us to do as well as we study together and see what uh you know what uh the prophet god said the word the lord was actually the expression of god's thoughts amen praise the lord it was the expression of god's thoughts god was expressing his thoughts you have to know that he kept this thought to himself for for as long as he existed now he's expressing these thoughts to the people in one sense he's telling them that these are all the thoughts i have kept of you in my mind now he's giving it to israel in the form of statue and ordinance praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why legalizing can never survive and legalizing teaching and attitude to god's word can never survive because whenever we come to the place to think that we have achieved anything before god by our might you have counted the blood of jesus christ lesser than your natural breath are we together so god expressing his thoughts and telling it's almost like a father telling the child that this was all that i taught that the day that i have a child this i thought of all of this for you i i've been thinking you know and all of these things are in my mind it's not in it's not in a reverse that you you know i had this thought in my mind but then when you do these things then you will become my son no [Music] no praise the lord in god's mind his people were going to be a peculiar people because he's a peculiar god the way nobody understand him you will never understand the people of god you will never understand what it would take to bring a sinner to christ it's now your explanation of the bible is not telling him about the message what god will do to change a man life you will never understand it praise the lord glory be to god amen chapter 26 verse 18. let's move faster now amen it's just 12 15 how much how much meaning i have to preach amen praise the lord you know why i when i preach i like to keep people in suspense i like to keep you in suspense and that's how i gain my time let's read verse verse 18 here and the lord have avoided thee this day to be his peculiar people is it that day that he decided when he said back in in chapter 14 that i have chosen you now so see the three statement of moses is the same man making the three statement in exeter he says the lord has bare you on the eagle wings if you keep the commandments of the lord and obey his voice he will make you a peculiar people he comes down yet and says god has already chosen us to be a peculiar people now here again he's saying this day if i make you a peculiar people praise the lord you better leave the message because moses is contradicting himself here now we can't trust this prophet moses he's contradicting this thing he said in 1953 in 1965 he said this 1960 says he said this so we can't trust moses [Laughter] glory be to god amen all you have to do is just fall in love with jesus the word become sweeter amen praise the lord so that we we see that in the old testament let's go in the new testament titus chapter 2 verse 14 titus chapter 2 verse 14. let's go very quickly we have a few things to cover here this morning praise the lord amen hallelujah you know wednesday night i was trying to catch brother joseph i was just sitting there i said lord where is this brother going and i mean he was just just running like uh all over the place you know i was sitting assis and i was just i said lord what is this brother going you know i said my goodness this guy is just whether you were pulling him or he was running you something was happening and i sure it was wonderful before the lord amen praise the lord titus chapter 2. as we grow together we have the grace to be able to appreciate one another amen tattoos chapter two let's look read from verse 13 looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of the great god and our savior jesus christ amen who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous for good works now what i want you to keep in your mind here is that titus is a gentile amen title is not a jew title is a gentile so seeing the grace that has come unto the gentile titan is processing it in the way that he's saying it praise the lord let's go back and look at that again amen verse 11 he talks about for the grace of god their brains salvation has appeared unto all men what looks like it was hidden before in darkness now he's seeing that this grace has appeared unto all men but i want to do it on verse 14 that's where our thought is who have given himself for us that he might redeem us from our iniquity and purify unto himself purify unto himself brother branham said it this way he said the reason why the lord and the ordinance was given to the jews was to purify a bloodline amen it was to purify a bloodline that's the reason why if a man does something you kill him it was to clean the bloodline because almighty god was going to travel on that bloodline to come in flesh amen so he was going to travel through that bloodline that's the reason why right from genesis 3 15 the seed of the woman amen the seed of the woman was was was prophesied now so you will realize here that uh if you study you will see that uh there there is a place in in history we deal with that i was just i was just looking at that uh i was just looking at that uh the other day we we spoke on that year uh uh right in in in in jaconi you know uh the the promise of of of the redeemer amen because the bible speaks about the seed of david god promised david that he will always have a seed on the throne praise the lord but when it came to that king because he disobeyed the lord all of his sons were going to be slain so how was david going to have a son on the throne so by by slaying all of those sons means that the the the promise to david will have stopped right there because he don't have a son again to be able to produce a sea lion onto so how was god going to do that he had to do it by the virgin birth so that that is the breach the virgin birth breach the the the old testament promise that is the bridge where the virgin breath took the physical sea line into a spiritual sea line because the physical sea lion was being produced by blood one seed onto another one seed onto another amen from from adam came noah and noah through the floor came abraham and abraham became the patriots out of the patriot came david so it was a natural sea lion but when it came to that place a breach a cross from a natural sea lion to a spiritual sea lion it is only through the virgin birth that god will be able to achieve that are we together amen so let's let's continue with this now uh so we see here that uh israel was a peculiar treasure over and over the law said said it unto them they were a peculiar treasure and and and uh this this uh uh uh peculiarness or uh or that they hire with god never came from what they did praise the lord amen god made them a peculiar people to go through the things that they went through because they were designed to be able to produce a bloodline praise the lord that's the reason why a man could not be a priest you have to be of the trap of levi you have to be of the sons of aaron i mean it was just everything by the blood he was keeping that bloodline praise the lord amen now but unto the gentiles the gentiles became peculiar people of a peculiar treasure also unto god why because the gentiles were designed just like titus said here who has given himself for us that he might redeem us from our iniquity and purify unto himself purify unto himself so that gentiles were were were designed that god will produce himself a bride amen the jews were designed that god will become flesh the gentiles were designed that god would produce himself so we right back to genesis 1 26 says when god said let us make man in our image the bible says male and female created hidden so the image of god that was expressed in genesis 1 26 was male and female so god himself now genesis 1 20 says god was creating but this time god is not creating amen praise the lord hallelujah god is becoming he's not creating he became a man and he's becoming a bride [Music] god is becoming amen amen oh my goodness me [Applause] god is becoming you he's becoming you he's becoming that's why you have to take your hands off it you have to take your hands off it because this is god becoming my goodness hallelujah god is becoming just like he created in the beginning amen the bible said he made man in his image praise the lord so he create a body that he could tabernacle in amen but this one he's not creating a body he's becoming from the inside from the sea incorruptible which is the word of god that we have received by faith god is becoming my goodness praise the lord hallelujah that's the reason why god's people are peculiar they are peculiar because he's a peculiar god now brother branham said this that's what we want we want to drop thank you thank you amen hallelujah praise the lord amen spoken word is the original sea brother branham brought this talk to us that's that is where he used this phrase super race and and and and sometimes we follow the letters amen we think that is is some kind of a thing that is f bound or is f associated because we are in the message no no let's look into the super race a little bit amen because you see you have to be careful you have to be careful we are in we are in a world that is very sensitive to racial statement so you have to know what god is expressing you what was the prophet saying now so brother branham's spoken word is the original seed the lord of reproduction brings fault of a kind genesis uh uh uh 111 this last day the this lasting truth church bride comes to the headstone will be this last day true church bride come to the headstone will be the super church a super race praise the lord now there are people that have that have taken this statement and justin did you know it's a statement to make people radical amen behind the curtain of time brother brahm says when he break for there and he saw all of those people coming and and and and he says are the are these branham eyes the angels of the lord told him no these are your convicts the message was never sent to make us branhamite [Music] amen yes amen so uh i want us to follow this closely now brother i'm saying this last day truth church bride this lasted true church bride would come to the headstone will be the super church as super race as the near the great hair stone there will be so much like him even there will be in his very image in order to be united with him his image is not physical appearance this is his image his image is the word it's not physical appearance it's not affluent nationality that we all have to become americans to become this this has to bring all as near the great hairstorm there will be much so much like him even there will be in his very image in the other to be united with him they are one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god and he says denomination outside the message denomination in the message can never produce this there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denomination out of the message and denomination in the message will never produce this [Music] glory be to god amen praise the lord i will i will get out of out of that i'll come back to that again but uh let's uh let's let's let's take a a little tour here and see some few things that the prophet god said lean that on to your own understanding he said now notice the churches of today do the same thing they have formed a great super race of understanding and sometimes we we come to be guilty of that praise the lord amen we have to realize that this prophet of god said i have never changed one thing i have believed he says but over the years i have progressed yes amen that's growth that's the statue of the perfect man if a man is being built in the statue of the peppermint he will grow in his level of understanding yes they have formed a great super race of honesty in their denominational system praise the lord they are people that will see it right in the world they will see you right in the message but that's their doctrine super race of understanding because that's what make them who they are you can preach this message better than the messenger praise the lord are we together oh my god view of super science coach different series different super science series he says everything in this age must be super we used to have the old highway we used to travel now they have got super highways has got to be four or five lanes going one way four five lanes coming the other or you get run over praise the lord you have uh you have to have it cause this is the super age super time everything in it is super we even think we got super people amen some people think they are super they are going to make it in in the bride they're going to be raptured they can live any kind of a life they believe the prophet so they are super they are above the word of god we are super people some some people think they are super and they try to act like that anyhow super race one one race wanting to rule over the other water by race or whether by tribe or whether by church super churches super denomination everything coming to super amen but man says here also he says the one super race he says remember hitler said the german were super race he said scotland taught russia was super race amen and and we know when we go back to the holocaust we know what happened amen history tells us what happened is is strange that we don't learn from history praise the lord it's a strange thing that we don't learn from history glory be to god you see the same thing going on there in in europe and the whole world is sitting down watching television amen what is assad think england said as long as there's a word there will be an england super race america think they are the super race they got their intelligence in everything that's all we need so we are the super race now so you see as brother branham brings this thought as he brings this thought you realize the other his statement in in spoken word is the original seed was not an ethnic group he was not talking about a super race into says that you know we are building something you know uh uh uh that that uh that that is built by man i mean like uh i mean uh like like the latter day this and does you know the the they just think that uh that entire movement uh you know this there's a special race of people you know that that uh that god called in that movement from joseph smith in in in and and in the way they try to do it you have to wear your white shirt and your black tie your black trousers i mean you got to get a special dress code to be part of that praise the lord barbara goes on with the same line of thought hitler tried to make a super race he said pharaoh tried to make a super race as two in egypt to try to and you see that's that is the top that is that is in the minds of more detectors around the world praise the lord and they use there to destroy their people why they try to use that very same thought to enslave the other people that is around them the throne where pharaoh said you can dig 20 feet beneath the earth to find their throne i have stood in rome where caesar and can't even find a place unless you dig way down praise the lord so he's bringing the talk that all of these men that have tried to bail one group of people when the bible says by one blood god made all men every man that have tried to set one group of people aside to make them a super race over the rest of humanity has all come to arches praise the lord amen so if we follow that line of talk we will understand that brother branham was not doing nothing naturally that the people that come and believe the message baptized in jesus name believe william branham is a prophet now you are a super race no that's not what he was saying praise the lord that's not what he was saying now as as we stated along we go ahead you will realize that brother branham was he was uh i'll read that to you he was he was dwelling on the same thought of god's peculiar people because god's people are peculiar and god has made a promise that he will have a people he will have a bride no matter what the world becomes no matter how cold the church becomes no matter how dead the people becomes how how much they fill the internet with everything against the message and the messenger god has sealed his own life that he will have a people without spot or wrinkle amen praise the lord the talk behind it is that the way that you will overcome this age it will have to be a super grace that will give you super faith and we'll produce a super result even if you don't believe it but because god has said it that is the thought that is behind it [Music] praise the lord hallelujah oh you can look at all of your struggle and the thing your body goes through you know you associate it with your past and it haunts you all the time how am i going to get over this but if god have said you are going to be your bride amen praise the lord all you have to do just look to see your name in the land book of life how god will make you to overcome it it's going to be a release brother branham called it a supreme fate in the supreme hour that's the thought he was carrying he was not starting a cut or a movement well we just become supreme i mean we become super race because you know we we're having the pillow of fire picture in our home you know so it makes us that's the way we become super race praise the lord it's appreciating what god has done in our age amen it's appreciating it but we're not using it as a ticket lord i have your prophet picture it's not a ticket glory be to god glory be to god verbum says another uh a super saiyan series he says they tell me they got a soup they got a television a television cast they called superman and then when i when i read that i went back in and realized that superman was published april 18 1938 praise the lord so way back amen and there are many men that have played superman to die and another person played superman again all the supermen ain't dying or they get old praise the lord but i'm telling you this super race i'm talking about death is not our portion [Laughter] amen glory be to god hallelujah amen we're just trying to lay some some foundation down yet amen praise the lord if if i left for five minutes i would stay try to nail everything in five minutes i don't know how i'm going to do it praise the lord so you see you go back and and and you realize that brother branham did not stand alone in this line of thought let's look at the apostle paul praise the lord [Music] there are few scriptures i want for us to look at quickly first timothy chapter 1 verse 14 praise the lord first timothy 1 14 they are speaking about grace exceeding and abundant grace exceeding he says and the grace of our lord was exceedingly abundant abundant with faith now if you if you study that you realize that it comes from a greek prefix because what you have to understand that the new testament was originally written in the greek yes praise the lord and whenever you have translation sometimes it losses amen i was talking with a young brother and we were driving and he asked me he says he says he says brother one i was reading the scripture and the bible said jesus says i will send you another comforter amen so i asked him what what do you think about that he says it sounds like to me there is one comforter and there is another comforter because jesus says i will send you another comforter praise lord and and and and that is the way you might understand it when you take it in the english land of talk you can only have another when you already have one praise the lord but you see jesus is trying to bring express his thoughts to his disciple i will never leave you comfortless i will be with you amen that's what he's trying to tell them another comforter means i will send you the comforter it's another way that i will be with you amen amen amen the comforter is another way it's another manifestation of myself so you see just like uh uh uh paul is saying here and uh this this uh uh uh uh exceeding abundant if you look at it in a great preface it means hopper super it carried a sense of super so this grace that is coming on to you is a super grace that we that were that that that it looks like we were never counted in the economy of god amen that grace has come to us grace has come to us so much that we understand the ordinance that the jews had more than they did because they are holding to the literal the literal uh uh uh ordinance and stature but grace has come to you and myself that we know that everything that was given to them everything that was given to them do you realize that in the in in the old testament uh uh uh uh do you realize that blood represent savor that's where the thought saver represents redemption that's where the thought is from everything in the old testament tabernacle was sitting in a silver plate everything the altar rested on a silver plate the basin rested on a silver plate so everything they had in the tabernacle was speaking of blood everything everything they had in the old testament tabernacle was pointing to the to the crucification of our lord jesus even in the old testament tabernacle they had their redemption money their redemption money was a silver queen now every first bomb belongs to the lord but if a man never wanted his son to be given to the tabernacle he takes the redemption queen and then he comes and gave it to the priests in the change of his son everything that was used in the tabernacle rested on blood that's what moses said he said i mean uh paul said in hebrew he said all the instruments the priests will dip the house up in the blood and spring it on all the instrument that there is there is there will not be one thing in the tabernacle that would go without blood now can you imagine that all of those uh high priests people that have to wash their skin and make sure no no kind of a strange they gotta take back they got to dress a certain way look at their clothes those things only everything in the way that they were trying to to live out the holiness the sacredness of god but they were holding all of those things without even understanding without even understanding that's the reason why the jews cannot bring worship to god even now even now why because they don't have a temple they cannot make sacrifice until the temple is rebuilt and they can get a rare huffle back into the temple that's the reason why that war is called the willing wall they go there and cry they go to the ward and he stands there and say the god of abraham asking jacob oh the god of abraham isaac and jacob it's a willing war they just go and cry to god they cannot bring worship to god then you have a bunch of gentiles that you appreciate the grace of god want to become jews they want to become jews to become children of abraham when when the royal seed has come through the blood of jesus christ that was sacrificed for you and myself lord be to god hallelujah are we together now so paul here is speaking about a super grace and a seeding abundant grace that have come to you and myself that's the reason why don't don't don't don't don't play with the grace of god don't play with it if you have ever experienced what the grace of god is let's take another verse here and see and see the same expression in your second testimony one three second testimony and one 1-3 now i'm trying to show you that the very same thing that bro brandon preach poor also had the same taught praise the lord when brother brown said he preached whop what paul preached they didn't use the same language he did not call that paul over and over but the holy spirit is driving the same thought home second testimony in verse chapter 1 verse three you see paul used the same thing we are about we we are bound to thank god always for you brethren ask it is me because that your faith groweth exceedingly so you are growing onto a super faith amen you are growing onto a super faith you are growing to the faith that in your heart to walk with god your faith is not only captured in material things money and housing and things around you you are growing into a super faith now whether you have it or not you still believe god you believe that god is in control your faith does not depend on what you have this is this is not a casino that's why you're telling them you are growing we have to thank god for you because we see you grow into a super fight and he's telling the church he's telling the testimonial church at that time because the church was going through persecution that's when your faith comes it's not when you have everything the church was going through persecution the thessalonica church was being persecuted and paul is telling him we can see that you are growing to super fate that even though they are imprisoning you but you are not backing down you are still calling to what you believe that's what we're talking about that's what the super race would do now people that would try to find a way out when bethlehem talks about a super race that's what that super race will do and people that will trust god even when when they they don't trust god just to look for an answer they trust god because they believe god exists [Music] just to have an answer hallelujah amen that's what he's talking about that is the characteristics of the super race now your ego bill barker let's take another one here uh ephesians chapter one ephesians 119 four should should be enough for us we'll take that one and we take one more praise the lord and we get back to the prophet yeah i'll try to close here soon amen ephesians 119 brother paul says here he says and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us wall amen praise the lord i think uh when i read this i wanted to drop back a little bit so let me get there and uh and see praise the lord just want to draw back a little bit there so it's efficient one glory be to god okay let's let's read from from verse 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom in revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints mayan man that's that just that just such an expression it is enough for us to spend the rest of the year on this subject amen don't even try me and i can i can still write on this verse praise the lord amen paul is talking here you know that uh that uh uh that that we and may give you uh the spirit of wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of him praise the lord the revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding might be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling praise the lord if god have called you there is hope in his calling praise the lord he have caught us for a purpose everything can be falling apart around you you can hold to that hope paul speaks of the same thing there in romans he says abraham against hope he believed in hope when he looks like everything was became becoming hopeless he was still hopeful that the god that have caught him is more than able to produce a son when everything was becoming hopeless he's becoming old sarah is i i i mentioned she she had passed out that the age everything was becoming hopeless but he never lost hope praise the lord he never lost hope against hope he believed in hope you see so you have to study that scripture that's where you will see where brother branham met when he said he he speaks of hope is the enemy to faith but there is a hope that is also a support to faith so you got to release one and hold to one oh my goodness praise the lord let's just stay right here let's stay right here this is the place we want to be amen and what is the exceeding greatness of his power so yeah he's speaking about a superpower he's telling the church telling the efficient church that in your calling the hope of your calling the glory of the inheritance what god invested to have you here what the god of heaven and earth invested to have you here to have you in this age the lord my goodness he deplored angels to make sure that nothing will happen to you you will be here this morning to hear me in was there was spiritual warfare in the heavens and i can tell you it was bloody demons hell were rolling the investment that god invested in you to have you in the laodicea age to have you in an age like this to believe him [Music] it's not your church membership it's the inheritance of the father is is god's investment praise the lord the glory of his in inheritance in in in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power so yeah paul is also talking about a superpower the exceeding greatness of his power to us war that's what brother branham said if you want to know where the mises are flying he says see how the church is praying he said god has placed the greatest where you want to talk about superpower this bride is a superpower because here we yeah we are on earth praise the lord hallelujah but heaven is behind us praise the lord heaven back our action glory be to god so yeah paul is talking about a superpower an exceeding great power to us word my goodness i know the devil is not happy this morning because just ignoring this that there is a superpower to me means that no devil can play with me no devil in here [Music] amen praise the lord they can only stay across the fence and be throwing things they can't come near they can stay over the fence and be throwing things because they can they can sense and and i mean if if you are in contact you can sense the presence that is around you [Music] let's take the last one that's romans chapter eight it's a familiar one that we know eight verse thirty we are more than conquerors that word more also goes with the same because you are not a conqueror you are not a conqueror but you are more than a conqueror you are not a conqueror because you don't have to fight amen it's the ones that fight that conquest but you are not a conqueror your position [Laughter] your position is for you to rejoice in the victory your position is for you to benefit from what has been conquered [Music] so don't complain to me don't complain to me because you are more than a conqueror you have super power backing you up you are growing in a super faith then what are we crying about this church must be on our toes praise the lord we must be exercising our muscle and speaking and believing that god will bring it to pass [Applause] see why brother branham share let's find this thing amen oh my god speak speak to this mountain brother branham says talking he says he says talking on vision that's that's not what i want to go to but let's start with this he says talking talking about vision i told him he was he was talking about brother ben uh brother ben rules and his wife he says i told them what happened now like it it has to have something the only thing i know if it ever happened like that it will be a faith that god will have to give me because when that anointing comes on me just seem like a super faith praise the lord i said i said rises up in me that fit rises up in me some think that there's not a shadow of doubt it's not a guesswork it's not a guesswork not a shadow of that i said oh how i trust just like i have been having visions when the lord will tell me in a vision go do accepting thing why mine there there will be no question in my mind you see that's the reason why god even had to rebuild brother branham why why why why cry unto me you know uh uh as i was with moses that's what he said god had to rebuke him because he has lived this way very long to rely on vision because he knew that those visions never fail amen but god wanted him to step beyond vision that's the same way god wants you to step in the word beyond what the pastor says you have to step in the word be a son of god be a daughter of god take position for the word amen there will be no question in my mind just go do it never fail so it just got to happen so you have got to believe that what you are doing you got to have faith and confidence the burning gila let's take this one praise the lord are we together is there are there super racists in the house this morning praise the lord it's not the color of your skin amen it's not your troubled background it has nothing to do with your bloodline is have to do with what god is doing in your life he says the one thing we have to move up till now listen to that now the one thing we have to move up to now is a supreme faith is the same as super faith it's a supreme faith and see how simple he said it one thing we have to move up to now it's a supreme faith to what we have had you cannot have faith until you know perfectly what you are doing it's not it's not in the moment of what you are doing it's in every aspect of your life you have to know what you are doing in every aspect of your life it's not only when you want to pray for the sake you got to know what you are doing no you have to know what you are doing in every aspect of your life because this thing is going to be a nature that's right well i i don't know if i want this job or i i think the other job better pay i don't know if i if if if i if i was to live here i mean you have to know what you are doing can continue living your life in uncertainty a weakened fate when you are not setting a weakened fate you can never have faith until you know perfectly what you are doing and if you don't know then just keep just shut up and stay before god say lord what will you have me do it's not you come you come you say this today it says and then tomorrow you come you say this other one today or you know i have another interview that's the best you know those people they're offering me better you know better of wages so you are just chasing the almighty dollar you are chasing the almighty but the almighty god wants you to know what you are doing because you have to believe god in whatever situation you are in okay let's go on with this he says you can you you cannot have that faith that supreme faith until you know perfectly what you are doing well i'm going home see how he says this now i'm going home i'm going out and start the car that's all the out of faith now brother branham says it's just like this service open i mean service end and you get out there you don't look at your tires and say let me see is there enough air you don't sit in the car and shake let me see i don't know if i can trust this week praise the lord subconsciously you step in a car you expect it to start you expect it to start subconsciously praise the lord you don't say you're away from me you're staying inside let me go try that car and see if it will start before you come you're staying there i don't want to disgrace our family so you're just staying you expect it to start he said that is all the acts of faith it is subconsciously in you and that is that is the act of faith he said we we must be moving up to where when you come to church you expect to be blessed [Applause] you don't look for who living sons you don't know for will preaching tonight i just expect to be blessed [Applause] i expect god to speak to me you don't have to find out whether i'm the one preaching or who preaching he said that's all the acts of faith because you have you have just done it so much because because it's a regular routine with you opening your car getting inside starting it's a regular praise routine lord amen it's a regular routine now you see that's where people abuse this thought sometimes and think that all because we come to service wednesday and sunday is a regular routine why it's part of our nature we it's wednesday i know it's wednesday it's church time so sometimes we try to breathe in our mind we need to step over that no no no no let me let me tell you something let me tell you something if you don't realize that do you know there are some people that has that regular routine in them that if they miss a service they feel sick they just feel sick they feel lost because they know at that time they're supposed to be gathering in the body do you realize that praise the lord because they have done it a regular routine and sometimes we we we we try to manufacture things so we think we have to make it different no we're just stepping up we're just walking praise the lord when eno was walking with god it was a regular routine for him to go out every evening and take a walk with god he didn't say i've been doing this thing all my life now i have to do it another way okay i'm going to walk backwards maybe i need to go sideways it's just all you are just trying to manufacture something just do what you are doing do it right make sure you are doing it from your heart love what you are doing love it [Applause] love it you don't have to make something extraordinary praise the lord oh we have to make the revival i mean we just wednesday sunday wednesday let's make it thursday friday let's let's add something to it because we got to push this thing you are just pumping up the boat you are just pumping it up it's just all humor effort just love what you are doing praise the lord you don't have you don't have different ways to start your car you know how you start your car if you use remote it's remote you use you get so used to it that you just press it and it starts you don't say well i've been starting my car with remote too much i have to push it let's push in a jump in i gotta try another way maybe the engine will work better you know how you must know how to jump don't be like as that car will run over you but that's what i'm that's what brother branham is saying here amen he said it's going to be like a routine a routine it it's just part of your life to wake up in the morning take your bible and read it's just part of your life you're not impressing anybody you just love it it's part of your daily routine get on your knees to pray as part of your daily routine you don't have to write it on the calendar i gotta wake up seven o'clock in the morning and pray i gotta set an alarm to remind me as we are stepping up to that supreme fate is going to be the things we love to do the things we enjoy to do praise the lord when i'm when i'm getting ready for service i don't think about who are going to be in church wednesday night i don't know april 1 is going to be there when he's i think he's going to be there so i'm going to preach this i don't think who's going to be there amen praise the lord you know i've had the grace to preach to the least crowd one person amen yeah so i mean i mean i've started that where the numbers start from 1. you know so cry don't intimidate me let's let's move with this stuff so we can find a place to close here he says you're going home and you go out and you start your car that's all the acts of faith tomorrow i will meet you at a setting place that's all the act of faith because you have just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you that's the way the things of god are that's the way the things of god are when people try to make it over special there must be no difference between wednesday night service and sunday morning service amen there is nothing that mess on the divine and wednesday is not divine praise the lord even if a person is not able to make it a church and they are home the same sacredness the same reverence and it must be there this thing must not be able to cut your reverence to the word it must not change your attitude praise the lord i mean not not not following service in pyjamas and and drinking coffee and eating sandwiches preach brother preach that was a good one you're saying glory to that sandwich because it's a routine that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do it so much so many times till it become just a regular routine you have trusted god when you leave in your house to watch over you you have trusted god that you will go out and come back it has become a regular routine you have trusted god he has brought you out of difficult trouble there is not one that is now that he will not bring you out of complaining only weakens fate you're just weakening brother branham said unbelievable only handle the unbeliever it will never stop god from what he's doing it's not because it's not happening in your life it means that it's not happening and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way because it will be a regular routine it will be a regular routine whatever you will be doing you will be doing it you will not have to wear a suit and necktie the rapture morning praise the lord whatever you will be doing you will be doing it praise the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it will just be a regular routine of following the scripture and the plan of god you got to underline that your regular routine should be following the scripture in the plan of god making sure that whatever we are doing is by the word if i'm spending time with my family i'm doing it by the word because that's my family amen if we having family time it's by the word i must not feel condemned because i'm spending time with my family if i'm playing with my kids on the ground and loving them and i mean i'm doing what the father is supposed to do how can i feel bad and says oh my goodness that's how can you be on the ground like this you better get up you know you are a minister you got to be classic all those kind of a makeup it's a regular routine it flows through your life it flows through your life you know what you are doing every moment of your day you're not just wasting time away i don't even know what i'm doing really really this time we are living you don't know what you're doing praise the lord i have to close this right here i might pick that up on wednesday night musicians you can come uh um play that uh let's let's play that again from the secret place [Music] uh [Music] from the secret place god's breaking a super race those who i've seen hello face to face the calf soul has come crying grace breaks praise we are heading away heading in christ in a secret place let's just worship the lord in the secrets [Music]

we are heading away we are heading in christ in a secret place one more time now in the secret place those who have saved this great revelation face to face all the casting has come down crying grace praise grace we are heading away heading away in the secret place brother branham said we are moving up to that and i have no doubt in my mind that the bride is moving up to death it might be a very simple way in your life it might be the very menu thing that god is doing taking you from carelessness to paying attention helping you in your prayer life [Music] helping you in your personal devotion no matter what it is i believe the bride is moving to that place of supreme faith you have to just think this morning if you can just take a pause in your mind and just look for what the lord has stepped you up this week something that he did something that he did it can be the simplest thing something that god did that make you to trust him the most it don't have to be a miracle he's doing these things in our inner routine of our life because we do it over and over and over we don't seem to pay attention we are looking for a blast that will come from heaven but god is working in our daily routine when we wake up in the morning all the things that we do brush our teeth take a shower sometimes you are brushing your teeth and the thought comes to your mind and god will remind you about something sometimes you are right under the shower a flash of thought would come to your mind a scripture that you were reading or something that you listened to from the prophet or in the service god is in the routine of our lives that's why we have to pay attention in the simplest thing of our life you could be having breakfast you could buy your hairs to pray you are just praying over the meal and you say lord just remember those that don't even have food to eat just do a simpliest thing it's very simple he's right in the daily routine of your life the rapture is in the routine of your life you have to pay attention to those things people you have to pay attention the lord is allowing things to happen around your family it looks like you and your wife is getting on a better term it looks like you are talking with your children it looks like laughter is coming in the home it looks like something is happening god look at the day of creation every day god say it was good so you're making the super bright oh yes laws those who can see their names this revelation has come crying to your heart grace faith lord almighty god we are just lifting our house to you father you are the god that work in simplicity oh god how we have created big expectations in our mind but yet you are using the simplest thing your prophet said in the message god that is reaching mercy he said you are interested in the least things that concern us you have so much interest in it father oh god oh god lord take us away from vain imagination lord may we come to the reality father now lord you are in the routine of our lives you are in a daily routine of our lives so god when we go to work when we go to school when we are with a friend you are trying to find a way to express yourself oh almighty god i pray father you will help each and every one of us lord to realize oh god the rapture is going to be that way enoch was taken away just like that elijah was taken away in the routine of
