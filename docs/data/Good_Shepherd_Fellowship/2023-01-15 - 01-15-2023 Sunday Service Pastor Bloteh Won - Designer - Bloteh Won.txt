for our prayer meeting we read from Saint John chapter nine let's just go back there it's in John chapter 9. I know I'm still in my series of uh righteousness I'm going to get to it if there is time time is a little bit far spent this morning but if there is time on Wednesday night we talk a little bit about about design God's design I want to just share something with you and then if there is time then we will preach praise the Lord but just for the scripture reading Saint John chapter 9 and as Jesus passed back he saw a man which was blind from his birth he was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him Jesus disciple asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither have this main sin known his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the works The Works of him that sent me why it is day the night cometh when no man work let's pray father we want to thank you again Lord and we just pray that you will bless the word bless the rest of the service Lord father we want to just move in this direction and then we can get to our subject if there is time but we just ask your blessing upon this in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat I see uh visitors there sitting by Brother Stephen bird God bless you praise the Lord good to have you visiting with us and and you are you are always welcome praise the Lord amen and uh brain greetings from the meaning that we spoke with during the week I was I was talking with a brother and he says you know people give their greetings and you can and sometimes you are not able to tell that you promised that you will greet the church and you and you can do it I say well that is now of uh of a direct intent but just like I said we want to we want to I want to share something with you uh this morning after the service even though the Wednesday service was was actually uh a prayer meeting and and then we read this in John chapter 9 we spoke a little bit there on on on God's design and uh we see the disciples here trying to attribute this man uh [Music] sickness being born blind to to sin they are actually trying to trace it back to the the scene in Genesis uh in the beginning but then that Jesus he he actually spoke about it in another way for us to be able to appreciate the different things that we go through for us to be able to appreciate the different things that we go through to realize that there is a great intelligence there's a great intelligence behind Our Lives praise the Lord amen there you there cannot be uh a design without a designer whenever you have anything that makes sense there is an intelligence behind it praise the Lord there is an intelligence behind it so for for for men uh you know the the eight years and the unbelievers that love you know a setting weather the love you know uh the mountains the love uh you cannot appreciate those things except there is a design amen and for you to appreciate the design you must also realize there's a designer that is behind every design praise the Lord amen I think if you take the time to look at the tag on the clothes you are wearing maybe your designer that that face their clothes name might be on it praise the Lord and then if you made it yourself just write your name on it you are the designer praise the Lord amen so in looking at that you know I went home and and the thought was on my mind I kept thinking about it and uh so I thought I said well okay we will I will I will try to pull out something here for us to for us to look into so this morning I'm uh I'm going to take um I'm going to take the bird I'm going to take the bird and the reason why I'm going to take the bird is because from the way that the bird is designed comes our flight comes our aircraft and note of that for man to be able to build uh the plane and set it up in the air for it to be able to fly hundreds of miles and now we have even gone to the astronaut of age is because men India India intelligence try to study the bird they try to steady the bird what keeps the bird in the air or keep the bird in the way that it is praise the Lord now so uh that's a little bit of that that we want to look at but before I do that let me take something here from the message shalom just to start off praise the Lord and I was looking forward to see here okay I would I think attack people they are trying to lower my images I hope I can okay let's take let's take the this this thought here from shalom every word that he promised will be Vindicated everyone if he's able to do it today after promising a 2 000 years ago if it's a hundred thousand years from today Jesus will return to the Earth in a visible body for a church a redeemed a bride to take her out of here regardless of what comes goals faction can go on and people can wait into a total darkness and believe anything they want to believe but Jesus Christ will return again why because every word of God will be Vindicated amen if God says so it's going to happen I trust the future to him then Lord God I don't know what tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow his word is just like a great Symphony amen how many of you ever heard is something well everybody has some of us now remember and symphony is winning music is played in a drama now you will see why I'm going this way because there is one particular uh uh bird that has a plate in the symphony and uh I think I have it right pitted in the wolf you remember there the whole story I have heard that how they take the drum and make the little woodpecker picking and Peter's going out and a glowing the wolf and and taught in their homes aside from the nail if you don't understand a symphony it's a big bunch of Rocket to you if you don't understand it if you I mean you have got to understand what it is and it's all done by signs emotion but it's an art but it's out out a drama in a cell phone and now we know this the only one that understand the sound funny is the composer and those who are interested in knowing praise the Lord amen those who are interested in knowing nose is changes knows what take place the composer knows every move from the end to the beginning from the beginning to the end that you know there the one who wrote it up he composed this he knows every little Junction if he knows every Junction so does the director have to do to direct it amen and the composer of our life is almighty God the director is the Holy Spirit sons of God are led by the Holy Spirit amen so uh okay are you ready uh but I'm I'm not seeing it on my end brother Johnny I mean brother Jordan oh let me see um is that from your end or my end okay just can you switch this picture I mean this light of okay I can just tell you which uh picture to throw up there so we we are saying the other we want to look at the design of a flight and how uh uh signs were able to study um of the bird the nature of the bird for them to be so successful in coming up with all of these superflys that we enjoy flying but then if you look at the bird in itself the bird is light Wisconsin and uh in the way that the bird is designed the birds have to lay eggs to keep its lightweight to fly praise the Lord if the bird was carrying her children like every other children or every other animal it would be too heavy so in a way that almighty God designed the bird she's designed to leg ass and uh uh I have my picture so scattered that uh let's move to the the physiologic of the bird it has a fast metabolism the bird's body temperature it keeps such a temperature more higher than the temperature we keep the birds have open ends on the two sides of his lungs for it to be able to breathe and it briefs 400 for 450 births a meaning while we do 30. a meaning it has a long height for attitude I'll run through this very fast to just get to where I want to get to um okay then you can let's look at the beach choose the peaks of the birds the birds have different beaks the I actually use this this one is uh the bakes for those birds like Castro Eagles the ones that can tear flesh apart and this beak is for birds like flamingo and they are able to feel for things you know the the big has a filtering system they can go there and filter things through their mouth while they eat and uh uh this sharp one is uh for the Cuda those ones that can be able to get worms they're able to take things off the show dig in the earth and be able to get food to eat this one is our parents and uh cocktails and all of that is for is for the ones that that are able to break nuts you know be able to break nuts and these are all God's design and girls designed them for a purpose praise the Lord let's look at the feathers the feathers and their feet verse all of these birds they have different feet and for different reasons and they also have different feathers Loki are the feet and the feathers will make us to look at one of our one of the birds we want to look at is the woodpecker you know birdram talks about a woodpecker in that message and how uh Peter and a wolf sound funny is made with the sound of the Woodpecker like the Wood Pecker picking so let's look at the Woodpecker for a while yeah it has a strong beak it has a very strong beak and it says that the woodpecker is is one of the birds that have one of the most strongest big because of what it does but then in picking on the world that bird has to close his eyes and it's uh because if it done your eyes will fall out because of the way it Peaks and it has a spectral cartridge that that support the weight is almost like your shock absorbed on your vehicle so when it hitting that wood it has you know a special country there that that holds the you know the yeah and then it also it also goes home without an headache praise the Lord is built to be able to support the you know uh their their hating and breaking into the wood into the trade and uh that it goes home without a headache like every other birds they have three toes in front and one behind the Woodpecker have two in front and two behind and uh the the tail feather is also used for it to be able to get his grip that when it's it's kneeling is kneeling praise the Lord and all of that is God's design this never came from a Big Bang Theory this came from an intelligence praise the Lord and uh the the Woodpecker has a tongue that is longer than the beak because after it has picked into the wood it used his tongue to go in and get whatever it want to get from in the tree and so it has a tongue that is longer than the big praise the Lord it says that the European green wood uh pecker tongue is down the throat it's out the back of the neck around the back of the the skull uh beneath the skin and over the top uh between their eyes and determine it just below the eye socket and another thing there with the birds let's look at the migration we soon close on this the migration of birds is still a mystery how birds travel how they migrate is still a mystery praise the Lord it holds a mystery of how we will get out of here the way birds travel stay a mystery and there is one bird there is one bird that uh we will take account of is called the galling Clover it's a Siberian clover this bird it's a small bird like death small duck bird but this bird or birds can travel generally about uh 25 000 mice from birth to their destination after a bird you know has been let out of the net you know when uh when the mother you know shattered the nerd as smart as they are they can be able to get in the comfort when birds are migrating they can go as far as 25 000 mice but this bird that we are talking about um if you scroll down I have a picture of it it's a small black bird okay right there this bird it says to be it has a it has a special flight route it leads from Alaska to uh why it goes and a travel with no rest stop when he's on his Journey praise the Lord normally it waits 130 grams and it can flap its wings on that trip quarter of a million wins flop it travels to be able to leave from Alaska and get to Ohio is a travel uh 88 hours 88 hours traveling with no rest stop so which means it has to take in enough deal if you if you want to think it in in a line of flight it has to build itself up so what it does is the other uh it increases its weight is normally 830 grams it adds about 70 grain to its weight just to be able to sustain it for it to go but then they say is that wave the the traveling of of the bird the bird has to use a setting flying formation to be able to achieve that or as they will crash after 75 hours so the birds that's the reason why the fly information and what they do is that that is that is one of the place that just that that you know that just struck me in this as the birds travel in formation they can trace parts amen and that's what sustained him because is is the lead that those a lot of the flapping while the others set their wings and turn like this and turn like this so they got to change their formation and somewhere else take the lead to do the flopping while the other rest and they just go like this and go like this that's why birds travel information praise the Lord and uh and when you just you just think about this I mean there are just a lot of there but uh uh I mean this this is uh enough for our presentation this morning but if you just think about it thy God in his you know in his Sovereign mind will be able to design those creatures and they can travel uh you know the different places in the changes of weather and not of that with their youngs and you know they can migrate in their way if you just think about it you'll realize that that is just like us amen that is just like us we cannot make it alone we cannot make it alone that's why we we we have to have Fellowship the scripture says do not forsake the assembling of the sins when it's necessary amen it is because that as we as we gather as we come into the building and We Gather here then we and we take our formation the the musician come for the song leader come for the technicians are back there and you know we take our different uh positions the worshiper sits down we prayed and all of that in their formation every one of us is just like uh uh the the drafting of houses or hearses and all the drafting of race car in that formation every one of us we bring a little special gift that God has given us that brings energy to the body praise the Lord amen and you see in as much as with with time and uh and and and different ones work schedule and the different things that happen around our life uh the Lord has blessed us with an age where we can be able to stream service from home and all of those things but what is happening there is there there if you are not exercising your gift you are defrauding the body okay so it is it is in a place like uh uh you know uh I mean uh [Music] even even the the very special way that sometimes setting people respond to the word amen just that little there are little expression when the word means something to you and you say Amen oh you said that's right it brings some energy that's why we are not crushing in our flight praise the Lord is gross design it's God's design the word minister to us it reaches Us in different areas a quick seven things to you in a different way are we together and it's it's it's all of those things that's that's what I've always believed that the scripture called the beauty of holiness if it's all of those things that that comes together that gave strength to our traveling amen so you see the uh whatever we can do unless is is far beyond you know us by weather or the uh certain situation it is always a blessing together together amen because a single bird a single Siberian clover will never be able to make that Journey birds do not migrate alone because the use their their formation to be able to sustain themselves as they travel praise the Lord who tell them when to go amen what is the GPS they are using which Highway do they travel on how do they tell that storm is not coming their way there is an intelligence that guide him praise the Lord amen so let's read this also from a true sign overlook but look you are spending your life trying to find something on a creation when I was just having a conversation here with a doctor when he made that statement you know he was talking to the doctor and appreciating the doctor for the the ways Medical Science have advanced and all the things that they are doing you know and what a blessing but then he's also trying to make him to realize this you're spending your time of your life trying to find something on a creation but why not sometimes think who created it who made it amen who's the designer of eight God is the designer of it how much greater is the creator than the creation that he have made why do we put so much emphasis on the creation when we don't think about the Creator who made the Heaven and the Earth and made the body and life and can destroy it anytime he desires because it's his and no one can ask him a question this become a very wonderful thing to work on the human body we appreciate that they can transfer an eye from one man to another they take those tiny little calls and and uh and and take an eye out of a man's socket and place it over in another man's socket and that man can see from that eye that is a wonderful thing you stop up a valve out here we have a gas something right down there think about stopping the valve and you know Broadband also talk about you know uh stop about out here somewhere of this water system in the in the city and watch what happened at the main valve it will blow it out but yet you can cut a legs of amputate and arm and Bob the miracle of God he will bypass their blood some other way the second uh some other way the second time in raw and and rush it around some other way to save the life of the person praise the Lord you think about just getting a cut on your hand and you are bleeding you know and uh you you try to stop the blade and when the blades stop you realize that that's what blood Brown is saying here by the miracle of God uh whatever tissue that is called the blood bypassed that is not constantly bleeding because if you are just constantly bleeding you will bleed to death if God did not create it a way there are those cells or vessels who create a bypass just to keep our life the moment you get caught you will bleed till you die but what tells the blood not to go through that wound but but to start to find another Channel to Keep Us Alive what tells their blood praise the Lord and science can do well bypass surgery and all of that caught off on an archery cut off the main line out here somewhere in the water when when it's pumping from a valve what would it do try it once and find what happened there is no other way to bypass it it has to blow back to the valve if God didn't make a way for this Blood to bypass itself instantly one back up to the heart and you are dead every time you struck your finger it was deaf instantly every time you cut something or somewhere that opened up an orchard or something it will be deaf instantly praise the Lord that's all they will blow right back to your heart again and it will kill you now we we think it's wonderful it is wonderful and we appreciate how science they can tie those archers and keep them from bleeding that's all fine but who was the one who designed that see we look over the creation and forget the creator of it let's take another one here he's a designer of his word the designer of his word the man who created heaven and earth designed his church praise the Lord does he know more about what it takes for the rapture or does the church know more about what it takes he's the designer he knows what it takes he's well dressed in the power and the resurrection he's walking among us today in the power of his resurrection he knows what it takes to put a church and set it in other he designed it he put the past together here in the Bible so it does not take all our you know Bongo games and and and and all the things that we can create you know no God God already designed it praise the Lord before we got here the word was already here if he promised a Rapture he has already designed how he's going to get us out of here if he promised our healing he has already designed how to bring healing to our body praise the Lord he promised our deliverance man can have all their seven steps to getting out of addiction 12 steps and 10 steps and every time they get to the last step they fall right back down to start the steps over the game praise the Lord just let the current flow through it now watch it operates let's let faith in the promised word of today flow through it you will see how it operates amen let the word just flow in the beginning the spirit of God move and as the spirit of God move over the Earth the creation came to be let's fate just flow through the body let the people receive the word let the people believe the words the word has the power to change us left Faith in the promised word of today flow truth you will see how it operates he designed the thing he designed his church by the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God amen in the midst of Darkness who's going to bring the little bra out who knows about it who can save us from the chaos that we are in praise the Lord I mean the time that we live in him and the things that is happening around us but God have it all under control praise the Lord he have it all under control blessed be the name of the Lord so you see the uh uh Jesus right there said neither this man father neither his mother you know the design that he has he was designed this way to be bomb blind to this age to this time for the work of God to be May manifest praise the Lord amen whatever we are dealing with is because there's a work of God that need to be made manifest in our life there's a work of God that needs to be made manifest in our situation as much as you cannot blame it or his mother you cannot blend it to uh uh uh uh that man and and even yeah you think about it think about it Jesus never even say is the devil he said no but this man was kept like this for the work of God to be me manifest he never even said it's the devil you know and in our religious mind we will bring out all the court is the devil Genesis chapter 3 he deceived it that was sin begins praise the Lord but you see that I I choose to just go this route there a little bit because uh uh uh uh it helps to bring up that picture for us to be able to appreciate what God is doing in our lives amen there's a great intelligence behind our life praise the Lord Hallelujah there's a great intelligence the one that have that have that have designed us and and uh for us to be born in the family we were born the Nations we were born and and his grace can bring us together into a little body like this there's a great intelligence behind it praise the Lord and that's why we want to appreciate that's why we want to appreciate amen he have a purpose for everything our life is going through if we can just only keep the subject matter that the work of God who Bill May manifest praise the Lord amen Satan you are doing everything that you are doing so the work of God can be made manifest Hallelujah amen you are doing everything that you are called to do so the work of God will be made manifest praise the Lord Hallelujah so I pray that that the lord gave us Grace to be able to to appreciate as we go through different things in our lives and uh let's be grateful amen let's be grateful we are met our life is not controlled by uh you know but uh by a Big Bang Theory they say almighty God they are they have brought us here amen and that God is in control praise the Lord he's in control now we were traveling with this thought uh speaking on our subject here she's more righteous than I we were dwelling on that from the the beginning of the year where we we we started to talk about Jesus speaking on uh I just want to take one place here to the to the disciples that accept our righteousness as seed the righteousness of the stripe and the Pharisees so we were looking in a scripture to realize that God play out his righteousness and we we talk on the scene of word tamai this Gentile lady she had to disguise herself and then uh because she wanted to be identified in the blessings of Abraham and uh she had to go through uh oh a kind of for four four bits or four anointing experience with the four different men and the last man turned out to be the you know the the father himself which is Judah and uh uh and yerry said that she asked Judah uh for you know for some evidence praise the Lord just like just like uh you know we said that it was it was uh uh uh a kind of a dangerous business that she she I mean she she did a very good job you know to be able to disguise herself that Judah never detected that she was the one Naomi did the same thing when she told Ruth how to get into the field of uh the Reapers to go and meet the lord of the Harvest now that that evening after harvest is done the man takes wine you know there is a place only for men to celebrate the work that they have done the hard work they celebrate the Harvest they drink wine they get drunk but yet there is a young woman she's going to go into that field which also was a dangerous thing amen praise the Lord and uh and she was going into the field to make sure there are no other man will see her no other man praise the Lord when we come here is for no other man to see you we are here to attract one person we want One Man attention that's the Lord Jesus Christ she got into the field for no man to see her and in those days all the men pretty much dressed the same even though the lord of the Harvest he was the bus he could dress a second word different and it was the evening she has to go by the moonlight praying and hoping that she will not fall into the wrong camp praise the Lord in so much that when boas noticed that she was at his feet it started him says who is this how did you get here this place is not a place for the girl how did you got here what she wanted she wanted the blessing she wanted to be redeemed she was told that he was a case man praise the Lord now so this morning we want to look at another character and just like how we look at the story of tema coming right in between the sword of Joseph amen praise the Lord Joseph being thrown into the well there are speaks of Joseph you know uh uh uh being persecuted by his brothers and then now Joseph will now be taking over to Egypt but right in the middle of their story there was a parenthesis praise the Lord now we're going to look at another character and then you have to realize that God placed these things in his word to grab our attention in that scripture we read was uh uh uh first Samuel chapter 24 where that David went down there he caught the the Rob of salt and he says my father see I have nothing against you and and then uh uh Saul said yes David my son you are more righteous than I praise the Lord but look at look at the beautiful things that the Bible the way the Bible going to do this is that right after the last spec of David rejection before he will become king the Holy Spirit put in another mystery of redemption praise the Lord first Samuel chapter 25 brings us to a storage of a man that the Bible called a food neighbor amen now you think about it now between rejection and kinship between David last experience with Saul and just before he will get to the throne to become the king of Israel the Holy Spirit plays another Redemption story right here praise the Lord there is something about the feminine nature that God always tied Redemption tone there is something about the feminine nature it's so amazing it's so amazing when you see it in the word so amazing praise the Lord you'll realize that if you look in the scripture even as the Apostle Paul will will say is there the woman is the type of the church he will and then uh Paul will be the one just in in Roman and talks about uh uh uh uh a woman first husband have to die for her to have to take another husband and wherever brand says that is speaking about Redemption now you will also realize that um when Paul speaks in Corinthians where he talks that if uh uh a believing woman will want to stay with their own believing you will see their poor in most of those cases talk to a woman then taking the man have you realized that even the Apostle Peter in his book where he says uh that uh the the the husband will be converted by the composition of his wife praise the Lord so you will see it's a design is it it's uh intentional design by the Holy Ghost for us not to miss what God did in the beginning that's why he plays this sacred virtue in the woman because it's all tied to Redemption it's all around her life the same with the physical woman the same position with the church it's all around our life everything that is happening to us the reason why it's happening is all because of this Redemption purpose that is hanging over your life the places that God has taken you is all because of this Redemption the opportunities he's giving you is all because of his Plan of Redemption our life is designed for this purpose our life is designed for this purpose that is the force that is the thought that is driving behind our lives God's purpose of redemption right in daily life here between his last state of rejection and and and his kinship God going to pull a mystery of redemption right in his life praise the Lord and not a parenthesis the Bible speaks of uh of of this man uh uh uh being a wealthy man and David out there you know the story or you can read it when you get home that's first Samuel chapter 25. right after David has had that experience with Saul the Bible will talks about this man and uh uh uh with with all of his great possession you know that speaks of like a loudish spirit he has he was a man of great possession a man uh the man was very great and he had thousand sheeps and thousand goats and he was sharing his sheeps praise the Lord the Bible says now the name of the man was now blood and uh his wife was Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding she was a woman of good understanding meaning she has a spirit of discernment but this man was accounted for cruelly and evil in his doing and he was of the House of killing praise the Lord now so David beard spending all of his time at a time where he and his men are camping out and hiding away from Saul he's also using that time you know uh to to to also uh kind of for do watch and and protect this man property because he knows if any man comes into that camp and realize that he's there they're going to tell Saul and you will have to be on the run so they are protecting that place and at the same time they are spending time protecting you know uh being a blessing to never amen praise the Lord do you realize that that's the Bride is a blessing to laudish your age is because she is here yeah amen is because the bride is here she's the blessing to this age this age is uh uh uh is having all of his wealth is having all of his invention because the bride is here amen is the Raymond the Raymond The Leftovers of our blessing that is becoming an invention to this word the opening of the seals was the man of God the great man of God great wisdom of God they have ever hit mankind hit man knowledge and out of that explosion science is benefiting from all of this invention praise the Lord but we turn to highly esteem their invention more than the word that gave it to us it's because of us it's because of the Bride of Jesus Christ is because there is a Rapture in church here that this age is being blessed amen and it's because of God's Saving Grace in your life that's why you are enjoying good health amen that's why you are enjoying peace in your family now one comes before the other in a sense that it is now because uh uh uh you know uh science is advancing that's why the church will get to know the church already is there before science gets there now so we see here as as The Story Goes that's what I want to dwell on this morning in showing that she's more righteous than I as The Story Goes we we see that uh David sent his men he sent his young men to go down and and uh you know make some requests from Neville to go and tell him we have been out here you know we I mean we have been trying to keep thiefs and and you know intrude us from your farm you know and and we and we need this and that and then when he got there uh nebler was so drunk and then he shot the man away who's your boss who's your head David a man running away from his master and then I mean he just he just reigned curses on them praise the Lord Hallelujah the Bible says so the young man so David young men turned away and he went again and came and and told him all of these things and David said unto his men gailed you on every man he swore and and the guilt the geared themselves every man he swallowed and David himself and uh and the 400 men and and uh and 200 a bowling and stuff but one of the young men told Abigail now so David hearing this he got so so angry how can this man be Wicked how can he be rude even if you don't want to give us anything don't insult us how can he be rude so David got so angry and he was preparing his man to go and just wet the whole house of uh uh nether he was going to leave no man that would piss against the wall which means he was going to Slit all the men and now all the wealth and everything that he had that you know that make him proudful and boastful will be left behind praise the Lord but the scripture says one of the young men heard and then he ran and told Abigail and said behold David sent messenger out of the Wilderness to salute our master and he read it on them but the man were very good unto us and they and they were not hurt neither Miss we anything or as long as we were conferencing with them when we were in the field there were a war unto us both by night and by day so this young man went out and told Abigail and then uh Abigail hearing that praise the Lord Hallelujah the Bible says then Abigail May hiss and she took 200 loaves and uh two bottles of wine and and and she quickly asked them to to kill the Sheep make a sheep ready and and and and five uh measure of Posh corn I mean she she just got to working praise the Lord she just got to working she got to working praise the Lord amen because she knows she could sense Danger she could sense danger I mean you cannot live in this day and age and don't sense Danger praise the Lord the entire country has just went through one of its more embarrassing time for us getting the uh a speaker in the house praise the Lord it speaks volume it speaks volume to where we are as a nation praise the Lord and all of the things that are happening a six-year-old just pulled a gun on his teacher it speaks volume let me just get too busy and don't sense the environment we are in let us not get too busy looking for what we will not get in one day and don't be aware of the environment and the things that are happening around us praise the Lord because is that sense of danger that will influence your prayer life if you are not sensing danger you don't have anything to take to God In Prayer you don't have a need you cannot spend time before God because you you have no sensitivity to the things that are happening around you the sense of danger make you to think about your young children the sense of danger make you to think about what will my future be if these things are happening now praise the Lord and because she says danger she got to work she got busy there was there was just no time to I mean I I just just played around she knew that she had to do everything or as joshmen because you know what happened like better Branham said every time a seal is open Josh may follow praise the Lord every time a seal open Josh may follow you can see that even in the life of tema bring her here let her be burned that was judgment why because she had a seal praise the Lord so Abigail God blessed and she started putting all of these things together and she said unto her seven go on before me behold I come after you but she told me her husband okay she never wanted to get into an argument she never want to get somebody reasoning to her because she could sense the danger praise the Lord and it was so as she rolled on an ice on the eyes dead she came down by the cover of the hill and behold David and his man came down against her and she met them now David has said surely in vain have I kept all that this Fellow Heart in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all you know see such a kindness I mean they were so kind so respectful nothing was messed of all that patina to him and he had required mean evil for guilt so and more also do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertin to him by the Morning Light any that places against the wall so David actually had judgment in his mind praise the Lord he said this man has re he has rewarded me even for good I'm going to I'm going to bring judgment upon this house praise the Lord and when Abigail saw David she hissed it she lied her off her ass and fell down on her face and bowed herself to the ground and fell and and and fell at his feet and said upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be praise the Lord intercession she went right into an intercession a poor mean a poor mean let this iniquity be praise the Lord Hallelujah but as the story goes on there is something yet I want for us to pick up uh uh uh in in a lot of all of the reading year and and and let the helmet I pray they speak in our audience and hear the words of the Hemi let not my Lord I pray thee regard this man of belong even now before us his name is so is he and he means food but the handmade son that the young man of my Lord whom they are they sent now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul living seeing the Lord have withholding thee from coming to sheer blood praise the Lord amen she draw herself right into the gap she's making David to realize that this is of God praise the Lord amen and from and from Vengeance thyself waved thy own hand now let let thine animate and they that seek evil to my Lord be as nothing now she's she's she's in this place of interceding praise the Lord if you follow those words carefully she's prophesying praise the Lord she's prophesied not even realizing that the next day God is going to struck neighbor she's running she's interceding she says Lord my Lord don't do this don't die I mean don't share blood God is stopping you from doing this and then she broke into prophecy now let thy enemies and their thou thou thy seek evil of my Lord be as number now and now this blessing which the Hemet have brought to my Lord let it even be given unto the young man I pray thee let's get to the next verse I pray thee forgave the trespass of the hemen for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house praise the Lord go and do your your scripture research and search on the show House of David Abigail was prophesying something that even goes to the millennium right the law will give my Lord a show House amen because my Lord fight at the Battle of the Lord and and evil have not been found indeed All That Base praise the Lord yet as man is Raising to pursue it and to seek thy sword Brothers but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of Life wave the Lord thy God and the soul of the enemy you know and she just going on I mean she said you see this this is the this is the thing of word when you find yourself to the right place at the right time God just pulls such and and she just she just pouring prophecy speaking things that that she don't have even any control of prophesying about the show House of David verse 30 and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my law I calling to all the good that he have spoken concerningly and Shah have appointed the ruler over Israel now you follow the sequence here David is going to be anointed feel these hands amen he have just come from that place of cutting saw garment not even realizing there is a battle that is going to come on sword is going to die in that battle the Throne of Israel awaits him he don't even know that but let Abigail here prophesying over his life oh my right between rejection and the kingship a seal has been opened to David a seal has been opened she's telling David you have a show House my friend God has sent me as as a seat of Mercy to hold you back from sharing blood praise the Lord amen now you think about it if David would have slots on this house and few days is going to be king killing the very people he should rule over praise the Lord you see God's righteousness amen sometimes when God allowed things to happen in our life is to stop us from the bigger evil is to hold us back from the greater Danger it might not be pleasant amen it might not be pleasant but yet the Lord is holding us back from the greater evil and that's God's righteousness because he was he would use that situation to wean our heart back to repentance praise the Lord David they're realizing oh my God thank you thank you Lord from from keeping my hands from sharing blood from keeping my hands from sharing blood and the next day God will bring judgment on the house of never he will die in his own house where no man killed taking his life praise the Lord you can fight god battle praise the Lord he want to call you to rejoice in his victory not to fight his fight leave the battle to the Lord you are more than conqueror to rejoice in what he has done now for you to find praise the Lord amen David is right on his way to the throne oh what a wonderful God we save D Praise the Lord I see the time there is is uh it's already one o'clock so let me close this Bible amen let me close this Bible but you think about it think about the things you know you know how you know you know what the feeling is you know what the feeling is not having no idea that this the seventh thing will have happened you're not having no idea and you just took a wrong approach you know how disappointing it can be how hard dropping it can be if I only knew praise the Lord amen the righteousness of God being revealed God holding David back from doing the work I mean I mean we've we've we've we've never added to you you can just see how the Bible say he was a selfish man he was a cruel man a man who just only trusted in his wealth have no regard for nobody I think his cup was full his cup was falling God was going to deal with him because of the Cruel Heart that he had praise the Lord and how Abigail just just stepped right in there a woman of discernment amen a woman of wisdom wise heart she just stepped right in there to hold the wrath of God that's the place of the Bride our King is coming soon amen the King of Kings and the Lord of Lord we know there is a show house for him we know there is a show house we know that there will be a millennium a 1 000 year reign on this Earth we know there is a show House we are standing just like uh uh uh Abigail praise the Lord see what she said there see how she interceded and David you're seeing how the mercy of God through this woman held him back from from sharing blood when he got on the throne that was the first thing he had he wanted uh uh Abigail after never die amen that this is the woman the helmet back from something that I would not have forgiven myself praise the Lord God is the place of the Bride that's where the Throne of Mercy is but what is happening we are allowing this last day Spirit to pressure us in amen to pressure us in and soak all of that virtue out of our life that we so snap at everything we just snap at every giving instance and sometimes we miss Josh things Miss George thinks of our children Miss judging of our spouses Miss George things of our parents and we just snapped I said well what are you talking like oh I never knew that was why you wanted to do praise the Lord and sometimes we just take it if we just take it as the norm of the day look church if we if if we're not finding time to spend with our bridegroom and I was I was there in the office this morning and uh the Sunday School tip was playing I hear I had a a marriage ceremony and I said well I did not know wedding was taking place today I didn't know that wedding was taking place here come the bride I said oh my God amen well you see how brother Branham closed that wedding ceremony he brought the whole ceremony to this place just as this bride and her husband so Lord we are we in our bridegroom that's the bigger picture whatever that is happening in our life is so small a picture then the picture from God's mind let us not allow work and and and everything that is happening around our life to be able to to I mean to squeeze that grace of God out of us so squeeze the sweetness of God out of her we get Soul pressure because we work work work and our mind is just going to catch up with the next time and the next thing to do and the next thing on the agenda and the next thing and and and it just burned us out of strength that we have no time to be able to reflect and take the right action when we are supposed to be able to get in the chamber and spend some time with the Lord we must not wait for an emergency to make us desperate there is a lot of emergency around our lives it don't have to be personal emergency there are emergency with our loved ones with our relatives and just like how these Saints are unfolding in the scripture that is the same way God does with the opening of the seals whenever the message is coming foreign there is Judgment that is also coming the the the recipients of that message receive God's grace the ones that rejected received the judgment praise the Lord Abigail here received the message she she she answered rightly to the message she received God's mercy and got right into the throne never been arrogant and you know he's always have a way to talk to anybody the way he want to talk to them because he have a right to express himself for the time we are living in musicians you can come forth what a time that we are living in and the things that is happening around us God in his great mind he has designed situations to be able to help us to see the weaknesses to help us to see the things that we need to bring to his throne he has designed situations amen just to give us the opportunity to see that area in our life where we need to keep under the blood that's the day that's the hour that we are living in foreign time that we are living in [Music] God's righteousness being expressed through you and myself God's mercy being expressed through you and myself the way we deal with things the way we deal with people [Music] but you see if we are not consecrating ourselves [Music] if we are not consecrating enough said we are not finding that time to slip away [Music] it will just be all concerned of uh how we can be entertained or how we can be fed but just like we spoke about the drafting of the birth or the formation of the birds that it used to fly you have to realize that each and every one of us we have a unique gift that we bring to the body and when you are met when you are not exercising your gift [Music] what it is your time away praying or whether it is your your I mean your present in church the way you clap your hands the way you sing the way you say Amen to the word if you are not exercising your gift you are depriving the body foreign [Music] to get out of here we need our fly information to get out of here [Music] just like the migration of the birds is a mystery it's a complete mystery to the science word there are a lot of people that try to write on it and you know they try to express what they think about it but you can still see this there's a lot there's there's a lot of gaps in the airplane it's a complete mystery to the science word and that is the same way the migration the moving of the Church of the Living God is a mystery foreign this situation situations to just come in a certain moment and setting time in our lives and and uh wanting to see his righteousness Express how are we going to deal with it like I've always said when you allow a situation to get the best of you you can never do anything good about it because I have already robbed you they have already rubbed you you can never do nothing good if a situation get the best of you you have to be the best the best of yourself to be able to deal with whatever situation yes leave it there leave it there oh take your bird into the Lord and leave it there if you trust and never doubt he will only bring you out figures blessing God for us again oh yes leave it back take your breathing to the Lord and leave it there if you trust and never doubt he will surely break you out they those burdens to the Lord and Lead yes [Music] leave it there take your burden to the Lord if you trust and never doubt he will surely break you out they just burdens to the Lord and leave it there just before we pray now you see when you when when you talk about these things and you talk about The Venture you talk about the the scripture position of the woman in the in in the in the Bible that you see the things you see the different design you know uh and the different places that God placed these female character that's that Express out his uh his Redemption plan sometimes you know you you have some some you know some some men that struggle over that thought you know it's all because Society has given us a very wrong understanding or interpretation of what manhood is and what woman who is and that's why we have all of these struggle have all of this struggle whatever man can do woman can do it and you know and we have the perversion in all the mix-up that we have going on but when you look into the Bible and you start to appreciate this you you start to look right right down from Genesis and look through the scripture and all the provision that God's made for the protection of a woman you being the Bride of Jesus Christ if you get that understanding if you get that understanding to be able to appreciate that the places that God put the woman in the scripture you know exactly that it speaks of your spiritual position because there is there is one man in this house that the Lord Jesus amen there is one man it's the Lord Jesus as his church we are his bride amen we are his bride and do you see what the kind of a struggling thing sometimes it will be because even as the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a whole lot we can learn from our mother from our sisters from our wives if they have garlic character [Music] because because in their life it's a mystery that is placed [Music] praise the Lord and you see it and and also on this on the other side you know you you have all of these striving and uh and uh you know uh uh uh uh you know like someone said it looks like in the Bible they were just on a male character it talks about David it talks about something it talks about Daniel and it just looked that it's just male character it's because you are reading it with the eyes of the society you are reading it there is something in a society that is getting at you so when you read God's word you see the same thing so you don't get the benefit you don't get the benefit [Music] but there is a blessing there is a blessing in the way that God designed us they will say where can I go and hide myself from the Lord foreign where can I go even in the depths of the seed he is there [Music] let's buy our house to the Lord there [Music] Heavenly Father Lord we just took a little bit of nature today looking at the birds looking at that Heavenly creature Lord father one of these days to God we're going to set our wings right and we will fly away one of these days so Lord God we're going to be quicking one of these days we're going to be lifted above our trials going to be lifted above Lord fly away from the things that we are dealing with now actually death Lord but an overcoming power something that is in your word that will lift us above those things Lord and father just looking at the design of the bird [Music] it was just to be able to grab a mental picture Lord of you the designer the ability that you put in all of those creatures [Music] there is none of us here can look at a bare tree and knock it with our hands without getting the bruise but the Woodpecker can go at that tree and nail into the tree we don't have that ability but that little bird have it and father that is the same way everyone sitting on the sound of my voice this morning however God giving ability a god-giving design something that God has put his own inscription on in our life that the work of God can be manifested that we can be a blessing to our family we can be a blessing to our wives we can be a blessing to our children we can be a blessing to our husband we can be a blessing to our loved ones and the neighbors and our co-workers [Music] father we are coming to you this afternoon as your children Lord we have our hands up for God we have our hearts our minds looking to you father in the hour and a day that we are living in Lord when father we can no longer trust the system so God that a funny father have placed put in place Lord oh god father that's the reason why this nation all alone has paralyzed Israel because those things were put in place by a golly man golly man that put those things in place the three stages of government in all of those things right from the scripture foreign man in his selfishness Lord and we see all the corruption we see all the things that is that is that is coming in Lord we pray that you'll be merciful Lord oh God we want to be just like Abigail father we want to be Anointed with a spirit of wisdom to know how to go in and come out Lord to know how to all God step into a situation wisely father foreign we want to leave our homes like Abigail knowing that there is danger in a land we want to go father Lord with some
