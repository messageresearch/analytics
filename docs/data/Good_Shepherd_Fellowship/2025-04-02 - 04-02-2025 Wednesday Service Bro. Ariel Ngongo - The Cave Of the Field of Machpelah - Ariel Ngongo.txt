that you will spend heaven with so you need to greet him now God bless you God bless you it feels good to be in the house of the Lord tonight uh how many of us are happy to be here if you are here say amen amen if you are here say Amen oh my God God has been so good to us isn't it so now we're just going to approach the word here uh I have a thought in my heart just pray for me uh I just believe that the Lord how many of us love the word amen so if you love the word you are at the right place right is that right so I would just invite you to open in the book of jobs just for a minute here here um you know before we open the Bible let's speak to the a of the word for just a minute here Heavenly Father we come before you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this is the moment where father we want you to have your way Lord we have worship you father because Angel can do they cannot do it the right way because they didn't need a redeemer father but we are standing here because because we need a redeemer we need a savior that's why Lord God receive our worship oh father that can be oh God perfume of good order to reach your your place oh Father where you are father and bless us at this moment oh Father Lord we give every single one of your children into your hand father put the ministry out of the way father may you come and minister to your people I don't know their need oh God but you do father may you come and do your work father we bless us oh Father abundantly may I be sensitive to your spirit oh God to go in the direction that you would want me to be that your people can be blessed today as we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen Job chapter 19 verse 23 I'll try my best to go a little faster here because time is gone just pray for me Job chapter 209 uh job 19 verse 23 I want you to pay attention on what job is saying here it's very familiar scripture all of us knows pretty we know the story of job now watch what job is saying here it says all that my words were now written all that they were printed in the book that they were griven in a iron pen and led in the rock forever you know he's Desiring so what whatever is's about to say he wanted to be recorded is that right it's just to let us know that whatever he's about to say is of great importance is that right now it says for I know my redeemer liveth how many of us believe that it says and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin warm destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God Amen now open with me again in the Book of Genesis chapter 20 uh uh 20 23: 19 now as job is saying these things he wanted to be recorded you know he he sought the resurrection but just it was a revelation because faith is a revelation he saw the resurrection by saying what he was saying here now in Genesis chap 23: 19 the Bible says after this so which means that Sarah had died at this point it says after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of MPA before mambre the same is abon in the land of Canaan and the field and the cave there uh is therein were made sure unto Abraham for possession for a burial place by the sons of Earth and now I'll just stop there and let's go to Matthew chapter 27 verse 51 Matthew chapter 2751 or you can read along with me for this one I think the scriptures are on the board we can just read if if you ready you can say amen and behold the veil of the the temple was rent in twined from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quick and The Rock ran and the grave were open and many bodies of the saint which slept arose and came out of the Grave after what his resurrection and went into the holy city and appear unto many do you believe that amen you may be seated I just pray that the Lord will be able to bless us for the little time that we have uh it's it's always hard when you look at the time you're getting a little nervous but we trust that the Lord will be able to help us tonight I want to speak on a little subject that I entitled The Cave of the field of mpar think it is found here in the Book of Genesis chapter 23 and the Bible will tell us that this cave it was made sure unto Abraham for a possession for a burial place by the son of Earth now before I get really in the in the in the the the the the foundation of my subject I want to speak a little bit on the infallibility of God word right the infallibility of God's word now if there is one thing we should know is that God does not change is that right God keeps his word no matter what you are dealing with God keeps his word to the who who beli that now it has to be a revelation to you to believe that no matter what you are dealing with God still keeps his word is that right now we can rest assure anything that God had said in his word will come to pass and it is true how many of us believe that now our faith it's not based right it's not based on the shifting Scent of a man idea is that right or a men theology now our faith is resting on the unmovable Rock of God Eternal Word is that right because that word cannot fail right and in the Book of Matthew the Bible says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word will not pass away who believes that now God when he says something is not a meant to lie is not a son of man to change his opinion he can just say something and say oh wow I did no better let me me change my opinion God does not do that if there is a promise in the Bible you can go over there and get that promise it belongs to you you have to believe that he is God and is able to fulfill what he have said is that right because what would be the importance of us to come to church to believe him if we we doubt in our heart that he's able to fulfill his own word are you with me are you with me who believe that God exists who believe that God is faithful who believe that God keeps his word amen so if you believe give him a hand because he's worthy of it is that right God keeps his word he infinite is infinite in his way when he says something it must come to pass now I just take you for a little minutes here when the Bible speaks here it says that the lamb was slay before the foundation of the world is that right he was slain even in the thought of God before even it steps into uh a a physical appearance he was already slain is that right so it took thousands of years before we see Jesus on the scene but God had already spoken it is that right he spoke it and he continues to do his own business because that word had to come to pass so Sint you can rest on that word tonight and even if you may not see it it will come to pass you see Believers believe without seeing you see other people's religion is based on something that they can't touch but your religion is based on something that you cannot even touch you can believe in Salvation of your child that is fully in the world you can still believe that God will bring them back you might be in the situation that you've been long waiting for a long time you say how can I get out of this you don't know or every single one of us have a situation in our life we've been praying about but we still believe we still come to church because we know that God what is faithful to keep his word is that right so if you look for example in the story of Noah he never reigned before who believes that but when God spoke to Noah he says build the ark he did not even doubt he never even know what Rin means so he took God at his word it was a revelation to him that whatever God was saying was the truth that he will keep his word so you see faith is not depending on what you can see it depends on something that you cannot see but you believe it and that would come to pass and Noah did the same he believed the word but now in the story of job here I want just to to to stop a little bit here job is the oldest book of the Bible how many of us know that it was even written before the Book of Genesis now the Book of Genesis was written by Noah by by Moses right but job Liv before Moses is that right now you understand that the book that's the prophet saying it says job is the oldest book of the Bible now if you you you you study just a little bit here job rested on the promise that God made him is that right or gave him he stood on the burnt offering remember the scripture says in Job chapter 1 that you know when the his children will leave job will offer the sacrif is that right how many of us know that you know he believed he had full confidence in his burn sacrifice he knew that God was able to forgive his sin and also the sin of his children it's the same thing as every parent would pray for the children you know offer a sacrifice and go on the knees and say Lord I may not know what they're doing but Lord please keep them because you believe that God will keep his word is that right now it was the same thing with with with job you know and the prophet says if the church could ever get to a place to where it could solemnly rest upon God's word the church need to get to that place where they can rest solemnly on God's word without even seeing it believing that whatever he has said it will come to pass now job had to go through the most trying time of his life and all his experience when he had been found in the presence of God a just man he was called a just man not because he did not have mistake but the bom says a righteous man is not a sinless man a righteous man is not a sinless man a righteous man is somebody that can acknowledge the wrong and say God I'm not worthy please come and help me that was this type of man like job he was called a righteous man because he was depending on his offering the lamb was there was standing in his place he did not have confidence in himself he had confidence in the lamb that's why tonight we say you know don't depend on your own ability look at the lamb I'm inviting you tonight to look at the lamb don't look at your ability look at the lamb if the lamb is worthy I am worthy is that right because in the Old Testament they were never EV they were not looking at the they were not looking at the worshipper they will examine what the lamb they say oh is the Lamb had a broken leg if if if he has a broken leg he cannot be sacrificed he has to be perfect they never look at the person the worshipper they looked at the lamb so if Jesus is the Lamb don't look at yourself look at your lamb and that's what makes you righteous because you depending on your lamb are you with me now if you look at the the the story of job here I want you to read up in the Bible with me in Job chapter 14:7 amen do you like the word wow we have a wonderful savior we have a wonderful Savior and you see job here was going through a very trying time very difficult time but now now now re and even before you go to job let's go to Romans chap 1 ver2 there is a principle that I want to lay there before we jump into the book of of job Romans 1: 20 if the people at the back can help this is can help us to go a little faster here so now watch watch this principle just for a minute here the Bible says for the invisible things right the invisible things of him from creation of the world are clearly seen is that right you would understand why brother bham says God is in nature right watch this it says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made is that right even is eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so God if you look at nature you can see God in it because it is you know it's visible but you can understand the visible things but what you are seeing in in the visible things is that right you can look at a tree there is a principle in the tree that will make you understand God right you can't look at the universe you see the univ function then you can't understand God is that right because that's why the prophet says God is in nature now watch job now job in job Chapter 14 verse uh 7 it says for there is hope of a tree I want you to just pay attention with me here is looking at what at a tree is that right it says there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will spread again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the sense of water it will bird and bring forth but like a plant now verse 10 watch what job is saying it's saying but men died and wasted away yay men give up The Ghost and where he is where is he now job is looking at the plant are you with me I I want you to catch this thing with me just for a minute job is looking at a visible thing he's looking at a tree it says there is a principle in the tree when a tree is cut off right there is a for example in the winter you don't see the leaves you don't see the fruit is that right but job is trying to show us a principle here is looking at nature it says Nature has Seasons there is a season where when the tree is cut off there is a time where it will bu again right that's the visible thing right are you with me is looking at a tree it says the tree can be cut off but eventually he will bring forth again if he expose itself to water but it says now he asking himself what about men because I have seen men dying but I never seen the resurrection oh are you are you catching this with me so it see the principle in nature is wondering it says how can nature brings back again there is a quickening power Oh Glory to God there's a quickening power in the plant that even if it's cut off he will come back again but he looks at men men dies and Contin to die but there's no Resurrection that's Job chapter 14 are you with me oh my these things are very important and and I'm just laying a principle there before we go faster is that right now as he was going through the hard time of his life job stood the very the very Cal moment of his life he said I know my redeemer liveth that's where we read in Job chapter what 19 so there is something in Job that he did not know in Job chapter 14 because he was wondering about the resurrection but now in Job chapter 19 he sees the resurrection he says I know my red live it was not just a sleep of Tong it was a revelation that came to job in that moment that if the plant can be cut off he will comes back again now I know even if I die I will come back again oh glory to God that's a simple principle there so job rested on the word the promise of God oh my goodness my goodness me now watch watch this principle here it says I know my redeemer leth at the last day he shall stand on the earth don't my skin warm destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God you see no matter how dark it seemed unreal it seems there is something that job anchored or rested on the promise that his Redeemer liveth so this F here it was a place where job rested his soul Upon A promise that if I die I will come forth the same principle is applying to a tree oh my goodness and that's where it was his burying place I'll just just bear with me a minute here you understand why I'm saying this brother says something here in the message on uh onment it says I want you to no this the future word I wish to say job specify his buried place when job died he was buried thus now I want you to pay attention here um you can look at it as a location you can look at it also as a place where the promise is so you look at on both Sid you can't look at it as a location where that there is something that will happen to me there is something that will happen to a specific location that will bring me back to bring me forth or to resurrect me is that right or also to die with the promise to of Resurrection do you see what I'm saying so as I'll be shuffling back and forth you would understand where am I coming to right now let's watch Abraham right right let let's just look at Abraham for a minute here oh my you see I love the word of God if if you look at Abraham for a minute here oh my how many of us belied that Abraham had an unwavering faith in Romans chapter 4:17 it says Romans chapter 4:17 it says is it is written I have made thee the father of many Nation before him whom he believe even God who quickeneth the dead and call those things which be not as though they were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many Nation according to that which was spoken so shall that seed be right being now weak in faith he considered not his own body dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God to what unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform now Abraham by Revelation when job died they bury job at a certain location but Abram says he was in Palestine is that right they buried job in Palestine Abraham understood by Revelation that he had to oh my goodness he had to purchase a land in Palestine because the promise of Resurrection was to be in Palestine you see he had the Revelation he says no job was buried in Palestine then before dur when Sarah died Abraham had the Revelation to buy a land a piece of land that is called the Cave of the field of Mella because why the promise of the Resurrection as job spoke he says I know my redeemer liveth he knew that the very same place that job was buried there was the promise of Resurrection there the promise of Resurrection was not in Egypt it was in the promised land it was in Palestine are you with me oh my I could have G gone into a lot here but let's look a few things here Genesis chapter 20 where we read but let's go to Genesis chapter 258 you would understand why it was a revelation to every single one of them because if you look at this parden all the patriarch and even later on will Buri in that same place so we need a prophet to tell us what these things means that's why without a prophet we cannot see it clearly we'll be confused now oh my goodness Genesis 25:8 and Abraham give up The Ghost and die in the good old age and an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people and his son Isaac and ishma bury him in the cave of what of myar in the field of ephon the the the zorite the hate which which is before mambre is that right and the field which Abraham purchased of the son of Earth there was Abraham buried and Sarah his wife because Sarah dies before before Abraham so when AB when Sarah died they bury her there because Abraham B the field right and bury Sarah and when he died Isaac and Ishmael came and bury him the same place oh my let's look at Genesis 35 verse 27 and Jacob came into Isaac his father in mamory unto the city of Abram which is Abron where abra and Isaac surgeon and the day of Isaac were 103 uh uh three score years and Abram gave out the ghost and die he was buried unto his people being old and full of days and the son of Esau and Jacob Buri him right now if if you go to verse 49 uh chapter 49:31 Genesis 49:31 watch what the Bible says it says there they bury Abraham and Sarah's wife they bury Isaac and Rebecca's wife right and they are Buri Leah that's now Abraham got buried there is that right Sarah was buried in the same place right Isaac here is buried in the very same land in the very same Cave of the field of M is that right oh my we contining here Genesis chapter um Genesis chapter 4 47 27 and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goan now at this point Abraham Isaac Jacob when he got old Joseph right went to Egypt is that right how many of us know that at the end of the you know at the end of the story you notice that Israel moved to Goan to Egypt right they left the land of promise they went back to egyp they went to Egypt right because Joseph was a governor in in Egypt how many of us know that now the Bible says um and Israel dwelt in the land of of of Egypt the country of Goan and the the uh they had possession therein and grew and multitude ex exceedingly and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so that the whole age of of of Jacob was 140 years and the time Drew night that Israel must die that's talking about Jacob right he called his son Joseph he said unto him if now I have found Grace in th sight are you reading with me is that right put a pray thy hand under what Ma TI the very same tie that Jacob met God fought with God he was a prince with God he started becoming a he became a limping priest are you with me that very same spot he told Joseph now touch me on my tie promise me that you're not going to bury me in Egypt why all the patriarch refused to be buried in another location that in Palestine because the promise of the Resurrection had to happen in Palestine Oh Glory to God this people were this patriarch were prophets are you with me there were prophets oh that that that's wonderful how many of us love the Lord oh my goodness that's powerful now it says if a put thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me Bury Me Not afay the in what in Egypt now let's go to verse 30 and I will lay with my father and thou shal carry me out of the land of Egypt and bury me in the burial place is that right and he says I will do as thou has said now 31 and he say swear unto me and he swear unto him Israel bow himself upon the bed now you would if you read your Bible after his death they brought him and buried him there but it does not stop there let's look at Joseph a minute here oh my goodness how many of us love the Lord is is it is it wonderful we'll call it Bible study tonight right is that okay we can't just call it a Bible study here now if we read um Genesis chapter 49 49 verse I think we no let's 50 let's go to Genesis 50: 25 uh 24 and Joseph said unto his bre I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of the land unto the land which spake Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up what my bone from this is that right and so Joseph died being 110 years and the unor him and he he was put in the coffin in Egypt right now for you to understand what happened let's let's go to the Book of Exodus chapter 13 verse 9 and 19 Exodus 13:19 and Moses took the Bor of Joseph with him for he had straight sown unto the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and he shall carry up my bone away he with you right now oh my goodness so we see Abraham buying a land right in Buri Sarah Isaac came got buried to the same place and Rebecca Jacob comes he was burying the same space is that right Leah got bu all of them got buried there Joseph got buried there but I want to read a quote from Brother Bram here you see that's important that that's why Revelation is very important Revelation is very important watch what the prophet is saying here he says now Faith it's a revelation you know the book of Hebrew talks about by faith Abraham by faith Isaac how many of us know that now brother B is saying here faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation there's where I want you to stay just a moment it's a revelation God has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you did not work yourself up to Faith you ever had faith it is G it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation now this men were even Abraham was able to buy that field because he looked at job he said job be had a prom by Revelation he recognized that even if he die there is a Resurrection coming for him so Abraham dies he buries Sarah he buys that land but that land had to be bought for a purpose and also for a price you see now if you read in Genesis chapter 23:9 oh my goodness we're running out of time but the Lord will help us tonight how many of us love the Lord you would have there's a there's a pattern that I'm I'm trying to show here before I go a little faster is that right now you would notice that Abraham was offered this land it says you know the the the children of Earth wanted to offer the L to Abraham but Abraham said you you can't read it at home you know the whole uh Genesis CH 23 but Jacob refused he says no this land I'm going to buy it because now he had to possess that land not free he had to pay a price you understand what I'm saying there is a reason why he had to pay it was offered you know most of the time you say oh wow I mean they give it to me I'm just going to get it no when it comes to most important places you need to buy it because we don't want anybody to say and get me out of it I need to possess it pay the full price of the land because there is a promise there there is a promise of the resurrection and brother bam says something in the future home he says did you notice Abraham when he tried to give him the land he bought it with so many shekel it was 400 shk of silver before the people people as an inside as a witness he wanted witness to be there there is a purpose behind all of this but let me shift just for a minute why did Abraham had to buy the land why he had to pay the full price there is a pattern here that God is trying to show us in his word in the Book of Genesis when men sinned in the Garden of Eden God's requirement was the the the day you will eat of this tree you will die how many of us know that that was God requirement and when men ate of that tree they did not die automatically the very same day that they die but there was a process of death that started right away is that are you with me but God could not overwrite his own word he already said it it says that the day you will eat of it you will die but God looking at his own children he could not kill them can you imagine that your son versus your own word you see what I'm saying God had to choose another substitution way he took a lamb and he killed the lamb to stand between Adam and Eve and a holy God are you with me and the lamb was the subtitute he had to stand between Oh Glory to God do you believe that that's when we were singing when I see the blood I will pass over you why there was a lamb that died and there was a of blood that was on the lant it's the same principle right now God could not override his own decision or his word because the penalty of Disobedience was death but God love was projected that it oh my goodness that he had to come up with another subtit substitutionary way and he K the animal so that the animal would take place of his sinful son and daughter is that right or the the son and daughter that fell you know an innocent lamb that had known no sin had to die instead of a guilty sinner now if you look at the Old Testament they had bulls and goats but the Bible will tell us that the Bulls and goat in the Old Testament was not taken away the desire of sin how many of us know that it was only covering the you know it was not the full picture of it but we just read here in Revelation 13:8 the lamb was slid before the foundation of the world but that lamb was not an animal because an animal does not have a soul so since death is required the animal was just a temporary or it was just a shadow but the real one had to come right because now the life that is the animal does not have a soul so when you killed an animal the life cannot be transferred to the worshipper because he does not have a soul but in this case Jesus Christ what the lamb came with a soul he had a soul he had a spirit and he had a body you see that was just a temporary thing that's what the Bible says the Lord having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of things can ever with those sacrifice which they offer year by year continually make the comment thereof perfect because the animal did not have a soul that life could not be transferred that's why we needed a perfect sacrifice thank you Jesus oh my when when God in his mind slay the lamb it was not an animal he was planning to slay his own son you see when it comes to Redemption God does not send Angels he comes himself because this is a greater business God had to come down by himself to become a man to die for you and I you're talking about love you're talking about the love of God for you he left everything he left the angel he left that glory to come down on Earth to become a man to take your place oh glory to God to take your place let me tell you something the lamb was an animal but my lamb is a human Hallelujah my lamb is no longer an an is not an animal my lamb is a redeemer Oh Glory to God my lamb has power to die and to take back his life again an animal when he dies they bury automatically there's no power to resurrect him back again but this lamb that I have is a human being he can't feel what I feel Oh Glory to God thank you are you with me that's why he had to be bruised right he had to be bruised the same way it's the same pattern he had to Die the death that he went through you know I was reading I was I was reading a place where brother is saying you know the David says that he had to be pressed on the side how many of us know that he had to be pressed on the side brother benam says you know when when the he died they pess him on the side it says you know let me just take a thought here it says Jesus did not die of a Roman spear are you with me that's not why kill him huh nther was the loss of blood that killed him is that right not the nail not the crown in his head of Thon it says he died of grief and heart Brokenness you know what the prophet says it says one heart Brokenness caused a chemical reaction in his body that's why the blood and water came together because it was a chemical reaction because the very same people he came to save they rejected him you see what I'm saying it's not the spear that killed him it's the very same people that he came to save can you imagine he left everything behind to come for you and I I'm not going to get to my thoughts but I just feel a pull to go in this direction I don't know why he left his glory to come for you to set you free to set me free he became a man but the very people that he came to save the very people that he came to save they rejected him and buried and crucified him you know John the Baptist ministry came one day you know Jesus and John the Baptist they knew each other they were little cousins how many of us know that they were little cousins but John the Baptist was a prophet he was a prophet God already told him he says if if you see right you know a dove you know SP like a dove on top of of a men that will pass by right then that will be the lamb and one day he was just baptizing people then he saw his little cousin passing by but whatever sign that God told him he se he saw he saw in his little cousin he says behold this is the Lamb of God that take us away the sin of the world behold pay attention look he was pointing you to the lamb but pilate however says Behold a man when he was crucifying him just before the crucify he says Behold a man that John the Baptist by Revelation he says Behold the Lamb of God so tonight I'll ask your question would you say Behold the Lamb or behold the man because he is my my lamb he is my lamb Oh Glory to God now he was bruised he was wounded because of the the the the the uh the transgression of the people he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for iniquity oh my my my goodness may the Lord help us may the Lord help us tonight how many of us love the Lord now if you look here even caias prophesied you know when he heard about the resurrection of of Lazareth he was so mad he says no we need to kill this man right watch what he's saying here in the book of oh my goodness I'm not going to get to my thought because of time it says John chap 11 verse 49 it says one of them called cayapas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all now watch verse 50 it says no consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and the whole nation perish not he prophesied without even knowing because this men that they were plotting to kill was the lamb he had to take the sin of the world he had to carry your sin and my sin that word had to come to pass but I'm glad that there's one morning they buried him right they buried him but on Sunday morning right he resurrected Oh Glory to God we were getting into sad Affair let's go to happy stuff now he resurrected oh my let let me Rush here do you love the Lord oh my the word of God is so good can you just imagine I I would not have time uh to read all of these thing but sister can you can you just uh look at the message atonement uh paragraph 90 I I'm going to read it for a minute here now he went to the when you know Jesus died and he says father I commend my spirit unto you right it says cry father father where is that forsaken me you know it's you know you know the whole thing that happen is that right right but now the prophet would tell us when Jesus died his body went to the Grave how many of us know that his Spirit went back to God because that's what the Ecclesiastes says is that right but his soul did not rest how many of us know that because the man is a trium being right is the body the spirit and the Soul so his body when he died the body went to the Grave right the spirit went back to God but is so went to hell remember the Bible talks about the two goats it talks about the scape goat right so the the first goat will be killed right remember the goat is kind of the negative side of it right because a sheep God is represented as a sheep but he had to become a goat because he was carrying the sin of the world on him now that's a representation of the Two Goats right so the first goat they will actually kill him and the blood of the first goat they'll put it on the second goat right and then the second goat will be left in the wilderness he'll be wandering in the wilderness but Jesus Christ played the role of both of them he was killed right and then he was projected in the wilderness and he so went to what to Hell brother benam says even the Bible says he went to hell to preach to the soul that did not repent in the time of Noah in the long suffering in the time of Noah is that right that's the Bible he preached for them and after that you know Satan had the key of Hell at the grave how many of us know that you know brother B of call is his is three power he had all of that he had the control he had the key of death so any man no matter if you a a a Believer or whatever right when you die you will go into this section called The Paradise are you with me the all the saints they will go into that place where Satan still has the has the key because all of those men when they die they die under the bulls and goats the blood of good and go bulls and gold could not set them free they were still captive even though they were good even if they were righteous but they were still stuck into that place because Satan had the key even if you live right even if you better he had the key of all of that but when he soul went to hell are you with me when when Oh Glory to God when his soul went to hell he preached to the soul that they did not repent he went and took the key from Satan right he took the key off from Satan that's right after taking the the key of Satan he even kicked him do you understand what I'm saying now watch what the prophet is saying here in in the next quote sister give give us that quote it came what watch what the oh my goodness I love this I I feel good he says I can't see him you can read the whole sermon if you have your time it says I can't see him let take a little Peck into what the paradise into that section that all the saent were because he preached to the soul right he took the key of death Hell In The Grave right now he coming now when to the paradise it says I can't see him let's take a little peek into the paradise let's look over there I see Sarah and Abraham walking around there after a while brother Bram knocks at the at the ppit something on the door it says Abraham goes and open the door and say Annie come here look here look here that's the very white the very same one that stood with me under the oak that day right he he is Abraham what god let's continue just then I can see Daniel now there's something important here Abraham remember seeing him in Genesis Chapter 18 when he came to in human flesh are you with me now here Daniel look over is sold that's the rock that was soed out of the what the mountain and a certain as I stand there and I see job raise up saying that's my redeemer that I said I knew that he lives you know they were all buried in that place the we just read in Matthew that when Jesus died that the grave or many what the grave open so this was after this had to happen before all of them to before the resurrection job rais up and said that's my redeemer that I said I knew that he leaveth and someday he would stand upon the Earth my body may not be but a little St of Ashes but a 50 minute 15 minutes from now I will I will be in again let's continue again Ezekiel say I see the same person as the will in the middle of the wheel every single one of them we seeing the same person but they they seen him how he appeared to them oh you see how the word is is wonderful right oh my good and is sorry Abraham Sarah can remember him standing at the Oak Discerning the thoughts of Sarah Daniel see the stone Ezekiel seen the whe in the middle of the whe job sees I see my redeemer leaveth right let's continue Enoch said I saw him coming with 10,000 of what saints that execute what judgment let's continue it says there was the Old Testament Saint wedding sh they was under the atonement of blood they could not go in the presence of God God Of Heaven because goat and sheep could not what take away sin let's continue but says my brethren I am one that you think that the things I am I am the seed of the woman now he's presenting himself to them he says I am the son of David I the Son of God I'm the Virgin born one my blood has atoned for it you waed under the blood of sheep and and goat but now my blood atones and you are free let go it's getting almost Easter just think that's just about 1900 and and sometime years ago tonight now they're about to come out and show up in Jerusalem let's continue I can't see Abraham said Lord when we get up in our body again and Sarah I just love it so well do you mind if we make a little Willow stop kind of you your road he says now I can hear him said why no certainly not I'm going to stay with my disciple for about 24 look around and see how it looks continue on that glorious Easter morning where you would take up in the morning the Lord willing when the rose up from the dead the Bible says according to the sin that's the very scripture we just read is that right many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth Rose and came out of the Grave who was Abraham now it goes back to the very same people that was buried in that very same spot are you with me it says Abraham Isaac Jacob Jo job those who by spiritual Revelation revealed Revelation know that the Redeemer would stand on the earth what someday it says the first fruit of those that slept they was walking in the city and can't see Sarah and Abraham so people when the resurrection happened they could see them walking in Jerusalem are you with me oh my oh my goodness I love the word all of these prophets die with hope that is going to be a resurrection do you have the same hope that there's going to be a resurrection they believe in God's word so when they die they die with the hope that they will come up again but here it's happening the in that very same spot because the promise of the Resurrection was in Canaan land it was in in Palestine are you with me Saints we have to be buried somewhere not in Egypt because Egypt is the type of the world you have to be buried in Christ you have to be buried in Christ why do you have to be buried in Christ because there is a promise of Resurrection that's what is all about it's not about you know eggs how you call it bur eggs see I'm I'm not used to those I never done those things how you say is the bues or whatever it's called it's not you know it's not because of all of that we have a greater hope we have a greater hope my goodness let me close up with some quotes here I'll just read it really quick oh my may God help us Saint you know we have a hope Victory Day Victory Day 235 Joseph said don't bury me here bury me up here see bury me here with my father sister can you post that for us please Victory Day preach on 63 all right I'm just going to read it it says bury me the way they were buried the prophet says the word it says the word the plan they was buried in the place that they were buried in the promise of the Resurrection is in the word the promise of the Resurrection is when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now in another place brother B of Gabriel instruction to Daniel brother bam says hear me thus said the Lord God will not deal with Israel with his church until she comes out she's come back to the Homeland it says the man message of the hour the message of the hour is not just people moving back and forth they say oh yeah we we are a group of people wearing long skirts no it's Jesus Christ back to that relationship with Jesus Christ it's the person of Jesus Christ in your heart because if you die there is a promise for you to come out that's right are you with me so it's not just a gathering of people in Minneapolis no it are there are people that trying to receive God in their heart because if they die they are dying with the promise that there's going to be a resurrection that's right Lord even for the young people all of us it doesn't mean that if I'm standing as a minister you know then I can just do whatever no everything we're rushing we we getting we getting into the word we're feeding on the word because there is a promise of Resurrection there the message of the Yahweh that's why don't bury me in Dogma don't bury me in ideas of men bury me in the message of the hour carry me to the message of the hour not the message of Luther not the message of Wesley in the opening of the word the reveal with the open this seven ters belongs to me it's not just oh well I don't understand what the seven seal is I don't understand what the seven Thunders are because the promise is there the promise is there that's the message for your day not the message of of of Luther the message of the your day is the reveal word pre Malachi 4 Saint that's why we not denomination we're different the way we act as young people we're different the sister the way we're dressing is because we different we we are of a different breed we are A peculiar people we should not be copying the word the word should copy us because we have the promise of the Resurrection Oh Glory to God glory to God that's what God sent Malachi for that's what he sent us this great promises in the Bible you know when the brother was speaking about Redemption this is the greatest love story it's your story Redemption is not just a thought oh wow I'm talking about this thing look at the Bible no it's your story it's about you that's why it says I send you Elijah the proph behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the Judgment I send you a way of Escape Oh Glory to God I'm going to close here for a minute do you have this the quotes there this day the scripture is fulfilled 151 and we're going to close here do you love the Lord it says now but in this day there is to come a super a royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what I will be would you be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night I won't be a natural seed it will to be what a super a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual uh bride raise up which will be the Royal seed of the royal fith what of Abraham royal son she is to come on the scene in the last day in the time the place is a promise that is given to her there is a promise to you so it's not just for us to come to church Saints don't bury me in Egypt bury me in the message of the hour bury me where the Holy Ghost is provided when the Holy Ghost is preached in the Pulpit Pastor lead me to the message of the hour preach me the reveal word for my day because that's where my promise is Oh Glory to God I feel good I I don't know if somebody's catching this this message belongs to you it's not just a movement it's a life Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory you know those seals are broken because those seals is about Christ is revealing Christ that's why the prophet would say this Bible becomes a new book why is it becoming this book is Christ so people did not know what this Bible spoke about they were reading it they were just probing at things but God had to send a message he had to send a message so that we can you know the word can be interpreted to us remember it was in mamb where Abraham met eloh him in human flesh you remember that the C of MP was W in remember that's where Abraham saw Elohim in human flesh you have seen Elohim in human flesh how many of us have seen that Discerning the thought of Sarah it says you came from this city this is
