Father we have to be here for such a time as this. But Lord [music] God we want to lift up our hands and know that our redemption drawing nigh. So God, we just ask your special blessing to come in our [music] midst. Lord, father, almighty God, we pray for our sister Sharon.

[music] Such oh God, Father, and the service, the weekend, Lord God, with brother Farmer, [music] we just love you, God. What an awesome God you are. What a wonderful father. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. How much time we have? The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Thank you, musicians. Uh the worship was wonderful this morning. I came in to worship and the song leader saw me and he said, "We should end the worship." But I just came to to worship. Praise the Lord. I just came to get under that anointing so I can be able to flow with it. So we thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord. We continue to pray that the Lord will keep helping our brother, brother Lawrence. &gt;&gt; And uh uh sometimes I see his courage. He pick up a song uh that he's been practicing and try to bring it and then uh it's not working well and and you know it's okay, let's leave it. Let's go to the next one. Praise the Lord. So we just pray that the Lord will help our brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And again, we want to greet everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus. What can we say about the service on Wednesday night? Amen. It was beautiful. Praise the Lord. Our brother uh traveled to u uh Ohio. He's preaching for brother Charlan this morning and then he leave back to Germany uh uh tomorrow. So uh it was it was good to meet him. It was very very good. especially for me. Amen. I had the best part of it because since he came in on uh Tuesday, we just we just we just had a good time to spend together, visit with one another, get to know one another, talk. I mean, it was just we just took up right from there. Right from there, we just took up. Praise the Lord. Because it happens there. Uh we have many acquaintance, you know. He sent me the picture when he got to the airport. Um and then he's standing with Ruben Dius and his wife, they were my host uh the first time in South Africa 2004. [clears throat] So I thought he just came from South Africa. So uh when when I pick him up, I says, "Oh, you just came from He said, "No, I would just send you a picture so you can you can put a face to the name." I said, "Oh, well, you send me the the picture of my host. Those are my host." "Oh, you know them." And then we just started right from there. Praise the Lord. But the service was wonderful. a little bit different but it was wonderful. Uh all of God's children uh are very very very unique very unique in their way. Amen. But I think one thing we can learn and and the the beautiful thing that also was about the service is that let's go to the book of Colossian. We're not we're not starting our reading yet, but uh uh um this was where brother Farmer read from uh on on Sunday morning. That was where he read from and and that was that was the part of the service that really that really uh you know intrigued me. It got my attention because I just felt like okay I think the Lord is dealing with us here. Praise [clears throat] the Lord. I feel like the Lord is dealing with us. Oh, praise the Lord. He read from uh chapter one. Amen. Okay. Uh let's read from verse 12. This was where he read from on on Sunday morning when he preached to us. And strange enough, he never even gave a a a title to his subject. He just, you know, uh went into the testimony about his mother coming in the prayer line in uh message uh uh uh spiritual food in due season and talked about his healing and he just went on from there. So he really didn't give his his title to his sermon. So I was looking it up and I think what they did was they took the title from the Sunday school and make make it sermon. So that was good. Amen. So if you look online it will be only believe. Now, so from verse uh 12, giving thanks unto the Father, which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who have delivered us from the power of darkness. That's very powerful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us. Now if you watch when brother FMA preach he will say uh this word was the same word that was used for Enoch. Enoch was translated. &gt;&gt; So actually the message he was preaching was actually around translation around the rapture. &gt;&gt; And here is uh brother uh uh uh uh Andre comes on on uh Wednesday night and he preaching to us rapture ready. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But with this scripture, we can know that we are rapture ready &gt;&gt; because what is happening here is that he has delivered us from the power of darkness. Not only that we are delivered but we have been translated. &gt;&gt; We have been moved under another headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have been moved on under another headship. So we are completely under a new government. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has delivered us from the power of darkness. Translated us into the kingdom of his dear son &gt;&gt; in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of our sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just thought that was just a perfect connection and I mean I was just I was just enjoying his time of of bringing the word. He's a He's a man that is uh as we talk a little bit. I mean, he likes he likes the rubber to meet the road. He likes uh things to be real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he was he was trying to make us to know it was beautiful. And it's truth. You read the Bible. After Elijah came from out of that anointing, he went straight into depression. And he never got out of it until he was raptured. That's truth. Brother Bannon said it. He went in and out of depression. You know, uh the effect of the anointing and and and and you see that it's so bad. They're so bad. the the tapoo. One of the vision of the tapoo, brother Brandham says uh you know that that part of vision where they were trying to he trying to lace the shoes and God says you cannot teach Pentecost of people &gt;&gt; you know supernatural things &gt;&gt; and that and that is the place where we are you we we finding ourselves in this time where many preachers are running to divine healing. We are we are streaming after divine healing. you know, we want this vedication that I prayed for this person and they were well, you know, and I pray for this person and they were well, but uh if you if you really watch that is that the the healing is still in the camp, &gt;&gt; but it's not the major thing that God is doing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Healing is still in the camp, but it's not the major thing that God is doing. The major thing that God is doing is getting you rapture ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting our state of mind in a place because if you if you really look at it since you will realize that there is no age that is ever like our age. &gt;&gt; You would not imagine the things that we are dealing with in this age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot imagine the things that we you are we are dealing with with in this age. But you see because we have lived here I don't know I know my age I don't know yours but for how many years I have been here it is how many years that you have been dealing with that right from the mother's womb &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; we are dealing with every form of pressure so you see the word the message of the hour is to set our mind to understand the time we are living in what we are dealing with and what god God is doing in us. &gt;&gt; He's not bringing this flesh to perfection. &gt;&gt; He's bringing your spirit to understand &gt;&gt; the grace that has been given to you for this hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I I just thought that that was that was very beautiful. &gt;&gt; That was very very very beautiful. the the two witnesses in Jerusalem like he typed Moses and Elijah they are a type of a rapture but they were dead they were killed in the street before their body was raptured &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; so I thought it was beautiful Amen he he traveled and touched me yesterday that he he got back and he talked to Ohio sibling and and really really expressed how much he enjoyed the fellowship. Uh amen how much he enjoyed uh uh the quality of uh of the reception of the word. You know when the preacher is preaching he uh he can feed you. &gt;&gt; He can feel that you are receiving him. He can feel that you are resenting him. He really testify that he really fed at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; He fed at home and and uh and so much there. He he asked me he says he said brother one I was thinking to preach something for brother Chab but I'm going to preach exactly what I preach at your place because I I I just found a channel and I felt that it was good. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to preach there. He says on the voice he says if you will allow me I don't know if I have the authority but praise the Lord. But uh in saying that also is is at a place where uh you know we must we must commend you and uh and commend ourself uh that uh uh you know the Lord has given us the grace to be able to labor together like I've always said there's one responsibility that we have is the atmosphere here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every one of us that walks through that door are responsible for what happened here during the service. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I think it's a beautiful thing. Uh uh it does not uh it does not have to do with the crowd. It does not have to do with our our it's just it's it's just our expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The expectation we bring to church, the readiness and and also we are here because you can be here and not here. &gt;&gt; But we want you to be here. Amen. We want you to be here. Don't don't leave your body with us and go shopping with your spirit. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh if you do that, we'll take the rapture and then you get back in just a dead body you meet. &gt;&gt; So we are very very grateful this morning. Very very grateful this morning. I don't have a lot of u uh uh prayer leads that came through the text. I'm sure There's a whole lot there. But uh uh of those uh believers in in Nigeria that were kidnapped uh a text message came uh they all were released. So they went back to their family. We just want to thank the Lord for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let's just stand to uh stand on our feet and we will go to the book of Isaiah. We go to the book of Isaiah. Praise the Lord. We go to the book of Isaiah chapter 10. Isaiah chapter 10. Let's read verse 27. And I will have you to take your seat. and I will go back to the beginning of the chapter and read what I want to read because I want to use that to be able to set the stage of what I want to express this morning. Amen. Verse 27. And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder. His burden shall be taken off thy shoulder, and his yoke from of thy neck, and the yoke shall dis shall be destroyed because of the anointing. Strange enough, when brother Lawrence was studying the song service, he said this, the anointing will break the yoke. I said, well, okay, I think we we are on the same page now. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we want to ask your blessing, Lord, on the service this morning, Lord God, as we go into your word. We'll go back now, Father, as at the beginning of the chapter, but just help us, Lord, to just be able to grab the context. So, Father, we love you and we appreciate you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can have a seat. Let's go back to uh the beginning of the chapter. We could start from verse five. But uh uh I I would jump few verses but I just I just want for us to be able to grab uh the context here. Verse one, woe unto them that decreed on unrighteous decree and that right grievousness which they have perceived to turn aside the needed to to turn aside the needed from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may may be afraid and that they may rob the fatherless. Let's drop down to verse five. The picture really starts to build from there. Oh Assyan, the rod of my anger. Now God is referring to this foreign nation to this hidden nation that they are the rod of his anger. They are a whip in his hands. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I want us to see the picture now. Uh ohans the rod of of my anger and the staff in their hand is my indignation. So whatever staff, sword, uh armor they are using, God is saying is my judgment, is my indignation. I will send him. I will send Assyrian against an hypocritical nation, which is Israel. And against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spo and to to take the pray and to tread tread them down like the m of the street the m of the street. How be it he mean not so neither does his heart think so. Now think about this. Now God is saying that I'm I'm I'm using the appearance as a rod in my hands. But listen to this verse. How be your soul? He meetth now. So his heart tinkketh now. So he he really don't have the heart to be able to do such a wickedness. That's where now you're going to see where the anointing comes in because God is saying I'm going to use a syrup. meaning that I'm going to anoint them to do this. They don't have the heart to do it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; How be it he meetth so neither does his heart think so. But it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations, not a few. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I want to drop down a little bit here. Okay. Uh let's go down now. Okay. Let's go down to verse uh 14. For my hand has f has found as uh a nest of of riches of the people and as one gathering eggs that are left. Have I gather all the earth and there was none that move the wind or open the mouth of Pet shall the axe. Okay. Yeah. Verse 15. That's what I wanted to get to actually. Now, shall the axe boast itself against him that that held that hel or shall the sword magnify itself against him that shaketh it? Or as as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up. or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood. Now, so God is saying now because you're coming to see where the picture will be here. He's saying that just like this vowing cannot lift itself up and play. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So neither can the roar lift itself up and fight, the staff cannot just get up and start killing. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? Okay. Verse 16. Therefore shall the Lord the Lord of host sent among among his fat ones leaners and under his glory he shall candle uh a burning like the burning of fire. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Verse 17. And the lights of Israel shall be for a fire in his holy one, for a flame, and it shall burn in the hall with tongues and with birth in one bang. Now, so when you read carefully, when you read carefully, I think I might have skipped the verse, but where I'm trying to get to here is that God from the beginning said he was going to use the searing as a rod in his hands. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then if you read there carefully, I'm trying to craft the verse because uh that's not where I want to do it, but I just wanted to use it as a picture because we're going to talk about the anointing and and uh okay, let's let's let's drop down a little bit. Okay, the verse is stay ahead of me. The verse is stayed ahead of me. This uh that verse 24. Therefore, thus say the Lord God of hosts, oh my people that dwelleth in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, he he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of Egypt. for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and my anger in their destruction and the Lord of hosts shall strip up uh escort for him I calling to the slaughter. Now so what is happening yet is that God is saying I'm going to use these people but again I'm going to turn around because they were just a whip for me to be able to discipline my children. But I'm going to turn around and destroy them. And the reason is because they thought that they were doing it. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the principle? &gt;&gt; Now think about it, okay? A good picture here will be Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; He was just like just like the Assyrian. God used him as a whip. But when he took it to himself, that see all of these things that my hand has done. &gt;&gt; He went seven years like a beast. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went seven year like a beast. So uh uh the principle there that we want to we want to look at here is that uh uh in in in a message perfect fit brother Brandon said in many places but right here I have this one. He said but he cannot fail. So as long as we are trying in ourself and depending on our own abilities and so forth why we will do nothing but when we but when we get to a place where we know we are nothing then God can use us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh whether the heathens, whether the believers, God don't want us to depend on our ability. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and the the the major thing with my mindset here this morning is that it will not take our ability to put us in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not take our ability to overcome in this age. We will have to rely on the anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we want to start our subject. We've been talking from uh uh uh Revelation chapter 4, five, and six. And uh the the the the beasts and the rather that's what we've been we've been we've been dwelling on. [clears throat] And then when these brothers comes, they preach wonderful messages. you just you almost want to leave your subject and follow him, but you have to stay where you want to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I will read from uh the the the fifth seal [snorts] this morning. That's where my inspiration is coming from from the fifth seal. Brother Brandham says here don't forget this church and you brethrens on tape. We are the one. I want you to examine this. How could men do anything else beside the power of God that has been released to them? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How can a man do anything? How can a woman do anything? How can a bride do anything? How can the children of God do anything in this age than the power that is released to them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I'm going to set uh this box up here to represent it." He's trying to uh build an image. Now, if God send a certain spirit among them, that's the only thing that they can the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and uh and and the power that let loose. Now, watch exactly the church responding to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else. &gt;&gt; We cannot do nothing else but to respond. to the anointing of our age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot do anything beyond that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Anything we trying to do beyond that, we only using our ability and pretty soon we will fail. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If we try to do anything more than that, you see and and and that's the reason why the uh uh uh you know the the the cult the brother introduces thought the rapture will just be a normal routine. It's not going to be an extraordinary thing in uh uh what they did in South Africa having people to to go in a bush and and everybody going on top of the mountain and uh uh uh looking to the heavens and uh it's just going to be a normal routine. Two will be in bed, &gt;&gt; one will be taken, one will be left. Two will be in the field working, one will be taken, one will be left. It will just be a normal routine. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you read that quote, it says that uh uh brother Brandham says it will be a normal routine as we scripturally follow the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which mean as we are just scripturally living living we just living our simple Christian life. We are not putting up a show. We're not trying to impress anybody. We are just living our simple Christian life. Believing trusting in God. Amen. And just seeing how he's dealing with us. &gt;&gt; Responding to the anointing. That's what I'm I want to preach. I'm I'm speaking on this morning. The church responding to the anointing. And she can do nothing else. She can do nothing else but to respond to the anointing. You try to get away from it, God will drag you by the feet. &gt;&gt; If he got to pull you by the ear, if you got to come in by the skin of your teeth, he would do it because you are you are predestinated to to to respond to the anointing of this hour. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, I I I will prove it to you by history of the church and by the opening of the seals, the power that let loose and watch exactly the church responding to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else. Now the first was the lion. Praise the Lord. The lion that roar that pure unadulterated word. The second in territorial was ox. Terrier age was not the second age but the second anointing came in territorial age. Why? Because the first three church ages were under the first anointing. We've been we've been over there going over there. The first three church ages were under the lion anointing. So that's what he's he's saying here. The first anointing was the lion that pe on adultery word. And then the second interior was the ox. He says it was a burden, the beast of burden. Pardon me. He says it was a sacrificial beast. And wasn't that exactly exactly the poor little church room has scattered down to a thousand years of dark age and everything that they didn't profess to be to be of the Roman church was put to death immediately. What did they do? They were they willingly walk up there and die. They were responding to their anointing. &gt;&gt; They did it joyfully. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They did it joyfully. They were responding to the anointing. Our re our first reaction would be to run away. Why? Because the eagle loves to fly. [laughter] Praise the Lord. Our first respond would be, "Oh my god, what's happening? you start trying to to see if your wings are tied. What did they do? They willingly walk up there and die. They didn't put Kier because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrificed labor. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Labor. They knew it was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was the anointing that was on the church and they could do nothing else but to respond to that anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The anointing on this church is to be in the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we must be center on the word. We're not following emotion. We're not trying to copy another church and copy what God is doing. So no, no, we must stay with the word because we want to be is to be in the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; They willingly walk up there and died and and and they didn't but but uh but care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrificed labor. They walk up just as freely as they could walk anointed with the spirit of God of that age and die like heroes. &gt;&gt; They die like heroes. They die singing songs because it was the anointing that was on them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I just I I I just want to to set this uh uh uh from the beginning before we uh we we take off here. That that that that was the anointing that was on the that was on the church. They died a hero, a sacrifice. Thousand times thousand 68 million of them on the record ox sacrifice. Oh mind. Do you understand now? Sacrifice is it only could labor in that age. It can only labor. It was only laboring in that age. This age is to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reason why all of these uh uh self affliction and self starving to get more power from God and you just go on hunger strike. It does not work. &gt;&gt; It does not work. I'm not weeping away fasting and praying. Fasting and praying is just a normal thing. It must be a normal thing like you coming to church. It must not be like seeking for some kind of a extra ordinary power because it does not work. What what is happening here is that the anointing for this age is to come up higher. This bride got to be a mature bride in the word &gt;&gt; that when we have when we have situation and circumstances in our life if a person is sick their first mind will not be what sin did I committ it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; their first thought would be Lord let me glorify you in this trial give me the strength &gt;&gt; that my faith would not get weak But what what what we do I mean it's it's it's a Pentecostal thing for us to start looking for uh uh the cause of the sickness. Where is the curse coming from? You know what our parent did something wrong and and and we then we go all through this all all through that &gt;&gt; as if to say we have not received a prophet we have not received the word. The church must be mature that when we have situation in our life, we have situation in our home. You must realize that UH YOU HAVE THIS BODY THAT HAVE h all your senses &gt;&gt; and YOU ALSO HAVE EXPERIMENT. THAT'S WHY Paul call it experiment. YOU HAVE A DUAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A DUAL LIFE TO MAINTAIN. YOUR PHYSICAL LIFE COULD BE VERY POOR AND UNHEALTHY WHILE YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE can be strong. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And a person can ALSO BE SO BRIGHT AND AND AND and and prosper and blessed in his physical life while their SPIRITUAL LIFE IS DEAD AND POOR. &gt;&gt; How are we keeping the balance? Eagle have two wings. &gt;&gt; You can't only fly with one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We must get oursel from out of this death mar. Brother Brandham said it's a death mar to just be keep going around the same cycle. We must understand that God is moving. He's not going around. &gt;&gt; He's moving. He's moving forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we must move forward with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You father in the church word they put a whole ladder on, you know, pray pray fast pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray and there is just no balance in the word. You don't have a good prayer life if you are not reading the word. No, you don't have a good prayer life. If I would say in another way is that you becoming too noisy and irritated to God because you becoming this person that is talking, talking, talking and never giving him a chance to talk back to you. &gt;&gt; You doing all the talking. &gt;&gt; A good prayer life IS A LIFE THAT IS BALANCED IN PRAYER and in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because as you are talking to him, you also allowing him to speak to you through the word, &gt;&gt; through the preaching, THROUGH THE TAPES, WHATEVER. BUT YOU WANT HIM TO SPEAK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why Brandon says the church treating God as an errand boy. They just want to tell him, "DO THIS FOR ME. GO LORD. GO LORD." YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD PRAYER life if you really not seizing in the word. If you are not meditating. If you are not a line law speak to me this scripture I'm reading let something come out of it &gt;&gt; that speak to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church can do nothing but respond to her anointing. Amen. Praise the Lord. All sacrifice. Oh my God. Do you understand that? Now sacrifice is the it only could labor in that age to combat the great opposition for that 1,000 years. Now you will see that uh uh look at it this way. Look at it this way. Here are the the believers being persecuted and uh and and being killed. We were taken for weakness. We were taken for the church being defeated. But Brandon says that was where that that great critics that wrote the book on the silent god. That's where he took his inspiration from and he wrote he says where is God? You were silent and they killing the we were taken for weakness. But for God, he anointed his people to go through that. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were anointed to go through that. It was their season. It was what God wanted. And it was, the Bible says, precious. Precious in the sight of the Lord. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Is the death of the saint. &gt;&gt; What what what make the death of the saint precious? It's not the way they are killed. It's the way they are behaving &gt;&gt; in death. &gt;&gt; The way they are behaving &gt;&gt; in death. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DYING, THEIR SICKNESS IS EATING THEIR BODY UP, but their heart is saying blessed be the name of the Lord. EVEN THOUGH YOU SLAY ME, I will praise you. &gt;&gt; That's what is precious in death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the dying, it's the attitude. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Precious in the sight of the Lord &gt;&gt; is the death of the saints." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham lay down quickly warning before Joshua. He learned it very quickly. He's praying for someone and and uh and you know the person came and gave back their heart back to the Lord and you know he told the told the church the you know uh uh I mean told the the family you know the the person will be healed. Yeah. They got healed. They give their heart back to the Lord and and then they die. He went before God and says Lord why? He says that person just moved before me and I said to say shut up your mouth. Who are you to ask me why I could have take her when she was backslided? Now she has come back to the Lord. That is the good time to take her. You see our mind is just is just we we are so affected church whether we like it or not. This the the the Roman stain that has been the Catholic stain that has been on the church will we will battle with it until we leave from here. &gt;&gt; Catholism and denomination has abused our mind. that for us to really understand the way that God is, we always falling back to the way the church understand it. We will take that for defeat, but for God it's not defeat. Praise the Lord. It's not defeat to for God. HE SAID YOU HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD fight of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. While we will be here crying, oh Lord, Lord, Father, we prayed, we fasted, Lord, we asked you, we were, we were begging you. And because in our mind, we in our mind, we are this poor children. That in our mind, everything we ask the father, it must be yes. &gt;&gt; No. In God's mind, it's not like that. He don't want us to be spoiled. He want us to be disciplined. &gt;&gt; Amen. for us to understand that he has a yes and he has a no. &gt;&gt; To every yes there's a no. &gt;&gt; If God said no to you, can you tell him thank you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you are you are you are so disciplined and [clears throat] understand his ways that if he say no to you, you can say thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; You can say thank you with the same smile like you would say thank you if it was a yes. That's where he's getting us to. That's that's where he's getting us to. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then he gets down to the tear beast that went forth out from the devil was this black black hery. Now the ter beast that went out a power from God to come back him to come back that power of the black house was was a man a coning smart wisdom with the wisdom of God. The anointing was a man. It was the man age. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a manage I say some things here this morning that will maybe just slap you on your face a little bit but I don't know how much shakuba you have. Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know how much shaka you have but uh let's uh he says that the the the ter was the man. So, uh, uh, Emanuel, if you could just pull my image up a little bit. Let's, uh, let's follow. Okay, this is the picture that we've been we've been working with uh uh through our entire uh, series here. So we have the the the full anointing on this side. Uh and then we have the full evil power on this side. You see the darkness coming from the bottleless PP and it's it's dealing with this. And so we we uh uh that's what we were dealing with. That's the image we were dealing with. But I tried to I try to look for another one. So uh let's let's see if the other one will will explain a little more to us now. So, uh we have the lion year. So, in the under the lion we see there we had the three church ages and this is the the the white horse rather that was traveling with a bow and no arrow. So he he was operating through these three church ages. Now you have to realize that on the Bible says that uh he has a bow no arrow but then he was given a crown. Now so we explained that how that the the trinitarian doctrine was introduced here. It went through these ages and it got a crown. Amen. Brother B say it just started from a thought that that was looking like a good thought. It became a deed and it was established as a doctrine. So it it went through all of these three church ages. So in the quote here, brother Brandon used territoriing the second beast. It was right here. That's the that's the uh uh the ox the ox anointing. And uh uh it's right here in the dark age. And uh it has the red horse rather uh which u the Bible you know, he was his killing. And then so we have uh uh the tail one here supposed to be a man. I think the picture is on the next one is on the next one just because of uh the position of the man because when you look at let's go let's go back to the first uh the the first picture. Uh yeah. So when you look at when you look at it here in in many in many cases the lion did the the first three the ox the the man anointing operated in the last three church ages. Okay. The eagle anointing came at the end of the laudish church age. Are we together? It came at the end of the laudisha church age and and gave that call of come out of her my people. So the eagle anointing is actually not an anointing for the Laian church age. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The man's anointing operated the three church ages. The eagle anointing came and took the church from the the the end of the laudish church age into what we can call the bride age &gt;&gt; an eternal age the age of the open the open book. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture &gt;&gt; now? So so uh uh yeah then go back go back to the to to that. I I thought that using the the the parame will will explain it better. Let's go back to the next picture now. So So uh okay. Yeah. Yes. The man's anointing here uh uh that uh was over the you know the the three church ages. The eagle's anointing come at the end of the age and then uh it goes right into the rest of it. Go back to the first picture. Not the one. No, not this one. Okay, go back to this one now. So, uh uh we talking about the church responding to her anointing and she cannot do anything else but respond to the anointing that is given to us in this age. Now you have to know that uh all of these anointing all of these anointing uh uh it is not just a feeling you know it's not just a feeling that I feel good or you know I enjoy the service or no it was it was what God gave it was it was the it was the power that was given by God to be able to fight against the power the evil power that was in that age. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if you go to Revelation chapter 6, let's go to Revelation chapter 6. While the picture stay up there, don't go to the scripture. If you have your Bible, you turn there. If you don't have your Bible, then you're just listening. while the picture stays up there. Revelation chapter 6. Are we together? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6, let's read from verse one. And I saw the lamb open one of the seal. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts. Now I'm not uh I'm not I'm not adequate to represent the lamb, but because I'm preaching, let me be the lamb. Okay. the lamb the the the the Bible will be the seal book. So the lamb open open the seal and John says he heard like a thunder but what was thundering was one of this anointing that was tonering and saying come and see. Praise the Lord. So the lamb had the book, the seal book in his hands, but it was the anointing that was identifying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing, that's the reason why Bern Brand says to overcome is to identify the enemy in his tricks. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it is not you that is identifying. You don't have the power. You don't have the ability. You don't. Sometimes the devil come, he finish doing his work before we even know that he visited our home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember now Jesus said the enemy comes to do what? &gt;&gt; And destroy. Now this is this is the Messiah. This is our Lord trying to tell us. He comes to do that. And because that's what he comes TO DO. SO GOD GIVES an anointing in an age that will be able to grab him right-handed. &gt;&gt; You see, so the lamb open the book as he's opening the book now. So watch now is the principle to overcome because we cannot overcome in our ability. &gt;&gt; We can only overcome when we hear the thunder from the anointing from the beast that say come and see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we hear it and we receive it AND THEN WE ALSO come and see. So he said come and see. And I saw John now representing the bride. You are John which I'm part of. I'm I'm representing the lamb that has the book and the Holy Ghost is the anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the first three church ages was the lion's anointing. &gt;&gt; So when he called and said, "Come and see." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So John REPRESENTING THE BRIDE, JOHN REPRESENTING THE CHURCH RESPONDED TO THAT ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. when he when they responded TO THE ANOINTING, HOW did they responded to the anointing? BY BY RECOGNIZING THAT BAPTISM IS NOT IN FATHER, SON, and holy ghost. Baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the way they responded to the anointing. THEY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH CHRIST IN their age. THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT CALL THEMSELVES JEWS AND they were n. They kicked them out of the church. WHY? WHY WERE THEY DOING THAT? THEY WERE RESPONDING TO THE ANOINTING of their age. &gt;&gt; It's not a guess work. &gt;&gt; It's not a brainstorming work. &gt;&gt; It's a heart that is obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know [snorts] as much as we know that as much as this is an anointing, this is also an anointing. &gt;&gt; Just realize that this is an anointing. &gt;&gt; It's a very strong anointing. This is the This is the SPIRIT THAT PLANTED THE TRINITARIAN DOCTRINE THAT IS SO HARD TO GET RID OF. &gt;&gt; WITH ALL THE REVIVAL AND ALL THE MEN THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REALLY REALIZE THAT A seed was planted. &gt;&gt; It's an anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is not how I feel or because you know I I I really feel good. This can also make you feel good. &gt;&gt; It can also make you feel good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How do we respond to the anointing of our age? Bring it back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring it back to the word. Let it line up with the word. &gt;&gt; Not what the church says and what uh the bishop said, but let it line up with the word. &gt;&gt; That is the way we respond to our anointing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see here the lamb held the book. The anointing said come and see. This was what said come and see for the first three ages. This was what said come and see for the dark age. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the people hear the anointing and they and they responded to the anointing, the anointing anoint them for the age. &gt;&gt; So you see the whole thing there is that God is weaping away our abilities. &gt;&gt; HE WANT US TO FULLY TRUST in him. &gt;&gt; Come with me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; COME WALK ME. HE WANT US TO FULLY TRUST IN HIM. NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH, NO MATTER WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND US, &gt;&gt; we have a city of refuge. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have a city of refuge. I think it was brother brother Farmer that was saying that and that was beautiful. It's true. The city of refuge was well maintained. It was wellmaintained. The roads were bigger. The bridge were taken care of every year. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they even hide gas. They had gas on the road on on the road of the city of the refuge to be able to help a man that was running. A man that needed help. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have people that were posted on the C TO HELP HIM GET there quickly. Is that not what the cherub beans are doing to guide us to the tree of life to help him get there quickly? Amen. &gt;&gt; The road was clean that there will be no obstacle. There will BE NOTHING TO STOP US TO RUN FOR HELP when we need help &gt;&gt; because God is not depending on your ability. &gt;&gt; He want you to trust him. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; The church responded to her to her anointing that she grew up. Like I said in previous service, we are under the influence of this anointing. When brother Brandon preached the message influence for many years, for many years and even till now when we when we read the message influence, we preach the message influence. We only look at the influence of Yuzia on Isaiah. We don't look at the influence of the angels. The influence of Yuzia on Isaiah that was the first influence he was under that his natural birth influence. UNDER OUR NATURAL BIRTH WE ARE UNDER THE influence of our parents, the influence of our bus, the influence of culture, the influence OF A TRIBE, WHATEVER IT IS. BUT WHEN ISAIAH CAME INTO THE TEMPLE, &gt;&gt; HE WAS UNDER ANOTHER INFLUENCE. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HE GOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANGELS. HE SAYS THAT DREAM FILLED THE TEMPLE AND I mean he WAS SO CAUGHT UP LEFT THE EARTH CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THOSE angels because he was under their influence. It affected him so much he said won't talk a code of fire and come and touch. So you see we we we just stick on that and and we talk about influence of one man on upon another and AND IT JUST SO BOUND BUT WE don't really see the the the LESSON THAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS TRYING to bring to us that THERE WAS A CHANGE OF INFLUENCE. &gt;&gt; There is A TIME IN OUR LIFE WHERE GOD TAKE US FROM A NATURAL INFLUENCE AND HE BRINGS US on a supernatural influence. the influence of the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are under the influence of seven angels. We are not under a man influence. He can be a bishop, a pastor, or whoever he is. We are under the INFLUENCE OF THOSE ANGELIC BEINGS &gt;&gt; THAT open the seals &gt;&gt; that reveal the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until you give us the word, we will not BE SATISFIED. DON'T GIVE US YOUR ideas or your feelings. JUST SEND US BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because that's the influence the bride is honor. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus. What an awesome God we serve. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve in the message. Junction of time. We can take take the picture from there. Keep it. We'll use it another time. Junction of time. Brother Brandham says and he says now the church today &gt;&gt; is now only having miracles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But sad enough that's what the church want. The church only want to have miracles. &gt;&gt; But he says we're not only having miracles but we are miracles ourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not only having miracles but is preparing for a miracle and that is the coming of the Lord. and the rapture of the church to be taken up. Give me the church ready. Visualize to see the signs and and and to see the unimportant God, the great power of God moving among the people which the rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus come. It will be an easy thing. Praise the Lord. But then see see where the catch is here because because if it is said that to see the signs and the unimportant of God and the great power of God moving among the people, we always think that great power of God is just something happen that would just be making us to be jumping up. &gt;&gt; That great power of God is what sustaining you every day. As you go out into this Laian word with all the evil, the nastiness that is out there is that great power of God that is keeping you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's why the rapture will be easy because we have come to the acknowledgment that he is the one that is keeping me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Where I get the strength from to get back to church, he is the one. &gt;&gt; Where I get the strength from to do the things that I know is right to do, he is the one. &gt;&gt; Is that great power of God in simplicity? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus. What a blessed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's look at a quote here in in paradise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what is it? What is it? Christ coming to his body. Christ is the word. Amen. We all know the anointing is Christ [snorts] that comes to that comes on the word that makes the word live. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Simple example. Jesus was born the word and that word was a virgin shall conceive. Are we together? On the river Jordan, Christ came upon the word. You see the picture? &gt;&gt; John said, "I see a dove landing on him." So Christ came upon a word to take the word into his commission. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was born the word. A virgin shall conceive. was the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But before he could go into his ministry, Christ must come upon the word to make the word live. You will realize the Bible says uh uh he will be called Jesus. He never put Christ in. &gt;&gt; Amen. to take away the sins of the word is a part that he will be f fulfilled that he will fulfill but before he fulfilled that he needed the word needed to be anointed the word need an anointing is the same way that there was a word that was spoken for this age and God says I will get a bride with spot or wrinkle. The word was there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will call out a people from out of the Gentiles. That is the word. That is a prophecy from Amos. Amos started prophesying about that before even the the the disciple came along and took him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's thy word that has fleshed us out. We believe the message. We believe that yeah there there's a gentile bride but for that word to now goes into action you need to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says we agreeing we must still HONOR THE SON SO we can be repping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word the the anointing of the word will make the the life of Christ in you. We will not be going out looking for our own firm and and and and and you know uh uh praises of man but it will be everything of Christ. &gt;&gt; We know that the word that makes uh he says that we know that we we we all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That is the anointing. Christ is the anointing, the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To make it live. Now the word is in your heart. &gt;&gt; You believe in divine healing. You believe in rapture. You believe in sanctified life, overcoming life. The word is in your heart. Whatever more see Christ the anointing comes upon his body. The connection there. He is the head. We are the body. So Christ the anointing comes upon the body. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To quicken the word that has been prophesied for us &gt;&gt; in our day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The word that has been prophesied for us in in in our lives. So Christ comes upon it just like husband and wife to become one. Now the church has got has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one. He can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible &gt;&gt; is all yours. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is promised at this age is yours. &gt;&gt; When we when we leave anything out, then if anointing strikes that, it will anoint it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What? What? What an awesome God. Are you Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? There is there is that's the reason why we can't hurry the rapture. The rapture is not an escape plan. No, it's not an escape plan. It's not to escape temptation. &gt;&gt; I just wish the rapture come now. It's not going to come with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not an escape route. No, &gt;&gt; it's it's it's another program. It's a wonderful thing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing because in God's mind, the rapture is the vehicle that takes us to the reception. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the vehicle that takes and that's what the bride waits for. She wants to for everybody to see her leaving. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody standing in the parking lot and just see them leaving. So it's not an escape something &gt;&gt; that we have to be craving for the rapture so we can get up from here or tire with this word. No, &gt;&gt; it's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whether we are alive, whether we we are dead, praise the Lord, for the dead in Christ will rise first and we all will partake of the beauty of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean that's that's that's where you will realize uh the the the power that is invested in you or the power that been lied in you d by all these years because finally we we will have the power to overcome sin. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the church. Honor her anointing. She can do nothing less. Let's take this thought also from the word is falling apart. Now, anything that pulls you away from that is wrong. Anything that pulls you away from the word is wrong. Praise the Lord. That's a false messiah. That's a false anointing. Pray. Oh, he said the brother has such an anointing. What kind of an anointing it was? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to realize the uh the Bible says that uh uh Jews brought this out. He says Cororan and Dton, they were men that that have the anointing of a gainer. &gt;&gt; A gainser is is a is a person that can that can convince the whole crowd just just by one speech. &gt;&gt; Logical. Praise the Lord. Logical. It's logical. What what they were saying is logical. We are also Levites. &gt;&gt; We are Levites. Kora was a Levite. &gt;&gt; Dayton was a Levite. &gt;&gt; They are saying we are Levite. Moses and Aaron are Levite. Why should be them &gt;&gt; and not us? Is it not logical? &gt;&gt; If we are all children of Levites, we must all be equal. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT. &gt;&gt; WELL, everything is just Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron. That was convincing. &gt;&gt; But it cost the life of millions of people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the earth opened &gt;&gt; and swallowed them up. &gt;&gt; So they had an anointing. &gt;&gt; I mean to be able to convince half of the camp, &gt;&gt; it takes an anointing. It just does not take a a sweet talking. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that what I'm saying is that just like there is an anointing here for us to respond to, there is also an anointing to distract us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is an anointing here for us to to respond to, FOR US TO RELY ON. BUT THERE IS also an anointing working among us to distract us. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He said what kind of anointing it is. He said Hitler had an anointing. All of this men uh uh Pope Pas had an anointing. &gt;&gt; What kind of an anointing you got? &gt;&gt; If it's not anointed with the word and vindicated and vindicate every word to be true, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; So what is he simply saying? Bring it back to the word. &gt;&gt; Don't fall for the feelings. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Bring it back to the word. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we that's I mean that's that's exactly where we are. That's where we are. The church responded. If you if you look here, you go back to that quote. Brother Brandon did not say the church responded. He said the church responded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm using it in the present tense because we are here. But with God is something that have already happened. &gt;&gt; The church responded to her to her anointing and she could do nothing else. &gt;&gt; So there is a people. There's a people. That's there there's a word. That's the reason why with with with all the million pieces of different doctrines that have come up all the different teachings that God always find a way &gt;&gt; either by taking the false teacher from off the scene. For a while the people will get confused, they will be discouraged. There is some that will backslide. They will leave. AND AFTER A WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME that will be craving to get back to church. to get back to the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know the story with Elea and Rebecca. Elea spoke so much about Isaac. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT ISAAC that just in that time when when when Rebecca said according to the scripture, WHO IS THAT ON THE FIELD? She never saw Eliza any animal in the picture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that GOD WILL TAKE ALL these main images from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And our focus is going to be on Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He can be your favorite pastor that you ready to die for. God will have to make sure that he take your face from him and keep your eyes on Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT Isaac until from a distance she could recognize him. Praise the Lord. From a distance, SHE HAD A VEIL OVER HER FACE, BUT she could still recognize him. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what God is doing. I believe that's what the Holy Ghost is doing. This bride is anointed to respond to her anointing &gt;&gt; and she can't do anything else. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I encourage you all the time. Watch what God is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In your life. &gt;&gt; Don't think about what you used to be. &gt;&gt; That's a dead hero. That's right. &gt;&gt; That hero is there. And we're talking about present time. What the word is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; What is he taking you to? &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you? The more you start putting attention to that, the more you will see that the curtains will start falling. The curtains will start falling and he's going to pull you right into his presence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that that's the reason why I struggle with the saying when people say let invite the presence of the Lord. You can't you can't. He is the one that is inviting you. &gt;&gt; How can you invite somebody to their house? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I go to your house. I get there before you. Brother Peterson say you come. I said if brother you welcome to your house. &gt;&gt; How can you invite somebody? He is the one that is inviting us. &gt;&gt; As we come into his presence, he's inviting us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said come in more. Come and see more. He's inviting you into his presence. &gt;&gt; HE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST SIT THERE AND AND AND just be observing. Feel free. Move around. There's more room. You can enter in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can go behind the veil. He just don't want you to sit. He want you to participate. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He want you to move around. Ask question. What is this picture? &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; Ask picture. Ask question. Move around and and express the liberty. &gt;&gt; I saw this in the word and uh I you said this and I mean I I couldn't get the connection. Ask question. Just don't sit down there and just and just be satisfied to be preached on. &gt;&gt; NO. GET IN the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That when you get out and and they ask you, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was I was at his house. And how does it look?" Well, I mean, everything everything uh I've went to his house before. He have, you know, I don't even know what that thing mean. I don't know what this thing mean and I don't know what that mean. Praise the Lord. I was talking to somebody in a weekend. I trying to give them a picture for them to see, you know, the the the church. That's that's that those are some of the things that I say Catholicism has has really affected us because you find people that they come to church and then after a while they get they get uh they take offense. This is uh I mean uh uh nobody come nobody nobody of that church ever come to visit me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody come to visit me you know and the people there I mean you know they take off. Now there are two ways you can look at everything. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the thing about it then is that our thing is our responsibility. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here and wherever you go, it's your responsibility to go after what they believe. &gt;&gt; What is it all about? Because because if you unless unless you are just passing by and you just if you want to make the place home there is your responsibility. Don't sit back and say well you know they should come because that's what the church denomination does because we just want your presence or why were you not in church? We didn't see you this Sunday. we really miss you. And that just all the conversation stopped. Well, you know, I never came to church because of this reason or because of that reason. And it just there is no fellowship. &gt;&gt; There is no word in it. &gt;&gt; There is no word. We are just campaigning. &gt;&gt; There just we're just campaigning looking for members. There is no there is really no word in it. I will think that it's our responsibility to be able to go after and says I really want to GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. WHY? WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SAY I MEAN WHY THEY ALWAYS SAY BROTHER Brandham say what is that all about? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHY WHY THEY, you know, why their their women dress this way or their men dress this way. While the service is ordered like that, it's not like every other church. It is our responsibility to go after and know those things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was wanting to come to my defense a little bit, but I'll leave it. I'll leave it for another time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if you ever get mad in your mind and says, "Well, I don't visit you." I mean, you better understand they are tough. It has to be for the reason. I would love to do it. I would love to do it, but it have to be for the reason because there is just there just a whole lot. I'll just leave you as that. [clears throat] I love my brother who says I would love to visit you and just sit down and talk to you, you know, and just spend the whole day with you, but uh uh just have to listen. I want you to just make the list, [clears throat] make the list, have the question, call me some of me. I will show up. If I don't have an answer, I will tell you. We'll look for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it will help me also. They help me for me to grow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the church is responding to her anointing. You have to realize that and you cannot do anything else. Whatever is happening like brother Brandon say Christ is the ministry of God revealed. Whatever is happening around your life that you're not understanding is God pulling you to that place for you to respond to the anointing of your diet. &gt;&gt; And you have to pay attention to that. You may not seem like you are in your best form. It might not look like you are over spiritual. &gt;&gt; But go to your motive energetic. Search your heart. &gt;&gt; Do you still love the Lord? &gt;&gt; If there is if there is if there is that thing there, then there is a deep that is down there that is calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; And sure, there is a deep to &gt;&gt; the Lord bless you. as musicians who can come. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Musicians, you can come. That's the reason why I can't wait for us to for us to be able to build our church and just have a fellowship hall. Amen. we can be able to spend just enough time and get to know one another over meal. That's a good place to know one another. Over meal. Praise the Lord. And I'm sure the Lord will be able to give it to us. Amen. Let's sing that song we sang on Wednesday night. Uh uh uh getting ready to leave. Was that what we sang? &gt;&gt; Getting ready to leave. Is that a song? Ready to leave. Ready to leave. Not getting ready, but ready to leave. Yeah. Am I getting the right name of the song? Okay. Yeah, that's it. Okay.

He has renewing your strength every day. [music] He gave us new mercy. Praise the Lord. And mercy is what we [music] don't deserve. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave you that to be your strength to realize that every what whatever was the foolishness you day before the the day yesterday, he comes [music and singing] down. He gave you new mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To give you strength for you to trust him. To give you strength to face your day. To give you strength [music] to come back to him.
