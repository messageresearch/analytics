[0:01] [Music]
[3:02] I was sort of packed away coming in
[3:05] seeing brother Moore and all of them
[3:06] here on the platform. The friends that
[3:08] I've known for so many years. It's
[3:11] certainly a privilege to see them here
[3:13] tonight. I feel kind of small to stand
[3:15] here and speak with such theologians
[3:17] behind me. And uh maybe they'll correct
[3:21] me when I'm wrong.
[3:23] I hope
[3:25] so. We are very happy tonight to have a
[3:28] certain person here, Sister Rose. We is
[3:33] coming down with brother Shores and his
[3:36] assistant today for a little lunch. And
[3:39] on the road down, Brother Williams said
[3:41] that Sister Rose was very sick. And I we
[3:46] went in to see her just a moment, knelt
[3:48] down, and she had a high fever and
[3:51] really sick. Just a few words of prayer
[3:54] and the Lord spoke to us and said she's
[3:58] going to be healed. Said she'll be there
[4:01] tomorrow night. And here she is tonight
[4:03] sitting right here. That's right. Sister
[4:05] Rose, stand up just a minute. So we're
[4:08] thankful to the Lord. She's bed. She
[4:10] said the devil just beat me out of
[4:12] everything. I come over here and then
[4:13] break down with this uh some kind of a
[4:16] throat disease and so forth, but the
[4:18] Lord has brought her through. So to that
[4:21] we're happy. Yes. Amen. Thanking the
[4:23] dear Lord. Now we've been having
[4:26] wonderful times. And tomorrow night now
[4:28] we go over to the the Ramada. And don't
[4:32] forget now it won't be here tomorrow
[4:34] night. It'll be at the Ramada. And the
[4:36] convention uh begins the next night. Had
[4:39] to put up with me one more night. So
[4:43] last night I uh went so far off a scale
[4:46] I kind of made a little promise to
[4:48] myself that the first of the year that I
[4:50] just go to cut them messages down from
[4:52] three four five hours to maybe along
[4:56] about 30 40 minutes. And as I told you
[4:59] last night my wife commented me Sunday
[5:01] said you did real well. So so and then
[5:05] of course I had to come along last night
[5:07] and ruin it. see
[5:09] about I was 55 minutes instead of 38
[5:12] last night coming down tonight. Billy
[5:15] said, "What are you going to speak on?"
[5:17] I said, "Well, I got a few little notes
[5:20] wrote out here and some scriptures. I
[5:22] don't know some of them." Four or five
[5:24] different messages. I say a few when I
[5:26] get down there and see what's going on.
[5:29] Said, "You promise pray for all them
[5:30] sick people?" I said, "Yes, sir." "How
[5:32] many cards you got?" I said, "200." I
[5:34] said, "I better start on them tonight."
[5:36] And he said, "Now remember, you only get
[5:39] 15 minutes to speak." Said, "You talked
[5:41] the rest of it up last
[5:44] night. But I had to hurry up, won't I?"
[5:48] Well, we are made a promise to you that
[5:52] we would pray for those people who had
[5:54] prayer cards. And we're we're obligated
[5:56] to a promise. Of course, we can't bring
[5:59] them all through these lines.
[6:01] Neither could I be able to call them
[6:03] individually out in the audience. Even
[6:05] though the Holy Spirit would give it to
[6:07] me. I just can't stand to do it. It just
[6:10] too much on me. And uh but we're all
[6:14] acquainted with those things. We know
[6:16] that God's still God. It isn't that that
[6:18] heals. It's that that only builds faith
[6:21] to let us know that that we're in his
[6:24] presence. And we're going tonight to
[6:27] pray for all those sick people. every
[6:29] one of them. It's got those prayer cards
[6:31] to be prayed for. And then tomorrow
[6:33] night over at the rimada, we'll try to
[6:36] give out some more and start praying for
[6:38] them over there because I still have
[6:40] tomorrow night and I think I have one
[6:41] night of the convention maybe of
[6:43] breakfast also. It depends on how things
[6:46] come out. The some of the one of the
[6:48] speakers that never showed up hasn't as
[6:50] yet. I don't think brother Hamburg or is
[6:52] that Hamburg? Hamburger. Hamburger.
[6:56] Cashious hamburger. So I I get it all
[6:59] wrong. That's um that German name. I I
[7:03] guess that's German. So
[7:06] um I may have to kind of pinch hit as we
[7:10] call excuse expression for him. So we've
[7:13] been having a wonderful time in the
[7:15] Lord. Oh to all you be some strangers
[7:19] here tonight. We're sure glad to have
[7:21] you in. Trust that the Lord will bless
[7:23] you. I pray that there won't be any sick
[7:26] people in the building when we leave
[7:28] tonight. That our Lord will come down in
[7:30] his great power and will heal all that's
[7:33] sick and afflicted. Here some time ago,
[7:36] he used to take the individuals in on
[7:38] special interviews, some of the hard
[7:41] cases that we couldn't get through. Then
[7:43] it build up so fast that it got to be
[7:46] the Lord kept blessing it to we got
[7:48] three or 400 on waiting. And so then
[7:51] people get their feelings hurt because
[7:53] that wait maybe on that much time you'd
[7:56] have to wait maybe a year or two so to
[7:58] get into it. See just in between the
[8:00] meetings to take them on the interviews
[8:02] and we just sit and wait on the Lord
[8:04] until he told us just exactly the case.
[8:07] There's no doubt there's people sitting
[8:08] here tonight's been on them special
[8:10] interviews. Israel, let's see you raise
[8:11] your hands on the special interviews.
[8:13] Yes, there's it. So and know that's
[8:16] right. We just wait to see what the Lord
[8:18] would say, what that case. And then I
[8:21] had to stop that here. Some time ago, I
[8:24] told Billy that we couldn't have any
[8:26] more private interviews. See, I I just
[8:29] passed 25 recently, second time, and way
[8:33] up towards the third time.
[8:35] So u as you get a little older while you
[8:38] don't um you somehow can't keep up like
[8:41] you used to your steps shorten and and
[8:44] you of course brother Moore don't know
[8:46] anything about that yet. He's I think
[8:48] we're somewhere around the same
[8:50] age with a lot of waters down the river
[8:53] since you and I and brother Brown come
[8:54] here the first time with brother outlaw
[8:57] and brother Garcia and brother Fuller. I
[9:01] wonder if them man would be in here
[9:02] tonight. Brother Garcia, Brother Fuller,
[9:06] Brother Outlaw. Are they here? Raise up
[9:08] your hands if you are there. Yes,
[9:10] there's Brother Fuller, I believe, if
[9:12] I'm not mistaken. Brother Outlaw over
[9:14] here. Brother Garcia. Uh, I believe, oh,
[9:17] that he left Phoenix. I think that's
[9:18] right. He he left Phoenix and he's over
[9:21] in California. Well, certainly grand
[9:24] days and I still believe the same
[9:27] message I had then. Jesus Christ the
[9:29] same yesterday, today, and forever. I
[9:31] guess that's been about Well, Becky was
[9:33] a baby. That's about 19 years. And now
[9:35] she's a big old fat ugly girl sitting
[9:37] out there somewhere. 19 years old. Where
[9:40] are you,
[9:41] Becky? Boy, she'll get me for
[9:46] that. I remember packing her in on my
[9:49] arm. I'd sure have a job doing that
[9:51] tonight.
[9:54] remember over at brother Garcia's church
[9:56] one night, she's little bitty fella,
[9:58] little and I said, "We have an
[10:00] international meeting tonight." I said,
[10:02] "I'm speaking to the Spanish." And I
[10:05] said, "My wife here is a German." I
[10:08] said, "I'm an Irishman." And I said,
[10:11] "And my little girl's an Indian." And
[10:13] that was Becky. So when I went out the
[10:16] back door, there's a little Mexican girl
[10:18] out there said, "Brother Brandon said,
[10:20] yes, honey. What do you want?" So, don't
[10:22] you think your baby is a bit pale to be
[10:25] an
[10:26] Indian? She's a blonde, you know. And I
[10:28] said, just an Indian in
[10:33] action.
[10:35] Well, we're thankful that to be here
[10:38] again tonight. Now, before we approach
[10:41] the word, let's approach him for he is
[10:44] the word. When the word is made
[10:47] manifest, that's him in you. as we had
[10:51] last night on the seed of discrepancy.
[10:54] Did you appreciate that? The Lord bless
[10:55] me. I I certainly appreciated bringing
[10:58] the message to you and uh we see what
[11:01] the seeds are. Now, is there a special
[11:04] request tonight? Just something special.
[11:07] Maybe some of you all it's going to be
[11:08] in this prayer line. Say, "God, be
[11:10] merciful and I come to be prayed for.
[11:13] Let my faith rise up to meet the
[11:15] conditions." And and maybe somebody's
[11:17] got a loved one sick and and something.
[11:20] Would you just raise your hand so God
[11:22] would just look down and say now if that
[11:24] you don't how that makes me feel to look
[11:26] there just look at the need in here
[11:28] minister brothers just look at that see
[11:30] now if it makes me feel that way what
[11:32] does it do to our father certainly now
[11:36] let us pray dear Jesus we are
[11:39] approaching now the great throne of
[11:41] mercy through this allsufficient name
[11:45] for there's no other name given among
[11:47] man whereby we must be saved
[11:50] but only this name of the Lord
[11:52] Jesus. And we are coming in his name.
[11:56] And we pray, heavenly father, that you
[11:58] will receive us tonight as your
[12:01] believing children and forgive our
[12:04] unbelief. Lord, help it tonight that it
[12:07] may uh be that we will completely
[12:10] believe every word of God tonight for
[12:13] all the things that we have need of. You
[12:16] know what's beneath these hands that's
[12:18] been raised up? There's sickness. Some
[12:21] of them may be domestic troubles. Some
[12:23] of them financial
[12:25] troubles. Some of them are weary. Maybe
[12:29] some backslid. Some sinner. Whatever
[12:32] their need is, thou art
[12:35] more than a match for any enemy.
[12:39] So we pray Lord that that tonight that
[12:43] we will recognize that our enemies,
[12:46] everyone has been defeated even to death
[12:50] itself and that we are more than
[12:52] conquerors in him who who loved us and
[12:55] gave himself for us has washed us in his
[12:59] blood.
[13:01] We pray Lord that all
[13:04] unbelief, all doubt, all
[13:07] flusterations, all that's unlike God
[13:09] will flee from us tonight. That the Holy
[13:13] Ghost might have the rightway in our
[13:15] hearts. May he speak to us in a
[13:17] mysterious
[13:19] ways. May he speak to us in his power.
[13:22] May he resurrect those that are are
[13:26] spiritually dead.
[13:28] Bring back health to those who are sick
[13:31] and
[13:32] afflicted. Lift up the feeble knees, the
[13:35] wearied hands that's hanging down. May
[13:38] there be a time of
[13:40] rejoicing. May it break forth tonight,
[13:42] Lord, to leave this place to the
[13:44] Rematada in start one of the greatest
[13:46] conventions that's ever been held in
[13:48] this city. Thank you, Lord. While we're
[13:51] assembled together and pray, you said if
[13:53] the people that are called by my name
[13:55] shall assemble themselves together and
[13:57] pray then I'll hear from heaven. God, we
[14:00] pray that this will be so
[14:02] tonight. Now, Father, as we read the
[14:06] word, no one can interpret it but you.
[14:09] You're your own interpreter. And we pray
[14:11] that you'll interpret to us the things
[14:13] that we read
[14:15] tonight. Lord, we ask it in Jesus' name.
[14:19] Amen.
[14:21] Now, if many of you like to just mark
[14:24] down scriptures that a minister reads,
[14:28] and I would like for you to tonight, if
[14:32] you would to turn to
[14:34] Ephesians, and I was speaking last
[14:37] Sunday on the
[14:41] Ephesians, how that the book of Joshua
[14:45] was the Ephesians of the Old Testament.
[14:49] and how it was a book of redemption. And
[14:51] redemption has two different parts. Come
[14:55] out of and entering into. First you have
[14:59] to come out. Some people wants to bring
[15:02] the world in with them. But you got to
[15:04] come out of the world to enter into
[15:08] Christ. You have to come out of unbelief
[15:11] to enter into faith. There cannot be one
[15:14] thing in your way to really have genuine
[15:17] faith. You must absolutely leave
[15:19] everything that's contrary to the word
[15:22] of God behind to enter into faith. And
[15:27] that was the book of the Ephesians of
[15:30] the Old Testament. Joshua where Moses
[15:33] represented the law could not save no
[15:35] one but grace could. And here Joshua is
[15:38] the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior.
[15:41] And now then we find out that we have
[15:44] come to another
[15:46] Ephesians, another
[15:48] Ephesus. Now where that in our
[15:52] intellectual denominations and so forth,
[15:55] all of our
[15:57] educations programs has come to its uh
[16:02] its Jordan, then we must have an
[16:06] Ephesians again. We must have an exodus.
[16:09] we to come out and to go into for the
[16:13] rapture. Now, we're going to read
[16:16] tonight from the second chapter of
[16:18] Ephesians. I was just saying that so you
[16:20] could get to the the spot or the turn to
[16:22] the chapter.
[16:25] You and you hath he quickened, who were
[16:29] dead in trespasses in sin. wherein in
[16:33] times past you walked according to the
[16:35] course of this world, according to the
[16:38] prince of the power of the air, the
[16:41] spirit that now workketh in the children
[16:43] of
[16:45] disobedience, among whom also we all had
[16:49] our conversations in times past in the
[16:53] lust of the flesh, fulfilling the desire
[16:55] of the flesh and of the mind, and were
[16:59] by nature the children of wrath. even as
[17:03] others. But God who is rich in
[17:08] mercy or his great love wherewith he
[17:11] loved us even when we were dead in sin
[17:15] has he quickened us together with him or
[17:20] quickened us together with Christ. By
[17:23] grace are ye saved. I want to take from
[17:28] there a few part of of the verse. But
[17:33] God, the God who is rich in
[17:38] mercy. I want you to notice Sharon uh
[17:41] the prophet apostle rather
[17:45] Paul who
[17:47] um who how he made mention of this.
[17:52] How you has he quickened who were once
[17:57] dead. You have he quickened who were
[18:00] once dead. Dead in sin and trespasses,
[18:03] walking after the things of the world,
[18:05] the desire of the flesh and fulfilling
[18:07] the desire of the
[18:09] mind has uh what caused this change? You
[18:14] see what caused it from one time being
[18:16] dead to quicken? Quicken means made
[18:19] alive. There was a change from death
[18:22] unto life. There's no other there's no
[18:26] other thing that could happen to any
[18:28] person so great as to change him from
[18:31] death to life. Amen. A man if he was
[18:35] dying physically and could be healed
[18:37] physically, that would be a great thing.
[18:40] But nothing so great as when he is
[18:43] spiritually
[18:44] dead and God has quickened him to life.
[18:50] You once in times past dead. You were
[18:54] dead. Even many here tonight, one time
[18:58] can look back and know that you were
[19:01] dead. But now, why aren't you dead
[19:05] tonight as you were then? You deserve to
[19:09] be that way because you was a sinner.
[19:12] But God who is rich and mercy
[19:18] that's the that's the thing.
[19:20] God who was rich all these things that
[19:24] we were but God that made the change
[19:30] right there. God who is rich in mercy.
[19:35] Oh, I'm so glad for that. Amen. that he
[19:38] being rich in
[19:41] mercy, if he was just rich in money, if
[19:46] he was just uh rich in materials, which
[19:49] he is, but yet the greatest thing is
[19:52] being rich in mercy.
[19:56] Oh, what a great word that
[19:59] is. How that we were once dead. And we
[20:04] speaking the other night on how the seed
[20:06] must die and everything around that germ
[20:10] of life must not only die but
[20:12] rot. If it doesn't rot, it cannot live.
[20:17] And rot is completely done away with.
[20:21] It's finished. And until we get to the
[20:24] place that our own ideas and our own
[20:28] thinking is completely gone and it's
[20:33] rotted away from us, then the germ of
[20:36] life can begin to live. Now, now we
[20:40] might I might inject just a little bit
[20:43] of doctrine here that I don't if you
[20:45] don't believe it, all right, that's just
[20:47] okay. I do believe it. I believe that
[20:51] that a man when he's born in this
[20:54] world that when you're a little baby
[20:58] born into the world you could not have
[21:00] been here without being the fornowledge
[21:02] of God
[21:04] because he is infinite and he knows all
[21:08] things and when that little baby is born
[21:12] into the world there's something in that
[21:15] baby if he's ever going to have life
[21:18] there's a little something in in there
[21:20] in that child then that he comes to
[21:24] sooner or later that little seed is in
[21:26] him. Now if you'll take the scriptures
[21:29] plainly declare that now if you've got
[21:32] eternal life tonight if we have eternal
[21:35] life then we always were because there's
[21:40] only one form of eternal life. We always
[21:44] were. And the reason we were because we
[21:48] are a part of God and God is the only
[21:52] thing that's eternal. And like as Mel
[21:57] Kazdc received tithes from Abraham and
[22:00] it was lauded to his greatgrandson Levi
[22:04] who was yet in the loins of Abraham paid
[22:06] tithe for he was yet in the loins of
[22:08] Abraham when he met Melzdc. I want to
[22:11] speak on that or the other place one
[22:13] morning. Who is this Melzdc? Now notice
[22:16] that way back God knew this boy coming
[22:20] down. He knowed all things. Now we are a
[22:23] part of God. You always was. You don't
[22:26] remember because you were only an
[22:29] attribute in God. You were only in his
[22:33] thinking. Your very name. If it ever was
[22:36] on the book of life, it was put there
[22:38] before the foundation of the world. He
[22:40] knew what you were. I'm only saying this
[22:43] not to mix up doctrine, but to
[22:46] straighten it out that we might get away
[22:48] from this fear and scare. You don't know
[22:50] who you are. You are not going to be.
[22:53] But now you are the sons of God. You
[22:56] always were the sons of God. See, when
[23:00] God had you in his thinking at the
[23:02] beginning, you have to be some part of
[23:04] you. Your life that's in you now had to
[23:07] be with God before there well when he
[23:10] before you even become material here on
[23:12] earth before there was anything but God.
[23:16] You were one of his attributes. He know
[23:19] what your name would be. He know the
[23:20] color hair you'd have. He know all about
[23:22] you. The only thing happened is when you
[23:26] being a sinner, many of you can can uh
[23:30] fellowship with me on this thought. When
[23:32] you was a little boy, a little girl,
[23:34] you'd walk around and there would be
[23:36] certain things that would just word it
[23:38] wouldn't bother the other kids. It
[23:40] seemed like there was something in you
[23:42] that cried out there was God somewhere.
[23:44] Yet, you were a sinner. You remember
[23:45] that? Certainly. Now, what was that?
[23:49] That was that little form of life in you
[23:52] then. And then after a while, you heard
[23:56] the gospel. Maybe you went to church.
[23:58] You picked out this and that and went
[24:01] from denomination to denomination. But
[24:03] one day you being part of God, you had
[24:08] to be part of the word. And when you
[24:11] heard the word, you know where you come
[24:13] from. You know what was the truth. You
[24:17] were always the seed was in you. Always.
[24:21] the word seen the word that was in you
[24:25] that was before the foundation of the
[24:27] world saw the word and you come to
[24:30] it like my little eagle story how the
[24:34] little eagle was hatched out under a hen
[24:38] and the little fella uh walked with the
[24:41] chickens he the hen clucked and he
[24:44] didn't understand her clucking and and
[24:46] the little chickens their diet they had
[24:48] in the barnyard he he didn't understand
[24:50] That's uh how that they did that. But
[24:53] there was something in him seemed to be
[24:56] different from what that chicken was
[24:59] there because at the beginning he was a
[25:04] eagle. That's right. One day his mama
[25:08] come hunting him and when he heard that
[25:10] scream of the eagle, it was different
[25:14] from the cluck of the hen. Yeah. And
[25:17] that's the way it is with every bornag
[25:19] again believer. You can hear all the
[25:22] theology you want to and all the
[25:24] man-made discrepancy. But when that word
[25:26] flashes out there, then there's
[25:28] something takes a hold.
[25:30] You come to you who were once dead in
[25:33] sin, that life has he quickened. There
[25:37] has to be a life there to quicken to
[25:39] first.
[25:41] God by his fornowledge know all things.
[25:46] And we were predestinated to be sons and
[25:48] daughters of God. Ye who were once dead
[25:51] in sin and
[25:53] trespasses were worry and we all had our
[25:55] times past but hath he quickened. Look
[25:58] at Paul when Paul was a great
[26:01] theologian. But when he come face to
[26:03] face with that word Jesus it quickened.
[26:07] He come to life right quick because he
[26:10] was ordained to be that the he was part
[26:15] of the word and when the word saw the
[26:18] word it was his nature. All the clucking
[26:21] of the hins and the orthodox churches
[26:24] didn't have no effect upon him. He had
[26:26] saw the word. It was part of him. He was
[26:28] an eagle. He wasn't a chicken. He was
[26:31] just in the barnyard with him. But he
[26:34] was a eagle to begin with.
[26:37] I heard a similar little story, I hope
[26:39] it don't sound sacriiggious, about a
[26:41] little duck being born under a hen one
[26:43] time. He couldn't understand a funny
[26:45] looking little fellow, odd guy, and he
[26:48] couldn't understand the dust and
[26:49] everything. They were playing in the
[26:51] barnyard. But one day, the old hen led
[26:53] the little brood out behind the barn and
[26:56] he got a smell of water. Well, he tuck
[26:59] out towards that water as hard as he
[27:00] could go. Why? He had never been on a
[27:03] pond before. or he had never been in the
[27:05] water, but he was a duck to begin with.
[27:08] Only thing he had to do is come to
[27:10] himself. That's the same thing the
[27:12] believer is. There's something in him
[27:14] that when he meets God face to face, he
[27:16] comes to himself. That seed is in him
[27:20] and it's quickened. My That's right. And
[27:24] he flies away from the things of the
[27:26] world. They become dead to him.
[27:30] My remember we all had our life in the
[27:34] past in those things of the world. But
[27:36] once we got a hold of that real thing,
[27:40] something that quickened us, a little
[27:43] seed that come to life, then all the
[27:45] things of the world rotted right there.
[27:48] We had no more desire of it.
