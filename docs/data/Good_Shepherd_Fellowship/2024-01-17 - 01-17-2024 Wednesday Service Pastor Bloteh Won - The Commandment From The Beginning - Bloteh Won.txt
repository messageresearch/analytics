John Chapter 2 1 John Chapter 2 praise the Lord amen amen amen 1 John Chapter 2 we will read from verse one 1 John Chapter 2 we will read from verse one my little children these things write out unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is their pretation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole word and and hereby we we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that said I know him and keep not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that said he abide in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walk Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye have heard from the beginning that is our word from the beginning amen that is our word from the beginning I read that verse again Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye have which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word praise the Lord the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning praise the Lord are we together the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning let's pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord we are so grateful Lord God to be in the house of the Lord tonight you said in your word where whoever two or three are gathered you will be father and we are more than that number tonight and precious Lord father and even with all that

amen amen amen praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen praise the Lord so we uh we want to once again greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and all those are following tonight we greet you all and uh uh we pray that the Lord will will just uh encourage our house tonight so tonight just for uh uh our subject we've been speaking on the beginning praise the Lord so we want to talk about the Commandments from the beginning the Commandment from the beginning John said the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning praise the Lord so we want to look at the Commandment from the beginning that's why we want to we want to uh uh talk about praise the Lord and uh if the Lord give us Grace we we really want to look at this subject of the beginning uh trusting and uh uh believing that uh uh the holy spirit will bring something out of it that will be a blessing praise the Lord amen I hope that you have been blessed so far and uh we pray that uh the Lord will continue to bless us are we together the Commandment from the beginning as most time we when we think about the Commandments our mind goes over to the Ten Commandments Moses is the one that wrote it uh uh sorry the Lord wrote it and gave it to Moses that would be the correct thing to say Amen Moses never wrote The Commandments the Lord wrote it with his finger and gave it to Moses so uh uh Moses is the one that brought us that record of the Ten Commandments but uh we will realize that uh uh uh before uh Moses gave us that record praise the Lord before Moses gave us that record uh uh John here is speaking about the Commandments that was given from the beginning I want for us to look at that tonight that's what I want for us to look at praise the Lord I'm uh I'm I'm I'm a little bit distracted not because of anything you are doing is is myself praise the Lord you are not the one is is just myself are we together amen I will tell you what I'm distracted I'll tell you by not now I want us to look at something over in the Book of Genesis let's go in Genesis chapter 2 let's go in Genesis chapter 2 praise the Lord amen as you never get used to the pullit every time I come back here I'm I'm so nervous to death amen I'm so nervous to death but you have become such a wonderful group of people to preach to it's not because I'm a good preacher it's because you have bear with me amen you have bear with me so Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 let's go right into it Genesis chapter 2 let's look at verse 16 Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 are we together Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man and the Lord God commanded the man John 6 said the Commandment from the beginning this was the first commandment that God gave to man this was the first commandment that God gave to Adam to to his son that was on the earth and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat that's the Commandment of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat verse 17 but of the tree of the of knowledge of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die that was the first commandment that was the Commandment from the beginning praise the Lord amen and the beautiful thing about this is that I think I shared that with you to uh uh before if you look at this commandment and you count the words it might not it I not uh uh Faith uh uh in the in in the French translation but in the in the English translation it kind of for fit out for us because if you count the words of every tree of The Gather that eat if you count the words to uh surely D you are going to have 39 words if you count off every tree of the garden thou mayth eat freely if you count every one of them and you get to the end of verse 17 you will have 39 words so the first commandment had 39 words praise the Lord amen amen now the reason why I'm saying that to you is is is to help you appreciate something brother brandham said the number 40 is the number of Temptation or trial he called it the number of Temptation or the number of trial but the first commandment have 39 words counted in the English Bible here right before us you will realize that it was only one word that Satan added to the first commandment to finish 40 words and 40 is the number of Temptation praise the Lord amen where am I going with that and when going into the place word it help us to appreciate when the prophet speaks amen there was only one word that Satan added to the first commandment that broke the entire Eden that broke the entire uh uh uh uh peaceful rain that Adam had in the Garden of Eden When God says Thou shal surely die and he says thou shall not surely die praise the Lord so by adding one word he brought a trial or he brought a temptation to Eve and Eve fell by that Temptation and uh and then the the they lose their place before God at that time but that's the Commandment now it's beautiful it's beautiful why it's beautiful is because you will see to the first Adam God gave one commandment and to the second Adam when when the second Adam Jesus came he took the Ten Commandments of Moses and he put them into two praise the Lord amen I will explain that I explain myself so you understand me let's go to Matthew chapter 22 Matthew chapter 22 Matthew chapter 22 are we together amen Matthew chapter 22 in Matthew chapter 22 let's look at verse 34 Matthew chapter 22 let's look at verse 34 and read few verses of our Lord Jesus here the Bible says uh uh uh but when the when the but when the Pharisees had heard that he have put the sades to silence now he put the sadr sees to silence because right before this Jesus have just proven that there is a resurrection he have just spoken on the resurrection because the F the sades did not believe in Resurrection so Jesus brought h h a uh a story from uh from uh the the the Old Testament which of course you can find that in the life of TMA uh uh uh he talking about a man that married a woman and the first brother died and the second brother he's in the resurrection who uh you know wife they would be that was what the sagy brought to ask Jesus to prove to Jesus that there is nothing like Resurrection so whose wife is she going to be then Jesus answered their question there will be like Angels praise the Lord but when the Pharisees have heard that he put the Sadducees to salent they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer meaning the man that studied the word Ste the Lord ask him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the Lord now he's referring to the Ten Commandments that was given to Moses asking Jesus which is the greatest of the Commandment are we together Jesus said unto him thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the laws and the prophets so Jesus brought the the the the Ten Commandments that was given to Moses and he hang it on two strings praise the Lord amen and actually when you look at the Ten Commandments is hanging on two strings the first portion of the Commandments have to do with your love to God thou oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord thou shall not worship any other God before me he said jealous God is all about our love to God the rest of the other commandment have to do with your neighbor so Jesus is saying there that if you love your neighbor you will not commit adultery if you love your neighbor you will not CT if you love your neighbor you will not bear false witness if you love so all the rest of the other combin men is just love your neighbor praise the Lord amen now God gave adam one commandment why because Adam never had a neighbor amen he never had a neighbor he never had to deal with anybody all he had to do is stay behind that word and he are going to have constant fellowship with men brother brandham said when Adam fell then God introduced a second Covenant and on that second Covenant comes the provision of the second commandment are we together so now we have to deal with God and I have to deal with you as my neighbors praise the Lord I have to deal with God I have to walk upright before God and I also have to walk upright before you one do not go without the other praise the Lord are we together amen one do not go without the other so the first Adam had only one commandment because his Fellowship was only with God we have two Commandments because our fellowship is with the father and also with the Brethren are we together now what is the Commandment because here John is telling us that the Commandment of all the Commandment from the beginning he said it was the word when we think about the Commandment we think about do and don't do this don't do this do this don't do this that's all we think in our mind praise the Lord amen that's that's the way we that's the way we perceive the Commandment that God don't want us to worship no no no other graving IM he don't want us to have no other God you know and and that thing has been brought down to the the church that the instead of the people falling in love with God all they want to do they just want to know what is the law of the church what is the rule of this church what do this church believe what can I do to be a faithful member you're just looking for rules that's all religion give men is rules don't do this don't do that don't do this but that was not the intention of The Commandments that was not the intention of the Commandment because when God gave adam this word God gave it to Adam to be his protection praise the Lord he gave adam his word to be his protection the word from the beginning Hallelujah yeah are we together glory be to God brother bam shared in the message conflict between God and Satan God are the beginning praise the Lord amen God at the beginning gave his children their atomic weapon praise the Lord God at the beginning gave his children their atomic weapon Hallelujah because he is the infinite God see it now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition amen the right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they had need of thou who sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture so when God gave the word in the beginning every a he gives the word every age the word is our protection every age the word is given to fortified us when God gave the word he was thinking about from Eden all the way to the Rapture praise the Lord glory be to God because you were realize over in exodor when God brought Israel out he never gave them a commandment no he never gave them a commandment read Exodus chapter 19 you will realize that the Lord told Israel if you will love the Lord God with all of your heart I will make you a kingdom of priests you're going to be my people and the people misunderstood God because the minds of men the way we think whenever we hear the word of God what comes to our mind is do and done that's all we think about praise the Lord so in the first place we don't even appreciate the word we are standing around okay what should I do what should I don't do that's that's the thing that is troubling our mind because we are always striving to do something and we think that's the way we can gain God favor when God spoke to Israel in in Exodus chapter 19 they misunderstood God and they say all that the Lord God will say we will do brother brandham says they challenged God in another sense they were trying to say that we are able to keep the Commandment of God whatever Church order you gave us we will do what other you asked us to do we will do it the prophet of God said that was the fal mistake that Israel ever made they forsook the grace of God and they asked God for Lord that was where the Ten Commandments came from God never gave Israel 10 commandments they asked for it praise the Lord when you think that you are living a holy life you are asking you are demanding God praise the Lord you are not appreciating the grace of God when you think that your life is better than another person's life and you think that you more closer to God than another person you are not appreciating the grace of God you are you are Desiring something more harder is almost like okay I know I'm Justified now I need sanctification I need to be more Sanctified oh I know I Sanctified get the Holy Ghost I want to be adopted that's the way people understood the statue of the perfect man they think that you can gain faith and then you gain virtue and then you grow to no that's not what brother brandham said that was not what he taught it's not something that you gain one after another it's all in your birth when you are born again it's in your birth and as you walk with God and love God you begin to manifest those things that's what I like Wednesday night Sunday I have too many faces looking at me Wednesday night I just have few praise the Lord so brother Bram said God knowing what will have come knowing what would have come that there was going to be battle there was going to come a conflict so he gave his children the best protection praise the Lord he gave them the best protection the word is not given to you for you to do the word is given to protect you for you to stay behind praise the Lord but no we don't want to stay behind you know what we do we take our pen we like to underline cycle praise the Lord because we really want to understand this thing so we can do it that's not what the word was given for praise the Lord now don't misunderstand me now I'm not saying it's wrong for you to underline praise the Lord because if there is one man that is guilty of it I am you look in my Bible it's all with with all the colors on Earth praise the Lord but I'm trying to make you to understand the word was not given for us to do like something we have to learn to do are we together God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything bank that they had need of that will sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture to the Rapture one word just one word what did the thief on the cross needed to do just one word you will be with me in Paradise all he needed to do was to believe it all he needed to do was to believe it praise the Lord that's the reason why the prophet of God challenged us that we will come to service after service and the word will be preached to us oh over and over again he said just one message must be enough when God gave them that word when he commanded them you see this sometimes it's uh is I think I think uh h h a translation you know trying to find the best word to be able to express the the mind of God man choose word because if if you talk about com command I give you command it means that you do what I say but that's not what God meant praise the Lord because he already know by the law no flesh is Justified praise the Lord what is the what is what is the use of it if you keep all the Lord break one you are guilty of all then what is the use of keeping it praise the Lord what is the use of keeping it you see that's the reason why legalistic approach to God can never work it can never work he told Israel the Lord your God is one love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul all your mind fall in love with God forget about what how much you can do and just fall in love try and fall in love with God falling in love with God is not thinking about if I pray this morning if I read my Bible this morning no fall in love with God learn toeach Express a Lord I love you I love you praise the Lord amen but you see the love of God has been attached to all sorts of things we understand it as if when we prayed and and and and and and and maybe uh the Lord has not answered us you know the question is there I mean it shows that yeah I know God Lov me he died for my sin but this one has not been given so all of that question trouble our minds but yet is his expression of love because sometimes he does those things he put us on in a in a tight spot sometimes he put us in a heart seat so we can come closer to him his way of drawing us closer to his love forget about what I have done because that is the first thing that stps the mind of of a of a Believer as soon as something happen we run in our mind what have I done did I break the word of God praise the Lord why why we always why our mind always channel that way when the Bible says why we were yet sinners while we were yet sinners astray from God he Lov us amen praise the Lord us when we while we were yet sinners is he going to change his mind now that we are believers hallu as soon as we have headache the first thing we're going to look for a sin in our life praise the Lord you eating the spoon break you don't ask yourself did I feel this spoon too much we don't think about that what have I done Lord [Music] Jesus praise the Lord let's read a little baby here from the prophet of God we continue from Eden to the Rapture he said what was it their word what was it what did God equi his children with their word you see John expressing that the old commandment from the beginning he said it was their word it was the word it it was not a it was not rules and regulation praise the Lord no it was the word now think about this think about this before we go any further think about this if Satan never came to explain Eve away from that word it did not b father Adam and Eve whether they understood it or not praise the Lord no it did not bother them you never he you never read in Genesis where Adam went back and says what did God really means no it was it was an intruder praise the Lord it was an intruder that came and says do you really understand what is on the line here it did not bother them praise the Lord as long as God says give them his word of every tree of the garden you should eat the one in the middle of the garden the day you eat it thou sh die Adam say amen he went he went from church that night he didn't even remember why he said amen to praise the Lord he was just going about loving God naming the animals and and enjoying the eating and all of that until an intruder King until a preacher enter the church and now he has become a teacher and he want to teach the people what the word of God really means praise the Lord do you think Adam was waking up every morning and say Eve remember God says we must not eat that tree you think Adam was doing that he never he never had time for that he was enjoying giving the animals their names he was enjoying telling this tree to move from here he was enjoying being an amateur God when you are enjoying the Lord the love of God you are enjoying the manifestation of the word of God you are not worried about dos and Don are we together brother Braham said what was it what was it that God equipped his children with what was It was supposed to take them from Eden all the way to the Rapture he said it was the word the word that's what defeats Satan is the word it will defeat him any time any place hallu now why do we want to substitute something else when we have already got the best thing there is why do we want religion why can't we just fall in love with God why can't we just fall in love with God why we want to place something and a piece ourself and think when I do this God will be happy with me when I do this God will not be happy with me when we can just go on thanking God thank you for the breath of life thank you for watching over me the dead I was separated from my mother womb thank you for the air that I breathe and the things that I see and just thanking godallah praise the Lord why do we want to substitute the best thing that God has given us men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God why do we want to substitute there why can't we just enjoy the blessings of the word saying the scribes and and the Pharisees sat with Moses sat in Moses seat amen now why should we battle out what is Moses seat what what is Moses seat whether it was on the right side or the left side and and we we we get our mind so wrapped up in all of those things and it take us from just appreciating the precious word that God gave us praise the Lord greatest battle ever fought I just told few of them tonight just because of uh of the Wednesday night he said the greatest battle ever fought she's going on right now she's going on right in yet now now brother brandham is is is is bringing us to a place that even while we sit in church right now the greater battle is going on Amen between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between Liberty and bondage the battle is on is going on right now praise the Lord while we listen to the word we sit in the Fellowship of the Saints we sing the songs we praise God that battle is going on right now because the devil the devil can use I don't know what color is this I just talk it wor it tonight but he can use just this thing our world and throw somebody off the whole service is going on it is what kind of a color he wor tonight see how he's dressed and the mind is completely gone from the word praise the Lord all is either see how the sister is playing the piano tonight what does that have to do with you appreciating God you see when we come to to to to worship God and appreciate God we Step Beyond those things amen when a song leader is Now sing in a song you step right in there you clap your hand you even Raise Your Voice above his voice maybe he don't know the song and you gave the church a tone and you get into worship because you want to worship God you are not yet to listen to that man you are here to worship God are you going to leave your house D drive 30 minutes to come to church and allow this flims think this thing I don't even know how much I pay for it to throw you out of the service and some sometimes it's just all people Minds on they sit all the time in the service and they are carry a b with somebody that he always singing out of tone the other person I mean is the other person they just like dressing what what does that have to do with you what does that have to do with you worshiping God did you left your house just to come and be observing people then you have never even entered into the presence of the Lord that's why brother brandham said the greater battle is going on right now while you are sitting down right here are you exor the word are you attracted to the word or is him addressing that is carrying you crazy praise the Lord Oh I thought we were really going to have service tonight man many people never came what does you are here that's what matters you are here and you have a promise that he will be here get a hold of the one that is here yeah praise the Lord oh yeah we shout we say all of these things Wednesday now we come back again and is it the same thing he says the greater battle is going on right in here now praise the Lord right in here now by our approach to the word our Focus to the word we could bring a lifely offering to God or we could just bring a deare worship to God your body is here but your mind is gone that's a dead offering praise the Lord that's a dead offering but your body can be so sick and you are trembling and your mind is just on the word Lord you are my healer Lord I believe your word no matter how sick your body is God look at that as a lifely offering there is somebody that is interested in my word great battle is going on right in here now life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between Liberty and burnish the batt is on Shine Your spear sold your polish up your armor God's getting his soldiers ready God anoint his army he says America dress their soldiers in the best that they can have to dress with they get steel helmet they get armor and whatever they got armor tanks and whatever they go in he says and God dress his army Hallelujah he said God dress his army what kind of equipment do we use the spirit of the sword the word of God the word of God that's the reason why there is nothing nothing important in the service than the word of God the word is what is important nothing is above the word we don't have a service if we don't have the word praise the Lord if we just come and sing and dance is just a concer without the word what was the Angels worshiping when God became God what was this worshiping was the word that's the logos that's the word are we together praise the Lord am I yelling at you does it feel like I'm angry no I'm not angry don't think so don't let the devil tell you that I'm not angry I'm not angry I'm just trying to make an emphasis tonight praise the Lord God dresses amen what kind of equipment do we use the spir the spirit of the sword the word of God Amen the word of God sharper than the two edges sword Hebrew 4 piercing even to the a s of the born even to to the mar of the born a discerner of the thoughts of the Mind the word of God to believe his word and that's the way God's armor amen that's the way God equi his people praise the Lord that's the way God equipped his people see Jesus the word made flesh when he got on the lake to preach he never said Simon Peter Le the song service Matthew you take up the offering praise the Lord no he says give me the boat he stepped in the boat and he starts to give precious words praise the Lord amen he starts to give precious words at a certain time he realized that there's a group of people that were only attracted to the food the basket of bread and all of that and they were not attracted to the word are you seeing where we going tonight John said a new commandment I gave you it's not a new commandment it's the old commandment from the beginning praise the lord it's not a new come it's the same word god taking the same word just addressing it to our age to our dispensation praise the Lord the same word that Moses read the same word Jeremiah read the same word is not a new commandment the message is not a new doctrine there not a new movement it's just the Holy Ghost picking up the promises for this age the new commandment I gave you is not a new commandment people is the old commandment from the beginning the word that God used to protect his people to equip his people praise the lord we can look for all the signs and all the sensation and all the emotion without the word we will turn out dead pretty soon we will realize we are tired we are tired everything will look like a form to us if we don't make the word of God our attraction praise the Lord that's the reason why all the people that love brother Brandon uh Ministry only for the the healings they can find fault with the doctrines why because they were attracted by the healings the the healing was not the attraction of the ministry it was just a bait it was just a bait just like the fire on the Burning Bush was to grab Moses attention but a message came forth the healing was to grab our attention but a message has come forth to change us a message has come forth to take us back to the beginning praise the lord it's so sad that people under the te pool they are still looking for first and second P praise the Lord they make first and second P ADV vindication the first and second follow the tear don't leave the tear where is the tear the opening of the word left a few minutes let me not keep you long take up the whole arm out of god let's let's just take another one here tonight brother Bram says so the infinite God going to choose his is going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he choose it and it was the word God gave his army the best equipment that it could ever use and ever could use and will never have to be changed Lord praise the Lord are we together and he never Chang his sense you don't improve it it Remains the Same all the time all the time we get worried about oh what I mean what can we do to to to you know encourage the young people what can we do so the church can be on fire all we need to do is get back to the word let our interest be in the word let the people know that there is a voice of God praise the Lord let's take interest in listening to what a prophet have said the moment the church start getting interest in the word and getting in the word and getting in the word see the glory that comes upon the people praise the lord we can do we can create a boss Scout in the church a gas Scout in the church and create all the forms we just only dick in our grave cuz he never going to revive the church God used one thing to bring a Revival and that's his word praise the Lord when we start addressing our actions and our reaction action by the word of God Amen our treatment to one another the way we treat our wives and our husbands and our children and and everything back to the word see a living Monument see a people stepping on the earth we want the manifestation but we don't want the word we don't want to spend time with the word you don't improve it it Remains the Same all the time it's God's word that he fortify his people wave no matter how many things Satan ever get how many things any other army ever gets or or anything it can never take the place of God's First Choice the word was his first choice when he choose to express himself what was his expression the word the logos in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God nothing will ever take his first choice brother Bram says show me the man that will succeed what the God told Joshua that you will prosper in everything that you do stay with the word that I gave my S Moses don't turn from it to the right don't turn from it to the left praise the Lord you realize I don't even know my right and left but that's fine they can never fake the place of God's First Choice his word he gave them his word his promise and said stay with it the best that could be known he gave his promise to them and said stay with it stay with with it if you will keep in fellowship with me stay with it stay with the word and as long as they stay with the word god came down every evening praise the Lord God came down every eving to commune and fellowship with them when they broke the word when they left the word he had to give them a sheep skin he he had to slay alarm to be able to reconcile them back God never had to go through the through the through the garden and say Adam where are you I never saw you in church it's been one week praise the Lord amen and that and that's and that is the thing that the church won pra so you know it's almost been one week I've been out of church nobody call me who's supposed to call you praise the lord we interpret that as the love of God then you must be careful they can't even call me can't praise the Lord amen are we together now don't miss the emphasis now don't let the devil to Rob your mind and twist your mind and say I'm I'm trying to say something El no don't allow it the emphasis that I'm on tonight is the word the word is our greatest attraction praise the Lord because when if the word is between both of both of us if you don't call me then I also feel the responsibility to call you I don't throw the blame on you I'm thinking oh my it's is strange I i't he from this brother for the why praise the Lord and you also thinking on the other side I never heard from this gu why that's the reason why you he sometimes you call I was just thinking about you why is the word that is making that connection we don't put our feelings above the word no we lift the word up because he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men if I becomes the attraction I'm going to pull you out of your struggle I will pull you out of your weakness make me the attraction are we together it's a Wednesday night it's a Wednesday night convinced and concerned brother Bram said this I've shared this with you and and I think can I can be able to stop here tonight he says and God equipped his army being infinite know the best armor that there was and what did he do he gave his army his word to we are now fortified behind denomination we are now fortified behind groups we are fortified by the word word of God by the word of God if the word is our attraction the word is our fellowship if we are immersing ourself in that word we're not going to entertain one evil thought about a brother all about a sister if we are immersing ourself into that word whenever the devil brings up an evil thought you would take it as a prayer [Laughter] request when the devil put an evil thought on your mind concerning the brother it become a prayer request Lord Jesus bless my brother father bless him you take care of him Lord Jesus take care of my sister Lord no matter what she's going through the devil is a liar you bless her father try that the devil will take your your your home a dress from his L the devil is going to say every time I carry evil thought I make them prayed stop giving them evil thought because they are praying too much glory be to God the word John says a new commandment it's not a new commandment it's the word that he gave us from the beginning that was God's first best thing he could give us and is the best thing that God can give you it's more than wealth it's more than riches is the word you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord let's bow our heads together come up sisters I Love You Lord and I live my voice I was thinking about that song at the end of the beginning of the service I couldn't find [Music] it [Music]
