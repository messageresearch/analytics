[44:26] and he knows
[44:30] that he has no skills whatsoever
[44:33] and he has to jump anyhow
[44:37] and the only confidence and the trust he
[44:39] has
[44:40] is in the parachute
[44:44] and he is jumping in a house
[44:46] and he knows he can go by the head
[44:49] he can go on the side
[44:51] but he has a lot of confidence in his
[44:53] parachute
[44:55] knowing that when he pulls the rope
[44:57] it's going to open
[44:59] it doesn't matter how he goes
[45:02] but he knows he's going to have a soft
[45:03] landing

[53:34] and upon the handmaids in those days
[53:37] will i pour out my spirit
[53:40] praise be to god shall we be seated
[53:59] the title of my message this morning
[54:04] is
[54:05] i will restore save the lord
[54:08] it's a message the prophet preached
[54:12] and
[54:14] we all know
[54:16] that there is nobody that can preach the
[54:18] message that brother preaches it
[54:23] but
[54:24] i am just taking a thought
[54:27] from this message
[54:31] trusting that god
[54:34] is just going to come through the word
[54:38] and bless as many of us that have
[54:40] gathered this morning
[54:41] praise be to god
[54:44] i will restore
[54:46] says the lord
[54:49] praise be to god
[54:52] it's not an easy road
[54:55] we've been called to walk on
[54:59] it cost god
[55:01] a lot
[55:03] it cost him
[55:05] to have you seated here this morning
[55:11] he had to send his only begotten son
[55:16] who came and gave his life
[55:19] we are seated here that it cost god a
[55:23] lot
[55:24] to bring us here
[55:28] and it has to cost you
[55:30] a lot
[55:32] it would also cost you
[55:34] in your service to god it will cost you
[55:38] in one way or the other it's going to
[55:40] cost you something
[55:41] amen
[55:43] like david said
[55:45] that he would not offer god
[55:48] a sacrifice without a cost
[55:53] that was when satan got david to number
[55:56] the children of israel
[55:58] and a displeased god
[56:00] and god gave david three things to
[56:02] choose from
[56:05] but we are serving such a wonderful and
[56:07] merciful god
[56:09] that at the end of it all
[56:12] god came to david
[56:15] according to the instructions of the
[56:16] angel of the lord and told him
[56:19] to go
[56:20] and then perform a sacrifice
[56:26] and when david went
[56:29] to that jebusite
[56:32] anon
[56:34] and he wanted to buy his threshing floor
[56:37] now look at it
[56:39] when you know that it has to cost you
[56:41] something to save god
[56:43] there is no price too high
[56:48] there is no price that is too much
[56:50] if you know you are doing it for the
[56:52] lord there is no price that is too much
[56:54] to pay
[56:57] when david came to anon
[57:00] and said god had come to me
[57:03] by the instruction of the almighty god
[57:05] through his angel asking me to come and
[57:08] buy this land and perform a sacrifice
[57:10] what did arnold say he said you know
[57:11] what
[57:12] i am giving you this land free of charge
[57:18] i don't care what it cost i am giving it
[57:20] to you not only that i am also going to
[57:22] give you the boo that you are going to
[57:24] use to perform this sacrifice
[57:26] not only that the elements of the
[57:29] threshing floor i'm giving them to you
[57:31] as wood
[57:33] not only that i'm even going to supply
[57:35] the heat
[57:37] press be to god
[57:39] for goodness sake what can we give to
[57:42] god which he has not already given to us
[57:48] and david said no
[57:51] i would not offer to god any sacrifice
[57:55] without a cost
[57:57] i appreciate it but i'm going to pay for
[57:59] it
[58:01] and he paid him
[58:02] and performed the sacrifice
[58:05] in whatever way
[58:07] remember
[58:08] that it will cost you something
[58:10] in your service to god
[58:13] whatever it is i don't know
[58:15] but it will cost you something
[58:18] it can cost your very own life
[58:22] and we saw if you read the the
[58:24] the foxes book of matthias
[58:26] and you see the way they kill the
[58:28] believers
[58:29] not because they did anything wrong
[58:32] not because they committed any crime
[58:34] but for their love
[58:36] their love their heart for god
[58:39] they died very gruesome death
[58:43] and that didn't mean anything to them
[58:46] we have a promise
[58:48] the lord jesus said if you save your
[58:51] life you will look if you seek to save
[58:52] your life you will lose it
[58:55] but if you lose your life for my sake
[58:58] you will be saved
[58:59] so when you have served god faithfully
[59:02] and it would cost you even your life you
[59:05] know that you have a promise
[59:08] praise be to god and sometimes what it
[59:10] will cost you is your pride and your
[59:13] arrogance
[59:14] yourself pray that i go yes
[59:17] sometimes that is what is going to cause
[59:18] you you have to bring your shoulder down
[59:20] and let go talk to you
[59:24] we can talk about neymar
[59:27] that syrian captain of the host of the
[59:29] of of of of um the king of israel syria
[59:33] he was a leper
[59:36] but he had a maiden
[59:39] in his house
[59:41] from the land of israel
[59:43] and one day
[59:46] she went to her mistress
[59:48] and told her mistress
[59:50] if my lord had gone to see
[59:54] the prophet in israel
[59:56] he was going to get healed he will heal
[59:58] him of his leprosy
[1:00:00] and the message finally gets
[1:00:02] to
[1:00:04] to to to naaman
[1:00:06] naaman tells the king of syria he gives
[1:00:08] him a letter
[1:00:10] go
[1:00:11] and hand it over to the king of israel
[1:00:14] he guessed that we know the story how he
[1:00:16] gives him the letter he got so angry he
[1:00:18] tore his reign his mantle he said am i
[1:00:21] god to heal you
[1:00:23] and it came to pass that when he lies
[1:00:25] ahead of it he said why should you rent
[1:00:27] your mantle send him over and he would
[1:00:30] know that there is a prophet of god in
[1:00:32] the land
[1:00:34] and he went
[1:00:35] with his talents of silver and gold and
[1:00:38] on horses and camels terrorists and when
[1:00:41] he got there he thought the man of god
[1:00:44] was coming out to come and see him to
[1:00:46] salute him to bow before him
[1:00:49] he never even came out
[1:00:51] elijah was inside and he sent his
[1:00:53] servant go tell him to go and dip
[1:00:56] himself seven times in the jordan and
[1:00:58] he'll be clean
[1:01:00] when the message got to him he got
[1:01:02] offended
[1:01:05] he says there are better rivers in
[1:01:06] damascus i mean in in in syria can't i
[1:01:09] bought there and get clean
[1:01:11] why should i have to come and buff in
[1:01:12] the mighty waters
[1:01:15] of the jordan
[1:01:16] and he left
[1:01:18] very angry and when he got there his
[1:01:20] servants came
[1:01:22] he said if he had asked you to do
[1:01:24] something greater wouldn't you have done
[1:01:26] it
[1:01:27] you carried silver and gold on you he
[1:01:30] have asked you to do something greater
[1:01:32] once you have done it he's just asking
[1:01:35] you god dip yourself in the jordan seven
[1:01:38] times is that something too hard to do
[1:01:41] a lot of the times that is what we feel
[1:01:44] as christians
[1:01:46] that when people have problems
[1:01:49] and then they come to
[1:01:50] us instead of helping them to deal with
[1:01:53] it we found the flames
[1:01:56] why should he tell you that who is he
[1:01:58] come on don't do it he didn't even
[1:02:00] respect you why didn't he come out no
[1:02:04] they spoke sense to him
[1:02:06] some of the times that is all we need
[1:02:09] to get back
[1:02:11] online
[1:02:14] spoke sense to him
[1:02:16] and then he had to bring his shoulders
[1:02:18] down
[1:02:20] he went back
[1:02:21] went into the jordan one
[1:02:23] came out two
[1:02:25] came out three
[1:02:26] five times
[1:02:28] six
[1:02:30] he asked me to go inside seven times
[1:02:34] i have gone in six already
[1:02:36] something should have started happening
[1:02:38] my daddy has changed
[1:02:40] something says just walk out and go he
[1:02:43] was making a fool out of you he said no
[1:02:45] i will try for the last time the seventh
[1:02:48] time he goes in and comes out and lo and
[1:02:50] behold the leprosy is gone
[1:02:53] praise be to god
[1:02:56] he was shocked he went back to the man
[1:02:58] of god
[1:02:59] he was lost of west and listen to what
[1:03:02] he says
[1:03:03] that now i know
[1:03:05] praise be to god not a feeling
[1:03:08] [Music]
[1:03:10] not somebody's imagination but now i
[1:03:14] know
[1:03:15] that in all of the earth there is no god
[1:03:18] by the god of israel
[1:03:19] praise be to god
[1:03:22] now i know
[1:03:26] it would cost you something
[1:03:29] in your work with god
[1:03:32] we make a lot of sacrifices yes
[1:03:35] some worked last night and they are here
[1:03:39] some have driven 100 miles
[1:03:42] over 100 miles to come here that is a
[1:03:45] lot of sacrifice
[1:03:48] it doesn't mean if you are coming 5-10
[1:03:50] miles away it's not a sacrifice in fact
[1:03:52] for you to get up in the morning
[1:03:54] and push everything aside
[1:03:57] and then get ready to come to the house
[1:03:58] of god it's a lot of sacrifice
[1:04:01] praise be to god
[1:04:04] but there is something i want us to look
[1:04:06] at this morning
[1:04:08] a lot of you know
[1:04:10] that for some months
[1:04:13] my truck the number plate behind my
[1:04:15] truck was hanging like this
[1:04:19] yes
[1:04:21] and that made me so popular in saint
[1:04:23] michael
[1:04:26] i'll be sitting in a kind of policeman
[1:04:28] will come
[1:04:29] say do you know your number plate is
[1:04:31] falling
[1:04:32] i said oh yes i'm aware of it thank you
[1:04:34] sir
[1:04:38] the other day i was just parked by the
[1:04:40] roadside
[1:04:41] a squad car came and stopped beside me
[1:04:42] two police officers say are you aware no
[1:04:45] more please i said yes sir i am aware of
[1:04:47] it
[1:04:50] but i got so sad one day
[1:04:54] a lady
[1:04:55] old enough to be my mother
[1:04:58] i was at a
[1:05:02] diary queen in saint michael
[1:05:05] and then this woman came out of a car it
[1:05:07] was very cold at the time
[1:05:09] and then she struggled walked walked i
[1:05:12] saw her walking coming and then she
[1:05:13] comes to me
[1:05:15] then i wrote down my glasses
[1:05:17] now do you know another plate is falling
[1:05:19] i saw yeah and i feel so sorry i did
[1:05:21] that to her
[1:05:27] the other day the police pushed me over
[1:05:28] because i was reaching out to take my
[1:05:30] phone
[1:05:31] and he saw me
[1:05:33] so he came behind me
[1:05:35] do you know another plate is falling i
[1:05:36] say yes
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:41] so i became so popular
[1:05:45] not for any good reason
[1:05:52] so i went my with my wife and i went to
[1:05:55] cobons in
[1:05:57] albertville
[1:05:58] we parked and here comes a man
[1:06:02] then he stops
[1:06:03] he said you know never played this
[1:06:04] following i said yes
[1:06:06] i said it's been this way for about six
[1:06:08] months
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:12] then he looks at me
[1:06:13] do you need help i said yes
[1:06:18] then he passed the sky he comes and he
[1:06:19] says i'm your brother
[1:06:21] and um i was kind of taken aback
[1:06:24] because i mean if you should tell me
[1:06:26] about i know
[1:06:28] but
[1:06:30] then i said okay
[1:06:32] then he told me then he started the
[1:06:34] story
[1:06:35] how that he was born in brussels
[1:06:37] he was three months old
[1:06:39] his parents took him to congo
[1:06:41] and he's been in congo all his life
[1:06:44] and he's a missionary with his wife
[1:06:46] and the whole family is missionary apart
[1:06:50] from one brother who is just going
[1:06:52] astray and they are praying for him i
[1:06:54] say keep praying the lord will answer
[1:06:55] your prayer
[1:06:58] and then i go to his house
[1:07:01] to for him to fix my number plate
[1:07:05] and they were just talking one thing
[1:07:06] from the other
[1:07:08] then he tells me he has been in the
[1:07:10] missionary field all his life
[1:07:13] and i said
[1:07:14] wow
[1:07:15] this is a huge sacrifice this is why i
[1:07:19] am bringing us
[1:07:22] he said
[1:07:23] then i told him this is a huge sacrifice
[1:07:26] he said no
[1:07:28] it's not a sacrifice
[1:07:31] it's a blessing
[1:07:33] my goodness
[1:07:35] my faith was challenged
[1:07:39] my faith was challenged
[1:07:43] that somebody that has left the comfort
[1:07:46] here
[1:07:47] and is in africa doing missionary work
[1:07:50] all his life
[1:07:52] tells me that it is not a sacrifice and
[1:07:55] it's a blessing
[1:07:56] i said it's rightly spoken
[1:07:59] for god to trust you well enough with
[1:08:02] his word
[1:08:04] to be a voice unto him
[1:08:10] to god preaching his word
[1:08:12] is nothing but a blessing
[1:08:15] for god to trust you well enough
[1:08:19] with a people
[1:08:21] to shepherd over
[1:08:24] it's not a sacrifice but a blessing
[1:08:27] as a matter of fact for god to trust you
[1:08:30] well enough with his word
[1:08:33] knowing that you believe and live by it
[1:08:36] is a blessing and not a sacrifice
[1:08:39] it is not to say that you are not making
[1:08:41] any sacrifices
[1:08:43] let god
[1:08:44] see your labor of love
[1:08:48] let god see you making that sacrifice
[1:08:51] but you look at it
[1:08:53] from the point of a blessing
[1:08:57] because when you begin to look at it as
[1:09:00] a sacrifice
[1:09:02] guess what it is what you are doing
[1:09:05] it now becomes what your effort
[1:09:08] it becomes what your ability
[1:09:11] it becomes what you are doing
[1:09:14] but when you begin to see it as a
[1:09:17] blessing it is no longer you you are
[1:09:20] seeing the hand of god what god is doing
[1:09:22] in your life
[1:09:25] it is not to say there is no sacrifice
[1:09:27] to it but let god see you making that
[1:09:30] sacrifice you don't look at it as a
[1:09:31] sacrifice see it as a blessing
[1:09:37] he told me two things
[1:09:39] i'm keeping the next one
[1:09:42] praise be to god
[1:09:45] within that short time
[1:09:50] when i see any man in the street he is a
[1:09:53] creation of god i respect them
[1:09:56] whether we are we go to the same church
[1:09:59] it doesn't make any difference
[1:10:01] you don't know who a child of god is
[1:10:07] never look mean on anybody
[1:10:09] never look down on anybody
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:17] and he told me two things
[1:10:20] i'm keeping the second one
[1:10:25] praise be to god
[1:10:27] and the day i tell you the second one
[1:10:29] i'll let you know that is the story
[1:10:36] just remember
[1:10:37] there are a lot of sacrifices we make
[1:10:41] there are a lot of struggles we'll go
[1:10:43] through
[1:10:46] anything
[1:10:47] and everything that has life
[1:10:50] has a struggle
[1:10:53] do not let your struggle
[1:10:56] seem so special
[1:10:58] don't let it look so strange
[1:11:02] know that everybody is struggling one
[1:11:04] way or the other anything that has life
[1:11:07] has struggles
[1:11:09] we can talk about the fishes in the sea
[1:11:12] they are struggles
[1:11:15] when the worlds come and is forcing them
[1:11:18] onto the land
[1:11:19] they are struggling to swim back
[1:11:22] it's a struggle
[1:11:24] when they are swimming they see the
[1:11:25] fisherman's hook they are running away
[1:11:27] from it
[1:11:29] and then they see the mass the
[1:11:30] fisherman's net they are running away
[1:11:33] from it and before the away the shark is
[1:11:36] coming they are running away before the
[1:11:38] aware the whale is coming they are
[1:11:40] running away they have struggles
[1:11:44] just look at it from the point of this
[1:11:47] i love farming
[1:11:50] and where i come from in the hinterlands
[1:11:52] in ghana there are stones a lot more
[1:11:56] stones than there are farming lands
[1:11:59] and the people would farm anyhow
[1:12:01] and there are places where they even
[1:12:03] gather the stones together so they can
[1:12:04] plant
[1:12:07] now when they are planting
[1:12:10] whether they the earth there is shallow
[1:12:12] or not they plant anyhow
[1:12:16] and then when the crops don't germinate
[1:12:18] anyhow because there is life in that
[1:12:20] seed
[1:12:22] and then it germinates
[1:12:25] and then you would realize
[1:12:26] that those that are sitting very well on
[1:12:29] good soil where the depth of the soil is
[1:12:32] very high they are growing very well
[1:12:35] but those that have very thin earth and
[1:12:37] their stone under they just come up and
[1:12:40] they are struggling
[1:12:42] and the farmer is aware of them
[1:12:46] he gives them more
[1:12:48] attention he gives them more attention
[1:12:53] his focus is on the other side better
[1:12:55] his focus is here the
[1:13:02] more and the plant doesn't say oh
[1:13:05] because there is a rock beneath i am
[1:13:08] going to just cease no
[1:13:09] they just grow anyhow
[1:13:12] they are growing anyhow they never give
[1:13:14] up
[1:13:16] and when those on the good soil are
[1:13:18] burying thousand thousand seeds on a cob
[1:13:22] 500 on a cup 100 on a cup
[1:13:25] that one sometimes would bear maybe 10
[1:13:29] or 20.
[1:13:30] you open it you just see the fruit i
[1:13:32] mean the seeds dotted all around but it
[1:13:35] is a genuine seed
[1:13:38] it is no less a seed
[1:13:41] than the other one it is a genuine seed
[1:13:45] and when the farmer harvests those ones
[1:13:47] with a thousand the 500 the 100 when he
[1:13:50] comes to those ones with the 10 20 seas
[1:13:53] he harvests them
[1:13:54] he doesn't say because you didn't do
[1:13:56] well i'm just abandoning you he will go
[1:13:59] in and he will pick every one of them
[1:14:02] and not only that
[1:14:03] wherever the farmer is going to keep
[1:14:06] those ones with a thousand cops i mean
[1:14:09] with a thousand seats and the 500 seats
[1:14:11] that is the same ban
[1:14:14] in which he is going to keep that cup
[1:14:18] with the two seas the three c's the
[1:14:21] tenses
[1:14:24] look whatever you find yourself doing
[1:14:26] for god
[1:14:27] the bible says they that compare
[1:14:29] themselves among themselves are not wise
[1:14:35] don't see
[1:14:36] whatever you find yourself doing
[1:14:39] no matter how small it is
[1:14:41] do it and do it faithfully
[1:14:46] if god has given you an assignment
[1:14:49] don't look down upon it
[1:14:51] and you say oh this is too small i wish
[1:14:54] i had this one day no
[1:14:57] godliness with contentment is a great
[1:14:59] game
[1:15:00] no matter how small it is
[1:15:03] be happy
[1:15:04] that god has given it to you
[1:15:07] and do it and do it generously
[1:15:11] praise be to god
[1:15:13] do it and do it generously
[1:15:17] the fact that you are struggling is a
[1:15:20] sign that you have life
[1:15:24] praise be to god
[1:15:26] it's a sign
[1:15:28] that there is life in here
[1:15:30] because there are people that are living
[1:15:33] a kind of life and they are comfortable
[1:15:35] living that life
[1:15:39] you get so close to it
[1:15:42] and something in you just kicks up
[1:15:45] and you get so miracle so so so so
[1:15:48] uncomfortable it's a sign
[1:15:51] that there is life in you
[1:15:54] it's not a sign of weakness
[1:15:59] when a man is dead
[1:16:02] what struggles do they have to go
[1:16:03] through
[1:16:05] there is no life in that body
[1:16:08] if you have any struggles it's a sign
[1:16:11] that you have life
[1:16:14] i will restore
[1:16:16] say the lord
[1:16:18] when the brother started this message
[1:16:21] he said the secret of his ministry
[1:16:25] the secret of his ministry
[1:16:28] now when you look at
[1:16:30] the man of god
[1:16:33] with all the miracles the signs the
[1:16:36] wonders
[1:16:38] and he is saying that the secret of my
[1:16:41] ministry was this
[1:16:42] you want to listen
[1:16:45] and he said
[1:16:46] the secret of his ministry was love
[1:16:50] wonderful
[1:16:53] the secret of his ministry
[1:16:55] was nothing but love
[1:16:58] and that he has seen the love
[1:17:01] working human life and in animal life
[1:17:06] and we all know that story about how
[1:17:08] that killer buu
[1:17:09] just came to finish him up
[1:17:12] but he said out of love and then again
[1:17:14] the beast and the maniac
[1:17:16] oh he said out of love
[1:17:20] he spoke to the bull and the beast
[1:17:23] out of love
[1:17:30] love is so so strong a weapon
[1:17:35] not the love of men
[1:17:37] but the love of god
[1:17:42] praise be to god the love of men would
[1:17:45] fail
[1:17:46] you can never trust the love of men
[1:17:49] love me i love you it's no love
[1:17:52] like sunday school this morning
[1:17:55] when brother was playing there was a
[1:17:58] part that said if you have to love and
[1:18:00] be loved back then what have you
[1:18:03] what is so special about it
[1:18:06] if you have to do somebody good because
[1:18:08] they have done you good what is so
[1:18:09] special about it there is nothing
[1:18:13] special about it because the hiddens
[1:18:15] even do that
[1:18:21] human love is just like the what the the
[1:18:23] weather in minnesota
[1:18:27] praise the lord
[1:18:29] you know it's supposed to be spring
[1:18:33] and then you get out and there is snow
[1:18:37] you leave your house in the morning the
[1:18:38] water is good before your weight has
[1:18:40] just changed and it has got so chilly
[1:18:43] you can't depend on human love we are
[1:18:46] talking about the love of god
[1:18:50] and god is an embodiment of love
[1:18:55] we are sons and daughters of the most
[1:18:57] high god
[1:19:00] and love is at the core
[1:19:03] of his dna
[1:19:06] and if you are child of god you have the
[1:19:08] love of god
[1:19:10] you may not have it today but you are
[1:19:12] working your way there
[1:19:15] praise be to god
[1:19:17] you will have that love of god in you
[1:19:20] why because you are a son of god
[1:19:22] why because you are a daughter of god
[1:19:26] and if god is love
[1:19:28] his children will be loved
[1:19:31] he said love
[1:19:33] love
[1:19:35] was the secret
[1:19:37] of his ministry
[1:19:39] praise be to god
[1:19:42] how i want to pray for love
[1:19:45] that i will have more of the love of god
[1:19:47] in me
[1:19:49] and verbal tells a story
[1:19:52] it is far down my nose i don't know
[1:19:54] which part of it we may never even come
[1:19:56] to it
[1:19:57] but
[1:19:57] talks about the woman he went somewhere
[1:20:00] to go eat and then he saw these two
[1:20:02] drunkards that were sitting with a bowl
[1:20:04] of whiskey
[1:20:07] and
[1:20:08] just described the woman from head to
[1:20:09] toe
[1:20:10] it was not a good picture
[1:20:13] and then he condemned her in his heart
[1:20:16] but when he he just went out to go and
[1:20:19] pray behind the door
[1:20:20] and then he stepped out and a vision
[1:20:23] just broke before him
[1:20:25] and in the vision he saw a world that
[1:20:27] was just hanging in space
[1:20:30] going round and he saw around it a
[1:20:33] rainbow
[1:20:36] and then he heard a voice
[1:20:38] that if it hadn't been for the blood of
[1:20:40] the lord jesus
[1:20:43] that is holding the wrath of god god
[1:20:46] would have consumed this earth destroyed
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:51] but it is the blood the blood
[1:20:54] the blood of the lord jesus that is
[1:20:57] holding back his wrath
[1:21:00] and then as he was looking he saw a man
[1:21:02] then he drew closer
[1:21:04] and he saw
[1:21:05] that he was just bleeding
[1:21:08] he was just bloody
[1:21:10] all over
[1:21:11] a bloody man
[1:21:13] when he said hanging on one side
[1:21:16] and it was the lord jesus christ
[1:21:18] and then he came closer
[1:21:22] and
[1:21:24] the lord told him
[1:21:26] that
[1:21:29] my my blood
[1:21:31] has just served us as a bumper
[1:21:34] as a bumper around you
[1:21:37] and you know what the bumper of a car
[1:21:38] does
[1:21:40] so my blood sucks as a bumper around you
[1:21:43] and then he was still looking at it he
[1:21:45] said oh lord i'm so sorry he started
[1:21:47] apologizing and then he saw a book
[1:21:50] lying by his side
[1:21:52] written all over sins with sins written
[1:21:55] all over it
[1:21:57] and then he took that book
[1:21:59] my brother said on it was written his
[1:22:01] name
[1:22:02] but the lord took that book and wrote on
[1:22:04] it with his blood pardon
[1:22:07] and then put it on his side and the lord
[1:22:09] turned to him and said you see i have
[1:22:11] pardoned you
[1:22:12] but you are condemning that woman
[1:22:18] let's learn to be merciful
[1:22:24] be merciful
[1:22:26] if you see people in the condition
[1:22:29] don't be too hasty to condemn
[1:22:32] show mercy
[1:22:34] brother brother said he went back inside
[1:22:36] there and when he got in there the other
[1:22:38] drunkard partner had left
[1:22:40] he had to go use the room or something
[1:22:42] and then he went to hell
[1:22:44] and then
[1:22:46] he just
[1:22:47] is a 65 year old woman old enough to be
[1:22:50] his grandmother and she was trying to
[1:22:52] put his i said no
[1:22:55] he said i'm brother branham he said oh i
[1:22:57] need a man in the arena he said yes
[1:23:00] he said have you been a christian before
[1:23:02] you say yes i was one time but i got
[1:23:05] married and a man blah blah blah blah
[1:23:08] blah and now i might
[1:23:10] and then brother braham said
[1:23:12] that
[1:23:14] god is willing to forgive you
[1:23:17] he said oh is he ready to accept me the
[1:23:20] way i am he said yes
[1:23:22] and right there and then she gave up her
[1:23:24] life
[1:23:25] and he went on to say that what the
[1:23:27] world is actually looking for is love
[1:23:34] that is what they are looking for
[1:23:36] and you wonder how would they know that
[1:23:39] you have love for them
[1:23:41] if a bull
[1:23:44] can sense the love of god
[1:23:48] if beasts
[1:23:51] know what the love of god is
[1:23:53] and they could sense it
[1:23:58] then it shows that
[1:24:00] if there is love there
[1:24:04] people around you would sense it
[1:24:10] sometimes
[1:24:12] like i said before
[1:24:14] the love is not there
[1:24:16] sometimes it is infatuation
[1:24:20] infatuation
[1:24:22] is as good as love
[1:24:24] until there is trouble
[1:24:27] if you think you love somebody well
[1:24:29] enough wait until they offend you
[1:24:32] and see whether there is still love
[1:24:35] then you know yes there is love
[1:24:38] but if that love is until something
[1:24:40] happens
[1:24:41] and you can point to it and say from
[1:24:44] that time i didn't like him anymore it
[1:24:46] shows that he didn't even love you from
[1:24:47] the beginning
[1:24:49] praise be to god
[1:24:52] what the people need is love they want
[1:24:56] to see the love of god
[1:24:59] they are hungry
[1:25:02] for the love
[1:25:04] of god
[1:25:05] and this is the love of god that brings
[1:25:07] the results
[1:25:08] paul said
[1:25:10] even though i speak in the tongues of
[1:25:12] men
[1:25:13] and angels
[1:25:14] and have not love
[1:25:16] it profiteth nothing
[1:25:20] and he goes on to talk about if there
[1:25:22] are if there are if there are if there
[1:25:24] are prophecies if there are signs if
[1:25:26] there are wonders they will fail and
[1:25:28] they will cease yes
[1:25:30] but the love of god would never fail
[1:25:34] praise be to god
[1:25:40] i will restore
[1:25:44] i will restore
[1:25:46] sayeth the lord
[1:25:49] praise be to god
[1:25:54] when god created the heavens and the
[1:25:55] earth
[1:26:00] and everything was perfect in the garden
[1:26:06] and there was no man to till the earth
[1:26:10] and god found man out of the dust of the
[1:26:12] earth
[1:26:14] and gave man dominion
[1:26:17] over everything
[1:26:19] everything there is in the garden
[1:26:23] there was perfect harmony
[1:26:26] there was peace
[1:26:29] there was tranquility
[1:26:31] everything was in order
[1:26:34] man had dominion over the creation of
[1:26:37] god
[1:26:39] but that was going to be the state
[1:26:42] because there was an unwanted guest
[1:26:44] in the garden
[1:26:47] the bible says in the midst of the
[1:26:49] garden there were two trees
[1:26:51] the god commanded his children they
[1:26:53] could eat of any of the trees in the
[1:26:55] garden but of the tree in the midst of
[1:26:58] the garden they should not touch it or
[1:27:00] even eat it for the very day they eat
[1:27:02] they would die
[1:27:04] but you know
[1:27:06] the adventure of man didn't start today
[1:27:11] mine became so adventurous we know the
[1:27:13] story how they ended up eating it
[1:27:16] now growing up we always said it was it
[1:27:18] was it was it was it was it was an apple
[1:27:21] it was an apple and we had so
[1:27:24] religiously to it
[1:27:26] maybe for one or two who are here
[1:27:30] now we know by the grace of god
[1:27:33] that it was not an april the 8th
[1:27:37] the god we are serving is the same
[1:27:38] yesterday today and forever
[1:27:41] if he did one thing yesterday under some
[1:27:44] condition he would do it again today
[1:27:46] under the same condition
[1:27:48] if people ate apple if they ate apple
[1:27:51] and they realized they were naked and
[1:27:53] their house opened
[1:27:54] then when we eat apple today we should
[1:27:56] go through that
[1:28:02] as the prophet god would say let's pass
[1:28:04] on the apple
[1:28:05] and see
[1:28:07] how many people will eat it
[1:28:10] and then realize they're in their
[1:28:11] birthday suit
[1:28:14] let's pass on the apple
[1:28:17] but in the garden
[1:28:19] there was a creature as the bread of god
[1:28:22] said that was so close to man
[1:28:25] so close
[1:28:27] till his blood
[1:28:29] could mingle with the blood of man
[1:28:33] and the devil realizing that
[1:28:36] went through that serpent
[1:28:38] to go and beguile the woman
[1:28:40] causing the fall
[1:28:42] and when that happened
[1:28:46] when that happened
[1:28:48] man started running away from god
[1:28:51] and the beast of the field started
[1:28:53] running away from man because they
[1:28:54] couldn't trust man anymore
[1:28:58] adam lost his authority
[1:29:01] he lost his power
[1:29:04] as a son of god remember he didn't lose
[1:29:07] his sonship
[1:29:10] eve did not lose
[1:29:12] if there is no way that forgive me her
[1:29:14] daughtership
[1:29:16] praise be to god
[1:29:18] they were still children of god
[1:29:20] but they had lost that authority when
[1:29:22] adam could just come up in the morning
[1:29:24] and tell this mountain move i want to
[1:29:26] see the sun
[1:29:28] yes
[1:29:29] i mean
[1:29:30] there was no suspicion between the
[1:29:32] animals
[1:29:34] but because of that one single act
[1:29:37] now
[1:29:38] all the animals
[1:29:40] were at loggerheads
[1:29:43] there was confusion there was death
[1:29:45] sickness
[1:29:47] farming
[1:29:49] all because of that one act
[1:29:53] but god still wanted to have
[1:29:55] a relationship
[1:29:59] with his children
[1:30:02] the love of god
[1:30:04] don't ever estimate the love of god
[1:30:11] god still had love for his children
[1:30:15] never underestimate the love of god what
[1:30:18] the love of god can do in the life of a
[1:30:20] man
[1:30:24] in the first place
[1:30:27] none of us did anything to marry the
[1:30:28] love of god
[1:30:30] what could you as a human being have
[1:30:33] done to marriage the love of god
[1:30:36] nothing
[1:30:38] god just loved us because he loved us
[1:30:42] end of story
[1:30:44] it was not because of your works
[1:30:48] and if you did not do anything to
[1:30:51] marriage the love of god do you think
[1:30:53] there is anything you can do to lose the
[1:30:55] love of god
[1:30:59] there is nothing you can do to lose the
[1:31:00] love of god
[1:31:02] if you decide to be wayward
[1:31:05] if you decide to be wayward
[1:31:07] you only make life
[1:31:10] more difficult for yourself
[1:31:15] but god would not lose you
[1:31:19] and god offered himself a lamb and he
[1:31:22] clothed them with the animal's king
[1:31:25] now through that act
[1:31:27] if
[1:31:28] conceived
[1:31:30] and when adam knew his wife
[1:31:34] she conceived
[1:31:35] so now
[1:31:36] there were two
[1:31:39] twins in the womb of eve
[1:31:45] now brother brother trace
[1:31:48] he talks about the two spirits
[1:31:51] the spirit of god in the spirit of the
[1:31:53] devil he traces right from the garden
[1:31:56] from the two trees
[1:31:59] now they have taken on a different form
[1:32:02] word of god one of the devil in the womb
[1:32:05] of eve
[1:32:07] cain was of his father the devil king
[1:32:09] was not of god
[1:32:11] and abel was of his father adam and
[1:32:14] others of god so abel was of god
[1:32:17] and then
[1:32:18] here they come
[1:32:20] they gave they i if if it gives birth
[1:32:24] and now they are in the same house can
[1:32:25] you imagine
[1:32:27] right in the midst of the garden
[1:32:29] those two trees stood side by side
[1:32:34] and here they are in the womb of if
[1:32:37] side by
[1:32:38] side
[1:32:40] now they are born in the same home
[1:32:43] side by side
[1:32:46] and you can trace
[1:32:49] you can trace the two rules
[1:32:52] and again today this morning sunday
[1:32:54] school
[1:32:56] brother jordan just tied right on
[1:32:58] tracing the genealogy of the lord jesus
[1:33:01] christ
[1:33:02] and again you can trace
[1:33:04] the energy all the way from the tree of
[1:33:08] the knowledge of good and evil through
[1:33:10] cain nimrod you can trace that all the
[1:33:13] way to judas
[1:33:17] praise be to god
[1:33:19] and again
[1:33:23] jesus
[1:33:25] judas
[1:33:26] side by side
[1:33:29] side by side
[1:33:35] those two spirits
[1:33:38] are always side by side
[1:33:41] side by side we'll get there very soon
[1:33:44] now brad brown says something
[1:33:48] when those two children
[1:33:50] grilled
[1:33:52] and they were offering a sacrifice
[1:33:56] but branham said
[1:33:58] that cain
[1:34:00] was a true believer
[1:34:02] in god i'm quoting what the
[1:34:05] prophet said that he was a true believer
[1:34:08] in god
[1:34:10] not a make believer
[1:34:12] that makes the hell on your back to
[1:34:14] stand up right
[1:34:16] i know i don't have some
[1:34:19] praise be to god
[1:34:20] he was a true believer
[1:34:26] as much as abel was
[1:34:32] say you believe in god can't believe in
[1:34:34] god
[1:34:35] you say you pray to god can't pray to
[1:34:37] god
[1:34:39] you say you offer sacrifices to god can
[1:34:41] offer sacrifices to god
[1:34:45] and as a matter of fact
[1:34:47] if it was just by sight between the two
[1:34:50] altars the author of ken was by far more
[1:34:54] beautiful than the author of abel
[1:34:58] he had everything so organized
[1:35:00] so religious and it was so beautiful but
[1:35:03] god was not in it
[1:35:06] the only difference there was between
[1:35:08] ken and abel
[1:35:10] was that
[1:35:11] a bear
[1:35:12] by revelation knew what god was looking
[1:35:15] for
[1:35:18] because he heard of the fall
[1:35:21] and how god came down and offered a lamp
[1:35:24] for a sacrifice so he knew that it had
[1:35:27] to be by blood
[1:35:29] and can you imagine he was a keeper of
[1:35:31] sheep he went there just caught one
[1:35:32] sheep just came on the field
[1:35:35] took us a crooked stone a rust stone
[1:35:38] started gushing the throat of the of the
[1:35:40] sheep
[1:35:41] and by the time he was done he was
[1:35:43] bloody all over a bloody mess
[1:35:46] but god was satisfied in that
[1:35:51] it is either according to the parting of
[1:35:54] god or you have missed it
[1:35:59] it has to be by god's provided way if it
[1:36:01] is not according to god's provided way
[1:36:03] you have missed it
[1:36:06] do not put your personal opinion into it
[1:36:11] your feelings must get out of it
[1:36:15] it may not make sense to you
[1:36:17] it doesn't have to make sense to you
[1:36:21] do it because it is the will of god
[1:36:24] do it because the word of god says so
[1:36:27] now even though i don't understand it
[1:36:30] i'm going to do it anyhow because it is
[1:36:32] the word of god
[1:36:34] praise be to god
[1:36:38] and
[1:36:41] revelation
[1:36:43] upon this rock of revelation i built my
[1:36:45] church and the gates of hell will not
[1:36:47] prevail against it revelation is so
[1:36:49] important
[1:36:51] so so so important
[1:36:54] that is what
[1:36:55] differentiates
[1:36:58] between a true believer
[1:37:00] and somebody that is just plain religion
[1:37:05] it doesn't take religion to please god
[1:37:10] you can kill yourself it doesn't take
[1:37:12] religion to please god
[1:37:16] god is not in the beauty of it no
[1:37:19] it doesn't take religion
[1:37:22] and without revelation
[1:37:25] without revelation
[1:37:28] the bible says the letter killeth
[1:37:31] but the spirit giveth life
[1:37:33] without revelation
[1:37:34] all you have is the letter
[1:37:38] the best you can become is an
[1:37:40] intellectual giant
[1:37:44] but there is nothing here
[1:37:51] it takes
[1:37:52] a revelation
[1:37:56] to get in there
[1:38:00] praise be to god
[1:38:03] and we know the story how cain killed
[1:38:06] abel and god appointed herself in his
[1:38:09] place and then
[1:38:11] the story goes on and on and on
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:14] there was confusion
[1:38:20] every time the devil makes a move
[1:38:23] god makes a move
[1:38:27] the devil had made a move
[1:38:31] now when you go to the book of
[1:38:32] revelations
[1:38:35] when john
[1:38:36] in his partner's uh of
[1:38:39] island of fact was vision
[1:38:41] why he saw that there was a book and the
[1:38:44] hand of heather sat on the throne
[1:38:47] and
[1:38:48] cried who is ready to take this book
[1:38:52] to open the season to losing it thereof
[1:38:54] there was nobody
[1:38:56] but there was a lamp
[1:38:57] right from the midst of the throne of
[1:38:59] god that came and took that book
[1:39:02] and opened the seals
[1:39:06] and that lamp
[1:39:07] that lambda was slain
[1:39:10] before the foundation of the world was
[1:39:12] going to come to destroy every work of
[1:39:15] the enemy
[1:39:17] every time the devil makes a move god
[1:39:19] makes a move it's like that it's it's
[1:39:21] just like the chess the chess game
[1:39:23] i have never played chess before
[1:39:26] i remember making fun of it one time
[1:39:28] i don't know how to play chess
[1:39:30] but one thing i know
[1:39:32] that there are always two hands
[1:39:36] when one hand makes a move
[1:39:40] you can't move twice at a time
[1:39:42] another hand also comes and make a
[1:39:44] counter move
[1:39:47] so for every time
[1:39:49] the devil makes a move
[1:39:51] an inferior move god makes
[1:39:55] a counter move
[1:39:58] a superior one
[1:40:03] the bible says when the enemy comes
[1:40:05] against us like a flood the spirit of
[1:40:07] god will lift up a standard against him
[1:40:11] for every time the devil makes a move
[1:40:15] god also makes a move
[1:40:17] we are the marbles on the chessboard
[1:40:21] you don't decide what you want to do
[1:40:24] you don't decide where you want to go
[1:40:27] but there is a divine hand
[1:40:30] that controls your life
[1:40:33] the bible says the sense of the
[1:40:35] righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:40:37] there is a divine hand that keeps
[1:40:40] telling you that sometimes you don't
[1:40:42] even know what you are doing
[1:40:44] but you know that god is in control
[1:40:48] praise be to god
[1:40:50] anytime the devil makes a move
[1:40:53] god makes a move
[1:40:55] the devil had made a move
[1:40:57] i will restore
[1:40:59] i will restore it means that once upon a
[1:41:01] time
[1:41:04] everything was beautiful
[1:41:07] once upon a time it was good
[1:41:10] once upon a time it was a life
[1:41:13] but now it has gone wrong
[1:41:16] it is dead there is confusion there is
[1:41:19] chaos
[1:41:22] that i am going to restore
[1:41:25] it is a promise
[1:41:35] i have a few things here
[1:41:44] now
[1:41:47] our resource here the lord
[1:41:53] um let me take
[1:41:55] i have cast a whole lot of paragraphs
[1:42:01] okay now
[1:42:03] the palmer worm
[1:42:06] rarely speaking the conquer worm the
[1:42:09] caterpillar
[1:42:10] they feed on the leaves
[1:42:13] and the tender branches
[1:42:16] now before i get there yes i said note i
[1:42:19] just wrote down
[1:42:21] now
[1:42:21] when these conquer worms and the palmer
[1:42:23] worms and the catapillars come they
[1:42:25] don't come to uproot the tree
[1:42:29] they don't come with a chainsaw to cut
[1:42:31] it down
[1:42:32] they just go to the leaves
[1:42:35] and then they feed on the leaves and
[1:42:36] they destroy it
[1:42:38] now guess what
[1:42:40] the life of the plant or the life of the
[1:42:43] tree
[1:42:44] depends on the leaves
[1:42:47] because when sun shines
[1:42:50] the leaves pick the energy from the sun
[1:42:53] and they use that to prepare their food
[1:42:56] and then that goes through the plant
[1:42:58] goes through the lifeline and then
[1:43:00] that's how the plant gets its food
[1:43:02] so these worms they'll go and then they
[1:43:05] cut off
[1:43:07] the sauce
[1:43:09] of food for the plant
[1:43:12] and a human being when you don't eat you
[1:43:15] die
[1:43:16] i don't know for how long
[1:43:19] but if you don't eat eventually you die
[1:43:23] some may die before others
[1:43:28] but eventually everybody would die
[1:43:31] and the same way
[1:43:33] when a plant is not getting its food
[1:43:36] it will die
[1:43:38] so what the plant did these swamps do
[1:43:41] they just come and then they interrupt
[1:43:44] the food supply of the tree
[1:43:47] and because then the food is not that
[1:43:49] the tree is not getting its food it ends
[1:43:51] up dying
[1:43:53] if the devil can get you away from the
[1:43:55] word of god
[1:43:57] the bible says
[1:44:00] that
[1:44:02] what is this scripture
[1:44:05] it's a very common scripture can
[1:44:06] somebody help me
[1:44:10] that we do not leave our bread alone but
[1:44:12] by every word
[1:44:14] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:44:19] so our soul
[1:44:21] feeds on the word of god
[1:44:25] if the devil can get you away from the
[1:44:27] word of god
[1:44:29] he is done with you
[1:44:32] he is done with you
[1:44:35] you'll be living physically but
[1:44:37] spiritually you are dead
[1:44:40] and that is what
[1:44:42] these worms do
[1:44:47] so they interfere
[1:44:49] with the full supply
[1:44:51] now the brother says
[1:44:53] that which the catholic church
[1:44:55] have left have the lutherans eating
[1:44:58] and that which the lutherans have left
[1:45:00] have the wesleyans eating
[1:45:02] and that which the westerners have left
[1:45:04] have the presbyter
[1:45:06] eating
[1:45:07] according okay very good
[1:45:12] uh in the message why i am not a holy
[1:45:14] roller
[1:45:17] god sent
[1:45:19] us his prophet
[1:45:22] micah 4 5 and 6
[1:45:24] into brackets
[1:45:25] restoring us
[1:45:27] to the faith of our fathers
[1:45:30] i will restore say the lord
[1:45:34] it wasn't brother branham
[1:45:37] it was god restoring the church
[1:45:40] beloved
[1:45:42] i give you all diligence
[1:45:44] to write unto you
[1:45:47] of the common salvation
[1:45:49] that you would endlessly content for
[1:45:53] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:45:56] saints i said this today
[1:46:00] if you believe me
[1:46:02] to be god's servant
[1:46:04] you are now living in the day of
[1:46:06] restoration of the faith
[1:46:08] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:46:11] living under the power of the latter
[1:46:13] reign
[1:46:14] of the holy ghost church
[1:46:16] thus raising today
[1:46:18] calling great doctrines of divinities
[1:46:21] of everything
[1:46:23] out of all the denominations
[1:46:27] and that was
[1:46:28] his ministry to turn the hearts
[1:46:32] of the children to the faith
[1:46:35] of the apostolic fathers
[1:46:37] what was he doing
[1:46:39] restoring
[1:46:42] a message
[1:46:43] to restore us
[1:46:45] to restore us
[1:46:50] to the faith
[1:46:53] of our fathers
[1:47:03] now
[1:47:04] notice
[1:47:07] after a while
[1:47:09] down come the wind again
[1:47:11] with a great gush that was when the
[1:47:14] prophet went for a hunting expedition
[1:47:16] and um
[1:47:17] he was telling us this story
[1:47:20] and those old trees
[1:47:23] just moaned and groaned i thought well
[1:47:28] what wha wha what does this mean
[1:47:32] and a little text
[1:47:34] over in endural come to my mind
[1:47:37] what the palmer worm has left
[1:47:40] has the caterpillar eating
[1:47:42] what a caterpillar has left
[1:47:44] has the locals eating
[1:47:47] and all these little insects
[1:47:51] i was thinking on that
[1:47:54] that each of those insects
[1:47:57] are all the same insect
[1:48:00] it's just a different spirit
[1:48:03] goes away as one
[1:48:05] and comes back
[1:48:07] as another
[1:48:09] the palmer when caterpillar locus
[1:48:13] is all the same insect
[1:48:15] and then just a different stage of it of
[1:48:17] his life
[1:48:21] and i thought
[1:48:23] yes that's right
[1:48:26] well then i see why the lord has stopped
[1:48:28] me here
[1:48:31] these churches you know
[1:48:33] they stand way up high
[1:48:35] like that
[1:48:37] they build their spire until
[1:48:41] is so high it looks all over the city
[1:48:45] and mine just about as dead
[1:48:49] as the three wolves
[1:48:52] there were one streets sure
[1:48:57] they were all filled with a spirit
[1:49:01] way back under the lutron
[1:49:04] and metal this age and so forth
[1:49:08] but what the nutrients left
[1:49:11] the method is
[1:49:12] eating what the method is left
[1:49:15] the baptist
[1:49:16] got it
[1:49:18] and why the baptist left the pentagon
[1:49:21] has got it
[1:49:22] oh the poor trees eating down
[1:49:25] that's just about all there was
[1:49:29] to it
[1:49:31] back in the beginning
[1:49:33] that tree
[1:49:34] god's heritage baghdad which was his
[1:49:37] vine history it was
[1:49:40] a very new it was a new church
[1:49:42] they had fellowship love
[1:49:45] they had bible doctrine
[1:49:47] they had everything just right
[1:49:49] and along come one insect
[1:49:52] to eat this out
[1:49:54] and another to eat that out
[1:49:57] till it's become nothing
[1:49:59] but a great big old
[1:50:01] empty spooky looking place
[1:50:04] that's about it
[1:50:06] now that's that's
[1:50:08] about right
[1:50:10] and then every time
[1:50:12] the wind blew
[1:50:14] they just moan like
[1:50:16] i said that's right every time god
[1:50:19] repeats
[1:50:20] the pentecostal experience the only
[1:50:23] thing these big old
[1:50:26] marks can do
[1:50:27] is to stand there and go
[1:50:31] days of miracles surpassed
[1:50:36] there is no such thing as that
[1:50:38] just as spooky as it can be
[1:50:42] to try to drive the people away
[1:50:45] from it
[1:50:47] i thought well
[1:50:48] then why
[1:50:50] do you send me
[1:50:53] do you send me the wind lord
[1:50:57] why do you send it anyhow
[1:51:00] they are done they are finished they
[1:51:03] will never receive it
[1:51:05] just like them old cow heights
[1:51:07] was
[1:51:09] done dried and set
[1:51:11] there is no way of trying to tell them
[1:51:13] anything
[1:51:15] because they would never believe it
[1:51:19] they done got set
[1:51:21] and callused and dried out
[1:51:24] and that's all about it
[1:51:26] i thought why do you send me
[1:51:29] why do you send the wind then
[1:51:32] but then i remembered joe i remember
[1:51:35] jewel said
[1:51:37] i will restore
[1:51:38] say the lord
[1:51:44] i will give back
[1:51:45] to you
[1:51:47] all the years
[1:51:50] the caterpillar
[1:51:51] has eaten
[1:51:53] and the locust has eaten
[1:51:56] why would it be lord
[1:51:59] and i noticed
[1:52:01] down underneath these dry
[1:52:04] trees
[1:52:06] come up a bunch of undergrowth
[1:52:09] a little bunch of trees
[1:52:12] they are green
[1:52:14] that's true
[1:52:15] the church might act
[1:52:17] a little green
[1:52:19] but brother
[1:52:20] is flexible to the wind
[1:52:23] of god
[1:52:24] when it blows
[1:52:28] every time the wind would blow
[1:52:30] those little trees
[1:52:32] just laughed and jumped enjoyed boy i
[1:52:35] said if that and an old-fashioned
[1:52:38] pentecostal meeting
[1:52:40] i never seen one
[1:52:43] oh them little trees
[1:52:46] when the wind blows are flexible
[1:52:50] they don't say
[1:52:52] i can't go to that meeting
[1:52:54] i am a presbyterian
[1:52:56] i don't belong to the assemblies oh i
[1:52:59] wouldn't cooperate
[1:53:00] with that at all you all steve
[1:53:03] starts half dead
[1:53:05] what's the matter
[1:53:08] what we need today
[1:53:10] is a restoration
[1:53:12] of the genuine pentecostal
[1:53:14] shaking down experience
[1:53:16] in the churches of the living god
[1:53:19] praise be to god
[1:53:21] i thought lord
[1:53:23] will you do it
[1:53:25] then i seen that little bunch of
[1:53:26] backwash they called what they they
[1:53:29] called us
[1:53:32] they spoilers
[1:53:33] or offcast or whatever it is
[1:53:36] but i say well
[1:53:39] they were green
[1:53:41] they might be green
[1:53:44] but they are flexible to the wind
[1:53:47] they can give
[1:53:49] but then they got life in them
[1:53:51] anyhow
[1:53:53] that's one good thing i thought
[1:53:57] what do you shake them
[1:53:59] why do you shake them so hard
[1:54:02] every time you shake a tree it loses its
[1:54:05] roots
[1:54:07] every time you shake a tree it loses its
[1:54:10] roots
[1:54:13] and when the wind comes to tear down the
[1:54:15] tree
[1:54:18] and the tree goes down on one side
[1:54:22] what happens is that the earth under it
[1:54:25] gets so losing
[1:54:28] now the roots
[1:54:30] can go deeper
[1:54:33] and get grounded
[1:54:40] and now it becomes an enemy to the wind
[1:54:46] when trials and temptations come amen
[1:54:50] they don't come
[1:54:52] to just take you out of the way
[1:54:57] they come
[1:54:58] to losing the earth under you
[1:55:05] so you can go deeper
[1:55:09] and possess the earth
[1:55:14] that is what the word of god does in a
[1:55:16] man's life
[1:55:19] this earth here must be possessed
[1:55:24] and the only thing
[1:55:25] sometimes
[1:55:27] we we hate we hate
[1:55:29] we hate
[1:55:31] correction
[1:55:34] we have trials
[1:55:37] beg they are for a good cause
[1:55:42] god will not send you a trial
[1:55:44] because he hates you
[1:55:50] he will not send you a trial because he
[1:55:52] wants you to fail
[1:55:56] because there is a potential in you
[1:55:59] that you do not even have an idea of
[1:56:03] it takes the trials it takes the the
[1:56:06] problems
[1:56:08] to manifest them praise be to god
[1:56:16] without those trials
[1:56:18] you are like a bastard
[1:56:28] there are errors a lot of storms on the
[1:56:30] way
[1:56:32] praise be to god
[1:56:33] i'm watching my time
[1:56:35] there are a lot of storms on the way
[1:56:37] you may be going through one now
[1:56:43] you may know somebody that is going
[1:56:45] through one now
[1:56:48] we used to have a common saying
[1:56:51] that when you see your neighbor's house
[1:56:53] on fire
[1:56:54] there is a time to get water ready
[1:56:59] by us
[1:57:00] because after the fire is done consume
[1:57:02] your neighbor's house it may be your
[1:57:04] turn
[1:57:06] that is not a time to stand and laugh
[1:57:11] it's a time to get ready
[1:57:13] because when that fire is done it may be
[1:57:15] your turn
[1:57:20] you may be going through now
[1:57:22] you may know somebody that is going
[1:57:23] through one now
[1:57:25] it is not a time to call them names
[1:57:28] a lot of the times we know why they are
[1:57:30] even going through it more than they
[1:57:32] themselves know it
[1:57:34] we have reason for everything
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:38] we seem to know why
[1:57:40] everybody is going through what they are
[1:57:41] going through
[1:57:45] if there was any time
[1:57:47] we should just get prepared and get
[1:57:49] ready and seek the face of god and be in
[1:57:52] our prayer mode
[1:57:53] it is now
[1:57:58] praise be to god
[1:58:01] i will restore
[1:58:04] i will restore save the lord
[1:58:10] when the storms come
[1:58:12] the tree is not happy
[1:58:18] when the storm is blowing and you hear
[1:58:20] the sound of the leaves
[1:58:23] we don't know what the tree is saying
[1:58:25] but it could be crying and shouting lord
[1:58:28] have mercy of me forgive me help me if
[1:58:31] you save my life i'll be a better child
[1:58:33] that's what they may be saying
[1:58:36] but after that storm is passed
[1:58:38] and then the root just balances itself
[1:58:42] and then it starts gapping the soil and
[1:58:44] then it stands up again next time the
[1:58:46] same storm comes
[1:58:47] the tree is standing
[1:58:49] that is when the tree begins to
[1:58:51] appreciate
[1:58:52] what the lord has done
[1:58:58] when a storm comes your way
[1:59:01] and you go through that storm
[1:59:05] your life is never the same
[1:59:09] you may never realize it
[1:59:12] but your life is never the same
[1:59:16] next time the same storm comes it
[1:59:18] doesn't even move you
[1:59:22] it will take a bigger storm
[1:59:25] to kind of shake you a little
[1:59:27] and then again you get grounded
[1:59:31] and before you aware
[1:59:33] you get to a place
[1:59:35] and you wonder how did i get here it's
[1:59:37] just the grace of god
[1:59:41] it's not what you have been able to do
[1:59:43] there is nothing you can do is what he
[1:59:46] has done
[1:59:47] we are depending on his finished works
[1:59:52] it is not what you can do
[1:59:54] what can amend you
[1:59:57] absolutely nothing
[1:59:59] we are depending on his finished works
[2:00:03] praise be to god
[2:00:14] at every time we open up our house
[2:00:17] and let the holy spirit come into us
[2:00:21] it shakes the roots
[2:00:25] loose so that we can grow down
[2:00:29] and get a better hold
[2:00:32] on christ jesus
[2:00:34] praise be to god
[2:00:37] i'm called
[2:00:39] on the rock that cannot
[2:00:41] fail
[2:00:43] grounded safe
[2:00:45] at last
[2:00:46] in the savior's love
[2:00:50] we the church
[2:00:52] knees today now what the church needs
[2:00:54] today
[2:00:55] is
[2:00:56] opening up
[2:00:58] and get green
[2:01:00] don't
[2:01:01] try
[2:01:02] to be um
[2:01:04] i i am a doctor
[2:01:08] phd my pastor is
[2:01:10] what what what um
[2:01:12] what does that mean anyhow
[2:01:15] did you say
[2:01:17] in the bible deity means dumb dog
[2:01:21] and i cannot think
[2:01:24] it's changed very much since then that's
[2:01:27] right brother
[2:01:30] we don't need dds
[2:01:33] we need
[2:01:34] a holy ghost experience
[2:01:36] in the church of the living god
[2:01:39] you know that's true
[2:01:41] we need to be greened up
[2:01:45] living up
[2:01:46] if life makes you add green
[2:01:49] then go ahead and get life that's right
[2:01:52] the lifeline hasn't been cut
[2:01:55] the caterpillars hasn't been eaten
[2:01:58] oh brother
[2:01:59] one of these days
[2:02:01] god is going to come down
[2:02:03] with his great
[2:02:06] insect power a powder
[2:02:09] he is going to spray
[2:02:11] that all stump
[2:02:12] praise be to god
[2:02:14] that is the good thing
[2:02:16] every good farmer
[2:02:18] would not put
[2:02:20] a seed in the soil
[2:02:22] and just let the seed take care of
[2:02:25] itself no
[2:02:27] god would not plant you here
[2:02:30] and let you take care of yourself
[2:02:36] the love that a farmer has for his crops
[2:02:39] it's a farmer loves their crops yes
[2:02:41] i used to go to the farm and i just love
[2:02:44] walking through the farm
[2:02:46] and just get down and then just take the
[2:02:48] plant by the leaves and just admire them
[2:02:52] farmers love their crops
[2:02:56] and the love that a farmer has for his
[2:02:57] crops
[2:02:59] god has a thousand times love for you
[2:03:02] than that type of love
[2:03:07] and when the insects attack the crops
[2:03:09] the farmer doesn't sit down
[2:03:12] no
[2:03:12] that's what the prophet is talking about
[2:03:15] now god will get the insect powder
[2:03:18] because naturally
[2:03:20] the farmer just goes
[2:03:22] and gets some chemicals
[2:03:24] and then he'll come and spray the
[2:03:25] animals
[2:03:26] and make sure he kills them
[2:03:28] so they don't disturb his crops
[2:03:31] his eyes
[2:03:33] are upon the cross
[2:03:35] every stage
[2:03:37] the crop goes through the farmer's eyes
[2:03:40] are upon the crops
[2:03:43] when the weed is trying to overtake the
[2:03:45] crops he comes and he takes the wheels
[2:03:48] away
[2:03:50] when there is insect infestation he
[2:03:52] comes and he kills the insects
[2:03:56] every stage
[2:03:57] of their growth
[2:03:59] his eyes are upon the crops and he loves
[2:04:02] them
[2:04:04] but when a farmer plants a corn he's not
[2:04:06] planting the corn because he wants the
[2:04:08] leaves
[2:04:10] but he is happy when he sees the leaves
[2:04:13] looking so green and fresh
[2:04:16] and when the flower
[2:04:18] he gets happier
[2:04:20] but he has nothing to do with the
[2:04:21] flowers
[2:04:23] and when you see the crops coming
[2:04:26] oh there is more joy
[2:04:28] but that is not what is waiting
[2:04:31] he is looking for the seed
[2:04:35] and when they begin to tussle
[2:04:38] they are beginning to bear the fruits
[2:04:40] and he see the seas
[2:04:42] oh praise be to god
[2:04:45] then it's all joy
[2:04:48] so from planting the seed to harvest
[2:04:52] the farmer's eyes
[2:04:54] are upon the crops every single moment
[2:04:57] and the lord's eyes
[2:04:59] are upon his children every single
[2:05:02] moment
[2:05:03] whatever it is that you are going
[2:05:05] through
[2:05:06] the lost eyes are upon you
[2:05:09] you might think that you are alone you
[2:05:12] have never been alone
[2:05:14] you have never been alone and you will
[2:05:17] never be alone
[2:05:19] every single step you take the eyes of
[2:05:22] the lord are upon you
[2:05:24] he has made us a promise
[2:05:26] god is not slack concerning his promise
[2:05:29] as some man counts likeness
[2:05:31] but he is not suffering towards us
[2:05:34] that he may bring us onto an expected
[2:05:36] end
[2:05:38] whatever promise he has made he will
[2:05:40] keep his promise
[2:05:42] praise be to god sometimes you get in
[2:05:45] the midst of the storm and you think
[2:05:47] that god has forgotten you that is when
[2:05:50] god is closest
[2:05:53] like a song i love to talk about almost
[2:05:56] every time but i almost almost every
[2:05:58] time i forget of the title also
[2:06:02] praise be to god amen
[2:06:06] i've forgotten again
[2:06:08] but this is the story
[2:06:12] that
[2:06:12] oh one step one is one step at a time
[2:06:15] i'm not sure
[2:06:17] but
[2:06:18] there was this
[2:06:20] according to the song
[2:06:22] that every time he took a step
[2:06:26] he saw another set of footprints yes
[2:06:29] another set of footprints whatever it
[2:06:31] was
[2:06:32] and then he knew
[2:06:34] that god was with him
[2:06:37] because he was seeing his footprints he
[2:06:39] was seeing the other set of footprints
[2:06:42] and then when she got to the thickest
[2:06:44] moment of his life
[2:06:46] when everything seemed to have gone
[2:06:48] wrong
[2:06:50] and he was expecting to see
[2:06:53] those set of
[2:06:54] footprints he wasn't seeing them anymore
[2:06:57] he was only seeing one set of footprints
[2:07:03] and then he complained to the lord
[2:07:06] why have you done this to me
[2:07:09] every time i took a step i could see my
[2:07:12] footprints and i could see your
[2:07:13] footprints and i knew you were with me
[2:07:16] but when i got to the thickest moment of
[2:07:18] my life
[2:07:19] the roughest part of my life when i was
[2:07:22] so trusted to see your footprints i
[2:07:24] wasn't seeing you anymore
[2:07:26] it was just
[2:07:27] one set of footprints
[2:07:30] and the lord said that was when
[2:07:32] i was carrying you
[2:07:35] praise be to god
[2:07:37] and that those set of footprints you
[2:07:39] were seeing they were not yours they
[2:07:42] were mine
[2:07:44] praise be to god amen
[2:07:47] so when you get to the roughest part and
[2:07:49] you think you are alone you think you
[2:07:51] are just by yourself you think god has
[2:07:53] forgotten of you that is when god has
[2:07:56] you in his loving arms
[2:08:00] praise be to god
[2:08:05] the eyes of god
[2:08:08] are upon his children
[2:08:11] every step you take
[2:08:13] god is interested in it
[2:08:17] praise be to god
[2:08:20] he comes with the powder spray
[2:08:22] because he will not allow the animals
[2:08:25] the worms
[2:08:27] to eat down the crop
[2:08:29] and then he comes and he sprays them and
[2:08:32] she's going to grow just as sure as the
[2:08:36] world
[2:08:37] she is going to do it yes say and god
[2:08:40] will restore
[2:08:41] all the years that the locusts and the
[2:08:44] caterpillars eat up
[2:08:46] now on the day of pentecost they had
[2:08:50] they had they had 120
[2:08:53] brand new
[2:08:54] sheepskin bottles
[2:08:57] that's right
[2:08:58] not gold skin
[2:08:59] but sheepskin
[2:09:01] it makes
[2:09:03] the best
[2:09:04] yes sir and 120 green bottles
[2:09:08] was set in the upper room
[2:09:11] praise god
[2:09:12] plenty of stretching
[2:09:15] and
[2:09:16] growing pains they had their house open
[2:09:20] to catch
[2:09:21] everything
[2:09:23] god would pour down
[2:09:25] yes sir today we say i will go over
[2:09:29] there
[2:09:30] but i will not tell you
[2:09:32] what i don't believe i don't care how
[2:09:35] much he brings it out of the bible i
[2:09:38] will never believe it well you all
[2:09:41] cowhide guskin
[2:09:43] what's the matter
[2:09:44] anyhow praise be to god
[2:09:48] we are serving a wonderful god
[2:09:51] we thank god for the prophet of god
[2:09:54] he lays it down anyhow
[2:09:57] you can choose to believe it or not
[2:10:00] doesn't come to say something to please
[2:10:02] you
[2:10:02] of course he will not come to see
[2:10:04] something because he wants to get on
[2:10:06] your necks but just push the word away
[2:10:08] where it belongs
[2:10:10] praise god
[2:10:12] wonderful
[2:10:15] all we
[2:10:18] like sheep
[2:10:20] had gone astray
[2:10:25] it took one month
[2:10:28] sin
[2:10:30] one man
[2:10:33] going of course
[2:10:35] going against the word of god
[2:10:37] to plunge
[2:10:38] the whole humanity into sin
[2:10:42] in sin did my mother conceive me
[2:10:46] in iniquity was i shaping
[2:10:48] come to the world speaking life
[2:10:52] you don't have to tell the first lie to
[2:10:54] be a
[2:10:54] sinner you don't have to steal the first
[2:10:58] meat from the soup from the pot of soup
[2:11:01] to be a sinner
[2:11:02] the reason why you do those things is
[2:11:04] because you are born into it
[2:11:09] and then you come into this life and
[2:11:11] satan has so much control over your life
[2:11:16] every man every woman
[2:11:19] had drifted away
[2:11:22] from the word of god because of one
[2:11:25] man's sin
[2:11:26] but remember we have a promise
[2:11:31] god will always remember his own
[2:11:34] and that which the counterwomen the
[2:11:36] caterpillar has destroyed he is going to
[2:11:38] he's going to restore
[2:11:41] and everything
[2:11:43] everything the devil has stolen
[2:11:46] the devil is a chief
[2:11:48] he careful to steal to kill and to
[2:11:50] destroy
[2:11:51] everything the devil has told him
[2:11:54] is going to be restored
[2:11:57] whether it is of of of your experience
[2:12:00] with god
[2:12:01] whether whether it is of your health
[2:12:04] whether it is of your joy in christ
[2:12:06] whether it is
[2:12:08] whatever whatever it is that the devil
[2:12:10] has stolen

[2:12:14] restore
[2:12:16] and nothing can stop it
[2:12:18] as god said and has not delivered
[2:12:23] has he made a promise
[2:12:24] and has not kept his promise
[2:12:27] all power in heaven and on earth belongs
[2:12:30] to him
[2:12:32] the word of god is true
[2:12:34] the bible says let every man's word be a
[2:12:36] lie but my word be the truth
[2:12:39] there is only one truth and that is the
[2:12:41] word of god
[2:12:43] whatever god has promised he will do he
[2:12:46] is going to do it to the letter there
[2:12:48] are not enough demons in hell that can
[2:12:50] stop the move of god
[2:12:54] praise be to god
[2:12:57] whatever he has promised
[2:13:00] god is obligated to his word amen
[2:13:04] whatever promise he has said he is
[2:13:06] obligated to it
[2:13:08] he is not a liar
[2:13:11] god will bring his word to pass
[2:13:14] whether rain or shine
[2:13:16] praise be to god
[2:13:18] i will restore
[2:13:20] say the
[2:13:28] lord said
[2:13:40] yes
[2:13:44] you may have wandered away
[2:13:49] from the path of righteousness
[2:13:52] you may have gone astray
[2:13:59] but we have a promise
[2:14:03] i will restore
[2:14:08] don't look at you
[2:14:10] because there is nothing good in you to
[2:14:12] look at
[2:14:14] amen
[2:14:17] keep your focus on god
[2:14:22] let your hope and confidence be in the
[2:14:25] word of god
[2:14:27] and this is thus says the lord and the
[2:14:30] power of god said that said the lord
[2:14:31] does not fail
[2:14:36] praise be to god
[2:14:39] keep your focus
[2:14:41] on god
[2:14:42] that is how you see
[2:14:45] god manifesting himself in your life
[2:14:51] don't be a double standard person
[2:14:55] a double standard person cannot receive
[2:14:58] anything from god
[2:15:03] let your faith
[2:15:05] be anchored
[2:15:08] in the world
[2:15:12] it doesn't matter what you are going
[2:15:14] through
[2:15:14] it doesn't matter how far you have
[2:15:16] drifted away from the word of god
[2:15:18] it still does not change
[2:15:20] the promise of god towards you
[2:15:27] today
[2:15:29] you might be afraid of god's son
[2:15:33] who was waiting for his father to die so
[2:15:35] he would inherit
[2:15:38] his the wife of his father
[2:15:41] and the father was living too long
[2:15:44] and he grew so impatient
[2:15:47] went to the father
[2:15:49] and asked for his inheritance the father
[2:15:51] did not deny him
[2:15:53] the father gave it to him
[2:15:55] and we know the story how he went
[2:15:58] and he blasted everything
[2:16:00] and he ended up
[2:16:02] sleeping in pigpens struggling with pigs
[2:16:05] for their food
[2:16:06] i don't think the pigs were happy
[2:16:10] eating their pig's food
[2:16:12] stabbing them
[2:16:14] but it got to a point he couldn't handle
[2:16:16] it anymore
[2:16:18] he couldn't handle it
[2:16:20] he said you know instead of just staying
[2:16:22] here and struggling with these pigs for
[2:16:24] their food
[2:16:25] let me go back home
[2:16:27] my father is a king
[2:16:29] look i don't have to go back and be a
[2:16:30] son i'm ready
[2:16:33] and i'll be happy
[2:16:35] to be a servant in my father's house
[2:16:41] and unknown to him
[2:16:43] the father was always looking in the
[2:16:45] direction
[2:16:46] knowing that one day his son is going to
[2:16:49] come back
[2:16:50] i will restore
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:53] i will restore say the lord
[2:16:56] all the years that the palmer went the
[2:16:59] counterweight the caterpillar has
[2:17:00] destroyed i will stop him
[2:17:04] and then he got up one day
[2:17:06] just started going he didn't care what
[2:17:08] was going to happen oh to his surprise
[2:17:11] he sees his father in the outskirts just
[2:17:14] they just threw harms around each other
[2:17:17] oh daddy i'm sorry i'm sorry daddy said
[2:17:19] you don't have nothing to be sorry about
[2:17:22] i don't deserve to be a son anymore i
[2:17:24] just want to be a servant the father
[2:17:26] says you know what there is no place for
[2:17:28] you in my home as a servant
[2:17:30] i am carrying you home anyhow you are
[2:17:32] still going to be a son
[2:17:34] praise be to god all the years that the
[2:17:37] counterworm has destroyed they are going
[2:17:39] to be
[2:17:40] restored all the years that caterpillar
[2:17:43] has destroyed they are going to be
[2:17:45] restored
[2:17:46] all the years the power have destroyed
[2:17:48] they are going to be restored you are
[2:17:50] not going to be a servant in your
[2:17:52] father's home you are going to be a son
[2:17:54] with authority
[2:17:56] praise be to god
[2:17:58] you may be
[2:18:01] that prodigal son here this morning
[2:18:07] you might be that woman
[2:18:10] that was caught in adultery
[2:18:15] and she knew
[2:18:17] the punishment in advance
[2:18:20] she knew that it was over
[2:18:24] and here they bring hair
[2:18:26] before the lord jesus christ
[2:18:29] we cut this woman in the
[2:18:31] right on
[2:18:32] and they were holding their stones they
[2:18:34] were ready to break his cow
[2:18:39] and then the lord jesus looks at them
[2:18:42] he said let he that is without sin
[2:18:45] be the first to cast the stone
[2:18:48] at that point this woman knew it was
[2:18:51] over
[2:18:53] because these are the people that are
[2:18:55] walking the streets of israel in their
[2:18:57] long ropes
[2:18:59] very holy
[2:19:00] they would have been step on an ant
[2:19:03] very sanctimonious
[2:19:06] that people see them and they bow down
[2:19:09] they're sitting in public places they
[2:19:11] occupy the bases
[2:19:14] and this woman knows that oh this is a
[2:19:16] holy man
[2:19:18] so when the lord jesus said let he does
[2:19:20] if he doesn't cut the first stone she
[2:19:22] knew it was over
[2:19:24] she was just lying down and waiting for
[2:19:26] the first stone
[2:19:27] there was nothing coming
[2:19:29] in any case
[2:19:31] it takes two
[2:19:32] to commit a crime where was the man
[2:19:37] where was the man
[2:19:39] how is it that you're just coming with
[2:19:40] only the woman where is the man
[2:19:44] who knows
[2:19:46] maybe he was one of them
[2:19:51] then the lord jesus started writing in
[2:19:53] the sand
[2:19:54] i don't know maybe he was the first one
[2:19:56] who went close to see what he was
[2:19:57] writing
[2:19:59] and then he saw his name
[2:20:02] you are the first to die before this
[2:20:04] woman
[2:20:06] he said oh i'm out of here
[2:20:08] he trolled down the stone
[2:20:10] started going they were asking where are
[2:20:12] you going he said
[2:20:14] he couldn't even open his mouth to talk
[2:20:18] the next person comes
[2:20:20] he looks
[2:20:22] you are unaccomplished
[2:20:24] you know who
[2:20:26] committed a crime with her
[2:20:28] you have to die
[2:20:30] and they're off they go till they're all
[2:20:33] left
[2:20:36] and then the woman
[2:20:38] the lord left his head
[2:20:42] the woman was expecting to die
[2:20:46] she had got to her wits ends
[2:20:49] she had given up on life
[2:20:52] she knows it was completely done
[2:20:57] but remember we have a promise
[2:21:01] i will restore save the lord
[2:21:05] and the lord prophesied over her life
[2:21:09] go
[2:21:10] and say no more
[2:21:14] go and sin no more
[2:21:20] whatever condition
[2:21:22] you find yourself
[2:21:24] in whatever you have to deal with
[2:21:29] it doesn't matter if all the odds in
[2:21:32] this life are against you
[2:21:34] know that you are a child of god
[2:21:39] god does not make mistakes
[2:21:42] and god has not saved you only to lose
[2:21:44] you
[2:21:47] the good where god has started in you
[2:21:49] he will bring you to a completion
[2:21:52] praise be to god
[2:21:54] nothing can stop it
[2:21:56] don't think that god is teasing you
[2:21:58] like sometimes with these children
[2:22:01] you bring the i don't know maybe some
[2:22:04] sweets and they are lying down you bring
[2:22:06] it so close and then they want to grab
[2:22:08] it and then they are shouting and then
[2:22:10] you are dodging it
[2:22:11] no god is not like that
[2:22:14] god brings it so close because he wants
[2:22:17] to give it
[2:22:20] praise be to god
[2:22:23] praise be to god
[2:22:26] you might be assumption today
[2:22:31] we all know the story of something
[2:22:34] you may be at something today
[2:22:39] diving cut and you are in the enemy's
[2:22:41] camp
[2:22:43] with his eyes plucked out
[2:22:47] and he knew
[2:22:49] had to tell him
[2:22:51] that this is over
[2:22:53] praise be to god
[2:22:55] i don't know about you but i have been
[2:22:57] there before
[2:22:59] when i knew that it was done
[2:23:03] that there was no coming back
[2:23:07] i knew
[2:23:12] but the eyes of god are upon his
[2:23:14] children
[2:23:18] the grace of god a lot of the times we
[2:23:21] try to explain the grace of god
[2:23:24] but
[2:23:24] then you realize that you don't even
[2:23:27] scratch the surface of it
[2:23:29] it is so deep
[2:23:31] and so wide you can't understand the
[2:23:34] grace of god
[2:23:35] you can't understand what the grace of
[2:23:37] god would do in the life of a man or a
[2:23:40] woman
[2:23:44] praise be to god
[2:23:48] grace
[2:23:49] my goodness
[2:23:51] if it hadn't been for the grace of god
[2:23:53] we will not be seated here
[2:23:56] for by grace are we saved
[2:23:58] through faith not of ways
[2:24:02] it is not your strength that has brought
[2:24:04] you this far
[2:24:06] it is not your wisdom
[2:24:08] it's not your intellect
[2:24:10] it's not your education
[2:24:12] that has brought you this far it is the
[2:24:14] grace of god
[2:24:17] it is the grace of god
[2:24:20] a favor
[2:24:21] a favor no man deserves
[2:24:25] praise be to god
[2:24:26] now when you make it tomorrow and you
[2:24:29] get there you know that it's not your
[2:24:31] effort you know it is the grace of god
[2:24:35] can you imagine that if on the cross
[2:24:37] when we gathered that day
[2:24:39] and then you asked that that that thief
[2:24:41] on the cross
[2:24:42] jesus so today you build me in paradise
[2:24:45] and you ask him how did you make it
[2:24:48] praise be to god
[2:24:50] what are you going to hear
[2:24:53] what are you going to hear
[2:24:56] the answer you hear is i don't know
[2:25:00] i don't know how i made it
[2:25:02] but one thing i do know
[2:25:05] that the lord jesus
[2:25:07] gave his all for me
[2:25:10] he died so i would live
[2:25:13] that i made it by grace
[2:25:16] i made it by grace
[2:25:22] and something's eyes plucked out
[2:25:26] and he knew where i am now i'm in the
[2:25:28] enemy's camp
[2:25:30] they have bound me
[2:25:32] there is nothing i can do
[2:25:34] they just stay here and die
[2:25:36] and all the people knew about something
[2:25:39] well something's just come and then
[2:25:40] behave like a clown and they would laugh
[2:25:42] and laugh and laugh both young and old
[2:25:46] and then they hide their fists now all
[2:25:48] the people gathered together from the
[2:25:50] king to his servant
[2:25:52] and they are ready to laugh again
[2:25:55] but something prayed
[2:25:57] and asked god
[2:25:59] one more time
[2:26:01] lord one more time
[2:26:03] to strengthen him one more time
[2:26:07] all that the palmer won
[2:26:10] the conquer worm the caterpillar the
[2:26:12] locusts have eaten
[2:26:15] i will restore says the lord
[2:26:19] his dignity was gone
[2:26:23] they used to mention something's name
[2:26:26] and people will be cooking and they'll
[2:26:28] be jumping over the pot
[2:26:31] that man is coming again people will
[2:26:34] leave their homes
[2:26:37] they will enter behind the door and
[2:26:38] barricade themselves why because
[2:26:40] something is coming
[2:26:42] that name
[2:26:44] that used to bring terror
[2:26:46] on people
[2:26:47] had now become
[2:26:49] a laughingstock
[2:26:53] that meant people who see come and run
[2:26:54] away now they see him there and they
[2:26:57] rather get close
[2:26:59] to make fun of
[2:27:01] the bible says
[2:27:02] our store
[2:27:03] his hair was growing
[2:27:07] but the people's eyes
[2:27:10] were blended to it
[2:27:14] he could feel his hair growing
[2:27:17] and yet
[2:27:18] there are people around him with ice
[2:27:21] they couldn't see the hair coming
[2:27:23] and he knew
[2:27:25] praise be to god
[2:27:28] that the lord is doing something
[2:27:31] and on that day
[2:27:33] when they had got it again
[2:27:35] to make fun
[2:27:36] it was the biggest funeral they ever had
[2:27:41] you may be at something today
[2:27:44] whoever
[2:27:45] whatever condition you find yourselves
[2:27:47] in remember who you are
[2:27:50] that you are a child of god
[2:27:52] you are not just anybody
[2:27:55] you are not just anybody
[2:27:58] know who you are
[2:28:00] and learn to take authority
[2:28:03] wherever you find yourself if there is
[2:28:05] something going on you don't like you
[2:28:07] can talk to god and he will change it
[2:28:10] i remember one time at work
[2:28:13] that was when i went to my new place
[2:28:14] today
[2:28:17] i was cutting a
[2:28:18] i was opening a bag and uh how did i
[2:28:21] call it a piece of a piece of paper went
[2:28:24] into every
[2:28:25] machine
[2:28:28] that was my first time
[2:28:30] and i didn't know what that was going to
[2:28:31] do
[2:28:33] and you know what a lot of the times we
[2:28:35] think
[2:28:36] that
[2:28:37] when you have that special time
[2:28:40] to go before god that is when god
[2:28:43] answers your prayer
[2:28:48] no
[2:28:49] that is good
[2:28:51] that is good
[2:28:52] but you know what a lot of the times
[2:28:55] when you don't even expect god to answer
[2:28:57] that is when he moves
[2:29:00] that is when he moves
[2:29:03] that has amazed me over and over i can't
[2:29:06] get over it
[2:29:10] god moves when you are not respecting
[2:29:12] him
[2:29:14] and i just said a very simple prayer
[2:29:17] it was not quite five minutes and there
[2:29:20] was a blackout in the whole building
[2:29:23] this is a very big place
[2:29:25] we are over a thousand people
[2:29:27] in that building
[2:29:29] it is four floors
[2:29:31] there was a total blackout
[2:29:33] everything went dead and then i went
[2:29:36] down i met one guy
[2:29:39] he said i've been here for seven years
[2:29:40] i've never seen anything like this
[2:29:42] happen
[2:29:45] and the way it happened
[2:29:46] everything we had in the mesa we had to
[2:29:48] dump it
[2:29:52] and i have seen god move
[2:29:55] in very mysterious ways
[2:29:58] you can take authority
[2:30:01] the authority is given to you
[2:30:03] it depends on whether you want to use it
[2:30:05] or not
[2:30:06] but you have it
[2:30:09] don't look mean upon yourself
[2:30:11] can you imagine
[2:30:13] you sitting down with an ak-47 fully
[2:30:16] loaded and then you allow some filthy
[2:30:19] demon to come around you with a whip
[2:30:22] it's whipping you and you're lying
[2:30:23] you're crying god i need your help and
[2:30:26] you're holding ak-47
[2:30:29] is that a situation we find ourselves in
[2:30:31] most of the times
[2:30:34] we are children of god
[2:30:38] with authority
[2:30:41] you can take control
[2:30:43] over every situation
[2:30:46] it is not you
[2:30:48] it's not you
[2:30:50] it's good if you want to put in a prayer
[2:30:52] request
[2:30:54] it's good if you want to ask somebody to
[2:30:55] help you in prayer
[2:30:58] but if you are faced with any situation
[2:31:01] no
[2:31:03] but i ran said prayer can change any
[2:31:06] situation
[2:31:08] not some situations
[2:31:10] but any situation prayer can change any
[2:31:14] situation
[2:31:20] i remember when my wife was pregnant
[2:31:21] with dany
[2:31:23] she had a dream
[2:31:26] that somebody came in the dream to take
[2:31:28] the baby away from her
[2:31:30] that was when she was that was fine even
[2:31:32] before danny was born
[2:31:34] and then she struggled with him in the
[2:31:36] dream
[2:31:37] so when i woke up not that she woke me
[2:31:40] up
[2:31:41] so when i woke up
[2:31:43] she told me the dream
[2:31:46] and i said
[2:31:47] in that was in those days
[2:31:49] 20-something years
[2:31:50] if it's today i wouldn't even worry
[2:31:52] because the devil takes people's faces
[2:31:56] and if you want to fool that in your
[2:31:57] dream
[2:31:59] that would not be a good story
[2:32:02] but what i did then
[2:32:05] i'm not saying it's a good thing
[2:32:07] i said whose face did you see
[2:32:17] she said no i didn't see anybody's face
[2:32:20] no i said she said she saw somebody's
[2:32:22] face but it was a strange face
[2:32:25] then i don't know what came over me
[2:32:28] and i mentioned somebody
[2:32:30] and she said yes
[2:32:32] that was the face you saw
[2:32:35] then we
[2:32:36] prayed lo and behold
[2:32:40] before five am
[2:32:42] that morning
[2:32:44] the woman left the house and she never
[2:32:46] came back
[2:32:49] she left the house and she never came
[2:32:52] back
[2:32:55] when we pray
[2:32:58] something happens
[2:33:02] when you pray
[2:33:03] something happens
[2:33:07] anything
[2:33:09] that you have placed before the lord
[2:33:12] believe
[2:33:13] that god has already granted it
[2:33:16] whatever your heart desires are
[2:33:18] place them before the lord
[2:33:21] and believe
[2:33:23] believe to them that belief all things
[2:33:26] are possible
[2:33:27] believe that god has already answered
[2:33:29] that prayer
[2:33:34] the devil will give you a thousand
[2:33:35] reasons
[2:33:36] why god has not answered that prayer
[2:33:39] but keep holding on
[2:33:41] to that one reason you know
[2:33:43] praise be to god
[2:33:46] wonderful
[2:33:48] to them that belief
[2:33:50] all things
[2:33:52] are possible
[2:33:56] he created
[2:33:58] the world from nothing i'm closing now
[2:34:00] the musicians can come over
[2:34:04] he created the world
[2:34:06] from nothing
[2:34:10] from nothing
[2:34:13] we are serving a creator
[2:34:16] a creator
[2:34:21] they created the world from nothing
[2:34:24] and can you imagine
[2:34:28] if he has your life in a sense to work
[2:34:30] with
[2:34:33] can you imagine what the lord would do
[2:34:37] if you completely
[2:34:39] completely
[2:34:40] totally
[2:34:42] surrender your life to him
[2:34:44] and do not hold back
[2:34:49] a lot of the times we just give him a
[2:34:51] part of our lives
[2:34:53] and there is a part that is so dear to
[2:34:56] us we want to keep holding on
[2:34:58] and that part is killing us
[2:35:00] but we still keep holding on
[2:35:03] till when
[2:35:05] till when
[2:35:08] let
[2:35:09] the lord take complete control
[2:35:13] let him take complete control
[2:35:16] let him take over the steering wheel
[2:35:20] just be the passenger you ought to be
[2:35:24] and let him drive you to safety
[2:35:28] you may not know which direction he is
[2:35:30] going
[2:35:31] but when you know the lord is behind the
[2:35:33] steering wheel that is enough
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:36] that is enough consolation
[2:35:39] to know
[2:35:40] that the lord is in the seat
[2:35:42] that he is in charge that he is in
[2:35:45] control
[2:35:46] praise be to god
[2:35:52] [Music]
[2:35:59] there was just something my brother once
[2:36:01] told me to get ready for service today
[2:36:04] i was torn between two
[2:36:07] [Music]
[2:36:08] but just a little bit of something just
[2:36:10] came from what i was looking at
[2:36:14] that when you see a pilot in the air
[2:36:20] when you see a pilot in the air
[2:36:23] the pilot is in charge
[2:36:26] of the plane
[2:36:27] [Music]
[2:36:28] because the airline has employed him
[2:36:32] and has given him charge
[2:36:34] over the plane
[2:36:36] so he is in charge of the plane
[2:36:40] but the pilot is not in charge of the
[2:36:42] flight
[2:36:42] [Music]
[2:36:46] he is not in charge of the flight
[2:36:48] [Music]
[2:36:50] when you see him in the skies
[2:36:54] [Music]
[2:36:56] there are people somewhere in the
[2:36:58] control tower
[2:37:00] they are telling him
[2:37:02] stay here
[2:37:04] don't go up don't go down
[2:37:07] you are 20 000 feet stay there
[2:37:11] and sometimes i will tell him they'll
[2:37:13] tell the control tower i want to go up
[2:37:15] they'll say nope you're not going up
[2:37:16] stay right there
[2:37:18] [Music]
[2:37:21] then when they are ready to say okay you
[2:37:23] know what go up to 30 000 feet and stay
[2:37:25] there don't move
[2:37:30] there are forces that are in operation
[2:37:35] he is not in charge of the flight
[2:37:40] you may say my life is my life i can do
[2:37:42] anything i want no you can't do anything
[2:37:44] you want
[2:37:46] there is somebody that is in charge
[2:37:49] you go where he wants you to go
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:54] you do what he wants you to do
[2:37:58] when the pilot refused to listen to the
[2:38:01] control tower
[2:38:02] and then he changes his his his flight
[2:38:06] and decides to do anything in the air
[2:38:08] guess what
[2:38:10] there is going to be confusion
[2:38:14] you can be moving across another airline
[2:38:17] you're crashing the air because
[2:38:20] if god terrorists
[2:38:23] will get back to this very topic
[2:38:26] i don't know why this just came
[2:38:28] you know it's under a different thing
[2:38:30] altogether i don't know why it just came
[2:38:32] in
[2:38:33] but i will not keep it i'll just give it
[2:38:35] out
[2:38:37] praise be to god
[2:38:38] but if it's the will of god
[2:38:41] one day
[2:38:42] then we are going to talk about it
[2:38:45] but remember
[2:38:46] that you are not in charge
[2:38:49] when you feel you are in charge then god
[2:38:51] is not in charge
[2:38:55] when you get to the place
[2:38:56] to think that you are in charge then god
[2:38:58] is not in charge
[2:38:59] [Music]
[2:39:07] praise be to god
[2:39:09] i will restore
[2:39:12] say the lord
[2:39:14] remember
[2:39:16] in closing
[2:39:17] god would not force himself
[2:39:22] god will not force himself
[2:39:25] upon any man
[2:39:26] [Music]
[2:39:29] god
[2:39:30] is a gentleman
[2:39:33] the holy spirit would not force himself
[2:39:36] upon any man
[2:39:37] [Music]
[2:39:42] we are free moral agencies
[2:39:47] but god wants you
[2:39:50] to willingly
[2:39:51] surrender unto him
[2:39:56] that when the holy ghost comes
[2:40:00] it is the holy ghost
[2:40:02] who does the restoration
[2:40:05] the holy ghost would bring you to the
[2:40:07] fullness of the word of god
[2:40:10] not halfway
[2:40:12] the holy ghost would restore you
[2:40:15] to the purity of the word
[2:40:20] the holy ghost would restore you to your
[2:40:23] true identity as a child of god
[2:40:29] we hear of identity theft identity theft
[2:40:33] identity theft
[2:40:34] didn't start now
[2:40:36] identity step the devil started identity
[2:40:39] theft
[2:40:41] that he stole our identity
[2:40:43] that we didn't know who we were
[2:40:46] we thought we were the man after this
[2:40:47] flesh
[2:40:48] and everything this first tells us to do
[2:40:50] we do it
[2:40:52] but the holy ghost would restore you
[2:40:55] to your true identity as a child of god
[2:40:59] he's the holy ghost who does the
[2:41:01] restoration
[2:41:06] and the bible the scripture we just read
[2:41:08] [Music]
[2:41:14] can we i just jumped over something but
[2:41:16] if we can turn our bibles to look at us
[2:41:18] we are seated
[2:41:20] [Music]

[2:44:04] have in our lives
[2:44:07] for without the holy ghost the prophet

[2:45:08] don't think god will deny you
[2:45:11] [Music]
[2:45:13] if you have not received the holy ghost
[2:45:16] it is not
[2:45:17] god's fault
