[43:04] we also have a few
[43:10] prayer birthing this morning we continue
[43:13] to remember
[43:14] brother andrews and his family in prayer
[43:17] and uh during the week
[43:21] his first started earlier the week in
[43:24] the beginning of the week
[43:25] sister evie was not feeling well she had
[43:28] some
[43:30] congestion or whatever it was like a
[43:33] breathing
[43:34] issue and she went over to to see the
[43:37] doctor
[43:38] at the end of the week but there was no
[43:41] major
[43:41] problem there with her receiving
[43:45] wolves experienced the same and
[43:48] it's going to see him also in church he
[43:50] went over to the urgent care they did
[43:53] all the tests there was no major problem
[43:55] there
[43:55] so we don't know where that
[43:59] is from but uh now that we don't know we
[44:02] know it is from the devil
[44:03] amen praise the lord i know you're
[44:06] saying your man how can you say we don't
[44:08] know where he's from

[44:17] trusting the lord in and praying and
[44:19] doing
[44:21] everything that we are we are taught to
[44:23] do
[44:24] as we as we all deal with uh
[44:27] of this situation praise the lord
[44:30] amen so uh it's so good to be in the
[44:34] house of the lord
[44:38] last week we were speaking something on
[44:41] the turning point
[44:44] we took 1956 as the turning point
[44:48] there was something i was i was uh
[44:51] i had on my on on my heart that i was
[44:54] going to look at this morning
[44:56] but wednesday night
[44:59] we are continuing our session of prayer
[45:02] meetings
[45:03] wednesday so
[45:06] [Music]
[45:07] i was i was suspecting that uh
[45:11] because brother-in-law told me he was
[45:12] going to be in town so
[45:14] i had in my mind that he was going to
[45:16] testify on wednesday night
[45:18] so uh but he didn't made it in until
[45:20] late thursday
[45:22] and
[45:26] so he will he will come in and testify
[45:29] to us this morning
[45:31] and
[45:34] but i wanted to
[45:37] this was dwelling on my mind last night
[45:41] and and the reason why i saw that
[45:46] it was important
[45:50] is because of all the history
[45:53] of the ages and where we are
[45:56] just like i said uh last week
[46:00] you know uh we re we read a couple of
[46:03] messages where brother branham was
[46:04] talking about
[46:06] you know uh over roberts and allen and
[46:09] tommy osborne every one of them leaving
[46:12] the field to come back home
[46:14] because of what was happening in america
[46:16] when even deed himself did not
[46:18] knew what was happening bill graham and
[46:20] every one of them calling
[46:22] you know the nation back and like i said
[46:24] many of us we were not born
[46:27] you know we were not around 1956. we
[46:30] were not part of the
[46:32] pentecostal revival and
[46:36] in 1963 came which was seven
[46:39] years after 1956 which was a
[46:42] mono jubilee we talked about the major
[46:44] jubilee and we talked about the mono
[46:46] jubilee
[46:48] and then after 1963 when the seals were
[46:51] open
[46:52] i wish of course there was another call
[46:56] to the church this time the first 1956
[47:00] was a call to the nation 1963 was a call
[47:03] to the church
[47:05] and then so after that every seven years
[47:09] 1970 pentecostal went straight into
[47:13] organization
[47:14] they separated into united pentecosta
[47:18] and assembling assembly of god
[47:21] and united pentecostal they were all
[47:23] from the azusa street revival they were
[47:26] all part of the
[47:27] pentecostal church 1970 seven
[47:30] seven years after 1963 they separated
[47:34] they went
[47:35] into organization taking united
[47:38] pentecostal
[47:39] an organization named assembly of god
[47:41] another organization named
[47:44] 1977 brought us
[47:47] a brother brandon prediction that has
[47:49] created a contradiction and people
[47:51] had different thinking about it and we
[47:54] will talk about it just like i said
[47:56] but then every other seven years
[48:00] we've been seeing major changes in the
[48:02] world
[48:04] major changes in the word but this is
[48:07] what
[48:07] caught my mind last night that i want to
[48:11] share with you before we call
[48:13] a brother lloyd up
[48:14] [Music]
[48:17] just like revelation 3 20 says behold i
[48:21] stand at the door and knock
[48:22] and the reason why i'm saying this i'm
[48:24] saying it to us
[48:26] i'm saying it to us the young people
[48:28] young people
[48:29] i'm i'm calling your attention to this
[48:34] trying to lay the foundation so
[48:37] uh but lloyd can bring his testimony but
[48:42] listen to this
[48:48] israel in their joining
[48:51] from egypt
[48:55] after they cross the red sea
[48:59] they are joining to the promised land
[49:04] we are the generation every one of us
[49:07] here in this building we are the
[49:10] generation
[49:11] that was born in the wilderness
[49:16] very very few of us are brusqued our
[49:19] brother john baby
[49:20] were born during the time the prophet
[49:22] was here but they were not in brother
[49:24] branham's meeting
[49:26] the prophet has left
[49:30] so we we are the generation that was
[49:33] born in the wilderness
[49:36] and what we have experienced
[49:39] there have been doctrines that have rise
[49:43] fanaticism that has followed this
[49:44] message all the same thing that happened
[49:48] to
[49:48] israel in the wilderness has been around
[49:51] this message
[49:55] now a journey that you have taken them
[49:58] [Music]
[50:01] four days brother branham said in some
[50:03] places took them 40 years
[50:10] 10 years to a day of rejection
[50:14] and what i want to say to you young
[50:16] people sometimes
[50:18] with our educational level and our
[50:21] exposure
[50:22] to internet we think we are smart
[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] but a little sense of rejection when god
[50:31] is dealing with you
[50:33] could take you through a wilderness
[50:36] journey
[50:37] [Music]
[50:39] it could have you dealing with something
[50:42] for many years
[50:47] a little sense of rejection
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] we're not this is not plain church we
[50:54] all know with everything that we have
[50:56] heard
[50:56] and everything that has been preached
[50:57] you don't need a preacher like i've
[50:59] always said you don't need a new message
[51:04] what we need is the effect of the word
[51:07] in our life
[51:08] what we need is the word being made
[51:11] [Music]
[51:20] flesh
[51:22] if god made a promise brother branham
[51:23] says repent
[51:25] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[51:27] jesus christ and
[51:28] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[51:31] ghost
[51:32] if we if we did that the holy ghost is
[51:35] ours
[51:36] so just like israel should have taken
[51:39] four days to
[51:40] uh to the promised land we have just
[51:43] these three stages repent
[51:44] be baptized and you step right into the
[51:48] promise
[51:53] if we are not enjoying
[51:55] [Music]
[51:58] the fruit of the land

[1:04:50] you know i'm kind of tired oh that's
[1:04:52] right i gotta do this afterwards no but
[1:04:54] let us actually
[1:04:55] take that enter into a spirit because
[1:04:58] you know there's a point
[1:04:59] there's a point where we can get to
[1:05:01] where time stands still
[1:05:03] where you look up at the clock and you
[1:05:04] think where have i
[1:05:06] been i can't i don't even know where
[1:05:09] i've been
[1:05:09] i i can't even what just happened
[1:05:13] and that is the point that we need to
[1:05:15] reach to this morning that it's no
[1:05:16] longer just
[1:05:17] coming not just not just listening to
[1:05:20] the word but we're participating
[1:05:22] we're engaged with the word of god that
[1:05:24] we might enter into his spirit
[1:05:26] enter into his courts with thanksgiving
[1:05:28] into his gates with praise that we might
[1:05:30] truly
[1:05:31] not just in a sensation or emotion but
[1:05:34] truly
[1:05:35] press press into the spirit
[1:05:38] into the kingdom of almighty god this
[1:05:40] morning
[1:05:41] that we wouldn't just stop that we
[1:05:43] wouldn't just stop at this
[1:05:45] not just this this is just the foyer of
[1:05:49] heaven this is just the entryway of
[1:05:51] heaven

[1:06:07] on singing
[1:06:08] praise the lord got to cut me off i
[1:06:10] transition into the word
[1:06:12] of god this morning i'm excited excited
[1:06:15] you can be seated just for a second
[1:06:18] just for a second you know what's funny
[1:06:20] in baseball games they always do like
[1:06:21] the wave and all this stuff right
[1:06:23] it's funny and and i think that we have
[1:06:25] too much in church
[1:06:26] of this it's funny because it really
[1:06:29] doesn't come
[1:06:30] from the gospel it comes from the world
[1:06:32] this idea of
[1:06:35] now you have the the music and now you
[1:06:38] just all sit
[1:06:39] you just listen it's an old old you know
[1:06:42] teaching like style of communication i
[1:06:46] don't even really like having a pulpit
[1:06:47] up here i'd rather be out there
[1:06:49] because if you look at it in the bible
[1:06:52] i'm gonna come breathe on all you guys
[1:06:53] um if you look at it in the bible when
[1:06:57] jesus they talk about this he was in
[1:06:59] solomon's court
[1:07:01] he talked with the people he wasn't back
[1:07:03] here
[1:07:05] he wasn't way back he wasn't in this
[1:07:07] loft position
[1:07:09] untouchable to the people he was always
[1:07:12] there
[1:07:12] with them he was among them yes they
[1:07:14] were on the mountain yes sometimes they
[1:07:16] stepped up under the boat
[1:07:17] so that everyone could see him so that
[1:07:20] they could
[1:07:21] see him they could hear him they could
[1:07:23] touch him it wasn't meant to be a
[1:07:25] separation
[1:07:26] it wasn't meant to be a divider it was
[1:07:28] it was so that
[1:07:29] he came and spoke the language of the
[1:07:32] people
[1:07:32] in that day right where they were we
[1:07:36] look at the king james version bible now
[1:07:38] we think
[1:07:38] oh no no our approach to god is oh so
[1:07:41] like
[1:07:42] it has to be this way it's so like
[1:07:44] precise and so
[1:07:46] so measured out and so formal
[1:07:49] and that's not the way to god now there
[1:07:52] is a reverence that is you need that
[1:07:54] reverence that is true
[1:07:55] but god god designed it in such a way
[1:07:58] that us
[1:07:58] in our day-to-day normal
[1:08:02] communications we could talk to him
[1:08:05] he could he could be touched we think
[1:08:07] once again that word he could be touched
[1:08:09] by the feelings of our infirmities we
[1:08:11] take that
[1:08:11] and we make that complicated that's not
[1:08:14] he can be touched by the feelings of our
[1:08:15] infirmities
[1:08:17] he empathizes he cares
[1:08:21] he can be he feels what that's what that
[1:08:24] says he feels what you're going through
[1:08:27] no matter what that
[1:08:29] is he feels it
[1:08:32] we can cry out to god and not have to
[1:08:35] worry about him misunderstanding what
[1:08:37] we're talking about
[1:08:38] he knows the depths of our heart he
[1:08:42] knows before the foundation before we
[1:08:44] were even a twinkle
[1:08:45] in our great grandparents you know
[1:08:48] genome like
[1:08:49] he knows he knows exactly
[1:08:52] why things have happened the way they've
[1:08:54] happened he knows
[1:08:56] why he knows why we don't know why
[1:08:59] we don't know why and we can look
[1:09:01] through our story and see where we've
[1:09:03] messed up or we've made mistakes
[1:09:05] and it's very easy for us to beat
[1:09:06] ourselves up about these things
[1:09:08] we beat ourselves up and we think oh i'm
[1:09:11] just a no good person i'm just
[1:09:12] i'm this or that and you're absolutely
[1:09:15] right
[1:09:16] you're absolutely right you're
[1:09:19] absolutely right
[1:09:20] and satan will always come to us in our
[1:09:22] worst moments and remind us of those
[1:09:24] things and tell us that god doesn't love
[1:09:26] us
[1:09:27] tell us that god doesn't love us because
[1:09:29] you did this or you did that
[1:09:31] god doesn't love you
[1:09:34] but thank god for the blood we are here
[1:09:37] under the umbrella of the grace of god
[1:09:40] nothing that we've done nothing that we
[1:09:42] could ever do we come
[1:09:43] simply before the throne of grace and we
[1:09:45] boldly ask for mercy
[1:09:47] god i've done these things i'm the worst
[1:09:50] person
[1:09:51] ever i'm the worst ever
[1:09:55] but god i come not because i think i can
[1:09:58] i come because you said i could
[1:10:01] you said i could and that's what i'm
[1:10:03] standing on today
[1:10:04] and every day god i messed up again i
[1:10:08] messed up again
[1:10:09] today but thank god your mercies are new
[1:10:12] every morning
[1:10:13] your mercies are new i can put my faith
[1:10:16] and my trust in that that you the one
[1:10:20] who is called he's predestined
[1:10:22] he is the one who started the work in me
[1:10:25] and he will draw me into the end
[1:10:27] it's the same god it's the same god
[1:10:32] we're not worshiping a god of the bygone
[1:10:35] we're not worshiping a god of the
[1:10:36] has-been
[1:10:37] we're not worshiping some way
[1:10:39] off-distant future event
[1:10:41] or something that was way off in the
[1:10:43] past we are worshiping a god
[1:10:45] of today and today is the only day that
[1:10:48] it
[1:10:48] exists it's the only day that exists we
[1:10:51] like to build
[1:10:52] calendars and project plans and goals
[1:10:54] and we look at the passing of the
[1:10:56] calendar and we think
[1:10:58] oh you know next year i'm going to do
[1:10:59] this or that or whatever but to god
[1:11:01] it's an unbounded now it's an
[1:11:04] unbounded now and it is
[1:11:08] what we do in the day
[1:11:11] today look up your redemption draws nigh
[1:11:15] today it's always today and you look at
[1:11:18] it
[1:11:18] the content i'm getting ahead of myself
[1:11:20] but the unjust judge jesus told us
[1:11:23] a parable the kingdom of heaven is
[1:11:26] likened to
[1:11:27] a woman and an unjust judge and
[1:11:30] the woman said come solve my problem
[1:11:34] effectively solve my problem
[1:11:37] and he talked about that the unjust
[1:11:40] judge
[1:11:41] even him being an unjust judge due to
[1:11:43] her persistence
[1:11:45] to her persistence will he not come
[1:11:48] an adventure and how much more your
[1:11:51] heavenly father
[1:11:53] and it's the same thing for us don't get
[1:11:56] tired
[1:11:57] of asking don't get tired
[1:12:00] of asking the finishing of that story is
[1:12:04] when he comes when god comes to the door
[1:12:07] to answer your problem will he find
[1:12:10] faith
[1:12:11] will you still be knocking and so before

[1:12:24] there are things we may have waited
[1:12:26] years for
[1:12:28] years and years and years and years
[1:12:32] and in those seasons in those times of
[1:12:34] waiting
[1:12:35] when satan comes in and tries to build a
[1:12:39] case against
[1:12:40] god a case against god if god
[1:12:43] was a loving god why would he do this
[1:12:47] why would he do that once again just
[1:12:49] like job he would build this case
[1:12:53] and that god he's never going to answer
[1:12:55] you he's never going to answer you
[1:12:58] and if we listen to satan and that time

[1:16:01] i'll keep reading and then i wanted to
[1:16:03] come back to something in this passage
[1:16:05] so and they took um you can go ahead and
[1:16:07] be seated we're good thank you
[1:16:09] appreciate that it's always weird
[1:16:11] switching bibles because you're like oh
[1:16:12] man all my spots where it would flip
[1:16:14] open and things
[1:16:15] it's just not there so um and malon and
[1:16:18] chilean died so and they
[1:16:20] took them wives of the women of moab and
[1:16:22] the name of the one was orpah
[1:16:24] and the name of the other ruth and they
[1:16:25] dwelled there about 10 years
[1:16:27] and malone and chilean died also both of
[1:16:29] them and the woman was left
[1:16:31] of her two sons and her husband and this
[1:16:33] is a very familiar
[1:16:34] you know like we make kids stories about
[1:16:36] this like this is a very very familiar
[1:16:38] passage but
[1:16:40] i want you to and i say this all the
[1:16:42] time but is
[1:16:43] pretend you've never heard this story
[1:16:45] before because there's something about
[1:16:47] like when we're reading the bible if
[1:16:49] we're not careful especially for the
[1:16:50] story that we've heard
[1:16:52] we start to filter it out it's like
[1:16:54] reading a dictionary or something we
[1:16:56] just start to like oh yep
[1:16:57] and they were there and melon and
[1:16:59] chilean died and we know you know
[1:17:00] because mo
[1:17:01] they went into moab and they were
[1:17:02] supposed to stay in israel and we start
[1:17:04] to filter these things
[1:17:05] and depending on how long you've been
[1:17:08] around if you've heard it more and more
[1:17:10] it's it's so easy to just start
[1:17:12] filtering it out but i want us to pay
[1:17:13] attention
[1:17:14] today god you're here no matter what i'm
[1:17:18] talking about
[1:17:19] you in your heart god i'm here
[1:17:23] speak to me speak to me pull him off his
[1:17:25] notes
[1:17:26] talk to me i got needs god today i need
[1:17:29] to hear from you
[1:17:31] and you make that purpose in your heart
[1:17:33] and you will
[1:17:34] absolutely be on a shadow of a doubt
[1:17:37] here from god
[1:17:38] absolutely i have had a succession of
[1:17:41] weeks now the last
[1:17:42] probably six weeks in a row every time
[1:17:44] i've gone to service
[1:17:46] every single time i've gone into service
[1:17:49] and i i had something i was praying to
[1:17:52] god about
[1:17:53] and every single time exactly what was
[1:17:56] happening was preached
[1:17:58] about exactly precisely even down to the
[1:18:01] same exact
[1:18:02] words i had prayed came across the
[1:18:05] pulpit
[1:18:06] and so we have to come to god believing
[1:18:10] he is here we're not come we have not
[1:18:13] come to be entertained
[1:18:14] we have not come just for the excitement
[1:18:17] we're not we
[1:18:18] haven't been come even to be taught in a
[1:18:21] sense
[1:18:22] though those things are great we have
[1:18:24] come to experience god
[1:18:27] experience god and that's what we need
[1:18:30] we need to experience god
[1:18:34] they took of them wives the woman of
[1:18:36] moab we're just going to kind of skim
[1:18:38] through this
[1:18:38] and they dwelled there about 10 years 10
[1:18:41] years i saw this today
[1:18:42] that's a long time if you listen to
[1:18:44] adventures in odyssey or many of these
[1:18:46] kids stories it's like they moved to
[1:18:48] moab got married and immediately died
[1:18:50] you know it's like no no no it's 10
[1:18:53] years that's a long time think of where
[1:18:55] you were 10 years ago
[1:18:57] think about where you are today 10 years
[1:19:01] then she arose speaking of naomi with
[1:19:03] her daughters in law that she might
[1:19:04] return from the country of moab
[1:19:06] for she had heard in the country of moab
[1:19:09] how that the lord had visited his people
[1:19:11] in giving them bread wherefore she went
[1:19:14] forth
[1:19:14] out of the place where she was and her
[1:19:16] two daughters-in-law with her
[1:19:18] and they went on the way to return unto
[1:19:21] the land
[1:19:22] of judah and naomi said unto her two
[1:19:24] daughters-in-law
[1:19:25] go return each other to her mother's
[1:19:28] house
[1:19:28] the lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[1:19:31] dealt with the dead
[1:19:32] and with me remember 10 years that's a
[1:19:35] long time
[1:19:36] 10 years and the lord grant you that he
[1:19:40] that ye may find rest each of you in the
[1:19:43] house
[1:19:44] of her husband so she's telling them go
[1:19:46] find go back to your families find a new
[1:19:48] husband
[1:19:49] leave me
[1:19:52] the lord grant you that you may find
[1:19:53] rest each of you in the house of her
[1:19:54] husband and then she kissed them and
[1:19:56] they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:20:01] and they said unto her surely
[1:20:04] we will return with thee unto thy people
[1:20:07] and naomi said turn again my daughters
[1:20:10] why will you go with me
[1:20:11] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[1:20:13] that they may be your husbands
[1:20:15] once again we know the story turn again
[1:20:17] my daughters go your way for i am too
[1:20:19] old to have
[1:20:20] a husband if i should say i have hope if
[1:20:22] i should have a husband also tonight it
[1:20:24] should bear sons
[1:20:25] would you tarry for them till they were
[1:20:28] grown
[1:20:28] would you stay for them from having
[1:20:30] husbands name i daughters for grieveth
[1:20:33] me much for your
[1:20:34] sakes that the hand of the lord has gone
[1:20:36] out against me
[1:20:38] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:20:40] again
[1:20:42] and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but
[1:20:45] ruth
[1:20:45] clave unto her and i want to preach
[1:20:48] today
[1:20:50] if i would give it a title the church of
[1:20:52] the almost
[1:20:54] the church of the almost you look at
[1:20:58] orpah
[1:20:59] here and this is just fascinating i just
[1:21:00] was really thinking about orpah
[1:21:03] we putting myself into those shoes
[1:21:06] 10 years think about that
[1:21:10] think of the relationships of 10 years
[1:21:14] spending time with naomi spending time
[1:21:17] seeing that life seeing seeing the
[1:21:20] she had the same experience as ruth
[1:21:23] you look at that married into the family
[1:21:26] husband dies love naomi you even look at
[1:21:29] it right here
[1:21:31] they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:21:34] they all did orpah and ruth
[1:21:38] orpah and ruth and yet orpah
[1:21:42] kissed her mother-in-law goodbye
[1:21:46] and walked away and ruth clave unto her
[1:21:53] judges 1. it came to pass when israel
[1:21:57] was strong
[1:21:58] that they put the canaan knights to
[1:22:00] tribute and did not utterly drive them
[1:22:02] out
[1:22:03] neither did ephraim drive out the
[1:22:05] canaanites that dwelt in geezer
[1:22:07] but the canaanites dwelt and geezer
[1:22:08] among them neither did zebulon drive out
[1:22:11] the inhabitants of kitran
[1:22:13] nor the inhabitants of nahal gonna mess
[1:22:15] up these names but the canaanites dwelt
[1:22:17] among them and became tributaries
[1:22:19] can go on neither did asher drive out
[1:22:22] neither did naftali drive out they were
[1:22:25] in the land
[1:22:26] and they almost had possession of the
[1:22:30] land
[1:22:31] almost almost
[1:22:35] acts 26 27 king agrippa
[1:22:39] believe this is paul he was brought
[1:22:41] before the judges and there was king of
[1:22:42] grip and we're not we have a lot to
[1:22:43] cover so we're only just hitting some
[1:22:44] highlights to lay some foundation
[1:22:47] king agrippa believeth thou the prophets
[1:22:49] i know
[1:22:50] that thou believers this is paul talking
[1:22:52] he's been brought before this judgment
[1:22:54] seat
[1:22:54] then agrippa said unto paul almost
[1:22:58] thou persuades me to be a christian
[1:23:02] almost there's a cycle
[1:23:06] of bondage and we see this throughout
[1:23:08] the scripture
[1:23:09] there's a cycle of bondage
[1:23:14] people turn to god so right they're
[1:23:16] following god
[1:23:18] a people turn to god
[1:23:22] they get success
[1:23:26] they get wins and in that
[1:23:29] winning they build up their
[1:23:31] fortifications they have a position of
[1:23:33] strength
[1:23:34] they have a position they have position
[1:23:36] they own
[1:23:37] things now they own things and
[1:23:40] in that fortification bible talks about
[1:23:43] a rich man's wealth is his strength is
[1:23:47] his strong
[1:23:48] tower and it also says it's hard
[1:23:51] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[1:23:53] of heaven in that
[1:23:55] strength in that fortification they
[1:23:57] relax
[1:23:59] they relax that let my heart take its
[1:24:02] ease and they turn to other gods
[1:24:05] you can see this all throughout the book
[1:24:07] of judges
[1:24:08] they turn to other gods they turn to
[1:24:11] frolic they turn to play
[1:24:13] they no longer they left if you look at
[1:24:16] the commandment
[1:24:17] that mo god gave through moses to the
[1:24:19] children of israel before they went
[1:24:21] into the land of canaan to possess it
[1:24:24] was
[1:24:24] he specifically told them do not take
[1:24:27] them as tributaries
[1:24:29] do not make alliances with them said if
[1:24:32] you
[1:24:32] don't drive them out they will be pricks
[1:24:35] in your side and thorns in your
[1:24:37] eyes pricks in your side and yet you can
[1:24:41] go down the list
[1:24:42] and they never took full possession they
[1:24:45] never
[1:24:46] israel never took full possession they
[1:24:49] were always
[1:24:50] almost in full possession and you can
[1:24:53] see that
[1:24:54] exactly happened they got lazy they they
[1:24:58] stopped they stopped they set up their
[1:25:01] walls
[1:25:02] we're good we got walls we're strong we
[1:25:04] have an
[1:25:05] army look i mean look we've pushed
[1:25:07] basically everyone out
[1:25:09] basically everyone out
[1:25:13] they turn to other gods and of course we
[1:25:14] can talk about balaam and astroth in
[1:25:16] these different ones and i've preached
[1:25:17] on it here before but if you look at
[1:25:19] baal baal is
[1:25:20] very much definitely a god of success
[1:25:23] it is the golden calf we still see it
[1:25:25] represented today in wall street it is
[1:25:27] the idea
[1:25:28] the scripture says that where the ox
[1:25:31] is or where there is no ox the crib is
[1:25:34] clean you don't have to feed the ox
[1:25:35] but with the ox comes much increase
[1:25:38] this idea of increase in success
[1:25:42] they turn to other gods
[1:25:45] which leads to bondage because they no
[1:25:48] longer are pushing
[1:25:49] outward they're no longer
[1:25:52] they're no longer taking possession
[1:25:55] they're resting
[1:25:56] they content they go to sleep
[1:26:00] which eventually leads them to bondage
[1:26:02] it eventually and you can see this once
[1:26:04] again all throughout the book of judges
[1:26:06] where they they would do this and then
[1:26:10] here comes in an enemy and of course we
[1:26:11] know that that's the grace of god god
[1:26:13] allowed it to happen
[1:26:15] to bring them back to an awareness they
[1:26:17] would come into bondage
[1:26:19] and then they would cry again out to god
[1:26:21] they would cry again out to god they
[1:26:23] would seek
[1:26:24] the hand of god and then god would raise
[1:26:26] up a deliverer
[1:26:28] and the heart of the people would be
[1:26:29] steadfast while that deliverer
[1:26:31] lived it would be steadfast
[1:26:35] and then once the deliverer died they
[1:26:37] went right back
[1:26:38] to the same ways over and over
[1:26:42] a cycle a cycle
[1:26:45] of almost succeeding a cycle of
[1:26:48] almost entering in
[1:26:53] hebrews 10 35
[1:26:58] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:27:00] which hath great recompense of reward
[1:27:03] for ye have need of patience that after
[1:27:05] you have done the will of god
[1:27:07] you might receive the promise for yet a
[1:27:09] little while
[1:27:10] and he that shall come will come and
[1:27:12] will not tarry
[1:27:13] now the just shall live by faith and we
[1:27:15] know that part stop
[1:27:16] right so the whole lutheran doctrine is
[1:27:19] built around
[1:27:20] now the just shall live by faith but
[1:27:24] but this is the next part it's literally
[1:27:26] half a sentence
[1:27:27] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[1:27:31] have no pleasure in him
[1:27:33] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:27:34] unto perdition but of them
[1:27:36] that believe to the saving of the soul
[1:27:39] and we're going to go through some
[1:27:40] different instances of this and there's
[1:27:42] this continual pattern
[1:27:44] of those that come to a
[1:27:47] threshold they come to a threshold
[1:27:51] let's go ahead and throw up um the
[1:27:54] three rings and we'll we'll go between
[1:27:56] the three rings and the
[1:27:59] um and the assembly there if we can
[1:28:03] throw that up they come to a threshold
[1:28:04] while they're getting that up the rich
[1:28:06] young ruler
[1:28:07] sought the lord from his youth
[1:28:10] he sought the lord from his youth and he
[1:28:13] came to
[1:28:14] a threshold he came to jesus
[1:28:18] he came right up to the king of kings
[1:28:19] himself and he couldn't cross
[1:28:22] that threshold he turned back
[1:28:25] he drew back so just to
[1:28:28] review just a little bit and we've
[1:28:29] talked about this a few times
[1:28:32] we are made up of effectively
[1:28:37] three sections of our being in a sense
[1:28:41] here's our body
[1:28:42] we've got five senses that can
[1:28:44] communicate with our body we've got feel
[1:28:46] taste here smell c
[1:28:48] if anyone has any extra ones let me know
[1:28:50] about that because i'd really like to
[1:28:52] know
[1:28:52] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[1:28:54] uh how does this work
[1:28:56] there we go yeah if you've got any extra
[1:28:58] ones that that would be fantastic
[1:29:00] um then we've got the spirit so this is
[1:29:04] in your inner being this is this is
[1:29:07] the operator in a sense of this is your
[1:29:10] spirit
[1:29:11] your reasoning your conscience your
[1:29:13] imagination affection and memory
[1:29:14] and we're not going to take too much
[1:29:15] time on this other than to say that
[1:29:18] reasoning tends to lean towards logic
[1:29:21] affection
[1:29:22] emotion conscience is more of your
[1:29:24] innate sense of right and wrong
[1:29:26] which can be good or bad depending on
[1:29:29] what your upbringing and your nature
[1:29:31] nurture has been if you want to throw
[1:29:32] some terms out
[1:29:33] your conscience can be seared and
[1:29:35] mislead you
[1:29:36] absolutely absolutely can mislead you
[1:29:40] and yet this is a door god often uses to
[1:29:43] communicate with us
[1:29:45] imagination once again can be positive
[1:29:47] or negative
[1:29:48] the the ability to foresee or to look
[1:29:51] ahead into the future
[1:29:52] none of these are innately positive or
[1:29:55] negative
[1:29:57] they are gates into your spirit
[1:30:01] and they can be used for good or bad
[1:30:03] memory we think of this one oftentimes
[1:30:05] as being kind of bad it's like oh i
[1:30:06] remember all the bad stuff i've done
[1:30:09] right you know or oh yeah yikes or even
[1:30:11] imagination
[1:30:12] uh the stuff i'm gonna do you know like
[1:30:14] we can start to think about this stuff
[1:30:16] and we can we can paint them as very
[1:30:18] negative but they
[1:30:20] are they just simply are they are
[1:30:24] and both satan and god can operate
[1:30:26] within these realms
[1:30:28] and what really matters at the end of
[1:30:30] the day is what is in here in the soul
[1:30:32] who your inner being you're at this
[1:30:36] is who you actually are there are plenty
[1:30:39] of people in the world that have all of
[1:30:41] this
[1:30:41] all good to go all of this is good to go
[1:30:44] they're super people
[1:30:46] they are literally super people and yet
[1:30:49] right in here
[1:30:49] they are totally messed up they're told
[1:30:52] everything is done for
[1:30:53] is as a projection outward it's a
[1:30:56] projection so that other people can
[1:30:58] see them so that they can see themselves
[1:31:01] look at how great a person
[1:31:02] i am but yet they know and this is the
[1:31:05] thing with this
[1:31:06] you know you will never ever
[1:31:10] ever be able to talk yourself out of
[1:31:12] this
[1:31:13] no matter how much this is mastered no
[1:31:16] matter how much you can convince
[1:31:18] everyone else no matter how many people
[1:31:20] you surround yourself with that tell you
[1:31:22] you are a great person surely
[1:31:27] surely you won't die surely you won't
[1:31:31] surely the lord has blessed you
[1:31:35] you know you know
[1:31:39] you cannot get away from it you know
[1:31:42] and the inverse is also true there are
[1:31:44] people who
[1:31:45] legitimately believe
[1:31:48] and they know and they are led by the
[1:31:51] spirit of god
[1:31:52] from the soul and this part of their
[1:31:55] being is completely messed up
[1:31:58] completely messed up like the seed going
[1:32:01] into
[1:32:02] good ground you know good ground doesn't
[1:32:04] always look so good
[1:32:07] it's full of manure and fertilizer and
[1:32:09] garbage and just like all kinds of stuff
[1:32:12] is in that ground it's been sitting
[1:32:14] there gestating
[1:32:15] fertilizing rotting just a rotten mess
[1:32:18] but in that rotten mess there's a seed
[1:32:21] there's a seed of faith right there
[1:32:23] it's just waiting for god to strike it
[1:32:25] waiting for the sun and the rain
[1:32:27] it's crying out to god god help me
[1:32:31] help me i can't help myself i can't
[1:32:34] change my reasoning my imagination my
[1:32:36] affection my memory
[1:32:37] i can't change what i feel when i taste
[1:32:39] what i hear but god
[1:32:41] help me come down and save me
[1:32:45] save me pull me out of this miry clay
[1:32:48] lord
[1:32:50] i'm here god you know lord
[1:32:56] they're right there and they just keep
[1:32:59] on believing
[1:33:00] they just it might not look like it on
[1:33:02] the outside
[1:33:03] it might not look so good out here we
[1:33:06] might not even like them sometimes in
[1:33:08] church but they just keep on showing up
[1:33:11] they just keep on showing up they're
[1:33:14] looking for a redeemer they're looking
[1:33:16] for someone to come
[1:33:18] quicken this to me god i don't know
[1:33:21] what's real my consciences are all
[1:33:23] messed up my reasoning's messed up
[1:33:25] my memory afflicts me all of this
[1:33:28] afflicts me but there must be
[1:33:30] something real there must be someone
[1:33:34] there must be an answer to all of this
[1:33:38] there must be an answer to all of this
[1:33:42] in the soul in the soul
[1:33:49] let's go to the next slide to the inner
[1:33:52] and outer court
[1:34:00] so here's the this is the tabernacle
[1:34:03] that
[1:34:03] god gave the pattern to moses
[1:34:06] and this is if we zoomed further out
[1:34:09] which we're not going to it's not in the
[1:34:10] image but
[1:34:11] you would have all the 12 tribes around
[1:34:14] camped around
[1:34:15] this and then this is the the tabernacle
[1:34:17] in the wilderness you'd have this fence
[1:34:19] here and then the pillar of fire would
[1:34:21] descend upon this in the bible
[1:34:24] and this was the first dwelling of god
[1:34:27] in a sense now we know he appeared on
[1:34:29] mount sinai
[1:34:31] and we you can't contain him god fills
[1:34:34] all space
[1:34:35] time matter everything he can't be
[1:34:37] contained but he set
[1:34:39] a pattern back in the old testament
[1:34:43] of the house that i will dwell in
[1:34:46] and you can look at this there's three
[1:34:48] stages
[1:34:49] there's the outer courtyard right here
[1:34:52] where you've got
[1:34:52] the altar for the burnt offerings you've
[1:34:54] got the brazen laver
[1:34:56] go inside you got the table of showbread
[1:34:58] the menorah altar of incense with the
[1:35:00] menorah is the
[1:35:01] golden candlestick and then of course
[1:35:04] we've got the ark of the covenant which
[1:35:05] they put aaron's rod in there
[1:35:07] they also put the uh manna
[1:35:10] a sample of manna from the wilderness
[1:35:12] and then the tables of stone were in
[1:35:13] there
[1:35:15] and you look at this and the the
[1:35:17] procession
[1:35:19] to come into the holiest of holies
[1:35:22] they had to pass all of these stages the
[1:35:25] priests had to come
[1:35:26] the priest had to be ready he had to
[1:35:28] follow in the way that god ordained
[1:35:31] to come in to make the sacrifice
[1:35:34] to something had to die
[1:35:37] before you could even come in here
[1:35:39] something had to die
[1:35:41] then they would breach reach the brazen
[1:35:43] labor
[1:35:44] where they would walk they would wash
[1:35:46] they would cleanse themselves of any of
[1:35:47] the dust or any of the issues from out
[1:35:49] here
[1:35:50] and they would come in and then they
[1:35:52] would go into the holy place we're not
[1:35:53] going to go into too much detail on like
[1:35:55] what they did in there i'm just giving
[1:35:56] you some highlights
[1:35:58] so you would enter in of course in here
[1:36:00] we've got the table of showbread and the
[1:36:01] menorah
[1:36:02] and the altar of incense
[1:36:06] we come to a door to a threshold
[1:36:13] and many people they come from here
[1:36:16] we'll call this out here it's the
[1:36:18] the outer outer it's the real like this
[1:36:20] is the mass
[1:36:22] of the world in sem in a sense you're a
[1:36:24] part of the assembly
[1:36:26] you're not really in anything you're
[1:36:27] just a part of the assembly
[1:36:29] you get into here you're in the outer
[1:36:31] courtyard you're in
[1:36:33] you you have reached a point of
[1:36:36] communion with god of connection with
[1:36:39] god
[1:36:39] you've made a sacrifice you've you've
[1:36:42] been washed
[1:36:44] you've been washed out here though
[1:36:48] you're still influenced by the sun and
[1:36:50] the rain
[1:36:52] whatever whatever weather whatever
[1:36:54] atmosphere whatever
[1:36:55] mood i'm really hungry while i'm out
[1:36:58] here
[1:36:59] right i'm hungry then i go into the holy
[1:37:02] place
[1:37:04] and in here we've got the table of
[1:37:06] showbread i'm not hungry anymore there's
[1:37:08] light even if it's raining outside
[1:37:11] i'm pretty good this i could stay in
[1:37:12] here a long long time
[1:37:15] it smells great alternate there's not no
[1:37:17] stink from this altar down out here
[1:37:20] no sting from the congregation coming in
[1:37:23] i'm alone with god
[1:37:25] i'm alone with god right here
[1:37:35] and we stop right
[1:37:38] here go back to the other slide
[1:37:42] again it's symbolic it's a pattern
[1:37:46] the same outer court got that inner
[1:37:49] court
[1:37:50] and the holiest of holies and many
[1:37:53] people
[1:37:54] they start here yeah i made a sacrifice
[1:37:57] look i'm washed you know i look pretty
[1:37:59] good
[1:38:00] on the outside right everything that
[1:38:02] people can see
[1:38:04] pretty good then some people they even
[1:38:07] go a little higher
[1:38:10] and they actually do get this
[1:38:12] straightened out their conscience their
[1:38:14] reasoning memory affection it's good to
[1:38:16] go
[1:38:18] and they stop they stop it's pretty good
[1:38:21] in here
[1:38:22] things there's not a lot bothering me
[1:38:24] anymore my past doesn't really bother me
[1:38:26] anymore
[1:38:27] i'm not worried about the future anymore
[1:38:30] my conscience
[1:38:30] i know right from wrong i'm i'm a man of
[1:38:32] the community
[1:38:34] i'm a man i'm respected in this
[1:38:37] community
[1:38:38] i'm able i'm people come to me
[1:38:41] for counsel for counsel
[1:38:44] my affections are my emotions are in
[1:38:47] line
[1:38:47] i've got them all straightened out i
[1:38:49] don't fly off the handle anymore
[1:38:52] i don't have these just random impulses
[1:38:54] that are just like
[1:38:55] really i'm good i
[1:38:58] am good
[1:39:02] the problem so you go back to the other
[1:39:03] slide again
[1:39:06] within here everything in here
[1:39:09] is finite everything in here
[1:39:13] and they're direct we're not going to go
[1:39:15] through them but there are direct
[1:39:16] instructions for how to maintain all of
[1:39:18] these
[1:39:19] you got to make sure that the oil keeps
[1:39:20] on you know coming in here you got to
[1:39:22] keep on checking make sure that light
[1:39:23] keeps on going got you know this is
[1:39:25] restored
[1:39:26] the bread here is restored it's not if
[1:39:28] they're eating it it doesn't just
[1:39:30] magically reappear
[1:39:31] i should miraculously excuse me altar of
[1:39:34] incense even
[1:39:35] it's a part of their duty to care for
[1:39:37] these things
[1:39:38] to constantly maintain and it's the same
[1:39:41] thing with our spirit
[1:39:43] we're called to maintain to continuously
[1:39:46] maintain
[1:39:47] to wash ourselves to cleanse ourselves
[1:39:50] from the things of the world
[1:39:51] out here and then to enter in and and
[1:39:55] have this maintenance
[1:39:56] of our spirit we're not flying off the
[1:39:58] handle we're not doing these things
[1:40:01] and this makes a really good
[1:40:05] christian a really good christian
[1:40:08] someone who is admired and i know i'm
[1:40:11] repeating myself here but i think it's
[1:40:13] worth emphasizing
[1:40:16] many people never never
[1:40:20] go here they're almost
[1:40:24] there they're literally it's a
[1:40:27] thin curtain it's a thin
[1:40:30] curt it's one strides distance
[1:40:34] away and yet they're satisfied
[1:40:37] to stay right here
[1:40:40] satisfied stay right here let's go ahead
[1:40:44] and throw up
[1:40:44] um i think i sent you that picture of
[1:40:46] that olympian running let's go ahead and
[1:40:47] throw that up there
[1:40:48] i know i had that video too we're going
[1:40:50] to skip the video for now thank you for
[1:40:51] looking for it though i appreciate it
[1:40:54] there's a um this article if we can go
[1:40:56] ahead and throw this
[1:40:57] up here i thought this was really
[1:41:00] amazing
[1:41:02] we often talk about and this is funny we
[1:41:04] admire the people
[1:41:06] who win by an inch right
[1:41:09] they just run into running and running
[1:41:11] they win by an inch
[1:41:13] this is exactly the opposite he lost
[1:41:17] by an inch by a fraction of a second
[1:41:22] a 19 year old olympic runner's premature
[1:41:25] celebration at the finish line ends
[1:41:28] in defeat an olympic
[1:41:32] an olympian was reminded mere steps and
[1:41:34] you can see this article if you want
[1:41:36] mere steps from the finish line of a new
[1:41:37] year's eve race that when it comes to
[1:41:39] running
[1:41:40] it's best to hold off on celebrations
[1:41:44] jacob kiplimo a teenager who represented
[1:41:47] uganda in 2016
[1:41:48] olympics was about to win the 95
[1:41:52] 95th san silvestre de sao paulo road
[1:41:55] race wow that's hard to say
[1:41:57] with a record-setting pace tuesday in
[1:41:59] brazil when he raised his
[1:42:01] arms as he neared the finish
[1:42:04] but he failed to hear the footsteps
[1:42:07] of kenya's kibiwatt kandi who
[1:42:10] zoomed past him with a last-second burst
[1:42:14] winning by a half stride
[1:42:18] connie became the first to win the 15k
[1:42:20] event in under 43 minutes finishing
[1:42:23] in 42.59
[1:42:26] if you keep reading this you see this
[1:42:28] guy right here
[1:42:30] so he finished 42 59
[1:42:34] 43 one
[1:42:38] second one second
[1:42:41] and if you watch the video you see him
[1:42:43] he's just starting to raise his arms
[1:42:45] going through the tape
[1:42:47] and this guy just blazes past him
[1:42:50] just you see him coming and like what's
[1:42:53] interesting with the video there's
[1:42:54] police over there's like a a procession
[1:42:56] like this guy's won everything told him
[1:43:00] he had won everything told him
[1:43:03] he had won and this guy at the last
[1:43:07] second snatched
[1:43:10] defeat from the jaws of victory
[1:43:15] from the jaws of victory
[1:43:20] bear with me is this okay i know where
[1:43:22] i've got a lot more ground to cover
[1:43:24] you just don't look at that clock don't
[1:43:25] think about anything
[1:43:28] well don't think about nothing you know
[1:43:29] obviously think about what we're talking
[1:43:32] about here
[1:43:33] so there's this concept and i'm probably
[1:43:36] and
[1:43:36] bear with me we're going through some
[1:43:38] things on purpose is all
[1:43:39] intentional quantum mechanics
[1:43:43] who wants to talk about quantum
[1:43:45] mechanics
[1:43:48] i've got three people yes and i'm going
[1:43:50] to get this wrong because i just threw
[1:43:52] this in here i did do a fair amount of
[1:43:53] research on this
[1:43:54] originally um but it wasn't part of the
[1:43:56] sermon i just it stuck with me i was
[1:43:58] like okay
[1:43:59] drop quantum mechanics in here it's just
[1:44:00] one line so there's principle
[1:44:03] of particles when they're observed
[1:44:07] shift from acting and you can correct me
[1:44:09] on which direction it is
[1:44:10] they shift from acting like a wave or
[1:44:13] like a particle depending on if they are
[1:44:15] observed
[1:44:16] it's literally known there are so there
[1:44:18] are tons of videos on this they've done
[1:44:19] tons of studies on this
[1:44:21] and you can correct me which if i say it
[1:44:23] the wrong direction it's whether it's
[1:44:25] observed if it acts like a wave or a
[1:44:26] particle
[1:44:27] to some extent it doesn't matter for
[1:44:29] this this instance
[1:44:30] what matters is the fact the the act of
[1:44:33] observation
[1:44:35] literally changes at the quantum level
[1:44:39] literally changes how
[1:44:42] things in the sub atomic level react
[1:44:47] whether or not it's observed so whether
[1:44:49] or not it's measured
[1:44:50] if anything is measuring it it literally
[1:44:53] shifts and what's curious about this
[1:44:56] once again you can have these notes um i
[1:44:58] have a whole study on it that's not in
[1:45:00] this sermon
[1:45:01] they did this they tested this with
[1:45:04] meditation
[1:45:06] around the world and they had this
[1:45:09] experiment
[1:45:10] with it not physically being observed by
[1:45:13] any instrument
[1:45:14] but they had and it's a very long
[1:45:17] complicated study you guys can go read
[1:45:18] it i'm just giving you the highlight
[1:45:21] they had thousands tens of thousands of
[1:45:24] people
[1:45:24] so this is a huge sample and they
[1:45:27] accounted for
[1:45:28] vibrations they accounted for everything
[1:45:30] you can think of
[1:45:32] of what could have influenced uh these
[1:45:35] quantum mechanics to shift if something
[1:45:38] in the room was observing it you know
[1:45:39] something like that
[1:45:40] they've literally proven that people
[1:45:42] thinking about
[1:45:43] these particles or from across the world
[1:45:47] shifted it shifted it from a wave
[1:45:51] to a particle it shifted its its its
[1:45:53] action
[1:45:54] how it represented itself and you see
[1:45:57] the same thing here
[1:46:01] vision vision we talk about this
[1:46:05] we live in a time so if you go through
[1:46:08] the in revelations i know we're covering
[1:46:10] a lot of ground stay with me stay awake
[1:46:12] who's still awake
[1:46:13] if i can see a hand ah a couple people
[1:46:16] are asleep
[1:46:18] i know it's complicated for for the kids
[1:46:20] hey good job i saw a hand back there
[1:46:22] on the kids i know it's complicated
[1:46:23] we'll come back to some simple stuff
[1:46:26] come back to some simple stuff one
[1:46:29] second i just want to drop this in here
[1:46:31] we live in a time so we talk about this
[1:46:34] throughout history there's four beasts
[1:46:35] in the bible
[1:46:37] there's the lion ox man and eagle what
[1:46:40] is an eagle an eagle is a bird
[1:46:42] of flight and a vision is the ability
[1:46:46] it's looking ahead it's always its
[1:46:49] ability to perceive
[1:46:51] and see but if you think about it it's
[1:46:54] not
[1:46:54] looking at itself it's not observing
[1:46:58] itself it is observing the goal
[1:47:01] it is observing the target it is aiming
[1:47:04] at the target
[1:47:05] it is its whole perception is to hit
[1:47:09] that thing that's its perception
[1:47:13] and if this runner had had that
[1:47:15] perception if there had been no
[1:47:17] cues around to tell him
[1:47:20] you're done you've made it there had
[1:47:22] been no cues
[1:47:24] he wouldn't have stopped running
[1:47:27] he wouldn't have stopped running
[1:47:33] was going to leave that there
[1:47:37] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[1:47:39] of his ways
[1:47:40] wavering uncertain doubting divided
[1:47:44] in in interest two-spirited
[1:47:47] vacillating looking in two directions
[1:47:51] at once unfocused confused
[1:47:56] seeing i can't do it i can't cross my
[1:47:59] eyes this direction
[1:48:01] seeing two different ways
[1:48:08] let's go ahead and real quick we'll just
[1:48:09] jump into the target
[1:48:11] talk about this you're still with me i
[1:48:12] know this is a lot there's a reason for
[1:48:14] all of this
[1:48:21] all right i don't know well you guys can
[1:48:23] let's uh can someone grab that light
[1:48:24] thank you
[1:48:24] i tried to get this as i don't know this
[1:48:27] is very fast this morning
[1:48:30] so kids has anyone back there ever shot
[1:48:33] of rubber band at someone else
[1:48:36] shot a rubber band threw a ball through
[1:48:39] anything it's somebody else
[1:48:40] okay we got a couple people that
[1:48:42] admitted to it we'll talk to you after
[1:48:43] church i'm just kidding
[1:48:44] i'm just kidding i'm kidding
[1:48:48] i've done it too with thomas oh by the
[1:48:52] way say hi to thomas he's from tennessee
[1:48:54] my good friend right here let's give him
[1:48:56] a clap and welcome
[1:48:57] say hi to him he just turned 18 on
[1:49:00] friday
[1:49:01] so wanted to make sure to get him up
[1:49:02] here and uh
[1:49:04] yeah so represent so once again bring
[1:49:07] greetings from the south as well so
[1:49:09] he's a good guy so um snowballs we've
[1:49:12] all thrown snowballs at someone i mean
[1:49:13] there's tons of snow out there this
[1:49:14] happens you should do it right after
[1:49:15] church but
[1:49:17] represent this concept so we can get
[1:49:20] this idea of
[1:49:21] here's a target i should have put a
[1:49:22] person there instead but we're not going
[1:49:23] to do that
[1:49:24] for the kids just pretend that this is a
[1:49:26] person so if we've got a target
[1:49:28] this is what we're aiming at it's what
[1:49:30] we're looking at and some of you
[1:49:31] remember we talked about this before
[1:49:33] it's a little bit of refresher for a
[1:49:34] reason
[1:49:36] to hit the target is
[1:49:39] the is the effect effectively of faith
[1:49:42] sin means to miss the mark that's
[1:49:45] literally what the word means
[1:49:47] sin means to miss the mark in that i'm
[1:49:49] not able to hit it go ahead and put the
[1:49:51] next one up
[1:49:53] and so if i'm trying to hit the mark the
[1:49:56] bullseye the target
[1:49:57] the person running away from my snowball
[1:49:59] i gotta aim at them
[1:50:01] right i gotta look at them i gotta look
[1:50:04] at them i'm not just gonna be like huh
[1:50:06] now some people if they're practice
[1:50:07] enough you look at pro basketball
[1:50:09] players they can do it
[1:50:10] but even then they're imagining it in
[1:50:12] their mind
[1:50:13] their focus their focus is only on the
[1:50:16] target
[1:50:17] they're not thinking about the defenders
[1:50:19] or the offenders they're they're
[1:50:20] singular of vision their singular
[1:50:24] vision they're aiming they want that
[1:50:26] ball to go through that hoop
[1:50:28] or that ball to go across to make a
[1:50:31] touchdown
[1:50:32] that's their only goal and what's funny
[1:50:34] is if they get their eyes off that goal
[1:50:36] that's when
[1:50:36] they end up you know scoring in the
[1:50:38] opposing team's basket
[1:50:40] or running the opposite direction making
[1:50:41] a touchdown on the other side
[1:50:43] so they're aiming at the target
[1:50:46] and what we have here is degrees
[1:50:49] of aim so you can think of this like
[1:50:53] if i'm looking here it's my direction
[1:50:56] of aim it's a way of measuring
[1:51:00] by degrees i heard someone yawn so
[1:51:04] do we need to stand up and sing a song
[1:51:08] i heard someone clap so i think that
[1:51:09] that's a yes but maybe right after this
[1:51:12] thank god thank god finally sang a song
[1:51:16] we're aiming at the target and i drew
[1:51:18] two lines here to illustrate
[1:51:20] you can look at this this is one degree
[1:51:23] of difference
[1:51:24] from the place of my aim to the target
[1:51:27] look at how much different my spread my
[1:51:30] ability to hit that target
[1:51:32] becomes just from one degree
[1:51:35] shifted i wasn't looking at the target
[1:51:38] quite
[1:51:39] right i didn't have my aim lined up
[1:51:41] quite right let's go to the next one
[1:51:45] uh and this one you can't even see it so
[1:51:47] i made the target very small
[1:51:49] representing it being far off it's far
[1:51:52] away
[1:51:53] it's far away if we're right on the mark
[1:51:56] at the beginning
[1:51:58] we'll hit the target we'll hit the
[1:52:00] target
[1:52:01] but if we're just a little bit off it's
[1:52:03] one degree
[1:52:05] it's literally one degree off here it's
[1:52:07] not it's not a big deal
[1:52:10] and you miss the target completely you
[1:52:13] miss the tar
[1:52:14] it's one millimeter
[1:52:17] so close almost
[1:52:20] there almost there
[1:52:25] go to the next one
[1:52:29] this one so this is another concept so
[1:52:32] we got the first part you
[1:52:33] missed the mark because you weren't
[1:52:35] aimed
[1:52:37] this represents you throw the first
[1:52:40] uh text on there stopping
[1:52:44] short of the mark your aim
[1:52:47] is perfect it's right on the mark you
[1:52:50] think of it once again throwing
[1:52:51] snowballs
[1:52:53] i threw the i looked right at we've all
[1:52:55] had this in basketball
[1:52:56] come on ever like people play soccer
[1:52:58] doesn't matter
[1:53:00] i was like wow laid up for the shot the
[1:53:02] aim was perfect
[1:53:03] and it just hit the ground right in
[1:53:05] front of the basket
[1:53:07] it stopped short my aim my ambition
[1:53:11] my desire was right
[1:53:15] it was right but it stopped short
[1:53:18] it lost velocity it lost momentum
[1:53:22] and it dropped you see this even with
[1:53:23] guns and bullets if
[1:53:25] those of you that don't know depending
[1:53:27] on the distance to the target
[1:53:30] you can literally miss the target
[1:53:32] because it just drops it starts to drop
[1:53:33] eventually the weight of the bullet
[1:53:35] overcomes the propulsion eventually
[1:53:39] eventually go to the next slide
[1:53:44] it stopped short because whoever shot it
[1:53:46] didn't account for the wind
[1:53:49] they didn't account for the distance go
[1:53:51] to the next one
[1:53:52] there was a lack of enough power to
[1:53:56] break through
[1:53:57] the resistance but it was almost
[1:54:00] there the aim was perfect
[1:54:04] it was lined up with christ it just
[1:54:07] didn't have enough to make it
[1:54:11] all the way so close
[1:54:17] first kings 19 and after the earthquake
[1:54:20] of fire
[1:54:21] let's go ahead and we'll just leave this
[1:54:22] up
[1:54:24] after the earthquake of fire but the
[1:54:25] lord was not in the fire and after the
[1:54:28] fire and this is elijah
[1:54:29] elijah was called into the mountain
[1:54:31] because after his showdown with
[1:54:33] with um jezebel after the juniper tree
[1:54:36] experience
[1:54:38] after the juniper tree experience god
[1:54:40] calls him into the wilderness
[1:54:41] to talk to him right how many has been
[1:54:43] through a juniper tree experience
[1:54:45] where you feel like i'm no good i'm
[1:54:47] gonna die god
[1:54:49] you just gotta help me and it's in that
[1:54:52] time
[1:54:53] god calls him into the wilderness alone
[1:54:57] alone with god for 40 days
[1:55:00] and 40 nights alone with god
[1:55:06] and after the earthquake so he's in the
[1:55:07] mountain there's an earthquake
[1:55:09] after the earthquake of fire but the
[1:55:11] lord was not in the fire
[1:55:13] and after the fire and you can go
[1:55:15] through this there was a thunder and
[1:55:16] lightning and everything else
[1:55:18] there was a still small voice
[1:55:26] he didn't stop at the fire
[1:55:30] he didn't stop at the thunder he didn't
[1:55:33] stop at the lightning at the earthquake
[1:55:36] he didn't stop he waited
[1:55:39] for the still small voice and you can
[1:55:41] look at it he found the exact
[1:55:43] he was feeling all alone he was feeling
[1:55:46] all alone god asked him what what are
[1:55:49] you doing here elijah just updating like
[1:55:51] i say what doest thou
[1:55:52] what are you doing here elijah and he
[1:55:55] said i've been very
[1:55:56] jealous for the lord god of hosts i've
[1:55:58] been very good i've been very
[1:56:00] zeal he had just had a mount carmel
[1:56:03] experience
[1:56:04] 40 days before because the children of
[1:56:08] israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown
[1:56:10] down thine altars
[1:56:12] and slain thy prophets of the sword and
[1:56:14] i even i only am left and they seek my
[1:56:16] life to take it and of course
[1:56:18] if you go on god tells him the exact
[1:56:20] answer to that need
[1:56:21] you're not alone i've left i've left a
[1:56:24] propitiation i've left
[1:56:26] i think it's 7 000 other men
[1:56:29] for there's a people you're not alone
[1:56:34] you are not alone
[1:56:38] psalm 78 verse 40. how often we're just
[1:56:42] going to leave this up here like i said
[1:56:44] how oft did they provoke him in the
[1:56:46] wilderness speaking of the children of
[1:56:47] israel
[1:56:48] and grieve him in the desert yes they
[1:56:50] turned back and tempted god
[1:56:52] and limited the holy one of israel they
[1:56:55] remembered not his hand
[1:56:56] nor the day when he delivered them from
[1:56:58] the enemy
[1:56:59] have not i sent thee in 1962 and you'll
[1:57:02] see
[1:57:03] an accident that just almost takes your
[1:57:05] life and you'll say oh
[1:57:07] if i would have died lord thank you for
[1:57:09] sparing me
[1:57:10] speaking of us i'm going to serve you
[1:57:13] then forget about it see
[1:57:17] until one until one's done
[1:57:20] caught you see and then it's too late
[1:57:24] see you always the people usually forget
[1:57:28] god
[1:57:29] they don't always do it thank god for
[1:57:31] that but
[1:57:32] mostly it's easy to forget
[1:57:35] when everything's going good
[1:57:41] when everything's going good
[1:57:48] what happens so we're gonna go ahead
[1:57:50] once again
[1:57:52] stay with me go to the next slide we'll
[1:57:53] go to the velocity
[1:57:56] portion to escape velocity
[1:57:59] so there's this concept in
[1:58:03] space travel i know we're talking about
[1:58:05] some you know this is literally
[1:58:06] rocket science today so
[1:58:10] is this concept getting to space
[1:58:14] is easy it's not like something could do
[1:58:16] you could do in your car this is
[1:58:17] directly off of an article you can see
[1:58:19] all the sources
[1:58:20] but it's not a huge challenge you could
[1:58:22] get a person to space with a small
[1:58:24] sounding rocket the size of a telephone
[1:58:26] pole
[1:58:28] the x-15 aircraft reach space just by
[1:58:30] going fast and then steering up
[1:58:34] but getting to space is easy the problem
[1:58:37] is
[1:58:37] staying there the problem is
[1:58:41] staying there go to the the blue one
[1:58:48] so we think no yeah that one hey take it
[1:58:51] out for a second don't read that
[1:58:53] look at me we think
[1:58:58] we're going up once again thinking of
[1:58:59] that target we're going to space
[1:59:01] kids space is awesome right you look at
[1:59:03] the stars ever telescope
[1:59:06] space is awesome i want to go up in
[1:59:08] space go to the moon you know all this
[1:59:10] stuff that people
[1:59:12] people get excited about
[1:59:15] but what happens is as we're going up
[1:59:18] you could just
[1:59:19] barely have enough velocity or barely
[1:59:22] not have enough velocity
[1:59:23] and what happens if we throw that uh the
[1:59:25] first diagram back up not the blue one
[1:59:27] sorry about that
[1:59:28] i meant to mention this more is the
[1:59:31] as you go up if you don't have enough
[1:59:35] velocity
[1:59:36] that's fine if you don't have enough
[1:59:38] velocity to break the earth's
[1:59:40] gravitational pull
[1:59:43] to actually travel in outer space
[1:59:46] one you'll go back down and hit the
[1:59:49] earth and crash and burn
[1:59:51] two you'll end up here and maybe
[1:59:54] wander around and then three you'll end
[1:59:57] up in orbit
[1:59:58] around the earth you'll end up in orbit
[2:00:01] you can throw
[2:00:01] the blue one back up misconception alert
[2:00:05] most satellites and spacecraft sent into
[2:00:08] space
[2:00:09] do not reach escape velocity
[2:00:12] sorry for all the jumping around space
[2:00:14] is usually considered to start at an
[2:00:16] altitude of 100 kilometers blah blah got
[2:00:18] details this is known
[2:00:20] if a rocket goes fast enough and high
[2:00:23] enough to enter
[2:00:24] space but does not reach escape velocity
[2:00:27] it will enter orbit around the earth
[2:00:31] the international space station and many
[2:00:33] satellites orbit
[2:00:34] the earth so you think of this as
[2:00:37] spiritual
[2:00:38] astronauts we we are called
[2:00:42] to leave this earth
[2:00:45] to leave the influences of this earth
[2:00:48] we're called
[2:00:49] not to be to exist in these outer rings
[2:00:51] of our body
[2:00:52] we're not just existing in our spirit we
[2:00:54] want to go into the soul
[2:00:56] to actually have an experience with god
[2:00:59] to actually go somewhere with god
[2:01:03] to go somewhere with god come
[2:01:06] follow me follow me you look at the call
[2:01:10] jesus gave
[2:01:11] everyone it's not just
[2:01:15] an accepting christ and christ coming
[2:01:17] into your heart and now you sit there
[2:01:19] that's not it it is a active
[2:01:22] walk it is an active walking with god
[2:01:26] and what happens far too often is we end
[2:01:29] up with a
[2:01:30] stay with me we end up with enough
[2:01:33] velocity
[2:01:35] enough of a commitment to god just
[2:01:38] to get off the ground and get stuck in
[2:01:40] the earth's orbit
[2:01:44] stuck no more fuel
[2:01:47] no more propulsion just circling the
[2:01:51] earth
[2:01:52] i'm in space praise god i'm in space
[2:01:56] i'm i've left i got my mind made up
[2:02:00] i'm i'm never coming back down
[2:02:04] in space floating around
[2:02:09] in the spirit floating around
[2:02:12] not going anywhere with god
[2:02:16] not going anywhere just a floater
[2:02:19] wandering around taking pictures of the
[2:02:22] earth
[2:02:22] taking pictures of the stars this is
[2:02:25] amazing
[2:02:26] look at all those people down on the
[2:02:27] earth they have no idea
[2:02:29] they have no idea i've arrived i'm in
[2:02:32] space
[2:02:34] i'm in space
[2:02:39] two kings 18 now elijah was falling sick
[2:02:43] of his sickness whereof he died
[2:02:46] coming to a close in a brother kaido
[2:02:48] diggs fashion
[2:02:50] now elisha was falling sick of his
[2:02:52] sickness whereof he died everybody stand
[2:02:54] up real quick
[2:02:54] everybody right now everybody turn
[2:02:56] around
[2:02:58] turn around five times to the right just
[2:03:01] don't get too dizzy
[2:03:02] then turn around five times to the left
[2:03:05] and just imagine you're floating in
[2:03:06] space
[2:03:08] you're floating in space and
[2:03:12] hopefully you have some propulsion nice
[2:03:14] sound effects whoever just put that
[2:03:15] through the
[2:03:15] all right you can be seated ready for
[2:03:18] liftoff
[2:03:19] yes somebody say praise the lord
[2:03:22] praise the lord say this is the most
[2:03:24] amazing thing i've ever heard
[2:03:29] that's all right that's all right
[2:03:32] this is for somebody now elisha was
[2:03:36] fallen sick of his sickness whereof he
[2:03:39] died and joash the king of israel came
[2:03:41] down unto him and wept over his face and
[2:03:43] said
[2:03:44] o my father my father the chariot of
[2:03:46] israel and the horsemen thereof
[2:03:47] and elijah said unto him take bow and
[2:03:49] arrows and he took unto him bow and
[2:03:51] arrow and he said
[2:03:52] to the king of israel put thine hand
[2:03:54] upon the bow and he put his hand upon it
[2:03:57] and elisha put his hand upon the king's
[2:03:59] hands think of it he's got the prophet
[2:04:01] literally directing his aim his aim is
[2:04:03] perfect it's exactly to the target
[2:04:05] he's following in exactly what the
[2:04:07] prophet told them to do
[2:04:08] he's looking exactly to where the
[2:04:10] prophet told him to look he's
[2:04:12] right directly on the mark
[2:04:15] he's got the the elijah's hands on his
[2:04:18] hands he's guided by the spirit
[2:04:20] he's literally on the mark on
[2:04:24] the threshold and he said open the
[2:04:27] window eastward and he opened it and
[2:04:29] elisha said
[2:04:30] shoot and he shot and he said the arrow
[2:04:33] of the lord's deliverance
[2:04:35] and the error of deliverance from syria
[2:04:37] for thou shalt smite the syrians and
[2:04:39] aphec
[2:04:40] till thou have consumed them praise
[2:04:43] god right i can imagine i can't imagine
[2:04:46] joe after like
[2:04:47] this was a good thing to come talk to
[2:04:49] elisha right like
[2:04:50] praise the lord the error of god's
[2:04:52] deliverance we are going to you know
[2:04:54] we're going to
[2:04:56] till thou have consumed them i mean he
[2:04:57] just said it
[2:04:59] we've won yes
[2:05:03] and he said elisha take the arrows
[2:05:06] and he took them and he said unto the
[2:05:08] king of israel
[2:05:10] smite upon the ground and he smote
[2:05:12] thrice
[2:05:13] and stayed three times with number of
[2:05:15] perfection biblically that's really good
[2:05:17] right
[2:05:18] you know father son holy ghost
[2:05:21] smoted three times and the man of god
[2:05:25] was
[2:05:26] wrathed with him and said thou shouldest
[2:05:28] have smitten
[2:05:30] five or six times then hats thou smitten
[2:05:33] syria
[2:05:34] till thou heads consumed it whereas now
[2:05:36] thou shalt smite syria but thrice
[2:05:40] but you wouldn't utterly consume them
[2:05:45] he already had victory in his
[2:05:48] profession he already had victory the
[2:05:51] prophet just told me i got victory
[2:05:53] okay this is just i'm just going through
[2:05:55] the motions now
[2:05:56] beat the ground three times he said beat
[2:05:58] the ground three times they say get
[2:06:00] baptized
[2:06:01] they said come to church on sunday and
[2:06:02] wednesday they said to pay my tithe
[2:06:07] going through the motions going through
[2:06:11] the motions
[2:06:17] everything would be all right they think
[2:06:19] elijah in the meal offering 1960 but the
[2:06:21] nation had thought
[2:06:23] as long as they were eating good and
[2:06:24] were well clothed that everything would
[2:06:26] be
[2:06:27] all right
[2:06:31] and you see this it's on the border
[2:06:35] it's on the threshold and i know i'm
[2:06:37] saying this over and over
[2:06:38] we're coming to something i'm coming to
[2:06:40] a close
[2:06:42] it is on the border
[2:06:45] of true victory of true deliverance
[2:06:50] of true baptism of true feeling of the
[2:06:53] holy ghost
[2:06:55] that we stop short
[2:06:59] just short of the target and end up
[2:07:02] a floater floating around in space
[2:07:05] floating around church floating from
[2:07:07] church to church
[2:07:08] i wonder if this is right i wonder if
[2:07:10] that's right i can
[2:07:12] see the word there it is pray i can see
[2:07:14] the earth
[2:07:15] but if you know the so the u.s space
[2:07:17] station that's floating around
[2:07:18] the i guess the russia and the u.s and a
[2:07:21] couple other countries are all in on
[2:07:22] this but
[2:07:23] we call the u.s space station it's
[2:07:26] floating up there
[2:07:28] it's floating up there it is still
[2:07:31] affected by
[2:07:32] 90 of the gravity as you
[2:07:35] and i it just happens to be floating
[2:07:38] around in space
[2:07:40] 90 percent they're just able
[2:07:43] to be moving around the earth fast
[2:07:45] enough
[2:07:47] that in effect the force is keeping them
[2:07:49] aloft
[2:07:50] it's keeping them aloft and that's the
[2:07:52] same thing sometimes
[2:07:54] you see this it's people they're running
[2:07:56] they're running
[2:07:58] if i just keep moving if i just keep
[2:08:01] moving
[2:08:01] i'm okay if i just keep moving if i just
[2:08:04] go to the next event
[2:08:05] if i just go to the next revival
[2:08:08] they're just keep moving this frantic
[2:08:11] ongoing moving
[2:08:15] but yet they know something's pulling
[2:08:17] them back down to the earth
[2:08:20] something is pulling them back down to
[2:08:22] the earth
[2:08:23] because they never really left it they
[2:08:26] never really left it
[2:08:30] they're almost there but they didn't
[2:08:42] how do we do this
[2:08:45] how do we leave
[2:08:49] we need more velocity
[2:08:54] we need more propulsion we need more
[2:08:56] fuel
[2:08:58] we need more oomph
[2:09:01] bible calls it dunamis it's literally
[2:09:04] the root word
[2:09:04] that we get for dynamite dot you need
[2:09:08] more
[2:09:09] boom we need more boom
[2:09:12] and that boom is not just a loud noise
[2:09:17] it's not just a loud noise it is a inner
[2:09:20] fire it is an inner work
[2:09:24] it is an inner thing going back to ruth
[2:09:28] 1 verse 15
[2:09:30] and she said this is naomi again
[2:09:33] coming back around behold thy
[2:09:36] sister-in-law has gone back
[2:09:38] unto her people and unto her gods
[2:09:40] speaking to ruth
[2:09:42] return thou after that so orphans just
[2:09:44] left
[2:09:45] there's a way out she's not in the
[2:09:48] majority anymore
[2:09:50] she there's a way naomi's literally
[2:09:52] telling her to go
[2:09:54] telling her to go her family
[2:09:58] the only family she's got is telling her
[2:10:01] to go maybe she's got some family in the
[2:10:03] world
[2:10:06] telling her to go return now
[2:10:09] after thy sister-in-law and ruth said
[2:10:12] entreat me
[2:10:13] not to leave thee or to return from
[2:10:16] from following after thee for whither
[2:10:19] thou
[2:10:20] goist wherever you go
[2:10:23] take i wanted to change that it's the
[2:10:26] same word we just get so we we we
[2:10:28] we just wither so ever we don't pay
[2:10:31] attention
[2:10:33] wherever you go i
[2:10:36] will go where you lodge where you stay
[2:10:40] i'm gonna stay your people are gonna be
[2:10:44] my people and your god my god
[2:10:47] where you die i'll die
[2:10:52] and there will i be buried
[2:10:55] and may the lord do so to me and more
[2:10:57] also
[2:10:58] if ought but death part theme if
[2:11:01] anything
[2:11:02] separates us then may the lord smite me
[2:11:05] dead that's effectively what she's
[2:11:07] saying
[2:11:07] if anything but death separates i'm
[2:11:10] gonna go with you no matter what
[2:11:12] no matter what and when she saw that she
[2:11:16] was steadfastly minded to go with her
[2:11:19] then she left speaking and of course
[2:11:20] steadfastly it's an old-fashioned word
[2:11:23] when she was determined she was
[2:11:26] determined
[2:11:27] to go then naomi
[2:11:30] left speaking unto her
[2:11:34] matthew 22 36 going fast coming to a
[2:11:37] close
[2:11:38] master which is the great commandment in
[2:11:41] the law
[2:11:42] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[2:11:44] lord thy god with all thy heart and with
[2:11:46] all thy soul and with all thy mind
[2:11:48] this is the first and great commandment
[2:11:51] and the second is like unto it thou
[2:11:53] shalt love thy neighbor
[2:11:55] as thyself on these two commandments
[2:12:00] hang all the law
[2:12:03] and the prophets and i want to just
[2:12:04] drill down
[2:12:06] what these the words they're using this
[2:12:09] is the actual meaning of those words
[2:12:14] to love the lord your god from the seed
[2:12:16] of your appetite
[2:12:17] the seat of emotion and passions
[2:12:20] inclination
[2:12:21] resolution determination from the man
[2:12:25] himself or woman from the self
[2:12:29] from the person from the individual from
[2:12:32] the activity of mind the activity of the
[2:12:34] will
[2:12:35] activity of the character by might
[2:12:39] by force and abundance by demand
[2:12:44] and you can cross this over matthew
[2:12:48] 6 seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[2:12:51] his righteousness and all these things
[2:12:52] shall be added unto you
[2:12:54] take therefore no thought for the moral
[2:12:56] for the moral shall take thought for the
[2:12:57] things of itself
[2:12:58] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[2:13:00] thereof
[2:13:02] that word seek literally means and i've
[2:13:05] said this here before but i think it's
[2:13:06] worth emphasizing because i believe
[2:13:08] it is the singular most critical thing
[2:13:11] in our lives
[2:13:12] i believe this i live my life i will
[2:13:15] stay
[2:13:16] i will die on this i believe it
[2:13:20] we are called to crave
[2:13:23] him that's what that word means it is to
[2:13:26] crave him
[2:13:27] to demand it in a sense not god you owe
[2:13:30] me
[2:13:30] but god just like ruth
[2:13:34] where you go i will go your people will
[2:13:37] be my people
[2:13:38] if anything stops me smite me dead
[2:13:42] smut where you die i will die
[2:13:47] and that's what it takes to be a
[2:13:50] christian
[2:13:51] that's what it takes to actually hit the
[2:13:53] mark
[2:13:54] that's what it takes is an actual and
[2:13:57] you look at this hebrews 11 again
[2:13:59] but without faith it is impossible
[2:14:03] it's impossible to please him for he
[2:14:06] that cometh to god
[2:14:08] he that hits the target must believe
[2:14:11] that he is
[2:14:13] he that he is and that he's a warner of
[2:14:16] them that
[2:14:17] diligently seek him and that same word
[2:14:20] is the
[2:14:21] exact same word the exact same word
[2:14:25] to crave to require to demand
[2:14:28] to demand it of this life that no matter
[2:14:31] what
[2:14:31] happens no matter what happens
[2:14:35] i don't care if my leg gets blown off i
[2:14:37] don't care if i end up
[2:14:39] out there in the street with the rioters
[2:14:41] out there i don't care what happens
[2:14:43] no matter what happens
[2:14:46] i will never stop and if i do
[2:14:49] god strike me dead strike me dead today
[2:14:53] and there are people right now
[2:14:54] in this room that are thinking but isn't
[2:14:56] that tempting god
[2:14:59] isn't that tempting god
[2:15:02] isn't that tempting god it's just
[2:15:05] not so it's holding
[2:15:09] god to his word
[2:15:13] it's not demanding it in the sense of
[2:15:14] you oh me god like you
[2:15:17] we recognize god i am nothing
[2:15:20] i am nothing i am absolutely nothing
[2:15:23] but you said you are the vine i'm the
[2:15:27] branches if you don't come
[2:15:29] and flow through me i'm gonna make a
[2:15:31] mess out of it so god
[2:15:33] you said you said it i need you
[2:15:37] i'm craving after you you've gotta come
[2:15:40] i need you i'm not gonna hit the target
[2:15:44] we've all fallen short we've all been
[2:15:47] born and sinned
[2:15:48] by nature we will all miss the mark but
[2:15:51] by the power of christ
[2:15:53] in me by the power of christ in me
[2:15:56] not anything i can do but by his own
[2:16:00] spirit by his own spirit
[2:16:04] seeky first and that word first
[2:16:08] love it means of utmost
[2:16:12] importance priority
[2:16:15] everything it is first
[2:16:20] relationships aren't first family isn't
[2:16:22] first
[2:16:23] bible goes on to say if you don't hate
[2:16:27] your father your mother your brother
[2:16:30] your wife your sister
[2:16:32] for my name's sake and that sounds
[2:16:34] really harsh but he's trying to make a
[2:16:36] point
[2:16:36] if you don't count the searching of my
[2:16:41] spirit greater than these things you've
[2:16:43] missed the mark
[2:16:45] if you don't count this of of greater
[2:16:47] value and importance
[2:16:50] and you see this all the time people get
[2:16:52] that out of line
[2:16:53] they're so close they're almost there
[2:16:56] they let the pastor get right up there
[2:16:58] between them and god they let their wife
[2:17:00] get up there between them and god
[2:17:02] they let their own selves get between
[2:17:05] them and god
[2:17:07] so close almost there
[2:17:12] they can allow the church to get between
[2:17:14] them and god they allow what they're
[2:17:16] doing for the church to be
[2:17:18] between them and god seeking first the
[2:17:20] kingdom is not
[2:17:21] just getting out there and witnessing or
[2:17:23] testifying or paying our ties or showing
[2:17:25] up and singing or reading the bible
[2:17:27] 12 times it's not listening to the
[2:17:29] sermons
[2:17:30] all day every day all night long to the
[2:17:32] point where i can repeat it out of my
[2:17:34] mouth without even thinking about it
[2:17:36] that's not seeking the kingdom
[2:17:38] those are tactics those are things
[2:17:42] to do those are things that may help me
[2:17:44] seek the kingdom
[2:17:45] those are all great they're fine i'm all
[2:17:47] for it but really
[2:17:49] at the end of the day if you go back in
[2:17:52] time
[2:17:53] if all of this was gone what would be
[2:17:56] left
[2:17:58] you and god that's it
[2:18:01] you and god and we must we
[2:18:04] absolutely and i'm talking to you young
[2:18:06] people too and myself and you old people
[2:18:11] oh y'all yes
[2:18:15] we must we must especially now today in
[2:18:18] this time
[2:18:19] where things we we were things it
[2:18:21] doesn't even matter
[2:18:23] i would say it's less dangerous now than
[2:18:25] it was
[2:18:26] like a while ago even years ago like wow
[2:18:29] things are so great back whenever you
[2:18:31] know 10 years ago when gas prices were
[2:18:33] low and
[2:18:35] it is in those seasons it doesn't matter
[2:18:39] we've got two cert there's two reasons
[2:18:41] why people don't cross
[2:18:43] that threshold one
[2:18:46] they're afraid they're
[2:18:49] afraid and they stop short
[2:18:53] they're afraid look at the rich young
[2:18:55] ruler god
[2:18:57] caught jesus himself in flesh
[2:19:00] stood in front of him he asked the right
[2:19:02] question to the right person and he got
[2:19:04] the right answer
[2:19:06] and jesus came and said you've got to
[2:19:09] forsake it all
[2:19:10] that's what he really said we can go
[2:19:12] down to the detail like no it's because
[2:19:14] riches are bad
[2:19:15] and he had to go give away all of his
[2:19:16] money and that's why and richard
[2:19:18] like no no that's not the point that's
[2:19:19] not what he meant he took the thing that
[2:19:21] was most valuable to him
[2:19:23] he took that thing whatever is most
[2:19:26] valuable to you
[2:19:27] god will call you to that point where
[2:19:29] you have to choose
[2:19:30] between that and him absolutely he will
[2:19:34] he will bring you to that point
[2:19:35] where you must absolutely choose
[2:19:38] and you know what he may even give that
[2:19:40] thing back to you
[2:19:42] a hundred fold later on but you have to
[2:19:44] come to that point
[2:19:45] where even if he doesn't like job
[2:19:49] we are all called to that point to that
[2:19:52] walk to that place
[2:19:53] where we reach the the end of our
[2:19:56] ability the end of our understanding
[2:19:59] when we can
[2:19:59] actually cry out to god though you slay
[2:20:02] me
[2:20:04] though you abandon me though i can't see
[2:20:07] you
[2:20:08] though i don't know what to do though it
[2:20:10] feels as if the entire
[2:20:14] world god i'm
[2:20:16] not going to stop i'm not going to stop
[2:20:20] i'm not going to stop loving you
[2:20:23] serving you believing in you i'm
[2:20:26] never going to stop i'm not going to
[2:20:29] stop
[2:20:31] samson gave god his strength coming to a
[2:20:34] close i'm watching the time
[2:20:36] samson gave god his strength but he
[2:20:37] never gave him his heart
[2:20:40] and we see that again people that love
[2:20:42] the lord and you should do those things
[2:20:43] let's
[2:20:44] come to chur i've done it my whole life
[2:20:47] come up and sing and play the
[2:20:48] instruments and all those are great i'm
[2:20:50] all for it i love it
[2:20:53] but it's beyond that it's beyond that
[2:20:56] let's throw up the the courts again
[2:20:59] we're good we are coming to a close
[2:21:03] except that i accidentally scrolled back
[2:21:04] up to the top of my notes so i'm going
[2:21:06] to preach the whole sermon again
[2:21:10] it literally just happened oops
[2:21:21] it comes down
[2:21:25] elisha we'll just leave this up here for
[2:21:28] now
[2:21:28] elisha and it came to pass
[2:21:32] when the lord would take up elijah into
[2:21:34] heaven by our world and we know the
[2:21:36] story
[2:21:37] but look at the parallels with ruth it's
[2:21:40] the exact
[2:21:41] same thing and elijah said unto elisha
[2:21:45] uh it when the lord would take up elijah
[2:21:48] into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah
[2:21:50] went with elisha from gilgal
[2:21:51] and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i
[2:21:54] pray thee
[2:21:54] for the lord hath sent me to bethel and
[2:21:57] elisha said unto him
[2:21:58] as the lord liveth and as thy soul
[2:22:00] liveth i will not leave thee
[2:22:03] so they went down to bethel and of
[2:22:04] course we can read we're just going to
[2:22:06] skip through this because there's a bit
[2:22:07] here
[2:22:07] son of the prophets come up don't you
[2:22:09] know that god's gonna take your prophet
[2:22:11] that's what they keep saying don't you
[2:22:12] know like just like the world don't you
[2:22:14] know
[2:22:15] this is about to happen don't you know
[2:22:18] don't you know and he and elijah
[2:22:21] continually says
[2:22:22] yeah i know hold your peace be quiet
[2:22:25] i know but just be quiet
[2:22:29] don't listen to it my eyes are on elijah
[2:22:33] focusing on elijah and elijah said until
[2:22:36] elisha
[2:22:37] terry here stay stay at bethel you know
[2:22:40] what bethel means
[2:22:41] the house of god stay at the house of
[2:22:44] god
[2:22:46] that sounds really good doesn't it
[2:22:48] sounds great
[2:22:49] for the lord has sent me to jericho and
[2:22:52] jericho
[2:22:52] represents if you're looking at this it
[2:22:55] represents
[2:22:56] walking down the road to hell
[2:22:59] it literally means it's a backsliders
[2:23:02] walk
[2:23:03] the road to jericho is a backsliders
[2:23:06] walk it's going to get real rough from
[2:23:09] here
[2:23:10] stay in bed stay in the house of god
[2:23:13] the lord has sent me to jericho and he
[2:23:15] said as the lord liveth and as thy soul
[2:23:18] liveth i will not leave thee so they
[2:23:21] came to jericho
[2:23:23] and again the sons of the prophets we
[2:23:24] know came to elisha said the same thing
[2:23:26] and he again says be quiet shut up
[2:23:31] i miss brother john lafontaine he used
[2:23:32] to say that all the time
[2:23:34] like sometimes you just need to tell the
[2:23:36] devil shut up
[2:23:38] shut up sometimes you need to tell
[2:23:40] yourself
[2:23:41] shut up and just like brother kaidri i'm
[2:23:43] practicing the ministry of shut your
[2:23:45] mouth
[2:23:47] shut your mouth yes
[2:23:50] shut up don't talk about it don't talk
[2:23:53] about it yeah something's going wrong
[2:23:54] who cares
[2:23:56] doesn't matter don't talk about it don't
[2:23:58] spread that thing around
[2:23:59] don't don't just say like oh yeah let's
[2:24:01] just me oh look at what's happening
[2:24:04] like a monster just coming out of you
[2:24:07] spread that thing around everybody
[2:24:09] should know about this
[2:24:12] and elijah said to him terry here i pray
[2:24:15] thee
[2:24:16] for the lord that sent me to jordan
[2:24:19] and jordan represents death
[2:24:22] jordan represents death to watch out for
[2:24:24] jordan
[2:24:25] um and he said as the lord that's why
[2:24:29] he's always wearing black
[2:24:31] as the lord liveth and as thy soul
[2:24:33] liveth
[2:24:34] i will not leave thee and they went on
[2:24:38] and of course we know the rest of the
[2:24:39] story that god
[2:24:40] came and because of this it was after
[2:24:43] this
[2:24:44] that elijah told him if you see you know
[2:24:46] he asked him what do you want
[2:24:48] he obtained the promise because he
[2:24:51] followed him
[2:24:52] from the house of god he didn't leave
[2:24:54] god in church
[2:24:56] he didn't just stay at church he
[2:24:58] followed god
[2:25:00] through his own backslidings through his
[2:25:03] own
[2:25:04] struggles through his own garbage
[2:25:08] though he would stray through the valley
[2:25:10] of the shadow of death
[2:25:13] i will fear no evil for you're with me
[2:25:16] he followed him
[2:25:17] all the way to the point of death
[2:25:21] always and it was after they had crossed
[2:25:24] over
[2:25:25] they'd cross that threshold that he
[2:25:28] obtained the promise
[2:25:30] he crossed that threshold
[2:25:34] and obtained the promise
[2:25:40] it comes down to death
[2:25:45] and that's why people stay here coming
[2:25:47] to a close i'm for real
[2:25:49] they don't want to die
[2:25:53] because to go in here means to die
[2:25:57] you cannot stay who you are
[2:26:01] and go in here you can't you can't stay
[2:26:04] who you are
[2:26:05] that old being inside of you the man
[2:26:09] or woman themselves that
[2:26:12] thing will go
[2:26:15] you it is to die it is literally and
[2:26:18] it's funny because we see this outer man
[2:26:20] and the body
[2:26:21] and we think i know they didn't die they
[2:26:24] didn't die they just change you know
[2:26:26] their spirit they just like god this all
[2:26:27] cleaned up
[2:26:28] no they're not the same they are not
[2:26:31] the same and i know it's happened to me
[2:26:34] i know
[2:26:35] i'm not the same there's something
[2:26:37] different it's not that i don't have
[2:26:38] problems out here it's not that this
[2:26:40] thing doesn't get smokey and
[2:26:42] you know i have to rechange this oil and
[2:26:43] i got to go back out and you know do
[2:26:45] this
[2:26:45] this offering in the rain and sometimes
[2:26:47] something in here
[2:26:50] and it's real it's real
[2:26:53] it's real coming to a close
[2:26:56] it's real
[2:26:59] by faith hebrews 11 enoch was translated
[2:27:02] that he should not see
[2:27:03] death and was not found he crossed this
[2:27:06] but he didn't see physical death
[2:27:11] god had translated him like elijah think
[2:27:13] about that enoch and elijah
[2:27:16] he had this testimony that he pleased
[2:27:19] god
[2:27:20] and that's the portion right before but
[2:27:23] without faith it is impossible to please
[2:27:25] him
[2:27:26] for he that cometh to god must believe
[2:27:27] that he is and then he's a rewarder of
[2:27:28] them that diligently seek him
[2:27:30] so we can infer or conclude
[2:27:33] enoch diligently sought
[2:27:36] god he diligently craved
[2:27:40] god and it's not in a coincidence
[2:27:44] that we talk about enoch walking with
[2:27:47] god
[2:27:49] craving leads to seeking leads to
[2:27:52] following
[2:27:54] i must have this it's this
[2:27:57] continual moving towards him
[2:28:03] and i will also say and i am at coming
[2:28:05] to a close just give me five minutes and
[2:28:06] then we'll call the musicians
[2:28:09] the genesis of this for myself the re
[2:28:12] this sermon came to me just a few weeks
[2:28:14] ago so this is
[2:28:14] brand new um for me like i'm sure
[2:28:17] someone's preached it before
[2:28:18] um but because there's nothing new under
[2:28:21] the sun
[2:28:22] god god allows these things times but
[2:28:24] this became real to me
[2:28:26] i noticed in myself i noticed in myself
[2:28:32] let's go ahead and throw up the matthew
[2:28:34] principle real quick
[2:28:35] the slide those of you that know me and
[2:28:39] i've preached about it before i've been
[2:28:41] through a pretty hard couple of years
[2:28:42] and it's been rough
[2:28:44] and something in me has shifted even
[2:28:46] beyond anything i had
[2:28:48] i don't know i can't explain it i know
[2:28:50] it's real
[2:28:51] i i know it's it's like it's changed for
[2:28:55] me
[2:28:55] it is literally it's inside and i've
[2:28:58] reached that point
[2:28:59] like yeah i know i experienced god
[2:29:01] before that but it was in
[2:29:03] the suffering in the worst
[2:29:06] parts of my life where i got to the
[2:29:08] point where i could
[2:29:09] i didn't know i wasn't even sure god was
[2:29:12] real
[2:29:14] and it was in that that god became real
[2:29:17] that god became real was in that i had
[2:29:21] no ability in myself to make him real
[2:29:26] and he made himself real he made himself
[2:29:29] real
[2:29:30] he made himself real in that and i'm so
[2:29:33] grateful for that
[2:29:35] so grateful for that and i realized you
[2:29:38] know here it's been a long journey and
[2:29:40] things have been getting better and
[2:29:41] better and i just feel this feeling
[2:29:44] and so there's this matthew principle so
[2:29:46] again this is a lot of stuff i am coming
[2:29:47] to a close
[2:29:49] and they talk about this jesus matthew
[2:29:52] 13 for whosoever hath to him shall be
[2:29:54] given
[2:29:55] and he shall have more abundance but
[2:29:56] whosoever hath not
[2:29:58] from him shall be taken away even that
[2:30:00] he hath and people look at this like wow
[2:30:02] that sounds awful jesus like i thought
[2:30:03] you were kind
[2:30:04] no it's a principle it is a literal law
[2:30:08] it's a law of god everything
[2:30:11] engages in this and i've been through
[2:30:13] this so on this end of the
[2:30:14] this grid and i just hastily drew this
[2:30:16] together when
[2:30:18] things start going bad they all go bad
[2:30:22] this principle of compounding interest
[2:30:24] like a circle
[2:30:25] all of a sudden things spiral downward
[2:30:28] and it seems like
[2:30:29] everything goes wrong all at once you
[2:30:31] typically go from a plateau where things
[2:30:33] were pretty good
[2:30:34] and you got lazy stop
[2:30:38] stop walking with god and everything's
[2:30:41] fine and then all of a sudden it gets
[2:30:43] bad
[2:30:44] really fast compounding
[2:30:48] one thing happens and the next thing
[2:30:49] happens then the next thing happens
[2:30:52] we've all been there we've all and we
[2:30:54] will be there again
[2:30:55] we will it will happen and it's somehow
[2:30:59] i've
[2:30:59] i've managed to make this and it's weird
[2:31:02] it's very strange but i feel this
[2:31:05] feeling i'm right here
[2:31:07] where everything's about to get way
[2:31:09] better
[2:31:10] i feel it it's weird i'm like wow
[2:31:12] everything like
[2:31:14] like thomas like i was telling his
[2:31:15] brother josh like i was literally like
[2:31:17] everything's about to change i feel it
[2:31:19] like i feel like my wit
[2:31:20] my wings are in the wind and
[2:31:22] everything's about to change
[2:31:25] and that's great praise god and what
[2:31:28] happened next was the weirdest
[2:31:30] thing i found right here
[2:31:34] all of a sudden i started doing this
[2:31:38] it's this hesitation at the threshold
[2:31:43] this hesitation and i noticed it in
[2:31:46] myself
[2:31:47] you know i've got goals i've got
[2:31:48] ambitions i've prayed a lot i've talked
[2:31:49] to god and like okay god these are the
[2:31:51] things that i really feel like i should
[2:31:52] be aiming at like
[2:31:53] spend a lot of time and i've seen god
[2:31:55] direct me
[2:31:56] and i can see them like wow these are
[2:31:59] everything's about to get way better
[2:32:03] and in that i i just like i felt that
[2:32:07] feeling of like i just don't want to get
[2:32:08] up in the morning i don't want to like
[2:32:09] what is going on like what what what's
[2:32:11] happening
[2:32:13] and i woke up one morning and it's like
[2:32:14] something and i don't like to say god
[2:32:16] told me because that sounds so definite
[2:32:17] it's like oh yeah god talks to me like
[2:32:20] he does but i don't want you know i just
[2:32:23] i don't know i don't i don't like that
[2:32:24] but something spoke to me and i heard it
[2:32:27] was like a thought
[2:32:28] as soon as i woke up said you have not
[2:32:32] prepared yourself
[2:32:33] for success and just spoke and
[2:32:36] just left i was like i haven't prepared
[2:32:39] myself for success and i what does that
[2:32:41] mean
[2:32:41] i started thinking about that next day i
[2:32:44] was taking a nap
[2:32:45] as i was laying down it was this image
[2:32:47] the same one
[2:32:48] let's go to the through the target image
[2:32:53] it's like i just saw it in my head i was
[2:32:56] just i wasn't thinking about it at all
[2:32:57] all of a sudden i just saw
[2:32:59] this idea and this is where the sermon
[2:33:03] comes from
[2:33:05] and i i don't know i just i guess i tell
[2:33:06] on myself all the time because
[2:33:08] at least then i know it's real i'm not
[2:33:11] preaching theory
[2:33:12] i believe this i absolutely believe this
[2:33:14] with every
[2:33:15] every ounce of my being i believe this
[2:33:20] the key is to aim through the mark
[2:33:25] not to the mark is to have
[2:33:29] this continued velocity
[2:33:32] of and and it's exactly what we're just
[2:33:34] talking about of god
[2:33:37] i'm not just going to do enough to get
[2:33:39] here
[2:33:41] i'm not just going to do enough to kind
[2:33:43] of sort of make it
[2:33:44] i'm not going to just slide by into the
[2:33:48] gates of the kingdom of god
[2:33:50] i'm not going to do that i'm going to
[2:33:52] blast through that target
[2:33:54] i'm going to bl i'm going to blast
[2:33:56] through that target there's not even
[2:33:57] going to be a target left by the time
[2:33:59] i'm done with this thing
[2:34:00] i'm going to blast through this target
[2:34:03] i'm gonna blast through this thing that
[2:34:05] that i'm going to put
[2:34:07] every ounce of everything i've got
[2:34:11] into this everything i've got and that
[2:34:16] is and it is the principle
[2:34:20] i keep sliding up my slides god must be
[2:34:22] trying to tell me i'm missing something
[2:34:23] or something
[2:34:25] is the principle whatever you do
[2:34:30] do it with your might with
[2:34:33] every fiber of your being
[2:34:36] for the glory of god as if he is the one
[2:34:40] calling you in you and commissioning you
[2:34:43] to do it
[2:34:44] whether it's your job your relationship
[2:34:47] doesn't matter
[2:34:48] everything for the glory of god i want
[2:34:51] to be
[2:34:51] the best employee i can possibly be
[2:34:55] for the glory of god not for myself or
[2:34:57] for my boss or anything like that
[2:34:59] i want to be the best brother or the
[2:35:02] best preacher
[2:35:03] or the best mom or the best cousin or
[2:35:06] son or doesn't matter whatever is laid
[2:35:09] upon my heart to do
[2:35:11] i want to be the best the best at it
[2:35:14] and i would call out to every one of us
[2:35:18] we reach that same point of right here
[2:35:22] right things are go we're basically
[2:35:24] there
[2:35:25] we're at the target in our relationship
[2:35:27] we're at the target
[2:35:29] in our marriage we're at the target in
[2:35:32] our
[2:35:33] career in our finances and we allow
[2:35:36] ourselves to just wander
[2:35:39] take heed any man that thinks he stands
[2:35:43] lest he fall lest
[2:35:47] he fall do it with
[2:35:50] your might every fiber of your being
[2:35:55] i am coming to last thing
[2:35:58] i think i said that 20 times i think
[2:35:59] that's that'll be my line not not i'm
[2:36:01] coming to a close it'll be
[2:36:02] last thing i'll say it 20 times last
[2:36:05] thing
[2:36:06] how there's a principle we're just going
[2:36:08] to skim through this
[2:36:09] very fast how do we give our all
[2:36:14] we're called you look at this principle
[2:36:17] laid out for the children of israel
[2:36:20] to remember remember
[2:36:24] exodus 12 they shall eat the flesh in
[2:36:26] that night roast with fire and
[2:36:28] unleavened bread
[2:36:29] with bitter herbs they shall eat it
[2:36:32] remember
[2:36:33] the bondage
[2:36:36] on purpose not dragging you back out
[2:36:40] into the world
[2:36:41] but remembering it calling it to our
[2:36:44] attention a reminder
[2:36:46] this is where i came from as a reminder
[2:36:50] because what happens is once you're out
[2:36:52] in space
[2:36:54] i'm off the ground our perception
[2:36:57] changes
[2:36:59] we have our context changes and we think
[2:37:02] we're good and that's the second reason
[2:37:05] people don't cross that threshold
[2:37:07] one is they're afraid two they think
[2:37:09] they've already arrived
[2:37:11] they think they've already arrived
[2:37:15] they were in the promised land and they
[2:37:17] stopped
[2:37:18] remembering egypt they stopped
[2:37:22] remembering
[2:37:23] the bondage that's why the bitter herbs
[2:37:25] are in there to remind them
[2:37:28] remember these feast days keep them holy
[2:37:31] to remember the bondage and remember the
[2:37:33] greatness of almighty god
[2:37:36] both remember these things and i would
[2:37:39] say
[2:37:39] today remember call to your remembrance
[2:37:43] don't forget them don't forget those
[2:37:46] things
[2:37:46] and that's not just today every day
[2:37:50] calling it to your mind to your
[2:37:52] remembrance that god
[2:37:54] as a practice as a discipline to call
[2:37:57] our attention
[2:37:59] to god our attention and and
[2:38:03] reading our bible and praying is great i
[2:38:05] believe that brother ram taught us he
[2:38:07] said
[2:38:08] if you want to get brother branham i
[2:38:10] want to get closer to jesus what do i do
[2:38:12] read your bible and pray but
[2:38:16] you look closer there's one precondition
[2:38:19] to that
[2:38:21] if i want to
[2:38:25] it starts with the craving
[2:38:28] it starts it must start
[2:38:31] the craving not just the actions those
[2:38:34] are great i believe in that
[2:38:37] but we need to come down to the place
[2:38:40] before
[2:38:40] god where we earnestly
[2:38:44] desire him we really
[2:38:48] desire him that there is a longing
[2:38:53] and we just have to have it and those
[2:38:56] things
[2:38:56] will fall into place they will
[2:39:00] absolutely they will if you want
[2:39:02] chocolate
[2:39:03] you're hungry right now because you
[2:39:05] probably are i am too
[2:39:07] you will be drawn you'll be drawn
[2:39:11] no one has to tell you you should
[2:39:13] probably go get something to eat
[2:39:15] you know and if you don't have a craving
[2:39:20] if you don't have a craving start there
[2:39:25] i want to want to what should i do
[2:39:28] help me god i want to want to
[2:39:32] musicians can go ahead and come
[2:39:35] this is your house i want
[2:39:39] to want to
[2:39:47] i'm just going to throw this in here
[2:39:48] real quick one more thing because i
[2:39:52] believe that this is important i really
[2:39:53] feel like god
[2:39:54] i laid awake last night or the night
[2:39:57] before i don't know i was thinking about
[2:39:58] this and i was thinking about this a lot
[2:39:59] and it really troubled me
[2:40:03] [Music]
[2:40:05] i've traveled a lot in phoenix right now
[2:40:08] tennessee been around the world 10
[2:40:10] different countries
[2:40:11] [Music]
[2:40:14] and i see this stopping short
[2:40:17] and it breaks my heart it breaks my
[2:40:20] heart
[2:40:21] people are in the same meetings i was in
[2:40:23] they're in the same atmosphere i was in
[2:40:26] they were in the same place and they
[2:40:29] stopped short
[2:40:31] hot why why
[2:40:35] and how to encourage you wherever you
[2:40:37] are don't stop short
[2:40:40] go on with jesus go on with christ as an
[2:40:43] individual and as a church
[2:40:45] this place this place has come really
[2:40:48] far
[2:40:49] it's come a long way through a lot of
[2:40:51] hard roads through a lot of bitter herbs
[2:40:53] this place and it's come really far
[2:40:57] it's a nice looking building we got
[2:40:59] great sound we got great musicians
[2:41:01] things are looking good don't
[2:41:05] stop don't stop
[2:41:08] this is the point just the point
[2:41:11] where god is starting to be able to use
[2:41:14] us
[2:41:16] just the point where god is starting to
[2:41:18] be able and
[2:41:19] so i encourage you and myself each one
[2:41:21] of us we're all in this
[2:41:23] god help us to not settle
[2:41:26] but like caleb
[2:41:30] to come out of egypt go through the
[2:41:32] wilderness
[2:41:33] help everyone else get their land and
[2:41:36] then
[2:41:36] take my mountain
[2:41:40] he said give me my mountain
[2:41:43] i'm more able now he's a hundred what a
[2:41:45] hundred and something years old
[2:41:47] i'm more able now to take it than i
[2:41:50] ever have been he didn't settle there
[2:41:53] was something in him that said that
[2:41:54] there was more
[2:41:56] there was more of god and no matter how
[2:41:59] far we've come with him
[2:42:03] let us like paul in philippians 3
[2:42:07] say not as though i had already attained
[2:42:13] either were already perfect but i follow
[2:42:16] after
[2:42:17] that i may apprehend for that which also
[2:42:20] i am
[2:42:21] apprehended of christ brethren i can't
[2:42:24] count myself not to have apprehended not
[2:42:27] to have hit the target
[2:42:29] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[2:42:32] things that are behind
[2:42:34] good or bad
[2:42:38] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:42:40] which are before
[2:42:42] i press towards the mark
[2:42:46] of the high calling of god
[2:42:49] in christ jesus
[2:42:55] [Music]
[2:42:58] let's just bow our heads let's go to
[2:43:00] lord in prayer this morning
[2:43:07] dear father lord we just consecrate this
[2:43:09] word to you now today lord god
[2:43:11] [Music]
[2:43:15] sorry for taking keeping people so long
[2:43:17] lord god but i just feel
[2:43:19] a sense of urgency god in my spirit that
[2:43:22] this
[2:43:22] needs to be said help us lord god father
[2:43:26] i pray to heed your spirit
[2:43:29] lord god and if there would be anyone
[2:43:32] here who
[2:43:33] is at that point may their heart be
[2:43:36] stirred lord god that they would see
[2:43:38] themselves and they wouldn't
[2:43:40] cop out they wouldn't rely on the past
[2:43:43] of the past experiences with god or
[2:43:46] their
[2:43:46] past duties or their past anything good
[2:43:49] or
[2:43:50] bad but that they might feel
[2:43:53] you calling them up higher to something
[2:43:55] more and that they would step
[2:43:56] up to that call that there's something
[2:43:59] more that you have for them more god and
[2:44:01] that it would anchor
[2:44:02] down
[2:44:05] that it would anchor down in their souls
[2:44:07] lord
[2:44:09] which is committed to your hands now
[2:44:11] father in the name of jesus christ
[2:44:24] it takes god himself in a man
[2:44:28] not what god has to say not out of god's
[2:44:31] example
[2:44:32] not god's precepts not god as a far away
[2:44:35] object of our emulation or worship
[2:44:37] it takes god himself in man
[2:44:42] and i would say once again this morning
[2:44:47] emotions won't do it singing the songs
[2:44:50] won't do it
[2:44:51] lining up with the word won't do it you
[2:44:53] must be born
[2:44:55] again you must it is a
[2:44:58] must and if you're sure that you're born
[2:45:01] of the spirit of god
[2:45:04] that you have the holy ghost and the
[2:45:06] promises of god is yours
[2:45:08] you don't care what the devil does you
[2:45:10] can still rest assured
[2:45:12] faith takes its unmovable stand
[2:45:19] it stands there nothing will move it and
[2:45:21] if you don't have that this morning
[2:45:23] it's time it's time whether it's here
[2:45:26] or on your own it doesn't really matter

[2:47:12] and be dismissed
[2:47:14] thank the lord for the word this morning
[2:47:18] thank the lord for and i think it came
[2:47:22] in such a way that
[2:47:24] we can relate to you know ariel always
[2:47:28] tell me she said papa
[2:47:30] you preach too serious
[2:47:35] she said you preach too serious you
[2:47:37] don't even make people
[2:47:39] laugh
[2:47:39] [Music]
[2:47:44] praise the lord but let me say this
[2:47:48] you know we are in such a time just like
[2:47:53] i talked about
[2:47:53] israel joining i think
[2:47:57] the message this morning relates to that
[2:47:59] almost there
[2:48:01] almost there and and what is happening
[2:48:05] is that there
[2:48:06] in israel johnny there was a generation
[2:48:10] that was born
[2:48:10] in the wilderness like i said last
[2:48:13] sunday
[2:48:15] they were born in the wilderness out of
[2:48:17] those 40 years
[2:48:18] the people that went into the promised
[2:48:20] land there were only two
[2:48:22] originally that came out of egypt it was
[2:48:24] caleb and joshua
[2:48:26] the multitude that went with caleb and
[2:48:28] joshua were the people that were born in
[2:48:30] the wilderness and we
[2:48:31] represent those people that is born in
[2:48:33] the wilderness our joshua is the holy
[2:48:36] ghost amen
[2:48:37] our joshua is the holy ghost that is
[2:48:39] going to take us into the promised land
[2:48:42] but
[2:48:46] just like brother lloyd preached
[2:48:49] and just like the word says
[2:48:52] most of the things that israel suffered
[2:48:55] was that wandering
[2:48:58] they came so close and something just
[2:49:01] made them to go back
[2:49:03] that wondering and we are in such a time
[2:49:07] we get so bold with uh
[2:49:11] we there's a crave for something
[2:49:14] new there's a crave for something more
[2:49:18] and what it is is not it's not a new
[2:49:21] church
[2:49:22] it's not a new city it's not a new
[2:49:26] and uh i mean if by choice or by
[2:49:28] leadership the law leads you somewhere
[2:49:30] else
[2:49:31] but what it is is
[2:49:35] the promise of the owl
[2:49:41] praise the lord and most especially for
[2:49:44] many of our young people our children
[2:49:47] that are born around this truth
[2:49:50] from the day we dedicate dedicated them
[2:49:53] we bring them to church
[2:49:55] and you come to church and you come to
[2:49:57] church and you come to church
[2:49:59] and sometimes it's hard for you to even
[2:50:02] tell where your journey started
[2:50:04] [Music]
[2:50:07] but you need to have a starting place
[2:50:09] [Music]
[2:50:12] you've been coming to church from the
[2:50:13] day that you were dedicated
[2:50:15] really did not mean that you have
[2:50:17] [Music]
[2:50:20] started
[2:50:24] [Music]
[2:50:28] but you know those generation that was
[2:50:29] born in the wilderness
[2:50:32] [Music]

[2:50:37] argument

[2:50:41] swallowing up
[2:50:42] all the unbelievers
[2:50:45] the witness people trying to turn back
[2:50:47] and go back to egypt
[2:50:49] when the red city is already closed so
[2:50:51] those people turning back
[2:50:52] they are just going to be drowned there
[2:50:54] is no way back

[2:50:58] again for you to go back and place
[2:50:59] whatever your desire is

[2:51:34] no matter what is your situation what
[2:51:36] you're going through
[2:51:37] the things that explain in your mind the
[2:51:40] many questions that nobody can answer
