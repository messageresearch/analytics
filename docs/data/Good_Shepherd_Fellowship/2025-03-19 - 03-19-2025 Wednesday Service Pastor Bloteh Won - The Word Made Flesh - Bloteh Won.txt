brother ju Hernandez and uh uh and his wife uh sister W that the Lord uh will also be with him now so tonight we I just want to go back to uh what we were sharing with you last week on the word may flesh I want to pick up from there but uh uh uh it was good to have brother William visiting with us and uh uh on Sunday and he was uh uh speaking on uh on the subject if uh uh don't lose your crown you know don't lose your crown uh I don't know if I'm prior personing or I'm T in the right but that was the thought that he was uh talking on and I was just sharing with him while we were uh driving together after the service and uh uh uh and i' I will have read that quote after service but because of the worship the atmosphere and the way the service ended I didn't want it to bring you out of worship to preach to you again before we go back into worship so I just thought okay I would just leave it for another time but I would love to share that with you and uh uh if uh our sister will share it with us I just want to read there before we go into what we want to we want to read tonight and it it kind of bring uh a different way that you will see uh What uh uh in the way that brother Brandon put it here tonight and uh uh you see a lot of things as uh uh as a people when we read the Bible and uh you know we read the promises we can only associate we can associate uh the bible promises of internal life and things that will happen in heaven we can only associate with things that we know on Earth so when we talk about uh wearing a crown uh uh you know we we wear the Rob and Crown you know when the battle over you know we shall wear the crown you know when when we think about that the only way we can be able to to make sense of it is to think about how we wear Crown in his life amen Paul will do the same thing when he talk about running a race he's talking about our life you know activity and the thing that we do every day he's comparing there to you know athletes that are running the race when two men is running the race you know Paul would do that we know our physical race is there I'm not running against you brother shedra neither you know running the G Sy now me but uh uh I mean we all are running to together amen we are running together and uh uh uh but that is the way we can associate it so let's let's just read this together tonight and then uh we will stand for the reading of the word he says no wonder then Paul could say with that real hope rooted and grounded in him like this m when he got down to the end of the road he said I have fought a good fight I have finished the ca I have kept the faith henceforth there is lay up for me a crown of righteousness that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day not only me but all that love his appearance amen the righteous judge will give us you know a crown of righteousness then he go along again he says when you are sick and tried and and and tired of this old life and you will love the appearing of the Lord Jesus better than you love your fool at the table or you love your wife or your children then there's a crown lay up for you not a crown a gold crown to put upon your head so you see the Crown of Life the crown of righteousness and and and all the crowns the promises of crowns in the Bible they are not a gold crown that is going to be put on our head no but you see every time we think about it we think about it that way that in heaven we all have crowns on our heads and we be walking around you know with with with Golden Crown and and white RS on our head that's the way we think about it but see the way the prophet is going to help us to understand it he said but a b free from pains amen so God is crowning you the crown of righteousness is is he's putting righteousness upon you you're going to be crowned in that way where you will be free from sin the Crown of Life is that he's going to Crown you with life that you won't die again praise the Lord amen it's not the one where you put it on your head in the morning and then in the in the night before you go to bed you take it up and put it right at your your light your your lampstand you know beside your bed and in the morning you get up and put on your head you know you you you go you brush your teeth and take bath and and then you wear your clothes then you set your crown on your head no you're going to be wearing it praise the Lord now you have to think about it this way that Crown is also associated with reward praise the Lord amen at the builded contest the reward the queen with a crown so you got to think about it this way that the word Crown is placed there to be able to give you a sense of reward are we together amen and now if you remember that we we spoke about that uh uh some time ago and uh uh we talk on uh uh uh different crowns uh rewards of crowns if you if you remember that talking about that some time ago we spoke on the rewards of crown uh you you you will see over in uh uh proverb chap 12:4 wife as crowned unto her husband he does not wear her on her on his head but he she's a crown which mean she's a she she's a reward you know she's uh the next thing that brother Brandon would say that that God will give a man after salvation is a good wife so he Crown he crowned him with a good wife are we together and uh in uh uh Philippian and also in tesalon Paul talk about a crown of rejoicing praise the Lord he crowned us with a Garment of Praise a crown of rejoicing is a life God has rewarded you it's almost like H H Sarah she named Isaac laughter amen praise the Lord because now after all the sorrow that she went through and all the waiting for this child now she can laugh you know so God Crown us with rejoicing we might be broke but we are happy amen there's a Crown of Glory and brother Brandon will say it in the in the Philadelphia Church a what is a crown he says a crown means you have a domain you are like a king if you are crown and we are sons of God when we are crowned with internal life we are crowned with internal life it's placed upon us we are wearing it not only on our head but is running through our veins are we together praise the Lord so you see when you take into context what our brother was speaking about and and and you you don't want to lose your crown because uh uh you know your the trial that you are going through there is a reward praise the Lord amen there is a reward like like Paul says the light reflection that we are going through here can never be compared to the internal reward okay so no matter what we are going through in this life is so light and he said the weight of internal reward praise the Lord so you you can just think about that you think about that I mean that's one of the thing that would make Heaven A surprising place because what we have in our mind as humans here when we get there it will be completely different praise the Lord L it was going to be completely different we found out that we were thousand miles away from what God was thinking in his mind as the heaven is higher than the earth so are his thoughts higher than ours the Lord bless you tonight let's stand on our feet and then we can go into what we want to talk about tonight I hope that was a blessing to you praise the Lord amen we got a little bit uh uh St John chapter 1 that's where we were speaking on let's read from verse 14 we read verse 14 tonight uh uh last Wednesday we read from verse 1 to verse 14 but tonight we will just read verse 14 praise the Lord St John chapter 1 verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and DED among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's pray together father Lord Jesus what a beautiful thing to behold your glory Lord how precious it is so father that right in this building we can behold Your Glory a glory father that you have put on on on people that uh Lord Jesus we been born in sin shate in iniquity but Lord God we we we are wearing your glory of righteousness that we can be called Sons and Daughters of god father we pray come bless your word tonight let something be said oh God that will strengthen our faith that will make it Lord God uh uh a reason of being here tonight we love you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen praise the Lord so I don't know what what you were planning you know uh uh uh how to decorate your crown when you get to heaven amen praise the Lord but you can think about it that way it looks like we will have seven different Crown you know you one day you wear the crown of righteousness and then you put it down then the next day you wear the crown of rejoicing you put it down then the next day you wear the crown of of of life then you put it down amen I think if I wear the crown of life I don't want to take it off amen God just want to keep living but uh uh as we continue to to enjoy the word word I want to read something tonight from uh invisible Union that's where I want to go with my continuation tonight invisible Union the prophet of God will says here and Jesus the word took my place he become me that a sinner that I might become him the word praise the Lord he become me there a sinner that I might become him the word amen let me hold truth to it not the church let me hold truth to the word amen praise the Lord he says all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated I want to read that again all that spiritual union of Christ and his church praise the Lord now you read about the marriage of the Lamb that's another subject I got I got into to think about that uh because I heard uh uh a brother was trying to present uh uh the the the marriage ceremony of the bride and and and and the groom and I think he took a cot but he uh uh uh he was trying to use that to show that the marriage takes place right after uh uh the Rapture when we meet in the air praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh I don't think I don't think that's that's the way it it actually happens because the marriage takes place year when we leave we are going on our honeymoon amen praise the lord we are we are heading out uh on our honeymoon you see just like after you do the wedding they leave every one of you standing up and then they get in their car and they just drive away and and you know go to take pictures and then uh we meet them over to the reception hall that's that's what is going to be so listen to this again oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said will happen in this day amen Jesus said in that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me amen Christ is the Myster of God reveal he says is this day amen is this day at the opening of the word hallelujah amen the word does not become flesh when we go to heaven praise the Lord the word becomes flesh while we are year the word become flesh in that invisible Union praise the Lord in that invisible Union that's the marriage of the lamb in that invisible Union Hallelujah there are some things that I want to say they are sticking on my tongue it's sticking on my tongue all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh are we together manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said will happen in this day is happening day by day it's happening how did he say it it's happening day by day so every day the word is becoming flesh it's happening day by day are we together you have to remember now it's in that invisible Union it's not in an individual practicing religion no it's in that invisible Union and what is the invisible Union Christ the word and the bride uniting together praise the Lord Christ and the the the bride Christ and the individual uniting together is the word made flesh are we together when was the first time that the word was made flesh can anybody thr it out to me when was the first time amen when was the first time that the word was made flesh in Adam in Christ the word was made flesh in its fullness and are we together amen now so you have to see that Paul I mean John is bringing this from the beginning in the beginning was the word amen he's bringing it from the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise the Lord amen so when he comes to the place and make us to know and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us that was not the first time no that was not the first time are we together that was not the first time see what uh the prophet of God who says here in the in the in spoken word is the Original Seed see what he was said he says uh that's the reason that God could work his work through Jesus he he was the predestinated son so Jesus was also predestinated just like you were predestinated amen Jesus was elected just like you were elected he was forn by the father just like we were forn by the father are we together amen so now see what he's saying here look people this is the message of the hour this is the word that is giving us for us to be transformed this is the invisible Union of the Bride praise the Lord he said that's the reason that God God could work his work through Jesus because he was predestinated so God can also work his work through a bride because the bride is predestinated God could work through Joseph because Joseph was predestinated God could work through David because David was predestinated and every time that God choose a body to work through is the word made flesh are we together praise the Lord amen all we want to leave the word may flesh only in Jesus you can do it but that's not what God is doing amen you can do it because that's the way the church teach it but that's not what God is doing are we together God could work his work through Jesus he was predestined he was the predes destinated Son of God he was the lamb Sling from the foundation of the word before a 100 billion trillion million years ago that we said Genesis 1 spoke of a while ago he was right then predestinated to take his place amen that's the reason the will of the father he did he was the word made manifest first amen the reason why he could do the will of the father not my will but your will be done praise the Lord the same way Jesus said that you can say it I can say it and his will will be done are we together because he was a predestinated son and every one of the other Sons will have the same manifestation what is that manifestation the word made flesh amen when it is God helping you to get over your temper is the word made flesh if if if the Lord helping you to to get over your greed is the word made flesh are we together if if you are not the one practicing religion but is the word that is doing it in you and every one of the other Sons will have the same manifestation and that's the ones that was predestinated amen that little group in every generation will come up in the resurrection all the way from the beginning of the word the little group in every every generation right from the beginning of the word hallelujah are we together and the reason they hold onto it even Paul spoke of it in in re in Hebrew 11 said they wander about in sheep's King and goats King and were destined to Afflicted to medit of whom this world was now waled of Amen had not nothing to eat they run about they du out persecuted they were saw aand like like aai was and many other Paul speaking of them men who was he so asand asaiah the prophet predestinated even before the foundation of the word he should have come through the womb of Eve but then he came through the womb of a woman his Spirit had to come year to be a witness are we together now listen to this now so Jesus was also came for a witness of the death burial and Resurrection are we together so what was Jesus witnessing death burier and Resurrection are we together that man will die but live again through him for he is the seed that has that has to come up amen hope you see it all right predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you amen predestinated as Jesus word if you are predestinated as Jesus was it makes the wor see flesh in you his church his word are we together praise the Lord so you see uh uh uh I mean that's that's where we are coming to you see that is the reason why uh uh you know uh we we we have been taught to to be conscious of our less we have to be conscious of where God took us from we have to be conscious of what he's doing in our life and every day the reason why we prayed and brother brandom said that was the same reason why Jesus prayed is because he was subjecting this sisting element to the spirit amen that was in Him Praise the Lord amen we are subjecting this 15 ele this 16 element this body that we have that is tempted all the time this body that we have that that that that can never be redeemed we have to subject it all the time every day every day you have to you have to realize that uh there is no sinless Perfection every day you have to fight amen there is there is there is never the time you will come to the place where I mean uh uh uh the the word is over and you lay down your sword or you lay down your spear no it it will not happen not in this life amen we start fighting right from the womb to the Grave praise the Lord right from the womb to the Grave we start we we we fight we fight our way every way every day are we together look at what he said in while we are that organized religion born again from above then we we are active active in the things from above and for his life is in you which is the word venting the word is self the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you there is no there is no clearer way to say it amen praise the Lord I know when you're born again and then you go you you you Justified and then you Sanctified and then you you filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the the Holy Ghost himself I mean we can go through all that rout but his spirit in you is the word made flesh in you praise the Lord so what are we talking about from word to flesh amen from word to flesh when he expressed himself in the beginning it was the word the logos the thought of God praise the Lord amen the spirit being of God now leaving from that form to a visible form where we can identify him are we together the word may flesh from word to flesh all between year is a process amen all between year is it's a process but from word to flesh it's almost like when Jesus Took the water from Water to Wine there is a process to make wine for you to have wine there has to be fermentation amen praise the Lord so God is taking us through the process of leaving word to flesh are we together that's the reason why you have to be patient with yourself the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit Minds the word and is active in vindicating the word that's the only reason the Holy Ghost was given is to make the word late praise the Lord amen the Holy Ghost was given to make the word live another thought here this is a Wednesday night so let's let's uh let's let's take this one from influence God can do without you he can do without me but we can do without him praise the Lord can we say Amen is that truth to you praise the Lord is that truth to you amen God can do without you he can do without me praise the Lord if I'm not yet one of these days the work of God is still going to go on praise the Lord he can do without me he can do without you but we dare not try to do without him praise the lord we need him every day can we say amen amen we need him every day we have got to have him for he is life and he alone not to know his book not to know the message not to know this or to know that or to know a Creed but to know him him is life know him as a person Christ in you the word made flesh in you praise the Lord when you say I'm it's no longer I that live it but Christ is just not an idea what you are saying to somebody is I'm the word made flesh praise the Lord I'm the word may flesh world you say that is a bold statement I mean it would be difficult for people to believe it they couldn't even believe that Jesus was the word made flesh praise the lord it's only the elit that can believe that Jesus was the word made flesh they call him Jesus the son of Joseph Jesus the son of Joseph called the Son of God praise the Lord it was a very big argument in the Reformation they just could not except that he was the son of God they did not believe he was the word made flesh are we together that that is God that is God's uh h h h uh that that is his uh uh uh uh uh uh his his his Higher Achievement you know was was to become flesh that was his Higher Achievement that was that was what his desire that's what he was Desiring if if you look here you will see that uh uh uh over and over the Lord told the children of Israel you go back you go back in in in in the in the scripture you will see here the Bible use uh the Bible use this word the word was made flesh ured amen PR praise the Lord when he told Moses to build a tabernacle what was the purpose because I want to come and dwell amen so you see all behind the Old Testament times it was this thought of God becoming flesh praise the Lord amen all behind the reason why Solomon built the Tabernacle and it said when that when everything was in its place and everything and the music and everything was right the the the glory of the Lord came down to do what to do it amen to do he not coming just to to come to come down and then go away no he's coming to do it are we to together he's coming to D so you see that is the thought that is the thought for him to dwell in US make a pinent dwelling in his people let's look at few few uh uh scripture here Leviticus 2611 quickly Leviticus 2611 praise the Lord and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not hurt you amen praise the Lord if you read uh uh uh uh Psalm chapter 68 look at Psalm chapter 68 let's look at Verse 18 if we just as we as we just want to just look a few verses tonight the Bible says Thou H has ascended on high and thou Hast LED captivity captive thou thou has received gift for many and yet for the rebellious also that the Lord might dwell among them now brother Brandon will use the scripture and let us know that was the importance of the Ascension the reason why he ascended of high was to to to to deal with uh you know H H Le to lead captivity captive to all all of the the the you know uh the the demon power the prin IP ality uh uh that was all hovering over men and he says once again to set up Jacob's laad uh I mean so sons of God can be able to run to the throne of God and and come down we can say like Jesus said the son of man which is in heaven and he's on Earth because I mean that's what the new birth brings to us amen praise the lord we we are right now we are in Heavenly places even though we are sitting right here in Ling Center in this building on humble Avenue but our spirit is lifted up in Heavenly places praise the Lord hallelujah amen and I mean if you real in the spirit tonight you can run up Jacob's Ladder and run into heaven grab something and bring it down that's the reason why all things are possible to them that believe are we together praise the Lord so you see that's that that is God's desire you know this this Holy Ghost is not just a thought it's not just a sensation it's not a good feeling praise the Lord his desire is to dwell with us amen is to dwell with us Hallelujah the word may flesh the word and that's word word it stumble people and that's where we also struggle with because the word is not taking on uh uh Celestial body one day it will take on Celestial body one day if death should hit me while I'm on this Pulpit the word is going to move me from this terrestrial body and send me over to a celestrial body is going to be the word that will do that because the word always want to be in flesh amen so the word is going to leave from this h h h a terrestrial body and move over to a Celestial body praise the Lord are we together amen but because we are in a a terrestrial body a a a a body of mistake a body of struggle with Mortal conditions you know uh uh age and sickness and different things we we we stumble at the thought of the world becoming your flesh we stumble at the thought of it are we together but that is the purpose of the word is to be made flesh listen today the the Great and Mighty conqueror then he said he came down because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of God and that logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word and when he ascended up on that glorious day of Easter he becomes not only the word but he becomes the high priest of his own word praise the Lord he becomes the high priest of his own word that's the reason why if you tell him his word he will perform it he's not the high priest of your feelings now the high priest of your thought he's the high priest of his word he ascend of high and he became the high priest of of his own word oh what a glorious thing brother Nel think of it he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word he how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask he he is the high priest of his own word The God That Make This Promise is he's the same one that we speak his promise to he's the same one that is going to fulfill his promise are we together how could we walk to him and I believe that we will receive what we ask for fall he is the word and the intercessor of the word amen he makes Advocate upon his own word are we together the lers became word and the word made flesh and the same flesh that was the word receed up into glory and now is the high priest making intercession by himself to his word that's what it takes that's the material that the church has got what a weapon there there has never been one like it he was the word and when he and when he comes he was born in the manger he come to use the weapon of love love to conquer the word amen not with with with armor bullets n with machine guns or tank but he comes in a different manner he comes in the form of love he was God's love praise the Lord hallelujah amen you see when we uh uh truth we are all we are all sinners uh H are saved by grace that's that's that is that is just truth that is our birth that's how we were all we were all born in sin sh in iniquity praise the Lord but you see the more you come to the realization that the purpose of which God brought you on the earth which he predestinated you to be in this age the more that becomes real to you is for him to inhabit your body praise the Lord amen the more that becomes real you see that thought it has a magnectic force in it the more the thought becomes real to you the more it draw you closer to God the more it takes you away from the things of the word but when the thought I'm just a sinner saved by grace amen and that is the only thing you can see of yourself just a sin not saved by grace there is no magnectic power in there to move you closer to to to righteousness all you can do cry to God for Mercy oh Lord have mercy upon me oh God forgive me I'm just a sinner saved by grace yeah you are just a sinner saved by grace but the reason why God brought a sinner saved by grace is to be able to redeem that body draw that body closer to him endure it in their body praise the Lord so we must go from siners Saved By Grace to Sons and Daughters of God predestinated to be to be able to manifest the word the the promise of God for this age are we together all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming word amen that is the spiritual union that is the invisible Union amen the invisible ible Union that is going on is the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word you see that is that is the tough thing that is in marriage that is the tough that is in marriage the two becoming one that's how that's how it takes place that's the reason why it gets hard for us it looks like we have been tried beyond measure no your flesh is becoming wor amen amen praise the Lord he might take you through the fire he might take you through the flood he might take you through great trials none of them are going to consume you the only thing they can bring out of you is the word may flesh praise the Lord you see when that when that when that Union is going on when that Union is going on that's that is some of the things that cause friction but our human mind don't understand it even in our relationship we don't understand it we take it on this person and and and we take it on that person but the reality there is that God that that that established the Institute of Marriage he allowed that Amen to be able to bring to bring forth that Oneness it's nothing about the person it's nothing about me it's nothing about you it's about what he's doing praise the Lord the moment we can look beyond that the easier the the the whatever is going on becomes for us but the thing about it is that we we are not able to look beyond our flesh praise the lord we are not able to look when the Bible says the light AFF flection we are going through h h a sickness or going through some kind of a trial if you just look beyond the flesh you will see the glory that awaits but if you cannot look beyond the flesh you will get tired I can't make it I can't take it it's all because you are you are not looking too far from your nose I can't take it it's too hard I I mean why me it's all because you're looking right here you are not looking Beyond praise the Lord amen so that's what is happening here in this spiritual union in this h h h spiritual invisible Union it's an invisible Union can you imagine it's an invisible Union and he's using invisible things to perfect Us Praise the Lord are we together all that spiritual union of Christ and his church when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh that's what is going on now when you take on the name of Jesus and you stand right in that in that uh uh uh h a pool to be baptized and you smiling and all your cheeks is up it's just like the Welling day you are smiling you know everybody looking at you you're in your white garment and and you're in your B TI is it's it's pretty praise the Lord but the union the wedding the wedding the melting the bounding starts when we get out of that place amen when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming word praise the Lord amen when the word was becoming flesh they rejected him when the word was becoming flesh they said all manner of evil against him when the flesh is becoming word the same thing will happen praise the lord we talking about rapturing material church this is rapturing material because the word has to be flesh the flesh has to be the word to get out of here this is not just joining church this is not being a good boy or a good girl this is this is burning it out now my will Lord but for your will be done you are even helping the word to identify this the the things that need to be burnt out the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word manifesting manifested Vindicated are we together praise the Lord amen are we are we ready to be the word made flesh amen are you ready for thish to be the word hallelujah it's coming from word to flesh there is a process here amen there is a process
