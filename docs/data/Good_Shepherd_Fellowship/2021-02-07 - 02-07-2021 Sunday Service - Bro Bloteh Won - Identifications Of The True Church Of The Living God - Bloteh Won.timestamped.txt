[48:42] either the grand uncle that got a text
[48:45] didn't even look at it
[48:46] before i came up here i came up here
[48:48] then it came on my mind

[50:07] represents to the church
[50:09] and represent to the family
[50:14] so he asked that we pray for her
[50:18] let's just buy our house together
[50:33] you know i was listening to brother
[50:36] branham talking about
[50:40] the woman i came before him
[50:44] before the lord jesus while he was at
[50:48] simon house
[50:51] brother branham said that she identified
[50:54] the word
[50:55] [Music]
[50:58] and she went into simon house that's
[51:00] part of a situation
[51:04] the prophet of god said it's on tape
[51:07] that when she fell at his feet and said
[51:10] oh how are they treating my lord like
[51:12] that
[51:12] it didn't even work on him didn't even
[51:15] wash his feet
[51:16] brother branham says god allow her tears
[51:20] glance
[51:21] to break enough tears for her to wash
[51:24] jesus feet
[51:26] and god allow her hair to grow
[51:29] for it to be enough that's what he said
[51:32] [Music]
[51:35] because we identify and need
[51:38] of the word so we're not coming
[51:42] because it's a need of our sister it's a
[51:45] need of the word
[51:46] because the word warned the sisters to
[51:49] treasure their head
[51:57] heavenly father lord jesus
[52:04] could have prayed in our closet
[52:07] i could have prayed with her last night
[52:09] lord but
[52:10] we bring this before the church of the
[52:12] living god
[52:14] and father we are uniting our
[52:18] simple faith oh god that you will come
[52:21] lord and
[52:23] honor your word precious lord whatever
[52:26] is the cause
[52:27] lord father we don't know lord jesus
[52:31] but father we know you know and we are
[52:34] bringing her knee to you
[52:37] father lord she won
[52:38] [Music]
[52:40] her head to stop breaking and stop
[52:43] cutting
[52:44] and father she won a new growth lord
[52:48] we should be a sign of a new life lord
[52:51] so god we just pray father that you will
[52:54] bless your daughter lord god

[52:59] faith of the church of the living god

[55:45] [Music]
[55:47] the young brother that started coming
[55:49] back to church brother glenn
[55:51] uh he too is recovering and
[55:56] spoke to brother wesley yesterday
[56:00] sister carol was down in her blood
[56:02] pressure but she's doing
[56:03] much better praise the lord so we want
[56:06] to thank the lord for that
[56:07] amen we want to thank the lord for that
[56:10] and
[56:11] thank the lord that we can be back in

[56:17] the devil he don't want us to be yet
[56:19] amen
[56:20] he don't want us to be back here but we
[56:22] want to thank god for
[56:24] giving us the privilege that we can come
[56:25] and fellowship
[56:27] around the world now and i've i've kind
[56:30] of forgot myself
[56:31] into a junction word uh
[56:35] really been asking all through the night
[56:37] where to go
[56:38] this morning i wanted to talk on the
[56:40] return of the pillow of fire
[56:43] and uh
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] to be able to address something but uh
[56:49] uh
[56:50] i thought i first had on my mind i was
[56:53] going to speak on revelation chapter
[56:55] five
[56:56] and uh to to uh
[57:01] to talk on the mediator
[57:04] uh uh uh a week uh
[57:08] i can't remember i think a week ago uh
[57:12] brother abraham myself was talking he
[57:14] asked me the question
[57:15] there on revelation chapter five
[57:17] identifying the the lion and the lamb
[57:20] we know that is one actor but where
[57:23] where
[57:23] when is he the lion and when is he the
[57:25] lamb
[57:27] as it is as it is played out there
[57:30] and uh uh so we were talking about it
[57:34] and then you know it's it's just kind of
[57:36] a conversation that leaves
[57:38] impression on your mind and you say i
[57:41] look at that
[57:41] beforehand and i think let me go and do
[57:44] a review and then you get stuck in it
[57:47] praise the lord and and so
[57:50] i got i got a beautiful picture that i
[57:53] wanted to
[57:54] to bring out this morning
[57:57] but uh
[57:59] [Music]
[58:01] then i had on my mind that i was going
[58:03] to speak on
[58:06] the return of the pillow of fire uh
[58:10] because we we realized that uh
[58:13] we have uh the the
[58:16] scientific proof of the pillar of fire
[58:18] which is the picture
[58:19] that was taking over the head of brother
[58:22] branham
[58:22] that is the scientific proof of the
[58:24] pillar of fire which of course this is
[58:26] the only age
[58:28] that has got that scientific proof but
[58:31] this is not the only age
[58:33] where the pillar of fire came praise the
[58:36] lord
[58:36] this age is the age that got the pillow
[58:39] of fire
[58:40] and even since that picture was taken
[58:43] before that picture was taking the
[58:45] pillow of fire was here
[58:46] after that picture was taking the pillow
[58:48] of fire remains here
[58:52] amen praise the lord and
[58:56] and and that's what i thought i was
[58:57] going to go into so i just been asking
[58:59] the lord
[59:00] i said father just draw me through the
[59:02] channel that you want me to go through
[59:04] amen
[59:05] because sometimes as a preacher you find
[59:07] a china you know that you are in that
[59:09] channel nothing can pull you out
[59:10] sometimes you you having
[59:14] you have a few different channels before
[59:16] you say which one should i go into
[59:18] praise the lord so that's where i am
[59:20] this morning so you have to help pull me
[59:22] into one amen
[59:24] praise the lord i might i might be going
[59:27] all over the place but
[59:28] again uh wednesday night
[59:32] we spoke on uh uh
[59:35] revelation chapter 16 uh where we
[59:39] we took a taught
[59:42] that we uh we we tied to the unveiling
[59:46] of the three unclean spirit
[59:49] and
[59:50] [Music]
[59:58] i wanted to read this to you
[1:00:03] not to confuse you
[1:00:06] or not to put questions in your mind
[1:00:11] but also to show you the progression
[1:00:16] of the ministry of jesus christ in our
[1:00:20] day
[1:00:21] the progression of brother branham
[1:00:23] ministry
[1:00:24] and also to show you uh
[1:00:28] uh that
[1:00:32] you we that's that's what that's what we
[1:00:36] have to
[1:00:37] watch that's what we are following is
[1:00:39] that progression
[1:00:40] of the ministry praise the lord
[1:00:44] so uh brother branham said this
[1:00:48] and and actually when i when i checked
[1:00:50] on taped
[1:00:51] i found that there was there were three
[1:00:53] places where he
[1:00:54] he made this phrase
[1:00:58] he said this on 1952
[1:01:02] july 13 in the morning and he also
[1:01:04] repeated it in the evening
[1:01:06] while praying he said o jehovah
[1:01:11] you who come and is standing down
[1:01:16] in the form of the pillar of fire
[1:01:19] praise the lord
[1:01:22] as the word can see
[1:01:25] it is in soul they see it
[1:01:30] there it is scientifically proven
[1:01:35] the church believe it god
[1:01:39] you speak each night and vindicate it to
[1:01:42] be
[1:01:43] vindicated the truth truly
[1:01:47] we are not much in this world
[1:01:51] we we look down upon we are looked down
[1:01:55] upon
[1:01:56] but god we believe we have
[1:01:59] accepted christ jesus
[1:02:03] and he in return has given
[1:02:06] us the holy ghost we love him
[1:02:11] that great third person
[1:02:14] of the trinity who burns through
[1:02:18] our heart and
[1:02:21] we love him can we say amen to the word
[1:02:26] if it is the word say amen to it
[1:02:30] praise the lord
[1:02:34] uh that's what i said i didn't read it
[1:02:36] to confuse you
[1:02:38] but i wanted to show you the progression
[1:02:41] of the ministry because this is the
[1:02:44] ministry of jesus christ
[1:02:47] amen it has progressed and it still
[1:02:50] progresses until we go
[1:02:51] over to the rapture and over to the
[1:02:53] millennium and then over to internet
[1:02:56] we will keep learning more of him
[1:02:59] praise the lord and in all the the the
[1:03:04] uh three quotes that brother branham
[1:03:06] mentioned this
[1:03:08] which of course i have them right before
[1:03:09] me but uh
[1:03:11] i was actually looking at this when i
[1:03:13] was planning to
[1:03:14] i mean preparing to speak on uh the
[1:03:17] return of the pillar of fire
[1:03:20] and in three of them he he mentioned uh
[1:03:24] uh you know you will standing
[1:03:27] in our midst in the form of the pillow
[1:03:29] of fire
[1:03:30] and then he gets he gets down to death
[1:03:34] the the second one is almost the same
[1:03:37] they tell one to my opinion
[1:03:38] the same pillar of fire that led the
[1:03:40] children of israel
[1:03:43] for any bible reader in here knows that
[1:03:46] that was the angel of the covenant which
[1:03:50] is which was jesus christ
[1:03:54] that's right and
[1:03:57] he was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:04:00] us said i came from god i returned back
[1:04:05] to god
[1:04:05] is that right i returned back to god
[1:04:09] watch the old testament christian
[1:04:12] or the new testament christian sorry how
[1:04:15] he lived poor
[1:04:16] vision he was he was started one
[1:04:19] uh one way got between the street in a
[1:04:22] vision
[1:04:23] come over to macedonia out here
[1:04:27] on the c-14 days and night no more no
[1:04:31] styes
[1:04:32] all hope all hope
[1:04:41] now where am i now okay all hope
[1:04:44] of uh ever being saved is gone and the
[1:04:48] angel of the lord
[1:04:49] come to him said don't fear paul
[1:04:53] you must be brought before caesar
[1:04:58] how little paul and the ship
[1:05:02] still rocking water loading log
[1:05:05] water log and everything shake in
[1:05:08] in his little hand like that and
[1:05:10] streaming
[1:05:11] be of good courage for the injured of
[1:05:14] the lords too by me
[1:05:17] this night and told me wherefore i
[1:05:19] believe
[1:05:20] god sir it will be
[1:05:23] just as what show means see
[1:05:27] the same jesus christ while paul
[1:05:31] looking upon someone preaching i
[1:05:34] perceive that you have faith
[1:05:36] to be healed ananias and and and
[1:05:39] repeated ananias and so far come true a
[1:05:41] big lie
[1:05:42] takes up peter being uh
[1:05:46] the spirit of the holy ghost on him he
[1:05:49] rebuked their sin
[1:05:50] and told and told them what they have
[1:05:53] done
[1:05:55] you see this practically the same thing
[1:05:59] the same thing night by night the holy
[1:06:02] spirit revealing surely now what he's
[1:06:05] typing here is that the same uh holy
[1:06:08] spirit that called ananias and so far
[1:06:10] out was the same spirit that was
[1:06:12] discerning the needs of the people in
[1:06:14] the meeting
[1:06:15] oh aren't you happy why we should be the
[1:06:18] most happiest people
[1:06:20] in the world that we are christian
[1:06:23] living in this dear friend don't look
[1:06:26] for
[1:06:27] anything greater
[1:06:31] praise the lord
[1:06:41] i think i'm completely reading something
[1:06:43] different
[1:06:44] than what i should be reading
[1:06:48] praise the lord yeah
[1:06:51] completely reading something different
[1:06:53] than what i should be reading to you
[1:06:55] i see why i can get there
[1:06:59] okay it was actually supposed to be dull
[1:07:01] to the heart 1958.
[1:07:06] he says uh you know what's the matter
[1:07:09] with the church
[1:07:10] it's been so cold till they have got
[1:07:14] a spiritual call and it would take more
[1:07:17] than
[1:07:18] congress to open your eyes it will take
[1:07:21] the lord of the holy spirit and the
[1:07:24] power
[1:07:24] of the resurrection of christ to take
[1:07:27] the coldness away from the church
[1:07:30] and open their eyes that they might
[1:07:33] see the presence of the lord jesus
[1:07:36] let him open your eyes he is the holy
[1:07:40] spirit
[1:07:41] the third person of the trinity here
[1:07:43] tonight
[1:07:44] to greece up your eyes
[1:07:48] with god save open your eyes
[1:07:52] praise the lord now so uh
[1:07:56] uh
[1:08:03] you know that would bring me into uh my
[1:08:07] mind uh the little story that i'll show
[1:08:10] you
[1:08:10] i mean i'll share with you wednesday
[1:08:12] night of that old preacher
[1:08:14] that trained his hearse to move on
[1:08:16] hallelujah and stop on amen
[1:08:19] you know uh it brings us to the place
[1:08:23] where
[1:08:24] you see this uh sometimes in the word
[1:08:27] and in the message
[1:08:28] it kind of stands out as is that a
[1:08:31] contradiction or what it is
[1:08:34] you know it's just like jesus said going
[1:08:36] into the word
[1:08:37] and preach the gospel you know teaching
[1:08:39] them baptizing them in the name of the
[1:08:41] father
[1:08:42] and and of the son and of the holy ghost
[1:08:44] i mean it's in the word it's in the
[1:08:46] scripture
[1:08:47] praise the lord now what uh uh
[1:08:51] makes it uh uh a contradiction
[1:08:54] is uh the way that it is interpreted
[1:08:59] praise the lord the way it is
[1:09:01] interpreted and the way that
[1:09:03] also sometimes is used now what am i
[1:09:06] saying
[1:09:07] uh i goes to say is that there are many
[1:09:11] group that claims uh uh even the jesus
[1:09:15] name group
[1:09:16] verb brandon baptism uh
[1:09:19] of the holy ghost uh the meeting that he
[1:09:21] preached between
[1:09:23] the the trinity hearings and and and the
[1:09:25] oneness
[1:09:26] trying to show that the trinity hearings
[1:09:29] were were
[1:09:30] having the wrong uh interpretation
[1:09:34] wrong understanding and even the oneness
[1:09:37] we're having even though they were
[1:09:39] baptizing in jesus name
[1:09:41] they were but for the fact that they
[1:09:43] were thinking that
[1:09:45] you know uh god is one in a sense of
[1:09:48] just
[1:09:49] just one as my one finger is standing up
[1:09:52] uh he he says that they were also going
[1:09:55] on with a wrong
[1:09:56] interpretation praise the lord
[1:10:01] amen so it is not uh i mean
[1:10:04] it is not uh how
[1:10:07] accurate that we say
[1:10:11] things praise the lord
[1:10:16] because you could read this and just
[1:10:18] think
[1:10:19] directly here that i mean brother
[1:10:22] branham is is
[1:10:23] is preaching the trinity taught
[1:10:30] i mean it is almost
[1:10:33] like uh uh like we said in the message
[1:10:36] and and and and being advised by the
[1:10:39] prophet
[1:10:39] to say what the tip says but many times
[1:10:42] you could say what the tape says and
[1:10:44] don't say what the prophet said
[1:10:50] you can see what the tips say and never
[1:10:52] say what the prophet said
[1:10:56] because we have to understand the
[1:10:58] progression
[1:11:01] that's what matters
[1:11:04] god moves
[1:11:07] amen and that is the same way he deals
[1:11:11] with us he wants us to grow
[1:11:17] we don't get saved and and then we just
[1:11:19] be static in
[1:11:21] in our i i said i believe the message
[1:11:24] and so that's all no
[1:11:25] he want us to grow
[1:11:32] praise the lord and which of course we
[1:11:34] have seen that i'm not going to
[1:11:36] go into uh
[1:11:40] i'm not going to go into a lot of those
[1:11:42] things but
[1:11:43] uh it's it's just at the place where uh
[1:11:48] you know uh is is uh
[1:11:53] well we have to pay attention let me
[1:11:54] just say that way
[1:11:57] amen we have to pay attention
[1:12:01] praise the lord so the lord bless you
[1:12:04] this morning
[1:12:04] in uh less than on our feet
[1:12:30] exeter chapter 13.
[1:12:34] i'll i'm just i'm going to trust the
[1:12:36] lord this
[1:12:37] morning as we have always done trust him
[1:12:42] and uh
[1:12:45] and have him help us
[1:12:48] praise the lord
[1:13:01] i know many of you that studied the
[1:13:04] message you're going to take note of
[1:13:05] that and you're going to go home and put
[1:13:07] up your coach
[1:13:09] and uh and says well i want to make sure
[1:13:10] that brother won't
[1:13:12] say what the prophet said and he didn't
[1:13:14] put his own thing up there amen
[1:13:18] exodus chapter 13 let's read verse 21
[1:13:22] 21 and 22
[1:13:27] exodus 13 let's read verse 21
[1:13:32] and 22 and then we can ask the lord's
[1:13:35] help
[1:13:36] and the lord went before them
[1:13:39] but the lord went before them by day
[1:13:44] in the pillow of a cloud
[1:13:49] to lead them the way and by night
[1:13:52] in the pillow of fire to give them light
[1:13:58] to go by day and night
[1:14:02] he took not away the pillow of cloud
[1:14:06] by day none the pillow of fire
[1:14:10] by night from before
[1:14:13] the people verse
[1:14:17] 22 he took not away
[1:14:20] the pillow of cloud by day
[1:14:24] and on the pillow of fire by night from
[1:14:27] before the people
[1:14:28] let us pray heavenly father lord
[1:14:31] i will just bring our house before you
[1:14:34] father
[1:14:35] lord i don't believe oh god your
[1:14:36] children came or law to hear him or
[1:14:39] discuss
[1:14:40] lord father or just the thought of a man
[1:14:45] father we have come to come in
[1:14:47] fellowship with you
[1:14:49] so dear lord we are just asking we're
[1:14:51] asking lord

[1:14:59] lord
[1:15:00] we just prayed come and take the bread
[1:15:02] of life and break it to our heart
[1:15:05] father we realize oh god we are living

[1:15:12] with skin
[1:15:13] on father we need a one of god that is
[1:15:16] so
[1:15:16] real lord father the one is tangible
[1:15:19] lord
[1:15:20] almighty god is no time or father for us
[1:15:23] to be oh god father
[1:15:25] brother branham type of those
[1:15:27] fussing over little things
[1:15:29] as as kindergarten's lord he says we
[1:15:32] need to grow up father we need to look
[1:15:35] oh god live for our heads because our
[1:15:38] redemption is drawing nine
[1:15:40] so dear lord my prayer this morning
[1:15:42] father just help me know god
[1:15:44] the lord father i would come out of
[1:15:46] myself lord god and
[1:15:48] and and just father lord you come take
[1:15:52] your word
[1:15:53] break it to your children this morning
[1:15:55] let things be
[1:15:56] said of internal value lest thing be
[1:15:58] said that will draw us closer to you
[1:16:01] thank you father that we have us in our
[1:16:03] walk with you father
[1:16:05] lord we love you we appreciate you
[1:16:08] in jesus name we pray amen
[1:16:12] amen the lord bless you you can have
[1:16:14] your seed
[1:16:15] now normally when things happen in the
[1:16:18] local church
[1:16:20] that create questions on people's mind
[1:16:23] is uh
[1:16:23] is uh is the pastor's responsibility to
[1:16:26] come
[1:16:27] out and straighten those things up amen
[1:16:30] or is his responsibility to come in
[1:16:34] and you know and enlighten the church on
[1:16:36] those things
[1:16:37] but what what is happening or what has
[1:16:39] happened over the years
[1:16:41] sometimes those things have been used to
[1:16:43] go
[1:16:44] to attack individuals to make them to
[1:16:48] feel uncomfortable
[1:16:50] now and and that's the place that you
[1:16:52] don't want to get because the holy ghost
[1:16:54] is not going to
[1:16:55] he's not going to follow your your
[1:16:57] frustrated spirit
[1:16:59] you're not going to frustrate the holy
[1:17:01] ghost amen
[1:17:04] i mean you're not going to make the holy
[1:17:06] ghost mad at god's children because you
[1:17:08] are mad
[1:17:12] praise the lord because he must instruct
[1:17:16] his children you cannot change
[1:17:19] the the the holy ghost from a comforter
[1:17:22] to become a judgment angels on his
[1:17:28] people
[1:17:30] praise the lord you can do that
[1:17:33] but yet uh and and then sometimes that
[1:17:37] is the place
[1:17:38] you know that that that we find
[1:17:40] ourselves and
[1:17:41] and when we get ourselves there we have
[1:17:44] to
[1:17:45] we have to just ask the lord to help us
[1:17:48] we have to ask the lord to speak to us
[1:17:50] you know to kind of
[1:17:52] give us grace because you don't want
[1:17:56] to put a human element into
[1:17:59] the service of the lord even though god
[1:18:02] used him
[1:18:03] but you just don't want to do it on your
[1:18:06] human emotion it's very dangerous for
[1:18:08] yourself
[1:18:08] and it's also dangerous for the people
[1:18:11] so we we kind of a struggle on that
[1:18:14] but if you realize this morning we we
[1:18:17] had to switch over
[1:18:19] from the 70-week tapes that we were
[1:18:22] playing last week
[1:18:23] to play the tape on the five
[1:18:27] identification of a truth church
[1:18:30] now brother branham
[1:18:33] brother branham he
[1:18:37] spoke on that message in 1960
[1:18:40] now this this uh this was almost
[1:18:44] 10 years after the pillar of fire came
[1:18:47] down in houston
[1:18:48] when uh when he was you know when when
[1:18:51] dr bess was trying to challenge him
[1:18:55] now brother branham said this which of
[1:18:57] course i believe you heard on tape this
[1:18:59] morning
[1:19:00] and i took a phrase from there that i
[1:19:02] wanted to use as
[1:19:04] as mine as my subject this morning
[1:19:07] he said i want to speak tonight on
[1:19:10] the five
[1:19:15] definite identification
[1:19:18] of the truth church of the living god
[1:19:23] praise the lord the five
[1:19:26] definite identification now if you
[1:19:30] believe a prophet
[1:19:31] and you are following a prophet message
[1:19:34] you have to you have to see you have to
[1:19:37] be able to pick up
[1:19:40] the the five identification if you
[1:19:42] really want to identify a truth church
[1:19:46] you got to see because he's the prophet
[1:19:50] giving us what to look for to be able to
[1:19:54] identify
[1:19:55] a true church
[1:20:00] praise the lord and and
[1:20:03] when when he deals with this he go ahead
[1:20:06] and he says the church
[1:20:08] each one of these subjects that
[1:20:12] i have chosen tonight to try to speak
[1:20:15] unto you
[1:20:17] one of eight he says what is the church
[1:20:22] who set up the church
[1:20:26] what is the message of the church
[1:20:30] how does we be how how how do we become
[1:20:33] a member of the church and
[1:20:37] can you get to heaven without being a
[1:20:40] member of faith
[1:20:41] so right there he also brings out five
[1:20:45] different things that he's dealing with
[1:20:47] in this
[1:20:48] identification
[1:20:51] he's going to bring us the five
[1:20:53] identification i'm not speaking on that
[1:20:55] this morning
[1:20:56] we will continue to play the tape you
[1:20:58] can go home and listen to it and and
[1:21:00] trust the lord to be able to pick it up
[1:21:02] but as he's dealing with this he's also
[1:21:05] breaking out
[1:21:06] bringing us bringing up to us five
[1:21:09] elements
[1:21:11] to help us really be able to identify
[1:21:15] a truth church because not because
[1:21:19] we uh uh
[1:21:24] not because we take a name of
[1:21:28] of of brother branham message you know
[1:21:31] to
[1:21:32] to title i mean to give you as the name
[1:21:34] of our church
[1:21:35] all because we have the pillar of cloud
[1:21:38] photo out there
[1:21:39] all because i mean uh we we we called
[1:21:42] brother brandon
[1:21:43] i mean there are just a lot of things uh
[1:21:45] i don't want to go into because i can go
[1:21:47] into some personal things
[1:21:49] and and share some personal testimony
[1:21:51] with you
[1:21:52] and uh and and and all of that
[1:21:56] recently that a church wrote us
[1:22:00] i think they got our our address from on
[1:22:02] the internet and they sent us an email
[1:22:05] and then i look at the email
[1:22:12] and his brother was uh
[1:22:15] was you know then and he was needing
[1:22:18] some help
[1:22:19] and and and what a view
[1:22:23] and he wrote he wrote through the church
[1:22:25] email
[1:22:26] and i saw the email then and i told
[1:22:28] about it i read it
[1:22:30] and i decided okay i just prayed about
[1:22:33] the need
[1:22:34] and i would like to know a little bit
[1:22:36] about the individual
[1:22:39] and now these days that people
[1:22:42] just feel i mean they feed part of the
[1:22:44] present world by putting everything of
[1:22:46] themselves on social media
[1:22:48] so it's easy for you to know what people
[1:22:50] are doing
[1:22:52] so i went to look for him
[1:22:56] i went to look for him a little bit and
[1:22:59] then
[1:23:01] and then when i found him you know i
[1:23:04] mean
[1:23:05] the first presentation you you see you
[1:23:07] see
[1:23:08] most of the element of the message the
[1:23:10] huffman head of christ jesus the pillow
[1:23:12] of fire picture
[1:23:13] and all of that but then when you follow
[1:23:15] on a little bit
[1:23:17] and and i mean he just he just have
[1:23:19] something completely
[1:23:20] completely different from the message
[1:23:24] you know have girls all in trousers
[1:23:26] praying rolling on the ground and
[1:23:28] ushers and all of that and and and
[1:23:32] you know and all of there so i just
[1:23:35] i just i just prayed about it
[1:23:39] and i dealt with it that that's the end
[1:23:42] of the story
[1:23:51] brother brandon went on let me let me go
[1:23:53] ahead and appreciate in the place that i
[1:23:57] don't want to be
[1:23:59] now the first place the word church
[1:24:01] itself means they're called out
[1:24:04] now israel was not the church of god
[1:24:09] as long as they were in egypt they were
[1:24:13] the people of god
[1:24:15] and and when and when and then
[1:24:18] when god called them out of egypt they
[1:24:21] become the church of god
[1:24:23] because they were the call out
[1:24:27] now that still remains the same
[1:24:30] today the word church means the call out
[1:24:35] those that have been caught are
[1:24:37] separated
[1:24:38] made different i'll move on a little bit
[1:24:40] now in the old testament
[1:24:44] the known church was called the kingdom
[1:24:48] of god
[1:24:49] the kingdom of god you look there in the
[1:24:52] book of exeter
[1:24:53] god told moses that he wanted to deal
[1:24:56] with the people
[1:24:57] as a kingdom amen that's the reason why
[1:25:00] he kept them together he gave them laws
[1:25:02] that we keep them together
[1:25:04] that the sabbath and everything they had
[1:25:06] to observe
[1:25:07] the ordinance of god together that's
[1:25:10] that's the way a kingdom runs
[1:25:12] praise the lord a kingdom does not have
[1:25:15] two
[1:25:15] it's not a two-party system no there is
[1:25:18] one king
[1:25:18] and everybody is honored that king
[1:25:20] praise the lord
[1:25:21] now so verb says in the old testament
[1:25:25] the old testament brought us a shadow of
[1:25:28] what the church was supposed to be
[1:25:30] in in in a kingdom now in the new
[1:25:33] testament
[1:25:34] uh we we will read about it a little bit
[1:25:36] but but yeri said that you have you have
[1:25:39] to you have to also understand it
[1:25:41] as the church or as god
[1:25:44] dare with israel and and are
[1:25:47] all not a type of a kingdom now in the
[1:25:51] kingdom
[1:25:52] even though there are different uh uh
[1:25:55] uh uh families you know that live in a
[1:25:58] kingdom
[1:25:59] but a kingdom one of the success
[1:26:02] of a kingdom is that the way it is
[1:26:05] governed
[1:26:05] is almost governed as a family
[1:26:10] praise the lord because everybody in the
[1:26:13] kingdom
[1:26:15] trace some lineage to the king
[1:26:20] praise the lord the the trace
[1:26:23] some way in their family how that king
[1:26:26] is related to them
[1:26:30] because remember the king is not voted
[1:26:34] in the king
[1:26:37] he he he gets on the throne by a
[1:26:39] birthright
[1:26:43] so may even if he's from a different
[1:26:46] family
[1:26:47] but that family has a relation to every
[1:26:50] tribe
[1:26:52] in the kingdom so that's the reason why
[1:26:56] they they don't rebel against the king
[1:26:59] they
[1:27:00] they take the king as part of their own
[1:27:04] there is a way that he is related to all
[1:27:07] the tribes
[1:27:09] are we together god told
[1:27:12] true jacob he told israel
[1:27:15] the scepter would come out of judah
[1:27:19] but judah was a brother of the other 12
[1:27:22] tribes
[1:27:23] so if a king come out of judah he's
[1:27:26] still the king
[1:27:27] of all the 12 tribes
[1:27:31] because they can trace themselves back
[1:27:33] to their grandfather which is ruby
[1:27:36] all uh uh uh joseph all
[1:27:39] you know uh uh uh the rest of the songs
[1:27:42] and they will realize that he was a
[1:27:45] brother to judah
[1:27:49] so just like how the old testament
[1:27:52] church
[1:27:53] succeeded on on a type now
[1:27:57] succeeded in a way of a kingdom
[1:28:00] the success of the new testament church
[1:28:04] is a family paul brings that out in the
[1:28:06] book of ephesians we'll look at that a
[1:28:08] little bit
[1:28:10] the success of the new testament church
[1:28:12] is a family
[1:28:14] praise the lord that's the reason why we
[1:28:17] are all called to one birth
[1:28:19] which is the new birth to be born again
[1:28:22] and to be born in christ
[1:28:25] are we together praise the lord
[1:28:29] so i just i wanted to lay this down a
[1:28:31] little bit because we
[1:28:32] will look at something here he says here
[1:28:35] as we go along
[1:28:36] now in the old testament
[1:28:39] the known church was called the kingdom
[1:28:41] of god
[1:28:44] god's kingdom that's the reason why when
[1:28:46] jesus came
[1:28:47] even john the baptist when he came his
[1:28:50] message was
[1:28:51] the kingdom of heaven is ahead
[1:28:55] praise the lord when jesus came he came
[1:28:58] with that same message
[1:28:59] repent the kingdom of heaven is a hand
[1:29:03] let's go ahead now
[1:29:06] i'm i'm i'm talking this
[1:29:11] from chronologic of the bible
[1:29:15] he says here the old testament the old
[1:29:18] testament the church was called the
[1:29:19] kingdom of god
[1:29:21] in other words god is a king
[1:29:25] and the church is his domain
[1:29:28] god's kingdom old testament
[1:29:32] in the new testament is called the
[1:29:34] masonic
[1:29:36] kingdom amen
[1:29:39] oh i like that
[1:29:42] my son kingdom in other words the
[1:29:44] messiah
[1:29:45] empire that the masonic empire sorry
[1:29:48] i love that the messiah in other words
[1:29:51] the messiah empire
[1:29:52] where the messiah ruled in ring
[1:29:56] no denominational barrier or nothing
[1:30:02] amen the messiah ruled in his
[1:30:05] empire this that's
[1:30:08] the there's isn't that wonderful
[1:30:12] thinking messiah
[1:30:13] empire therefore the church is not an
[1:30:15] organization
[1:30:16] the church is not a gathering of
[1:30:20] people the church is the people of god
[1:30:23] that's being called out of the world to
[1:30:26] serve
[1:30:27] in another kingdom which is a spiritual
[1:30:30] kingdom
[1:30:32] praise the lord amen we have to
[1:30:34] understand that the church
[1:30:36] is a mystical body praise the lord
[1:30:40] but do you know that if you were just
[1:30:43] spirit and you did not have bothered we
[1:30:45] would not be able to identify you
[1:30:49] we will not be able to identify you if
[1:30:51] you if we were just spirit floating
[1:30:53] around
[1:30:57] we were all looks the same
[1:31:01] praise the lord it's bothered that gives
[1:31:04] us form
[1:31:05] and shape
[1:31:08] praise the lord amen now you can see why
[1:31:12] brother branham says cry
[1:31:14] in in the message spoken word is the
[1:31:15] original seed he said
[1:31:17] life comes through the body
[1:31:23] praise the lord i mean you can be able
[1:31:26] to you can be able to work for god you
[1:31:29] can be
[1:31:30] able to to uh uh uh
[1:31:33] uh sink and and preaching and and rest
[1:31:36] up there because
[1:31:37] you have a body you you now have an
[1:31:42] identity
[1:31:44] praise the lord even though there are
[1:31:46] many believers that are spirits
[1:31:48] you know they don't have a body that
[1:31:50] they identify with
[1:31:51] they are just they are just spirit they
[1:31:53] are floating all over they believe the
[1:31:54] message i mean
[1:31:55] they are just spirits
[1:32:00] praise the lord even though the church
[1:32:04] is a mystical body
[1:32:06] but yet we must have an identification
[1:32:09] where we can call our church
[1:32:12] where we can be able to stand with the
[1:32:14] shame of the church
[1:32:15] and also the glory of the church
[1:32:19] praise the lord
[1:32:25] that's why we have a body
[1:32:29] if we don't have a bother we will not
[1:32:30] you will not have an identification
[1:32:34] praise the lord they don't give names to
[1:32:36] spirits they call them spirits
[1:32:40] if it's evil then it's the evil spirit
[1:32:44] are we together now so brother branham
[1:32:47] says
[1:32:48] the church is the people of god that has
[1:32:51] been called out
[1:32:53] of the world to serve god in another
[1:32:55] kingdom
[1:32:57] as a child of god and as a daughter of
[1:32:59] god
[1:33:00] if you have if you if you have got a
[1:33:03] birth and you are part of this
[1:33:05] messiah empire you're part of this
[1:33:07] kingdom of god
[1:33:08] you always want to identify with the
[1:33:11] people of god
[1:33:14] praise the lord amen
[1:33:17] you can go anywhere around the world and
[1:33:20] maybe you ship over to china or you ship
[1:33:22] over to africa or different parts of the
[1:33:24] world and if you are going to be there
[1:33:26] for a period of time and you're going to
[1:33:28] live there you want to have a body you
[1:33:30] want to have
[1:33:30] an identity
[1:33:35] praise the lord you want to have a place
[1:33:38] where you can put your shoulders under
[1:33:40] the wheels and say
[1:33:41] i'm identified with this body i will
[1:33:43] support the costs
[1:33:46] amen i will bear the glory and when the
[1:33:50] shame come
[1:33:51] also we will bear the shame
[1:33:56] that's that's what a family is
[1:34:01] praise the lord are we together
[1:34:05] now when brother branham deal with this
[1:34:08] i want to take us through a little
[1:34:09] travel year
[1:34:11] so we can see something you remember
[1:34:15] he says uh uh uh samuel says the people
[1:34:19] has rejected me god says no they have
[1:34:21] not rejected you samuel
[1:34:23] i'm the one that they have rejected is
[1:34:26] that right
[1:34:27] why because israel had never had a king
[1:34:32] amen god was their king
[1:34:36] praise the lord for the mother of father
[1:34:39] it was the people
[1:34:40] that re that requested for god to speak
[1:34:43] through moses
[1:34:45] that's how a prophetic ministry was
[1:34:47] developed a man
[1:34:48] now become the mouthpiece of god
[1:34:52] amen and then god
[1:34:55] asks moses now to bring aaron and his
[1:34:58] sons
[1:34:59] so now the prophetic ministry now is
[1:35:01] calling the fightful ministry
[1:35:03] which is the priesthood and moses had to
[1:35:06] wash them moses had to dress them
[1:35:08] moses have to anoint him are we together
[1:35:12] so now israel was honored the author
[1:35:15] of prophet and priests
[1:35:19] and god was the king
[1:35:23] praise the lord now it's good for me to
[1:35:26] say this because when we get to
[1:35:27] revelation chapter 5
[1:35:29] you will understand it that the minister
[1:35:31] of jesus christ has
[1:35:33] always worked as prophet priest and king
[1:35:40] it has the old testament shadow is also
[1:35:43] fulfilled in the new testament
[1:35:47] now so the heart they had a a
[1:35:50] a prophet moses that they looked onto
[1:35:54] and they had a priesthood the aaronic
[1:35:56] priesthood there
[1:35:58] that he looked onto but now that that
[1:36:01] king
[1:36:02] that king order has never come in flesh
[1:36:05] there was never a man
[1:36:07] that was raised in the mount israel that
[1:36:08] was anointed king
[1:36:13] until the time of samuel when the people
[1:36:15] were looking at the other nation brother
[1:36:17] branham said they wanted to be
[1:36:18] like the other nation and god said
[1:36:20] samuel gift give them a
[1:36:23] praise the lord now but
[1:36:27] look at this now look at this as you
[1:36:29] look at in the scripture
[1:36:32] hundreds of years jacob
[1:36:36] honor inspiration talking to judah
[1:36:40] and he said judah the scepter will come
[1:36:42] from your limbs
[1:36:44] which means if he was speaking in the
[1:36:47] name of the lord
[1:36:49] god has already had a king in mind
[1:36:52] if jacob was prophesying for god
[1:36:56] if what he was saying was the word of
[1:36:58] god then god had a king in mind
[1:37:02] it was just now the appointed time for
[1:37:04] god to give them a king
[1:37:09] if god never wanted his people to have a
[1:37:11] king he would not prophesy
[1:37:13] that the scepter would come from judah
[1:37:18] are we together
[1:37:22] so it was just not the time now if you
[1:37:26] even look at the scripture
[1:37:27] we have spoken about that here i can i
[1:37:30] can
[1:37:30] run you through the bible there over in
[1:37:32] first king but if you look at the
[1:37:34] scripture you will realize that
[1:37:36] that is the reason why when samir
[1:37:41] over in first samuel when samuel
[1:37:45] spoke to saul and said the lord has
[1:37:49] looked upon you
[1:37:51] what the song said he said am i not a
[1:37:54] benjamite
[1:37:56] you know why he said that because the
[1:38:00] king was supposed to come from judah
[1:38:03] now why are you saying that i will be
[1:38:05] king am i not a benjamite
[1:38:08] so saul knew by the word of the lord
[1:38:12] that it was not the place for a
[1:38:14] benjamite
[1:38:15] to be king
[1:38:21] so there was a haunting feeling
[1:38:24] in his mind
[1:38:28] praise the lord and that's what the holy
[1:38:31] ghost does to the believer
[1:38:33] the holy ghost destroy every hunting
[1:38:36] feeling
[1:38:37] for god has not given us the spirit of
[1:38:40] fear
[1:38:41] but the spirit of boldness and sign mind
[1:38:46] a believer must not have a haunting
[1:38:48] feeling
[1:38:51] if you have a haunting feeling it means
[1:38:53] that there is something wrong
[1:38:55] there is a question
[1:38:59] saw her a question he had a haunted him
[1:39:02] or his ministry he knew he was out of
[1:39:06] place
[1:39:06] yes
[1:39:11] are we together he knew he was out of
[1:39:14] place
[1:39:15] because every tribe knew the blessing
[1:39:19] that was given to their tribe
[1:39:27] he said am i not a benjaminite
[1:39:33] well samuel went ahead and anointed him
[1:39:35] why
[1:39:36] because it was a choice of the people
[1:39:40] amen it was the choice of the people
[1:39:44] with god he don't need the people to
[1:39:47] choose
[1:39:48] he brings his men on the scene when it
[1:39:51] was time
[1:39:52] for a king to come out of the house of
[1:39:54] judah he said samuel
[1:39:55] go to the house of jesse
[1:40:01] are we together but follow me now
[1:40:05] now that a king please has come that
[1:40:09] office has come in flesh
[1:40:11] a prophet is in flesh a priest is in
[1:40:14] flesh
[1:40:14] now a king has been anointed among the
[1:40:17] people
[1:40:19] so we have prophet priests and king are
[1:40:22] we together
[1:40:23] praise the lord amen i say thank you
[1:40:26] jesus
[1:40:28] i will say thank you jesus
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:35] it's because i'm blessed by what i've
[1:40:37] just said
[1:40:39] it's it kind of laid a good foundation
[1:40:41] for me
[1:40:43] but let's let's go ahead here so because
[1:40:47] a king office has now been found among
[1:40:50] the people
[1:40:54] it has been found among the people
[1:41:02] god started dealing with israel we know
[1:41:04] all other things that took place there
[1:41:06] how
[1:41:07] how so he sought
[1:41:12] to uh to kill david
[1:41:16] even though he had this haunting feeling
[1:41:19] in his mind
[1:41:21] but you see i would say it this way
[1:41:24] is the influence of the pulpit
[1:41:28] is the influence of power
[1:41:34] when people have tested power
[1:41:37] verbancy without character is devilish
[1:41:41] amen when people have tasted power
[1:41:46] this this little wool stain
[1:41:51] that is here is almost like
[1:41:56] the seat that is called the presidential
[1:41:59] presidential seat
[1:42:02] amen it's just a seat
[1:42:08] that you can sit in but it's a seat of
[1:42:12] power
[1:42:17] it has a way of raising the most
[1:42:19] homeless person
[1:42:26] it's the same way with this with this
[1:42:28] sacredness brother branham called it the
[1:42:30] sacredness
[1:42:34] are we together it has a way
[1:42:37] now so here we say paul i mean saul
[1:42:40] has has he has come up in power
[1:42:44] even though there is a haunting feeling
[1:42:48] and he's seeing himself going into one
[1:42:51] arrow
[1:42:52] and another arrow and he will not even
[1:42:56] surround her now you see that is the
[1:42:59] reason why
[1:43:00] it was never a problem to jonathan
[1:43:05] when he identified the gift in david
[1:43:08] and he knew that he was from the house
[1:43:11] of judah
[1:43:12] it was never a problem jonathan did not
[1:43:15] strive with david
[1:43:17] because of the ministry he did not
[1:43:19] strive with david to kick him off the
[1:43:21] throne
[1:43:22] he realized that this man is the man
[1:43:26] even though by right
[1:43:29] i'm supposed to inherit the throne after
[1:43:31] my father
[1:43:32] but when he identified the gift
[1:43:40] but here is a a sore year
[1:43:44] having a haunting feeling having a lot
[1:43:46] of questions in his mind
[1:43:48] realizing that he's making one mistake
[1:43:50] and
[1:43:51] and and samuel came in and said so what
[1:43:53] have you done
[1:43:54] he said oh no you know because of the
[1:43:56] people and the people putting a lot of
[1:43:58] pressure on me so so i have to do this
[1:44:00] oh
[1:44:01] man sami are you not i mean so you're
[1:44:03] not supposed to do this
[1:44:07] praise the lord
[1:44:11] and then he goes from one era to another
[1:44:13] era
[1:44:14] and we see he's taking a javelin he's
[1:44:16] trying to kill
[1:44:17] david and all of that i'm talking about
[1:44:19] the type the type of the church
[1:44:21] we're running the church from the old
[1:44:22] testament now
[1:44:24] follow me a little bit now so you see
[1:44:32] here
[1:44:35] david being a young man
[1:44:42] saul went to this to his house the house
[1:44:45] of jesse
[1:44:46] anointed him to be king he was anointed
[1:44:49] to be king
[1:44:50] but he never came to power
[1:44:54] praise the lord because
[1:44:58] he was aiming cho for the throne
[1:45:04] somebody was keeping him off the troom
[1:45:06] but yet he was aiming through for the
[1:45:07] troops so
[1:45:08] god will use saw reaction to david to
[1:45:12] train david
[1:45:17] praise the lord amen
[1:45:21] he will you saw reaction saw behavior
[1:45:25] chasing david trying to trap him down
[1:45:28] he will use all of that to train david
[1:45:31] and prepare david that at 30 years
[1:45:35] he will inhabit the throne
[1:45:39] are we together amen
[1:45:43] now david become
[1:45:46] king and
[1:45:49] uh we know the story there
[1:45:54] and then after uh
[1:45:58] we saw david trying to bring the act of
[1:46:01] the covenant
[1:46:02] back he failed to consult
[1:46:05] the prophet it caused death even though
[1:46:08] he was an anointed king
[1:46:11] but you have to watch that's how the
[1:46:12] ministry of jesus
[1:46:14] works is a prophet priest and king
[1:46:17] amen the king has his work to do
[1:46:21] the priest has his work to do and the
[1:46:24] prophet has
[1:46:25] his work to do in the order of god the
[1:46:28] king is not above the prophet
[1:46:33] the prophet is the highest office in the
[1:46:35] land
[1:46:39] are we together so when david refused to
[1:46:43] consult the prophet
[1:46:44] he caused a man's life
[1:46:49] are we together now
[1:46:52] david left the throne he went by the
[1:46:56] word of death
[1:46:57] solomon took the throne and uh
[1:47:01] uh we know what happened in solomon's
[1:47:04] life and all of that he built the temple
[1:47:07] and and right there in jerusalem you
[1:47:09] know the big temple the glory of god
[1:47:11] came down and solomon went into his
[1:47:13] own life uh
[1:47:17] then we find ourselves here now
[1:47:20] in first king chapter 13. let's turn
[1:47:23] there together
[1:47:27] let's turn it together i pray that the
[1:47:30] lord
[1:47:32] will put his blessings on this amen
[1:47:36] i pray that the lord will put his
[1:47:38] blessings on this
[1:47:59] we get to first king chapter 13.
[1:48:07] praise the lord amen
[1:48:14] first king chapter 13 yes in first king
[1:48:17] chapter 13.
[1:48:18] now so we see now
[1:48:23] from solomon he gave the throne
[1:48:28] to his son rihabram when we
[1:48:32] when richie brown took the throne
[1:48:35] we realized that his paul
[1:48:38] joshua he had a very poor judgment to
[1:48:41] the people you know my father was light
[1:48:43] with you i whip you
[1:48:44] with the tilde scorpions
[1:48:48] and and and because of that the people
[1:48:51] separated for him
[1:48:52] now israel now is going to experience
[1:48:56] for the first time
[1:48:57] word the tribes are going to separate
[1:49:02] the first time on a shadow where we're
[1:49:05] going to see a denomination
[1:49:06] in the church of israel
[1:49:10] they have all been honored now remember
[1:49:14] what what uh uh
[1:49:17] exodus 13 says god
[1:49:21] never removed the pillar of fire
[1:49:27] that's how that chapter ended i read it
[1:49:30] twice
[1:49:31] to grab your attention amen
[1:49:36] now for the first time on a time these
[1:49:39] people
[1:49:40] that will honor a prophetic ministry
[1:49:42] they will always go back to what moses
[1:49:44] said they will refer back to what moses
[1:49:47] said
[1:49:47] and and now for the first time they are
[1:49:50] going to experience
[1:49:52] a denomination where two tribes will
[1:49:55] stay
[1:49:55] under judah and ten tribes will go
[1:49:59] as israel
[1:50:03] are we together amen
[1:50:06] oh yeah burt branham taught us the
[1:50:08] church
[1:50:09] god her roots from the old testament
[1:50:17] now i'm just i'm just trying to bring
[1:50:19] this to you in a time
[1:50:20] so you will realize here now so we
[1:50:24] realize
[1:50:25] the scripture says
[1:50:32] in first kings chapter 13.
[1:50:43] in first king chapter 13
[1:50:49] what we want to pick up here
[1:50:54] is word jehubrah now
[1:50:58] which was the captain of the lord host
[1:51:02] or captain of the army
[1:51:08] okay i want to i want i just want to get
[1:51:10] to the verse instead of
[1:51:11] doing a long reading year
[1:51:19] praise the lord okay let's look let's
[1:51:22] look here close
[1:51:33] sorry sorry this uh
[1:51:37] over in chapter 12.
[1:51:40] sorry it's in chapter 12. now chapter 2
[1:51:44] verse 26.
[1:51:49] or verse 25 would show us something here
[1:51:53] then jerry brown bale
[1:51:56] said him in the mount of ephraim and
[1:51:58] door there
[1:51:59] and went out from thence and built
[1:52:02] pineal
[1:52:03] and jehubram said in his heart now shall
[1:52:06] the kingdom
[1:52:08] return to the house of devin if these
[1:52:11] people
[1:52:12] go up to do sacrifice in
[1:52:15] in the house of the lord at jerusalem
[1:52:18] then shall the heart of the people
[1:52:22] turn again unto thee our lord even
[1:52:25] unto rihanna the king of judah
[1:52:29] and they shall kill me and
[1:52:32] go again to rehebron king of judah
[1:52:37] worth word upon the king took counsel
[1:52:41] and made two calves of god
[1:52:44] and said unto the people is too much
[1:52:48] for you to go up to jerusalem
[1:52:52] behold thy gods or israel which brought
[1:52:55] thee
[1:52:57] up out of the land of egypt
[1:53:00] and he set one in belter
[1:53:04] and the other in dan praise the lord
[1:53:08] and and this thing became a sin
[1:53:12] for the people went up to worship
[1:53:16] before the one even unto them
[1:53:19] and he made a house
[1:53:23] of high places and made priests of the
[1:53:26] lowest
[1:53:27] of the people wish when that
[1:53:31] they were not of the sons
[1:53:35] of levi praise the lord
[1:53:42] now this is a shadow
[1:53:46] of the trinity in the old testament
[1:53:53] this is the shadow of the birth
[1:53:58] of pagan room
[1:54:02] in the old testament
[1:54:06] are we together now follow me now
[1:54:09] so uh uh jeroboam now
[1:54:13] he was the captain
[1:54:16] the kingdom has played it two tribes
[1:54:19] they were rihabram
[1:54:21] the ten tribes are now with jehovah that
[1:54:24] one kingdom that will honor one god they
[1:54:26] were honor
[1:54:26] they had one place to worship that was
[1:54:28] in jerusalem
[1:54:31] now jehu brahm the scripture said
[1:54:33] because of fear
[1:54:34] in his heart he says if the people
[1:54:36] continue to go to jerusalem to worship
[1:54:41] the heart will be after the king of
[1:54:43] judah
[1:54:45] so now i'm going to make two places
[1:54:48] belter and dan so now israel had
[1:54:52] three places to go in washington
[1:54:57] they had dan they have belter and they
[1:55:00] had jerusalem
[1:55:06] are we together amen
[1:55:11] if they want to make an excuse they can
[1:55:14] stay right there
[1:55:15] now remember he never told the church of
[1:55:18] israel that don't go to jerusalem
[1:55:24] oh they are in the wrong no he never
[1:55:26] told him that
[1:55:28] he said it's just too much for you to be
[1:55:31] leaving from here
[1:55:32] and going all the way to jerusalem
[1:55:39] it's too much i'm going to build a place
[1:55:41] right here for you you group here you
[1:55:42] can come here
[1:55:43] and you group here you can come here it
[1:55:45] shows like a concern
[1:55:48] it shows like a clearing but this is the
[1:55:52] thing that was going to take israel hot
[1:55:54] into idolatry
[1:55:58] this is the thing that is that was going
[1:56:00] to take the heart of the people away
[1:56:02] from
[1:56:02] god
[1:56:07] praise the lord the scripture says and
[1:56:10] this thing became a
[1:56:12] scene for the people
[1:56:16] and over and over the scripture talks
[1:56:18] about the sin
[1:56:19] of jerubrah now when this was done
[1:56:25] israel was caught up in this confusion
[1:56:28] can you imagine a man and his wife
[1:56:31] arguing
[1:56:32] and the wife says i'm going to jerusalem
[1:56:34] you know
[1:56:35] for the matter of fact these men that
[1:56:37] are preached here
[1:56:38] they are now on the trap of levi
[1:56:42] they are not even qualified to be in the
[1:56:44] priesthood
[1:56:46] i'm not going down there the husband
[1:56:49] said well me i'm tired today
[1:56:50] i worked too much yesterday
[1:56:54] i'm not able to to get on no donkey to
[1:56:56] go down you want to go you and the
[1:56:57] children you can go i will stay right
[1:56:59] here i'll go down there
[1:57:00] and make my sacrifice
[1:57:03] it started breaking homes
[1:57:08] it started stealing the heart of the
[1:57:10] people no matter
[1:57:12] if he took the same pattern
[1:57:16] that was in jerusalem he might have
[1:57:18] designed the altar the same way
[1:57:23] that there is no way you can come over
[1:57:25] to dan
[1:57:26] that you will not even miss jerusalem in
[1:57:28] your mind because he
[1:57:29] he copy everything the same
[1:57:34] you have to know what is dealing with is
[1:57:37] the heart
[1:57:41] as long as the people because god told
[1:57:44] them
[1:57:44] there is a place where i would put my
[1:57:46] name
[1:57:47] and the place that i put my name is the
[1:57:49] place i would meet the worshipers
[1:57:54] you can design the building the same
[1:57:57] praise the lord you can design the
[1:58:01] building the same
[1:58:02] dress the church just like branham
[1:58:05] tabernacle
[1:58:06] if you are not bringing the people back
[1:58:08] to the world you are taking their heart
[1:58:10] away from god
[1:58:24] and this thing started dealing with the
[1:58:26] hearts of the people
[1:58:27] now look just read the rest of the story
[1:58:32] when it got over to ahab the church
[1:58:36] married into paganism
[1:58:43] the church married into paganism
[1:58:46] that was the birth of nissan council in
[1:58:49] the bible
[1:58:54] because here is ihab
[1:58:58] an israel king marrying
[1:59:02] an idol worshiper daughter
[1:59:06] a priest it was from this very step
[1:59:11] of bringing people that have no right
[1:59:15] to make sacrifice no right to handle the
[1:59:18] word
[1:59:26] and as long as he could get the people
[1:59:27] to say amen
[1:59:30] oh israel is too much
[1:59:34] it's too much it was that now the
[1:59:36] language of korah and dayton
[1:59:38] it's too much moses is making too much
[1:59:42] of himself
[1:59:44] they come and say it's too much why
[1:59:46] should we just say brother branham said
[1:59:48] brother branham said brother branham
[1:59:49] said
[1:59:52] it's too much and by that simple
[1:59:56] statement he was able to take the hearts
[1:59:59] of the people
[2:00:00] away from god
[2:00:06] oh no no wonder that day when when when
[2:00:09] uh when jerubrah preached that message
[2:00:11] there were people
[2:00:12] amen preach it brother
[2:00:16] go ahead preach it amen
[2:00:22] and you think those priests that were
[2:00:24] put in those offices you think they were
[2:00:26] preaching something contrary
[2:00:28] no they were reading the very law of
[2:00:30] moses
[2:00:34] to be able to win the house of the
[2:00:36] people they were quoting what moses said
[2:00:40] they were trying to do everything to
[2:00:43] imitate the temple in jerusalem
[2:00:47] but now israel is caught up in confusion
[2:00:54] this sunday this family say okay let's
[2:00:55] go to that let's go to jerusalem
[2:00:58] first honey let me first on it you know
[2:00:59] first on every first sunday we can go
[2:01:01] the rest of the sunday we can stay here
[2:01:07] but all of those things were taking the
[2:01:08] hearts of the people
[2:01:10] away from god
[2:01:16] praise the lord amen amen
[2:01:20] it's not how much of an identification
[2:01:23] how much we try to copycat and try to do
[2:01:26] everything you know we try to line out
[2:01:27] our statement like brother branham we
[2:01:29] try to be high like brother branham and
[2:01:31] this that
[2:01:31] if the word is not dealing with your
[2:01:34] heart
[2:01:36] if christ the word is not dealing with
[2:01:38] your heart
[2:01:39] if the word is not changing you it's not
[2:01:42] drawing you close to god
[2:01:43] that is the thing that you must watch
[2:01:47] it's your personal relationship with god
[2:01:55] amen that's the thing you should watch
[2:02:01] it's not building the image of a man
[2:02:03] holy you know that brother he can preach
[2:02:05] i mean just like a machine gun he knows
[2:02:07] the courts he i mean he knows the
[2:02:09] message
[2:02:09] you are just building a man you are
[2:02:12] building an
[2:02:13] idol that is taking your heart from the
[2:02:16] world
[2:02:18] what is important here is the word of
[2:02:20] god dealing with your heart
[2:02:23] that's what is important it's not the
[2:02:26] man that preached
[2:02:32] it's not the kind of music that they
[2:02:33] play
[2:02:36] are you having relationship with the
[2:02:38] world yes
[2:02:42] they were doing daily sacrifice
[2:02:45] everything that they were doing in
[2:02:46] jerusalem they were doing it in down
[2:02:48] they were doing it in belter
[2:02:50] but the heart of the people was going
[2:02:53] away from the lord
[2:02:57] until when their king choose to marry
[2:03:02] a priest's daughter there was no man in
[2:03:04] israel to stand against it
[2:03:07] oh yeah it's good maybe we can win them
[2:03:09] over i mean we can we can win them over
[2:03:11] the church will become big
[2:03:14] and we see that our sauces
[2:03:18] the church will become big and i mean i
[2:03:20] mean what's that i mean we can win them
[2:03:22] over
[2:03:24] there was nobody there
[2:03:27] there was nobody in this priesthood
[2:03:31] maybe the one that was the high priest
[2:03:34] he was the one said
[2:03:37] they encouraged ahab to go ahead
[2:03:41] but it brought israel into idolatry
[2:03:44] they think that will enslave israel
[2:03:49] for their rest for the rest of their
[2:03:51] journey it will make them to lost their
[2:03:54] identity
[2:03:56] pretty soon
[2:04:01] the seminary of the prophets of baal was
[2:04:03] built
[2:04:06] amen and all of those men you know how
[2:04:10] they call it
[2:04:10] they never call it the seminary of ba
[2:04:14] they call it the school of prophets
[2:04:18] that's how they call it so they were
[2:04:20] called the sons of the prophets
[2:04:25] it was called the school of prophets if
[2:04:28] you really want to know what the prophet
[2:04:30] said go to that school
[2:04:36] praise the lord
[2:04:40] that's why that's that's where our
[2:04:41] seminary birth came from
[2:04:45] a place where man goes and argue and
[2:04:47] reason upon the word
[2:04:50] they bring their own discourse upon the
[2:04:52] world
[2:04:54] no paul said this but you know actually
[2:04:56] i call into this it's not supposed to be
[2:04:58] it was good for that time but it's not
[2:04:59] good for this time they bring all of
[2:05:01] those arguments into the world
[2:05:04] that's what seminary was birth
[2:05:13] but all of those things
[2:05:16] all of those things was taking
[2:05:20] the heart of the people away from the
[2:05:23] lord
[2:05:25] praise the lord that is the reason why
[2:05:28] my calendar showed them
[2:05:35] elijah identified what was the problem
[2:05:39] he took one stone for a tribe
[2:05:43] to show how the heart of the people
[2:05:47] has become so high against god's word
[2:05:50] they can just reason it up here but it's
[2:05:52] not going down yet
[2:05:55] why because it's not changing their
[2:05:57] lives
[2:05:59] so he took one stone for a tribe
[2:06:02] and he gathered it together listen to
[2:06:05] what he says
[2:06:07] oh lord god let it be known this day
[2:06:12] that i've done what you have said yes i
[2:06:14] have turned the heart of the people back
[2:06:18] that is the reason of the elijah
[2:06:21] ministry
[2:06:25] this elijah ministry is to deal with
[2:06:28] your heart
[2:06:29] is to turn your heart back to god not to
[2:06:32] a man
[2:06:33] not to a church
[2:06:38] that is the purpose of the elijah
[2:06:42] ministry
[2:06:44] when elijah came israel was in darkness
[2:06:47] confusion
[2:06:48] they were claiming to be the the people
[2:06:50] of god but yeah they were they were
[2:06:52] they were so caught up in this
[2:06:54] trinitarian doctrine where they don't
[2:06:55] even now have an identification
[2:06:58] that there is no way they can go back to
[2:07:00] what the early fathers believe
[2:07:05] but yet they were still cutting from the
[2:07:07] book of moses
[2:07:09] but they were gone from the principle of
[2:07:11] god
[2:07:17] can you imagine all these jewish boys
[2:07:20] going to
[2:07:21] schools of the prophets and what are
[2:07:24] they teaching them there
[2:07:27] you know all of these things our father
[2:07:29] abraham you know he was another
[2:07:30] worshiper
[2:07:31] so i mean we gotta bear with these
[2:07:32] people you know uh we can we can change
[2:07:35] them
[2:07:35] we we i mean forgetting to know
[2:07:39] that god has been dealing with him
[2:07:43] as a kingdom
[2:07:46] and the way to be able to identify one
[2:07:50] as your own
[2:07:50] you must trace him back to his breath
[2:07:52] stone
[2:07:55] out of this nation that you are bringing
[2:07:57] in can you trace them back to their
[2:07:59] breath stone
[2:08:01] because every trap in israel had a
[2:08:03] breast stone
[2:08:06] your breath stone is your identity
[2:08:13] praise the lord they forgot
[2:08:19] they are the mothers were on the breath
[2:08:22] pains
[2:08:26] and proclaim their names on the breath
[2:08:29] pains
[2:08:31] and now you would just you just bring in
[2:08:33] you know this this worshiper
[2:08:35] and and and you know
[2:08:38] why is that because the king
[2:08:41] the one that is the head of the church
[2:08:44] because the king was the one that was
[2:08:46] the
[2:08:46] the head you know the the physical head
[2:08:48] of the of the of
[2:08:50] of the kingdom
[2:08:56] you know what he started doing he
[2:08:58] started killing those prophets
[2:09:01] that would speak against him he started
[2:09:05] shutting them down
[2:09:06] so all those prophets were now hiding in
[2:09:09] their cave with their little group
[2:09:13] but they were still claiming that
[2:09:15] jehovah is their king
[2:09:23] are we together
[2:09:41] i think god caught my heart as i was
[2:09:45] looking through the scripture
[2:09:48] and as i was reading brother branham
[2:09:49] here he was bringing the old testament
[2:09:52] church in the time of the new testament
[2:09:54] church
[2:09:57] that's the very same thing that happens
[2:10:01] on the date of pentecost the pillar of
[2:10:03] fire came down
[2:10:05] the people identified god in their mess
[2:10:08] their gifts were given praise the lord
[2:10:12] god never only gave the gift to the 12
[2:10:14] apostles and say you are the people
[2:10:16] that walk with jesus now receive the
[2:10:18] holy ghost let all of these people
[2:10:20] follow you know
[2:10:21] he distributed to everyone everyone
[2:10:27] even mary the mother of jesus mary
[2:10:29] magdalene solomon
[2:10:30] all of those women that were there
[2:10:32] received the same holy ghost
[2:10:36] he never said peter now you you are the
[2:10:38] pastor receive more holy ghost than
[2:10:40] these people
[2:10:43] praise the lord they all receive the
[2:10:47] same holy ghost
[2:10:48] god coming down in the midst of the
[2:10:50] church
[2:10:52] not segregating
[2:10:56] not creating a hierarchy
[2:11:04] because that's the thing that god hates
[2:11:06] when you separate the people
[2:11:13] and you think that yeah we we are the we
[2:11:15] are the ministers
[2:11:17] we we are the elders
[2:11:20] there is nothing like that in the church
[2:11:21] of the living god
[2:11:24] there is only one b mediator
[2:11:27] between man and god and that's the main
[2:11:30] christ jesus
[2:11:35] we all are subject to this world
[2:11:39] we might as we might have gifts
[2:11:43] and offices it does not make us above
[2:11:46] the people
[2:11:48] no that was just how the nucleating
[2:11:52] doctrine came in
[2:11:54] the same way
[2:11:57] other worship came in israel church
[2:12:00] that was just how the nicolaitan spirit
[2:12:02] creeped in
[2:12:05] to this church where every one of them
[2:12:07] received the same holy ghost
[2:12:09] even peter when he went down there and
[2:12:11] preached to those gentiles in acts
[2:12:13] chapter 10
[2:12:14] and he realized he realized the same
[2:12:17] anointing that was in the upper room
[2:12:19] it's the same presence that came down in
[2:12:21] colina's house
[2:12:23] he says god he says
[2:12:26] there is no favoritism with god god is
[2:12:30] not respected of man
[2:12:32] he said he had given these gentiles the
[2:12:34] same holy ghost
[2:12:36] that he had given to us who can forbade
[2:12:40] them
[2:12:41] from water god didn't say no you know
[2:12:45] i'm going to give him a lighter
[2:12:47] experience the same holy ghost
[2:12:50] the same pillow of fire
[2:12:57] are we together
[2:13:05] now that's what brought the elijah
[2:13:06] ministries on the scene i'm going to
[2:13:08] read something to you from bert branham
[2:13:11] that's what brought the elijah ministry
[2:13:13] on the scene
[2:13:15] why because the hearts of the people
[2:13:17] were gone
[2:13:23] the hearts of the people were gone
[2:13:27] this ministry of jesus christ
[2:13:32] elijah ministry is to bring the hearts
[2:13:35] of the people
[2:13:36] back to god
[2:13:41] is to bring the hearts of the people
[2:13:44] back
[2:13:44] to god
[2:13:47] how do you know that you are in the
[2:13:49] message when god is dealing with your
[2:13:50] heart
[2:13:54] amen if god is making your heart to
[2:13:57] treasure
[2:13:58] in the message of the hour
[2:14:01] if you are taking this word ask your
[2:14:03] preeminence because where your
[2:14:05] treasure is there your heart will be
[2:14:16] are we together
[2:14:19] wednesday night we read
[2:14:23] these quotes where we were talking about
[2:14:27] how the trinity doctrine
[2:14:30] is preparing the people for the battle
[2:14:33] of america
[2:14:35] i want to go back to to
[2:14:41] i want to go back to that and just uh
[2:14:46] pick up something here that we we read
[2:14:54] praise the lord amen amen
[2:15:01] what a wonderful jesus we save amen
[2:15:04] praise the lord the lord is so good to
[2:15:07] us
[2:15:08] yes yeah he's so good to us
[2:15:13] after scene of the holy ghost we we read
[2:15:15] that on wednesday night
[2:15:18] where he talks about
[2:15:23] the places i've been how does fortune
[2:15:25] teller works
[2:15:27] how does evil spirit travel
[2:15:30] i want you to to believe me as your
[2:15:33] pastor cause
[2:15:34] you are the one i'm speaking to the
[2:15:37] devil travels
[2:15:38] in the name of father son and the holy
[2:15:40] ghost
[2:15:43] they cut feathers and everything and
[2:15:44] they throw spells on each other
[2:15:47] through the name of father son and the
[2:15:49] holy ghost
[2:15:51] praise the lord
[2:16:00] and this is the and this is the spirit
[2:16:04] that is leading the last dead church
[2:16:08] this is the anointing that the last this
[2:16:12] church is honored
[2:16:15] and as we read from revelation chapter
[2:16:17] 16
[2:16:18] how is preparing the people
[2:16:21] for the great day the great battle
[2:16:26] which is the battle of america praise
[2:16:29] the lord
[2:16:30] now saul
[2:16:34] just like we can see in time
[2:16:38] how that thing came in israel
[2:16:44] god was able to achieve to raise up a
[2:16:46] prophet
[2:16:48] moses that he spoke to mouth and ear
[2:16:53] god was able to achieve to raise up a
[2:16:56] priesthood
[2:16:59] when even the sons of a era
[2:17:02] aaron taught that it was a family thing
[2:17:06] god came down and struck them dead
[2:17:10] to kind of put an emphasis that this is
[2:17:12] my statue
[2:17:16] praise the lord god was able to raise up
[2:17:20] a king that he called a man after his
[2:17:24] own heart
[2:17:27] all of that was in shadow
[2:17:32] of the ministry of jesus christ
[2:17:38] praise the lord
[2:17:41] because there is there is three men in
[2:17:43] the bible
[2:17:45] three men in the bible that
[2:17:48] play in the role of prophet
[2:17:51] priest and king moses
[2:17:55] we know he was a prophet he was called
[2:17:57] the king
[2:17:59] of jerome
[2:18:04] praise the lord
[2:18:12] and before the priesthood office was
[2:18:15] brought in because
[2:18:16] he was the one that watched the priests
[2:18:20] and present and and presented them in in
[2:18:23] his office i can i can take a
[2:18:25] you know a bunch of scriptures and show
[2:18:26] you that and the next man
[2:18:30] in the scripture that also
[2:18:34] worked as prophet prison king was david
[2:18:39] we know that he was a king amen
[2:18:44] but we also know that david
[2:18:47] when he was running away from saul
[2:18:51] presented himself to the priests in the
[2:18:54] temple
[2:18:56] amen because the short bread
[2:19:01] was only for the priest to eat
[2:19:07] praise the lord and david
[2:19:11] was introduced into the priest's office
[2:19:14] by partaking of the shortbread
[2:19:20] and we also know that he was a prophet
[2:19:23] because he had
[2:19:24] a gift on him
[2:19:27] that we even prophesied about the
[2:19:29] messiah my god my god what have thou
[2:19:31] forsaken me
[2:19:34] and the tear man in scripture that
[2:19:37] fulfill that the prophet preaching king
[2:19:39] is our lord jesus
[2:19:44] so you see when god established that in
[2:19:47] the old testament
[2:19:50] when he established it in the old
[2:19:51] testament it was just
[2:19:53] a shadow to be able to point us over to
[2:19:56] the coming
[2:19:59] of the mosaic empire
[2:20:03] the messiah kingdom amen
[2:20:07] praise the lord and we find out that
[2:20:11] the same shadow in the old testament
[2:20:15] that would separate the people the way
[2:20:17] the enemy would come
[2:20:19] in and try to
[2:20:22] to reduce the confidence of the world
[2:20:26] to try to rob the church
[2:20:30] of her power
[2:20:33] because our power is in the world
[2:20:38] that's where our power that this this
[2:20:40] this is our
[2:20:41] our armor beg
[2:20:45] this is where the church power is
[2:20:49] praise the lord just like brother
[2:20:52] branham he says
[2:20:53] just like how the stick was in moses
[2:20:56] hands
[2:20:57] he says that's how the name of jesus is
[2:20:59] in the church of the living god
[2:21:05] he says it's fairer than egyptian knew
[2:21:07] they were just going to take that steak
[2:21:09] from moses
[2:21:13] because every time he would call a
[2:21:14] plague on israel he would stretch that
[2:21:17] stake
[2:21:20] they saw him doing it all the time that
[2:21:22] they're supposed to take the stick from
[2:21:23] him
[2:21:24] because after all the sticks swallowed
[2:21:26] the ass snake
[2:21:29] praise the lord and he says that is the
[2:21:31] same way
[2:21:32] the name of jesus christ is in the new
[2:21:36] testament church
[2:21:37] take that name away give the church
[2:21:40] titles
[2:21:41] you rob the church of its power
[2:21:45] you will make witchcraft to be
[2:21:47] comfortable
[2:21:50] amen you will make fornicators and
[2:21:53] idolaters to be comfortable but when the
[2:21:56] name of jesus stand in the church
[2:21:59] as chapter 5 has to come back on the
[2:22:01] scene
[2:22:04] the world goes out and deals with the
[2:22:06] people
[2:22:07] it conveys their heart and brings them
[2:22:10] to the altar
[2:22:20] praise the lord are we together
[2:22:26] i see you far past my time musicians you
[2:22:29] can come
[2:22:31] you can come
[2:22:34] because we can go on with this on and on
[2:22:39] praise the lord
[2:22:44] but i just wanted to show you this
[2:22:50] and increase
[2:22:53] your appetite to go home and continue to
[2:22:56] listen
[2:22:56] to that message the five identification
[2:23:00] of a true church praise the lord
[2:23:06] you cannot identify the truth church
[2:23:08] better than the prophet cain
[2:23:11] he's the word that the word comes to
[2:23:14] we we might have our ideas you know we
[2:23:17] might have our
[2:23:18] ideas we might come from different
[2:23:20] church background
[2:23:21] and think that if this church is not
[2:23:23] like my church maybe there's something
[2:23:25] wrong with it
[2:23:26] go back to the word
[2:23:30] go back to the message of the hour
[2:23:39] there are things that we can do as a
[2:23:41] local church that we think
[2:23:43] is is good for our group we must not
[2:23:46] make it a judgment or a comparison for
[2:23:48] every local church to do the same
[2:23:53] it's only good for our group

[2:36:18] sanctification has not come yet
[2:36:23] luthor was a messenger he was in the
[2:36:26] hands of god
[2:36:28] and i didn't read that to you but
[2:36:30] brother branham
[2:36:32] said it he said the pillar of fire was
[2:36:34] leading
[2:36:35] luther but do you know because
[2:36:38] justification had not come yet
[2:36:42] luther still had a smoking habit
[2:36:48] he had a pipe because sanctification has
[2:36:51] not come
[2:36:53] he was just honored the anointing of the
[2:36:56] just shall live by faith
[2:37:00] and yet the prophet of god who says and
[2:37:02] the pillar of fire was leading them
[2:37:05] [Music]

[2:37:13] sanctification revival came he said the
[2:37:17] pillow of fire

[2:37:23] and all of those lutherans that couldn't
[2:37:27] see the move of god and move on with
[2:37:29] that
