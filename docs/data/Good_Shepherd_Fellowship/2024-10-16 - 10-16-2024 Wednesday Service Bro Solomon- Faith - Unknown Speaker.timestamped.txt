[51:47] just introducing myself I want to just
[51:49] lift the word high up tonight amen by
[51:51] the grace of God just pray with me shall
[51:54] we please stand while we read the word
[52:02] if you have a Bible with
[52:04] you please turn with me to the book of
[52:11] Hebrews you have a wonderful preacher
[52:14] here many great preachers are passing by
[52:17] so I'm just here to encourage ourselves
[52:20] you know this is just food that is
[52:22] laying there with counting on the Holy
[52:24] Spirit to just take maybe a portion of
[52:25] this food heit it up and give it to his
[52:27] children tonight amen I'm just a vessel
[52:31] and so I mean as I say you have a
[52:35] wonderful preacher I'm just just to
[52:36] remind ourselves though you once know
[52:38] these things so the Apostle Peter said
[52:41] we keep in remance of these things amen
[52:44] let's turn to Hebrews chapter
[52:47] 11 is a very familiar scripture I
[52:51] Believe by the grace of God
[52:56] a very familiar
[53:01] scripture Hebrews chapter
[53:04] 11 we'll read from
[53:07] verse
[53:16] 1-6 you see
[53:19] here
[53:20] now Faith is the substance of things
[53:23] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[53:27] Seen for by it the elders obtain a good
[53:32] report through faith we understand that
[53:36] the walls were framed by the word of God
[53:40] so the things which are seen were not
[53:42] made of things which do
[53:45] appear by
[53:47] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[53:50] excellent
[53:54] sacrifice than King by which he obtained
[53:57] witness that he was
[54:01] righteous so righteousness by faith God
[54:04] testifying of his gift and by it he be
[54:08] dead yet
[54:10] speaketh by faith Enoch was translated
[54:14] that he should not see death and was not
[54:16] found because God had translated him for
[54:21] before his translation he had this
[54:24] testimony that he pleased
[54:29] God but without faith it is impossible
[54:33] to please him for he that cometh to God
[54:36] must believe that he is and that he is a
[54:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[54:42] Him may God have blessings to theing of
[54:44] his word amen please be
[54:46] seated as I would you want to talk about
[54:51] faith when I read the scripture
[54:54] praying many many top come around I we
[54:58] just want to talk living by
[55:00] faith faith as a foundation is a very
[55:03] wide
[55:05] topic fath but I want us to look at it
[55:09] by the grace of God where the Apostle
[55:11] Paul say here and what the prophet and
[55:13] the message of theah the prophet of
[55:16] these days says about faith he but
[55:18] Abraham gave us an understanding of the
[55:21] scripture a clear understanding a deeper
[55:24] understanding of the scripture
[55:27] Paul says say faith is the substance of
[55:31] things hoped
[55:32] for Hallelujah and I realize that faith
[55:36] is very important in the Christian
[55:39] Journey yes because the Bible clearly
[55:43] states that without it it is
[55:48] impossible to please
[55:50] God so if you don't have faith I don't
[55:53] have faith we cannot please him amen
[55:55] amen no way when you look at this
[55:58] chapter the men there oh this precious
[56:01] Brothers everything by Faith by Faith by
[56:05] Faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by
[56:11] faith the life that we live the
[56:13] Christian life has to be a life of Faith
[56:15] amen
[56:17] hallelujah I'm telling you my people
[56:20] even our physical
[56:22] lives Hallelujah as we are living in the
[56:25] US wherever find they say have to live
[56:27] by faith yeah amen amen how much more
[56:31] the spiritual
[56:32] one it has to be and so we see said by
[56:36] it the elders obtain a very good
[56:40] report
[56:41] hallelujah amen
[56:44] amen that is why in this end time God
[56:48] sent us a
[56:52] prophet to Resource back
[56:56] to the faith of these
[57:01] fathers because that is the only way we
[57:03] can please God that's right I remember
[57:06] the scripture said
[57:08] sometime say anything you do outside of
[57:12] faith
[57:14] is so a life that we leave we are
[57:17] encouraged to live a life of
[57:20] Faith regardless of the
[57:22] situation now we see here the Apostle
[57:27] Paul who is the first Gentile
[57:31] Messenger to the church hallelujah amen
[57:35] he laid Faith as a
[57:40] foundation hallelujah amen
[57:43] amen if you read the
[57:46] message brother bam went further to give
[57:49] us a clear definition of understanding
[57:52] of actually what is
[57:54] f and that is where I want to emphasize
[57:57] tonight by the grace of
[57:59] God brother bam said faith is a
[58:03] revelation that's just a substance it's
[58:05] a revelation of the will of God
[58:09] am hallelujah amen
[58:13] amen I
[58:15] remember and not a revelation of who
[58:17] Christ is for this hour hallelujah amen
[58:23] remember one time Hallelujah so we see
[58:26] that what a revelation that is very
[58:30] important in the seven Church age
[58:33] prophet of God
[58:35] said he say the importance of a
[58:40] revelation to a True
[58:43] Believer by the spirit the Revelation by
[58:46] the spirit to a True Believer can never
[58:48] be
[58:50] overemphasized in other words that
[58:52] Revelation is
[58:54] fa and that is the only way we can
[58:57] please God
[58:59] hallelujah amen and amen oh I pray that
[59:03] the Lord will help me tonight Hallelujah
[59:06] the Bible say for without it it is
[59:10] impossible to please
[59:13] him one time the Lord Jesus Christ when
[59:17] God was here in the
[59:19] flesh he was
[59:21] living
[59:23] with his disciples
[59:26] he walked with
[59:28] them they fish
[59:31] together they live I mean they were
[59:34] together hallelujah amen amen one day he
[59:39] turned
[59:41] around and ask them this very important
[59:45] question who do men say that I
[59:54] am read the Bible
[59:57] some say you are Elijah some say you are
[1:00:00] Jeremiah some say you are this some say
[1:00:03] he never
[1:00:04] denied hallelujah amen but he turned
[1:00:09] around and father asked him who do you
[1:00:12] say Amen this a personal question
[1:00:16] hallelujah
[1:00:18] amen yes this is what they
[1:00:22] said but who do you say Amen
[1:00:27] amen it sounds
[1:00:29] naive it sounds
[1:00:32] funny they work together they live
[1:00:34] together they work together and you tell
[1:00:36] me who do you say that I
[1:00:40] am
[1:00:42] hallelujah
[1:00:44] amen sometimes it's very easy to say oh
[1:00:46] the Bible say the pastor say my friend
[1:00:48] said brother bam
[1:00:51] say the prophet said the prophet said
[1:00:53] but who do you
[1:00:54] see amen this
[1:00:57] messages that's right brother
[1:00:59] come come on praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:01:04] hallelujah I believe there was silence
[1:01:07] Amen in the
[1:01:12] room this one will be tur to this one
[1:01:27] Hallelujah the whole place was
[1:01:30] quiet
[1:01:32] hallelujah
[1:01:34] amen oh
[1:01:36] my what a divine
[1:01:39] revelation
[1:01:42] hallelujah
[1:01:45] amen say thou the Christ the son of the
[1:01:49] Living God Amen
[1:01:56] then Jesus looked at him he realized it
[1:01:59] was not Peter by
[1:02:01] himself it was not his effort it was not
[1:02:05] how much he studied yes not how much he
[1:02:08] fasted and
[1:02:09] prayed it was not because he was
[1:02:12] sincere it was not flesh and blood but
[1:02:15] by God hallelujah amen that's right so
[1:02:19] Revelation is
[1:02:21] divine that ration is not by Flesh and
[1:02:24] Blood because God is has always be
[1:02:29] hiding God is always he in that vessel
[1:02:32] that man that flesh that Carpenter son
[1:02:35] according to them That Man From
[1:02:37] Galilee say who do you say that I am how
[1:02:39] could he have
[1:02:41] known it has to be from Divine yes
[1:02:44] praise the Lord
[1:02:46] hallelujah
[1:02:50] amen Jesus Christ look at
[1:02:53] Peter and said
[1:02:57] and you know these things we are just
[1:02:59] reching
[1:03:01] them he said Upon This
[1:03:06] Rock I will build my
[1:03:10] church and the gates of
[1:03:13] hell not one Gat
[1:03:17] gates gates of fornication adultery
[1:03:21] false Doctrine lying slothfulness
[1:03:24] weaknesses shot Prevail
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:28] am
[1:03:31] amen how can I begin to
[1:03:34] realize brother said he could not build
[1:03:37] his no God canot build his church Upon A
[1:03:39] man no no no no upon the revelation of
[1:03:44] who he Christ
[1:03:46] is that's
[1:03:48] right when he builds a church imagine if
[1:03:52] God you
[1:03:53] know if God could build a
[1:03:56] Church his church upon Revelation then
[1:04:00] you would you you imagine how strong is
[1:04:02] revelation how powerful is revelation
[1:04:05] because the foundation of everything is
[1:04:08] very important amen amen amen it matters
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:18] hallelujah amen it Upon This
[1:04:21] Rock I went to the scriptures of reading
[1:04:23] the Old Testament when they building
[1:04:25] houses you realize they build on rocks
[1:04:29] the house you read the Bible time will
[1:04:31] fail because of time I'm a little bit of
[1:04:33] teaching but because of time I could not
[1:04:35] go into some of these things and then
[1:04:37] you realize that is it's built upon Rock
[1:04:42] so Jesus Christ said upon this I will
[1:04:44] build my church and the gates of hell oh
[1:04:47] my
[1:04:48] Hallelujah I don't care how the gates
[1:04:51] could be they will not Prevail against
[1:04:54] that church that is buil upon the
[1:05:01] Revelation that is why brother said the

[1:12:48] for it was founded upon
[1:12:52] rock that is the only thing that will
[1:12:54] surviv
[1:12:56] man that is the only foundation that is
[1:12:59] why a lot of people today realize that
[1:13:02] because the foundation is not
[1:13:04] solid why do you come to the message
[1:13:06] because my friend just because my friend
[1:13:08] invited me because I was looking for an
[1:13:11] opportunity um I want to survive so your
[1:13:15] that Foundation is wrong want to please

[1:13:36] solid oh
[1:13:38] my
[1:13:41] great and then but the Bible say I have
[1:13:44] seen back home I have seen very there is
[1:13:48] a building two big buildings that have
[1:13:50] been built and
[1:13:53] spent mightly spent on it but they
[1:13:56] realize it becomes uninhabited nobody
[1:13:59] could go into the
[1:14:01] house why very big build in the center
[1:14:03] of the city which could have given money
[1:14:07] to the owner said nobody should go in
[1:14:10] there why the foundation was not built
[1:14:13] to take to carry maybe a four story
[1:14:16] building it's condemned will be passing
[1:14:18] what you know in cre say what happened
[1:14:21] to this

[1:14:30] foundation is not prepared it's not
[1:14:34] designed to carry nobody in why the
[1:14:37] foundation so Foundation is very
[1:14:40] important in the physical Liv Foundation
[1:14:41] is about spiritual
[1:14:45] lives we must be sure of our foundation
[1:14:48] am make sure for election and our
[1:14:50] calling amen

[1:14:59] Jesus Christ is buil the foundation is
[1:15:01] Faith to carry
[1:15:04] all he very important oh
[1:15:08] my
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:11] amen please bear with me that is how I
[1:15:14] preach I take my time
[1:15:19] Hallelujah so the foolish man the bible
[1:15:22] say that man is a foolish man he was he
[1:15:25] he didn't want to suffer everything just
[1:15:28] easy for me just you
[1:15:29] know if you if you are building on a
[1:15:32] rock F town is a very rocky place
[1:15:34] sometimes when you go when you drill
[1:15:36] down you meet a rock I remember there
[1:15:38] were build a build the center of town
[1:15:40] because we have many rocks around it
[1:15:43] took two years to just excavate every
[1:15:46] time you see drilling machine because
[1:15:47] they want to plant the building there
[1:15:48] because there is a
[1:15:51] rock it took time
[1:15:56] come this message make sure that your
[1:15:57] foundation is
[1:15:58] solid why are you
[1:16:04] here it will take time pray seek the
[1:16:06] face of the Lord make sure don't
[1:16:11] assume it is God that does the work amen
[1:16:15] it is by the grace of God yes
[1:16:19] Hallelujah and so
[1:16:27] brother say in the message he said the
[1:16:28] church is built upon the foundation of
[1:16:31] the revelation of the
[1:16:32] word Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the Gat
[1:16:36] of Hell shall not Prevail against it
[1:16:39] amen in the St of a perfect
[1:16:42] man say notice you must be born again
[1:16:45] when you are born again you can't be
[1:16:47] born again without having
[1:16:49] faith statue of a perfect man paragraph
[1:16:52] 102 you can't be born again without
[1:16:55] having faith so you see when a man is
[1:16:58] born again he has
[1:17:01] Faith Romans said the just shall live by
[1:17:08] faith zerance yeah much the just shall
[1:17:13] live by
[1:17:19] faith sometimes you have faith as a
[1:17:21] seed
[1:17:23] Hallelujah like a that
[1:17:26] se you are different different type of
[1:17:29] Faith do you know that yes so Faith as a
[1:17:35] gift somebody can have a gift of faith
[1:17:37] it does
[1:17:38] things yes according to the scripture
[1:17:40] scripture now yes cast out so you can
[1:17:44] even have faith to move mountains not
[1:17:45] that that's not the type of faith that
[1:17:46] God has came to restore in this end time
[1:17:49] it is the entire word the SE
[1:17:51] fith the entire Faith which is the word
[1:17:55] Christ yeah Jesus
[1:17:58] Christ he turn the hearts of the
[1:18:00] children back to the faith yeah the
[1:18:04] faith of the
[1:18:05] fathers oh my Hallelujah
[1:18:11] aen brother said in the message Christ
[1:18:14] is the mystery of God revealed he had
[1:18:15] three male purpose three full purpose we
[1:18:18] we know them I mean don't doubt our
[1:18:21] pastor Hallelujah a great teacher three
[1:18:25] full
[1:18:26] purpose one to reveal
[1:18:29] himself Revelation is very important too
[1:18:32] why is the First full purpose when you
[1:18:34] come to him that's the first want to
[1:18:35] reveal himself because he has always
[1:18:37] been
[1:18:38] hidden throughout the ages from the Old
[1:18:40] Testament to the even when he came so in
[1:18:43] this end time he has to reveal himself
[1:18:45] to you amen so that is the first thing
[1:18:48] that God then then he has preeminence in
[1:18:50] you then to restore take us back to that
[1:18:53] restored
[1:18:55] that's right praise the Lord there is
[1:18:58] power in Revelation
[1:19:02] amen I'm telling
[1:19:07] you so what God
[1:19:10] does when you know a man who he is you
[1:19:13] know how to serve him that is a
[1:19:16] principle of God so when you know who
[1:19:17] actually God is then you know how to
[1:19:20] worship Him amen our sacrifices our
[1:19:25] worship our services to God is a measure
[1:19:29] of the revelation of God that we have
[1:19:33] him amen you are here tonight because
[1:19:36] you have a revelation of the word to be
[1:19:39] here you know what it
[1:19:41] means to even lose maybe two or three
[1:19:43] hours job your hours for the few dollars
[1:19:47] that will pass away to come to church
[1:19:50] and feed upon the word of God Amen it
[1:19:53] takes a revelation
[1:19:55] amen and that it's not flesh and blood
[1:19:57] it's not the pastor that will tell you
[1:19:59] come come
[1:20:01] no anything that you do in the church
[1:20:03] has to be by
[1:20:05] Revelation even your giving your
[1:20:07] offerings that have to be
[1:20:09] Revelation Hallelujah if you don't give
[1:20:11] it a revelation there is no blessing yes
[1:20:14] amen but you only have a revelation
[1:20:17] depending upon the knowledge of what you
[1:20:19] have so that is why the first thing that
[1:20:21] God does he reveals himself to his
[1:20:23] children the first thing Moses was born
[1:20:27] a prophet he was born to
[1:20:31] deliver but God had to reveal himself to
[1:20:34] him because he's going to declare a God
[1:20:36] that he should
[1:20:39] know amen amen in Exodus chapter
[1:20:44] 3 he had been in Egypt for all his wife
[1:20:49] science he knows all the great
[1:20:51] things full of knowledge
[1:20:54] yeah full of oh full of
[1:20:59] knowledge and
[1:21:01] then God said this I need to reveal
[1:21:03] myself to him you can see go and read
[1:21:06] the scripture you see the encounter
[1:21:07] between Moses and
[1:21:11] God see to tell you Revelation is very
[1:21:14] important in Exodus chapter 3 verse six
[1:21:19] just project it let's see what let's
[1:21:21] just see the account there
[1:21:26] hallelujah oh brother the revelation of
[1:21:29] he said the importance of a revelation
[1:21:31] say more he said I am the god of thy
[1:21:34] father what is God is introducing
[1:21:37] himself listen carefully the god of
[1:21:40] Abraham now let's look here from Moses
[1:21:43] to Abraham is a bit
[1:21:46] far maybe Moses heard about Abraham but
[1:21:50] he doesn't know who Abraham was yes the
[1:21:52] god of Isaac he still making himself
[1:21:55] known maybe if he doesn't know Abraham
[1:21:57] he might know Isaac and the god of
[1:22:02] Jacob from Jacob now is very close this
[1:22:06] is the grandfather of Moses called Levi
[1:22:11] yeah so oh that is the
[1:22:15] god why because there is power in
[1:22:21] Revelation time will fail you have many
[1:22:24] things
[1:22:25] the first encounter God has with a man
[1:22:27] is to show himself to that person
[1:22:29] because there is power in
[1:22:30] Revelation amen I remember I was told a
[1:22:34] story I always like
[1:22:35] to share that story back home of a
[1:22:40] little
[1:22:42] boy who has in America I see people they
[1:22:45] have they have a lot of dogs some of
[1:22:48] them they are like beer some like Lion
[1:22:51] you know I mean different different
[1:22:53] breeds of of of of this pets well
[1:22:56] treated this little boy has his little
[1:23:00] dog it CAU missing in a
[1:23:04] village it went into the
[1:23:06] forest he's used to this dog he's glue
[1:23:10] to this dog perhaps maybe maybe black or
[1:23:13] whatever the name might be you know your
[1:23:14] names that you can give to
[1:23:16] dogs I said this dog got
[1:23:20] missing the boy was going around the
[1:23:23] forest looking for Bingo maybe Bingo or
[1:23:26] black whatever the
[1:23:28] name looking for it in the nearby
[1:23:32] forest and he went he met a
[1:23:36] lion just like his
[1:23:40] dog the little boy innocent he never
[1:23:43] knew it was a
[1:23:45] lion the lion saw the boy that this boy
[1:23:49] is
[1:23:50] innocent he took a rope a chain he put
[1:23:53] it by the neck okay I'll be looking for
[1:23:55] you come you go come let's
[1:24:00] go I look at say you don't know
[1:24:04] me if you know me you not treat me this
[1:24:09] way and so they were going he said those
[1:24:12] who know me if they see me he will
[1:24:19] see and he dragged it was coming Bingo
[1:24:22] Bingo Bingo let's go by the time he ENT
[1:24:24] The
[1:24:25] Village there was shouting everybody was
[1:24:28] running away hter and
[1:24:30] SC say I told you you don't know me
[1:24:33] those who know me have reacted what is
[1:24:35] that we are talking about Revelation
[1:24:38] when you know a man you know how to
[1:24:39] treat him when you know a woman you know
[1:24:41] how to treat him if you know God you
[1:24:43] know how to worship
[1:24:50] him so that is why the first thing we
[1:24:53] come
[1:24:54] when you come to God God what God
[1:24:57] reveals himself to
[1:25:00] youen with all the supernatural Apostle
[1:25:03] the wonderful things that many people
[1:25:05] come around the message they don't know
[1:25:07] God they don't know the message amen
[1:25:09] that is why they will go along the line
[1:25:11] the message is error the message is that
[1:25:13] they don't have a
[1:25:15] revelation they see all sorts of things
[1:25:17] they don't know that this is God in our
[1:25:19] hands amen
[1:25:21] hallelujah except God reveal himself to
[1:25:23] you
[1:25:25] look at it has to be
[1:25:26] divine so that is why brother B said the
[1:25:29] importance of the Revelation to a
[1:25:30] Believer can never be
[1:25:33] overemphasize amen amen amen time is f
[1:25:38] spent I think I should be close by
[1:25:43] 9 I'm I'm very conscious of time
[1:25:51] sir amen amen may the Lord help
[1:25:58] amen yeah say here in the Romans chapter
[1:26:03] 1 verse1 17 for there in the righteous
[1:26:06] of God is revealed from Faith to Faith
[1:26:08] as it is written the just shall live by
[1:26:10] faith and brother mom say what this what
[1:26:13] is a faith is a revelation Hallelujah in
[1:26:17] other message say a revelation of the
[1:26:19] will of
[1:26:20] God hallelujah amen Paul say faith is
[1:26:24] the substance of things to hope for the
[1:26:27] evidence of s not sin do you know that
[1:26:29] in the message Rapture because of time I
[1:26:30] try to wrap up brother said even the
[1:26:32] Rapture is a revelation yeah amen I'll
[1:26:35] read that quote before I go at least to
[1:26:38] do
[1:26:40] justice
[1:26:44] amen amen he said he said he said the
[1:26:48] just shall live by faith hallelujah amen
[1:26:52] amen amen
[1:26:55] yes yeah and uh I want us to just look
[1:26:59] at uh Colossians
[1:27:09] chapter23 faith we are talking about
[1:27:13] faith the Bible said by Faith by Faith
[1:27:15] by Faith by faith you know that was by
[1:27:17] Revelation by Revelation by Revelation
[1:27:19] by Revelation that even Enoch had a
[1:27:22] testimony that he pleased God so if you
[1:27:24] don't have a revelation it is impossible
[1:27:26] to please God if we can just substitute
[1:27:29] the words there according to the message
[1:27:32] by Faith by Revelation it is impossible
[1:27:34] to please go without without Revelation
[1:27:36] it's impossible to please
[1:27:38] God so anything that you do in the
[1:27:40] church without Revelation you're not
[1:27:42] pleasing
[1:27:43] God so we need a
[1:27:45] revelation the song that you are leading
[1:27:49] the instrument that you have a
[1:27:50] revelation you know this is it is
[1:27:53] revealed to me yes amen that's
[1:27:57] righten all the time the pastoring you
[1:28:00] pushing you brother no even to come to
[1:28:03] church you have to have a revelation of
[1:28:04] coming to church am
[1:28:08] am because without that we Cann all
[1:28:10] please
[1:28:12] him yes my friend just project for
[1:28:18] me you see by Faith by Revelation Abel
[1:28:21] offered unto God a more excellent and
[1:28:26] sacrifice than that of Kain by
[1:28:29] Revelation by Faith by Revelation so
[1:28:33] Revelation makes the
[1:28:35] difference the other guy held on to the
[1:28:38] letter Mama and Papa said it was fruit
[1:28:41] so if God is asking for sacrifice I come
[1:28:43] with
[1:28:44] fruit but Abel had a
[1:28:49] revelation maybe Adam was stealing them
[1:28:52] said my son this is what happened one
[1:28:53] day God came down in with head
[1:28:56] food but at the end he said God came in
[1:28:59] the evening he slaughtered an animal you
[1:29:02] know and he
[1:29:04] see Revelation taught him that it was
[1:29:08] blood by
[1:29:11] Revelation the other guy hel the letter
[1:29:13] the fruit five flowers five fruits to
[1:29:18] the altar what makes the difference upon
[1:29:20] the sacrifice is the
[1:29:22] Revelation amen
