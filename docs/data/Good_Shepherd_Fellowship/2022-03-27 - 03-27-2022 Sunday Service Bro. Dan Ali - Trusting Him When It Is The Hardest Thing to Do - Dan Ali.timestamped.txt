[37:32] wonderful
[37:37] god bless you saints
[37:40] god bless you musicians
[37:44] that was wonderful
[37:47] you're all warmly welcome
[37:50] to the house of god
[37:57] thank you brother johnny
[38:01] it's such a privilege
[38:05] to know that you are numbered among the
[38:08] laws despite you
[38:11] and um it's heartwarming
[38:14] when we come to the house of god
[38:16] you know we see one another
[38:19] it's a reminder that we are all fighting
[38:22] the same battle
[38:23] and that we have a common enemy
[38:26] i don't care what your brother ever does
[38:28] to you
[38:29] what your sister ever does to you that
[38:32] is not your enemy
[38:34] you should be able to resolve it
[38:37] there is nothing that can never be
[38:38] resolved
[38:40] praise be to god
[38:42] one thing
[38:44] we should always look out for to make
[38:46] sure
[38:48] that there isn't any disunity in our
[38:50] midst
[38:52] because brother brother says something
[38:55] that why there is this unity
[38:57] the spirit of god is not welcomed
[39:01] always search your heart
[39:03] make sure you are right with god
[39:06] and when we all come
[39:08] and we are under the same anointing
[39:10] under the same spirit
[39:12] there is no doubt that god is going to
[39:15] come down praise be to god
[39:18] god bless you all once again
[39:20] and happy to see you
[39:22] as brother once said last sunday he's
[39:24] traveled he's in washington dc i spoke
[39:28] to him yesterday he took the service on
[39:30] thursday he's preaching there today
[39:33] and i just saw a note

[39:44] brother joseph he's going to
[39:47] iowa

[40:10] we've had to once again gather together
[40:13] that we don't come to church
[40:16] looking across our shoulders
[40:18] to see who is coming after us
[40:20] that we have freedom of worship that we
[40:24] can worship our god anyhow anyway and we
[40:28] are not afraid

[40:49] neither are we here to hear the voice of
[40:51] a man
[40:52] we have come that we may hear from god
[40:55] and father we pray may you come down in
[40:57] a very special way
[40:58] you alone know the desires that are on
[41:01] the house of your children
[41:03] you alone know what the needs are father
[41:06] we pray this morning in the name of
[41:08] jesus that you would come and minister
[41:11] unto your children from life to ear to
[41:13] the glory of your holy name
[41:16] if there are any sense if there are any
[41:18] iniquities if there are anything five
[41:21] there is anything in our lives that
[41:23] would hinder our prayers father we pray
[41:26] and we commit them under the blood and
[41:28] we pray that you will just glorify
[41:30] yourself in our midst today we are so
[41:33] grateful

[42:30] [Music]
[42:31] as we stand can we just take our bibles
[42:34] musicians god bless you
[42:38] we are reading
[43:05] uh some
[43:07] 62.
[43:25] psalm 62
[43:29] verse 1-8
[43:33] truly my soul
[43:35] waited upon god
[43:38] from him cometh my salvation
[43:42] he alone
[43:43] no he alone is my rock
[43:46] and my salvation
[43:48] he is my defense
[43:50] i shall not be greatly
[43:52] moved how long will ye imagine mischief
[43:56] against a man
[43:58] ye shall be slain all of you
[44:01] as a bowing wall shall he be
[44:04] and as a torturing friends
[44:07] only consult to cast him down from his
[44:10] excellency their delight in lies
[44:14] they're blessed with their mouth
[44:16] but
[44:17] they cast inwardly seller
[44:20] my soul wait thou only upon god
[44:25] for my expectation is from him
[44:28] he alone is my rock
[44:30] and my salvation he is my defense
[44:34] and i shall not be moved
[44:36] in god is my salvation
[44:39] and my glory
[44:40] the rock of my strength
[44:43] and my refuge is in god verse 8
[44:47] trust in him
[44:49] all
[44:52] times
[44:54] you people pour out your hearts before
[44:58] him
[44:59] god is a refuge for us
[45:02] seller
[45:04] praise be to god
[45:06] i take verse 8 again
[45:09] trust in him
[45:11] at all times
[45:14] ye people
[45:15] pour out your hearts before him
[45:19] god is a refuge
[45:22] for us
[45:23] seller
[45:24] praise be to god shall we be seated
[45:40] once again
[45:42] i welcome you to the house of god
[45:45] the bible says where two or three are
[45:47] gathered in his name there he is
[45:50] and he is
[45:53] a promise keeper
[45:55] whatever god has said he will do
[45:58] that is what he will do
[46:00] praise be to god
[46:02] he is not a man that he should lie
[46:05] we say one thing and we do the other
[46:09] it is not same with god
[46:12] i believe we have all come to hear from
[46:14] god this morning
[46:18] if you have come to hear from god
[46:21] you would hear from god
[46:24] praise be to god
[46:28] covenant
[46:29] that angel of the covenant
[46:32] that was following brother branham
[46:34] when god took his servant away
[46:37] that angel of the covenant never went
[46:39] with him
[46:40] he is here
[46:45] when you come
[46:47] with your heart open
[46:50] to hear from god
[46:52] you will hear from god
[46:55] and if you also come to hear from a man
[46:58] you will hear from a man
[47:01] and the question is what good
[47:03] will he do you
[47:06] to get up
[47:08] dress up
[47:09] drive all that way
[47:11] to come and hear from a six foot three
[47:13] mess
[47:14] that is standing before you this morning
[47:19] i'm sorry to tell you you are
[47:20] disappointed in advance
[47:23] praise be to god
[47:25] but if you are here to hear from god
[47:28] you will certainly hear from god
[47:31] it is the reason why a lot of the times
[47:34] people get offended in the house of god
[47:37] because they come not with the intention
[47:39] of hearing from god but they come to
[47:41] hear from a man
[47:43] so even when god is speaking to you all
[47:45] you hear is the voice of a man
[47:48] and the question you ask who is he to
[47:50] talk to me that way
[47:53] but if you come to hear from god even
[47:56] when a man is talking to you you will
[47:58] hear nothing but the voice of god
[48:02] praise be to
[48:04] god the word
[48:07] the god we are worshiping is a living
[48:10] god
[48:12] the scripture we have read
[48:14] one time i was just listening to a music
[48:17] it just came in a wave
[48:19] that around that time any music that
[48:22] came to me just came with a message
[48:25] and i took this down
[48:29] and
[48:30] i titled this i titled this message
[48:36] trust in him
[48:39] when is that it is the hardest thing to
[48:41] do
[48:44] trust in him
[48:46] when it is the hardest thing
[48:49] to do
[48:51] praise be to god
[48:53] it is sunday morning
[48:56] you are in the house of god
[48:58] there are no strangers in our gates
[49:00] just relax and enjoy the world
[49:03] praise be to god
[49:04] i don't know how far we are going to go
[49:07] i don't know whichever way we are going
[49:08] to go it all depends on god
[49:12] brother brother says something
[49:14] that when you are going to the house of
[49:16] god
[49:18] and you tell god that i have just 50
[49:20] minutes for you
[49:22] guess what all you have is 50 minutes
[49:26] even though after 15 minutes you will be
[49:29] seated in your pure in your chair
[49:32] your timing with god is over
[49:38] it's over
[49:40] if you tell god it's 30 minutes i have
[49:42] for you after 30 minutes even though
[49:45] you'll be here your time with god is
[49:47] over because
[49:49] god works with what you give him
[49:54] don't give god conditions
[49:57] do not give god time
[50:00] praise be to god
[50:02] after all when we come to the house of
[50:04] god how long do we stay here
[50:08] the longest maybe two two and a half
[50:10] hours three hours
[50:16] just relax
[50:18] and enjoy the world
[50:20] praise be to god
[50:22] trust in him
[50:24] when it is the hardest thing
[50:27] to do praise be to god
[50:29] the days are getting to a head
[50:33] when you read your scriptures and you
[50:35] look around
[50:37] you can tell
[50:39] you don't need anybody to remind you you
[50:41] can tell that the deaths are getting to
[50:44] ahead
[50:46] the bible says that in the end time
[50:50] we shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[50:54] we hear that every day
[50:56] we hear of earthquakes
[50:59] online in sea by the name of tsunami
[51:02] every single time
[51:05] people are high-mandated
[51:08] the love of many is waxing cold
[51:12] people are lovers of pleasure more than
[51:14] lovers of god
[51:16] everything the bible talks of you can
[51:19] see it happening
[51:21] the devil is working 24 7
[51:26] 24 7 the devil is not resting because he
[51:29] knows that his time is closing in on him
[51:36] we are at the end time
[51:39] it is not time to play church any longer
[51:43] it is time to mean business with god
[51:47] because
[51:48] why the days are getting to earth
[51:54] and as the days are getting to a head
[51:56] and the devil is doing over time
[51:59] the devil wants you to to work below
[52:02] your time and you know what
[52:06] the economies of all the world are
[52:08] failing
[52:10] it doesn't matter what they do it will
[52:12] never get better
[52:14] but god is going to take care of his
[52:16] children anyhow
[52:18] but the economies of the world would
[52:20] never change it will get worse and worse
[52:22] and worse
[52:23] and the devil would make you think that
[52:25] by working overtime working two three
[52:27] jobs is going to get better and you do
[52:30] it over and over and it gets worse and
[52:32] worse and worse
[52:35] the devil is trying to steal your
[52:37] attention
[52:39] to get you to relax
[52:41] and to think you have a lot more time on
[52:43] your hands than you actually do
[52:46] and then he would exploit it your own
[52:48] disadvantage
[52:51] praise be to god
[52:52] and because of that
[52:55] people are getting cold and formal
[53:01] we are getting cold and formal
[53:04] and so complacent
[53:09] and we don't pay heed
[53:11] to whatever it is that is going on
[53:16] and the most vulnerable things in life
[53:20] we don't
[53:21] even pay heed to them
[53:25] and i want us to take hit tonight this
[53:28] this morning
[53:29] that the most vulnerable things in life
[53:32] are the things
[53:34] that come at no cost
[53:38] at no cost
[53:40] because if there is a cost attached to
[53:42] it
[53:43] you can't afford it
[53:47] it comes at no cost
[53:50] now let's just take food
[53:53] everybody eats
[53:56] everybody eats it doesn't matter what
[53:59] quantity you eat either plenty or small
[54:01] you eat
[54:05] except you don't have stomach if you
[54:07] have stomach you will get hungry you
[54:09] will eat
[54:10] if you hear somebody say oh what is it
[54:12] what is food i've heard that a thousand
[54:14] times already what is food what is food
[54:17] that that fellow has over eaten that
[54:19] morning amen
[54:22] if you can lock them in the room just
[54:23] lock them and give them 48 hours
[54:26] come back and ask them whether they have
[54:28] the same opinion
[54:29] they will change their mind
[54:32] now look at food
[54:36] we buy food
[54:39] any food you eat you pay for it
[54:43] if you are not paying for it somebody
[54:45] else is paying for it
[54:50] and do you know that you can go for 21
[54:53] days without food
[54:57] was it indira gandhi i believe he was
[55:01] that went for 21 days without food i am
[55:04] not talking of somebody who is fasting
[55:06] that is a spiritual exercise
[55:09] that comes with its own you know in its
[55:12] own environment
[55:14] i'm not talking about somebody that is
[55:17] on a spiritual mission i am talking of
[55:19] the colonel man
[55:22] that somebody survived 21 days without
[55:26] food
[55:28] take water
[55:33] the water that runs through your meter
[55:37] you pay for every gallon of it
[55:39] if you go to buy water from this from
[55:41] the store every bottle you pay for it
[55:45] but a man can go for three days
[55:48] without water
[55:50] again
[55:51] i'm not talking about somebody who is
[55:53] fasting and waiting on the lord no
[55:56] now there is a story about an australian
[55:59] man
[56:00] who survived for 17 days without water
[56:05] and he made it to the guinness book of
[56:06] records
[56:07] not because he liked it
[56:09] but he was arrested by two police
[56:11] officers and trump being in the cell and
[56:14] they forgot of him
[56:17] and he was there for 17 days before they
[56:19] remembered oh
[56:21] we arrested somebody and he's in the
[56:23] cells
[56:24] and they went low and behold he was
[56:26] still breathing
[56:28] so somebody made it for 17 days
[56:32] we pay for water
[56:34] we pay for food
[56:36] but you can survive days
[56:39] and weeks
[56:40] without them
[56:42] let's come to the air we breathe
[56:44] how many people pay for the air you
[56:46] breathe
[56:48] breathe all you can
[56:51] how many people pay for air
[56:53] but yet
[56:54] without air i give you three minutes
[56:58] because science says that anything after
[57:00] three minutes
[57:02] brain damage
[57:04] begins to set in
[57:07] anything after three minutes
[57:12] the most vulnerable things in life
[57:15] come at no cost
[57:18] and we breathe and we don't even we
[57:20] don't even know
[57:24] you know god is so wonderful
[57:27] god does not take advantage of his
[57:29] children
[57:32] can you imagine
[57:34] how important air is to man
[57:36] if god had put a meter on our noses
[57:41] to calibrate how much oxygen you take
[57:46] and then at the end of the month the
[57:48] angel of god comes going round
[57:50] taking the bills
[57:53] if you had to pay 90 of your salary to
[57:56] stay alive you will pay it before you
[57:58] spend on any other thing
[58:03] but god does not take advantage of his
[58:05] children
[58:06] i don't know about you but when i look
[58:08] in the mirror there is something in
[58:10] front of me that tells me i'll be in
[58:11] trouble
[58:13] praise be to god
[58:15] i can just go through the aisle and i
[58:17] can look at your faces and tell how many
[58:19] of us will be in trouble
[58:22] praise be to god
[58:24] and then the angel comes and tells you
[58:27] you are owing too much on your oxygen
[58:29] bill you know what i i am i am cutting
[58:32] off your supply next week
[58:36] are you going to sleep
[58:40] and then you run to the bank like we
[58:41] have it in america here you're going to
[58:44] sit in the air conditioning room you are
[58:45] sweating and that you know how the
[58:48] tellers are is becky here praise god i
[58:51] say can i give you some water
[58:53] you are thirsty but no you don't want
[58:55] the water
[58:57] can i give you some coffee no um you do
[59:00] want some soda no and then they come
[59:02] back can tell we are sorry your credit
[59:05] score is so bad we can't help you
[59:08] where do you stand
[59:12] now i am bringing us to a point
[59:16] look at how important oxygen is
[59:19] to a man
[59:25] the bible says man shall not live by
[59:27] bread alone amen
[59:29] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[59:32] the mouth of god
[59:36] look at the word of god to the soul of a
[59:39] man
[59:42] salvation is of the lord
[59:46] he alone paid the price
[59:48] it cost him his life on the cross
[59:51] that freely have we received
[59:54] if a man had to pay for his salvation
[59:57] how many people will be able to do it
[1:00:01] if we should put all the resources of
[1:00:04] the world together
[1:00:06] all the gold and the diamonds and the
[1:00:08] box side all the billions and the three
[1:00:10] lost in the millions together could we
[1:00:12] pay for one soul no
[1:00:16] we couldn't
[1:00:18] but the word of god comes to us
[1:00:21] freely
[1:00:23] freely we don't have to pay for it
[1:00:26] and because of that we disregard it you
[1:00:29] know it is just the nature of man
[1:00:31] that anything you are not spending money
[1:00:34] on you disregard it
[1:00:37] but if you had to save five years 10
[1:00:39] years 15 years 20 years to buy something
[1:00:42] you are going to hide it somewhere and
[1:00:45] once in a while you go and look at it
[1:00:48] and you cherish it and you are so proud
[1:00:50] about it and you are telling people
[1:00:51] about it and you are boasting about it
[1:00:55] but when it comes to the word of god
[1:00:59] which we have freely received
[1:01:01] we disregard it because it didn't cost
[1:01:04] us a cent
[1:01:07] because it didn't cost us anything
[1:01:12] and just look at it
[1:01:14] all that we struggle for
[1:01:17] going to work working overtime working
[1:01:20] two three jobs to get food to get close
[1:01:23] to get shelter what is it for
[1:01:26] is for this man here
[1:01:29] brother brother said once upon a time he
[1:01:31] walked through the museum
[1:01:33] and he saw
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] there was
[1:01:37] an analysis that was made of a man
[1:01:40] weighing 150 pounds
[1:01:43] and that analysis
[1:01:45] came with the conclusion that a man
[1:01:48] weighing 150 pounds is equals 84 cents
[1:01:54] 84 cents not 84 dollars
[1:01:58] not 84 000
[1:02:00] not 84 million
[1:02:02] 84 cents
[1:02:06] you say oh i look in the mirror and i'm
[1:02:08] so beautiful 84 cents
[1:02:12] i look in the mirror i am so handsome 84
[1:02:15] cents
[1:02:17] that i am wearing a hat hundred dollars
[1:02:20] i'm wearing shoes three hundred dollars
[1:02:22] i'm wearing a coat five hundred dollars
[1:02:25] you know what
[1:02:26] i'd raise ten thousand dollars to come
[1:02:28] to church today that is good 84 cents
[1:02:32] i am not saying that when you get up and
[1:02:34] you are coming to church just dress
[1:02:36] anyhow and come that's not what i'm
[1:02:38] saying
[1:02:39] i am saying look come with your best
[1:02:42] your best attitude your best clothes
[1:02:45] because you are coming to the house of
[1:02:47] god come and show your appreciation to
[1:02:49] god but it's all what 84 cents
[1:02:55] but do you know something
[1:02:56] in this 84 cent body there is a soul in
[1:03:01] man that was 10 000 of this world
[1:03:06] there is a soul in men that worth 10 000
[1:03:11] of this world
[1:03:13] and all we spend
[1:03:15] our time
[1:03:17] on is 84 cents
[1:03:21] 84 cents
[1:03:24] i want the best car
[1:03:26] for 84 cents
[1:03:29] i want to live in the best house
[1:03:32] to make 84 cents happy
[1:03:36] i want the best clothes
[1:03:39] so 84 cents can be happy
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:46] i want the biggest bank account
[1:03:49] so 84 cents can be happy
[1:03:54] and then we neglect
[1:03:56] the weightier matters of life
[1:04:00] which is your soul
[1:04:04] which is your soul
[1:04:07] which man or woman for that matter
[1:04:10] in your right senses
[1:04:13] would spend more time taking care of 84
[1:04:16] cents
[1:04:17] than the 10 000 wells that is in his
[1:04:19] heart in his soul
[1:04:23] but that is what we do a lot of the
[1:04:25] times
[1:04:28] that is what we do a lot of the times
[1:04:32] once upon a time i told a story here
[1:04:35] about that young man
[1:04:37] in his mid-20s
[1:04:38] thou got his phd
[1:04:41] he had everything going well for him
[1:04:45] and then he was diagnosed with a
[1:04:47] terminal illness and he was going to die
[1:04:50] and his ass called his father to get him
[1:04:52] all his books his father gathered all
[1:04:54] the books he bought for him
[1:04:56] and brought them
[1:04:58] and he said daddy you did very well for
[1:05:00] me you bought all the books i needed i
[1:05:02] am very successful i am very rich i have
[1:05:05] the best job but where is the bible
[1:05:09] where is the bible
[1:05:12] if god blesses you enjoy it
[1:05:15] but do not forget
[1:05:18] do not forget
[1:05:23] you may think that the air you breathe
[1:05:25] is even more important
[1:05:28] it doesn't mean anything
[1:05:32] the word of god means a lot more to your
[1:05:35] soul
[1:05:36] than oxygen means to your lungs
[1:05:41] you say oh brother if i don't if i don't
[1:05:44] breathe for four minutes i'm dead
[1:05:46] but i have not read the word of god for
[1:05:48] one week
[1:05:50] i have stayed without the word of god
[1:05:52] for 10 years and i'm still alive
[1:05:55] god have mercy on you
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:58] amen
[1:05:59] if you were suffocated god forbid
[1:06:03] if you were suffocated
[1:06:06] the worst that would happen
[1:06:09] you are just going to exit this life
[1:06:14] you will never enter here
[1:06:17] if you are a child of god amen
[1:06:21] but if you died without the word of god
[1:06:23] in your soul
[1:06:25] that is a dangerous condition for
[1:06:27] anybody to be in
[1:06:30] the word of god means a lot more to your
[1:06:32] soul
[1:06:33] than oxygen means
[1:06:36] to your lungs
[1:06:43] praise be to god
[1:06:47] do not lose sight
[1:06:49] of who you are
[1:06:56] the pressure there is in life
[1:07:00] is making us to lose sight
[1:07:03] of who we really are
[1:07:06] and we begin to think and do things like
[1:07:09] the world
[1:07:12] praise be to god
[1:07:16] jesus and his disciples
[1:07:23] they believed in jesus
[1:07:27] they trusted in him
[1:07:29] they had confidence in him
[1:07:32] they knew who he was
[1:07:35] it wasn't
[1:07:36] a second thought
[1:07:39] they were not in doubt
[1:07:41] because one time jesus gathered his
[1:07:43] disciples together
[1:07:45] and he asked them who do men say i am
[1:07:48] and they said oh they say you are elias
[1:07:50] you are one of the prophets you are this
[1:07:52] you are that you are that and when they
[1:07:54] were done he asked them but who do you
[1:07:57] say i am
[1:07:58] and the bible says the place was quiet
[1:08:02] and someone by jonah said
[1:08:04] you are christ the son of the living god
[1:08:07] and jesus told him that flesh and blood
[1:08:10] did not reveal this to you but my father
[1:08:13] which is in heaven and upon this rock i
[1:08:16] shall build my church and the gates of
[1:08:18] hell would not prevail against it
[1:08:20] so they knew who he was
[1:08:23] that he was the son of god
[1:08:25] the messiah
[1:08:27] brought on two feet
[1:08:29] and they saw it
[1:08:31] praise be to god
[1:08:33] they saw how he turned water into wine
[1:08:38] they saw how he opened the blind eyes
[1:08:43] they saw how he made the cripples walk
[1:08:49] they saw how he cleansed the lapis
[1:08:55] once once upon a time he was in the boat
[1:08:58] with his disciples he said let us go on
[1:09:00] the other side of the sea
[1:09:03] and while they were on the sea he was
[1:09:07] behind the boat
[1:09:09] sleeping on the pillow
[1:09:12] and the winds just came
[1:09:14] from left right
[1:09:18] and the waves just came trying to sing
[1:09:20] the boot
[1:09:21] and the fishermen inside just did all
[1:09:23] they could
[1:09:24] and the harder they tried
[1:09:26] the worse it was
[1:09:28] then they remembered that jesus was
[1:09:30] behind there
[1:09:31] and they cried out unto him master
[1:09:34] carries thou not that we perish
[1:09:37] and then he rose up and he rebuked the
[1:09:39] wind
[1:09:41] and he spoke to the sea
[1:09:43] and it just calmed
[1:09:46] they just stand and look at one another
[1:09:48] in the face
[1:09:49] what manner of man is this
[1:09:52] that speaks and even the winds obey him
[1:09:56] they knew who he was
[1:09:58] praise be to god
[1:10:00] he raised the dead from from from the
[1:10:02] dead he raised them back to life
[1:10:06] when lazarus was sick and he was sinful
[1:10:09] the bible says he turned there for a
[1:10:11] while
[1:10:12] and on the fourth day after lazarus were
[1:10:15] dead and buried
[1:10:17] he told his disciples to go let us go
[1:10:20] and wake lazarus up amen
[1:10:23] now science proves it when a man dies
[1:10:27] after 72 hours corruption sets in and
[1:10:30] here he comes and when mata had that the
[1:10:33] lord was coming
[1:10:36] she went and met him
[1:10:37] was crying master oh our only brother is
[1:10:40] dead he's dead i know if you were here
[1:10:43] he wouldn't have died but all the same
[1:10:46] whatever you ask of the father he is
[1:10:48] going to do it
[1:10:51] and jesus told him your brother would
[1:10:53] live again and mother said yes i know he
[1:10:57] would live in the resurrection in the
[1:10:58] last day and jesus said i am the
[1:11:01] resurrection of the life
[1:11:02] if any man believeth in me
[1:11:06] though he were dead yes shall he live
[1:11:09] and if any man believes in me and is her
[1:11:12] life he shall never see death
[1:11:14] praise be to god and when they were
[1:11:16] going marry hears oh jesus is coming she
[1:11:20] ran and met him oh if you were here my
[1:11:22] brother would not have died oh and they
[1:11:25] say you know what come on let's go to
[1:11:26] the grave
[1:11:27] they went
[1:11:29] and people were wondering what is this
[1:11:30] man going to do
[1:11:32] couldn't this man have stopped this man
[1:11:34] from dying
[1:11:35] now this man is dead he is buried what
[1:11:38] is he coming here to do then he
[1:11:40] commanded them took off the stone
[1:11:42] and they said oh
[1:11:43] for this today he is thinking
[1:11:46] jesus said did i not tell you that if
[1:11:48] you can only believe you see the glory
[1:11:50] of god
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:52] take the stone away
[1:11:54] and the lord is thrown away and he calls
[1:11:57] us from the grave
[1:11:59] say what is this
[1:12:02] praise be to god
[1:12:05] they knew who he was
[1:12:09] there was no question about who he was
[1:12:13] they trusted him
[1:12:15] they believed in him
[1:12:17] they had confidence in him their hopes
[1:12:19] were in him
[1:12:21] praise be to god
[1:12:23] now look at what is going to happen
[1:12:27] that he was betrayed
[1:12:30] remember
[1:12:31] we are talking about
[1:12:35] but trust in him
[1:12:37] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:12:42] he was betrayed
[1:12:44] and he was arrested
[1:12:48] now the disciples knew him
[1:12:50] that once upon a time
[1:12:53] that people took stones to stun him and
[1:12:55] the bible says he just went through
[1:12:56] their midst and they couldn't even see
[1:12:58] him
[1:12:59] so when they came to arrest him they
[1:13:02] knew something was going to happen
[1:13:04] and nothing happened
[1:13:06] they arrested him
[1:13:11] he was taken to palace judgement hall
[1:13:15] we all know the story i wouldn't want to
[1:13:17] go into them
[1:13:19] he was tried
[1:13:21] and sentenced to death
[1:13:26] the disciples were waiting to see
[1:13:29] because they knew him
[1:13:30] and they knew something was going to
[1:13:32] happen
[1:13:33] and nothing happened
[1:13:37] he was meant to carry his cross
[1:13:40] they were hitting him left right center
[1:13:42] spitting on him making fun of him
[1:13:47] they knew something was going to happen
[1:13:50] as they followed
[1:13:52] is he going to call fire from heaven
[1:13:55] is the ground going to open and swallow
[1:13:56] them up
[1:13:59] is he going to call legends of angels to
[1:14:00] come and destroy these people
[1:14:03] they knew something was going to happen
[1:14:05] as they followed from distance
[1:14:07] and nothing happened
[1:14:09] they whipped him and broke his back
[1:14:13] they knew something was going to happen
[1:14:15] and nothing happened
[1:14:19] they got him there put him on the cross
[1:14:23] and they nailed him to the cross they
[1:14:25] knew something was going to happen and
[1:14:27] nothing happened
[1:14:29] praise be to god
[1:14:32] brother brown said
[1:14:34] that it was not
[1:14:35] the roman spear
[1:14:37] or the nails
[1:14:39] that were driven in his hands and feet
[1:14:43] that killed him that it was broken
[1:14:44] hearts
[1:14:49] and you wonder is that how strong
[1:14:52] is that how strong broken heart can be
[1:14:57] is that how strong it can be
[1:15:00] let's just take a lesser form of it
[1:15:04] just imagine you've been the us for
[1:15:07] let's say 20
[1:15:08] years and all along you've been
[1:15:11] communicating with people back home
[1:15:14] and now you tell them you are coming on
[1:15:15] a visit
[1:15:17] and they are there expecting you
[1:15:19] and then you get ready you buy your a
[1:15:22] ticket you do your shopping
[1:15:25] and then you take your plane you buy
[1:15:26] your a ticket you fly
[1:15:29] at the airport you are expecting not to
[1:15:32] meet you there you get it there is
[1:15:33] nobody you see people standing with you
[1:15:36] with names with names written on a piece
[1:15:38] of paper and they are standing there and
[1:15:41] they are coming with cars and taking
[1:15:42] their families away you get there you
[1:15:44] are expecting that treatment
[1:15:47] nobody
[1:15:49] and then you remember you have the
[1:15:50] address to the house you take a taxi
[1:15:55] you got to the house
[1:15:56] and there they are sitting and then you
[1:15:59] stand at the gate and you shout it's me
[1:16:02] it's me it's me done
[1:16:04] and they're they're looking at you weird
[1:16:06] look
[1:16:08] and then they get up and they enter
[1:16:09] their rooms and you look i mean
[1:16:11] you just wish the ground opened and then
[1:16:14] you just buried yourself
[1:16:17] you will get so disappointed
[1:16:21] is just a strong dark energy
[1:16:29] now
[1:16:30] the man they had believed in all their
[1:16:34] life
[1:16:35] to be the messiah
[1:16:38] the money had been lived in all their
[1:16:40] life
[1:16:43] to be the son of god
[1:16:45] there was no doubt about it there was no
[1:16:48] question about it
[1:16:50] the man they had believed
[1:16:52] to be the one that was to redeem israel
[1:16:55] here he hangs on the cross
[1:16:58] where does that leave your faith
[1:17:01] why do you stand why does that leave
[1:17:04] your faith you say you believe why does
[1:17:06] that leave your faith
[1:17:10] look at the two people on their way to
[1:17:12] emails
[1:17:14] they were so heartbroken
[1:17:16] their house was shattered
[1:17:19] they felt so hopeless
[1:17:22] it was like the ground they were
[1:17:23] standing on had caved in on them
[1:17:26] while they walked
[1:17:28] and they commute one with another
[1:17:31] they were sad
[1:17:34] would use to believe
[1:17:37] trust in him
[1:17:39] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:17:43] in this day and age the same thing is
[1:17:46] happening
[1:17:49] that a man we have all believed him to
[1:17:51] be the prophet of god
[1:17:53] sent to us in this day and age
[1:17:56] with nothing but the word of god
[1:17:58] the man who denied himself
[1:18:01] of everything
[1:18:03] just for the sake of the love of god
[1:18:06] that his own family did not even get
[1:18:08] enough of him
[1:18:10] because of the love he has for the word
[1:18:12] of god and for the people of god
[1:18:16] that today
[1:18:18] not just people outside the message
[1:18:21] that even people in the message
[1:18:25] have not only turned against him
[1:18:28] but they are saying a lot of negative
[1:18:30] things about him
[1:18:32] posting a lot of negative things about
[1:18:34] him
[1:18:36] on social media calling him names
[1:18:39] dragging his reputation to the mud
[1:18:42] lamp pulling him
[1:18:44] lambasting him
[1:18:47] saying things they don't have any idea
[1:18:49] about
[1:18:50] they have hung his reputation on the
[1:18:52] cross
[1:18:54] this is the man you have believed in all
[1:18:56] your life to be the prophet of this age
[1:18:59] say to you
[1:19:01] would you still believe and trust in him
[1:19:05] remember
[1:19:07] the message is not brotherhood brahma's
[1:19:09] message
[1:19:11] the message is the message of the lord
[1:19:13] jesus christ
[1:19:14] to turn the message down is to turn
[1:19:16] christ down
[1:19:19] would you still believe in him
[1:19:22] and sister called me probably three days
[1:19:24] ago
[1:19:25] it's one thing when you hear
[1:19:29] about people saying things you don't
[1:19:32] even know them you don't even read about
[1:19:34] those things is one thing when you hear
[1:19:36] about them
[1:19:38] it's another thing when you know the
[1:19:40] people
[1:19:43] it's another thing because your sister
[1:19:46] was telling me
[1:19:47] brother
[1:19:48] these are people i know
[1:19:52] message believers
[1:19:54] not only were they message believers
[1:19:57] but they were people that preached the
[1:19:59] word
[1:20:00] people that encouraged me
[1:20:03] and they are leaving the message
[1:20:05] i know them
[1:20:07] brothers and sisters
[1:20:09] and they are leaving the message
[1:20:13] would you also go
[1:20:16] once upon a time jesus asked his
[1:20:18] disciples he told them if you don't
[1:20:21] drink of my blood
[1:20:23] and eat of my flesh you have no part in
[1:20:25] me
[1:20:27] and the bible says they got offended
[1:20:30] and they just started leaving one by one
[1:20:34] praise the lord
[1:20:36] and he had the twelfth
[1:20:38] would he also go
[1:20:41] and decide to who shall we go
[1:20:44] because you and lord have the words of
[1:20:46] eternal life
[1:20:48] praise the lord
[1:20:49] to whom shall we go
[1:20:52] now people you know
[1:20:54] that stood for the truth
[1:20:56] and they preached the message to you and
[1:20:58] i encourage you and they are living
[1:21:02] would you also go
[1:21:05] would you also go
[1:21:09] this is where you ought to know where
[1:21:11] you are standing
[1:21:14] this is why you ought to know where you
[1:21:16] are standing
[1:21:18] if you are not standing shield if you
[1:21:21] are not standing on the word of god and
[1:21:23] your faith
[1:21:25] is rather hooked on other people's faith
[1:21:27] why does that leave you
[1:21:32] have a relationship with god
[1:21:36] make sure
[1:21:37] that your faith is deeply uncut in the
[1:21:41] world
[1:21:42] because
[1:21:43] the word is our defense
[1:21:47] the word
[1:21:50] is our rock
[1:21:52] the word
[1:21:53] is our healer
[1:21:55] the word is our salvation
[1:21:58] the word is our peace
[1:21:59] the word is our joy
[1:22:03] is the word that is keeping us we are
[1:22:05] not keeping the word
[1:22:07] is the word that is keeping you have a
[1:22:09] relationship with the world
[1:22:12] in the beginning was the way the word
[1:22:13] was with god and the word was god have a
[1:22:15] relationship with god
[1:22:21] and this is where your faith is going to
[1:22:23] be tested to the call
[1:22:27] would he also go
[1:22:30] i don't know about you
[1:22:32] but as joshua said
[1:22:34] as for me and my family we shall save
[1:22:37] the lord
[1:22:38] if god is god let's worship him
[1:22:42] and he has proved
[1:22:45] beyond doubt
[1:22:47] that he is god

[1:25:20] our praise be to god
[1:25:23] don't let anybody deceive you
[1:25:25] we have not believed canningly devised
[1:25:27] fables we have believed us here the lord

[1:25:36] amen where do you stand
[1:25:43] where do you stand
[1:25:45] trust in him
[1:25:47] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:25:52] trust in him when it is the hardest
[1:25:54] thing to do
[1:25:56] praise be to god
[1:25:59] look at
[1:26:00] job
[1:26:04] would you trust him in your darkest hour
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:09] we are not talking of when things are
[1:26:11] rosy
[1:26:12] we are not talking of when things are
[1:26:14] going in your favor
[1:26:16] we are not talking of when you have
[1:26:17] everything at your back and call
[1:26:20] we are not talking of when life is so
[1:26:22] nice
[1:26:23] when you are having the promotion
[1:26:25] when there is money
[1:26:27] why there is no hardship that is not
[1:26:29] what we are talking about
[1:26:31] but would you still trust him in your
[1:26:34] darkest hour
[1:26:37] that was why satan got it wrong
[1:26:40] when satan went to god he told god
[1:26:44] it's because you have blessed him
[1:26:47] that is why he's serving you
[1:26:49] take all those things and see if you not
[1:26:50] kiss you
[1:26:53] if god blesses you
[1:26:55] enjoy it
[1:26:57] do not let your faith
[1:27:00] be in those things
[1:27:01] let your faith be in god
[1:27:04] [Music]
[1:27:06] enjoy it
[1:27:07] don't let your trust
[1:27:09] be in those things because they will
[1:27:11] perish in it
[1:27:14] let your trust
[1:27:15] be in god
[1:27:19] and we know the story
[1:27:22] how satan went in one day
[1:27:26] destroyed everything
[1:27:28] job had
[1:27:30] his beautiful family
[1:27:32] beautiful family
[1:27:34] sons and daughters
[1:27:38] he had his servants he had his cuddle he
[1:27:41] had a sheep mention it
[1:27:48] the man didn't kiss god
[1:27:52] he didn't kiss god it's that god has
[1:27:54] given me and he has taken praise be to
[1:27:56] his holy name
[1:27:59] and that wasn't enough
[1:28:01] satan went he said you know what
[1:28:04] a man can give anything for his life but
[1:28:06] you know what let me touch him
[1:28:10] we know the story again
[1:28:13] look at it
[1:28:15] a man that was faithful to the call
[1:28:19] and he served god
[1:28:21] the best he knew
[1:28:23] he gave his all
[1:28:26] that even after he lost everything he
[1:28:30] was still faithful to god
[1:28:32] and now
[1:28:33] his body
[1:28:36] he was in so much pain
[1:28:40] so much eggs
[1:28:43] sleepless nights
[1:28:45] normally somebody has to die
[1:28:48] before you see worms coming out of your
[1:28:50] body
[1:28:51] but he was living and worms were coming
[1:28:53] out of his body
[1:28:56] no wonder he cares the day he was born
[1:29:01] would you still trust in god
[1:29:04] in your darkest hour
[1:29:06] in your darkest hour not when life is
[1:29:09] good but in your darkest hour would you
[1:29:11] still have faith in that god you are
[1:29:13] saving
[1:29:22] he never gave up give up on god
[1:29:25] so much so
[1:29:27] that his own wife
[1:29:29] sabbah why don't you just cast god and
[1:29:31] die
[1:29:32] because the man was going through a lot
[1:29:35] he said don't speak like one of those
[1:29:38] foolish women
[1:29:39] must we only receive good from god and
[1:29:42] not evil
[1:29:44] can you imagine
[1:29:46] a man in that condition
[1:29:49] praise be to god
[1:29:50] he said praise god anyhow
[1:29:54] you got to that place and you glorify
[1:29:57] god
[1:29:58] when you know who your god is
[1:30:02] have a relationship with god
[1:30:06] have a relationship with god
[1:30:10] do not let anything
[1:30:13] take the place of god in your life
[1:30:17] praise be to
[1:30:18] god let your attention be here
[1:30:26] in your darkest hour
[1:30:28] in your darkest hour
[1:30:30] with you so trust in him
[1:30:34] look at mary and mata
[1:30:38] when their only brother was sick
[1:30:42] and they sent for the lord jesus christ
[1:30:43] and he didn't come
[1:30:45] and their brother died and was buried
[1:30:49] now look at it
[1:30:51] when they had jesus was coming
[1:30:55] if it were you and i
[1:30:56] we probably would have entered the room
[1:30:59] he waited for our brother to die now
[1:31:01] where is he going
[1:31:03] he was only a good friend when things
[1:31:04] were good we used to cook for him and he
[1:31:07] would come and spend time our older
[1:31:09] brother was sick we said for him he
[1:31:11] never came he is dead what is he coming
[1:31:13] for hey mata let's go to the room and we
[1:31:15] look up and jesus comes
[1:31:20] don't mind him when is that he'll go
[1:31:25] but it wasn't so with them
[1:31:28] even though they trusted in him
[1:31:31] even though they believed he was the one
[1:31:33] that was going to save their brother
[1:31:35] and he didn't show up and they died he
[1:31:37] died anyhow they so
[1:31:40] had so much confidence in him
[1:31:42] they still had a lot of trust in him
[1:31:46] so much so that when the head he was
[1:31:49] coming they didn't even wait for him to
[1:31:51] come they beat him outside there
[1:31:55] praise be to god
[1:32:00] in the darkest hour of your life would
[1:32:02] you so trust him
[1:32:06] trust in him
[1:32:08] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:32:11] will you trust him when it is not the
[1:32:13] popular way to go
[1:32:18] we are living in a world
[1:32:20] where it is not a popular thing to do
[1:32:23] serving god is not the popular thing in
[1:32:25] this life in this in this world we are
[1:32:27] living in
[1:32:29] look at the job places
[1:32:32] at the workplaces
[1:32:33] it's okay when you have homosexuals and
[1:32:36] lesbians
[1:32:38] talking about your face and everybody
[1:32:40] around
[1:32:41] kind of they just want to contribute
[1:32:45] it's okay when people go to the concert
[1:32:48] and they come oh i went to a concert
[1:32:50] this weekend oh everybody's talking yeah
[1:32:52] who was that what was that and they are
[1:32:54] all contributing oh how much was it was
[1:32:56] it nice they are all talking everybody
[1:32:58] wants to contribute
[1:33:02] it's okay on the job
[1:33:04] for people to talk about any nonsense
[1:33:06] they have
[1:33:08] but as soon as you start talking about
[1:33:10] god
[1:33:12] they look at one another's face
[1:33:15] those who want to live who live
[1:33:17] those who are not interests will burden
[1:33:19] their hearts
[1:33:20] and you can see it
[1:33:22] praise be to god
[1:33:27] serving god is not the popular way
[1:33:30] so if you want the popular way you are
[1:33:32] at the wrong place
[1:33:37] would you still trust in god
[1:33:41] when trusting in him
[1:33:43] is not the popular way to go
[1:33:50] at the disciples of the lord jesus
[1:33:52] it was not the popular way to go in his
[1:33:54] days
[1:33:56] the popular way
[1:33:58] was just to team up with the science
[1:34:00] they did
[1:34:02] the pharisees and they said you cease
[1:34:05] and shout let this blood come upon us
[1:34:07] and upon our children
[1:34:09] that was the popular way
[1:34:11] and yet
[1:34:12] they stood their crowns
[1:34:17] and when the devil cannot get you
[1:34:22] to stay away
[1:34:24] and he can get you to come to church all
[1:34:26] the same
[1:34:28] and get you to have one leg in the world
[1:34:31] and one leg
[1:34:32] in church
[1:34:34] he is comfortable with that
[1:34:37] he doesn't have to worry about you
[1:34:42] you have to watch the last day spirit
[1:34:47] that laodicean church is spirit you have
[1:34:50] to watch it
[1:34:56] the bible says
[1:34:57] in the book of revelation 3
[1:35:02] in the book of revelation 3
[1:35:06] that i know your words
[1:35:08] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:35:13] i would
[1:35:15] that was
[1:35:16] either cold or hot
[1:35:18] but because thou art lukewarm i will
[1:35:20] spew you out of my mouth
[1:35:25] people want to live in the world
[1:35:27] and they want to serve god at the same
[1:35:29] time
[1:35:31] you can't serve two masters at the same
[1:35:33] time
[1:35:38] and if the devil can get you to that
[1:35:39] point
[1:35:42] where you can do a little bit of the
[1:35:44] world and do a little bit of the church
[1:35:46] he is fine with that
[1:35:49] and that is the spirit we should be
[1:35:51] watching out for
[1:35:52] that lukewarm spirit
[1:35:58] that when you look at the world
[1:36:00] you identify yourself with the world and
[1:36:02] you still want to identify yourself with
[1:36:03] church and what god is doing in the
[1:36:05] house of god
[1:36:08] would you trust him
[1:36:11] when it is
[1:36:12] not the popular way to go
[1:36:16] trust in him
[1:36:20] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:36:24] trust in him
[1:36:25] one it is the hardest thing to do
[1:36:29] look at abraham
[1:36:32] when god gave him the promise
[1:36:35] that he was going to have a child he
[1:36:37] probably thought it was going to be in
[1:36:39] in a matter of a year or two years or
[1:36:41] five years
[1:36:43] and it went on
[1:36:45] on
[1:36:46] on
[1:36:47] on
[1:36:50] a scientifically
[1:36:53] the longer he waited for the promise
[1:36:56] the more impossible it was
[1:37:01] if you were in abraham's shoes
[1:37:04] would you still believe
[1:37:06] in the promise that god has given you
[1:37:10] or you are going to believe science
[1:37:13] over the world
[1:37:26] there is a story
[1:37:31] i'm not touching my nose
[1:37:34] i'm just speaking from it
[1:37:36] i don't want to even go by it
[1:37:38] praise be to god
[1:37:45] there is a story
[1:37:49] of a 16 year old girl
[1:37:53] by the name fatima
[1:37:58] fatima was born a muslim
[1:38:04] and as i said i was a muslim before
[1:38:08] and they used to call me
[1:38:14] sadat if i tell you the circumstances
[1:38:17] under which i came to christianity
[1:38:21] it was just
[1:38:23] the hand of god
[1:38:27] i have told that story
[1:38:33] but i don't think i'm telling it today
[1:38:41] and
[1:38:42] fatima
[1:38:44] a muslim girl 16 years old
[1:38:49] she had a friend
[1:38:51] that they used to go to school together
[1:38:55] and then she'll go to this friend and a
[1:38:57] friend will say i'm going to church
[1:39:02] let's go
[1:39:03] she said no i'm a muslim
[1:39:05] so one day she said let's go together
[1:39:07] and then they all went
[1:39:09] and from that time on fatima would go to
[1:39:13] church
[1:39:14] with her friend
[1:39:17] from that time on
[1:39:19] and then he got to a point
[1:39:21] fatima said you know i want to get
[1:39:24] baptized
[1:39:27] and the pastor said that is good
[1:39:30] but go and tell your mother because
[1:39:32] fatima was an only child
[1:39:34] fatima didn't grow to see her father
[1:39:38] her mother was her mother and her father
[1:39:41] at the same time
[1:39:44] she went and told the mother
[1:39:45] that mommy
[1:39:47] in fact i want to become a christian
[1:39:49] initially the mother disagreed
[1:39:52] but then she kept persisting
[1:39:56] then the master the mother said go and
[1:39:58] tell your uncles if they agree go ahead
[1:40:01] and do it
[1:40:03] so she went
[1:40:05] told the ankles
[1:40:07] and the anchors got so angry
[1:40:10] now i am telling you for a fact
[1:40:14] that in the muslim world
[1:40:17] if you want to live that faith
[1:40:20] to join christianity your whole family
[1:40:23] will kill you
[1:40:24] and they call that honor killing
[1:40:28] they say it's an honor to the family
[1:40:31] for them to lose you to another faith
[1:40:33] especially christianity they will kill
[1:40:35] you and that is fine
[1:40:39] and they were so angry with her
[1:40:41] and they said you know
[1:40:43] if you die we are not paying your school
[1:40:45] fees anymore we are done with you
[1:40:48] and then she went and told the mother
[1:40:50] say okay i told you then she said you
[1:40:52] know mommy i still want to do it.
[1:40:55] the mother said go ahead
[1:40:57] so she went
[1:40:58] got baptized
[1:40:59] started going to church
[1:41:02] this family was there helping her
[1:41:05] everything was so nice
[1:41:07] life was good in a way
[1:41:09] and this family had to leave
[1:41:13] and now fatima was on her
[1:41:16] on her own
[1:41:19] going to church anyway she never stopped
[1:41:23] and then her mother took ill
[1:41:26] of a terminal disease
[1:41:28] and she was dying
[1:41:30] and she was admitted to the hospital
[1:41:34] the last two months
[1:41:37] of her mother's sickness
[1:41:39] was very terrible
[1:41:43] she was admitted to the hospital
[1:41:47] now here she is
[1:41:49] an only child 16 years old
[1:41:52] how many of us adults
[1:41:55] adults i'm not talking of a child
[1:41:58] are able to shoulders
[1:42:03] trust in him
[1:42:04] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:42:11] they were living in a village
[1:42:14] the mother was admitted to the hospital
[1:42:18] now if the hospital in america here is
[1:42:21] all you know you don't actually know
[1:42:23] what i'm talking about
[1:42:26] these hospitals are different
[1:42:31] that when you are lying down you want
[1:42:32] the nurse to come you just press a
[1:42:34] button and they show up
[1:42:36] anything you want you press the button
[1:42:41] i remember one time my wife went she was
[1:42:43] lying down and she was not getting the
[1:42:45] button she pressed something and they
[1:42:47] all came running
[1:42:50] the doctor the nurses everybody came
[1:42:52] running
[1:42:58] nobody presses this she said i didn't
[1:43:00] know
[1:43:02] i am talking of a hospital when you go
[1:43:07] you are on your own
[1:43:11] i remember

[1:46:14] for her mother to go and take her bath
[1:46:16] and then sit down for the mother to eat
[1:46:18] before fatwa will come back from the
[1:46:20] hospital and then get ready to go to
[1:46:22] school
[1:46:27] and fatima would come
[1:46:29] and she gets to school late
[1:46:31] and when she gets to school late the
[1:46:33] teacher would call her to in front of
[1:46:34] the class
[1:46:37] why did you get to school late
[1:46:40] bring your hand
[1:46:42] and then the teacher will whip her
[1:46:44] and she'll be there jumping and the
[1:46:45] students are laughing
[1:46:47] you know how mischievous students can be
[1:46:50] and they are laughing kick kick kick
[1:46:54] the following day the same thing
[1:46:56] fighting my country changed
[1:46:58] they didn't know what was going on in
[1:47:00] her life
[1:47:02] she would come they'll whip her she will
[1:47:05] cry she would jump sit down go through
[1:47:08] the school day when she closes and she's
[1:47:10] going home when others are just going
[1:47:11] home to their families she has no family
[1:47:14] to go to she goes
[1:47:16] she's going to the bush

[1:47:32] for two months
[1:47:35] and every day the whipper in school
[1:47:38] every day the whipper in school
[1:47:42] and then one day
[1:47:44] before then
[1:47:46] all the prayer fatim i knew
[1:47:50] you could just sum that up into three
[1:47:52] ways
[1:47:55] all the prayers she knew
[1:47:57] she looks up in the skies
[1:48:00] father i love you
[1:48:03] won't you love me
[1:48:05] father i love you wouldn't you love me
[1:48:08] that was all fatima's prayer
[1:48:14] when life gets so hard and so tough and
[1:48:16] so rough
[1:48:19] and then oh should i go back to my
[1:48:21] uncles and go and just apologize so they
[1:48:23] can take me back
[1:48:25] probably life will be better
[1:48:28] and then something can say no i will not
[1:48:30] do it if i have to die for this cause i
[1:48:34] am going to die but i'm not going back
[1:48:37] i am not going back
[1:48:40] praise be to god
[1:48:42] the bible says he does put his heart to
[1:48:44] the plow and turns back is not worthy of
[1:48:46] me
[1:48:50] and there is a song that says i have
[1:48:52] decided to follow jesus that is not
[1:48:54] turning back
[1:48:56] there is no turning back
[1:48:59] there is no turning back
[1:49:02] praise be to god
[1:49:05] that was how once upon a time there was
[1:49:07] a king
[1:49:08] of
[1:49:13] his people would go to war
[1:49:17] and for every time
[1:49:19] they would kill the people
[1:49:21] and the people ran away they would kill
[1:49:23] them and the few ran away
[1:49:26] and the last time they went he said you
[1:49:28] know what
[1:49:29] when we cross the bridge
[1:49:31] we are going to blow that bridge
[1:49:34] we are going to blow it
[1:49:39] it's because there is a bridge and you
[1:49:42] guys have the comfort of running away
[1:49:45] that is why when the war gets tough you
[1:49:47] guys ran away this time when we cross
[1:49:50] the bridge
[1:49:51] we are blowing the bridge
[1:49:54] there is no turning back
[1:49:56] and when you know there is no turning
[1:49:58] back the fight is different
[1:50:02] and that was how come this time they won
[1:50:04] the war
[1:50:06] a lot of us still have bridges
[1:50:09] connecting us back to old friends
[1:50:12] connecting us back to the world
[1:50:14] connecting us back to different things
[1:50:18] and because of that there is no
[1:50:19] commitment
[1:50:22] there is no commitment we are just in
[1:50:25] for a while
[1:50:26] when the going gets tough then we are
[1:50:28] running away why because there is no
[1:50:30] commitment
[1:50:32] but if there is commitment if there is a
[1:50:34] sense of commitment if it will cause you
[1:50:37] to die you would die for your faith
[1:50:41] when the soviet union was soviet union
[1:50:45] there was a story of a soldier who took
[1:50:47] his gun
[1:50:49] and he knew that some believers were
[1:50:51] meeting somewhere in a house
[1:50:53] it is not the type of freedom we have
[1:50:55] here
[1:50:57] that you have the freedom
[1:51:00] you have the freedom to carry your bible
[1:51:01] and stand in the street and read
[1:51:04] and praise god people walk by and think
[1:51:07] you are mad that is okay
[1:51:11] and then he went to this place and then
[1:51:13] he knocked at the door entered there and
[1:51:16] then he caught his ak-47 he said you
[1:51:18] hypocrites you guys are those making
[1:51:21] this country difficult
[1:51:23] christians i'm going to kill all of you
[1:51:26] but before i start killing whoever is
[1:51:29] here and he knows he doesn't believe
[1:51:31] should get out
[1:51:32] oh no i i didn't believe
[1:51:35] then he walks out no no no this is my
[1:51:37] first time he goes out um i know i just
[1:51:40] came to see what was going on the
[1:51:41] workshop and then they kept going that
[1:51:43] one by one kept going out one by one
[1:51:46] and they run so fast that they even
[1:51:48] forgot to close the door behind them
[1:51:51] and when they were gone
[1:51:53] the soldier closed the door
[1:51:55] and he turned the gun on the rest so you
[1:51:57] guys are the believers you are the
[1:51:59] christians
[1:52:00] i'm going to kill all of you
[1:52:03] and then the pastor in the midst said
[1:52:06] we are ready to die for our faith
[1:52:10] [Music]
[1:52:12] for me to live is christ
[1:52:14] and to die is gain
[1:52:17] i am ready to die for my faith
[1:52:21] i am not going to renounce christ
[1:52:26] i have not come this far
[1:52:28] to turn back
[1:52:31] i am ready
[1:52:33] you can go ahead shoot me first
[1:52:36] and then he uncocked the gun and put it
[1:52:38] down and then sat down
[1:52:41] praise the lord
[1:52:43] and he said you know what
[1:52:45] i just came
[1:52:48] to have fellowship
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:52] yes
[1:52:54] that everywhere i go
[1:52:56] that i see people
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:52:59] people christ all over
[1:53:01] i want true believers
[1:53:04] people i can just associate with and
[1:53:05] worship god
[1:53:07] praise me to god
[1:53:10] yes
[1:53:12] you say you know what
[1:53:14] you are my brothers and sisters
[1:53:17] and then they started worshiping
[1:53:20] some people just hang around
[1:53:22] just long enough
[1:53:25] till there is problem
[1:53:27] and then they run away
[1:53:28] as a matter of fact there are some that
[1:53:31] want to even go
[1:53:33] but then they are waiting for an excuse
[1:53:35] so they can say i went because of this
[1:53:38] if you are that type of person don't
[1:53:40] wait for an excuse just go
[1:53:45] praise god
[1:53:47] don't wait for anybody to offend you
[1:53:50] just go
[1:53:57] fatima i've never forgotten my story
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:03] wants to go back
[1:54:05] should i go to my uncle and just plead
[1:54:08] with them probably they will take me
[1:54:09] back
[1:54:10] but something in here says no
[1:54:15] and all she would do
[1:54:17] look to the heavens
[1:54:20] father i love you
[1:54:22] wouldn't you love me
[1:54:25] i love you father why don't you love me
[1:54:28] and she is not hearing from god
[1:54:32] is this god real
[1:54:33] this god you are talking about is he
[1:54:35] real
[1:54:38] is he actually there
[1:54:40] and he if he is
[1:54:42] why is he not hearing me
[1:54:44] is he not seeing my tears
[1:54:47] is he not seeing what i'm going through
[1:54:54] trust in him
[1:54:56] when it is the hardest thing to do
[1:55:01] and then one day
[1:55:04] the people came to school
[1:55:07] and they were waiting to see fatima
[1:55:10] they were happy
[1:55:11] fatima was like coffee in the morning
[1:55:14] so the whip and they would laugh laugh
[1:55:15] and
[1:55:16] rejoice fatima didn't show up
[1:55:21] that's how she came tomorrow she didn't
[1:55:23] show up
[1:55:24] and then five days in a row fatima
[1:55:27] didn't show up
[1:55:31] then they knew that oh fatima has
[1:55:32] dropped from school
[1:55:34] and they said no it's even good for her
[1:55:36] she's good for nothing every day you
[1:55:38] come in late they're with you never
[1:55:39] change
[1:55:40] then they come the following week fight
[1:55:42] when i wasn't there the whole week

[1:55:55] school for one day the school is calling
[1:55:57] calling home
[1:55:59] to find out what is wrong
[1:56:00] and if they are not catching anybody
[1:56:02] they are sending a social worker to come
[1:56:04] and find out what is wrong in the house
[1:56:07] i didn't go to school for three months
[1:56:09] when i was in form two
[1:56:11] and my parents never knew about it
[1:56:15] i would get up in the morning and leave
[1:56:17] the house
[1:56:18] and they know i'm going to school
[1:56:20] there was a mango forest
[1:56:22] i would go and be in the mango forest
[1:56:24] with a friend
[1:56:26] and we'll just clear mongoose like
[1:56:27] monkeys from one branch to another
[1:56:31] and those who actually went to school
[1:56:32] will get to the house before me

[1:56:41] school because it was getting to the end
[1:56:42] of the term

[1:57:28] her

[1:57:31] get her grave
[1:57:36] miss fatih three months and my parents
[1:57:39] didn't know
[1:57:40] and they never got to know about it
[1:57:44] here in america they don't go to school
[1:57:45] one day they call
[1:57:47] if they don't get to their senate police
[1:57:48] social worker to come and find out what
[1:57:50] is going on

[1:58:01] the third week before they came to
[1:58:03] school fatima was the first person to be
[1:58:05] in school
[1:58:07] everybody was amazed
[1:58:10] and then the teacher came to class
[1:58:12] and then she caused everybody's
[1:58:14] attention and said fatima was the first
[1:58:16] person to come to school shall we
[1:58:18] applaud her
[1:58:19] and then when the french are plotting
[1:58:21] her she's a fighter but it's not over
[1:58:23] come
[1:58:25] for the two weeks you didn't come to
[1:58:27] school
[1:58:28] i'm going to whip you for it
[1:58:30] the fatima came
[1:58:32] so bring your hand say before i before
[1:58:35] you with me can i say something
[1:58:37] he said no what are you going to say
[1:58:39] hurry up he said no can i just say
[1:58:41] something say go ahead
[1:58:43] he said you know what
[1:58:47] all that time i was coming to school
[1:58:49] late
[1:58:51] i had a mother who was sick
[1:58:54] and she was she was sick to the point of
[1:58:56] death
[1:58:57] and was in the hospital
[1:59:00] and i'm an only child
[1:59:02] and i had to go to the bush after school
[1:59:05] get firewood come to the house
[1:59:08] come and sell get some food ready for
[1:59:10] her edit the following morning get her
[1:59:13] water to bath before i get back to the
[1:59:15] house and then get ready to come to
[1:59:17] school that was why i always came in
[1:59:20] late
[1:59:21] but for the two weeks you guys didn't
[1:59:22] see me she passed
[1:59:25] so i was in the house mourning her
[1:59:28] and i'm ellie to school today
[1:59:30] because there is nobody to take care of
[1:59:33] and then she did this
[1:59:37] and then the cane dropped from the
[1:59:38] teacher's hand
[1:59:42] and the teacher said why didn't you tell
[1:59:45] us this all this time
[1:59:47] he said no
[1:59:48] it's my cross
[1:59:52] but you should have told somebody he
[1:59:54] said no
[1:59:55] it's my cross
[1:59:58] and then all the school the people filed
[2:00:00] just one after the other and they came
[2:00:02] and started hugging fatima fatima we are
[2:00:04] sorry fight i'm sorry forgive me first
[2:00:06] i'm sorry forgive me fatima i'm sorry
[2:00:08] forgive me
[2:00:11] and the case went to the district office
[2:00:14] and this office took the mata over
[2:00:19] and her life changed
[2:00:21] from that time
[2:00:24] it changed so much so that they gave her
[2:00:26] scholarships
[2:00:27] her life changed so much so that finally
[2:00:30] in her life her uncles wanted to come
[2:00:32] back
[2:00:35] trust in him
[2:00:37] one it is the hardest thing to do how
[2:00:40] many of us would walk in fatima's shoes
[2:00:42] and still believe the god we are
[2:00:44] believing today
[2:00:46] how many of us
[2:00:49] after what fatima went through and she
[2:00:51] was still holding on
[2:00:53] believing in a girl she had never seen
[2:00:55] she only heard of a girl she had never
[2:00:58] experienced and she was still holding on
[2:01:01] and some of us have seen signs of
[2:01:03] miracles in diverse places
[2:01:06] and the little thing that happens we are
[2:01:08] ready to throw in the towel
[2:01:10] where do you stand on that day with such
[2:01:13] a little girl
[2:01:16] why do you stand
[2:01:18] we are not talking about you trusting
[2:01:20] and believing in god
[2:01:22] one things are rosy one things are good
[2:01:25] one you are comfortable one things are
[2:01:26] going your way but in the hardest moment
[2:01:29] of your life
[2:01:31] would you still believe in that god
[2:01:34] that god you claim
[2:01:37] that you know that god is a prayer
[2:01:39] answering god
[2:01:40] and that you have put a request before
[2:01:43] god
[2:01:45] and here you've been crying out to god
[2:01:48] crying out to him crying out
[2:01:52] and yet
[2:01:54] it's like he's paid a deaf ear to your
[2:01:57] call
[2:02:00] and you see god moving around
[2:02:03] you see you see god changing lives
[2:02:07] you see god performing miracles here and
[2:02:09] there
[2:02:10] and the one thing you have put before
[2:02:12] god and you've been crying day and night
[2:02:16] day and night it's like that god has
[2:02:18] paid a death ear to your call would you
[2:02:20] still believe him yes
[2:02:23] would you still trust in him
[2:02:29] that when people at work have ganked up
[2:02:32] against you
[2:02:34] in falsehood
[2:02:36] and people are ready to testify against
[2:02:38] you
[2:02:39] maliciously
[2:02:42] and you know it is not the truth
[2:02:44] and you are crying out to god
[2:02:47] for god to vindicate himself and you are
[2:02:49] not hearing back would you still believe
[2:02:51] in that god
[2:02:57] the times we are living in
[2:03:00] we are living in the most difficult
[2:03:02] times
[2:03:03] and if christ terrorists
[2:03:05] conditions are going to get worse and
[2:03:08] worse and worse
[2:03:10] the only way
[2:03:12] you can make it is to make sure
[2:03:15] that you have a relationship with god
[2:03:21] don't come to church
[2:03:24] because
[2:03:25] you want to please anybody
[2:03:31] don't come because you want to be seen
[2:03:37] don't come to church and then sit down
[2:03:39] and sleep
[2:03:43] as a matter of fact it's a very
[2:03:44] dangerous thing to sleep in the house of
[2:03:46] god amen
[2:03:48] because when the word of god is being
[2:03:50] preached
[2:03:52] and as you sit down and you are taking
[2:03:54] in the word
[2:03:57] evil spirits are living
[2:04:00] they are living you don't even realize
[2:04:02] it
[2:04:03] it only gets to a point in time and you
[2:04:05] realize that you know what i used to
[2:04:07] deal with this condition but it is no
[2:04:09] more you don't even know when it left
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] but one thing happens
[2:04:15] then when the evil spirits leave they
[2:04:17] are looking for another vessel to enter
[2:04:19] into
[2:04:21] so when you are sitting here and you are
[2:04:23] sleeping under the anointing of the word
[2:04:25] of god
[2:04:26] when the evil spirit is leaving one
[2:04:28] vessel is looking for the easiest one to
[2:04:31] inhabit
[2:04:32] you become a target
[2:04:34] is the reason why some people come to
[2:04:36] church healthy and go back sick
[2:04:43] come
[2:04:45] with your heart open
[2:04:47] come
[2:04:48] ready and willing to hear from god
[2:04:52] never depart from the word
[2:04:56] never if a man steals your car
[2:04:59] and you never get the car back forgive
[2:05:01] them
[2:05:05] if you're walking by the road and
[2:05:06] somebody just comes and give you a slap
[2:05:08] forgive them
[2:05:11] as hard
[2:05:12] as hard as it may be
[2:05:14] if somebody shows you their calling
[2:05:16] names they make fun of you
[2:05:19] have mercy on them forgive them
[2:05:22] but if somebody comes
[2:05:26] and tries to get you away from the word
[2:05:28] of god
[2:05:30] if you can take a picture of them take
[2:05:32] it
[2:05:32] and write satan under it
[2:05:36] that is the devil right there in human
[2:05:38] flesh
[2:05:40] just make sure they don't carry it to
[2:05:41] culture
[2:05:43] because if they carry the court i'm not
[2:05:45] be there to defend you
[2:05:47] but you have seen satan
[2:05:51] any spirit
[2:05:53] that will try to take you away from the
[2:05:55] word of god is nothing but the enemy
[2:06:02] hold that word
[2:06:05] so dear let it be so dear to you
[2:06:08] have a relationship with god because the
[2:06:11] only way
[2:06:12] the only way
[2:06:14] you can trust and keep trusting in god
[2:06:17] in the midst of the storms in difficult
[2:06:19] times
[2:06:20] when it is very difficult to trust in
[2:06:22] him that you can still keep trusting is
[2:06:25] when
[2:06:26] you have a relationship with him
[2:06:33] and you'll get to that point to know
[2:06:35] that oh there have been times when i
[2:06:37] actually wanted to just let go
[2:06:41] and as a matter of fact sometimes you
[2:06:43] let go the steering wheel
[2:06:46] you let go the steering wheel
[2:06:48] but you never end up in the ditch
[2:06:51] because he takes over
[2:06:55] praise be to god
[2:07:00] i like it when i'm talking from my heart
[2:07:02] straight
[2:07:05] praise be to god
[2:07:07] trust in him
[2:07:08] when it is the hardest thing to do
[2:07:11] the prophet says something
[2:07:13] and i want us to look at it
[2:07:15] just read
[2:07:19] in the message
[2:07:22] the mighty conqueror
[2:07:24] i think it wasn't
[2:07:26] forgotten the year but
[2:07:27] the mighty conqueror
[2:07:31] the angels sang
[2:07:34] and praised the monster
[2:07:36] as it moved down the street
[2:07:39] as the mighty conqueror who had
[2:07:40] conquered the sins of the world and had
[2:07:43] brought forth the righteous triumphantly
[2:07:47] on down through the city they went
[2:07:52] till they come to the throne
[2:07:55] there upon the throne sat the mighty
[2:07:57] jehovah
[2:07:59] mighty conqueror
[2:08:01] and as jesus came to the throne
[2:08:04] he fell on his knees
[2:08:06] and he said father
[2:08:08] i have finished that work
[2:08:11] that you gave to me to do
[2:08:14] i have paid the debt for sin
[2:08:18] i have the keys
[2:08:20] of both deaf and hell
[2:08:22] and your enemy is defeated
[2:08:26] and these
[2:08:28] are those who waited patiently
[2:08:31] for this hour
[2:08:34] and i can see the father
[2:08:36] as he sat
[2:08:39] climb up here on my throne my son
[2:08:43] and sit here until i make
[2:08:46] every enemy your footstool
[2:08:48] praise be to god
[2:08:51] there he sits
[2:08:52] the mighty conqueror
[2:08:55] trusting in his word
[2:08:57] believing everything he says
[2:09:00] trusting
[2:09:02] him as my all
[2:09:05] as my breath
[2:09:06] as my life
[2:09:09] as all that i have tonight i fully
[2:09:13] surrender myself
[2:09:14] to him
[2:09:16] both soul
[2:09:17] body and spirit
[2:09:20] looking for his second coming in glory
[2:09:23] when i'm sad
[2:09:25] i trust in him
[2:09:27] when i'm glad
[2:09:29] i trust in him
[2:09:31] when i'm sick
[2:09:32] i trust in him
[2:09:35] and when i'm lost
[2:09:36] i trust in him
[2:09:38] whatever befores me
[2:09:40] i trust him
[2:09:42] praise be to god
[2:09:44] and you wonder the prophet saying when
[2:09:46] i'm lost even when i'm lost i trust in
[2:09:48] him
[2:09:54] even when an angel comes
[2:09:58] to tell you that you are wasting your
[2:10:01] time
[2:10:02] and that you will die and you go to hell
[2:10:07] i would encourage you
[2:10:09] to keep trusting in him
[2:10:14] hold on first with the word of god
[2:10:17] if you can hold on first to the word of
[2:10:20] god
[2:10:21] and die believing in god
[2:10:24] if you even end up in hell
[2:10:26] it is going to be anything but hell
[2:10:31] hell cannot contain god
[2:10:35] praise be to god
[2:10:36] if you end up in hell with the word
[2:10:39] it will be something else but hell
[2:10:43] praise be to god
[2:10:45] that even when i'm lost
[2:10:47] even when i'm lost
[2:10:50] i trust in him
[2:10:51] in my saddest moment
[2:10:53] i want to trust in god
[2:10:56] when i'm happy i want to trust in god
[2:11:00] when i understand i want to trust in god
[2:11:03] when i don't
[2:11:05] i still want to trust in god
[2:11:08] praise be to god
[2:11:11] trust in him
[2:11:13] when it is the hardest thing to do
[2:11:16] musicians can come over
[2:11:19] trust in him
[2:11:21] when it is the hardest thing to do
[2:11:25] and i want
[2:11:26] us to take
[2:11:27] our bibles
[2:11:29] for some reason
[2:11:31] just go back
[2:11:35] go back
[2:11:40] to some 62 again

[2:12:08] from him
[2:12:10] cometh my salvation
[2:12:13] salvation is of the lord
[2:12:15] is not a man's making
[2:12:18] you can't work it out
[2:12:23] now people try to work out your own
[2:12:25] salvation
[2:12:29] i don't care how many broken bottles you
[2:12:31] work you walk on
[2:12:33] or how many times
[2:12:35] you walk on
[2:12:36] it can't change anything
[2:12:39] you either accept what the lord has done
[2:12:42] or you are in danger of condemnation
[2:12:50] praise be to god
[2:12:54] he is only he only is my rock and my
[2:12:57] salvation
[2:12:59] he is my defense
[2:13:01] i shall not be greatly moved
[2:13:03] how long will ye imagine mischief
[2:13:06] against a man
[2:13:07] ye shall be slain
[2:13:09] all of you
[2:13:10] as a bowing world shall it be
[2:13:13] and as a torturing
[2:13:15] their only console to cast him down
[2:13:18] from his excellency their delight in
[2:13:21] lies
[2:13:22] they're blessed with their mouth but
[2:13:25] they cast inwardly
[2:13:27] praise be to god

[2:13:54] and god would meet
[2:13:56] every expectation
[2:13:58] of your heart
[2:14:02] whatever your expectations are
[2:14:05] god
[2:14:06] in his good time
[2:14:08] would meet every one of them
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:11] my soul
[2:14:13] went down only
[2:14:15] upon god
[2:14:16] my expectation is from him
[2:14:19] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[2:14:23] is my defense i shall not be moved

[2:14:38] at all times
[2:14:40] you people
[2:14:43] trust in him
[2:14:46] at all times
[2:14:48] trust in god
[2:14:50] at all times
[2:14:53] if you forget anything
[2:14:55] that was said here
[2:14:57] during the course of this service
[2:14:59] remember this
[2:15:03] that trust in god
[2:15:06] at all times
[2:15:11] in good times
[2:15:13] and in bad times
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:17] whether god answers your prayer or not
[2:15:19] trust in him
[2:15:21] [Music]
[2:15:23] never turn your back
[2:15:25] on god
[2:15:28] for this world
[2:15:30] is not worth our attention
[2:15:34] this world is already gone
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:38] it is already gone
[2:15:42] know who you are
[2:15:44] that you are a child of god
[2:15:50] and when you know who you are
[2:15:53] and what your purpose is
[2:15:56] it doesn't matter what you go through
[2:15:59] it will not take you away
[2:16:02] from who you are
[2:16:07] like that slave we have heard of a lot
[2:16:08] of times
[2:16:10] know who you are
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:15] praise be to god
[2:16:18] shall we go to the lord in prayer
[2:16:21] i want you to talk to god
[2:16:25] i don't know
[2:16:28] in whatever way god has spoken to you
[2:16:32] because the bible says that all
[2:16:34] scripture
[2:16:36] all scripture
[2:16:39] is given by inspiration of god
[2:16:42] and is profitable for doctrine
[2:16:46] for reproof for correction for
[2:16:48] instruction in all righteousness
[2:16:52] i don't know
[2:16:53] how god has spoken to you
[2:16:57] but the bible has given us a promise
[2:17:00] that the word of god will not go out and
[2:17:02] come back void
[2:17:05] there is a reason
[2:17:09] why this way we have gone this way this
[2:17:11] morning
[2:17:13] i cannot even tell
[2:17:15] but i want you to set yourself
[2:17:18] set your heart
[2:17:21] i want you to talk to god
[2:17:24] talk to god as a son as a daughter of
[2:17:26] god
[2:17:32] we are to have a relationship with our
[2:17:34] god
[2:17:37] do not let the pressure there is there
[2:17:39] is so much pressure on the land
[2:17:42] enough pressure
[2:17:44] to take you away from the love of god
[2:17:47] there is enough pressure
[2:17:52] to keep you embarrassed
[2:17:56] but i don't care how busy you are
[2:17:59] i don't care how much pressure
[2:18:02] there is
[2:18:03] find time to seek the face of god
[2:18:07] find time to seek the face of god
[2:18:11] do not let the dog go by without you
[2:18:15] having a relationship with god
[2:18:17] try to seek the face of god by day and
[2:18:20] by night
[2:18:23] he is our rock
[2:18:26] he is our defense
[2:18:29] he is our comfort
[2:18:31] he is our joy
[2:18:33] he is everything to us
[2:18:37] if you set the lord aside life would
[2:18:39] never be the same
[2:18:44] it's just a matter of time
[2:18:46] and we'll be out of here
[2:18:48] praise be to god
[2:18:50] in whatever way

[2:18:54] to god
