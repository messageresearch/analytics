[50:28] things
[50:29] my understand.
[50:33] [Music]
[50:46] Hallelujah. Is it not your desire this
[50:49] morning?
[50:50] We desire more of
[50:53] God, saints, if we can look at one
[50:55] another and see even your own life, you
[50:58] can imagine how much you need God in
[50:59] your
[51:00] life. I'll be the first one to lift my
[51:03] hand. I need more of God this
[51:05] morning. You know, I I don't think I'm
[51:08] worthy of anything, but I depends fully
[51:10] on him this morning.
[51:12] Saints, wherever you are, just in your
[51:14] heart, just think of him just for a
[51:16] minute and say, "Lord, you know my
[51:18] mistake. You know my failures. I'm not
[51:20] worthy to be here, but Lord, may you
[51:22] speak to me. I don't know what is in
[51:24] your heart." You know, maybe there's
[51:26] something that you know, you've been
[51:28] asking the Lord to speak to you. Maybe
[51:30] you've been praying about it for a while
[51:32] and and you're just on expectation. Say,
[51:34] "Lord, I I don't know. I've been going
[51:36] through this routine over and over, but
[51:37] I need a special touch this morning."
[51:40] Don't look at the men behind the pulpit.
[51:41] I'm a man like you, but I need the same
[51:43] grace, too. But what will make a
[51:46] difference is to have him, Jesus Christ,
[51:49] the one who created the heaven and earth
[51:52] can just come into this presence and
[51:54] fellowship with us since that would
[51:56] change our life. He would change my
[51:58] life. I need God in my life this
[52:00] morning. How many of us need him this
[52:02] morning? He is here this morning in the
[52:05] in the simplest way. He's here. It's not
[52:08] about men. It's about him. We have
[52:11] driven from far to come to meet him and
[52:13] him alone. Shall we pray? Heavenly
[52:17] Father.
[52:21] We want to thank you this morning for
[52:23] your
[52:26] grace. If it had not been for you, Lord,
[52:28] I don't know where we would be, Lord
[52:31] Jesus. Your grace and your mercy, Lord,
[52:34] has picked us up from where we were,
[52:36] Father, in
[52:37] sin, Lord, in different things. So
[52:40] father in our various life oh
[52:42] God but your grace has invited us oh God
[52:45] father to fellowship around your word we
[52:48] are not worthy to be here father but we
[52:51] depending fully on the blood of Jesus
[52:53] Christ if it wasn't for Christ oh god
[52:56] we'll be in the world oh god father
[52:58] dealing with different things oh god but
[53:00] we are here because you have called us
[53:02] oh lord there is something in our heart
[53:04] that is drawing us closer to you lord
[53:07] even if the time is becoming challenging
[53:09] Oh God, but deep inside that seed is
[53:12] bubbling. Oh God, we want more of you.
[53:15] We want an experience with you, Father,

[53:19] Father. They are in needs. Oh Lord, I'm

[53:39] morning. Lord, have your way. Lord, I
[53:41] just give this service into your hand,
[53:43] Lord. As we pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[53:46] Amen. May God bless you. It's good to be
[53:50] in the house of the Lord. Amen. You
[53:53] know, Brother Benham always tell us, you
[53:55] know, we only receive what we expect.
[53:58] So, if you expecting a man with a suit
[54:02] to talk to you, that's what you're going
[54:04] to get out of him. But you you expecting
[54:06] God to speak to you, he will speak to
[54:08] you, you know. I don't think that you
[54:10] will walk drive this long just to hear,
[54:13] man. I don't think so, you know. But uh
[54:15] it's a privilege to be here uh to be
[54:18] able to open the word with you and and
[54:20] fellowship with you. We love the word
[54:22] the same way you love the word, you
[54:24] know. So if you're here, it means that
[54:25] you love the word. So we are on the same
[54:27] side. Amen. Do you love the Lord? Shall
[54:30] we open our Bibles if you will, please?
[54:32] We want to appreciate brother one. uh
[54:35] for giving us the opportunity to speak
[54:37] this morning. Um I I just believe that
[54:42] God will help all of us and just pray
[54:45] for me. Uh I don't think I'm a preacher.
[54:48] I just talk, you
[54:51] know, and we trust that the Lord will
[54:53] help us. uh in the book of Luke chapter
[54:58] 19 Luke chapter
[55:05] 19 it's a very familiar scripture there
[55:10] uh by the grace of God I have a thought
[55:14] here to me it's it's an experience it's
[55:18] an experience with God and and I I just
[55:20] believe that I would share it with you
[55:23] um don't I think it's it's just for the
[55:25] glory of God is the testimony of Jesus
[55:27] Christ. Now Luke chapter 19 verse one
[55:34] uh I think I don't know I think it's in
[55:36] the PowerPoint too so just to help us
[55:39] there.
[55:40] Now, if you could pay attention on this
[55:43] reading. And Jesus entered and passed
[55:46] through
[55:47] Jericho. And behold, there was a man
[55:50] named
[55:51] Zakius, which was the chief among the
[55:56] publican. You know, in that time, the
[55:58] publican were called sinners, right? And
[56:01] but he was he was rich and he sought to
[56:04] see Jesus.
[56:06] You know there there is something inside
[56:08] of his heart. He wanted to see Jesus. He
[56:12] wanted to understand him. He heard too
[56:15] much about him. But this time he's like
[56:17] what what is going on about this man
[56:19] that everybody are following and all
[56:21] this miracle happening in the city. But
[56:23] what about him? You know he sought to
[56:26] see him who he was.
[56:29] He want to know who is this man? It's
[56:33] not just what I heard but I want to meet
[56:35] him. I want to have an experience with
[56:36] him. Is that right? And could not for
[56:40] the press because it was a little was
[56:44] little of statue. You know, he did not
[56:46] let his size, you know, dominate his his
[56:51] his purpose in life. You see, he had a
[56:54] desire. It was not what was coming out
[56:57] of it physically. Here, are you with me?
[56:59] You know, down in his heart, he desired
[57:02] to see him. He wanted to know him. He
[57:04] wanted to understand him but it was
[57:06] short and there was different things
[57:08] that was on the way that was hindering
[57:10] him to meet him. Is that right? There
[57:12] are quite a lot of things in our life
[57:13] that are hindering us to see God. If we
[57:15] can be honest there's quite a lot a lot
[57:17] of things. And he ran before and climbed
[57:20] up into a sycamore tree to see him. He
[57:24] went even beyond that. He said no you
[57:26] know I'll climb up right to see him. Is
[57:29] that right? For it was pass.
[57:32] And watch what the Bible says. For he
[57:35] was to pass that way.
[57:38] You know Jesus did not just move from
[57:40] one city to the other randomly like
[57:42] that. There was a purpose. The Bible
[57:44] says he was to pass that way.
[57:49] There were many streets there, right?
[57:51] But his purpose was to pass that way.
[57:55] Are you with me? Amen. and and and and
[57:58] it the Bible continues and Jesus when
[58:00] when Jesus came to the
[58:04] place you know it was up there how did
[58:06] Jesus know him there was something that
[58:09] Zakius had that God could be able Jesus
[58:12] could be able to identify it you see
[58:15] that element is not what I can see you
[58:18] standing here this morning is something
[58:19] that is in your soul that I cannot see
[58:21] only God can see that so that's what I
[58:24] want to address this morning
[58:27] Are you with me? Amen.
[58:29] Now, and he ran before and climb up into
[58:32] a sycamore tree to see him, for it was
[58:35] to pass that way. And when Jesus came to
[58:38] the place, he looked up and saw him and
[58:42] said unto him. Now watch, Zakius. How
[58:46] did he know him? How did he know his
[58:48] name?
[58:51] Amen. It was an appointed time at the
[58:53] appointed place that he called his name.
[58:56] Amen. Amen. We must have an appointed
[59:00] place where God must call us.
[59:04] Are you with me? Amen.
[59:07] Zakius haste. Make haste and come down
[59:12] for today. Glory to God. I must abide in
[59:16] thy house. Amen. Hallelujah. At that
[59:20] time was a physical house. Now that's
[59:22] your body.
[59:24] Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory.
[59:29] Says for today I must abide at thy
[59:33] house. He must have wondered like how
[59:35] did he know my name? Out of all these
[59:37] people that are sitting here passing by,
[59:39] why does he want to just come to my
[59:41] house? Amen. What do I have?
[59:44] Are you with me? Amen. And he made haste
[59:47] and came down and received him joy
[59:50] joyfully. And when he saw it, the armor
[59:54] saying that he was gone to a guest with
[59:57] a man that is a sinner. Here come
[1:00:01] critics, accusers and self-righteous
[1:00:03] men. He says, "Why? Why? Why would he go
[1:00:06] to that man of a sinner? Oh yeah, I'm
[1:00:08] that sinner today that I want Jesus to
[1:00:10] come in my house. I'm not ashamed of him
[1:00:12] to do that to say that." Amen. Amen. Are
[1:00:15] you with me? Amen. And Zakayas stood and
[1:00:18] said unto unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord,
[1:00:21] the half of my good I give to the poor.
[1:00:24] And if I have taken anything from any
[1:00:26] man by a false accusation, I restore him
[1:00:30] fourfold." Repentance automatically.
[1:00:33] Something triggers in his heart, he
[1:00:34] start repenting, start making things
[1:00:36] right. Amen. Mhm. And Jesus said unto
[1:00:39] him, "This day,
[1:00:42] this day is salvation come to this
[1:00:45] house." Amen. For as much as he also is
[1:00:51] a son of Abraham.
[1:00:54] Watch now. For the son of man, the
[1:00:58] purpose of his coming,
[1:01:02] it says, "For the son of man is come to
[1:01:06] seek." Amen.
[1:01:09] To seek is seeking
[1:01:12] is is trying everything that he can to
[1:01:15] to grab that seed. Amen. Are you with
[1:01:17] me? Amen. It says to seek to save
[1:01:23] that which was lost. Amen. You seek what
[1:01:26] is lost means some point you had lost it
[1:01:29] somewhere, right? It was at the first
[1:01:31] state where you already got it. It got
[1:01:34] something that happened in between you
[1:01:35] lost it. But now as a father is seeking
[1:01:39] for that that seed to return back to
[1:01:41] him. It's not you that is seeking. It's
[1:01:44] God that is seeking.
[1:01:47] Oh, glory to God. John chapter 6 verse
[1:01:50] 44. And I'll have you standing. Let's
[1:01:53] sit down.
[1:01:56] Sorry. John chapter 6:44.
[1:02:05] No man can come to me except the father
[1:02:11] which has sent me. Draw him and I will
[1:02:17] raise him up at the last day. You cannot
[1:02:21] come unless he draws you.
[1:02:24] The potter has power over the clay.
[1:02:28] You know, he has power over the clay. He
[1:02:31] does whatever he wants to. Amen. You may
[1:02:33] be seated. May God bless the reading of
[1:02:36] the word.
[1:02:38] How many of us are happy to be in the
[1:02:39] house of the Lord?
[1:02:42] This uh as I said, we want to thank
[1:02:44] brother one for giving us the
[1:02:45] opportunity to speak. Uh we ask, we just
[1:02:49] pray that the Holy Spirit will come in
[1:02:51] the room. Who is under expectation?
[1:02:52] Amen. Who is under expectation? There's
[1:02:55] only few people that are under
[1:02:56] expectation. You know you will receive
[1:02:58] only what you expect.
[1:03:01] You know how many of us are under
[1:03:02] expectation?
[1:03:04] Hallelujah. Not from me, from the word.
[1:03:07] Do you love the Lord?
[1:03:10] Now in the scripture we just
[1:03:13] read.
[1:03:15] Um I I love the way brother Bham pray in
[1:03:19] one of the sermon. It was to pass that
[1:03:22] way. I think it's not part of my notes.
[1:03:24] Uh it says, "Our heavenly father, we are
[1:03:28] grateful to thee this morning because
[1:03:31] you are still seeking the save son of
[1:03:36] Abraham which is that which is lost."
[1:03:39] You know I I I love that most of the
[1:03:41] time you you know you will pick up
[1:03:43] something from brother Bam or even a
[1:03:45] prayer because I do believe that there's
[1:03:47] a power in it. You know there is a power
[1:03:50] in the word of the prayer of a prophet.
[1:03:52] You see, there was power in the prayer
[1:03:54] of Jesus. He said, "Father, I thank you
[1:03:57] that I'll lose none or not even one."
[1:03:59] You know, we can relate on this on these
[1:04:01] promises and really apply to our own
[1:04:03] life. Is that right? Now, as a thought
[1:04:07] here, I want to speak on call by name.
[1:04:15] called. You are called by name. by your
[1:04:19] name. Individually, you are called.
[1:04:25] It's very strange, but I just believe
[1:04:28] that this will be of a blessing. Do you
[1:04:30] love the Lord? And I know it's a little
[1:04:32] cold in here, but we can say amen to the
[1:04:34] word. How many of us love the word? That
[1:04:36] the Lord will be able to help us. Now,
[1:04:39] we see here and brother Benham teaches
[1:04:42] us that the book of Genesis is the seat
[1:04:45] chapter. Is that right? So, Genesis is
[1:04:49] where everything begins, right? So, if
[1:04:52] you want to know anything, the beginning
[1:04:54] of anything, you need to start in the
[1:04:56] book of Genesis. Now, if you have your
[1:04:59] Bible with you, can you can you just
[1:05:01] open it with me or the sister can
[1:05:02] project this? Um, in Genesis chapter
[1:05:06] 1:26, this was the men that God created
[1:05:10] in his own image. The Bible says, "And
[1:05:13] God said, let make man in our own image,
[1:05:16] after our likeness, and let them have
[1:05:19] dominion over the fish, and the fish of
[1:05:23] the sea, and over the fowls of the air,
[1:05:25] over the cows, and over the earth, and
[1:05:28] over every creeping things that creepeth
[1:05:31] upon the earth." Are you with me? And
[1:05:33] God created men in his own image. Are
[1:05:38] you with me? Do you see that?
[1:05:39] He created men in his own image. And
[1:05:42] brother Bernham says that the first man
[1:05:43] that God created was a spirit man. Are
[1:05:46] you with me? So you would say what why
[1:05:49] is he a spirit man? Because the Bible in
[1:05:51] the book of John chapter 4, it says that
[1:05:54] God is spirit. So this man that is
[1:05:56] created in the image of God must be like
[1:05:59] God. So if God was a spirit, this man
[1:06:02] has to be also a spirit because he's is
[1:06:05] created in the image of God. Are you
[1:06:08] with me? Now to to catch these things,
[1:06:11] what was this man that was created in
[1:06:13] the image of God? You need to open the
[1:06:15] book of 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:06:18] 4:4. Now the Bible, the the Bible shows
[1:06:21] us something here. It says, "In whom the
[1:06:24] God of this world has blinded the mind
[1:06:26] of them which believe not, lest the
[1:06:30] light of his glorious gospel of Christ,
[1:06:34] who is the image of God." Are you with
[1:06:37] me? So who is the image of God is
[1:06:39] Christ. So this man that God created in
[1:06:42] his own image was a God. He was an
[1:06:45] amateur God. Are you with me? He had
[1:06:49] power. He had dominion over the fish. He
[1:06:52] had dominion over the cows. He had
[1:06:54] dominion over everything that God had
[1:06:56] created. Now if you go down into uh
[1:07:00] Genesis 2:7, it says God formed the men
[1:07:05] from the dust of the earth. So now we
[1:07:08] see here that there is a man that is a
[1:07:10] spiritual man, right? And there's this
[1:07:12] man that is physical. So the spiritual
[1:07:15] man is created in the image of God. Are
[1:07:18] you with me? Amen. But now if you look
[1:07:20] at the the the the flesh is created in
[1:07:23] the image of a beast. You have hands
[1:07:25] probably like you know uh you can see
[1:07:28] some similarities between animals and us
[1:07:30] human. Can you are you with me? So this
[1:07:33] flesh here is not made in the image of
[1:07:35] God.
[1:07:37] What is made in the image of God is
[1:07:39] something that is inside that is
[1:07:40] invisible that we can't see.
[1:07:43] Are are you with me? So there is
[1:07:45] something that you have that is greater
[1:07:48] than just what I can see here. Amen.
[1:07:49] Amen. Amen. Before you step into this
[1:07:53] flesh, you were a spirit. You live
[1:07:56] before you existed before. Are you with
[1:07:59] me? Many of us may not still say, "Oh,
[1:08:01] brother, where are you getting this
[1:08:02] thing from?" It's in the Bible. Amen.
[1:08:05] Amen. The physical part is not really
[1:08:07] it. It's not you. The real you is
[1:08:09] inside.
[1:08:11] Are you with me? But something had
[1:08:14] happened. This man Adam was, he was an
[1:08:17] amateur god on the earth. He had control
[1:08:20] over the earth. He had, you know, he
[1:08:22] directed everything. For the matter of
[1:08:24] fact, he even gave names to animals. He
[1:08:27] could look at the character of this of
[1:08:29] this animal. He looks and say, "Oh, wow.
[1:08:31] That's a lion."
[1:08:32] So Adam when he was naming the animal,
[1:08:34] it was God naming the animal through
[1:08:36] Adam.
[1:08:39] Because God never stood there and say,
[1:08:40] "Adam, what did you name him?" Lion
[1:08:43] because Adam had the mind of God. He
[1:08:46] knew what God would want. So everything
[1:08:48] that God created, Adam had the ability
[1:08:50] to see the character. Amen. So the name
[1:08:54] that that Adam give the animal was the
[1:08:57] character of the animal. Amen. Amen. You
[1:09:00] see your name is not just oh wow I can
[1:09:03] give any name. No there is a meaning
[1:09:05] behind the name.
[1:09:07] And that name has an influence in your
[1:09:09] life. Amen. Because the name is not just
[1:09:13] oh yeah that's the way they call me. But
[1:09:15] there is a character that is hidden
[1:09:16] behind that name. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:09:20] Now this man God created in the image.
[1:09:22] He has power and everything. But it gets
[1:09:24] to a point where sin enter into the
[1:09:27] garden of Eden. How many of us know
[1:09:28] that? That's a very sad story.
[1:09:32] Can you imagine the peace and the
[1:09:34] fellowship that Adam had, you know, in
[1:09:36] the Garden of Eden? But at this point,
[1:09:39] the enemy had come
[1:09:41] to destroy. It came into God's own turf.
[1:09:44] Yeah. And destroy his own son, his own
[1:09:48] daughter. Amen.
[1:09:51] You know, can you just imagine as a
[1:09:52] father or a mother, a stranger comes and
[1:09:55] destroy your children in your own house?
[1:09:57] How would you feel?
[1:09:59] That was God in heaven. Amen. He saw the
[1:10:02] enemy coming and destroy and planted a
[1:10:05] seed. Yeah. And now we have two separate
[1:10:09] nature that comes in. Now we have the
[1:10:12] serpent seed and the seed of God. Yeah.
[1:10:15] And from that time the battle begin beun
[1:10:19] in your life. There's a part of yourself
[1:10:22] that you you can look on one side and
[1:10:23] say, "Wow, I can see God. I can't I love
[1:10:25] the word." on the other side the flesh
[1:10:27] is fight is fighting against you because
[1:10:29] there's two nature that are fighting you
[1:10:32] know the brother brother talks about the
[1:10:34] story of two dogs so there was a man
[1:10:36] that one says brother Brandham since I
[1:10:38] believe there's two dogs that are that
[1:10:40] are fighting there's a black dog and and
[1:10:42] the white dog and brother Bam asked him
[1:10:44] who is who is winning he says the one
[1:10:46] that I feed the most is the one that is
[1:10:48] winning
[1:10:50] so if you feed the white dog the white
[1:10:52] dog will grow it will get stronger if
[1:10:55] you feed feed the black dog, the black
[1:10:57] dog also will get stronger. So the
[1:10:59] question is, what dog are we feeding
[1:11:01] this morning?
[1:11:02] Are you with me? Now man lost that
[1:11:06] right. He lost the the the authority.
[1:11:09] You know, he had the control. He lost
[1:11:12] the title. Did what gave him access to
[1:11:15] eternal life? He was separated from God.
[1:11:17] Amen. That's right. Can you imagine? You
[1:11:21] know, you you you you enjoy the word of
[1:11:23] God and once because of sin, you are
[1:11:26] separated. Imagine the confusion that
[1:11:28] Adam could have. Wow. I I was at peace,
[1:11:31] but now the lion that I can't play with,
[1:11:33] I'm no longer playing with that lion
[1:11:35] because that fellowship was broken.
[1:11:38] You see, sin brings dysfellowship
[1:11:42] between God and man.
[1:11:44] Every time that we touch on the tree of
[1:11:46] of of good and evil, we die the very
[1:11:48] same day.
[1:11:50] But every time that we feeding on the
[1:11:51] tree of life, we are living eternally.
[1:11:55] But at that time there was no something
[1:11:57] there is no propation to stand between.
[1:12:00] So God had to kill an animal because
[1:12:03] without the the shedding of blood
[1:12:05] there's no forgiveness of sin.
[1:12:08] So when God sees his son and his
[1:12:10] daughter has broken his law,
[1:12:13] he had to find a way to bring back
[1:12:16] fellowship again. Amen. That's why he
[1:12:19] took a lamb and he slay him. You know
[1:12:22] man was running and took an apron to
[1:12:24] cover himself. God does not want you to
[1:12:25] cover yourself with religion. He want
[1:12:28] the blood. Amen.
[1:12:30] He want the blood of the lamb. So now
[1:12:33] when the Bible says the lamb was slain
[1:12:35] before the foundation of the world that
[1:12:37] was in the mind of God. But now on earth
[1:12:40] the lamb was not there yet. So he had to
[1:12:42] take an animal that created
[1:12:45] to stand in between. Amen. But he was
[1:12:47] not able to take away to restore
[1:12:50] everything fully
[1:12:53] because the lamb that God saw in his
[1:12:55] mind was not an animal because an animal
[1:12:58] does not have a soul.
[1:13:01] But God required a man lamb to die for
[1:13:05] you and me to restore us back. Are you
[1:13:08] with me? Oh, glory to God. I I love
[1:13:12] that. Right. So men enter into a state
[1:13:15] of amnesia. How many of us would know am
[1:13:18] what amnesia means? It's a condition
[1:13:22] involving the loss of memory due to a
[1:13:25] injury, illness or trauma.
[1:13:29] We you know the human race had dealt
[1:13:32] with a trauma in their life. So they for
[1:13:34] they forgot who they were in the garden
[1:13:37] of Eden.
[1:13:40] We forgot our authority. Mhm. We had
[1:13:43] lost everything. Adam could not even
[1:13:45] remember
[1:13:47] even after sin. You know, it was hard
[1:13:50] for him to tell his children what really
[1:13:51] happened in the Garden of Eden. He could
[1:13:53] not tell Abel and Cain what had happened
[1:13:56] before sin.
[1:13:58] Oh yeah. He couldn't tell them because
[1:14:01] one took actually the the fruit instead
[1:14:04] of taking the lamb. So it had to be by
[1:14:06] revelation.
[1:14:08] Amen. So everything that happened before
[1:14:11] the fall, they lost they lost the the
[1:14:13] the the the what had happened. They they
[1:14:16] lost everything, the joy that they used
[1:14:18] to have. But God says, I'm not going to
[1:14:20] leave my son and my daughter in that
[1:14:22] condition. I want to bring them back.
[1:14:25] Amen. I want to restore that fellowship.
[1:14:28] Then he spoke, he says in Genesis
[1:14:29] chapter 3 verse 15, I will put emnity
[1:14:32] between thee. What the that's that the
[1:14:35] serpent. Amen. Because the serpent is
[1:14:38] Lucifer incarnate into a body because
[1:14:40] Lucifer is also in the spirit realm. He
[1:14:44] must step into a body to fulfill what he
[1:14:46] want to fulfill. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:14:52] The same way God rest on the seventh day
[1:14:54] in men. Satan say, "Oh, so I need to
[1:14:57] find a body to step in and to bring
[1:14:59] destruction." But watch this what the
[1:15:01] Bible says. If you have time, you can
[1:15:03] listen to the message uh the serpent
[1:15:05] seed. There's a lot of things there. And
[1:15:07] I will put anything between thee and the
[1:15:09] woman and between that seed and her
[1:15:11] seed. So this beast had a seed. Amen. He
[1:15:16] had a seed. That's what the Bible is
[1:15:18] saying here. Are we Are we reading
[1:15:20] together? Amen. It says between thee and
[1:15:22] that seed.
[1:15:24] I will continue.
[1:15:27] Oh, glory to God. And he shall bruise
[1:15:29] the head and that shall bruise that heel
[1:15:31] is that is healed. Now we we already
[1:15:35] born into right our natural birth
[1:15:38] already brought that trait in our blood
[1:15:41] in our system. Our system is already
[1:15:44] compromised. That's why saint you cannot
[1:15:47] trust this body. Right?
[1:15:50] You see the reason why we need the
[1:15:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost is because we
[1:15:54] cannot trust this.
[1:15:56] We need the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:58] to to put this body under subjection
[1:16:03] because this body cannot stay under
[1:16:05] subjection. It cannot. It's like a
[1:16:07] beast. He has a beast nature in it. So
[1:16:09] the Holy Ghost come to actually subdue
[1:16:12] to put that body under control. Amen.
[1:16:15] That's why we need it. Amen. That's why
[1:16:18] we need the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:20] But our nature, our trade, the trade of
[1:16:23] seed was already embedded into our
[1:16:25] system. Look what Romans chapter 5 says.
[1:16:29] Verse 19, it says, "For by one man
[1:16:33] disobedience, many were made made
[1:16:36] sinners. So by the obedience of one
[1:16:40] shall many be righteous." Are you with
[1:16:43] me? And David speaks in in in Psalm
[1:16:46] 51:5, "Behold, I was shaped in iniquity.
[1:16:50] In sin did my mother conceive." You
[1:16:53] can't say, "Oh, no. My mom is righteous.
[1:16:55] My dad is righteous. Therefore, I'm
[1:16:57] naturally righteous." No. The Holy
[1:16:59] Spirit is not actually passed from one
[1:17:01] generation to the other.
[1:17:04] It's not that if the father has the Holy
[1:17:06] Ghost, the child automatically has the
[1:17:07] Holy Ghost. No. Every single one of us
[1:17:10] must come to that experience. Amen.
[1:17:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:15] And they have to know it at a young age.
[1:17:18] Amen. That if I have it, I cannot I can
[1:17:20] only pray for you that God give you
[1:17:21] grace to have it. But when it comes to
[1:17:23] placing the Holy Ghost in your life, I
[1:17:25] can't do it. The pastor cannot do it.
[1:17:27] The minister cannot do it. The pope
[1:17:30] cannot do it.
[1:17:32] That's right. True. Are you with me?
[1:17:35] Because this thing need to be dealt
[1:17:37] with. Amen.
[1:17:39] I'm not talking about just passing. No,
[1:17:41] I'm talking about deal with it at the
[1:17:43] root of the issue. Amen. And only God
[1:17:46] can do that.
[1:17:48] Are you with me?
[1:17:51] I'll read the first
[1:17:52] quote. Oh my. May God help us.
[1:17:56] Uhhuh. May God help us. Oh, glory to
[1:17:59] God. Are you guys ready? Yeah. We'll go
[1:18:01] a little faster here. Is that right?
[1:18:03] Now, a think men filter. Brother B says
[1:18:06] this. How many of us believe that we
[1:18:08] have a prophet in the land? Amen. And we
[1:18:10] have a message, right? We have a
[1:18:12] message. We have Christ in our midst.
[1:18:14] Right? So I we are believer of this
[1:18:16] message. Hallelujah. We believe that God
[1:18:19] sent a prophet in this last day. Amen.
[1:18:21] Not just to believe that, but to follow
[1:18:23] what he said. Amen. That's why we're
[1:18:25] reading it. There's a second part of
[1:18:28] that point. Anyway, so when you come
[1:18:29] into the world, we were born in sin. You
[1:18:33] did not even come with a fighting
[1:18:35] chance.
[1:18:37] It says you were born in sin, shaped in
[1:18:39] iniquity, come to this world speaking
[1:18:41] lies within your own spirit, the desire
[1:18:44] of sin, a lover of sin because you were
[1:18:49] born in sin. You did not have a chance.
[1:18:54] Are you with me? Watch what the brother
[1:18:56] says. But down inside of you, somewhere
[1:19:00] here you come. There was something in
[1:19:03] there that begin to draw. Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] Are you with me? Amen. It says if you
[1:19:08] know it was something that told you
[1:19:11] there was a God somewhere and and you
[1:19:15] read his word, there was something when
[1:19:18] you are reading the word of God. You
[1:19:20] read something you know that no there is
[1:19:21] a God that exists. You feel a
[1:19:23] connection.
[1:19:25] Not everybody feels that connection.
[1:19:28] So let me tell you something. If you
[1:19:29] open your Bible Bible you read, you feel
[1:19:31] a connection. There is something. That's
[1:19:33] what I'm about to talk about. Amen.
[1:19:36] Why do you feel connection when others
[1:19:38] are not feeling connection?
[1:19:42] Are you with me?
[1:19:45] Oh, glory to God.
[1:19:50] You know, men in his nature is
[1:19:54] absolutely contrary to God's will.
[1:19:58] Your nature, you you can't even you'll
[1:20:01] be completely outside of the will of
[1:20:02] God. That's why Jesus taught us to pray.
[1:20:07] It was just a model how to pray. Amen.
[1:20:10] It says may thy will be done. He knew
[1:20:14] how to pray because the disciple came
[1:20:15] and said teach us how to pray. Amen.
[1:20:20] That's when it start
[1:20:21] explaining showing to them thy will be
[1:20:24] done
[1:20:26] on earth as it is in heaven. Yeah. So
[1:20:31] there is a will in heaven that need to
[1:20:32] be followed on earth.
[1:20:35] So when you do something your nature
[1:20:37] cannot do it. You must depend on the
[1:20:40] heaven to dictate what is happening on
[1:20:42] earth. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:45] Are you with me?
[1:20:47] Oh glory to God. Oh my. My my my
[1:20:53] my God's desire. We were born already in
[1:20:57] sin. Sheep in iniquity. You are already
[1:21:00] a sinner. You are born a sinner. Sheep
[1:21:04] in iniquity. Come to the world speaking
[1:21:06] life from from lost from our birth.
[1:21:11] So when you can you just imagine a baby
[1:21:13] is born is all in on his own inside of
[1:21:17] his own system is already compromised.
[1:21:20] The child has not done anything yet.
[1:21:22] Yeah. Is because of sin.
[1:21:26] But I have a good news this morning. Oh,
[1:21:28] glory to God. Do you love the Lord? Huh?
[1:21:32] Do you really love the Lord?
[1:21:34] Amen.
[1:21:36] You know, there's a place here. For some
[1:21:38] reason, I didn't post it. I didn't put
[1:21:40] it there, but brother Brenham says
[1:21:42] something. It says, "I was saying taking
[1:21:45] for myself." I think it's in the message
[1:21:48] communion. Paragraph
[1:21:50] 45 it says like you was going to say
[1:21:53] William Brandham well 40 years ago the
[1:21:56] William Brham it isn't the same one
[1:21:59] tonight
[1:22:00] it says if somebody back there would say
[1:22:04] William Brham it was a rank rascal see
[1:22:09] because he was born of sh and elabbr he
[1:22:14] says in their nature I was a sinner
[1:22:18] So in the nature of your parents, you
[1:22:20] are already born a sinner.
[1:22:23] Oh my. It says in the nature I was a
[1:22:27] sinner. I came to this world a liar. All
[1:22:31] the habit of the world lay right in me.
[1:22:37] It says it does not stop there. It says
[1:22:40] but down in there too. Amen. Was another
[1:22:45] another nature present. See
[1:22:47] predestinated
[1:22:49] was in there by God in this same body.
[1:22:53] See to nature in there.
[1:22:57] Amen. You are born in sin. Yes. But
[1:23:02] inside also there is a nature.
[1:23:06] There is a predestinated seed that is
[1:23:08] planted in it. Amen. I can't see it. You
[1:23:11] cannot even see it until you get in
[1:23:13] contact with the word. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:18] is the word that shows the nature of the
[1:23:20] seed. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:24] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:23:26] Oh my. I'll read the second quote. How
[1:23:30] many of us love the Lord? So if
[1:23:32] somebody's sleeping, you tap them on the
[1:23:34] side and say, "Hey, the word is go." You
[1:23:35] know, it's happening. You don't want to
[1:23:37] miss this, right? Because it's
[1:23:39] contagious. You know, you love the Lord.
[1:23:42] It's contagious. Now the second quote
[1:23:44] here it was to pass this way. A man know
[1:23:48] that it comes from somewhere. Now I I
[1:23:51] love what the brother saying here. It
[1:23:54] says from the beyond when he leave it
[1:23:58] goes back somewhere. He's always trying
[1:24:01] to find something something to find out
[1:24:06] where he come from and where he's going.
[1:24:09] Are you with me? Yeah, there is only one
[1:24:12] that has that answer. He says that's
[1:24:15] God. Every man want to look over the
[1:24:18] curtain and when they see anything they
[1:24:21] uh that show that can show you what's
[1:24:24] over the curtain where you been and who
[1:24:27] you are and where you are going. There
[1:24:30] is only one book of all the literature
[1:24:34] that wrote of the millions of tongue.
[1:24:36] There is this is the book that tells you
[1:24:41] who you are, where you come from and
[1:24:44] where you are going. There is no other
[1:24:47] book that do it. The Bible. Are you with
[1:24:52] me? And the word is God. The Bible said,
[1:24:56] "Amen." So if there is one book that
[1:24:59] would tell you where you came from,
[1:25:01] where you are presently and where you
[1:25:03] going to go,
[1:25:05] so now Adam and Eve lost where they came
[1:25:08] from. Are you with me? Yeah. So the
[1:25:11] Bible, oh glory to God, is the one that
[1:25:14] tells you where you came from. So we
[1:25:16] would trust in the Bible where you came
[1:25:19] from. Glory. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:25:24] Because that's the only thing that can
[1:25:25] tell you.
[1:25:26] Amen.
[1:25:28] Let's trace where you came from.
[1:25:33] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:25:36] Now, God through this book, through the
[1:25:41] Bible is trying to
[1:25:44] reveal himself to a dialect. Because if
[1:25:49] you want to know where you were, you
[1:25:50] need to know who brought you first,
[1:25:54] right? Because if you know the person
[1:25:57] who brought you,
[1:25:59] you can actually identify him when he's
[1:26:01] drawing you. Amen. Amen. That's very
[1:26:04] important there. Amen. That's very
[1:26:07] important. It's not just about you. You
[1:26:09] must know him first. Then you know
[1:26:11] yourself. Amen.
[1:26:14] So now God is trying to reveal himself
[1:26:18] to the elect. Amen. Because they lost
[1:26:21] something. the lost the consciousness of
[1:26:24] who he is
[1:26:27] because Adam knew who God was.
[1:26:30] So God is trying to restore back that
[1:26:32] fellowship. He's trying to you know in
[1:26:34] the three-fold purpose is trying to
[1:26:37] reveal himself.
[1:26:39] So God reveal himself first. He has
[1:26:42] preeminence before he restores. Amen.
[1:26:45] Amen. So the three-fold purpose of God
[1:26:48] is to reveal himself. to have
[1:26:50] preeminence in the body and then restore
[1:26:53] back the kingdom.
[1:26:57] So God is when when sin enter into the
[1:26:59] earth, God want to reveal himself. So he
[1:27:02] start unfolding himself by
[1:27:08] amen. So he's still hidden
[1:27:12] but he reveal himself. Amen. No, when
[1:27:15] he's revealing himself, he's not just
[1:27:17] revealing himself himself as God. He's
[1:27:19] revealing you too. You part of that
[1:27:22] package.
[1:27:27] Oh my. How many of us are happy to hear
[1:27:29] these things?
[1:27:32] Oh, do you love the Lord?
[1:27:34] I just want to make sure that you love
[1:27:36] him.
[1:27:38] You cannot be this happy if you didn't
[1:27:40] love him. Are you with me? Amen. Now if
[1:27:43] you look at the Bible, this Bible that
[1:27:45] we hold on to, right? We we hold in our
[1:27:48] hands sometime. We let the dust come,
[1:27:50] you know, fall upon it. But this is God.
[1:27:54] This is God in written form.
[1:27:56] This this is God.
[1:27:59] Now, it was
[1:28:01] written by 40 men. This Bible that we're
[1:28:05] holding here, it was written by 40 men
[1:28:08] over a space of 6,000 years apart.
[1:28:12] Are you with me? Amen. So, 1600 years
[1:28:16] from Moses to Jo to John. So, in terms
[1:28:20] of things that were occurring, right?
[1:28:22] But it was in the space of 6,000 years.
[1:28:24] Are you with me?
[1:28:27] Some of this writer did not even know
[1:28:30] each other.
[1:28:31] Right. When they put the prophecy
[1:28:34] together, each one of them doveetailed
[1:28:40] without an error.
[1:28:42] Amen. Without a mistake. No man can do
[1:28:45] that.
[1:28:48] This was God. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:28:51] Amen. No man can do such a thing.
[1:28:56] Only God could be so accurate. And and
[1:29:00] precise. Amen. Men that never met each
[1:29:03] other, but they can say one thing, the
[1:29:04] other one underperation receive the
[1:29:07] whole thing. Amen. He opens up to him.
[1:29:09] is he prophesy of what will happen.
[1:29:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:15] We're not just believing any type of
[1:29:16] things. We believe in God. It's
[1:29:19] happening in here. Amen. Amen. And
[1:29:22] throughout the 66 book of the Bible, God
[1:29:25] is expressing himself little by little.
[1:29:27] He's showing his character, what he
[1:29:29] likes, what he doesn't like, and all of
[1:29:31] it. You know, but the one was talking
[1:29:32] about uh the ten commandments.
[1:29:35] The ten commandments, it's not just, oh,
[1:29:37] you have to do this, don't do this. No,
[1:29:39] no, no. If I don't tell you what I like,
[1:29:42] you would not know me.
[1:29:45] If I give you the 10 commandment, it's
[1:29:46] not for you just to do because I know
[1:29:48] you're going to fail. So, what he does
[1:29:50] is he was trying to tell them this is
[1:29:53] what I like. I don't bear sin. I don't
[1:29:57] want you guys to do this in a sense
[1:29:59] where I'm expressing who I am, my
[1:30:00] character, what I like. Amen. It's not
[1:30:04] the law.
[1:30:06] Cuz no man will keep it.
[1:30:08] Amen.
[1:30:10] Amen. Are you with me? Amen. Amen. This
[1:30:13] word depends on how you're looking at
[1:30:14] it. Amen.
[1:30:17] May God help us. Amen. Now, it's God
[1:30:22] that is hid himself in mysteries,
[1:30:25] in secret. He's hiding himself.
[1:30:28] So, I want you to catch this. When God
[1:30:31] is trying to bring that fellowship back,
[1:30:34] he's hiding himself. He does not fully
[1:30:36] want to show himself fully. He doesn't
[1:30:38] want to yet. He stopped opening little
[1:30:40] things. He hid himself in mysteries. And
[1:30:43] I'll show you that in the Bible in a few
[1:30:44] minutes here. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:30:46] This Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[1:30:48] Christ. So God hides himself in the
[1:30:52] Bible in some images,
[1:30:54] right?
[1:30:56] Yeah. In symbols, in materials,
[1:31:00] you know, you find he said, "Choose
[1:31:03] gold, choose the the, you know, go uh
[1:31:07] golfer wood." All of these those
[1:31:10] materials was expressing something in
[1:31:12] the Bible. Amen. Amen. Every single
[1:31:16] things in the tabernacle mean something.
[1:31:18] Amen. Not just, oh wow, they were
[1:31:20] talking about this material outside. No,
[1:31:22] those material meant something specific.
[1:31:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. So if you study your
[1:31:27] Bible carefully, you will find it. Yeah.
[1:31:31] Every ustencle in the tabernacle, the
[1:31:34] breast altar, the
[1:31:36] lav, you know, the the table of
[1:31:38] showbread, the candlestick, all of these
[1:31:41] things, the ark of the covenant, all of
[1:31:42] these things are there for a purpose.
[1:31:46] Even the horn of the altar. Amen. You
[1:31:49] know the the breastening altar had a
[1:31:51] horn on the side. There was a purpose
[1:31:53] behind it.
[1:31:55] Even the lava where they were washing
[1:31:57] the the the the Levites, there was a
[1:31:59] purpose behind it.
[1:32:02] Somebody will go study again. May God
[1:32:04] help us.
[1:32:07] God hid himself in the word in history,
[1:32:10] right?
[1:32:11] It talks about, you know, it was in the
[1:32:13] prophets, it was in the Psalms, it was
[1:32:15] in the
[1:32:16] proverbs, everywhere. He was displaying
[1:32:19] himself in different men. It talks about
[1:32:22] the story of Ruth. You know, brother
[1:32:24] Freddy was here talked about the story
[1:32:26] of Esther. How many of us saw God in the
[1:32:29] book of Esther?
[1:32:31] Amen. How many of us saw yourself in the
[1:32:34] book of Esther? Let me put it that way.
[1:32:37] You see, it's history and and some
[1:32:39] people just, oh yeah, this is a
[1:32:41] beautiful story. No,
[1:32:44] he placed it because he's trying to
[1:32:46] reveal himself. Amen. To you personally.
[1:32:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:55] God hates himself in numerology.
[1:32:58] He's a number seven. Every number means
[1:33:00] something to God. And that's why there's
[1:33:03] an appointed time. Even the book of
[1:33:04] Esther, you know, he was reading on the
[1:33:06] seventh day.
[1:33:08] All of these things, there's a purpose
[1:33:09] behind it.
[1:33:11] Are you with me? He hid himself in
[1:33:14] riddles and parable.
[1:33:18] He is talking about, you know, they're
[1:33:19] asking him a question. He speaks in
[1:33:22] parable. The parable is a secret thing.
[1:33:25] It's like a normal story. But there is a
[1:33:28] message behind that riddle.
[1:33:31] I want to know the message behind the
[1:33:33] riddle. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:38] Let's read this. Matthew chapter 13:10.
[1:33:40] You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:43] We still We're still climbing. Amen. If
[1:33:46] if you love the word, we can go faster.
[1:33:48] I'm going to take few minutes and we're
[1:33:49] gone. Is that right? Amen. Now, it's
[1:33:52] going to be long reading here, but uh
[1:33:54] Matthew chapter 13:10. And the disciple
[1:33:56] came and said unto him, why speakest
[1:33:58] thou unto them in parable? And he
[1:34:01] answered, he said to them, "Because
[1:34:03] watch what Jesus is saying. Because it
[1:34:06] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:34:11] of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
[1:34:14] is not given."
[1:34:17] Let's continue. And whatsoever has, to
[1:34:20] him shall be given, and he shall have
[1:34:23] more abundance, but whosoever has not
[1:34:26] for him from him shall he taken away
[1:34:28] even that he has.
[1:34:31] Therefore speak I unto them in parable
[1:34:34] because the
[1:34:36] seeing. So you see the seeing here is
[1:34:40] not what your eyes are seeing.
[1:34:43] Because Jesus is trying to say something
[1:34:44] here. Therefore speak eye I to them in
[1:34:47] parable because the seeing see not and
[1:34:51] hear they hear not. Neither do they
[1:34:54] understand.
[1:34:56] And in them is
[1:34:59] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which
[1:35:02] said, "By hearing ye shall hear it. And
[1:35:06] shall not understand, and seeing ye
[1:35:08] shall see, shall not perceive."
[1:35:13] Are you with me? Let's continue. For
[1:35:16] this people's heart is wax growth and
[1:35:20] their ears are door of hearing and their
[1:35:24] eyes have closed. They have closed less
[1:35:28] at any time they should see with their
[1:35:33] eyes and hear with their ear and should
[1:35:37] understand with what their heart and
[1:35:40] should be what converted.
[1:35:43] I should heal
[1:35:45] them. So God want want to heal you.
[1:35:51] You see his intention here. But who are
[1:35:54] closing the ears? It's us. We don't want
[1:35:57] to hear what he's saying.
[1:36:00] Are you with me? Amen. Verse 15. For
[1:36:03] this people No, let's 16 rather. be
[1:36:07] blessed, but blessed are your eyes, for
[1:36:11] they see your ears for they hear. Amen.
[1:36:14] Now verse 17. For verely I said unto
[1:36:18] you, many prophet and righteous men have
[1:36:22] desired
[1:36:24] to see those things which you see and
[1:36:26] have not seen them, and to hear those
[1:36:29] things which ye hear and have not heard.
[1:36:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:34] Are you with me? God help us.
[1:36:39] But it was given to a specific excuse me
[1:36:43] a specific group of people
[1:36:46] to be able to see and understand. Amen.
[1:36:50] When Jesus spoke in parable in public he
[1:36:54] spoke in parable but he called his
[1:36:56] disciple on the side. He told them what
[1:36:58] the parable meant. Amen. Are you with
[1:37:00] me? He gave them the revelation of the
[1:37:02] parable. Amen. Amen. But among the 12,
[1:37:06] Judas was also there.
[1:37:10] You see, the revelation of the parable
[1:37:12] was already expressed. But yet, they had
[1:37:15] a supernatural element that was
[1:37:16] remaining. Amen. And that supernatural
[1:37:19] element is only to the bride to the
[1:37:21] elect. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:37:27] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:29] The uh brother Joe preached about
[1:37:31] quickening
[1:37:34] quicken hidden is it see
[1:37:35] uh the quickening
[1:37:38] power not everybody can be quickened.
[1:37:41] Amen. Quicken it means to make alive.
[1:37:45] Amen. Amen. So there was some at a point
[1:37:47] something at was dead but it need to be
[1:37:51] revived again.
[1:37:53] So if that thing was not dead to begin
[1:37:55] with it cannot be revived.
[1:37:57] It's the same principle of redemption.
[1:37:59] Redemption means to bring back. Amen.
[1:38:04] Because you lost it, you must be bring
[1:38:07] it back. So if that thing was not
[1:38:09] originally there, it cannot be brought
[1:38:11] back. Are you with me? Amen. Amen. I
[1:38:15] don't think I'm preaching false doctrine
[1:38:16] in here. I'm just
[1:38:19] cuz everybody are quiet. You need to say
[1:38:21] amen to the word. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:27] You know it it is revealed by revelation
[1:38:30] huh it is given by revelation. Amen.
[1:38:33] Matthew 11:25 at the time
[1:38:37] Jesus Matthew 11:25 and at that time
[1:38:41] Jesus answered and said now is this is a
[1:38:44] thank thanksgiving over the elect.
[1:38:49] Are you with me? It says at the time
[1:38:51] Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh
[1:38:53] father lord of heaven and earth because
[1:38:57] thou had hid these things from the wise
[1:39:01] and the prudent and has revealed them
[1:39:05] unto babes. Amen.
[1:39:08] How many babes we got in the house? Oh,
[1:39:11] glory to God.
[1:39:14] Amen.
[1:39:16] Do you love the Lord? Amen. I I'm I'm
[1:39:19] I'm trying to bring you back where you
[1:39:20] were before the foundation of the world.
[1:39:22] Is that right? Amen. But I have to I
[1:39:24] have to follow the trade till we get
[1:39:25] there. We'll get there in a few minutes.
[1:39:29] Let's give an example
[1:39:33] here. Oh, glory to God. It is by
[1:39:37] revelation. It's not something that you
[1:39:39] fight. It's given by revelation by the
[1:39:41] grace of God. Amen. Now, Matthew chapter
[1:39:44] 16:1
[1:39:45] 16. And Simon Peter answered, "Now this
[1:39:48] is Jesus among his own disciples." Are
[1:39:51] you with me? He says, "Who do men say I
[1:39:54] am? Me, the son of man."
[1:39:58] They say, "Oh, no. People are saying
[1:40:00] that you Elijah, you Jeremiah and all of
[1:40:03] these things." He says, "What they say?"
[1:40:06] But now, let me bring let me bring you
[1:40:07] home now. Who do you say that Jesus
[1:40:11] Christ is? And the question was asked
[1:40:14] among the 12
[1:40:17] I I want you to touch these things
[1:40:19] please because it's important.
[1:40:22] And Simon Peter answered Matthew 16:16.
[1:40:24] And Simon Peter answered and says, "Thou
[1:40:27] are the Christ."
[1:40:30] Let me just stop a little bit
[1:40:32] here. What the revelation that Peter is
[1:40:35] receiving here from God is that is that
[1:40:38] revelation is is literally bringing
[1:40:41] Jesus Christ back where he
[1:40:44] was. After he yet condescended, Elohim
[1:40:47] condescended into a form which was the
[1:40:49] logos. Amen. The logos is the Christ.
[1:40:53] The logos is the word. Amen. So this man
[1:40:57] is standing before them was a man, a
[1:40:59] human being. Now he asked his disciple,
[1:41:02] who do men say I am? He asked them who
[1:41:05] men said that you you know I am to you
[1:41:08] guys. Then later on be there he looks at
[1:41:12] a man. Amen. This man that is standing
[1:41:15] here is like me. He's asking him oh my.
[1:41:20] The revelation come from heaven and told
[1:41:22] to Peter. Amen. Peter said thou art the
[1:41:26] Christ. Amen.
[1:41:29] You are the word made flesh. Amen.
[1:41:35] Are you with me? Amen. Amen. Oh, glory.
[1:41:38] I like that. It does not stop there. It
[1:41:40] says the son of the living God. Amen.
[1:41:44] The son is the same thing as the logos.
[1:41:47] Amen. Amen. You are the word. You are
[1:41:50] the Christ. You are the pillar of fire
[1:41:53] made flesh.
[1:41:55] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:41:59] Glory to God. And Jesus answered and
[1:42:01] said unto him, blessed are thou Simon
[1:42:05] Baronah.
[1:42:07] The flesh and blood has not revealed it
[1:42:11] unto thee. Oh my. But my father which is
[1:42:15] in heaven. Amen. Hallelujah. It says I
[1:42:19] said also unto thee that thou that thou
[1:42:23] art Peter and upon this rock I will
[1:42:28] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:42:31] shall not prevail against it.
[1:42:34] Hallelujah. And what was that re? Oh,
[1:42:38] glory to God. What was that rock? It was
[1:42:41] the revelation.
[1:42:43] It was not built upon a church. It's not
[1:42:46] built upon Peter. It was built upon the
[1:42:50] revelation. Amen. You are sitting here
[1:42:52] because of revelation. Thank you Lord.
[1:42:55] So the church of the living God is
[1:42:58] actually upon is built upon the
[1:43:01] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:04] Amen. Amen. the revelation of who Jesus
[1:43:07] Christ is.
[1:43:10] Jesus Christ is the word.
[1:43:16] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:21] Let me go back in the book of Genesis
[1:43:23] the sixth chapter. Amen.
[1:43:27] We have Abel and Cain.
[1:43:31] How do Abel
[1:43:33] knew? How do Abel knew that he had to
[1:43:36] offer a proper sacrifice?
[1:43:38] That it was not the fruit,
[1:43:40] but it was the blood. How did he know
[1:43:43] it? It was the same revelation that
[1:43:45] struck Peter. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:50] It's the same revelation that saints,
[1:43:52] you have two boys. Oh yes. You have two
[1:43:55] boys.
[1:43:57] They they coming to the altar. Amen.
[1:44:01] If just coming to church and say wow I
[1:44:04] want to be part of this church that
[1:44:05] makes us to have the re that's not true
[1:44:08] both of them were coming to the altar
[1:44:11] they were coming to worship
[1:44:14] they had the same ambition to worship
[1:44:17] were they sincere yes maybe yeah but
[1:44:20] there was something in them
[1:44:24] that was just beyond just a desire to
[1:44:25] say I'm coming to the altar
[1:44:28] amen it's a revelation amen Amen. And
[1:44:32] that is only given by God's grace. Amen.
[1:44:36] You love the Lord.
[1:44:39] Peter said, let's go. John chapter one.
[1:44:41] I'm going to go fast here.
[1:44:44] John chapter 1 verse one. In the
[1:44:48] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:44:52] with God and the word was God. The same
[1:44:56] was in the beginning with God. All
[1:44:59] things were were made by him and without
[1:45:02] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:45:05] Are you with me? Now it
[1:45:09] says in him was light. I want you to
[1:45:13] catch this. In him was life. Sorry.
[1:45:18] Amen. I want you to catch that. In him.
[1:45:24] Oh, glory to God. It says, "In him was
[1:45:28] life." Amen. And the life was the light
[1:45:32] of men.
[1:45:34] Amen. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:45:39] Let's go to 14.
[1:45:42] Verse 14.
[1:45:44] Now, we just spoke about the word. Is
[1:45:46] that right? Amen. Now the Bible
[1:45:49] continues says, "And the word was made
[1:45:52] flesh
[1:45:54] and dwelt among us, and we beheld his
[1:45:57] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[1:46:00] of the father, full of grace and truth."
[1:46:03] Amen. The word that was at the
[1:46:05] beginning, that very word is becoming
[1:46:07] now flesh. That's the revelation that
[1:46:10] struck Peter. No man could know that.
[1:46:16] It's not just a church membership. You
[1:46:18] able you able to know this. It has to
[1:46:20] come from God. Amen. To the elect. Amen.
[1:46:26] You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:46:28] I'm going to I'll read few scriptures
[1:46:30] here and I'll go fast. Luke chapter 10
[1:46:33] verse1
[1:46:34] 17. Now Jesus sent all the 70 disciples
[1:46:38] to operate miracles. And many people
[1:46:40] think like, oh yeah, if I'm doing
[1:46:41] miracles, therefore that's the evidence.
[1:46:44] Let let me kill that one. Let me just
[1:46:46] hit that thing real quick and we'll go.
[1:46:49] Luke chapter 10 verse 17. And the 70
[1:46:52] returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
[1:46:54] even the devil are subject unto us
[1:46:57] through thy name. And he said unto them,
[1:46:59] I beheld Satan as a lightning falling
[1:47:02] from heaven. Behold, I give unto you
[1:47:05] power to trade upon the serpent and
[1:47:08] scorpion over all the power of the
[1:47:10] enemy, and nothing shall by any mean
[1:47:13] hurt you. Now verse 20. Now withstanding
[1:47:17] in this rejoice not
[1:47:21] they just operated all the miracle as
[1:47:23] possible. Are you with me? Amen. The
[1:47:25] casad and all of these things the demon
[1:47:28] was subject to them.
[1:47:30] But Jesus is saying here now we standing
[1:47:32] in this joy night rejoice night that the
[1:47:35] spirit accepted unto you but rather
[1:47:38] rather rejoice because your name are
[1:47:41] written where in heaven. So if we have
[1:47:45] to rejoice we're not rejoicing because
[1:47:46] we're casting demon. We're rejoicing
[1:47:48] because we were there before the
[1:47:49] foundation of the world. Because our
[1:47:52] name was written in heaven.
[1:47:56] Amen. Amen. That's right. Oh, glory.
[1:48:00] John chapter
[1:48:01] 6:70. Jesus have answered them, "Have I
[1:48:05] not?" Hey, sorry. Have not I chosen you
[1:48:10] 12?
[1:48:12] Yes. Are you with me? It says, "Have I
[1:48:16] if not I chosen you 12, but one of you
[1:48:20] is a devil.
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:26] Are you with me? Amen. John 17:12.
[1:48:31] So, we're reading John 6:70. And now is
[1:48:34] John
[1:48:36] 17:12. While I was with them in the
[1:48:38] world, I kept them in thy name.
[1:48:44] Those that thou gave me, I have kept.
[1:48:50] None of them is lost. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:57] Amen. But the son of predition that the
[1:49:02] scripture might be fulfilled.
[1:49:06] Amen. So saint, if you are an elect of
[1:49:08] God, you cannot be lost.
[1:49:12] Amen.
[1:49:14] Saint, this is powerful stuff. Amen.
[1:49:17] Amen. Amen. There is not a possibility
[1:49:20] on earth for an elect to be deceived. No
[1:49:23] way. Amen.
[1:49:26] He says if it was possible, but let me
[1:49:29] tell you something. It's not possible.
[1:49:31] No way. God cannot make a mistake. No
[1:49:33] way. Amen.
[1:49:36] He cannot make a mistake in his
[1:49:38] election. He can't do it. Amen.
[1:49:42] Oh, he's faithful. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:45] Now, Acts chapter 13, there's a part
[1:49:48] that I want to just draw out of that
[1:49:50] scripture. Acts chapter 13 verse 48.
[1:49:53] When the Gentile heard this, they were
[1:49:56] glad and glorified the word of the Lord.
[1:50:00] Now, watch
[1:50:01] this. And as many as were
[1:50:09] to eternal life, Amen. believed.
[1:50:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:15] So when you're sitting here, you are
[1:50:18] believing the way of God.
[1:50:22] Amen. You were ordained to believe.
[1:50:25] Amen. You're not just randomly sitting
[1:50:28] there and believe. No, no, no, no. You
[1:50:30] were ordained to believe. Amen.
[1:50:33] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:50:36] Roman 8 verse 28 29.
[1:50:40] for whom he did for new. That's right.
[1:50:43] He also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:50:46] to the image of his son, that he might
[1:50:49] be the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:50:53] Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[1:50:56] them he also called, and whom he had
[1:50:59] called, he also justified, and whom he
[1:51:03] justified, them also
[1:51:06] glorified. Amen. That was in the past
[1:51:09] tense.
[1:51:13] That was in the past tense. Amen.
[1:51:17] Glorified,
[1:51:20] justified, called. Amen.
[1:51:25] Hallelujah.
[1:51:27] That's why you know when it comes to
[1:51:29] election is God. God alone. No man has
[1:51:33] power to tell who's going to hell, who's
[1:51:35] going to heaven. Amen. Amen. Amen. The
[1:51:38] power, the pter has still control over
[1:51:40] the clay.
[1:51:43] Ephesians 1 uh 1:3
[1:51:47] chapter 1 verse three. Blessed be the
[1:51:50] God of our father, God and father of our
[1:51:52] Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[1:51:55] us with all spiritual blessing in
[1:51:59] heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:52:02] he has chosen
[1:52:06] us in him.
[1:52:09] Amen. You see that in him again in him
[1:52:12] was the the life
[1:52:16] chosen as in in him
[1:52:20] before the foundation of the world that
[1:52:24] we should be holy. So in his thought if
[1:52:28] he saw you holy then
[1:52:31] he's seeing you holy now
[1:52:35] because of the sit that is inside. Amen.
[1:52:39] You are still walking. You're still
[1:52:40] struggling. But when he looks down, he
[1:52:43] sees a holy son and daughter of God.
[1:52:47] We need to have God's perspective this
[1:52:48] morning.
[1:52:51] Change your angles today. Look at the
[1:52:52] way God sees it. That's what brings
[1:52:54] peace in your heart.
[1:52:58] That we should be holy without blame
[1:53:01] before him in love.
[1:53:04] Are you with me? Amen. Having
[1:53:06] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:53:08] children by Jesus Christ to him
[1:53:10] according the good pleasure what of his
[1:53:12] will
[1:53:15] God God himself had an eternal purpose
[1:53:22] to take for himself a bride of his own
[1:53:24] choosing.
[1:53:26] You know a man would not want somebody
[1:53:27] to choose his wife. I mean anyways I'm
[1:53:30] the one that is going to marry this this
[1:53:32] this woman. I don't want anybody to
[1:53:34] choose that. So God himself as a man
[1:53:37] says, you know, I want to choose my own
[1:53:39] bride.
[1:53:41] I don't want anybody to choose that for
[1:53:43] me. I want to make that choice. So if he
[1:53:46] if God chose you this morning, don't get
[1:53:49] mad if my my neighbor is saved. He's
[1:53:52] been chosen. Amen.
[1:53:55] If I'm chosen, there's nothing that you
[1:53:57] can do about it.
[1:53:59] Amen. Amen. You cannot hate me because
[1:54:01] I'm I'm a chosen. That's God's choice.
[1:54:05] It's not because it's not even my own
[1:54:07] choice because I was born in sin.
[1:54:10] That's his choice.
[1:54:12] That's why it's an unconditional
[1:54:13] covenant. What if you do or you don't?
[1:54:16] But I have already done it.
[1:54:20] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:54:23] church of the living God, we need to
[1:54:24] come up higher. Amen. Amen. We need to
[1:54:26] rise a little higher. Amen. Oh, brother
[1:54:29] of Jesus Christ, let's come a little
[1:54:30] higher. Hallelujah. marriage and
[1:54:33] divorce.
[1:54:35] I want to rush something here. It says
[1:54:38] in him because we read in Ephesians,
[1:54:40] right? It says in him was
[1:54:45] attributes. Brother Bar explains. He
[1:54:47] says what is an attribute? Is a thought.
[1:54:51] Are you with me? So an attribute is a
[1:54:54] thought. So God had when he was living
[1:54:58] by himself, Elohim, he had thoughts. He
[1:55:02] had attributes but he wanted to express
[1:55:05] what was inside of his thought.
[1:55:08] He wanted to be savior. You know even
[1:55:10] when sin entering the garden of Eden, he
[1:55:12] knew what was going on
[1:55:14] because in him he wanted to be a savior.
[1:55:17] That's right. But you cannot be a savior
[1:55:20] if there's nobody who had fallen
[1:55:21] somewhere.
[1:55:23] Are you with me? So if you want to be a
[1:55:25] redeemer, somebody has to fall to for
[1:55:27] you to be a redeemer to qualify to be a
[1:55:29] redeemer. So he knew all things. He
[1:55:31] knows the end before the beginning.
[1:55:34] Hallelujah. This is the God that we
[1:55:36] serving.
[1:55:38] He knows the end of my life even before
[1:55:40] I was born.
[1:55:43] He spoke to Jeremiah. He says, "I knew
[1:55:45] you."
[1:55:46] What Jere what? What did What kind of
[1:55:48] Jeremiah that God knew before? Huh? It
[1:55:51] was in his mind. Amen. Jeremiah was
[1:55:54] there. He knew what Jeremiah will
[1:55:55] fulfill. Nothing will happen in your
[1:55:57] life until God permit it to be. If you
[1:56:01] were there in his mind, you will come.
[1:56:03] Everything that he thought about you
[1:56:05] will come to pass.
[1:56:07] Are you with me? Because you are the
[1:56:09] thoughts. You were there originally in
[1:56:11] the mind of God. Amen. Amen. Nobody can
[1:56:15] take you out of that original eternal
[1:56:18] mind of God.
[1:56:20] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:23] Who do you say this is?
[1:56:27] It says just just know this. How few
[1:56:30] recognize him to be the anointed word?
[1:56:31] How many of us? Let me repeat that
[1:56:34] again. How few recognize him to be the
[1:56:37] anointed word of that day? How do you
[1:56:40] build that? Let me read it. How many of
[1:56:43] us recognize him as the anointed word?
[1:56:46] That's a question now. That was on that
[1:56:49] day. Now in this day, how many recognize
[1:56:52] him as the anointed word? Amen. Amen.
[1:56:54] Because we just read it because it's a
[1:56:56] revelation. So if you don't lift up your
[1:56:58] hand, I'm not blaming you. It's still a
[1:57:01] revelation. Are you with me?
[1:57:04] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Just notice how
[1:57:08] few recognize him to be the anointed
[1:57:10] word of that day. See, God in the
[1:57:12] beginning being
[1:57:15] infinite know all things from the
[1:57:18] beginning. Are you with me? The only
[1:57:20] thing that these things are is the
[1:57:24] display of his attribute. I I love that
[1:57:29] it says an attribute. You have an
[1:57:33] attribute. It's your thought.
[1:57:36] You think of something then you speak
[1:57:38] it. Then you take it. It says that's
[1:57:41] God. He in the beginning if you you ever
[1:57:46] was or will or ever will be in heaven.
[1:57:49] Watch what the prophet say. You was in
[1:57:52] heaven to start with.
[1:57:58] If you ever going to be there means that
[1:58:00] you were originally there to begin with.
[1:58:04] Amen. I love that.
[1:58:08] You are part of God. Amen. You were his
[1:58:12] thought. Amen. He knew your name.
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:22] Brother Andrew, do you feel that God
[1:58:25] knew your name? Oh, glory to God.
[1:58:28] I should jump if God knew my name. Amen.
[1:58:32] Huh?
[1:58:33] Oh, glory to God.
[1:58:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. Mhm. He knew who
[1:58:41] you were before there were ever a
[1:58:44] molecule. That's right. Before there was
[1:58:46] a light, before there was anything, he
[1:58:49] knew you. Amen. Oh, glory to God. And
[1:58:54] your name. That's right. And put it on
[1:58:57] the lamb's book of life.
[1:59:00] Before the word was ever full. Thank
[1:59:03] you, Lord. See, you were his thoughts.
[1:59:06] Amen. It says then you become what? The
[1:59:09] word. The word is a thought expressed.
[1:59:15] Thank you Jesus. If I have a thought in
[1:59:18] my mind, I will just shut up. You would
[1:59:21] not know what I'm thinking. When I open
[1:59:24] my my mouth, then you know what I was
[1:59:26] thinking. So if you're standing here as
[1:59:29] an elect mean you an expression of what
[1:59:32] he thought.
[1:59:34] You may not get to that place yet, but
[1:59:37] you are on your way there. It's a
[1:59:40] process. To him is a finished work. To
[1:59:44] you, you still struggling with this
[1:59:46] flesh, but to him is a finished work.
[1:59:51] That's right. That is right. That's a
[1:59:53] God who knows the end before the
[1:59:54] beginning. Cuz he's already declaring to
[1:59:57] you what will be the end.
[2:00:00] You love the Lord. That's right. Amen.
[2:00:02] Oh, I love that. Let me continue. Oh,
[2:00:04] it's continuing. So, we still have a
[2:00:06] life here. Is that right, sister? Can we
[2:00:10] go back a little bit? See if I had come
[2:00:12] to the end of of that.
[2:00:15] Oh, yes. It says, "Then you are
[2:00:17] manifested." Amen. Let's continue. Thank
[2:00:20] you. That's the way he was. He was in
[2:00:24] the beginning by himself. That's Elohim.
[2:00:27] God dwell alone with his thoughts. Amen.
[2:00:31] He will. Oh, I like this. He will never
[2:00:35] do that again cuz his thoughts are being
[2:00:39] made manifest.
[2:00:41] That's why we are right here.
[2:00:46] Oh, glory to God. We're not going
[2:00:49] backward. We You already here.
[2:00:54] Oh, glory to God.
[2:00:58] Huh?
[2:01:00] Where? Where am I at?
[2:01:03] Amen. Is God. Oh, thank you. Is
[2:01:08] God fellowshipping
[2:01:12] with his own thoughts?
[2:01:15] Can you imagine God sitting by himself?
[2:01:18] He's just having fellowshipping with me
[2:01:20] in his mind.
[2:01:22] What do you expect me to be standing
[2:01:24] here to
[2:01:25] do? Amen.
[2:01:28] Amen. Thank you, Lord, brother. These
[2:01:30] are heavy stuff.
[2:01:33] We Some people think, "Oh, no. I have a
[2:01:35] choice to make." There's no choice. He
[2:01:37] knew it. He's just watching you
[2:01:38] fulfilling what he was thinking.
[2:01:42] Oh, we we have a powerful God.
[2:01:45] That changes the way we worship. Yeah.
[2:01:48] That's right.
[2:01:51] He's worthy. Amen. God fellowshipping
[2:01:54] with his own thoughts being made
[2:01:56] manifest. See there we are. So by taking
[2:02:00] thoughts cannot add one cubic to your
[2:02:02] statute. You cannot do this that all the
[2:02:05] other. It's God that shows mercy. It's
[2:02:08] God. All the father has given me will
[2:02:12] come to me and no man can come except
[2:02:17] the father draws him. He says that
[2:02:20] settles it. That's right. Amen. You
[2:02:23] cannot be drawn until it dra it it draws
[2:02:27] you first.
[2:02:29] That's right. Oh my. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:33] Let's go to deep stuff now. Thank you. A
[2:02:36] physic exposition of the church ages sme
[2:02:39] church age.
[2:02:41] Thank you Jesus. Now watch this
[2:02:45] closely before I close this subject and
[2:02:47] I want to settle something very
[2:02:49] important. And I think by the one has
[2:02:50] spoken about this before. He says before
[2:02:52] I close this subject I know there's a
[2:02:55] question in my mind in sorry in your
[2:02:57] minds you would you want to know if I
[2:03:01] believe in the doctrine of preexistence
[2:03:03] right I don't believe in that moment
[2:03:05] doctrine of predict preexistence of the
[2:03:08] soul any more than I believe any more
[2:03:11] than I believe in reincarnation or
[2:03:14] transfiguration uh transmigration of
[2:03:16] souls. Be careful here to see this. It
[2:03:21] is not the
[2:03:23] person that comes predestinated
[2:03:26] eternally from God. Are you with I want
[2:03:29] you to catch this.
[2:03:31] It's the It is the
[2:03:35] word or seed. I want us to lay that so
[2:03:38] we can know what's going on here
[2:03:41] because I don't want anybody to blame me
[2:03:43] later. So this is the foundation where
[2:03:45] we'll put our feet there, right? It's
[2:03:47] the word is the seed that is
[2:03:51] predestinated. Let's move on to the next
[2:03:55] quote. Now, how many of us have seen
[2:03:59] this? So, I will read the quote first.
[2:04:02] Brother Benam says something. It says
[2:04:04] this little inside of the inside that
[2:04:06] where
[2:04:08] you start which is your soul. Then comes
[2:04:12] from that there's a spirit. Then comes a
[2:04:15] living being. Now the living being has
[2:04:18] five senses to contact the second has
[2:04:21] five senses and the outside part see
[2:04:23] taste feel smell here the inside body
[2:04:27] has love and conscience and so forth the
[2:04:30] five senses but inside of that inside a
[2:04:33] control tower it's either God or Satan
[2:04:38] this is the predestinated seed
[2:04:41] it's not the soul that is predestinated
[2:04:44] but is that seed word that God dropped
[2:04:47] before the foundation of the world.
[2:04:49] Amen.
[2:04:52] And that seed is God himself.
[2:04:56] That's right. That's right. The one that
[2:04:59] is not predestinated is not this.
[2:05:04] There is not that seed inside. Let's
[2:05:06] move on to the next quote if I can I can
[2:05:08] go faster here.
[2:05:11] Brother Benham says something about the
[2:05:14] woman at the
[2:05:16] well. Let's
[2:05:18] see. In that's the message
[2:05:21] shalom. Watch this. It says there stood
[2:05:25] Judas. We spoke about Judas, right?
[2:05:28] Light shining up here, but back in his
[2:05:32] heart was dark seed. Are you with me? It
[2:05:38] says when the showdown
[2:05:41] come, the
[2:05:43] darkness showed.
[2:05:46] Are you with me?
[2:05:48] Now, it speaks of the woman at the well.
[2:05:52] Are you with me? And I I want to bring
[2:05:55] this story of the woman of the well so
[2:05:57] they can help us here. It says, "Here
[2:06:00] was a little old woman all blacked out
[2:06:04] here in the front, but down there
[2:06:07] was a predestinated seed.
[2:06:11] When the light
[2:06:14] comes, it's gather the darkness
[2:06:19] and it show
[2:06:22] forth. We know the Messiah is coming
[2:06:27] and when he do it does, he will show us
[2:06:31] these things.
[2:06:33] Amen. So this woman was a Hilfim woman.
[2:06:36] Are you with me? Outside according to
[2:06:40] her body, we can't see all of these
[2:06:42] things happening in her life. Are you
[2:06:44] with me? And there are different places
[2:06:46] where brother talks about why he had
[2:06:48] brought her to that place. Maybe she did
[2:06:51] not have the desire to do these things.
[2:06:53] Right? Nobody here has had the desire to
[2:06:57] begin with to sin against God.
[2:07:00] You know, sometime let's take it
[2:07:02] personal a little bit. There are mistake
[2:07:04] that you make in your life that you
[2:07:06] never intended that you would come that
[2:07:07] it would just happen. If we can be
[2:07:09] really sincere, there are things that
[2:07:12] happen to us. Sometime we wonder say,
[2:07:14] "Oh, what happened?" But God has a
[2:07:16] purpose in all things. Are you with me?
[2:07:19] God has a purpose. There are some good
[2:07:22] people. You meet them, they deal with
[2:07:24] things in their own life. You wonder,
[2:07:25] they say, "Lord, why?"
[2:07:29] But there is a purpose. Maybe tonight
[2:07:32] there is somebody has been struggling
[2:07:33] with something for a long time. You
[2:07:36] probably thinking, man, Lord, I didn't
[2:07:37] even know I was so young. I don't even
[2:07:40] know how did I get here. I don't even
[2:07:41] know how whose friend I was hanging out
[2:07:43] with. This just happened so quick. I
[2:07:45] don't know.
[2:07:47] Maybe you crying tonight. You came this
[2:07:49] morning. You praying. You say, "Lord, I
[2:07:51] don't know. I'm just tired of this." How
[2:07:53] many of us are tired of things in our
[2:07:54] life?
[2:07:57] Maybe like, "I try. I don't know what is
[2:07:59] going on. I I'm I'm tired.
[2:08:04] But don't worry,
[2:08:07] the seed is still there.
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] It will speak for itself.
[2:08:15] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Glory to God. Oh
[2:08:18] my. I love the Lord. Love the Lord.
[2:08:20] Praise the Lord. Now, the next one,
[2:08:22] investment. I'm coming to close soon
[2:08:24] here.
[2:08:27] The little woman at the well. Are you
[2:08:29] with me? Yeah. The little woman at the
[2:08:31] well was about uh what about her? She
[2:08:35] certainly had an
[2:08:38] investment when she come out there in
[2:08:41] all her immoral immor immorals. The
[2:08:45] church, watch what the prophet is saying
[2:08:47] here. He says the church has got her in
[2:08:50] such a place till she didn't know where
[2:08:54] she was.
[2:08:56] Maybe because of a religious spirit.
[2:09:00] that had affected her in a way or
[2:09:02] another. Who knows what, right?
[2:09:08] And so she just went to prostitution,
[2:09:11] but a simply and humble heart, right? Do
[2:09:15] you see this? It says this may be a
[2:09:18] great world word. And I want you I I
[2:09:21] want you to take it right. She was
[2:09:25] predestinated
[2:09:27] to eternal life.
[2:09:29] Even in that condition,
[2:09:33] that's right. Even in that condition,
[2:09:37] you will look at her say, "No, I don't.
[2:09:38] How many priests of that day
[2:09:42] looked at her and say, "What kind of
[2:09:44] woman is this?"
[2:09:46] But when God looked at that woman, he
[2:09:49] saw a seed. He says God look looked at
[2:09:53] himself.
[2:09:54] God looked at himself in the seat form
[2:09:57] in the soul of that woman.
[2:10:00] He says I can't see my identity there. I
[2:10:03] struggling but I can see something. You
[2:10:06] cannot see it. I cannot see it. I don't
[2:10:09] know. Yeah. But this moment, this
[2:10:13] morning or this afternoon, there is
[2:10:15] somebody here that is the seed of God.
[2:10:19] I want to remind you, you are a seed of
[2:10:21] God.
[2:10:23] Amen. Hallelujah. You must be, you may
[2:10:26] be down in sin. You don't even know how
[2:10:28] to come out of it. You are a seed of
[2:10:31] God. Thank you, Jesus. If you don't want
[2:10:32] to believe it for yourself, I believe it
[2:10:34] for you.
[2:10:37] Yes.
[2:10:40] My belief will never stop God. God
[2:10:42] remains God. Hallelujah.
[2:10:47] Hallelujah.
[2:10:50] Amen.
[2:10:52] The woman The women came to. Let me
[2:10:54] continue. Oh wow. I just broke my watch.
[2:10:57] It's okay. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:01] All the father has given me will come.
[2:11:05] She had to come to for the water. Amen.
[2:11:07] and she got it but not from Jacob's
[2:11:11] well.
[2:11:12] This water that she was seeking, it was
[2:11:14] not for Jacob's well.
[2:11:17] Can you imagine? You would probably
[2:11:18] imagine that she was coming to seek for
[2:11:21] water, but God, it was not the she was
[2:11:24] always coming. He said, "This is my
[2:11:26] father's well, Jacob." Right?
[2:11:29] She knew that there was something about
[2:11:31] Jacob that pretends to meet her.
[2:11:35] But it was just beyond that water. Amen.
[2:11:37] Of that habit to come get water. Amen.
[2:11:40] Maybe you coming to the altar in your
[2:11:42] heart this morning every time. Don't
[2:11:44] stop come to coming to the water. To the
[2:11:46] well.
[2:11:50] Don't stop coming to the well.
[2:11:54] Don't stop coming to the well. Keep
[2:11:56] coming.
[2:11:59] That's right. Keep claiming it in your
[2:12:00] soul. I am a seed of God. I am a son of
[2:12:03] God. I am a daughter of God. Satan, you
[2:12:05] have no authority over my life. You must
[2:12:08] claim it until something come. You will
[2:12:11] come in contact with the word.
[2:12:14] When I said the word, I'm talking about
[2:12:16] the same Christ. Jesus Christ was in
[2:12:19] flesh there. Jesus Christ is now in the
[2:12:22] word form.
[2:12:24] As we preaching like this, you are
[2:12:26] meeting Jesus Christ the same as that
[2:12:28] woman at the well. Because he is the
[2:12:31] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[2:12:33] cannot limit him to what Jesus was in
[2:12:35] Galilee. He has resurrected among the
[2:12:37] dead. He's alive this morning.
[2:12:41] That's right. The same Jesus Christ.
[2:12:45] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:12:48] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:50] The same Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:12:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:12:56] No man can come except the father calls
[2:12:59] him and all that he has given me will
[2:13:02] come and will raise him up at the last
[2:13:05] day. Those who he forneew he called.
[2:13:08] Those who he had called he justified.
[2:13:11] Those who are justified, sanctified and
[2:13:12] already
[2:13:15] he's glorified.
[2:13:18] This is the woman of the well. Mhm. You
[2:13:20] know the conversation you can you can
[2:13:21] read at home. Quotes number John chapter
[2:13:25] 5. Verily verily I John 5:4. Verily
[2:13:29] verily I said unto you, he that hear my
[2:13:31] word and believe on him that sent me has
[2:13:35] eternal life.
[2:13:37] Maybe you hearing the word of God. If
[2:13:39] you
[2:13:41] believe you have eternal life.
[2:13:45] Are you with me? Look what the prophet
[2:13:47] says here. The seat shall not be held
[2:13:48] with a shock. Really quick, it says,
[2:13:50] "But the original interpretation of the
[2:13:52] word, he that believeth my word and will
[2:13:55] believe on him that sent me." It says,
[2:13:57] "He that
[2:13:59] understandeth that is," watch this, who
[2:14:03] it's made known to.
[2:14:08] I just
[2:14:10] Jesus said, "No man can come right to me
[2:14:14] except my father has joined him. And all
[2:14:18] that my father has given me, they will
[2:14:20] come.
[2:14:22] My sheep, my
[2:14:25] doves,
[2:14:27] hears my voice.
[2:14:29] A stranger, they will not follow.
[2:14:33] What is the voice of God is the word of
[2:14:38] God. Amen. When you are sitting here
[2:14:41] hearing the word that you hear the great
[2:14:43] shepherd, not me, the word. Amen. Praise
[2:14:47] God. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory to God. It
[2:14:51] says is the word of God. What's any
[2:14:54] man's voice but his word.
[2:14:58] It's the word of God. They will hear the
[2:15:02] word of God.
[2:15:06] Amen. Are you hearing the word of God
[2:15:07] this morning?
[2:15:10] Thank you. Oh, the elect hearing the
[2:15:12] voice
[2:15:14] of the great shepherd. When you're
[2:15:17] listening to the tape, you're not
[2:15:19] listening to a voice of a man. This is
[2:15:22] God speaking to you.
[2:15:25] Amen. This is God speaking to you.
[2:15:30] Oh, glory to God. Amen. A name. When you
[2:15:33] are called by name, right? Amen. Your
[2:15:36] name is your identity,
[2:15:38] right? Amen. Your name is your heritage.
[2:15:41] It's an heritage. They can't trace your
[2:15:43] family lineage by your name. You know,
[2:15:47] in in the Congo, if you have a name
[2:15:49] like, you know, start with the chi, we
[2:15:51] know where you're coming from. You know,
[2:15:53] the Kunis are laughing, but it's true.
[2:15:55] You know, if you have all the chi before
[2:15:56] that, we know exactly. Ah, yeah. This
[2:15:58] one is you know if you have a people can
[2:16:01] identify where you coming from just by
[2:16:04] the way your name begin. Huh? Yeah. Oh
[2:16:07] yes.
[2:16:09] The purpose your purpose in life your
[2:16:11] destiny is attached to your name.
[2:16:16] Your character you know even in the
[2:16:19] Bible the Hebrew mothers they would call
[2:16:22] babies they will mention their name. He
[2:16:24] will position. He will position them in
[2:16:27] the promised land. So a name has a
[2:16:30] purpose behind all of these things. Are
[2:16:32] you with me? Oh, let me let me come to
[2:16:34] an end here. Sister, you can give us the
[2:16:37] the following quotes there. 10. I'm
[2:16:40] coming to the end now. Oh, I I like
[2:16:44] this. This is a personal experience.
[2:16:48] You know when when I I mentioned the the
[2:16:51] when I put the title call by name right
[2:16:55] every single one of us has a name. Is
[2:16:57] that right? Amen. But when men sin in
[2:17:00] the garden of Eden there were name that
[2:17:03] were written in the book. Is that right?
[2:17:06] When you read your Bible you don't see
[2:17:09] your name Ariel there. Of course though
[2:17:11] my name is there. It's in the Bible.
[2:17:15] But there is something that you when you
[2:17:18] read it, you see yourself.
[2:17:21] That's a calling of your name. Amen.
[2:17:24] Because how many of us had done
[2:17:27] something wrong? It happened to me. You
[2:17:29] read the Bible, there's a very same
[2:17:30] story that is related to you. Someone
[2:17:34] that in other words, you heard your
[2:17:35] name. That's right. Amen. Are you with
[2:17:39] me? You heard your name. Amen. Because
[2:17:41] there is something in identity that you
[2:17:43] something you have done. You see it
[2:17:45] here.
[2:17:46] You can look at the character of the
[2:17:48] Bible. You see yourself in it. How many
[2:17:50] of us have seen that? Amen. So you see
[2:17:52] when I'm talking about call by name, I'm
[2:17:55] talking about when you are reading this,
[2:17:58] you see yourself.
[2:18:01] You understand what I'm saying? Because
[2:18:02] it is calling your name. Every time that
[2:18:05] a minister comes and pastor preach about
[2:18:06] something, there is something that you
[2:18:08] go home with. That belongs to you. Amen.
[2:18:12] You have heard your name. Amen. Are you
[2:18:14] with me? Now watch this. I love this.
[2:18:17] Oh, God is so wonderful. Amen. Says,
[2:18:19] "Now, brother Brandham, is is it the
[2:18:22] truth that every Jew born since Christ
[2:18:25] came will be saved?" That's a question
[2:18:27] that they ask brother. "And who are the
[2:18:31] 144,000?"
[2:18:34] And the uh are they the predestinated
[2:18:36] ones to be sealed with the Holy Ghost
[2:18:38] and what is their missions? Is that
[2:18:40] right? There about three question that's
[2:18:43] what brother Bham says now there are
[2:18:44] about three question in one there. But
[2:18:47] here first one is it true that every Jew
[2:18:51] born since Christ that came into the
[2:18:54] world is to be saved. Let's continue a
[2:18:56] little bit. It says
[2:18:58] no. Nothing will be nothing will be
[2:19:01] saved only.
[2:19:03] Only only those whose name were put
[2:19:08] what? On the lamb's book of life before
[2:19:10] the foundation of the world. Jew or
[2:19:12] gentile. It says the book
[2:19:17] holds that mystery. Amen. What? What
[2:19:20] mystery? There's a mystery of because if
[2:19:23] the book when man sin he lost the
[2:19:25] authority lost the title did the book
[2:19:27] went back to the original owner which
[2:19:29] was God himself. Are you with me? Amen.
[2:19:31] But our names were written in that book
[2:19:34] and we saw that God is revealing himself
[2:19:37] little by little. Right now we have the
[2:19:40] full Bible here. When you are reading
[2:19:41] today you are seeing yourself right but
[2:19:44] you must be able to see your name. Now
[2:19:46] after the book the opening of the seal
[2:19:49] it should have an effect to know our
[2:19:52] name.
[2:19:53] The opening of the seal has something in
[2:19:56] it. Let's just read it for a few minutes
[2:19:58] here. Are you with me? I want you to pay
[2:20:00] attention. I don't want you to miss
[2:20:01] this.
[2:20:04] It says the book hold that mystery and
[2:20:08] the book is only unfolding it now. Amen.
[2:20:14] Are you with me? Amen. The book that
[2:20:18] Adam lost in the Garden of Eden
[2:20:20] is open. Amen. Amen. It was sealed, but
[2:20:25] now it's open. Now watch this. It says
[2:20:29] unfolding it
[2:20:31] now not each
[2:20:34] one's one's name but what the mystery of
[2:20:40] the book is
[2:20:43] we will continue just just continue
[2:20:46] while it's calling those names are you
[2:20:49] with me you finally understand that now
[2:20:52] see the watch now what brother Bham is
[2:20:55] helping us to see clearly it says the
[2:20:58] book does not say now leave veil is to
[2:21:02] be saved in time of this church age or n
[2:21:07] devil or whoever it says no he don't say
[2:21:11] that he says he just s the
[2:21:16] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[2:21:21] thing is so when the book is open you
[2:21:26] can see your name in the book because
[2:21:29] you feel a relationship between you and
[2:21:31] the book.
[2:21:34] So he's not mentioning your name as
[2:21:36] Peterson. No,
[2:21:39] it's when the book is broken. When the
[2:21:42] seals are open, you read and you see
[2:21:44] your name.
[2:21:46] We will continue. Oh, glory to God. I
[2:21:48] feel good. I feel good. Oh my
[2:21:52] But we ourself by faith believe it.
[2:21:57] That's what I say the other night. Let's
[2:21:59] continue really fast, sister. I need to
[2:22:01] close. Now there was nothing in heaven
[2:22:06] that could have done it. Now it's
[2:22:08] talking about John. You know John was
[2:22:10] crying because nobody was able to open
[2:22:13] the book. The book was sealed. Right?
[2:22:16] Watch this.
[2:22:18] You know, John looked in the book, the
[2:22:22] Bible. So, that book was the Bible. Are
[2:22:26] we reading it together? It says the
[2:22:29] Bible. Wait a minute. We find that he
[2:22:32] saw there was no one upon the earth that
[2:22:36] was able was worthy to open the book,
[2:22:40] the book of redemption. So, the book
[2:22:43] held the name of those that will be
[2:22:46] saved and brought back.
[2:22:49] Amen.
[2:22:52] And there was nobody in heaven worthy.
[2:22:57] Nobody that was beneath the earth and
[2:22:59] nowhere was able and worthy to take the
[2:23:01] book to loose the seal or to even look
[2:23:04] on it. And he wept because in this book
[2:23:11] was the book of redemption.
[2:23:13] His own name was in there. Nobody was
[2:23:19] worthy. He's crying because nobody was
[2:23:22] able to open so he can see his name.
[2:23:25] That's Revelation chapter 5. Amen.
[2:23:28] Hallelujah. Do you understand what I'm
[2:23:30] saying?
[2:23:31] Let let's go to the following one. I'm
[2:23:33] going to close with this. Do you love
[2:23:34] the Lord? Amen. Can you give him a hand
[2:23:37] if you love him?
[2:23:40] He's worthy to be praised.
[2:23:42] Hallelujah. It looks like we having a
[2:23:44] revival this morning.
[2:23:47] Oh God.
[2:23:51] 13. I'm going to close with this. And oh
[2:23:55] John who had been standing there our
[2:23:58] brother crying. It says why? He said
[2:24:02] everything in heaven, everything in the
[2:24:04] earth and everything in the sea heard me
[2:24:07] all. Amen. Amen. Blessed and honor and
[2:24:10] mighty and power be to him that live
[2:24:13] forever ever. Now watch what says. It
[2:24:17] says talk about a happy time.
[2:24:21] When them seal broke it says John must
[2:24:26] have looked in and see a oh seeing a
[2:24:30] past the curtain of time and said there
[2:24:34] is John in the book.
[2:24:36] Oh my John saw himself.
[2:24:41] So the Bible says they sung a new song.
[2:24:45] After you see your name in the book, you
[2:24:48] change your way of worship.
[2:24:51] Thank you.
[2:24:53] Amen. You change the way you worship
[2:24:56] because he had a you know John was not
[2:24:58] able even to look at the book. No. After
[2:25:00] the opening of the book, after the
[2:25:02] opening of the seal, John says he said
[2:25:05] the angel told him, "Go take the book
[2:25:07] from your angel." He went over there and
[2:25:09] took the book, even at it.
[2:25:12] Amen. At this moment, John is ready to
[2:25:15] take the book.
[2:25:17] Huh? Let me tell you this morning before
[2:25:19] I close, you have the right to take the
[2:25:22] book.
[2:25:24] [Applause]
[2:25:26] You are now more than able to take the
[2:25:29] book. is at your disposal.
[2:25:32] You want to take the book, that's the
[2:25:34] message of the hour that is being
[2:25:35] preached.
[2:25:39] Amen. Hallelujah. The book is no longer
[2:25:42] closed. The mystery of your life where
[2:25:44] you came from has been revealed before
[2:25:46] you. If you not bent for the opening of
[2:25:48] the seal, we would not know these
[2:25:50] things. Right? You know these things. So
[2:25:53] that gives you the ability to rejoice.
[2:25:56] Hallelujah. You want to give glory to
[2:25:58] his name. Can we stand on our feet now?
[2:26:02] Oh, glory to God.
[2:26:06] Oh,

[2:26:10] where my savior died.

[2:33:27] with and to give us liberty. Father,
[2:33:30] Lord, we ask these things. May you come
[2:33:33] tonight, this afternoon, and bless us
[2:33:35] abundantly as we're about to return
[2:33:37] home. Lord, we give you the glory and
[2:33:39] honor as we pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:33:43] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[2:33:48] [Applause]
[2:34:02] Praise the Lord. Lord, I believe that
[2:34:05] was good word. Amen. Yes, that was good
[2:34:08] word. That was that was timely. I I
[2:34:11] needed that myself. Amen. I needed that.
[2:34:14] That was timely. You know, sometimes I
[2:34:16] had on my mind what I wanted to speak. I
[2:34:18] was studing on the plane, but my body
[2:34:20] was telling me you can't do this to me.
[2:34:23] Amen. They kept telling me, "You can't
[2:34:26] do this to me." So when when brother
[2:34:29] picked me up last night, I said, "Son,
[2:34:30] you got to step in for me. My body is
[2:34:33] telling me that I can't do this." And
[2:34:34] I'm glad that uh the Lord spoke to us.
[2:34:38] You know uh uh he read that quote word u
[2:34:41] what Brandon said is the word that comes
[2:34:43] predestinated. That's very important.
[2:34:46] You know that's very important. People
[2:34:48] believe that you baptize in Jesus name.
[2:34:50] You are predestinated because you
[2:34:52] believe the message of the hour. And uh
[2:34:54] and we have find in late time these are
[2:34:56] the very same people turn it against the
[2:34:58] word. Now what that literally means is
[2:35:02] taking the word serious. That what it
[2:35:05] means. That what it means. Taking the
[2:35:08] word serious. When you see your name in
[2:35:12] the book, you take God's word serious.
[2:35:15] That's right. That's right.
[2:35:17] Yeah. You take God's word serious. You
[2:35:19] take everything his word says. You take
[2:35:21] it serious. Even when you are not up to
[2:35:24] it, you say, "Lord, your word is truth.
[2:35:26] Give me grace." Amen. Amen.
[2:35:30] You you you constantly confess that the
[2:35:32] word is true. I believe help my own
[2:35:35] belief.
[2:35:37] That's good. That's what it is. It's not
[2:35:40] just a a church membership that make you
[2:35:43] predestinated. All born by message
[2:35:45] parents that make you predestinated. No,
[2:35:47] it's that word. What it means is that
[2:35:51] God's thought concerning you will haunt
[2:35:54] you the rest of your life. You can't get
[2:35:56] away from it.
[2:36:00] But it also brings you to that place,
[2:36:02] that place where you realize, okay, this
[2:36:04] is God and I need to give him. Be it
[2:36:09] unto me. I call into your word.
[2:36:12] Praise the Lord. Let's just think that
[2:36:15] this afternoon. Be it unto me and I call
[2:36:17] into your word.
[2:36:20] Amen. Be it onto me.
[2:36:25] I call into your
[2:36:30] word. I call into your
[2:36:35] promises. I can stand
[2:36:40] secure and cast
[2:36:45] upon the truth that sets me free.
[2:36:51] I call to your word, oh Lord. Be it unto
[2:36:59] me.
[2:37:01] Yes. Be it unto
[2:37:05] me. I call into your
[2:37:10] word. I call into your promises.
[2:37:17] I can stand
[2:37:21] secure. Cath upon my
[2:37:25] heart. This truth that sets me
[2:37:30] free. I call into your word, oh Lord. Be
[2:37:37] it all. One more time now. Yes. be it
[2:37:43] all to
[2:37:45] me. I call into your
[2:37:50] word. I call
[2:37:53] into those
[2:37:56] promises. I can stand
[2:37:59] [Music]
[2:38:02] secure upon my
[2:38:05] heart the truth that sets me free.
[2:38:11] I call to your word, oh
[2:38:16] Lord, be it all to me.
[2:38:21] While Jesus were with them, he said to
[2:38:23] them, "Don't rejoice because you casting
[2:38:26] that devil. Rejoice because your name is
[2:38:28] in the book." John never understood
[2:38:30] that. It went over his head.
[2:38:33] But on the island of Patmos, he saw now
[2:38:37] he saw the importance of what Jesus
[2:38:39] said, "Your name is in the
[2:38:43] book." And he wanted to see
[2:38:48] it. There are a lot of things that go
[2:38:50] over our head, but at that appointed
[2:38:53] time, God brings it to our attention. He
[2:38:57] makes it real to
[2:39:00] us because there is a season and a time
[2:39:03] for everything. The Lord bless you. We
[2:39:06] will see you on Wednesday night. Let's
[2:39:08] go in the peace of the Lord and uh
[2:39:10] continue to pray for our deacon
[2:39:12] brothers, brother Ben and uh uh and his
[2:39:16] wife, Sister Alice. Uh they should be

[2:39:26] hopefully by God's grace. Brother Dan
[2:39:28] also uh is going to Ghana. So let's
[2:39:32] remember them in prayer and uh and pray
[2:39:35] for me. I really I really need prayers.
