bless you good to be in the house of the Lord may have your seat just for the [Music] while while we stay under the spirit of worship this morning we just want [Music] to bring few uh announcement to us here praise the Lord praise the Lord we want to thank uh each and every one of you for all of your prayers I think the Lord has given us the opportunity to to spend some time in prayer as as that's the way we begin our services this year we all the flu um illnesses that was going around but it created a a Praying environment and I think uh it's beginning to be a blessing amen because uh one of the ways that you can know that the people are praying when it's easy you can know that people are praying when it's easy for you to get in prayer amen you know that people are praying because uh they are creating an atmosphere and it just make it easy for others to enter so I think uh the Lord is beginning to bless us with a Praying atmosphere and and I will encourage us to continue to pray keep the prayer meeting going on in your home and meeting uh uh with with the Lord and praying together and all the little prayer meeting that that keeps going on I think brother Lawrence brother arel they have one going on together that's beautiful let's just keep the prayer chain going it's a blessing amen I was listening to uh uh an old preacher yesterday that revivalist he said uh we build altars uh onto the lord it's a memorial when we are spending time with the Lord in prayer amen he say it it comes it comes in times when we need it so I think it's a beautiful thing let's continue to to invest in prayer uh you know uh those that are praying and uh and fasting that's a beautiful thing don't go on the hunger stack make sure you are spending time with the Lord amen you are reading his word you know that in the book of Chronicle the Bible says if my people that I called by my name will humble themselves and prayed and it also says if they will seek my face so there is another level of praying you know we have to seek his face that's when we come into communion you know uh we come into communion with the Lord so let's uh let's continue to do that I'm praying that and hoping that the Lord bless us on the first Sunday of March in the evening we might have a communion service that will be uh on the second of March if the Lord bless us we will have a communion service and then on um on the weekend that followed there that would be the 8 and nine we have a friend from uh from the UK originally from Zimbabwe that's Brother Joseph chosi uh known brother chosi uh 2003 I think that was the first time we met went for that convention that's the convention I went for and never went back home and uh from that outbreak of w in in the ARA 2002 not three 2002 that was the first time we met and and uh it's been a good time of uh of friendship that we have had over the years and uh uh uh so he was coming to the states and he he called and asked that you love to come and visit visit with us so he will be coming on the 7th of March uh and then uh uh the 8 and N he will spend that weekend with us so we're hoping to have a service on uh Saturday night and Sunday morning with our friend and uh as we as we always uh encouraged to come on the expectation to every service and uh I think brother Brooks and the Saints down in Iowa are thinking about cancering their service that weekend so we might have a full house if uh if they do that they want to come down and and support the services so for those of them that will be able to come if they choose to do that we might have a full house so we just pray that the Lord will will work everything well brother Daryl W from uh uh uh Tennessee will be coming in July we have not set up dates here but he will be with brother Joe Pasco in U uh Wisconsin so he just text me if he can be able to come and see us after so many years so we are hoping also to have our brother and uh we will let you know when all of that work out so uh uh we just want to continue praying for our brother uh the family in meerca there in uh Michigan that lost their children we want to continue to keep our brother and his wife sister lace in prayer that uh the Lord will continue to strengthen and give them the strength that they need praise the Lord amen amen so uh I think that's all we have uh uh by the way of announcement and uh so we will just uh uh continue to go ahead with uh our service worship and uh turn to the preaching of the word the Lord bless you let's just stand on our feet let's just stand on our feet oh praise the Lord

morning and we want to greet everyone that is streaming into the service uh we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Genesis chapter 1 we read from verse one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and bound and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of of the water and God said let there be light and there was light amen amen 1 Samuel chapter 18 1 Samuel chapter 18 what I wanted to do with this subject actually I wanted to to just go uh through uh The Bible History and be able to show it but I realized that I could spend the rest of the year keep talking about this we you want to read 1 Samuel chapter 18 I just want to I just want to pick up something here let's read verse 10 let's read verse 10 the chapter It's A Beautiful chapter of the book it's a beautiful book and it came to pass on the tomal it came to pass on the tomal this is right after the the victory of uh uh David killing golah if we will just drop back a little bit just uh so we can be to pick up some context here verse 7 and the women answer one another as they played and said Saul have slain his thousand and David his 10,000 and Saul was rough and the saying dis pleased him and he said they have ascribe unto David 10,000 and to me they have a stri but thousand and what can he have more than the kingom and and saw I David from that they forward are we in first Sam am I reading the right place okay I keep your Bible Pages moving so I thought I told you something different and saw I David from that day forward uh from that day and forward and it came to pass on the morrow that the spirit that the evil spirit from God Came Upon Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house he have an evil spirit on him but yet he's prophesying and David play with his hands as at another time and there was a javelin in Saul's hand and sa cast the javelin for he said I will smack David even to the war with it and David a out of his presence twice let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we give you the praise we give you the glory and honor we want to ask that Lord you bless bless your word father as we pray earlier Lord God let something be said of internal value something oh god father Lord and more than just a lecture oh god father Lord and that something oh God will remain on our mind something that Lord we can go out of the building meditating on something we can apply by in the week something oh god father we can take to our heart and says that the Lord spoke to me

us now as we Fellowship together in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat again we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Wednesday night we started this little uh uh uh subject uh the effect of the move of God the Bible says uh uh uh uh the spirit of God move amen the SP spirit of God move in the beginning the spirit of God mov upon the water and God just just imagine now uh uh the Bible says the entire Earth was covered with Darkness you know then water was upon the face of the deep praise the Lord and the spirit of God moved so the move of God uh uh brought a change and I believe that if we will allow the spirit of God to move this morning praise the Lord our Darkness will be blown the away amen praise the Lord I mean God will settle a whole lot of things in our life if we would just allow the spirit to move so I say it unto you let the spirit move amen praise the Lord let the spirit of God move let the Lord have his way the Bible says where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so let the spirit move move praise the Lord let us not hold him back in our mind let's not hold him back in you know in our spirit uh uh with uh with uh I mean uh doubts or suspiciousness let's just allow the spirit to move amen we have to believe that God is in control amen he's in control of our life he's in control of everything that is going on and we want to thank him for that praise the Lord so let the spirit move this morning amen can you agree with me can we say it together let the spirit move can you just say it to yourself let the spirit move praise the Lord let the Lord have his Liberty amen may he speak to us this morning we been talking about the effect of the move of God when God moved in the beginning we said on Wednesday night he condescended being the great in of God that filled all time and space he moved towards time he moved towards Time by descending he moved towards Time by condensing himself God took a form he never had a form you have to realize that this God that you and myself are are you know are dealing with the one we are talking about the one we are worshiping uh uh he's a God that fill all time in all space praise the Lord hallelujah but for him to have a creation uh uh uh with with a great plan of redemption in his mind he choose to take a form and he condemns himself praise the Lord and then he has to move towards his own creation he has to move towards time and the Bible says and the spirit of God move in the Deep praise the Lord hallelujah can you imagine what an effect it was when the spirit of God moved praise the Lord amen and then uh he start he he started to bring forth a creation the move of God started affecting the Earth in such a way that a creation starts to Spring forth praise the Lord he said let there be and there was hallelujah amen amen and like I said Wednesday night since God started his first move he had now stopped amen amen he have not stopped and he's not stopping for nobody praise the Lord he's going to keep moving and move right back into eternity when time is over praise the Lord when time cease God will move right back into eternity praise the Lord so he have he's he have not stop and he's not stopping for anybody praise the lord we we we need to catch up amen we need to catch up praise the Lord hallelujah amen we need to catch up because God God Is On The Move amen he's on the Move praise the Lord he's on the move so we we are uh uh we were looking at the subject of U of Revival uh from the Ephesian Church age we want to read that one more time and uh uh because that's that is our inspiration on this thought have you ever studied the history of Revival and I and I will I will encourage all of you students you know all of you uh uh students of the word that love to study you know uh uh uh especially you ministers Brothers study the the the history of Revival praise the Lord amen study the history of Revival because when you when you study that and you you you begin to understand you will realize that some of the things that is happening in our ranks or in our day is not strange they have happened in Revival and I was talking to a preacher friend of mine that uh you know uh uh he left the message and uh we were talking a couple of weeks ago and and uh and so I brought the same thought to him you know as his well you know you realize that uh uh when you when you begin to study uh history uh uh church history you realize that that most of these things are not strange every Revival have these things he said yeah brother one I realized that because recently lately that's what I've been doing I said well you know I didn't say it to him directly but I said well that's where we should have started from amen you know that's where we should have started from if you ever studied the history of Revival uh now a Revival signify a move of God in power that's what Revival is is God moving you know in powered is God moving upon the people praise the lord it's it's it's just not the big crowd amen it's not the thousands of people it's not the Crusade it's it's wonderful if God can ever move us to do anything like that that would be beautiful but the the the Revival actually is when God is moving in power and that power is having an effect on the people amen it's having an effect to bring a result praise the Lord so is is God moving in power and what we learn is that every time God move Satan is there to move also praise the Lord amen pray you don't you don't need a big crusade to see that look in your own life look in your own home amen whenever God is beginning to do something out of the blue something come up some kind of a misunderstanding some some kind of a argument some kind of a distraction I mean now every time God move the devil is there to move you don't have to go and watch over rvel meeting not Billy Graham meeting you can look in your own life whenever God is moving and beginning to bless you and beginning to give you access to his word access to his presence all help break loose right amen all help break loose sometime even the dishes in the kitchen start falling praise the Lord amen every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fail it never fail and it will never fail praise the Lord it never fail and it will never never fail praise the Lord as a as as a Christian you you have to wash that we we have to wash that amen we have to watch that Christian life is not a careless life it's a disciplined life right that's right it's a discipline life you have to be on your guide you have to watch your surrounding you have to watch the things that are happening in your life in your home around your family you have to pay attention to it amen it never fails and then so we see this also knowing there every time God move Satan move in the days of the wel Revival praise the Lord and most people don't know this now you you realize that that the Welsh Revival you know uh uh influence Aza if you know stud a little bit of church history Influence azuza People was getting report you know what uh from what was happening there and then there were there were since also you know that were spending time and praying and praying that was how azuza broke out but this is what I want you to watch now as we as we look at this together just watch this now in the wor Revival most people don't know this the insane asylum fill up quickly and there was a great displayed of devil power to take away the attention from God now I I I I I got book recently uh I was I was reading the uh uh a testimony of of one of the original guys preacher that was there at azuza even before William Simon came he was there in California when they were receiving all of this report from the wor Revival and this exact statement he made made he made this exact statement he said just at the time where the the Holy Spirit was beginning to break among us we saw devil power moving and it's not like people were chanting no it was people on a religious spirit that had not been birthed yet they had not been born again but their are Spirit were affected and it started all sorts of funny manifestation he said this very same thing the displayed of devil powers to take away the attention from God now that was the W Revival look at this also it is written that in Wesley days H the westem Revival the people who do most peculiar thing there were definitely of Satan to try to Mark the goodness of the power of God now these are not just unbelievers that are trying to Mock and make fun these are people that claim to believe but what they are doing is that they are impersonating they are impersonating because when you impersonate godliness it does not affect praise the Lord pray the soon the person that is watching you is going to know that thing is not genuine because you are just uh H H professing godliness yet then the next time again I mean you I mean you are swearing like the word is on fire praise the Lord it confuses the person are we together now watch also that was the wesle Revival look here now in Luther's day this was in Luther Revival in Germany it is said that the miracle of his ministry did not Li in the fact that he successfully protest the Roman Catholic church but the miracle lied in the father heo and did stay sound in the midst stay sound and S am missst their fanatism now that's another one that's another one that's the destruction praise the Lord amen remember that if the devil came pull you back he will push you forward he push you into fanatism if he can't pull you back into the word he push you forward so you see that's that's that that's that's that's what was happening and and and and zwing and and all of these guys that that have influence our Amish people our Jehovah Witness and uh and uh uh seven day Advantage they they all they were all born out of that zling became so zelous he said what Luther is saying is truth but if Luther believe it why will he still be listening to the king that's why they don't salute the flare praise the Lord what saluting the flare or not Sal what does that have to do with your salvation what does that have to do with your salvation if you don't use modern things what does that have to do with your salvation I don't believe in cell phone I don't believe in this I don't if if there is not a birth and not a change in you praise the Lord so you see they ran ahead they ran ahead out of out of zeal uh uh uh uh uh Manor Simon he started the menonite mov movement he would not go with zling he would not come back to Luther he started his own movement fanatism are we together amen so you see every time God moves the devil moves also are we together so you see we see that under the Welsh Revival we see it on the on the Wesley Revival we see it on the Luther Day Revival uh uh uh you know fanatism and God gave him the grace to to you know to keep sound uh in the midst of fanatism who were often fail with and gaed by wrong spirit fanatism that were gathered by wrong Spirit praise the Lord and even today is stay gathered by wrong Spirit are we together and if you if you have uh uh uh uh okay I mean he's bringing it down now to uh to our day and if you have been aware of this last day Ministry you will have not the same invasion of evil and wicked Spirits evil and wicked Spirit have invaded the Revival praise the Lord that all we need is just put a Huffman picture one place put brother Brandon picture one place and you have a message church that's all we need there is no emphasis on the Holy Ghost there is no emphasis on new birth praise the Lord that's all we need we just need to put a pillow of fire P the P the Huffman head and and uh you know we use the the uh uh print the the paramid seven step we print that one print the church ages put the messenger up there we just decorate the world with all the you know uh the Supernatural and and we have a message Church no emphasis on uh on uh uh uh uh cleaning up our life living right praying seeking the face of God now I'm not against those things I'm just trying to tell you how our Revival has been invaded by evil and wicked Spirit praise the Lord amen I'll tell you some of the things that are done that that that that are done in the name of religion I mean it's surprising that we can still be sitting here believing the message of the hour it can it's surprising that we can still be sitting here striving you know uh uh uh on uh a message of Holiness and godliness because when you think about some of the things some of the abuses that have been done in the in in in the religious ring couple of days ago how did I go here praise the Lord I feel like pouring this water over my head would it be a nice thing to do I feel like just turning Buttle over my head it looks like I need to cool my head down because I don't know where how I got to this place but I pray that the Lord will something will be said that will be a blessing to you amen I don't want to come up uh come out like uh being uh an angry person this morning amen praise the Lord should we call for the deacons to lay their hands on me praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh a couple of days ago uh I came across an article listen to me now listen to me because it's all in the line of what I want to say as I go on with this series I might not get there today I came across an article and I was reading this thing of of you know all of these people that trying to Blackmail the message and this and this uh brother posted this thing of this lady she wrote in uh uh I will mention her name she wrote in and and uh uh just saying how she grew up around the Brandon family and how she was a good friend to Rebecca and Sarah and you know they would go over to brother Bron house so I'm I'm reading and I'm watching in my mind you know I'm watching now you know how you want to you want to see what the person really want to say in my mind I'm thinking okay is she going to bring out something like brother Brandon was fussing with his wife or you know uh or something like that you know she just talk about how you know brother Brandon was very nice to them and they were good and all of that and and but she said I should begin to grow and and uh you know and listening to the message there being in brandham Tabernacle and uh then she got on the marriage and div voice think you you know and and you know and and brother Brandon what he preached on marriage and divorce and some of the things he said and and he say oh yeah you know how he was horrible you know horrible things he said about women you know and uh and she he just she just went off and I sat there and uh I felt I felt sorry for the lady I felt sorry for the lady the reason why I felt sorry for the lady is because because if you don't have God in your heart and you don't have Revelation if you pick up marriage and divorce you will not believe that brother brandham had a wife you won't believe that he had two daughters you won praise the Lord amen a sister read marriage and divorce some time ago and uh uh I don't know I think she called me or we were talking on the phone and she told me she said uh I just I just listened to marish and devil she said wow that was a tough one you know but then she said something to me that that kind of a bless me you know she said if if I remember the words right she says I uh you know but i' I've made my choice to stay with the word you know this was somebody that was not in brandham Tabernacle this was somebody that was not born in the message this was somebody that uh I never saw brother Brandon praise the Lord that just listened to a marriage and D step but yet Grace was there for them to be able to see something that spoke to their heart praise the Lord amen now uh so that's that's what I want us to to to kind of look at the the effect of the move of God because this move of God like in every age it has a way of affecting us praise the Lord it can affect us for the good it can also affect us for the B because it's right in the church and right you know around this things sometimes we can be we can be affected by the way people do things and I know Young people you know that it it so affect their faith that they cannot go above you know what they have seen or what they have heard or what the person has done to them their faith just stay in that negative realm for the rest of their life and they just believe that that's all it's about praise the Lord amen sometimes it's not only from the pulit sometimes it is right from the life of parents we affect our children Faith because we just hold a legalist legalistic rot over them praise the Lord and all the year the message said the message said the message said but they cannot even see it in our lives are we together so we you so we see this thing that that every Revival you look at Pentecost right after the date of Pentecost 3,000 God save 3,000 when Peter came out and put his little box there and stood up and preached 3,000 God saved but do you know that in that 3,000 that God saved there was a Mis multitude praise the Lord Jude was part of that Revival Jude was there when he wrote what did he say certain men has creeped in on AW where did they came from there are 3,000 that God Sav PE some people got carried away with everybody speaking in in in different language I mean these people speaking and we are hearing oh wow wow this God are they not Galilean they are speaking my language they got excited but that that's the only thing that that caught their attention but is that enough to bring a birth praise the Lord Acts chapter 5 what the Bible says a certain man named ananas you look through the scripture just pull that word on your computer setting and see how how the Bible used that amen Acts chapter 15 The Bible also speaks of them certain men that was trying to put Judaism on the Believers that were saved uh demanding them to be circumcised and follow uh uh uh uh uh uh Jewish tradition they were trying to force things on these new Believers that have just come and the Bible called them setting men they were all from that 3,000 that were safe praise the Lord so you see this it's not it's not just following the crowd it's not just following the crowd as much as oh God oh God how how how I pray that Lord God you you just bless us and give us a church of 5,000 people but what a blessing it will be amen amen if we get all of those 5,000 people safe what a blessing it will be or we just want the numbers just to say our church praise the lord it's very strange that people don't ask brother how is the spirit of God how is the move of God in your church they ask what is the size of your church how many they don't ask how is the move of God in your church how is the power of God moving they don't ask for that they SI your church by by the Numbers praise the Lord I always like to keep it two or three praise the Lord I tell them we are under 20 it's a growing Church you know we just under 30 people I mean that's that's the way I feel glory be to God are we together I hope I hope I'm I'm I'm saying something that is that is uh that will kind of encourage you this morning amen so you see then and uh uh but when we look at the the the the the move of God the first move of God uh like like we look at on on Wednesday night when God move when he move when the spirit of God move when the spirit of God move you just let's just imagine ourself to all be uh dead elements living on the earth we we are we can't breathe we are not alive we don't know what is happening what is happening and the spirit of God just move in this building and we all comes to Consciousness praise the Lord the move of God bringing life it the move of God brought order to an earth that was in chaos that's what the move of God will do to a church it will bring order that's what the move of God would do to our life it will bring order because our God is a god of order amen that's why the move of God will do to our home it will bring order are we together we see creation coming forth and and and and uh h h h the move of God bringing for life it bringing growth uh uh uh you know uh and and and and and creating an edting creating the move of God bringing creation praise the Lord amen amen bringing creation and that's where you can appreciate the move of God upon your life when you beginning to sense spiritual growth praise the Lord that's the thing where every true son and daughter of God look for just like a mother looks for that praise the Lord even the baby that was just born in a week they pick the lip up to look for teeth it's not time for the baby to start are teeing but they are looking for teed why because they are expecting growth praise the Lord amen it's so funny they see the teeth there they put their finger to see if the baby can bite if the teeth is real amen praise the lord it's not part of the baby pour on the gum is teeth but yet they put their finger there and B my finger why is looking for growth that's what the move of God brings it brings growth that's what a Son of God will look for a daughter of God will look for our own growth it brought separation dividing light from darkness and water from the land and and that's what the move of God will do it will bring separation it will take things from our life can you imagine God bringing a creation and and everywhere is so dark and whole land covered with water praise the Lord what a chaos what a confusion it would have just been better he stayed as the great internal Spirit but here we see the move of God is is beginning to bring forth life is beginning to bring forth growth and all of there and God will start from the lowest form of life until he will get to a place where he will make a Man In His Image praise the Lord hallelujah how how I love Genesis 1:26 I love it why because Genesis 1: 12627 hold it holds a Myster concerning us praise the Lord I believe that's where the devil got jealous amen that's where Lucifer got jealous when he heard God saying let us made man in our image he got jealous praise the Lord amen because now he realized that God is going to have someone that looks like him and then he will have to worship that person because that person looks like God and that that's the reason why the devil hates the human race amen praise the Lord I mean he hat it all he want to do is just destroy it are we together and God made Man In His Image man was made a spirit God had to do it that way and that also confuses the devil because everything that God made was visible but when he made man man was was not visible man was a spirit it took time Genesis 2:7 before God will make man visible praise the Lord that's God's design amen that's God's design the devil might know the day that a child will be born but he don't know the day that that child will be saved amen praise lord the devil don't know the day that conception take place he only know when you say oh we are expecting he say oh wow he don't know that are we together so you see God God did all of that under the move of his Spirit he found a man he found a body to D him praise the Lord amen the devil he was there and I mean taking account watching everything but then he realized that when God made man in in uh in in in flesh when he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth he realized that that spirit that he used to worship started becoming quiet and this man is now taking all of the authority praise the Lord said that's what I was watching there because he said he making that man in His image and in his likeness then the attack Begins the plan for the fall begins praise the Lord are we together now so we see here that uh Genesis 3 comes alone and and uh uh and and and Eve was deceived by by the by by the Devil by The Serpent and uh uh and Sons were born and Sons were born I make mention of this on on the Wednesday night I want to read it that from the the semar church age when the church get away from the word word it would it it will believe anything when the church get away from the word it will believe anything when people get away from the word they will believe anything and you will be surprised some of the things that people will believe you will be surprised some of the things that people believe praise the Lord amen how can you how can you how how can you men will profess our I mean PhD how can you believe that this word with all the order and design that it has came out of nothing praise the Lord for you to get order and design you must have an intelligence you cannot get order and design without an intelligence praise the Lord you will be you will I mean it will scare you some of the things that people devote their time to and and and and all of these masan society and and different things that people believe you know they go to susers to go for luck and and somebody there you know looking wretched have not taken B for many days passing card over to tell you something about your life I mean you will not believe an invisible God you will not believe a creator of Heaven and Earth but yet you believe there is power somewhere that can be able to tell you the fortune of your life amen praise the Lord you won't believe in a creator that created your life but yet you will believe that there is a power out there that can tell you a fortune in in your life praise the Lord but that's why why Paul said in the Book of Romans because they did not believe God he gave them over to reprobate Spirits for them to believe anything praise the Lord when the church get away from the word it will believe anything it is like Eve she's a type the woman is a type of the church and there is some of the things that I mean we got wrong as as as we will go along you will realize you will realize there there a lot of thing I was I was telling something don't want to go ahead of myself I was keeping this for Wednesday night I think I better keep it for Wednesday night but as we go along you will realize that many times many time in and in in almost all the time we don't get it right the first time God designed it that way we don't get it right the first time we do a little bible studies on Wednesday night I I don't want to go ahead of myself yet because I will if I do that now then I create problem for myself the rest of the week and uh uh and and and and that is the thing because most of these things brother Brandon bring it as a type to us but instead of taking it as a type and leaving it as a type we take it and we make it rules in our homes praise the Lord amen amen the man was found before the woman we make that rule in our homes we we make it like the woman don't she done she's nothing that brother bam say she buy product she like to buy product that all she can do buy a product we take we take Divine instruction thing that supposed to give us Divine values we take it we play in the same with it then we then we wonder why our life why our family why the church is the way it is because we never got it the first time God in his Mercy has to come around and keep repeating it that's the reason why he have five for Ministry to bring it in different ways and different ways and say it over and over and over and sometimes we are just so stubborn that's my Doctrine that's the way I believe it as if to say it was born on your neighbor's tram we didn't get it the first time but we look at that on Wednesday night by God's grace by God's grace if Jesus tired amen am I come in the morning praise the Lord and then all of this thing will be over we don't have to preach again we just worship him when the church get away from the word they will believe anything is like believe when King was born she said I have gotten a man from the Lord now do you realize that she really meant that I mean it's not her fault praise the Lord amen even the the the prophet the Apostle Paul h h h h give her the credit and said she was deceived that's what the Bible said are we together she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then thought that whatever she said was right praise the Lord amen but what what is the prophet doing the prophet is not describing the life of a woman the rest of her life the prophet is taking a type when the church believe anything so he's using Eve now as a type of the church are we together he's trying brother bam tell us over and over I'm not edicated to use big words to you I preach through types and shadows so he takes stpes and Shadow to try to help us explain or understand praise the Lord how God is dealing with us are we together when the church get away from the word it would believe anything if she said that she had a man from God then she had a man from God but God has set laws in the universe praise the Lord amen it's just like when the church Church makes their holy man when the church makes a holy man it forgets that that man was born of a woman and that man is born in sin praise the Lord because the church makes its holy man it have come to believe that that man is Holy praise the lord we don't we don't think that he can make mistake the Holiness is just a title praise the lord it's just a title so that is the same that's what he's trying to say to us here because she was deceived so she established that thing in her mind until she will see otherwise praise the Lord amen amen until she will see that this man she has claimed that theing from the Lord will be killing his brother praise the Lord and that's why that's that's the thing that that you know that destroy the fate of the people instead of us to realize that well okay yeah you know this this is the man you know God has blessing but you know he's a man you know we got to be patient we got to be even care careful of him we got to pray pray with him until the man starts to live like a sinner before we realize that he were born in sin right praise the lord we gave him so much title so much Holiness so much reverence when we catch him doing something he says I don't even know how this thing came over me then he starts to behave as if to say uh he's in the spirit he's just a sinner that needs God as much as we need God praise the Lord so you see just like how Eve held to that thing in her mind that is the same thing that has affected the church throughout all the ages the church hold to those things in their mind they they they lift up people you know that's our Bishop that's our father that's our our Pope and what whatever they do and forget that that man spent nine months in his mother's womb praise the Lord that he was born in sin shapel in iniquity that is just a title under that title he need God praise the Lord whether he's a pastor a pope a priest whoever he is honor that title he needs God and if he don't have God he he's more he's the most dangerous person on the face of the Earth because he still right under that title he would deceive people and Destroy people home and Destroy people life that's what he's trying to show us when something is placed in our mind and we hold to it praise the Lord but what we did all through the years we make it the woman problem brother ban say Eve so that woman more problem no the church he's talking about the church he's talking about religion what happen when people are exposed to a Revival when people are exposed to the move of God praise the Lord are we together now so we see we see that thing we see that thing now yis uh yis uh uh uh King and Abel they were born in the message like we like we used to we like to say king and Abel they were born in the message they were born in their Revival praise the Lord amen amen and Eve Eve believing that she receive a man from the Lord she's suspecting King to be a minister because he's born in the message that my firstborn son he will be a minister amen praise the Lord amen I I watch I watched that boy how he loved the Lord she were expecting him to be a minister I receive a man from the Lord I think she keep in her mind praise the Lord amen are we together now I'm just trying to bring a picture to you I'm just trying to bring a picture to you so how how we can see see the uh uh uh the the the effect that is on the move of God but little Abel was a different creature also amen he was different because uh I mean uh uh there was just something started creating in his heart listen to what brother Bram was says in uh uh wisdom versus Faith the Bible says now now that's Hebrew chapter 11 Abel Hebrew 11 says Abel by faith Abel offer unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of King he being yet dead yet he speak see Abel by what wisdom by theologic by faith he offer unto God a more excellent Sacrifice by faith in what by faith in what where did he have his faith praise the Lord there just his father and his mother him and his half brother how in the word Could It Be Where could he get get it praise the Lord amen what did he have faith in he have faith in the word praise the Lord amen he have faith in the word not in all of the stories he had faith in the word are we together cuz he wanted to know why he was out of the garden he's listening to his parents so they're talking all this story in the Garden of Eden we spoke the tree into existant we call the animal this in AB mind but why are we out of the garden what really happened praise the Lord amen what really happened not just oh and I call this one L amen hallelujah lion I call this one bed oh glory to God bed and and listen to all the stories speaking things into wonderful but if God be for us where are the Miracles amen if we are serving the same God where is th God are we together he wanted to know why he was out of the garden why were we put out praise the Lord amen can you imagine mother telling him the story that you know what uh uh uh uh can you imagine one time I I was on that hill and the next day I went it was not there what what happened Daddy spoke it away he told the hill to go on the other side praise the Lord and then in Bible studies he's asking that question but why are we out praise the Lord why are we not seeing why are we not seeing all of the things that you people experience right praise the Lord that's how parents like to tell their children about how they came to the message in the days when we came to the message the things that were happening in the move of God why are we not seeing are we together brother Bram says here why were we pulled out mother will have to say because I listening to a lie of the devil because this boy year was born such and such a way that's why God put us out now she has to go to her Earnest confession she has to go to a place in her life that she don't like to talk about but is the truth because listen to the LI of the devil that begins to build faith in the heart of Abel that he has to to pay attention to the word as much as all the story of Daddy was good he had to pay attention to the word praise the Lord he has to pay attention to the word and when you listen to the devil what happened that she had to go into detail and then what happened and then God came down Daddy and myself was hiding our Serv and we could hear his voice moving in the garden now remember now King and ab are not hearing his voice they only hearing the true Adam but Adam was hearing the literal voice of God praise the Lord so King knows that to I mean Abel knows that to go back and he directly from God he must get in contact with something if that God spoke to my father he can speak to me today praise the Lord and what happened and they started to explain and God came down we were hiding ourself and we have covered ourself in fake Le and when that he looks behind the fake tree he saws a lamb skin bleeding praise the Lord as much as it will sound horrible to that young Soul something move in his heart he said that's it that's what glory be to God he can't explain it but something struck his sword that that is the way that God reconcil men back through the blood praise the Lord not through flowers and and and and and and and pred uh H houses but through the blood through the bleeding word and that thing stuck in his mind and he keeps thinking about it so for us to go back in the presence of God we need a Bloody sacrifice if God had to reconcile my parents by the blood I cannot go without the blood if I will have access to God I need the blood praise the Lord but King he was he was relying on the fact that you know I'm the first I'm a man from the Lord M I always say it I'm a man from the Lord I'm a man from the Lord no desire in him to pay attention to the word there's no Crave in Him Praise the Lord the word just go over his head for the matter of f is so boring it makes him sleepy but not Abel praise the Lord Abel desire was to go back go back to Pentecost go back to the presence of God go back to the place where the glory of God will come back praise the Lord Abel desire was to see that same God moving he wanted to hear the voice of God that was moving in the garden the Bible said the voice of God was walking he wanted to hear it praise the Lord that's the desire that was in his heart he wanted change he's tired with this a church T he want a real God are we together oh my you love the Lord praise the Lord man what a wonderful Jesus we Ser what a wonderful Jesus we serve praise the Lord so you see the effect of that Revival the the the the ones that were born in the Revival think about Noah's Revival Noah had a Revival a preacher of righteousness amen amen he stood for the word preached 12 120 years I believe right from the beginning he had a lot of people that was promising him they were will come and help him I love that thing you are doing praise the Lord he had to steal with his conviction he had to stay with his word amen the Bible called him a preacher of righteousness I've always I've always thought about that I've always thought about that the preacher of righteousness what could that means amen what could that means that's something for us as parents you might not be a preacher of righteousness but you need to be a man of righteousness and so much that your your faith will affect the life of your children the generation could not listen to Noah but yet his children believe him he had a way of bringing this thing to them this thing that he said God told him that nobody in the world believe only he alone that he got to build a boat there will be a rain the children want to go play basketball they want to be like their friends you know they want to do things like their friends but he had a way he had a way and that's what we must labor for as parents not under the rule we must find a way if you can't find it look for it on your knees God will give it to you find a way of bringing this truth glory be to God hallelujah love the Lord he wanted to go back he wanted to go back he wanted to go back into Fellowship are we together he wanted to go right back into Fellowship amen so we see there we see right there there the uh uh uh Noah and uh but then at the end of his Revival what happened after the great Revival they came through they saw the the the I mean every other person that built the boat they both sank everybody that challenged that that that that that criticized he they saw the entire world being destroyed coming from on that great Revival you will think that it will carry them all all alone some people get their trouble right at the beginning some people trouble wait for them at their are their at their later age because some people think that they in in the in the service of the Lord there is veteran praise the Lord the veteran is only for the military amen we are veteran no because the devil knows the changes in your life praise the Lord amen what the Caleb says I feel strong he said just like the day when Moses sent us to spy the land I still have that strength the Bible said as old as he was he was ready to fight and we must keep fighting until we step on the other side don't lay down your sword and say oh I have five Devils we have five devils in this message the devils are still fighting amen that's right if you think you have got your land come and help me let fight for mine there is no veteran praise the Lord and that's what is happening people just you know they just laid by they okay you know we got to take it easy now yeah I mean now you watch your health and all things but what what concerned your spiritual life you got to stal with the word don't put yourself into something kind of uh you know fanatism or some kind of you know uh uh uh you know brother Bram says all them that believe him and them that he love they will be there that's a powerful statement praise the Lord you have to look at that glory be to God you have to look at that the Bible says when Jesus saw the Young Rich ruler what did the Bible says he love him but that did not save him right it did not save the Young Rich ruler Jesus look at him and he love him Jesus says them that love me will keep my Commandments amen let's keep the Commandments of the Lord let's keep the Commandments of the Lord you know and and and do those things that uh uh right at the end of his Revival I mean uh rejoicing it came to a new word and a new land and God make covered with them the rainbow stucks to Heaven God said I will never judge this word again and all of that rejoicing at the end of the Revival felled away got drunk praise the Lord amen but that was not Enoch Enoch kept walking he never allowed anything to stop him praise the Lord he kept walking he kept walking until his feet got lighter and he got out of year that's why Noah cannot be a type of the Rapture amen because the rapturing church will not go through the tribulation Noah went through the tribulation Enoch was translated praise the Lord and we walk with God Amen the old son that says we work till Jesus come amen praise the lord we work till Jesus come Hal Hallelujah now let's look at this little scripture we read here over in the book of uh 1 Samuel the effect of the Revival let me now let me read something to you I I I saw last night while studying at k b see what brother B said he says now brothers sisters we watch this mixed multitude growing up after why they begin to complain that's what we find in every move of God in every move of God we find a mixed multitude people that come and says I believe I you know we believe I believe the change you know uh uh uh uh uh you know gave their children all the prophet children names and you know uh uh gave their children the even the messages names you know well your name uh spoken word is the Original Seed your name the seed is not here with the shock praise the Lord I'm not not saying there to be funny I'm saying there because it is not a sign that you believe praise the lord it's not a sign that you believe sometimes we use those things just like a fake leaves praise the lord it's just like a fake Leaf we hide behind it praise the Lord like a brother that for take his you know leave his parents' name and name himself William Brandon marry his wife and name her maida so she can be maida Brandon so what does that mean what in the world does that mean because you don't call yourself by your father name you take brother BR so what does that means if your nature is not change praise the Lord amen Willi Brandon would have been William Brandon that God didn't now take him from the Sheep Court praise the Lord and make his name to be known Among Us write his name on the mountain it would just be like any other there are a lot of Brands around America so what does that means I mean it's a it's it's it's a honorable thing yeah you know to to name yourself after great man it's an honorable thing but you have to know that that name goes with a repetition it's not like just taking it as a shade to hide yourself behind it what does that means that's what we find in the move of God that's what it was when John Wesley had a Revival way back in the 17 century and Miss multitude when in when Luther had a Revival and Miss multitude when the Baptist by John Smith had a Revival and Miss multitude went up when Pentecostal had a Revival and Miss multitude went up praise the Lord here is here after after the time of the judges the last prophet that was in the land was uh H H Joshua Moses was the last one Joshua came and God start dealing with him through Visions not at the level of Moses Israel never had a prophet all through the time of the judges praise the Lord amen amen amen they never had a had a prophet and here is God a move of God came through the burden of a woman that was needing a child God conditioned her to be able to bring this Prophet amen and Sam little Samuel is born now watch it now it proved that we don't get it the first time God called Samuel how many times did God call him before he knew it was God praise the Lord amen he went to Eli he went to this minister he went to this church he went to this organization before finally finally finally an old priest would tell him the next time you hear that try this and see if it will work say Lord yes your servant amen speak praise the Lord and Eli realized when Samuel never came out to ask him he knew something has happened so he called the lead what did the Lord said he knew that God has spoken the first time for a long time that God will speak to a man right praise the Lord Israel again breaking into a Revival yes well now they have a prophet that had thou said the Lord thou say the Lord exactly what Samuel told him you go down this road and go there you will see the sheep that you the animal you are looking for exactly what Samuel told him there was no open Vision now they had a man of God in the land that a Revival Break Out Among the people the Bible says when Samuel is coming to town all the people will come with their knees and burden sometime they don't they would not even want to tell him because they knew that by discernment he will be able to tell them this is what you need this is what you and your family need to do to get out of that problem this is what they will all come they will honor that Revival and move of God this young benjamite because of the of the cry and desire of the people to want to be a king let H saw going to look for his father eyes just you know trying just to be a loyal son and help find his father anim met Samuel and Samuel lay his hands is this not the man that Israel seek after the spirit of the Lord Came Upon uh uh Saul he started to speak in tongues and prophesy all the people that were here wow is Samuel now among the I mean saw n among the prophets they have never seen him behaving that way until when he even came home he was afraid to tell his father that Samuel said he will become a Captain a king he was affected by the move of God the move of God affected his life the move of God brought him to a place of great honor that's what we seeing happening in our ranks praise the Lord I say it and I say over and over some of us we will not marry the wives that we had if it was not for this message we have children all over the place praise the lord we wouldn't get the kind of h Homes that we have if it was not because of the word that gave us sanity am that restored decency am took him from running after us and running all over the place and make him a king make him a king bless him with a good job give him some some some uh a good Financial standing oh yeah now he's now he's the king he can rub his shoulder I don't need to listen to Samuel I'm the king praise the Lord amen but you have to remember who made you King you have to remember who made you King who made you bride who taught you how to read your Bible for you to start looking for scripture to compare scripture now he don't have to listen to Samuel he's the king now I can do whatever I want to do praise the Lord I mean the prophet wasting time we've been wasting time we just wasting time people he's coming to preach now we just wasting time the days of courts are over praise the Lord amen amen yeah even Pentecostal churches are better than us the days of Court are over because he have reached to this place now he get little money in his bank account he had bought life insurance so when he die his family can survive he bought few properties making he investment you're ready now to challenge the word praise the Lord in old church I was reading this whole thing about the seven messenger seven anger the word is opening we beginning to see things you getting blind praise the Lord amen amen heard a story my little sister told me this back home one time a man that uh went to a Revival and ask the Lord to restore his sight and he was pray for he God his side promise the Lord he will Ser him praise the Lord you know when we in desperation and we make all the promises Lord all the day I found myself in the club made me blind made all those promises as time went on his friends invited him he went to the club he was there the noise were going on they were all dancing then he asked the guy who cut the light off nobody CAU the light off the light will stay on you just got BL F that's all that's what is happening to all the people that are seeing deeper things in the word you just got blind nobody cut the light off nobody C the light of budy you never kept your bagging you never kept your bagging praise the Lord the the effect of the Revival he got to this place now where he's much smarter when the word of God says killed the the the amalekites and all the the animal he said we keeping the best sheep because we need them for sacrifice praise the Lord the word said get rid of this you said no I mean now now we know we're not in legalising you know before when we came to the message we were too were too much legalism so now I mean we we we free okay let's get back to this thing I have to find a place here to close because uh I feeling tempted to go into something and then it will run the Wednesday night for us praise the Lord amen invisible union he says this let's read this and then we we can we can get out of this now we are entering another age we are entering the Rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better the church cannot go in its present condition but the thing of it is that it can't get better why because the people have left the word amen men are just coming out with different different system what we can do I mean uh uh uh I mean I mean if we can if we can bring the disco light you know the blue and red and and just shine it you know it will ease the people down you know and and I mean we just finding different matter to to to just just to get the people attention just to capture them just to get them interested in the things of God we're just creating different things the problem is not the program the problem is the people running the program Jesus told John the Baptist you must be born again if you are not converted you your your flesh will just get excited for the wine but inside there will be a lot of battle there will just be a lot of inner struggle just a lot of inner struggle and because we have put on so much of this profession it's hard for us to say I'm struggling I need help praise the Lord let's all experiencing his Insanity the man the man that's supposed to be the king to guide and protect the people he's now on an evil spirit where he want to kill the very people he's supposed to be protecting throwing a dag at Javelin at them on on an evil spirit he can no longer hear from God he got to go and look for a a suser we got to get into all of these uh you know uh caram thing and and and and let's let's put Seven Candle you got to burn Seven Candle you know Jesus was in the midst of Seven Candle you so you got to put Seven Candle we're just creating all sorts of things spiritual Madness and we come from out of there we can't hold the distanc we can't hold the decency the grace to hold our tongue and guide our spirit together that's what the move of God will do people want to break into discernment they want to call people name and say somebody yeah you know that this so we we we car ourself on Hunger Strike we lay there we lay there our body is all Afflicted tired of mind cannot focus because there is no birth in you you can't go up Jacob ladder Jacob ladder is the realm of Revelation there is nothing to take you up there so you stay in that in that condition you are afflicted by demons praise the Lord and then we come out of there and and and we become a prophet your people want to okay the only thing we can can prophesy about is somebody want to kill you that the only thing we can see somebody want to kill you that the only revelation we can have because because people are afraid of death they don't want to live right and they afraid of death so they run for that yeah the man told me somebody want to kill me it's it's all it's all the caramac you know all of those funny things and that's why we we must accept to say that we in the bride Revival God forbid the bride Revival is the word is this word bringing ourself submissive to the word the word taking on flesh changing our life that is the bride Revival that's the move of God it's not me coming here to impress you and making up things in my mind and say the Lord revealed to me and and and just to be able to impress you praise the Lord if I should gain your confidence is the way I order my life even if I'm not like your favorite preacher God gave me Grace to live right and that to live a questionable life the effect of the move of God when we sit under the word of God we sit in the house of God no matter where we go we are affected by the things we see by the things we hear praise the Lord is the grace there for us to take it back to the word to see whether this thing is lining with the word sometimes people just follow it they just follow it years and years and years on this is who I'm I'm I'm disappointed I mean because we were not doing what the Lord told us to do praise the lord we having young children I was just thinking about it the other day saying oh God oh God the way we are making room and making excuses for anything will there be a generation will there be a generation that is going to lose the decency of this word start to embrace all the undent dressing back in church praise the lord well we can say come quickly Lord Jesus praise the Lord because when we get away from the word we will believe anything it's just a matter of time if the word is not our anchor it's just a matter of time all of the things that were so precious to us start putting them on the Shelf it does not matter it does not matter it had a place in your life praise the Lord I would rather go and pick it up again and say Lord how did I really look at this I might have looked at it the wrong way but help me to turn the picture right instead of just putting it on the shelf and say it does not matter it's Old Testament scripture is before 1963 praise the Lord but as we go contining to go in this line of thought what I want you to watch out yet is that we're living in an age our age politically and National wise in the world as a whole this age has a mental problem praise the Lord there's not an age where people have suffered from mental problem in this age it's all because of the spirit of all the ages that have come down in this age praise the Lord and you and myself our only Escape is to stay behind the cross praise the Lord is to stay behind the cross you look you look in God's word you will see it brother Braham talks about uh uh uh uh uh uh Elijah going under the jiper tree God's Prophet was suffering from depression it's a spirit that reflects God's people praise the Lord our hiding plac is behind the cross Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross because there there is just there just all lot of things that is poured into the age that is suppressing the spirit of men creating anxieties and depression and all of those things now you have to realize that in one sense it does not have anything to do with your soul but what will happen there is that it puts your spirit to s wor place where you can no longer have confidence in yourself you can't have confidence in anybody I mean you are just you you you are just looking at everything wrong it Rob you of your the joy of your salvation the effect of the move of God let the spirit move allow the word to move allow God to De don't don't just get excited the excitement is good enjoy the excitement when you fin enjoying sit down and say Lord that's the reason why we are liking onto sheeps they have the ability to bring their food back out and eat it again praise the Lord and you will watch in the in the in the in the in the uh clean and un clean animals is most of those uh animals that can chew the cop I clean animals chewing the cop is the ability to bring the food back up and chew it again reexamine things keep it before the Lord keep it in the right perspective praise the Lord Lord stay in communion with God seek the face of God let the word of God brings become the rejoicing of your heart praise the Lord amen when things of Life begin to discourage you and you can get down to the word and get encouraged and strength you know that the channnel is clear praise the Lord let the spirit move amen like I said on Wednesday night we are just the same we have come this world has affected us we either go away better or sometimes we just misunderstand the whole thing people come to sit they say well the man just he he just insulted me praise the Lord when sometimes the preacher don't even have you on on his mind glory be to God but that's that's what we have to deal with when God move the devil also move when you I mean yeah year some of the things that happening you just think that that's that's Insanity you realize that people has been affected so much until they just go in in San praise the Lord trumping on the grace of God throwing the glory of God through the window there is one man the man Christ Jesus the Bible says there is no mediator there is no mediator if you can find something that the man Christ Jesus did that you don't appreciate for why you don't want to serve him praise the Lord don't look at what a did or what another person did look at the man Christ Jesus praise the Lord Hallelujah young people this is our time this is our day this is our chance at this revival at this move of God praise the Lord oh may God God give us Grace may God give us Grace Hallelujah may God give us Grace that we will be able to labor under the leadership of the Holy Spirit labor with patience to be able to bring this glorious Riches of Christ this glorious treasure that our young people will not miss it that all they would think about we just giving them rules it's not Rose we're just bringing you to the Fountain to drink to be born again for that life to start within praise the Lord if you have been imparted by this move of God and to just see the Glorious thing I was listening to a brother in South Africa this morning he was preaching I was I was just uh uh shaving and G getting myself ready I was just you know looking into their service and he was just he was just uh testifying and preaching and and testifying how he came to the how he came to the Lord and and the Glorious thing he said that really brought me to tears he says uh you know that that was that was the time of uh of uh South Africa uh a part time he says and uh the Lord was dealing with his heart but he he really did not you know he really couldn't put it together and uh and one day he was he was coming from somewhere he was just passing by a dumped you know uh and something just L him he says I I can't even believe I went standing by that stinking dump but uh something just led him and as he was looking there he just saw the uh uh a message book and he picked the book up and y's brother brand a picture on the book and this brother that is talking is a black brother and now he's thinking in himself white man he said but when he flipped the book open the first few word brother Bram says I want to welcome every one of you that word every one of you he fed included amen he says I did not know what he was preaching but when he says I want to welcome every one of you the Holy Spirit dropped something in his heart he said he knil down and he said Lord Jesus I give my life to you he don't have a church he don't know anything about this message nothing he will find a job and the bus of the job will be a messenger believer a white South African when he got into his office he saw brother Brandon picture he said that's the same picture on that book so I'm going to ask my bus who is this man but because of of of the tension because of the things that were going on to even approach your bus to have a conversation was difficult he said he would just be Fanning around fing around how to even start the conversation he's struggling he says one day they asked him to come to work at 5:00 a.m. he came at 4: he says I will meet the bus will be one onone if he will whip me he will whip me nobody will see it but I will ask him who is that man on his computer so when he asked the bus the bus did not know where he was coming from the bus says why are you asking you know just just yell at him like that why are you asking he said no bus I have a I have a book at the house that I'm reading that same picture is there I just want you to tell me how I can get his books in the library hallu then the bus tation changed he did not say nothing to him he drove home in his mind he says I don't know what I've said to this man it looks like he going to get his gun the boss drove home and brought him a little box of message books and you know start to tell him you know you know God sent us a prophet you know he came to South Africa you know start to tell him and both of them started crying you know started crying and started worshiping God praise the Lord I mean it just brought me to tears how God how God move in miraculous way amen he move in miraculous way he knows how to get his children attention he know what to use to get our attention praise the Lord and I pray that the move of God will get our attention I mean on on on the positive things on the things that is affecting our life the things that is bringing change that is creating more desire for God that's wanting us to be right to talk right behave right dress right live right that's the move of God it's not just to make us religious and just make our church members praise the Lord remember when the persons leave the word they will believe anything musicians you can come I just thinking in my mind how that the boss of that brother fed in his heart y say he was about to have an arrogant approach but to realize without his effort he did not make an effort God in his Mercy was able to minister to this man heart to realize that and humble himself praise the Lord amen that's what the move of God would do when we realize that we are wrong we will submit ourself you know submission is not to man now now when the Bible says submit yourself one to another it's not just to to to man it's it's not just to mean it's not just to to to another leader but because it's the word you are submitting yourself to the word because that's what the word asks you to do oh let the spirit of God move let the spirit of God move move in our lives and move in our home affect our life in such a way word this this this word [Music] let the spirit of God move upon our [Music] hearts that will create true desire in our [Music] heart the desire word you be able to
