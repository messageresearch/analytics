========================================

them out of the hand of the Egyptian to bring them up out of the land unto a good land enlarge, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto a pl a place of the Canaanite, of theite, of the Amorite, of the Perasites, and the Aites. and a jebside. This is a you know you this is the encounter that Moses is having with the burning bush. God is promising this. He says I see the affliction of my people. I have come down to deliver them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But let me ask you something. Was God in Egypt physically? No. God says I have come down. I will be going to Egypt. But people the Egyptian did not see God. They see a man with a dry stick. &gt;&gt; You see, was God in Egypt? Yes, God was in Egypt. Where was God? He was there in the body of Moses. &gt;&gt; You see the power of a man that is commissioned by God to do a job. &gt;&gt; Because when God sends you, he does not just say go by yourself. He goes along with you. &gt;&gt; He says let's go. &gt;&gt; God never say go by yourself. He can't let you go by yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. He has to be there with you. So if God revealed the word to you, you're not going by yourself. &gt;&gt; He's going with you. &gt;&gt; Because what you have in your heart is the promise. When you're carrying the promise, you're carrying the promise giver. &gt;&gt; You are not alone, saints. &gt;&gt; You might be going through things, but you're not alone. Hold on to the promise. &gt;&gt; Take the promise of God. Walk through the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God says let go, let go, it does not mean you going by yourself. &gt;&gt; It's going to be there. &gt;&gt; You might see fire. You might see water. You might be seeing the Red Sea. But he says, "I will be with you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will never leave you. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. &gt;&gt; And Moses was God's prophet with a vindicated message to get him out of that place. It was not this man Moses that had a super, you know, his own ability as a man, but it was God. &gt;&gt; It was God that was actually driving the own thing. Moses was under the influence of that angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Hosea chapter 12:3, I like this scripture. Watch what the Bible is saying here. It says, "And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, &gt;&gt; and by a prophet was he preserved." &gt;&gt; So Hosea 12:3 prophet the Lord the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet was a preserve. So God preserved, protected. God guarded the children of Israel. It was not Moses as a man to do the work by himself. It was God that was actually preserving them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was using a man. He was using a prophet for that exodus. &gt;&gt; To take them out, to bring them into that promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why in the journey of your life, saints, God sent the word. He sent a prophet to guide you to that place where you have got to you have to go. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because you need the Holy Spirit. You need the pillar of fire. You need a prophet to guide you there. &gt;&gt; You can't walk by yourself. &gt;&gt; Israel did not even know the way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Moses as a man, he did not know the the way, but he was under the influence of the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's open Exodus chapter 23. I'm going to get into my message. I'm just going to lay the foundation first and then we'll fly real quick. &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:20 now. Watch what the scripture is saying here. It says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. We'll just read it from there. Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is an angel that is keeping you in the way. &gt;&gt; The way is long, but there is an angel that has been commissioned to guide you in the way, to keep you in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring thee into the place which I have prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a place that God had prepared. &gt;&gt; And that was in the promised land that he gave the commission to the angel. He had an angel that was going before them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To keep them in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To protect them, to guard them &gt;&gt; until they're going to go to arrive to the final destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this Christian life is not just I'm walking. No. No. There is an angel that is coming with me to bring me to my final destination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that we are under influence of angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There are ministering spirits &gt;&gt; that are only sent to the ends of salvation. &gt;&gt; It's not everybody that has an angel. &gt;&gt; Only those that got predestinated. There is an angel that goes along with them &gt;&gt; because they have been commissioned to bring them to the final destination. &gt;&gt; That's why there's no enough demon in hell that can stand on the way. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God, church. Now it was in a journey that they never gone before. It was a new they never been there before but that angel was leading them go this way. They could have taken another way than the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; But God was bringing them where the trouble was. &gt;&gt; They got to the Red Sea and they see, oh my goodness, what is going? They look behind. Pharaoh is coming. Left and right. There's mountains in front of them. The Red Sea. They didn't know what to do. But it was not the job of them to worry. &gt;&gt; It was the angel's job to do it &gt;&gt; because the promise was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your own ability. Look at the promise. &gt;&gt; Because every time that you look at your own ability, you will fail. &gt;&gt; How many of us have already failed? Let me be honest. &gt;&gt; I'll probably lift my hands. I failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the promise. When you look at the promise, that's when God is making the way because that angel is showing you where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My We thank the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were under influence of that angel while traveling from where you are to the place that you are going. There's an angel that is appointed. Now verse 21, it says, "Be aware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not &gt;&gt; for he will not pardon your transgression &gt;&gt; for my name is in him. &gt;&gt; Obedience to the voice of that angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if that angel that is leading you the way is telling you take left, you follow left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he tells you go right, you follow right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't question. Just follow what the angel is saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that's very important. Obedience is one of the things &gt;&gt; when God gives his word, don't worry about what will happen. You just obey what he said. &gt;&gt; He can't fail. &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that he cannot do is fail. &gt;&gt; God may not tell you where he's bringing you. You might be going through the Red Sea, maybe a deserted place, &gt;&gt; a place of no pasture, where there's no water, a place of danger, a place where you don't even know where how you're going to come out of it. But just listen to the voice &gt;&gt; of that angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God is about to set a trap for the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So if he tells you, you probably trigger the enemy. That's why he doesn't even tell you. &gt;&gt; He puts traps for the enemy somewhere. He says, "No, certain things that this is what I'm going to take, but I'm going to bring them where danger is &gt;&gt; to show them that I to show them my power, my ability." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm able to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has done it throughout the Bible. Throughout the Bible, &gt;&gt; you see that be aware, be watchful, be careful, and be cautious of that angel. Verse 22, but if that shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thy enemy and the adversary of the adversary. To the obedient, he will be the one that will be fighting the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot disobey and expect God to do something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It requires obedience to his word to bring forth that fruit for you to enjoy the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that required obed obedience. &gt;&gt; If the devil touches you, &gt;&gt; he will face him. &gt;&gt; If anyone who curses you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; shall be cursed. &gt;&gt; Because you are follow, you are following. You are a followers. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a leader that is there. &gt;&gt; It's not your problem. is the leader's problem. &gt;&gt; Just to encourage somebody here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He repeats it again. He says, "For my angels shall go before thee to bring thee in unto the Amorite, theite, the parasites, the Canaanites, the the Aite, the Jebite, and I will cut them off." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometime it's easy for us to believe these things, but we can't believe the God that is doing things in our own life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh, wow. I believe the Bible." But what is happening today? Can we believe God the same way? &gt;&gt; How many of us can believe God the same way? &gt;&gt; In impossible things, you can't trust God for it &gt;&gt; because he specializes in things like that. &gt;&gt; My You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My He will bring you in. &gt;&gt; He will be the one to position you into the land of the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were ordained to possess it. &gt;&gt; You were chosen. You were predestinated to possess it. It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; But you have to be obedient to that voice. &gt;&gt; You must follow the leadership of that angel &gt;&gt; to have all to be beneficiary of the whole things. You must obey that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we see here when they got to the Red Sea, Israel start complaining. The first thing they forgot that God has sent them a prophet. Do you see that? As a human being, we forget. They got to the Red Sea, they start complaining. It says because there were no grave in Egypt that thou has taken us away to die in the wilderness. They start questioning God. Didn't you see that is the one that got you out of after all these plagues that happened in Egypt &gt;&gt; for your for you? You could have got involved into an accident. God came to save you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Amen. &gt;&gt; You were supposed to die a long time ago, maybe when you were a baby, but you you are. &gt;&gt; Is it by your own power? No. And sometime because of those little things, we start complaining and questioning God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Israel did. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; They got to the Red Sea, they start complaining. He says, "There's no grave in Egypt. Why are you going to bring us here?" They start questioning God. &gt;&gt; Watch God's mercy and grace. It says to Moses, "Speak the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? The Red Sea parted. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; God did not go over there and complain. He just told to Abra Moses. He says, "Speak the word." &gt;&gt; What happened? You know what happened &gt;&gt; miraculously? &gt;&gt; God departed the sea, the Red Sea. They got to this place called Mara. They didn't have water. The the water was bitter. The people start mamming against Moses. He says, "What are we going to drink? We don't have water. They just crossed the Red Sea. God opened the Red Sea before them. &gt;&gt; They sung songs of Moses. &gt;&gt; But now there's no water. They start complaining. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know there's no water in here. What are we going to do? You have brought us here to die because I mean what are we going to do with all this cattle that we that are following us? &gt;&gt; Men start complaining again. &gt;&gt; And God made the water sweet. God did it again. &gt;&gt; He did it again. &gt;&gt; But men, as men, as human being, we start complaining again. &gt;&gt; They got to a place where there's no food. They start murmuring against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. Would to God we had died by the hands of of the Lord of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when is sat by the fl the flesh of part when we did eat uh bread to to the fullest to the fool for yet brought us forth into the wilderness to kill this whole assembly with anger. They start complaining about food now. &gt;&gt; They forget that God gave them water. &gt;&gt; They forgot that God parted the sea. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? They start complaining again. Oh no, I don't have this. Why everybody has that? Only me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look back what God has already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look back what God remember what he has done &gt;&gt; before you complain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why we have to be grateful to the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because what had happened then is happening today. &gt;&gt; Is happening in our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm just here to remind you of one thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go ahead on myself. &gt;&gt; They got to a place there's no water. And Raphaim, sorry, Raphaim, the people with Moses, they got mad. He says, you know, we thirsty. We need water. And the murmur against Moses. He says, where are we going to get water again? God gave them water from the rock at orb. This is God. You know sometime we complain a lot. God is still giving. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I don't have money. It comes, he gives you money. &gt;&gt; You forgot to thank him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You walk away. It looks at you. He doesn't say anything. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I want children. I want children. Lord, everybody else are holding children. I don't have it. God comes miraculously. He give you a child. You come, oh wow, God is so good. Few months later, there's another situation that come. We complain again. &gt;&gt; But God is merciful, saints. &gt;&gt; They face the Amalecch. They face Amalecch. God gave them a great victory against Amalecch. &gt;&gt; You know, the Egyptian, the the the the Jews, they did not have, you know, they were not a great army, but they had a pill of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had that angel. They were under the influence of that angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. That angel was fighting the battle. When you go to bed, you don't see how many angels are fighting. &gt;&gt; You don't see it. You just wake up in the morning. &gt;&gt; Sometime we forget to say, "God, thank you." &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened last night, but Lord, I thank you tonight. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Do you see now? He got to a place where Moses was in a mountain where the ten commandment was given unto him. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's let's read this for a minute. I'm getting into my my sermon now. Exodus 2032:7. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go and get thee down." Now, this is the part where Israel built a calf and worship it. Do you see? You read the Bible, you you remember that they made a calf and said, "Moses is taking a long time. He has been gone for a long time. Let us make a calf here and worship him." They start worshiping a calf. That did not please God at all. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And Moses God spoke to Moses. It says here verse 7, Exodus 32, and the Lord said unto Moses, "Go get thee down, for thy people and that which thou brotherth out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves." Now, I want you to notice something. The Lord is saying unto Moses, "These are your people. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; God is not saying this is my people. God is the one who chose them. &gt;&gt; He even sent Moses. But in this case when they sin, he looked to Moses says thy people have sinned. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Are we reading the Bible together? &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. I have made the uh sorry they have made a molden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed there unto and said this be thy God oh Israel which has brought thee out of the land of Egypt. You see that? And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen these people. Behold the this is a stiff neckaked people. Verse 10. Now therefore let me alone that my wrath may work hard against them that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation. God is literally saying let me destroy them. I'm ready to destroy them because they have broken my covenant. I helped them here. I've I've done this for them. But they the knife and they're complaining all the time and this sin that I have committed that has gone beyond what I can even now I'm ready to kill them. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is I broke the covenant because there was a covenant that was between them and God. &gt;&gt; And as long as they had that covenant, they were protected. &gt;&gt; They were guarded by that covenant. &gt;&gt; And now they start worshiping other gods. They start worshiping and and and offering sacrifices. You see that? But watch Moses standing in the gap. My my title is who will stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Watch what Moses is doing here. Verse 11. And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Why do why do thou wax hat uh wax hat against thy people? Moses, now you see that God was saying thy people, Moses, now Mo, you know, Moses is saying thy people to God. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Why does thy wrath works hard against thy people, which thou brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with great hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, say, for mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in a mountain, and to consume them from the face of the earth. Turn from thy fairest wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. &gt;&gt; This is a man &gt;&gt; talking to God. [Music] It's getting a little silence here. &gt;&gt; This is a man. But we have read in song they say a chosen. &gt;&gt; Moses was what? Chosen. I want you to keep that in mind. Moses was chosen. It says therefore he said what will he destroy them? has now Moses his chosen stood before him in the bridge says why do you want to kill them what the other nation will say that's your people you got them out of Egypt you see God will never leave you &gt;&gt; oh glory to God will never leave you &gt;&gt; oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; Moses stood in a bridge pleading, &gt;&gt; reminding God about his promises that he gave to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Verse 13, remember now that's Moses speaking to God. He says, "Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, that servant, to whom thou swearth by thy own self? and said unto them, I will multiply your seed as the star of the earth and all this land have spoken of will. I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever. &gt;&gt; You cannot remember God your thoughts. Remember him his word. &gt;&gt; Sometime we come God you see everybody are laughing at me. No, remember remind God of his word. &gt;&gt; Not your thoughts, &gt;&gt; your thoughts will not stand before God. &gt;&gt; His word only will stand before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; My my. But the Bible says the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. Does it mean that God didn't know that Israel will sin or would do whatever? No, he knew it. &gt;&gt; Do you think God was surprised? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. He knew all things. &gt;&gt; But God was trying to display something. God was was was pointing to a role that Christ will let her do for Abraham's race. It was it's the infinite. It knows the end before the beginning. &gt;&gt; But now he sees the approach because remember it was still the influence of that angel. &gt;&gt; Moses as he was thinking pleading for the people. Moses maybe did not know it but it was the spirit of Christ in Moses &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap for the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you are a chosen son and a daughter of God, you have a job to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you know your position with God, then you know where you have to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're standing in the gap, you playing a role. &gt;&gt; You know, he did it by revelation, not knowing. But that but Bam says something. I I'll read something a quote here. uh standing in the gap. Paragraph 40. I'm going ahead of myself, but that's okay. Now, today, if God was going to liquidate the people, and there was a time that when God had gotten tired of fooling with our sin, we constantly going wrong. Who would stand like Moses today for the people? Where would we find a person that will stand and could stand and God would accept like he did Moses? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It says, "And Moses own life on earth meant so much to God till he stayed the wrath of God and would not cross over Moses." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But what was pushing Moses to do that? It was the spirit of Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's God playing here through the life of Moses to show us what he will later do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see this? Do you see a little bit of picture here? &gt;&gt; Another message. what I'm saying. And Moses threw himself in the front of God, bre bridged his way and said, "God, take me." And God could not cross that man. Watch what the prophet says. A power of a saint before God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You can stand also for your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you are a scented son and daughter of God, you can also stand in the bridge for someone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if the spirit of Christ is in you, you will do what Christ did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With Moses, it was the Christ is the spirit of Christ that was leading him to stay in the bridge. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The power of a chosen son and a daughter of God. that can stand between a angry God and a sinful sinful people. &gt;&gt; God is seeking for a man to stand in the gap. We just read in the book of Ezekiel &gt;&gt; is asking I want to see who will stand in the gap who will be praying for the abomination that is happening in the land. &gt;&gt; Who will stay alone in prayer for your brother? You know how many of our family members are still in the world? If we have received God, how many of them through your life have come to know Christ? &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them the sp the saving power of God? &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them that Jesus saves? &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them that Jesus is a healer? &gt;&gt; Somebody got to say it. &gt;&gt; And that's every single one of us. &gt;&gt; And to do it, we must be the chosen of God &gt;&gt; to stand in the bridge. Mhm. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of Abraham. &gt;&gt; How he stood in the bridge for Lot. &gt;&gt; What about Esther? &gt;&gt; She stood in the bridge for her people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There were people in the Bible. &gt;&gt; So if we are anointed by the same spirit, we must do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the question is to the church, &gt;&gt; where are we at? &gt;&gt; Is Christianity just going to church? &gt;&gt; You see, it's more than that. And God is dealing with our heart. &gt;&gt; It's not just about going to church, but it's to make a change. &gt;&gt; How many people outside are being influenced by our life? &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; How many of us need God's grace? &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; It says the power of a saint before God. My my the souls that that are in prison. He says, watch what brother says here. He says there was a scripture that always puzzle me. He says how that Moses could tell God a better idea than God had till I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It says God said, Moses, separate yourself from them. I will destroy the whole thing &gt;&gt; and start with you. &gt;&gt; And he said, Lord, I he throw himself in the bridge saying take me &gt;&gt; plot out my name of these very people that had rebelled and his heart went for them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Say, do you see this? &gt;&gt; Yes. after all the rebel rebellious people that make his life a you know harder but Moses was still willing to stay in the cup for them &gt;&gt; he went before God and said Lord please forgive me forgive them you know let's continue to read here &gt;&gt; verse 32 chapter 32:30 are you happy are you tired &gt;&gt; Amen brother &gt;&gt; my goodness 32 2 verse 30. It's a Bible study, right? Is that right? &gt;&gt; And it came to pass on the tomorrow. That's after the people have sinned. They have done something wrong and God was mad at them and and many of them died too. But now Moses saying something with God. This is a conversation with Moses and God. And it came to pass on the moral Moses said unto the people, "You have seen a great scene, and now I will go up unto the Lord. Perventure I shall make an atonement." Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a man that is born out of is is a a natural man like you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying here. Says, "Pray a venture. I will make an atonement for your sin. See, it's not just Moses. You as well. You can stand in the gap for somebody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You as a parent, you can stand in the gap for your children. &gt;&gt; Job did it. He was offering the sacrifice for his children. Maybe pray my children have sinned against God. He was offering the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; What about our parents? Our parents maybe they don't even know God. &gt;&gt; Can we stand in the gap and tell them a little bit about God &gt;&gt; about our own experience? &gt;&gt; Can they say in see your life and see the change? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can our parents you know can look at us and say wow that child is no longer what they used to be. &gt;&gt; Something had happened to them. &gt;&gt; They used to have an anger issue but they no longer have that. Wow. Only God can do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; They used to struggle with this, with smoking. But no, no, no, no. Only God can change that. &gt;&gt; You know when you preach to a person like that, you they will believe it. &gt;&gt; They can doubt it. &gt;&gt; Because they've seen that message. Whatever you preaching, they've seen it in your life. &gt;&gt; What about toward our husband and wife? &gt;&gt; Sometime our wife does not believe. We go over there and say, "Man, this is a pacing from here." But how many times you stay on the knees praying for the wife? &gt;&gt; Oh our husband man is it's really bad. Is I don't even know what he's doing. But how many time you stay on your knees praying for your husband? &gt;&gt; How many of us stands in the gap for somebody every day? &gt;&gt; But we're busy. But how many of us are standing in the gap? &gt;&gt; The question is who is going to stand in the gap? who is going to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; And Moses knew his position in God. He was commissioned, chained, as sent, chosen for deliverance. He knew that God could not plot out his name out of his book. &gt;&gt; Cuz the lamb's book is sealed with his own blood. &gt;&gt; He cannot take away your name out. &gt;&gt; That's the power of a chosen son, daughter of God. You have the right to do it, saints, tonight. It's not just attending church. Let's enter into action. If we believe, let's work now &gt;&gt; because faith involve also work. &gt;&gt; You cannot say I believe and we sit there and I relax. No, no, no. The reason why if you have really believed, &gt;&gt; that faith will put you in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are really saved, that salvation will put you in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To seek for lost souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of our family knows that we have received such a message? &gt;&gt; How many people on the street knows that God has sent a prophet in this generation? We don't even talk about it. &gt;&gt; We don't we can't talk about money. We can talk about how many houses we have. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to God, we don't even mention it. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Moses verse uh chapter 33:12 Moses says unto the Lord see thou has saith unto me bring up these people and thou has not let me know whom thou th that will sent with me yet thou has said I know thee by name and thou has also found grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy side. Show me now thy way I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight. Consider that this nation is thy people. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; He said, "My presence shall go with thee." That's God that is speaking to me. &gt;&gt; "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest." Oh my. And he said unto him, "If thy present go not with me, carry us not up then. &gt;&gt; I will not go until I feel your presence." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prove me that you have forgiven these people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You cannot just say, "Oh God, I'll pray for my family members and walk away." You have to make sure God are they going to be saved? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; my children say, "Are you going to save them? Prove to me that you're going to save them. Give me a sign that you're going to save them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to stay in the gap. &gt;&gt; It's not just a little prayer and leave. &gt;&gt; It's a constant prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a constant prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Times time is not really our friend. But here it was Christ in Moses standing in the gap interceding advocating for the people. Let me read something here. You know when God allow things to happen, God intention is not to to bring you down his wrath upon his people or to bring judgment. &gt;&gt; He always extend mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He want you to be safe. He want you to have an experience. He want you to be happy. &gt;&gt; He want you to be happy. God want you to be happy. Sometime when things negative happen in your life say no I feel like God doesn't want me to be happy. No, he wanted to be happy, &gt;&gt; you know, but he's seeking for a man &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap that will be having a burden for for your brother, for your sister. Say, "Lord, I want you to deal with them." &gt;&gt; Even in our church, if somebody's dealing with something, pray for them. They may not even know it. &gt;&gt; Just pray for them. Stay a little longer. Say, "Lord, I've been interceding for this brother." &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ, not criticizing them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's easy for that spirit to come in our midst. &gt;&gt; Instead of us praying, &gt;&gt; we are spending more time criticizing. &gt;&gt; Oh, this one is doing this way. Can you wake up the brother, please? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, may God help us that we'll have time to stay on our knees praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; advocating &gt;&gt; for our church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know the pastor does it. &gt;&gt; That's not just the pastor's job. It's all of us. But who's going to stand in the gap for him? &gt;&gt; So if he's standing in the gap for your family, who's going to stand for him then? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody got to stand in the gap for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody need to pray for him. &gt;&gt; God is seeking a man. &gt;&gt; I sought for a man among them. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That should make up the edge &gt;&gt; that will stand in the gap before me for the land &gt;&gt; for the church &gt;&gt; for your family. &gt;&gt; For your neighbor, &gt;&gt; maybe your neighbor is the last elect &gt;&gt; before the rapture take place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but you must be you must have that burden until one day God will help you to say you go knock at his door. Hey &gt;&gt; neighbor. Hey I just want to tell you about God how he dealt with me. &gt;&gt; And after ministering to that person after standing in the gap for that person that can trigger the rapture. Maybe he's the last person. &gt;&gt; You don't know that. &gt;&gt; But God want you to have a burden. Maybe this message might be very simple. And I know it is simple. &gt;&gt; Might get a little boring and quiet. &gt;&gt; But s let me tell you something. There's a reason why &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching this message just preaching it. &gt;&gt; There is a reason behind this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a normal Wednesday. &gt;&gt; But for somebody, it's not going to be that Wednesday. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody must sending the go for somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot let our children in the world and wondering. &gt;&gt; They are our inheritance. &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait for Joseph to be 20. &gt;&gt; I have to start now. &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Oh, no. My children are still little. I mean, they're innocent." The enemy is still hunting even the little ones. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the time that you spending on your knees today would have an impact 20 years if the Lord &gt;&gt; ter &gt;&gt; those prayer will guard the children when they about to go this that angel is telling them come back this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of your prayer 20 years ago &gt;&gt; because you were standing in a gap for your family 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; We I am standing here because somebody 20 years ago was praying. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a woman, there was a man that was praying for me to stand here. &gt;&gt; I never even know that I will stand here. &gt;&gt; But somebody back there 20 years ago was on the knees praying, "God, please help this young man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody got to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When Adam's race was all backed up into the corner, death and sickness on every side, Adam's race was defeated, outnumbered by demon power. You see that the law had failed, the prophet had failed because they were human. Diseases and ignorance had collapsed them into a place until there were no hope left. Because nobody was worthy. Adam rest had fallen. There was nobody to stand in between. There was nobody to stand in the gap. But God himself said, "No, I can't let these people in this condition. In his mind, he had already slain a lamb. &gt;&gt; He already made a way. &gt;&gt; But Moses was just displaying Christ. It was Christ in Moses that was showing how to stand in the gap. You can see in the life of David. You can see in the life of Abraham standing for Lot, Esther and all of those. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that was the spirit of God to do it. &gt;&gt; It was just to show us there is one that is coming. &gt;&gt; That would do that will fulfill all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Adam race was in that place where there was no there was no they were helpless, no hope. John in the book of Revelation chapter 5 it says no man in earth that no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book because Adam had lost that book he had lost that authority John elitic says nobody was ready to open this nobody's able to save us. &gt;&gt; But he wept much because no man was found worthy. &gt;&gt; No man was able to stand in the gap for Abraham's race a h Adam race because they all have fallen into sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody was perfect. &gt;&gt; Joseph who was closer to the perfect really close he told the lie. All of them had failed. The law had failed. &gt;&gt; But there was one that had to come. That was our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says something here. Brother one read that quote on Sunday. You know when brother one read that quote, I said, "Please, brother one, don't go in that direction." I'll read it again. The mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "But oh brother and sister," I think that's quote number six. Okay. It says, "Uh, six." Perfect. But oh brother and sister, what was such a little things to one day when Adam race was backed up against the wall? You see that they had no they had prophets. They had had laws. They had killed the prophets and destroyed the law. And Adam race was backed up, helpless, hopeless against the coming of the enemy. The devil and all his host host well trained spirit beings. The mortal were no match for them at all. And what could they do? They were helpless. Do you see that? Do you see that? It says, "But there was one &gt;&gt; who stepped out in glory. from the bas of the father &gt;&gt; and he said I will go down this day and give my life for Adam fallen race &gt;&gt; let's continue &gt;&gt; oh glory to God &gt;&gt; it says and when he was here on earth &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he found the darkness part of the spear that conquered men &gt;&gt; and was dead and he grabbed an arful of them at cover and and and and plugged itself to death. That's our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It says and left the commission with what? &gt;&gt; His church ragged group uneducated illiterate fishman. Fisherman. He never left a just stick and stone to fight with. But on the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; he put the greatest weapon &gt;&gt; in the church sin. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he never it never had. He said, "Follow me and fight with all that is in you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to stand in the gap for Abra Adam's human race. &gt;&gt; He came out victorious. &gt;&gt; He redeemed and released us from the bondage of sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that he broke our chains. &gt;&gt; He forgive our sin for never to be remembered. &gt;&gt; He fulfilled the law for us. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he paid the price. He paid our debt with his own blood. &gt;&gt; Cuz no man could stand. Let's read some scripture here. 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 5. I'm coming to the closure soon here. 1 Timothy 2:5 it says, "For there is one God and one mediator between God and man." &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It says, "The man Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In another scripture, John 14:6, Jesus said unto them, I am the way. You see that way that he was leading them, he was the way. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; The truth and the life. No man cometh unto unto the father but by me. &gt;&gt; He was the one in who made the bridge. He was the one in between God and sinful men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Moses was displaying that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 5 verse 10. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to stay in the cup for you and I. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2 verse one. My little children, this thing right add unto you that ye sin not. If any man sin, we have an advocate. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; We have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous. &gt;&gt; And he is the propitiation for our sin. Not for our our uh our only but also for the sin of the whole world. Do you see that? And I'm going to close with this uh this quote here. Somebody has to stay in the gap. &gt;&gt; Quote number seven. Christ the bread of life comes down from heaven emiliating himself giving his life that through his life we might have surgeon surgeoning mercy. Where did that come from? out of the pillar of fire. That's where he dropped out of. He was up there. That was Christ himself. The logos, the angel of the covenant. You see that Moses stood h forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going. But he was on this road. The children of Israel followed and God promised that the angel will lead him. Do you see that? And look, God said, "I will put my name in him." He won't pardon your transgression. So be aware of him. He has not been he hadn't been made flesh yet to dwell among us to shed his blood to take away our sins. So the blood of the lamb and goat was very very fragile. You see that? it would break easy. But now the blood of Christ once said cleans until the day of redemption &gt;&gt; and all the way through once perfected through sanctifying process of the Holy Spirit by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. The believer is anchored until the day of redemption. What? Yes sir. Ephesians 4:30, grave not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 80 86. Don't just take the scare of it now. God is with us. Although you sin, now we're coming to a closure here. Although you sin, you got an advocate. Tell God you are sorry. &gt;&gt; Come on back. &gt;&gt; That's the way to do it. Don't think you are cast off forever. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; As long as you still have enough desire to come to this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God is still with you. That's why sure he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's grace &gt;&gt; and mercy &gt;&gt; is still available. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are standing here, if you're here because somebody had prayed for you. If you say, "Oh no, all my family members are not in the message. They don't believe." But there's this man called Jesus. &gt;&gt; He thought of you before the foundation of the world. He knew that you would come to this church today. &gt;&gt; He knew that you will believe what you are believing. &gt;&gt; And he stood on the in the gap for you &gt;&gt; to save you. Saint, you see, we have to stop complaining. &gt;&gt; We have to be thankful of what God is doing in our life. &gt;&gt; But who's going to stand in the gap? He already did it. &gt;&gt; This is your time &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap for somebody else. It must be the spirit of God. Even tonight, maybe somebody may not catch this. But somebody got to stand up. &gt;&gt; If that spirit dwells in you, you know, if you have the spirit of tar in you, you will do what Tarzan did. That's true. But if you have the spirit of Christ in you, you will do what Christ did. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a different spirit. is going to be the same spirit. &gt;&gt; May God help us &gt;&gt; to stand in the gut for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Maybe next to you there is a brother and a sister that you know a situation about. You know what they are dealing with. If you can do don't criticize them. Pray for them. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand? &gt;&gt; You love the Lord Jesus. Can we play only please? How many of us tonight want to lift your hand and say, "Lord, I want to stand in the gap." Tonight, as we're about to pray, I want you to remember somebody tonight. If you don't have anybody to pray for, please remember me. Remember our pastor. He's far. But this meeting that expected that he has to preach, he will depend on our prayer. He will need our prayer to stand in the gap for him and say, "Lord, please help our pastors, Father. May you keep him. May you protect him. May you minister to the people. What about family members? What what about our children, our wives, our husband? May God help us. Heavenly Father, we are coming before you tonight with your people, Lord, with this simple message. But Lord, you have placed a burden in my heart to bring it. I don't know why, Lord. But Lord, you know all things. Lord, I pray Lord, as all your children are praying right now, may the same angel of the covenant pass through every road tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we are calling upon your name tonight. Father, may you open our eyes to stand in the gap for someone. Forgive our sin. Forgive our iniquity.

But Lord, I do believe by your grace, Lord, that this will be of a blessing to your people.

We need you, Lord God. That's why we have asked these things, Lord, believing that you have and grant unto us whatever we have asked in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We ask these things. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We love the Lord. We give God a hand for his mercy and grace. I pray that this was a blessing to you. Just pray for me. I need prayers.
