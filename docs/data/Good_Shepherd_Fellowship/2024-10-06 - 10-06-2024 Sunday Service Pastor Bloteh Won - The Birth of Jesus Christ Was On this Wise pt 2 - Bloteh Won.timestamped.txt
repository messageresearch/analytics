[57:56] praise the Lord Genesis chapter
[57:59] 1 Genesis chapter
[58:02] 1 we will read uh uh Genesis
[58:11] 11 let's read
[58:13] 11 Genesis 1 verse
[58:22] 11 and God said let the Earth bring for
[58:27] GR the herb yielding seeds and the fruit
[58:30] trees yielding fruit
[58:33] after his
[58:35] kind who seiz is in itself
[58:40] upon the Earth and it was
[58:44] so praise the
[58:46] Lord and the Earth brought full grass
[58:50] and the herb yelling seeds after his
[58:52] kind and the trees yelling fruits are
[58:56] yelling fruits who seeds was in
[58:58] itself after his kind and God saw that
[59:02] it was good let's drop down to
[59:05] verse
[59:07] 26 let's drop down to verse
[59:11] 26 Genesis
[59:13] 1:26 and God said let
[59:17] us make man in our
[59:21] image after our
[59:24] likeness and let them have have dominion
[59:27] over the fish of the sea and over the
[59:32] fows of the earth and over the cattles
[59:34] and over all the Earth and over every
[59:38] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[59:41] Earth so God created
[59:45] man praise the Lord now I want for us to
[59:49] pay attention to that while you have
[59:51] your seat uh uh the Lord bless you you
[59:55] can have have your seed in verse 26 the
[59:58] Bible says God said let us make man in
[1:00:01] our image and in our likeness and then
[1:00:04] in verse 27 the Bible says so God make
[1:00:07] Man In His
[1:00:11] Image praise the Lord in in in chapter
[1:00:15] 20 26 it looks like it was more than one
[1:00:19] person in chap in in verse 27 it appears
[1:00:24] that it is one person
[1:00:28] praise the Lord
[1:00:32] amen and God said let us make men in our
[1:00:36] image and in our
[1:00:39] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:00:41] the fishes of uh the seed and over the
[1:00:44] fowls of the earth and over uh the Earth
[1:00:47] and every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:00:49] upon the Earth so God created man in His
[1:00:53] image and in the image of God
[1:00:56] created he him male and female created
[1:01:00] he them praise the Lord now when you
[1:01:05] when you read Genesis chapter one where
[1:01:10] this whole thing of uh that looks like
[1:01:13] uh uh uh uh a confusion or the
[1:01:17] misinterpretation and also uh uh a
[1:01:21] doctrine of uh multiple gods have come
[1:01:25] out of the here is because in the in the
[1:01:28] Hebrew the word god year is
[1:01:32] Elohim and Elohim have a pural
[1:01:38] sense so the the the the the translator
[1:01:42] Year trying to use that word
[1:01:45] Elohim and he's he's he's he's
[1:01:49] expressing it in the sense of let us
[1:01:53] because if Elohim is having in a pural
[1:01:57] sense praise the Lord amen let let me
[1:02:00] give you an
[1:02:03] example
[1:02:06] uh a
[1:02:08] cherub one of the
[1:02:11] Angels okay that is around the throne a
[1:02:14] cherub you will you will see that in in
[1:02:18] the in the Hebrew one is a cherub two is
[1:02:23] cherubin that without an s
[1:02:28] you see in some translation they have an
[1:02:30] S it should not have an S one is a
[1:02:33] cherub more than one cherubin not s now
[1:02:38] that is the same sense with the word
[1:02:44] Elohim the word Elohim you see you you
[1:02:47] you remember when brother BR would talk
[1:02:49] about El
[1:02:51] Elohim so Elohim has a sense a a it's
[1:02:56] it's a plural
[1:02:58] word and I think that's word this uh uh
[1:03:03] uh uh uh translation from the Hebrew the
[1:03:07] Greek and the English that brings us
[1:03:10] this sense of let us make men but then
[1:03:14] in verse 27 the Bible says God make men
[1:03:17] not they make men praise the Lord amen
[1:03:23] if it was more than one then it should
[1:03:25] be
[1:03:26] they make man in their
[1:03:30] image but it is one
[1:03:33] God praise the Lord so God made Man In
[1:03:38] His Image male and female created he
[1:03:43] them praise the Lord
[1:03:47] amen so the Lord bless you this morning
[1:03:50] and uh
[1:03:52] uh uh it's going to be in the house of
[1:03:55] the Lord and and uh uh we want to thank
[1:03:59] God for giving us this opportunity like
[1:04:01] I said we we started talking to
[1:04:03] something on Wednesday night and uh uh
[1:04:06] Matthew chapter
[1:04:09] 1 let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:04:19] 1 praise the Lord you have to remember
[1:04:22] now we we uh dwelling a little bit on on
[1:04:25] the subject of the Virgin birth praise
[1:04:28] the Lord we've been dwelling on the
[1:04:31] subject of the Virgin
[1:04:38] birth because we say the Virgin birth is
[1:04:42] is one of the most important subject in
[1:04:46] the Bible praise the Lord the Virgin
[1:04:49] birth is tied to the promise of uh
[1:04:52] Genesis 3:15 the seed of the woman shall
[1:04:56] bruise the head of the sepin praise the
[1:04:59] Lord amen and is because God put the
[1:05:03] mystery the Redemption in the woman and
[1:05:06] uh and he gives the woman three sacri
[1:05:09] virtue to protect that mystery of
[1:05:11] redemption praise the Lord amen through
[1:05:15] sacri virtue her the Virgin say her
[1:05:18] motherhood her Womanhood and her
[1:05:20] motherhood and uh uh uh you can pick up
[1:05:24] all of that from uh
[1:05:26] um uh invisible union now so uh uh we
[1:05:32] went over this uh the couple of two
[1:05:35] services that if you ever get the Virgin
[1:05:38] birth straighten out you get
[1:05:40] Christianity straighten
[1:05:42] out amen that's what we have been
[1:05:45] talking about if you get the Virgin
[1:05:48] birth straightened out you get
[1:05:50] Christianity straighten out the early
[1:05:52] church after the
[1:05:53] Reformation uh uh uh when when uh when
[1:05:56] Luther came out of the Catholic Church
[1:05:59] the the subject on the Virgin birth was
[1:06:01] a big uh uh argument there was a big uh
[1:06:05] uh uh uh you know argument
[1:06:09] dispute and uh uh zling and a lot of the
[1:06:13] other guys that came out from the
[1:06:16] Revival of of
[1:06:21] Luther their understanding of the Virgin
[1:06:25] birth was
[1:06:26] there uh
[1:06:30] uh Jesus the son of Joseph called the
[1:06:34] Son of
[1:06:35] God that was their understanding of uh
[1:06:39] of the Virgin birth Jesus the son of
[1:06:41] Joseph called the Son of God because if
[1:06:44] you look into Matthew account and Luke
[1:06:48] account you will realize that Matthew
[1:06:52] talking about the kingship of Jesus
[1:06:56] we we we deal with this before but uh
[1:06:59] just to to to give a context to what we
[1:07:01] are saying Matthew chapter 1 let's go
[1:07:04] back to Matthew chapter 1 verse one
[1:07:08] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 1 verse
[1:07:10] one the book of uh the generation of
[1:07:13] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[1:07:16] Abraham which of course that's our
[1:07:18] attraction there Abraham was before
[1:07:21] David why the Matthew say the son of
[1:07:24] David the son of Abraham
[1:07:26] in actual context it must be the son of
[1:07:29] Abraham the son of
[1:07:31] David praise the Lord but Matthew said
[1:07:34] this because he was going to make
[1:07:37] emphasis on the
[1:07:38] kingship he was going to make emphasis
[1:07:41] on the promise that was given to David
[1:07:44] that his seed will be on the
[1:07:47] throne so Matthew was Matthew the entire
[1:07:52] Matthew account there is no there is no
[1:07:55] account that record the wise men coming
[1:07:57] and say where is he born King of the
[1:07:59] Jews beside Matthew Matthew is the only
[1:08:02] one that recorded there because Matthew
[1:08:05] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:08] he was going to talk about the
[1:08:11] kingship from David to Jesus because
[1:08:15] Jesus was the son of David that was
[1:08:18] going to sit on the throne of David
[1:08:22] forever not now but in the millennium
[1:08:26] are we together amen praise the Lord so
[1:08:31] Matthew here under the inspiration of
[1:08:33] the Holy Ghost he comes out and he says
[1:08:36] the son of Jesus I mean the generation
[1:08:39] of Jesus Christ the son of David and the
[1:08:42] son of Abraham now so if you go through
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:46] entire uh uh uh uh uh genealogy there in
[1:08:52] Matthew chapter one you will realize
[1:08:55] that Matthew established the fact that
[1:08:59] from David amen that was given the
[1:09:03] promise of the kingship the lineage run
[1:09:08] down and Joseph that will marry married
[1:09:12] she was a son of David I mean he was a
[1:09:17] son of David he he's in the
[1:09:19] lineage with
[1:09:22] David praise the Lord now you can now
[1:09:25] see why zling and the rest of them will
[1:09:29] said Jesus the son of Joseph called the
[1:09:34] Son of
[1:09:35] God why because Joseph lineage go back
[1:09:39] to
[1:09:41] David but if you go in the Book of Luke
[1:09:44] you will also
[1:09:46] realize that the genealogy that is given
[1:09:50] in the Book of Ruth relates to Mary not
[1:09:53] Joseph
[1:09:57] praise the Lord no is not Joseph but it
[1:10:01] still goes back to David but it don't go
[1:10:05] back to David through Solomon Joseph
[1:10:08] lineage go back to David through Solomon
[1:10:11] Mary lineage go back to David through
[1:10:15] naon because Solomon had another Son by
[1:10:18] BBA called
[1:10:22] naon are we together
[1:10:26] oh I finish giving you a Bible
[1:10:29] studies you can just go study that the
[1:10:32] rest of the week the rest of the
[1:10:34] year amen so uh uh uh so you see
[1:10:38] everything goes back to
[1:10:41] David because that's the scepter of Abra
[1:10:44] that's the scepter of isra that's the
[1:10:48] kingship so the two geny you will
[1:10:51] realize h mark never gave a genology
[1:10:55] no because Mark all his thing was about
[1:10:59] seven he was about seven so he never
[1:11:01] gave no genology John gave his own
[1:11:04] genology but John own was back to what
[1:11:07] happened on the island of pmos he went
[1:11:09] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:11:11] was with God and you know he went way
[1:11:13] back before even
[1:11:16] David are we
[1:11:18] together now so I I'm I'm saying all of
[1:11:21] this for us to be able to see
[1:11:26] the importance of the Virgin
[1:11:30] birath praise the
[1:11:32] Lord the importance of the Virgin birth
[1:11:37] if we can get the Virgin birth straight
[1:11:40] we'll get all of this confusion out of
[1:11:43] Christianity the Virgin birth holds the
[1:11:47] Mystery of
[1:11:49] Life praise the Lord I'll give you just
[1:11:53] a scene here we read Genesis chapter
[1:11:56] one the Earth was a
[1:12:01] virgin and God was going to bring life
[1:12:04] on the earth God did not had to contact
[1:12:08] Council of men or Council of
[1:12:10] angels and that's the reason why we read
[1:12:13] that verse he says let us make
[1:12:16] man praise the Lord and God made Man In
[1:12:22] His Image it was God that did it
[1:12:27] praise the Lord that's the same thing
[1:12:29] with the Virgin birth it was God that
[1:12:31] did it he just borrowed the womb he
[1:12:35] provided the blood cell he provided the
[1:12:38] egg
[1:12:41] cell praise the Lord the same way he
[1:12:44] brought man in the
[1:12:46] beginning the first man the first
[1:12:53] item praise the Lord
[1:12:55] the first Adam came with no human
[1:13:01] contribution the second Adam came the
[1:13:04] same way with no human
[1:13:11] involvement praise the Lord Mary was
[1:13:14] just like the
[1:13:16] Earth just like the Earth receed the
[1:13:19] first Adam when God made
[1:13:22] man that was the same word Mary received
[1:13:25] the second
[1:13:29] Adam praise the Lord and if God will
[1:13:33] ever bring forth children he will bring
[1:13:36] forth his children the very same
[1:13:41] way nothing of your natural birth is
[1:13:45] attached to God's
[1:13:49] birth the church have all sorts of
[1:13:52] explanation for the new birth you have
[1:13:54] to do this you have to do that to be
[1:13:56] born again you have to confess to be
[1:13:58] born again you have to that that just
[1:14:00] what man has
[1:14:03] established to have some other in their
[1:14:06] denomination but what God will do God
[1:14:10] Alone will do
[1:14:16] it praise the
[1:14:19] Lord
[1:14:21] amen we love the Lord this morning
[1:14:25] ready for the word of
[1:14:29] God
[1:14:33] Amen praise the Lord don't worry as we
[1:14:37] go down this uh this series we we'll get
[1:14:40] into the the genealogy I will show you
[1:14:43] where where the difference comes in
[1:14:45] Matthew and Luke uh as we go along not
[1:14:48] today but I will show you there uh uh
[1:14:52] praise the Lord amen
[1:14:55] but if you go home just just read both
[1:14:57] of them you will see that it's it's it's
[1:15:00] a little bit different and uh Matthew
[1:15:03] starts with David and Solomon and he
[1:15:06] goes down Luke introduced nurn and he
[1:15:09] goes down because that's where Mary Lage
[1:15:13] came
[1:15:15] from praise the
[1:15:20] Lord amen
[1:15:27] You Know The Enemy was trying
[1:15:32] to he was trying to attack us on this
[1:15:36] subject you know and
[1:15:39] uh but I still feel in my heart that's
[1:15:42] what the Lord want me to speak
[1:15:44] on praise the
[1:15:47] Lord so uh
[1:16:15] Hallelujah now so as we look into this
[1:16:18] subject
[1:16:30] I'm trying to get
[1:16:34] something that is also important we have
[1:16:36] spoken on it before and
[1:16:40] uh but as we as we look into
[1:16:43] this we just want to kind of a recap
[1:16:48] here with uh some of the things that we
[1:16:49] have look
[1:16:52] at praise the Lord now so Matthew
[1:16:55] chapter 1 verse uh 18 that's where we
[1:16:59] were reading
[1:17:22] from and we read uh now the birth of
[1:17:26] Jesus was on this
[1:17:31] wise when as his mother Mary was exposed
[1:17:34] to Joseph before they came together she
[1:17:37] was found with child of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:42] praise the Lord amen and I believe that
[1:17:46] is uh the the the misunderstanding of
[1:17:49] the Virgin birth that also uh uh brings
[1:17:54] the the teach teaching of the Trinity
[1:17:56] the Trinity is not a Biblical teaching
[1:17:58] it cannot be proven by the
[1:18:00] scripture but it's is because of the
[1:18:03] misunderstanding of the of the Virgin
[1:18:05] birth because if you even look right
[1:18:07] here you will see that the Bible says
[1:18:10] she's formed with child of the Holy
[1:18:12] Ghost and uh uh uh and then you go down
[1:18:16] and read uh uh
[1:18:25] the scripture will let us know that uh
[1:18:29] uh ACC calling to the promise in verse
[1:18:31] 22 now all of this was done that it
[1:18:34] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:18:37] the spoken of the Lord by the prophet
[1:18:40] saying Behold a virgin shall uh shall be
[1:18:44] with chai and shall bring forth a son
[1:18:47] and they shall called his name Emmanuel
[1:18:50] which is being in in which being
[1:18:53] interpreted is God with us praise the
[1:18:57] Lord amen so it is it is just like uh uh
[1:19:02] in the beginning when God made Man In
[1:19:04] His Image the first Adam he was the
[1:19:07] amateure God on the earth you know it
[1:19:09] was God making a Man In His Image the
[1:19:12] Bible say God is a spirit you know uh so
[1:19:16] Genesis
[1:19:17] 1:26 that man that was made was a spirit
[1:19:20] man Genesis chapter 2:7 God put that
[1:19:23] spirit in flesh flesh praise the Lord
[1:19:27] just like God coming in flesh in
[1:19:31] Jesus are we together amen praise the
[1:19:35] Lord amen God made Man In His Image as a
[1:19:39] spirit man in Genesis CH 2:7 the Bible
[1:19:43] says and God formed Man Out of the Dust
[1:19:46] of the earth and breath into man and Man
[1:19:49] became a living Soul so the spirit man
[1:19:51] that was made here was now put in a
[1:19:55] they are we
[1:19:57] together praise the Lord amen God
[1:20:01] speaking to Mary here the angel saying
[1:20:04] the the holy the holy spirit will
[1:20:06] overshadow you and that and that thing
[1:20:08] that that child that will be born it
[1:20:11] will be of the Holy Ghost and at the end
[1:20:14] the Bible says it will be what God With
[1:20:21] Us Praise the Lord
[1:20:26] amen so it is just God manifesting in uh
[1:20:31] uh uh in three different
[1:20:33] office the god uh that that that led the
[1:20:37] children of Israel in in uh in in the
[1:20:40] father hold by the pillow of fire he's
[1:20:42] now coming and dwelling in the body
[1:20:46] flesh of which he produced the blood
[1:20:49] cells he produced the AEG cells you know
[1:20:51] it it it it it will not be connected to
[1:20:54] the fall to the sin of man because he
[1:20:57] has to be the Lamb of God to take away
[1:21:00] the sin of the
[1:21:01] word praise the Lord and God will come
[1:21:05] and step in that
[1:21:08] body amen
[1:21:11] amen to be able to pay the ramom for fly
[1:21:15] man to redeem us back to
[1:21:22] God praise the Lord
[1:21:26] amen so I uh uh I know I'm going in
[1:21:30] Cycles this morning because I'm I'm
[1:21:33] trying to to uh to find a place to stand
[1:21:36] this morning I want us to look at
[1:21:39] something a little bit uh different in
[1:21:42] the same light but a little bit
[1:21:43] different so we can get into this
[1:21:46] subject let's read this together we will
[1:21:48] read something out of the s that church
[1:21:51] Edge and uh uh and then we will that I
[1:21:54] will I will study from there this
[1:21:56] morning I hope you you have breakfast
[1:21:59] this morning
[1:22:01] amen amen if you did that you just like
[1:22:05] me and I didn't have breakfast so I
[1:22:07] won't keep you long
[1:22:10] amen let's look at that this morning
[1:22:12] from the seminar Church
[1:22:16] age I know there's a question in your
[1:22:19] mind when we talk about this whole
[1:22:22] virgin birth birath of a thing uh I want
[1:22:24] for us to look at this you will want to
[1:22:27] know if I believe in the doctrine of
[1:22:33] preexistence Praise the Lord now look at
[1:22:36] this word pre-existence the reason why
[1:22:39] we must look at it and pay attention to
[1:22:41] it is because in many sense the way we
[1:22:46] understand
[1:22:47] predestination is wrong we understand
[1:22:50] predestination in the sense of
[1:22:52] preexistence
[1:22:55] is a lot of this things Doctrine is not
[1:22:59] biblical praise the Lord the reason why
[1:23:02] is not biblical because I have a birth
[1:23:06] date amen amen I have a birthdaye that
[1:23:10] October 1 that was the day I
[1:23:15] began that was the day this body was
[1:23:19] born before that time this body did not
[1:23:23] exist
[1:23:28] are we
[1:23:33] together you got to put on your seat
[1:23:36] belt now because we we we're going to
[1:23:38] talk about serious stuff
[1:23:42] here you want to know if I believe in
[1:23:45] the doctrine of preexistence I don't
[1:23:47] believe in the M's Doctrine
[1:23:50] or the preexistence of Soul anymore then
[1:23:54] I Believe In
[1:23:56] recognation Praise the Lord all that
[1:23:59] comes from uh uh uh you know the the
[1:24:02] Hindus and all of their believing there
[1:24:05] all the transmigration of
[1:24:10] souls now if we don't study the word
[1:24:13] properly there are a lot of things in
[1:24:15] the way we see it and in the way we
[1:24:18] understand it we comes to apply this
[1:24:21] just like the same I said you know uh uh
[1:24:26] uh uh uh many many churches will will
[1:24:31] want to uh uh uh put the whole uh uh
[1:24:35] holy Virgin Mary thing on the Catholic
[1:24:37] church but many of the the the the the
[1:24:42] churches and and in the way that we
[1:24:44] think about it uh uh we come shut off
[1:24:47] the same the same teaching if we are
[1:24:50] given the the opportunity to express
[1:24:53] what we understand we will up the same
[1:24:55] place where the Catholic end up and
[1:24:57] that's what I believe that many message
[1:25:00] believer will end up explaining uh
[1:25:03] predestination to the
[1:25:06] pre-existence which of course that's not
[1:25:09] that's not
[1:25:11] biblical Let's Stay Together this
[1:25:14] morning be careful here and see this
[1:25:18] that's what I want you to see that's
[1:25:20] what I want us to see this morning be
[1:25:23] careful here and see this it is not the
[1:25:28] person that comes
[1:25:31] predestinated internally from God it is
[1:25:36] not the person that comes
[1:25:40] predestinated praise the Lord why
[1:25:44] because you have a birth
[1:25:49] date are we
[1:25:51] together amen
[1:25:58] are you having church this
[1:26:00] morning it's not the person that comes
[1:26:03] predestinated internally from God it is
[1:26:07] the
[1:26:09] word it is the word it is the
[1:26:14] seed and a word is a thought
[1:26:21] Express it is not you as a person not me
[1:26:25] as a person that comes predestinated
[1:26:29] no it's the thought of
[1:26:33] God
[1:26:35] Amen because God's thought are
[1:26:40] interal praise the
[1:26:42] Lord are we together his thoughts are in
[1:26:48] tenner so in his internal thoughts
[1:26:51] before there were time
[1:26:56] he destinated in ages what he would
[1:27:00] do are we together amen and and that
[1:27:06] predestinated thought of God will find a
[1:27:14] bing are we together praise the Lord
[1:27:19] amen his predestinated thought will find
[1:27:23] a b
[1:27:25] when the prophet said a virgin shall
[1:27:27] conceive the prophet never said the
[1:27:30] Virgin
[1:27:31] Mary the prophet said a
[1:27:36] virgin and Mary was not the only
[1:27:40] virgin are we together but that

[1:27:46] body that the word will be fulfilled
[1:27:52] in are we together
[1:27:55] praise the
[1:27:56] Lord so it's not the person that's the
[1:27:59] reason why people can shout and
[1:28:02] predestinated kick their shoes up oh I'm
[1:28:04] predestinated and this that and and then
[1:28:06] after a while you find them drinking

[1:29:11] predestinated internally from God it is
[1:29:14] the word or the
[1:29:16] seed that is it way back too far back
[1:29:21] for the human mind to Gras the interal
[1:29:25] God H uh with interal thoughts thought
[1:29:30] and
[1:29:32] decreed Jacob I

[1:31:54] trying to give us a scene that it
[1:31:57] happened like this this birth of Jesus
[1:32:00] happened like this and and and and an
[1:32:03] angel met uh uh uh this young
[1:32:10] woman and and and uh

[1:33:26] from the foundation of the
[1:33:28] word he put a date to it and that date
[1:33:32] came
[1:33:33] pass when he ready for you he will get
[1:33:38] you he put a date to it on his
[1:33:45] calendar praise the Lord
[1:33:48] hallelujah oh the the the church is
[1:33:50] trying to produce uh h h h uh
[1:33:54] example of Mary and says well you know
[1:33:57] you you can be a non you know poor white
[1:33:59] hair Mary were not wearing hair
[1:34:02] tie Mary was dressing like any normal
[1:34:05] Juda
[1:34:07] girl praise the Lord living her normal
[1:34:11] life she was not in a
[1:34:15] Convent praise the
[1:34:17] Lord amen the only Convent that Mary had
[1:34:21] was this word of God
[1:34:24] Amen in the Torah that told her that she
[1:34:28] she she she had to keep herself until
[1:34:30] she's married that the only Convent that
[1:34:32] Mary
[1:34:33] had there was not s Teresa there was not
[1:34:36] s Mary there was not s
[1:34:41] Susanna praise the Lord but she was
[1:34:44] going about her normal
[1:34:46] life but a
[1:34:48] prophet 700 years have prophesied that a
[1:34:52] virgin shall
[1:34:56] conceive praise the Lord there was a
[1:34:59] word from the prophet Isaiah that said
[1:35:03] Israel I will give you a
[1:35:06] sign praise the Lord I will give you a
[1:35:10] sign a virgin shall
[1:35:16] conceive are we together praise the Lord
[1:35:20] hallelujah the preacher has preached the
[1:35:23] pastor has talked about it and over and
[1:35:25] over I mean they went to church they had
[1:35:28] read it in the Bible and all of
[1:35:32] that are we
[1:35:34] together but God was
[1:35:37] determined because according to his
[1:35:39] counsel his word do not
[1:35:43] fail God word do not fail it do not fall
[1:35:46] to the
[1:35:49] ground praise the Lord who would be that
[1:35:52] virgin is God God's
[1:35:55] choice praise the Lord amen it's God's
[1:35:59] choice if you even look in our natural
[1:36:02] birth by
[1:36:05] signs the couple can say we want a boy
[1:36:08] child you know we want a girl child and
[1:36:10] this this but it's God that determine
[1:36:12] that
[1:36:15] choice because he choose a set blood
[1:36:18] cell from the male and a set in the
[1:36:21] midst of the million cells
[1:36:25] for you to be
[1:36:27] here there were hundreds of other cell
[1:36:30] if God will have chosing something
[1:36:32] different it will not be
[1:36:35] you praise the Lord amen when that blood
[1:36:40] cells were released there were thousands
[1:36:42] and millions of gem but God was the one
[1:36:45] that choose this one and he choose this
[1:36:49] Exel praise the Lord praise the Lord and
[1:36:53] He brought it together for you to have a
[1:36:59] birthday praise the Lord if God was not
[1:37:03] determined if it was never in his
[1:37:05] thought if it did not pass through his
[1:37:07] mind that you came on Earth amen you
[1:37:11] will never be yet you will not remember
[1:37:14] you will not know nothing about
[1:37:16] it you w know nothing about it
[1:37:24] are we
[1:37:26] together what are we trying to to
[1:37:29] emphasize this morning is the councel of
[1:37:33] God standing
[1:37:36] Shore amen the counsel of God standed
[1:37:41] sure and what God is determined there is
[1:37:44] no political power amen there is no
[1:37:48] situation around the world that is going
[1:37:50] to stop it
[1:37:57] glory be to God because prophecy is
[1:38:01] stronger than
[1:38:05] politics when God has
[1:38:07] spoken it's going to be just as he
[1:38:11] said
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:16] hallelujah and we continue to read then
[1:38:19] Joseph her husband being a just man
[1:38:23] and now willing to make a public example
[1:38:26] was mindful to put her away privately
[1:38:28] because he couldn't he couldn't
[1:38:29] understand this thing he couldn't
[1:38:31] understand this thing how how can this
[1:38:33] young woman have not slept with her how
[1:38:35] can she be how can she come to me and
[1:38:36] tell me that she's
[1:38:39] pregnant praise the Lord he couldn't
[1:38:43] understand it he said okay I'm not going
[1:38:44] to I'm not going to mess with
[1:38:47] this okay I'm not going to f with her
[1:38:50] either because she's telling me an angel
[1:38:52] spoke to her praise the Lord so I'll put
[1:38:55] it away
[1:38:58] privately and why he taught on these
[1:39:00] things because God was
[1:39:03] determined why he was thinking on it
[1:39:06] praise the Lord because God was
[1:39:09] determined and God also had him in a
[1:39:12] program why because he's from the
[1:39:15] lineage of
[1:39:17] David praise the Lord and this child is
[1:39:21] tied to the promise of David's
[1:39:25] strong
[1:39:28] Hallelujah so the Bible says God visited
[1:39:32] him in the night and why he taught on
[1:39:34] these things behold the angel the angel
[1:39:38] the same angel that spoke to Mary of the
[1:39:41] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[1:39:43] Joseph thy son of David fear not to take
[1:39:45] unto thee married thy wife amen that's
[1:39:52] your wife but I'm on a
[1:39:55] mission God is saying that's your wife
[1:39:58] boy but I'm on a
[1:39:59] mission don't be afraid to take her
[1:40:03] Hallelujah for that which is conceived
[1:40:06] in her is of the Holy Ghost and she
[1:40:08] shall bring for the son and thou shall
[1:40:10] call his name Jesus for he shall save
[1:40:13] his people from their sin praise the
[1:40:16] Lord hallelujah you see and that's
[1:40:19] that's that's that's the thing where uh
[1:40:22] a false teaching would do
[1:40:23] what a false teaching does is that a
[1:40:26] false teaching can be smart it can be
[1:40:28] very clever but it it it Rob the thought
[1:40:31] of the
[1:40:33] power because if you establish Trinity
[1:40:37] and put a God in heaven and leave a son
[1:40:39] on the earth and put a spirit to Holy
[1:40:42] Ghost to just be running around what you
[1:40:44] do is that you leave a vulnerable man on
[1:40:47] the earth while the power is still in
[1:40:51] heaven praise the Lord but Jesus said
[1:40:55] all power in heaven and on Earth I gave
[1:41:00] to
[1:41:04] me praise the
[1:41:07] Lord are we
[1:41:10] together so this was God the very same
[1:41:16] Creator and that's the reason why it's
[1:41:18] now hard to understand when God created
[1:41:21] man in His image that's what the Bible
[1:41:27] says so when he when he had Adam there
[1:41:30] and and and structure a body all the
[1:41:33] spirit did was just to step in that
[1:41:38] body if we can understand that then to
[1:41:41] understand the birth of Jesus it has to
[1:41:44] be the
[1:41:46] same it has to be the same Creator God
[1:41:50] it has to be the same Elohim that
[1:41:52] stepped down into that
[1:41:58] body praise the
[1:42:04] Lord are we
[1:42:08] together now all these things were done
[1:42:10] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:42:12] spoken of the Lord by a prophet saying
[1:42:15] Behold a virgin shall be with child and
[1:42:19] shall bring forth a son and they shall
[1:42:21] call his name Emmanuel
[1:42:23] World which being interpreted is God
[1:42:27] With Us Praise the Lord so all of this
[1:42:31] is
[1:42:32] fulfilled because a prophet said it
[1:42:35] praise the Lord amen hallelujah and
[1:42:39] everything today is happening because a
[1:42:42] prophet said it hallelujah amen there's
[1:42:46] going to be a bride because a prophet
[1:42:49] said it there's going to be a Rapture
[1:42:51] because a prophet said it
[1:42:53] praise the Lord and if a prophet said it
[1:42:56] God will God will find a
[1:42:59] people amen God will gather a
[1:43:03] body there are people that God will
[1:43:06] preserve that will not taste
[1:43:09] death why because a prophet said it
[1:43:13] there's a people in the twinkling of an
[1:43:15] eye that will be changed they will step
[1:43:18] out of this body and step into a brand
[1:43:20] new body why because a Prophet said
[1:43:27] it all of
[1:43:29] this is fulfilled because a prophet said
[1:43:36] it
[1:43:37] hallelujah oh my the word of the Lord is
[1:43:43] beautiful amen the word of the Lord is
[1:43:49] beautiful glory be to God Hal
[1:43:54] hallelujah
[1:43:56] amen you know one time someone was
[1:43:58] talking to brother brandom about this
[1:44:00] same old virgin birth thing and the guy
[1:44:02] was saying you I mean you're too smart
[1:44:05] to believe
[1:44:06] that you know you're too smart to
[1:44:09] believe there how how can you believe in
[1:44:12] in in in every form of
[1:44:15] nature if there will be birth even in
[1:44:18] the plant life if there will be birth
[1:44:20] there has to be uh uh the coming
[1:44:22] together of the male and the female so
[1:44:25] how can you believe that you know
[1:44:26] brother B went down and told the God and
[1:44:28] says you know uh the thing about it that
[1:44:31] is that uh
[1:44:34] uh how did the
[1:44:36] first man came here if everything has to
[1:44:39] have a father and a
[1:44:41] mother amen when the first man came
[1:44:44] there was not father and mother but he
[1:44:46] was here praise the Lord amen and he
[1:44:51] also starts to to show and prove that uh
[1:44:54] uh uh uh you know the real thing of
[1:44:59] life you can't prove
[1:45:03] it
[1:45:07] amen you know he went down uh uh uh and
[1:45:10] and and he was asking the guide and says
[1:45:12] uh uh uh uh do you love your wife he
[1:45:16] said yes brother Braham says prove it to
[1:45:19] me he says show it show it to me you
[1:45:22] know reach in your life show it visibly
[1:45:25] let me see
[1:45:28] it praise the Lord
[1:45:32] amen reach inside and let me see
[1:45:40] it we believe we have we have
[1:45:44] soul that's what's make us superior to
[1:45:46] the animals but there's no doctor that
[1:45:49] can operate you and find your soul
[1:45:55] no doctor can operate you and find your
[1:46:00] soul praise the Lord but your soul is
[1:46:06] real amen your soul is real it's
[1:46:13] there glory be to
[1:46:20] God
[1:46:21] hallelujah so you see that's the reason
[1:46:25] why you know there's a there's a there's
[1:46:29] a whole lot of thing uh uh uh uh you
[1:46:33] know uh the the the the real things of
[1:46:37] this life are
[1:46:41] Supernatural praise the Lord that's what
[1:46:43] the scripture says the scripture says
[1:46:45] the thing that we see they are
[1:46:48] perishable the ones that we can see they
[1:46:51] are perishable
[1:46:54] this body will come to a to a time where
[1:46:56] it gives its last
[1:46:58] birth it will be lied down in a cold uh
[1:47:02] uh Earth covered with
[1:47:05] dirt it had the day that it was born it
[1:47:08] will had the time that it would
[1:47:11] die but your soul lays
[1:47:17] on praise the Lord
[1:47:24] but you see because because we are we
[1:47:27] are we are very narrow-minded in our
[1:47:30] human sense we put lot of emphasis and
[1:47:33] importance on the perishable things
[1:47:36] because that's what we can
[1:47:40] see praise the Lord you see and that's
[1:47:43] that's the reason for the for the fifth
[1:47:45] sense because the sense of
[1:47:48] faith comes to be able to help you
[1:47:53] to look at the things that you can see
[1:47:55] with your natural
[1:47:58] eyes it give you a sense that you have a
[1:48:01] soul that when this body lays to the
[1:48:04] ground there is a part of you that will
[1:48:06] stand before
[1:48:13] God praise the
[1:48:21] Lord oh what a wonderful Jesus we
[1:48:25] Ser
[1:48:26] Hallelujah so you understand the thought
[1:48:30] that we try to establish there that is
[1:48:32] the seed that comes predestinated it's
[1:48:35] not the
[1:48:36] person it's not the individual is the
[1:48:40] seed is the promised
[1:48:42] word praise the Lord the reason why you
[1:48:46] can you can you can believe that I'm a
[1:48:48] predestinated seed is because you have
[1:48:51] received the word
[1:48:53] that you are identifying with you are
[1:48:55] identifying with the
[1:48:57] word amen you are identifying with what
[1:49:01] God is doing in this day and what God is
[1:49:04] doing in your
[1:49:09] life but it's not the person that comes
[1:49:12] predestinated it's the
[1:49:14] word amen let me give you an example
[1:49:18] here if you drop down yet a little bit
[1:49:20] let's read something out of Christ is
[1:49:22] the mystery of God God revealed that's
[1:49:23] something we have read before follow me
[1:49:26] here all those all those things type
[1:49:29] him just a type but yet the mystery was
[1:49:34] HD then men didn't know what they were
[1:49:37] doing the Old Testament
[1:49:41] types David was a type of
[1:49:44] Christ when he was
[1:49:47] rejected praise the Lord but David did
[1:49:49] not know
[1:49:50] that we are SA
[1:49:53] that he was a type of Christ why because
[1:49:55] we can look at the life of Jesus and
[1:49:57] look at the life of David but for David
[1:50:01] it was a serious matter my son Absalon
[1:50:04] has kicked me off the throne for David
[1:50:08] it was a presentence
[1:50:10] event amen but for God he God was
[1:50:15] playing out something in the life of
[1:50:18] David that will speak about Christ
[1:50:23] are we together so you see the word the
[1:50:27] word of God that God promise concerning
[1:50:31] the rejected
[1:50:33] King praise the Lord at the time for
[1:50:37] that word to be
[1:50:39] fulfill God got a man after his own
[1:50:43] heart called
[1:50:44] David praise the Lord because if you
[1:50:48] don't if you don't balance
[1:50:51] it if if David was predestinated then
[1:50:55] every part of his life was
[1:51:00] no that's the reason why it goes back to
[1:51:06] Redemption
[1:51:08] amen Joseph was a perfect type of
[1:51:13] Jesus he was rejected by his brothers he
[1:51:17] was put into prison and there were two
[1:51:19] criminals in prison with him praise Lord
[1:51:23] you look at the life of Joseph it was a
[1:51:25] perfect time but when Joseph came to the
[1:51:28] place and told a lie that was not a type
[1:51:31] of Jesus
[1:51:33] amen amen and because it was not a type
[1:51:36] of Jesus it was not a predestinated seed
[1:51:39] at that
[1:51:43] time are you understanding
[1:51:46] it praise the Lord because you see this
[1:51:49] is the thing that makes people caress in
[1:51:52] their Christian walk well if I would go
[1:51:54] to hell I would go to hell if God know I
[1:51:56] would go to hell if I will go to heaven
[1:51:57] I will go to heaven God know I will go
[1:51:59] to heaven so what I should
[1:52:01] do God knows but you don't
[1:52:05] know praise the Lord he knows but you
[1:52:08] don't know and if he's determined he
[1:52:11] might drag you on the ground just like
[1:52:14] he made
[1:52:15] NEC H Nebuchadnezzar to eat grass
[1:52:19] because God was determined to show his
[1:52:21] power
[1:52:25] praise the
[1:52:26] Lord that's why God sometimes keep
[1:52:29] people on sick bed they are all in pains
[1:52:32] because he don't want to lose them he
[1:52:34] want to give them an opportunity to stay
[1:52:36] right on that bed and repent of all
[1:52:38] their
[1:52:43] sin praise the Lord when we have the
[1:52:46] grace to be conscious of our life and
[1:52:49] live the best that we can do for God
[1:52:53] sometimes we get into a
[1:52:55] very silly
[1:53:02] thought all because we our mind is the
[1:53:06] way you understand predestination is
[1:53:09] pre-existence you did not preexist it no
[1:53:14] it was God's thought in his
[1:53:16] mind praise the Lord and that thought of
[1:53:20] God was spoken by a prophet
[1:53:23] a world went out and God was looking for
[1:53:26] the bride just like Abraham sent a
[1:53:29] messenger to look for the bride when El
[1:53:32] Isa went he did not know who would be
[1:53:34] the bride he just went looking for the
[1:53:37] woman amen I want to find a woman for my
[1:53:40] master son Isaac need to be married he
[1:53:43] is the he of the home he was just
[1:53:46] goinging praise the Lord
[1:53:50] hallelujah I I'm I'm I'm I sure believe
[1:53:53] that he saw a girl that he likes and
[1:53:56] said let me observe this one he watched
[1:53:59] her for the
[1:54:00] while and then in tell minute she show
[1:54:02] another color oh no no no no no no no no
[1:54:06] no no no praise the Lord in his human
[1:54:11] s amen there are things that he admire
[1:54:16] himly there are abilities that we have
[1:54:20] but that's not what God is looking for
[1:54:23] no that's not what God is looking for
[1:54:26] he's looking for a bearing ground for
[1:54:28] his word that that when that word drop
[1:54:31] in that bearing ground you will forget
[1:54:34] about your abilities you will forget
[1:54:36] about whatever you are and you will say
[1:54:39] be it unto me according to your
[1:54:51] word he is I being the seven he
[1:54:56] prophesied he said oh
[1:55:00] God let it
[1:55:03] be let it be I have
[1:55:10] travel praise the
[1:55:12] Lord I have traveled with my men and the
[1:55:15] and the
[1:55:17] cels and we are tired Lord we have gone
[1:55:20] days and we have gone days
[1:55:23] Lord as we rest by the side of this
[1:55:26] well let it be
[1:55:31] father that the dam said that would
[1:55:36] come and show kindness unto
[1:55:41] us give me to
[1:55:43] drink and also give my cambers to
[1:55:49] drink it was a prophecy
[1:55:53] praise the Lord it was a
[1:55:56] prophecy he did not instruct
[1:55:59] it
[1:56:02] Rebecca
[1:56:04] no he did not even throw sand to her for
[1:56:07] her to be able to do
[1:56:09] it but because he was under a Divine
[1:56:15] commission the reason why it was so
[1:56:18] powerful because it was not only
[1:56:20] concerning Isaac they were also
[1:56:23] concerning the one that will find the
[1:56:25] bride for the one that Isaac
[1:56:30] type praise the
[1:56:33] Lord amen so when Ela said that God God
[1:56:39] put his breath behind
[1:56:41] it praise the Lord he put his breath
[1:56:45] behind it and the Breath of God cut the
[1:56:48] word of eler
[1:56:53] praise the Lord amen Rebecca did not go

[2:00:38] season in everything give
[2:00:42] thanks praise the Lord now you see it
[2:00:45] that is that is the place sometimes
[2:00:47] where h h h h uh uh Rel ReliOn trap
[2:00:53] us because in most thing that what we
[2:00:57] call the word of God I'm waiting on the
[2:01:00] word of God I'm praying for the word of
[2:01:03] God what you call the word of God is
[2:01:06] just your own
[2:01:10] desire it's just your own
[2:01:13] desire it is it is just a stubborn part
[2:01:16] in you that you don't want to let go
[2:01:22] praise the Lord because take for
[2:01:28] example glory be to
[2:01:30] God
[2:01:32] Amen someone gave this example and I I
[2:01:35] appreciate it they said if I say it's
[2:01:40] the word of God for me to be a
[2:01:44] singer what happen if I had an accident
[2:01:48] and I can't sing anymore am I out of the
[2:01:51] word of God
[2:01:56] praise the
[2:01:59] Lord amen if I take that is the word of
[2:02:03] God for me to be a
[2:02:06] preacher glory be to God what
[2:02:10] happened if something happened and I
[2:02:13] can't stand and preach anymore and I
[2:02:14] can't talk I'm I out of the word of God
[2:02:23] praise the
[2:02:24] Lord
[2:02:30] now oh you love the
[2:02:37] Lord God's will thatth if if you look
[2:02:40] there in Ephesians 3:11 the Bible
[2:02:43] declared it as his int of
[2:02:48] purpose God intend of purpose
[2:02:52] for your
[2:02:58] life he did now determine it in the
[2:03:03] career praise the
[2:03:05] Lord
[2:03:09] amen or a way of life this is very
[2:03:13] beautiful and this is very powerful I
[2:03:15] pray that the Lord can be able to bring
[2:03:16] it to our hearts this
[2:03:18] morning praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:03:22] because when God made us the Bible says
[2:03:25] he knows the fibus of our body he knows
[2:03:28] our the intent of our heart he knows
[2:03:31] what we can bear he knows the the level
[2:03:34] of our
[2:03:37] strength and how wonderful and
[2:03:40] beautiful excellent we were
[2:03:43] made because we are his
[2:03:48] handiwork praise the Lord
[2:03:51] you see that's the reason why the
[2:03:53] Apostle Paul expressed this thing
[2:03:55] because uh uh there's a thought behind
[2:03:57] it and the thought there is there he say
[2:04:00] in everything give thanks what is
[2:04:02] that that's your internal purpose that's
[2:04:06] the reason why you were made you were
[2:04:08] made to
[2:04:09] worship praise the Lord so while I'm on
[2:04:13] the pulpit preaching I must be able to
[2:04:15] worship God where I find myself I I must
[2:04:18] be able to so when that condition
[2:04:21] changed
[2:04:22] worship do not leave my
[2:04:25] heart that's right praise the Lord
[2:04:28] that's the reason why people say oh it
[2:04:31] was the word of God for me to be here I
[2:04:33] was supposed to be here that's the word
[2:04:34] of God now if they lose their position
[2:04:38] they don't want to worship God anymore
[2:04:41] because they take the word of God to be
[2:04:43] a career or a position or a condition
[2:04:52] that's the reason why the Apostle Paul
[2:04:54] says who shall separate us from the word
[2:04:57] of
[2:04:58] God Amen he said everything work
[2:05:02] together for
[2:05:04] good is just conditioning mean to bring
[2:05:08] more
[2:05:09] worship when the situation happen is
[2:05:13] conditioning mean to bring more
[2:05:17] worship because the word of God is for
[2:05:19] me to give thanks
[2:05:22] everything every
[2:05:24] condition that's what I was made for to
[2:05:27] worship when I'm broke I
[2:05:31] worship when I'm fil I
[2:05:37] worship so when worship is put un
[2:05:40] condition you put your worship on
[2:05:43] condition because of your present
[2:05:47] position you have not found the word of
[2:05:50] God yet amen praise the Lord you have
[2:05:54] not found the word of God
[2:06:05] yet oh
[2:06:07] hallelujah praise the
[2:06:09] Lord you love the
[2:06:12] Lord Michel chapter 6 ver8 the scripture

[2:06:34] director praise the
[2:06:35] Lord hallelujah realize this realize
[2:06:39] this that if you are the managing
[2:06:41] director if they fire you they do not
[2:06:43] cancel the
[2:06:47] position amen if it was the word of God
[2:06:50] for you as soon as they fire you they
[2:06:52] cancel the
[2:06:54] position but when they fire you they
[2:06:56] leave the position that they say for
[2:06:58] high we're looking for managing
[2:07:01] director praise the Lord amen then you
[2:07:05] go start applying somewhere your
[2:07:07] managing director position is

[2:07:24] concept we put all some of these banard
[2:07:27] things in the place and we fill our mind
[2:07:30] with it when God is trying to build
[2:07:34] character in
[2:07:35] you praise the Lord to bring you to the
[2:07:39] next level of relationship that's what
[2:07:41] God is interested in relationship
[2:07:52] he have shown theee oh man what is good
[2:07:55] and what does the Lord require of
[2:07:59] thee but to do
[2:08:02] justly and to love

[2:08:10] humbly with that
[2:08:12] God praise the
[2:08:15] Lord where is the pastor position in
[2:08:19] that amen

[2:08:24] pastor of this church when I'm even

[2:08:27] they don't want me I said no it's the
[2:08:28] word of
[2:08:36] God God's internal
[2:08:41] purpose that we mortal men are trying to
[2:08:46] reduce to perishable
[2:08:49] things praise the Lord perishable
[2:08:54] things the Lord wake us up every
[2:08:57] morning he gave us birth he gave us
[2:09:01] strength it's hard for us to quantify

[2:09:34] blessing we have reduced God to
[2:09:38] perishable
[2:09:49] things praise the Lord
[2:09:54] I don't know who is responsible for this
[2:09:55] because it's not in my
[2:09:59] notes I'm completely away from what I'm
[2:10:01] supposed to be preaching this morning

[2:10:06] to preach it praise the Lord
[2:10:11] hallelujah the breath of Jesus was on
[2:10:13] this
[2:10:15] wise this is the way it
[2:10:19] happened God memory his promise that the
[2:10:23] seed of the woman will bruise the seing
[2:10:27] head he kept his
[2:10:29] promise because that promise is tied to
[2:10:32] his Plan of
[2:10:34] Redemption praise the Lord he said the
[2:10:37] Sea of the woman it had to be a
[2:10:42] woman oh glory be to

[2:10:56] out he's an excellent God there is no
[2:11:00] one that is like unto him praise the
[2:11:03] Lord let's look at a scripture here I
[2:11:06] will hold this and maybe we
[2:11:09] close Jeremiah chapter
[2:11:15] 22 Jeremiah chapter 22 oh God is so good
[2:11:21] praise the Lord you know why I say God
[2:11:24] is so good I was struggling to find this
[2:11:26] verse you find you saw me flipping the
[2:11:28] Bible I was just praying Lord help me I
[2:11:30] need to read this thing and as soon as I
[2:11:33] I flip it I saw it I didn't keep it in
[2:11:36] my head so God is so good he knows my
[2:11:41] inability he came to my
[2:11:43] [Laughter]
[2:11:45] rescue praise the Lord let's just read
[2:11:48] this together Jeremiah chapter 22 let's
[2:11:51] look down there in verse
[2:11:56] 28 if you want to go back you want to
[2:11:58] get it you want to get a a a background
[2:12:00] to this this is jeon is is that was one
[2:12:05] that was the last
[2:12:08] king in the David
[2:12:12] lineage now you have to remember that
[2:12:15] the promise of God that the Sea of David
[2:12:19] will sit on the throne is that God's
[2:12:22] promise church is that God
[2:12:25] promise
[2:12:27] amen
[2:12:31] hallelujah that the seed of
[2:12:35] David will remain on the throne but
[2:12:38] Jonah will be one of the last king from
[2:12:42] the lineage of David
[2:12:47] physically are we together
[2:12:51] now you read here in the book of uh uh
[2:12:54] uh
[2:12:55] Jeremiah his name is called konah but
[2:12:58] when you look at the story you go back
[2:13:00] and relate the story you know that it's
[2:13:02] talking about jaon the Bible says and
[2:13:05] this
[2:13:07] man
[2:13:08] K is
[2:13:10] despised h h h u a despised broken Idol
[2:13:14] this this is this man kah a despised
[2:13:18] broken Idol is he a v vess wherein is no
[2:13:24] pleasure amen we spoke about the
[2:13:27] pleasure of the Lord prospering God find
[2:13:29] people that his pleasure can prosper in
[2:13:32] amen the the spirit of the Lord is
[2:13:34] saying this man he's a vessel where
[2:13:36] there is no pleasure because of the
[2:13:39] wickedness that he did let's go ahead a
[2:13:42] little bit you will see what I'm trying
[2:13:43] to get to here wherefore are they cast
[2:13:47] out he and his
[2:13:49] seed and I cast into the land which they
[2:13:54] know not this also is by the prophecy
[2:13:57] about going into Babylon
[2:14:00] amen oh Earth Earth Earth hear the word
[2:14:06] of the
[2:14:07] Lord praise the Lord pay attention if
[2:14:12] God speaks about you like this you
[2:14:14] better pay attention better you better
[2:14:16] you better hold to The Altar and start
[2:14:18] crying oh F hear the word thou said the
[2:14:22] Lord right here this man
[2:14:26] childless a man that shall not prosper
[2:14:30] in his
[2:14:31] days for no man of his seed shall
[2:14:34] prosper sitting upon the throne of David
[2:14:39] and ruling anymore in
[2:14:42] Judea now this is what I want to get to
[2:14:44] you you can write that down you can I
[2:14:46] mean you must highlight it in your Bible
[2:14:48] because it's very very important
[2:14:51] this is where I want to get to you this
[2:14:54] is the seed of David and God is saying
[2:14:57] that this man will not have a son to sit
[2:15:02] on the throne of David how is David
[2:15:06] lineage going to
[2:15:12] go how is the lineage of David going to
[2:15:15] continue when the when the when the when
[2:15:17] the Lord already told David that there
[2:15:20] will always be a
[2:15:22] man that will sit on the
[2:15:26] throne and this is the last lineage of
[2:15:29] David and the a curse is coming on him
[2:15:32] that he's going to be childless he will
[2:15:35] not have no
[2:15:38] son so how will the Sea of David
[2:15:41] continue to the
[2:15:43] Millennium do you see the importance of
[2:15:45] the Virgin
[2:15:48] birth when the natural lineage has
[2:15:53] filed when the natural lineage has been
[2:15:58] cursed God through a supernatural birth
[2:16:03] bring for a son that is Lan to the
[2:16:07] lineage of David through Joseph and
[2:16:11] through
[2:16:12] [Laughter]
[2:16:14] Mary praise the Lord when the natural
[2:16:18] lineage has failed
[2:16:21] God is saying he will not have a son
[2:16:25] there will not be a seed after him to
[2:16:28] inherit the
[2:16:29] throne how would D David lineage
[2:16:34] continue God has condemned this man you
[2:16:38] see God there is a place where God come
[2:16:41] he comes to the end of your fleshly
[2:16:46] limit there's a place where God comes to
[2:16:49] and he comes to the the end of all the
[2:16:53] things that run through your
[2:16:55] blood and when the seed of God through
[2:16:58] the birth and the baptism of the Holy
[2:17:00] Ghost when that thing take
[2:17:03] over praise the Lord all our lineage our
[2:17:08] our our our our family spirit and family
[2:17:11] mind we bring everything subject to the
[2:17:14] word of
[2:17:15] God because everything go back to the
[2:17:18] curse
[2:17:21] praise the
[2:17:22] Lord that natural that natural birth
[2:17:26] line was a
[2:17:28] curse praise the Lord because everything

[2:17:34] of Eden every man born of a woman is
[2:17:37] born in sin shap in
[2:17:39] iniquity how could God raise up a seed
[2:17:41] for the
[2:17:44] melian the birth of Jesus was on this
[2:17:48] wise for God to get get a seed of David
[2:17:53] he must find a virgin that is not
[2:17:56] connected to the birth of
[2:18:00] curse he must provide his own seed
[2:18:03] because he promised in Genesis that the
[2:18:05] seed of the
[2:18:07] woman I will give the woman a seed and
[2:18:11] she he will bruise the sepin
[2:18:18] head praise the Lord
[2:18:21] you see the importance of the Virgin
[2:18:24] birth not the Virgin Mary I'm not
[2:18:27] talking about the importance of the
[2:18:28] Virgin Mary I'm talking about the
[2:18:30] importance of the Virgin
[2:18:34] birth glory be to God Amen Mary herself
[2:18:39] understood
[2:18:41] it she understood it glory be to God she
[2:18:46] honors to it at the wedding of Cana she

[2:19:00] to do you do
[2:19:02] it praise the Lord she honors to it she
[2:19:07] found her way to the upper room to
[2:19:10] receive the Holy
[2:19:12] Ghost because she knew she did not have
[2:19:15] no fleshly attachment to that child
[2:19:24] praise the Lord the Virgin birth the
[2:19:27] birth of the
[2:19:29] word
[2:19:32] comes when all our Earthly lineage has
[2:19:38] fail because there is no I don't care
[2:19:41] what family you born in
[2:19:45] amen father preacher you know mother
[2:19:48] prophetes what whatever family you born
[2:19:50] in
[2:19:52] we all born in sin ship in
[2:19:56] iniquity if God will bring forth his
[2:19:58] life in US is not something we inherit
[2:20:02] from our
[2:20:03] parents my grandfather was a preacher
[2:20:06] yeah he was a
[2:20:07] preacher God bless his ministry God he
[2:20:10] did not pass it on through his his his
[2:20:12] natural
[2:20:13] gen
[2:20:16] no when God bring forth his children he
[2:20:19] bring forth his children
[2:20:21] he meets you and he gave you a personal
[2:20:24] experience it does not travel through
[2:20:26] your your family
[2:20:31] line say we see in David
[2:20:35] line the word of the Lord yeah oh Earth
[2:20:39] this is very important God saying Earth
[2:20:42] inhabitants of the earth
[2:20:44] listen I have cursed this
[2:20:48] line there is no seed from from this
[2:20:51] line will sit on my promised
[2:20:58] Throne so if there was not a virgin
[2:21:02] birth we will not have a
[2:21:05] maiah the king the The Throne of David
[2:21:08] will never continue in the
[2:21:10] Millennium because God has cursed that
[2:21:13] natural bloodline
[2:21:23] and that's what the Holy Ghost brings to
[2:21:26] the
[2:21:27] believer glory be to God when the Holy
[2:21:30] Ghost comes it comes to destroy the
[2:21:33] curse of your natural
[2:21:36] bloodline it comes to lift that curse
[2:21:38] from honor you praise the Lord it comes
[2:21:42] to break that
[2:21:45] curse you find Christians that uh uh uh
[2:21:50] have all of these all of these funny
[2:21:52] funny thoughts and funny uh uh things
[2:21:55] you know uh uh uh you know in that in
[2:21:59] their house uh you know there used to be
[2:22:01] this thing used to happen there so since
[2:22:03] I went there and my whole life is
[2:22:10] uh that the life of God in you that you
[2:22:15] a son and the daughter of God when God
[2:22:18] spoke to his first son his first
[2:22:20] children he said have
[2:22:22] dominion that's why he told him amen
[2:22:27] praise the Lord if you are not having
[2:22:29] Dominion is because your birth has not
[2:22:31] come yet if you are stay
[2:22:34] afraid you know that is the wichcraft
[2:22:37] then that my mother that my your birth
[2:22:39] has not come you are stayed tied to that
[2:22:41] natural birth line that's the reason why
[2:22:44] the curse is haunting you because when
[2:22:47] the Holy Ghost come it CAU you from that
[2:22:49] curse
[2:22:52] the word of God says you are a new
[2:22:54] creature in Christ Jesus all things are
[2:22:58] pass away and behold all things are
[2:23:09] new I don't know what I've done maybe is
[2:23:12] my family people maybe your family
[2:23:14] you're not the thing that you're doing
[2:23:16] that you don't know is that you're not
[2:23:18] taking your walk with God
[2:23:23] serious praise the Lord you are not
[2:23:26] having relationship with the god you
[2:23:29] claim to
[2:23:30] worship that's the reason why fear is
[2:23:32] haunting
[2:23:33] you praise the
[2:23:35] Lord
[2:23:39] hallelujah we could open another
[2:23:42] chapter but the Lord has been good to us
[2:23:46] you love the Lord let's give the Lord a
[2:23:49] hand of praise
[2:23:54] [Applause]
[2:23:58] hallelujah what a wonderful
[2:24:02] Jesus that's what God will do for us
[2:24:05] that's the reason why he's bringing a
[2:24:07] new
[2:24:08] generation a people that are birthed by
[2:24:11] the spoken word praise the
[2:24:14] Lord that's why we gravitate our life to
[2:24:17] what the word have said
[2:24:23] just like Mary be it unto me according
[2:24:25] to your word I don't understand how this
[2:24:27] will happen but I believe it praise the
[2:24:30] Lord I believe it why because the
[2:24:34] presence of the Angel arrested
[2:24:37] her and he says the Holy Ghost will
[2:24:40] overshadow you for the believer the Holy
[2:24:44] Ghost will condition you when God is
[2:24:47] taking you through things he's using
[2:24:49] those things to condition you so his
[2:24:52] word can come to pass in your life you
[2:24:55] are not the one that have the steering
[2:24:57] wheel let me tell you you better sit
[2:24:58] back and enjoy the
[2:25:00] ride you don't have the steering wheel
[2:25:04] praise the Lord before Tesla came up
[2:25:07] with no Wheel car God already had it you
[2:25:10] have been in a car that you don't have a
[2:25:12] steering because the steering is in
[2:25:14] God's hand and then when he pull you
[2:25:17] down the path you jump through the
[2:25:18] window you will break your neck
[2:25:22] praise the Lord because this this speed
[2:25:25] limit is so fast it's an intenal speed
[2:25:28] limit is running so fast that time can't
[2:25:31] catch up with
[2:25:35] it praise the Lord people are jumping
[2:25:38] out I don't believe as soon they don't
[2:25:40] believe when they get down they they
[2:25:41] turn to
[2:25:43] homosexuals they jump out I don't
[2:25:45] believe that's what Paul
[2:25:48] said Romans chapter one he said because
[2:25:52] they are
[2:25:53] denying the visible creation of God they
[2:25:57] are enjoying God's creation and they are
[2:26:00] denying that he
[2:26:02] exists he say so God has given them over
[2:26:04] to reprobate
[2:26:10] Spirit the Lord bless you musicians you
[2:26:12] can count
[2:26:17] [Applause]
