you that song the last time okay okay [Music] well let's let's take our Bibles then and read in Hebrew chapter 6. Hebrew chapter six thank you musicians amen I know you're saying to yourself what um your life will never be the same Hebrew chapter 6. now the service this morning we're going to trust the grace of God and uh I was really okay mm-hmm well they are not getting my notes back there so I think yeah is is uh is is is my poor technology skills foreign but let's go to Hebrew chapter six let's go to Hebrew chapter six uh [Music] Hebrew chapter six we'll read from verse 13. we'll read from verse 13. if it's not coming true it's okay sister Faith I don't I just have one one major quote to reading it is mostly concerning the community service tonight I was going to read that from the beginning of the service this morning and then just go into dive into what I want to talk about let's read from verse 13 in Hebrew chapter 6. Hebrew chapter 6 verse 13 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he attended the promise for men very less words by the greater and an old for confirmation is to them and end of all strife praise the Lord he will not imagine how many hours I stay on this scripture yesterday because there is there is just just yeah yeah let me let me read and have you just sit there and I will tell you my story where in God willing more abundantly to show on to the hearers of promise their immutability of his counsel confirm it by an ought thereby two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both show and stay fast what an anchor show and stay fast and which enter it into that within the Veil whether the Forerunner is for US enter even Jesus made on high priest forever after the other of Melchizedek praise the Lord let's pray together Heavenly Father please Lord we need your help this morning God if you we need your help Lord and that your name will be lifted up among your people oh god father we pray that you will bless the service now Lord bless the effort the prayers the sacrifice of your children this morning we just commit all things in your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seeds praise the Lord I I thought I struggle to even give the the the message a title so I have a promise confirmed by an art that is really not what I wanted to need to title my sermon but I just have to find something to put there and the reason is that let me give you a little picture of of where my my strugle was yesterday you know for a long time I have I have I have uh I've ponder over this in my mind for many years that God swerved by himself amen and in in as much as is uh is a beautiful thing it's a very interesting subject mahima mind has always struggled why do God have to swear back in Leviticus chapter 19 verse 12 God says thou shall not swear thou shall not sword using the name of the Lord praise the Lord and every time that a man will have to swear and that that that the thing there is that the whole thing behind this whole sweating thing is is because of Lies amen I heard somebody say something during the week and I I kept telling myself a repeating it so it would just stick in my mind because that was just a good line that says if you tell the truth you will not need a good memory yeah amen right if you always tell the truth you don't have to worry about a good memory praise the Lord amen and when I heard that I kept repeating I said wow that's I love that let me let me let me say it again tell yourself a better one if you tell the truth you won't have to bother about a good memory so so that's that is the whole thing that makes me kept thinking about this and it's been this I've been many years and the truth about the matter that is that I've never I don't remember one time I even preached on the message uh on this context of God swearing by himself is because I've I've been trying to to to set it up I mean even this entire week I went through all the messages uh uh magazette the great Prince the entire Hebrew series and uh Wilbert Brandon will talk about God you know swearing by himself and and then a lot of course too and and just trying to you know just to see what what is the mind of God in there what is there I know that God did that to be able to confirm his promise to Abraham praise the Lord he did it to confirm his promise but he's God he don't need to do that amen but you see how much that God will stoop to our level praise the Lord yet to do us a favor to do us a favor he was stoop down to our level sometimes God will will you know will we have to even identify himself you know in in our shame you have to identify himself in some of our embarrassment just to be able to tell you that I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord that's the greatness of God God greatness is not that he can bless the entire word and make a new word the greatness of God that in his greatness and his Holiness he can stay stoop down to our level amen praise the Lord amen that's the reason why the Way Up Is Down that's God greatness if we can only see his greatness in the Sun the moon and the stars and the work that he created and don't see his greatness in becoming a man to take our sin upon his shoulder then you don't know the greatness of God praise the Lord amen because whenever a man have a little sense of greatness he never comes down he never comes down now you know he's uh you want to you want to have a big status this evening we will have a convenience service and I choose to read this and and like I was saying that's I think that's that's just the only thing that I have here because I want to go in this in this direction and uh this is from communion see there's their reason that's the reason I'm saying that you understand what you are doing if if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where what you are doing you you can have enough confidence if you don't know what you are doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you are doing it now I I've copied these quotes uh I think before like before I travel so while we were having one of the services there uh uh uh uh brother Daly was preaching to the church and and uh he was he was speaking on something and then he he said he said do you know that we take an ought when we when we the communion is a symbol of an ought okay I'm not I'm not saying the right words but that was that was what I grabbed and and I and I wrote it down you know I wrote it on my notebook and when he said that my mind referred to what I'm reading and surprisingly he quoted what I'm reading he just he just paraphrased it so it then it got my mind you know this particular subject got my mind how the the the communion is a symbol of an odd now listen to brother Branham yeah he says they are now in in other words don't just come don't just come to take it there's a communion he says as I said a while ago about what the Jews their sacrifice it was wonderful it was given by God but it got to a place where they didn't they didn't do it sincerely and reverently and in order then it became a stinged in his nose that he referenced in the book of Isaiah amen where the scripture says every table has become a vomit now the same thing is by our coming to take the Lord's Supper that we must come knowing what we are doing now I purposely in my heart prayed about this and thought that I would use this and talk to us as a church a little bit I love uh uh uh the communion just like every ordinance in the Bible and just like I said before the communion has a spiritual significance for a church we spoke on the shout of the king that is in a camp and we talked about the supernatural element that gathered Israel praise the Lord and before the people will start to experience that Supernatural element God brought them into a covenant he brought them into an oath by taking the communion the Lord's Supper they were to they were to have the Passover that night with the blood on the door of the lane tail the very animal that they were they were going to partake and eat all with bitter herbs was the same animal blood they had to put on the doorpost praise the Lord and and that brought them into they could not understand you know roasting this meat eating it with with bitter herbs and all of that but it brought them it introduced them into a spiritual atmosphere he introduced them to the blessing of these Supernatural things there was there was that was around them the pillow of fire the brazing serpent the smithing rock and all of that now so uh uh uh the communion is is is just as much because by water baptism we we come forth and we confess by identifying ourselves with with the Lord Jesus Christ we identify with his death with his barrier and his resurrection when we are put down into the water and we are raising up to newness of Life praise the Lord and then uh uh in their way we have now become member of the mystical body of Jesus Christ praise the Lord like Peter said water do not signify uh uh putting away the faith of the flesh but it shows a good conscience towards God praise the Lord that's where the joining begins with a good conscience towards God it brings you the fear of God and all of that and then you walk in by faith now so uh when you when we come to this thing and and we approach the communion table by faith with reverence and respect now if we are not living up to what God expect us we have no right taking the communion because we will just be uh we will just be creating problems for ourselves now now uh by coming to the table we must come knowing what we are doing just like when we go into the water to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know what you are doing you are identifying yourself with the death the barrier and the resurrection of Jesus Christ you must now be baptized to join the church amen you must not be baptized just I mean just to be you must know they are by faith I have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior I believe that he died for my sin that's the reason why I want to identify myself with his death with his resurrection amen praise the Lord so we must know what we are doing and and and and that is the way that parents we must teach our children you know when they bring a baptism uh conversation to us uh know what you are doing you are putting on to the church what God has put in you Christ amen he says uh when when when we take this which is the law support a show to the church that I believe every word of God amen I believe that he is the bread of life that comes from heaven or that comes from God out of Heaven I believe every word that he said is the truth I live by it to the best of my knowledge now when you when we walk to the communion table that's what you are saying that's the witness that you have in your heart to the best of my knowledge praise the Lord amen amen well if I did something to you and uh and and I'm not aware of it if you don't come to tell me uh and you said I mean look look at him that he's going to the community with that that's your problem amen that's your problem and that is the reason why I believe that uh night before the communion or the morning before the communion family should be able to sit down together amen we must be able to try some other things you know that is that it's among us we must learn to say oh I'm sorry that I did this to you I'm very sorry that I did this to you you know the mommy you hurt my feelings you shouldn't have said that to me oh I'm sorry you shouldn't have done this I mean we should be we should be able to have that heart to do it that's the right attitude if a brother is not happy with his wife on something he must be able to tell her well I didn't like you did this you know this there that we we have a communion before us tonight you know I don't know why I was keeping this thing but uh you know I just uh if if there is anything that we can remember we must trash you out because it's for your own good man if there is a brother or a sister you know in the assembly that maybe they said something and uh uh I mean uh they were not paying attention and and you you never felt good about it or you heard it from somebody go and meet the person right right it's not this person said this about me this other person said this about me praise the Lord because you see when the church is is is is is clean in that attitude in the sense that if we have the the attitude to be able to reconcile ourselves with one another and be opening to talk to one another sorry brother I did this to you I'm very sorry I did this to you and and now what we are doing is that we are bringing the Lord on our defense praise the Lord when Paul says who can hold anything against God's elect is why because everything is under the blood praise the Lord because everything is under the blood that's the reason why no man can hold nothing against God skillet amen Israel they have problems for the fact that they could get down to bahapura and and and their lost Spirit could just overtake them they start running around with mobile I.T girls and all of that it means that a lot loss was always in their heart right praise the Lord but you see uh uh uh God cover the back part of his people could not see anything and he broke into prophecy I cannot see no iniquity in Jacob praise the Lord David said the same thing blessed is the man in whom the Lord will not impute iniquity why is that man that have come under the atonement of Christ's blood neither one that is walking in his own self-righteousness is the man that have found the courage to make his way right by the word of God no very bad are we together you see the reason why I love the communion is because it helped me to protect myself amen it helped me to protect myself and to protect the church because I mean the Lord has not blessed me with a gift of vision he have not blessed me with uh uh you know a higher level of discernment I have some level but not higher to know you know to start telling you you did this is where you went I don't have that praise the Lord but if if I can bring the the the the Covenant the audience of God Among the people amen and challenge you to be sincere and challenge myself to be sincere praise the Lord amen am I telling you my secret that's why I like it because to me it's a protection praise the Lord if you are not sincere that one is up to you and God I tell the Lord I go in that office I say Lord I've done the best that I know how to do take it from here and deal with the hearts of your people praise the Lord it's not when that I mean we we uh uh you know uh fussing and fighting carrying this and carrying that and then you know uh then immediately we come to church everybody become an angel no we will still have things that we differ from one another that we struggle with but we must have the heart to apologize praise the Lord there was something that kind of first uh struck me yesterday as I was as I was looking into into the word and uh it just it just it just took my entire day because I it just blew my mind and I just couldn't get over it praise the Lord amen the word sword I was looking at that in the Hebrew it means for you to say something seven times meaning that you are saying it seven times meaning that what I'm saying is the truth then there was just a whole lot of things that Jesus came together in my mind why Jesus will say forgive your brother Seventy Times Seven and there was just a whole lot of seven things that were just all coming to my mind but let's go ahead right here oh I believe that Jesus is the bread of life that comes from God out of Heaven I believe every word that he says is the truth if there is something that we are preaching here that you are struggling with is better you say it say well you know you know I really want to understand that I always struggle when you preach this I always struggle when you say this praise the Lord because as as far as I know there is nobody that is head on a gun point to believe what is being preached here amen so I believe every word is to be truth and I live to eat to the best of my knowledge God being my judge now when you see that it's it's almost as a sense that you are you are getting into an odd you are saying to the best of my knowledge so help me God that's that's why you say in the court amen that you put your hand upon the Bible you say so help me God praise the Lord so that's exactly what you do when you take that bread that's exactly what you are doing you say so help me God I believe every word I believe your promise Amen to the best of my knowledge Lord and the faith that you have given me I'm doing my best to live for you amen praise the Lord you know where I need you the most Hallelujah therefore before my brothers before my sister I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it and they mean record therefore before you I take this password of bread this parcel of his body to know that I am not condemned with the word see there you are then it's a blessing he says when you do it that way it's a blessing praise the Lord amen if you are just doing it to be counted in the number you have to reconsider what you are doing he says and remember I could give many testimony on this where I have took that and explain it in a sick room and see them heal praise the lord it's a better brand I'm taking communion to a believer that is sick and and explaining it identifying yourself with the sacrifice he says and see them taking it and getting well remember when Israel when Israel taking the type of this they're joining 40 years in the wilderness and they are close never even wore out what was that the blessing of the communion amen the Lord knows our needs so the blessing of the communion provide for us even though we don't have money to be able to shop in and change our wardrobe every month but yet the grace of God make us to dress decent and people don't even know the difference that we're just swapping paints and shirts what is that is the blessing of the communion are we together Ezra took that in a typing in the wilderness 40 years with our one feeble one among them two million people in this type well what would the anti-type do if the body of a sacrificial animal they there for them what will the body of Jesus Christ do praise the Lord what would the body of Jesus Emmanuel do for us let just be revering when we come let us be just as reverent as we know how when we come praise the Lord so I invite you this afternoon if you have time uh I think we will be sitting back for 4 30. 430 will be seated back 4 30 and then we go right into the community service this evening so we have read the scripture and I want to I want to go into my subject tonight what I want to look at here is uh I want to I want to look at uh the difference between uh [Music] swearing and swearing with an oat now so I keep giving you update on my on my travel since I can bring it in one in one I'm not you know I'm not very good in making reports I gave it bit in pieces you know I'm not very good in there there are people that are very good they can you know just put everything down and give you a clear picture they can even make you travel with them with me I get you lost amen I leave you on the road somewhere praise the Lord so we have in these meetings for brother Elijah brother Daley preached the first night Monday night uh I mean he read he really brought a blessing to his church but it was it was tight because they had a Sunday service and then went into a three days Monday Tuesday Wednesday uh Revival meetings brother Daly had to leave on Mondays uh on on Tuesday so he had to preach Monday night and then uh preach on Tuesday and then brother Simon Peter there in uh New York Connecticut New Yorker he preached on uh on Wednesday so I was not there I went over to uh to the other Church to preach and uh and then when we came home we started talking you know he was sharing with me what he preached I was sharing with him how the service go and all of that then he preached on the message uh uh God saw by himself you know now a couple of days before brother Daly have made this comment about uh you know the community as an odd and he's talking about God so he just put my my whole mind now goes back to this subject you know about God swearing so I I said I have to look into this you know I have to look into this but the subject started becoming interesting because uh uh you know uh the the difference between swearing and making and swearing with an ought every time God's word he swore with an ought amen every time he swore he swear with an oath now so that now just it just got you know it got me on the spin and I started looking into the subject and I said well okay we having a communion coming I'm thinking about uh you know talking to the church and how we how we have to uh uh rightly appreciate you know behave ourselves come in by faith and all of that so I might I might just talk on that on the Sunday morning before the community service so here I am praise the Lord I need all your help I need all your help because I was in a in a kind of a roller coaster yesterday going back and forth with just different things pranking year and day but God I was going to speak on the Redemption our Redemption god making a promise let me go simply this way to Abraham confirming to Abraham that I will give you a c Genesis 15. God confirming to Abraham Abraham have come to God to let God knows I'm getting old and here is Eliza he has been a good servant in my house he was born in my house he's you know he knows everything about this household maybe he can God say no it will have to be a son that that comes out of you so God now engaging Abraham into that he took Abraham in the field told him to take all the animals for the sacrifice so God is going to make a covenant with it with Abraham praise the Lord and not only making the coveting but almighty God is also going to soar which man in one sense God is going to hold himself accountable to his word praise the Lord amen and he swore by himself because uh uh there is no one greater than him and not only that but he also swerved with an ought like brother Brandon will explain in that he says that's the ancient way when those people they make a covenant they bow themselves and says if I don't keep this Covenant Let Me Be As Dead As this dead animal okay praise the Lord so we we know the story there in Genesis 15 if you don't know it go back and read it Abraham you know took all the sacrifice dividing them into two and uh but he did not split the thought of he just put one year one year because that represents Divine Healing so uh uh uh their God made a covenant he made a promise to Abraham and then over it he swore by himself any swear with an ought so they then I started looking into into all of that and trying to see their importance Matthew Chapter 5 when Jesus came he he repeated it to the disciple you should not swear by the heaven or by the Earth praise the Lord you must not even swear by your head because you did not make yourself Jesus said that James also said that in James 5 toward he says brother let your ye be ye be a man of your word amen thou shall not sword let your year be yet and your no no so the whole thing about swearing is because men do not keep their word amen men do not keep their word now but then if you look in the scripture here what is going to make the the the the the the subject important is that as you go down and and and you and you look into into the subject you will realize that uh uh there are many places in the Bible were like Robert Brown says in Christ is the mission of God revealed the Old Testament characters they play out things that it really did not understand take for example when Israel was going into the promised land when it got over Numbers Chapter 9. there was a group of amorites and what these amorites did word they disguise themselves they took all bread molded bread you know because everybody have heard about uh the Israelites how they are flushing the land there you know so these people they dress themselves and they came to uh to uh Joshua and told Joshua that they are givenites they are they are a group of backslid in Israel you know that wander somewhere you know and and they just they just disguise themselves that way praise the Lord and God have a law we will get we will get to that that will become very important when we get to it [Music] where he told the children of Israel that you should not make a lead yes amen don't make her leave it also means a vowed or it means an ought until you really knows what is going on praise the Lord but what we're hoping here is that uh uh Joshua and his men really never investigated these people because of the old clothes they were wearing and the more their bread and the way they make theirselves so sorry for right they went and make an agreement with them that they will not kill them pretty soon it never take no time they realize that these people were not given us they were just amorites now the thing about swearing the thing about vow is that you cannot take it back right amen you cannot take it back praise the Lord oh I hope I hope that it gets it gets interesting for you like it was for me yesterday it was just it was very it was an interesting roller coaster for me yesterday just looking into this subject it was very very interesting roller coaster let's look into Numbers Chapter 30. let's establish this into Numbers Chapter 30. if you will bear with me I'm taking you into a little bit of my own personal Bible status so just bear with me this part of the subject this part of the subject will bring us into something an understanding of hairship foreign and Moses speak until the head of the tribes concerning the children of Israel saying this is the thing which the Lord has commanded if a man vow a vow unto the Lord all swear and ought to bound his soul now that is the difference between swearing and swearing with an oat when you are swearing with an old you are bounding your soul you are tell you are saying they are the you know uh uh uh let let this happen to me amen praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together are we together can I ask the church to say Amen okay because I see you are all in your Deep Thoughts where is he going you're trying to catch me praise the Lord that's okay that's okay I will I pretty soon surrender I don't have to go far that's okay but this will bring us in a place place the other you will see there are certain vows a certain vowel that when we when we take unto the Lord let's let's even take let's even take our our vow of faith that we just talk about uh uh baptizing in Jesus name you come up and you said I believe the Lord Jesus and he died for my for my sin you know and uh uh you know and and that is the reason why you know when when the child when the church uh established all of this uh uh uh baptismal class and all of that it was never done like that in the scripture you know it had to be at a place where a person was convicted God move upon the person's heart and the person wants to take this commitment to follow Jesus to be identified with Jesus in water Baptist it has to be a conviction because what you don't know is that when you take that confession you abounding your soul and that's the reason why all hell break loose when you get yourself into that commitment the whole Kingdom of of of darkness is against you the devil don't have one good conversation about you praise the Lord amen so it's not just a church member thing it's not just a church member thing it's not just I'm believing the message you must have to know that you you you have you have put your soul on the line you have bound your soul to a promise so it is not a place for you to sit down and say oh I don't know why all of this thing happening to me that's that's why you committed yourself to they they have taken on the name of Jesus like Paul says will suffer persecution praise the Lord who suffer persecution you see that's the reason why all of these mega churches that are all into Prosperity they don't have they don't have to baptize you they don't do baptism right baptism is not something that they do they are not interested in it or they are interested in you sow seed and you will get blessed that's all they preach just motivational gospel so you to motivate you to put your hands in your pocket sell your land sell your car come and sold seeds and God will bless you get rich overnight they don't teach the principal things of faith praise the Lord now so that's one of the think one of the second thing that also there is that your marriage vow it's about where you bound your soul it's not a six-month contract the marriage covenant says till death do us part amen amen and brother Brahm says they even continue after death to the Believers they continue after death so it's one of these things when a man vow a vowel or swear an ought to bound his soul with abound he shall not break his word he shall do I call into all that proceeded out of his mouth that's the reason why he must sit down and count the cost ask himself you know what he's going into Jesus says I mean before you get into a wall you must count the cost ask yourself what are you getting into now so you see it was a palm base that Joshua could not take his word back he have already got into a covenant with his people that they are going to be there to serve Israel to be to be uh drawing water and breaking rules there will be sevens to them praise the Lord amen yeah that's that's what happened like God gave us a little blessing then we start looking for servants amen they have just come through the Wilderness they broke their own wood they found their own food now they have entered into their promise they want servants and they have got themselves into a league that they cannot take their word back praise the Lord it would get very interesting as we go on I'll keep you in the in in in the volume of the book today it will get very interesting as we go on but let's deal with this number chapter 13 because on as we go you will realize saw trying to gain the favor of the people he went and killed these gibber Knights and God plagued Israel for it but let's go ahead here let's let's look at this let's look at a little a little understanding of hardship right here in Numbers Chapter 30. in the volume of the book that's where we are today verse 3 if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bound herself by abound being in her father's house now a principle of Hershey that's a principle of hership they are being on a hair ship she's not tied to eval without consorting the history praise the Lord we are in a societal world you know uh many many parents found out their children are married on Facebook praise the Lord as I just say it like that but uh uh if it bring us to the place where and you if you realize instead of the message you will see the other uh the the only case of anointment where brother Branham dealt with they had to be with his own son this was where brother Branham there with thy kids because the young woman was still on the edge uh in her father's house and both of them ran to the court of law to get married and are so uh by the word of God she will stay on a hair shape she needed her dare to consent are we together and that is the place that makes the position of the father important in marriage I know it is quiet but I'm still preaching amen is a very important in marriage your father will not choose who you should marry to but he must be involved the parents must be involved his hair shape is a is a very serious principle when Paul in the book of Ephesians said the head of every man is Christ the head uh the man is the head of the woman and uh and and and on and on uh uh uh there's it's it's a very very important thing are we together now you will see that's the reason why we can now swear by God in heaven why because we are finished and God is infinite if you are taking a promise that's why God will not you won't join himself to our sword he said don't swear by me your mind is limited if you want to take yourself into a prop a covenant your mind is limited I see beyond time and spaces I know what is going to happen tomorrow [Music] so don't don't bring me into your think are we together now so we go ahead and and then we see here uh verse 3. and her father heard her vow the father heard about it and and Obama wear with she her bound her soul if the father heard about it which means she never told her father amen and her father shall hold his peace at her then all uh if he hold his peace then all her vows shall stand and and every bound where where she abound her soul shall stand but if the father disallows her in the dead dead he Gareth it praise the Lord not any of the vow or the bound where where she abound her soul shastin and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallow it this allow her amen and if she had at all and husband now she's not under the headship of her father anymore she's now under the headship of her husband now it brings poor place in perspective if a woman have a question let her ask her husband is is that place of hership God instituted it are we together so if uh if uh if she had if she had at all and husband when she vowed or or out of her lip where if she bound her soul and her husband heard it and and he had his peace at her didn't say anything then her vow shall stand and uh and uh uh her bound where wave she bound her soul shall stand but if the if the husband disallow it on the dead that he hear it it's not on the dead word he's not happy with the guy he yeah about it he never did anything until the person they said no I don't agree the day that you hear about it is the day that you have to deal with it right praise the Lord it's the day that you have to call call the young man and says what am I hearing what is this praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the principle I'm kind of for emphasizing this because I have a lot of young people that will go into marriage and are planning to go into marriage and I've always encouraged the importance of the parents praise the Lord amen this is this is this is the scriptural basis where it is very very important you know to sit down with your your with your father and let him know well you know this this is the person that that is making friend with me and and all of that you know uh uh don't just uh uh you know get in love and fall in love when you fall it's hard to get up we want you being in love and standing up were your eyes open are we together praise the Lord you can fall after you get married because you already take the confidence so you can fall he will pick you up then praise the Lord but yeah I just I just thought that I should bring bring this part of it because when I was when I was studying on that and then uh you know I was looking through my reference and then it pointed out Numbers Chapter 30 why God the the uh you know Joshua could not take his word back because it was a commandment of God he has already vowed he has bound him so that you will never kill these people yeah yeah so no matter what the day they just have to bear with them when the elders found out that they were not given knives they were they were amorites they came to to Joshua he says we have already saw we I mean we have we have given we have created a league with them we have promised them that we will not kill them and these were the very same people according to the Book of Judges chapter one that started becoming torn in their flesh right yeah that's the danger of compromise are we together now so we go back we go back I just I I felt it necessary to go over this principle with you and uh so you can be able to to see it you can take the time and and and read it praise the Lord just like I said to you I mean a man that is dealing with that have to deal with that right there and then first Samuel chapter 24. people they will there were no no of things or heard of things that they know that is not right sorry sorry wrong wrong scripture second Samuel 21. second Samuel 21 we stay in the volume of the book today second Samuel 21 then there was a farming in the days of David three years year after year and David inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered it is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonite and the king called the given nation and said unto them now they given us well not all the children of Israel but of the women of the amorites and the children of Israel have sown unto them and saw sought to slay them in his Zeal to the children of Israel and Judah so you see he came to power and and now he's saying I'm going to push the land of these people there is no record of these people among us I'm going to push now what he was trying to do is that he was trying to impress impress the turn of Israel to show us like yeah that's why we needed a king get rid of them praise the Lord we must not do things to impress the church praise the Lord amen Hallelujah I mean we might not do things to impress the church I mean to impress you that you know I'm I'm um I don't know what to say but what we have to do is to stay with the word now so yeah now they had this problem they have farming year after year year after year there was a curse in the land because he have slayed the blood of a people that have come on a covenant praise the Lord they have come on a covenant so now the uh David called these people and David asked of them what they needed they asked for seven sons out of the house of David let's let's read a little bit it's going to turn very interesting well for David said unto the gibber night what shall I do for you and where we shall I make an atonement that yeah May bless the inheritance of the Lord praise the Lord Hallelujah you cannot say because you are a Christian or because you are a Believer you know it gave you right to to cheat or mistreat an unbeliever no he's on a covenant he's a creature of God amen he deserved the same respect like everybody deserves now so Yara said now David is asking these people we have to make an atonement here so you can bless us that this curse will leave from the land and the given I said unto him we will have no Savor known uh non-go of Saul none of his house neither for us shall thou kill any man in Israel and he said watch what year shall say that I will do for you and the answer the king the man that consumed us what is going to happen here is the other they are going to ask for seven sons seven sons of Saul praise the Lord they are going to ask for seven sons of Silver Six let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us that we will hang them unto the Lord in ghibia of Sword womb the Lord they choose and the King said I will give them but the King still okay that's journey to a son now a create another room here why did the king spell him because David has come into a covenant he has made an art with Jonathan [Music] that's true oh my God so the house of Jonathan was to be protected by David will get to that but David also swear on to Saul but you see David swore unto Saul was now on the alt right right when David Cook saw garment Saul said my son swear unto me in this day but it was now on the alt right so a sword that is not on our old after time can be breaking yes praise the Lord I swear that is now on our old after time can be breaking you have to realize feeling house was of the house of levite and God give him a promise God gave him an everlasting promise they are the the the priesthood will be in the house of phoenixas but that was now on Earth are we together so uh are we together praise the Lord let's let's look into first Samuel chapter 20. verse 17. like I told you we're in the volume of the books today amen we are in the value of the book [Music] I hope I'll find a place here to close and first Samuel chapter 20 first Samuel chapter 20 now David has suspected that saw there was a problem that Saul was Haunting his life not to take motion of the reading year so David and jonington went to the field and David told Journey turn and says I'm I'm suspecting that your dad want to kill me Jonathan said why would he do that he said well I've noticed yes I've noticed that I've noticed that while they were going to have a feast and David was supposed to be part of that Feast because David was in the house of Saul now but what will happen here is that David sent saw and I mean Journey turn and say go take my suspicion and then if you notice it is truth shoot a board of Arrow amen when I see it then I'm I'm going to go far but let's let's read this first uh uh uh verse verse 17. verse 17. now you you can go back and read the the whole thing verse 16. so journey to me a covenant with the House of David saying let the Lord even require at the hand of David's enemy amen and Jourdanton calls David to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul how they call it in our dead soulmates okay so they they they have burned themselves into a covenant with an old praise the Lord so with this that's the reason why uh uh uh David because if you go back and read that scripture of the seven sons of David uh uh of Saul that was killed were the sons from his children amen the men that were born in the House of David um was also a son of Journey turn in the House of David but because of that Covenant because David and saw no David and Jonathan had a covenant word they bound their soul together if you go back and read the first time that they even met the Bible says they are so knock one after another praise the Lord amen now why why is this important why is this important because we as humans as as uh as our age change that is the same way we change sometimes in our attitude but when when brother Brandon made this statement over and over that God is obligated to his word what makes him God is because he keep his word right praise the Lord if God says in his word that he that believeth in me shall be saved God means what he says praise the Lord he's asking nothing more than for us to put all our faith and trust in him praise the Lord hallelujah or with the with the events of time and things that is happening around us and things that is happening in in around the message and all of that we we uh uh people get to worry about uh you know the Rapture and the bride you you are not the one that promised God a Rapture you didn't promise God you are glory in a Rapture is God that promised you that he's taking you in a rapture yeah praise the Lord Amen Let the I mean let let let let let the falling away comes there are as many as many that will fall away praise the Lord do you realize that even the rapture the promise of the Rapture do you realize that it's a reward do you realize that it's a reward that even the great Apostle Paul that talks about the rapture he was now rewarded to be caught up in a moment in a twinkling of an eye praise the Lord even the prophet that brought us the mystery of the revive of the rapture how the Rapture is in sequence there is a shout which is the message that comes to gather the people amen there is the voice of the archanger there is the of God which of course he make us to know those three things when Christ was descending those three things has been fulfilled we are in a circle even the one that brought us the mystery the understanding of the Rapture he was not rewarded with it then you think about it think about it think about it that when when when uh when Abraham was sending Eliza to go and get Rebecca oh my goodness I could just get into that man no I leave it praise the Lord oh I will leave it but when Abraham was sending me back I mean Eliza to go and get Rebecca I believe that he talked the best their best off the best of his Campbell amen that little truck that re Rebecca would sit down in and load all her things in it was made brand new it was a brand new one praise the Lord Hallelujah the same way you go we go and rent vehicles that we don't own for our wedding why because the wife is special amen praise the Lord let me leave that part of it let me go right ahead so the rapture it's a reward for a special group of people not not just for the church goal not just for the person that says I believe the message and Kiel and and care less about the Life of Christ or the reproach of Christ do you see why sometimes brother Barrymore says it would just be one from here one from there right he said with with things going on you look through the scripture how God have just taken a small group of people why because it's a a reward for a christ-like character praise the Lord glory be to God so you see that we have we have all of these things you know that uh that uh that are around here I share with you uh uh David and journey turn and then it's in first Samuel chapter 24 uh verse 21 that was word uh saw requested to David that he must swear unto him you know that uh he will be good onto his house they will also swear but it was it was not with an ought the importance here I was I was the emphasis that was coming to me it is that uh to us to us as human the the the value the value of of of making an odd like the scripture says his the Bible Paul says to men when you make an ALT it's the end of strife amen if you make a promise and and and and and put your life to it now you can you can you can talk everything and and says I will pay for this thing and there's a but when you take your character today praise the Lord you take your cartology and you put it down and says if I don't pay for it my yes yes maternity or you take your lady that's the end of strife that's how an odd is if you are just talking with your mouth it's just mouth talk they just mouth talk you know me you're my life I can promise you I will never just mouth talk to D down pour the title down the banquet gladly hold it for you foreign of strife is the end of strife I've been to this meeting I went to that river that just muffed talk but let the talking be applied let the blood Let The Life of Christ come on this place it's the end of strife praise the Lord Hallelujah is the end of strife the man make an ought so God when he was promising Abraham that he would have a seat he make an old the next time God will make an all to Abraham or the next time on Earth will be made it was when Abraham Genesis 24 when he was sending Eliza now so you see all the promises that are tied to Redemption God attached an ought to it he said he said Eliza take me by the time and promise me you're not going to make a shortcut yet amen those uh those days are you know that part of a man was the sacrifice of his body not this day where they are all all uh inbox are all on the street that was a sacred part of a man's body to tell him take me by the tide and promise me you will not take a woman out of the calendar but you go right home so la Iza has to bind himself that's the reason why it was important that's the reason why he stopped by the word and said Lord God [Music] because he knows he was honor and ought Abraham says unless the woman refused to come then you are released from the heart but just don't don't don't don't don't uh just want to satisfy me you go and pick up anybody no no no no no no no no so Ellie is a new the seriousness of what bound himself into praise the Lord that's why when Jesus on his way when he was saying Lord not my world in the Garden of Gethsemane but let your will be done he knew the seriousness he knew the seriousness for this purpose that he was born if we would just know the seriousness of what our being here this morning is not just plain religion it's not just making church member but this is a serious business God needing people that will live for the name of Jesus Christ that he would have his preeminence in praise the Lord the first uh a god of his purpose to manifest himself he did it the second one to find a body he found a man one man Christ Jesus but this time now is to find a people where he will have the preeminence people that will put God first that's why the Holy Ghost is Hungary forth that's why the Holy Ghost is slavery for people that will put God first and why can we realize that God wants us to put him first so he can bless us why can't we realize that amen when he even said try me try me if I will not open the windows of heaven so God is not doing it to punish you or to rob you of anything he wants to make you a peculiar people he wants to make you peculiar put me first I will make you peculiar brother man says show me a man that will pull God forever I will show you the man that is blessed in everything that he lays his hands on to do yeah yeah praise the Lord it is for our own good but our human nature struggle with that we struggle with faith that is that that is the slave nature in US we struggle with it praise the Lord I feel like I'm preaching to myself this morning amen don't feel bad it's not like I'm having resentment for you but there's a whole lot of a thing that I need glory be to God when God swore with an oath everything they have to do with Redemption everything God attached himself to it every promise if you if you if if you if you if you believe God's word and and uh and uh believe that he is able then take God at his word there is nothing too high for the Lord [Music] there is nothing too hard because even the least thing that concern us matter to him the most the least things that concern us matter to him the most but we we we we we make those things to overwhelm us how would I do it how would I get it done oh my oh my my life oh yeah and pretty soon we are so worked out that we have no time to live for our hairs up onto the Hills we're coming I will help glory be to God Revelation chapter 10 let's close with that Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chapter 10 when you read the book of Revelation it's just like the strong you will see here in verse 1 and I saw the mighty angel now that word end is is a conjunction a continuation of the statement from chapter nine and I saw the mighty Angel come down from heaven glow with with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was as it were the sun his feet as a pillow of fire now we get a second conjunction again and he had in his hands a little book and he said his right foot upon the seed in his left foot upon the Earth and then another conjunction again and and cry with a loud voice as when a lion Rolex and when he had cried seven Thunder altered their voices then another conjunction again and the seven Thunder and when the seventh Turner had altered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto mean seal of those those things which the seventh Turner altered and write them that another conjunction again and the angel which as I I saw stand upon the seed and upon the Earth lifted up His Hands to Heaven another conjunction again and swear praise the Lord now let me let me narrow this down God giving Abraham a promise of his seed which is tied to the promise of Genesis 3 15 the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent praise the Lord so in that promise that's that's the promise of redemption so in the in the in the alpha the first promise of redemption God swear by himself that I will do this I will raise up a people for my name by you through you Abraham amen now here we're seeing in Revelation chapter 10 at the closing of the book the same God that made Abraham and give him a promise it's coming down again in a form of Almighty injure praise the Lord amen hallelujah with one foot on the land and another foot on the sea and he's raising his hand again and he's swearing it's in a sense to say everything that I have promised everything that I've kept in the back part of my mind everything that I said I would do I have done it praise the Lord amen oh my God oh mine and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created God could not swear by anyone greater he swear by himself this Mighty injure is also swearing by him that liveth forever and ever the one that created the Heaven and all things that are there in here's the same one that swirl unto Abraham the same one that saw her by himself that after 400 years I will bring your people out on ego with the god did it he did it he says I would bring them back to this Lane then he brought them back to Kenya he did it then why do you think that God would promise to give you the Holy Ghost he can't give it to you amen praise the Lord why do you think that God will promise healing and he can't give it to you it's because of how much the value you have put to the promise the value that you have put to the ability of the one that have promised praise the Lord if I promise you a Jet Plane you don't believe it because I don't even have it praise the Lord why should you believe it say I believe it he's the man of God you get lying let me tell you now you believe me a lie praise the Lord amen Hallelujah glory be to God but I can promise you that I pray for you amen glory be to God I can promise you that just like Aaron where the breastplate on his heart I hold you dear to my heart and I left you before God every time I think about you and he lifts her up his hands to heaven and he swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created the heavens and the things that I did in the Earth and the things that are there in they see the things which are there in that there should be time no longer you read from verse one to verse 7. you realize that you have conjunctions of N and but then when you reach to verse 7 apprecially it changes but praise the Lord amen oh glory be to God hallelujah am I making you to sleep Hallelujah but in the days of the voice of the seven angels in the days of the voice of the seven angel the one that swore by Heaven and Earth is telling us that in the day of the voice of the last Messenger right praise the Lord amen amen oh my goodness oh my goodness people why can't we see it well why why should it look like this message is a bondage to you this message is your freedom this message is the grace of God to you but in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels when he shall begin to sound have you heard the sounding of that angel have you heard the sounding of that angel praise the Lord you will even know the mystery of your life when you have heard that something you will know the mystery of your life you will know why mysterious things have happened to you because you have always been in God's plan you have been in God's Plan of Redemption and there is no devil in hell that can rob you of that in the dead of the voice of the Seven Angels when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God the mystery of your life the mystery of this book praise the Lord we'll be revealed he swore by himself praise the Lord you if you take God by his word if you take God by his word you don't have nothing it's the end of all strife [Music] praise the lord it's the end of all our inner stride devil you can blast my mind with anything you want all I know my soul is healed and Bound for heaven I've heard the voice of the seven angels I don't care what people say and I've heard the voice of the seven angels I know the mystery of my life that's why the message must do to you when that Mighty angel came down and met brother Branham he said I'm sent from almighty God to tell you about your mysterious life amen just like he talked about him about his mysterious life that same Angel is here in the form of the message for you to discover the mystery of your life why things happen to you either you have no regret you must always be grateful to God [Music] [Applause] yeah praise the Lord hallelujah oh God you are my help Hallelujah my my my mind but in the dead of the voice of the seven angel praise the Lord God said behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the Great and the Dreadful day if Elijah don't come I will smash the Earth with a curse praise the Lord just like how Philly has held back the wrath of God the coming of Elijah is holding back the wrath of God to get a people ready have you heard the voice of the seven Angel praise the Lord have you heard the voice of the seven angel [Applause] praise the Lord it is how much value you put to the one that had given the promise glory be to God amen with God is is nothing like oh I I really never thought you would do it have you have you ever been in that place somebody promised you mm-hmm when they bring it oh wow which means you hot you you could not extend the one that promised with what he promised there was so much distance between what he promised and who he is so him fulfilling that promise surprise you but that is not with almighty God he is the creator of Heaven and Earth praise the Lord amen he's the creator of Heaven and Earth he swear that time will be no more in this short space of time when time is normal when I'm bringing everything to an End Amen there is no more time for politics no more time for religion it has all run out of time they can never become better again God said right in that time the mysteries of God will be revealed Hallelujah the mysteries of God will be revealed as he have declared for his servants the prophets praise the Lord he will send a simple man from Kentucky to tie those loose ends praise the Lord tie those loose ends never even had a enough education to do that that's why God had to back him up with a supernatural gift yes praise the Lord if you have heard the voice of the seven angel you are honor and ought a you are honor and odd and if anything should go wrong you must hold yourself responsible if anything should go wrong you hold yourself responsible but he left his hands to heaven with one foot over the seed and one for on the earth and he swear by himself that everything that I've heard back from the human race ages I would like it no more praise the Lord Hallelujah amen so that's the reason why the way that God will help brother Branham he's born with this gift even as a child he's seeing a vision of a bridge falling he's having a vision that they will be moving to New Albany when he have never heard that for God to be able to help him because I mean his family news is is a bad news father it's a drunk no good mean there and uh in the city that he live and all of that hmm the angel had to come to help him to understand his life praise the Lord amen God is having more interest in helping you to understand the way he's dealing with you then you understanding the serpent seed God is having more interest to you for you to understand because when he gets you to understand he gets you involved in your own life the things he wants to do through your life we pass out for the the the the the seventhana we
