[7:51] this morning
[7:58] brother Jordan ma do I need to switch to
[8:01] a different microphone are we gonna be
[8:02] okay
[8:03] all right God amen
[8:06] how do you you know all that song got
[8:08] written anybody know how that song got
[8:11] written you do sister Carol amen it was
[8:13] as a man named Spafford and he was a
[8:17] wealthy man living in Chicago and Dwight
[8:21] Moody
[8:21] of course we heard about Dwight Moody
[8:23] and the sermon this morning but Dwight
[8:27] Moody was his pastor and that was when
[8:32] they had the great fire in Chicago there
[8:35] and Spafford actually owned quite a bit
[8:40] of lakefront property at that time and
[8:42] he had a lot of his buildings actually
[8:45] burned down and so he had a lot of
[8:48] struggle in his life even though he was
[8:51] well-to-do the fire had wiped out a lot
[8:54] of it and he actually his son actually
[8:59] even before that happened his son
[9:01] actually died of sickness and then when
[9:08] they were going to he was actually going
[9:11] to be taking a trip over to to Europe
[9:16] with his family he has daughters and his
[9:19] wife and at the last moment he had to
[9:22] stay back because the City of Chicago
[9:24] the local government there said he had
[9:28] to be there too as a looked at what was
[9:32] going on with the destruction of the
[9:34] buildings that had burned down he had to
[9:37] be there so he had to stay behind so he
[9:40] told his wife and daughters to go ahead
[9:42] and he was going to meet them over in
[9:45] Europe and so as they were traveling by
[9:48] ship over there that ship actually
[9:51] struck another ship in the fog and and
[9:57] when he got the news his wife actually
[10:01] to find out whether his family had
[10:04] gotten rescued or not and his wife said
[10:07] that they were then able to send a
[10:08] telegram wife only he had lost all of
[10:13] his daughters at sea and so he took the
[10:17] next ship and he asked if the captain
[10:22] the ship that could you just let me know
[10:25] when we get to the place where my
[10:26] daughter's know where they were the
[10:28] accident at my daughter's drowned and so
[10:31] right when he got to that place they
[10:36] stopped and he just was able to just
[10:41] consider that and all of a sudden these
[10:43] words came flooding that's why you see
[10:47] the song and the part the very first
[10:49] verse went peace like a river attendeth
[10:52] my way when sorrows like sea billows
[10:56] roll whatever my lot thou has taught me
[11:01] to say it as well as well with my soul
[11:07] so out of tragedy God took that and
[11:13] brought this song so that we would have
[11:16] the privilege of being will sing that
[11:19] this morning so
[11:21] oh my hallelujah hallelujah amen
[11:29] so as we would go to prayer this morning
[11:33] let's just consider him Amen that as
[11:40] long as we're in Christ just like we
[11:43] heard our brother preach last night when
[11:45] the storms going on in our lives that we
[11:50] can by faith say all as well for the one

[49:26] about a meeting and the other guy says I
[49:30] was so tired but it I was so so tired
[49:33] and I just had to fly back home I can
[49:38] say yeah I myself - I was tired but you

[50:10] we will save Gausman today amen praise
[50:13] the Lord
[50:13] blood arrows supposed to preach tonight
[50:15] but just like he said he never said a
[50:19] lot about it June we were over in Alaska
[50:22] doing the meeting there and and I mean
[50:25] he came to the service when he were here
[50:28] or tip-up you know because he had just
[50:32] had a you know soldered on his ears they
[50:36] just caught a cancer I mean it was a
[50:38] hole in his ear he came to the service
[50:40] bleeding and I was saying to myself how
[50:42] can he do this praise the Lord
[50:45] and and not too long the Lord kanafeh
[50:50] healed him out of a serious back pain
[50:53] where he couldn't walk amen and and
[50:57] brother it is not a young man he's a
[51:01] little bit in age praise the Lord
[51:03] even though when the Holy Ghost comes
[51:05] down he run around just like a 16 year
[51:07] old but then after the service he paid
[51:11] for it if you don't get some rest
[51:13] praise the Lord so right after the
[51:16] service I told him to put all he can
[51:18] into the service this morning because he
[51:21] had to drive back to West counseling
[51:23] three hours and he has an alimony flight
[51:25] so there won't be service this evening

[51:39] the Lord Amen and you can have him to
[51:42] preach for four hours if you're able to
[51:45] port praise the Lord
[51:49] anything about it I was thinking about
[51:51] it this morning you know it's not it's
[51:54] not how many service we have praise the
[51:58] Lord
[51:58] it used to be in the days of the revival
[52:03] when every point an evangelist was
[52:06] coming to town just for one meeting
[52:08] praise the Lord all the neighbors knew
[52:10] about it he mean you go to the grocery
[52:13] store they are talking about it and
[52:14] evangelists coming to town I mean all
[52:16] down the street and people go from the
[52:19] meeting and it go to testify of what God
[52:22] you know dead doing the meeting how he
[52:24] healed a second in the things that he
[52:26] was doing you know like I like the
[52:29] prophet of God said he says every mortar
[52:32] must have the opportunity to hear this
[52:34] gospel once because you take one truth
[52:38] experience of Jesus Christ to change our
[52:40] lives praise the Lord
[52:43] so let's pour our best into the service
[52:46] this morning praise the Lord and and
[52:50] just like we said we were setting this
[52:53] time aside to be thankful to the Lord as
[52:56] a church for many things that he brought
[53:00] us true amen and he stayed bringing us
[53:02] true praise the Lord me so we we try

[58:03] [Music]
[58:05] praise the Lord
[58:07] aren't you grateful the Lord's mindful
[58:09] of us you can be seated just for a
[58:12] moment and I shared a little something
[58:17] with you last night and you seem to
[58:18] enjoy this so I thought it maybe just
[58:19] shared another something with you this
[58:22] morning or how mindful God is of us and
[58:26] how much he's actually in control of our
[58:28] lives even though sometimes maybe we
[58:30] feel like nothing's in control of our
[58:32] lives yet God is in control he he knows
[58:35] all things since several year ago I was
[58:37] down in the southern part of Mexico
[58:39] preaching and the Maya Indians down
[58:42] Aaron as the preacher brother there and
[58:46] he was just got on my heart and I said
[58:51] I'd like to help you is there anything
[58:52] we can do to help you he said we need
[58:55] Bibles he said we've got people in our
[58:58] church has never owned the Bible in
[59:01] their life and when he told me that I
[59:03] thought my goodness how how many do I
[59:06] have at home
[59:08] and yet these people some of them never
[59:10] owned the Bible in their life and he
[59:12] said if we could get a thousand Bibles
[59:14] he said we could give everybody in our
[59:16] church a Bible and then we could use
[59:17] them to witness on the streets and pass
[59:20] them out say they don't have to be
[59:21] anything fancy just a simple Spanish
[59:24] Bible and so I said well brother I you
[59:26] know I won't promise you anything but
[59:28] when I get home we'll just see what we
[59:29] can do so I got home and mentioned it to
[59:31] my brother-in-law was Sunday school
[59:32] superintendent and so the little kids
[59:34] started bringing their nickels and their
[59:36] dimes and their quarters and their
[59:37] dollars and it wasn't long that we had
[59:39] enough money to buy the Bibles to send
[59:42] them down into Mexico and so brother
[59:44] binaya Spinola was my interpreter and I
[59:46] was talking to brother banana I said you
[59:48] know I was thinking instead of buying
[59:50] the Bibles in America and shipping them
[59:52] across the border and having to pay
[59:53] customs because you getting some of them
[59:55] country's everybody wants a little bit
[59:58] of money before they pass it on you know
[59:59] and sometimes it costs more to get it in
[1:00:01] than it costs to have it to made to
[1:00:04] Gideon you know and so I said maybe we
[1:00:06] could just bomb it in Mexico and he said
[1:00:08] I'll look into it so he called me back
[1:00:09] said I found a printer that said they'd
[1:00:11] make just a simple paperback Bible and
[1:00:13] and they would make a thousand Bibles
[1:00:15] for the amount of money we had I sell
[1:00:17] for
[1:00:17] the Lord let's just do that and so then
[1:00:19] he called me the next day he said the
[1:00:20] printer called and said he would do one
[1:00:22] or two things either he would reduce the
[1:00:24] cost of the Bibles and and we could get
[1:00:26] a thousand Bibles for for less money or
[1:00:29] he would print for the same amount of
[1:00:31] money he would print a thousand and six
[1:00:33] Bibles he said so do you want for less
[1:00:35] for each Bible or just print a thousand
[1:00:37] and six I said tell him just to print a
[1:00:39] thousand and six Bibles you know you can
[1:00:41] never have too many Bibles anyway so I
[1:00:43] said just time to print a thousand and
[1:00:45] six so the Bibles were ready and they
[1:00:46] got the book and the brother benignly
[1:00:48] put them on I know it's a long story but
[1:00:49] I am coming to a point and they put the
[1:00:51] Bibles underneath this bus and so they
[1:00:53] were busing them down to the southern
[1:00:54] part of Mexico which was about a 15 hour
[1:00:56] bus ride and I flew down there to be
[1:00:58] there and when they gave the Bibles out
[1:01:01] and friends I take if you just saw them
[1:01:03] people grab their Bibles and hold them
[1:01:05] up to their heart and just weep because
[1:01:07] it's the first Bible they ever owned in
[1:01:09] their life and but on the way down to
[1:01:12] the southern part of Mexico brother
[1:01:14] B'nai and those on the bus got stopped
[1:01:16] by Mexican soldiers and made everybody
[1:01:19] get off the bus and they raised up the
[1:01:21] bottom of the bus and here's all these
[1:01:22] boxes so they said what's in those boxes
[1:01:25] and brother man I said their Bibles
[1:01:27] I said Bibles they said you're selling
[1:01:29] Bibles no no no we're not selling them
[1:01:31] we're giving them away so this Mexican
[1:01:34] soldier said you're giving these Bibles
[1:01:35] wasted yes we're taking them down here
[1:01:37] to the southern part of Mexico Katsina
[1:01:39] in that area and we're going to give
[1:01:40] them away and so the Mexican soldier
[1:01:42] said well if you're given Bibles away
[1:01:44] said we don't have a Bible said would
[1:01:46] you give us a Bible if there was
[1:01:51] he said why sure would be glad to give
[1:01:53] you a Bible say how many of they are you
[1:01:55] he said there's six of us
[1:01:58] [Applause]

[1:05:08] this morning Lord and just worship you
[1:05:12] may you come and receive honor and glory
[1:05:14] unto thyself Lord but we actually stakes
[1:05:17] in Jesus name and the bride says it may
[1:05:20] God bless you may be seated this morning
[1:05:23] probably God said have you ever noticed
[1:05:26] how the world gets into the spirit of
[1:05:27] the things that are in the world they go
[1:05:32] to their ballgames and their sporting
[1:05:33] events is in their
[1:05:34] dances and they enter right into the
[1:05:37] spirit of it and we know this the truth
[1:05:40] then in the hotel room there this
[1:05:42] morning when we went down the lobby D
[1:05:43] breakfast there were people down there
[1:05:45] with the Viking hats own and their back
[1:05:47] and jackets all because they were Viking
[1:05:49] fans and they were getting ready to go
[1:05:51] to a Viking game a bed and they wanted
[1:05:54] everybody to know that's my team that's
[1:05:56] there's a little boy there and he said
[1:05:57] back in says my team and that's who I'm
[1:05:59] for and we're going to see the game and
[1:06:01] I thought my my my they're so excited
[1:06:04] about going to a ball game and I was
[1:06:06] thinking hot just a little bit more
[1:06:07] we'll be able to go to church hallelujah
[1:06:10] I'm so glad amen that my excitement into
[1:06:13] something that stirs me is not a ball
[1:06:15] game but it's the Word of God but the
[1:06:18] world gets into the spirit of it I
[1:06:19] remember one time I worked with a man
[1:06:21] and he was a volunteer for fan of the UT
[1:06:24] football team that in Knoxville
[1:06:26] Tennessee and big donor everybody says
[1:06:28] their blood runs orange because they're
[1:06:30] all fans of UT and and I remember I
[1:06:33] worked with this man and him and his
[1:06:34] uncle were going down to the ball game
[1:06:36] and on the way to the ball game his
[1:06:38] uncle had a massive heart attack and
[1:06:40] this man took him by the emergency room
[1:06:42] let him out and went to the ball game
[1:06:45] I said Roland you didn't do your uncle
[1:06:47] that way he said when I checked on him
[1:06:49] on halftime do you know why he did it
[1:06:52] he did that because he was a fan he was
[1:06:54] aut fan and I thought my if a man could
[1:06:57] do that for a ball game how dedicated
[1:06:59] and commitment ought we to be to the
[1:07:01] Lord Jesus Christ amen they go to their
[1:07:04] ball games they're scream until o muddy
[1:07:06] their horse they'll grab horns and
[1:07:08] they'll shake rattles and they'll jump
[1:07:10] up and down why because they're getting
[1:07:12] into the spirit of the game amen
[1:07:15] or he said have you ever noticed they
[1:07:17] get into their dances and they enter
[1:07:19] right into the spirit of it they don't
[1:07:21] sit there like a Wallflower or an old
[1:07:23] dried up stick they enter right into the
[1:07:26] fill of things and become a part of the
[1:07:28] things ain't man
[1:07:29] they don't just sit there and watch the
[1:07:31] game they become a part of the game and
[1:07:33] I thought oh my if they could do that to
[1:07:35] a sporting event what about we to do
[1:07:37] this more than for his not just kind of
[1:07:39] sound like an old proud of stick
[1:07:41] just some Wallflower sitting on a wall
[1:07:43] but god help us this border to get into
[1:07:46] it and to become a part of what's
[1:07:47] happening a path I didn't come this
[1:07:50] morning to see what's happened I've come
[1:07:52] this morning because I am what's
[1:07:54] happening hey babe hey man I don't want
[1:07:57] to be just a spectator but God help me
[1:08:00] to be a participator then I'll give the
[1:08:02] best a man
[1:08:03] then I'll go hallelujah then I'll give
[1:08:05] the best sweat the best hallelujah that
[1:08:07] I have this morning a man that in
[1:08:11] Knoxville Tennessee at the UT Stadium
[1:08:13] where the ballplayers meet it to the
[1:08:15] locker room they've got a sign that they
[1:08:17] tap every time they run out to the field
[1:08:19] they'll tap this sign and above the door
[1:08:21] when they run out onto the field above
[1:08:23] the doors this sign it says this day I
[1:08:25] give my all for Tennessee and they'll
[1:08:28] run out and they'll smack that side and
[1:08:30] run right out onto the football field in
[1:08:32] front of thousands of fans and the roar
[1:08:35] of the crowd and they'll go out there
[1:08:37] and they'll sweat
[1:08:38] and they'll get dirty and they'll get
[1:08:40] bruised up some of them break bones some
[1:08:42] of those been paralyzed some herbs even
[1:08:44] died but they done it because they gave
[1:08:46] all for Tennessee you know what I did I
[1:08:49] made me a son you don't say I give my
[1:08:51] all for Tennessee it says to say I give
[1:08:54] my all to Jesus Christ I could say I
[1:09:00] gave the best that I knew how to give
[1:09:02] whether I felt like it or not come on
[1:09:04] somebody if the world connect like that
[1:09:10] over a ballgame how are we to act this
[1:09:12] morning Oh something that's really worth
[1:09:14] getting involved in amen but all my they
[1:09:20] don't have a problem at all screaming
[1:09:21] and shouting and carrying on but how
[1:09:24] they hate Christians for getting into
[1:09:27] the spirit of God's Word but father said
[1:09:30] that call us fanatics holy rollers
[1:09:33] there's nothing they won't do to show
[1:09:36] their hatred and their disapproval they
[1:09:43] don't care to scream them they'll the
[1:09:45] person front they don't whoever they are
[1:09:46] but they'll beat them on the head when
[1:09:48] their team scores but yet you go to
[1:09:52] worship God
[1:09:53] if people want to look at you like
[1:09:55] you're like you're some fanatic or
[1:09:57] something's wrong with you you hung
[1:09:58] around an amen and the people turn
[1:10:00] around and see who it is you know we
[1:10:05] want to be whenever the time everybody
[1:10:07] wants to be politically correct so you
[1:10:11] know if the world hates for us to get
[1:10:13] emotional and hates for us to get
[1:10:15] excited and hates for us to pray then
[1:10:17] maybe we should just calm down you know
[1:10:24] to be politically correct and get along
[1:10:26] in America maybe we should go along with
[1:10:28] their desire and just come to church and
[1:10:30] set like on a wildfire but here's what
[1:10:33] the Prophet said to do about it is that
[1:10:35] how they call us fanatics and holy
[1:10:37] rollers and there's nothing they won't
[1:10:38] do to show their hatred and their
[1:10:40] disapproval but here's what the Prophet
[1:10:42] said he said men ignore it you can
[1:10:47] expect it no words coming from just go
[1:10:50] to get into the spirit of worship our
[1:10:52] spirit is clean it is fresh it is real
[1:10:56] it is sober and it's serious but
[1:10:59] nonetheless it's full of the joy of the
[1:11:02] Lord a man will have to come to church
[1:11:05] with half joy of faith of joy where my
[1:11:07] joy takes almost empty no the Bible says
[1:11:10] that our joy can be full amen amen
[1:11:15] the Christian ought to be just as
[1:11:17] exuberant and full of this pleasure in
[1:11:20] the Lord as the world when it savers and
[1:11:24] delights in its pleasure
[1:11:26] what's the Prophet say is simply this if
[1:11:29] they could get excited over a piece of
[1:11:30] pig skin we could get excited over the
[1:11:32] Word of God
[1:11:34] [Applause]
[1:11:35] both Christians and the world are human
[1:11:40] both have emotions you know some people
[1:11:46] say sometime well your brother
[1:11:48] I'm just not emotional I'm sorry that's
[1:11:52] just simply not true now that's true
[1:11:55] some of us may be quieter than others
[1:11:57] that's true
[1:11:57] but we all are emotional amen if you go
[1:12:03] to bed denied and you turn out the light
[1:12:05] and and you want to smooth the furniture
[1:12:07] that you didn't know she moved and you
[1:12:09] hid your big toe against the edge of the
[1:12:11] dresser you will be become emotional
[1:12:16] that's true you ain't going to tell me
[1:12:20] that you ripped the hole into your
[1:12:22] toenail off and you say my goodness look
[1:12:25] at that yeah I believe it's completely
[1:12:32] gone
[1:12:36] look at the blood no if you if you rip
[1:12:44] the end of your toenail off going to bed
[1:12:45] tonight you'll kiss that big toe if you
[1:12:47] can get it in your mouth you know I'm
[1:12:49] telling you the truth humans are
[1:12:51] emotional and I believe the church a man
[1:12:56] ought to be a Church of life and a
[1:12:58] church of praise and a church of
[1:13:00] worshipping man because any religion
[1:13:03] that's dead should be buried but I'm
[1:13:06] here to tell you this morning we don't
[1:13:08] have a dead religion Muhammad has a dead
[1:13:12] religion Buddha has a dead religion
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] and he said because I'm a man
[1:13:33] both Christians in the world are human
[1:13:35] both have emotions but the difference is
[1:13:38] the Christians heart and emotions are
[1:13:40] purely whom the Lord of glory and his
[1:13:43] love while the world satisfies the flesh
[1:13:46] listen to me I'm not talking about
[1:13:48] something that'll glorify the flesh I'm
[1:13:50] not talking about something that works
[1:13:51] on your emotions this morning I'm not
[1:13:53] talking about what I'm talking about
[1:13:55] he's just loving to love God just to
[1:14:02] thank him as we sang this morning I just
[1:14:05] want to thank you Lord just thank you
[1:14:09] and love him and rejoice because there
[1:14:12] is no God like our God you know sure if
[1:14:22] y'all ever been to India you know the
[1:14:24] Indians are in India they'll make
[1:14:26] yourself a god and they'll pack this
[1:14:28] gone around out of wood or metal or and
[1:14:30] they'll pack this car around and every
[1:14:32] once while they'll set it down and
[1:14:34] they'll worship the God that they made
[1:14:35] with their hands but I'm so glad this
[1:14:38] morning that I'm not here gathered here
[1:14:40] that we're not here gathered worshiping
[1:14:42] some God that we made with our hands I'm
[1:14:45] glad we're not worshiping this morning a
[1:14:46] God of our imagination or a God of a
[1:14:49] denomination come on somebody but I'm so
[1:14:51] glad this morning that the god I worship
[1:14:54] I didn't fashion with my hands but god I
[1:14:56] worship this morning he fashioned me he
[1:15:00] made me with his hair
[1:15:02] oh boy to God every man do you hey man

[1:15:13] you now you better be careful

[1:17:12] the word says I'm delivered don't wait
[1:17:17] for signs and wonders take God at His
[1:17:20] Word that's what he's trying to been
[1:17:23] teach us for years that's what he's
[1:17:24] trying to tell us for years that's what
[1:17:26] the Prophet was saying this morning
[1:17:27] about the bride coming to her position
[1:17:30] then when it's time God Oh said someone
[1:17:33] to call her back in line to want the
[1:17:35] word amen amen
[1:17:39] don't look at the symptoms hey man don't
[1:17:43] wait for some well I'm gonna wait and
[1:17:44] say I'm completely healed and I want to
[1:17:47] tell everybody know if you've got it
[1:17:48] right you'll tell everybody when you
[1:17:50] still can't hardly get out of bed you're
[1:17:51] still you know what ideas I got me a
[1:17:55] piece of soap and I went to the mirror
[1:17:57] in the bathroom and my wife is gracious
[1:17:59] she left it there it's been there for
[1:18:00] months now but I got me a piece of soap
[1:18:02] when I could hardly get out of the bed
[1:18:04] and I made my way into the bathroom
[1:18:06] because my back was so bad and I got on
[1:18:08] a mirror and I wrote God is my healer Oh
[1:18:13] and every morning when I get up and I
[1:18:16] look into the mirror you don't want to
[1:18:17] see I see that side God is my healer and
[1:18:22] the Prophet said your body will obey
[1:18:24] your confession
[1:18:28] [Applause]
[1:18:31] the Prophet said I believe if every
[1:18:34] patient in this building right now would
[1:18:37] accept it upon the grounds of God's Word
[1:18:39] and believe it and start testifying and
[1:18:42] praising God for your healing the meetin
[1:18:45] wouldn't close with one crippled person
[1:18:47] in here God is under obligation to
[1:18:53] answer his word and I say to us this
[1:18:57] morning why not us why not Nell what
[1:19:02] does that have to be a quote that we
[1:19:03] read why can't there be a reality why
[1:19:12] not me why not now
[1:19:14] why not us why not now why are we wake
[1:19:19] known God's not dead God's not been
[1:19:22] weakened God told Paul Paul you've got
[1:19:29] to go to Rome and on the way to Rome he
[1:19:34] got in a shipwreck bo-best it all apart
[1:19:37] Paul was able to grab a part of the ship
[1:19:40] and float to land he gets out of land
[1:19:43] everybody's wet everybody's cold Paul
[1:19:46] being a servant he goes and gathers
[1:19:49] would think that something the prophet
[1:19:52] of God was gathering would you see
[1:19:55] people get it wrong the ministers are
[1:19:59] servants to the bride the bride is not
[1:20:02] servants to the fivefold ministry my
[1:20:07] lord I thought surely you know a man
[1:20:10] that a man they wouldn't wait no Paul
[1:20:14] Paul didn't say look now I'm the church
[1:20:16] age messenger you boys go get some wood
[1:20:18] while I sit here no he was the one
[1:20:19] getting the wood and on the way back in
[1:20:25] the pile of wood you know the story was
[1:20:27] the deadly snake I'm talking bad I'm
[1:20:32] talking about old my black snake I'm
[1:20:34] talking something bad this thing was so
[1:20:37] deadly when it bit you didn't you didn't
[1:20:39] even have thought they would
[1:20:40] used to call 9-1-1 you couldn't doubt
[1:20:43] the nine before they were dead
[1:20:46] that's how bad this snake was it was so
[1:20:51] bad it was so bad that we Paul got bid
[1:20:55] you know what they did they said under
[1:20:57] watch him die and you know what they
[1:21:01] said this man has really done something
[1:21:04] bad wrong he survived a shipwreck and
[1:21:08] now he's snake bit if I ain't God trying
[1:21:10] to kill him I don't know what it is when
[1:21:17] he got bit they were saying this man
[1:21:19] there's something bad wrong with him
[1:21:22] but look at Paul Paul looked at snake he
[1:21:27] felt God told me I've got to go to Rome
[1:21:31] so how can I go to Rome and die from a
[1:21:36] snake bite so Paul took the Word of God
[1:21:40] over the venomous snake and with the
[1:21:46] death started calming up his arm you
[1:21:48] know what it ran into it ran into face
[1:21:51] adversity antidote Evelyn Paul didn't
[1:21:59] die you know what they said they said
[1:22:02] this man is a God Hey well I tell you
[1:22:12] brother down now that's good so far
[1:22:13] that's really good but you know what I
[1:22:15] paid now if I was healthy
[1:22:17] I praise God if I had no worries I
[1:22:21] praise God if I was wealthy I praise God
[1:22:27] well that's all right I appreciated that
[1:22:30] I'm sure you would huh I had a lot of
[1:22:32] money I'd praise him dude but you see
[1:22:35] the problem with that there's nothing
[1:22:37] you know that's that's good thinking if
[1:22:39] I was healthy wealthy and wise and I had
[1:22:41] all that I'd certainly praise God and
[1:22:42] you know that's that's certainly our
[1:22:44] noble let's see the problem with your
[1:22:46] thinking is this the Bible says let
[1:22:50] everything
[1:22:52] please the Lord let the sad man a happy
[1:22:58] man but now some of you need a reason
[1:23:39] for not praising God I actually found
[1:23:42] one in the Bible I know you go get quiet
[1:23:45] and that's good because I wanted to hear
[1:23:47] this if somebody this morning don't want
[1:23:51] to praise God and you're pulling back
[1:23:52] and got there right now he ain't gonna
[1:23:54] make me jump up and I'm not trying to
[1:23:56] make you jump up but if you need a
[1:23:59] reason not to praise God this morning I
[1:24:02] found what and it's even in the Bible
[1:24:09] but to hang just a saying you need make
[1:24:17] myself laugh if you need a reason not to
[1:24:20] praise God I found one in the scriptures
[1:24:22] the bible says the psalms 115 verse 17
[1:24:26] the dead praise not the lord neither
[1:24:34] that any that go down in silence so if
[1:24:37] you're dead this morning
[1:24:38] you're excused
[1:24:41] Oh exactly
[1:24:58] you see I come like this brother I come
[1:25:01] for one purpose this morning I didn't
[1:25:03] come to complain I didn't come to find
[1:25:05] fault I didn't come to sleep I didn't
[1:25:07] cut the text I didn't come to sit on a
[1:25:10] pew I didn't cut the on the
[1:25:11] preacher but I came for one purpose I
[1:25:14] came back the main job they travel two
[1:25:16] years over the desert through the
[1:25:18] valleys but when they got there they
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:34] come for one purpose
[1:25:36] that's the worship my god or like that
[1:25:42] song I don't know what you came to do
[1:25:44] but I came to praise the Lord amen
[1:25:50] whatever state you find yourself in just
[1:25:53] praise Him just worship Him just give
[1:25:57] him praise the Bible says in one Psalm
[1:26:00] 148 praise ye the Lord praise ye the
[1:26:03] Lord from the heavens praise Him in the
[1:26:05] heights praise him all his angels
[1:26:08] praising ye are his hosts praising him

[1:26:14] light praise him he heavens of heavens

[1:26:18] heavens let them praise the name of the
[1:26:20] Lord for he command and they were

[1:26:25] forever and ever he has made it a Kree
[1:26:27] which shall not pass praise the Lord
[1:26:31] from the earth he dragons and all deeps
[1:26:32] fire in hell snow and vapour stormy
[1:26:36] winds fulfilling his word mountains and
[1:26:39] all hills fruitful trees and all cedars
[1:26:42] beasts and cattle and creeping things
[1:26:45] and flying flower kings of the earth or
[1:26:48] were not excused and all the people
[1:26:50] princesses and all judges of the earth
[1:26:53] both young men and maidens Oh men and
[1:26:59] children let them praise the name of the
[1:27:03] Lord for their name alone is excellent
[1:27:08] his glory is above the earth and the
[1:27:11] heavens you know I'm not smart I'm not a
[1:27:16] smart person I ain't never been smart
[1:27:17] the three hardest years of my life was
[1:27:19] second grade you well think about it
[1:27:23] I've just never been smart somebody
[1:27:27] asked me one time said you speak a
[1:27:28] foreign language did you how English I
[1:27:30] don't know a verb from an adverb I don't
[1:27:33] understand those things but there's one
[1:27:37] thing I know sis when I speak the name
[1:27:40] Jesus I am saying an excellent in the
[1:27:52] name of Jesus to break every chain
[1:27:56] he's the waymaker like the name of Jesus
[1:28:04] and when we call upon that name you are
[1:28:09] speaking an excellent word the Bible
[1:28:13] says let everything that hath breath
[1:28:15] praise ye the Lord super brother
[1:28:20] homesick listen I said let's not no I'm
[1:28:25] not belittling that I certainly know
[1:28:28] what it is to hurt I know what it is to
[1:28:31] bury loved ones I know what it is to go
[1:28:34] to a hospital to see your baby lady in a
[1:28:36] coma on life support I I've been I know
[1:28:38] that then it's real and I'm not
[1:28:42] belittling at all but if we could only
[1:28:45] understand this border that every Sikh
[1:28:47] Christian while sick we have a thousand
[1:28:52] times more to be happy over
[1:28:55] then the most cheerful sinner you look
[1:29:01] at these Hollywood stars and all their
[1:29:03] Fame and all their money and all their
[1:29:06] cars cost more than my house but are
[1:29:10] they happy they end up hanging herself
[1:29:13] in the hotel room so there's no joy in
[1:29:18] that some of you young people sue I
[1:29:20] can't wait I get a little bit older get
[1:29:21] out of this church I'm gonna get me a
[1:29:23] football career I'm gonna get me a
[1:29:24] basketball career all right we'll get me
[1:29:26] a singing career but let me tell you
[1:29:27] something it'll never bring you joy you
[1:29:33] may break every record in the state of
[1:29:35] Minnesota they may write your name in
[1:29:37] the record book but I promise you in a
[1:29:38] hundred years nobody will know who you
[1:29:40] are but you give your life for Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ where there is no stars where
[1:29:45] there is no more America your name will
[1:29:49] still be the plant you know the prophet
[1:29:50] of God said that will you lead someone
[1:29:53] to the Lord your name is associated with
[1:29:55] that person throughout eternity you know
[1:30:01] the prophet of God said a little wash
[1:30:02] woman took her wash money sewing money
[1:30:04] and she cleaned out a stable she rented
[1:30:06] a stable cleaned it out invited a
[1:30:08] preacher and that night in just a
[1:30:10] shaggy-headed twelve-year-old boy showed
[1:30:12] up for the service he gave his heart to
[1:30:16] the Lord and the prophet of God said
[1:30:18] that little boy was DL Moody and BL
[1:30:20] Moody led a million souls to Jesus
[1:30:22] Christ and you know what he said that
[1:30:24] wash lady led a million-in-one
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] you know what you do for Christ will be
[1:30:35] declared throughout eternity hell maybe
[1:30:39] sick that may be true but we still got
[1:30:41] more to be happy about you know why
[1:30:42] because we've got a savior
[1:30:44] we got a healer we've got a deliverer
[1:30:46] we've got a god that's mindful of us who
[1:30:49] said I'll never leave you nor will I
[1:30:50] forsake you listen to me this morning I
[1:30:54] may have pain and they have sorrow and
[1:30:56] they have trials and they have troubles
[1:30:58] but I've got a God that's bigger than
[1:31:00] all that he's bigger than all my
[1:31:02] problems he's bigger than all my fears
[1:31:03] my God's figure they need him ousted
[1:31:05] that I can and cannot see my God is
[1:31:08] bigger
[1:31:11] he loves me remember remember when we
[1:31:19] was little
[1:31:19] so y'all may be downloads to me from
[1:31:21] different countries maybe but when I was
[1:31:23] little we had a daisy we picked that
[1:31:25] little Daisy we had a girl we were sweet
[1:31:27] on and we'd pull that off she says she
[1:31:31] loves me she loves me not
[1:31:35] y'all done it to she loves me she loves
[1:31:40] me not mine always ended on she don't
[1:31:47] then I met my wife and she did but when
[1:31:56] it comes to God and you pick up the days
[1:31:58] he wondered does God love me you know
[1:32:00] what that days he says he loves me he
[1:32:03] loves me he loves me we were yet sinners
[1:32:07] Christ John our 17:14 says heal me Lord
[1:32:16] I shall be healed
[1:32:18] save me Lord shall be saved
[1:32:23] for thou art my praise if I want to use
[1:32:30] my breath oh god help me let me use it
[1:32:32] to praise him not talk about my problems
[1:32:34] but let me use it to exalt his name to
[1:32:37] lift up his name for he said if I be
[1:32:40] lifted up I will draw all men unto
[1:32:42] myself house there 16 verse 18 says this
[1:32:48] violence shall no more be heard in thy
[1:32:51] land wasting or destruction within thy
[1:32:53] borders but thou shalt called thy walls
[1:32:56] salvation and thy gates praise gates of
[1:33:04] praise God has given us walls of
[1:33:08] salvation and gates now you know I
[1:33:14] gained us two things a gate keeps things

[1:33:43] if you just praise His name Oh God let
[1:33:50] your praise be your entrance into his
[1:33:53] presence the Bible said God inhabits the
[1:33:56] days of his bball well your backs
[1:34:00] against the wall and the Devils coming

[1:39:57] owned a short sleeve shirt that day the
[1:39:59] Spirit of God moved through the people
[1:40:00] and this girl testified she said I
[1:40:03] wanted to raise my arms and worship God
[1:40:06] but I was ashamed of the scars she had
[1:40:10] them all up and down her arms she said
[1:40:13] lord I want to worship you
[1:40:14] hello people to see these scars and she
[1:40:18] said a voice spoke to her and said raise
[1:40:21] your arms and give me praise I was there
[1:40:25] that sister raised her arms and the
[1:40:28] scars left her arms
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:35] she didn't have the trouble worshiping
[1:40:37] God she didn't have no trouble shouting
[1:40:39] she didn't have no trouble jumping up
[1:40:41] and down because God had took the stars
[1:40:43] away you've got stars in your life this

[1:41:04] can't undo what was done but there's one
[1:41:06] thing you can do you can take that pain
[1:41:08] you can take that hurt and turn it into
[1:41:10] worship and turn it into frame and that
[1:41:13] God take the scars away not only is the
[1:41:19] gate for entrance it's also a defense it
[1:41:24] keeps things out rev Rev says let's say

[1:43:52] I'll let not the oppressed return
[1:43:55] ashamed
[1:43:57] let the poor and needy praise the name
[1:44:03] not wait to have fully recovered not
[1:44:06] wait you were fully read delivered not
[1:44:08] not not wait till we get the job we
[1:44:10] asked God to give us and did praise him
[1:44:13] for it but when we asked him just start
[1:44:17] thanking him for it
[1:44:19] there was a sister role many a few years
[1:44:21] ago a gypsy girl about 19 year old she
[1:44:25] was born without a hip she come to the
[1:44:27] service on a crutch when she walked her
[1:44:29] leg would swing like this she had no
[1:44:31] control over it when she stopped her leg
[1:44:33] with sweets you'd have to stop it with
[1:44:35] her hand she comes to the RO I had the
[1:44:38] night services and Friday night she came
[1:44:41] to the altar and she wanted to repent of
[1:44:44] her sins I felt sorry for her
[1:44:47] since this she's trying to get down on
[1:44:50] her knees to repentance it's just you
[1:44:52] can repent right here where you stand
[1:44:53] but that wasn't good enough
[1:44:58] she worked that leg till she got down on
[1:45:03] the ground and repented and I thought my
[1:45:06] god how many people in America has two
[1:45:09] good legs and never kneels before the
[1:45:11] Lord what a rebuke she'll be one day the
[1:45:19] next morning was Saturday after service
[1:45:20] we had a baptismal service in a river
[1:45:23] that young girl with her crutch went out
[1:45:26] into that icy rushing river and was
[1:45:29] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ she
[1:45:32] come back Saturday night to the altar
[1:45:34] you know what she said
[1:45:34] Darrell I want the Lord to heal me she
[1:45:39] said I want to be a wife I want to have
[1:45:40] children she said but who would want to
[1:45:42] marry me like this and she said I'm
[1:45:46] gonna ask God to heal me I said you know
[1:45:48] what sis if I was you I said I wouldn't
[1:45:50] ask God to heal me because you're
[1:45:53] already healed
[1:45:54] I would simply just start thanking him
[1:45:57] for healing you I said you take this
[1:46:00] handkerchief and when God heals your
[1:46:03] help you send it back to me as the
[1:46:06] testimony of what God did for you two or
[1:46:11] three years went by and a brother came
[1:46:13] up to me at church he said brother
[1:46:14] Darrell I was in a chat room and the
[1:46:17] sister said do you know brother Darrell
[1:46:19] ward he said yes I go to church with him
[1:46:20] she said I'm trying to get a hold of him
[1:46:22] can I have his email address he says he
[1:46:24] said ok I said sure he ain't no problem
[1:46:26] me and my wife we'll look at it together
[1:46:27] it's no problem
[1:46:31] so I'll get this email from this girl
[1:46:34] her name was Christina she said brother
[1:46:39] there I've been trying to find you
[1:46:40] she said I did what you told me to do
[1:46:43] she said I went everywhere thanking God
[1:46:45] for my healing and she said it got to
[1:46:48] the point that my mama sent me down and
[1:46:50] said honey I want you to quit you're
[1:46:51] embarrassing the family because you're
[1:46:54] telling everybody God's healed your help
[1:46:56] and you're still on a crutch
[1:46:57] she said what brother died I didn't
[1:46:59] listen to my mama
[1:47:00] I just kept testify they said I was in
[1:47:04] young people's meeting I said let me say
[1:47:05] I want to testify
[1:47:07] I want to thank God for healing me and
[1:47:09] said even my friends got aggravated they
[1:47:14] said we're not I heard him say here she
[1:47:15] goes again she said but I kept doing it
[1:47:19] and she said I was in a service and I
[1:47:21] stood up and said I want to thank God
[1:47:23] for healing my Hill and she said brother
[1:47:26] Darrell when I said that my hip I was in
[1:47:51] Ohio at the youth the youth camp in Ohio
[1:47:53] a couple year ago and a brother came up
[1:47:55] to me from Romania he said brother Dale
[1:47:57] do you know Christina I said yes he said
[1:48:02] you know I said yes I said isn't it
[1:48:04] wonderful he said brother I was in the
[1:48:05] meeting I was sitting behind her he said
[1:48:09] I watched her leg grow up because he's
[1:48:15] God
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:23] how it must please God that we begin to
[1:48:27] give God praise while we're yet
[1:48:29] afflicted while were yet in need not
[1:48:34] wait till we're fully recovered but
[1:48:36] while we're yet poor while were yet
[1:48:38] needed we could still call upon his name
[1:48:40] we can still exalt his name we can
[1:48:43] praise God in the morning we can praise
[1:48:45] Him in the noon time we can praise Him
[1:48:47] in the night time listen to me just the
[1:48:51] one service they will just take it this
[1:48:52] a little bit of time but what Satan
[1:48:54] gonna do to a man that every time he
[1:48:57] afflicts him he praises God now I'm not
[1:49:06] too smart but you see if every time
[1:49:12] Satan afflict you you do that brother
[1:49:15] Jewell for me says rosie-wosie me or was
[1:49:19] he was he I think what he said was he
[1:49:21] was he mean and every time he inflicts
[1:49:25] you you quit coming to church whew well
[1:49:29] that was a stinger happen thank you lord
[1:49:34] only where that came from but anything
[1:49:37] every time something happens you get
[1:49:39] discouraged then what do you think that
[1:49:42] there was if the devil put something on
[1:49:44] you that gets you so discouraged that
[1:49:47] you can't come to church what do you
[1:49:49] think is gonna do the next day they go
[1:49:52] give you a double dose
[1:49:54] because it worked but I'm not too smart
[1:50:00] but I figure that if every time the
[1:50:03] devil punches me I say praise God
[1:50:06] every time he afflicts me you don't say
[1:50:08] just a greater chance for a miracle I
[1:50:11] threw all the devil's will say discus
[1:50:13] crazy he's lost his mind
[1:50:15] and that's true I have lost my minds
[1:50:18] because I've got the mind of Christ
[1:50:23] hey don't look at your symptoms look to
[1:50:26] your God look at Jonah this morning
[1:50:28] everywhere Jonah look worse whales belly
[1:50:32] now friends ain't nobody here been
[1:50:35] swallowed by no fish you know that's the
[1:50:39] truth so none of us has ever been where
[1:50:43] Jonah was and Jonah look at him can you
[1:50:46] imagine just for a minute
[1:50:48] here's Jonah swaddled by a great fish
[1:50:52] and he's in his belly well what do you
[1:50:56] reckon sin what do you reckon sin a
[1:51:01] fish's belly other fish I don't care
[1:51:06] will you cook it it stinks so can you
[1:51:11] imagine the smell seaweed around and
[1:51:17] they tied the guy happened throw him in
[1:51:18] the ocean here he is tied up in the
[1:51:22] bottom in a fish's belly with
[1:51:25] Mississippi license plates and
[1:51:27] everything else that's in this fish's
[1:51:28] belly and the fish just swallowed a man
[1:51:34] a 6-foot 200-pound man perhaps what do
[1:51:39] you think his stomach's gonna do start
[1:51:41] producing more acid to digest a
[1:51:44] 200-pound man so now all of a sudden and
[1:51:48] all he's in a fish's belly with other
[1:51:50] fish and it's smelling to high heavens
[1:51:52] here comes the acid in his mouth in his
[1:51:56] ears in his eyes let's say that was a
[1:51:59] widest white man you ever saw
[1:52:01] tell he was bleached out back you see
[1:52:05] what I'm saying for instance I've just
[1:52:07] tried to bring the point to you how bad
[1:52:09] his condition was but did he quit did he
[1:52:20] collapse in to spare but the Bible says
[1:52:23] Jonah said I cried out by reason of my
[1:52:30] affliction unto the Lord now I wonder
[1:52:33] sometimes if God allows things to come
[1:52:35] into our life just so we will cry out
[1:52:37] that he can come and deliver us and just
[1:52:40] show us how great he is Jonah said I
[1:52:47] cried I didn't cry by the acid I didn't
[1:52:50] cry because of the fish that was around
[1:52:52] me but I cried by my affliction to the
[1:52:56] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[1:52:58] Hell cried I and thou heard my voice the
[1:53:04] symptoms all God the symptoms never
[1:53:07] silenced his voice not in the midst of
[1:53:10] his trial he begin to praise God I will
[1:53:15] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[1:53:17] Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have
[1:53:21] vowed salvation is of the Lord right in
[1:53:25] the midst of his trial he started having
[1:53:27] a Thanksgiving week in service you began
[1:53:33] to praise God you know the father said
[1:53:37] when those fish eat
[1:53:38] he said they go right to the bottle he
[1:53:41] said watch you feed them little goldfish
[1:53:42] they go right to the bottom of the
[1:53:43] fishbowl and when this great fish
[1:53:45] swallowed this big man he went right
[1:53:47] down to the bottom of the ocean because
[1:53:49] he had two hundred pounds to digest so
[1:53:51] he's done are just all well that was a
[1:53:55] good mule right there
[1:53:56] can't beat that white meat because it
[1:54:01] it's just all there just and Jonah begin
[1:54:06] to praise God and God began to hear
[1:54:09] Jonah's voice and be God begin to answer
[1:54:13] back and so that fish was just and I
[1:54:16] wasn't whoa whoa oh my god Jonah's
[1:54:35] praise made the fish uncomfortable and
[1:54:38] if Jonah's praise can make a fish
[1:54:40] uncomfortable if us praising God what
[1:54:43] will they do to the devil this morning
[1:54:45] that's it should I do I gotta get rid of
[1:54:48] this guy this guy's driving me crazy and
[1:54:50] he comes up and he opens up his mouth
[1:54:52] and he rolls out his tongue and Jonah
[1:54:54] walks up says repeat the lord spake unto
[1:55:05] the fish the Bible said and it vomited
[1:55:07] Jonah out up on trial and if price could
[1:55:10] deliver you from a whale's belly it can
[1:55:12] deliver you from the gloom and the doom
[1:55:16] where breath tells the sister now go on
[1:55:18] your road now rejoice just start
[1:55:20] praising God and say thank you dear God
[1:55:22] and all that gloomy feeling will be gone
[1:55:26] just hang your gate of praise God likes
[1:55:33] to be worshipped and when you worship
[1:55:36] Him it just isn't exactly singing a song
[1:55:38] as we do but it's singing it in the
[1:55:40] spirit of worship you see then you feel
[1:55:43] the Holy Spirit bounce back you begin to
[1:55:47] worship God you begin to lift it up God
[1:55:49] begins to receive that because Jesus
[1:55:51] told the woman at the well he seeks
[1:55:53] those whom will worship him that's what
[1:55:56] he's looking for this morning he's
[1:55:58] looking for worshipers well as we sing
[1:56:00] that so let the worshiper arise
[1:56:03] that's what he's looking for this
[1:56:05] morning somebody that'll give him praise
[1:56:07] the Prophet said this he said God likes
[1:56:11] to be worshipped by his children then I
[1:56:16] say let's make him happy this is the
[1:56:21] first place if you won't scripture the
[1:56:23] people are supposed to come to the house
[1:56:25] of God for one purpose that is to
[1:56:28] worship to sing songs and to worship God
[1:56:31] that's the way God expects it he does
[1:56:34] inspect us to come to the house of God
[1:56:36] to talk about something else
[1:56:37] or talk about one another or talk about
[1:56:39] what we go to do through the week he
[1:56:42] expects us to come to worship Him
[1:56:43] because it is a house of worship
[1:56:49] and I say to you this morning as we come
[1:56:51] to a close let's not let this just be a
[1:56:54] house of worship but let's this be a
[1:56:58] house of worship
[1:57:02] then as long as I'm in Minnesota as long
[1:57:05] as I'm in Wisconsin as long as I'm in
[1:57:07] Tennessee or Arkansas or whoever as long
[1:57:09] as I'm on this earth the rocks will
[1:57:11] never have to cry out the Bible says
[1:57:17] this praise ye the Lord singing to the
[1:57:20] Lord a new song and his praise in the
[1:57:22] congregation of the Saints man Israel
[1:57:25] rejoice in him that made him let the
[1:57:28] children of Zion be joyful in their king
[1:57:30] let them praise His name is dance
[1:57:34] let them sing praises unto him with the
[1:57:37] timbrel in the harp for the Lord taketh
[1:57:40] pleasure in his people he will beautify
[1:57:43] the meek with salvation let the Saints
[1:57:46] be joyful in glory
[1:57:48] let them sing aloud upon their beds you
[1:57:53] don't just have to worship God in church
[1:57:54] you can worship Him at the red light
[1:57:58] you can worship God or ever your aunt
[1:58:01] because this is a house of worship it's
[1:58:05] not always swinging from the chandeliers
[1:58:07] it's not always screaming to the top of
[1:58:09] your voice but they that worship God
[1:58:12] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:58:14] I remember a few year ago when I worked
[1:58:19] in surgery I just work in surgery 17
[1:58:21] years did thousands of opera assistant
[1:58:23] doctors in surgery and I remember one
[1:58:25] time this man came in he threw a blood
[1:58:27] clot over 90% of his bow was dead he's
[1:58:30] been dead for four days when this guy
[1:58:33] come in he could imagine the smell for
[1:58:36] days of dead Bell we opened the guy up
[1:58:38] the doctors dr. Evans was on the case
[1:58:40] and I was assisting him dr. Evans made a
[1:58:44] comment was going to take all this power
[1:58:46] out so many feet of bowel and we could
[1:58:48] put a little bag on his side and dr.
[1:58:51] Evan said there's no way this man can
[1:58:54] live over 90% of his bowel gone he'll
[1:58:58] have no time and because you know your
[1:58:59] bow absorbs the vitamins and nutrients
[1:59:01] when you eat your food that's where it's
[1:59:02] absorbed at and none of that was there
[1:59:06] so he buck he if he even lived he'd be
[1:59:09] like he was drinking it almost
[1:59:11] immediately come out he said there's no
[1:59:14] way this man can live and I thought you
[1:59:16] know Lord that's true that's true Lord I
[1:59:19] just don't see how the man could live I
[1:59:21] was just saying that just talking to the
[1:59:23] Lord under my breath and all at once God
[1:59:26] is my witness his presence came right
[1:59:28] there where I said and when I felt his
[1:59:31] presence I begin to you know a lot of
[1:59:34] people shouted to me when he comes up on
[1:59:35] me I just weep you know God deals with
[1:59:37] people different ways but to me God's
[1:59:39] always squeezed my heart to juice always
[1:59:41] comes out my eyes that's all I was there
[1:59:44] and I felt his presence and I begin to
[1:59:46] weep and I was turning my head away I
[1:59:47] didn't want the doctor to see me cry and
[1:59:51] if I spoke to me I said is there
[1:59:54] anything too hard for God
[1:59:58] and I just begin to worship him since I
[2:00:01] just begin to praise I said don't god
[2:00:03] there's nothing too hard for you you're
[2:00:05] a god you're the healer you're the
[2:00:08] deliverer of there is nothing that's too
[2:00:10] hard for you you know what the man lived
[2:00:18] about a year and a half later I went
[2:00:20] into the canteen the cafeteria there at
[2:00:22] the VA hospital that's where I worked
[2:00:24] and I we need to get some food and I
[2:00:26] looked at the table
[2:00:28] it was him I'll tell you his name I know
[2:00:32] you don't know him his name was Rufus
[2:00:33] Bunch and I saw him and I went over to
[2:00:37] him I said mister Bunch
[2:00:38] he said yes he didn't know me from Adam
[2:00:42] I said sir you don't know me I said but
[2:00:44] here a few years ago when you came in I
[2:00:46] was on your case and I begin to tell him
[2:00:49] what happened and once again the
[2:00:51] presence of the Lord came right down in
[2:00:53] the cafeteria
[2:00:54] and me and that old man except down at
[2:00:57] that table worshiped God because the Son
[2:01:04] of God can worship God anywhere
