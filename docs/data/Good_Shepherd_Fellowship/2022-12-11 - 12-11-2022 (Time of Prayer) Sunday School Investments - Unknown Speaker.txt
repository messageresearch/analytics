========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this was kind of a surprise to me being here this morning because I was supposed to be leaving the city this morning at six o'clock the gold about 150 miles north from here with some friends and so when they told me asked to be here this morning to speak at the breakfast I kind of had to hurry up and change your program a little it's always a privilege though to be where the people of the Lord is where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered and I'm so happy to be here and to meet all of our friends again on Fellowship you can imagine how I feel standing here with a man who has been preaching the gospel when I was a little bitty fella and um that's taking a long time back and uh but um so thankful to be assembled here with the people and now tonight is another great night we're expecting God to do great things and through this week I've had the privilege of of going up and down through the Maricopa Valley here speaking with the people in their churches and we've had a great time so grateful for is the fellowship and of the Holy Spirit among these people and I am looking forward also to Sunday afternoon when it's my privilege to speak again Sunday afternoon and then Monday night at the banquet now I'm trusting that all that's do being done are said well we'll have a great climax Monday night brother Oral Roberts has been chosen to speak this banquet meeting and we are we want to pray for him I pray that God will give him such a message that will will send Phoenix to his knees of trembling shaking the very presence of God in in the front of the people and uh we are hoping that to come to pass and all along the line everything that's done we trust it at least that's an impression upon Phoenix that there can never be the same and the people who's been here and will go back into their own cities well not go back the way they come out go back uh inspired with a more determination to do the work of the Lord with a new vision from God um here because of a vision and if any of you has ever taken any tapes I'm not a tape salesman of course we have a tate business around the world but if you ever bought a tape from me or not for me but from Mr McGuire he's here somewhere taking tapes this morning I suppose get that one what time is it sir I'm standing in a place so I I don't know the next move I have seen Vision since I was a little boy first thing I can remember in early in life was a vision and I before people from anywhere I asked anybody to tell me one time that one of them ever failed it can't fail it's God therefore this one has me in such a condition till I uh I go to thinking about it and just tears me up and I know something is going to take place and uh I would be afraid just like what I was saying to someone the other day we realize that we don't want to take God and make it just a gimmick now and we don't want to take the gifts of God make gimmicks out of it when you say the Lord said something be sure the Lord told you be not an impression see there's too much of that now you're seeing the people don't know how to have confidence if God says anything it must be just exactly that way it must happen that way that's how we can trust the Bible in the beginning it promised a messiah those Hebrew prophets spoke of the Messiah what he would do that Messiah came just exactly the way it was the Bible on one hand says it'll happen at a certain time it does right on down now we got confidence that there will be a rapture Jesus will be coming amen we're right here because it's never failed anywhere else and it can't fail now that's our confidence like when Jeremiah the Lord had told him put that yoke on his neck no matter what profit or what else said that anything contrary to the 70 years down in Babylon it'd have to be that way that Tina raised up a prophet and a son of a prophet and he took that yolk from Jeremiah's neck and break it and said thus saith the Lord in two years he'll be back he said even the Prophet Jeremiah said amen Hina the Lord perform your words but let us remember there's been prophets before us and when they prophets only no one when he's prophecy comes to pass I think that's a very good Pentecostal lesson we can be impressed be excited and we can have the joy and blessings of the Lord but when we speak in the name of the Lord and if what we speak is exactly with that word you stay away from it I don't care how good it looks for this is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ stay with that word don't you leave it for nothing uh see if Hannan was just a thought that Revelation and I don't believe the man was a hypocrite he was inspired but it didn't compare with the word it's got to be the word and one time it happened again that when Jehovah's come down to visit Ahab and they had a counseling of going up to Ramos Gilead and Jehovah said of course my chariots is yours my people is yours he said but should not we consult the Lord Ahab said certainly we should done that so they had 400 Hebrew Prophets not Balaam prophets not heathens but Hebrew Prophets zedekar came up with two big horns and said thus saith the Lord by this you're going to push Syria Plum out of the country fundamentally he was right but there's more goes with it besides that you can be ever so fundamental right get it the promises of God is based upon a condition that he was keeping their sacrifices Justice Reverend as they could and doing what the Lord told him yet without that sincerity behind it offering us it would become a family tradition that's where we're taking Pentecost a family tradition got to get more sincere in that do you expect God to answer these blessings and promises you come back to the sincerity of that word what the word says stay with it now this Prophet fundamentally was right when God divided up the land that Joshua gave that to Israel and here was the enemies be filling their bellies with the wheat that was raised up at Rhema and fundamentally right but you see it was on conditions and then prophets or ministers prophesying was exactly right then they said to this man of God Jehoshaphat they seem to be something a little contrary he said isn't there one more one more after having 400 what seemed ridiculous but yet way down deep in that man's heart he knows there's something wrong any man of God can see there's something wrong our blessings is fine but it isn't coming up to the mark so he's seen there was something wrong said is there one more said yes or is one more Micah the son of England but said I hate him said he's constantly tearing us up rebuking us he said let not the king say so but let's hear him and so they sent for him to come and they said now you've been kicked out of the association long enough now you can get over here and say something the same way they do and it'll be all right he said as the Lord God Lives I'll say only what he puts on my heart we need Emily again we need Micah rather and they that night he asked to wait on the Lord and when he saw the vision of the Lord then he checked that with the word and when he checked it with the word the word and the vision was the same then he stood before them and told him what would happen and of course you know zedekiah smacked him in the mouth and said which way to the war did the Lord go when he left me the spirit of the Lord when he left me he said you'll see Ahab said put this felony in a prison give him the bread of Sorrow and said then when I return I'll deal with him he said if you return it all the Lord hasn't spoke to me um you see it's got to be with the word happy and we must remember that by the way I I didn't come to see that let's pray let's bow our heads everybody our heavenly father we come this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus and here thou has given to me this morning Lord this fine group of people that I might speak a few words to these businessmen from all over the nation Lord I pray that you will grant this morning that there will be something said that will not be just someone standing here to take up some time or to entertain but the word of the Lord might in some unknown way even to us be brought forth that would do something to help the people it's a great hour heal the sake The Afflicted God we pray that you'll stir the hearts of these businessmen bless the ministers your Believers of all different phases and sections and gifts and offices to where you have place in and may we go this morning with the the same attitude of those who came from he may Ascend did not our hearts burn within us May the Holy Spirit come now and talk to our hearts for the next few minutes through the word granted Lord we asked it in Jesus name amen now to you who just like to take a few notes I jotted down here to kind of remind me I was determined to go somewhere today but it's always the word of the Lord are the opportunities to speak for him comes first we don't know what time we're going to leave this world and we want to put in every Speck of time that we know how now I want to read this morning from Saint Matthew's gospel the 19th Chapter beginning with the 16th verse for just a little uh a text to draw from here as the holy spirit will a context and the whole one came and said unto him good master what good things shall I do that I may inherit eternal life I may have eternal life I want to stop just a moment what good thing could I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why cause thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if I will enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father not mother Thou shalt love thy neighbor as a self the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth what lacketh ah yes Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell what thou has and give to the poor and thou shall have Treasures in Heaven and come follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said Jesus unto the disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter in the Kingdom of Heaven again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God and when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved Jesus said Jesus beheld them and said unto them with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible [Applause] now I would like to draw from this little thing here a context if it would if you will permit me just a few minutes now we can imagine the event and being that this is the businessman's breakfast Saturday morning's regular breakfast I believe and I had the privilege of speaking last Saturday morning which I appreciate this invitation from these fine brethren who lets me come in my illiteracy and before smart and educated people and try to get forth this message that I I feel that our hearts need and I appreciate that when many doors closing swiftly behind so I'm I'm thankful to these men in a certainly a pray that God bless them if I started in the morning I tried to bring a message that would be what I thought was needful I spoke on uh use a car how he was a great man example before Isaiah but when he got lifted up then he tried to take the place of a priest a minister and in doing so God smote him with Leprosy and it was a great lesson to Isaiah to know not to trust in what anything but God then he was in the temple and saw that the place I asked my brethren don't try to take the place of nothing but a businessman whatever God's called you to do don't try to be preachers because we have hard enough time keep it straight anyhow and you get it mixed up so let's just stay what God calls us to be nothing to the laity it's a good thing for us to try to remain don't try to impersonate somebody else be just what you are we'd all like to be a Billy Graham and Oral Roberts would all like to be that but remember in the kingdom of God and his great economy if we'll be the doormat but that's our place we'll be just as much as they are but you must maintain your position and where Christ has placed you I like to speak this morning now on investments not most any good businessman is interested in some good Investments and I chose this because it was businessman we should be interested in Investments and most all people like that Investments and especially at all be outstanding to a group of businessmen and we're always trying to find somewhere to make a few Investments to make a few dollars or and that's all right I have nothing to say against that that's perfectly all right but I speak to you all the very best investment that I know to make an investment very best place rather to make an investment good business are a good businessman knows better than to gamble don't Gamble you're going to lose you can't win gambling you're a Parker one time a rich man an X-Men back of Harper again gambling is a disease it's just an evil spirit and it gets on to people sometime in mile far you can gamble in religion might not know it but you can it's just like if the nation would stop to see you let a drunk man get out you're on the street with the with it with his automobile that man ought to have at least 10 years in prison you let a man go down the street this morning with a with a pistol in his hands shooting around like that they had tore the keys away on that guy they'd sent him to the inner jails and then a drunk man can come down the street he's absolutely just as much in danger killing somebody as a man is with a pistol and he gets five dollars for it he is it's almost premeditated murder but to see the nation don't look at it that way and neither does people sometime when they're gambling little mild Farms are saying oh well I I'm as good as the rest of them that's a Gamel should do that that's poor business any good businessman shouldn't take his money and gambling and some Believers should never uh Gamble or else this is all right I'll take the chance on him you do there's a pattern lay down a definitely faint and it doesn't belong in any certain group of people it's God's word don't gamble on that now don't take chances and another thing I noticed among people sometime especially in uh man get a hold of a little money and then he'll try to invested in some kind of a get rich overnight some are unidentified business you'll lose the shirt off your back and you know that don't you try that and a good sensible thinking businessman won't do that it's somebody who's green at the job or take a chance like that it never pays off or how many cases have I seen in my time where people had their life saving and it gets some little Gadget out get rich overnight real quick and all like this and they got it then the first thing you know they find themselves up on the uh on the skid row or somewhere trying to satisfy other or drown their thoughts of what they've done and that could be applied also in the Realms of Christianity some get rich overnight shake hands to the preacher and put your name on the book it's all over you never believe such stuff as that don't work out it's got to come one way these get rich overnight doesn't a good businessman will Fool with It if you got any anything you want to invest in uh get some identified a business something that's been proven it it keeps it keeps its promise it pays off and here's another thing don't keep your money in your pocket you never get anything somebody steal it from you after a while you don't want to do that Jesus taught the same thing when you got a talent don't don't hide it you gotta put it to use growing I may be talking to Presbyterian Methodist Baptists and these breakfasts and whatever more you never know who's sitting before you see so remember if you got some investment something to invest in invested in something that's good something that's real something that's been proven that'll pay off some good a reliable identified firm that has been proven to pay off in the past it's got a name behind it you may know that even if you have to take a slower coming up your your Dividends are are smaller yet I'd rather know all my money I was drawing two percent and sure to get it and drawing 50.
