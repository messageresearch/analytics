[4:30] but last night was a different just go
[4:34] to sleep because I just it's just
[4:53] amazing

[5:16] already perfect

[5:21] right now and in the state that is not
[5:23] supposed to be but what's working from
[5:26] the inside it's coming through the
[5:28] outside
[5:30] and so that's what's gonna pre that's to
[5:33] perfection the word that comes in us and
[5:36] we're surrounded and we don't see how
[5:41] we're surrounded
[5:43] but there's more witnesses around us
[5:45] than what we know because I remember

[5:51] servant he said sir there's too many of
[5:54] us there's too many of them you know and

[17:59] [Music]
[18:13] [Music]
[18:43] [Applause]
[18:59] hey I want to give you a little
[19:04] testimony of my life what the Lord has
[19:08] been doing in my life sometimes you know
[19:13] you you run as fast as you can
[19:17] sometimes from the Lord but you know
[19:22] it's like when you go fishing and you
[19:25] you got your fish you know it you just
[19:29] if it's a big fish and you're fighting
[19:31] with it you know you just let it run
[19:35] sometimes the Lord is like that with me
[19:38] in my life he he lets me run he lets me
[19:41] run and then all the sudden he just puts
[19:43] the brakes on me and then next thing you
[19:45] know I'm pulling back you know but he
[19:48] always has a way in my life to bring me
[19:52] back to him I not that I don't believe
[19:56] because
[19:57] I don't think nothing can take that from
[20:01] my heart my belief in him and how great
[20:05] of a savior and how He loves us but
[20:08] these past few weeks I was in the
[20:15] hospital for a couple of days and this
[20:21] was the first time I came up here to to
[20:24] delete songs and as we say lo and behold
[20:28] that same night this burning sensation
[20:34] just came on my chest got up about two
[20:37] o'clock in the morning I don't know if I
[20:39] haven't shared this with you or some of
[20:41] you have heard and it's just the burning
[20:48] sensation it was like somebody just put
[20:50] a iron through my chest I got up and I
[20:54] said what what what is this you know
[20:56] usually usually sometimes when I have an
[20:59] experience like that the first thing
[21:01] that comes out of my mouth is am I going
[21:03] home it's a time to go home you know but
[21:07] this time I did not for some reason I
[21:10] just got up and I said what is it you
[21:12] know and there's no pain no no no
[21:15] indication that did my heart was you
[21:19] know giving me trouble and so I just
[21:21] said well let me take two aspirins and
[21:24] go back to bed
[21:25] and that's what I was planning to do to
[21:27] go back to bed and so but I didn't I
[21:33] took the aspirins in the Bernese and
[21:35] said she went away and I said no let me
[21:37] just go to the hospital sure enough the
[21:42] they brought me and they put me in the
[21:44] station and I was waiting they took some
[21:46] blood sample it came back negative
[21:48] because when you supposed to me when you
[21:51] have a heart failure you have an
[21:54] indication that
[21:55] that there's some enzymes they come out
[21:58] from the heart and I think and I think
[22:00] if I'm if I'm not mistaken it's the only
[22:04] organ in the body that sets out those
[22:06] those same signs so you know that
[22:09] something's going on with your heart and
[22:12] so I I just sat there and I said well
[22:17] the first one came out negative in it I
[22:20] put my jacket on and I said well it you
[22:23] know you're holding me too long here I
[22:25] want to go home and I started kind of
[22:28] looking around I my jacket on get ready
[22:30] to go home and and so I saw one of the
[22:33] nurses I asked and that's hey can you
[22:35] tell the doctor everything is okay right
[22:37] well we want to know you want to run
[22:40] another blood sample on you just to make
[22:42] sure so about 4:30 in the morning 5
[22:45] o'clock they came and threw some more
[22:49] blood
[22:52] about 5:30 6 o'clock around there the
[22:58] doctor came in she looked at me you know
[23:02] like I'm ready to go home I told it as
[23:10] well you're not going anywhere the only
[23:13] place you're going is to the third floor
[23:15] you know we found that your heart is
[23:18] something - going on there so sure
[23:21] enough you know I said okay well there'd
[23:25] be his will not mind so but you know
[23:31] it's like sometimes when you try to do
[23:36] something for the Lord you know or the
[23:39] Lord calls you to do something for him
[23:41] the enemy is always there to discourage
[23:45] you and do
[23:47] like brother branham said to give you a
[23:49] punch but you know what he's always
[23:53] there to see us through and he told me
[23:58] through this and I was there Thursday
[24:01] night Friday night Saturday morning I
[24:04] said I want to go because I need to be
[24:06] in church on Sunday and so they did what
[24:09] they had to do with the NGO class when
[24:11] they put a dent in my
[24:15] and then the doctor came in and about 11
[24:19] o'clock in the morning they let me go
[24:22] but you know I want to believe that that
[24:26] was the hand of God who put his he put
[24:30] his hand in my chest because it wasn't I
[24:37] guess it wasn't my time to go home yet
[24:39] and he needed me here and I believe that
[24:44] the last time I had that that that
[24:48] feeling was many years ago when I was
[24:51] out cleaning the cars of when I first
[24:56] got here on a winter cleaning the cars
[24:58] of the brothers and sisters out and my
[25:00] feet were freezing and I said Lord do
[25:05] you know what I'm doing and I was on my
[25:07] feet got hot they're warm frozen right
[25:13] there and then
[25:14] and you know he I think it was him who
[25:18] did that because he knew that something
[25:21] was wrong in my heart all these few
[25:24] weeks I've been asking him to help me
[25:26] with my heart and he did so I just I'm
[25:31] thankful to him and I gave him the glory
[25:33] for what he's done for me you never know
[25:35] how the Lord is gonna do it but he does
[25:38] it and he's faithful so I'm just
[25:42] thankful and grateful to him then I'm
[25:44] still deal with you so you know as we go

[36:35] we are standing on holy ground
[36:41] [Music]
[37:01] yes
[37:12] [Music]
[37:46] now listen to me there when Moses was
[37:53] standing in the present of the burning
[37:55] bush
[37:56] there was nobody being a witness what
[38:00] happened but we believed there today no
[38:06] one took Moses picture Moses never took
[38:10] a selfie but he testified of faith and
[38:17] we believe it praise the Lord
[38:22] and you just think about it when he saw
[38:27] the fire on the mountain realizing there
[38:33] was nobody around the area and he wore
[38:37] clothes
[38:41] the thing that attracted him the leaves
[38:43] of the tree was not burning and he got
[38:49] closing
[38:51] and he kept looking what and then he
[38:54] heard of wars coming out of the mists of
[38:57] the fire
[38:59] Pauline Rosie's Moses I said there to
[39:06] say the other
[39:11] [Music]
[39:14] as we worship the law this morning like
[39:17] I said before just think about everyone
[39:21] around you just like trees just think
[39:25] like you are alone just like Moses in
[39:28] the wilderness
[39:32] and you are attracted to what God is
[39:34] doing what are in your life water in the
[39:38] life of your family or in the life of
[39:40] someone you know
[39:42] and you are just dare and go wash it
[39:46] wrong oh let's sing
[39:58] [Applause]
[40:51] nothing
[41:43] [Music]
[41:56] while the musicians slowly press play
[41:59] you think about it if you were standing
[42:02] in God's presence if you have come in
[42:05] the presence of the intent of one then
[42:07] you are there alone if you had an
[42:11] opportunity for God to be visible to you
[42:13] this morning and you are standing before
[42:16] him what would be that thing so dear to
[42:18] you that you would like to talk to him
[42:21] about what will be their thing so
[42:24] pressing on your heart that you would
[42:27] like to say to me if it is just one word

[48:51] you ever saw any and in presentation a
[48:55] Bible way from Canada or voice of God
[48:58] and you see those people with their
[49:01] spears and the African attire on you
[49:06] know hole in the Bible in their hands
[49:08] but but as a fan eyes were one of the
[49:11] men I was behind their work and not only
[49:15] reaching them he did as much as to put
[49:17] the message in their language so they
[49:22] were working as much as translating in
[49:24] lot of the languages over a thousand
[49:28] year we you know we never got a direct
[49:32] communication so there was there was not
[49:36] a way we cou participating in supporting
[49:41] his home going I know brother Barry
[49:46] Corey works a lot with them I might I
[49:49] might talk to him a little bit to see
[49:50] what is what is going on there but that
[49:52] is what we know for now so we pray that
[49:54] the Lord way was strengthened
[49:56] strengthened you just think about that
[50:00] he was he was so much known in in in
[50:06] Tanzania in the area the last part of
[50:09] his health he started losing his mind
[50:11] and he would just walk out of his house
[50:15] but Bella Williams was telling me there
[50:19] he
[50:19] walk out of his house and he go in the
[50:21] street he don't know where his eye but
[50:23] because people so much know him as a
[50:25] preacher they will hold his hands and
[50:28] bring him back home
[50:30] praise the Lord Amen and he kind of had
[50:38] a factor there his children a little bit
[50:41] in a positive way and in in an emotional
[50:45] way to see their father going through
[50:48] all of them but you see that's what
[50:50] happened when we come to the end of our
[50:53] journey that's the reason why why we
[50:56] have strength and we have our right mind
[51:01] let's do what we can do for the Lord in

[58:48] st. Luke chapter seven
[59:09] same Luke chapter 7
[59:25] let's read from verse 31 and the Lord
[59:34] said we're on to densha our liking the
[59:37] men of this generation and to what a
[59:42] delight
[59:45] they're like unto children sitting in
[59:48] the marketplace and calling one to
[59:52] another and saying we have piped unto
[59:57] you and ye have not danced we have born
[1:00:02] unto you and ye have not we for John the
[1:00:09] Baptist came neither eating bread nor
[1:00:11] drinking wine and yes a he had a devil
[1:00:15] the Son of man has come eat and drinking
[1:00:20] and yes a behold a long term man and one
[1:00:25] Berber a friend of publicans and sinners
[1:00:29] but wisdom is justified in our children
[1:00:34] let's pray together father Lord Jesus we
[1:00:39] just want to pray and ask the Lord you
[1:00:41] bless your word now we commit the rest
[1:00:44] of the service in your hands Jesus name
[1:00:47] we pray amen
[1:00:48] praise the Lord Allah bless you you may
[1:00:51] have you see and I want I want preach on
[1:00:59] them I'll speak on a little talk that I
[1:01:02] tied to a children in the marketplace
[1:01:07] children in the marketplace I believe if
[1:01:10] Jesus was in our day he would say
[1:01:13] children at the Mall of America praise
[1:01:18] the Lord because that's just what he
[1:01:21] tried to do they tried to Jesus I
[1:01:23] compress the marketplace into one Hall
[1:01:25] cover it make it nice
[1:01:27] praise the Lord and he called him more
[1:01:29] but in those days it was marketplace
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:35] it's kind of for a little bit
[1:01:41] attract men when i reading the scripture
[1:01:44] I know I read it maybe two weeks ago on
[1:01:49] what we were speaking about but listen
[1:01:52] to this
[1:01:53] but Branham says believe doubt this and
[1:01:57] he said this he said now Lord has
[1:02:02] children playing in the marketplace as
[1:02:07] we stand and know that you want us to be
[1:02:13] happy and rejoice you said that you that
[1:02:20] your joy might be for for his Lord then
[1:02:25] he was praying this this when when when
[1:02:28] he said this there are children in the
[1:02:32] marketplace as we stand we know that you
[1:02:36] want us to be happy and rejoice
[1:02:38] I believe that's what people take their
[1:02:40] children to the mall for them to be
[1:02:44] happy go on right and see different
[1:02:48] things and God want us to be happy it's
[1:02:53] strange that even our Lord Jesus
[1:02:55] speaking to that generation he could use
[1:02:59] this language and say this generation is
[1:03:03] like children in the marketplace praise
[1:03:07] the Lord and and when you go in the
[1:03:13] marketplace they are just there a lot of
[1:03:15] things children have things there the a
[1:03:19] attracted to and other people also have
[1:03:23] things that the a attracted to but if
[1:03:30] our Lord Jesus who speak to that
[1:03:38] generation concerning the messenger of
[1:03:41] their age praise the law now a major
[1:03:46] thing has happened 400 years Israel
[1:03:52] never had
[1:03:53] and here God sent a man on the scene
[1:03:58] like John recorded in Saint John chapter
[1:04:03] 1 a man sent from God he comes on the
[1:04:10] scene from 9 years or he went into the
[1:04:13] wilderness he spent all his youthful
[1:04:18] days in the wilderness he never had a
[1:04:22] toy to play with
[1:04:25] he facture on his own tallgrass up heard
[1:04:28] and all the different animals now they
[1:04:33] have to make them you know when into
[1:04:35] whatever material they make them rubber
[1:04:37] for the children to play john saw it
[1:04:44] real amen
[1:04:47] when john was playing with lucas he was
[1:04:50] not making it sound he was hearing the
[1:04:52] sound praise the Lord
[1:04:55] when there was a lion around he knew the
[1:04:57] sound he was not making a sound like the
[1:05:01] children made you to praise the Lord
[1:05:07] but he went into the wilderness and at
[1:05:10] 30 years or he came out of the
[1:05:12] wilderness with a message repent the
[1:05:16] kingdom of heaven is a him and he
[1:05:21] sounded his message right there at the
[1:05:26] River Jordan he says he got a vision in
[1:05:36] a wilderness upon whom you see the the
[1:05:40] Holy Spirit discerning a Sedov that
[1:05:43] would be the same one you see behold the
[1:05:45] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:05:47] the world and he introduced the Messiah
[1:05:51] praise the Lord amen
[1:05:54] and after Jesus God into his ministry
[1:06:00] this is what I want us to notice when
[1:06:03] Jesus was making this statement about
[1:06:05] children
[1:06:06] in the marketplace praise the Lord
[1:06:11] because in a marketplace one of the
[1:06:17] thing about children also they don't
[1:06:22] they don't they don't care what it costs
[1:06:24] if you see it they want it children
[1:06:29] don't go and look up price stock and
[1:06:32] sees oh it's expensive they don't do
[1:06:37] that
[1:06:38] you see Papa I want it praise the Lord
[1:06:45] Amen is the older people they look at
[1:06:50] the products a let's go let's go let's
[1:06:51] go praise the Lord because no the child
[1:07:00] would like that thing but I need money
[1:07:02] let's go let's go down there down there
[1:07:05] I see something down it praise the Lord
[1:07:11] children in the marketplace but years a
[1:07:19] year a major junction of time a major
[1:07:28] junction of time word we can say there
[1:07:33] was the beginning of an Exeter we can
[1:07:38] say it was a adjoint of time where God
[1:07:44] was going to take his people from
[1:07:46] Judaism and he was going to bring them
[1:07:51] into the reality of everything that the
[1:07:55] laws and the prophets spoke about yeah
[1:08:00] it was not just creeds and dogmas duels
[1:08:05] and dumb but the Lord was giving
[1:08:10] realizing that the Lord and no man could
[1:08:13] be saved by the law the law was given as
[1:08:16] an expression of God's desire
[1:08:19] God was showing honor the law what he
[1:08:23] want to do and what he will do
[1:08:25] praise the Lord I don't know it looks
[1:08:30] like when I don't eat on a weekend my
[1:08:32] ears reduce so better Jordan had to be
[1:08:38] squeezing it changing it all the time I
[1:08:40] don't know so at this time God I like
[1:08:49] the way that brad bramish ed he says
[1:08:51] right there on river Jordan he said
[1:08:53] heaven and earth in breaks amen
[1:09:01] heaven and earth embrace God was at this
[1:09:05] time about to bring out to fulfill
[1:09:09] because he is the one that is fulfilling
[1:09:12] his law God knew that no man could
[1:09:19] fulfill the law righteously but yet he
[1:09:21] gave them the Lord it was just an
[1:09:24] expression of what was in his mind and
[1:09:26] what he was going to achieve through the
[1:09:29] ages there will be one group of people
[1:09:33] that were playing it out in a type there
[1:09:36] will be another group of people that
[1:09:38] will fulfill it
[1:09:40] praise the Lord amen
[1:09:49] alloys in his holy temple let it EV keep
[1:09:52] silence
[1:09:54] so and at this time the greatest gift
[1:10:02] the Bible says of all men born of woman
[1:10:09] there was none like John the Baptist
[1:10:14] praise the Lord this is the one that God
[1:10:21] proof there even in the womb we can
[1:10:26] receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:32] oh yeah they even in the wall because if
[1:10:38] he did it to one he can do it to others
[1:10:45] praise the Lord
[1:10:48] amen but you see the church word has has
[1:10:52] has corrupt our mind because it's true
[1:10:57] the scripture they're worth or whoever
[1:10:59] it is the prison whoever we all are born
[1:11:02] in sin shipler in iniquity even John the
[1:11:04] Baptist was born in sin schifflet in
[1:11:06] iniquity only our Lord Jesus but yet God
[1:11:11] visited him in his mother womb praise
[1:11:18] the Lord oh my if we learn to pray for
[1:11:24] our babies right from the womb I believe
[1:11:27] God can stay visiting me man
[1:11:29] praise the Lord he can visit them he can
[1:11:31] keep him a man now so at this point of
[1:11:37] time God is bringing the greatest gift
[1:11:40] the laws and the prophets were until
[1:11:43] John but you see just like children when
[1:11:53] you go to the marketplace sometimes they
[1:11:57] only look for what interesting and
[1:12:02] sometime
[1:12:03] the things that interest them has less
[1:12:05] volume amen
[1:12:09] sometimes they have more prize but less
[1:12:12] valuable are we together I want for you
[1:12:17] to follow me now Yura say that God bring
[1:12:21] brought on the earth the greatest gift
[1:12:24] just like in our time but yet the
[1:12:31] children amen the face that they were
[1:12:42] looking at this man standing right on
[1:12:47] the River Jordan he's preaching this guy
[1:12:50] he's too right before Hera man he did
[1:12:54] not even stunner he didn't close his
[1:12:57] eyes he said that you took your
[1:13:00] brother's wife amen he got down to the
[1:13:06] street he met the policeman he said you
[1:13:08] are a curb you take bribe he blasted
[1:13:11] that the tax collectors praise the Lord
[1:13:18] even when a high priest came to his
[1:13:20] meeting he never had no special seat and
[1:13:23] said bishop you said down here I mean he
[1:13:25] take the word of God and he address it
[1:13:27] to them such a gift that was given to
[1:13:34] the word the forerunner of the first
[1:13:38] coming but what were the children
[1:13:42] looking at what were they looking at
[1:13:47] what was the thing that concerning his
[1:13:49] eating and his drinking
[1:13:52] he don't eat he don't drink locusts
[1:13:57] that's all they are looking at the petty
[1:14:01] things even our Lord Jesus when God in
[1:14:06] His Word to Israel the law that you
[1:14:09] suddenly seek will come in his temple
[1:14:15] house are your prophecy
[1:14:17] the Virgin shall conceive his name would
[1:14:21] be called Immanuel Mary God the
[1:14:24] counselor
[1:14:25] they all look for this and they knew
[1:14:28] that it was the Messiah because Moses
[1:14:31] for them the Lord your God will raise up
[1:14:33] a prophet like unto me they saw they
[1:14:37] knew that the Messiah would be a man go
[1:14:40] with Tabernacle in a body but when that
[1:14:44] gift came what were they looking at what
[1:14:48] was the thing that was attracting them
[1:14:51] like children in a marketplace they were
[1:14:55] looking at the things with no value he
[1:15:01] eat with publicans
[1:15:05] he play with seen us but this was the
[1:15:09] man I was going to take the sin of the
[1:15:11] world this was the man I was going to
[1:15:16] reconcile man had back to God it seemed
[1:15:23] that the same thing that is taking place
[1:15:24] in our day when God by his word
[1:15:29] revelation 10-7 promised the risk of a
[1:15:33] ministry that will that will reveal the
[1:15:38] hidden mysteries of God all those loose
[1:15:43] ends that were in the scripture Daniel
[1:15:45] chapter 12 let's look there a little bit
[1:15:48] Daniel chapter 2 earth and sometimes I
[1:15:55] think we come to church and we are like
[1:15:57] children in the marketplace
[1:16:18] are we together that's the age that we
[1:16:23] are living in report values on things I
[1:16:28] mean things of no value have great price
[1:16:31] and the things of much value people put
[1:16:36] no price to it
[1:16:48] praise the Lord
[1:16:50] Daniel chapter 12 are we together glory
[1:16:58] be to God amen now we realize here God
[1:17:08] was revealing to Daniel throughout this
[1:17:11] book and God was dealing with him all
[1:17:13] the things that were concerning the
[1:17:15] Gentile amen
[1:17:25] let's read from verse one and at a time
[1:17:28] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:17:31] the Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:17:33] children of thy people and there shall
[1:17:37] be a time of trouble such as never since
[1:17:41] there was a nation even told at same
[1:17:45] time and at that time thy people shall
[1:17:52] be delivered every one that shall be
[1:17:56] found written in the book and many of
[1:17:59] them shall sleep in the dust of the
[1:18:02] earth and many of them that sleep in the
[1:18:05] dust of the earth shall awake some to
[1:18:07] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:18:10] everlasting damnation and they that be
[1:18:14] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[1:18:17] the firmament and they that turn many to
[1:18:22] righteousness as the Stynes for ever and
[1:18:26] ever but they are all Daniel shut up the
[1:18:30] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:18:36] of the end
[1:18:38] many shall run to and forth and
[1:18:41] knowledge shall increase now ye receive
[1:18:44] God is revealing to down here that
[1:18:47] things concerning the Gentile kid 'm our
[1:18:50] kid embodies revealing to daniel
[1:18:52] throughout this book how he would turn
[1:18:54] to the gentiles and start dealing with
[1:18:56] the gentiles but yet to Daniel he made
[1:18:59] it a secret
[1:19:00] he said Sileo it's a secret because all
[1:19:03] through the ages the God of heaven and
[1:19:06] earth was known as the god of the Jews
[1:19:08] even Jesus said it is in John chapter 4
[1:19:12] salvation is of the Jews because there
[1:19:14] were the people that God started dealing
[1:19:16] with but yet God comes down to down here
[1:19:19] and he revealed to Daniel the different
[1:19:21] Gentile kingdoms through the dreams he
[1:19:24] gave to Nebuchadnezzar from from from
[1:19:27] from the Babylonian Kingdom to the Roman
[1:19:29] Kingdom it was all represented in the
[1:19:31] image he is revealing all of those
[1:19:34] things to Adhamiya and how he would deal
[1:19:37] with the Gentile
[1:19:38] but he's telling down your seal it till
[1:19:42] the time of being praise the Lord Amen
[1:19:51] now see Luke chapter 4 praise the Lord
[1:20:14] see Luke chapter 4 tells us here when
[1:20:17] Jesus came from the wilderness him in
[1:20:26] verse 14 the Bible says and Jesus
[1:20:31] returned in the power of the spirit into
[1:20:36] Galilee and there went out a frame of
[1:20:40] him through all the region around about
[1:20:43] and he taught in your sin against being
[1:20:48] glorified of all any end and he came to
[1:20:52] Nazareth where he had he have been
[1:20:55] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:20:59] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[1:21:03] and stood up to read and there was
[1:21:07] deliver unto him the book of the prophet
[1:21:11] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[1:21:15] he found the place where it is written
[1:21:18] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me as I
[1:21:21] chapter 61 because he have anointed me
[1:21:25] to preach the gospel to the poor and he
[1:21:31] sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach
[1:21:34] deliverance to the capture the
[1:21:36] recovering of the side to the blind to
[1:21:38] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:21:42] preach the acceptable year of the law
[1:21:44] and he closed the book and give it a
[1:21:48] game to the minister and sat down and
[1:21:51] the eyes of all of them that were in the
[1:21:55] synagogue were fasting on him and he
[1:21:59] began to say unto them this day the
[1:22:01] scripture is fulfilled in your ears now
[1:22:04] God told them here to seal the book Amen
[1:22:09] we shall see you the the mystery the
[1:22:13] understanding of these things that I
[1:22:18] would do it will be sealed so our Lord
[1:22:22] Jesus came no wonder what the Jews
[1:22:25] expecting the Messiah
[1:22:27] will now see that he was the messiah why
[1:22:29] because it was a seal book Jesus got
[1:22:34] into the synagogue the minister Han him
[1:22:38] the book
[1:22:39] he opened a book that was healed he went
[1:22:44] to a setting page and he read the Spirit
[1:22:49] of the Lord God is upon me praise the
[1:22:52] Lord and he closed the book and he gave
[1:22:56] it back to the minister a very important
[1:23:00] significance Jesus
[1:23:03] testifying to the Ministry of that day

[1:39:52] first Peter chapter three sorry first
[1:39:57] Peter chapter three verse 18 for Christ
[1:40:05] also have one suffer for seen the just
[1:40:10] for the unjust that he might bring us to
[1:40:14] God being put to death in the flesh but
[1:40:19] quickened by the spirit by which he went
[1:40:24] and preached unto the spirit imprison
[1:40:28] which sometimes were disobedient now
[1:40:30] this scripture kind of a revered to us
[1:40:33] there even Jesus when he was lying in
[1:40:35] the grave he was not a doe he was busy
[1:40:42] there is no Adonis in God the Bible
[1:40:47] shows right from that from the beginning

[1:40:52] created the heaven and the earth chapter
[1:40:54] two the efforts were far far more far
[1:40:57] bad and God said let there be the word

[1:41:01] day the fourth day the fifth day the
[1:41:04] sixth day let us make man in our image
[1:41:08] and the seventh day there was a change

[1:41:43] who do know he will no longer speak but
[1:41:46] man he will speak through the son
[1:41:50] because he was resting in the son that
[1:41:55] is the reason why Adam could give the
[1:41:57] exact name that God wanted for this
[1:42:00] animal there suck name he could placed
[1:42:02] into the exact place because he
[1:42:06] was an amateur golf the dispensation has
[1:42:08] changed so there is no other mess in God
[1:42:14] the structure proven right here

[1:43:51] help you to see even these people all
[1:43:54] our inventors the people that are
[1:43:57] inventing all the things they are mean

[1:44:45] trying to find an entertainment so we
[1:44:47] can be bored and when mind can be either
[1:44:49] we're just doing this and doing that and
[1:44:51] and and they can receive on the
[1:44:54] profiting end amen it knows the note
[1:45:00] that is the spirit of the age press a
[1:45:04] lot if we don't give the people
[1:45:07] entertainment in this age we will have
[1:45:11] we will have a lot of mad people on the
[1:45:13] street
[1:45:17] press a lot so you see even even though
[1:45:21] it's kind of a kind of a blow my mind I
[1:45:24] just thought that you know never even
[1:45:26] knew how big big analyze the video game
[1:45:29] in industry aids not only for kids or
[1:45:33] you say for kids okay they can be done
[1:45:35] entertainment for the but when you see
[1:45:36] the adults that are in it
[1:45:39] praise the Lord and I mean they are so
[1:45:43] connected around the world somebody in
[1:45:44] Japan on a game with this other person
[1:45:47] and I mean all of that you know and
[1:45:50] those things don't grow of the earth
[1:45:52] it's made that thinking they're not
[1:45:58] sleeping they are thinking I mean the
[1:46:05] social media what was same so to be on
[1:46:09] it in and out of there were men that
[1:46:11] taught that if we create this app it
[1:46:16] will make the world a global village and
[1:46:18] people can be sharing and there I mean
[1:46:20] they have turned to whatever people are
[1:46:21] making of praise the Lord
[1:46:28] but do you realize that even science
[1:46:31] testify we have not gone over 10% of the
[1:46:37] potential of our brain with all the if
[1:46:40] all the things that man has invented the
[1:46:45] actual potential of the human brain or
[1:46:49] the nuclear bomb and all the things that
[1:46:52] they have it's just like God saying to
[1:46:56] Daniel c8 man has the ability just like
[1:47:02] Adam Wars like this tree leave from here
[1:47:04] and come on this place but when man felt
[1:47:07] God's to you it praise the Lord Amen God
[1:47:13] pay the tide and just give you 10% just
[1:47:17] use temple sing Amen glory be to God
[1:47:27] that's the reason why the takes man that
[1:47:30] God raised to satisfy our special fears
[1:47:33] and a man that I walk with God to step
[1:47:36] behind that I get into the realm of the
[1:47:38] super sense and that's what he's calling
[1:47:41] us when he said come up higher praise
[1:47:45] the Lord
[1:47:46] come up higher that's one of the thing
[1:47:52] that is killing the age that we live in
[1:47:55] glory be to God oneness of unity he says
[1:48:02] but when you are really born honor the
[1:48:04] wings of the Grace and power you will
[1:48:08] agree with every word that he said is
[1:48:10] truth and when God moves in the
[1:48:13] supernatural your heart with hunger
[1:48:17] right to it amen
[1:48:23] he will say god be praised forever you
[1:48:28] will be fill you can't stay empty empty
[1:48:36] just feeling empty
[1:48:39] you just feeling empty but if you are
[1:48:44] filling yourself with the Word of God if
[1:48:47] you keep drinking from the fountain of
[1:48:49] life amen
[1:48:51] you keep drinking from the fountain of
[1:48:53] life and you take that little verse in
[1:48:55] the Bible and you think about it every
[1:48:57] day then you try to meditate upon it all
[1:49:01] you need is just to break into a China
[1:49:05] praise the Lord for my goodness
[1:49:08] then the word stop becoming like a honey
[1:49:13] every simple things you see you remember
[1:49:15] that's the scripture in the Bible that
[1:49:17] says it then there is that hunger there
[1:49:20] is something in you that want to find it
[1:49:24] praise the Lord
[1:49:25] then bread is shown you you I mean you
[1:49:27] find yourself looking at scriptures and
[1:49:29] looking at code and I mean you're just
[1:49:31] like a preacher you preaching to
[1:49:33] yourself in the word it's just bubbling
[1:49:35] in you ish that is suffering from sleep
[1:49:49] apnea people can't sleep stay on your
[1:49:52] phone what are you doing because the
[1:49:57] other nothing creative they are doing I
[1:50:02] mean they're not they're not building
[1:50:06] something to help themselves neither to
[1:50:07] help somebody if your life is not
[1:50:14] helping yourself or having somebody you
[1:50:16] have a boring life no matter how much
[1:50:22] you think you are busy you are one of
[1:50:25] the most other men on the earth that's
[1:50:32] what matter with the comfort today as
[1:50:35] soon as you get converted you still
[1:50:39] gathering around you ought to be over
[1:50:43] there on your knees seeking God for the
[1:50:45] bastion of the Holy Ghost to be filled
[1:50:48] up then you have got the walls
[1:50:53] his blessed presence with you and then
[1:50:56] when the enemy comes in like a he comes
[1:50:58] in like the lion in the game that night
[1:51:02] with Daniel the light of God shines out
[1:51:05] and get around you if the good man of
[1:51:11] the house

[1:52:56] our age people have not seen the value
[1:53:02] of the gift of God to know that God
[1:53:04] promised in this age to reveal the
[1:53:07] mysteries the secret mistress from the
[1:53:13] foundation of the world to restore our
[1:53:15] hearts back to the house of the father
[1:53:18] where men walk once again with coming
[1:53:21] contact with God praise the Lord we will
[1:53:25] not just be conforming ourselves to

[1:56:49] and I was just thinking about it I say
[1:56:52] young people that you had the grace of
[1:56:54] God on your side don't abuse this body
[1:57:00] don't abuse this body if you don't have
[1:57:03] nothing to do go to sleep
[1:57:07] sleep is good for your body if you don't
[1:57:12] have nothing to do go to sleep put the
[1:57:14] pillow over your head
[1:57:19] you're laughing what we get into it you
[1:57:22] will see what I'm talking about
[1:57:23] the Bible says he gave his beloved sleep
[1:57:26] and I've been thinking over that
[1:57:29] scripture and I tried to study it what
[1:57:32] is in sleep that God gave Genesis
[1:57:37] chapter 1 now watch this now
[1:57:39] thus the scripture says he put out on on
[1:57:42] the earth the only time that God will
[1:57:44] mention sleep right from the beginning
[1:57:48] was when he was bringing out the woman
[1:57:53] praise the Lord he put Adam to deep
[1:57:56] sleep Genesis chapter 15 when God was
[1:58:00] confirming the coveting of redemption to
[1:58:03] Abraham he put Abraham to deep sleep
[1:58:08] sleep is good for you deep sleep we're
[1:58:17] not we're not talking about that one
[1:58:19] let's leave that one yet let's deal with
[1:58:21] this Adonis amen
[1:58:24] it's not bad to be children in the
[1:58:27] marketplace but it's bad when we lose
[1:58:31] our focus when we lose the interact that
[1:58:35] the things that are interesting the
[1:58:37] thing that God is waiting to our eyes in
[1:58:39] a message spiritual a ministry he says
[1:58:42] this is just like a little trying I mean
[1:58:46] he said God has waived God has risk of
[1:58:50] men that had reigned through the ages
[1:58:52] with healing ministry God has raised up
[1:58:57] preachers there were men now what we
[1:59:03] have in this age preachers that are
[1:59:06] there to abuse the people but there were
[1:59:08] men that was so passion for soul to be
[1:59:11] safe
[1:59:13] God has wave gifts before our age
[1:59:20] the owner is where once again what
[1:59:24] happened in Genesis chapter 18 return
[1:59:27] back on the scene with God turning his
[1:59:29] back to the congregation and God will do
[1:59:31] that in our generation we're listening
[1:59:35] to those things on tapes do they grab
[1:59:37] our attention
[1:59:39] I will impress by 8 and we impress do we
[1:59:45] pop rise to it or it just something they
[1:59:51] have become a slogan children in a
[1:59:56] marketplace the thing that God has put
[2:00:01] on display for us praise the Lord
[2:00:06] men has preached through other ages
[2:00:09] there has never been an age where God
[2:00:12] has rightly defined the fight for
[2:00:14] ministry and their work in the body
[2:00:17] there has never been an age where God
[2:00:19] has rightly defined the gifts 9
[2:00:22] spiritual gifts and their work in the
[2:00:24] body and God has put those things on
[2:00:34] display for us until Paul says desire
[2:00:40] spiritual gifts desire spiritual gift
[2:00:45] desire to see vision desire it they
[2:00:49] become a desire young people desire to
[2:00:56] play music desire to do something for
[2:01:01] God go have things on display when you
[2:01:07] go to marketplace that's what happened
[2:01:09] teens are on display so you can see it
[2:01:20] I mean the hardness are just taking the
[2:01:25] mind of the people until we think there
[2:01:30] are things just for special kind of for
[2:01:32] people they are all for God's children
[2:01:35] brother branham said Lord as children
[2:01:38] playing in a marketplace with thing and
[2:01:43] know that you want us to be happy
[2:01:49] God want you to be happy that he's so
[2:01:53] anxious to give you the Holy Ghost then
[2:01:56] even you desire to have it he want to
[2:02:01] take you away from all your stress and
[2:02:03] worry and bring you to a place where you
[2:02:05] can trust God and know that this God is
[2:02:09] real he want you to be happy that's what
[2:02:15] we take our children to the marketplace
[2:02:17] for them to be happy
[2:02:19] buy them some gifts and that's the very
[2:02:23] same thing that God want to do to you he
[2:02:29] just don't want you to be a benchwarmer
[2:02:33] or just don't want you to be just an
[2:02:37] associate he want you to be a son a
[2:02:42] daughter they have the right to
[2:02:46] everything the father have praise the
[2:02:51] Lord
[2:02:52] just like I said children don't ask
[2:02:54] their parents how much money in your
[2:02:55] bank account
[2:02:59] brother Branham says God can never be as
[2:03:01] austere why are we afraid he said acts
[2:03:05] for big things
[2:03:07] ask for big things you have not because
[2:03:10] you ask Matt praise the Lord but you
[2:03:18] also have to remember this is not a
[2:03:19] wasteful father he's not a wasteful
[2:03:24] father he would do you sometimes like
[2:03:26] the prodigal son he would trust you with
[2:03:28] something and allow you to go out
[2:03:32] I see what you would do with him if you
[2:03:36] waste it he's still willing to forgive
[2:03:38] you if you can only recognize and come
[2:03:41] back home but that's what the father
[2:03:44] does he has gift he has wealth that he
[2:03:50] want to trust you with that's a young
[2:03:53] woman I say young man praise the Lord
[2:04:02] if we only change our vision and start
[2:04:09] looking at the thing of interest praise
[2:04:13] the Lord
