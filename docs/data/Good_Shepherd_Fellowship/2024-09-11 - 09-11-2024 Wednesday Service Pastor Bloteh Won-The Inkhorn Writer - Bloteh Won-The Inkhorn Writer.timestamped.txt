[34:05] to find a
[34:06] way to
[34:10] uh to be blessed in your chamber as you
[34:14] study praise the Lord I'll tell you I
[34:16] will tell you just how much I I thought
[34:18] about I thought about 911 today I don't
[34:22] know if I've if I've had a privilege to
[34:25] to have a service on the on the night of
[34:27] 9 11 so I was thinking I was thinking as
[34:31] is uh uh how can I preach on
[34:34] 911 I thought about brother Brandon
[34:37] talking about uh
[34:40] uh uh Peter harber and uh I just it just
[34:45] couldn't fit into my inspiration or fit
[34:47] into my thought for the message so as I
[34:51] was as I was just thinking about it I
[34:54] thought okay even if I can't preach on
[34:56] 911 I'm going to look for uh the ninth
[35:00] chapter in the
[35:01] Bible with uh with a uh uh with with
[35:07] chapter 9 verse 11 that will bring uh a
[35:11] good sense to the evening so Ezekiel
[35:14] chapter
[35:15] 9 and it turned out that Ezekiel chapter
[35:18] 9 has only 11
[35:21] verses praise the
[35:23] Lord amen it turned out that Ezekiel
[35:26] chapter 9 has only 11
[35:33] verses so tonight I want to speak on a
[35:36] little
[35:37] talk that I I
[35:40] entitled The Ink honn
[35:44] writer the ink honn
[35:48] writer the ink honn
[35:51] writer Ezekiel chapter
[35:54] 99 we know how this chapter is very
[35:57] famous
[35:58] uh because uh we have been reminded over
[36:02] and over
[36:04] how
[36:07] uh them their sight and cry for the
[36:10] Abomination that was done in the city
[36:12] they were
[36:13] sealed that evening so let's just read a
[36:17] little bit here chapter n he cried
[36:22] also in my ears with a loud voice saying
[36:25] cause them that have have charged over
[36:28] the city to draw n even every man with
[36:33] his destroying weapon in his hands I
[36:37] follow that a little bit those that have
[36:39] charge over the city those that have
[36:42] charge they they have a they have a duty
[36:46] uh either either to protect or to punish
[36:51] those that have charge over the city and
[36:53] behold six men came from the way of the
[36:57] higher gate which lie towards the North
[37:02] and every man with slaughtering weapons
[37:06] in his hand six that's the number of
[37:09] men every man with slaughtering weapon
[37:11] in his hand and one man among them was
[37:15] clothed in
[37:17] laning with a writer ink

[39:42] have but let's go ahead tonight and what
[39:45] we wanted to pick up uh uh right there
[39:49] in in First Peter is where Peter talks
[39:52] about uh you know uh if the righteous
[39:55] will be scarcely saved that's why we
[39:56] wanted to pickup judgment begin in the
[39:59] house of the Lord and uh that's what we
[40:02] wanted to read there in uh first
[40:05] Peter praise the Lord so uh uh and also
[40:10] this this weekend we will be gone and uh
[40:12] we'll be be preaching for brother
[40:14] Jordan's father uh uh Friday night and

[40:23] prayer praise the Lord uh sister s
[40:26] myself would be gone but Dan will speak
[40:29] for us on Sunday night so I mean on
[40:31] Sunday morning so you keep him in prayer
[40:33] as well praise the
[40:36] Lord now so uh we want to talk about
[40:39] this in hon Rider
[40:42] year and uh uh just just I mean just
[40:47] looking at uh uh you know the the time
[40:51] that uh is upon us the time that we are
[40:54] living in you know uh as just like I
[40:58] said as the contct remember what
[41:01] happened uh uh you know
[41:04] uh uh September 11
[41:09] 2021 we want to remind ourself we want
[41:13] to remind ourself as Believers we want
[41:15] to remind ourself that uh uh we are
[41:20] living in an hour where the Bible says
[41:23] that uh Darkness will be upon the Earth
[41:26] and grow Darkness Ness upon the people
[41:29] praise the lord we are living in an hour
[41:31] where Zachariah spoke about when he said
[41:34] that uh you know well in the evening
[41:37] time there shall be light we are living
[41:39] in a time where you know this is
[41:42] prophesied about uh where the Judgment
[41:45] of God will be upon the Earth praise the
[41:48] Lord amen Paul speaks about that in the
[41:53] Book of Romans you know when the way we
[41:55] seeing the you know the the the
[41:57] generation is going the people are going
[42:00] crazy and you know uh uh uh uh Paul
[42:04] bring out something in the Book of
[42:05] Romans where he says that uh God will
[42:08] pour out his raft Upon A people that
[42:13] would not acknowledge Him as the
[42:16] Creator now you have to realize that
[42:20] Redemption is only to the
[42:22] El amen Redemption is only to the El but
[42:27] God is the creator of the universe so he
[42:32] must have a way to witness to people
[42:36] that are not his
[42:38] elect praise the Lord so that's the
[42:41] reason why the heavens declare the glory
[42:44] of God the Earth shows his
[42:47] handwork praise the Lord so you see
[42:50] that's why Paul said that in Romans
[42:52] chapter 1 that even the the the the
[42:56] invisible things of God are made known
[43:00] by the things that we do
[43:02] see praise the Lord now so he says if if
[43:07] if uh if if men will see the handed work
[43:11] of God if they will see if men cannot be
[43:14] able to tell that there is an
[43:16] intelligence behind the rising of the
[43:19] Sun and and the changing of the weather
[43:22] you know uh and and and everything that
[43:24] we have around us you know if man will
[43:27] not be able to
[43:29] acknowledge God as the creator of the
[43:33] universe praise the Lord he says the
[43:37] wrath of God is going to come upon those
[43:41] people praise the Lord and in the way
[43:44] that God will P his judgment on the on
[43:49] that generation will be in the way where
[43:52] he will make them to do things like they
[43:55] are crazy
[43:57] amen they will abuse
[44:00] thems they will change their forms they
[44:03] will change their
[44:08] gender that's exactly what Paul
[44:10] addressed that in Romans chapter 1 so
[44:13] when we see all of these things around
[44:15] us just like we said on on Sunday it
[44:19] must not throw us off we must realize
[44:21] that we we are we are ined out of
[44:24] judgment it's almost just like uh I
[44:27] believe that uh uh uh uh the children of
[44:30] Israel there in the land of Gan they
[44:32] were hearing the yelling and the crying
[44:36] from the land of
[44:38] Egypt praise the Lord amen and then and
[44:43] and and I mean some of those boys knew
[44:46] the the first born that were dead in
[44:51] Egypt the knew that when Moses came back
[44:55] and and and and and commanded the the
[44:57] children of Israel to put the blood on
[44:59] on on the door post and told them the
[45:01] death angel will pass tonight he's going
[45:04] to visit the Egypt and and and and he
[45:06] will he was he would kill all their
[45:09] firstborn praise the Lord it was a
[45:12] serious issue I believe fathers came
[45:15] back they set their family down the the
[45:18] the they rehears brother said in talking
[45:20] he said the firstborn will come to the
[45:22] daddy and say Daddy are you sure the
[45:25] blood is applying
[45:27] yeah are you sure that you put the blood
[45:30] on the Len of the door post because he
[45:33] knew that if it was not there he will
[45:36] also
[45:37] die praise the Lord
[45:41] amen you see when uh when when when this
[45:45] manifestation is
[45:48] happening even the
[45:52] Egyptians they were crying to Pharaoh
[45:54] let the people go they could see that
[45:57] this this this is not a magic trick they
[46:00] could see that this was the hand of
[46:04] God praise the Lord amen a lot of the
[46:07] things that is happening around us is
[46:10] the hand of
[46:12] God praise the
[46:14] Lord
[46:16] amen even the coldness and uh and the
[46:19] backsliding and uh and uh uh and the
[46:22] division and people turning away from
[46:25] the message is the hand of God because
[46:27] the word of God said
[46:29] it it's the hour that we are living
[46:32] because the word of God said
[46:40] it praise the
[46:42] Lord but we want to remind ourself

[47:22] you put a mark you make an impression
[47:28] the word of God makes must make an
[47:31] impression on our
[47:35] heart praise the Lord the word might
[47:38] affect

[48:48] then we will go go on tonight he says
[48:51] now watch the prophet in the spirit he's
[48:53] talking about Ezekiel now now wash the
[48:57] prophet in the spirit taken up into
[49:00] glory and God said I'm going to show you
[49:05] how I'm going to settle it with the
[49:09] Jews before coming to the Gentiles now
[49:13] so God was showing Ezekiel here how he's
[49:16] going to close this whole thing up with
[49:18] the
[49:20] Jews amen because there was a gentile
[49:24] people that he had to call out for his
[49:26] his name
[49:28] sake praise the Lord because brother
[49:31] Braham told us that this prophecy of
[49:33] Ezekiel chapter 9 actually took place at
[49:37] the destruction of
[49:39] Jerusalem when when when when uh Titus
[49:42] the Roman general captured the city that
[49:44] was when Ezekiel 9 actually
[49:50] fulfilled praise the Lord amen

[49:58] was the Lord Jesus Christ that was
[50:00] already that was already on the earth

[50:07] word writing on their heart and giving
[50:10] them a promise
[50:11] T until you are endu with power and he
[50:15] says that there when you flee to the
[50:16] mountain don't come back and brother B
[50:19] says every one of them that hear his
[50:21] word they escape the judgment
[50:26] why because the Inon
[50:29] rather word impresses their heart he put
[50:33] a mark on
[50:34] them are we together that was the
[50:38] physical that was the ler fulfillment of
[50:41] Ezekiel chapter 9 but let's look at this
[50:44] to together yeah just follow me now as
[50:47] we as we as we read and and fellowship
[50:51] together I'm going to show you how I'm
[50:53] going to settle it with the Jews before
[50:55] the coming of the any time read the
[50:57] verse or the chapter before
[51:02] it read the chapter before Ezekiel 9
[51:07] that's what we want to do
[51:09] tonight praise the Lord because you see
[51:12] what is happening
[51:15] here this is going to give us a picture
[51:18] to show how the
[51:21] glory how the shakana glory that came
[51:25] down in the Temple of Solomon That Glory
[51:29] that filled the place that even the
[51:31] preacher couldn't have a place to
[51:35] speak how the glory
[51:39] departed if you go go back in in chapter
[51:43] 8 you will see
[51:45] literally how the glory departed and is
[51:48] a
[51:51] type for us
[51:57] how the glory is departing from
[52:04] people let's go back and and then we
[52:06] will study a little bit there so let's
[52:09] go back and read the chapter before it
[52:12] chapter 8 let's go to chapter
[52:14] 8 praise the
[52:17] Lord
[52:23] amen Ezekiel chapter 8 we can you can
[52:26] fall back like that when you when you
[52:27] get home and you know you can read uh
[52:30] the entire chapter but
[52:32] uh
[52:35] uh from verse one and it came to pass in
[52:39] the sixth year in the sixth month in the
[52:42] fifth day of the month I sat in my house
[52:47] and the Elders of Judah sat before me
[52:50] that the hand of the Lord
[52:53] fell there upon me praise the Lord now
[52:59] we are going to read a scenario
[53:02] word Ezekiel is sitting with the Elders
[53:06] of
[53:08] Israel and he's going to be
[53:13] transported now you will see the example
[53:17] that we talk about of Revelation chapter
[53:20] 4 when the angel told John come up
[53:22] higher I will show you
[53:25] things amen
[53:28] praise the Lord so he say he's sitting
[53:31] down there and the the others of of of
[53:33] of Judah are sitting before him and he
[53:36] said that the hand of the hand of the
[53:39] Lord God fell dead upon me then I beheld
[53:43] and low the likeness as the appearance
[53:46] of fire from the appearance of his Lans
[53:50] even downward fire and from his Leon
[53:54] even upward as the appearance of of
[53:56] brightness as the color of
[54:00] amber that same pillow of
[54:05] fire that was taken over brother bram's
[54:08] head amber color light so he said he's
[54:11] sitting there and what he's seeing there
[54:13] is that he start to see a man he's
[54:16] seeing a
[54:18] being there from the upper
[54:22] part it's a fire like but with Amber C
[54:26] amen
[54:31] amen and he put
[54:36] forth and he put forth the form of a
[54:39] hand and took
[54:42] me by a lock of my hand and the spirit
[54:47] lifted me up between the Earth and the
[54:53] heavens and brought me in the vision of
[54:58] God to
[54:59] Jerusalem to the
[55:02] door of the inner
[55:05] gate are we
[55:10] together
[55:12] where where was the seat of the image of
[55:17] jealousy which provoked to
[55:20] jealousy now you have to realize that
[55:23] after the time of Manet he brought
[55:26] Israel in such a time of idol
[55:31] worship praise the Lord he polluted the
[55:35] land with idol worship until just like
[55:38] our age that we day and age that we are
[55:41] living in we worship brain name we
[55:43] worship uh uh uh I mean uh
[55:47] everything everything that's the spirit
[55:50] of the
[55:52] age the way we get excited and the
[55:54] energy that we that that that this age
[55:57] have uh to to all the different things
[56:01] if if if a portion of that was put
[56:03] before behind the name of
[56:06] God the church will be a step higher
[56:09] than where we
[56:11] are praise the Lord
[56:17] amen the image of
[56:21] jealousy just meaning that this was
[56:25] something that
[56:27] was replacing God to the people remember
[56:31] he says I'm a jealous God don't have no
[56:34] graving
[56:36] image and here Ezekiel is transported in
[56:39] the spirit and he's brought right right
[56:42] to the beginning the entrance of the
[56:46] city idolatry started right from the
[56:49] entrance of the
[56:50] city I was doing some uh study on the
[56:54] Statue of Liberty I don't I want to get
[56:56] into that tonight
[56:58] but that's one of the first thing when
[57:01] you fly in the US you see but let's go
[57:04] on are we together amen right from the
[57:09] entrance of the setting an image of
[57:11] jealousy which Pro which provoketh to
[57:13] jealousy and behold the glory of go the
[57:17] glory of the god of Israel was there I
[57:20] calling to the vision that I
[57:22] saw in the plane then said he unto me
[57:25] some son of man lift up th eyes now and
[57:30] wait towards the N so I lifted up my
[57:32] eyes and wa towards the North and behold
[57:36] north wall the Gate of the
[57:41] altar this image of jealousy in the
[57:47] entry and he said furthermore unto me
[57:50] son of man see where there what they
[57:53] do even the Great
[57:57] Abomination that the house of Israel
[57:59] committed here that I should go far off

[58:14] Abomination that my that my uh uh my
[58:17] exit of people my redeemed people
[58:21] because of the great
[58:24] Abomination I'm bringing you to see see
[58:26] why my spirit is going to
[58:30] leave why my glory is going to leave the
[58:34] people will have a form of
[58:37] godliness they will have a
[58:44] form they will call themselves different
[58:47] names but my glory is not
[58:50] there are we
[58:53] together now he's bringing he's bringing
[58:56] Ezekiel inovision just imagine he's

[1:01:56] now remember now in Prophecy brother
[1:01:58] Brown says God this is giving us a
[1:02:01] picture how God is going to close the
[1:02:04] Gentile book to turn I mean the Jewish
[1:02:07] book to turn to the
[1:02:13] Gentiles the prop God said uh uh uh uh
[1:02:16] uh uh beginning ending of GTI
[1:02:19] dispensation you know where it begins
[1:02:21] with an idol worship it will go out with
[1:02:23] the same
[1:02:26] praise the Lord
[1:02:28] amen like we said before idolatry has
[1:02:31] been something that haunted the church
[1:02:34] right from the beginning God brought our
[1:02:36] father uh uh Abraham out of the house of
[1:02:39] idol
[1:02:41] worship praise the
[1:02:43] Lord Jacob was leaving with his wife uh
[1:02:47] Rachel and Leah she stole her father
[1:02:52] Idol and if there is one thing that is
[1:02:55] him in the church is all the idols that
[1:02:58] we are holding
[1:03:00] to in our mind in our spirit some people
[1:03:07] that I mean they worship certain form of
[1:03:11] teachings that they cannot go no farther
[1:03:14] than
[1:03:15] that when a person has has sat on a
[1:03:18] legalistic preaching so long
[1:03:26] sometimes it can be a form of
[1:03:33] worship you cannot meet up with that you
[1:03:35] condemn yourself you see other people
[1:03:37] you condemn also you condemn them what
[1:03:41] is happening because in your mind this
[1:03:44] is what the message
[1:03:52] is like some will say I mean I mean when
[1:03:54] you go to a message Church there a way
[1:03:56] we should be able to identify it well
[1:03:58] how should we identify a message Church
[1:04:00] a message Church Must Be identified by
[1:04:02] the message of the hour and the spirit
[1:04:05] of God Among the
[1:04:07] people that's how we must identify the
[1:04:09] message
[1:04:12] Church Let It Be identified by the
[1:04:15] message of the hour the word of God that
[1:04:17] is preached and the spirit of God that
[1:04:19] is among the people am
[1:04:30] are we
[1:04:36] together now he's bringing all of these
[1:04:39] things and showing Ezekiel all of these
[1:04:43] creeping things and abominable beasts
[1:04:46] you know and and Idols you know you find
[1:04:48] it in the people
[1:04:50] homes they said look in their homes
[1:04:59] but here here is the thing the people
[1:05:01] are going to the
[1:05:03] temple the priests are going to the
[1:05:06] temple when it is time to worship they
[1:05:09] all gather to
[1:05:11] worship but their spirit and their mind
[1:05:14] is all caught up in
[1:05:20] idolatry that the worship of God is just
[1:05:23] a form we want to get there quick we
[1:05:26] want to get out of there because we get
[1:05:29] better things to
[1:05:35] do are we together amen don't worry I
[1:05:39] won't keep you all night tonight
[1:05:43] amen it's just that we have we have to
[1:05:45] wake up
[1:05:47] ourself we have to wake up ourself just
[1:05:50] like I said
[1:05:52] because the in home Rider
[1:05:56] is in every
[1:05:58] service praise the Lord the inor rider
[1:06:01] is in every
[1:06:04] service and he want to seal
[1:06:07] you praise the Lord and the Seal of the
[1:06:10] Holy Ghost is to seal out every form of
[1:06:20] adolat the only thing we worship is the
[1:06:23] word the word must have the
[1:06:26] preeminence we must bring it back to the
[1:06:36] word
[1:06:43] now in the vision verse 11 there stood
[1:06:46] before them 70 men of the Asians of the
[1:06:49] House of Israel in the mid to
[1:06:53] there the ERS
[1:06:57] God is taking Ezekiel in a vision seeing
[1:07:00] the
[1:07:01] elders the
[1:07:05] men what is happening to our churches
[1:07:08] all the men are
[1:07:11] gone all the men are gone lishia Church
[1:07:14] age is filled with
[1:07:18] women you find more women than the men
[1:07:21] they are all
[1:07:23] gone they can never rise up to the the
[1:07:25] place to become deacons to become
[1:07:27] leaders they
[1:07:30] canot it's a
[1:07:32] dysfunction in the way that God
[1:07:36] structure in God's structure because the
[1:07:39] enemy knows these are the people that
[1:07:41] supposed to be the leaders that's right
[1:07:44] if we can WEP them away then we don't
[1:07:47] have
[1:07:49] leaders praise the Lord but yet they are
[1:07:52] the ones that can come sit down and
[1:07:53] argue they come and F
[1:07:56] they are
[1:08:01] oldtimers praise the Lord
[1:08:06] amen that's the thing that is happening
[1:08:08] to our societies men they are all
[1:08:10] slacking on their
[1:08:23] responsibility the he
[1:08:26] the Asians are all caught up in
[1:08:28] adolat the land is
[1:08:34] vulnerable oh that's not the worst here
[1:08:36] you will see the worst because Ezekiel
[1:08:38] said there is more abominable things the
[1:08:41] angel to him more abominable things I
[1:08:43] Will Show You Follow Me You Love the
[1:08:47] Lord that's that's what the prophet to
[1:08:49] us to do he said read a chapter before
[1:08:52] that's what we are doing
[1:08:55] praise the Lord
[1:08:58] amen hallelujah verse 12 then then said
[1:09:02] he unto me Son of God have thou seen

[1:09:19] in their little closet their little they
[1:09:21] having their little Idol

[1:09:29] be better than the next
[1:09:34] man when these are the when these are
[1:09:36] the men that's supposed to be holding
[1:09:39] the Tabernacle
[1:09:48] together praise the Lord
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:10:04] every man in the chamber of his imagry
[1:10:07] for they said the Lord Sear us
[1:10:10] not the Lord has forsaken the
[1:10:14] Earth but yet these are the same people

[1:10:31] in this Tabernacle long time my my
[1:10:33] grandfather was in this Tabernacle one
[1:10:35] time but back there in his mind God has
[1:10:38] forsaken the
[1:10:41] Earth having the form of godliness
[1:10:43] denying the power of
[1:10:54] God if the spirit of judgment is on the
[1:10:56] earth that's the very same thing that is
[1:10:58] happening and that's the very same thing
[1:11:00] that is happening around our message
[1:11:04] churches and then we want to complain we
[1:11:06] can't see the power of God what what
[1:11:08] brother the power of God is still here
[1:11:09] because the man with the with the ink

[1:19:23] hell the position position of the church
[1:19:25] the position of the
[1:19:27] believer is to be in a place of
[1:19:33] influence is to be in the place of
[1:19:35] influence and it's not because we
[1:19:37] believe brother Brandon what we baptize
[1:19:39] in Jesus name you got to keep
[1:19:43] yourself a
[1:19:45] life of
[1:19:48] consecration praise the Lord you got to
[1:19:51] be truth to God in your heart
[1:19:55] there's no time to play religion no time

[1:20:02] church praise the Lord the inong rer
[1:20:05] comes all the time to seal us with the

[1:20:23] hold of it embrace th word and say Lord
[1:20:25] you spoke to me deal with me change my
[1:20:37] life therefore where I
[1:20:39] deal for then my eyes shall not spare
[1:20:42] neither will I have
[1:20:44] pity and D the cry my
[1:20:48] ears though the
[1:20:50] cry in my ears with a loud voice yet
[1:20:54] will I not hear
[1:20:58] them praise the Lord amen what is what
[1:21:01] what is the church word on oh let's just

[1:21:27] and here's these people you're defiling
[1:21:29] the
[1:21:31] temple can you imagine you just think
[1:21:33] about it like brother BR says he said
[1:21:35] just passing the other days I saw the
[1:21:37] pastor and all the men in the church
[1:21:38] standing at the backside smoking
[1:21:40] cigarette to smoke and then when they
[1:21:42] finish smoking they come back in the
[1:21:43] church they the leaders of the church
[1:21:45] they come in to lead the people in
[1:21:46] worship and they all standing there
[1:21:48] there smoking
[1:21:50] cigarette or we carrying the people
[1:22:01] now we get in our our uh Ezekiel chapter
[1:22:03] 9 we already get the background that's
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:07] background why these six men were sent
[1:22:10] into the city that is the background
[1:22:13] because idoling has eaten the people up
[1:22:16] and the glory of God was going
[1:22:19] away was going
[1:22:21] away the things that used to to to
[1:22:24] capture our heart and and and
[1:22:26] conscientise us we have grown over it

[1:22:43] loud voice saying cause them to have the
[1:22:47] charge over the
[1:22:50] city to draw near even every man with a
[1:22:54] destroying
[1:22:56] weapon praise the
[1:22:59] Lord remember there there in Revelation

[1:23:08] their
[1:23:11] head that's the in Horn
[1:23:18] Rider
[1:23:21] amen he want his word to be to be
[1:23:25] impressed upon our heart write his word
[1:23:28] on the table of our heart that's the
[1:23:30] reason why he comes with that
[1:23:38] ink are we
[1:23:41] together praise the
[1:23:43] lord it's easy to sit
[1:23:47] back you sit back you can see all the
[1:23:50] fault of the drivers you can see uh you
[1:23:52] know all the uh uh uh you know and
[1:23:56] everything that is going wrong it's it's
[1:23:57] it's
[1:23:58] easy but get yourself into
[1:24:04] it are we
[1:24:08] together that's the spirit of the age is
[1:24:11] everywhere it's everywhere
[1:24:19] everywhere talking about the
[1:24:20] manifestation of the sons of God

[1:24:37] the Garden of Eden he was not just you
[1:24:39] know dressing
[1:24:41] nice he was putting things in
[1:24:45] place he was govering he was
[1:24:48] ruling he had things subjected to
[1:24:52] him praise the Lord and that's what the
[1:24:55] Holy Ghost want to do in our
[1:25:02] life no matter how things goes and uh
[1:25:06] how how how how how how crazy work can
[1:25:09] be and schedule can be we know our post
[1:25:11] of
