TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] then they have a Ministry together for the church now that isn't the ministry of brother naille that's your ministry to the church I'm giving this as example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as a pastor is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it but you can't do it in the privacy of your own room if you speak and you interpret you've got to come together now come together in the church off in a room to yourself because you have a private Ministry it's not an openly Ministry it's one that's to help the church see it's something to help the church but it isn't to be done in the main congregation only the way I'm going to tell you is to be done see then whatever brother Collins speaks and brother Hickerson gives the interpretation as example then let brother uh somebody write this down what it is and then if it's coming now we all know that the Lord is coming we're aware of that and if brother Neville got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right see but he's saying that the pastor at the platform for he's got the word for that and if he be a pastor Prophet to the church or Pastor rather he us to study the word of the Lord and tell you what's written in the word of the Lord about the coming of the Lord and you're warned by that a Ministry otherwise to the church which he wouldn't have any connection with is tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that something is not written in the word what's written in the word he's to bring it but what's not written in the word is what you here to tell him like for instance uh tell um a brother whe of thus sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his sand pit not to go to it because you'll be a truck turnover or something like that it's got to be done and you've spoken and he's interpreted and then lay that on the platform after your ministry is finished the other night after the church the hymn starts singing and so forth if your ministry is finished then let them come forth with what prophecy has been given and I do not think that we have or if you do put this in there when these people meet together let them who have wisdom first come because you see if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation according to scripture that cannot be received unless it be uh witnessed by two or three people two or three more witnesses see that's to witness to that that they believe it to be the word of the Lord because sometimes in these minor Ministries just like in any other Ministry you get Spirits that's wrong see they'll fly in there and we don't want that no we want these Ministries ready to be exposed if they're to be exposed because anything of God can don't worry about exposing it it'll it'll stand the test if it's of God it's like the pastor if somebody challenges him on the word he don't have to back up about it you know it's just exactly what he's talking to come on up here see and same as these other Ministries got to be the same way now if if one speaks in tongues and gives a message now some people speak in tongues when they're just edifying themselves the Bible said they just have a good time to speak in tongues they feel and they do speak in tongues they actually speak with tongues and it's the spirit doing it but if it's sitting out there in the audience speaking in tongues just edifying themselves then it isn't any profitable thing for the church the man's edifying himself or the woman or whoever is doing it see to speak in tongues as a gift of God to edification as Paul says in the scripture that it's to edify the church so it had to be some direct message from God to the church outside of what's wrote here in the Bible see it's something if you could ask me uh brother brandom uh how must I be baptized I can tell you right quick you don't have to speak in tongues and tell me that it's wrote right here in the Bible what to do about that see I don't have to you don't have to ask no questions on that have somebody speak in tongues and tell you see that's already written but if you say brother Brandon uh what must I do I've got a decision here I've got to make whether I should uh take this church or go to another church or something like that or should I do this now that have to come from God see God has to tell us that but that would have to come to another Ministry because the word don't say let arm and Neville leave brandom Tabernacle and go to the pwing Gospel Tabernacle see they don't say that in the word here see so that's what these gifts are for like a person come up up here and say you believe in Divine Healing we preach that we believe it we believe in KN and the all but here some man says he can't get through what's the matter then it takes God through tongues interpretation through prophecy or some way to go down in that man's life and pull out that thing that he's done and tell him about that's a Ministry that doesn't belong to the pastor it belongs to these ministering gifts but they're not to be done out there in the audience see now Paul never one time had to tell those tell those Ephesian Church anything about that they were in order the Roman church or none of those other churches only the Corinthian Church and they never could get themselves now Paul believed in speaking in tongues he had speak in tongues in the Ephesian church as same as he did in the Corinthian Church see but he could speak to the Ephesians greater things than what just speaking in tongues interpretive tongues now then if someone writes a message message that's been given in tongues or given in Prophecy and laid upon the platform it must be read by the pastor before the service starts of thus saith the Lord from these people who spoke and interpreted and if that comes to pass exactly the way the interpretation said we raise our hands and give thanks to God for his Spirit among us if it doesn't come to pass then don't do it anymore to that evil spirit's out of you God don't like lie is always truth then you see you're old enough now to act like man not children goo goo goo you got to have some meaning to something Let the church now as it's com in order come to this order if one prophesy if one come among you unlearned and you speak in tongues you'll be a barbarian to him he don't know what you're talking about see and really in this day where there's been so much confusion about it it causes a stumbling do but let one speak in tongues and another interpret and give the message and let it be read off right here at the platform of what's going to take place and then let it happen see what happened tell them that tomorrow at a certain time or next week at a certain time it's going to be a certain thing then let the unbeliever sitting there listen to that and see it's foretold before it happens then they'll know what kind of spirit's among you it'll be God's spirit that's why Paul said that if one can prophesy and reveal the secret things won't the whole congregation fall down to the unbeliever and say God is in the midst of you see because it cannot be but now we don't want when we was a child Paul said I acted like a child he told the Corinthians there I spoke like a child he had a child mind but when I become an adult I put childish things away now I'm telling you all see a few years ago you were children with these gifts playing back and forth but you've been to a long school now it's time to be man not use these just to play with these gifts are sacred they're of God and you don't play with them let's let God use them that's what your ministry wants to be that's the way to put the brandom Tabernacle in the service and and if this is questioned anytime let this tape stand as a witness that's the way it's to be done in the brandom Tabernacle if there would be a stranger come in cuz you have them all the time because this been an inter denominational Tabernacle there's people come in that doesn't have this well training they don't have it they don't know better in their own pastors they'll jump right up and break his message up and tear alter call up and speak in tongues and everything like that you're a better trained man in that see then after the service if he gets unruly then it's a Deacon's place to go to them don't let your pastor have to do it let it comes to a spot where there's no Deacon here but a deacon is supposed to see to that see now after the service if the person just raises up and gives a message the pastor if he wants to stop just a minute go ahead very well see that's up to the pastor but then immediately let the Deacon before that person gets out of the building take them to one side and talk to them about it and if they question it bring him to this tape and say this is what the bishop or the overseer of the church which is Bishop the any overseer that's what it's called in the Bible the bishop PR see so that's General overseer the church let this is the ERS and way our church does it now we love for you come give your a message but if you've got a message from the Lord and it's let it be given come up here and lay it on our platform and our Minister will read it to the congregation a message to this congregation but it must not be just repeating scriptures and things like that it must be a direct message to the people of something that's fixing to take place or something they should do is it understood all right now is there any better way to keep order in the church than to uh keep uh reminding the people uh with a uh repeat from the deacons accordingly no that I just explained that that's question number three the deacons your duty is to keep order in the church with kindness friendliness and then you are supposed to if someone gets out of order in the church or comes in here like a drunk or somebody come in like the shot that Minister out of the platform of night of there you heard about that that drunk coming in with a double barrel shotgun scream for his wife and and wanted I went up towards the pastor and and the pastor showed him his wife sitting there but he's going to shootter right in the church and the pastor started dealing with him instead of uh instead of the U uh the man with a shotgun turned around shot the pastor out of the pull pit and then shot his wife and then shot himself now if there had been a bunch of deacons there when that man entered that door that shotgun that had their arms the shotgun out of his hand see see that's that's orderly deacons and now these things have gone the way they're doing now you might just expect anything but remember the deacons are God's policemen in the house of God no matter what anybody else thinks sometimes a policeman won't have to go make AR rest on somebody maybe one of his friends but he swore to an office he's got to do it anyhow that's his duty to his City see that's the duty of a deacon to the church and U if uh someone jumps up and starts interrupting the pastor or something like that and a pastor in his message the Deacon's forced to walk up to them people two or three of them say could we speak to you brother see bring him from the church out in the office in here or some other office and speak to him about it say you not to interrupt you know it's a it's a great fine by the law to interrupt a service anyhow but some people such as a delinquent person or something come among you know and some religious fanatic and and start carrying on and the deacons and if and if the deacons don't seem to be able to control it then the trustee board or anyone else in the church can step up and give help to such a person you know that and U and now let me ask a question second here is there any better way to keep order in the church than to re remind the people with a repeat from the deacons now occasionally now I think that the the pastor ever so often or play this tap let that stand for a witness deacons are policemen and their word is Law and Order hey and they have the authority from the church and even from the laws of the nation to make that house of God be the right place and anyone to contrary a deacon like that is subject to 2 to 10 years in federal prison if you tell them to go and they don't do it or something like that somebody with this hardly conduct you just don't know what he's doing to he's subject self rival on himself to all kinds of fines any and then if it comes to a spot that somebody and I like and somebody jumps up and get this already just maybe speak in tongues or something I wouldn't go in on that see let them go because if they're a stranger if they are our own people then just let the next night you deacons just get this tap and say now we're going to play the orders of the church before we start to service I want everybody to understand it you pastors and you all can work together like that now brother BR what about about the Sunday School um brother bam about the Sunday School all right should it be before the preaching service yes we've always had it that way have the Sunday school before the preaching service and um that gives a chance for the little fellas who T Sunday school to dismiss their classes and and if they want little fellas don't understand it they have to sit all the way through the preaching service and then have Sunday school the little fellas are wore out let the Sunday School be first first have a set time just at one set time that Sunday school goes to session Sunday school superintendent is supposed to see that at this Sunday school goes to session at a certain time set time and it's dismissed at a certain time all the Sunday School allow so much time for that man dismissed should the teacher for the adult class be someone other than the pastor if it's so agreed if the pastor wants to teach the Sunday school and then bring the message later that's fine and dandy if he wants to do the double service but if he doesn't then have your adult Sunday school teacher see for your Adult class and then if uh if the uh Pastor uh has somebody else there in mind and the person wants to do it give yourself 30 minutes or whatever you're going to allow your Sunday School 4 30 35 40 minutes whatever it is and there should be a bell set you and when that Bell is tapped that means or either the church bell when it Taps on the outside that's dismissing Sunday school and when that bell rings that mean everything come to order right there there' be so much time then for a himym or two whatever you were to sing not too much time you wear the people out but keeping them too long see and U just tap the Bell have a hymn and whatever you're going to do and then send your classes to the place and immediately when that time comes say it's going to be at at 10:00 or 10:30 or 10:15 whatever it is tap that Bell andever teacher dismisses or CL come to the audience out here and then and give the report Sunday school report and then dismiss the whole thing and let all that wants to stay for preaching service be next and it's an AR question how me have a spit class not words oh yes you should have a three-year-old can't understand what a 14-year-old would understand I think I got that a little farther how many classes should there be you should put your classes and like a little bitty class that wants to have flannel graph that's too much for a 14-year-old boy or girl see you should have a someone to take a class for those little babies some old mother or something who knows how to take care of other classes I think U should be uh some body who's more uh able to present the word see and uh there should be classes to say how to be like a class of from the at least three classes there should be a little bitty baby class there should be be from about 5 years old and all the others under that should be kept with a mother and taken in the nursery if necessary during the time of the preaching if they go carrying on that's what the nurser is out there for and I think that the the classes should be range from like the little babies about five or 6 years old up to8 or nine 10 something like that and then from 10 years old on to 15 should be in the teenage class and then the adult class over at 15 CU they if they're old enough nowadays they can get a job and they're wan to vote at that age almost so they they should be able to hear the word but come out in the main Auditorium and have that uh who should be the teachers there you are that's up to you to vote your own teachers in and you ought to do that put them in there get somebody and meet with the church and say uh who's uh who here feels LED of the Lord and then get a qualified teacher and then let it be done it's got to be strictly business brother if the teacher can't qualify to it then change teachers when the time comes is under God if I be like an arm and Neville can't no more qualifi to be Pastor here I'm going to mention it to the church when i' see one thing here think it you deacons couldn't qualify to be deacons I would have mentioned to the church I find out there's a certain Deacon out here doing something he shouldn't do and he doesn't keep his post to duty and so forth like that or a trustee or whatever it is I can't build it in or out the church has to do that but I'm certainly go to present it before the church okay because that's what it should do that's what I'm supposed to be as overseer I'm supposed to look and see what's going on we're going to heaven not out here somewhere to Rally or something to have a lot of fun and run over one another and play baseball we're here handling the most gracious thing there is on Earth the word of God is be carried on in Godly order um who should be the teachers that's up to you to select them uh but I would take for the babies I take an old woman some that can do that but for the teenagers i' take some teacher that's strict and not just going out here and having weer roast that' be all right if they want to go on a weener roast but just put all the things of that put it to the word let somebody who's able to hold the word and it's going to be this church stands not for uh weer roaster all right and and little picnics that you want to go together in Fellowship that's fine that that's what you should do they entertain the children but in this place in here this is a word of God wi roast is when you get together something like that but not in this house of God and these no of course we know we don't believe in this year foolishness of of parties and everything like that around here we we you know better than that who should be over the Sunday School to keep it in order the Sunday School Superintendent that's what his business is he's not supposed to have anything to do with the deacons trustees pastors or nobody else he's got an office of his own whoever your Sunday school teacher is I know not that Sunday school teacher is supposed to see that every class is in its place and every teacher is present or substitute another teacher for that teacher if they're not there on that date then just before the Sunday while the lessons are going on this Sunday school superintendent is to go by and take up the offerings that they've had in there their Sunday school Collections and the report of how many present how many bibles they had in this class and so forth and make a report of it and then stand before the audience just before the preaching service when he's give the spot to do it when they have the Sunday School uh report after the Sunday school is over tell how many teachers how many present how many the whole Sunday school total the whole C total of offerings and so forth like deacons trustees pastors are not supposed to do that they have nothing to do into it that is the Sunday School superintendent's job and then if he sees that the Sunday School needs certain things then he is to present sent that to the U uh uh to the trustee board and the trustees has a meeting up on it first and then the trustees if they find that there is sufficient funds and so forth through the treasure then this can be purchased if he wants something there for literature or whatever it is or some Bibles or something they want to buy a Bible for uh the one you know it can uh find the most words and quote the most scripture or some Prize or something they go to give away like that or something they want to buy buy it to the church then let that be presented to the to the to the um the deacons and then let them find out if it's if it's if it's in the Treasure see and that I think that takes care of them five questions on that now on the next one is brother [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
