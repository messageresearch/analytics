While we remain standing, I want us to sing this song and uh let's do the sin has been watch. Yeah. Okay. the toll of the road will seem nothing. Yeah, let's let's do that. And uh I was thinking about this song during the weekend, you know, uh uh while I was away, I was a few places that I had to speak. I was most of my messages was on the full anointing, the anointing that leads the church. And uh uh and then I remember talking about uh the influence of the full anointing on healing. How sometimes God will put the church on uh the the anointing of an ox which is a burden bearing. Many times uh uh when when people are going through those things in our human mind we think that they don't have faith but uh uh it's an expression of faith a great expression of faith for a person to be going through uh tough trials in their life whether it is pain in their body or sickness or or but yet there is there is just something that is so anchor in your heart that uh no matter what you are going through, God is so real. And uh uh I beginning to to to see that, you know, especially having uh uh you know, my mother-in-law not being feeling well and uh uh you know, and and just to see uh I mean, all the effort that uh you know, she's putting in and my wife helping her and all of that. But it's something completely different when we come down to the word and we come down to to having our devotion. We go down to her room and all of that. I see something completely different. I see a strength. You know, I see I see an expression of faith. I see a love for the word that no matter the pains in her body, you know, sometime I will step down to her room in the night, knock at the door and get in, you know, I called and she will answer. I says, "Well, yeah. how you feeling? We talk a little bit. I said, "Let's pray," you know, and I mean, she's right there. She's ready there to worship the Lord. And uh, you know, and I just thought about this song and I just want us to just sing it and worship. Now, if you uh I send a verse out there, uh, people, when we get to the end of the road, The saints have been washed in the fortress. All the strangers of Galile and the voice that suck you the rock will be heard into the earth. Hallelujah. are the path of the flowing gathering with I will follow to thee [Music] and the toss of the road will see nothing when I get to the end of the way. Oh yes, the to see my face when I get you the way. There are so many hills to climb up wall. I'm longing for it. for he who acquaints me I pathway [Music] know just what is and what I know in his word I know in his word he has brought Now my strength it shall be as my name. the doors on the road. You see nothing [Music] when I came to the end of the way. All the door and the to see nothing when I get to the end. [Music] He loved me so to forsake me. I give you [Music] his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan claims love by and by I shall see him and praise him in the city of on the king. So where the door on the road will see nothing and I get to the end of the grave. Oh yes. The door of the Lord will say nothing when I get to the end of the world. [Music] [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; When the last feeble step has been taken. and the king of the city appear &gt;&gt; and the beautiful songs of those angels floating. When all that see so mysterious will be bright and clear as the day and your glory. of the Lord will say nothing when I get to the end of the way. Oh, down the to the room [Music] when I came to the end of &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You did a good job for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Father, we so grateful Lord [Music] &gt;&gt; that God there is a supernatural element in a believer that look to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Beyond all our eyes can see &gt;&gt; beyond father Lord God the things that we go through Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet said you don't look to our works you look at our faith. It's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. Thank you &gt;&gt; this morning, Father Lord, by the eyes of faith. &gt;&gt; We look beyond the curtains of time. &gt;&gt; We look beyond, Father God, all our struggle, our trials. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The toad of this role will seem nothing.

You know, I thank God has given us a spirit of lamentation in our church. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon said the spirit of lamentation was leaving the church. People no longer cry. All they do is they just laugh. Amen.

I don't want to start there. I want to start on the good note this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 17. Let's read from verse one. Now when they have passed through uh uh Amphipolios and Apollo, they came to Thessalonica where was the synagogues of the Jews. And Paul as a man was went in went in unto them and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening and and alleging that Christ must need have been suffer and raising again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This Jesus whom I preach unto you, man, this guy was a bold man. Amen. He was a bold man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was such a bold man. And some of them believe and uh consulted with Paul and Silas and all the devote greets. a great multitude. And of the chief women, not a few. But the Jews which believed that moved to envy took unto them certain ls. Praise the Lord. So uh rioters were every word took certain little fellows of the be so and gather accompanied and set over the city of an uproar and assorted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people. And when they have found them net, they drew Jason and certain brethrens unto the rulers of the city, crying, "These that have turned the world upside down, I come hither also." That was their crime. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was their crime. If we should be arrested this morning, &gt;&gt; I wonder what will be our crime. &gt;&gt; What can they lay charge? What charge can they lay on us for our faith? The crime of these men were they turned the world upside down whom Jesse has received and these all do contrary to the decreed of Caesar saying that there is another king one Jesus. Let us pray. Heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we just want to thank you Lord. Oh God, Father, if Lord uh the Alpha Church went through, oh God, Father, what would the Omega church go through? &gt;&gt; We just want to pray that Lord God, you will help us, Lord. Help us, Father God. Lord, to oh Lord, that our our minds will will be centered on you, Lord. the channels of our mind will be decloed this morning. Oh father god that it will just uh uh leave from on our self, leave from on this word and get on you Lord God. Oh father we pray this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh father we just want to remember all your children Lord Father that are streaming into the service this morning that couldn't be with us. Bless them in their homes, oh God, Father, and those that will follow later. We ask that you bless them too. We thank you, Lord, and we ask in Jesus name. Amen. The Lord bless you as pardon me. Hebrew chapter 11. Hebrew chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11. He Hebrew chapter 11. Let's read from verse 32. And what shall I most say? For the time will fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barack, of Samson, and of Jeepide, and David also, and Samuel and all the prophets, who through faith subdue kiddos, rough righteousness, or tain promises, stop the mouths of lions, quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the swarm, Out of weakness were made strong, wax violently in fight turn &gt;&gt; to flight. The the armies of the alien women receive their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured not not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection. Praise the Lord. And all those have uh trial of kura morgan scioning year more over of bounds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were saw a thunder were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They wander about in sheep skin and goat skin being destitute. You were afflicted tormented. This is where I want to come. Of whom the word was not worthy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The world was not wed of all of these Old Testament saints. When it came to the New Testament saints, they turn the word upside down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just I like to play these things in my mind like that. Amen. Praise the Lord. The word was not worthy of all of these Old Testament things. They wonder in desert and in mountains and in den and caves of the earth. All these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be there perfect the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. Amen. This morning I just want to take a little thought out of that they turn the word upside down. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to preach on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I couldn't get away from that phrase that they turned the word upside down. Amen. For whom the world was now worthy. It turned the word upside down. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good to be in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord is good. It's wonderful. Praise the Lord. So we we have to start up here and uh uh there were there was some there was some other historical things that I that I pulled together but I felt like uh just like last week I spent much of the time on my slides than than preaching and uh just because that's not my style. So u uh I I thought that well okay I would just I would just reduce that and then uh get to uh what I want. When you when I when you have the slide like this it kind of organize your thought but uh if you are not used to this style of preaching then uh even though it's organized yet is this organized for you because your mind is uh is going &gt;&gt; one way or the other. Praise the Lord. But we will get through it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; After all, he's the one that we want to praise, you know, we want to worship. So, we will get through it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Now, so uh uh uh reading from the book of Thessalonian and and talking about uh uh uh what was what we were talking about? &gt;&gt; I can't even remember my own. &gt;&gt; Playing God. &gt;&gt; Playing God. That was the subject. and uh just trying to be able to get myself back. Uh uh um so uh I went back and started reading uh uh a little bit about church history and just looking at uh uh Paul missionary journey and that that was much of that that I had in my notes, but I I just decided to take it off and uh so we can just be able to get down to to business. Amen. Last week we said that uh uh uh one of the big Roman uh persecution came on the the group in Thessalonica. So that's that was why we fall back on Acts chapter uh uh 17 just to be able to give us a picture of how the Thessalonica church started. That's how that church started. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's exactly how that church started. It started in the house of Jason. Now so uh uh looking at that I came up with this that church begins from whom? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church begins from whom and uh uh uh uh and and it's scriptural. You can see all the scripture there. We we read that also here in uh in that uh uh you know they came to the house of Jason you know to look for these men. So all in the all in the the the book of acts everywhere you will read about the church the believers gathering it was always in a home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was several years later before they had this setting where people leave their homes and come together. &gt;&gt; But the early church begin in the home. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's where we taking this thought from that church begin from home and I think it must begin from home for us also. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The service must begin from home. The way we prepare oursel, the way we prepare our mind. &gt;&gt; We must come praying up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If we come by, you know, fussing from home and arguing from home and and all of that, we bringing that right here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So church begins from home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So in Acts 12:12, the Bible says, "And they had consider the thing they came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose soul name was Mark, John Mark, where many were gathered together praying." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh they started here prayer meeting started here. So this very same apostle Paul the Bible say for Saul who made a havoc of the church entering into every house. &gt;&gt; So before he started going to house to preach, he was going to houses to persecute. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Before he started going to houses to preach, he was going to houses to persecute. So he make havoc of the church entering into every house and hauling men and women committing them to prison. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I mean, uh, you think about it. They they didn't had a cell phones and social media those days. And, and, uh, if if they were meeting in my house and, uh, maybe this next service will not be at my house, we will have to meet at brother Johnny's house next Sunday or for the next the next service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see they were not just sitting down waiting to be informed. They were looking for information. &gt;&gt; If you want to be in service, you have to look for information. Where are we meeting? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see how we sit back and we get so relaxed. We want to be told. Nobody told me. &gt;&gt; I didn't receive text message. We get all the excuses to give. If you wanted to be in church this time, you have to find out where are they meeting. Sister Nami, did you hear anything? Where where they meeting next week? Well, if you hear anything, please let me know. I if I hear anything, I'll let you know, too. &gt;&gt; That's how they went about. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 6:5. You see Paul here now uh after this uh as 8 experience uh we know that chapter nine he he he met the pillar of fire he got converted and now yeah he's the same one likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my well beloved uh Epheneathus who is the first fruit. Amen. And uh I I see what he says here in uh uh uh to the Corinthian church. What have have you not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of God? Now I put this one there just with the same with the same thought line that churches were in house. But here said they are gathered in this house for for you know for service for the communion and the way the people were going about that's why he used that statement that's why he said to them I mean when we are gathered in this house it's church &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; let's not take the house setting and then we start to break the order of the service &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; are you are you are you following me what I'm saying &gt;&gt; praise Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, and and and it's it's I mean, it's it's pretty much applied today. If you are home following the service online, you are in church. You must be able to respect the the the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't be in boxers and and eating biscuit, drinking Coca-Cola, and you say you following the service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then do that another time, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. &gt;&gt; Find your own convenient time and follow the service. &gt;&gt; But if you are streaming online, you must know that you are in church &gt;&gt; and you must be able to keep some decent order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because because uh uh the the the moving of the spirit is everywhere. You you just think about that if I mean if we have that attitude I mean it's it's a plus to the people that are in church because there's a group of people taking their position by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also in chapter 16, the churches in Asia salute you. Aquilia Priscilia salutes you. Salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their house. So you see that that was that was just the foundation of the New Testament church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Church begins from home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We cannot have awful attitudes at home and think we can bring our best offering to the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, our offering starts from home. The way we prepare ourself. When we wake up in the morning, the mindset we get ourself in. All of those things make you to to to get yourself ready for church and start getting you start gearing up for service &gt;&gt; when you know that church begins from home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you read the rest there. Salute the brethren in in Laisha. The church which is in his house, you know. Uh okay. And I put this one also there. Uh uh for if a man know not how to rule his own house, &gt;&gt; how shall he take care of the house of God? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see why why why they make this a qualification was because church begin from whom? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The offices in the church are not are not are not giving politically. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No. If a man cannot rule his own house, so your house must be an example. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because church begins from home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. you know, we do something a little bit here. Uh uh uh you know, most of the time if we want to we we we you know, we want to work with a brother, uh we we normally talk to the wife. One of the reason why I do that personally is because sometimes it looks like the wives are detached from the office of her husband. And then when the brother have a duty to do, the wife also have her own duty and and yeah, we know I mean or you just spending much of the time to the church. So we make sure that you are in line. You agree that your husband take this office. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't agree, no matter how much he's spiritual &gt;&gt; because y'all know what's going on there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. No, you don't have a man, you know, taking care of a church thing and a woman murmuring at the back. &gt;&gt; It goes in line when God called a man, God called his wife. So, she has to be involved. &gt;&gt; That's why I also put this there. For if a man know how to rule, know not how to rule his own house, how shall he rule the house of God. Why? Because church begins from home. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Church begins from home. Now, so we we we are talking about these uh uh uh uh testimonial brothers. The Bible says they turn the word upside down. Amen. &gt;&gt; They turn the word upside down. What a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that's the only thing they can accuse them for. Praise the Lord. Verse six. And when they drew hh they found they found them there. They drew Jason and the setting brethren to the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down. I come hither also. They have turned the world upside down. Now they have come to our place and they are turning everything upside down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now I want to just look a few things here. Just looking at the word that they turn upside down. What is the word? the Greek word cosmos there which means the word other. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It means the word other. And uh uh uh uh the word came out of the Greek word cosmo which means the faction of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they turn the word other than they turn the faction of the word. The word there in the Greek word is cosmo which means there were other order the church order and everything because that's exactly what they are doing here. They went into the synagogues preaching the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So they are turning the church all the upside down because the church is preaching creeds &gt;&gt; and dogma. Yeah, they are introducing the resurrected Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you see this will give us a far better understanding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; On 1977 prediction. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because most people says, "Oh yeah, brother Brandham says the world we in." No, he talks about the word other. &gt;&gt; That's right. which have to do with the denominational system. &gt;&gt; The church order is not going any farther with God. Are we together? I don't want to go into that, but I just I just throw that in. That word uh there is cosmo, which means the word of the the people of the word. So, we have the people of the word. We have the word order, the church order, everything. We have the faction of the word. We have the order of the word. So all of those all of those means cosmos. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of those mean cosmos. And uh that's also where our our you know our faction designer took cosmetic. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you check it out. That's that's where they took cosmetic. Now, so you will see that uh uh uh uh they turn the word upside down. So just just just you know just work this one out in your head. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They turn the word upside down. Now, I want to take I want to take this and and and uh uh uh and see if uh we'll find a place here. Praise the Lord. Believe that this this is from believe that this he started out in the ministry and the power and signs begins to follow him. Devil begins to stream. This is Jesus now. The pre the preacher call him a devil. The devil call him the son of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I put this there so you can see how the turning is taking place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll soon see how the turning. There are a lot of people that are walking on their head. They don't know. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How sure are you? The north is not down and the south is up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about any kind of h uh uh you know uh mysterious thing. I'm I'm just trying to talk about common sense. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because here is here right here we see that in the scripture the Bible says they call him those Pharisees. We read it the other night here Wednesday night talking abouth in John chapter nine the boy that is born blind they are doing everything to be able to convince that boy that the man that open his eye has a devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They are doing everything to convince the boy. The boy said whether he has a devil or not I don't know what I know. &gt;&gt; I was blind &gt;&gt; but now I can see. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So uh uh uh uh Jesus went out. He's casting out devils. The preachers call him devil. The devil call him the son of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. just about as by today says I'm scorching preachers with some uh some mean. I don't mean there to to to be you my brothers. I'm glad. All right. But but it is you can go talk to a preacher about the signs and wonders about what God is doing. They will say that's a devil. &gt;&gt; And the devil would turn back and says this is the power of God. Amen. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; And uh uh like Paul and Silas, this was uh uh in uh uh just before uh uh uh Acts chapter 17 where the Bible says they are turning the world upside down. Acts chapter 16. And that's that's what he's referring to here. They went they went into a place. Paul and Silas up there one night and all them people were saying these are imposters. These men turned the world upside down. They are imposters. The preachers and a little uh old fortune tellers stool on the street and said they are the men of God that tell us the way of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was what the little girl said. &gt;&gt; You know, she had she had a she had a you know a fortune telling spirit on her. But when she saw Paul and Silas, she said, "These men are are God's men." Amen. These men are the men of God. They are Gods. They come to tell us about the word of life. &gt;&gt; So, can you see that it's upside down already? &gt;&gt; But we just have to find out which direction it is. &gt;&gt; The world is already upside down. Can you see with everything that is happening? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it enough? Is it not enough to tell you that it's upside down? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'll show you show you a little bit here. I'll show you a little bit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; With everything that is happening, recognize it before people that profess to be Christians and believers. That's right. They recognize the power of God. They have some conscious of what the spirit means. And all we know is just a little reading, writing, aromatic, a little self-made knowledge. Amen. I tell you what we need today is an oldfashioned revival. Something that will shake us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that will turn us upside down. I think some of us need to be turned upside down. We have so much thing hanging on us. We so heavy. We need to be held by our feet and shake. Let everything fall off. Amen. I think that's what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you need to be light to go in this rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't want nothing holding you down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I tell you what we need is an oldfashioned revival. Till man gets down and pay the price and lose sight of the word and what's around him. He can move into a spear with God and tie it there till the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; uh tie it there with the Holy Ghost until power comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs. &gt;&gt; That's what the believers needs. I need it this morning myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need it this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? [Music] I will I will skip this. Let me come to this. Just like we just read this, I'll get back to what I just skipped. The devil is is the one that turned the world upside down from the beginning in the first place. God had everything perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had everything perfect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He the one did the turning. And because of that, God in every age raised always raised up a man to turn it back. Mhm. &gt;&gt; But because the the the the uh Satan civilization that we're playing Satan Eden this morning uh on our Sunday school Satan civilization make make people to to to see the word as it is that so much they don't understand that the word is upside down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I I just put in a little note here just to remind myself. The devil is the one that turned the world upside down. Man has got so used to disorder and chaos &gt;&gt; until when they see order and decency. &gt;&gt; They are confused. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're so so used to disorder and chaos. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That when they see other &gt;&gt; and decency, &gt;&gt; they take it to be wrong, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They take it to be old faction. &gt;&gt; They take it to be something. Oh my god. I don't know which word it came from. &gt;&gt; It was here. It was here a long time ago. &gt;&gt; All this distance was right here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But man has got so used to chaos. that every other day there there have to be some form of violence and every other day there just have to be some form of chaos. That that is the word and we are getting immune to it. &gt;&gt; This word is getting immune to it. The spilling of human blood is is I mean it's is it's is nothing that everybody will be running I mean with social media everybody will be running and and trying to find the app to see how how the killing was done. That's a horrible thing. &gt;&gt; That's a life leading someone. &gt;&gt; What pleasure do you have going to see how it was done? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that gravity thing stays on your mind. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But the word is getting so immune to it. &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah chapter 5, Isaiah would describe the cosmo civilization. He would describe the world civilization. If you read Isaiah chapter 5, we know that uh uh he was a he was a dynamic prophet. So there is six uh uh description of the world civilization that Isaiah will describe here. He says Isaiah 5:8. You can go and read the whole thing. I just pulled these ones up just to be able to address our subject. Woe unto them that join house to house that lay feast to feast. Now when you hear this thing join house to house and lay feast to feed what do you think about &gt;&gt; look at your highways &gt;&gt; look at your sky strippers &gt;&gt; that's what we call civilization when we have when we have when we have a sky stripper where house is joined to house and it can go 20th story and 40th story look at your highways the fees are lay on top of one another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what did he say? &gt;&gt; How did he describe a war? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When that civilization comes, you know, you you you find other places around the world, countries, they say, "Wow, this country don't they don't even have no uh uh uh uh how do you call it? Overhead bridge." that it looks like it's a it's a ter word. It's a fourth world country, five world country. Where is it on the map? No development. &gt;&gt; Go look at this other place. See how the bridge Oh my god. See the street and and everything. Even before men got to that civilization, a prophet of God cry out and say, "Whoa." &gt;&gt; Yeah. W to them that join house to house and feed to field till there is no place that they may that that they may be placed along the midst of the earth. Amen. On that there is no place the development see all your your buildings here you know all they are just expanding building building and yet the prices of house are still expensive. &gt;&gt; I know &gt;&gt; we have a we have a homeless uh uh population &gt;&gt; and yet uh the buildings are growing up. Verse 11, he says, "Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink, &gt;&gt; that continue all night till wine inflamed them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's our society. Okay? Whether whether it is wine, whether it is drugs, that's our society. And you see the thing about it that is that I say this in a very respectful way but it's truth. You realize that many of our people in the medical field many of our CEO I mean people are dealing with so much thing that they just need a a a good dose of wine. Wine helps them to get their mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; People there so much cannot stand the pressure out there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That they just have to be under the influence of something. &gt;&gt; It's an age where everybody is under an influence. &gt;&gt; But be under the influence of God. &gt;&gt; Be under the influence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You get a dose of the Holy Ghost before you go out in the morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because I mean if you don't get honor and influence, you might not be able to stand the things that are out there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, you you you you hear nurses talking about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You hear them talking about it. Then they should intimidate you a daughter of God &gt;&gt; that get on your knees and pray. W unto them that draw iniquity with calls of vanity. Praise the Lord. When you think about that, what's what comes to your mind, war unto them that draw iniquity with cause of vanity, and sin as it were a cover up. Praise the Lord. Now, Isaiah is is is uh uh is is describing on a prophecy. He's describing a civilization that is going to come. &gt;&gt; What the people will call modern civilization. What the people will call advancement. What unto them that call evil good and good evil. &gt;&gt; They put darkness for light and light for darkness. Is this not upside down? &gt;&gt; Don't you see this whole thing that is upside down? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And see these men trying to bring truth. They trying to bring the reality of God among the people. They say they turn the world upside down. No, they are turning it back into order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the thing that has the whole thing upside down. &gt;&gt; When you can look at good and call it evil &gt;&gt; and you look at evil, call it good. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; W to them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight. Daniel said, "Knowledge shall increase." Isaiah, he's just coming under what Isaiah is saying right here, an age of knowledge, intellectualism. Praise the Lord. W unto them that are mighty to drink wine, a man of strength to mingle strong drink. Now, so uh uh uh that the reason why I skipped this is is because is because of that year. Uh it is be not afraid. You know it was said of the disciples. I believe the brother said it. They said this man turned the word upside down. They didn't turn the word upside down. They just turned it back right. &gt;&gt; Because it was already upside down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already upside down. When people don't even know decency, they don't. They can't even tell whether it's hot, whether it's cold. All they want to do is just strip themselves naked and just be all over the place. Amen. You can't tell whether this is bedroom clothes or this is uh street clothes. And I mean, it's all upside down. &gt;&gt; And then when God raised a person up to be able to appreciate decency, then they say, "Oh, this one, she's upside down." No, no, she's turning the right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is the position of God's children in all ages. &gt;&gt; When the devil turn the world upside down, God's people is to set it by right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why Paul says that the the creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God to do what? To set it back, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; They just turn it. They just turn it right. They turn it uh uh back right again. It seems upside down to everybody else. It has been upside down so long till they just turn it back right again. And that's what the gospel does. &gt;&gt; It set our life right back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. It keep us from walking on our heads and walking sideways and set us back on our feet &gt;&gt; where we can be a son of God, a daughter of God. We can know our own worth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were born with your worth. &gt;&gt; You don't need attachment for you to walk. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You don't need attachment. Bracelets, clothes, and and head and all that does not give you. It reduced your worth. &gt;&gt; You have a soul in you that worth 10,000. &gt;&gt; When you came from the hands of almighty God, you came with a value. You came with something that worth everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the life of God, the breath of God was in you. &gt;&gt; You don't need all of these attachment that we put on for you to walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see that look at look at Noah in his days. Amen. The Bible says the the the word was so evil. &gt;&gt; The imagination of man was wicked. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The scripture says the word not wanting of this man. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were called fanatics. It looks like Noah was losing his mind. How can he talk about rain? We have not heard about rain. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he was going to turn the world upside down. &gt;&gt; He was going to do something that would shock the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to shake them out of their iniquity and their immorality, the evil that have come upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And he had a message for 120 years. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to shake that generation into place. See, Abraham, he turned his word upside down. For the first time that people will see a man of a 100 years old, a woman that pass &gt;&gt; bringing forth childmen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ah yeah, that will be an ups down because it it it will confuse the scientist word, the medical word of that time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When a man hold to the promise of God, amen. and believe God's word, he has the potential of turning this word upside down. He can create another one and go right into it. &gt;&gt; That's what the faith of Abraham did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He kept confessing that God promised me I'll be the father of nations. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They tried to work around the promise and and and and compromise and bring Hagar in. God said, "No way." I said, "By Sarah, you will have a child." No matter how long it takes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How long it takes, God placed something in his word. Many of us, we might not reach 90 years old. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you can keep believing God. &gt;&gt; If Sarah could reach that age and God could visit her, there is no reason why for you to give up on God. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Abraham faith turned the world upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when at a time where he was he was he was giving up h Genesis 15, &gt;&gt; he called Eleazar trying to make him the the the the hears of his home. God said, "No, it's not going to be Eleazar. is is going to be a son that will come out of you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He turned his own word upside down. &gt;&gt; Look at Moses going to Egypt now with an army. &gt;&gt; He only had a stick in his hands, &gt;&gt; but he had doubt said the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When a man is ready to to to surrender to God, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, God has to first turn you upside down before he can use you to turn the word upside down. &gt;&gt; If you want to turn your world upside down and don't want to be turned upside down, it's not going to work. Because even if the if your word is turned upside down, it will be upside down to you because you are not turned yet. &gt;&gt; So God has to turn you upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why he did to Moses. He turned him upside down. talking to the backside of the of the wilderness. Shake him of of of all his Egyptian knowledge and everything. &gt;&gt; Bring him to the to the place of faith and faith alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God turned him upside down. A military general, a man that learned all the wisdom of Egypt. Now Y say he's a shepherd boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear say he's a shepherd, but God shook him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God shook him. God God gave him one of the most ridiculous career because shepherds were abomination to Egyptians. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. Shepherds were abomination to Egyptians. &gt;&gt; And with all the Egyptian knowledge he come, God say, "Okay, I will send you to the more abominable place so you can be able to learn me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shock him. Turn his word upside down. &gt;&gt; Some of us, we so heavy for God to turn us upside down. &gt;&gt; We are grappling to everything. &gt;&gt; The grace of God is trying to pick you up or you holding to everything. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. &gt;&gt; That wind he will use to sweep your feet up. &gt;&gt; He will not want to turn you upside down. You will be spinning. &gt;&gt; Keep holding. &gt;&gt; Amen. Almighty God ready for you.

We we plant the seed, we dig it up tomorrow to see whether it stay there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when you keep doing that, you are prolonging the growth. &gt;&gt; Because the seed is not getting is not getting contact with the earth because you keep tempor tempering with it. Amen. and uh uh don't put your hands on it anymore. Let God have it. If you are going to do something about it, then God will stand back and let you go ahead till you get finished. But when you commit it to God and let him have it, then he will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You just believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen.

You believe God, but yet there are still habits in your life that was bothering you, but you believe God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe God in the midst of that. Nobody will believe that you. This guy, he's just joking. I know this one. &gt;&gt; He's just joking. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Nobody will believe you. But yet you believe &gt;&gt; that something happened. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it, &gt;&gt; but you knew that something happened. &gt;&gt; Your your your habits and and and and all the things you struggling with in your life keep pulling you here and there, but down in your heart, praise the Lord, you keep believing says, "Oh yeah, you know, I've I'm a Christian. Really? &gt;&gt; You too. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Nobody believe. But you keep believing. &gt;&gt; Now let's listen to what Paul says in Ephesians. He says, "While we were yet dead in sin and trespass, &gt;&gt; you think about it now. You are dead in sin and trespass, but yet you believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How much more when you come to life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How much more when that seed of faith grow &gt;&gt; to now possess your body? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To now take control of your habits &gt;&gt; and your thoughts. &gt;&gt; But while you are yet dead in sin and trespass, &gt;&gt; oh my goodness. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can believe being a dead man &gt;&gt; in sin, &gt;&gt; how much more now &gt;&gt; that you have come to life? &gt;&gt; How much more now that the grace of God have resurrected you that you have to hold on to it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no man believe that this man is dead beside this man. You can't believe it more than him. If he was not there, he would get up and tell you say, "I'm not there." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for the fact that he can't talk, &gt;&gt; you cannot believe that he's dead more than himself. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. People has been caught up in in in in a situation where uh uh uh you know they are not they are not gaining pause and and and and you know uh uh uh think and and they've been pronounced uh uh uh uh dead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But they were they were not dead. I I have one of my little sister that was in that situation some years ago out of an accident and uh uh uh you know the the rush up to the to to the mall and all of that and and and now people has been in that situation but because they are not there they come out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding where I'm going with this? But when you commit it to God and let him have it, then he will do it. You just believe him. Just stand back and don't work. But believe that word grace is imputed for righteousness to believe that God will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I I I I I place this there because I I use this year just commit them to God. Now down here is a testimony of Susanna Wesley that had 17 children. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And h her husband was a preacher. Samuel, he was a preacher and he was a Meodist preacher and and and and a fire brand too. He was I mean he was he was a fire brand and this guy was very legalistic in prison. &gt;&gt; Yes. I mean he was a strong preacher. I mean that that was what he knew at that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and uh you know and and for his uh his his faith, you know, uh and and and and the way that he wanted to to bring his children. There's just a lot that we could say, but I want to dwell on Sister Susanna Wesley this morning. and she has 17 children. And with uh with them 17 children uh uh back 100 years ago, she could still uh uh take from two or three hours a day in all of her busy schedule to read the gospel and to pray. Amen. For her children, read her gospel and to pray for her children. It was said that uh children knew when mama had her apron on her face that the house need to be quiet. Amen. Just like Habacu said, "The Lord is in his holy temple. Let the earth keep silence." When mama had her apron on her face, the earth need to be silenced &gt;&gt; because mama was praying. Amen. &gt;&gt; They knew that they grew under that. But you see, here is the thing here. What I'm dwelling on is that she was committing them to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. She was committing them to God. She was committing them to God. John was one of the youngest one. And what happened is they the uh uh uh his other sisters and you know they they really had trouble in in in their marriages because of the position of their dad. That thing scared John Wesley. They actually got married late. It scared him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here is the thing here is that 17 children she was committing them to God and uh found time through her busy schedule. What happened? She had a John and a Charles Wesley out of there that turned the world upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. with all of that uh dedication and commitment and prayer, God was able to raise up a seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God was able to to to to bless these two boys. Charles was the singer. John was the preacher. Why? Because a mother committed it to God and left it there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even though it was not looking like the the way it should look. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not looking like the way that the mind would tells you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes our trials is just like taking pain pills. Oh, being under anesthesia. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean they they gave you the medication for pain. Your body, your mind have sense a pain in your body. It have sense an illness in your body. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; With this hit you have had or this cut, your mind tells you there is pain. But when you take the pain pills, it deceive your mind. Your mind say, "Oh, I thought there was pain. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, there is no pain." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, your mind goes in this place to believe that there is no pain. But when the medicine starts to wear out, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then your mind is I thought there was no pain. I was expecting pain but out of a and and sometimes that is the way it is. We we commit things to God with a mindset. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have something on our mind. We are believing that when I pray for this, this is the way that God is going to answer it. This is the way it's going. So, we have that mind set. But then when the trial of life comes, &gt;&gt; it shock our mind. Oh, I thought it was going to happen like this. So, you see, then your mind goes in that place. Well, but this is what I prayed for. This is not what I asked for. This is not what I was expecting. So, your mind goes into that place. You see, that is the reason why we must not be dwelling up here. We must make sure that it's something that is sealed down in our heart. It's a conviction just like a h a shedra me. We know that God will deliver us. &gt;&gt; It was in here. We know it was in here. It was something that was established. It was something that that their conviction. We know &gt;&gt; that God is a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But now our mind is going through a shock. Why is why is this? They said the the the the the furnace is going to be heated seven times. They they are hearing it. They they are hearing that guys, you going to go to the fire. &gt;&gt; Are you not changing your mind? Are you not changing your testimony? &gt;&gt; No. If they were up here, they will have reason with one another. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you see, their faith was so much down here. &gt;&gt; They their faith was solidly their life. &gt;&gt; That they knew that God will deliver them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if it does not if it does not uh h appear in the way that we think about it then our mind goes into a shock. Praise the Lord. We starts to feel this pain. I mean I've been a believer how can I go through this? I've been serving God all. How can I go through this? Oh your your your faith has to rest down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has to rest down. It has to leave your first conscious and become your second conscious. &gt;&gt; The reason why your faith has to become your second conscious because most of your reaction comes from your second conscious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your subconscious. &gt;&gt; Most of your reaction comes from your subconscious. Because the things that we deal with in life, the way they hits us, the the the the the experiences we go through has the tendency of residing in our subconscious. &gt;&gt; So when something appear like that, it gives you an attitude. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see when faith goes down and and and reside in your subconscious when faith sits down in your subconscious and become your reaction that's when we can we can rejoice in tribulation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's when we can bless God in tribulation. Why? Because your reaction is coming from a place of faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. They turn the world upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's our time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's our time. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be fanatics about it. &gt;&gt; We are going to be solic. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are going to be solic fanatic about it. You read the book of Acts, you'll see that uh I mean some another place they got to throw Paul in a basket and get him out of the city quickly because they knew that these guys were angry. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know that I mean that is the reason why we we we just we just choose a love to live a simple Christian life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not becoming fanatic, you know, and insulting people on the street. That's not Christianity. becoming a bigot. That's not Christianity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not all about what we say. It's a it's is it's the way we live. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's the ability that we have to be able to self others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to be self, then you are God that is sitting in this temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you have make yourself God so we can come and serve you and worship you. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That is our time. This is our time. This is our age. This is the bright age. The omega age where she's turning the word upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the the the the mind that the entire world is going on. She's looking in the seals. She's seeing what is coming. Amen. She's seeing the prophecy that are being fulfilled. She's not reading the news like the way the word is reading the news. Praise the Lord. When she hear in the news that Roger threw something by the border of of Poland, she says, "Oh my God, &gt;&gt; is that the ter?" Because she's looking, &gt;&gt; the man of Christ has come to send us back to the word, not to send us to CNN. &gt;&gt; That's exact. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or to Wall Street is to go back to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when everybody is on a panic, she's just resting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's just resting. She's just spreading her wings &gt;&gt; in the written word and the spoken word, the New Testament, and the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She said whatever happened just going to lift me out of here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She's turning her word upside down. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me just read one thing to you and then we close this morning. &gt;&gt; Okay. I know. Praise the Lord. That's what happens. I told myself I will forget about this and yes I did. But uh I still have it here. So I think I can I can be able to get back and share that with you. This was my first quote in my notes but then I end up making it my try to make it my last. That's what I wanted to rest on this morning, but then I didn't I didn't add it to my slide. So, I would just read it to you and then we we find a place to close this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is our time, people. This is our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. I don't know what you're dealing with, you know, in your life, but uh the first thing I want to find I want you to find out is that which direction are you are you are you standing or are you have you been turned over by this thing? &gt;&gt; Have this thing turned you over? It looks like uh your feet are in the head and your head is down. &gt;&gt; Because you first have to know your position. You have to know where you are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just like God saying, "Adam, Adam, where are you asking Adam, do you know your position? &gt;&gt; Are you in your place?" &gt;&gt; He was not looking for Adam. He's the all known God. &gt;&gt; But he wanted Adam to know whether he knew where he was. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm saying this morning. You have to know where you are, where you standing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because we have a word. We have a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. that have come to turn us upside down, to set us right, &gt;&gt; turn us away from our sin and our desires and uh and walliness and evil and set us on our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't say you're on your feet. I mean, when you when you stay licking the dust like the serpent, &gt;&gt; the serpent was kicked up off his feet. God said on your belly you will go. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says. God says on your belly. He if he was on his belly, God won't tell him on your belly you will go. &gt;&gt; And the dust, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to know that this flesh is dust. &gt;&gt; When you so involved in in in in fleshly things, you are licking the dust. &gt;&gt; Are we together? the bus you will go. That's why he told he told Adam, "Praise the Lord." Let me do something very quickly here and then I will let you go. Thank you for bearing with me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. We want to just thank him for, you know, just being uh who he is to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's an awesome God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's an awesome God. Emmanuel, I sent you something back there. Can you put it up? Take this slide down. We are done with this. And then let's let's just close with this. Let's just close with this. The Apostle Paul said this this was my first quote. It was actually my uh my inspiration but then I I choose to make it the last and I didn't put it in the slide. Paul said, "Now year I know I preach the gospel. That's my duty." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a preacher. He's a preacher. Bernie is a preacher. That's that's our duty is to be a preacher. Praise the Lord. Well, that's just what we supposed to do. But let me do something. Paul said that is beyond. Let me do something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. I must go to church. You know, I must pay my tithe. And all of those things are beautiful. They all But let me do something &gt;&gt; just beyond that. Now I have got a right to take up money. Paul said, but I'm going to make tanks just to show you I can sacrifice. He said it's honorable. Marriage is honorable among all the best undefined is good for the man to be married. He said I got a right to be married. I could be married. I got a legal right to be married, but I just won't get married. I want to do another sacrifice for the Lord. See then he says every man know his calling. Some are unas for the word word of God sake also for we want to do something beyond our duty. That's that just where I want to do it with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to do something beyond our duty. And that's where when we get going beyond our duty, beyond our calling, that's that that's where we get to this place of doing X plus for God. We want to do something beyond our duty. And if you are you are really a born again born again of the spirit of God and says, "Well, my duty is to go to church. I guess I have to go." Oh my. Well, I want to do more than that. &gt;&gt; I want to win souls for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to do something. I want to visit the sick or do something for him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; A desire of turning somebody's word upside down. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can meet up all sinner on the street and by just telling him something. I was I just sharing with my wife uh uh the other day and I was driving and then uh uh a little pool right behind me and I rear light and I was looking in my rear view mirror. I mean I just just see her weapon her face, you know. I mean I I don't know what she was going through but I could tell from her. She says, "And this car just pulled right in front of me. With this writing, with God, all things are possible." &gt;&gt; I see her mumbling that in the w in, you know, in in a rear view mirror, I said, "Oh, God, I don't know what she's dealing with." But that little inscription on the back of my car, &gt;&gt; have ministered to her. &gt;&gt; You want to turn somebody word upside down, &gt;&gt; you want to turn somebody word &gt;&gt; by just telling them, "God bless you. You can turn somebody word &gt;&gt; upside down. &gt;&gt; They might be going through a horrible day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But just allowing yourself for the kindness of God to flow through you. &gt;&gt; We in we we in an age this age is is a kind of a self-pity age &gt;&gt; and a self-pity age have just make us to be so selfish. We are so consumed with ourself. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can turn someone uh I mean it could be just uh you know a old gentleman or an old uh lady at at the at the Walmart. You can turn her word upside down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it must it must be something that that is in there that that is ready to flow out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I saw right there the uh the African shop right across there. I was sitting sitting in the vehicle. guy came from there. Uh uh and then uh uh a young a young guy came uh drove on his back and came closer to the car and just you know uh spoke to me in our Liberian uh vernacular and asked me you know if I could give him some money. He called his name and called my name yeah you know you know he just started going on talking and and what have you. So I says, "What's what's going on?" Can't remember his name now. Call his name. I said, "What's going on?" You know, I just said, "What's going on with uh with John?" You know, he says, "Yeah, yeah. John has been having a rough, you know, but it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay, you know. It's going to be okay." Yeah. They're trying to pull myself together, you know. And we we had a good talk and we we talk along and then he says, "Uh, he just said it was it was uh it was something strange." Says, "Wow, I can see I can see that you are a pastor. &gt;&gt; So I said well I mean that's I I told him I say I can't remember his name now. So I call him John.

Get off the couch. &gt;&gt; Get out. Get off the couch. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are killing your Christian faith when you cannot find the courage to tell somebody, "God bless you." You can't find the courage to extend an invitation and says, "Uh, do you want to come to me to church?" You can you can h have the courage to to be able to just have a neighbor. Just have a neighbor conversation. You don't have to talk about the seven seals. You don't talk have to talk about Calvary. Just talk about the neighbor. You just had a neighbor. When did you move here? How you think about this neighborhood? [Music] Just to be able to talk to people. Our Christian faith is too sticky. It's too church sticky. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's gum. It's gum to the bench. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's too gum to the bench. You know those kind of a gum that sticks so long that when you take it off it peel, it take the pin off. Our church f is too sticky. [Music] God want us to be flexible. He want us to be loving. He want us to be conscious. We are not just throwing ourself in the hands of people. But he also want to use you to turn somebody word to give someone hope to just hold somebody hands and say it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. No matter what it is, it's going to be okay. Sometimes we get job but what all that consume our mind is just the money clock in and clock out. [Music] I think I do more pasural work at my job than anywhere else. I do I find the opportunity that any gave me time to just drop right in there. I'm not preaching. I'm not calling coach but I'm talking life life experience. life experience.
