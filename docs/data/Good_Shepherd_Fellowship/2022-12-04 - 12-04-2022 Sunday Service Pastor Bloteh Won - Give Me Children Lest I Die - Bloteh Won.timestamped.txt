[1:00:38] praise the Lord if the Lord tarot they
[1:00:41] give us the opportunity to see 2023 then
[1:00:45] we will go into that that series
[1:00:49] and a couple of announcement year for
[1:00:53] our end of the year service
[1:00:55] uh the last hit of the year comes on
[1:00:58] Saturday
[1:00:59] so uh
[1:01:02] uh instead of having an all night and
[1:01:06] expect you to come to church on Sunday I
[1:01:09] will now want to be cruel amen praise
[1:01:12] the Lord
[1:01:13] I know a couple of years back we did
[1:01:16] that one time we had a Easter meeting
[1:01:18] where we had a all night and then we
[1:01:22] went home and then came back you know oh
[1:01:25] my God praise the Lord
[1:01:27] uh
[1:01:28] after all I was thinking what was I
[1:01:30] doing you know what brother Clay farmer
[1:01:33] was the one that preached the meeting he
[1:01:35] never forget about that
[1:01:36] he never forget about that
[1:01:40] he never forget about that he's he's his
[1:01:42] brother that was my first time going on
[1:01:44] the marathon
[1:01:47] you know so we would not want to do that
[1:01:49] so what we would do is that we would
[1:01:51] have the Friday night
[1:01:53] we'll have a Friday night service where
[1:01:55] we can be able to sing worship testify
[1:01:59] do whatever we will like to do in
[1:02:02] appreciation to the Lord and then uh
[1:02:05] then you can be able to go home have a
[1:02:08] good rest and then we will be back
[1:02:10] Sunday morning praise the Lord so we
[1:02:13] were planning on having a good Friday
[1:02:15] night uh Friday all night service
[1:02:19] and uh for Christmas weekend also we
[1:02:25] also want to thank the Lord Brother uh
[1:02:29] timason had a successful surgery and uh
[1:02:33] and he's recovering praise the Lord
[1:02:35] spoke with him yesterday or day before
[1:02:37] yesterday and he sent his greetings to
[1:02:40] the church he want to thank you for your
[1:02:42] prayers and also for your support we we
[1:02:46] kind of for supporting him through the
[1:02:48] course of the surgery
[1:02:49] so uh
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:53] uh he was hoping there because he's in
[1:02:56] the country where his wife he was hoping
[1:02:58] that he will be able to come as soon as
[1:03:01] he is able to regain his strength so we
[1:03:05] are thinking that if he's able to be yet
[1:03:07] around that time he might take the the
[1:03:10] Christmas weekend for us uh uh since uh
[1:03:14] it has fallen our law to to have uh uh a
[1:03:18] special meeting also that we will be
[1:03:21] speaking on and I'm still working out
[1:03:24] the the the the planes yeah but we are
[1:03:28] trusting that the Lord will will be able
[1:03:31] to have his way amen we'll trust in that
[1:03:35] the Lord we have his will
[1:03:37] so that's that's what our announcement
[1:03:40] for for the the end of the year meeting
[1:03:45] uh I want you to note that on your
[1:03:47] calendar the last Friday uh in the year
[1:03:50] will be our end of the year service
[1:03:53] and then we can be able to
[1:03:55] to maybe remind staff service a little
[1:03:58] bit later that we can be able to just
[1:04:00] spend spend the evening uh to the
[1:04:03] morning and I mean just as the Lord will
[1:04:06] be able to lead us amen praise the Lord
[1:04:09] so uh that's that's what our
[1:04:12] announcement is I hope I'm not
[1:04:14] forgetting anything
[1:04:16] but it's good to see you and it's good
[1:04:18] to be in the house of the Lord praise
[1:04:20] the Lord
[1:04:21] Amen on Wednesday night we we kind of
[1:04:24] introduce a thought uh uh gave me
[1:04:28] children Lisa died there was uh
[1:04:33] Richard cried to to Jacob
[1:04:36] and uh
[1:04:38] uh
[1:04:41] and I thought I had something already
[1:04:45] that I thought I was going to speak on
[1:04:47] but
[1:04:50] I I feel in there to for us to continue
[1:04:53] to look into that subject and just like
[1:04:56] I said the reason why uh uh I thought
[1:05:00] about it uh
[1:05:02] uh young Joshua sent me a video uh
[1:05:06] during the week
[1:05:08] about uh
[1:05:10] the the machine area that we spoke about
[1:05:12] I think he went on YouTube and found a
[1:05:14] testimony part of it uh something that
[1:05:17] was copied like his last sermon he
[1:05:20] preached on the Titanic and which of
[1:05:22] course it was very beautiful
[1:05:25] but uh uh and I also been kind of for
[1:05:28] looking into brother Brandon investment
[1:05:30] uh series listening to different all of
[1:05:34] his investment series just in a sense of
[1:05:37] uh coming to the end of the year then
[1:05:40] you know uh trying to look through the
[1:05:43] different things that we have done you
[1:05:45] know uh uh as a family as a church as an
[1:05:49] individual as as a minister as a
[1:05:52] Ministry all of that so that's that's
[1:05:55] the place where my heart is for us for
[1:05:58] us to be able to take uh
[1:06:03] an inventory of our commitment to the
[1:06:06] Lord and not making the New Year
[1:06:10] resolution but in the sense of
[1:06:13] challenging our heart and to be able to
[1:06:16] advance in the purpose of the Lord
[1:06:19] so as we will look into the subject what
[1:06:22] I want you to do is that uh I will I
[1:06:25] pray that that the Lord will be able to
[1:06:27] to bless us and as we look into the word
[1:06:31] uh to be able to look beyond the letters
[1:06:35] let's go right into the mind of God
[1:06:38] you know let's look and and try to see
[1:06:41] what what was God's taught
[1:06:44] because as we will as we will look into
[1:06:46] the subject just like I said on
[1:06:49] Wednesday uh you have to realize that
[1:06:53] the principal team of the Bible
[1:06:56] is Jesus
[1:06:58] amen he's the principal team of the
[1:07:00] Bible from Genesis to revelation he is
[1:07:03] the principal team of the Bible so all
[1:07:06] the characters in The Bible are in the
[1:07:09] second place
[1:07:10] there are many expressions in the Bible
[1:07:13] that that are there and if God don't
[1:07:17] help us to look beyond the letters we
[1:07:21] might just get stuck with what is
[1:07:23] written there
[1:07:24] praise the Lord as you recede in the
[1:07:26] scripture I'll bring that to you this
[1:07:29] morning now to get ahead of myself but
[1:07:31] you will see in the scripture that I was
[1:07:33] studying yesterday or studying on this
[1:07:35] and I was I was it just it just it just
[1:07:39] blew my mind I was I was saying wow
[1:07:42] there was something in God's mind
[1:07:45] Sarah was barren
[1:07:48] Rebecca was barren
[1:07:50] Richard Jacob's beloved wife was Baron
[1:07:55] but yet God would come to his people and
[1:07:57] says there will be no male or female
[1:07:59] Barren ammonia so what was God's
[1:08:02] thinking
[1:08:03] what did God allow that
[1:08:09] let's stand on our feet
[1:08:17] Genesis chapter 30.
[1:08:22] foreign
[1:08:40] so we we were kind of do a little a
[1:08:43] little bit of a Bible study
[1:08:45] unless you get me excited then I would
[1:08:47] start preaching amen
[1:08:50] if you if you if you if you control your
[1:08:54] emotion I will behave myself
[1:08:59] if you control your emotion I will
[1:09:02] behave myself
[1:09:05] praise the Lord Genesis Chapter 30 let's
[1:09:08] read together
[1:09:16] and when Rachel saw that she beared
[1:09:18] Jacob no children
[1:09:21] Rachel anything
[1:09:24] call sister
[1:09:25] that's another word that will shock you
[1:09:28] this morning
[1:09:30] I was looking through the the I was
[1:09:32] looking through many commentary
[1:09:33] yesterday
[1:09:35] and and and and and most of the
[1:09:38] commentators all do it on envy and
[1:09:42] jealousy
[1:09:43] envy and jealousy
[1:09:46] but uh uh yeah let's let's just read
[1:09:51] and then uh
[1:09:53] Richard Envy her sister and said unto
[1:09:56] Jacob give me children
[1:10:00] OS I die
[1:10:03] and Jacob's anger was counted against
[1:10:06] Rachel
[1:10:07] and he said am I engulfsted
[1:10:13] in another word am I God
[1:10:17] praise the Lord
[1:10:18] I wish he knew that he was falling
[1:10:22] I wish he knew that one time Adam won't
[1:10:25] say that
[1:10:31] praise the Lord
[1:10:34] it is the Fallen nature
[1:10:37] that make us all wish to respond like
[1:10:39] that who am I
[1:10:42] is a falling nature in us that will
[1:10:45] always make us even though we know that
[1:10:47] we are redeemed we are safe we are born
[1:10:50] again
[1:10:52] but there is just something in US
[1:10:55] that will always step us back to say
[1:10:58] Lord who am I
[1:11:07] and Jacob anger was scattered against
[1:11:09] Richard and he said am I in ghost State
[1:11:13] who have we held thee who have withheld
[1:11:16] from Thee the fruit of the womb
[1:11:18] praise the Lord
[1:11:21] let us pray Heavenly Father we write

[1:12:22] Genesis chapter 15 where
[1:12:25] Abraham said also to God saying that I
[1:12:28] go childless

[1:16:34] and the Earth was barren
[1:16:39] with no form of life
[1:16:43] praise the Lord
[1:16:45] it was on the
[1:16:48] a rolling ocean covered with Darkness
[1:16:51] but the spirit of God
[1:16:54] was moving over the waters
[1:16:57] praise the Lord
[1:16:59] amen
[1:17:00] a year is God now you have to realize
[1:17:03] there is there is there is a lot of
[1:17:05] parallel between creation and Redemption
[1:17:08] we have spoke on that before you can see
[1:17:11] the picture if you really look at
[1:17:14] creation yeah you can see the picture of
[1:17:16] redemption
[1:17:18] because brother Branham taught us the
[1:17:20] same way that God deals with the Earth
[1:17:21] that's the way he deals with his people
[1:17:23] future whom now
[1:17:26] uh in in in the message uh
[1:17:30] what what does it takes to make
[1:17:32] Christian Life brother Brandon would say
[1:17:33] that which of course is something that
[1:17:35] is familiar with us he will say now I
[1:17:38] want you to notice in the beginning when
[1:17:40] when God our Father looked over this
[1:17:44] blind Earth he says it was it wasn't
[1:17:48] nothing but one Great Big Board of Water
[1:17:53] and God sent the Holy Spirit to the
[1:17:57] Earth
[1:17:58] the logos that went out of God
[1:18:02] and they begin to brood over the earth
[1:18:06] now the word brood means to make love
[1:18:11] praise the Lord
[1:18:13] or just like like the dwarf took hold
[1:18:17] and the Holy Spirit covered the Earth
[1:18:21] as a mental picture we are going to make
[1:18:24] it like
[1:18:25] the wind with a great Wing around the
[1:18:30] earth and Broad making love calling come
[1:18:34] come the father has ordained you come
[1:18:38] what was he calling to the seeds that
[1:18:40] were in the Earth
[1:18:42] praise the Lord the father has ordained
[1:18:45] you rise up rise to your potential amen
[1:18:48] rise to your ability
[1:18:50] the father have ordained you come I'm
[1:18:54] coming to perform what the father word
[1:18:57] has said
[1:18:59] and verbraham says there that's the
[1:19:01] power of transformation
[1:19:03] amen the power of transformation is that
[1:19:07] God just bring the seed that is in you
[1:19:09] he brings the potential that is in you
[1:19:14] it's now being is now being transformed
[1:19:17] from Peak to lamb no
[1:19:23] it's bringing out the lament nature in
[1:19:27] you being able to make us to produce
[1:19:29] world so we can be shared amen so those
[1:19:33] wool can be given out
[1:19:35] that's what it is so the Holy Spirit was
[1:19:38] brawling over the Earth making love
[1:19:40] because the Earth was buried
[1:19:44] but yet there were seeds in the Earth
[1:19:48] yeah that's a paradox
[1:19:51] but we're going to go that street as we
[1:19:53] as we just want to take our time and and
[1:19:57] study this together
[1:19:58] praise the lord we want to take our time
[1:20:01] and study this together so we we are
[1:20:04] looking at this at this uh a scene in
[1:20:07] Genesis Chapter 30 where uh uh we know
[1:20:11] the story there that Jacob uh uh uh
[1:20:15] Rachel was his first love
[1:20:18] amen Rachel was his first love so the
[1:20:23] custom of the land hired him to take
[1:20:25] Leah but he loved Rachel
[1:20:28] man and we we know all the story we see
[1:20:31] everything that is played out there and
[1:20:34] uh and and and the scripture says uh uh
[1:20:38] uh richer
[1:20:41] and they her sister let's look at that a
[1:20:43] little bit yeah I went dead into the
[1:20:45] strong into the the the the the strong
[1:20:49] uh concordance to be able to bring out
[1:20:52] that word envy uh the Primitive roof
[1:20:55] word
[1:20:57] it goes back to the word of
[1:21:00] zelius
[1:21:04] to be zealous
[1:21:07] xelius okay
[1:21:11] now a house in about sense it has the
[1:21:14] word jealousy
[1:21:16] and being envious
[1:21:20] but in the the death sense The Roots
[1:21:23] Saints now this this this kind of blew
[1:21:26] my mind last night I will tell you if if
[1:21:29] you do if you do blow your mind to then
[1:21:31] I think you and myself we are at the
[1:21:33] same place
[1:21:34] because I'm I'm looking at this and uh
[1:21:40] uh to realize
[1:21:45] the depth of thought that is behind this
[1:21:48] that God is playing out something here
[1:21:52] and then on the surface in the blending
[1:21:56] of our human nature it looks like we are
[1:21:59] in control it looks like we are making
[1:22:01] decisions it looks like we are doing you
[1:22:04] know what we think is right to do but
[1:22:07] there is a very strong thought that is
[1:22:10] behind
[1:22:12] Our Lives
[1:22:15] praise the Lord
[1:22:17] amen so and when you look at the the the
[1:22:19] the root sense of this word meaning to
[1:22:23] be zealous
[1:22:25] you can see it
[1:22:27] now let's let's take a scripture that uh
[1:22:30] that I attached to this that is in
[1:22:32] Numbers chapter 25 11 the Bible said
[1:22:35] Finney has the son of Ella is that the
[1:22:38] son of Aaron the priests have turned my
[1:22:41] wrath
[1:22:42] away from the children of Israel why he
[1:22:46] was Alias for my sake among them that
[1:22:50] icons that are that I consume not the
[1:22:53] children of Israel in my jealousy
[1:22:56] so God is saying here in my jealousy I
[1:23:01] will have consumed them I will have got
[1:23:03] rid of them but there was a man that was
[1:23:05] zealia so so uh fenny has zealousness
[1:23:10] was expressing God's jealousy
[1:23:15] so when God when Paul says I'm jealous
[1:23:19] over you with Godly jealousy it means
[1:23:22] that I have a Zeal over you
[1:23:26] I'm zealous for you to come to be a
[1:23:29] Chase virgin unto Christ
[1:23:33] and I'll take it in a common sense it
[1:23:35] will help you yeah
[1:23:37] praise the Lord
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:42] I walk in this morning I saw brother Dan
[1:23:44] vehicle I told him I said brother damn
[1:23:46] I'm jealous foreign
[1:23:55] it's not evil right
[1:23:58] right the jealousy that you don't
[1:24:00] express
[1:24:03] the one that you don't say
[1:24:06] that you that you your eyes is saying
[1:24:08] everything you're about your mouth can
[1:24:10] talk
[1:24:16] have everybody have anybody told you I'm
[1:24:18] I'm aware of you
[1:24:21] everybody say that to you
[1:24:23] praise the Lord
[1:24:25] and most of the time when people say
[1:24:27] that to you it's more like a compliment
[1:24:30] a sense of appreciation
[1:24:32] I want to be like you
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:40] is the one that we don't say that's the
[1:24:42] one that is dangerous
[1:24:44] when we don't have the ability to say it
[1:24:48] and it's just eating us in our mind
[1:24:56] that's right
[1:24:58] praise the Lord so let's go back to the
[1:25:01] scripture here because I want us to see
[1:25:03] the richness of the scripture the
[1:25:05] richness of the scripture
[1:25:08] the Bible says and Rachel saw that she
[1:25:11] did Jacob no children
[1:25:13] she Envy her sister
[1:25:16] and said unto Jacob give me children
[1:25:19] lest I die I mean for her to come and
[1:25:22] hold that guy by the front of his water
[1:25:25] that's the pains for gown or whatever he
[1:25:27] was wearing I don't believe that she
[1:25:29] just said it lightly and I believe that
[1:25:31] she was very roughed on him
[1:25:34] and say giving children
[1:25:36] she she was caught up under something
[1:25:39] that that was beyond
[1:25:41] I believe she know you know Jacob is not
[1:25:44] God
[1:25:46] praise the Lord I believe she knows that
[1:25:48] she don't need Jacob to preach another
[1:25:50] message to her
[1:25:52] but she was on a an inspiration
[1:25:57] praise the Lord she was honor and
[1:26:00] inspiration is the same inspiration that
[1:26:03] you get honor when you say God I need
[1:26:05] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:07] praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is a
[1:26:10] promise unto you
[1:26:12] amen are you begging God for the holy
[1:26:14] God no you are not begging it's an
[1:26:16] inspiration that comes on you Lord I
[1:26:19] want to be more like you God I want the
[1:26:21] Holy Ghost I want a life change
[1:26:29] praise the Lord
[1:26:34] let's let's drop down yeah
[1:26:38] and then uh
[1:26:40] let's drop down to uh
[1:26:45] verse 8.
[1:26:49] I want to take my time so we can
[1:26:52] appreciate the scripture
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:01] now you will realize after that
[1:27:05] the Bible says and then then Rachel she
[1:27:08] took her her mad seven and uh uh uh be
[1:27:12] hot and she gave she gave her own to her
[1:27:15] husband and and Dan was born and and uh
[1:27:19] and then uh
[1:27:21] again in verse 7 uh and then she had
[1:27:25] another son
[1:27:26] uh in in verse 7 and we have Rachel's
[1:27:30] made conceive again and bear Jacob a
[1:27:32] second son now listen to this now verse
[1:27:35] 8 and Rachel said
[1:27:38] with great Roslyn
[1:27:41] have I Razzle with my sister
[1:27:45] praise the Lord
[1:27:47] and I have prevailed
[1:27:51] for which course she named the boy
[1:27:54] Nathalie now so you see yeah the
[1:27:58] scripture says she Envy her sister
[1:28:02] amen but yeah again now she's she's
[1:28:06] having a child that she's adopting from
[1:28:09] her man she's also expressing something
[1:28:12] that I have wrestled with my sister
[1:28:16] praise the Lord
[1:28:18] now
[1:28:19] let's let's uh let's take uh
[1:28:23] uh
[1:28:25] the Amplified version of that
[1:28:29] let's take the amplifier version of that
[1:28:31] I should have there right right on the
[1:28:33] the first verse there
[1:28:36] hmm
[1:28:39] the scripture says so Rachel said
[1:28:43] with mighty razzling now the Amplified
[1:28:47] have it in prayer to God
[1:28:56] amen
[1:28:57] with Mighty razzling in prayer to God I
[1:29:01] have struggled with my sister and I
[1:29:04] prevail
[1:29:07] so so the feeling that she was having
[1:29:10] the expression that she was having it
[1:29:14] was not in an evil sense
[1:29:16] sure when she was razzling with her
[1:29:19] sister is is that uh she she seen her
[1:29:22] sister having child she's needing child
[1:29:24] but her heart was towards God oh God
[1:29:27] when my time when will they be mine
[1:29:30] praise the Lord now that was the same
[1:29:33] thing that happened to Hannah
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:37] she rise up with God
[1:29:44] are we together
[1:29:47] so you see there is there is a there's a
[1:29:50] thought that God is expressing you there
[1:29:53] is something that he's bringing out of
[1:29:55] his mind and he's playing it in the life
[1:29:58] in the character of these people
[1:30:01] praise the Lord amen we have seen it as
[1:30:04] the attitude I mean you could just read
[1:30:07] the scripture right there and says well
[1:30:08] she's supposed to be happy for her
[1:30:10] sister
[1:30:11] why was she jealous
[1:30:14] but she was more than just jealous
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] amen
[1:30:21] she was more than just jealous
[1:30:26] because there is something that you have
[1:30:28] to understand about the about the Hebrew
[1:30:32] women
[1:30:35] the heart and intense
[1:30:39] desire
[1:30:42] and attains anxiousness
[1:30:46] for children
[1:30:49] because of the promise of the promise
[1:30:52] see
[1:30:55] because of that promise
[1:31:00] she they always had
[1:31:02] an intense desire
[1:31:05] to be able to bring forth
[1:31:08] are we together
[1:31:10] so we're traveling here
[1:31:13] we're traveling I'm trying to do my best
[1:31:15] now to not to get out of track here but
[1:31:18] so we see here that richer expression
[1:31:25] give me children
[1:31:26] Lisa dying
[1:31:29] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] Jeremiah over in Jeremiah chapter 15 uh
[1:31:36] chapter 31.
[1:31:38] he would take that expression
[1:31:43] that's where the saying will come from
[1:31:45] richer weeping for her children
[1:31:51] at the time Jesus will be born in
[1:31:54] Matthew chapter 2.
[1:31:57] this the slaughter of the children
[1:32:00] but Hera will will that prophecy will
[1:32:03] rise back on the scene and says
[1:32:05] according to what Jeremiah said
[1:32:09] praise the Lord
[1:32:11] amen so it gave us an idea that Rachel
[1:32:16] cry gave me children
[1:32:19] it was it was from a deep expression not
[1:32:23] just only uh Hassan Joseph and Benjamin
[1:32:26] that she was Desiring for but it was
[1:32:29] coming from a place it's almost like um
[1:32:32] David in the temple saying my God my God
[1:32:35] why have that forsake Him in and he
[1:32:38] never had no idea that this would be the
[1:32:40] very same word
[1:32:42] that Jesus will say on the cross
[1:32:50] the Lord
[1:32:54] says Those Old Testament character many
[1:32:57] times they were placed in situation
[1:33:00] yeah job there that are being an Earnest
[1:33:03] man a man that fear God he had such a
[1:33:06] testimony such a repetition among his
[1:33:09] people with no idea God is going to set
[1:33:13] his life up for the for for for for uh
[1:33:16] and you know and an eternal example
[1:33:22] of the choices that God sometimes made
[1:33:25] for his people
[1:33:26] living happily
[1:33:29] saving his people serving his children
[1:33:31] doing everything that he knows right
[1:33:36] and God is bringing the enemy to a
[1:33:38] challenge have you seen my seventh job
[1:33:41] is there any man like him and yet God
[1:33:44] never told job anything
[1:33:49] praise the Lord
[1:33:51] Hallelujah I'm sure God never told you
[1:33:53] anything also
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:02] I never told you anything never told you
[1:34:04] you'd be here this morning
[1:34:06] God told you I will be preaching
[1:34:10] amen
[1:34:16] so we have to realize we have to realize
[1:34:20] and and that is the that is the evil of
[1:34:23] religion because it stopped us on the
[1:34:26] Black and White Plains we have to know
[1:34:28] that this word comes from the mind of
[1:34:31] God it has a very deep and intense
[1:34:34] thought
[1:34:38] that's the reason why you cannot take a
[1:34:40] verse and make a Doctrine out of it
[1:34:46] because as the heaven is higher than the
[1:34:49] earth so are his thoughts
[1:34:52] higher than our thoughts
[1:35:00] yeah I like to look in the mind of God
[1:35:01] my goodness
[1:35:03] praise the Lord when you look in in the
[1:35:06] word and the word is breaking out like
[1:35:07] this you say oh my oh my what what a God
[1:35:11] we have
[1:35:16] what a God we have
[1:35:19] praise the Lord
[1:35:20] oh God called Abraham and promise him
[1:35:24] I'll make you the father of nation
[1:35:27] and yet he withhold his wife
[1:35:31] from having children how is she going to
[1:35:33] be
[1:35:36] praise the Lord how how is she going to
[1:35:39] be the father of nation or are he going
[1:35:41] to be the father of nation and she's
[1:35:43] going to be the mother of nation how
[1:35:46] how was this going to happen but you see
[1:35:49] the thing about it there is that God was
[1:35:52] more interested in the fake children in
[1:35:56] the children that would come by faith
[1:35:59] the children that faith will give birth
[1:36:01] talk he was more interested in the fake
[1:36:05] children than Abraham just having bunch
[1:36:08] of children and they have no connection
[1:36:10] with God
[1:36:14] that's the reason why God is more
[1:36:16] interested in the things that you do by
[1:36:19] faith that you do by faith and by the
[1:36:22] word and just anything you do in your
[1:36:24] life
[1:36:30] he was interested in the faith children
[1:36:34] the children that faith will produce
[1:36:41] praise the Lord
[1:36:43] the children that holding on to God
[1:36:47] because those things that you trusted
[1:36:49] God for
[1:36:51] they never leave you
[1:36:54] praise the Lord they never leave you
[1:36:59] those things you experience with God
[1:37:01] they never leave you
[1:37:04] you might go to school and you know and
[1:37:06] learn and get out of the degree you
[1:37:08] don't remember everything the teacher
[1:37:09] told you
[1:37:14] you get this start before you get the
[1:37:16] job you want training
[1:37:18] why you don't go and bring all your
[1:37:20] textbooks
[1:37:22] drag it to school to work
[1:37:25] say what is that these are all my texts
[1:37:27] boy I'm going to use this book and get
[1:37:28] this job done
[1:37:31] praise the Lord
[1:37:33] amen you might spend the whole next
[1:37:36] three months passing pages
[1:37:40] and that's how they will fire you
[1:37:45] praise the Lord
[1:37:47] so we see here in Genesis chapter 11
[1:37:49] verse tell it Sarah
[1:37:53] was barring
[1:37:55] Genesis chapter 25
[1:37:57] verse 20 to 22 Rebecca was buried that's
[1:38:02] how the scripture says the scripture
[1:38:04] says it she was Barren 0 was Barren
[1:38:07] Rebecca was buried
[1:38:08] Genesis 29
[1:38:12] for steady one
[1:38:14] richer
[1:38:15] was barring
[1:38:18] what is this
[1:38:19] these are all
[1:38:21] the Patriots these are all the wife of
[1:38:25] the Patriots
[1:38:29] praise the Lord
[1:38:32] amen now you see sometimes we try to
[1:38:35] apply our mind which of course brother
[1:38:38] Branham called that the canary brain
[1:38:40] you know people always say Sir Abraham
[1:38:42] told Allah Sarah was Barren before
[1:38:44] Abraham told a lie
[1:38:48] praise the Lord oh Isaac to Eli that
[1:38:51] Rebecca was already bowing before Isaac
[1:38:53] took Isaac took a lie before uh uh uh
[1:38:57] you know uh she was already in that
[1:38:59] state he says well Jacob was uh
[1:39:01] mischievous and all of those things is
[1:39:04] the representation of Saint John chapter
[1:39:07] 9.
[1:39:10] when the eyes Jesus uh you know about by
[1:39:13] whose sin is this man born blind
[1:39:17] we are not able to go back and see what
[1:39:21] was in God's mind what did God allow
[1:39:24] what he allowed we always try to touch
[1:39:27] some kind of a strain
[1:39:31] to sin
[1:39:33] we always try to to when when we fish
[1:39:37] out in our life
[1:39:39] we're always looking to grasp him
[1:39:43] why is this happening to me what have I
[1:39:45] done
[1:39:46] maybe not me
[1:39:48] that name on something maybe my
[1:39:50] mama was fishing out for sin
[1:39:53] [Laughter]
[1:39:55] glory be to God Amen
[1:40:02] praise the Lord
[1:40:05] amen
[1:40:09] but you see something will happen
[1:40:10] something will change here
[1:40:12] Amen in Genesis chapter 41
[1:40:17] reading from verse 49 to 42 you can read
[1:40:20] there the Bible says here and unto
[1:40:23] Joseph was born two sons before the year
[1:40:29] of farming
[1:40:32] when it came to Joseph the story changed
[1:40:38] his wife was not buried
[1:40:42] well change it
[1:40:45] Moses the picture changed
[1:40:49] both of them married a gentle bride
[1:40:58] praise the Lord
[1:40:59] amen so you see that God had a deep
[1:41:04] expression in his mind how barrenness
[1:41:08] who have come by the Lord
[1:41:11] that's the reason why the Apostle Paul
[1:41:14] said over and over nor flesh will be
[1:41:17] justified
[1:41:18] by the Lord
[1:41:24] that's the reason why God and I gave his
[1:41:26] people law from the beginning
[1:41:28] it was Grace from the beginning Grace
[1:41:30] doing the Lord and Grace after the Lord
[1:41:38] these are the Patriots
[1:41:41] these are the Patriots father
[1:41:44] the father of Faith the people that God
[1:41:47] was using for foundation storm
[1:41:51] but each of their wife came out
[1:41:54] Baron
[1:41:55] but when it came to Joseph there was a
[1:41:59] type of Christ
[1:42:04] the Lord
[1:42:09] are we together
[1:42:15] Paul expressed that over and over
[1:42:18] right in Galatians chapter 4 he speaks
[1:42:21] of that
[1:42:22] how uh uh we are children of of
[1:42:25] Jerusalem he used he used Hagar and
[1:42:29] Sarah as a type of the of the old
[1:42:31] Covenant he says but we are born of
[1:42:33] Jerusalem we are free we're in there in
[1:42:36] Romans chapter 3 20 he talks about about
[1:42:38] the Lord no flesh shall be justified he
[1:42:41] also speak of that in Galatians Chapter
[1:42:43] 2 by the Lord no flesh will be justified
[1:42:49] so God had a very deep thought in his
[1:42:53] mind
[1:42:54] what Grace was going to do for us let's
[1:42:56] look at Deuteronomy chapter 7.
[1:43:00] praise the Lord don't worry I have not
[1:43:02] started preaching yet
[1:43:09] I have not started preaching yet
[1:43:12] I'm just trying to find a place to stand
[1:43:16] determine chapter seven let's read verse
[1:43:19] 12. wherefore it shall come to pass if
[1:43:23] ye hear King
[1:43:24] to these judgments and keep them and do
[1:43:28] them
[1:43:29] that the Lord thy God shall keep thee
[1:43:33] from no he shall he shall he the Lord
[1:43:36] thy God shall I keep unto thee the
[1:43:39] Covenant and the mercy which he swear
[1:43:42] unto thy father
[1:43:43] and he will love thee and will bless
[1:43:47] thee and will multiply thee
[1:43:51] he will also bless the fruit of the
[1:43:54] woman and and the fruit of the land that
[1:43:58] come that wind and oil any CR and the
[1:44:02] increase of the Kings and and the and
[1:44:05] the flux all the ships in the land which
[1:44:08] his word unto thy father
[1:44:11] Thou shalt be blessed above all people
[1:44:13] there shall not be male or female
[1:44:17] bearing
[1:44:18] among you
[1:44:20] or among your counters I love that
[1:44:25] Judges chapter 13 verse 3 the Bible said
[1:44:28] Manoa and his wife was barren
[1:44:33] hmm
[1:44:35] praise the Lord
[1:44:37] my Noah and his wife was Byron that is
[1:44:39] just after they have come over to the
[1:44:41] land now this is where God is giving
[1:44:43] them a promise
[1:44:45] he's giving them a promise here
[1:44:48] and yeah we've seen we're seeing this
[1:44:50] pattern and and and and and and if you
[1:44:52] can look at it you you just look I think
[1:44:55] about it now the scripture I believe
[1:44:57] there were many other people uh uh in in
[1:45:00] Bible days that was that were that were
[1:45:03] in that condition but God the scripture
[1:45:06] always mentioned these people that had a
[1:45:09] promise attached to them
[1:45:12] praise the Lord just like how God had a
[1:45:17] purpose for the Earth
[1:45:19] not for Mars not for Jupiter
[1:45:22] now for any Planet but he had a purpose
[1:45:25] for the Earth
[1:45:29] and to be able to bring out this purple
[1:45:31] of life in the Earth
[1:45:34] the Earth has to First be in a Barren
[1:45:37] State that's the same way you will see
[1:45:40] that all of these people Sarah she had a
[1:45:42] promise
[1:45:45] to bring forth the promised son
[1:45:48] Isaac there will be a type of Christ
[1:45:50] Rebecca she had a promise two Nation
[1:45:53] will be in your womb
[1:45:56] the kind of seed and the spiritual seed
[1:45:58] uh uh
[1:46:01] uh uh richer also had a promise she will
[1:46:05] give birth to her last son that will be
[1:46:07] a son of of of of Sorrow to the son of
[1:46:11] the right hand
[1:46:12] that's why Benjamin was he was born the
[1:46:15] son of sorrow but he became the son of
[1:46:18] the father's right hand
[1:46:20] so to all these people the heart a
[1:46:24] promise they had some kind of a
[1:46:26] spiritual attachment to them but yet
[1:46:28] they had to go through a period of
[1:46:30] dryness
[1:46:36] are we together
[1:46:38] you have to go through a time of farming
[1:46:40] you know I was reading last night and it
[1:46:43] it kind of blessed my mind because you
[1:46:45] will see that the Bible the Bible place
[1:46:48] it in the word it says and unto Jacob
[1:46:51] we're born two sons before the years of
[1:46:55] farming
[1:46:57] so just before baroness came on the
[1:47:00] saying God bless Jacob or Joseph
[1:47:07] breaking the curse of barrenness
[1:47:12] because it's Theory means God's word
[1:47:14] it's still remain God's promise to his
[1:47:16] people that there will be no barring
[1:47:21] that word Still Remains the truth
[1:47:25] you believe it
[1:47:26] yeah it Still Remains truth
[1:47:29] Hallelujah
[1:47:36] because the way that God looked at
[1:47:38] productiveness is very far from the way
[1:47:41] our kind of mind thinks about
[1:47:42] productiveness
[1:47:45] praise the Lord
[1:47:47] amen
[1:47:48] the way God taught about
[1:47:51] replenish the Earth
[1:47:54] is more than what our mind thinks
[1:47:58] foreign
[1:48:00] Hallelujah
[1:48:01] amen oh that's the reason why the the
[1:48:05] Bible who says us sing and rejoice all
[1:48:08] barren
[1:48:10] for many other children of the
[1:48:12] adulterous woman we will come to that
[1:48:14] it's part of my notes
[1:48:20] because what the father what is in God's
[1:48:22] mind
[1:48:23] concerning reproduction concerning
[1:48:27] replenishing the Earth
[1:48:30] it's far away from what the human thinks
[1:48:36] there is nothing that please the father
[1:48:39] nothing
[1:48:42] the purpose of creation the purpose of
[1:48:46] creation Remains the Same as the purpose
[1:48:49] of redemption
[1:48:53] praise the Lord
[1:48:55] are we together
[1:49:01] ah yeah yeah
[1:49:02] let me jump ahead of myself a little bit
[1:49:04] here
[1:49:05] Jesus it's in John chapter 15.
[1:49:09] whether he says I am the vine you are
[1:49:12] the branches
[1:49:13] he revealed what is the purpose of the
[1:49:16] father what is the deep thought of the
[1:49:18] father
[1:49:23] what the father in joy
[1:49:27] if anybody bring that fruit he's cut off
[1:49:31] he's caught up in his good for burning
[1:49:36] the father from the verse So Divine can
[1:49:40] be able to be productive
[1:49:45] so what the father looks for
[1:49:48] in the vine what he looks for in the
[1:49:50] earth what he looks for in his people is
[1:49:53] to be able to be productive
[1:49:59] praise the Lord is to be able to
[1:50:01] reproduce that's the reason why Philip
[1:50:05] could say to that to that Jailer believe
[1:50:08] in the Lord Jesus you and your household
[1:50:10] will be safe but I'm saying what is that
[1:50:12] he says the Sin the same faith that
[1:50:15] brought that men to Salvation
[1:50:17] amen will be reproduced and I was
[1:50:21] worried that the church in Philippi was
[1:50:22] born
[1:50:24] you read the book of Philippians that
[1:50:26] word that church was born
[1:50:31] it's God's way of reproduction
[1:50:35] he didn't save us for us to be to to
[1:50:37] think that we are special people then
[1:50:40] the rest of the people in the world
[1:50:42] no the purpose of Salvation is for us to
[1:50:46] be productive
[1:50:51] your faith in your heart must be able to
[1:50:53] reproduce
[1:50:55] oh you might not be able to go to Uganda
[1:50:57] I'll go over the seas right in your
[1:50:59] house because the commission says begin
[1:51:02] at Jerusalem
[1:51:03] Jerusalem is your house
[1:51:07] amen Jerusalem is your house
[1:51:12] our faith must be able to impart our
[1:51:15] relationship
[1:51:18] it must be able to impart when people
[1:51:20] start using faith
[1:51:23] to destroy their relationship and to
[1:51:25] think that they are pleasing God you are
[1:51:27] completely out of the word of God
[1:51:33] when you start using faith
[1:51:36] to cut away from from family call away
[1:51:38] from from uh from from relative and and
[1:51:41] you think you are in a word of God if
[1:51:43] your faith we're carrying you towards on
[1:51:45] a stream
[1:51:48] that you cannot even greet people and
[1:51:51] and you just look at them up and down
[1:51:53] something is wrong in your soul you
[1:51:55] better get to the altar quickly that's
[1:51:57] what I will advise you
[1:52:03] you want to go a missionary trip
[1:52:07] praise the Lord
[1:52:09] you want to go on missionary tribe you
[1:52:11] want to be in fact effective
[1:52:15] impress your home
[1:52:19] amen
[1:52:21] impress your clothes surrounding
[1:52:27] what Grace is doing in our life must be
[1:52:30] able
[1:52:31] to affect the people around us
[1:52:33] they might not believe
[1:52:36] praise the Lord they might not believe
[1:52:38] right away
[1:52:42] but they will come to that place of
[1:52:43] being convinced that I know my child is
[1:52:46] right
[1:52:49] oh I know my parents is right
[1:52:57] let's think of how faith has destroyed
[1:53:00] homes and destroyed families
[1:53:03] and we are getting ready for the rapture
[1:53:07] that's the reason why the Rapture is not
[1:53:09] an individual trait
[1:53:11] foreign
[1:53:14] travel on the Rapture is going to be a
[1:53:17] family trip
[1:53:20] now we wish that I alive
[1:53:23] amen wish we that are alive we're in any
[1:53:27] word until they come up first
[1:53:29] and join us it's a family trip
[1:53:35] praise the Lord so when you park in your
[1:53:38] bag make sure the other people's bags
[1:53:39] are packed
[1:53:50] right what is in the father's mind
[1:53:52] what is he thinking about
[1:53:54] yeah we see through the scripture Manoa
[1:53:57] and his wife is Byron but yet through
[1:54:00] them the deliverer the man that is going
[1:54:02] to destroy the Philistines
[1:54:04] is going to come through them
[1:54:06] the one that will raise up the gate the
[1:54:09] man whose name when his mission
[1:54:12] praise the Lord
[1:54:14] even the animals that don't hear the
[1:54:16] names of the Philistines starts to run
[1:54:18] because everybody is running so the
[1:54:21] Animals still start running they don't
[1:54:22] know what the people running for
[1:54:24] you just mentioned something is coming
[1:54:26] what a terror what a name that God
[1:54:29] raised up the very purpose that he was
[1:54:32] born
[1:54:38] but he came from a parent they were
[1:54:40] there were barren
[1:54:45] are we together
[1:54:46] the man I would change the course of
[1:54:48] history
[1:54:50] he would change the course of history
[1:54:52] when there was no Opie Vision in Israel
[1:54:55] no vision
[1:54:58] but God will raise up a little boy just
[1:55:03] from a little age about three two years
[1:55:05] old
[1:55:07] he would start hearing the voice of God
[1:55:11] praise the Lord
[1:55:14] but that child was born
[1:55:18] from a woman Hannah that was buried
[1:55:24] and how many night and day that she
[1:55:26] cried to God or if you can just if I can
[1:55:29] just Own It experience childbirth I will
[1:55:33] give that child to you
[1:55:37] praise the Lord
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:41] God was using Hannah to show how the
[1:55:45] land of Israel was buried because there
[1:55:48] was no Prophet on the land God was using
[1:55:51] her life if Eli was just sensible to
[1:55:55] read beyond the letters
[1:55:57] he would know that she was not drunk she
[1:56:01] was a desperate woman she was a woman
[1:56:03] that was zealous for the Lord
[1:56:06] and God used the the expression from her
[1:56:11] sword
[1:56:18] that's the reason why
[1:56:21] we cry to God and we pray to God
[1:56:25] but yet he looked at our motives and
[1:56:28] objectives
[1:56:31] praise the Lord you can stay all night
[1:56:34] of crying and do everything you want to
[1:56:36] do if you're motive and objective is
[1:56:39] Savage come on now your tears will
[1:56:42] flowing dry on your face
[1:56:55] glory be to God
[1:57:04] he has a woman here
[1:57:07] she says I'm okay with my people
[1:57:10] we call her a successful businesswoman
[1:57:13] she's doing well her husband doing well
[1:57:16] and they are living happy
[1:57:18] you know once in a child they have got
[1:57:20] over there it was not a problem in their
[1:57:22] home
[1:57:23] and yet a prophet came by
[1:57:27] praise the Lord
[1:57:29] and she saw there was something about
[1:57:31] this man and she had a place in her home
[1:57:33] and set a room there and invited him in
[1:57:36] and give him food and and he got a good
[1:57:38] bath and had a good rest
[1:57:41] baby never slept in a decent home
[1:57:45] like that woman home was
[1:57:47] because she was a woman that was doing
[1:57:49] well she said I mean you want to talk
[1:57:51] about meeting the king no I know how to
[1:57:54] get to him
[1:57:55] praise the Lord
[1:57:57] my husband he said he's he's I mean he
[1:57:59] he has contact
[1:58:01] so I gave you a favor over the king the
[1:58:03] the the the prophet said she said no
[1:58:05] that's not what I want
[1:58:08] okay here's I said but I realized I've
[1:58:10] not seen a baby picture on the wall
[1:58:15] I looked through their home I've not
[1:58:18] seen a baby picture
[1:58:21] praise the Lord and he had never said
[1:58:24] anything about my child has gone to
[1:58:26] school or my son is in college they
[1:58:28] never say anything like that
[1:58:33] like that praise the Lord
[1:58:37] God will reward her
[1:58:39] not wave money
[1:58:43] now we have contact but God will reward
[1:58:46] hug with the fruit of life
[1:58:54] foreign
[1:58:58] amen God will reward her because in that
[1:59:02] woman was a substance
[1:59:04] she had a substance faith in her
[1:59:09] substance faith that she had in her she

[1:59:34] place

[1:59:38] for the fact that she could identify
[1:59:40] that this was the man of God
[1:59:43] and something in our heart could make a
[1:59:46] provision could make a risk to make a
[1:59:48] comfort for him in All was a substance
[1:59:51] fact and God was going to bring it out

[2:04:06] just walk on the street messing linga
[2:04:08] must be restored and and we make all of
[2:04:12] these fantasy when we don't even have
[2:04:14] the character behind it
[2:04:16] we are just looking for public city
[2:04:20] we are looking for public city so we can
[2:04:23] get down and condemn all the
[2:04:24] denominations when we are doing the very
[2:04:26] same thing that they are doing
[2:04:32] all that people will say well nothing is
[2:04:34] happening in the message we just make
[2:04:36] all of these things all of these things
[2:04:37] and all of these things it's just
[2:04:39] deadness and dryness everywhere don't
[2:04:42] worry
[2:04:43] don't worry
[2:04:47] praise the Lord
[2:04:48] Hallelujah yeah oh my God you love the
[2:04:53] Lord this morning
[2:04:54] amen
[2:04:55] praise the Lord
[2:04:57] Hallelujah
[2:05:00] no I'm just having a good time with
[2:05:02] Jesus
[2:05:03] I'm just having a good time you know
[2:05:05] that that's what Revelation does it just
[2:05:07] sends you into the deep thoughts of God
[2:05:10] it take you behind the letters
[2:05:13] they take you to the heart of the father
[2:05:22] it makes you to appreciate
[2:05:25] what God has done for you
[2:05:28] and the grace that have kept you
[2:05:31] and thinking of that you can say he's
[2:05:34] not finished with me
[2:05:36] he's not finished with me and I know
[2:05:38] there is something he's keeping me to do
[2:05:40] I know there's a Divine woman that is
[2:05:43] coming around the corner
[2:05:47] maybe there is somebody watching my life
[2:05:49] from a distance
[2:05:53] it's a Divine moment
[2:05:56] is coming
[2:05:58] Zacharias was faithful
[2:06:01] he was faithful he never threw in the
[2:06:03] tower because he never had a child he
[2:06:06] was faithful
[2:06:08] until the day that God spoke to him
[2:06:11] he lost speech
[2:06:14] because God blew his mind
[2:06:21] praise the Lord
[2:06:23] when God met him
[2:06:25] he lost speech
[2:06:30] praise the Lord
[2:06:32] I hope that God will meet us in this
[2:06:34] building
[2:06:35] now you will lose peace and start
[2:06:37] speaking in tongues that's what I'm
[2:06:39] looking for that your tongue will just
[2:06:41] start knocking to the roof of your mouth
[2:06:43] you don't even know what you are saying
[2:06:44] but the spirit of God is upon your life
[2:06:49] there are people speaking speaking
[2:06:51] tongues when they lose speech
[2:06:55] when they don't know what to say then
[2:06:57] you speak in tongues have you ever been
[2:06:59] in prayer and you don't know what to say
[2:07:01] and you are just there just just
[2:07:04] bubbling worse that don't even make
[2:07:06] sense
[2:07:10] covered
[2:07:13] oh my Hallelujah
[2:07:18] you love the Lord
[2:07:20] I mean I'm just having a good time this
[2:07:22] morning
[2:07:23] praise the Lord I think maybe you should
[2:07:25] have got another preacher here
[2:07:27] amen
[2:07:29] the one I can do that will make you
[2:07:31] excited
[2:07:32] and in order there you see there is
[2:07:35] there is something there is this thing
[2:07:37] in a scripture uh Exodus chapter 20.
[2:07:41] in line there uh in in in the combinance
[2:07:45] and uh is is uh uh thou shall not take
[2:07:49] the name of the Lord the Lord thy God in
[2:07:53] vain
[2:07:57] and how many times
[2:08:00] we have been taught in Sunday school you
[2:08:03] know is is the misusing
[2:08:05] of God's name
[2:08:07] in a way that says you know we must not
[2:08:10] curse using God's name we must not just
[2:08:13] use God's name any how but it's more
[2:08:16] than that
[2:08:18] it's more than that
[2:08:22] what is in God's mind concerning there
[2:08:26] your ambassadorship
[2:08:31] in God's mind
[2:08:33] what he's thinking about is that his
[2:08:36] people will be an ambassador
[2:08:40] it is not only in what they would say
[2:08:44] but their life their entire life
[2:08:49] that's the reason why we don't baptize
[2:08:51] in titles
[2:08:53] we take you down that water and baptize
[2:08:55] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:58] and when you Rise Up from the water you
[2:09:01] come up taking God's name
[2:09:04] praise the Lord and we expect you to
[2:09:07] take God's name in everything that you
[2:09:09] do that's why Paul said everything we do
[2:09:11] in words or base let's do it in the name
[2:09:14] of the Lord if you can't do it in the
[2:09:16] name of the Lord then don't do it
[2:09:19] because when you come out of that water
[2:09:21] you have become an ambassador
[2:09:30] an ambassadorship Paul will say the same
[2:09:33] thing second Timothy 2 19 let everyone
[2:09:36] that name the name of Christ
[2:09:39] he passed from iniquity
[2:09:43] be apart from iniquity
[2:09:45] and everyone that name the name of
[2:09:46] Christ will suffer persecution why
[2:09:49] because there's a power behind you
[2:10:00] are you seeing the father's thought
[2:10:03] what is in his mind
[2:10:10] what is in God's mind
[2:10:14] when he take us through a period of of
[2:10:17] of barrenness
[2:10:20] in our faith
[2:10:22] it almost looks like we we we we don't
[2:10:25] we don't have nothing to comfort
[2:10:31] praise the Lord
[2:10:34] oh being serving God all of these years
[2:10:36] you see that that uh the people the
[2:10:39] generation of our age I mean our age
[2:10:41] just loudly should Aid because of a
[2:10:43] loudish or Spirit no wonder there had
[2:10:46] never been a time of Prosperity Gospel
[2:10:49] preaching in this age because that's
[2:10:50] allowed this your spirit
[2:10:52] well where we reduce the blessings of
[2:10:55] God to material things perishable things
[2:11:01] perishable things
[2:11:04] and those are the things that we look
[2:11:05] for
[2:11:06] to be able to count God's blessing when
[2:11:09] men of all were looking for Souls that
[2:11:11] they brought to God how their lives
[2:11:17] Smith wigglewolf
[2:11:20] one time he told his daughter and his
[2:11:22] son-in-law
[2:11:23] his son married a missionary his
[2:11:26] daughter married a missionary sorry
[2:11:29] he told his uh his uh his daughter
[2:11:32] his son-in-law he called him he says I
[2:11:34] know you people are doing a good job
[2:11:36] trying to win the whole world he says
[2:11:39] but let me tell you
[2:11:41] don't win the whole world and let your
[2:11:42] children don't let my grandchildren go
[2:11:44] to hell right
[2:11:48] right praise the Lord he says we are
[2:11:50] winning the whole world don't let don't
[2:11:52] allow my grandchildren to go to hell
[2:11:55] why was he trying to tell them
[2:11:59] that's the commission it must begin at
[2:12:01] Jerusalem
[2:12:03] they must begin at Jerusalem it must
[2:12:05] affect our homes the home has evolved
[2:12:13] it must it must improve our parents and
[2:12:17] children relationship
[2:12:20] praise the Lord
[2:12:22] it must improve it
[2:12:24] that's the reason why they call him a
[2:12:26] one Berber because he was friends of
[2:12:29] sinners
[2:12:33] so don't say my children are not safe so
[2:12:35] I don't have relationship with them
[2:12:39] praise the Lord
[2:12:40] then you need to be safe also
[2:12:45] don't say my parents don't believe the
[2:12:47] message so damn I said we are not on
[2:12:49] good terms
[2:12:51] you need to be born again that's what I
[2:12:53] can tell you you need to be born again
[2:13:01] we pick up the Bible we listen to text
[2:13:03] and we then we start to become sassy
[2:13:07] praise the Lord when they are still
[2:13:10] paying the bills for us we are living
[2:13:12] under their Roof then we have all the
[2:13:14] courts on our arm to challenge the
[2:13:15] authority
[2:13:23] people that's not the message of the
[2:13:25] hour
[2:13:26] that's now the Saving Grace of Jesus
[2:13:28] Christ
[2:13:32] they must improve our relationship
[2:13:36] it must affect our relationship
[2:13:40] that's what he came to do this promise
[2:13:42] is unto you and to your children
[2:13:46] and to as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:13:49] call
[2:13:53] praise the Lord
[2:13:56] so if your parents are not safe and you
[2:13:58] have great relationship and they respect
[2:14:01] what you believe is a blessing yes it's
[2:14:04] a Revival
[2:14:06] if your children are not saved and you
[2:14:08] have great relationship with them it's
[2:14:10] our blessing
[2:14:12] you are not a savior he is the savior
[2:14:16] but you are one that has been saved and
[2:14:18] he has saved you
[2:14:21] so he can go through you
[2:14:23] and show them his love
[2:14:30] praise the Lord
[2:14:31] oh yeah
[2:14:36] you know what brother Branham says when
[2:14:37] he talks about Peter
[2:14:40] right there when now I converted
[2:14:44] strengthen your bread wings
[2:14:46] better man says he was prophesying to
[2:14:48] Peter about his death
[2:14:54] prophesying repeated about when he comes
[2:14:57] to his old age
[2:15:01] when he comes to his old age the ones
[2:15:05] that you leave will lead you
[2:15:11] amen
[2:15:14] that's what it is
[2:15:19] I know many other times of you know what
[2:15:21] parents struggle with this parents are
[2:15:24] always parents
[2:15:27] they're always Paris you know always in
[2:15:30] the driving seat
[2:15:32] praise the Lord
[2:15:34] but it's a great it's a great tremendous
[2:15:37] Victory when you are realized that God
[2:15:40] has given you the grace to do all
[2:15:43] that you were supposed to do as a parent
[2:15:46] and you can sit down there and see the
[2:15:48] beauty of Jesus in your children and now
[2:15:51] trust their decision that's right
[2:15:55] oh my
[2:15:59] God this is a beauty
[2:16:02] that's what Grace have done for us
[2:16:06] to know that you have raised them right
[2:16:08] you have taught them right
[2:16:13] come into a place of of of a trusted
[2:16:16] relationship
[2:16:18] praise the Lord
[2:16:25] not traveling with a haunting thought I
[2:16:27] wonder what they are doing can't trust
[2:16:30] that boy
[2:16:31] praise the Lord
[2:16:33] amen
[2:16:36] many of the time the problem is with us
[2:16:41] we have not we have now work
[2:16:44] on a relationship to let go
[2:16:50] to let go and sit back that's why you
[2:16:53] raised them off for that's why you
[2:16:55] should teach them right that's why you
[2:16:57] invest
[2:17:00] invest in winning their soul and
[2:17:02] bringing them to Christ and exposing
[2:17:04] them
[2:17:06] to what is right
[2:17:09] as there will come a time where the role
[2:17:11] will reverse
[2:17:13] you will need to sit back
[2:17:15] and enjoy the ride
[2:17:17] that's why almighty God was doing in
[2:17:20] Eden he sat back and enjoyed the ride
[2:17:22] when Adam went out and named things he
[2:17:24] come back he said that's what I needed
[2:17:27] my boy he sat back and he enjoyed the
[2:17:29] ride because he had brought his son up
[2:17:32] that he can trust
[2:17:37] that's what this man message want to
[2:17:39] produce
[2:17:45] that's God's purpose that's God's desire
[2:17:49] for his children
[2:17:54] not calling one another brothers and
[2:17:56] sisters this is this is your mission for
[2:17:58] you right this is your mission field
[2:18:00] praise the Lord
[2:18:04] well I don't even know her name
[2:18:08] shame you come to the community table
[2:18:10] here then you take communion with a
[2:18:12] sister you don't even know her name
[2:18:19] huh
[2:18:24] that's a shame you're not reaching out
[2:18:30] you're not reaching out
[2:18:34] man will know that ye are my disciples
[2:18:38] if you love one another there will be
[2:18:41] such a love among you
[2:18:44] now brother Branham says when they come
[2:18:46] in
[2:18:47] and they want to plan all they are bring
[2:18:49] all their gossip and all their their
[2:18:52] toxic uh environment brother Brandon
[2:18:54] says they will eat or go away because
[2:18:56] they know that they cannot affect the
[2:18:58] bound of law that is among the people
[2:19:00] there will be no wrong to talk about a
[2:19:02] sister or talk about a brother
[2:19:08] because we will be sending back to back
[2:19:18] I learned many years ago
[2:19:21] never to poor people affection in love
[2:19:24] for you above the world
[2:19:25] oh I learned that
[2:19:27] I landed at the highway
[2:19:29] and learned that many years ago
[2:19:31] praise the Lord
[2:19:33] amen
[2:19:35] I believe that the more truth I stay to
[2:19:37] this word
[2:19:39] praise the Lord the Lord the father will
[2:19:41] love me and his people will appreciate
[2:19:43] me
[2:19:54] maybe you might think that certain
[2:19:57] people have privilege you know it's just
[2:19:59] because they have come too close
[2:20:01] amen maybe they have come too close and
[2:20:05] we can laugh together maybe you always
[2:20:06] see me like a serious person but I'm
[2:20:09] telling you I can laugh I can crack
[2:20:10] laughing
[2:20:12] amen
[2:20:14] I can crack laughing uh but receiving
[2:20:17] myself what's over there in South Africa
[2:20:19] and uh all I had a good time
[2:20:23] I had a good time he had a hotel room
[2:20:25] key in his pocket he house looking for
[2:20:28] it all over the place
[2:20:34] looking for it all over the place
[2:20:37] they also realized he had in his back
[2:20:39] pocket
[2:20:41] I had a good time laughing
[2:20:43] and sometimes when I'm when I laugh
[2:20:46] I feel sorry for myself
[2:20:50] but what are we talking about
[2:20:53] what are we talking about church
[2:20:56] amen
[2:20:58] we all know the burden
[2:21:02] of this prophecy
[2:21:04] that was hanging over Rachel never knew
[2:21:08] she just thought that she wanted a
[2:21:09] childlike every other women wanted child
[2:21:12] or just like her sister but there was a
[2:21:15] prophecy that was hanging over her
[2:21:18] she was expressing something right from
[2:21:21] the heart of the father
[2:21:31] he gave me children
[2:21:33] praise the Lord
[2:21:36] and that's the place where the church
[2:21:38] that's the place where the uh uh uh uh a
[2:21:41] people for the rapture
[2:21:43] because you know you you you we must
[2:21:45] realize this
[2:21:48] that salvation is a free gift
[2:21:53] but when we get on the other side
[2:21:58] and God starts to Crown his people
[2:22:02] we will be crowned for the burden that
[2:22:05] we have bed
[2:22:08] and the things that were expressed
[2:22:10] through our lives
[2:22:13] with you not having no idea
[2:22:18] Matthew chapter 25 he says many shall
[2:22:20] come to unto me that there and say Lord
[2:22:24] he will say it's our sake
[2:22:28] and you visited me
[2:22:30] right they said when were you sick
[2:22:33] so they had no idea it's something that
[2:22:36] was just expressing through their life
[2:22:38] something where the grace of God and the
[2:22:41] love of God has affected them so much
[2:22:45] that they were living a life of
[2:22:47] expression
[2:22:51] they never had no idea
[2:23:02] praise the Lord
[2:23:07] I realized that we can't finish this
[2:23:09] today I'm not going to try to
[2:23:12] but I'll just read some few things here
[2:23:15] but when Jesus died
[2:23:19] God provided an approach to Fellowship
[2:23:21] but when Jesus died
[2:23:24] on the day of our two men he ran the
[2:23:27] bill into I read this and we close not
[2:23:30] only the high priest but whosoever will
[2:23:34] may come anytime into the shekhana glory
[2:23:37] of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:41] into a real Fellowship
[2:23:44] into a place in the presence of God
[2:23:47] where the power of God cleans us from
[2:23:50] all unrighteousness
[2:23:53] we become new creatures in Christ
[2:23:56] praise the Lord
[2:23:58] the Holy Ghost fall Upon Us in all of
[2:24:02] our backwardness and and and sheeness we
[2:24:06] become into a relationship with God
[2:24:09] is it the church the bride
[2:24:12] well shooting the bride be bringing for
[2:24:15] children
[2:24:17] crying Abba Father
[2:24:21] shouldn't we be bringing for children
[2:24:24] Our Lives affecting the ones around us
[2:24:31] bringing for children
[2:24:33] crying Abba Father
[2:24:38] what's the matter no wonder we can
[2:24:41] produce ourselves anymore
[2:24:48] praise the Lord
[2:24:50] because we have gone on the deep end
[2:24:52] that's what Jesus said he told those
[2:24:55] Pharisees you are putting too much
[2:24:57] burden on the people things that you can
[2:24:59] do
[2:25:01] that's why you are requiring them to do
[2:25:07] you see that's the reason why we can
[2:25:09] never bring for children we can never
[2:25:10] bring for Faith children never bring for
[2:25:13] spoken word children by legalism
[2:25:16] you will not do it
[2:25:17] legalism can only kill
[2:25:22] praise the Lord because you will bound
[2:25:24] the people and you will force them and
[2:25:26] force them and force them until they
[2:25:29] will be so burnt out
[2:25:31] there is nothing about love and grace in
[2:25:33] your heart
[2:25:35] to even want to come to church
[2:25:40] praise the Lord
[2:25:43] amen
[2:25:46] we must make it so easy for people to
[2:25:48] want to come to church
[2:25:53] praise the Lord
[2:26:00] it's a form it's a form of of of of
[2:26:03] witnessing
[2:26:05] it's a mission field
[2:26:07] I mean all these little ones we bring
[2:26:09] them to church Wednesday night a Sunday
[2:26:11] morning we bring them out I mean I mean
[2:26:13] they come from school they got to go to
[2:26:15] school the next morning and I mean it's
[2:26:17] such a sacrifice
[2:26:21] but what are you doing you are trusting
[2:26:23] that the grace of God
[2:26:25] will be able to get a hold of them
[2:26:29] you are trusting that God in a
[2:26:31] supernatural way will be able to get a
[2:26:33] hold of them
[2:26:38] when I see all of these young people
[2:26:40] working out they are scheduled around
[2:26:42] working and school in order to be in
[2:26:44] church
[2:26:46] it's a sacrifice
[2:26:52] it's a sacrifice we we all can put our
[2:26:54] responsibility on the line and get busy
[2:27:00] and how thou has killed the churches
[2:27:04] kill the churches
[2:27:06] now even on a Wednesday night it's it's
[2:27:08] it's difficult for you to have people to
[2:27:11] have a preacher come around because you
[2:27:13] you are not sure who all will be in
[2:27:14] church
[2:27:17] praise the Lord
[2:27:19] this last meeting we have with brother
[2:27:21] Brooks it blessed him so much
[2:27:24] he don't like traveling in the winter
[2:27:27] he don't like the winter I don't know
[2:27:29] how he find himself in Iowa
[2:27:31] but he told me there was a leading of
[2:27:33] the Lord but he don't like the winter
[2:27:36] praise the Lord so it was a whole lot of
[2:27:39] sacrifice
[2:27:41] for him to come come here
[2:27:44] amen and then he said to me when he came
[2:27:46] we were in the office he said tonight
[2:27:49] I'm going to see the true believers
[2:27:52] he said because it's so cold out there
[2:27:54] brother if people really show up if
[2:27:56] people don't show up I would I would
[2:27:58] understand it because it's cold out
[2:28:00] praise the Lord but you don't know what
[2:28:03] it means to a preacher
[2:28:07] you don't know what it means
[2:28:13] praise the Lord
[2:28:16] there was nothing that it blesses the
[2:28:19] preacher when the people are receiving
[2:28:21] the word it blesses the preacher when
[2:28:23] the people come showing up
[2:28:27] praise the Lord
[2:28:31] he told me he said brother I was really
[2:28:32] blessed to see the people showing up on
[2:28:34] our call uh uh Saturday night
[2:28:40] all of those things they have just
[2:28:42] killed and we're looking for the
[2:28:44] supernatural Revival
[2:28:47] were we supposed to start it from home
[2:28:52] we're supposed to start it from home
[2:29:00] praise the Lord
[2:29:01] started from home
[2:29:07] it must be our mission field
[2:29:10] being conscious that wherever we find
[2:29:13] ourselves
[2:29:14] you are on a mission field you are a
[2:29:17] missionary
[2:29:19] you don't have to go to Asia or South
[2:29:22] America if the Lord bless you to go and
[2:29:25] you put on your heart to go come and
[2:29:26] tell us who sponsor you
[2:29:29] praise the Lord
[2:29:31] amen who sponsor you will do the best
[2:29:33] that we can to send you because God is
[2:29:35] leading you there
[2:29:37] but you don't have to go there to be a
[2:29:39] missionary Right Where You Are
[2:29:42] whether in school what our work
[2:29:46] praise the Lord you know that's that's
[2:29:48] the reason why those men of all the
[2:29:51] Smith wig of wolf and and and and uh
[2:29:53] Charles Paulding and all of those men
[2:29:55] they they had great in part in doing
[2:29:58] Mission work
[2:30:02] because let me tell you
[2:30:04] if you learn
[2:30:06] that's the old preacher that said this I
[2:30:08] think uh uh Ian bound said is also
[2:30:11] he says if you learn
[2:30:14] just to he said if you learn
[2:30:18] to kneel before God
[2:30:20] if you learn to talk to God on your
[2:30:22] knees he said you can stand before any
[2:30:25] man that's right
[2:30:30] if you learn to talk to the almighty God
[2:30:32] on your knees you can stand before any
[2:30:35] man
[2:30:40] praise the Lord
[2:30:43] Smith wigger wolf his greater word of
[2:30:46] reaching out is to be at the bus station
[2:30:49] and somebody coming wait for the bus
[2:30:52] he said Lord before the bus come fill
[2:30:54] this one with the Holy Ghost almighty
[2:30:56] God you bring this soul on a conversion
[2:31:02] four five six out of ten
[2:31:06] the spirit of God will fall on that
[2:31:08] person they will start crying they don't
[2:31:09] even know what they are crying for
[2:31:14] sometimes it's not just talking to the
[2:31:16] person and trying to convince them and
[2:31:18] bringing all the all the theory of the
[2:31:21] word but after I say in Jesus name you
[2:31:23] know Jesus is the father you know what
[2:31:24] there's no Trinity and you're bringing
[2:31:26] all of those things
