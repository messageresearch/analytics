[5:10] causing them to believe that he was
[5:12] truly the lord
[5:14] the polytheistic religion of the enemy
[5:16] began with the trinitarian doctrine
[5:18] it was way back there in antiquity that
[5:20] the one god in three persons idea came
[5:23] into existence
[5:24] how strange that our modern theologians
[5:26] have not spotted this but evidently just
[5:29] as duped by satan as their forebears
[5:31] were they still believe in three persons
[5:33] in the godhead
[5:35] let us be shown just one place in
[5:37] scripture where there is any authority
[5:39] for that doctrine is it not strange that
[5:41] while the descendants of ham went on
[5:43] their way in satanic worship which
[5:45] involved a basic concept of three gods
[5:48] that there is not one trace of the
[5:49] descendants of shem believing such a
[5:51] thing or having any ceremonial worship
[5:54] that involved even a type of it
[5:56] it is not strange that the hebrews
[5:58] believed
[5:59] hear o israel the lord thy god is one
[6:01] god
[6:02] if there were three persons in the
[6:04] godhead
[6:05] abraham the descendant of shem in
[6:07] genesis 18 saw only one god with two
[6:10] angels
[6:12] now how was this trinity expressed
[6:14] it was expressed by an equilateral
[6:16] triangle even as it is expressed in rome
[6:18] today strange the hebrews did not have
[6:21] such a concept now who is right
[6:24] is it the hebrews or the babylonians
[6:26] in asia the polytheistic idea of three
[6:28] gods in one came out in an image with
[6:30] three heads on one body
[6:32] he is expressed as three intelligences
[6:35] in india they found it in their hearts
[6:37] to express him as one god in three forms
[6:40] now that really is good modern day
[6:42] theology
[6:43] in japan there is a great buddha with
[6:45] three heads like the one we previously
[6:47] described
[6:48] but the most revealing of all is that
[6:50] which sets forth the trinitarian concept
[6:52] of god in a triune form of
[6:54] one
[6:55] the head of an old man symbolizing god
[6:57] the father
[6:59] two
[7:00] a circle which in the mysteries
[7:01] signified seed which in turn means the
[7:04] sun
[7:05] three
[7:06] the wings and tail of a bird dove
[7:10] here was the doctrine of father son and
[7:12] holy ghost
[7:14] three persons in the godhead the
[7:15] veritable trinity
[7:17] you can see the same thing in rome
[7:20] now let me ask once again
[7:21] is it not strange that the devil and his
[7:23] worshippers actually had more truth
[7:25] revealed than the father of faith
[7:27] abraham and his descendants
[7:29] is it not strange that the worshipers of
[7:31] satan knew more about god than the
[7:33] children of god
[7:35] now that is what modern theologians try
[7:36] to tell us when they talk about a
[7:38] trinity
[7:39] just remember this one thing from now on
[7:42] these records are facts and this is a
[7:44] fact
[7:45] satan is a liar and the father of lies
[7:48] and whenever he comes with any light it
[7:50] is still a lie he is a murderer and his
[7:53] doctrine of the trinity has destroyed
[7:55] the multitudes and will destroy until
[7:57] jesus comes
[7:59] according to history it did not take
[8:01] long for a change to be made in this
[8:03] concept of a father and a son and the
[8:05] holy ghost
[8:06] satan took them a step at a time away
[8:08] from the truth
[8:09] the evolved concept of deity was now
[8:12] one
[8:13] the eternal father
[8:15] two the spirit of god incarnate in a
[8:17] human mother
[8:19] does that make you think
[8:21] three
[8:22] a divine son the fruit of that
[8:24] incarnation
[8:25] woman's seed
[8:27] but the devil is not content
[8:29] he hasn't achieved worship of himself
[8:31] yet except in an indirect way
[8:34] so he takes the people away from the
[8:36] truth still further
[8:37] through his mysteries he reveals to the
[8:39] people that since the great invisible
[8:41] father god does not concern himself in
[8:43] the affairs of men
[8:45] but remain silent relative to them then
[8:47] it follows that he may well be
[8:49] worshipped in silence
[8:50] actually it means to ignore him as much
[8:52] as possible if not altogether
[8:55] this doctrine spread around the world
[8:56] also and right today in india you can
[8:59] see that temples to the great creator
[9:00] the silent god are strikingly few in
[9:02] number
[9:04] since it was not necessary to worship
[9:06] the creator father it was only natural
[9:09] that worship swung to the mother and
[9:10] child as the objects of adoration
[9:13] in egypt there was the same combination
[9:16] of mother and son called isis and osiris
[9:19] in india it was ishai and ishwara
[9:21] note the similarity of names even
[9:24] in asia it was sibyli and the oes
[9:26] in rome and in greece it followed suit
[9:29] and in china
[9:30] well imagine the surprise of some roman
[9:32] catholic missionaries as they entered
[9:34] china and found their a madonna and
[9:36] child with rays of light emanating from
[9:38] the head of the babe
[9:39] the image could well have been exchanged
[9:41] for one in the vatican except for the
[9:43] difference of certain facial features
[9:46] it now behooves us to discover the
[9:48] original mother and child the original
[9:50] goddess mother of babylon was samiramus
[9:53] who was called rhea in the eastern
[9:54] countries
[9:56] in her arms she held a son who though a
[9:58] babe was described as tall strong
[10:00] handsome and especially captivating to
[10:02] the women
[10:03] in ezekiel 8 14 he was called tamus
[10:07] among classical writers he was called
[10:09] bacchus
[10:10] to the babylonians he was ninas
[10:13] what accounts for the fact that he is
[10:14] represented as a babe in arms and yet
[10:17] described as a great and mighty man is
[10:19] that he is known as the husband son
[10:22] one of his titles was husband of the
[10:24] mother and in india where the two are
[10:26] known as ishwara and ishai he the
[10:29] husband is represented as the babe at
[10:31] the breast of his own wife
[10:34] that this ninus is the nimrod of the
[10:36] bible we can affirm by comparing history
[10:38] with the genesis account
[10:40] pompeo said
[10:42] nina's king of assyria changed the
[10:44] ancient moderate ways of life by the
[10:46] desire for conquest
[10:48] he was the first who carried war against
[10:50] his neighbors
[10:51] he conquered all nations from assyria to
[10:54] libya as these men knew not the arts of
[10:56] war
[10:57] diadorus says
[10:59] ninus was the most ancient of assyrian
[11:01] kings mentioned in history
[11:03] being of warlike disposition he trained
[11:05] many young men rigorously in the arts of
[11:07] war he brought babylonia under him while
[11:10] yet there was no city of babylon
[11:12] thus we see this niners started to
[11:14] become great in babylon built babel and
[11:16] took over assyria becoming its king
[11:19] and then proceeded to devour other vast
[11:21] territories where the people were
[11:23] unskilled in war and lived in a moderate
[11:25] way as said pompeus
[11:28] now in genesis 10 speaking of the
[11:30] kingdom of nimrod it says
[11:32] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[11:34] babel and iraq and akhad
[11:36] and khalna in the land of china
[11:40] out of that land went forth asser and
[11:42] builded nineveh and kayla etc
[11:45] but the translators made a mistake in
[11:47] translating asser as a noun for it is a
[11:50] verb and in the chaldee means to make
[11:52] strong
[11:53] thus it is nimrod who having been made
[11:56] strong he established his kingdom by
[11:58] building the world's first army which he
[12:00] trained by drilling and through the
[12:01] rigors of hunting
[12:02] went beyond shinar with his strong army
[12:04] and subdued nations and built such
[12:06] cities as nineveh which was named after
[12:09] him or even today a chief part of the
[12:11] ruins of that city is called nimrod
[12:15] since we have discovered who ninus was
[12:18] it is now necessary to discover who his
[12:20] father was
[12:21] according to history it was bell the
[12:23] founder of babylon
[12:25] now it is to be noted here that bell
[12:27] founded it in the sense that he started
[12:29] this whole move but it was the sun ninus
[12:32] that established it and was the first
[12:34] king etc
[12:35] but according to the scripture the
[12:37] father of nimrod was cush and kush begat
[12:39] nimrod
[12:41] not only is this so but we find that ham
[12:43] begat kush
[12:45] now in the egyptian culture bell was
[12:47] called hermes and hermes means the son
[12:50] of ham
[12:51] according to history hermes was the
[12:53] great prophet of idolatry
[12:55] he was the interpreter of the gods
[12:57] another name by which he was called was
[12:59] mercury
[13:01] read acts 14 11 through 12.
[13:04] hygiena says this about that god who was
[13:07] known variously as bell hermes mercury
[13:09] etc for many ages men lived under the
[13:12] government of job
[13:14] not the roman job but jehovah of the
[13:16] hebrews who predates roman history
[13:18] without cities and without laws and all
[13:20] speaking one language
[13:23] but after that mercury bell
[13:26] interpreted the speeches of men
[13:28] whence an interpreter is called
[13:29] hermeneuties
[13:31] the same individual distributed the
[13:32] nations
[13:34] then discord began
[13:36] it is seen from this that bell or cush
[13:38] the father of nimrod originally was the
[13:40] ringleader that led the people away from
[13:42] the true god and encouraged the people
[13:44] as the interpreter of the gods to take
[13:47] another form of religion
[13:49] he encouraged them to go ahead with the
[13:51] tower which his son actually built
[13:53] this encouragement is what brought the
[13:55] confusion and the division of men
[13:57] so that he was both interpreter and
[14:00] confuser
[14:02] cush then was the father of the
[14:04] polytheistic system and when men were
[14:06] deified by men he of course became the
[14:08] father of the gods
[14:10] now cush was called bell
[14:12] and bell in roman mythology was janus
[14:15] he is pictured as having two faces and
[14:17] he carried a club by which he confounded
[14:19] and scattered the people
[14:21] ovid writes that jaina said concerning
[14:23] himself
[14:24] the ancients called me chaos
[14:27] thus we find that the cush of the bible
[14:29] the original rebel against monotheism
[14:31] was called bell
[14:32] bellows hermes janus etc amongst the
[14:35] ancient peoples
[14:37] he purported to bring revelations and
[14:39] interpretations from the gods to the
[14:41] people
[14:42] in so doing he caused the wrath of god
[14:44] to scatter the people bringing division
[14:46] and confusion
[14:48] now up to this point we have seen whence
[14:50] polytheism or the worship of many gods
[14:52] came
[14:53] but did you notice that we also found a
[14:55] mention of a man named cush who was
[14:57] given a title of the father of the gods
[15:00] did you notice here the old theme of
[15:02] ancient mythologies that gods identify
[15:04] themselves with men
[15:06] that is where ancestor worship comes
[15:08] from
[15:09] so we might just examine history to find
[15:11] out about ancestor worship
[15:13] well it was brought out that cush
[15:14] introduced a three god worship of father
[15:17] son and spirit
[15:18] three gods who were all equal
[15:21] but he knew about the seed of the woman
[15:22] coming so there would have to be a woman
[15:24] and her seed come into the picture
[15:27] this was brought to pass when nimrod
[15:29] died
[15:30] his wife semiramis deified him and thus
[15:32] made herself the mother of the son and
[15:35] also the mother of the gods
[15:37] just exactly as the roman church has
[15:39] deified mary
[15:40] they claim she was without sin and was
[15:42] the mother of god
[15:44] she samiramus called nimrod zero ashta
[15:47] which means the woman's promised seed
[15:52] but it wasn't too long until the woman
[15:54] began to attract more attention than the
[15:55] sun and soon she was the one who was
[15:58] depicted as trampling underfoot the
[15:59] serpent
[16:00] they called her the queen of the heaven
[16:03] and made her divine
[16:04] how like today were in mary the mother
[16:06] of jesus had been elevated to
[16:08] immortality and right now as of
[16:10] september 1964
[16:12] the vatican council is attempting to
[16:14] give equality to mary she does not
[16:16] possess
[16:16] for they would like to call her marry
[16:18] the mediatrix
[16:20] mary the mother of all believers or
[16:22] mother of the church
[16:24] if there was ever babylonish ancestor
[16:26] worship in a religion it is the religion
[16:28] of the church of rome
[16:30] not only was ancestor worship originated
[16:32] in babylon but so also was the worship
[16:35] of nature it was in babylon the gods
[16:37] were identified with the sun and moon
[16:39] etc the chief object in nature was the
[16:42] sun which has light giving and
[16:44] heat-giving properties and appears to
[16:46] man as a ball of fire in the heavens
[16:48] thus the chief god would be the sun god
[16:50] whom they called baal
[16:52] often the sun was depicted as a circle
[16:54] of flame and soon around that flame
[16:56] there appeared a serpent
[16:58] it wasn't long until the serpent became
[17:00] a symbol of the sun and consequently
[17:02] worshiped
[17:03] thus the desire of satan's heart became
[17:05] full-fledged he was worshipped as god
[17:08] his throne was established his slaves
[17:11] bowed to him
[17:12] there in pergamus in the form of a
[17:14] living serpent he was worshiped
[17:16] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[17:18] evil now symbolized in the form of a
[17:20] living serpent had not only seduced eve
[17:22] but the majority of mankind
[17:25] but how did pergamos become the seed of
[17:27] satan if babylon was the seed
[17:29] the answer again is in history when
[17:32] babylon fell to the medes and persians
[17:34] the priest king atlas fled the city and
[17:37] went to pergamus with his priests and
[17:38] sacred mysteries
[17:40] there he set up his kingdom outside the
[17:42] roman empire and thrived under the care
[17:44] of the devil
[17:46] this has been a very short resume of the
[17:48] history of the babylonish religion and
[17:50] its advent to pergamos
[17:52] many questions are no doubt left
[17:53] unanswered and much more no doubt could
[17:55] have been said to enlighten us but this
[17:57] is not intended to be a study of history
[18:00] rather it is intended to be a help to
[18:01] the study of the word
[18:04] the denunciation
[18:07] revelation 2 14-15
[18:10] but i have a few things against thee
[18:12] because thou hast there them that hold
[18:14] the doctrine of balaam who taught balak
[18:16] to cast a stumbling block before the
[18:18] children of israel to eat things
[18:20] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[18:22] fornication
[18:24] so hast thou also them that hold the
[18:25] doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing
[18:27] i hate
[18:30] in this pergamian age the lord denounces
[18:32] two doctrines which he hates
[18:34] one
[18:35] the doctrine of balaam which brought
[18:37] idolatry and sinful excesses to israel
[18:39] at baal pior
[18:41] and two
[18:42] the doctrine of the nicolaitans which
[18:44] had been but deeds in the ephesian age
[18:47] combine this denouncement with the fact
[18:49] that he has been emphasizing pergamus as
[18:51] the seed of satan and it is very easy
[18:54] and proper to conclude that somehow the
[18:56] religion of babylon has become
[18:57] intermingled with christianity
[19:00] now this is not merely an assumption but
[19:02] an historical fact which we will prove
[19:04] by going back into history to about 36
[19:07] a.d and coming up to the nicene council
[19:09] of 325
[19:11] when the christians mainly jews by birth
[19:14] were scattered abroad from jerusalem
[19:16] they went everywhere preaching the
[19:17] gospel particularly in the synagogues
[19:20] thus within three years or about in 36
[19:23] a.d the gospel had been taken to rome by
[19:26] junius and andronicus who according to
[19:28] romans 16 7 were apostles
[19:31] the work flourished there for several
[19:33] years until the constant altercations of
[19:35] the jews amongst themselves caused
[19:37] emperor claudius to expel them from rome
[19:40] with the jews banished from that city
[19:42] the backbone of that little church was
[19:43] practically broken
[19:45] perhaps even the elders had been jewish
[19:47] and so would be gone
[19:48] the flock would be unattended and since
[19:50] the word had not been written as a guide
[19:53] it would be very easy for this little
[19:54] flock to drift or be inundated by the
[19:56] philosophers and pagans of that day
[19:59] with grievous wolves on the prowl and
[20:01] the spirit of antichrist released we
[20:04] find from history that this little
[20:05] church in rome became hopelessly
[20:07] backslidden and began to introduce pagan
[20:10] ceremonies under christian titles
[20:13] as the period of banishment lasted for
[20:15] 13 years the founders junius and
[20:17] andronicus did not come back until 54
[20:20] a.d
[20:22] imagine their horror to find a church
[20:24] with a christian title that was woefully
[20:26] pagan
[20:27] there were altars in the church upon
[20:28] which they placed incense and celebrated
[20:30] pagan rites
[20:32] the established leaders of that church
[20:34] could not be approached so with the few
[20:36] who had tried to remain faithful they
[20:38] started a new church or the second
[20:39] church of rome
[20:41] god graciously worked amongst them by
[20:43] signs and wonders so that a third church
[20:46] was started
[20:47] and though the first church was
[20:48] reproached for being pagan and not
[20:50] christian in its worship it would not
[20:52] give up its title but remained and still
[20:54] remains the first church of rome the
[20:56] roman catholic church
[21:00] now the majority of us have the mistaken
[21:02] idea that any and all who call
[21:03] themselves christians would be the
[21:05] target of the devil and consequently the
[21:07] brunt of governmental tyranny but not so
[21:10] this first church had begun to thrive
[21:12] and multiply so in numbers that the
[21:15] emperors and various officials of the
[21:17] government actually favored that church
[21:19] for political reasons
[21:21] thus when the leaders of the first
[21:22] church in rome found themselves in favor
[21:25] they took the opportunity to turn the
[21:26] government against the true believers
[21:28] and demand their persecution unless they
[21:30] came into their fold
[21:32] one such bishop of the first church of
[21:33] rome was anacetus who lived in the
[21:36] second century and was contemporary with
[21:38] polycarp
[21:39] when the venerable polycarp heard that
[21:41] the first christian church of rome was
[21:43] involved in pagan ceremonies and had
[21:45] corrupted the truth of the gospel he
[21:47] went there to implore them to change
[21:50] he saw them prostrate themselves before
[21:52] images named after apostles and saints
[21:54] he saw them light candles and burn
[21:56] incense on the altar he saw them
[21:58] celebrate the passover under the name
[22:00] easter where they elevated the disc
[22:02] shaped bread that honored the sun god
[22:05] and then they poured the wine out as a
[22:06] libation to the gods
[22:09] but this aged saint who had traveled
[22:10] 1500 miles could not arrest their
[22:13] downward plunge
[22:15] god spoke through him just as he was
[22:16] leaving
[22:18] ephraim is married to his idols led him
[22:20] alone
[22:21] hosea 4 15
[22:23] polycarp nevermore returned
[22:26] following anacetus was the wicked bishop
[22:28] of rome called victor
[22:30] he introduced even more pagan festivals
[22:32] and ceremonies into the first church and
[22:35] also went about trying his utmost to
[22:37] persuade the true christian churches to
[22:39] incorporate the same ideas
[22:41] they would not do as he requested so he
[22:44] prevailed upon government officials to
[22:45] persecute the believers hailing them
[22:48] into court casting them into prison and
[22:50] even meeting out death to many
[22:52] such an example of his vile deeds is
[22:54] found in history where emperor septimus
[22:56] severus was prevailed upon by callistus
[22:59] the friend of victor to kill seven
[23:01] thousand at thessalonica
[23:03] because these true believers celebrated
[23:05] the passover according to the lord jesus
[23:07] and not according to the worship of
[23:09] astarte
[23:11] already the false vine was turning loose
[23:13] its anger against the living god by
[23:15] killing the elect even as did its
[23:17] forebear cain kill abel
[23:20] the true church kept trying to get the
[23:22] first church to repent
[23:23] it would not do so
[23:25] it increased in size and influence
[23:28] it embarked upon a constant campaign to
[23:30] discredit the true seed
[23:32] they claimed that they and they alone
[23:33] were the true representatives of the
[23:35] lord jesus christ and wanted the fact
[23:37] that they were the original church in
[23:39] rome and they alone were the first
[23:41] church
[23:42] indeed they were the first church and
[23:44] indeed they are
[23:47] thus by the time of this third church
[23:49] age we have two churches bearing the
[23:51] same name but with a bitter difference
[23:52] between them
[23:54] one has departed from the truth married
[23:56] idols and has no life in her
[23:58] she has hybridized herself and the signs
[24:00] of death not life follow in her wake she
[24:04] is powerful with many members she is
[24:06] favored by the world
[24:08] the other is a little persecuted group
[24:10] but she follows the word and the signs
[24:12] follow her
[24:14] the sick are healed and the dead are
[24:15] raised
[24:16] she is alive with the life and word of
[24:19] god
[24:20] she loves not her life but holds to his
[24:22] name and his faith even unto death
[24:25] and so the terrible persecution of
[24:26] official rome fell upon the true
[24:28] believers
[24:29] until constantine arose and granted
[24:31] freedom of religious worship
[24:33] there seems to be two reasons why this
[24:35] freedom was granted
[24:37] in the first place various good emperors
[24:39] had not allowed persecution
[24:41] but as they passed on they were followed
[24:43] by those who killed christians it was so
[24:46] senseless that it finally came to public
[24:48] heed that the christians ought to be
[24:50] left alone
[24:51] the second and best noted reason is that
[24:53] constantine had a very difficult battle
[24:55] ahead of him in taking over the control
[24:57] of the empire
[24:59] one night in a dream
[25:00] he saw a white cross appear before him
[25:03] he felt that this was an omen unto him
[25:05] that if the christians prayed for a
[25:07] victory for him he would win the battle
[25:09] he promised freedom for them in the
[25:11] event that he was victorious
[25:13] he was victorious and the freedom of
[25:15] worship was granted in the edict of
[25:16] nance 312 a.d
[25:20] but this freedom from persecution and
[25:22] death was not as magnanimous as it first
[25:24] appeared
[25:25] constantine was now the patron as a
[25:28] patron his interest was somewhat more
[25:30] than that of an observer for he decided
[25:32] that the church needed his help in her
[25:34] affairs
[25:36] he had seen them disagreeing over
[25:37] various matters one of which involved
[25:39] arius bishop of alexander who taught his
[25:42] adherents that jesus was not truly god
[25:44] but a lesser being having been created
[25:46] by god
[25:47] the western church held the opposite
[25:49] view believing that jesus was the very
[25:51] essence of god and as they said co-equal
[25:54] with the father
[25:56] with such matters along with the
[25:58] intrusion of pagan ceremony into worship
[26:00] the emperor called for the nicene
[26:02] council in 325 with the thought that he
[26:04] would bring all groups together where
[26:06] they could iron out their differences
[26:08] and come to a common understanding and
[26:10] all be one
[26:11] isn't it peculiar that though this
[26:13] started with constantine it didn't die
[26:15] but is very much alive today as the
[26:17] world council of churches
[26:19] and where he failed to truly achieve it
[26:21] it will be achieved in this day through
[26:23] the ecumenical move
[26:26] now this interference of the state with
[26:27] the church is a foolish thing for the
[26:29] world does not understand either the
[26:31] truth found in the word or the ways of
[26:33] the church
[26:34] why the very decision handed down by the
[26:36] council that arius was wrong
[26:38] was reversed two years later by the
[26:40] emperor and for many years that false
[26:42] doctrine was fostered upon the people
[26:45] but that the church and state would come
[26:47] together was truly foreknown of the lord
[26:49] the very name pergamos means thoroughly
[26:52] married
[26:53] and indeed state and church were married
[26:55] politics and religion were united
[26:57] the offspring of that union have been
[26:59] consistently the most horrible hybrids
[27:01] the world has ever seen
[27:03] the truth is not in them but all the
[27:05] evil ways of cain the first hybrid is
[27:09] not only was state and church wedded in
[27:11] this age but the babylonian religion was
[27:13] officially joined to the first church
[27:16] satan now had access to the name of
[27:18] christ and he was enthroned as god in
[27:20] worship
[27:21] with the help of federal aid the
[27:23] churches fell air to beautiful buildings
[27:25] which were lined with altars of white
[27:27] marble and images of the departed saints
[27:30] and right in this age is when the beast
[27:32] of revelation 13 3 that was wounded to
[27:35] death
[27:36] the pagan roman empire came back to life
[27:39] and power as the holy roman empire
[27:42] rome as a material nation had suffered
[27:44] much depletion and soon would suffer it
[27:47] completely
[27:48] but it mattered not now for her
[27:50] religious empire would keep her on top
[27:52] of the world governing from the inside
[27:53] where she would not appear to do so from
[27:55] the outside
[27:57] let me show the exact scriptural truth
[27:59] of this matter for i do not want anyone
[28:02] to think that i am giving a revelation
[28:03] of my own one not found in scripture
[28:06] daniel 2 31-45
[28:10] thou o king sauced and behold a great
[28:12] image
[28:13] this great image whose brightness was
[28:15] excellent stood before thee
[28:17] and the form thereof was terrible
[28:19] this image's head was a fine gold his
[28:22] breast and his arms of silver his belly
[28:24] and his thighs of brass his legs of iron
[28:28] his feet part of iron and part of clay
[28:31] thou saws told that a stone was cut out
[28:33] without hands which smote the image upon
[28:35] his feet that were of iron and clay and
[28:37] break them to pieces
[28:39] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[28:42] silver and the gold broke into pieces
[28:44] together
[28:45] and became like the chaff of the summer
[28:47] threshing floors and the wind carried
[28:49] them away that no place was found for
[28:51] them
[28:52] and the stone that smote the image
[28:53] became a great mountain and filled the
[28:55] whole earth
[28:56] this is the dream
[28:58] and we will tell the interpretation
[29:00] thereof before the king
[29:02] thou o king art a king of kings for the
[29:04] god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom
[29:07] power and strength and glory
[29:09] and wheresoever the children of man
[29:11] dwell the beasts of the fields and the
[29:13] fowls of the heaven hath he given into
[29:14] thine hand and hath made thee ruler over
[29:17] them all
[29:18] thou art this head of gold
[29:20] and after thee shall arise another
[29:22] kingdom inferior to thee and another
[29:24] third kingdom of brass which shall bear
[29:26] rule over all the earth
[29:28] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[29:30] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[29:32] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[29:35] iron that breaketh all these shall it
[29:37] break in pieces and brews
[29:39] and whereas thou sawest the feet and
[29:41] toes part of potter's clay and part of
[29:43] iron the kingdom shall be divided
[29:46] but there shall be in it of the strength
[29:48] of the iron for as much as thou sawest
[29:50] the iron mixed with myriad clay
[29:53] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[29:54] iron and part of clay
[29:56] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[29:58] and partly broken
[30:00] and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with
[30:02] miri clay
[30:03] they shall mingle themselves with the
[30:05] seed of men
[30:06] but they shall not cleave one to another
[30:08] even as iron is not mixed with clay
[30:11] and in the days of these kings shall the
[30:13] god of heaven set up a kingdom which
[30:15] shall never be destroyed
[30:17] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[30:19] other people but it shall break in
[30:20] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[30:23] and it shall stand forever
[30:25] for as much as thou sawest at the stone
[30:27] was cut out of the mountain without
[30:28] hands and that it break in pieces the
[30:31] iron the brass the clay the silver and
[30:33] the gold
[30:34] the great god hath made known to the
[30:36] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[30:39] and the dream is certain and the
[30:40] interpretation thereof sure
[30:44] herein is revealed an exact account of
[30:46] future unfilled history that was
[30:48] prophesied to come upon the earth from
[30:50] the time of daniel until jesus would
[30:51] come and reign as the son of david
[30:54] it is known as the times of the gentiles
[30:57] it had within it four historical
[30:59] divisions which were known by the
[31:00] dominating empire in each division
[31:03] babylonian
[31:04] medo-persian
[31:05] grecian
[31:06] roman
[31:08] the greatest and most absolute monarchy
[31:10] was the babylonian which was typified as
[31:12] the head of gold
[31:14] the next in glory was the medo-persian
[31:16] which as history bore out was truly less
[31:18] glorious and was typified as the breast
[31:20] and arms of silver
[31:22] then there followed the grecian age
[31:24] whose king was the most brilliant of all
[31:26] military leaders the world has ever
[31:28] known
[31:29] so it was fittingly typified as the
[31:31] belly and thighs of brass
[31:33] it was less glorious than the other two
[31:35] preceding it
[31:36] finally came the last kingdom which was
[31:38] the roman empire typified as the legs
[31:41] and feet
[31:42] but wherein the former kingdoms were
[31:43] typified as pure minerals pure gold
[31:46] silver and brass
[31:48] this last empire was pure iron only in
[31:50] the legs
[31:52] for when it came to the feet it was a
[31:53] mixture of iron and clay and mineral and
[31:56] soil just don't mix and produce
[31:58] constancy and strength but not only is
[32:00] this so
[32:01] but most amazing this last empire roman
[32:04] would endure in its peculiar mixed state
[32:07] right up until jesus returns
[32:10] this roman empire of iron iron
[32:13] signifying power and great destructive
[32:15] force against opposition was to be made
[32:17] of two main divisions
[32:19] and it certainly was for the empire
[32:21] literally split into two
[32:23] east and west
[32:24] both were very powerful crushing all
[32:26] before them
[32:28] but as the glory and power of all
[32:30] empires fail
[32:31] so this empire began to fall also
[32:34] thus rome fell
[32:36] pagan imperial rome was no longer iron
[32:39] she crumbled she was wounded to death
[32:42] rome could not now rule it was all over
[32:45] so thought the world
[32:47] but how wrong the world was for that
[32:49] head rome the wounded was not wounded
[32:52] unto death
[32:53] west translation of revelation 13
[32:56] 3
[32:58] and one of his heads appeared to have
[33:00] been mortally wounded the throat having
[33:02] been slashed
[33:03] and his death stroke was healed and the
[33:06] whole earth followed after the wild
[33:08] beast in amazement
[33:10] people look at rome
[33:12] they look at the nation of italy
[33:14] and as they look they do not realize
[33:16] that rome with her strict confines where
[33:18] the pope has an actual area as his
[33:20] domain is literally a nation within a
[33:22] nation
[33:23] and she has ambassadors and receives
[33:25] ambassadors
[33:26] papal false christian rome
[33:29] she has even called the eternal city how
[33:31] blasphemous
[33:32] now controls by religion even more ably
[33:35] than when pagan imperial rome controlled
[33:37] by the pure iron of force
[33:39] rome took on a new lease of life when
[33:41] constantine joined church and state and
[33:44] back the union by force
[33:46] the spirit that motivated pagan rome is
[33:48] the same spirit that now motivates false
[33:50] christian rome you can see that is so
[33:53] because you now know that the fourth
[33:54] empire never went out of existence it
[33:57] just changed in its outer texture
[34:00] once the nicene council had swung the
[34:02] power of political rome to the church
[34:04] it seemed that there were no limits to
[34:06] which this first christian church would
[34:08] go
[34:08] the name christian which originally
[34:10] brought persecution now became the name
[34:13] of the persecutors
[34:15] it was in this age that augustine of
[34:16] hippo
[34:18] 354-430 forth the precept that the
[34:21] church ought and must use force if
[34:23] necessary to bring her children back
[34:25] into the fold
[34:26] and that it was in harmony with the word
[34:28] of god to kill the heretics and
[34:30] apostates
[34:31] in his controversy with the donatists he
[34:33] wrote
[34:35] it is indeed better that men should be
[34:37] led to worship god by teaching
[34:39] and that they should be driven to it by
[34:41] fear of punishment or pain
[34:43] but it does not follow that because the
[34:45] former course produces the better men
[34:47] therefore those who do not yield to it
[34:49] should be neglected
[34:51] for many have found advantage as we have
[34:53] proved and are daily proving by actual
[34:55] experience in being first compelled by
[34:57] fear or pain so that they might
[34:59] afterwards be influenced by teaching so
[35:02] that they might follow out in act what
[35:04] they have already learned in word
[35:06] whilst those are better who are guided
[35:08] or right by love
[35:09] those are certainly more numerous who
[35:11] are corrected by fear
[35:13] for who can possibly love us more than
[35:15] christ who laid down his life for the
[35:17] sheep
[35:18] yet after calling peter and the other
[35:20] apostles by his words alone when he came
[35:23] to summon paul
[35:24] he not only constrained him with his
[35:26] voice but even dashed him to the earth
[35:28] with his power and that he might
[35:30] forcibly bring one who is raging amidst
[35:32] the darkness of infidelity to desire the
[35:35] light of the heart he first struck him
[35:37] with physical blindness of the eyes
[35:39] why therefore should not the church use
[35:41] force in compelling her lost sons to
[35:43] return
[35:44] the lord himself said
[35:46] go out into the highways and hedges and
[35:48] compel them to come in
[35:50] wherefore if the power which the church
[35:52] has received by divine appointment in
[35:54] its due season through the religious
[35:56] character and faith of kings be the
[35:58] instrument by which those who are found
[36:00] in the highways and hedges
[36:02] that is in heresies and systems are
[36:04] compelled to come in then let them not
[36:06] find fault with being compelled
[36:09] the thirst for blood was growing apace
[36:12] the false vine in spain now played upon
[36:14] the emperor maximus
