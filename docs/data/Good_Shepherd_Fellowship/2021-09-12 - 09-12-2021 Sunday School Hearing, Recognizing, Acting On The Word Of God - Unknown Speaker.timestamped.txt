[0:00] couldn't do it he never was in him to be
[0:03] able to counterpass
[0:05] the things of the world
[0:07] the carnal things
[0:09] but jacob it was just so easy for him to
[0:12] do it
[0:13] now
[0:15] jacob one purpose jacob had
[0:19] and that was that
[0:21] he
[0:22] longed for that birthright
[0:27] no matter how he got it just so he got
[0:31] it
[0:34] and that spirit of that
[0:37] one birth
[0:39] is still represented in the world today
[0:42] and it's coming to a head now
[0:46] the spiritual believer and the carnal
[0:48] man
[0:50] carnal believer
[0:52] no one could say they wasn't both
[0:54] religious they were
[0:56] they didn't say that once served an idol
[0:57] and the other one god they were both
[0:59] servants of god
[1:03] now pay close attention to the
[1:05] scriptures now on this subject because
[1:08] i'm sure it'll help you
[1:11] now
[1:12] not everyone that saith lord lord will
[1:15] enter in
[1:16] but the one that doeth the will of my
[1:19] father which is in heaven
[1:22] now if you notice
[1:23] jacob
[1:24] had one thing that he wanted because
[1:27] according to the word
[1:32] the blessings and the
[1:35] the good things laid in the birthright
[1:40] and
[1:41] jacob that was his only objective
[1:45] the only thing he had in mind was get
[1:48] that birthright
[1:51] and esau despised it the one that
[1:54] actually had it
[1:56] despised it
[1:59] or he was ashamed of it
[2:02] but jacob wanted it regardless
[2:05] of how he got it he wanted it that's the
[2:08] way with the spiritual believer today
[2:11] he doesn't care how much you laugh at
[2:14] him how much fun you make
[2:16] how ridiculous he has to act to the
[2:18] carnal mind his only objective is a
[2:22] birthright he wants to get to god
[2:27] because it's born in him
[2:30] he can't help it
[2:33] jacob
[2:34] means the planter our deceiver
[2:37] but after finding and coming into
[2:40] possession of the birthright he was
[2:42] changed
[2:44] that's the carnal change he was then
[2:46] called
[2:47] jacob
[2:49] a prince with the lord who's wrestled
[2:51] with him
[2:53] amen
[2:55] the carnal believer today
[2:57] oh as long as i go to church and do
[3:00] what's right what difference does it
[3:02] make
[3:03] that's esau's group
[3:05] he still makes fun and despises the
[3:08] birthright
[3:11] he doesn't care for it
[3:13] but
[3:14] jacob loved it
[3:16] and the spiritual man today and
[3:19] spiritual woman that's elected
[3:21] predestinated of god to come to eternal
[3:24] life
[3:25] if they have to sell everything they got
[3:28] if they have to take their name off of
[3:30] every church book in the nation
[3:32] they still want that birth right it's
[3:35] the only thing that matters to them
[3:38] just get that birthright
[3:40] that's all
[3:43] no matter how what level they have to
[3:44] come on if they have to get out the
[3:47] altar and cry boohoo if they have to run
[3:49] through the
[3:50] the
[3:51] places and go back and make things right
[3:53] and sell what they got or give away
[3:56] everything they have and become a
[3:57] pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter
[4:00] they want the birthright that's all
[4:02] they're interested in
[4:05] the birthright
[4:07] but don't blame them people they can't
[4:09] happen
[4:10] they were predestinated to that elected
[4:14] to it
[4:17] and
[4:17] then
[4:19] we see that these two
[4:21] carnal and spiritual
[4:24] people that's the way it always happens
[4:28] that's the way it is today
[4:30] it always has been that way
[4:33] cain and abel
[4:35] in the garden of eden
[4:36] when eden was created there were two
[4:39] trees
[4:40] for a man to take his choice
[4:42] one he become of wisdom
[4:45] the other he become life
[4:48] there was two boys cain and abel both of
[4:50] them religious
[4:52] one of them desired
[4:54] uh life eternal and he offered to god by
[4:58] faith a more excellent sacrifice than
[5:00] cain a perfect type of the churches
[5:03] today
[5:03] the church natural
[5:06] church spiritual
[5:08] and there's no doubt but what i'm
[5:10] talking to both classes right now
[5:13] and perhaps father tate will talk to
[5:16] tens of thousands of them
[5:18] but look
[5:22] the church natural it's just the church
[5:25] carnal
[5:27] they're never able to get above that
[5:29] little thing of i john church if i go to
[5:32] church if i do the best i can that's all
[5:35] god requires
[5:37] now that's the same thing kingdom
[5:40] he went and made an altar
[5:42] he made a sacrifice he brought the
[5:45] fruits of the land and he said here it
[5:47] is god
[5:48] that's the best i got
[5:51] it or leave it
[5:53] that's the way the carnal believer
[5:55] believes today
[5:57] lord i'll go to church i'll join the
[5:59] best group that i can find
[6:01] i'll pay in my dues to the church i'll
[6:03] do what's right now here's the best i
[6:05] can do
[6:06] i'll help buy some coal for the widow or
[6:08] i'll give the children some clothing
[6:10] that's all right nothing to say against
[6:12] it but that's it
[6:14] that's all if you want to take it if you
[6:17] don't you don't have to take it that's
[6:19] the attitude of the church carnal today
[6:24] but the church spiritual
[6:27] able
[6:29] by revelation
[6:31] by grace
[6:33] he's seen beyond that
[6:38] and by faith he offered to god a more
[6:40] excellent sacrifice than cain
[6:43] and it testified of his righteousness
[6:46] god the same thing took place in ishmael
[6:51] and isaac
[6:53] one was of the flesh
[6:55] and the other was of the spirit
[6:58] one of the bonds woman one of the three
[7:00] women it happened the same thing
[7:04] in israel
[7:05] and moab two great churches coming
[7:08] together
[7:09] and when israel was wanting to go to
[7:12] their promised place
[7:15] church spiritual
[7:17] jacob's people
[7:18] israel
[7:20] on the road
[7:22] esau's people met them
[7:25] moab
[7:27] church
[7:28] powerful
[7:30] and the great
[7:32] leader of the church
[7:34] balaam came down to curse his brother
[7:40] but he found that he could not curse his
[7:42] brother he failed with the blindness of
[7:46] his eyes
[7:48] to see the predestinated plan that and
[7:51] to see the word of god
[7:54] [Music]
[7:55] first faith cometh by hearing
[7:58] hearing of the word of god
[8:01] then the believer hears it
[8:03] recognizes it and acts on it
[8:07] the carnal man
[8:09] i'll hear it
[8:11] the sound of it but never here means to
[8:13] understand it
[8:17] look at is looking at something but to
[8:19] see it is to understand it
[8:23] except the man be born again he cannot
[8:25] see or understand the kingdom of god
[8:30] now
[8:30] here come
[8:32] israel coming up with god's promise
[8:37] that they were headed to the promised
[8:39] land
[8:41] not infidels
[8:44] but believers
[8:48] believers in the same god that israel
[8:51] had
[8:52] come out to try to curse
[8:56] his brother
[8:58] because he said his brother is
[9:01] surely was unrighteous because he had
[9:03] done lots of things that was bad
[9:07] but you see he failed to see the
[9:09] election amen
[9:13] same thing with esau and jacob
[9:16] esau seemed like a better man
[9:19] he settled down and done charitable
[9:20] things
[9:22] he took care of his old blind daddy
[9:26] got him venison and taking care of him
[9:29] i was a good boy
[9:32] there's many things that carnal
[9:34] believers do in the light of religion
[9:37] helping societies and and paying off
[9:40] hospital bills for people and religious
[9:42] things but that's not what i'm talking
[9:45] about
[9:50] was good
[9:51] a great nation
[9:54] a brother to him
[9:57] and jacob had done everything he had
[10:00] been a renegade but yet he had one thing
[10:03] to achieve that was to obtain that
[10:07] promise that birthright
[10:10] here come israel jacob's children with
[10:14] the same objective amen now who's going
[10:17] to be right
[10:20] balaam built seven altars
[10:22] in israel there were seven altars
[10:25] balaam offered seven sacrifices of clean
[10:28] beasts
[10:29] israel offered seven sacrifices of clean
[10:31] beast
[10:33] there is far if they take it ritually
[10:36] boy it was just as religious as israel
[10:40] was
[10:41] esau just as religious as jacob was and
[10:46] came just as religious as abel was
[10:50] but the election is what holds
[10:56] how blind
[10:58] how blind that esau's children
[11:03] spiritually speaking the movements
[11:06] looked down upon israel and said look at
[11:08] them
[11:10] they're not a denomination
[11:11] they're a bunch of renegades they live
[11:14] in tents and we're a great nation
[11:17] they've done evil
[11:19] and they have no organization among them
[11:21] they're just wiggling around following a
[11:23] prophet
[11:26] but he failed to see the bright serpent
[11:29] and the smith rock going before them
[11:32] he failed to see that called out elected
[11:36] group
[11:37] following the divine order of god to the
[11:39] promised land
[11:42] that's the way it is today
[11:45] they say it's a bunch of holy rollers
[11:48] it's a bunch of people who's this that
[11:49] and the other but they fail to see that
[11:52] it's following the direction of the word
[11:55] of god
[11:57] israel was on her way to the promised
[11:59] land
[12:00] god in his word made a promise
[12:03] jacob
[12:04] the reason that he chose to find that
[12:06] birthright regardless
[12:08] he wanted to get it
[12:10] because he knowed that birthright
[12:13] helped the blessings
[12:16] it helped life
[12:17] he didn't care how it comes just so he
[12:19] got it
[12:20] that was the main thing
[12:22] what plane had come home didn't matter
[12:24] he wanted it
[12:26] and he must have it
[12:29] and he got it
[12:31] blessed are they they do hunger and
[12:33] thirst for righteousness they shall be
[12:35] filled
[12:38] he was on his road and he was after it
[12:41] and he received it israel was on her
[12:43] road
[12:45] to the promised land
[12:48] no matter how many moba nights and
[12:50] curses they tried to put on them they
[12:52] went straight to the promised land
[12:56] today you'll never
[12:58] no matter how much law they get how much
[13:01] prosecution how much persecution how
[13:04] many evil things they say how many times
[13:06] they call holy roar how many times they
[13:08] say those evil things the church will
[13:10] move on
[13:12] it's got to
[13:14] it's staying in the word of god
[13:18] [Music]
[13:39] so
[13:44] [Music]
[13:58] you
