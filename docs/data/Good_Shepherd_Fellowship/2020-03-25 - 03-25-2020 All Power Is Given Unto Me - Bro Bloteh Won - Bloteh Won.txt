Bibles praise the Lord Sunday we started speak a little bit on all power in heaven if it's given to me tonight we will like to take from the book of Saint John chapter 5 we'll just read the verse praise the Lord it's in John chapter 5 let's just read verse 22 it's a very familiar verse there see John chapter 5 but we were stayed on the top of all power is given to me of power in heaven they just read verse 22 okay let's just let's drop back a little bit just for the scripture reading we read from verse 19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you say John chapter five reading from verse 19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he's hearing the father do for what things soever he does this also does the son likewise for the father loveth the son and show him all things that himself do it and he will show him greater works than these that ye may Marvel for as the father raised up the dead in the time of Elisha and in the Old Testament and quickened him even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father George had no man but have committed all judgment unto the son Amy let's pray Heavenly Father father of creation the father of the universe the one from whom all things were written either from you are the very beginning of the beginning dear Lord we bring our hearts to you tonight and father we want to actually would take from our heart Lord a burning of your word let it be father your touch tonight Oh God under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit father to be able to bring your word to your people we ask the Lord you would just bless this portion of the service now in Jesus name we pray Amy praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat and like we said it's good to be in the house of the Lord and just thinking about the service tonight I couldn't help but also think this morning after we got praying and we were just fellowship in a little bit and talking to the family at home you know trying to remember some of survivors of the Holocaust you know remember some of their stories and some of their testimony and as I started to play back in my mind for some for some reason a period of time I just went through listening in to different survivors and they were they were very helpful to me to see what God took some of those people true and then I thought about it and and one of the thing that was real to me was most of the survivors every time they talk they tell their testimony and they would talk a little bit about their family what it was at home how their family life was and in the time they spend with their mom and the time they spend with their dad and you know and and every one of them one thing that was common every one of them remember the very day they were taken from their home every one of them remember what happened at that time for them to go right into their testimony of the different things that happened to them they will always remember what happened that day and you see that was not thinking about this until 2:00 this morning but for some reason yesterday I felt in my heart to send out the text that I sent out yesterday nourishing us you know now to get allow the negative part of all of this that is happening to get on us oh I'm feeling bored I'm staying to the house I'm doing nothing the children are burning me out in order Death Wish of course all of those things are happening but we have to realize that if you know God in all of his sovereign knowledge knew that we would come right to this hour and I believe that God half he has a purpose of bringing us to this hour now so I was just thinking about there and I thought about this code into Exeter where brother Branham talks about the tender hand of Jehovah I want to read there tonight before I get into what I want to share with you the message to Exeter he says I'm looking am by faith to was becoming something Lord upon the earth that's going to draw thy people together you know over and over brother Branham says Jesus in my ends in John chapter 7 17 say father make us one that the word you know that you have sent your son brother Branham says it was God it was Jesus asking the father to make us one and and and God has a way of drawing his people together he says by faith who was becoming something law upon the earth that's going to draw the people to get him when we see the denominational churches so pinning down and and getting so indifferent it's really pushes the people out just as it was in Egypt a pharaoh rising who knew not Joseph as it was in Germany up into Russia and Italy the people rise up Joseph Hitler standing Mussolini who hated the Jews they had to go back to their homeland now we have to realize scriptural part in the times all in the Bible for Jacob to go back to his homeland God had to create some unrest around him he had to bring him problem with with living and all of that I mean he was settling down he was prospering but God had to tear his nest his comfort zone to be able to stir his heart up to desire to go back to his homeland verbum says here they had to go back to their homeland God you got a way of doing things that we don't understand and you passed him no home in Germany everything taking away from them also in Italy Russia no place to go and they were sent back to their homeland just to fulfill the word and I believe that this thing will bring the Word of God to pass amen this will bring the Word of God to pass all the loving hand of Jehovah how sometimes a lost cruller the way that people suffer but it still is the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children praise the Lord I mean so we have to look for the hand of God even if it is small you know like like Elijah saw in the clouds you know if we can see just a little bit of God hand in what is happening because in the midst of all of this his tender him will lead us home praise the Lord amen and also an in the message here see shall not be heard 1955 he also said he said if you don't know the Word of God and the plan of God you you can be easily shocked but when you see God's plan his program then by faith you know it is God and God identifying himself doing just what he did in the other times walking proving he says that's the reason Moses could not be shocked he talked face to face with God and God told him I am I am the one that was with Abraham back yonder I am the one that made this promise I will be with you how are you going to stop that man then when God gave us a promise that he will never leave us he will never forsake us praise the Lord and that's what I want to encourage us tonight in the mists of all of this let's look for the tender hand of Jehovah amen because just like that hand the same way it lead Israa back to the promised land pressure from from from from farad a new net Joseph's pressure from from from the Egyptian to get them back to the promised land and God repeated the same thing he just I mean put a heat ray in the hearts of of a Edler and all of these men to put pressure on the Jews who get them back to their promised land and he would do the same amen but that's the tender hands of Jehovah praise the Lord let's look for the tender hints of Jehovah tonight I want to speak a little bit like I said continuing on all power is giving them to me but we read the verse over there in st. John the father Josh and no man but have committed all judgment to the son first King chapter 2 first King chapter 2 let's see you type in the Old Testament were the father George and no man but he have committed all judgment unto the son praise the Lord amen I was going to have brother Jordan play this for us but I never told him so let's just read together year now the days of David reading from verse 1 now the days of David ro9 that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the earth be they are strong their fault and showed herself a man and keep the charge of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandment and his judgment and his testimony as it is written in the Lord of Moses that thou may a prosper in all the doubters and words whoever they are turn it ourselves that the law may continue his word which he speak concerning me in saying if that children take heed to their ways to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul their Shah naphtha will be he said a man on the throne of Israel moreover thou know'st it also what dropped the son of suryya be to me and what he did tall the two captains of the horse of Israel on to Abner the son of Nell and on to a messiah the son of Jada whom he slayed and in ensure the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his gather that was about his limbs and in his shoes that were on his feet do therefore I call him to their wisdom and let net his herd head go down to the grave in peace but show kindness unto the son of bar dealer the Ghibli and let them be to those that eat at the table for soul became to me when I fled before when I fled because of Absalom that brother and behold that their high will be shemail the son of Zera the Benjamite now as we read this these were David last words just like Jesus last word to the church all power in heaven and earth is given unto me so here David is is is is it's empowering his son how he can be the man and how he can be prosperous before the Lord the things that he needs to do and in keeping the commandments of the Lord and walking right that the promise that was given to his father David will fall upon him but after telling him in charging him and giving him the word of the law David also now is remembering he also committing judgment in the hands of Saul I mean in the hands of Solomon his son talking about job and talking about she melon and people that did wrong to him and also people that were kind to him and he's your empowering Solomon that a Solomon will be able to judge this man according to the wisdom that was given to him never been said in the message Revelation chapter 4 he said the father George had no man but he commit all judgment told the Sun God's judgment seat you speak against me it will be forgiven you speak another another one coming another mercy you can speak against the son of man and I will forgive you but some days the Holy Spirit will come and dwell in the heart of the people one word against it will never be forgiving praise the Lord now you have to realize also in the type year in in the scripture David is telling Solomon he's charging Solomon and intolerance Solomon remember joy you know what what he did to the two captains of Israel remember this one also and remember this man but well watch here in the scripture David is telling Solomon he said dude therefore I call him told that wisdom he's giving Solomon a charge but he's also telling Solomon that he should have this sermon praise the Lord and if you read the scripture you will realize that Solomon just never left from before David and said well you sent for joy I'm going to execute him and you sent for this man all of this man that David charged Solomon to remember or to deal with them all to reward them Solomon also gave him a time for them to be able to prove himself he really did not walk on the words of David and hangjo up he got into contact with Joe up he gave Joe up an instruction to do the same thing he did to she Marilyn and all of this man so what I was saying tonight Jesus said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me now we know that brother Branham the Prophet is is an interpreter of the word a divine interpreter of the world but just look at some few culture and see how how he interpreted the scripture in speaking about it what does take to make Christian life 1957 he says you he said all power in heaven and earth is giving into my hand now watch here now he's reading the scripture he's commenting on it but yet he's trying to help us to see the interpretation of the word our power in heaven is giving into my hand and what God has he poured everything that God was he poured into Christ what Christ was he poured into his church the great fountains are open everywhere ready just get rid of this little easy and so far and open up your heart and say Lord Jesus move into my heart let's go back over that chord again better branimir taking their structure all power in heaven and earth is given into giving on two main he says god everything that was in God he poured into Christ all power and everything that was in Christ he pulled into the church recorded a great fountain he said is already open it's already here we don't need as one day fast to have a we don't need a forty day fast to have it it's a promise it's already here but what is what is hindering it he said get rid of those little Asians those little foxes that spoil the vine those little indifferences there's little doubt those little things that we keep allowing in our life is hammering that fountain up from flooring get rid of those little easing and so forth and open your heart and say Lord moving to my heart there's the Lord I mean in another sense you understand that brother branham here talking about all that was in God he pulled into crash and all that was sink cries he pulled into his church let's take another coat yeah we were as as we as we look at him commenting on this infallible proof of the resurrection and all power in heaven and earth is given into my hand jesus said go into the world and demonstrate these signs to the believers go into the world and preach the gospel Paul said the gospel come not only through words but making the word manifest the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit how far to all the world to who every creature so that all power that is given to the church is for the church to be able to manifest the word it's for the church to be able to be the written episode the Living episode of God's Word now he takes the same tour again why are people why some people can't keep victory he says there he is with all power in heaven and earth is in his hands now even one little wave can move on the ocean without he permitted not even one little wave can move on the ocean without him without him permitting it there's his power and the power and that power of that same thing working in us to make us new creature in Christ Jesus all brother there's who there's where power comes as our faith brings down our faith which is love is casted a casted away all fear we think God wouldn't keep his word when I saw the very love and grace of God then it brings him right down to us that mighty power of God beginning to work into the church love that conquers I tell you love is the most powerful thing there is in the world amen praise the Lord love the Lord with all of your heart and all of your mind and all of your soul and love your brother ask yourself all power in heaven is given unto me see what he says here again I will take this one I know nineteen system he says see it takes a crucification it takes a crushing of the flour to bring the perfume from it it takes a crossing of a life to get the best out of it that there is that's the reason Jesus her to be crutch to bring forth what he was he could not stand before the crucification and say all power in heaven and earth is given unto me he could not say that before he was crucified he could say that after he was crucified because it takes the crouching to be able to bring the perfume from it praise the Lord Amen but after the crucification he could stand and and said all power in heaven and earth is given into my hand but what did it do is taking crucification first place law is taking the crushing and the disappointing of the apostille it see it seems their Savior the one they have loved and seen him even raised him from the dead from the grave they seen him do that but Byrne says it takes a crucification and that is the thing where the church needs death has his own mystery to it it's one of the hard thing for us to itself for us to die to ourselves in things that we that is that is hindering God moving God gave his promise he don't need any Himmel workout or any hymn of a practice anything we can practice for God to be able to bring out his word to his church all he needs is for us to die to ourself and that is one of the things that is high for us to do it take a crouching encroaching hurts just like the crucification hurts and sometimes we have to crucify the thing that we love the most we have to lay it on the altar praise the Lord just listening to the message we be playing the demonology spiritual raiment and see some of the things that brother Branham is talking about there you know how I mean demon power feels so comfortable in the church in the life of the believer that's what he says in the life of Kristen's he sees demon power things that people are learning in their lives and sometimes think the world is just a human nature but those are the very things that is robbing us from the power of God all power in heaven and earth is given unto me the greatest news flash in history nineteen sister 1 just going to read through this caution and pray here tonight he says all men can now receive this this is head to the eyes of the world and foolish to them but those who are born and elected to internalise believe it we see the hour we are living in let's go forward remember in base that we have something behind us praise the Lord suburban MC is working as here and even sometimes it seems to be that you know believers are even blind to it but those that are born and elected to internal life he says we have something behind us Jesus said when he sent his disciples all power in heaven and earth is given unto me sure that's behind us what to every promise that he made because all power is given unto him the father giveth all power unto the son and everything that's in heaven every power in heaven belongs to me said Jesus and I'm with you something to back us up remembering this and we go there is something there is something behind us there is something in us there is something before us praise the Lord and that's how God equipped his church that's how he equips the believer he promised that he would never leave us never forsake us praise the Lord and I think about it a scene that I mean a time that we are in God giving us I mean opportunities for us to be able to do a shout in with God for us to be able to bring ourselves to the winepress word we can be able to identify things in our life and crucified and right there in plain and cried to God praise the Lord amen I remember the brother brother series uh I think that's brother Jesse Smith he said it accounted for I think about it all the time it's just live in my hand he says those men Peter and those disciples after Jesus left him he left them with a promise he said wait Montero you are in jiwu power he says Peter and the rest of the disciples they had to take their days off to be able to get down in the upper room to seek the face of God because they needed this this assurance in their heart for them to be able to go forth and he said now I mean for many that will have the privilege to be home you know we have this situation around us and pretty soon you know we get right into that channel of what I would say of carnality you feel the urge to go out you you want to do this and you want to do this you want to travel you want to do this and you want to get this other one done and when you have all the time then you're looking for this of what you want to rest man is just in a conflict with himself now we have this time I believe that God has a purpose in it spoken word is the original see let's take this other one where Brenham dealing with the same thought now the power of the believing Church Christ has all power in heaven and earth you believe that then what if you are in what if he's in you has Christ got all power Matthew 20:28 18 all right he is the seed word in his body and he in us becomes the C word in us all churches now the power is never mind is by his Spirit is by his promised word praise Lord if if he's in US becomes the word in us all that God was he pulled into Christ we're going right back to the first coat that we read all that God was how is it that's the C word his promise just staying on his promise having an air for pass away but his word will not pass away praise the Lord could it be our God it's looking to his church to be able to release their power that been lying in the church domain just like I said on Sunday he never needed it it's just like we don't need the Holy Ghost when we get over on the other side we need the Holy Ghost now praise the Lord amen when we get on the other side we will already be delivered we will not need deliverance there is yet that we need deliverance if we get on the other side we will not leave healing just breaking out of this body is healing in itself we need healing is right now that we need healing praise the Lord he is the C word and if he's in us then that C word is in us o that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into his church that's the power now watch remember God Lord of reproduction remember after it kinds that's right the seed of Christ the word must come true the body it cannot come no other way the word must come through the body praise the Lord that's that's a kind of a strong statement also you cannot disconnect yourself from the body and expect to have the word you know the word must comes through the body praise the Lord you know and I mean some people taking their own individual individual walk into the rapture you know that one main scripture was was lying there for for for an inner but for this bride is going to be a many member Brian praise the Lord people want to have their individual choice there are individual ideas their individual revelation well god bless you for that but like the prophet of God says here the word comes through the body amen amen praise the Lord all power in heaven and earth is given unto me what a time that we are living in what a day you know the other day or the night I was studying I think I have a some some code here but I'm not going to read into that tonight I won't keep you long I will soon be done here I was I was I was reading and I went home to to on on the top of I was listening to the news or driving either to work or from work and then this woman she was talking about okay I have a right to you talking about all of these coronavirus and how it will affect affect let's listen to this now he sees the the coronavirus who in fact 2/3 of the globe rich research shows as the number of coronavirus cases jumped dramatically in China atop infectious disease science warned that things could get far worse 2/3 of the world's population who catch now the thing that grabbed my mind even though I was listening to the information so I went home and I decided to make a research and read what she was saying on the news because my mind was was captured and what captured my mind was the the scripture over in Revelation chapter 12 verse 4 what Bible talks about his still talking about the great dragon drew a tear part of the stars of heaven and they cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to deliver for to devour her child as soon as it was born then I started also looking at our bird brain I'm talking on that Revelation chapter 12 where he says the red dragon would pull his tail around to Ted of the stars and what he said that is the other calling I mean talking about the - Ted and here is the world I mean the news talking about 2/3 of the world population could be affected with this and then I go back to brother Blair I'm talking about all of those thousands and thousand two million demons that is pull out into the earth now what captured my mind was here is 2/3 wish of course of those times that felt and having coachy I don't have time to go into them we might take it over one of our Bible studies here and look at them and I but brother Branham Ty dad told those demons that never kept their first estees all those angels that never kept their first estees he said in question and answer he said I think there are people today that are possessed with his spirit all the spirit a part of these angelic beings spirit wish rotated off of God that never felt in the beginning and resisted that the devil lie in heaven and 2/3 of the earth is insane and more than death which to term all the angels kick out now he's taking the same measure of the angels that were deceived by this dragon the same the same measure or the same amount of those angels that were deceived by Lucifer he's also taking the same amount to type it with the demons that I counseled in the earth and he ever said that these people I mean I don't know what are they even they even have an idea of their scripture I mean that was the thing that captured my mind when when when I when I heard that on the news I said well let me go back and look at this again and and and what what what actually it is and as you as as well as who found time and looked through some of these things that blood Branham says I mean it's very very very interesting when you look at the to Ted because he even brings it back even to to the human you know brother Branham says here he says that is the same thing in in in in our body with with with our our body our spirit and our soul praise the Lord realizing that 2/3 of our being both body and spirit was born under you know in seen influenced by seen praise the Lord so I was just looking at this number of the 210 it just caught my mind like that praise the Lord but I believe that we are we are in the hour I read this and then we will close it I believe that we are in the our brother branham saying year question and answer he says all power in heaven and earth is giving into my hands and I would go with you what ever you bind on earth I would bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth I will loose in heaven all if the great holy church only recognized is power to do these things but there is so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will cook it happen as long as that is this the church can never stand upright praise the Lord we have to take what God's Word says we have to be standing on his promises now honoring you know what it will happen on that if God says it that's that - it praise the Lord he says the church will never stand upright and and when every talk of fear is Vonage and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then obvious are gone and that church has the power while they have everything that heaven owns behind him they are ambassadors of the Tron absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ own belongs to that ambassador praise the Lord and he says go into go ye into all the world and you are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come this is what is a witness and ambassador the whole power of heaven is right in your hands all what what what do we set what is the church bearing and we said domain is because that we don't recognize these things praise the Lord amen just like we talked the woman as a tithe she's made a a week of that so very fragile but there is just so much inner strength that is in the woman you look through the scripture even in the book of Judges think about Kjell she was the one that took the nail after a beaming like rain over to to her house that's over in the book of Judges now she was the one that received him give him milk to drink and put him to sleep but yet she brought victory to Israel by her wisdom taking the nail through his head and that's how the church is we need to come on the pressure and that's how the woman is before she bring full life into the earth she comes all of that pressure of birth pains and then she I mean she I mean she just I mean she's she's beyond control she's yelling she's doing everything and before you realize she brings full life to the earth that's how the church is praise the Lord for all power is in our hands we have it here and I believe that we are in our word I mean God is going to bring us to this place water is going to take what is happening if net god is going to use this to prepare us for what is going to come but this is no time since for us to just sit around it's no time for us to just fool around this is time for us to recommit ourselves this is time for us to go back and visit our prayer life visit our convenient one-on-one convenient you just think about who ever knew who I've come to this time word I mean everybody will be sitting home praise the Lord we would not have this time of being together and I mean the the governor executive stay home order has already been passed will not be able to come to church we try to to have all the families have people come but I mean so you see all of these things I believe God is bringing us to a place and let us not just take it lightly just like I said other day we might not be you know affected with with the illness and even if one of God's child is affected with the illness God is the a healer praise the Lord Amen wish of course I believe that God is going to bring a testimony yeah you know that the greatest testimony is not that we all stay free it would be more a testimony that sit on touch one of God's children and God delivered him praise the Lord I know many of the believers sending it through the internet now not one of the and not one of the message believer is touched by this plague well it's it would not be strange to us but God is still a healer so even if one any of God's children you know contact it is exposed to a we we are still not a friend instead does not make that person a weaker believer instead let's now show that they don't have the Holy Ghost but it shows that our God is still a healer praise the Lord because all power in heaven and earth is given unto me you know Jesus said that but I believe now the brightest is the same thing I believe the bride can be able to stand before her temptations stand before her Hobbit stand before her struggle and since they turn all power in heaven and earth is given unto me and be able to face the devil on the base of that promise there are promise jesus said because of you just like I said he don't need it in heaven the church needed it here on earth all Jesus was saying is exactly what brother Branham said all that was in God he pulled into Christ and all that was in Christ he was pouring into the church that's what he declared all power in heaven and earth is given unto me that's our promise that is our promise and we have to hold to it praise the
