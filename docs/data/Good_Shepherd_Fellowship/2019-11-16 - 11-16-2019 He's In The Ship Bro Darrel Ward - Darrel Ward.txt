matter because the Bible said where two or three are gathered in my name I will be under midst there's a lot of people in this area still a lot of cars coming in today but God has brought you here the walls caught up in fake news and the world's caught up in opinions and all that but we've been caught up in heavenly places in Christ Jesus tonight amen when the world is started in darkness God has revealed his life to her save man for he said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free were free people tonight amen liberated by the revelation of who we are amen oh praise the Lord Oh to make the pope's after that to know where we come from today where we're going amen before there's ever starve before there was ever an Adam the partner said God knew your name the color of your eyes hallelujah the turn of your hairy man oh these truth shall make us free we come from God we go back to God we're on our journey tonight a man kind of an honor to be with you how are you happy well praise the Lord we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and also uh sister Ginny gray up in British Columbia passed away this morning battling cancer and just remember that family also sumukha Lord's taken him home one but one we've had four funerals in the last month that are at our church and to a husband and wife one passed away and the other passed away about a week apart from each other and it's the nos that they're home together safely in the Hellas amen I want to be faithful to her when her time comes if we don't take the body change and we go by the way of the grave that we will meet again at his house same and so we just look forward to being here this weekend we appreciate brother 1 inviting us to come we ministered with him up in Alaska here back in June and talked about coming this time of the year so it's it's good to be here amen if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of Mark want to read from mark chapter 4 starting at verse 35 appreciate the song service and the worship service and to create an atmosphere Amen so if you're sick tonight I want you to look to him for he is our healer if you're bound tonight he's your deliverer whatever you have need of he will supply all of our needs tonight Amen if the house can believe if house can believe mark chapter 4 verse 35 and the same day when the evening was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they have sinned away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the Honda part of the ship asleep on a pillar and the awake image said unto Him master carest thou not that we perish I want you to know tonight he cares carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind that said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith that something they were in a boat with Jesus and yet they had no faith would that be sad to be in a congregation of believers and have no faith that your problem was greater than your God or your sickness was greater than your ability to be delivered hey man and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey Him amen let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on he's in the ship he's in the ship Heavenly Father Lord as we bow in your presence this evening we are grateful in our hearts Lord Lord I think of my own life Lord where I come from as a little boy we were poor Lord didn't have a lot yet Lord you and your great mercy and your grace you sold us out Lord you give us the greatest treasure that we never possess in Our Lives Lord Lord I may not have a great car and Men I have a great home my clothes Lord or just simple get I'm rich tonight Lord because you've given me your word father we're so grateful no one that heavens and earth will pass away yet your word will never fail Lord Lord we look to that word tonight we don't base it upon emotion dear God upon sensation but we base our faith tonight about thus saith the word of God Lord we believe that you will keep every promise that you made Lord as we heard today on the way over father the message of the trial and now the Prophet brought those Lord who criticized the skeptic and the unbeliever Lord and mr. impatient they try to prove that the words not true Lord but o God you sent your spirit Lord and this our dear God not just to give us word not to give us letter but to give us life their God Lord we believe the Word of God tonight is sharper than any two-edged sword Lord may you come Father and break the bread of life into our hearts and Lord may we not just be here of the word but may we be doers dear thought of that which we hear may we receive it into our hearts dear God for what heard the prophets say that when a son of God Bob faith takes the Word of God into his heart and speaks it back upon his lips Satan cannot stand before that man every mountain has to move it's just the same as deity speaking it o God may we see who we are tonight break our bread to our hearts Lord we pray we'll be careful that when we leave the meetings to give you the praise and the honor and the glory Lord we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says that god bless you may be seated now I'd like to call your attention back again to verse 40 in verse 47 he said unto them why are you so fearful you know I was telling me brother at 1 we was talking a little bit this afternoon and it seems like just in the last few years that the that fear has become such a prominent fault in the news and among the people that doesn't have the fear of homophobia in Allah as Islamic phobia and all these different phobias and we're living at a time that people are afraid to go out of their house they're afraid to go shopping they're they're afraid of fear we're living in a time that the Bible said that men's hearts would fail for fear and so here we find that Jesus are saying why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith and I was thinking about this scripture on fear and faith and as I was thinking about it it reminds me of something that brother Branham said and I trust you don't mind me reading from the prophet and he said I thought tonight I would talk on faith for a little while just to build up own Christian faith I find one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is that they're scared to death what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you're just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who it is that's sitting next to you you say oh that's my neighbor I I know him all right oh that's that's my sister but he said but that's the son of God he myth I thought about Jesus Christ into the family of God is that's the daughter of God sitting next to you they said who is it look beyond the flesh look beyond the neighbor and see who it really is that's standing beside you tonight for the Bible said in a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me but how did he say that we would see him a little while the world will see me no more make ye shall see me how would how will we see you for I'll be with you even in you then where is the dad you see if someone cut through the building drag it across bleeding everywhere women would scream men would faith but that's not even Jesus because he never said he would come that way in this hour he's already done that so if you want to find the christ of your day you've got to find the promise of your hour and when you see the word of your hour made flesh you have found Christ for he is the word amen you know I was thinking of the Prophet down at Jonesboro Arkansas about the blind girl and he said how he was on the platform and they called him out too pretty to an analyst that he prayed for a woman it was dead and life came back into her now the Prophet said that people were everywhere trying to get into the building just to be prayed for and there were so many people around the building that brother Branham could not go back in the way he came out and they said we're better we'll try to get you back in around this way let's go this way now don't miss this friend here the prophet of God was passing through the multitude of the people who came to be prayed for and they didn't even know who he was there was no monitors they couldn't see inside the building they didn't know who it was in the platform they just knew they was a man praying for the sick and God was healing them and can you imagine them very when they cook on the very one they came to see was walking right in front of them no doubt he said excuse me oh I hope I didn't step on you told her excuse me I would you move we're trying to get in to get this man to pray for us and the one they wanted to pray for he was right there in front of them a man and what a sad thing it would be to get there that day and find out that on a Saturday night in November Jesus came right to your church and set right beside you and you missed him because he was focused on your problems we're focused on this or that and brother ben said you have fear because you don't know who you are you don't know who that is sitting beside you that's your brother that your brother that's your sister that's a son a daughter of God adopted into the family of God by Jesus Christ and who are you he says tonight if you're a Christian is there any Christians here if you're a Christian there's one that's true that's true if you're a Christian if you're a believer then who are you you are a son or daughter of God then what are you scared about there's no need of being scared amen that's the thing see there's no need of being scared as long as the devil can't keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then so then we understand not knowing who you are feeds fear my daddy died of Alzheimer's he didn't know who he was he lost his ability to speak the last time I was able to talk to my daddy I had to go all the way back and talk to him about things he told me about when he was a boy and he got scared because he didn't know who he was and people would come into his room because amnesia produces fear as long as you don't know who you are come over here you may not agree with that fear you pull back but it's the truth those people sitting here that's afraid afraid they're gonna miss the rapture they're afraid that their husband's gonna die leave them away or they're afraid that their wife is gonna die oh they're afraid they're gonna get cancer or they're afraid they're gonna lose its fear and as long as safety can rule our lives with fear he's got us where he wants us amen so then we understand that amnesia feeds fear not knowing who you are but realize that who you are produces faith brother Branham says that Jesus had perfect faith how because he knew who he was in the word amen in perfect love cast out all fear and love and faith is the same thing the Prophet said not a perfect love casts out all fear which gives faith then let us come tonight with this revelation of who we are we're not a cult though they say we're a cult we are not a cult we are not an organization we are not a denomination we are a body of the earth a body of believers whose body his body a man the Prophet said the only head start as is your heads the only eyes is your eyes they were not at this building like the church this build is where the church gathers we're the church amen amen oh yeah let us come with that understanding and let her faith cast out all fear amen because if I am the word if I'm a part of the word nothing will defeat me amen I think it's working so we open our scriptures this evening and we find that Jesus is telling this disciples to get into the boat and let us go to the other side so where do you think they're going they're going through the other side you know why because he said so it's just that simple you know why you're healed tonight you're healed not because you feel like you're healed you're not here because the doctor says come on somebody you're here because he said so well I don't feel like it feelings got nothing to do with it has nothing to do nothing to do it we are here because the word is we're here tonight hallelujah amen so you said let us get into the boat we must go to the other side now the reason that they're making this journey is because across the water on the other side in Ghaderi there is a man who's living among the tombs we know him as the maniac of Ghidorah he's a cutter modern terms he cuts himself to relieve his pain we've got him in the message we do I was the other here in Missouri here not long ago and I said you take a razor blade and you touch your arm and you say it's a sickness I said it's demon possession and this girl let out a scream and run out of the building and the brothers chased her down the street and called her and brought her back and on the way to church that night she took a razor blade and cut herself and threw it out the window and her mother said that's a demon she said it's a sickness but the Word of God called it out on her hallelujah amen he was a cutter he lived among the tombs and he caught himself but he didn't want to be that way he was crying out for help he was worried deliverance so Jesus started to a ship and cross the stormy sea that night for the word soul that call a word needy so and that poor fella maybe an old gray-haired mother praying for him somewhere or mama don't never give up on your children don't never give up on that boy just keep holding a mouth aim ahead hallelujah Jesus across the stormy sea all the way over into Gaddar to give mercy to one man Oh God let me be that man to nobody in this church brother Scott won't so blessed it go and let me have it if nobody wants deliverance let me have it if nobody wants mercy God let me be that man tonight Lord because I need mercy I need grace you don't need it can I have yours in hey man you see he's the same yesterday today and forever and that saved Jesus tonight he'll come for glory for one needed so setting in a humble church tonight the same one he'll come every time he'll come to where he's wanted but he never comes to where he's doubted they live I said he comes to where he's wounded but he never comes to where he's doubted then god help us tonight the last out every doubt to lay us out every fear and believe him that there's nothing hallelujah there is nothing in OPH ing there is nothing that can stop him from coming where a soul cries out to hear me man the weird crippled boy to go but where didn't stopping the waves couldn't stop me the storms couldn't stop him dead thousand demons could not stop him from coming you're a man who was demon-possessed living in a graveyard a man there's nothing that could stop him from coming to you when you call on him it wasn't the man's voice that touched Jesus he was on the other side the lake it was his faith day man it's not how much we could scream it's how much we can believe a man like the little boy in the shopping mall that young man there he told the property said I'm lost his lost can be he said brother Brandenburg bill I'm like a coin in a sand pile I'm lost you know what brother Ben said to him but you don't have to be I'm depressed you don't have to be I'm depressed you don't have to be I'm lost you don't have to be lost you know what your problem is you've not surrendered you've never fully surrendered to him I was lost as loss can be I'm like a coin and a fan power lost but the Prophet said I said to that boy you don't have to stay that way there is someone who can find you there is someone standing present now who can find you the minute you want to be found and the Prophet said are you ready are you ready and the boy said yes sir I'm ready brother bill Omar are you ready to not say oh honey just believe if you're doubting just remember he'll never be at your door doubt will always keep him away but if you love him and you want you to make man he'll come anytime you call for him he's ready to come at any time hey man there's one standard present here tonight who can find you the moment you want to be found hey man the problem of a there's a lot of times we like those little habits in our life because it feeds the flesh hey man hard to crucify the flesh amen but when you're ready to really die to yourself he's waiting hey man we're not waiting on him he's waiting on us people come all the time I've prayed for thousands of people in 30 years of ministry people come say I want to be closer to God like you can just take a wand and just wave a wand over them and automatically look closer you don't happen that way but if said you want to fall deeper in love with God you know what he said to do he didn't say come get the preacher to pray for you that's not what he said he said you want to get closer to God you know what he said to do you want to fall deeper in love with God you know what the Prophet said to do read your Bible and pray but it's easier to get somebody to pray that we get closer to God than for us to open our Bibles and read oh my god it's getting quieter corner I'm think me an egg man take a man you know it's the truth praise haleluya thanksgiving hell are you a man serving turkey huh whoo I doubt I'm the turkey I don't know amen don't doubt him just believe him he'll come any time you call upon him the promise said there's one standing president who can find you the moment you want to be found he can hear you the moment you want to be heard you know the father God said God wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed so we find the meeting is coming to a close and he tells his disciples to get into the boat let us go to the other side he's filling the pool of the Maineiacs need that's what's driving him that's what's driving him across is the pool it's that man calling for him he didn't say boys there's a storm coming so we're gonna wait now we're gonna get up about 6:00 and eat breakfast and then you know we'll slip square away our gear and we'll let the storm pass a little bit but no no he never let the storm tutor him he said let us get into the boat and let us go to the other side he's filling the pool of the Maineiacs need you know what brought him here tonight your need we're two and three are gathered in my name well me and our midst aim there said he get into the boat to get into the ship and Jesus is with him and they begin to cross the sea now Jesus being the word he knew all things can you say him into that he knew that maniac was on the other side he knew he would deal with that tomorrow he knew the storm was coming he knew that Devils would try to drown him he knew that pig farmers would reject him yes before they'd rather live with the Hogs didn't live with Jesus that's what's wrong with Laodicea they let them come home free they'd rather water in the sin of Laodicea than live with Jesus amen thank you ever said that god bless you he knew the devil's were trying to drown him he knew that big farmers would reject him and ask him to leave he knew all things we said the son can do nothing of himself but while he sees the father do so he already seen this he already knew what was happening but he spoke letters pass to the other side that was his word and the Bible said his word would not return unto Him void but it will accomplish that which it was said to do he knew the ways were coming he knew the storm was brewing he knew the winds would pick up but he also knew the word would carry them through so he finds him a place to sleep and he lays down knowing that the storm is coming he wasn't worried he wasn't nervous because he knew what was happening you see he understood that the storm no matter how great it would be oh god don't miss this he knew that the storm would not control him but he would control the storm a man who no matter how great the storm would be in your life and I remember you're the master so you see it it doesn't it seemed like every time we try to do something for the Lord we try to help someone or try to get closer to God to walk in obedience to his word it's them kind of times that the devil does everything he can to stop you ain't it something you go all day without a text and as soon as you go into your prayer closet me me me every time you try to get closer to God every time you try to do something but brother my sister don't let that deter you don't look at that in a negative light well God must not love me every time I try to come to him I have more trouble no understand it's your enemy he's trying to bring a storm in your life he's trying to seek your chef amen amen hallelujah it's them times when we try to do something for the Lord when we try to draw closer to look it's the intime that snags come hindrances Cubs storms begin to rage like Moses when God told him when you bring my people out bring them to this mountain and worship me here now that was God's desire was for Israel now notice God did not go steal Pharaoh's slaves that's not what he does he didn't go steal a bunch of man slaves and make him his people but he told Moses you go down and tell Pharaoh thus saith the Lord Israel is my son he's had time to get slaves he come to get his inheritance a man they said when you bring them out you bring them to this mountain where do you think they're gonna worship God on that mountain why God said so the here they come out look at the hindrances the Red Sea three days in the desert with no water bitter waters trials tribulations but Moses kept moving forward because God gave him the commission he knew he was in the will of God he hid the Red Sea he hid the dry desert he hid the bitter waters but the Red Sea or anything else that stood in the way of God's will Moses was commissioned to speak and go forward to Moses why prior to me have not I commissioned you Moses have not I told you what my will is havin I gave you my word did speak to go forward Moses never hear God say go back he always says go forward Amen you're in the line of duty you receive justification move forward to sanctification resentful case you move forward the restoration of the gifts receiving of the Holy Ghost if you're sick and you can't get well and you've done all the doctors told you to do and you're in the line of duty just keep moving forward told Moses speak to the people tell them to go forward keep moving forward Jesus said let us go over to the other side you see he had a job to do he was tired he was weary he laid down to rest no one he's in the will of the Father moving forward across the sea to the maniac of Ghidorah now the disciples here they go moving across the lake or the sea they were in the message of the hour so you know what we're in the message man here just right there to let the preacher sweat we're just gonna sit here because we're in the message wake me up with sis things I really like the everything I worked hard today Boise desert Church is the place that I can come and just after all I'm predestinated I'm elected and chosen of God before the foundation of the world so why do I have to a man why do I have to say hallelujah why should I ever have to sweat in church that's what we pay the preacher for sometimes friends you see this people's attitude they remove it we're in the message in the hour Jesus with him we've just had a greater in Bible they were testifying of all they'd seen him do oh it should be smooth sailing no worries no bumps we're his disciples he loves us were elected were chosen were predestinated we're moving with Jesus we've got Jesus hold the boat how much better could it be how much greater could it be man I tell you right now from here on out it's smooth sailing but you see there's only one problem with that Jesus never promised that he never said get into the boat it's going to be smooth sailing all the way across the waters going to be like he never said that he just said get in the boat let's go to the other side he never promised that he'd ever said there wouldn't be trials he never said that wouldn't be suffered he never said we wouldn't be laughed at he never said we wouldn't be made fun of he never promised a smooth sailing he never said there wouldn't be storms but he did say I'll never leave you he just said let us go over to the other side so they're sailing across the sea and the storm begins to blow in now Peter is the seasoned fisherman he's probably been in the message longer than any of them and no doubt he'd seen stars before so he began with his own ability with this own strength to manipulate the boat just like we try to do with our education we try to figure it out with our heads instead of believing it with our hearts so Peter said you know boys I've got this I've been out here on this water a lot I've seen worse things than this he just thought he had it hadn't even started yet hey y'all don't worry now just give me those oars and I don't take his right to the shore there hallelujah but you see Peter failed to realize this just wasn't a storm this was a storm Trotter said Jesus was crossing the sea the devil knew is on the road to a great victory a great victory of God and he tried to drown him he tried to stop the victory overhead tried to tell him that night he caused the storm to come up 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they drowned him that night he was so tired the Prophet said he was laying in the stern of the boat even the waves didn't wake him up is it that something hurricane category 5 wins 20 foot waves never woke him up you see it wasn't a storm that woke him up it wasn't the wind that woke him up it wasn't the Thunder that woke him up it wasn't the lightning that woke him up you know I woke him up it was the voice of his disciples down south we can happy where I'm from oh I'm trying to behave it but I know this is northern country huh Oh God that just burns me inside of me breast Scott this storm begin to rise up and as the sails were torn have the oars begin to break and toss about like a like a bottle the Prophet said like a bottle stopper on a choppy water maybe 20 foot waves and this great oh my can you imagine the sales were taught the arse broke the boat was feeling with you talk about a bad place to be that's a bad place to be especially if you can't swim but you know what I would rather be in a boat with the sails torn the oars broke and the boat filling with water and no life jacket and have Jesus on board then to be in the Titanic without him keep the right kind of companies I like to keep the right kind of company a man so the waves and all this was dashing but where was Jesus it looks like if he really cared he'd be right up there with them it looked like if he really cared about his disciples he'd have his hand no Peter shut up here be careful now it's getting ready it's gonna get bad here in about three minutes if you really care would not he had being standing right behind him to instruct them to comfort them to let him know but he was a real scholar they were up there battling that storm and he was in the boat asleep you know why because he knew the outcome Oh God you see if you know the out you say brother down I lost a big battle listen to me he never said we'd win every battle you show me anywhere in the Bible where he said we would win every battle I've lost many battles I'll be honest with you I'm an honest preacher I have lost many a battle I've had to go back a many a time and repent none of you have I'm moving up here there he never said we would win every battle he just said we win the war and we do win the war the battle doesn't matter anymore hey looks like if you really cared for them he knew the storm was coming he knew when it would hit but where was he in the boat asleep knowing the end from the beginning he was God he was infinite he know what was going to happen he knew when it was going to happen but it only happened to test their faith didn't he say so later you see so real God in his testing time when a real son of God in his testing time he does not walk by sight for the Bible says we walk by faith and not by sight now you can walk my sight or you can walk my faith but you cannot walk my both at the same time so in a real child of God in this time of testing he doesn't want my sight the physical eyes are close to the things around him they only walk by the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ looking to his word and believing that he will keep every promise of his word exactly what he said he would do you know he said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you know here a couple of years ago I was down in many Louisiana I preached there in February and I always preach every year the first week in February of done for several years so I bought my ticket I'm when I fly a lot with Delta and I bought my ticket and I went ahead and got my seat where I wanted to sit two months in advance so I go down there I preach and I get on the boat I just get on my I get on the plane now get in the seat then I picked out two months in advance and a man comes and sets down beside me he said you from around here I said no sir from Tennessee he said what brings you down here I said I'm a preacher said oh you're a preacher I said yes sir it's when I go to a big Pentecostal Church fifteen hundred people I said that's wonderful I'm just so happy the Lord's blessing you he said Oh since you're a preacher let me ask you a question I said well I'm not too smart but if I can help you I'll be glad to do it he said my daughter was getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport and I was looking on the internet and he said I come across something so unusual and since you're a preacher I'm gonna ask you about it I said well sir if I can help you I'd be glad to do it he said have you ever heard of a man by the name of William Branham that brought a smile that wasn't easy whenever I said yes sir I said his grandkids go to my church oh this guy went ballistic he didn't say look we sitting here tonight we was on an airplane he was talking so fast I thought he's talking in tongues we talked all the way to Atlanta about though he said looking I'm not the pastor there but would you come and preach for us he took my car said I want to tell him about you would you I said sir I'll be glad to come course when he told his preacher I guess I never got to call it but you know what I got out of that was this think of this two months before that man ever knew he had a question God that had the answer set beside him and tonight oh whatever your problem is tonight whatever your need is God had the answer amen don't walk my what you see with your eyes walk by faith in the Word of God hey man hallelujah knowing he'll keep every word testing sometimes God lets afflictions here there's people to test them to test their faith he was listen to this I love this he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner but see how the devil tries to tell us this happened to you because you're a sinner but sometimes they don't happen to you at all because you're a sinner it happens to you because the Prophet said in victory day the more loyal the more testing he was not rebuking a sinner he was testing the saint God does that the test that's why you're sick tonight maybe that's why the law love the revivalist to see what you're going to do about it and there's something when we first come to this message while we couldn't sit still for nothing and then all the things comes against us and we find herself hardly getting to church but I wonder sometimes if God allows those things to come into our lives to see if we serving by feelings for we serving by the word because you see whether I'm on the mountaintop shot in the victory or whether I'm in the deepest Valley of my life it does not determine who I am I'm not a son of God by motion I'm not a son of God by feeling I'm a son of God by the Word of God think of that friends he's every hill little rabble to see what you're going to do about it see where trouble sits in the storms are so great and the wind and the rain and the lightning they were so think about this they were so busy fighting for their lives that they forgot the very one that said let us go to the other side the very creator was in the boat with them you see friends listen I'm not belittling you I'm not being listened I'm not belittling your problems I'm not trying to ignore you we have real problems amen I have suffered this past year as I tell you there's been days I've had that barely all I could do to get to the pulpit to preach because my back was so bad I know what it is to hurt I know what it is to lay in bed at night and you can't get no relief same before if your living room we cry like a baby because the pain is so bad that side anybody know what I'm talking about that side ignor faint it'll drive you crazy so I'm not belittling your troubles to that please don't misunderstand me I'm not trying to belittle your problems I'm not trying to belittle your troubles I'm not trying to belittle your sorrow we hurt we're human we have emotions it hurts we cry but I'm just telling you that no matter how great our problem is no matter how great our sickness is no matter how great our trouble is it is not greater than I remembered he had it all in control they should I knew they should have remembered the miracles they shouldn't remember how he fed 5,000 what was he letting it happen when he got into the ship he knew it was going to happen why was he letting it happen what was he doing testing their faith that's what the Prophet said he said you believe what I tell you he asked him do you believe what I tell you you know we sing a song oh we believe and sometimes he lets things to happen to see if that's just a song or a confession of her faith he said to them do you believe will I tell you and finally when the waves I'll try to hurry I don't know how long brother I'll try to hurry finally when the waves had them beat down and the wind was just too strong we're going to sink everything's crashing in what are we going to do what are we going to do in older sphere you know their anguish the greatest storm of their life ten thousand demons trying to drown them they finally realized he's in the boat wait a minute where's Jesus he says about with us then the answer to the storm was in the boat awake the master help us will perish he gets up and he rebukes the storm in the wind and the sea obey he says peace be still and Amelie they're standing there still wet and it looks like glass on the sea and he turns to them and says why are you so fearful where is your faith did not I say to you were going to the other side has not he promised us a rapture has not he promises the body changed that's not he told us that even the grave could not keep our bodies down was not our with you the whole time think about that he was with him the whole time you know there's a right of passage among the natives Americans down our way when a boy gets about 12 year old they take him out into the woods or a secret place that only the father knows about and they tie his feet loosely in his hands loosely and they blindfold he put a blindfold over his eyes and this young boy must shed on a stump or a rock or wherever the father chooses to set him down and he must sit there all night long if he cries out he fails to test if he gets up and walks around he fails the test if he pits out his blindfold to see what's happening he fails the test he must sit there in the coldness and the darkness of the night all not wrong but at the rising of the Sun when the rays of the dawn of a new day strike the boy's face he can come out of the ties and he could take off the blindfold in its at that moment he's a man it's called the rite of passage so the father takes the boy out sets him in the woods puts leather loosely around him so he can get out of he wants to get out of it he can get out of it toss him loosely and the boy sits there about eight o'clock you know it starts getting a little cold you know that dampness of the night starts setting in about eleven o'clock even crickets sound like Panthers I used to go camping with my girls I told my wife leave the door unlocked the first time the cloudy's yep we'll be in it's a it's just something about those night noises when you can't see nothing and ever rustle of the leave is it a bear is it a show knee warrior looking for a scalp is it a coyote epochal what is it they don't know just they're all not the coldness and the rustle of the leaves and all wrestling with the sphere wrestling with his emotions wrestling with the thoughts that's going through his brain but at the rising of the Sun he takes doubt that it comes out of the tie as he takes off the blindfold and he looks around and it's only then that he realizes sitting right behind him is his daddy you see he was there all the time even in the greatest part of the storm he was slow he's the same yesterday today and forever which I believe that if he comes there storm by being in the ship with them but I believe tonight that he can calm our storm by being in the ship with us the answer to their storm was in the ship with them and the answer to your storms tonight is in the ship with you it's the same Jesus it's the same Jesus he's just changed ships well the Bosworth said brother Brennan you know what fellowship is he said well I don't know that I do brother Bosworth he said fellowship brother Branham is two fellows in the same ship he's in the ship where I said that's right there's quite a bitchin bunch of us this afternoon there's quite a bunch of us this afternoon in the old ship the Oh ship and Scion what is the ocean for sign it's the bride amen as we travel the sea of life let us remember that the Bible says many of the affliction of the righteous but the Lord delivered them from them all paul said to timothy persecutions and afflictions which came unto me at antioch and in kicking him in Lystra what persecutions aren't dude but out of them all out of them all Paul said the Lord delivered me sometimes his disciples get in physical troubles that can't remedy sicknesses cancers the doctors don't know what to do about but remember who's in the ship for he said as the father sent me even so have I sent you as the father sent me even so send are you how did the father send him the father the sin he went with him and was in him and the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in a man Christ in his church his branches energizing him bringing forth the same fruit that he brought forth when he was here on the earth he's when he comes to the church in the last days he in the fullness of the light of the Sun in that day the Bible says in that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful the VADs not beautiful you go to a bunch of grapes you don't whatever say my goodness won't you look at that vine you don't say that you don't even look at the bad there's no beauty in the five the Bible said there was no beauty that we should be holding where's the beauty it's in the fruit and in that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful why because that vine has put forth another branch and it's bearing the fruit of the Holy Ghost bride a man o going to God he's in the ship tonight what ship this ship you're still in the ship Lord the O ship of Zion carrying us across the tumble seas when the devil sweeps in with the storm what difference does it make as long as he's in the ship what difference does the storm make as long as he's in the ship Oh father be with us now walking to the hearts of the people tonight then let us come as we come to close some of the kids get restless when we come to the closing that let us come with this doll tonight let us come with this revelation of who we are we are not a cult we are not an organization we are not a denomination but we are a body his body represented on the earth libram said how did he call Christ the groom here how did he call Christ here by the words of the prophets so however that however the groom came to the earth the bride must also come the same way because the same word speaks for the groom speaks also for the bride that's what he said so then however Christ the groom came is the way the bride must come also so did Jesus come by denomination No then the bride will not come by denomination how did Jesus come by the word of the prophets he said if you don't believe me leave the one who sit me I said of Moses is our property save me and even know Moses you know me have the very words of Moses made flesh amen hey man you don't believe those things believe the works that I do they'll tell you who I am so the same word speaks for the group speaks also for the bride so how did the groom come by the words of the prophets how did he vindicate how did he vindicate the groom the bridegroom by a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him how will he fin de Kate his bride by a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him Malachi 4:5 at 6 the same word speaks for the groom speaks also for the bride then who are we we're not a denomination it's a shame I'm closing but it's a shame that people come to church three times we give them a message book and column brother we're not brothers because we come to a message church we're brothers because we're birthed in Christ come on somebody if we ain't careful we'll just become another denomination amen they let us come with this revelation of who we are and the only thing that can call him on the scene is for us to awaken him the Prophet said the only thing that can call Jesus on the scene tonight is for us to awaken him in ourselves he's in the ship you're a son you're a daughter of God you have authority to speak to the storm to speak to the sickness to speak to the fear and say no more when the true beliefs sounding when the trumpet sounding like Jubilee they beat them people they stripped a mother name but when they heard that gospel Jubilee trumpet sound they could throw that rake down and they could turn to him and say do not hit me one more time by the way my name is John you've called me everything for 50 years my name is John I think it's time you tell the devil cows my property I am NOT a Laodicean I am a son of God a man hey man he's in our ship tonight awaken him at his word amen exercise your god-given rights as believers rebuked the storm rebuked the fear rebuked that habit rebuked that thing that bothers you speak to that and stay no more I'm a son of God I'm a sham guard take your god-given right and drive them off of your land tonight speak to your hair and tell it to grow out speak to that thing that torments you say no more awaken him tonight awakening within yourself let him know tonight that you believe his word he's in the ship tonight now what I preach is either the truth or it's not but I say to you tonight I believe with all my heart what I have told you tonight to be the truth this almost entire message is made up of scriptures and quotes this is our promise this is our inheritance this is who we are he's in the ship tonight let the winds blow let's see any in fat Fox let Fox foxy and I ain't interested in that well people are dividers their families are divided herself over politics and they both work for the same boss don't entangle yourself and those things keep your eyes on the promise many strange things were happening in the days ahead it'll seem like you're alone but you're not alone listen to me you're not alone he's with us tonight and when those strange things begin to happen do not fear do not quit do not run do not turn around just keep marching forward because he's in the ship tonight do you love him out on the waters storms raging high darkness around him troubled their minds fear gripped their hearts they thought that they would die but they fail to remember the master was not he spoke the words and the winds all stood still even though waters obeyed his will and he calmed their storms just like he will mind if I just remember he lives deep inside so why should I worry why should I fear the very same Jesus is always sold near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry and I'll call on his name to the storm passes by we read in the Bible how he walked with them brought light to the darkness when the way grew salty how great it would be to have his footsteps in mind to walk with the master all of the time and when trials comes and death seems so now I'll call on the master I know you'll get there on time and when sickness comes my body's all I have to do is call on his name so why should I worry why should I fear the very same Jesus it's always sold he lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry that I could call on his name to the storm passes by why should I worry why should the very same Jesus it's always salty he lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry and I can call on his name till the storm passes by Oh Lord Jesus tonight father no doubt Lord in the congregation this sighs if people have needs Lord perhaps they got a bad report from the doctor but perhaps it's coming in this week Lord sometimes you'll give us the word to prepare us for the things that lays ahead oh it may be hearts are heavy tonight brother Scott Lord speaking of his free and passing it leaves a hurt in our hearts God maybe self dealing with oppression maybe some with depression Lord maybe some have a fear the fear of missing the rapture a fear that your children's going to be lost a fear that their husband's not coming home from work

you free so father whatever it would be tonight whether our need would be the greatest need in this building or whether it would be something that others would look at it say my goodness [Music] but

troubles of fears Lord you control them all and I pray to that Lord Jesus that whatever the need would be in this building may the person realize Lord that not only are you in the building but you're

coat throw up their wind and jump down maybe he didn't know exactly what was going to happen but all he knew was that was his land they belong to him you would give it to him and he put his trust in
