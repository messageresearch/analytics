TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and just talk his side of religion and the pharisees laughed at jesus and made fun of him or something they did as they in that day and that he just thought it off that wasn't enough but it's an ordinary message he had to deliver he just sat there and he's in his presence and that was all it was to him it didn't mean nothing to him but if he'd been conscious that boy could rise up from the dead today and set in this meeting this week he'd have done something about it he'd have a testimony that would have shook us all but he wasn't conscious now in the scene here there's something wrong it is it isn't right as jesus watched that boy go away tired and weary but the whole setting there's something wrong them pharisees hated jesus why would they invite him for a guest of honor when they hated him that pharisee had a as the old gambler's expression he had us something of his sleeve he had a trick card in his sleeve because they hated jesus i believe jesus realized that right then see people must have things in common my mother she used to have an expression birds of a feather flock together you don't see you don't see buzzards and doves feeding together there there one's a scavenger and the dove couldn't eat the buzzard's food because he don't have any gall he couldn't digest it and you don't see believers and unbelievers together unless there's some kind of a purpose for there's something something wrong this guy i had a trick up his sleeve you want to play it on jesus how you take people like you take young people young teenage children they don't like to be around the old folks because they they have things in common the young married couples they have things in common the old people they don't want to be around the kids so much they they got things in common when you see a little girl hanging with grandma all the time now there's there's something wrong there's too much difference in their age she's either grandma's pet or grandma's got a sack of candy somewhere see there's there's a trick somewhere now i got a grandchild myself and i know there's a little trick somewhere seen and you see her hanging around grandma grandma's got a uh sack of candy or something so this fair she had something up his sleeve it all happened at a ministerial meeting where they gathered together and the subject was discussed about this fellow who called himself a prophet and they didn't believe he was a prophet because they couldn't see a man that wouldn't go along with them and all their doctrine that could be a prophet and so in this ministerial meeting they had decided that he wasn't a prophet and this old pharisee was going to prove it to him that he wasn't a prophet the pharisee was going to to make it sure and to show the congregation all the people in that city that he wasn't a prophet before he ever visit the city he'd never been in that city before so before he come he's going to expose him all that spirit it still lives going to expose it do something to hinder the meeting that he would have had there so we find out that he said i'll make a dinner and i'll invite everybody and get everybody in the city around and then we'll prove that he's not no prophet we'll prove it so pharisee might have thought that if he were doing this he would have he would have got a little uh maybe become after a while one of the presbyters or something he'd it really made a hit with his group he was going to make fun at the banquet of the lord jesus to prove that he wasn't a prophet do put him on the spot somewhere then he would be a big fella among them become some great man now we find out that the courier returns back and tells his master i found him he promised and he'll be here because i'll just tell the way he acted he'll be here all right now the pharisee waited for this certain time and they know when to make this banquet when everything was just right perhaps you will think in our little drama tonight that that he made it in a time when the grapes was ripe if he was ever in palestine when a great time or even in california when i'm great big clusters of grapes are just bleeding right the whole uh country the valley is just full of of that sweet smelling odor from those grapes he knows just when to make it right so he set that time on a certain day they would have this feast and finally the time come with when the feast was going to be carried on and he invited everybody to come that he could to come up all the celebrity and all the associations and so forth and all the clubs that was in the city that he belonged to it was all coming out to his great fine palace that set out high stood out as an estate there in the city and the time arrived for this to be done of course the yard was all taken care of and the tables were all set and the banquet room ready and then now he's going to have to take care of the his guests when they come any host will do that so he had to hire some stable boys because some of his hosts would become or some of his guests would be coming on uh chariots and some riding on mules some walking so anyone that makes a uh has a banquet has to make ready to entertain their guests so pharisee got everything just fixed up in all of his servants and got them ready got the stable boys where they could take the horses and all the fodder and stuff ready for them and then you had an innkeeper or door keeper that had to take up the invitations cause you you could not come unless she was invited and to take up the invitations he had their names down ever who was going to be there and they come they identified their name and so they could come in then let's just look what had what they had to do for a while i've been in the orens and maybe many of your hands and watch how they do it it's it's really striking and you notice then when everything's taken care of then when they come in the door the first thing the the keeper the door as to the r and they tell who they are he looks on his list and here's the name then he checks it then what he does he takes his staff sets it in the corner the boys takes the horses if he's walking or if he's on the horse and puts it in the stable now the next thing he does he enters into a hall and in here there's a bunch of a man what's called the feet washers the flunkies it's the lowest paid job there is is a foot wash flunky and to think of it we who think we're somebody and our lord identified himself on earth as a foot wash flunky that's exactly what he did and then we think we're somebody we'll run off here to school and get a little uh education and it and learn to say a few big words and come back and put on a suit of clothes and walk out here and want to be called doctor reverend or somebody i was up at a big museum not long ago and looking at some of the estimation of a man weighed a 150 pound how much chemicals there was in his body you know how much there is when he's all rendered up is worth 84 cents then you'll put a 10 hat on it 84 cents and a 500 mink coat and turn your nose up if irene it would drown you and then go along taking care of that 84 cents right thinking you're somebody and you don't give a care you act like it about that soul it's worth 10 million worlds the difference the rational how we can get now this foot wash flunky he had to wash their feet now in the when he traveled in palestine the palestinian garment is a robe it hangs low and then the underneath garment this comes to about the calf of the leg here or the underneath garment and as the the animals and the man travel the same trail the animals of course going along the trail and and and as as they travel the same trail and and the dust would come up from where the animals had been and it was a stink in the dust and it got on their feet when they were perspiring and their feet was shot with sandals and that would get all full of perspiration and and be wet sticky and then this stink from where the animals that crossed the trail would the palestinian garments sweeping like a skirt down low would pick up this dust and it would get beneath here and get all over their feet and over their their limbs and they really smell like that that trail where the animals have been so coming into a home like those pharisees had they're sent into persian got those great big fine rugs and and everything why you wouldn't feel welcome to come in before the host and uh and and then be all stinky like that so they had a way of taking care of that they had a a foot wash flunky and he stayed there and as soon as you come in and your name was registered the boy's taking the horses or your animals and taking them back to feed them one group of boys and then the doorkeeper recognized you by the chart that he had in his hand and then you're ready for the foot wash flunky then you go in you set your foot up he pulls off the sandal sets it up to a place so he'll know where you're at and on this other side he has a little shoe and actually gets to washing your feet washing it all off real good all the dust and everything make you fresh then he puts on this little cloth uh a shoe that goes over like you see in airplanes and crossing over overseas now they give them to you at night when you like uh the women have those little things they wear when they're not wearing stockings i see my wife and daughter and them getting some time they it's a little i i i don't know what they call them but it's just like a bottom part of a sock you know and you put it on your foot there's something on that order on this little higher because you don't want to take your old dirty sandal and walk over them rugs in there so then your feet's washed then you've got the next thing takes place you got this little booty on i'll call it and then the next thing takes place there's a man standing there with a towel over his shoulder and he's got some ointment in his hands and that's a perfumed oil now the direct rays of that palestinian sun upon your neck is just blistering and another thing that dust that picks up sometimes get into their beard and in their hair and this man stands here then with ointment and he holds it out in this little pan you get on your hands and rub it in your face and over your neck then you take this towel and wipe it off groom your hair now sometimes this is very rare because it really gives a a wonderful odor they get it many times from way high in the mountains on a wild rose bush you've seen a rules at the pedal drops off and it it gets a little a little apple-like on it and out of there they crush it and get this perfume it's said that the queen of sheba when she come to solomon brought much of this fine perfume of that and give it to solomon very rare so hard to get into the mountains and then when they wipe this their beard and cross their necks and with this towel groom themselves now they're ready to to meet the host to meet the one that invited them see they wouldn't feel right to go into all that dirt that's why feet washing see they they were smelling bad and they had to have their feet washed and with their big old heavy sandals on them fine rugs they wouldn't feel right they'd feel embarrassed but now his feet's washed now he's all groomed he smells with the perfume that's on him from this ointment what they call anointing their heads with oil and rubbing it on their face then wiping it with a towel now he's freshed up now the next thing he does he meets his horse the one that invited him he feels like meeting him now he wouldn't feel like meeting with all that dirt on him so he's all groomed up and ready now then the host meets him at the door and they have a very odd way and it's still in some of the churches a greeting with a kiss so they take a hand cross this way embrace one another man uh with with their arms around each other like this and kiss each other on the neck and when the host kisses you you are welcome that's the welcome kiss now you wouldn't want your horse to kiss you with all that old dirt and stuff on on you so you had to be cleaned up before you're kissed welcome but oh one once you're kissed welcome you are a full-fledged brother that's all you could today the only thing you can do like today you go in the house and you feel at home you're one of them he's kissed you welcome you remember judas kissing jesus hypocritically see because if he kissed him it was a welcome it was a friend kiss not in the lips but on the neck kiss them on the neck now we notice saying that you could go in if you want to go to the refrigerator it would be today and get you a great big sandwich and lay across the bed and eat it just make yourself at home you're welcome come in that's your all right now you just feel one of the family now because you're on the inside now you get all this done and anointed and uh all fixed up you're kissed welcome and then you go in shake hands at the banquet you meet your friends the host of done kissed you in and so you're you're free now you just feel like you're one of them you've been invited you've been clean you've been kissed welcome and now you're what i'm going to have your fellowship now about this time i'd imagine that rose lamb out there and the barbecue pit in the back was just smelling all around over the country with them grapes and things you'd imagine the poor people standing around the fence their mouth water they wasn't invited in just the celebrity to this so the the feast was now getting in pretty good sway everything is getting along fine for good sweet now i'd imagine pharisee and his all of his friends is tipping the glass one to another and taking a good healthy drink are the very best wines there was in palestine at the time because they were rich they could afford it and they everybody the women they're fine jeweled women was over in a corner having their fellowship sitting around on the vans and so forth as a custom was in that day and the man all up having their toast and talking and the priests and all the rabbis and everything having a great time and the feast is getting pretty well on the way and then jesus although busy as he was in his busy schedule he always keeps his appointment you can depend on that he keeps his appointment now let's look into the room and see what's going on i can see pharisee over there tipping his glass and saying rabbi you know what and the great conversation going on the businessman talking of their business and everything the banking banquet's in full swing now this great feast but look setting over against the wall not being noticed because jesus he kept his appointment he come he always keeps his word all his promises he fulfills but notice he he's sitting over there dirty i hate to say that it kills me to see it but his feet was dirty he hadn't been anointed he hadn't been kissed welcome though he was invited that's like some of our modern revivals the frenchman calls him jesus jesus with dirty feet could you imagine it he was invited and he come and there he is it got in some way and unnoticed he sets over as a wall flower he was just as much out of place there he is in some of our modern revivals banquets so-called religious gatherings he was out of place nobody is paying any attention to him they were too busy with other things although he was invited but he wasn't welcome when he come what happened to that foot wash flunky how did he ever miss that opportunity yeah i wish i would have had his opportunity oh my if i knew he'd be coming out i've been standing there waiting for him i i i'd been ready for it how did he do it now let's not condemn too much because we might do the same thing and not know it he missed him oh my notice he comes today to our callings too he comes in our midst now i don't want to say this but i i must say it and in our midst he's understood among us sitting there just as dirty to the people as he was then it's exactly right call them holy rollers and everything else and yet we cry for a revival and he comes and when he does come we treat him about like they did then somebody raised up in the spirit of god holler a man or scream or something like that when jesus happens to pass by why they put out the church well they think that's an awful shame to disgrace the church to people when it's jesus himself passing by and we can see him come and identify his word and do just like he did then and today they sense fortune telling mental telepathy or some evil spirit before the people he's just as dirty as he was sitting there jesus the word of god and we do nothing about it we're too interested in our organization or our our social standing we're ashamed to be called by his name we're actually ashamed of him they was ashamed of him because he was dirty the guests didn't know him and they was ashamed of him because he's dirty that's the way it is today they're still ashamed of him because they pile the dirt that they can upon call it holy rollers and everything else that they can think of nobody does nothing about it there he says dirty feet wallflower at the party wallflower in a religious meeting invited we asked him to come for revival when he comes we treat him the same way they did there he come and identify himself but nobody wants nothing to do with him if he can pull some kind of a gimmick or or or do some kind of a miracle like he did before pilate pilot his only opportunity he ever had and he asked he'd want to see something done won't it let's see some sign he ought to repent that's what this cruel hell-bound world ought to do tonight's repent of their sins that's what these church members ought to do repent of their unbelief stand up for him he's the same yesterday today and forever and he identifies himself just like he did then and the people today take the same attitude that pharisee took same kind of an attitude let him set after inviting him yet they don't want him they just do it like for manners he knows it we done to him today just like they did then instead of washing him washing his the reproach away instead of trying to stand up saying you're mistaken it's the word of god made manifest it's what he promised he said he poured out the spirit in the last days we're living in the last days instead of that we just kind of set back like they did we're afraid to take a stand why the i'm gonna raise up and say that's jesus of nazareth i believe he's a prophet of god you know the reason they didn't do it because they didn't believe he was a prophet and they still don't today they think he's an educator they think he's a denomination they don't know he's still a prophet that's what they're heading down there for in question that's the same thing as in question about today nobody's ready to take up for him they just say well you got nothing to do with him hey i belong to church there's my pastors all of them sitting around here i'm a good person and jesus with dirty feet nobody cared the very bible now we walk up and shake hands put our name on the book the methodists and they don't want us we'll take us towards the baptist and they kick this out we go to nazarenes the one that's kicked us out we go with tunis and the two of us kick us out we go to threeinus we don't have to put up with none of it all starchy yeah that's it's the same way and when jesus comes amen we don't even recognize we don't care that's right that's the way they do and yet we're crying come lord jesus come lord jesus and he comes and what do we do same thing they did why if they say anything except it somebody else will hear make fun of them and they let him set dirty it's called an evil spirit you remember jesus told him one day when they said this man does this by beelzebub he said you say that against me to be forgiven but someday the holy ghost will come to do the same thing and one word against it will never be forgiven there we are jesus with dirty feet could you imagine it could you imagine people who claim to love god and it got so mixed up in their creeds and their denominations and isms jesus said your traditions you've made the word of god of no effect there he was there and the word was in effect because it was made flesh and was proven exactly that he was the christ and the people with their traditions wouldn't let it be effective upon the other people that's what he was doing trying to show it off if see they didn't believe he was a prophet and yet the bible said he would be a prophet the bible moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet romans 18 15. and the bible predicted just exactly what he would do and here he come doing it among those people and today we leave him with just his dirty name as he had then let him say things against it in the days of miracles his pastors though such a thing when the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and we're still ashamed to stand out and say something about it we're ashamed of our testimony that we we claim we believe instead of washing him trying to wash him with tears of joy that he's here we just let him sit dirty i won't have not do it i ain't cooperating nothing like that put my hand on it there you are it's the same bunch of pharisees just under another name we again let him set like that for the same reason we don't believe he's a prophet we're ashamed of it why the same reason we don't believe it the people don't know sir he can come and do whatever he wishes to they're setting their ways and there's nobody to try to fool with him and you know the bible said they'd be that way exactly the bible said they'd be that way lukewarm form of godliness to have no power thereof i think that's right we join up with this educational polished up group standing there and having our big socials and times our fine churches and find decorations then jesus christ can come in and you let him stay dirty the word can be made manifest among us and we still walk around let people talk about it oh my god but you know to hurry with our story let's change the scene tonight let's turn our cameras another way way down in the alley a little old dirty alley way up in the top of a little old room that was barbara the bar the door comes open and a woman steps out well she wasn't very well liked among the people she was a center and she made her living in the wrong way so she strolls out down the little creaking steps she gets into the alley and she goes down all along the garbage cans and goes out on the street well there's nobody out there so she begins to wonder what some oh i remember pharisee up there pastor pharisee he's uh given a big banquet everybody's up there business will be bad today so she mows us down the street and as she begins to walk and say well i'll just have to wait till that's over and she made her living in a bad way so she was walking down the street and after a while her little hungry stomach smell that roasted lamb my heart smells good never had anything like i had to eat in my life maybe been turned out on the street by some parents you know a lot of times we think about juvenile delinquency i think a whole lot of it is parent delinquency the kids have been taught to pray and serve god instead of mama out somewhere at a card party and her religious card party and dad out of the golf course somewhere and sister out with junior out there on the street running around maybe things have been different had the old-fashioned prayer altar the bible instead of a deck of cards and throwed that television out the door a long time ago and it might have been a whole lot different y'all used to be wrong go to pictures show the devil put it right over on her she brought it right in her house she's hungry she smelled man she said my smells good i wonder really how a piece of roasted lamb would really taste in a human's mouth i don't know how it would be i believe i'll just walk up now she couldn't get too close to him because she was a woman they were self-righteous you see they all belong to church so they couldn't get around where is that she was considered a sinner so if she walked up close and if you can look around see no of them standing there no water running out of their mouth is a gasp you know looking at this ram or lamb in there roasting and all the fine foods and things being packed around in there what a great time and she began to look through the crowd like that and her eyes fell upon me who's that he's got dirty feet i wonder who's that what if somebody would tell me say will you turns away real quick won't nothing do with her she's a sinner so ask somebody else finally maybe a little lady that was believing and looking the same way said uh madam pardon me but would you who is that sitting there how did that person well he said you know who that is did you hear him talk about that jesus of nazareth is supposed to be a prophet oh yes is that him that's him well he isn't washed i understood that everybody is forced to be washed before they come in there and anointed look at him well it's not right she had an opportunity presented to her she remembered a story that someone told her another woman of her trade one time [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
