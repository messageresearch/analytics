========================================

um we we are not going to go through everything we did um so a lot of the things will be new sorry a lot of the things will be old and um but i see new things coming in here and there so let's keep trusting the lord and see what goes on here so today um i want us to look at a few things so reading from matthew 4 four but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god praise be to god now naturally the food you eat determines how much water you drink the food you eat will determine how much water you drink there are some foods when you drink you eat probably for the whole day you will not even you don't feel tasty let alone drinking so there must be something in your belly to trigger that taste so you can drink praise be to the lord so what you feed on what you feed on talking about spiritual things now will determine how much prayer you give yourself to the things you feed on spiritually will determine how much prayer you give yourself to there are things you will eat and for the whole day you don't feel thirsty there is a life you will give yourself to and prayer wouldn't mean anything to you and you can say oh okay i don't even eat if you don't eat you can only drink for so long it will get to the point you will see the water but you never feel like drinking it why because there is nothing in your system calling for the water but if you have god inside there if you give yourself to the word the word as we have said time and again the word and prayer goes hand in hand the word of god in you would call for that prayer but if you choose to live a sinful life guess what prayer wouldn't even mean anything to you man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the living word living in you craves for prayer there is every reason why we should live in the word of god living by the world lives you above your edge praise be to god just envision yourself climbing the stairs that's what happens with every step you take in the world the more you live in the world the father above you rise above your flesh and where else should we be because the bible says that we should pray in the spirit always always praying in the spirit so if the word of god living in the word would lift you above your earth get you out of the flesh and get you into the spiritual realm into the inner courts of god where you can commune with god then it tells you that there is every good reason why we should live in the world anytime you have been confronted maybe struggling in the flesh or the disease of the flesh it's an indication that you have no reason above yourself if you find yourself struggling with yourself struggling with the things of this life is an indication that you have no reason above that flesh above your earth praise be to god as you live in the word obstacles things that are meant to be obstacles things that the devil would throw at you would end up becoming a springboard when the temptations come the temptations are meant to do evil to you to ruin your testimony but you know what the temptations come and they end up becoming one a springboard for you because you are living above it praise be to god now we've been talking about prayer talking about prayer remember we are doing a revision of a thought so we've been talking about prayer prayer prayer but there is something i want us to look at today apart from prayer where you go to god in communion with a request or a supplication there comes a moment in your life where you have to speak so we are not talking about prayer again here apart from prayer where you go to god to talk to god in prayer lay your request before god pour out your heart before god make your supplications before god or to just lift his holy name up to just praise him apart from that there comes a time when you just have to speak the bible says in job 22 8 you can just note that down that we shall decree a thing and it shall come to pass and i try to find out what the white decree means even though i've heard it a thousand and one times so a decree is an order from an authoritative source a person of authority speaking either a politician either a king what have you a person in authority when they speak they give an order it is a decree and you all have to obey it and the bible says that we shall decree 18 and it shall be established now when you go to the book of revelations it says that we have been made kings and priests unto god it doesn't matter how feeble you are or how feeble you think it doesn't matter how weak you think you are in the spiritual realm we are authorities in the spiritual realm you are an authority if we shall decree a thing it shall come to pass then no ordinary people just decree something if you say something outside nobody even knows you but let the governor decree something and everybody knows that no it's coming from a person in authority that is how we are children of god that is how we are in the spiritual realm even though nobody hears us when we speak out there and nobody would ever even hear us or may never even know us but in the spirit when we give others our others are being obeyed for we are made kings and priests unto god we are kings we are priests and you cannot be a king without a dominion we have a dominion just as an early king would give an order and his order would be obeyed that is how when we also give an order in the spirit that is how our others have been obeyed you know i didn't think of it just as i was driving uh with the family to check this morning and then it just struck me and i said oh if i thought about it earlier i could have done a better job at it but it just hit me and i said you know what i'll just go i'm just going to fit it in anyhow this brings us to where brother one has been talking about the authority of the church the binding power that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven the binding power we are authorities when we speak just know that you have made a decree praise be to god moses when he led the children of israel out of egypt and they got before the red sea and the enemy was coming after them when he turned and looked at them he made a decree and remember a decree can also be a judgment he looked at them and he said these egyptians you have seen you would never see them again the judgment was passed and it was established it was established there comes to that time where you don't have enough time to pray in the midst of the storm just imagine the devil holding a two i mean somebody holding you with a knife in your truth you think you can tell him just hold on let me go and pray and come back so you can take off my head no that is the time to speak that is the time to speak and when god was waiting on moses to speak moses was also waiting on god and god asked him moses what is in your hand what do you have say the road talk to the sea moses stretched it on the red sea and away a highway was made in the red sea that the children of israel crossed and pharaoh and his troops in an attempt to cross all of them god drowned not a single one of them escaped those egyptians the israelites saw they never saw them again moses made a decree and it came to pass praise be to god so remember there is that time there is time for prayer and we should give ourselves to prayer every single day of our lives there is no reason why a christian should go through the day from morning till evening and not pray it should never happen if it has happened before that is okay let it go but from today onwards just tell yourself that enough is enough give yourself to prayer but as we have said time and again it comes to that time where you realize that no there is no room there is just not enough time to go and pray and you have to speak and the bible does not play with words a man can play with words i can play with words god does not play with words he says exactly what it what he means and he means exactly what he says we shall decree a thing and it shall be established praise be to god that is a promise praise be to god joshua joshua was one of the 2 million who left egypt and he saw it when moses passed judgment on the egyptians and then he was he just today didn't know what what next to do until god spoke to him and asked him to stretch his throat on the rose on the red sea joshua saw it and when god took joshua after the death of moses and he said as i walked with moses so shall i be with you joshua knew where he stood praise be to god that when the opportunity came his way and they were fighting the enemy and joshua needed time to finish the work he looked at the sun he didn't hesitate he spoke to the sun just stay where you are praise be to god hey turn and look at the moon don't move stay where you are until i finish with my work and they obeyed it comes to that time where you just have to speak for it is not time to pray because there is just no time just speak speak you know god does not move by fear we have allowed fear to torment us so much to hold us to the ground so much no shake yourselves off sometimes you tell yourself oh what if i speak and it doesn't happen that is what fear can do what if you speak and it happens it's better to try and feel than to fail to try take god at his word it is not for us to bring the word of god to pass no is god's duty to bring his way to pass and he made that promise you shall decree a thing and shall be established take him by his word and speak believing praise be to god we are narrowing it down mikaya when the king of israel wanted to go to war against rama gilead and he gathered his prophets together about 400 of them and he asked them to prophesy they told him oh go god has given you victory go god has given you victory they were just prophesying oh you walk over the enemy you do this you do this yahushua was not satisfied he asked ahab are this all the prophets is there no any other one he said there is one he doesn't speak good of me he said don't worry about that let's bring him in and they brought they brought micaiah oh praise be to god he said as long as the lord lives whatever he lays on my heart that is what i'm going to tell you hey i told you right you see already you see what he has started already praise be to god as long as the lord lives whatever he tells me to do that's what i'm going to do now when he prophesied contrary to what the 400 prophets had prophesied the king of israel was not happy with him and he said you know what take this guy here put him in prison feed him with the bread of affliction till i come back and i'll decide what to do with him and i love what mikhail said praise be to god it comes to that time when you just have to speak he said look if you go and you come back in peace the lord has not spoken by me praise be to god if you go and you come back in peace the lord has not spoken by me and indeed he went he never came back speak just speak it was not time for makaya to start wailing and crying knowing how wicked the king was and then stop fasting and praying he just spoke you would go but you not come back in peace and it was established it was established nothing could change it we can talk about elijah i'm not going to go into the details because we all know the story when he got fed up with the prophets of baal he shut the heavens by his word but he just shut the heavens that that is not going to be rain and they will not be due until i called for it he didn't pray he just spoke and it was established nothing could change it so much so that until god wanted to even when god wanted to send our reign did you realize that god didn't overlook the words of his prophet he didn't just send the reign no he so came to his prophet he said you go go tell the king there's going to be rain he didn't trample over the west of his prophet he didn't undermine his prophet he spoke there would not be rain they will not be due until i called for it he just spoke and it was established you may say oh we are talking about bible characters we are talking about bible characters god has been doing it the fact that you don't see it or you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not happening i have shared this story here before about a little girl in accra um right andrew should know that place in temer who was in the house by herself the parents had gone to work and a man just opened the door she thought it was probably her father or a mother coming in and before she realized it was and a complete stranger and then he locked the door behind ready to take advantage of the little girl and right there and then tell me in a situation like this how are you going to pray oh just wait and let me pray and then whatever you want to do to me no she looked at the man in the eyes i strike you with blindness in jesus name and right there and then the man went blind right there and then the man went blind and then he's 10 he was looking for his way out and those guys that were telling me the story they were doing their national service when they came to the northern part of ghana and they said the girl later was saying that she was sorry i said sorry for what this is a situation you can never be sorry for she struck him with blindness we are children of god we are made kings and priests unto god and you can never be a king without a dominion and just as when a king speaks his voice is head across his area of jurisdiction that is the same way when you speak as a child of god your orders are ahead whatever decree that it is that you make it is head in the kingdom that you control remember you are controlling the kingdom praise be to god this is a story again i shared i'm just going to chip it in before our time is over about a doctor he wasn't even a believer a doctor who did a heart operation and one um i don't know anything about medicine but according to the story um i heard this on the radio um that when when the heart is being operated upon all the doctor would do is tap the heart and the heart will begin to pump so the doctor had a friend who was a pastor who was interested so he invited this pastor over and they all entered into the operation room and then the doctor did his oppression operated on the heart and when he got through it he tapped the heart thinking the heart was going to pump the heart was not pumping he tapped it again it was not pumping he looked into the ice of the pasta the pasta looked his eyes he said well this has never happened before this is happening for the first time and then according to the story this man who had come to the end of his book knowledge he had come to the end of his book knowledge he did everything he had to do there was no response remember this is not a christian we are talking about but he never gave up he never gave up he went very close to the dead man's ears the man was literally dead he went to his ears and he spoke into his ears he said tell your heart to beat again praise be to god and right there and then his heart started pumping started pumping and the man came back to life what are you talking about that apart from prayer that comes to that time in your work with god when you are faced with situations you just have to speak stay your grounds stay your grounds it is not time to back off stay your grounds just speak and go forward and remember that we shall decree a thing proverbs 22 28 we shall decree a thing and it shall come to pass when you speak believe praise be to god okay so our time is over we are going to go to the lord in prayer but let me just use a minute of your time you know um over the past few weeks um you know every church service has sections the meditational part of the service is very very important that is why the prophet of god said we should come in at least 30 minutes to time 30 minutes ahead of time it is not to sit and take sensors or count people as they come in or go out there is the time to just sit and commit yourself into the hands of god just prepare your heart try to get in line confess your sins your iniquities your weaknesses your faults not just for yourself but for your brothers for your sisters you are praying for the pastor you are praying just trusting god that is how very how much how very important this meditational part of the service is is very very important but we as a church have used part of it for the sunday school so you still have 15 minutes of that time that after sunday school you can still go to god and then seek the face of god prepare your heart prepare commit the service to this into his hands commit the song 72 cents just trust god the more you put in the service the more you get out it's just like an investment if i if you and i buy shares and i buy 10 10 shares from a company and you buy a thousand shares we're never going to get the same dividend you'll get more than i do it's just simple math right good but um what we see is that normally after the sunday school um you are free to walk out there take i mean drink water use the restroom come back but it is not okay to just go out there you know just while away time stand and converse um that doesn't look very good so uh it will be a very good thing after sunday school based on what you hear just talk to god you know for the next part of the service praise be to god god bless you or shall we pray our lord and our savior jesus we thank you so very much for how far time has brought us oh god we are so very much grateful for your grace your love and your mercies father oh god and the words we have had all god father we pray dear lord jesus that you give us faith faith that does not move faith that does not shake faith that takes you by your word faith that believes in the word faith that your lord jesus would not give up and we stay his grounds the father we shall bring glory and honor and praise unto your holy name oh god and would never allow the enemy to take advantage of us keep us by your mighty right hand and hide us securely under the shadow of thy mighty wings let your peace and your love and your mercies father abide with us never to depart this our father we ask in jesus name our lord and savior and we thank you sincerely oh god that you have had in positives amen god bless you sons [Music]
