[1:15:37] your hand to the lord
[1:15:39] take your knee right there before you
[1:15:41] got my hand up here with you as well
[1:15:45] heavenly father what a privilege lord it
[1:15:47] is to come before your
[1:15:48] presence lord as we have already enjoyed
[1:15:52] the august presence of the holy spirit
[1:15:56] it is a benefit to us as your children
[1:15:58] to be
[1:15:59] connected by the holy ghost into this
[1:16:02] heavenly place
[1:16:03] and lord as we are entering into the
[1:16:05] very sacred courts of the almighty
[1:16:08] we come with thanksgiving and praise we
[1:16:10] come with our token before us and we
[1:16:12] come lord
[1:16:12] boldly before thy throne as sons and
[1:16:14] daughters
[1:16:16] lord jesus we're asking that the holy
[1:16:18] spirit will come tonight and take his
[1:16:20] word lord you see every need that is
[1:16:22] represented amongst this body
[1:16:24] whether to be sicknesses or depressions
[1:16:27] or
[1:16:27] some situation in their finances or
[1:16:29] emotions or marriage or life or whatever
[1:16:31] circumstances may have befallen them
[1:16:34] lord thou
[1:16:35] alone has the answer for the need even
[1:16:38] tonight if it's just for the edification
[1:16:39] the perfecting of the saints we're
[1:16:41] praying that you will come
[1:16:42] by thy word and speak to us o god our
[1:16:45] father by the things that we'll read and
[1:16:48] study and understand tonight
[1:16:49] i pray that you'll anoint me lord that i
[1:16:51] might get myself completely out of the
[1:16:52] way
[1:16:53] that you might use me as a vessel that i
[1:16:55] could be used as a vessel of honor for
[1:16:57] thy glory
[1:16:58] and that i might be a benefit to the
[1:17:00] people of god and lord as we open up
[1:17:01] these
[1:17:02] weekend of services lord with this first
[1:17:05] night of great worship we already
[1:17:07] feel a powerful presence in this place
[1:17:10] lord we know the saints of god have
[1:17:11] prepared themselves they're ready
[1:17:13] lord i'm it ready tonight the word is
[1:17:16] that ready and the holy spirit is that
[1:17:17] ready
[1:17:18] and the angels of the lord aren't ready
[1:17:20] tonight at their post of duty
[1:17:22] and as we look into this great subject
[1:17:24] lord i pray that the holy spirit will
[1:17:26] let us
[1:17:26] draw near to that realm as it draws near
[1:17:29] to us granted lord as we commit it to
[1:17:31] you
[1:17:31] in the name of jesus christ both speaker
[1:17:33] and listener
[1:17:34] in jesus name amen and amen
[1:17:38] all the saints said amen you may be
[1:17:41] seated may the lord bless you real good
[1:17:44] i sure appreciate the lord tonight
[1:17:47] i appreciate all the great things that
[1:17:49] the lord has done for us
[1:17:51] and being a christian is a wonderful
[1:17:53] privilege it's something that we
[1:17:56] truly believe is called and ordained of
[1:17:59] the lord and we don't certainly don't
[1:18:01] serve god just because we decide to
[1:18:04] we don't serve god because we desire to
[1:18:06] be a better person or just more
[1:18:08] moral or deeper in our ethics but we
[1:18:11] serve the lord because he chose us
[1:18:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:18:15] and one thing is evidently clear and
[1:18:17] perfectly clear
[1:18:18] as the children of god is that you
[1:18:20] couldn't have chose yourself
[1:18:22] and there is no choosing for you in any
[1:18:24] way whatsoever as a matter of fact
[1:18:26] whenever you do your choosing you would
[1:18:28] have chosen the wrong thing
[1:18:29] but because the lord is a motivator and
[1:18:32] because the lord is a leader
[1:18:33] and because the lord is a person of
[1:18:36] inspiration
[1:18:37] it is true that we may have to make our
[1:18:39] choice but he prodded us along until we
[1:18:41] got to the right places
[1:18:43] to make the right choices and you see
[1:18:46] his whole economy is based upon
[1:18:48] his desire the thing that he wanted in
[1:18:51] the very beginning before the foundation
[1:18:53] of the world
[1:18:54] and if you could say in a way that god's
[1:18:56] a little bit
[1:18:57] self-centered in respect that he wants
[1:18:59] it his way
[1:19:00] and if you're the creator and uh you
[1:19:03] just say for example you know you're
[1:19:05] like when we were kids we would have
[1:19:06] games that we would play you know if you
[1:19:08] was the maker of the rules
[1:19:09] you were the one that called the rules
[1:19:11] of the game amen and since he's the
[1:19:13] creator he can be self-centered if he
[1:19:15] chose
[1:19:16] if he chooses to be and he can make the
[1:19:18] rules and we got to play his program and
[1:19:20] not the other way around
[1:19:21] so we know that the lord is not a
[1:19:23] selfish person but he wants what he
[1:19:25] wants
[1:19:25] and he created everything for it to be
[1:19:28] in his program and in his line
[1:19:30] of being children of god and all of this
[1:19:33] coming together as it has
[1:19:34] here we are 6 000 years later after the
[1:19:36] creation of man
[1:19:38] and god is still bringing together his
[1:19:40] entire purpose his entire plan
[1:19:42] and everything he desired from the
[1:19:44] foundation of the world
[1:19:46] and it's just my job to fall in line
[1:19:49] with what he wants and so while we pray
[1:19:53] father
[1:19:53] thy will be done not my own be done
[1:19:56] because if i'm just clay and i'm just
[1:19:58] here
[1:19:59] as a product of his own will and his own
[1:20:01] mind and his own creation
[1:20:02] i have no thought coming about my next
[1:20:05] steps
[1:20:06] the next five minutes the next breath i
[1:20:08] take in him i move
[1:20:10] and live and have my being and i walk in
[1:20:13] him
[1:20:14] talk in him act in him function in him
[1:20:17] he is the reason that i am what i am
[1:20:19] today
[1:20:20] so i'm thankful that the lord is in
[1:20:22] control of all things aren't you
[1:20:24] and being that god has a whole plan laid
[1:20:26] out a whole program laid out
[1:20:28] we understand that the program of god
[1:20:30] began
[1:20:31] with the creation of these angels and
[1:20:34] even the apostle paul who we believe the
[1:20:36] writer of the book of hebrews was
[1:20:38] of course the uh most people in scholars
[1:20:41] and things would say that
[1:20:42] oh somebody else wrote the book but when
[1:20:44] we read hebrews brother branham said
[1:20:46] it was as close to all of the other
[1:20:48] writings of paul
[1:20:49] as we could get and when you look at
[1:20:51] this particular portion of scripture
[1:20:53] here
[1:20:53] you'll notice that he's not referring
[1:20:55] when it says the begotten
[1:20:57] the first begotten into the world is not
[1:20:59] necessarily referring
[1:21:00] to just simply the lord jesus but
[1:21:02] remember brother branham tells us in
[1:21:04] questions answers on the genesis in 53
[1:21:06] he said that the first real begotten son
[1:21:10] of god
[1:21:11] was the logos or that pillar of fire
[1:21:13] that proceeded out of god
[1:21:15] so that was the first as we'd say son of
[1:21:18] god then we know from melchizedek
[1:21:19] brother branham said that
[1:21:21] he creates himself a body to live in
[1:21:24] and that body was a celestial body not a
[1:21:26] terrestrial body of course but theophany
[1:21:29] and then by becoming melchizedek he was
[1:21:32] forming himself
[1:21:33] towards flesh until eventually he became
[1:21:35] jesus christ
[1:21:37] but then we know that the creation of
[1:21:38] god did not begin
[1:21:40] on the earth either we know that sin did
[1:21:43] not begin
[1:21:44] on the earth we know that the first
[1:21:45] battle that took place amongst good and
[1:21:48] evil
[1:21:48] did not take place here but it took
[1:21:51] place in heaven
[1:21:52] where the stars of god were satan
[1:21:55] desired to ascend himself
[1:21:57] above the stars of god and brother brahm
[1:21:59] tells us in god of this evil age
[1:22:01] that satan actually preached to the
[1:22:04] angels
[1:22:04] that were in heaven he had a desire of
[1:22:07] his own and we know that from isaiah
[1:22:09] when he tells us that
[1:22:10] uh the five wills as he said i will this
[1:22:12] and i will that and i will the other and
[1:22:14] i'll be like god and
[1:22:15] i'll be like the most high and i'll have
[1:22:17] my own kingdom i'll have my own subjects
[1:22:19] and what more
[1:22:20] so satan had his own plan he had his own
[1:22:22] agenda and god
[1:22:24] created him in such a way that he could
[1:22:26] be
[1:22:27] just that because every angel has free
[1:22:30] moral agency
[1:22:31] they were created in a manner that they
[1:22:32] can choose to stay with the lord
[1:22:34] or they can step away from god but the
[1:22:36] difference between an angel of the lord
[1:22:38] and you and i
[1:22:39] is there is no redemption for an angel
[1:22:42] whatsoever
[1:22:43] once an angel of the lord steps away
[1:22:45] from the economy of god
[1:22:46] there is found no place more no more in
[1:22:49] heaven so we understand even
[1:22:50] from the book of jude that angels had
[1:22:53] real estate
[1:22:54] in heaven they had a position they had a
[1:22:56] place that god had given them
[1:22:58] they were created with a certain power
[1:23:00] with a certain
[1:23:01] influence with a certain ability and yet
[1:23:04] because they listened to the devil's
[1:23:06] lie all of that they were when they were
[1:23:08] kicked out of heaven all of that went
[1:23:10] with them
[1:23:11] when they became demons so let's say
[1:23:13] between 1 and 10 using numbers
[1:23:15] if an angel was created as a seven when
[1:23:17] he became a demon he's still a seven
[1:23:19] if he was created an eight or a nine or
[1:23:21] a ten or whatever he was
[1:23:22] he never lost one ounce of his power but
[1:23:25] he did lose his real estate
[1:23:27] lost his position in heaven now don't
[1:23:29] forget that the angels of the lord
[1:23:31] were the very first ones to bring in
[1:23:33] worship when we speak about the
[1:23:35] worshipping of jesus christ
[1:23:36] and the worshipping of the saints of god
[1:23:38] you realize we were not the first ones
[1:23:40] to say hallelujah and praise the lord
[1:23:42] and all those words
[1:23:44] that the angels of god were created that
[1:23:47] they would worship
[1:23:48] almighty god as a matter of fact i was
[1:23:50] not the first one
[1:23:52] that brought him into the position of
[1:23:54] being called
[1:23:55] god god as an object of worship
[1:23:58] never came into his position as god
[1:24:01] until
[1:24:02] these angels that were created spoken by
[1:24:05] their hallelujahs and praise the lord
[1:24:07] put him in that rightful place of course
[1:24:09] i could go back a little bit further
[1:24:11] right here but i'd mess up the rest of
[1:24:12] the sermon if i cheated
[1:24:14] amen and tell you that i really was the
[1:24:15] reason why the angels were there in the
[1:24:17] first place but
[1:24:18] let's just pretend i didn't say that
[1:24:19] okay now i want you to notice how
[1:24:22] that when paul begins to outline this in
[1:24:24] these two verses notice
[1:24:26] he said that when the first begotten
[1:24:28] came into the world
[1:24:29] that the angels of god began to worship
[1:24:32] him
[1:24:33] and then these angels of the lord were
[1:24:35] also created remembered to be
[1:24:37] ministering
[1:24:38] spirits sent from god to minister
[1:24:41] to who the saints of god to minister to
[1:24:44] the body
[1:24:44] of jesus christ which would come along
[1:24:46] many many years later we don't know
[1:24:47] exactly
[1:24:48] maybe how long it was before satan done
[1:24:50] what he done whether there was even time
[1:24:52] considered during that time period could
[1:24:54] have been millions and millions and
[1:24:56] millions of years for all we know
[1:24:57] but ever what the time period might have
[1:24:59] been god waited
[1:25:01] and waited and waited and waited until
[1:25:03] satan came to the place
[1:25:05] lucifer where he desired a kingdom
[1:25:07] greater than that
[1:25:08] of michael or the lord jesus christ or
[1:25:11] almighty god
[1:25:12] and then once he made that shift within
[1:25:14] himself
[1:25:15] let's remember when the prophet isaiah
[1:25:17] picks him up he's not catching what is
[1:25:19] what what lucifer was saying from his
[1:25:22] mouth go back and read it
[1:25:23] he said in his heart he was saying
[1:25:26] i will be this and i will be this
[1:25:29] brother
[1:25:30] the word of god is a discerner of the
[1:25:32] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:25:36] no doubt he hid that from every one of
[1:25:37] them angels he hid that from every one
[1:25:39] of that angelic community
[1:25:40] but here's this prophet all these
[1:25:42] hundreds of years later going right back
[1:25:44] up there into that angelic community
[1:25:46] and revealing what was hiding inside the
[1:25:48] devil's heart
[1:25:50] goes to prove when you see hypocrites in
[1:25:52] church they're not the original
[1:25:54] when you see people playing two-face in
[1:25:56] church they're not the original they got
[1:25:58] that from somebody
[1:26:00] amen the devil was the first one to come
[1:26:02] online as a christian but yet in his
[1:26:04] heart not living right
[1:26:06] come on praise the lord hey listen
[1:26:08] people don't have to be a
[1:26:10] ranked sinner doesn't mean you're out
[1:26:11] there laying in a gut or someone another
[1:26:12] with a beer bottle in your hand
[1:26:14] to be a ranked sinner does not mean that
[1:26:16] you're a drug addict
[1:26:17] whoa come on preach to me you know the
[1:26:19] most foul center on the face of the
[1:26:21] planet a pretender
[1:26:23] somebody that pretends to be a child of
[1:26:25] god and yet nothing in their heart to
[1:26:27] back it up
[1:26:28] somebody that pretends to love the lord
[1:26:30] but yet nothing stands out there
[1:26:32] as a reality amen that's the worst
[1:26:35] person you could ever
[1:26:36] deal with bible called it perilous times
[1:26:39] or
[1:26:39] dangerous times that men would be lovers
[1:26:42] of their own self and incontinent and
[1:26:43] fierce and
[1:26:44] all of that is wrapped up in the heart
[1:26:46] but yet all the veil on the outside
[1:26:48] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:26:50] the power thereof
[1:26:51] don't forget people that always put on
[1:26:53] sheep's clothing if they're not really
[1:26:55] sheep look for a zipper
[1:26:58] praise the lord somebody amen search for
[1:27:01] the zipper that's right
[1:27:02] now let's look for just a moment and
[1:27:04] angels can actually
[1:27:05] take on human forms and share human
[1:27:08] characteristics if you like to see that
[1:27:09] in the bible genesis chapter 19 verse 1
[1:27:12] and there came two angels to sodom at
[1:27:14] even and lot sat in the gate
[1:27:16] of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to
[1:27:19] meet them bowing himself
[1:27:20] to the ground in his face toward the
[1:27:22] ground now we know when lot
[1:27:24] meets these two angels that he doesn't
[1:27:26] have abraham's revelation
[1:27:28] uncle abraham saw three called them one
[1:27:30] he saw
[1:27:31] two column two amen
[1:27:34] and and the revelation of it is simply
[1:27:36] put that as a child of the living god
[1:27:39] abraham understood that it was almighty
[1:27:42] god
[1:27:42] wrapped in flesh amen he knew it
[1:27:47] i don't care what would have come along
[1:27:48] that had websites in that day trying to
[1:27:50] convince him different he knew it
[1:27:52] that's what i say about a bunch of this
[1:27:54] outfit out here that carries on about
[1:27:56] all the websites and all the defectors
[1:27:58] and
[1:27:58] all what they say against this message
[1:28:00] let me tell you something brother sister
[1:28:02] and let me speak to every young person
[1:28:03] and every old person every middle-aged
[1:28:05] person in this church
[1:28:06] and those that will hear my voice on
[1:28:08] this internet if you are convinced
[1:28:10] that you have met jesus christ there's
[1:28:13] not enough
[1:28:14] websites there's not enough preachers
[1:28:16] there's not enough hypocrites
[1:28:18] there's not enough devils out of hell to
[1:28:21] stop you from believing this last day
[1:28:23] truth
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:26] i don't care what their name is or how
[1:28:28] convincing they are nobody can run you
[1:28:30] off
[1:28:30] if you know what you know yes sir
[1:28:34] you forgive me this may sound a little
[1:28:36] racially inclined i don't mean it that
[1:28:38] way i'm a white man i know i am
[1:28:40] i don't care how many websites come
[1:28:41] along and tell me i ain't i look in the
[1:28:42] mirror and see different
[1:28:44] i've had the experience i know where my
[1:28:46] birth was i know who my parents were
[1:28:48] praise the lord come on amen i know
[1:28:51] exactly
[1:28:52] amen my origins the same thing from
[1:28:54] comes from this message
[1:28:55] amen when i look down at what brother
[1:28:56] branham says and they're saying all
[1:28:58] these different things about the prophet
[1:29:00] of god
[1:29:00] i understand that the revelation that
[1:29:03] come from this man right here
[1:29:04] lined up with every scripture in the
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] i bible you one thing the critics
[1:29:11] wouldn't want to stand before him if he
[1:29:12] was living today
[1:29:15] i promise you that now notice
[1:29:18] and paul you say well that was old
[1:29:19] testament sure brother brown talked
[1:29:21] about
[1:29:21] how that the picked up the dust of their
[1:29:23] one and said michael stepped in and
[1:29:25] gabriel stepped in they
[1:29:27] come down there and appeared to lot and
[1:29:28] lot said my lords
[1:29:31] he was a heathen so he believed more
[1:29:32] than one god that's what heathens
[1:29:34] believe
[1:29:36] christians don't believe in more than
[1:29:37] one god they believe in one god he is
[1:29:39] not a trinity and he is not a trinity
[1:29:43] praise the lord well i know you live in
[1:29:45] the twin cities but god ain't twin
[1:29:48] amen that's exactly right now i want you
[1:29:50] to notice that in hebrews chapter 13
[1:29:52] verse 2
[1:29:53] paul picks up this very same concept and
[1:29:56] brings it over into the new testament
[1:29:58] oh you say that was old testament yes
[1:30:01] but watch what he said
[1:30:02] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[1:30:08] oh praise the lord for thereby
[1:30:11] some have entertained angels unaware
[1:30:15] that doesn't mean they're going around
[1:30:17] looking for them i guarantee you one
[1:30:18] thing we walked outside this church
[1:30:19] tonight
[1:30:20] saw a big ufo make a big spin and go i
[1:30:22] mean it'd be on facebook twitter twitch
[1:30:24] you name them
[1:30:26] you'd be twitching all right it would be
[1:30:28] everywhere oh i saw a ufo
[1:30:30] unidentified flying object did you ever
[1:30:32] stop to think that some of them visitors
[1:30:34] that come into the church
[1:30:36] them unidentified flying visitors
[1:30:40] it might have been the holy spirit
[1:30:42] checking your attitude
[1:30:43] to see how you treat visitors see how
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:47] treat those that aren't exactly like you
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:51] you know them non-message people that we
[1:30:53] look down on so much
[1:30:55] well they don't believe the message at
[1:30:57] one time i could have said that about
[1:30:58] you and me
[1:31:00] sure even though i was raised in it i
[1:31:02] didn't believe it not to the holy spirit
[1:31:04] revealed to me
[1:31:05] riveted to him i didn't you didn't
[1:31:07] either don't look at me that way
[1:31:09] but the holy spirit could appear to you
[1:31:11] and i we've all heard the stories
[1:31:12] about how somebody'd be out maybe they'd
[1:31:14] be out of gas in the middle of nowhere
[1:31:16] all of a sudden here comes a man with a
[1:31:17] gas tank what is that
[1:31:19] angels unawares not looking for it not
[1:31:22] searching for it not trying to get
[1:31:24] cameras and little
[1:31:25] white balls dancing around and balls of
[1:31:27] light and things like that
[1:31:29] no unawares their attitude is such
[1:31:32] that an angel of the lord could appear
[1:31:34] to them and they're living their
[1:31:36] everyday normal christian life and an
[1:31:38] angel could feel comfortable
[1:31:40] being entertained by them praise god and
[1:31:43] hallelujah
[1:31:44] realize this is the reason why brother
[1:31:46] venom said that if we live the kind of
[1:31:48] lives that we
[1:31:49] should we'd be visited by angels more
[1:31:51] often
[1:31:54] praise the lord but you can't you listen
[1:31:57] they're from heaven
[1:31:58] they cannot be in a heavenly atmosphere
[1:32:00] then come down to hell
[1:32:02] amen people fussing and fighting and
[1:32:04] arguing and carrying on throwing things
[1:32:07] come on message church oh i know some of
[1:32:10] you
[1:32:10] some of you tonight you think you're
[1:32:12] those holy angels i'm preaching about
[1:32:14] you're not you're just as sinful as me
[1:32:17] you get aggravated just like me
[1:32:20] words amen in case you forgot amen
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:28] that's right that's right but they have
[1:32:30] to have an
[1:32:31] atmosphere a certain atmosphere to come
[1:32:33] into it
[1:32:35] praise the lord watch here again in
[1:32:37] psalm chapter 8 verse 5
[1:32:39] speaking about the lord jesus for thou
[1:32:41] hast made him a little lower than the
[1:32:43] angels
[1:32:44] and has crowned him with glory and honor
[1:32:47] now i want you to notice
[1:32:49] the way that the arrangements of this
[1:32:50] was now notice that
[1:32:52] jesus then did not come into the imagery
[1:32:56] of an angel meaning that there was
[1:32:59] something about him
[1:33:00] that was different now remember the
[1:33:03] angels of the lord had never smoked
[1:33:05] never cursed never drank never committed
[1:33:07] adultery
[1:33:08] never done any kind of sinful act they
[1:33:10] were completely holy in body
[1:33:12] action behavior and everything perfect
[1:33:16] but an angel cannot propagate its race
[1:33:20] an angel has no tree of knowledge of
[1:33:22] good and evil
[1:33:24] to get married and produce kids
[1:33:27] so what was it about jesus that was
[1:33:29] different
[1:33:30] he was created after the tree of
[1:33:32] knowledge of good and evil
[1:33:34] and in the likeness of sinful flesh even
[1:33:37] though he
[1:33:37] himself was no part of the tree of
[1:33:40] knowledge of good and evil
[1:33:42] he was made in the same fashion as that
[1:33:46] oh you say well what was the purpose of
[1:33:47] it oh i i hope you're ready for this
[1:33:51] now watch when you receive the baptism
[1:33:53] of the holy ghost in your soul you
[1:33:55] are perfect
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:33:59] you're no longer a sinner we sing them
[1:34:02] songs and we mean the best when we sing
[1:34:04] them i'm an old sinner saved by grace
[1:34:05] when i get born again i am no longer a
[1:34:07] sinner
[1:34:11] come on preach to me when i receive the
[1:34:14] holy ghost
[1:34:15] i am no longer a sinner
[1:34:19] my life has been changed completely i'm
[1:34:22] a saint
[1:34:23] full of the holy ghost born again i am
[1:34:26] just as sinless if i've got the holy
[1:34:28] ghost
[1:34:28] as jesus was sinless
[1:34:32] what is about me that's different then
[1:34:34] what is it about me that's not so
[1:34:36] sinless
[1:34:40] that anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:34:44] your flesh you versus you
[1:34:49] that's the great fight of the day you
[1:34:51] versus you
[1:34:53] oh you thank you and you you oh i tell
[1:34:55] i'm i believe the message
[1:34:56] uh-huh what part of you believes the
[1:34:58] message
[1:35:01] as i guarantee if it wasn't for the
[1:35:03] flesh that you pack around you
[1:35:04] your soul might say amen to every word
[1:35:06] of god but don't you dare try to pull it
[1:35:08] over on me
[1:35:09] that your flesh believes at all it don't
[1:35:14] oh you say well that flesh is me you
[1:35:17] need a better revelation of who you are
[1:35:20] this is just the body that packs you
[1:35:22] around
[1:35:25] praise the lord this is only the veil
[1:35:29] that packs the real me around
[1:35:34] i am not the sum of my genetic
[1:35:38] creation
[1:35:41] even the bible talked about 6 000 years
[1:35:45] of sin from the fathers all the way down
[1:35:47] into me can you imagine
[1:35:49] all of that sin all of that wrong all of
[1:35:52] those
[1:35:52] races and cultures back there in my
[1:35:55] history that we're displeasing to the
[1:35:57] lord and
[1:35:57] all of that mess is poured down right in
[1:35:59] here
[1:36:01] brother you talk about the reason this
[1:36:02] bride's going to be an overcomer in the
[1:36:04] last day
[1:36:06] it's because she's not just going to
[1:36:07] overcome just this generation
[1:36:10] but she's going to overcome every
[1:36:12] generational curse
[1:36:14] that followed her all the way down from
[1:36:16] the beginning of time
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:22] i don't have to just overcome my temper
[1:36:25] i don't just have to overcome my
[1:36:26] impatience i've got to overcome my great
[1:36:29] great great great great great great
[1:36:31] great great great great great great
[1:36:33] great great great great great great
[1:36:38] i got to go plumb back to adam and eve
[1:36:40] and the serpent
[1:36:42] and i've got to overcome all that too no
[1:36:45] wonder we need the holy ghost
[1:36:48] come on somebody i said no wonder we
[1:36:50] need the holy ghost
[1:36:52] you think you're going to do that on
[1:36:53] your own esteem
[1:36:55] i'll study the method i'll get smart
[1:36:57] enough
[1:36:59] let me just explain something to you
[1:37:00] about warfare this little fellow that
[1:37:02] we're talking about the devil
[1:37:04] he is the one that inspired napoleon
[1:37:07] he is the one that inspired hitler
[1:37:09] hitler mussolini
[1:37:11] stalin eichmann anybody ever heard of a
[1:37:13] little fellow that conquered the whole
[1:37:15] world in his time
[1:37:17] huh you ever heard of the great warriors
[1:37:19] and the conquerors of time anybody ever
[1:37:20] heard of the pharaoh
[1:37:22] where to get his inspiration from to
[1:37:23] rule the world
[1:37:25] and you think with your little canary
[1:37:26] brain that you're smart enough cause you
[1:37:29] got a computer an ipad and you can pull
[1:37:30] up a bunch of quotes
[1:37:31] that you're gonna whip him
[1:37:36] you better have the holy ghost you
[1:37:39] better be born again because you are no
[1:37:41] match
[1:37:42] for the smartness of satan
[1:37:45] he's been at this a whole lot longer
[1:37:47] than your eye
[1:37:49] you've heard the expression can beat you
[1:37:50] with one arm tied behind his back
[1:37:54] that's the kind of cro the kind of
[1:37:55] creature kind of foe you're talking
[1:37:56] about
[1:37:57] you think you know the word of god you
[1:38:00] might have read it
[1:38:01] he was standing there when it was spoken
[1:38:04] you can go back into history and you
[1:38:06] could pull up where adam said this and
[1:38:07] where that one said that
[1:38:09] who was it standing in the garden of
[1:38:10] eden when he said that seed will bruise
[1:38:12] his head and you'll bruise his heel
[1:38:15] he wasn't reading that he was hearing it
[1:38:17] out of the mouth of god
[1:38:18] first hand
[1:38:21] and yet we think somehow another because
[1:38:23] we belong to a message church
[1:38:26] come on young people you better listen
[1:38:27] to brother ben all you think because i
[1:38:30] was born on that message pew
[1:38:31] i was too we ain't no match
[1:38:34] we ain't no match we need the holy ghost
[1:38:37] because listen to me this is a powerful
[1:38:39] angel
[1:38:40] this is a powerful demon this being was
[1:38:43] created
[1:38:44] to be everything that god was except for
[1:38:46] a creator
[1:38:49] not only is he strong but he's smart
[1:38:51] he's powerful
[1:38:52] and he's got the world by the tale you
[1:38:55] know all of this stuff you hate
[1:38:57] around the world today satan is loving
[1:38:59] it more
[1:39:00] every day because brother mama told us
[1:39:02] this is his eating out here around here
[1:39:06] it'd be no different for you and i if we
[1:39:08] was walking through the actual garden of
[1:39:10] eden
[1:39:10] and we'd see the great birds of paradise
[1:39:12] and we'd see all of the beauty of eden
[1:39:14] we said oh
[1:39:15] oh you know how it is when you own them
[1:39:16] vacations and you're in them tropical
[1:39:18] places and
[1:39:19] oh just how beautiful it is that's the
[1:39:21] way the devil feels every time a baby is
[1:39:23] aborted
[1:39:24] every time a church brings more
[1:39:26] deception on and brings more people in
[1:39:28] to church membership rather than a new
[1:39:30] birth experience
[1:39:32] that's how the devil feels every time
[1:39:34] there's more rioting and there's more
[1:39:36] hating and there's more
[1:39:37] killing he looks at that the same as you
[1:39:39] and i would look at a garden oasis
[1:39:43] he loves it because everything he sees
[1:39:47] around him he knows i
[1:39:48] am in control
[1:39:52] don't think for a second he ain't that's
[1:39:55] the reason why when you see people in
[1:39:57] the church become isolated
[1:40:00] all of a sudden they go from being on
[1:40:02] the front row as we would say
[1:40:04] on fire as we would say and in a
[1:40:06] moment's time
[1:40:07] sometimes a few months time just like
[1:40:10] that they're gone
[1:40:12] don't you understand the plan that he
[1:40:14] laid for them
[1:40:16] was a whole lot more deeper and intense
[1:40:18] and more serious
[1:40:19] than the plan you had laid for yourself
[1:40:22] that's why brother we better throw
[1:40:23] ourselves on the mercy of the lord jesus
[1:40:26] and every day of our life we better wake
[1:40:27] up in the morning with our hands raised
[1:40:29] in there god i need you
[1:40:31] i need you god because at this very
[1:40:33] moment i don't know what demon is
[1:40:35] planning was
[1:40:36] i don't know what kind of conferences
[1:40:37] have been going on down in hell what
[1:40:39] kind of traps may be led for me down the
[1:40:41] road
[1:40:41] i need the holy ghost to give me the
[1:40:44] leadership i need to overcome
[1:40:48] amen this is why we overcome by the
[1:40:50] blood of the lamb
[1:40:51] it is our protective barrier that keeps
[1:40:53] us from the fro
[1:40:54] from satan ever getting inside because
[1:40:56] the only way he can get in is to become
[1:40:57] our brother
[1:40:59] right notice jesus then was created like
[1:41:02] you and i now listen to this
[1:41:03] don't get offended now but brother madam
[1:41:05] said he was tempted by sex
[1:41:07] tempted by drugs as we would say tempted
[1:41:10] by
[1:41:10] worldly things he was tempted in every
[1:41:13] way that a man or a woman could
[1:41:15] experience
[1:41:16] the bible talked about the three avenues
[1:41:18] that it was tempted by lust of the eyes
[1:41:20] lust of the flesh
[1:41:21] and the pride of life jesus experienced
[1:41:24] the sting
[1:41:25] of pride he experienced the sting of
[1:41:28] jealousy of hatred
[1:41:29] of emulation emulation strife wrath
[1:41:32] heresy
[1:41:33] all of those things that we read about
[1:41:34] in the bible jesus understood them
[1:41:36] well and because he was created remember
[1:41:42] joseph was not his father mary was not
[1:41:44] his mother
[1:41:46] not one cell of jesus christ had human
[1:41:48] blood in it
[1:41:50] if you would have tested the dna of the
[1:41:51] blood of the lord jesus you couldn't
[1:41:52] have found a match anywhere on the
[1:41:53] planet
[1:41:55] because the dna of the lord jesus christ
[1:41:57] would have had no father
[1:41:58] it would have had no matching mother
[1:42:01] because god was his father
[1:42:05] glory and god was his mother he was
[1:42:09] created he was virgin born
[1:42:14] if there would have even been one cell
[1:42:16] of natural creation in him it would not
[1:42:18] have been the son of god begotten
[1:42:20] by the creative hand of god absolutely
[1:42:23] was
[1:42:23] a virgin-born son of god
[1:42:27] made lower let me think to ourselves why
[1:42:30] does that help us
[1:42:31] him becoming flesh why does that mean
[1:42:34] anything to us
[1:42:36] because jesus knew that the process
[1:42:38] would be such
[1:42:39] we would come to the world in the
[1:42:41] physical later we would come to us he
[1:42:43] tells us who's this melchizedek
[1:42:45] later we would come to the knowledge of
[1:42:47] the spiritual but we come natural first
[1:42:50] then the spiritual would follow that
[1:42:52] natural then from that spiritual
[1:42:55] would bring a re-creation or a reforming
[1:42:57] or a renovation
[1:42:59] of the natural so what good would it do
[1:43:02] me to have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:04] in my soul
[1:43:05] sealed to the day of my redemption i
[1:43:08] could never go to hell
[1:43:09] i could never get old i could never age
[1:43:11] or die
[1:43:12] in this soul time does not exist
[1:43:16] in that realm
[1:43:20] so if you can take your finger and point
[1:43:22] it to the time you saw me do something
[1:43:24] wrong in my soul there is no time
[1:43:27] there's nothing to point to
[1:43:28] [Laughter]
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:32] glory to god there is nothing that you
[1:43:36] could put your finger on the day
[1:43:38] the time the hour the moment it does not
[1:43:41] exist in my soul
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:49] but in this i still carry the marks
[1:43:55] of the moment the day the time the hour
[1:43:58] i still carry it some of you brothers
[1:44:02] that might have been in the
[1:44:03] world and you got tattoos on your body
[1:44:04] the day you got the holy ghost some
[1:44:06] tattoo's still there
[1:44:09] some of you girls maybe got ear
[1:44:10] piercings or maybe running into the
[1:44:12] world or some kind of thing of course i
[1:44:13] don't i don't know i'm just saying as an
[1:44:14] example
[1:44:15] but when you've got the holy ghost the
[1:44:16] earpiece is still there
[1:44:18] them holes in your ears they're still
[1:44:19] there
[1:44:21] so what good does it do me to have the
[1:44:23] holy ghost of my soul
[1:44:24] and still identify with the tree of
[1:44:27] knowledge of good and evil
[1:44:30] i know you're probably thinking what in
[1:44:31] the world does this have to do with
[1:44:32] angels just hang on
[1:44:35] just hang on we almost there
[1:44:39] don't get impatient now settle down
[1:44:43] now watch then in matthew chapter 22
[1:44:46] verse 30 watch what jesus says about the
[1:44:48] believer
[1:44:49] for in the resurrection they neither
[1:44:51] marry
[1:44:52] nor are given or in marriage but are as
[1:44:56] the angels of god
[1:44:58] in heaven now that doesn't mean
[1:45:02] that all of a sudden i'm when i get my
[1:45:03] body changed i'm going to sprout wings
[1:45:05] and fly
[1:45:08] i'm not going to have twain over my face
[1:45:10] twain over my feet twain on my back
[1:45:14] so how in the world am i going to be
[1:45:15] like the angels in heaven
[1:45:17] well remember the angels in heaven never
[1:45:19] smoked never drank never cursed never
[1:45:21] lied
[1:45:21] never done nothing but been a worshiper
[1:45:23] of god
[1:45:25] when my body is changed
[1:45:30] all right now listen close when you were
[1:45:34] born off the tree of knowledge and good
[1:45:36] and evil
[1:45:37] in your very cells you carry the
[1:45:40] identity of sin before you
[1:45:42] let me give you an example out of
[1:45:44] science and and research now this is
[1:45:46] peer reviewed research
[1:45:47] this is authentic doctor research this
[1:45:49] is not something i got out of wikipedia
[1:45:52] but they proved when it took a a man and
[1:45:54] a woman
[1:45:55] who were high school sweethearts they
[1:45:58] wanted to run an
[1:45:58] experiment to see if they could carry
[1:46:01] the actual dna of the other person that
[1:46:04] them high school sweethearts had kissed
[1:46:06] when they were going to high school
[1:46:07] together and dating 40 years
[1:46:10] after their first kiss had been shared
[1:46:12] they swabbed her mouth swabbed his mouth
[1:46:15] and found each other's dna still in
[1:46:17] their mouth
[1:46:20] you understand this is why brother adam
[1:46:21] said your first kiss be at the altar
[1:46:27] what's about you old people you should
[1:46:29] have been hollering a man at least
[1:46:33] huh
[1:46:36] brother brahma had a little bit more
[1:46:38] common sense than what people give him
[1:46:39] credit for
[1:46:40] what he said is potentially adultery
[1:46:44] because themselves are crossing over
[1:46:47] it proves that somehow even in my
[1:46:51] birth my natural first birth
[1:46:55] i carry in my body the identity
[1:46:58] of everything that come before me oh
[1:47:01] glory to god hang on i'm coming to
[1:47:03] something
[1:47:04] because i'm born off the tree of
[1:47:06] knowledge of good and evil
[1:47:08] i've got if i've got my dad's nose and i
[1:47:10] do if i've got my mama's eyes and that
[1:47:13] big round garrett face
[1:47:15] then don't i also have their temper
[1:47:17] their impatience
[1:47:19] don't i also carry with me all those
[1:47:21] sinful type things that come down
[1:47:22] through these genetics
[1:47:24] and how did it come to us through the
[1:47:26] sexual reproduction program
[1:47:28] off the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:47:29] evil but when brother branham went
[1:47:31] beyond the curtain of time
[1:47:33] he said those women women women
[1:47:36] came to him and hugged him
[1:47:40] glory to god he said it wasn't like it
[1:47:44] would be here on earth there was no
[1:47:46] sensation glory to god
[1:47:50] why because all of that will be taken
[1:47:54] away from you there will be no
[1:47:55] reproductive organs in your body in
[1:47:58] heaven
[1:48:01] you say well what's that got to do with
[1:48:02] anything it is the identity
[1:48:05] of all that you have carried in your
[1:48:06] flesh all these years
[1:48:12] and so when jesus changes our body
[1:48:16] he said i'll be made just like the
[1:48:18] angels
[1:48:19] as though i never smoked never cursed
[1:48:24] never lied
[1:48:33] amen it'll be as though none of that
[1:48:37] ever took place
[1:48:38] how could i be truly justified
[1:48:41] and carry my tattoos to heaven
[1:48:45] how can i be genuinely justified
[1:48:48] and carry ear piercings to heaven
[1:48:52] the very marks in my body would prove
[1:48:54] that i was a sinner
[1:48:56] but when we stand there on that day
[1:48:58] brother drunks prostitutes and
[1:49:00] everything else
[1:49:02] not only will he wipe away the tears or
[1:49:04] the memory
[1:49:05] of where we come from but he will so
[1:49:09] change our body until we won't even
[1:49:12] resemble
[1:49:16] how we were born we won't even look
[1:49:22] in that same manner as what we looked as
[1:49:24] a circle
[1:49:28] he'll change us completely until we'll
[1:49:31] be like the angels again watch this luke
[1:49:33] 20 and verse 36 neither can they die
[1:49:35] anymore for they are equal
[1:49:38] unto the angels and are the children of
[1:49:40] god amen
[1:49:42] being the children of the resurrection
[1:49:45] isn't that what we're talking and
[1:49:46] focusing on this weekend isn't that what
[1:49:48] easter is all about for us
[1:49:50] is a resurrected lord jesus
[1:49:53] why did he resurrect so you and i could
[1:49:54] resurrect
[1:49:59] praise the people focusing on the
[1:50:01] rapture the rapture is a great thing but
[1:50:02] listen resurrection's just as great
[1:50:05] if i go by the way of the grave if my
[1:50:07] life is terminated on this earth
[1:50:10] i have a hope that once i am planted in
[1:50:13] the ground
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:17] there is a germ of life
[1:50:20] inside my heart if you plant me
[1:50:24] in the ground all it will take is for
[1:50:26] the great
[1:50:27] s-o-n to raise on the resurrection day
[1:50:31] and i will come out of that grave amen
[1:50:34] just the same as i went into it
[1:50:39] because what goes down must come up
[1:50:43] and if i went down i've got to come up
[1:50:46] senator saint you're coming up anyways
[1:50:49] but as a believer
[1:50:52] a son of god there is a a power
[1:50:57] that now worketh hallelujah in the
[1:51:00] children of god
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:03] for if by his spirit it quickened him
[1:51:06] from the dead
[1:51:07] it will hurt so high it will
[1:51:10] also quicken your mortal body
[1:51:17] i mean seriously what good would it do
[1:51:20] for you to go to heaven
[1:51:23] and and and wonder well
[1:51:27] my body's been changed i wonder if that
[1:51:30] scar from that knife fight i got in in
[1:51:32] the 70s is still there
[1:51:36] when i was drunk that night in the bar
[1:51:38] and somebody took a beer bottle and cut
[1:51:40] a gash in my eye and i've carried that
[1:51:41] scar
[1:51:42] my whole life if you carry that to
[1:51:44] heaven
[1:51:45] it would show the identity of what she
[1:51:47] was on the earth
[1:51:49] god has to change every bit of them
[1:51:52] i want you to think this is the reason
[1:51:54] why there ain't no old folk in heaven
[1:51:57] and that's why there ain't no babies in
[1:51:58] heaven a baby has no history
[1:52:02] an older person has a history sure
[1:52:05] they've got they've got attributes about
[1:52:07] him that does not match with that
[1:52:08] heavenly agenda
[1:52:09] amen glory to god do you not realize
[1:52:13] that we are getting ready to go to the
[1:52:14] greatest youth camp we've ever been
[1:52:16] invited to help
[1:52:18] well we will be they'll be 19-21
[1:52:21] in the bloom of health
[1:52:25] brother you talk about a youth camp
[1:52:27] we're getting ready to assemble for the
[1:52:30] greatest youth rally we've ever seen
[1:52:34] there won't be an old person there
[1:52:38] no no balding head none of that jesus
[1:52:40] even said i'll fix it so every hair your
[1:52:42] head is numbered
[1:52:45] praise be to god oh
[1:52:48] thank you lord so he took not on him
[1:52:52] the nature of angels
[1:52:56] because you remember if jesus had come
[1:52:57] to this earth and been like an angel
[1:53:00] he couldn't have died a sinner
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:05] but he come as a man that was going to
[1:53:08] be rejected by god
[1:53:11] and jesus was rejected so that we could
[1:53:15] be accepted
[1:53:18] this is why he did not die an angel he
[1:53:22] did not die the son of god
[1:53:24] he did not die the holy spirit he died
[1:53:28] as a sinner
[1:53:31] brother man tells us in demolition in
[1:53:32] 1954 he said and god sent him to hell
[1:53:36] to pay for my sins
[1:53:39] oh but because of where he came from
[1:53:41] when he got down to hell
[1:53:43] the only thing he could do was demand
[1:53:44] the keys
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:49] do you realize brother sister that the
[1:53:50] devil don't even have the keys to his
[1:53:53] own house
[1:53:57] jesus goes down and said my blood is
[1:53:59] still warm on calvary
[1:54:00] give me the keys
[1:54:08] oh praise god
[1:54:11] oh i told my wife i'm going to preach a
[1:54:13] short sermon tonight the way y'all are
[1:54:14] pulling we're liable to be here another
[1:54:16] two hours
[1:54:18] when i get to feeling like this forget
[1:54:20] about the clock forget it
[1:54:22] they don't exist amen listen to this now
[1:54:25] we understand that angels do not have
[1:54:27] infinite knowledge as well mark chapter
[1:54:29] 13 verse 32
[1:54:30] but of the day and the hour that day no
[1:54:33] not the angels no no man
[1:54:34] which is in heaven or the son but the
[1:54:36] father so and again
[1:54:38] it tells us that when revelation 8 1
[1:54:40] when the seventh seal had opened there
[1:54:41] was silence in heaven but the man said
[1:54:43] the reason they
[1:54:44] were silenced the angels never
[1:54:45] understood it now this ought to make you
[1:54:48] shout
[1:54:48] until your shouter shouts because if you
[1:54:52] realize that the devil
[1:54:53] at one time was an angel so if the
[1:54:56] angels have
[1:54:57] infinite knowledge that means the devil
[1:55:00] and every demon would have
[1:55:02] infinite knowledge about you
[1:55:05] come on somebody but the reason they
[1:55:08] don't have a successful fight
[1:55:10] and they're always going to lose is
[1:55:13] because they
[1:55:14] don't know what your next steps in life
[1:55:17] are
[1:55:18] oh hallelujah they don't know what god
[1:55:22] is going to do
[1:55:23] with you the devil don't know my
[1:55:27] thoughts the devil don't know my heart
[1:55:29] the devil don't know my mind the devil
[1:55:32] don't know anything
[1:55:34] but what i or god lets him know
[1:55:40] and if i'm stupid enough and ignorant
[1:55:42] enough to open up my mouth
[1:55:45] i declare and he wins the battle every
[1:55:47] time the second i open my mouth and let
[1:55:49] him know what i'm thinking
[1:55:52] but if i'm in the hardest battle and
[1:55:54] trial i've ever been in my life if i'll
[1:55:56] just keep grinning
[1:55:58] he don't know what's going on with me as
[1:56:01] he is not a discerner of the thoughts
[1:56:02] and the intents of the heart
[1:56:05] satan didn't understand the mystery of
[1:56:06] job
[1:56:08] remember he come to god he said you know
[1:56:09] i would deal with him if you'd let him
[1:56:11] go he never understood the mystery of
[1:56:13] job's life
[1:56:14] he could not understand how that god
[1:56:16] would have such a hedge around this man
[1:56:19] he even challenged him take it off he
[1:56:21] said all right but don't you touch his
[1:56:22] life
[1:56:24] i imagine the devil probably said why
[1:56:25] can't i touch his life why is he so
[1:56:28] important oh
[1:56:30] glory
[1:56:33] he's a man like everybody else he's got
[1:56:36] two eyes two ears two nose or whatever
[1:56:38] else he's got
[1:56:39] amen he's just like everybody else come
[1:56:41] on now
[1:56:43] what makes him so special
[1:56:48] i tell what made him so special it was
[1:56:50] god's thought about him
[1:56:52] and how god felt about this man job
[1:56:56] and just as the devil never understood
[1:56:58] the mystery of job's life
[1:57:00] he did not understand the mystery of the
[1:57:02] life of jesus
[1:57:03] brother adam said jesus he the devil
[1:57:06] never believed he was the son of god
[1:57:09] he's watched every baby been born ever
[1:57:12] since
[1:57:12] cain made the first cry and ever since
[1:57:14] abel made the first squeal
[1:57:16] the devil has witnessed birth in this
[1:57:18] world
[1:57:19] and when jesus was born from mary had a
[1:57:22] placenta
[1:57:23] had water had blood the baby would look
[1:57:26] like blue and
[1:57:27] shriveled up like babies look when
[1:57:29] they're born they ugly when they're born
[1:57:31] friend i'm sorry they just
[1:57:32] are they might be the most precious
[1:57:36] thing you ever laid your eyes on but
[1:57:37] that's after you get them out of the
[1:57:39] hospital and get them pink bows in their
[1:57:40] hair they look good then
[1:57:42] but when they come out of that mess they
[1:57:43] do not look like they look
[1:57:46] oh yes so the devil took one look at
[1:57:49] mary down there
[1:57:50] and saw jesus born like every other
[1:57:52] child was born
[1:57:54] and god hid the mystery of the life of
[1:57:55] the son of god in that natural birth
[1:57:58] never understanding what jesus was
[1:58:00] watching when he meets him in mount in
[1:58:02] matthew 4
[1:58:03] if thou be the son of god still
[1:58:06] questioning whether he was or not
[1:58:10] satan never understood the mystery of
[1:58:11] the life of jesus
[1:58:13] the same as he don't understand the
[1:58:14] mystery of your life
[1:58:17] he is not convinced that you are
[1:58:20] all that important but i got a message
[1:58:23] tonight
[1:58:24] i've got something i want to say to the
[1:58:26] saints of god never mind the devil
[1:58:28] but i got something i want to say to you
[1:58:30] amen just stick around a little while
[1:58:33] and you'll find out what god really
[1:58:35] thinks about you
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:44] sure in the in the mountain caramel show
[1:58:46] down it come right
[1:58:48] down to where elijah could do a lot of
[1:58:49] talking but it was god had to do the
[1:58:51] walking
[1:58:52] when jesus stood on mount
[1:58:53] transfiguration it was the holy spirit
[1:58:55] god his father that come down on that
[1:58:56] mountain
[1:58:57] and performed all of those great things
[1:58:59] to block out everybody save jesus
[1:59:01] alone and in the third showdown between
[1:59:04] you and me and denominations and
[1:59:06] all the rest of this world it'll be the
[1:59:08] same way jesus will speak for this bride
[1:59:12] amen remember what he said in the book
[1:59:13] of revelation he said though come an
[1:59:14] hour
[1:59:15] well he'll make them fallen short feet
[1:59:18] and declare these are the ones that i
[1:59:19] loved
[1:59:23] oh i know why you ain't screaming that's
[1:59:25] hard for you to swallow
[1:59:27] don't forget eagles were called to
[1:59:29] swallow such things
[1:59:31] your throat's big enough just get your
[1:59:32] mouth open you'll get it
[1:59:36] praise the lord right even the angels
[1:59:39] didn't understand could you imagine how
[1:59:41] he must have felt when brother branham
[1:59:44] comes to this earth
[1:59:45] and begins to tear off that first seal
[1:59:48] and begin to look at it
[1:59:49] and say well that was christ
[1:59:52] don't you understand the devil had
[1:59:55] enough sense to know he was the writer
[1:59:57] of that first age
[1:59:59] it was really so simple that satan could
[2:00:01] have explained what the horse rider was
[2:00:03] about
[2:00:03] he lived it that wasn't the real mystery
[2:00:06] behind those seals
[2:00:08] the real mystery behind the seals was
[2:00:10] not a doctrine get that out of your mind
[2:00:12] that is not what those seals were all
[2:00:14] about
[2:00:15] the real revelation of the seals had
[2:00:17] nothing to do with solving little simple
[2:00:19] mysteries of god
[2:00:20] as to what happened in the garden and
[2:00:22] those type of things you got the concept
[2:00:24] of it all wrong
[2:00:26] brother explains it to us in the breach
[2:00:28] what it really was
[2:00:30] that the lamb's book of life had been
[2:00:32] sealed with seven seals
[2:00:35] now we're getting down to the real
[2:00:37] meaning
[2:00:38] and in that book was names
[2:00:48] in that book was names of the sons
[2:00:51] and the daughters of god
[2:00:53] [Applause]
[2:00:57] when these people running around saw
[2:00:59] brother brown didn't do nothing big in
[2:01:00] the seals anybody could have saw that
[2:01:02] was world war two
[2:01:03] shaw the devil understood he was a
[2:01:05] deception in the first
[2:01:07] you think satan didn't know he was
[2:01:09] riding out like a white horse rider
[2:01:11] conquering a car you think he didn't
[2:01:12] know what he was doing when that sword
[2:01:14] turned red
[2:01:16] the devil had enough sense to parallel
[2:01:18] it that wasn't the mystery that was hid
[2:01:21] the mystery that was hid was them little
[2:01:24] sons and daughters of god that would
[2:01:25] come along in the 20th century
[2:01:29] squealing and being born along about
[2:01:31] 1977 or so
[2:01:35] and they would live their life for about
[2:01:36] 12 years not knowing where they come
[2:01:38] from really
[2:01:40] and all of a sudden the real meaning of
[2:01:42] the seals would take place
[2:01:45] when god would speak to me you are no
[2:01:47] longer a
[2:01:48] son of homer and wilma norad but you're
[2:01:51] mine
[2:01:54] that is the real mystery
[2:01:57] that larkin nor none of them had not
[2:02:00] even an
[2:02:01] inkling of how to define it or
[2:02:04] explain it and my message to that
[2:02:07] is plagiarize that
[2:02:14] there is no plagiarism to such things
[2:02:18] brother branham's ministry was not to
[2:02:20] put together facts and figures and dates
[2:02:22] and explained to us in vivid detail
[2:02:24] the daniel 70 weeks the whole purpose of
[2:02:27] those mysteries of god was to do one
[2:02:29] thing
[2:02:29] and that was to position israel to
[2:02:31] particip position the church because the
[2:02:33] church is not the bride
[2:02:35] come on the church is not the bride the
[2:02:38] church is the foolish virgin the
[2:02:40] remnant that will go through the
[2:02:41] tribulation come on
[2:02:43] she is not the bride the church goes
[2:02:45] through the tribulation
[2:02:46] the bride goes out of here
[2:02:50] that was not the mystery of it the
[2:02:53] mystery of it was that day you opened up
[2:02:54] your bible and you went
[2:02:56] hmm
[2:02:59] what does that mean for me
[2:03:03] how do i fit into all of that
[2:03:08] god i wish somebody would help me right
[2:03:10] now
[2:03:13] praise be to god hallelujah and amen
[2:03:17] that was the real thing remember as we
[2:03:20] were talking about it last night
[2:03:21] when the sit when the thunders declared
[2:03:23] themselves in the heaven
[2:03:25] john heard what was declared the real
[2:03:28] ministry for john was not when the
[2:03:30] little book come open and the angel come
[2:03:32] down
[2:03:32] to hand him hold the book out like this
[2:03:34] he didn't say
[2:03:35] hmm so who was that first horse rider
[2:03:38] anyways
[2:03:41] that was not the ministry of revelation
[2:03:42] 10 8. the ministry of revelation 10 8
[2:03:45] was to unify
[2:03:46] and become one with the mystery
[2:03:51] praise be to god that's why you've got
[2:03:54] to find yourself
[2:03:56] in the word if you don't know your
[2:04:00] position in the word
[2:04:01] the devil can beat you around the stamp
[2:04:06] but if you know your position in the
[2:04:10] body of jesus christ
[2:04:12] there's not enough devils
[2:04:16] to take it away from you
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:20] praise god hallelujah
[2:04:27] in so much that in first peter chapter 1
[2:04:29] verse 12 the bible said
[2:04:31] that the angels of god looked or
[2:04:34] desired to look and they means they
[2:04:36] stooped
[2:04:39] to look down
[2:04:42] the meaning of that word look means to
[2:04:44] become acquainted with something
[2:04:48] you see jesus said these angels have
[2:04:50] beheld your father's
[2:04:52] face that since the day you were born
[2:04:54] actually
[2:04:56] every person has an angel until they
[2:04:59] come to the age of accountability
[2:05:01] every person has someone an angel of the
[2:05:04] lord that follows them
[2:05:06] to give them an opportunity at christ
[2:05:09] sure but reject christ you reject
[2:05:12] everything that comes with christ
[2:05:14] that's why you hear people of these
[2:05:15] centers back when they were kids and
[2:05:17] supernatural things happened and they
[2:05:19] could have died could have been run over
[2:05:20] all kinds of things but somehow
[2:05:21] something stepped in the way that's
[2:05:22] right the lord must be just
[2:05:25] so he sent to them angelic visitors to
[2:05:27] watch over him to give him an
[2:05:28] opportunity but when they rejected
[2:05:30] christ
[2:05:31] all of that just went away what remains
[2:05:34] is the same thing with the foolish
[2:05:35] virgin
[2:05:36] the real mystery of god of the foolish
[2:05:38] virgin are the ones that their name
[2:05:39] remained on the book of life
[2:05:42] everybody else was blotted out cain
[2:05:44] judas esau
[2:05:46] had their name in the book but blotted
[2:05:48] out the real mystery of them foolish
[2:05:50] virgins they're the ones
[2:05:52] that live so close to god till it's
[2:05:54] never blotted out
[2:05:58] and they've watched you all of your days
[2:06:00] watched you when you was rioting
[2:06:03] yeah watched you when he was in the bar
[2:06:05] room
[2:06:07] watched you when you was out in the
[2:06:08] world or whatever you might have been
[2:06:10] they watched over you all of your days
[2:06:12] they've studied you since the day you
[2:06:13] took the breath of life
[2:06:14] remember the prophet of god said when
[2:06:16] your mother was going to give birth to
[2:06:17] you
[2:06:18] she got real sweet because there was an
[2:06:21] angelic presence i know for believers
[2:06:23] that's you as well i get that but it was
[2:06:25] also the angels of the lord
[2:06:27] hastening your birth into this world
[2:06:33] they've watched you all the days of your
[2:06:34] life
[2:06:36] but that moment perhaps at the altar
[2:06:38] when the holy spirit got a hold of your
[2:06:40] heart
[2:06:41] and you come up and you maybe knelt down
[2:06:43] or stood up at the altar somebody laid
[2:06:45] hands on you and the holy ghost come
[2:06:46] down and wonderfully and beautifully
[2:06:48] delivered you
[2:06:49] and filled you with the holy ghost that
[2:06:52] angel of the lord has watched you all of
[2:06:54] your life
[2:06:56] stoop down and inspected you
[2:07:03] what is going on with brother juan
[2:07:07] what is going on with scott why
[2:07:10] they're different somehow do you know
[2:07:13] the bible said that your
[2:07:14] prayers are stored in heaven like vials
[2:07:16] did you know that
[2:07:17] did you know that the prophet of god
[2:07:19] said that the day that somebody got
[2:07:21] saved just any
[2:07:22] general person that maybe their mother
[2:07:23] had prayed for them and prayed for them
[2:07:25] and prayed for them
[2:07:26] and that person that mother went beyond
[2:07:28] the curtain of time do you know that
[2:07:29] brother banham said
[2:07:30] that the night that that boy got saved
[2:07:32] or that girl got saved
[2:07:33] that the angels of the lord went back
[2:07:35] around the throne of god where mommy was
[2:07:37] standing
[2:07:38] and told him your boy got saved remember
[2:07:40] you prayed for him all those years
[2:07:42] that girl got saved tonight we can't
[2:07:45] communicate with the dead
[2:07:46] but they can send the message back ah
[2:07:50] no wonder there is a great cloud of
[2:07:52] witnesses being prepared
[2:07:54] on the other side don't you realize
[2:07:57] while you're sitting here even in the
[2:07:58] house of god tonight
[2:08:00] every time you worship the lord every
[2:08:02] time you say amen
[2:08:04] every time you read your bible there is
[2:08:07] a message going back to the other side
[2:08:10] get ready get ready the bride is
[2:08:14] almost ready
[2:08:23] no wonder when brother branham made his
[2:08:25] journey over
[2:08:27] it was almost like somebody had already
[2:08:31] told them
[2:08:32] he was coming
[2:08:36] remember they come running to him
[2:08:40] praise the lord amen
[2:08:44] so all this time
[2:08:48] this angel desired to know what is it
[2:08:52] what's going on with them so they
[2:08:55] stooped they bowed over
[2:09:00] i wish i could understand what that was
[2:09:02] about
[2:09:04] you see the angels of the lord have such
[2:09:06] power that in world war one for example
[2:09:09] there was an angel of god given the
[2:09:11] commission to hold the four winds of the
[2:09:13] earth
[2:09:14] this angel was so powerful that the
[2:09:16] prophet said
[2:09:17] if that war had been allowed to continue
[2:09:20] that it would have caused armageddon
[2:09:22] across the whole earth did you know he
[2:09:23] said that
[2:09:24] but god had to stop it because there
[2:09:25] were some sons
[2:09:28] and some daughters that had to be sealed
[2:09:31] still
[2:09:33] and so this angel of god at permission
[2:09:35] of the holy spirit
[2:09:36] steps out on the 11th hour of the day
[2:09:39] the 11th month hallelujah
[2:09:42] and puts his big hands out and says stop
[2:09:46] and without any understanding whatsoever
[2:09:48] historians cannot still they still they
[2:09:50] still it's right now still
[2:09:52] 21st century still cannot figure out
[2:09:54] what brought an end to the great war
[2:09:57] and we got the answer right in the bible
[2:10:00] it was an angel of the lord that had the
[2:10:01] power
[2:10:03] to say stop oh praise the lord
[2:10:07] but you recognize that with all that
[2:10:10] great power when you got saved
[2:10:22] no wonder the scripture said that when
[2:10:24] one gets saved in heaven
[2:10:28] the angels rejoice
[2:10:35] they don't do like we do just sit in
[2:10:36] church and well ain't that great well
[2:10:38] we'll give them six months see where
[2:10:39] they are in six months
[2:10:42] no that's that's our rotten attitude
[2:10:45] the angels of the lord
[2:10:49] because you see they've been watching
[2:10:50] folks get filled with the holy ghost for
[2:10:51] the last 2000 years
[2:10:53] and they know what the reel looks like
[2:10:59] you ain't got a fallen angel of the lord
[2:11:02] they know what the real holy ghost looks
[2:11:04] like
[2:11:05] oh bless the lord oh my
[2:11:09] listen in in in in matthew chapter 4
[2:11:12] verse 11. now notice the angels of the
[2:11:14] lord are servants to the elect
[2:11:16] did you know that the bible said that
[2:11:18] not only do they
[2:11:19] go up and down jacob's ladder but they
[2:11:21] also encamped so there's always a host
[2:11:24] encamped
[2:11:25] about the angels of the lord that
[2:11:26] doesn't mean that the angels of the lord
[2:11:28] don't have missions and things they run
[2:11:29] back to heaven
[2:11:30] that's what jacob's latter was all about
[2:11:32] some of them are around the throne room
[2:11:33] of god
[2:11:34] protecting the hell of the holy spirit
[2:11:36] the four guards up there
[2:11:38] protecting around the throne room of god
[2:11:40] you before you can even get a prayer
[2:11:41] through you've got to get through them
[2:11:42] angels
[2:11:44] there's guards protecting the throne
[2:11:45] room of god sure
[2:11:47] the bible said all of them angels are
[2:11:49] surrounding new jerusalem
[2:11:51] paul spoke about it when he said there's
[2:11:52] an innumerable host you know what i love
[2:11:54] about that
[2:11:55] i like what my buddy brother andrew
[2:11:57] glover said you know andrew
[2:11:59] his size 19 foot and brother andrew i
[2:12:02] love what he said the other day he was
[2:12:03] preaching in here
[2:12:04] and and we was singing at a meeting
[2:12:06] samantha 9. brother andrew said
[2:12:08] you know in the bible he talked about
[2:12:10] how that there was a 2
[2:12:11] 000 000 devils remember that but when
[2:12:14] the angels of the lord were counted
[2:12:16] they were innumerable
[2:12:19] you can count the demons but you can't
[2:12:21] count the angels of the lord
[2:12:24] and you think that when you need help
[2:12:28] that there's not resources available for
[2:12:32] you
[2:12:35] now watch the arrangement of this in
[2:12:36] matthew chapter 4 verse 11. now here
[2:12:38] jesus is entrenched in battle
[2:12:40] right then the devil leaveth him
[2:12:45] and behold angels came and ministered
[2:12:49] unto him now
[2:12:49] the meaning of this word if you want to
[2:12:51] know what the meaning of this word is it
[2:12:52] means to wait at a table
[2:12:54] and offer food and drink to guests
[2:12:58] so an angel by definition by the very
[2:13:00] meaning of the word ministered
[2:13:03] an angel is called of god to be your
[2:13:06] waiter
[2:13:09] now friend i'm just reading to you what
[2:13:10] the bible said
[2:13:12] have you ever went to a restaurant and
[2:13:14] sat down there and nobody comes and
[2:13:16] serves you
[2:13:17] it's irritating isn't it nothing worse i
[2:13:20] hate there's three things in this life i
[2:13:22] hate sitting at a red light i hate a red
[2:13:24] light
[2:13:24] i hate to fly and i hate going to a
[2:13:27] restaurant and not being refilled on my
[2:13:29] pepsis
[2:13:30] diet pepsi i i it just irritates me to
[2:13:34] death because i sit there and watch them
[2:13:35] go back and forth and back and forth and
[2:13:36] i think one of them trips you could have
[2:13:38] got me a diet pepsi
[2:13:41] but if you ever walk would you expect to
[2:13:42] go into a five-star
[2:13:44] you know michelin-style type chef and go
[2:13:46] on there and sit down
[2:13:48] samantha and i had the privileged
[2:13:49] opportunity to go with some saints one
[2:13:51] time
[2:13:51] to one of these real fancy swanky
[2:13:53] michelin type restaurants
[2:13:55] and they had one guy his one job was to
[2:13:58] fill everybody's water
[2:13:59] and he would catch it the last drop go
[2:14:01] in your mouth he would grab the cup fill
[2:14:03] it up and put it back in your hand
[2:14:05] that was his only mission was to make
[2:14:07] sure you had water at your table
[2:14:10] would you imagine to go in there and go
[2:14:11] spend 130 a person or 230
[2:14:14] a person and you're gonna get this big
[2:14:16] fancy meal and walk in
[2:14:17] sit down and sit there for 20 minutes
[2:14:19] and nobody can come and take your order
[2:14:22] you know how you'd react to that you
[2:14:24] would get on you'd get on yelp
[2:14:26] you'd help all right you'd fuss
[2:14:30] you would you would stew you would go on
[2:14:32] google you would be
[2:14:33] i mean if you're one of them type of
[2:14:35] people that like to put in your review
[2:14:36] on google you would tear them
[2:14:38] limb from limb your words would be so
[2:14:42] sharp you wouldn't know you really would
[2:14:44] you there would be just such a
[2:14:46] a a a hatred and a and a
[2:14:49] fire coming out of your fingers
[2:14:54] forgive me but it's the truth
[2:14:57] but yet when you walk into them places
[2:14:59] the business
[2:15:01] has saw fit that when you sat down at
[2:15:04] their tables
[2:15:06] they've got people ordained to wait on
[2:15:10] you
[2:15:12] now god has arranged his whole economy
[2:15:17] with powers joy healing
[2:15:21] deliverance peace long suffering
[2:15:25] patience godliness gentleness
[2:15:28] meekness authority victory
[2:15:32] songs amen good rest you know the bible
[2:15:36] promised us good sleep we have been
[2:15:39] given
[2:15:39] all of these the business has provided
[2:15:42] the chief
[2:15:43] chef has provided for us everything we
[2:15:46] have need of
[2:15:47] have you ever went to a kitchen and
[2:15:49] heard a quiet kitchen don't eat there
[2:15:51] because a good kitchen is a busy kitchen
[2:15:54] a noisy kitchen
[2:15:56] and you know why all that activity is
[2:15:58] going on because there's some people out
[2:16:00] there on them tables that's putting in
[2:16:02] some orders
[2:16:05] some people in this message believe that
[2:16:06] heaven is going to be a place of a
[2:16:08] little folding of their hands a little
[2:16:09] slumber and a little sleep
[2:16:12] they're going to be so quiet you know
[2:16:14] kind of like you are tonight oh i'm just
[2:16:16] a
[2:16:16] quiet person yes until you see your
[2:16:18] favorite dress in the store or
[2:16:20] that sale at joann fabric or
[2:16:25] or some football game or ice hockey
[2:16:26] thing or some other kind of deal like
[2:16:28] that
[2:16:29] oh and then all of a sudden you become
[2:16:30] jubilant beyond explanation
[2:16:33] sure people think that heaven is going
[2:16:35] to be a quiet place i got news for you
[2:16:38] heaven is a metropolis of activity
[2:16:43] the angels could you imagine just the
[2:16:45] prayers
[2:16:46] just the prayers of you that's in this
[2:16:49] room
[2:16:50] could you imagine if i was going to
[2:16:52] serve you to eat
[2:16:53] tonight and i pulled up to each one of
[2:16:56] your tables
[2:16:57] and asked you to give me the desires of
[2:17:00] your heart
[2:17:00] in a culinary fashion and say i want
[2:17:03] this
[2:17:03] i want that i want could you imagine me
[2:17:06] how busy i would be just serving this
[2:17:09] little body right here
[2:17:12] hallelujah hallelujah no wonder brother
[2:17:16] he's not just collecting the prayers of
[2:17:18] the last few hours
[2:17:20] he's collecting the prayers of your
[2:17:22] entire walk with god
[2:17:24] [Applause]
[2:17:26] heaven is a beehive of activity
[2:17:30] because the saints are always keeping
[2:17:32] things moving
[2:17:39] oh i love that so if you sat down at a
[2:17:43] restaurant like that and nobody served
[2:17:44] you
[2:17:45] you'd be mad as a hornet going back
[2:17:48] there again
[2:17:50] and yet when it comes to serving the
[2:17:52] lord when we have a need
[2:17:54] all we have to do is call for it
[2:17:59] i need healing all you got to do is call
[2:18:02] for it
[2:18:04] and ask the waiter bring me my healing
[2:18:09] glory to god bring me my deliverance
[2:18:12] bring me my children bring me my
[2:18:15] grandchildren
[2:18:16] all you've got to do is ask
[2:18:20] me because you have not
[2:18:25] because you ask not
[2:18:31] somebody asked me one time brother ben
[2:18:33] it makes me uncomfortable hearing this
[2:18:35] kind of preaching because what if i'm in
[2:18:37] the
[2:18:37] bathroom or i'm taking a shower or an
[2:18:40] intimate place or an embarrassing place
[2:18:42] or something like that and these angels
[2:18:43] of the lord looking down on me i said
[2:18:45] well let me ask you a question said yeah
[2:18:46] i said have you ever went to a
[2:18:47] restaurant and a waiter take your order
[2:18:49] yeah i said do they stand there and
[2:18:50] listen to all the conversation and
[2:18:51] engage or they go away
[2:18:56] and the man and his wife said well they
[2:18:57] go away i said that's right because they
[2:18:59] have a respect for their position
[2:19:01] they're not interested in what you look
[2:19:03] like when you're in the bathroom they're
[2:19:04] not there taking notes when you're
[2:19:06] amen changing your clothes or some kind
[2:19:08] of nonsense that's an earthly carnal
[2:19:10] idea of what these angels of the lord
[2:19:12] are they are there
[2:19:14] to get your order and take it back to
[2:19:16] the kitchen
[2:19:19] amen and they don't move until you move
[2:19:22] them
[2:19:26] oh praise the lord
[2:19:31] i probably shouldn't pick this up right
[2:19:32] now probably should do this tomorrow but
[2:19:34] i'm going to hit it
[2:19:36] let's just take 10 minutes okay
[2:19:41] when daniel set his heart to understand
[2:19:48] gabriel told him the moment
[2:19:53] that you set your heart to understand
[2:19:57] it created activity in heaven
[2:20:05] he said 21 days ago we heard you up here
[2:20:13] but you see this was such such a special
[2:20:15] meal it took a little
[2:20:16] bit of fighting to get it down to daniel
[2:20:19] and it just so happened that the angel
[2:20:21] or the demon that he met had more power
[2:20:23] than him
[2:20:25] because he said the prince of persia
[2:20:27] withstood me in other words remember the
[2:20:28] prophet of god said
[2:20:29] those demons remember victory day shalom
[2:20:31] he said that demons have control over
[2:20:33] nations
[2:20:34] and he said what causes wars on the
[2:20:36] earth them two demons get jealous of one
[2:20:38] another and their influence spreads to
[2:20:40] the earth and causes war
[2:20:43] kind of like what happens in churches
[2:20:46] and one gets one against another another
[2:20:47] gets another and another one gets
[2:20:48] another kind of like singers
[2:20:50] musicians somebody outplays them or does
[2:20:52] a little bit better of a note or
[2:20:53] something like that and then they get
[2:20:54] jealous and they hold hard feelings come
[2:20:56] on
[2:20:57] come on don't you all look at me like
[2:20:58] that we are known around the message for
[2:21:01] our splitting and our jealousy and our
[2:21:03] this that and the others sure we are
[2:21:04] we've been marked by it
[2:21:07] you know what it is demon activity
[2:21:12] kingdom building and all the such alike
[2:21:15] sure it is
[2:21:16] and i'll admit there are times that
[2:21:19] probably
[2:21:20] you know uh uh the prophet of god i'm
[2:21:23] sure
[2:21:23] probably scratched his head a lot at
[2:21:24] what he saw
[2:21:26] i don't think brother branham understood
[2:21:28] everything he was looking at
[2:21:30] here's this prophet of god with this
[2:21:32] great evangelistical ministry he's got
[2:21:33] the greatest ministry on the planet
[2:21:36] and like daniel when he looked out over
[2:21:38] the landscape of them israelites falling
[2:21:40] down
[2:21:40] and worshiping at the image of daniel
[2:21:43] daniel was the image the
[2:21:44] the idol it was daniel and daniel is
[2:21:47] watching these jews fall down and
[2:21:49] worship his own image
[2:21:50] when he looked across the landscape of
[2:21:52] his people something in his heart began
[2:21:54] to ring and he said oh god
[2:21:56] we need to understand what's going on
[2:21:58] around here
[2:21:59] i don't believe brother braham
[2:22:00] understood everything he saw
[2:22:03] but i imagine when he got to that point
[2:22:05] in his ministry of evangelism where
[2:22:06] things started repeating themselves you
[2:22:08] see
[2:22:09] when you're doing a scientific study or
[2:22:11] a research study they say when you hit
[2:22:12] saturation what they call data
[2:22:14] saturation
[2:22:15] is when you start getting the same
[2:22:16] information over and over and over again
[2:22:19] and you're listening to brother branham
[2:22:20] he's seeing the same thing happen he
[2:22:22] said i went to california and preached
[2:22:23] on you women cutting your hair and next
[2:22:25] year there was more of you than there
[2:22:26] was the year before
[2:22:28] he's hitting a saturation point he's
[2:22:29] looking across the landscape of his
[2:22:31] people
[2:22:31] and something is wrong and this prophet
[2:22:35] begins to set
[2:22:36] his heart to understand what's taking
[2:22:38] place amongst the body
[2:22:41] no wonder seven angels visited him on
[2:22:43] sunset
[2:22:45] because brother branham wanted to know
[2:22:47] it created activity in another dimension
[2:22:50] and that's how we got the seals and the
[2:22:53] revelation of jesus christ
[2:22:55] because he wanted to know what was truth
[2:22:58] what do you all reckon god would do
[2:23:00] if you really wanted to understand who
[2:23:02] you were i mean
[2:23:04] really understand you see people say
[2:23:05] things they say they want to get it they
[2:23:08] say they want to understand it
[2:23:09] they say they have that feeling but your
[2:23:11] actions prove you don't really want it
[2:23:14] you say you want the holy ghost you pick
[2:23:15] your bible up once every six months
[2:23:17] you're a liar
[2:23:18] i care what your name is you're lying
[2:23:21] because if you really want it you will
[2:23:23] fight every day of your life there won't
[2:23:25] be a moment that goes by in your life
[2:23:27] you won't be seeking and fighting and
[2:23:28] stretching
[2:23:29] trying to get to that place in christ
[2:23:32] you say whatever you want to but the
[2:23:33] fact of the proof is in the pudding and
[2:23:35] the eating thereof
[2:23:38] people say they want deliverance still
[2:23:39] goofing off of the same old things that
[2:23:41] they want deliverance from
[2:23:42] you don't want deliverance you want
[2:23:44] somebody to pacify you and tell you to
[2:23:46] be all right
[2:23:47] no no that ain't the way god does things
[2:23:50] the holy spirit wants you to become so
[2:23:52] determined
[2:23:54] separate from all things that's ungodly
[2:23:56] and anything contrary to christ
[2:24:01] and the moment you set your heart to
[2:24:02] understand it creates activity
[2:24:07] in another dimension don't get nervous
[2:24:10] if i come out from behind that i've been
[2:24:12] vaccinated
[2:24:15] hallelujah but brother sister
[2:24:19] whenever we see the angels of the lord
[2:24:21] acting
[2:24:23] we think what does it mean for me
[2:24:28] you remember there's two women that come
[2:24:29] up in the prayer line
[2:24:32] the prophet of god was standing there in
[2:24:33] his discernment and things and he said
[2:24:35] well you've got trouble with your throat
[2:24:36] or something of that nature and you had
[2:24:38] trouble with your stomach
[2:24:40] go on the lord's healed you and so forth
[2:24:42] they go on in you know and
[2:24:44] and and a couple days later the woman
[2:24:47] gets up and she's hungry so she drinks
[2:24:48] some coffee and scrambled some eggs that
[2:24:50] tasted pretty good so she started it on
[2:24:52] some bacon and what more
[2:24:53] and after a while it hit her i'm healed
[2:24:56] stomach trouble's gone
[2:24:58] her sister that was in the prayer line
[2:25:00] was right down to one of her
[2:25:01] friends there right down the road from
[2:25:03] her so she got up and she run down there
[2:25:04] to go tell her the good news
[2:25:06] and there that woman was shaking the bed
[2:25:08] sheets looking for that cancer that had
[2:25:09] fallen
[2:25:10] offer the night before listen to brother
[2:25:12] brahm's words and i'm closing
[2:25:14] he said the angels of the lord was
[2:25:17] passing through that neighborhood
[2:25:20] with healing and when he passed through
[2:25:23] that neighborhood with healing
[2:25:25] both of them received their healing when
[2:25:28] the angel of the lord passed through the
[2:25:29] neighborhood he said the time has
[2:25:31] arrived
[2:25:32] for us to recognize who's in our city
[2:25:34] today
[2:25:35] it's the angel of god
[2:25:39] one thing i hope we understand and we're
[2:25:41] never gonna fully comprehend this but
[2:25:43] one thing i hope we understand before we
[2:25:44] go out of here
[2:25:46] is that god set you up with everything
[2:25:48] you'll ever have need of to get ready to
[2:25:49] get out of this place
[2:25:52] we just don't tap in to the resources
[2:25:55] that is available to us
[2:25:58] our faith either lacks or our our heart
[2:26:00] lacks in some area
[2:26:02] we sell ourselves short when are we ever
[2:26:04] going to come to the place to stop here
[2:26:06] and preaching like what i'm preaching
[2:26:07] tonight
[2:26:08] and saying the good things about the
[2:26:09] bride that i've said about you tonight
[2:26:11] when are we going to come to the place
[2:26:12] to stop sitting there and beating the
[2:26:13] time out of ourselves
[2:26:15] and start opening our heart and saying
[2:26:16] you know what that's what jesus said
[2:26:18] about me
[2:26:21] i'm asking you a question that's right
[2:26:23] when are we going to come to the hour to
[2:26:24] where we settle in our heart
[2:26:26] i am a child of god i'm as sinless as he
[2:26:30] is sinless
[2:26:31] i'm as righteous as he is righteous
[2:26:35] i'm a son and a daughter of god
[2:26:38] amen sometimes i believe that
[2:26:43] what we've done is we've put ourselves
[2:26:46] into a position
[2:26:49] to where that god can't move for us
[2:26:52] because we base his moving his moving
[2:26:55] rather
[2:26:56] upon our worthiness and our good
[2:26:58] behavior
[2:27:00] now listen to me we're going to quit god
[2:27:03] ain't looking to see whether you've been
[2:27:04] a good boy this week
[2:27:06] or a good girl this week or you listen
[2:27:08] to so many tapes or you read so many
[2:27:10] books
[2:27:12] tapes we don't even some of these young
[2:27:13] people don't know what a tape is amen
[2:27:16] ipad tape scotch tape what are you
[2:27:18] talking about
[2:27:21] i was i was preaching here the other day
[2:27:23] and there was a young girl sitting in
[2:27:24] there and i said
[2:27:24] i might let you know everything's
[2:27:26] electronic and i said opening a book i
[2:27:28] said you know them things with papers
[2:27:30] the mother come up after church she said
[2:27:31] we go to the library every day
[2:27:33] [Laughter]
[2:27:35] oops
[2:27:39] but when are we going to come to the
[2:27:40] place to where we just take a step back
[2:27:41] and say god
[2:27:43] before i was even born you created this
[2:27:46] community
[2:27:48] to take care of me before i had a chance
[2:27:51] to be a sinner
[2:27:52] not a saint now but before i had a
[2:27:54] chance to be a sinner
[2:27:56] god created this angelic community for
[2:27:58] me
[2:27:59] it goes to prove it's not about your
[2:28:01] merits it's not about how good you are
[2:28:05] but for the grace of god there go i
[2:28:08] thank you yeah when your heart desires
[2:28:13] to know
[2:28:14] thank you jesus it creates activity
[2:28:20] if you want to know it creates activity
[2:28:23] but you got to really want it friend
[2:28:26] listen
[2:28:27] some of you may not know me from adam
[2:28:28] but i'm going to tell you something
[2:28:30] this june i celebrate 30 years preaching
[2:28:33] the gospel
[2:28:34] imagine that y'all got food and
[2:28:36] refrigerator older than that somehow you
[2:28:37] know
[2:28:39] i'm 44 years old but i started when i
[2:28:41] was 14.
[2:28:42] i celebrate 30 years this summer i've
[2:28:45] been around the world i've preached to
[2:28:46] thousands of people i've preached all
[2:28:48] over the world
[2:28:50] i want to tell you something more and
[2:28:52] more you know what i find
[2:28:54] i find people that are a bunch of church
[2:28:55] members
[2:28:57] satisfied with a quiet kitchen
[2:29:00] and a few crackers at the table why
[2:29:03] should i settle for that
[2:29:05] when there's been a whole seven-course
[2:29:07] meal
[2:29:09] spread before me
[2:29:13] why should i settle for saltines
[2:29:18] why should i settle for the
[2:29:20] hand-me-downs
[2:29:22] like that little lady when she said but
[2:29:24] the dogs get the crumbs
[2:29:26] do you realize that one reason jesus
[2:29:29] blessed her
[2:29:31] he called her a dog right
[2:29:34] but you look what she did she didn't say
[2:29:37] oh yes i'm a dog
[2:29:38] no she humbled herself even littler than
[2:29:41] that you know the real translation
[2:29:43] she said even the little dogs
[2:29:46] eat from the master's table jesus called
[2:29:49] her a dog and she humbled herself even
[2:29:50] lower than that
[2:29:52] she didn't call herself a full-grown dog
[2:29:55] she said but lord even the little dogs
[2:29:58] i'm trying to tell you something brother
[2:30:00] if we just come to him and say lord i
[2:30:01] have a need
[2:30:03] i have a desire i want to know what's
[2:30:05] truth i want to know what's right
[2:30:08] it'll create activity and everything you
[2:30:11] have need of god has already provided it
[2:30:13] you just have to ask for it stand with
[2:30:16] me
[2:30:20] come on musicians let's sing tonight
[2:30:26] now you might say well brother ben where
[2:30:28] do i fit in with all of this well
[2:30:30] it's quite simple actually
[2:30:34] the real truth of the matter is only you
[2:30:36] know that answer
[2:30:39] yeah i could come up here and read a
[2:30:40] bunch of text and i could read a bunch
[2:30:41] of scriptures and quotes and i could
[2:30:43] generalize for you where you might
[2:30:45] belong but only you know your real place
[2:30:48] in all of this
[2:30:50] that's the reason why that the holy
[2:30:53] ghost did not want us to be
[2:30:57] almost kind of y'all know what a rut is
[2:31:02] you know the holy ghost didn't want us
[2:31:04] to get stuck in a rut
[2:31:06] come to church read the bible hear the
[2:31:08] preaching go home
[2:31:10] that's not why this has all been created
[2:31:12] for us
[2:31:14] god wanted us to have a fervent heart
[2:31:18] you know that word fervent what it means
[2:31:19] when the bible talked in acts 18
[2:31:21] about apollos that said he had a furby
[2:31:23] was fervent in spirit
[2:31:24] that means he come to the boiling point
[2:31:27] if you know anything about cooking at
[2:31:29] all some of you sisters maybe your
[2:31:30] brothers in here like to cook
[2:31:32] you get that pot on the stove and it
[2:31:34] hits 212 degrees
[2:31:37] the molecules in that water begin to
[2:31:40] respond
[2:31:41] to the heat that's coming below it they
[2:31:44] respond as a reaction to the action
[2:31:48] god wants us to be fervent
[2:31:51] meaning that when when we pray or we
[2:31:53] worship or whatever we do
[2:31:56] we're doing it because we're being
[2:31:57] stirred by the holy spirit
[2:31:59] we're passionate about it we desire it
[2:32:02] we long
[2:32:03] for it how long has it been since some
[2:32:06] of you wanted it
[2:32:07] how long has it been since some of you
[2:32:09] desired it with all of your heart
[2:32:11] there might be just one of you in this
[2:32:13] building tonight but if you look inside
[2:32:15] yourself
[2:32:16] maybe you've lost that fervency maybe
[2:32:19] you need that back
[2:32:20] okay call for the angels of the lord i
[2:32:23] want that fervent heart i want that
[2:32:25] fervent desire
[2:32:26] i want that fervent spirit maybe you're
[2:32:29] battling a sickness in your body
[2:32:31] maybe your home is split in half maybe
[2:32:33] you've got all kinds of things
[2:32:34] in your history your past you can't get
