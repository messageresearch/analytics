tonight being a prayer meeting service may you attend to them in the name of Jesus Christ so that when next we come around it will be testimonies to your glory father we commit a little word that will be shared to tonight maybe you speaking to your people may you make a difference tonight so that when we go back home we will say like cleop pass and his friend that did not our heart B within us as you spoke with us along the way let this be our testimony in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen glad to be in your midst again tonight um let's turn the Bibles to the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 verse 13 and 14 The Book of Genesis Chapter 18 vers 13 and 14 I'll start reading and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall lie of a shorty be a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his holy word you can please be seated once again you are welcome to the house of the Lord um it's a great thing to be in God's presence you know the prophet told us there's no better place to be than in the presence of the Lord you know and when you respond to the word of God God is obligated to you amen so tonight we are looking at the Salmon titled the God of all possibilities the God of all possibilities we can see even in where we have read God himself Affirmed that is anything too hard for the Lord and we know that the answer is no yes there is nothing too hard for the Lord to do too so if you consider your situation maybe your own is very special let me tell you tonight that God Specializes in those special cases amen hallelujah and he's ready to do them amen praise the Lord right I have a little quote I want to read um then Jesus came and called 6423 paragraph 19 he said all things are possible to them that can believe yes are we together am you the ball is now in your court if you can't believe then you can have what you desire said that is his word but imposs but Impossibles are made manifested when God is taken at his word yes sir when God is taken at his word the impossibilities are made manifest amen When God says it will be then you take that word and watch what The Impossibles happen it certainly will Hallelujah so the condition for us to make things that seems impossible to become possible is to take God at his word am that means we bring that word do written in the Bible look historical or some story if we can bring them back to present tense then the god of the presence or present will do the same thing amen we should know how to bring God to the present tense amen that's what God wants amen where we have just read we all know the story of Abraham God promised him you know of God's Own Accord nothing to do with Abraham but God promised him and then after 25 years God came down I think on the 24th year and then like we read three people came and appeared to Abraham and then I Believe by Revelation he must have seen them and knew that they were not ordinary men you know and he invited them inside come in have something before you continue your journey Hallelujah am and we found out according to the prophet that something was happening in the tent of Abraham just before that visitation that perhaps Sister Sarah maybe she had some news from Sodom how Mrs lot you know getting I mean getting things done properly having the worst of the world and no doubt Sarah must have been scolding Father Abraham that look why will you allow your boy even the nephew you know to make the First Choice you should have the right of first refuser you know you don't know your right you don't know what to do we know when things like that start happening maybe God is about to move Hallelujah so Believers you must be sensitive amen if you want to bring God to the present we must be sensitive to the word amen we must do what it says we should do amen enough of giving excuses if we want to give excuses there'll be a lot of them to give but God is not in the business of giving excuses hallelujah amen and so when the situation was happening in the house Abraham told us that Abraham he just took his seat and went to sit under the tree you know to change the atmosphere because when God wants to perform Miracles the atmosphere has got to be right amen amen amen you know God cannot operate where doubt fears or Sorrows arise he cannot move in such atmosphere the atmosphere must be correct am Hallelujah am and so Abraham moved out and then sitting there those three men came the prophet told us that God just said we are going to visit my son and then so he blow up one body for this for that three bodies all of them step in and they showed up and when they showed up when Abraham saw them he did not say my Lord because he had Revelation if he is today he will be a believer of one God hallelujah he will believe that Jesus Christ I mean Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new in sure I'm saying that will be in this church tonight if it's around this area because he believe only one God amen amen and he said my Lord coming and of course they came in and then he prepared gave them food did everything he had to do and God himself ate you know and after that he said where is Sarah your wife you know and then we didn't read that Abraham did any introduction Hallelujah yeah you know there was no Bible verse that told us that Abraham introduced members of his family to them but this man he knew Abraham's wife yes amen that's right hallelujah amen and so he said where is Sarah your wife and he told him in the tent behind you she's right there and he said well your wife will have a son you knowah told us about the visitation of the angel that do visit him he said you know he used to hear the voice since he was a little boy and so when that angel was in the room and then he saw a light and the light was getting brighter and bright there somebody came in from that light and then he was afraid he was what what is this am I seeing a vision is this a reality then the person said do not be afraid then he realized it's the same voice he has been hearing since he was a child Hallelujah so I have no doubt that when Elohim spoke Abraham was like oh this was the voice that called me yeah brethren we shall know him am you know when we get over there that will never be a stranger because God has interacted with you when you come in contact with him you will know him there is no doubt you I mean you will surely know him because something is already there that will make you remember him Hallelujah and so when he said Sarah shall have a child Bible told us that Sarah laughed within our that ah is this even possible I'm already an old woman 90 or 89 years old at that time and my husband already Works old there's no more desire everything and everything we are talking tonight about the God of all possibilities it does not matter what the situation is as long as go God plac that desire in your heart that it will be done Brethren it shall be done you are going to testify yes you just got to take God at his word yes that's a condition we saw tonight he said if a Believer takes God at his word then God will make the word come to pass amen that's right and so he gave that he said I will do it oh Sarah why did you li ah and she denied you know we know the story that because Sarah called God a liar God could have killed that yes because God is not a liar but God has included her in the promise and so without Sarah the promise cannot come to pass right Brethren God has concluded our Salvation in him without us we they are not complete amen is written in the book of Hebrew 11 that God having made something better for you and me such that all those Heroes of Faith without you and me they can never be complete so Brethren they are waiting for you they waiting for me they waiting for all of us hallelujah it is something God has done for youen amen and so Sarah without her the child cannot come even though God can produce somebody else but God made promise to Sarah and Abraham and God is not a liar not a man not a son of man he cannot lie he cannot even take his word back amen hallelujah even if the conditions are good for him to take it back he will not take it backen because he an infinite God Amen he can never make a mistake the prophet said God's first decision is always the right decision there is no plan B hallelujah amen so Brethren let's trust him yes so he told them that anyway Sarah you laughed and he asked them is anything too hard for God to do and tonight I'm asking you is anything too hard for God to do you might think your situation is different but Bren even in that different situation God is able to do it Hallelujah and my believe Genesis 21 God delivered that promise to them he delivered it because Sarah had a son yes and she said people will not laugh with me me 90 years carrying my first baby and today we can still celebrate them they are still present today that promise is still alive today you know we have read it and we are living in it Brethren if you think it's maybe some story made that was an experience I think I've shared it with BR one that was the time we went to Jerusalem so uh during our trip we had to cross to Jordan so and then there a border crossing you know you have to do all the passport and stuff so we have um some number of people among them from Nigeria we have a a pastor called Pastor Elijah he's darker than me in complexion but as soon as he go to that border crossing and then they ask for his passport and he give them passport they looked Elijah the people say Elijah T me you know Elijah Was Elijah the tach by they say Elijah TB I'm looking at a fully black man and you're calling Elijah te Hallelujah do you know what they did they took his passport his luggages they apologized to him forever delaying him and they took him across the crossing immediately without checks without they say it's Elijah the teach me and these are unbelievers so if you think that Bible story is not true Brethren you are joking they took it or they've taken it as life and they holding to those promises without fail and that's the way you should hold God's promises because God can never fail how can they see a black man from Nigeria and call him Elijah the teacher do you think they are making mistakes no they are still respecting that Elijah Prophet that's what they are still doing even though there there are people that will say they are just ordinary people but for them all God's promise is true amen nothing changes it Believers that's the way we should hold the word every promise we see in that Bible let's is a possibility hallelujah it's not just a writer it's not just a story no it's not just some good story it is what God promised to do in your life Hallelujah let's see that way and you know if out of all the millions of promises in this Bible God can lead your heart to believe one amen don't disappoint God because God wants to bring it to pass Hallelujah let's move on the time runs so fast I read them the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people paragraph 30 he say and Abraham being 75 years old and Sarah 65 years old 40 50 60 25 years P menop lived with her since she was a young lady they were married and they were not F and God told Abraham that you are going to have a child by Sarah The Impossibles and Abraham believed God no matter how impossible it seemed he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he believed God Brethren he took God at his word say after all you promised me Brethren let's say God you told me this let God himself bring you to pass I read it I think in Isaiah when a king his name was s he sent one of his servant rapaki go and arest those Israelites you know tell them I have dealt with many kings oh yeah which is true he was the king of Assyria it was the reigning King there I said tell them Judah come to me now bow to me I will give you a new land he made all those promises but don't follow ezekiah don't believe his God because his God cannot save him when ezekiah even heard all those stories he was shaken they wrote him a letter I took the letter to the temple say God this letter even though my name is there but this letter is written to you come and intervene and then they call onto Isaiah the prophet this is what has happened the mother has come to Bath there is no strength to deliver this king is true that he has destroyed many things is not just making a a false claim come and help us and God sent elij Isaiah say okay I have read the letter of senero and I'm going to respond because he said I cannot deliver oh Hallelujah let's put God in our business he told and said because that King said I cannot deliver therefore he first of all said tell him I know him and I know his house and I will put my hook in his nose that's what that's that was God's response to him because he he said God cannot deliver and God said I will show him and then God told the Israelites or the Judah people you don't even have to fight it is between me and that guy Breen let your matter be between God and the enemy you be The Spectator stand on the word and watch and you will see the glory of God hallelujah this is what we should do when God cares for you you don't need to bother again he said that son he said what we we often have sorrows and pain because we fail to take our burdens to God In Prayer what a friend we have in Jesus Oh Hallelujah so it said you people you will not have any fight in this matter it is me and him and then said you just watch and what did God do Bible said by the next morning when they woke up 185 ,000 people soldiers were dead when they woke up the ones that remain alive they saw that everybody was dead then what did the king do he ran Hallelujah he was challenging God he should have waited is it not but he ran and God said God has already said I know his house and I'm going to get him there and God went to his house took his two sons and they killed him Hallelujah that's the God will serve he the greatest General that never lost a battle he will not lose that b in your life Hallelujah the God of all possibilities that's the one we are serving tonight we moved again quickly in the sermon the seed is not here with the shock paragraph 76 said it had never been done in all ages but Mary believed God Amen Hallelujah yes we are not talking only about men all believers are included yes brother sister children adult everybody anyone who can take God at his word that promise will become a possibility she said behold the handmade of the Lord she believed the word how is she going to have it she knew that AGA had the baby by sex Desire with Abraham and Sarah had the baby by sex Desire with Abraham Children Of Promise the Bond woman and the free woman but here she is ask to believe our own case is different there is no man she remains a virgin there and yet Angel told her you are going to have a baby amen but what did she do Let It Be unto me according to your word hallelujah but here she is asked to believe that a cont that's a contribution to the faith that was in Abraham who believed in possibilities as long as God said it is so that makes it right am Hallelujah she didn't know what will happen how it's going to happen it has never happened before but it was written Isaiah 96 a virgin shall conceive amen you know people believe that she's a virgin you know when she goes into a husband's house you know that's the only thing that is logical you know nobody can imagine that I mean so they must have prepared all of them please my daughter be a virin do this get to your husband now say virgin maybe God can use you nobody had the premonition that the person will it is only the child that will dis her they did not have that idea they all just prepare but God has millions of ways of solving the single problem beyond our widest imagination Hallelujah but what did Mary do preach Aon Mary's Bel that's you know the under the same condition the same environment there was a priest right Zachariah I believe his name was angel came to him while he was in the temple doing the word of God your position does not matter why Jesus was on ground Pharisees they didn't believe him but the woman at the well a kind of AME woman she believed Hallelujah that no barrier you know and then Zariah he said what how can it be and Gabriel was shocked how can I tell you I introduced myself I'm Angel Gabriel I came from the presence of God and I told you what God Said and you have the audacity to disbelieve you know it surprised the angel because disbelief is not in their business yes and they has to say man for you to know you be remain dumb but here is Mary we don't even know our linage whether she was of the priesthood or not or maybe a levite we don't know but she told Gabriel Let It Be unto me according to your word Bren you tell God that tonight because God will bring his word to pass let's move forward hallelujah praise Lord I'm still reading testimony paragraph 27 it says sometimes God makes us do things that seems very dangerous and out of line how about Moses with that stick going down to take over Egypt and everything we find like that that God asked The Impossibles are we together see so that he does The Impossibles too that man will know that it is in it isn't him it is God doing it right when God say go and do something imposs look at Moses when Moses was 40 year old General he tried to do this thing he succeeded in killing only one Egyptian and upon it he ran are we together he ran he became a personal nonat in Egypt because it must not show his space because of killing one Egyptian and yet it was a military strategist and it was energetic 40 year old no problem but yet it was impossible but when it became 8 year old he has forgotten about military tactics he was now a shepherd with a Crooked Stick God said go and take over hallelujah amen our God he has us to do the impossible so that we can experience The Impossible when he says oh this nobody has done it before but it's in your mind to do it oh it's an impossibility God said believe it am because you are about to experience an impossibility in your life we are serving the God of all possibilities and did Moses achieved it or not he did he went with that Crooked Stick and went straight to Egypt and they couldn't even say why you not that person that ran away nobody there say that because he is now on God's Mission yes amen hallelujah when you are on God's Mission the enemy has got to Bow I'm not saying they will not try but they must fail amen that's right Hallelujah and then he got there he met James and jambers he defeated even though God did not tell him those people are going to show up but he remain calm you know be still and see the glory of God that's instruction when you have prayed you have put it before God there's no need to worry you know there's no need to do that just wait on him amen because he's always keeping all his appointments amen and he took those people with all those Miracles and sign out of that bondage into the promised land you know go what God commission Moses to do was to bring them and bring them onto the mountain and he did that he took them to to Worship the Lord despite all the other challenges let's move forward amen we are serving the God of all possibilities am now I wrote here in the Book of Esther just a little extract of what happened to modai we are talking about the God of all possibilities you know modai Bible told us it was of the Kindred of the Jews a slave so so to speak and then he raised a daughter an orphan Esther you know whose parent have died and then after what queen Vash did the Bible told us that Queen Vash was like the denomination when God called them they refuse they prefer their makeup and paints and all the other things to the word of God and God don't have time for that and so the king put her away that's B and then there was a program to get a new Queen for the King and then we are told that Esther she did not ask for anything extra only what a I believe the chamberling gave to her because because she believe that that chamberling understand the king better today we have another chamberling that was sent to get a bride for Christ we must stick to what he says hallelujah because he was commission that's right amen amen and so she obeyed everything and when the time of her appearance came she got the golden scepter she became the queen but the he wasn't happy whenever you make a progress expect opposition but God told you Victory is certain don't say oh because of opposition you will not make progress you must make progress opposition they are bound to arise but we will defeat them Hallelujah and as we defeat them we make more progress even in physical St they told us that the reward of success is more work amen you know when you make one success whatever takes you to that level cannot keep you there you've got to gain more strength to move forward and it is those trials that will strengthen you they prepare you for the higher Journey amen and so something happened there was a prime minister that was loved by the king you know whatever it was you always remember that the circle of Revival or the law of contrast once you see Good The Bad is following the moment you see Jesus that is a Judas you know is always like that they always in the wing you know ready to strike but you see their portion is always of defeat Hallelujah that's right check all through they are not bound to arrive and so that Aman he was beloved of the king and he was growing in rank until he became the second in command and then there was this lonely modai serving his God hallelujah amen you know it was always at the T at the gate checking watching out doing what he had to do just to help you because his daughter is in that Palace you know just trying to check for her and then Bible told us that one time some people tried to kill the king you heard about it he notified the King in his own name you know it was written down no problem you know the prophet told us sometimes that you may do something and you not get credit for it don't be angry oh don't say Pastor did not see me as long as God sees you when the time is right he will make the pastor to see you imagine if they had uh honored modai of course God will always have his way but God have an appointed time amen let's trust him yes don't say oh because they didn't recognize my work I will not do it again that is a lack of Revelation if you know who you are doing it for you will keep doing it because you know when he's ready to bless nobody can stop him yes praise the Lord hallelujah and so amen as he does when he's coming from King's meeting we pass through the gate and he always notice that this mod somebody is not always bowing down for me and then he made inquiries who was that guy they say oh he a mody of the Jews the slave a slave you know he felt like oh my God ordinary slave and the Bible said he felt that Modi was too little for him to deal with yes so do you know what he did he wanted to destroy entire Jews putting God again on the earth seat yes because God has promised to restore them amen after they have gone for 70 years God said we bring them back that's right now somebody wants to cross the line of the prophecy I don't know what God has promised you if the dev try to cross that line he will have to meet with God hallelujah because God will fulfill his promise so he tried to cross that line oh do you know what he did he got some big money that will impress the king and pay it into the king treasury you know oh have people do things something that will not benefit you you are even losing money you know when devil is at work you will know he the devil because hatred is in him you know you see to lose money you want to kill I mean I don't know I try to imagine it you are losing your money to kill people and he went to the king one morning and after he had made all the arrangement paid the money drafted a a kind of law you know he went to the king early morning he wanted to do that you know but while he was trying to do that that's also the god of modai who has everything already planned out Hallelujah you know sometimes you think he doesn't care about you oh your situation does he's seeing everything he has the appointed time for you God has already gone to the king he made the king that same overnight he made the king he took away the king sleep you know you can imagine the bed of the king must be so luxurious everything yet God took the sleep away and he couldn't sleep and he was counting the squares of the ceiling everything he can do and God must have told him that's not why you awake go to your library he got to the library he was looking what am I looking for God say you are looking for the book containing the record of the exploit of people in this Kingdom he took the book he began go said no go to page modai there's no I mean everything is timed Hallelujah so it go to page that contains Mod's activity and he saw mod certifi the king B and attempted assassination it was found to be true and the people were executed and the King's life was saved Hallelujah and he said he you people what have you done to that guy everybody look you know in the meeting we have done nothing you did nothing somebody that's protected My Life The King was still thinking while he was thinking somebody was at the court he said who was there they said am man oh good good that's the right person it's my right hand man he should know the right thing to do so they call in a man come what a man came to do was actually to get approval to execute modai brand you can you can go and read the book of Esther he came that early morning because he wanted modai done before noon so it came early morning to get that authorization to get him off then later he will deal with his people but God was already waiting Ameren God is waiting on your matter this is not the time to lose faith in a sermon beser of God the prophet said when you have done everything you should do and everything seems to be out of order he said that is when you should stand still because God is just waiting to see your faith am because God has sort everything out already you know it's not that God is just doing something now he has prean everything just waiting for things to fall in place at their time that's right is that perfect right Glory if you doubt go and read about your body system check how it works you know from your DNA coding everything written there and they manifest at their time and you become who you are it's not that God is just you know updating the data no from the day maybe that se gem is already encoded there amen that's how perfect the God is right so your matter is not complex for him that's right just have faith amen only believe all things are possible Right amen thank you Jesus that was his purpose that early morning but God had a different job for him he in his mind he thought he went there to do his own purpose but God took him there to do God's purpose Bible said nobody can resist the will of God not even Satan he will only do what God wants him to do that's all he can't do more when he tries to do more he will be corre he will be stopped he tried to do that in the life of job too he wanted to take his life you know but God said no that's not the agreement he can't go beyond his bounce even in your life praise the Lord amen and when he the king said who is there he say oh amen good good good good come in when he came in the king said one shall be done to the man in whom the king Delight to honor Bible said he thought in himself who will the king want to honor if not me oh God you know only him Bible say we should prefer one another but him he preferred only is the one and the another only him you know like the right today me myself and I and that talking about a man it's all about him and that's what the devil did don't forget why was the devil sent paring he wanted to be like the most I amen always Desiring whatever God has given them is not enough am man see what he wanted he said oh that's good it's only me let King's royal ro Crown is a OES and most noble Prince he should ride and be screaming don't leave it on to the man in whom the king Delight to honor he just want to be the king for one day Hallelujah in know Royal crown royal ro royal horse that was King for one day he just desired that and that's what is that is what killed Satan because I see him already dead we are just waiting for that time amen hallelujah amen and so the K said good excellent see that Hallelujah go and do that nothing must fail thank you Lord oh Hallelujah I don't know how sh pal how big it was but I imagine he will have done that job from that early morning to like late afternoon because I got home tired Hallelujah that is the way your enemies will be tired they will labor and labor in vain because God God's plan will surely manifest Hallelujah let them do more let them get more cancer let them do anything it's all F time because whatever God has planed that's the only thing that will manifest is the one that have the say so like they say he's the only one with the final say all other says are until God say his own hallelujah amen so always wait to hear from him because that's the final say amen and so that evening he got back home and he was you know tired one out and say so what happened now he has already built Gallo with Mod's name written on it you see human being he thought everything revolves around him he did not know that when once it gets to God's children you have to be careful right right that's right Hallelujah you know Bible said God he will make war with the amorites from generation to generation until they are destroyed because why they did not meet his children with food and drink but rather with cutlers and whatever and God took offense so you have to be careful for People Too Am you don't want God to be offended by them yes because you are you may not know but you are special to God amen amen so be careful try to forgive many people as much as you can because if you let God be on their case you will still be the one begging Hallelujah you know there's a principle in the scripture he said when your enemy is hungry do what give him he wants water give him he said by so doing you will P Co of fire on his head and in another place he said if God is dealing with your enemy I can't qu it well now don't rejoice pity him if you rejoice God will stop it because you are it's because you don't understand God's principle Hallelujah God wants you to be merciful judgment belongs to God he will do that it's not your hand vengeance is not for you you know God will do that he said vengeance is mine I will Revenge he will do it so leave god with his own business you do your own part be merciful do your part you know let them they are who they are if God gives them his holy ghost they may be better than you so that's what we pray for that God will open their eyes have mercy upon them we don't want more people in hell we want to take them from there to God's kingdom that's our purpose so we know if somebody falling we want to help them we want Kingdom of Satan to lose every new day you wake up Satan's kingdom must lose yes Hallelujah so amen he go back home tired one out and then they say what happened what happened said why this is what happened the same modai that we build this G for you know what I was doing I he will recall the moment he even fell you know because must have falling several times he's not used to that he's a big man now he has to be doing time crying job it's not easy he explained to them see what happened to me do you know what the wife told him yeah he said if Modi was of the stock of the Jews and you have began to fall before him he said you will follow you will not rise again the wife told him that I said why can't this boy was too late you know God was already on the move before they could finish that discussion Messengers from the King came to take him back to the banquet oh you know earlier he yesterday he was rejoicing I was the only one invited by you know to no other person just a banquet for king and the Prime Minister plus the queen you know exclusive oh my Hallelujah Exquisite you know those kind of grammar and then the next day it was already called that previous day the king got s Queen what do you need queena said nothing I just want to have another banquet with you and prime minister tomorrow and the King was I mean we'll be there you know so the tomorrow came after he has done what he did and they brought him and so after the meal in the evening the king asked again Queen Esther what do you want and it shall be granted to you to the half of the kingdom and queen said I don't even want much I just need my life can you imagine a whole Queen begging for her life in front of the king and the King was shocked who would like to kill my queen and then she pointed he say is this wicked am man ah and the King stood up from the market he was you know enraged that cannot be promoting this guy and then he wants to ruin my family and he went Bible say went into the garden while he was there God that has planned everything Brethren God is the God of all possibility amen am man was trying to beg quen on the bed you know he was just doing everything wrongly and then the king came back and said what is he trying to force the queen in the palace before the king could finish that statement Bible said they cover his face you know the way they do execution you know they have to cover the face and then because that time they must not allow the king to get too angry if the anger becomes so much things can happen and then somebody said there oh he has built a gallo and it's for mod they said go and hang him there you see once a plan for a child of God became his portion amen Hallelujah without Mod's intervention he did not even know all he did was they praying the pray so that nothing will happen they join in prayer and fasting that's all but all that God now did he did not know and then he was executed we are talking about the God of all possibilities look at you know the the Gap who modai was a slave to a prime minister until he felt that killing only Modi was too little and he had to kill the entire race and yet God brought him down yes I don't know what that problem you think you have how giant it is but I believe I God is taller than that I believe our God is greater than that and he still in the work of solving problems Hallelujah right that time is up you know look at um Jacob and Esau you know just a snipper from that one time God we know the promises God made to Jacob when he took the B right he ran over there and then he had um his trouble on the way after while God prospered him despite the trouble that lean gave to him you know changing the wages doing all the tricks and everything you know he now decided to return and he started returning as God called him but he got a message Brethren and what was the message his brother Esau was coming with 400 men I don't think we are talking about the God of all possibilities Esau was coming with he's not coming alone because he did not know how big Jacob has become but he was more than prepar 400 men because he has said that he's going to show this guy he has r him of his b right and also the blessing he wasn't telling the truth you know he sold that b right amen and he did not deserve the blessing right Bible said he make an only thing nonsense you know that's what he did you know he did not value that b right and Bible in the New Testament compared Esau with fornicators you know people don't value that their body is the temple of God he just throw it around you know because it's something God made he wanted to dwell in that Temple but you thr it around for every D Canary and Bible compare them with Esau he did not know the value of the B right now he wanted to fight for it that is always a God In the Mix Hallelujah but you see we got to take God at his word and that's the side we are always lacking not that God is unable to do his work but are we prepared are we in in Readiness may the Lord help us and so when the news got to Jacob that your brother is on the way he knew that all the tricks in this word they can't work he still triy them Bible say he divided all the things he had in droves you know he this a set imagine you know if this guy can fall for just a plate of porridge if I give him a number of sheep and goat and RAM he should fall but soon you realize it's not going to work too but he sent it anyway Bible said later when he had sent his wife and children for that he himself stayed he realized look this is more than food and drink we got to because now now if it's only him he may still try to place my you know but now wife children everything no no no no no and Bible say stay back and a man wrestle with him yes you know Bible said and the wrestling was probably from the night till almost the day break and the man wrestling with him was say this man let me go said no I will not let you go Jacob was desperate amen you know the prophet said when we are thirsty or desperate enough whatever we have we ask we will get of time we just Pastor say let's pray you pray you know let's pray once in a while if you are desperate you know you ask what to pray for when Jacob he realized if this man goes I'm dead say you are not going unless you bless me and the man asking what is your name he said I am Jacob the prophet said he made open confession Jacob means suppan say this is who I am and the man told him you'll no longer be that now I've changed your name amen you are now Israel amen you are now a prince with God and Men you have wrestled with God and you have even prevailed and Bible say touched him at the H of his time and he started limping no that's people they don't want to receive the Holy Ghost because they don't want to F the spiritual pool so that people not laugh at them you are not ready if with God and the same when God touch your life you can't be the same person people will see they say are you now Sister yes I am are you a pastor they will call you Pastor true when you are walking on the road there's nothing you are not putting any um what's it called toga or some Mark they say Pastor why are you you know it happened to me inos know I was driving coming home from work so we got to an intersection in my mind I said I'm not going to stop for anybody because I got there first that's what I said it in my mind when we go there another vehicle was coming and I do not not wind down you a pastor what and I've never seen him in my life I don't know him I look at the vehicle number he say you a pastor you didn't give me chance you a pastor so say God have mercy on me because the mark of Christ is on you you may not know it but they see it hallelujah hallelujah and so that angel touched him by the time and then when he got by the time the sun rose on on he was limping and the children were like what happened to Daddy he said things are different now Hallelujah I'm not the man I used to be for you to know by the time Esau got to him Esau that has merary soldiers ready Bible say he was crying oh my brother oh I missed him that is what God can do Hallelujah you know I I encourage you to go and read that place somebody that was coming with 400 men to destroy he saw him he was weeping oh my brother I've missed you I see your face like the face ofel let me it was just appealing and appealing I know that is what go that's the way God wanted to solve the problem no blood shed God just changed the mind he offered to escort Jacob doesn't want to take his love too far said if you go and escort now your mind change said I don't want said oh let me leave my men no I don't need your goods I'm richer than you take them God did something for Jacob amen he wasn't the man he used to be because he's serving the God of all possibility nothing God can solve problem any way he wants it is not your duty to tell God how the problem should be solved sometimes you try to do that you know you figure out the ways all you have to do cast your body to God in prayer and leave it there no need to tell God how it should be done take God at his word yes Hallelujah amen let me read this final quote work is Faith expressed 311 then the works that the holy spirit is doing today by these Visions never failing promises never failing all the apostolic signs promised in the Bible of Malachi 4 and oh of the Revelation 10:7 all of that is being fulfilled and proved by scientific and every other way and I haven't told you the truth and if I haven't told you the truth these things will not happen but if I have told you the truth the bear record that I have told you the truth in still the same yesterday today and forever amen and the man manifestation of his spirit is catching away a bride amen let that Faith Revelation fall into your heart right now let's rise up let's talk to go let that Revelation be in your heart and for you nothing shall be impossible amen talk to God this moment talk to just talk to him in your own way whatever you have considered impossible up to this moment tell tell it to God because he's ready to
