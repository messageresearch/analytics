[40:51] observe to do according to all the Lord
[40:54] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[40:57] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[41:01] the left that thou May Prosper
[41:05] wheresoever thou goeth this book of the
[41:08] Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth
[41:12] but thou shall meditate there meditate
[41:15] therein day and night and thou that thou
[41:18] May observe to do according to all that
[41:21] is written there in for then thou shall
[41:24] make thy way prosperous
[41:27] and then thou shall have good success
[41:31] Psalm chapter one we read the first
[41:34] three
[41:36] verses blessed is the man that walketh
[41:39] not in the counsel of the
[41:42] angol n standeth in the way of Sinners n
[41:47] sth in the seat of the scel now I I
[41:51] highlighted and and underline these
[41:54] three things and as I was reading the
[41:56] this time meditating on it what what's
[41:59] stuck in my mind is that when we wake up
[42:02] in the morning is the three things that
[42:04] we do as we go about we are either
[42:07] sitting standing or
[42:12] walking praise the
[42:14] Lord and then as I'm meditating on the
[42:17] psalm I'm thinking I'm talking to myself
[42:19] I says well why doing any of these three
[42:23] what is expected of us is that but but
[42:28] his Delight is in the lord of the Lord
[42:32] amen whether we are walking or we are
[42:35] sitting or we are standing our
[42:39] Delight praise the Lord must be in God's
[42:43] word and in his word in the Lord we must
[42:47] meditate day and
[42:51] night and he that man that blessed man
[42:54] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[42:56] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[42:59] his fruit in his season his Leaf also
[43:02] shall not weather and whatsoever he does
[43:06] shall prosper now so you see that uh our
[43:10] two scripture reading how to do with
[43:12] prosperity so we want to talk tonight on
[43:15] Joseph the son of prosperity the Lord
[43:17] bless you you may have your
[43:20] seat and we ask that the Lord will add
[43:23] blessing to the reading of his word
[43:25] praise the
[43:26] Lord now so just like I said we will
[43:28] just go I should have pretty much
[43:31] everything up here tonight I want to do
[43:33] a little bit of a Bible studies we as we
[43:35] look in this subject tonight and uh it's
[43:38] all coming from the place of uh T John I
[43:42] desired above everything that you will
[43:44] prosper in health even as your soul
[43:47] Prosper so for the the period of time we
[43:50] talk on the on the place of Health we
[43:53] also want to talk on the place of the
[43:56] prosperity of the soul but I want us to
[43:59] I want you to follow me in a little bit
[44:01] so uh uh uh you will you'll be able to
[44:04] grab uh my line of thought here praise
[44:08] the
[44:09] Lord I will start here by reading uh uh
[44:12] this quote from the message
[44:17] why and father God it was said one
[44:23] time that your children was coming from
[44:26] bage going into the promised land of
[44:30] good health
[44:33] Prosperity praise the Lord it is our
[44:37] promise they were going to a physical
[44:40] land of good health and prosperity we
[44:44] are coming to a spiritual land of good
[44:47] health and prosperity praise the Lord
[44:49] amen your children were
[44:52] going coming out coming from bondage and
[44:55] going into the the promised land of good
[44:58] health prosperity and the Red Sea got in
[45:03] their
[45:04] way praise the Lord God looked down
[45:07] through the pillow of fire and frowned
[45:10] upon the Red Sea because it was holding
[45:14] his people from the
[45:16] blessing praise the Lord amen just as
[45:21] the r was in their way we could have
[45:25] belief system in our
[45:27] way we could
[45:30] have wrong Concept in our
[45:34] way praise the Lord amen it does not
[45:39] necessarily have to be seen in a way of
[45:42] living wrong or doing wrong sometimes
[45:45] it's just a
[45:47] misunderstanding it's just not
[45:50] understanding set principle of God a man
[45:54] can be living completely free from
[45:57] wrong but he he may yet not enter into
[46:01] certain blessings of God when he have
[46:04] not grab the concept of
[46:08] it praise the Lord one of the common one
[46:12] is that uh the Bible talks and encourage
[46:15] us to pay our tithes and offering and
[46:18] the scripture says God will open the
[46:20] windows of Heaven now that concept has
[46:24] has gone to the place where people think
[46:27] you know God will open the windows of
[46:28] heaven and it will just fall on your lap
[46:31] no you pay your ties and offering God
[46:33] open a window of opportunity but you
[46:36] have to step
[46:40] in Praise the Lord you have to step
[46:45] in are we together
[46:48] yes you have to step in the same thing
[46:51] here with this promise he told them that
[46:54] he gave them the
[46:55] land but he also told them where the saw
[46:59] of your
[47:00] feet will step so you have to step in
[47:04] right and that is the thing with healing
[47:07] that is the thing with with prosperity
[47:09] in every way you have to step into it
[47:13] right you have to fight for
[47:16] it are we
[47:18] together praise the Lord so the pillar
[47:21] of fire front upon the Red Sea because
[47:24] it was holding his people from the
[47:26] blessing
[47:27] and the the sea got scared and rode back
[47:30] and Israel went over to the promised
[47:33] land praise the
[47:35] Lord I will take another quote here and

[50:07] talking about Prosperity we want to go
[50:10] in a place of looking at uh uh at this
[50:14] let's just read this few scripture maybe
[50:16] it will help year is when God will speak
[50:19] to Moses the first time uh the people
[50:21] needed
[50:22] water and uh God will allow Moses to
[50:25] bring a provision here and the Lord said
[50:28] unto Moses go on before the people and
[50:31] take with thee of the ERS of Israel and
[50:35] thy rod where with thou smut the river
[50:40] take it uh take in thy hand and go
[50:44] behold I will stand before thee there
[50:48] upon the
[50:50] rock in
[50:52] harb and thou shalt smot The Rock he
[50:57] says I will be standing on the
[50:59] Rock praise the
[51:01] Lord amen I will go before Thee I will
[51:05] be standing on the
[51:07] Rock and thou shall smart The Rock are
[51:11] we
[51:12] together and there shall come water out
[51:15] of it that the people may drink and
[51:18] Moses did so in the sight of all Israel
[51:23] let's go together now in numbers here
[51:25] this will be the second time the people
[51:28] will be needing water let's see what
[51:31] happened and the Lord speak unto Moses
[51:34] saying take the rod and GA and and
[51:38] gather thou the assembly together thou
[51:41] and Aaron thy brother and speak yeah
[51:46] unto the rock Before Their
[51:49] Eyes praise the Lord the first time he
[51:53] was to smack the rock yeah this time
[51:58] he's to speak to the Rock praise the
[52:02] Lord this take away all our Pentecostal
[52:06] emotion yeah of beating the bench
[52:09] beating the Des don't Smack The Rock
[52:11] just
[52:12] speak yes
[52:14] sir when we were back there in
[52:17] denomination we could smack the rock hit
[52:20] the wall Jesus you got to do it for
[52:24] me right we are on the other side now
[52:27] just speak to the
[52:29] Rock and for you to speak to the rock
[52:32] you need to come on speaking terms yes
[52:38] sir are we
[52:40] together praise the
[52:43] Lord and speak yet unto the rock before
[52:47] their eyes and it shall gave forth his
[52:52] water wash there his water it's a person
[52:55] yeah
[52:57] and thou shall bring
[52:59] forth to them water out of the rock so
[53:03] thou shall gave the
[53:05] congregation and their Beast drank and
[53:09] Moses took the rod before took the rod
[53:13] from before the Lord as he commanded him
[53:16] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[53:17] congregation together before the Rock
[53:20] and he said unto them yeah now Ye Ye
[53:25] Rebels
[53:27] must we fetch water fesh you water out
[53:30] of this
[53:31] rock this is something that I want us to
[53:34] to pay attention to
[53:36] here before this between the first time
[53:40] that Moses smacked The Rock and this
[53:44] time that he should speak to the Rock
[53:47] the people have frustrated
[53:52] Moses they have complained they every
[53:56] and and and at this time you can tell
[53:59] from this from this conversation right
[54:03] here that the the attitude of the people
[54:07] had got the best of
[54:11] Moses are we together amen the attitude
[54:16] of the people have got the best of Moses
[54:19] you can you will soon see that Moses in
[54:23] carrying out the instruction of the Lord
[54:26] because of the attitude of the people he
[54:29] got nervous and he missed the
[54:38] instruction verse 21 and Moses lift up
[54:42] his hands and with the rod he smoked the
[54:45] rod
[54:47] twice so it's a it's a direct reflection
[54:50] that with this statement yeah Rebels
[54:53] must we fetch water out of this rock it
[54:57] tells that the attitude of the people
[55:01] got a hold of him that he missed the
[55:05] instruction of God the instruction was
[55:08] to speak to the rock it was easy for him
[55:10] to Smart The Rock because he did it once
[55:15] right but that was not what God was
[55:18] requiring him to do here God was
[55:20] requiring him to speak to the
[55:24] Rock many times times when we are
[55:29] overtaken anxious or scared una feared
[55:33] and when we are
[55:35] overtaken it it it always put us in a
[55:38] compromising
[55:40] position that many times we don't carry
[55:43] out God's word the way he requir us
[55:49] to are we
[55:51] together
[55:53] amen but what I want you to also noticed
[55:56] in this year is
[55:59] that he lift up his hands with The Rock
[56:03] he smut The Rock twice and the water
[56:07] came out
[56:11] abundantly he did not spoke to the Rock
[56:15] and God did not say because you never
[56:17] spoke I'm not giving
[56:24] water we are serving a mighty God we are
[56:29] serving a God that knows all our
[56:33] emotion he knows Our
[56:41] intention you call my people
[56:44] rebel I'm I'm not going to bring water
[56:46] who are you who you think you
[56:49] are so you see the thing that is that
[56:52] Moses is caught up in his element but
[56:55] yet God God is also concerned for his
[57:00] people praise the Lord he's not going to
[57:03] allow Moses weakness to handle the
[57:07] people from their
[57:12] need are we
[57:15] together the water came out
[57:19] abundantly abundantly amen and the
[57:23] congregation drank and their Beast also
[57:27] praise the Lord I believe they had
[57:29] enough water to drink to take bath to
[57:31] wash whatever they wanted to do because
[57:33] it was
[57:35] abundant abundantly praise the Lord are
[57:38] we
[57:39] together Paul under the inspiration of
[57:42] the holy spirit will bring us to this
[57:45] place of The Rock he will say moreover
[57:48] Brethren I would not that you that that
[57:51] you should be ignorant how that our
[57:54] fathers were under the Clown I put that
[57:57] in red to be able to grab your mind
[58:00] tonight our fathers were under the
[58:07] cloud and all passed through the
[58:11] sea and were all baptized unto Moses in
[58:16] the
[58:17] cloud and in the
[58:20] sea this this I've always I've always
[58:25] uh you
[58:27] know I enjoy reading this because I
[58:30] think about this let let me just let me
[58:32] just uh uh uh have have us to think yet
[58:35] a little
[58:37] bit they were all baptized unto Moses in
[58:40] the cloud in in the seat but what I want
[58:43] you to pay attention to here he says how
[58:46] our fathers were under the cloud that
[58:49] cloud they were under was the presence
[58:53] of
[58:54] God Amen it was the pillow of
[58:58] cloud praise the Lord so you see here in
[59:02] in verse two they are baptism because if
[59:06] if if you look at he's he's he's
[59:08] comparing the the Israelite baptism
[59:10] bringing it bringing it to our to to us
[59:13] now what what you will realize here is
[59:16] that you can take brother brandham
[59:18] statement right in here where he says
[59:20] you can go down in the water as a dry
[59:24] Sinner and come out
[59:27] as a wet
[59:28] sinner because with this baptism the
[59:31] people that were baptized here water
[59:33] never touched them
[59:36] right the people that got the water on
[59:39] them were the
[59:45] Egyptians does it you grab the
[59:48] picture when Israel were being baptized
[59:51] here the sea
[59:53] parted the sea parted and went like a
[59:56] tonet and they passed through water
[59:59] never touched them but yet Paul is
[1:00:03] saying they were
[1:00:05] baptized unto Moses in the cloud that's
[1:00:09] the first thing
[1:00:12] right that's what makes it a baptism
[1:00:15] because the cloud was the presence of
[1:00:18] God
[1:00:20] right the sea does not make it much a
[1:00:23] baptism because the water never touched
[1:00:25] them
[1:00:27] the people that really got immersed were
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:31] Egyptians they went up they came down
[1:00:33] they went up they came down they went up
[1:00:36] but the water did not save them right so
[1:00:39] water does not Save
[1:00:41] Right is coming under the cloud they
[1:00:47] save praise the lord it's just a Bible
[1:00:50] steud tonight okay it's coming under the
[1:00:53] cloud that makes the
[1:00:54] difference
[1:00:56] verse three and and and they all eat the
[1:01:00] same spiritual meat now you realize he's
[1:01:03] making a lot of spiritual here when they
[1:01:06] were
[1:01:08] eating it was a physical
[1:01:12] meat praise the Lord when God pulled
[1:01:15] down meat in the wilderness it was
[1:01:18] physical the when they gather it right
[1:01:20] so many of them were eating but never
[1:01:23] understood the significance of what they
[1:01:26] were eating Paul year on
[1:01:31] the the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:01:34] is making us to know that even though it
[1:01:37] was literal for them just like when God
[1:01:40] told every house to take a lamb and slay
[1:01:42] the lamb they had to take kill the lamb
[1:01:46] physically roast it they have to sit
[1:01:49] down and eat it but it had a spiritual
[1:01:54] significance are we
[1:01:56] together and and did
[1:01:59] all drink from the same spiritual uh you
[1:02:03] know drink the S spiritual drink for
[1:02:05] they drank of their spiritual rock that
[1:02:10] followed
[1:02:11] him spiritual rock that followed
[1:02:15] him and that rock was
[1:02:18] Christ praise the Lord if you look in
[1:02:22] the in the in the commission of Jesus to
[1:02:25] his disp disciple he said this sign
[1:02:29] shall
[1:02:31] follow
[1:02:33] them these sign shall follow
[1:02:38] them praise the
[1:02:42] Lord the spiritual rock that followed
[1:02:45] them that's the reason why brother Brown
[1:02:47] makes the the the the emphasis on the
[1:02:50] the Believers do not go after signs
[1:02:53] signs come after the believer right
[1:02:55] because the rock followed him they did
[1:02:57] not follow the
[1:03:03] rock are we together praise the
[1:03:13] Lord and
[1:03:16] Jesus who
[1:03:19] also make a statement here he says uh
[1:03:22] the scripture says John will said in the
[1:03:25] last the uh that great day of the feast
[1:03:29] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:03:34] T the same experience those people were
[1:03:36] having in the wilderness that Moses had
[1:03:39] to Smite The
[1:03:41] Rock If any man
[1:03:44] thirst let him come unto me and
[1:03:48] drink praise the
[1:03:50] Lord God told Moses I will go before you
[1:03:54] and I will stand on the rock
[1:03:56] Smack The
[1:03:58] Rock and it will give out water praise
[1:04:02] the Lord now that rock was now in
[1:04:06] assisting element
[1:04:08] body praise the Lord Paul had just told
[1:04:12] us that Jesus was is the rock now The
[1:04:15] Rock was in assisting element body he's
[1:04:18] standing before us and he's saying if
[1:04:20] any man thirst come unto
[1:04:24] me amen let him come to me and
[1:04:29] drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:04:33] scripture have said out of his belly
[1:04:37] shall flow rivers of Living
[1:04:43] Water but this sorry yeah sorry I'm so
[1:04:47] sorry I'm so sorry but this speak he of
[1:04:52] the
[1:04:54] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:04:58] should receive now so Jesus is pointing
[1:05:02] to an experience after the
[1:05:05] atunement he's pointing to an experience
[1:05:09] what what the Holy Ghost in another
[1:05:11] sense the Holy Ghost is going to make
[1:05:14] the church bring the church to the place
[1:05:17] where the same place where the rock was
[1:05:20] able to give abundant water the Holy
[1:05:24] Ghost is going to bring the church to
[1:05:26] the place where we are going to be the
[1:05:29] ones to quench The Thirst of the
[1:05:35] word praise the
[1:05:39] Lord so in one sense the revelation of
[1:05:42] Jesus Christ have made us a rock to our
[1:05:47] age are we together we are going to be
[1:05:51] in a place to give and when the and when
[1:05:54] The Rock G gave water it was abundant
[1:05:58] abundantly it was not
[1:06:01] sparingly praise the Lord amen it was
[1:06:04] not sparingly we must be able to live a
[1:06:08] life of
[1:06:09] fullness praise the Lord every day must
[1:06:12] be aive you cannot Reserve strength for
[1:06:17] tomorrow praise the
[1:06:19] Lord
[1:06:20] amen the scripture said tomorrow will
[1:06:23] take care of
[1:06:24] itself whatever God gave us today and
[1:06:28] and and and and and as as good health
[1:06:30] and strength let's live in
[1:06:34] fullness praise the
[1:06:36] Lord if we are helping let's let's give
[1:06:39] our all out to
[1:06:40] help if we are praising let's give our
[1:06:43] all let's put ourself all in
[1:06:46] it because out of us must flow abundance
[1:06:49] of of Living Water praise the Lord so
[1:06:53] you will see the the the sense I want to
[1:06:56] go to tonight from our scripture reading

[1:07:15] the Lord of Moses day and night and in
[1:07:18] that Lord in the meditation of the Lord

[1:07:41] going to prosper
[1:07:44] him whatsoever he does shall
[1:07:48] prosper but as we look at the subject of
[1:07:52] uh this son of prosperity tonight I want
[1:07:55] for us to realize that
[1:07:58] uh the The Rock when it gives out the
[1:08:02] water it did not give out the water for
[1:08:06] itself it gave out the water for the
[1:08:09] testing people the people that was in
[1:08:13] the Beast praise the
[1:08:16] Lord amen I will also say that the rock
[1:08:20] never even suck any of the water B it
[1:08:22] just gave it just gave
[1:08:26] are we
[1:08:34] together in the message
[1:08:37] gift how Joseph was a perfect type of
[1:08:40] Christ how Moses was a perfect type of
[1:08:43] Christ Moses the lawgiver how that
[1:08:46] Joseph was the prince of
[1:08:50] prosperity everything he did
[1:08:54] prosper when he was here on
[1:08:58] Earth put him in the dungeon everything
[1:09:02] Prosper praise the
[1:09:05] Lord
[1:09:09] amen put him in
[1:09:12] Pharaoh Place everything Prosper
[1:09:15] wherever he went he was the prince of
[1:09:18] prosperity and and when he come again in
[1:09:22] glory the desert shall blow him as Rose
[1:09:26] and we will have no more desert and
[1:09:29] everything will prosper in the great
[1:09:31] Millennium when the prince of prosperity
[1:09:35] arrive praise the
[1:09:42] Lord this thing is playing trach on
[1:09:50] me okay if you can just
[1:09:52] okay sorry
[1:09:57] in the same in the same line of thought
[1:09:59] it's the same line of thought uh uh
[1:10:01] Prince of prosperity now
[1:10:03] Joseph down into Egypt he goes and there
[1:10:08] he was exalted from his praising to the
[1:10:12] right hand of pharaoh and was made the
[1:10:16] caretaker and everything prosper in the
[1:10:20] days of
[1:10:21] Joseph now when Jesus returned he even
[1:10:25] the deser shall bloome like a rose he
[1:10:29] was the son of prosperity a type of
[1:10:35] Joseph the general hide him in his house
[1:10:40] everything everything he done he
[1:10:42] prospered now think about this now as
[1:10:45] you keep it in your mind he's the son of
[1:10:48] prosperity where I'm carrying this
[1:10:50] thought is
[1:10:51] that everybody around Joseph was benefit
[1:10:56] fting from his
[1:11:01] presence yet he was going through
[1:11:06] triy praise the
[1:11:09] Lord portify God
[1:11:12] promoted his business was doing well but
[1:11:16] where did it Ender Joseph in
[1:11:21] prison the W The Rock gives out his
[1:11:24] water to the the people and The Rock
[1:11:27] Remains The
[1:11:28] Rock are we
[1:11:33] together are you I hope you get in my
[1:11:35] line of thought if now you will get it
[1:11:37] soon praise the
[1:11:39] Lord the gener hi him in his house
[1:11:43] everything he done he
[1:11:46] prospered they put him in
[1:11:48] jail their whole jail
[1:11:52] Prosper praise the Lord
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] everything they done it prosper and when
[1:12:05] he's
[1:12:07] exalted the highest next to Pharaoh
[1:12:11] everything in Egypt Prosper above
[1:12:14] anything in the
[1:12:16] world when he
[1:12:19] returned it will be a land of
[1:12:23] prosperity so the the the thought year
[1:12:26] behind uh that I'm driving to is that
[1:12:29] his
[1:12:30] presence amen his presence turned on the
[1:12:38] light his presence was edifying let me
[1:12:42] say it that way amen he was full of
[1:12:46] encouragement is see I mean he was he
[1:12:49] was he was giving out because Jesus said
[1:12:53] it will flow out of him rivers of
[1:12:58] water so this will bring us to the place
[1:13:01] where we will appreciate the thought
[1:13:03] when brother brandham says the gift is
[1:13:06] not for
[1:13:07] you it's for the people yes
[1:13:10] sir
[1:13:12] amen the water The Rock had the gift to
[1:13:15] bring water but it was not for the rock
[1:13:18] it was for the
[1:13:22] people Joseph had that gifts he was
[1:13:26] born on a sign I mean he was he he he
[1:13:30] had dreams and
[1:13:33] Visions every time it was Ling him in
[1:13:37] trouble but yet others were benefiting
[1:13:39] from it
[1:13:41] right praise the
[1:13:44] Lord are we
[1:13:47] together so you see it is it is in a
[1:13:50] place when we when we when we when we
[1:13:52] stay in the thought of making H H uh uh
[1:13:55] you know uh uh having Christ to have the
[1:13:57] preeminence in his church you will go
[1:14:00] back and and and realize that uh uh
[1:14:04] right back in
[1:14:06] Eden Adam was the son of
[1:14:10] prosperity praise the
[1:14:12] Lord he was the son of prosperity he was
[1:14:15] he was placed there as a son and on his
[1:14:19] his uh uh his his leadership Eden
[1:14:22] Prosper he gave names to the plants give
[1:14:25] names to the Beast everything
[1:14:28] Prosper but Adam and his wife will soon
[1:14:30] get in
[1:14:32] trouble they will soon fought away from
[1:14:34] their
[1:14:36] prosperity and take take to thought also
[1:14:39] right there before Genesis street that
[1:14:42] was where God told Adam to multiply and
[1:14:46] replenish the
[1:14:49] Earth what was
[1:14:51] that to make the Earth to prosper
[1:14:56] right that was before Genesis 3 so that
[1:15:00] that does not have anything to do with
[1:15:02] uh uh uh uh you know bringing for
[1:15:04] children bringing for children just
[1:15:06] became part of it
[1:15:10] right but that commission was given for
[1:15:12] Adam to multiply and replenish the Jesus
[1:15:16] in St John chapter 15 he says the father
[1:15:19] rejoices when we are
[1:15:23] fruitful praise the Lord the father
[1:15:28] rejoices when we are
[1:15:32] fruitful now so I'm trying to grab your
[1:15:35] mind to the place because we are living
[1:15:38] in an age this age this laition age the
[1:15:42] prophecy of this age is a rich age there
[1:15:46] is never a time in the history of the
[1:15:49] word word Prosperity has been preached
[1:15:51] like in this age why because it was
[1:15:54] ordained for this
[1:15:56] age never in the in the time of the
[1:15:59] world where people from uh you know from
[1:16:02] from from po family have been able to
[1:16:04] Excel and get themselves in the range of
[1:16:07] of of
[1:16:09] millionair it's the age
[1:16:13] right I mean people that have not gone
[1:16:15] to school I I I follow uh uh uh uh a
[1:16:19] documentary of a of a of young man I was
[1:16:21] impr praising for
[1:16:23] life and someone came and told him how
[1:16:26] the wealthy people have their money in
[1:16:28] stock he said what is
[1:16:30] stock and right in praising he started
[1:16:33] learning about
[1:16:35] stock and he got into stock and he he he
[1:16:38] even started teaching that I mean it got
[1:16:40] him out of prais him and before he even
[1:16:43] got out of praising he he was he had
[1:16:46] some
[1:16:47] money but it is the
[1:16:50] age but what I want us to see is there
[1:16:53] the prosperity a man prospering was not
[1:16:57] just at this time right from the
[1:17:00] beginning when God placed his son in the
[1:17:02] Garden of Eden he said multiply and
[1:17:05] replenish ex
[1:17:07] sell praise the Lord amen I have given
[1:17:12] you the Earth do the best you can with
[1:17:14] it right amen if you don't like where
[1:17:17] this tree is take it and put it another
[1:17:19] place
[1:17:21] right and say I'll do something yeah
[1:17:26] praise the
[1:17:28] Lord but you see the thought about it
[1:17:31] there is that he was to do something to
[1:17:34] make Eden a better place
[1:17:38] right praise the Lord it was now for his
[1:17:44] greed praise the Lord it was now for his
[1:17:48] greed it was now for him to fill his
[1:17:50] band and say oh my soul you have
[1:17:53] everything you can go to sleep
[1:17:55] right the Bible says the rich man that
[1:17:58] said that his soul was C out right yes
[1:18:03] are we
[1:18:06] together so you see even though we are
[1:18:09] in the age of prosperity we are in the L
[1:18:13] age the Bible say it's Rich for of GS
[1:18:16] brother said it's an age of
[1:18:20] Plenty but yet there is a devil that is
[1:18:22] riding the wing
[1:18:26] praise the
[1:18:28] Lord take it out of the church see all
[1:18:31] of these guy that you know Elon Mar and
[1:18:34] all these guys and they they they are
[1:18:37] breaking like the prophet was say
[1:18:38] they're breaking into God's laboratory
[1:18:41] right they are breaking invention to do
[1:18:44] what better the word
[1:18:47] yes communication we don't have to send
[1:18:50] telegram again pick your cell phone you
[1:18:52] can get all around the world it's
[1:18:54] becoming the benefit to everybody
[1:19:00] right are we
[1:19:02] together so the wrong concept and wrong
[1:19:05] teaching of prosperity is that place of
[1:19:09] word man enter in a sense of greed and
[1:19:13] want to get rich overnight yes want to
[1:19:17] make it to the
[1:19:19] first it's because I want to be better
[1:19:21] than this
[1:19:23] person no if I want to excel I must have
[1:19:27] the desire the reason why I must do it
[1:19:29] is because I want to be a blessing I
[1:19:31] want for people to benefit I want my
[1:19:34] presence to be a benefit to this local
[1:19:38] assembly if I can't be a benefit get me
[1:19:40] out of
[1:19:44] here praise the
[1:19:50] Lord that why God places some there
[1:19:53] Moses he was a son of
[1:19:57] prosperity we just read about
[1:20:01] him he was learning in the wisdom of the
[1:20:05] Egyptians he had it all very close to
[1:20:09] the throne The Nest
[1:20:11] Prince but he was born under the sign of
[1:20:15] a prince of
[1:20:17] prosperity praise the
[1:20:19] Lord he went away from there the first
[1:20:22] thing that he did was he got he he did
[1:20:24] with those Rebels that was trying to
[1:20:26] intimidate Zapora and her
[1:20:29] sisters praise the
[1:20:31] Lord even though he never knew anything
[1:20:34] about raising sheep but yet uh uh uh uh
[1:20:37] uh uh uh Zapora father could trust
[1:20:42] him praise the Lord then the only reason
[1:20:46] why he could trust him is because he was
[1:20:48] at the right place at the right time
[1:20:51] when when when when those uh uh uh
[1:20:53] Rebels was trying to intimidate the the
[1:20:55] girls he beat them out and and uh well
[1:20:58] this man show
[1:21:00] up we don't even know his name and here
[1:21:04] he's standing for a just
[1:21:06] cause his pres was a prosperity to those
[1:21:10] to those ladies
[1:21:13] sure praise the
[1:21:17] Lord God met him in on with the burning
[1:21:20] bush he had to go back to
[1:21:23] Egypt praise the Lord
[1:21:26] and going back to Egypt it was now all
[1:21:28] about Moses go you know Go and show them
[1:21:31] you were you were raised in this place
[1:21:33] just get there and just expose all the
[1:21:35] things in politics what phoh is doing in
[1:21:38] his house no God's purpose was tell them
[1:21:41] let my people go
[1:21:44] right even though the people would not
[1:21:47] accept Moses because they know the story
[1:21:50] of his past he's a runaway man he killed
[1:21:54] an egyp and he run away they will not
[1:21:56] accept
[1:21:57] him but it did not bother
[1:22:00] him his presence in Egypt was their
[1:22:04] prosperity out of
[1:22:09] bonage Praise the
[1:22:12] Lord are we
[1:22:18] together he brought them through the
[1:22:20] Wilderness these very same people make
[1:22:22] one trouble for him will you think you
[1:22:25] are we are also
[1:22:29] Levites praise the
[1:22:34] Lord and he's bringing them taking them
[1:22:36] to the promised land but yet he will not
[1:22:40] put his foot on the
[1:22:44] land he will not put his foot on the
[1:22:47] land God will take him on the Mountain
[1:22:49] View the land from AAR but Moses you
[1:22:51] will not get
[1:22:53] there and it's not because this man was
[1:22:55] so disobedient to the Lord even at a
[1:22:58] time where God was so angry with the
[1:23:00] people he wanted to come and just WEP
[1:23:03] them up Moses said no you got to First
[1:23:04] kill me he was the one that throw
[1:23:07] himself in the bridge for these very
[1:23:08] same people
[1:23:12] yes praise the
[1:23:15] Lord he says what what would the nation
[1:23:19] says that you were not able to bring us
[1:23:21] out to the promised land brought us in
[1:23:23] the wilderness WEP the people people I
[1:23:24] know God brother BR say he G he gave God
[1:23:27] something to think
[1:23:30] about are we
[1:23:34] together but you see his presence was
[1:23:38] for the benefit of the
[1:23:43] people not for his own
[1:23:47] benefit that's the sense of the son of
[1:23:53] prosperity
[1:23:55] praise the
[1:24:00] Lord the Bible says God breath into the
[1:24:04] nostr of Adam he became a living Soul
[1:24:09] amen so his soul
[1:24:12] prosper by the Breath of God and as long
[1:24:16] as he stayed in that position under that
[1:24:19] inspiration Eden
[1:24:23] prosper praise the
[1:24:25] Lord until he stepped out of the
[1:24:30] word I give you another example that
[1:24:34] struck my mind this
[1:24:38] afternoon we we know we we hear about uh
[1:24:42] John
[1:24:44] Wesley the man of the metad this
[1:24:49] revival he was chosen as a messenger of
[1:24:52] an
[1:24:53] age praise the lord we also hear about
[1:24:57] his brother Charles
[1:25:00] Wesley praise the
[1:25:03] Lord Susanna Wesley I I believe she has
[1:25:06] about uh maybe about 17 children if my
[1:25:10] number is
[1:25:11] Right praise the
[1:25:13] Lord and uh when when when you read her
[1:25:18] story it tells of how I mean she she
[1:25:21] taught her children in the word and uh
[1:25:23] you know she will pray for them and uh
[1:25:26] she will she will have them to to uh
[1:25:29] memorize a book of the Bible from a
[1:25:31] verse to a chapter from a chapter to a
[1:25:38] book and out of
[1:25:43] that the word was able to benefit from
[1:25:47] two of her
[1:25:50] boys praise the
[1:25:53] Lord
[1:25:56] amen I will say that she was a daughter
[1:26:00] of
[1:26:01] prosperity she was able to labor in
[1:26:04] tears and labor in
[1:26:06] discipline praise the Lord that the word
[1:26:10] the entire word even the move of God the
[1:26:15] Revival what God was doing in the life
[1:26:18] of
[1:26:20] men the whole world will benefit from
[1:26:23] two of her
[1:26:25] voice praise the Lord I I I I don't
[1:26:29] believe that she had it easy raising
[1:26:31] them up 17 children
[1:26:34] right praise the
[1:26:36] Lord and even even if you read if if you
[1:26:39] if you read about her story and you read
[1:26:41] about the story of the rest of the
[1:26:45] children not many of them even the girls
[1:26:48] many of them were not were not
[1:26:49] successful in their
[1:26:53] marriages
[1:26:54] and because of the way that even uh uh
[1:26:57] Samuel John Wesley father uh uh the way
[1:27:01] he was so he was so rigid and so strong
[1:27:04] it it it make John to even be afraid of
[1:27:07] marriage John got married late he he
[1:27:10] never got married as a young
[1:27:13] man he stayed away from married because
[1:27:15] he saw uh the marriages of his uh Elder
[1:27:19] siblings now
[1:27:22] working even when he made the choice to
[1:27:25] get married he got married to Catherine
[1:27:28] I mean and and and and there there was a
[1:27:30] whole lot that was going on there that
[1:27:32] John will attribute his
[1:27:37] ministry to his
[1:27:39] wife but when you listen to the
[1:27:42] testimony his wife was not always nice
[1:27:44] to
[1:27:45] him because John he in his mind his mind
[1:27:49] was so filled of of doing missionary
[1:27:52] work and C I mean she never grew up in a
[1:27:55] missionary
[1:27:59] home praise the
[1:28:02] Lord I hope you get the sense I'm going
[1:28:05] in
[1:28:07] tonight but Susanna Wesley her
[1:28:13] discipline the testimony said she had
[1:28:16] her hour of praying she never needed to
[1:28:19] tell her children she was praying she
[1:28:21] just took her apron and put it over her
[1:28:23] face
[1:28:24] the children knew that Mama was praying
[1:28:27] and everybody had to be
[1:28:33] quiet praise the
[1:28:36] Lord but the word the entire word the
[1:28:39] move of God benefit benefited from two
[1:28:43] of her
[1:28:50] boys brother BR says sometimes you you
[1:28:53] you put
[1:28:54] the labor into raising your
[1:28:57] children he says uh the girls might turn
[1:29:00] out to be wives of
[1:29:03] preachers praise the
[1:29:05] Lord they might turn out to be a deacon
[1:29:08] wife or turn out to be they don't have
[1:29:10] to have any position turn out to be a
[1:29:12] wife of a Son of
[1:29:20] God praise the
[1:29:22] Lord and and yet in the time that you
[1:29:25] are doing that you might do it many days
[1:29:29] where you are

[1:29:34] where you are just tripping from here

[1:29:48] you are meditating on his laws day and
[1:29:50] night amen praise the Lord sometimes
[1:29:54] times the prosperity might not even come
[1:29:56] in the time where you are
[1:30:00] alive praise the Lord Susanna Wesley was
[1:30:04] dead and gone when John Rose up on the
[1:30:07] scene as a
[1:30:10] revivalist she never saw her boy

[1:31:24] Methodist Church we fast and
[1:31:29] pray let me not preach about Methodist
[1:31:32] tonight praise the Lord but I'm trying
[1:31:35] to bring this thought so this son of
[1:31:39] prosperity when we said you know I'm a
[1:31:41] son of prosperity we must be giving
[1:31:45] out praise the Lord you are not
[1:31:49] prospering if others are not benefiting
[1:31:51] from
[1:31:52] you amen
[1:31:54] praise the Lord if it is all to just
[1:31:56] shine yourself up change your suits you
[1:31:59] are not prospering you are barely making
[1:32:02] it
[1:32:05] yes you are barely making it
[1:32:14] right but John says there H uh we we
[1:32:18] have promised that our soul will prosper
[1:32:21] in the
[1:32:22] word
[1:32:24] that mean we must be we must be we must
[1:32:26] be growing in the word as a Son of God
[1:32:29] and as a daughter of God that others can
[1:32:32] benefit from our
[1:32:34] life whether in
[1:32:37] quietness or you being a testimony and
[1:32:41] someone can look and says I've wased
[1:32:43] that little I there just something about
[1:32:45] I love the way she dressed it have just
[1:32:48] affected me I love the way she talk it
[1:32:51] just affected
[1:32:52] me that's when your soul is
[1:32:56] prospering it's not when you cram all
[1:32:58] the doctrine down in your head you get
[1:33:01] all the doctrine you get all the church
[1:33:03] order they have just make you so heavy
[1:33:06] that you can't give
[1:33:08] out that's why Jesus said the Pharisees
[1:33:11] they imprison theel with their
[1:33:14] Traditions
[1:33:18] right they are mind in the sense of
[1:33:20] keeping Moses law they impr praising

[1:33:44] being open the the mighty angel came
[1:33:48] down the Seven Seals

[1:36:02] this I was thinking about this today you
[1:36:04] know my mind was just going in different
[1:36:07] different area but think about this now
[1:36:10] Paul will says to the Corinthian Church
[1:36:13] he says if a
[1:36:15] man you know has an unbelieving
[1:36:21] wife let he not put her away
[1:36:25] maybe by the
[1:36:27] testimony or the conversation which mean

[1:36:36] home will apply the token over that

[1:37:07] and and that is the way with the
[1:37:09] Believers we take the word
[1:37:11] mentally but it has to drop in our heart
[1:37:14] to become a revelation all in his mind
[1:37:17] that I got the blessing so he was
[1:37:19] looking for some kind of a prosperity to
[1:37:21] follow him not knowing that he was going
[1:37:23] going to work for 14
[1:37:26] years and leban will get the benefit
[1:37:31] right 7 years for the Jewish Church age

[1:39:08] celebration fineral service and you hear
[1:39:12] people talking

[1:39:22] about the things that nobody
[1:39:28] saw is being an impact making an
[1:39:33] impa it's not all about impressing
[1:39:37] yourself of who you are you know I'm a
