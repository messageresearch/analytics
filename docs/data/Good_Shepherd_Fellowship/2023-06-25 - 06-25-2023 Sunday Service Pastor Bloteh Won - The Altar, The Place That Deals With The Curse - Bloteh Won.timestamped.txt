[1:00:18] lost a lot of function
[1:00:20] could not move any part of his right
[1:00:23] side at all
[1:00:25] during the course of his Hospital stay
[1:00:27] my mom told me the neurologist came in
[1:00:30] the room and they told her
[1:00:32] he'll never be able to use that use that
[1:00:34] bad again
[1:00:38] my dad
[1:00:40] I've never seen this man down to see him
[1:00:43] in such a vulnerable state was just
[1:00:46] it was very devastating for me
[1:00:49] and when she told me that it kind of
[1:00:51] made me lose Faith because working in
[1:00:54] the health field for 10 years you see a
[1:00:57] lot of things and
[1:00:59] you don't see people recover or bounce
[1:01:01] back from a lot of things
[1:01:04] a couple of weeks after he was in the
[1:01:06] hospital he was discharged to Inpatient
[1:01:08] Rehab
[1:01:09] my mother texted me one morning and she
[1:01:11] goes
[1:01:13] I came in this morning and the therapist
[1:01:15] told me dad moved his fingers on his
[1:01:17] right side
[1:01:24] thank God so I
[1:01:26] I just left it alone I didn't say
[1:01:28] anything else about it a couple weeks
[1:01:30] passed and I brought it up to her and
[1:01:32] again I'm like well
[1:01:34] has he moved his his right fingers again
[1:01:36] or have you witnessed it yourself
[1:01:38] and she goes oh he opens and closes that
[1:01:41] hand all the time now
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:46] and she goes he lifts up the arm too
[1:01:48] yeah
[1:01:51] yeah and she also said he's able to move
[1:01:53] his leg on his own
[1:01:57] and after two weeks in the hospital and
[1:02:00] two months an Inpatient Rehab this past
[1:02:02] Monday my dad has finally come back home
[1:02:09] he still has a long long road ahead of
[1:02:12] him but I thank God for how far he has
[1:02:15] brought him that's why I don't know God
[1:02:18] is not a halfway God he doesn't do
[1:02:20] things halfway so I'm still believing
[1:02:23] and trusting God to completely restore
[1:02:25] function in his body and restore his
[1:02:28] speech as well
[1:02:29] so I just just want to sing this short
[1:02:32] course and giving God thanks

[1:14:58] Tabernacles for the bodies of those
[1:15:00] beasts whose body is brought into the
[1:15:03] center by the high priest for sin are
[1:15:06] burned without the camp wherefore Jesus
[1:15:09] also that he might sanctify the people
[1:15:12] with his own blood
[1:15:14] Suffer Without The Gates Heavenly Father

[1:16:37] enzyme in his Tabernacle or in this
[1:16:40] Fellowship we've been we've been
[1:16:41] dwelling on it now for a while and uh
[1:16:48] Wednesday night we spoke a little bit on
[1:16:50] the father seeking
[1:16:52] seeking such to worship
[1:16:55] praise the Lord
[1:16:59] Saint John chapter 4 we will read from
[1:17:02] verse 19 uh Guru have you back to Mama
[1:17:06] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:10] the woman
[1:17:11] share unto him sir I perceive that thou
[1:17:15] art a prophet see John chapter 4 verse
[1:17:18] 19. Our Father worshiped in this
[1:17:21] mountain and yes say that in Jerusalem
[1:17:26] is the place where men ought to worship
[1:17:28] now so she was talking about the two
[1:17:31] mountains Mount evil and mongirism
[1:17:34] that's why we wanted the word on this
[1:17:35] morning so for us to get a history of
[1:17:38] those two mountains who will travel back
[1:17:39] to the book of Deuteronomy and uh and
[1:17:43] just and just uh uh go back a little bit
[1:17:47] Indian and see uh uh what she was
[1:17:53] talking about here she says our father
[1:17:56] Worship in this mountain and yes said
[1:17:59] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[1:18:02] are to worship praise the Lord
[1:18:06] amen so let's let's do a little review
[1:18:09] here as we will go back uh to the book
[1:18:12] of Deuteronomy the first uh first I will
[1:18:15] want us to look into uh
[1:18:25] let's look in chapter 11. let's look in
[1:18:28] chapter 11.
[1:18:38] foreign
[1:18:57] praise the Lord when you look in chapter
[1:19:00] 11 you see verse 26 reading from verse
[1:19:05] 26 uh Moses said behold I said before
[1:19:08] you this day
[1:19:10] a blessing and a cursing a blessing a
[1:19:14] year obey the Commandment of the Lord
[1:19:16] your God which I command you this day
[1:19:20] and a curse if you will not obey the
[1:19:24] Commandment of the Lord your God but
[1:19:26] turn it aside out of the way which I
[1:19:30] command you this day to go after other
[1:19:33] gods which you have not known and it
[1:19:37] shall come to pass when the Lord thy God
[1:19:40] has brought thee into
[1:19:43] brought thee in onto the land where they
[1:19:46] are going to possess it that thou shall
[1:19:49] put a blessing upon my gearism
[1:19:53] and the curse upon Mount evil
[1:19:58] now Mike Garrison was the mountain that
[1:20:01] the Samaritan woman said our father
[1:20:03] worshiped in this mountain
[1:20:05] there was the mountain of blessing
[1:20:09] and yet said it's in Jerusalem that we
[1:20:12] should worship there's that was the
[1:20:14] mountain of cursed Mount Eva now now so
[1:20:19] yeah Joshua is I mean Moses is
[1:20:22] instructing the MBA that when they get
[1:20:24] over to uh uh
[1:20:28] when they get over to to the to the to
[1:20:31] the promised land uh
[1:20:35] and this this is what they should do
[1:20:39] praise the Lord
[1:20:40] this is what that they should do
[1:20:43] are we together
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:49] now no uh uh Deuteronomy chapter 27.
[1:21:27] foreign
[1:21:29] 27 Moses is going to repeat the same
[1:21:32] thing that he said uh there in uh verse
[1:21:38] chapter 11 that we we just read earlier
[1:21:42] so he's going to repeat himself here but
[1:21:44] what what I want us to pick up here was
[1:21:47] something that we went over and uh not
[1:21:51] to now to take much of your time but
[1:21:54] just just to remind us now in chapter 27
[1:21:57] is where Moses is going to read out the
[1:22:01] curses to them he's going to read out
[1:22:03] the curses to them and he starts to read
[1:22:06] from verse 14 and the Levi's shall speak
[1:22:10] and say it unto all the men of Israel
[1:22:15] with a loud voice now if you go on and
[1:22:18] read the next chapter you will realize
[1:22:20] that Moses instructed the children of
[1:22:23] Israel that every seven years every
[1:22:27] seven years
[1:22:29] the entire congregation was supposed to
[1:22:31] gather
[1:22:32] and rehearse these ordinance
[1:22:37] every seven years they were to gather
[1:22:39] all the people
[1:22:42] and they were supposed to go over
[1:22:44] these blessings and curses
[1:22:48] praise the Lord amen
[1:22:51] now you just think about this now think
[1:22:54] about this
[1:22:56] if if Israel
[1:22:58] who have
[1:23:00] taken heed to what Moses instructed him
[1:23:04] that every seven years gather the people
[1:23:09] and rehearse
[1:23:11] these words today
[1:23:14] they wouldn't have heard the Book of
[1:23:16] Judges
[1:23:20] praise the Lord
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:25] if the Lord would just help me this
[1:23:28] morning to be able to bring uh
[1:23:32] what I felt as an inspiration on this
[1:23:34] talk to you just like I have it on my
[1:23:36] heart it will be a blessing
[1:23:38] you see people uh uh the word of God
[1:23:42] is is not
[1:23:45] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:23:48] alone but by every word that proceed
[1:23:50] from the mouth of God which of course he
[1:23:52] was actually quoting the book of
[1:23:54] Deuteronomy chapter 8. that's what Moses
[1:23:57] said but uh moreover uh uh you know more
[1:24:01] to that is the other you see the uh
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:08] Paul let us know in Hebrew that
[1:24:11] everything was created by the word of
[1:24:15] God
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] God said let there be and there was
[1:24:21] everything that was created
[1:24:24] and God created man even by his word
[1:24:29] when he says let us make man in our
[1:24:31] image
[1:24:33] but then moreover the Bible says he
[1:24:37] breath into man
[1:24:39] the Breath of Life
[1:24:41] and Man became a living soul
[1:24:44] praise the Lord
[1:24:46] what my thought behind saying this is
[1:24:49] there if you will just take this Bible
[1:24:53] every morning even if you can do it
[1:24:56] every morning let me let me be just like
[1:24:58] Moses
[1:25:00] every seventh day
[1:25:03] before a week goes over
[1:25:06] if you would just take this Bible
[1:25:09] and earnestly just read don't read
[1:25:13] as a Scarlet to learn just read Because
[1:25:16] you believe that is the word of God
[1:25:20] praise the Lord it will change your life
[1:25:27] praise the Lord
[1:25:35] yeah I'm I'm getting into my elements
[1:25:37] now so let me let's just let's just go
[1:25:39] ahead the Levi's and verse 14 of 27 in
[1:25:44] the Levi shall speak and said unto the
[1:25:46] people
[1:25:47] and say it unto all the men of Israel
[1:25:49] with the lovers curse be the man that
[1:25:52] make it and grieving it grieving maketh
[1:25:55] and Engraving or malting image and
[1:25:58] Abomination unto the Lord and the work
[1:26:02] of the hands of a craft man putting it
[1:26:05] in a secret place and all the people
[1:26:09] shall answer and say
[1:26:12] all the people shall answer and say Amen
[1:26:15] are the people here this morning
[1:26:17] praise the Lord
[1:26:22] cares be he that said it
[1:26:25] he that said a light by his father or
[1:26:29] all his mother and all the people shall
[1:26:32] I say Amen
[1:26:34] amen so we went over this like I said
[1:26:37] I'm just doing a review here and what we
[1:26:39] realize is that as the priests were
[1:26:43] reading out all of these curses the
[1:26:45] people were to say Amen
[1:26:49] but when it came to the blessing the
[1:26:52] people never say Amen
[1:26:55] praise the Lord because it's God's
[1:26:58] desire to bless you
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:02] is his desire to bless you
[1:27:05] praise the Lord I mean the Lord has been
[1:27:09] so good to us more than we deserve
[1:27:15] praise the Lord
[1:27:16] David said if he was
[1:27:19] acknowledging our thought or trying to
[1:27:22] reward us for good or bad none of us
[1:27:25] will be here this morning
[1:27:29] praise the Lord now so in one sense
[1:27:33] Moses was bringing the people to the
[1:27:35] place to agree
[1:27:36] that if curses is coming upon your life
[1:27:39] is because you agree to it
[1:27:44] is because you agree to it
[1:27:48] in another sense God's desire and God's
[1:27:55] thoughts is to bless you
[1:27:59] the Bible says and God made Man In His
[1:28:02] Image male and female and he watched
[1:28:05] bless them
[1:28:08] that's what the Bible says
[1:28:13] are we together
[1:28:16] so we see here how uh uh
[1:28:24] Moses brought the people through out of
[1:28:26] the stuff the blessing and the cursing
[1:28:28] and it was rehearsed to the people and
[1:28:30] it was something that was supposed to be
[1:28:32] done every seven years but as the people
[1:28:35] went into the promised land that God
[1:28:37] that God saw like the human nature
[1:28:40] everybody trying to claim their
[1:28:42] inheritance and now they have forgot
[1:28:44] about the Commandments of the Lord they
[1:28:46] are not rehearsing the the the the
[1:28:49] Commandments of the Lord you know again
[1:28:52] to their family and and the entire
[1:28:54] Congregation of the people and pretty
[1:28:56] soon they started uh you know slacking
[1:28:59] out of the principle of God and start
[1:29:01] doing things that they were not supposed
[1:29:03] to do and then all the curses started
[1:29:05] coming on then they started having
[1:29:07] problems with the people of the land
[1:29:09] they started you know uh having the
[1:29:11] Philistines to rule over them in their
[1:29:14] own inheritance
[1:29:16] praise the Lord
[1:29:18] Hallelujah
[1:29:21] are we together
[1:29:31] now so uh
[1:29:35] also you will see here
[1:29:38] right in chapter 27 let's stay there
[1:29:41] let's go up a little bit
[1:29:44] and uh
[1:29:47] verse 4.
[1:29:51] like I said it's a review therefore it
[1:29:54] shall be when ye be gone over Jordan
[1:29:57] that year shall set up these stones
[1:30:01] which I command you this day in Mount
[1:30:05] Eva
[1:30:06] that thou shall plaster them
[1:30:10] with plaster
[1:30:12] and there Shada Bill an altar
[1:30:17] unto the Lord thy God
[1:30:20] an author of stones
[1:30:23] Thou shalt not lift up any iron ii upon
[1:30:27] it
[1:30:28] Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord
[1:30:31] thy God with whole stones
[1:30:34] and thou shall offer burn offering there
[1:30:38] on unto the Lord thy God completely
[1:30:40] different from my Garrison there was no
[1:30:43] altar on my Garrison
[1:30:47] praise the Lord
[1:30:50] amen now you think about it now because
[1:30:52] that's why we're coming to deal with
[1:30:53] this morning
[1:30:55] oh Lord I need your help
[1:30:58] think about it this morning
[1:31:00] an amount
[1:31:02] Garrison
[1:31:04] were the blessings were pronounced
[1:31:09] the people were not to say Amen
[1:31:13] and they never said amen after the
[1:31:15] priest the priest just read the blessing
[1:31:16] the Lord that God shall bless thee he
[1:31:18] shall bless your going out he shall
[1:31:20] bless your coming in and and I think
[1:31:22] every one of us we we have experienced
[1:31:25] that not many times we pray before we go
[1:31:27] out but yet the law keep us and he bring
[1:31:29] us back home safely amen because that
[1:31:31] his desire to bless our going out and
[1:31:34] bless our coming in praise the Lord
[1:31:40] and also you ever said that uh Moses
[1:31:44] said
[1:31:48] Thou shalt build an altar
[1:31:53] praise the Lord
[1:31:57] now so
[1:31:59] that's what is bringing us to our top
[1:32:02] this morning
[1:32:04] we want to we we want to I'm I'm
[1:32:06] speaking on on what I call the altar the
[1:32:11] place that D with the curse
[1:32:16] the place that these with the curse
[1:32:20] I first title this message the altar
[1:32:24] is a tombstone
[1:32:29] praise the Lord
[1:32:30] you will see for many pulpits and and uh
[1:32:34] they always build it like this you
[1:32:37] either have
[1:32:39] uh
[1:32:40] a cross on it or it will have a Bible on
[1:32:44] it it will have some kind of a
[1:32:45] inscription
[1:32:47] it's no different from the tombstone
[1:32:49] when when when we we bury our loved ones
[1:32:54] we put a tombstone up
[1:32:56] you either put a cross you pour their
[1:32:58] photo you say something about them
[1:33:02] and uh if anyone comes around and they
[1:33:06] look at the tombstone they can they can
[1:33:08] see if there's a cross it's easy for
[1:33:10] them to believe that that person
[1:33:13] was a Christian
[1:33:16] praise the Lord
[1:33:19] so I believe I took that little thought
[1:33:21] from us from a song
[1:33:23] that I wanted to sing this morning but I
[1:33:25] was I was kind of struggling so
[1:33:28] I just decided that I would leave it
[1:33:32] and uh
[1:33:36] I have I have a I have a uh let me just
[1:33:39] read few words of the songs to you
[1:33:43] and uh
[1:33:45] maybe another time
[1:33:48] if the Lord bless us with the gift of
[1:33:50] singing
[1:33:53] then we will sing it
[1:33:56] this is an old song writing back
[1:33:59] I think in the 80s or so they are all
[1:34:02] altered they can't talk
[1:34:06] oh but it won't reveal
[1:34:11] things the heavens have forgotten
[1:34:14] and what hell we never what hell never
[1:34:18] will it just said that in the silence
[1:34:23] and speak loud
[1:34:25] through their tears
[1:34:28] praise the Lord
[1:34:31] and not a saint says that when we come
[1:34:33] to the altar
[1:34:35] whether this altar
[1:34:37] or the altar that we have
[1:34:40] that no making partake of
[1:34:43] that's your heart
[1:34:45] when Paul says we have an altar
[1:34:49] that their wish that make the sacrifice
[1:34:51] partake not off
[1:34:53] is the way God is dealing with you in
[1:34:56] your heart
[1:34:58] the way you're going to take the word of
[1:35:00] God this morning in your heart
[1:35:04] praise the Lord
[1:35:07] it speaks loud through via tears
[1:35:10] says their new life began
[1:35:14] When sin died year
[1:35:17] somewhere between the peel and the
[1:35:19] pulpit
[1:35:21] a heart so unclean was made spotless
[1:35:24] brand new
[1:35:26] thou old altar is a tombstone
[1:35:31] and the writing is clear
[1:35:34] it says Grace up this battle and
[1:35:37] sin down right here
[1:35:41] praise the Lord
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:45] Jesus said
[1:35:47] if we believe in him he says
[1:35:51] them that believe in him he promised
[1:35:54] that we will pass from Death unto life
[1:35:58] we know that when a Christian
[1:36:02] pass this life he have graduated into a
[1:36:05] better life
[1:36:06] is because
[1:36:12] when we die
[1:36:14] or drop this body
[1:36:17] it was exactly now where a Son of God or
[1:36:20] the daughter of God die every child of
[1:36:23] God
[1:36:25] dies on the altar
[1:36:29] the first Son of God was Abel
[1:36:33] he died on his own altar
[1:36:36] king killed Abel on his altar
[1:36:40] and every child of God dies on the altar
[1:36:45] praise the Lord
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:49] so right between the congregation and
[1:36:52] this pulpit
[1:36:56] this is our grave place
[1:36:59] praise the Lord
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:05] I come every day then if I if I can make
[1:37:07] it a year that I come and and I lay
[1:37:09] right down yet in my grave
[1:37:14] and this is our tombstone
[1:37:18] praise the Lord because this is the
[1:37:20] place where sin Must Die
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] this is the place where sin Must Die
[1:37:43] so like I said if God blessed me with
[1:37:45] the gift of singing I will sing it one
[1:37:46] of these days
[1:37:49] but I want to get into my thoughts yeah
[1:37:58] so we see here that uh
[1:38:03] uh Moses
[1:38:05] is instructing
[1:38:08] the children of Israel that right in
[1:38:11] this mountain Eva where the curses will
[1:38:15] be listed
[1:38:16] they must build an altar
[1:38:19] amen and they must make sacrifices
[1:38:24] to the Lord
[1:38:27] praise the Lord
[1:38:30] they must burn sacrifices to the Lord
[1:38:33] offer burn offering unto the Lord thy
[1:38:36] God and thou shall offer peace offering
[1:38:40] and thou shall eat and rejoice before
[1:38:43] the Lord thy God
[1:38:45] and thou shall write upon the stone all
[1:38:48] the words of this Lord very plainly
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:57] praise the Lord
[1:39:01] so what we want to realize this morning
[1:39:05] is there the
[1:39:07] uh
[1:39:12] you can see it right in the the the the
[1:39:15] the the sacrifice
[1:39:18] of the first worshiper
[1:39:21] when uh
[1:39:26] uh King and Abel Came To Worship
[1:39:31] the broad the uh the uh the offering
[1:39:35] and uh to the best of their knowledge
[1:39:39] what they think that will be acceptable
[1:39:42] to the Lord
[1:39:43] and King he brought all the fruits of
[1:39:47] the land in here in the he counted for
[1:39:49] decorated his his altar
[1:39:53] you know abroad some of uh some of the
[1:39:57] nice flowers and all of that
[1:39:59] praise the Lord
[1:40:03] for Abel
[1:40:05] whatever he used to build his altar
[1:40:11] he drank a Little Lamb
[1:40:15] and never had a bush or knife so he had
[1:40:18] to take a sharp Rock
[1:40:22] and he held that line crying for mercy
[1:40:27] the alarm was terrified
[1:40:31] but yet he took that shop right right to
[1:40:34] the neck of that Lyman and I mean he
[1:40:37] went up and down and you know and
[1:40:39] anybody looking at that you would think
[1:40:41] this God is cruel
[1:40:45] praise the Lord
[1:40:47] why the crew of death that that little
[1:40:50] innocent animal
[1:40:52] was going through the pains they cried
[1:40:55] and all of that
[1:40:58] and his owner altar was not pretty
[1:41:01] because there were blood splashed all
[1:41:04] over the altar
[1:41:06] praise the Lord
[1:41:09] but when almighty God looks down the
[1:41:11] Bible said God had respect
[1:41:15] the offering
[1:41:17] of Abel
[1:41:19] the Bible says in Hebrew by faith in
[1:41:23] their offer a perfect sacrifice
[1:41:28] praise the Lord
[1:41:29] amen
[1:41:31] because the altar is the place that
[1:41:34] these with the curse
[1:41:38] glory be to God
[1:41:41] amen if you read the book of of of of uh
[1:41:45] Joshua you will realize when the people
[1:41:48] went into their inheritance there were
[1:41:50] few tribes a minor said in God and few
[1:41:53] of the tribes that that that got their
[1:41:56] inheritance before Jordan
[1:41:59] and these people before Jordan decided
[1:42:02] that they were going to build an altar
[1:42:04] because in one sense they thought that
[1:42:06] it was it was it was more it was more of
[1:42:09] a distance to go across the Jordan and
[1:42:12] go to the place where these Auto were
[1:42:15] built because these altar Moses told
[1:42:17] them to build a memorial this is the
[1:42:19] place where they were supposed to make
[1:42:21] their sacrifice and bring their worship
[1:42:23] they taught that it was more of a place
[1:42:25] to go so they will build their altar
[1:42:28] year when the children of Israel heard
[1:42:30] it they sent men to acquire from them
[1:42:32] and says what are you doing are you
[1:42:34] breaking the church
[1:42:38] are you beginning to start another
[1:42:41] assembly year when this is the place
[1:42:43] that we were instructed to meet and
[1:42:46] worship
[1:42:49] praise the Lord they said no we we are
[1:42:52] just building an auto for mmora
[1:42:56] we were not going to make no sacrifices
[1:42:59] upon it you see if you are not going to
[1:43:02] make any sacrifices upon it you have to
[1:43:04] realize that with our blood without the
[1:43:07] sharing of blood
[1:43:11] your altar is not accepted
[1:43:15] without the sharing of blood
[1:43:20] and just like we said to you before that
[1:43:23] is the reason why
[1:43:25] the children of Israel the Hebrews uh uh
[1:43:28] the people presently now and in Israel
[1:43:31] the zionists and and all the religious
[1:43:33] people there they are still looking for
[1:43:36] a red Huffer
[1:43:40] the only goals to the Willing world and
[1:43:42] they cry to God our Father Abraham Isaac
[1:43:45] and Jacob all that's all they can do
[1:43:47] they are all all they can do is to just
[1:43:50] pray and they read the Torah them and
[1:43:53] they learn the Torah but they can never
[1:43:55] bring worship to God because they don't
[1:43:58] have a sacrifice
[1:44:00] God will not accept worship with our
[1:44:03] sacrifice
[1:44:07] praise the Lord
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:12] and that is the reason why our our uh
[1:44:15] allowedition worship of convenience
[1:44:19] that we want to build for ourselves in
[1:44:21] this age by just uh uh uh pushing a
[1:44:24] remote uh so God will now accept
[1:44:28] and worship with our sacrifice
[1:44:34] are we together
[1:44:43] oh God help us this morning amen
[1:44:46] we need help from the Lord
[1:44:49] we need help from the Lord amen
[1:44:52] may he help us this morning
[1:44:58] praise the Lord
[1:45:04] in the mouth of the curse
[1:45:06] that's word the altar is
[1:45:09] because it's the Earth that deals with
[1:45:12] the curse
[1:45:16] praise the Lord is the altar that these
[1:45:20] with the curse
[1:45:22] you see that's the reason why the church
[1:45:25] has made a poor example in this age
[1:45:28] because we're having bunch of authors
[1:45:30] that is all about prosperity
[1:45:35] and there is no bleeding word
[1:45:38] on those altar there is no bleeding word
[1:45:41] of Truth
[1:45:43] it's all about prosperity
[1:45:52] are we together
[1:45:53] because God will not accept a worship
[1:45:58] without a sacrifice
[1:46:05] Hallelujah
[1:46:10] many years back uh
[1:46:13] uh not so many
[1:46:16] I was trying to look back in and I
[1:46:19] preach a message here that I entitled
[1:46:24] the altar the pupe a place of sacrifice
[1:46:30] and uh
[1:46:33] uh have the same sense
[1:46:36] but we were looking into what what is
[1:46:39] the pulpit you know we we have this
[1:46:41] language the Socrates you know the
[1:46:43] sacred deaths no man goes behind the
[1:46:45] sacred deaths you know we we get that
[1:46:48] language and and uh uh you know uh uh
[1:46:51] religion has has brought to us that you
[1:46:54] know when you have this wood you you put
[1:46:56] it in the church and it's oh don't play
[1:46:58] on the don't play on the pulpit you know
[1:47:00] that's that's you know that's that is
[1:47:02] the that's the altar you know in all of
[1:47:04] that it's good to have reference and
[1:47:07] respect for those things
[1:47:08] but you see God look behind that
[1:47:14] he looked far beyond that because you
[1:47:17] have an altar
[1:47:19] praise the Lord you have an altar
[1:47:22] you can respect this or would instead
[1:47:26] disregard God in your heart
[1:47:29] disregard the word of God in your heart
[1:47:34] and you can have all the respect for
[1:47:36] this for this little rule right here we
[1:47:38] love it
[1:47:42] but Paul says you have an altar
[1:47:46] and that's what I want to address this
[1:47:48] morning
[1:47:49] praise the Lord
[1:47:57] so many years you know I I way back I've
[1:48:01] I've always thought about that word you
[1:48:03] know what what where did the origin of
[1:48:05] the word Pulpit came from because in my
[1:48:08] mind when I listened to the syllables of
[1:48:11] the word it means that to me it sounds
[1:48:14] like pulling someone out of a pit
[1:48:19] but you you realize that uh uh you look
[1:48:23] you look through through uh uh
[1:48:27] all the different different dictionaries
[1:48:29] and you look at the try to look at the
[1:48:32] origin of the word it has this sense of
[1:48:36] you know a platform that is built and uh
[1:48:42] uh
[1:48:44] but
[1:48:46] as I was studying in I was looking into
[1:48:48] waiting and I realized that if you if
[1:48:52] you look at that you will realize that
[1:48:55] let's let's look at something here
[1:48:57] quickly if uh if uh if that would help
[1:49:01] us Exodus chapter 17.
[1:49:05] Exodus chapter 17.
[1:49:15] that might give us an idea of what a
[1:49:17] Pulpit
[1:49:18] or or
[1:49:20] you know
[1:49:25] a religious platform is
[1:49:27] where the inspiration came from the
[1:49:29] Bible will speak here about uh uh
[1:49:35] the children of Israel here they are in
[1:49:38] they are in a fight
[1:49:40] not to take much of your time here in in
[1:49:43] all of this reading they were fighting
[1:49:45] they had a fight with their uh
[1:49:48] I'm
[1:49:50] uh
[1:49:55] uh you had a fight with the amaleks
[1:49:58] so uh yeah you will see here that so
[1:50:01] Joshua there's over in verse 10.
[1:50:04] so Joshua did as Moses have said unto
[1:50:07] him
[1:50:09] and fought with amalek and and Moses and
[1:50:11] Aaron
[1:50:13] and heard went up to the top of the
[1:50:15] mountain and it came to pass when Moses
[1:50:17] held up his hands
[1:50:20] that Israel Prevail and when Moses let
[1:50:23] down his hands I mean like I I'm not
[1:50:26] like Prevail and Moses hand was Heavy it
[1:50:30] started to get weak
[1:50:32] and it and it took a stone
[1:50:36] and uh and put it under him
[1:50:41] and he sat there on
[1:50:43] praise the Lord
[1:50:45] amen now so let's let's Vision this
[1:50:48] together now let's Vision this okay
[1:50:51] Moses they they are fighting in the
[1:50:54] battle just like where we we fight our
[1:50:57] battles our home in the street and and
[1:51:00] all the bad different fight that we go
[1:51:02] through and uh
[1:51:07] and yet Moses is standing right on the
[1:51:10] hill now you have to realize it's an
[1:51:12] elevated place that's where we get a
[1:51:15] concept of making our Pulpit an elevated
[1:51:17] place you know we build a platform so
[1:51:20] the people can be there and the minister
[1:51:22] is here and then now uh Moses was dead
[1:51:27] and he lived for his hands and every
[1:51:29] time a hands was lifted up Israel had a
[1:51:32] victory you know they were I mean they
[1:51:34] were they were they were you know uh
[1:51:37] getting these guys down and and as as
[1:51:40] Moses hands gets tired and it was it was
[1:51:43] coming down uh uh uh you know the
[1:51:46] amalikes were stats you know getting
[1:51:49] back on the Israel and all of that so uh
[1:51:51] they decided that they would they will
[1:51:54] bail you know uh uh put a group of
[1:51:57] stones together instead of Moses
[1:51:59] standing up they would make a stone for
[1:52:01] him to sit on and uh uh you know they
[1:52:05] will have one person holding his hands
[1:52:07] up and another person holding his hands
[1:52:10] up uh Aaron and Herb in as much as as
[1:52:13] Moses hands remains up the people
[1:52:16] continuing to get uh get the battle amen
[1:52:19] so uh that's that is the concept of
[1:52:24] where we get our Pulpit from
[1:52:26] amen
[1:52:28] is is a place that we built for the
[1:52:31] world to be above the people
[1:52:36] the real concept of the pulpit is not
[1:52:39] the decoration or the style
[1:52:43] or what we have on it the concept of the
[1:52:46] pulpit is for the word to be above us
[1:52:52] because it's the word
[1:52:54] that fights our battle
[1:53:00] praise the Lord
[1:53:01] is the word that fights our battle
[1:53:05] amen so as long as they keep the hand of
[1:53:10] Moses up
[1:53:12] they were victorious
[1:53:16] when the hands gets tired
[1:53:19] praise the Lord
[1:53:21] so they build those stones they sat him
[1:53:23] down and and and and and build a stone
[1:53:25] up to his air ball where he can rest his
[1:53:27] hand on put another Stone here his hand
[1:53:30] is not going anywhere this time
[1:53:32] praise the Lord
[1:53:34] amen and as long as they kept him in
[1:53:37] that position they won the battle
[1:53:41] glory be to God
[1:53:43] are we together
[1:53:46] so that that is the concept
[1:53:49] that comes to the New Testament Church
[1:53:54] we have a place elevator before the
[1:53:57] people
[1:53:59] it is now for the man that comes behind
[1:54:01] the pulpit
[1:54:03] that place is there for
[1:54:06] the word
[1:54:09] to be above the people
[1:54:13] are we together
[1:54:15] amen
[1:54:17] now so uh as as we will go as we will go
[1:54:20] along here uh uh I know I'm I'm just I'm
[1:54:24] so deep into my time here now but that's
[1:54:27] okay praise the Lord
[1:54:32] we realize that God
[1:54:34] uh uh let's let's read back a little bit
[1:54:37] there in Harvest Time uh uh uh may I go
[1:54:41] back in Genesis which is the beginning
[1:54:43] Genesis mean the beginning we find that
[1:54:45] God gave his family
[1:54:49] eternal life as long as they stay with
[1:54:52] this word
[1:54:53] and live by this word
[1:54:57] amen
[1:54:59] but when they broke it just one link
[1:55:04] in the chain of promises destructing
[1:55:10] which was also a promise the day you eat
[1:55:14] of this
[1:55:15] that day you will die
[1:55:18] just one they broke one
[1:55:22] Link in the chain of promise
[1:55:25] and death struck them
[1:55:31] are we together
[1:55:36] it's a chain you are hanging over hell
[1:55:39] with it and that's the only thing that
[1:55:42] will carry you through when the believer
[1:55:45] becomes a make-believer and live on one
[1:55:49] word that is contrary to this word he
[1:55:52] caught his fellowship with God
[1:55:56] praise the Lord
[1:55:58] amen he caught his fellowship with God
[1:56:01] won't link broke and remember your faith
[1:56:04] in this word is like a chain
[1:56:07] a chain is a strongest at its weaker
[1:56:12] link
[1:56:13] praise the Lord no matter how strong the
[1:56:16] chain is where it breaks
[1:56:19] that's where his strength is
[1:56:22] praise the Lord where it breaks that
[1:56:25] word is strength is
[1:56:28] does that speak to you
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:32] Hallelujah
[1:56:35] why the enemy hits you in one area
[1:56:39] because he knows that where your
[1:56:41] strength is if you would just realize it
[1:56:48] praise the Lord
[1:56:51] Hallelujah you can be doing good and be
[1:56:54] on the mountain and praising God as soon
[1:56:56] as he comes in that area you just have
[1:56:58] in a miserable day
[1:57:00] because he understands this principle
[1:57:03] that chain is only strong at its weaker
[1:57:06] link
[1:57:09] praise the Lord
[1:57:10] and that's the place where we must keep
[1:57:13] under the blood that's the place where
[1:57:15] we must be conscious of every day
[1:57:19] that's the place where we need more of
[1:57:22] God
[1:57:31] he understands the principle of life
[1:57:34] that's right it's the strongest
[1:57:37] that caused that all
[1:57:40] because all it holds and if there is
[1:57:43] something in the word that's puzzling to
[1:57:47] you something that you have heard
[1:57:50] different but they said they're all that
[1:57:55] was for the apostles uh uh and and them
[1:57:59] things was for the days gone by when the
[1:58:03] scripture says Jesus is the same
[1:58:05] yesterday today and forever don't let
[1:58:08] there be a weakness
[1:58:10] praise the Lord 45 45 8 and hold to it
[1:58:15] and wrap your life into it because
[1:58:17] that's the only thing that will take you
[1:58:20] over the flame of hell
[1:58:24] praise the Lord
[1:58:27] which means there is no part of the word
[1:58:30] that we must make excuses on
[1:58:32] that it was only good for those days
[1:58:35] it's not good now if God remained the
[1:58:38] same if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:58:41] yesterday today and forever then there
[1:58:45] is no portion of the word that we must
[1:58:47] make excuses on
[1:58:49] amen if the same God that taught
[1:58:52] children Abednego through a furnace fire
[1:58:56] he can take you through the hell of
[1:58:59] laodisha
[1:59:04] praise the Lord
[1:59:07] because that's the only thing that will
[1:59:09] take us over the flame of hell
[1:59:13] the word of God
[1:59:15] praise the Lord the word of God if it is
[1:59:18] not working for you is not because the
[1:59:20] word is not truth
[1:59:22] is because you are processing it wrong
[1:59:27] praise the Lord if it is not working for
[1:59:30] you it is not because that the word is
[1:59:33] not true
[1:59:34] is because you are processing it wrong
[1:59:38] maybe you have the curve before the
[1:59:40] hearse you have to you have to change it
[1:59:42] around or you're going in the wrong
[1:59:44] direction
[1:59:46] are we together
[1:59:48] praise the Lord but look at this
[1:59:51] prophetically know that we don't have
[1:59:53] much time here this morning

[2:02:37] these people here
[2:02:39] I mean you can take it in your money and
[2:02:41] and you look at it because even when you
[2:02:43] go down you will see how Moses lay our
[2:02:46] setting of the tribes of certain of the
[2:02:49] sons of uh of uh uh
[2:02:53] Jacob on the on on the mountain of ibad
[2:02:57] and setting of The Sons on Garrison you

[2:03:02] the scripture then it it bad for your
[2:03:04] mind you know uh even myself I was
[2:03:07] reading this I was saying wow I mean uh
[2:03:09] yeah they say Amen to all all the curses

[2:03:14] blessings that we would say to him and
[2:03:16] told amen praise the Lord the people in
[2:03:19] the church will start raining down
[2:03:20] curses nobody's going to say Amen to you
[2:03:22] and when you start promising them God's
[2:03:24] protection then they can say Amen to you
[2:03:26] praise the Lord hallelujah but you see
[2:03:29] God in his great wisdom in the great
[2:03:33] mind great wisdom the way the Fountain
[2:03:35] of wisdom God was was laying out
[2:03:39] something years in so much knowing that
[2:03:42] it would be right in the city of
[2:03:45] Jerusalem

[2:03:57] where almighty God talk the form of man
[2:04:01] in the womb of a virgin
[2:04:05] it will be writing I say the word where

[2:04:35] praise the Lord
[2:04:37] he was carrying the curse that sin
[2:04:40] brought to the human race
[2:04:42] and God was going to answer the same
[2:04:45] question
[2:04:46] he was going to destroy the curse

[2:04:52] they come and destroy the curse in The
[2:04:55] Believer

[2:05:03] many Christians has made poor example of
[2:05:07] the Holy Ghost
[2:05:11] praise the Lord
[2:05:14] because the new birth have just become a
[2:05:16] slogan to the people

[2:06:04] from Death unto life
[2:06:06] because the curse is broken
[2:06:14] praise the Lord
[2:06:15] the curse is
[2:06:18] broken
[2:06:22] that's what makes a man to pass
[2:06:28] praise the Lord
[2:06:31] look right there Jesus
[2:06:34] there on the cross and two teeth
[2:06:39] beside him

[2:06:53] you will be with
[2:06:55] me within Paradise
[2:06:59] praise the Lord amen
[2:07:03] he never went to a church
[2:07:06] never went to none of Jesus's meetings
[2:07:09] praise the Lord never go baptized by
[2:07:13] John the Baptist or Jesus disciple
[2:07:17] but right hanging on the cross that day
[2:07:19] right at that moment their own money

[2:07:28] have held that man down in in a slave to
[2:07:32] sin whatever whatever was the wrong that
[2:07:35] he did
[2:07:36] the thing that had the control over his
[2:07:39] life
[2:07:40] was broken right there and there
[2:07:51] this Holy Ghost works
[2:07:54] praise the Lord this
[2:07:56] this horse works
[2:07:58] hallelujah it's not just a thought it's
[2:08:02] not a sloggy it works
[2:08:04] change lives
[2:08:06] and deliver people
[2:08:10] because that's what the altar is for
[2:08:14] the altar is to destroy
[2:08:17] the curse

[2:08:54] eternal internally truth is that right
[2:08:56] our faith is based on that
[2:08:59] I'm not safe today because I got down at
[2:09:04] the altar and cry
[2:09:09] I'm sad because the word of God tells me
[2:09:16] I'm safe
[2:09:21] praise the Lord amen
[2:09:23] amen amen amen amen I'm saved because
[2:09:26] the word of God tells me

[2:09:40] praise the Lord
[2:09:41] amen
[2:09:43] I take that word and pour my heart and I
[2:09:47] believe it
[2:09:48] that God word is truth
[2:09:58] Satan can whip me in around
[2:10:01] anywhere on how you feel
[2:10:06] that's a big statement
[2:10:12] because we have all of these Auto calls
[2:10:15] which of course that was those were
[2:10:17] things that was introduced in the time
[2:10:19] of uh of the reformation and uh when the
[2:10:23] Wesley brothers were out uh uh you know
[2:10:26] they go out and preach and and you know
[2:10:28] invite people to come to the altar
[2:10:32] people make those you know those uh uh
[2:10:35] uh sincere move to come to the altar
[2:10:38] praise the Lord they come to the Altar
[2:10:41] and and and the sin of priority said and
[2:10:44] I received Jesus I received Jesus Lord
[2:10:46] Jesus Lord Jesus forgive me of my sin
[2:10:49] forgive me of my sin now the the do all
[2:10:52] of that
[2:10:54] and they go away from the meeting
[2:10:56] believing that I've accepted Jesus
[2:11:00] praise the Lord when I try to walk the
[2:11:03] dead is that they just repeated what
[2:11:05] that preacher said
[2:11:07] but in reality never believed it to take
[2:11:09] it to their heart
[2:11:13] praise the Lord because when you take
[2:11:16] the word to your heart
[2:11:24] glory be to God oh we're not getting rid
[2:11:27] of also called nor we will not get rid
[2:11:29] of it as long as the gospel will be
[2:11:31] preached people will still come to the
[2:11:34] Altar and we say come to the altar we
[2:11:37] will stand with you
[2:11:40] because this is the place where sin dies
[2:11:44] and this is your tombstone
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:48] glory be to God
[2:11:50] Hallelujah
[2:11:54] but you have an altar that's what we
[2:11:56] want to address this morning
[2:11:59] because many people sit right there they
[2:12:02] said under the word young and old people
[2:12:07] and they are dealing with habits and
[2:12:09] things in their life that is destroying
[2:12:11] them
[2:12:12] and they sit right there
[2:12:15] the devil create a state of comfort for
[2:12:19] them
[2:12:20] because they have heard this thing over
[2:12:22] and over and over
[2:12:25] praise the Lord
[2:12:28] and it says I received Jesus Christ as
[2:12:30] my Lord and Savior it is just up here
[2:12:32] and you have not taken that word down to
[2:12:36] the altar because when the word gets to
[2:12:38] the altar
[2:12:39] it break the curse
[2:12:43] praise the Lord when thou word when that
[2:12:46] prom
[2:12:52] PT they break the curse
[2:12:56] you find people in church struggling
[2:12:58] with habits on clean habits and all
[2:13:01] sorts of things
[2:13:02] anyway and we can just fix it on a
[2:13:04] religion
[2:13:07] praise the Lord if we believe that God
[2:13:09] can heal cancer and we believe that God
[2:13:12] can raise the dead don't you believe
[2:13:14] that God can break your sin habit
[2:13:17] [Applause]
[2:13:21] praise the Lord if we believe that God
[2:13:24] the god that we are saving serving that
[2:13:27] one day he will call us from the Dust
[2:13:30] and we will resurrect how much more
[2:13:33] being in this body
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:37] what is it that we are dealing with that
[2:13:39] he cannot Deliver Us from
[2:13:44] amen
[2:13:48] what is it
[2:13:51] that we are dealing with that he cannot
[2:13:53] Deliver Us from
[2:13:57] now we must create comfort
[2:13:59] and go to the Grave with our sin
[2:14:03] go to the Grave with our habit God has
[2:14:06] defeated believers
[2:14:12] why is it that he can Deliver Us from
[2:14:22] are we together
[2:14:26] praise the Lord
[2:14:30] show us the father look King and Abel
[2:14:33] both of them
[2:14:34] wanted to worship God and King he built
[2:14:37] an altar to God now
[2:14:39] if an altar is all that God required
[2:14:42] King was justified
[2:14:45] and King made an altar upon he made a
[2:14:48] sacrifice upon the altar is that right
[2:14:51] well if a sacrifice and an altar is all
[2:14:54] that God wanted a king was justified
[2:14:58] then King also built an altar
[2:15:01] and he worshiped
[2:15:02] praise the Lord
[2:15:04] he put a sacrifice upon it he knelt down
[2:15:06] he worshiped but God
[2:15:09] was displeased
[2:15:12] because he didn't come
[2:15:14] the right way
[2:15:18] are we together
[2:15:22] amen
[2:15:24] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:15:28] today
[2:15:30] and forever

[2:16:19] grab the concept of where we're going
[2:16:21] this morning
[2:16:23] praise the Lord
[2:16:25] God designed it that way
[2:16:27] he pulled the altar on the mountain of
[2:16:31] curse because that's what it would take
[2:16:35] praise the Lord that's what it would
[2:16:38] take

[2:16:46] the mouse on the mountain of Garrison
[2:16:50] the mountain of blessing

[2:17:13] second
[2:17:17] it's his desire it's his nature
[2:17:20] that's what he is he's a good god he's a
[2:17:23] God that blesses his people
[2:17:31] it is man in that little narrow minds
[2:17:34] are things that were because I did this
[2:17:36] that's why God blessed me because I did
[2:17:38] this that's why God blessed me because I
[2:17:40] did this that's why God blessed me
[2:17:43] we try to line up all the good things
[2:17:45] while we are while we have been blessed
[2:17:48] right
[2:17:50] praise the Lord
[2:17:53] the Bible says even His blessings fought
[2:17:55] upon the just and the unjust
[2:17:59] he pour it down because that's the kind
[2:18:01] of a God he is
[2:18:03] his desire is to bless us
[2:18:16] if we will be in the right condition
[2:18:18] to enjoy those blessings
[2:18:22] for many things that have come from the
[2:18:24] hand of God to men they have used those
[2:18:26] very things to enslave themselves
[2:18:30] many things that have come from the
[2:18:32] hands of God to men
[2:18:34] they have used those very things to
[2:18:37] enslave themselves
[2:18:41] they have used those very things to
[2:18:43] bring curses upon themselves
[2:18:53] he said so to enjoy the blessings of God
[2:18:56] that flows down from Van Garrison
[2:19:00] we must have an experience
[2:19:03] of the altar
[2:19:07] that's what the church needs that's what
[2:19:09] the people of God needs young people
[2:19:11] meet it to have an experience of the
[2:19:15] altar where the curse is dead with
[2:19:24] because if the curse is not there with
[2:19:26] no matter what flows from the hands of
[2:19:28] God to you

[2:19:47] church
[2:19:50] that's where little boys that were in
[2:19:51] church singing gospel songs
[2:19:55] born with those gifts
[2:20:00] praise the Lord
[2:20:03] but they never took it to the altar
[2:20:08] they never took it to the Altar for the
[2:20:10] curse to be destroyed
[2:20:14] praise the Lord I'll tell you about
[2:20:16] another singer
[2:20:18] he used to be one of my favorite singer
[2:20:21] rebirth
[2:20:22] he signed a sunk
[2:20:24] that I was also going to sink
[2:20:27] but the gift of singing has not come yet
[2:20:30] praise the Lord amen I don't know where
[2:20:32] my gift for singing has gone these days
[2:20:35] amen it's coming thank you sister praise
[2:20:38] the Lord Rebel sang a song
[2:20:41] that he entitled that's what the author
[2:20:44] is for
[2:20:46] it was a very good good singer I pledge
[2:20:49] allegiance and many of these other songs
[2:20:52] he he sang it for us we enjoy singing it
[2:20:55] and let me tell you sometimes people get
[2:20:58] people get so so uh across in their mind
[2:21:02] inspiration is a powerful thing
[2:21:06] amen inspiration is a powerful thing
[2:21:10] when a inspiration comes on the drunk
[2:21:14] he will quote you from Genesis to
[2:21:17] revelation
[2:21:18] but yet it has nothing to do
[2:21:20] with what is happening
[2:21:22] in his soul
[2:21:25] if the curse is not breaking you will
[2:21:27] take those very thank and drag yourself
[2:21:30] to hell
[2:21:34] Rebels used to sink and then over the
[2:21:36] years he was married he have had
[2:21:38] children and all of that but he was
[2:21:40] struggling
[2:21:43] he was struggling with a homosexual life
[2:21:47] and after he came out and and uh and and
[2:21:50] and then he you know they say come out
[2:21:52] of the closet I don't know whether they
[2:21:53] were there and all of that but after all
[2:21:56] of that this was what he said
[2:21:59] he said when he sang that song this is
[2:22:02] what the author is for
[2:22:06] in his mind every time he would go to
[2:22:10] the altar
[2:22:11] and pray he will ask God
[2:22:15] take this from me
[2:22:21] but he realized that he will come to the
[2:22:23] Altar and then he goes back
[2:22:26] and the desire is still with him
[2:22:30] praise the Lord why you see because he
[2:22:33] was looking at a willing Altar and now I
[2:22:37] realized there was an altar in his heart
[2:22:39] where he needed the sacrifice to be
[2:22:42] where he needed the curse to be
[2:22:44] destroyed
[2:22:45] [Applause]
[2:22:49] and people bring
[2:22:52] they are enslaving Habit to church they
[2:22:55] said right there they look in your face
[2:22:57] and go right through those doors right
[2:23:00] back into the habit
[2:23:07] he said every time I would cry I said
[2:23:10] God take this from me
[2:23:14] and then he will go back
[2:23:16] right into the same habit
