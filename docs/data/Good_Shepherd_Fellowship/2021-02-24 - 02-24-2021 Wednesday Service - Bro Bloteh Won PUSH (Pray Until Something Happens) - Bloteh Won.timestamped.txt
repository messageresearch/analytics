[25:34] for our scripture reading
[25:40] we greet you all once again in the name
[25:42] of the lord jesus
[25:44] and uh all of you saints that are also
[25:47] streaming online
[25:49] we agree to you in jesus name
[25:52] amen let's take isaiah i 37
[26:11] let's just read the first three verses
[26:14] and then
[26:14] we can have you see and we might just
[26:18] make some few commentary
[26:21] some quotes of the prophet and then we
[26:23] can
[26:25] find a place to pray tonight and it came
[26:28] to pass
[26:29] when king hezekiah heard it
[26:34] that he ran his claws and covered
[26:37] himself
[26:38] with sackcloth and went into the house
[26:41] of the lord and he said
[26:45] alaikum who was over
[26:49] the household and shep nathan's tribe
[26:53] and the others of the priests
[26:56] covered with cycles unto
[27:00] isaiah the prophet the son of hemos
[27:04] and this and this said unto him thus
[27:06] said
[27:07] hezekiah this day is the date of trouble
[27:13] and of rebuke and of
[27:17] blood's fame
[27:20] that's the three things that we will see
[27:22] in uh
[27:23] in the message that rafshikkha brought
[27:27] but let's just read and then we can have
[27:30] a seat
[27:31] this date is the date of trouble and of
[27:33] rebuke
[27:34] and of blasphemy for the children i
[27:38] come to the birth and there is now
[27:41] strength
[27:43] to bring forth let us pray
[27:46] heavenly father lord jesus
[27:50] father we want to approach you tonight
[27:53] lord and
[27:53] using your word as a talking your
[27:56] prophet taught us lord we must present
[27:58] the talking
[27:59] because you will hear our voice through
[28:03] the word through the blood through the
[28:06] bleeding word so god we
[28:08] use these verses tonight we can say of
[28:11] ourselves lord
[28:12] here we are we have come to the birth
[28:15] and we need strength from you
[28:17] to bring forth bless the service tonight
[28:21] in jesus name we pray amen the lord
[28:24] bless you you can have your seed
[28:28] so we would just uh make few comment
[28:32] here
[28:33] like i said i think you will see
[28:37] sometimes that
[28:39] uh i coming and just we go right into
[28:43] praying
[28:44] and then have the brothers coming or
[28:47] if i would have to preach and then we
[28:49] pray
[28:50] tonight i decided that we'll just talk a
[28:53] little bit
[28:55] set a stage here and then we can go
[28:58] into praying tonight
[29:04] the children i come to the birth
[29:08] and there is not strength to bring forth
[29:12] what what an inspiration
[29:15] what what uh uh
[29:19] what a parable now remember them this
[29:22] was hezekiah
[29:24] and he became king after ayab
[29:28] and uh he was the one that destroyed all
[29:30] the
[29:31] all the the idols and the different
[29:34] things that they have built
[29:36] and uh but before we go
[29:40] into this let's let's just go back a
[29:42] little bit
[29:43] you will see in chapter 36 at first i
[29:47] thought i was going to ask
[29:48] our sisters in the sound room to play
[29:50] the entire chapter for us
[29:52] but you can go home and read it it would
[29:55] take uh it would take up our praying
[29:56] time
[29:57] now so uh what happened here is that
[30:01] uh uh uh the assyrians the king of asira
[30:07] uh
[30:11] senator on to the king
[30:14] of israel now when he
[30:18] came there are few things that are very
[30:20] you know
[30:21] very uh important year
[30:25] when he came he started to speak
[30:28] in the hebrew language you know
[30:32] he started to speak in the hebrew
[30:34] language now
[30:35] you have to you have to watch the same
[30:38] year
[30:39] israel had three captivities
[30:42] their first was in egypt their second
[30:46] captivity was
[30:47] in uh assyria
[30:51] was in assyria now now uh
[30:55] doing the air captivity in assyria
[30:58] that was were the mistress of
[31:01] of uh the jews and and the gentiles
[31:05] makes that produce the samaritans that's
[31:08] where the samaritans
[31:10] lost their identity and they became
[31:13] almost a separate people uh from from
[31:16] the children of israel
[31:18] so uh uh during that time
[31:23] the israel the the israelites learned
[31:26] the the assyrian language and the
[31:29] assyrians also learned the hebrew
[31:31] language
[31:32] now so uh this
[31:35] commanding general came to represent his
[31:38] king
[31:39] and then let's read a little bit chapter
[31:44] 36 now they came to pass in the 14th
[31:46] year
[31:47] of king hezekiah that cena sheriff the
[31:51] king
[31:52] of uh of assyria came
[31:55] up against all the defense city of judah
[32:00] and took them and the king of assyria
[32:03] sent
[32:03] ravshika from
[32:07] lashes to jerusalem on to
[32:10] king hezekiah with a great army and he
[32:14] stood by the conduct of the
[32:18] upper pole in the highway of the
[32:21] fall of field then came forth
[32:24] unto him elect him
[32:28] hit higher son which was over the house
[32:32] and shepna the strife and joao assaf
[32:36] son the recorder and
[32:41] said unto them say now say you now to
[32:44] hezekiah
[32:46] said the great king of assyria
[32:50] what confidence is this
[32:53] wherein that trusted let's underline
[32:56] there because this whole battle
[32:59] is going to be where your trust is
[33:04] he's uh he's going to he's challenging
[33:07] where their trust is
[33:11] and and i think uh that is where we are
[33:14] as believers amen
[33:17] where your trust is and then he go
[33:20] on and he talks a little bit there
[33:25] verse 7 but if they say to me we trust
[33:28] in the lord
[33:29] our god it is not he whose high
[33:33] places and whose author hezekiah has
[33:37] taken away
[33:38] now what happened here is that
[33:42] because ahab has built all these idols
[33:46] places
[33:47] in down in belton and all of these
[33:49] places he has built
[33:50] over the over the reign of ahab the
[33:54] the nations around uh israel
[33:57] have come to understand that this was
[34:01] a way of washing so hezekiah coming down
[34:05] and breaking down those strands
[34:09] rashika is saying this that if you are
[34:12] trusting in god
[34:14] hezekiah has breakdown his shrine the
[34:17] high places
[34:18] and he never did anything how can you
[34:20] trust in a god
[34:22] that would not do something when a man
[34:24] has come
[34:25] and distraught uh things that were built
[34:29] in his name
[34:32] so what happened here the church has
[34:35] misrepresented god until the people of
[34:37] the world
[34:38] are thinking that this is the true way
[34:41] of worship
[34:44] because israel has gone out of there now
[34:47] so he said if you are trusting in god
[34:49] is it not the god whose uh high places
[34:52] that hezekiah had destroyed
[34:54] what have you done about it how can you
[34:56] trust in the god like that
[34:57] right
[35:01] who are you trusting
[35:05] are we together amen
[35:14] now so he goes ahead
[35:19] now let's drop down to verse 10.
[35:23] so i'll skip a little bit and i'm
[35:27] and am i not come up without
[35:30] the lord against this land to destroy
[35:34] the lord said unto me go up against
[35:37] this land and destroy then said
[35:41] i like him and shapna and
[35:44] draw on to rashika speak
[35:48] i pray thee onto that seven
[35:51] in the syrian language for we
[35:54] understand it and speak now to
[35:58] us in the jews language
[36:02] in the years of the people that are
[36:06] on the wall now you know as i was
[36:09] as i was meditating upon this
[36:15] it is not that
[36:18] rashika didn't know what he was doing
[36:24] he purposely spoke in the jewish
[36:28] language
[36:29] to intimidate the people
[36:34] he was speaking and speaking very loud
[36:37] so the people around can hear it and
[36:40] everybody can go to their home
[36:42] and it can become the subject of the
[36:44] night you hear what happened you hear
[36:46] what
[36:46] what went on today and somebody said you
[36:48] heard you heard you heard
[36:50] and what i was thinking about that today
[36:55] i said i i i i tried to
[36:59] to bring bring it into into perspective
[37:02] of what we are dealing with in our age
[37:05] the devil has allowed people to put
[37:08] things on the internet
[37:10] about the message about brother branham
[37:13] and
[37:14] [Music]
[37:17] and it's it's a language of
[37:21] intimidation
[37:25] if you don't have the kind of revelation
[37:28] that uh uh we will talk about yet a
[37:31] little bit
[37:33] but that that is certain tactics
[37:39] when goliath came to challenge israel
[37:43] yes he never had a meeting with saul
[37:46] that's right he waited when the town was
[37:50] fought
[37:53] and he stood and yelled and got
[37:55] everybody attention
[37:58] and said look let us not share blood
[38:02] you'll choose one man to come and meet
[38:05] me
[38:08] if he beat me you're rude us
[38:12] if i beat him we rule you people
[38:15] but the reason why he was talking this
[38:19] was to plan fear in the hearts of the
[38:22] people
[38:24] all those that listened to that
[38:27] children parents
[38:32] if your father now cannot correct his
[38:34] child
[38:36] why why why you want to whip me for
[38:37] goliath somebody should do it
[38:41] okay let's get back to what we've been
[38:43] talking about
[38:50] but it's a message of intimidation
[38:55] it's a message of intimidation and i
[38:58] believe that's what the devil is doing
[39:02] you know people
[39:07] you know bomb into this uh
[39:10] website and listening to things and
[39:12] listening to people so it's what i've
[39:14] been following the message 40 years
[39:16] this is the reason why i left the
[39:17] message you know and
[39:19] and because of this and because of this
[39:22] and then with your young faith you sit
[39:24] there and say well this man been
[39:25] following this thing for 40 years
[39:28] i just believe the message for five
[39:30] years
[39:31] or 10 years you know
[39:34] what is the need and what happened there
[39:37] is that as long as you have listened to
[39:39] that
[39:39] the devil going to buck you all those
[39:42] that are listening to this message from
[39:44] rashika never slept
[39:46] right they never slept husband and wife
[39:50] started packing their things
[39:53] why because as uh assyria
[39:56] was a superpower at that time
[40:01] they have they have come against all the
[40:03] defense city that's what the scriptures
[40:05] say
[40:05] egypt all the major cities that was
[40:08] around them he said you can't even
[40:10] depend on egypt
[40:13] ask them what we did to them that's
[40:16] right
[40:18] praise the lord so families started
[40:22] packing their lord
[40:23] where they would go they don't know
[40:24] about let's pack because what we have
[40:27] heard
[40:29] trouble is in the camp the children has
[40:32] come to the birth
[40:34] and there is no strength
[40:41] praise the lord
[40:45] now so you you can you go home and read
[40:47] the rest of the
[40:49] the the chapter you will get a full
[40:51] picture here
[40:54] but uh uh
[40:59] as you look into this like i said
[41:03] the challenge here was in whom do you
[41:05] trust
[41:07] you know uh rashika was trying to tell
[41:11] them you can't trust
[41:12] in egypt because we have whipped him
[41:15] you can trust in god because hezekiah
[41:18] has destroyed
[41:19] all his place of worship now those days
[41:22] the nations the power of a nation was
[41:26] determined
[41:27] by the god itself
[41:32] amen praise the lord
[41:36] amen to show that uh uh i mean you were
[41:39] a a nation was was powerful you know uh
[41:43] uh
[41:43] uh even even the even though even the
[41:46] nations that were worshiping the idols
[41:48] believed that it was the the gods that
[41:51] was giving them the power
[41:57] praise the lord
[42:02] that's the reason why the philistines in
[42:04] the book of first king
[42:05] when he hear the israel shouting and
[42:08] rejoicing
[42:09] they said it's because god is in the
[42:11] account
[42:15] praise the lord now so as we look at
[42:18] this tonight
[42:20] uh i want i want to dwell on this
[42:23] i'll speak on this but i just want to to
[42:27] just use this to kind of prepare us for
[42:30] praying tonight
[42:32] the children have come to the birth and
[42:33] there is no strength
[42:36] to bring forth now when when
[42:39] when that time reaches you know where
[42:44] life is about to bring forth and the
[42:46] woman is about to give birth
[42:49] there is one language that is common
[42:52] it's a universal language
[42:54] all around the world one thing they will
[42:58] say
[42:59] to the mother is that she should push
[43:05] so i want to use push tonight for the
[43:08] prayer meeting
[43:09] if we will be able to give birth we must
[43:13] push
[43:16] amen amen if we will be able to give
[43:19] birth
[43:21] we must poach and push
[43:26] is pray until something happen
[43:34] pray until something
[43:38] happened if the church will be able to
[43:42] bring forth
[43:44] life in the church will be able to stand
[43:47] as the church of the living god we must
[43:51] pray we must get in the
[43:54] in in in a praying spirit in the praying
[43:58] hobby
[44:00] now i read something here from brother
[44:02] branham in a few minutes
[44:05] and i think let me just read there that
[44:07] we help
[44:09] that's from the message blind by timos
[44:11] 1957
[44:13] he said you know
[44:17] there is something about getting along
[44:19] to yourself
[44:22] many people never prayed until they come
[44:25] to church
[44:27] many people think that's the only place
[44:31] to pray
[44:32] is the church but the bible said
[44:36] for men to pray everywhere
[44:39] lifting up holy hands
[44:42] and then when we get by ourself
[44:46] we are we will usually pray
[44:50] different than when we would if we
[44:53] pray it in church
[44:57] praise the lord because as
[45:00] as as human you always have that sense
[45:04] of the next person around you
[45:07] you know you are praying to god but
[45:09] you're thinking that the next person is
[45:10] listening to you
[45:13] it's always dead so because of that you
[45:16] never
[45:16] get your best time of praying when you
[45:19] are in church
[45:22] and that's the reason why brother
[45:24] branham never encouraged
[45:26] long prayer in church
[45:37] we usually pray different when we when
[45:39] we rule
[45:40] uh than what we would live if we prayed
[45:44] in
[45:44] church is the secret prayer that jesus
[45:48] spoke of
[45:50] saying enter in enter ye into
[45:53] a secret closet and close the door
[45:56] and when you have you have did so pray
[46:00] to your father
[46:02] who sits in secret and
[46:06] he that serious in secret shall reward
[46:08] thee
[46:09] openly and when and when we are praying
[46:13] like that
[46:14] there there seems to to be
[46:18] something to the prayer that take
[46:21] all the hypocrisy out of faith
[46:25] when you are praying in your closet
[46:28] you know it's you alone you know the
[46:30] door is short
[46:32] you can be able to cry you can be able
[46:35] to
[46:36] to to pour your heart before god
[46:39] and say to god what you want to say
[46:42] praise the lord
[46:44] many times when we in the congregation
[46:46] you know
[46:47] i mean you you pray you're pouring your
[46:49] heart out i mean
[46:50] you really want to express yourself but
[46:52] sometimes you end up speaking in tongues
[46:58] you know i mean you just gotta speak in
[47:00] tongues you gotta pray in tongues
[47:02] sometimes but when you are in your
[47:05] closet and the door is shut
[47:07] i mean you can say those things to god
[47:11] amen you can tell him the things that
[47:15] you are dealing with
[47:16] you can be able to say he says it takes
[47:20] all the hypocrisy out of
[47:22] out of it it seems like that we
[47:25] get in a better connection with god
[47:30] to get along
[47:34] and there's been many times in my life
[47:39] as perhaps in your life that you just
[47:41] have to get
[47:42] along once in a while with jesus
[47:46] i've took my card and drove down the
[47:49] road and just
[47:50] studying after after i got on the
[47:53] highway where
[47:54] it is freed and got off somewhere some
[47:57] country road
[47:58] until i will become so filled with his
[48:01] mercy
[48:02] and his goodness do i just stop the car
[48:06] and held the wheel and whipped like a
[48:08] baby
[48:09] oh i'd identify with that amen praise
[48:12] the lord
[48:14] glory be to god but what we want to talk
[48:17] about tonight
[48:19] is uh prayed until some
[48:22] until something happened so i'm going to
[48:24] take a few calls
[48:25] brother brandon talk about pray don't
[48:27] tell and
[48:28] uh just to be able to encourage us
[48:31] tonight
[48:32] and then uh if the laws uh allow us we
[48:35] talk on on the on the subject
[48:37] when we when we get there but that's
[48:40] that's what happened you know when we
[48:43] get to that time of birth
[48:45] and uh and and the mother cannot be able
[48:48] to bring forth
[48:50] uh
[48:53] the midwives who says
[48:56] push praise the lord amen
[49:00] and uh and i want to be in the place of
[49:03] the midwife tonight just like the place
[49:06] of a woman i want to bring photo
[49:08] and tell you let's push let's pray until
[49:11] things happen in our lives
[49:14] praise the lord amen amen
[49:18] led by the spirit brother branham says
[49:20] did you ever
[49:21] get down and prayed until
[49:24] it comes to a place that
[49:28] you feel like you are walking on clouds
[49:34] prayed until
[49:38] have you ever got down
[49:42] you prayed until
[49:46] and to get to that to that until i mean
[49:49] the devil will not just allow you to get
[49:51] there
[49:52] he won't allow you to get to that place
[49:54] where you will break true
[49:57] you know he will flock your mind with uh
[50:00] i mean things that you forgot to do and
[50:02] things that you have to do and things
[50:04] that you will do and
[50:06] and i mean he would just be bringing all
[50:07] of the things to things that you forgot
[50:09] and
[50:10] you would just keep flooding your mind
[50:12] but you have to keep praying
[50:13] until right now
[50:17] that's the only way we're going to bring
[50:19] for this child
[50:21] we got to pray until
[50:26] that's when you are getting light the
[50:28] bible said
[50:29] in hebrew 11 or chapter 12 seeing
[50:33] that we are compassed about with
[50:36] uh compass about by such a great cloud
[50:40] of witnesses
[50:41] let us lay aside every weight
[50:44] empty up and the scene that does so
[50:47] easily beside us
[50:49] that we might run with patient the race
[50:52] that is set before us
[50:54] looking to the altar and finisher of our
[50:58] faith the lord jesus
[50:59] so you see when we come to this uh
[51:02] wednesday service i mean
[51:03] we are here till nine o'clock 9 30 we
[51:06] should be
[51:07] out and and heading home to rest and get
[51:09] ready
[51:10] i mean we we can stay the whole night
[51:12] you know and
[51:13] and and uh uh and try to work you up and
[51:17] get in
[51:18] in in the spirit when we have that 10
[51:21] minutes of time
[51:22] to pray you got to put your heart to it
[51:24] if you will be able to get anything from
[51:26] out of there you got to put your heart
[51:29] into it praise the lord
[51:35] unless we set up the night for praying
[51:37] since it's all night prayer meeting
[51:39] then we know we can pray and pray and
[51:41] pray an hour and two hours and three
[51:44] hours
[51:44] but when we come to this time it's time
[51:47] where we take
[51:48] we take the prayer burdens that are set
[51:50] before us and
[51:51] and we unite our faith and we just we
[51:54] just jump into it together
[51:59] praise the lord but you see these things
[52:02] are difficult
[52:03] to achieve if we don't have
[52:06] our individual prayer life
[52:13] we don't have our individual prayer life
[52:15] if we're not spending time to pray
[52:17] and you come wednesday night it would
[52:19] just look like
[52:21] what kind of a prayer meeting is that
[52:25] that is what it is to you
[52:31] because people that have a that have a
[52:33] prayer life they are already connected
[52:36] let's buy our heads and pray that they
[52:38] are connected the fire is packed and
[52:40] they are gone
[52:43] gave them five minutes to pray they're
[52:45] able to get in their spirit and get that
[52:47] thing done
[52:50] if you don't have a prayer life your
[52:51] mind will just be running all over the
[52:53] place and all floating around
[52:59] and there's no time for that
[53:03] we have a man child christ to bring
[53:05] forth
[53:11] praise the lord
[53:17] are we together amen
[53:21] let's take one again why christ speak
[53:24] brother brandon we're talking about the
[53:25] tabernacle he says one thing
[53:27] that a tabernacle needs update at the
[53:30] church
[53:32] at the tabernacle is a rededication
[53:36] and a refilling of the holy ghost
[53:39] everyone to get
[53:41] down to the altar and pray
[53:45] until they
[53:48] get a renewing of the holy ghost
[53:52] the whole church be filled with the
[53:55] power of god
[53:59] that's what the church needs
[54:03] that's what he promised will be the
[54:05] dynamics of this
[54:06] church it's a refilling of the holy
[54:09] ghost
[54:11] praise the lord i mean people
[54:14] want to to you know we have i mean we we
[54:18] can talk about the mysteries and we can
[54:20] talk about
[54:21] you know uh everything that the
[54:23] scripture says everything that the
[54:24] message says
[54:26] i mean uh they will not they will not
[54:29] have a great deal to our life
[54:31] if we are not on speaking terms with god
[54:37] praise the lord amen you know what it is
[54:41] when you're not on speaking terms with
[54:42] somebody
[54:47] i mean you see them you just you says hi
[54:49] they say hiding and you keep thinking
[54:51] what next should i say
[54:53] when you are on speaking terms with
[54:54] somebody you don't think what mess to
[54:56] say
[54:57] you have the liberty to say anything oh
[54:59] i like your shoes
[55:01] what are you being up to you just break
[55:04] out it's just flowing because you are in
[55:06] speaking terms
[55:19] praise the lord
[55:24] personal experiences is prayed until
[55:28] a personal a personal experience
[55:33] burned down into
[55:37] the hema heart and burned
[55:40] out all the darkness
[55:43] and gave a new vision
[55:47] amen we want to pray until
[55:53] something happened
[55:58] and we can go on and on and on
[56:04] uh yeah
[56:10] conference with god or conference 1960
[56:13] he says
[56:14] we need the need of the church tonight
[56:18] is a conference a prayer meeting
[56:22] a get-together called together
[56:25] ministers break down their their middle
[56:27] water petition
[56:28] church member get a church member that's
[56:32] all forget
[56:33] the differences between the
[56:36] denominations of churches
[56:37] church members ministers whole to the
[56:40] homes of the altar
[56:42] this hole to the horns of the altar has
[56:44] been mine mine
[56:46] my slogging and when i talk with the
[56:50] brothers
[56:51] he says brother one how are you i'm
[56:53] holding to the hands of the altar
[56:56] so actually when i was studying and i
[56:58] saw brother branham say this i just felt
[57:00] so good in my heart
[57:04] praise the lord hold to the hands of the
[57:08] altar
[57:09] we've won a call and prayed until
[57:14] the fire of god begin to fall
[57:20] praise the lord
[57:24] when
[57:27] we come to that place of the birth i
[57:30] i've talked about that when i'm talking
[57:32] on the subject
[57:33] just uh i just want to encourage you
[57:35] tonight
[57:36] and use these uh
[57:40] cults and
[57:43] prepared ourselves to pray
[57:46] tonight
[57:49] but
[57:53] i mean the the male wife the surgeon the
[57:57] doctor
[57:58] all of them that are there they are
[58:01] there as a support team
[58:04] they're there to encourage you
[58:09] a lot of the work will be done
[58:13] by the mother
[58:17] praise the lord amen
[58:21] and and i think uh
[58:24] that's what uh
[58:27] we need to do that's what we we we try
[58:30] to encourage ourselves to do
[58:34] is now to uh kind of
[58:37] establish a new order or whatever but
[58:40] i just felt in my heart especially with
[58:42] everything that we've been dealing with
[58:45] since the past year with this uh uh
[58:48] you know kovac i think and the many
[58:52] families that we know that uh
[58:56] believers as well as
[58:59] relatives as well as friends that have
[59:01] been dealing with this
[59:03] i believe in in in a time of
[59:06] sadness in a time of sorrow and and
[59:10] when we have all of these things the
[59:13] best way to keep balance
[59:17] is to have a time of prayer
[59:22] when we get to the place where we don't
[59:24] understand we don't we don't have
[59:26] answers
[59:27] for all of our questions the best thing
[59:31] to do
[59:31] is to pray
[59:35] is to pray
[59:40] and when you can just just break through
[59:42] and get
[59:43] into that atmosphere
[59:48] praise the lord
[59:52] what a comfort what a strength
[59:57] it brings musicians you can come for
[1:00:00] tonight
[1:00:05] we will do the preaching
[1:00:08] when the time to preach comes
[1:00:21] that's one thing you have to you learn
[1:00:24] with believers
[1:00:26] you know how to pull from a preacher
[1:00:29] so if you don't want to preach your
[1:00:30] message don't get talking
[1:00:35] because pretty soon they can stop
[1:00:36] pulling you into your inspiration
[1:00:40] so i don't want to preach tonight i just
[1:00:43] want for us to find a time to pray amen
[1:00:46] whatever time that is given to us let's
[1:00:49] pray
[1:00:50] until something happened believing that
[1:00:53] something will happen
[1:00:54] there is one other portion of the
[1:00:56] scripture that i want to read
[1:00:58] tonight
[1:01:01] is this
[1:01:05] verse 14 of chapter 37 the bible says
[1:01:09] year
[1:01:10] when hezekiah received the letter
[1:01:14] verse 14 and hezekiah received a letter
[1:01:19] from the hands of the messenger
[1:01:23] and read it and hezekiah went up
[1:01:26] unto the house of the lord
[1:01:30] and he spread the letter before god
[1:01:34] praise the lord oh i believe that those
[1:01:38] are some of
[1:01:39] those are some of the all-time ways
[1:01:42] the old-time christians they will take
[1:01:45] their bills
[1:01:46] and spread it before the lord they will
[1:01:49] take the doctor
[1:01:50] paper is spread it before the lord
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:59] if they have a court case they will take
[1:02:02] it and just spread it before the lord
[1:02:03] and say you are the judge
[1:02:05] i bring this matter to you
[1:02:08] hezekiah took that took the letter open
[1:02:11] the envelope
[1:02:12] rip it he was he didn't care to read
[1:02:16] what it is
[1:02:19] just look over it
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:23] but he knew that if he put it before god
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:29] and sometimes it's the thing that
[1:02:35] we learn to do sometimes when you just
[1:02:38] don't have words to say
[1:02:40] just write it down write god a letter he
[1:02:43] can read
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:47] or the prophet god never knew how to
[1:02:49] pray he just wrote a few piece of letter
[1:02:51] lord
[1:02:53] i don't know you but if you are here i
[1:02:56] stick this note right here
[1:03:02] those things are not just done casually
[1:03:04] they are done with burden
[1:03:05] there was there was heaviness on his
[1:03:07] heart
[1:03:09] heaviness on his heart there is a need
[1:03:12] the children
[1:03:13] have come to the birth and there is no
[1:03:16] strength
[1:03:19] so he took the letter went to the house
[1:03:23] of god
[1:03:23] [Music]
[1:03:25] and he lay before the altar
[1:03:31] [Music]
