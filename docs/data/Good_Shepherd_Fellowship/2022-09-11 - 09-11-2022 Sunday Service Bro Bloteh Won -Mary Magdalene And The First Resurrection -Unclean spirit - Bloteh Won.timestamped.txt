[49:10] let's go right into the word this
[49:12] morning
[49:14] praise the Lord
[49:18] I have a
[49:19] a kind of a strange
[49:24] title this morning
[49:32] remember for Wednesday night we were
[49:33] talking a little bit there on
[49:36] on uh
[49:40] uh we were talking there on on unclean
[49:43] spirit
[49:51] praise the Lord
[50:05] amen
[50:07] let me let me look at Luke 24
[50:11] uh I'm just I'm kind of looking
[50:14] looking for a description of what
[50:19] what my inspiration will be
[50:33] okay Luke said it a different way
[50:38] looks at a different way I think
[50:42] Mark Harvey the way that my mind is
[50:46] looking at it
[50:52] now that's that's the resurrection
[50:54] morning
[50:56] that's the resurrection morning uh uh
[50:59] that's the resurrection morning
[51:00] scripture I'm looking at you'll find
[51:04] that in Matthew 28th
[51:07] and then you find it in mocking and all
[51:10] of the the the the gospels the apostles
[51:14] they have a they have a different way
[51:17] that uh that they introduce this subject
[51:22] they have a different way that they
[51:24] introduced this subject but one of them
[51:26] brought it out in a way that that caught
[51:28] my attention last night and made me to
[51:31] change my subject I want to speak on
[51:33] this morning I want to speak on Mary
[51:35] Magdalene and the first resurrection
[51:39] Mary Magdalene and the first
[51:41] resurrection
[51:43] praise the Lord
[51:45] now you have to realize that the first
[51:48] resurrection is a rapture
[51:50] amen when John talks about the Rapture
[51:53] in the Book of Revelation he calls that
[51:55] the first resurrection
[51:57] and uh and then Mary Magdalene was was
[52:02] one of the lady
[52:04] uh there was
[52:07] that was first
[52:09] at the throne amen
[52:11] one of the first one that Jesus spoke to
[52:16] so
[52:20] I was I was looking at uh
[52:24] on clean Spirit last night continuing my
[52:28] studies on it trying to find a way uh to
[52:32] be able to bring it out
[52:36] uh so let's let's use Mac let's use Mac
[52:39] chapter 16. let's use the way that Mike
[52:43] brought it out
[52:48] because the reason is that you will see
[52:51] it when we read it
[52:53] you will you will soon grab
[52:56] uh word I was I was struggling all
[52:59] through the night
[53:02] okay yeah Mark Mark chapter 16 verse 9
[53:06] Mark chapter 16 verse 9.
[53:12] Mark chapter 16 verse 9.
[53:17] we'll read that one verse and then you
[53:19] have your seat and then we will start
[53:22] digging into the word amen praise the
[53:25] Lord I hope you brought your shovel and

[55:49] morning
[55:50] let's go right into the word
[55:52] this morning
[55:54] and Mayor Michael Lane
[55:56] and the first resurrection
[56:00] some years back I preached this message
[56:03] in a different way than I entitled to a
[56:05] little Magdalene in the seventh Church
[56:07] age because I was typing the seven uh
[56:12] Devils that was cast out of her to
[56:14] represent the seventh Church age but I'm
[56:17] going to we're going to approach it in a
[56:19] different way this morning dealing with
[56:22] unclean spirit
[56:24] and uh Wednesday night we read a quote
[56:28] from the message their house I want to
[56:31] go right into that this morning brother
[56:33] Brandon says concerning the three
[56:35] unclean spirit that come out of
[56:37] Revelation come out of the mouth of the
[56:41] false prophet and the dragon uh and the
[56:44] Beast now if you go to Revelation there
[56:47] there there are three that were named
[56:49] the false prophet the dragon and the
[56:52] Beast
[56:53] out of that came the the three unclean
[56:56] spirit so uh uh
[57:00] the the false prophet the Beast and the
[57:04] dragon are the uh the the influence
[57:09] behind this unclean spirit
[57:12] that is that came out like frogs
[57:15] the false prophet the dragon and the
[57:18] Beast praise the Lord amen
[57:22] you have to realize that Beast is a
[57:24] power
[57:25] every time it's used in The Book of
[57:27] Revelation it's a power
[57:30] and uh the false prophet is the mouth
[57:36] through which their Spirit come out the
[57:40] dragon is the system
[57:43] foreign
[57:44] so the system has the power
[57:47] and it has a man that he uses
[57:53] there is no spirit that is powerful
[57:55] unless you have a body
[57:59] Spirits are just rumbling until a
[58:01] culture a body
[58:03] it can never manifest its power
[58:08] are we together
[58:11] now so uh uh here we see the as as we
[58:16] approach this and uh
[58:20] brother Stephen wolves can you please
[58:21] come help me yeah
[58:28] praise the Lord so as we see this you
[58:32] will you will realize uh
[58:34] bring look in that big boss bring my
[58:37] glasses for me please
[58:42] the three unclean spirit
[58:45] Brahm says here
[58:48] is the three isms and we look at that on
[58:52] Wednesday night
[58:54] let me type it for you now and you will
[58:58] and you will see where it starts where
[59:00] it begins there was communism uh Fascism
[59:05] and Nazism he says in in uh
[59:09] they were spirits
[59:12] communism is a spirit it gets on you
[59:16] C is a spirit it will be something like
[59:20] that
[59:21] and then he goes on and and and make us
[59:24] to realize that it comes out of the
[59:28] the
[59:30] it comes out of catalism now so if we
[59:35] look over in uh uh
[59:39] Deuteronomy seven let's go to
[59:41] Deuteronomy seven quickly
[59:52] I told you that you got to get your hand
[59:54] to the soil this morning amen we will
[59:57] dig in a little bit let's look at verse
[59:59] one there
[1:00:02] there are many places when you read
[1:00:04] about the Nations that uh uh Israel was
[1:00:08] going to to possess or overcome or draft
[1:00:13] out the word the right word is to drive
[1:00:16] out remember we said on Wednesday night
[1:00:19] uh uh
[1:00:23] uh evil spirit
[1:00:25] uh
[1:00:27] uh you can be healed from a sickness let
[1:00:30] me say it this way because I will read
[1:00:32] the scripture in the Bible so you will
[1:00:34] rightly understand it you can be healed
[1:00:36] from it from from a sickness but what
[1:00:40] happened is that the the the holy ghost
[1:00:43] or the law cast out their spirit amen
[1:00:47] because when when when this when the
[1:00:49] spirit possess your body a affects your
[1:00:52] body
[1:00:54] it makes you sick so the Lord have to
[1:00:58] cast out that spirit and heal your body
[1:01:01] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:01:04] you can get sick and feel and get healed
[1:01:07] and get sick again because the spirit is
[1:01:10] cast out
[1:01:12] are you understanding me praise the Lord
[1:01:15] so so so evil spirit uh uh uh uh can can
[1:01:21] be cast out that's what I want to that's
[1:01:24] that's the thought I want you to hold in
[1:01:26] your mind that evil spirit can be cast
[1:01:29] out and that's the reason why just like
[1:01:32] I said from the womb to the Grave our
[1:01:34] greatest battle is to keep the spirit
[1:01:36] out
[1:01:37] is to keep it away from us praise the
[1:01:40] Lord because no matter how you are deep
[1:01:43] in the holy ghost from your hair to your
[1:01:45] told you can still be influenced by evil
[1:01:48] spirit
[1:01:53] are we together
[1:01:55] praise the Lord
[1:01:58] amen I hope you came pray of this
[1:02:01] morning because we we're going to stir
[1:02:03] the waters amen
[1:02:05] praise the Lord we're going to stir the
[1:02:07] waters don't don't sleep under me this
[1:02:09] morning you might get yourself in a in a
[1:02:12] kind of uh
[1:02:13] a bad bad shape praise the Lord
[1:02:17] okay yeah we'll manage we'll become a
[1:02:21] one-hour preacher
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:27] praise the Lord now so if you look here
[1:02:29] in Deuteronomy chapter 7 you will see
[1:02:32] when the Lord
[1:02:34] when the Lord thy God shall bring thee
[1:02:37] into the land
[1:02:38] whether thy goeth to possess it
[1:02:42] there and have cast out many nations
[1:02:47] before thee and have cast out I want you
[1:02:51] to see that word cast out they were to
[1:02:54] drive them out
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:57] and then and if even Moses told them
[1:03:00] don't drop them out at once
[1:03:03] possess the land little by little
[1:03:07] because if you drive them out at once
[1:03:10] the White Beast would come and consume
[1:03:12] you
[1:03:13] now what I want you to watch here is
[1:03:16] that the Nations that were going to be
[1:03:20] uh uh uh cast out
[1:03:23] there were seven right here
[1:03:27] that we need
[1:03:30] there were Seven Nations that were named
[1:03:35] now Jesus
[1:03:38] Matthew chapter 12 when he talks to
[1:03:41] Israel we will get there because Matthew
[1:03:43] chapter 12 is a very important John John
[1:03:46] scripture
[1:03:47] when he was talking to to the people uh
[1:03:50] uh after after they call him he is
[1:03:55] casting that evil spirit by vegetable
[1:03:57] he told them that uh
[1:04:03] when an evil spirit goes out
[1:04:08] amen when that evil spirit is cast out
[1:04:12] of a man it goes and room about and goes
[1:04:15] and finds what
[1:04:16] seven are the spirit
[1:04:19] praise the Lord
[1:04:21] amen the way you would think about it is
[1:04:24] that it's one it go find seven other
[1:04:26] Spirit that's the way the human mind
[1:04:27] will think about it no
[1:04:29] is just the same old Spirit increasing
[1:04:32] seven times
[1:04:37] getting stronger because because Jesus
[1:04:40] said it makes the man worse
[1:04:43] than his first state
[1:04:50] are we together
[1:04:53] it makes the man worse than his first
[1:04:56] state
[1:04:58] now so
[1:05:00] brother Brandon is is telling us that
[1:05:02] the the three uh unclean spirit
[1:05:07] he put them on the politics he put them
[1:05:10] on a National Power
[1:05:14] out of all of these uh uh communism in
[1:05:18] fact they were all forms of government
[1:05:21] that rule the word and he says there
[1:05:24] will all be swallow up in communism
[1:05:28] praise the Lord
[1:05:30] which of course is is the great
[1:05:32] influence upon the uh uh uh uh the
[1:05:36] politics of the world today that's the
[1:05:38] reason why Democratic is now working
[1:05:44] why because the influence behind every
[1:05:47] war in the country every disorder in the
[1:05:51] election is a communist spirit
[1:05:54] that is Warren against democracy
[1:06:02] why because the other two has been
[1:06:05] swallowed up by communism
[1:06:11] now so
[1:06:13] this is the way I want you to see it
[1:06:15] just like there were Seven Nations that
[1:06:18] were stopping Israel from getting to her
[1:06:22] promised man
[1:06:24] there are seven Church a spirit
[1:06:30] that is stopping the bride from getting
[1:06:32] to her inheritance
[1:06:35] because uh uh uh
[1:06:37] uh
[1:06:40] how can we overcome brother Branham says
[1:06:43] every age
[1:06:45] gets
[1:06:46] the the the benefit the the blessings or
[1:06:50] the curse from the age in succession
[1:06:54] so everything that was in episode H
[1:06:56] passed down to the next age
[1:07:00] and everything from all the first second
[1:07:03] third fourth fifth Church a sixth Church
[1:07:06] age have come down to this loudly should
[1:07:09] age that's the reason why this age is
[1:07:12] the greatest evil age in the world
[1:07:15] we have more churches and the church is
[1:07:19] in her worst state
[1:07:20] than they have ever been we have great
[1:07:23] Revelation there have never been a time
[1:07:25] in history where the Bible has been on
[1:07:27] it has been so much on this plane we
[1:07:30] have it on our iPhone we have it on the
[1:07:32] iPad we're projected on the war yes we
[1:07:35] read the Bible less than nnh
[1:07:41] it's not because you don't want to read
[1:07:43] the Bible it's because there is an
[1:07:44] influence there is a power there is a
[1:07:47] spirit
[1:07:51] praise the Lord
[1:07:54] there's a power there is a spirit there
[1:07:56] is an influence
[1:08:03] that is down in this Edge
[1:08:09] praise the Lord
[1:08:11] so you see
[1:08:13] it first started as a political power I
[1:08:16] will help you to understand it also when
[1:08:19] God
[1:08:20] gave down there
[1:08:23] the the King nebuchadne has a good dream
[1:08:27] amen now watch now
[1:08:30] when God was about to deal with the Jews
[1:08:34] he gave Pharaoh a dream
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] and Joseph gift interpreted the dream to
[1:08:45] bring the Jews into Egypt
[1:08:49] amen for them to wait for their
[1:08:52] deliverer because God told Abraham that
[1:08:56] after
[1:08:57] 400 years after four generation
[1:09:02] that's why he said over in Genesis
[1:09:06] chapter 15. Genesis chapter 15.
[1:09:11] praise the Lord
[1:09:14] read it with me nor write it down in
[1:09:16] whichever way you want to get your hand
[1:09:18] message just to make your choice
[1:09:21] praise the Lord
[1:09:24] Genesis chapter 15
[1:09:27] uh let's let's see the Promise dear
[1:09:30] Genesis chapter 15.
[1:09:37] verse 13 and he said to Abraham surely
[1:09:41] nor of surety that the sea shall be a
[1:09:45] stranger in a land that that is not
[1:09:50] theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[1:09:54] shall afflect them 400 years and also
[1:09:59] that Nation whom they shall serve our
[1:10:02] George and After All Shall they come out
[1:10:05] with great substance
[1:10:08] and thou shall go to thy father in peace
[1:10:13] that's talking to Abraham now thou shall
[1:10:16] be buried in a good age but in the
[1:10:19] fourth generation
[1:10:22] Isaac
[1:10:24] Jacob
[1:10:25] Levi and Levi give birth to Moses
[1:10:31] the fourth generation
[1:10:39] 4 is the number of Deliverance
[1:10:42] but in the fourth generation they shall
[1:10:45] come hither again
[1:10:48] for the iniquity of the amorites is now
[1:10:51] full yet now so God gave Abraham This
[1:10:55] Promise
[1:10:56] but before the Fulfillment of this
[1:10:59] promise this is the way that God will
[1:11:02] deal with the Jews God gave Abraham a
[1:11:05] promise through whom he become the
[1:11:07] father of many nations but
[1:11:11] the Jewish race have not started yet God
[1:11:15] had not brought a group of people on a
[1:11:17] covenant
[1:11:20] praise the Lord
[1:11:21] now for God to do there what will he do
[1:11:24] he will give Pharaoh a dream
[1:11:28] and he will raise up a boy with a gift
[1:11:32] Joseph that were interpret the dream
[1:11:36] and that interpretation of the dream
[1:11:38] seven year of family seven year of
[1:11:41] surplus it was all to bring
[1:11:44] Jacob and his sons into the promised
[1:11:47] land for this promise to be fulfilled
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:55] God that watch over his word to make
[1:11:59] sure that the promise is fulfilled he
[1:12:01] allowed the boys out of jealousy to to
[1:12:04] say Joseph out
[1:12:07] and Joseph went there he preserved
[1:12:10] Joseph in the house of of of of Spotify
[1:12:14] praise the Lord
[1:12:16] when it was so easy for him to fall on a
[1:12:19] lost
[1:12:20] he could have all of the benefits
[1:12:22] because what if I give him everything he
[1:12:25] have power over everything in the house
[1:12:26] beside the woman
[1:12:30] praise the Lord
[1:12:34] Hallelujah
[1:12:35] you know very well that I mean if you
[1:12:38] love the woman you have the house
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:44] I mean it's a simple that's what our
[1:12:46] fathers taught us love your wife you
[1:12:48] have the house
[1:12:57] now so God allowed all of that to happen
[1:13:02] all of that was just the mechanism
[1:13:07] engineering to bring Genesis 15 promise
[1:13:10] to pass
[1:13:14] because that would take 400 years that
[1:13:16] would bring them to four generation
[1:13:20] now
[1:13:24] God dealing with the Gentiles he would
[1:13:27] do the same
[1:13:28] he will give Nebuchadnezzar a dream
[1:13:34] and he would give a boy called Daniel
[1:13:37] the interpretation of the dream to show
[1:13:40] the way that he will deal with the
[1:13:42] Gentile Nations
[1:13:47] praise the Lord
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:51] so if you talk about superpower
[1:13:55] you can you can you can you can follow
[1:13:57] the media you can follow everything but
[1:13:59] in God's mind God's superpower is the is
[1:14:04] the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:14:07] dream that starts from the head of God
[1:14:10] which was the Babylonian Kingdom and and
[1:14:14] in the feet of iron and Clay which is
[1:14:17] the Roman Kingdom
[1:14:19] that is established
[1:14:22] by the Roman Catholic Church
[1:14:26] so in God's mind the superpower when you
[1:14:30] talk about superpower not Russia not
[1:14:33] America is the Vatican
[1:14:45] are we together
[1:14:49] because God always designed
[1:14:54] a mechanism
[1:14:56] the mechanics have to be in place for
[1:14:59] the Dynamics to strike
[1:15:03] everything has to be in place
[1:15:09] are we together
[1:15:15] the reason why we have a lot of violence
[1:15:17] and we have a lot of immorality is
[1:15:20] because the mechanism for these things
[1:15:22] are already in place
[1:15:25] right
[1:15:27] there's no man that can rise on the same
[1:15:29] prophesy Revival for America it will
[1:15:32] never happen
[1:15:38] praise the Lord because you don't have
[1:15:42] the mechanism to bring Revival
[1:15:45] you don't have the mechanism to bring
[1:15:48] Revival
[1:15:50] for the nation
[1:15:59] now so so that's that's the that's the
[1:16:02] description that's the reason why you
[1:16:05] can type the the three unclean spirit
[1:16:07] with these political influence
[1:16:10] because it has to start from political
[1:16:13] powers
[1:16:15] the in in the Gentile Kingdom it started
[1:16:18] with political power Babylon as the head
[1:16:21] of God
[1:16:22] but then when it got in the feet it
[1:16:25] broke into a pagan room and papa room
[1:16:31] in the feet a form
[1:16:34] a religious power
[1:16:37] so it moves slowly from a political
[1:16:41] power to a religious power
[1:16:45] because politics only govern our flesh
[1:16:52] amen but religious power govern your
[1:16:56] spirit
[1:16:58] that's right
[1:17:01] praise the Lord
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:06] politics only govern our flesh
[1:17:16] so we will realize that that these
[1:17:19] unclean spirits
[1:17:21] be some clean spirit
[1:17:24] they they are more
[1:17:26] than just the things that we battle with
[1:17:29] in our mind
[1:17:31] and and and the habits and and all the
[1:17:34] things that we don't like about ourself
[1:17:36] praise the Lord
[1:17:39] they have an influence
[1:17:43] every one of us
[1:17:48] our first birth we were born in
[1:17:51] uncleanness
[1:17:53] that's true
[1:17:56] that came from The Serpent and Eve
[1:18:00] the only representation that you have of
[1:18:03] God was in your soul
[1:18:05] but your spirit and your body was born
[1:18:08] insane shapeless in iniquity
[1:18:12] that's the reason why we must be born
[1:18:16] again it's a must
[1:18:20] it's not whether you choose it or not
[1:18:28] praise the Lord
[1:18:31] are we together
[1:18:32] so Mary bam goes go ahead here then he
[1:18:35] he talks about how communism is a spirit
[1:18:38] and he says that's that's what it gets
[1:18:40] on people he says uh uh it would be
[1:18:44] something like that on it he says that's
[1:18:46] really
[1:18:47] uh uh uh he says but it's
[1:18:51] it's it will be free Spirits just like
[1:18:55] that he says watch that uh was kind of a
[1:19:00] forerunner is is uh it's in catalism
[1:19:05] so it's it's it it ran like that
[1:19:12] from political power
[1:19:15] and they end up as a religious system
[1:19:21] catalism
[1:19:23] she's behind every wall
[1:19:26] she's behind every government
[1:19:29] she speaks and those leaders obey
[1:19:34] praise the Lord
[1:19:36] if you were Now obey they'll get you out
[1:19:45] are we together she has her Embassy in
[1:19:48] every nation
[1:19:49] as a small Catholic church with a bill
[1:19:52] that Reigns
[1:19:59] should become kind to the people
[1:20:01] and give them hospitals and give them
[1:20:03] schools
[1:20:07] all she's trying to do is to brainwash
[1:20:09] him
[1:20:12] brainwashed him she has a very slick way
[1:20:17] of bringing you to worship her idols
[1:20:21] praise the Lord she don't send
[1:20:23] evangelists you never find somebody
[1:20:25] coming out to evangelize
[1:20:28] she don't say evangelists
[1:20:30] all she has to do she build a very nice
[1:20:32] Church
[1:20:33] she goes the way she evangelize is by
[1:20:36] charity
[1:20:38] that's right
[1:20:40] that's how she evangelized that how she
[1:20:43] wins Souls is by charity
[1:20:47] and the modern church has followed the
[1:20:49] same let's do barbecue
[1:20:51] let's get bunch of bread
[1:20:53] so we can win souls
[1:20:56] it was never like that in the book of
[1:20:57] Arts
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:02] amen Jesus tried one time and he told
[1:21:04] them you just follow me because of the
[1:21:06] bread you eat
[1:21:15] the church don't win church I mean win
[1:21:17] souls by charity the Bible said you can
[1:21:19] even give your body to be burned
[1:21:28] now so uh
[1:21:34] so as we look at this as we travel alone
[1:21:37] here I want you to see that I want you
[1:21:40] to understand there because uh uh I mean
[1:21:44] whatever you are dealing with
[1:21:46] is uh it has a root
[1:21:50] praise the Lord
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] it has a root
[1:21:55] and if you can be able to deal with it
[1:21:58] rightly
[1:21:59] you can you can uh you see I I was just
[1:22:05] telling last night and and uh you know
[1:22:08] uh and and the Holy Spirit kind of
[1:22:10] struck me
[1:22:12] and to realize that and I said this over
[1:22:15] in in in Chicago after the wedding last
[1:22:18] uh
[1:22:20] last weekend
[1:22:22] I had a privilege to preach in a
[1:22:25] historical church there
[1:22:26] as I started I think somewhere back in
[1:22:30] the 1933 that was the first church on
[1:22:32] that street
[1:22:34] and so but what I was trying to to say
[1:22:38] to and encourage the people that is
[1:22:40] there because most of the time you know
[1:22:43] people they get caught up in this thing
[1:22:46] but look at this type now look at this
[1:22:48] type as you look at it through the
[1:22:49] through the the scripture there was a
[1:22:53] relationship between Adam and Eve
[1:22:56] the hard air relationship
[1:22:58] praise the Lord
[1:23:00] when he fell Adam could identify himself
[1:23:04] with Eve
[1:23:06] praise the Lord
[1:23:08] King and Abel
[1:23:10] they had religion
[1:23:14] when one was rejected
[1:23:16] and the other one was accepted the one
[1:23:19] that was rejected sought to kill the
[1:23:22] ones that was accepted
[1:23:28] praise the Lord
[1:23:29] so you see is it will always be religion
[1:23:32] religious spirit that will separate
[1:23:34] people
[1:23:37] amen if you have ever had a true
[1:23:41] relationship with God no matter what you
[1:23:44] believe
[1:23:46] it will never separate you from the
[1:23:48] people that you love
[1:23:51] it will even make you more humble it
[1:23:54] will make you more associative but if
[1:23:57] you get a religious spirit on you
[1:23:59] because you believe you should wear
[1:24:01] white shirts and the next man wear black
[1:24:04] shirt you walk out of this door that's
[1:24:06] what a religious spirit will do and
[1:24:08] people say I have a stand you're just
[1:24:10] standing on a religious demon
[1:24:20] a relationship with God will never do
[1:24:22] that
[1:24:23] praise the Lord amen
[1:24:26] you have a relationship with your
[1:24:27] parents that's not that I mean you're
[1:24:29] that that's how you were born it was out
[1:24:31] of relationship
[1:24:32] now how will now people come to believe
[1:24:35] a message or give their life to Christ
[1:24:37] and then it despise their parents
[1:24:41] how
[1:24:42] how does that happen
[1:24:45] you don't associate with your parents I
[1:24:48] mean your loved ones and and all of that
[1:24:50] and then you say because you you have a
[1:24:52] faith they don't believe what I believe
[1:24:55] you just got a religious devil on you
[1:25:02] even if your children has backslide they
[1:25:04] have left the message you bonded
[1:25:07] you must always love them
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:14] your parent can be a worshiper of of the
[1:25:17] devil that's your father
[1:25:20] he was worshiping devil before he born
[1:25:22] you you must respect him
[1:25:41] because she believed the message you
[1:25:42] will get the Seven Seals
[1:25:47] thank you
[1:25:49] let me preach my message here
[1:25:53] praise the Lord
[1:26:02] there's some clean spirit is more than
[1:26:05] what
[1:26:06] we think it is
[1:26:09] praise the Lord because every man ways
[1:26:12] is right in their own eyes
[1:26:16] every man weighs is right in their own
[1:26:19] eyes
[1:26:19] but is the is the Lord
[1:26:22] that Josh had the spirit of man
[1:26:26] amen praise the lord we can justify the
[1:26:28] things we do
[1:26:31] praise the Lord
[1:26:33] amen
[1:26:34] and nobody is going to change me from
[1:26:36] what right I mean that's that's my
[1:26:37] choice and whatever I want you can I
[1:26:39] mean that's I mean that's I mean that's
[1:26:41] as far as you understand it
[1:26:44] but because you think it's right it's
[1:26:46] not right
[1:26:47] it's not because you think that it is
[1:26:49] right makes it right
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:55] for there is a way that see me right
[1:26:57] unto a man that's right
[1:27:00] that's why Solomon says here
[1:27:02] come on let's go ahead here I told you
[1:27:04] that we have a lot to dig into
[1:27:06] amen so as you look at this
[1:27:11] and uh you know when it was beautiful
[1:27:14] when brother Stephen brought it out
[1:27:16] there Wednesday night uh how one of the
[1:27:19] gospels says You must cast it out and
[1:27:21] another says You must overcome it that
[1:27:24] was just beautiful praise the Lord You
[1:27:26] Have you have to keep it on a suggestion
[1:27:28] you have to keep it on a suggestion amen
[1:27:31] amen if not you will be you will be
[1:27:35] you'll be ruled by that spirit
[1:27:41] now so he uh uh he goes he goes ahead
[1:27:45] and he he tells us here
[1:27:47] uh he says and uh uh I truly believe
[1:27:51] right now just to kind of outline it
[1:27:57] if I add a little more to it uh I'll add
[1:28:00] a little more to it when I get to
[1:28:02] explain it
[1:28:04] you don't explain it
[1:28:06] all together down down there that night
[1:28:09] he says if I do that here's what I think
[1:28:13] I believe it's a spirit
[1:28:15] he's talking about the same communism
[1:28:18] and he says the sleeping virgin
[1:28:21] now who are the sleeping virgin
[1:28:24] that's Matthew chapter 25.
[1:28:29] the the five that did not have all in
[1:28:32] their line
[1:28:33] but the beautiful thing here is that the
[1:28:36] Bible says they are sleeping virgin
[1:28:40] which means they have a clean life
[1:28:44] they are virgin they have not been
[1:28:47] touched by men
[1:28:49] but yeah we see that he's putting an
[1:28:53] influence
[1:28:55] behind him how
[1:29:00] he says I believe that the sleeping
[1:29:02] virgin
[1:29:05] Confederation of churches
[1:29:08] the World Council of churches that's
[1:29:10] what he means
[1:29:11] all of these are honored the influence
[1:29:15] of their unclean spirit
[1:29:25] Judaism
[1:29:27] on their rejection rejecting of Christ
[1:29:31] Judaism the people that the the Covenant
[1:29:36] of circumcision was given to
[1:29:39] they were all honored that was the
[1:29:42] spirit you think about it that make them
[1:29:45] to crucify they are very Messiah
[1:29:50] in the name of what religion
[1:29:55] They Crucified they are very Messiah
[1:30:02] in the name of religion
[1:30:06] we destroy our home destroy our family
[1:30:09] destroy our children
[1:30:23] praise the Lord
[1:30:27] we just get on the tank the message said
[1:30:29] we must not do that you can't do this
[1:30:31] the message say you are not having a
[1:30:33] relationship with a child
[1:30:36] you are not bringing the truth to them
[1:30:39] you are putting a religious spirit on
[1:30:41] them
[1:30:46] you must be able to communicate the
[1:30:49] truth by relating
[1:30:50] not commending
[1:31:03] praise the Lord
[1:31:08] I was studying the other day and I came
[1:31:10] across this beautiful
[1:31:12] phrase
[1:31:15] and I love it
[1:31:18] try to memorize it it can't stick in my
[1:31:20] head but
[1:31:21] they were just they're just two words
[1:31:23] there truth and Authority
[1:31:26] Authority is not truth
[1:31:30] but truth is Authority
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:36] praise the lord it's not because you
[1:31:39] have the authority makes everything you
[1:31:41] say is truth no
[1:31:46] but the truth
[1:31:48] shall make you free
[1:31:57] you know the beautiful thing about
[1:31:58] preaching to people
[1:32:01] everybody can
[1:32:02] choose to understand it any way they
[1:32:04] Wonder yeah
[1:32:06] well I know what I said
[1:32:10] don't tell me the way you understand it
[1:32:12] is what I said that how you understand
[1:32:14] it amen
[1:32:16] don't say that why you said no that's
[1:32:18] not what I said
[1:32:22] that's a beautiful thing
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:30] well you're not in church now what the
[1:32:32] pastor said
[1:32:34] did you listen your ear was not open
[1:32:37] just pushing what you understood
[1:32:49] now so as as we look at this
[1:32:53] I'm not even started yet
[1:32:57] so we find all of these things Judaism
[1:32:59] on the on the rejecting of Christ the
[1:33:03] Jews that rejected it catholism he says
[1:33:05] because you see where it comes out of
[1:33:09] a false prophet out of the mouth of the
[1:33:13] false prophet that's what the scripture
[1:33:15] says in Revelation the the the false
[1:33:18] prophet is the mouth
[1:33:20] is is the ministry is the messenger on
[1:33:23] the earth that is the mouth but behind
[1:33:25] their mouth
[1:33:29] there is a beast
[1:33:31] a power
[1:33:34] that will not make them to say anything
[1:33:36] truth
[1:33:39] how 40 men can can surround me carry the
[1:33:43] prophet
[1:33:44] and said this land belonged to us
[1:33:48] praise the Lord they can prove it they
[1:33:50] could prove it by the word because
[1:33:52] Raymond Gita Raymond Gita if you look go
[1:33:55] back in the Book of Joshua it was one of
[1:33:58] the City of Refuge
[1:34:02] so if those men tell you that we have
[1:34:04] the court you can believe them that they
[1:34:06] have the court
[1:34:09] they were quoting from the word
[1:34:13] I have the court
[1:34:17] it's not it's not having the court it's
[1:34:20] applying the court in the right season
[1:34:30] uh uh uh go go and look at the the city
[1:34:33] of The Refuge the sixth sitting The
[1:34:35] Refuge
[1:34:39] what a prophets have already said that
[1:34:43] dogs were like Ahab block
[1:34:45] really
[1:34:47] so when Mikhail was was was having this
[1:34:50] vision there was a word that says yeah
[1:34:53] remagina is it belongs to Israel
[1:34:57] but what did he say
[1:34:59] he said Israel
[1:35:01] is without a shepherd in my vision
[1:35:06] Israel is without a shepherd
[1:35:09] and Ahab was the shepherd
[1:35:12] but there was a prophecy from a Prophet
[1:35:14] Elijah that was Haunting him yeah
[1:35:23] so you can have all your code to back up
[1:35:25] whatever you want to back up
[1:35:32] the code don't intimidate us
[1:35:35] no it edify us bring the courts
[1:35:39] they don't intimidated
[1:35:41] us
[1:35:45] because we want to learn so bring up the
[1:35:47] courts
[1:35:54] praise the Lord now don't think don't
[1:35:57] create in your mind here don't make the
[1:35:59] devil to divert your thought
[1:36:02] I'm coming against spirit
[1:36:04] I'm not fighting any individual
[1:36:09] don't allow the devil to distract you
[1:36:13] praise the Lord I did not spend my night
[1:36:16] off fighting individual
[1:36:18] I'm fighting spirits
[1:36:24] I won't stay up until 3 A.M if I have a
[1:36:27] problem with an individual I go to your
[1:36:29] house
[1:36:29] I will sit down with you and tell you
[1:36:31] right in your face
[1:36:37] so don't think I'm I'm chasing anybody
[1:36:39] here no no no no
[1:36:40] if you were in church if you were not
[1:36:42] here I would preach this
[1:36:46] whether you are here or not I will
[1:36:48] preach this your presence don't change
[1:36:50] my inspiration
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] because I wait on God for it
[1:37:01] so you are all welcome
[1:37:06] praise the Lord
[1:37:09] he loved the Lord
[1:37:11] amen now Broadband shared this in in
[1:37:13] question and answer mark of the beast
[1:37:15] it's beautiful beautiful very beautiful
[1:37:16] see what he says he says the Bible said
[1:37:19] free unclean Spirit went out of the
[1:37:22] mouth of the Beast he said do you know
[1:37:25] what unclean spirit
[1:37:27] say it like frost did you ever notice
[1:37:31] how the frogs look the frogs always
[1:37:35] Looking Backward
[1:37:37] he never looked forward
[1:37:42] looking back always back look back
[1:37:47] the four beats which is the four living
[1:37:50] creatures
[1:37:52] he says
[1:37:55] the heart the full different head
[1:38:00] the the the the the lion the ox the man
[1:38:04] and the eagle that's the full living
[1:38:06] creature he's talking about they were
[1:38:09] moving forward all the time
[1:38:12] now I've demonstrated that for you
[1:38:14] before but let's let's do it one more
[1:38:16] time and you you guys come up
[1:38:19] y'all come and help me preach let's do
[1:38:21] it
[1:38:22] amen come up come on buddy don't sit
[1:38:25] down there you got to be one of the
[1:38:27] living creatures take your hands from
[1:38:28] your pocket you are a living creatures
[1:38:30] you are not a bigger boy now so bound
[1:38:33] your hands like this hold your hands
[1:38:35] like this okay give your back your back
[1:38:38] okay but tie to your hands because we
[1:38:42] are protecting the truth no I'm one
[1:38:44] don't leave me out
[1:38:46] praise the Lord
[1:38:48] now so the living creatures are like
[1:38:50] this
[1:38:51] the throne is in the mess
[1:38:54] this is where the church is
[1:38:58] that's why Jesus said the case of Hell
[1:39:00] will never Prevail because the church is
[1:39:03] right here to get to the church you have
[1:39:06] to pass by one of these living creatures
[1:39:09] so the living creatures are like this
[1:39:13] one is
[1:39:15] the the head of a lion
[1:39:18] one is the head of an ox
[1:39:20] one is the the anointing of a man and
[1:39:25] the other one is the anointing of an ego
[1:39:27] now when they move
[1:39:38] praise the Lord
[1:39:42] are you okay are you ready
[1:39:45] because these living creatures are
[1:39:46] anointing so are you ready for the
[1:39:48] anointing to move
[1:39:52] okay Simon you move
[1:39:54] when Simon moved we all move here so
[1:39:58] what is happening that's what brother
[1:40:00] Branham says now listen now
[1:40:03] Aaron is now moving backwards
[1:40:08] he's moving forward
[1:40:10] because when Simon moved all three of us
[1:40:13] Unite
[1:40:14] and stand with that anointing
[1:40:17] so he's now moving backwards I'm now
[1:40:20] moving sideways we are all moving
[1:40:23] forward
[1:40:25] praise the Lord you get the picture
[1:40:29] God bless you Brothers
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:42] now
[1:40:43] uh you you you will see that's what
[1:40:46] makes it beautiful
[1:40:56] I love it
[1:40:59] I love it when I hear those sounds it
[1:41:02] tells me somebody is trying to digest
[1:41:05] I gave you a space to to to burp a
[1:41:08] little bit
[1:41:11] praise the Lord
[1:41:12] now so it's it's beautiful
[1:41:16] it's beautiful because these are the
[1:41:19] things that people don't understand
[1:41:25] people don't understand it
[1:41:28] the the those living creatures
[1:41:32] they are they are they are the ones they
[1:41:34] are that there that were seen as a
[1:41:37] cherubim that gathered the trait of life
[1:41:40] in the Garden of Eden they were those
[1:41:42] living creatures
[1:41:43] now and and they are the anointing that
[1:41:47] is on the church
[1:41:50] so when the church is under the Lions
[1:41:53] anointing
[1:41:55] all the powers of the living creature
[1:41:57] stand behind that
[1:42:01] and anoint the church
[1:42:03] so they move in that direction now when
[1:42:06] the church gets on of the ox anointing
[1:42:10] which is death persecution
[1:42:13] praise the Lord amen
[1:42:19] we we failed the the the the the the the
[1:42:23] ox and not in one year
[1:42:27] two that is that was part of this church
[1:42:29] that we lost left us
[1:42:31] now sometimes when those things happen
[1:42:33] people say so yeah you know people are
[1:42:35] dying in that church
[1:42:36] no the church is put under that
[1:42:39] anointing for that time
[1:42:41] sure
[1:42:42] that's the reason why now the entire
[1:42:44] church the the the the full living
[1:42:46] creature in that church WIll unite us to
[1:42:50] bear with one another
[1:42:54] so sometimes it looks like well there is
[1:42:57] there is there is forces and and all of
[1:42:59] that and all you are all of the ox
[1:43:01] anointing if you are under the anointing
[1:43:05] of the hour you will unite together sins
[1:43:08] together and fight that persecution
[1:43:14] you have a wrong understanding the same
[1:43:18] thing happened to you in your own body
[1:43:20] sometimes you are on fire for God it
[1:43:24] looks like you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:26] the demon come I can kick him right in
[1:43:27] the face and sometimes your head is
[1:43:29] stuck between your knees you are just
[1:43:31] crying it does not mean that God has
[1:43:34] rejected you you are just honor and
[1:43:36] anointing for the hour
[1:43:41] that's the reason why sometimes one day
[1:43:43] you have the Holy Ghost another day you
[1:43:45] don't have the Holy all those anointing
[1:43:47] have the Holy Ghost
[1:43:48] foreign
[1:43:58] bring Divine Healing under the honor the
[1:44:00] honor the four beats
[1:44:02] what is the ego
[1:44:04] the ego is an instant Miracle you are
[1:44:07] prayed for and you are healed that's the
[1:44:09] ego's anointing
[1:44:12] was the man's anointing you go to your
[1:44:15] doctor
[1:44:18] and your doctor tells you this is what
[1:44:20] is happening to you you take this
[1:44:22] medicine and take this medicine and take
[1:44:25] this medicine do this do this do this
[1:44:27] that's the next anointing if you believe
[1:44:30] God you will obey your doctor
[1:44:33] amen amen
[1:44:34] praise the Lord
[1:44:37] now sometimes is the ox anointing
[1:44:42] you find people that have prayed about
[1:44:44] things they have been prayed for
[1:44:46] verbaland have one in this church
[1:44:49] heavywise sister
[1:44:53] one instance she got it from the witch
[1:44:56] here and she sat right back down
[1:45:00] in that very same church
[1:45:02] brother will was preached was prayed for
[1:45:04] when he died and God raised him back up
[1:45:08] in that very same church people received
[1:45:11] their sight people with cancer was
[1:45:13] healed
[1:45:14] but she was there under the ox I know
[1:45:21] you are in your Affliction but you are
[1:45:23] still praising God
[1:45:27] you still find us trying to come to come
[1:45:29] to church
[1:45:31] praise the Lord
[1:45:33] because you know
[1:45:35] whether this sickness kill me or I'm
[1:45:38] Healed of it I have a brand new body
[1:45:40] that can step in any moment
[1:45:43] okay
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:45:51] now when you don't understand these
[1:45:53] things then you become a fanatic
[1:45:56] and you think that you are applying
[1:45:58] faith
[1:46:06] where am I
[1:46:07] now so you see that's the beautiful
[1:46:09] thing but the unclean Spirit don't move
[1:46:13] in that direction
[1:46:15] it tried to make you to think that you
[1:46:17] are moving forward but is trying to
[1:46:20] produce the Revival of the past
[1:46:22] when we when we were in Africa this is
[1:46:25] the way we used to do it it's a past
[1:46:26] Revival stop looking back
[1:46:29] deal with what you have to deal with
[1:46:31] right now
[1:46:33] put your home in order put your work a
[1:46:36] schedule in order find time to pray find
[1:46:39] time to Fast Five time to read the word
[1:46:41] don't be looking in Africa in Africa we
[1:46:44] used to do this we're Africa in Africa
[1:46:46] go back to Africa
[1:46:48] I know
[1:46:53] go back
[1:46:59] if you come to America the people they
[1:47:01] are so cold go back
[1:47:04] nobody call you here
[1:47:27] thank you
[1:47:31] now so you see
[1:47:33] as you as you look look at these things
[1:47:37] as you look at these things what is the
[1:47:39] time here
[1:47:40] okay
[1:47:44] now so let's let's get in our message a
[1:47:47] little bit here we want to talk about
[1:47:49] Mary Magdalene
[1:47:51] I was trying to build this now so like I
[1:47:54] said seven
[1:47:57] Seven Nations was stopping Israel from
[1:48:00] getting to their promise so seven
[1:48:03] spirits Through the Ages have been
[1:48:04] warring against the church from getting
[1:48:06] to her promise her promised word her
[1:48:09] promised message for the age her
[1:48:11] promised Deliverance
[1:48:14] now you will realize that in the in the
[1:48:18] in the scripture
[1:48:20] uh
[1:48:22] there is there's a form of sickness
[1:48:25] that that uh that represented unclean
[1:48:29] spirit that was leprosy the first time
[1:48:32] leprosy was mentioned was Exodus chapter
[1:48:34] four when married
[1:48:37] when Moses received his Commission
[1:48:42] praise the Lord
[1:48:43] the first sign was
[1:48:46] throwing the the the his stick down it
[1:48:49] turned into sipping
[1:48:51] and second represents sin
[1:48:54] the next sign was for him to put his
[1:48:57] hand in his bosom
[1:48:59] representing the inner
[1:49:02] part of the man
[1:49:04] the first son was the outer part what
[1:49:06] you see
[1:49:08] the second he had to put his hand when
[1:49:10] he takes us out it was leprous so Moses
[1:49:14] came under the commission of the do what
[1:49:16] are two men
[1:49:18] his message was to deliver them from sin
[1:49:21] and sickness
[1:49:23] that's the do order to me
[1:49:25] that's the reason why the turtle dove
[1:49:28] was never split into half
[1:49:31] because in a too many live in Leviticus
[1:49:34] it represented healing
[1:49:38] are we together so the Covenant was
[1:49:41] always adored a a dual Attunement sin
[1:49:44] and sickness that's why Jesus will say
[1:49:47] sir you are healed your sin is forgiving
[1:49:49] you because it's a daughter to me you
[1:49:51] can separate it
[1:49:56] you can separate it we cannot be free
[1:49:59] from the sin of the flesh unless we are
[1:50:01] healed in our spirit
[1:50:03] until God thee with unbelief in our
[1:50:06] spirit our body can never be free from
[1:50:09] telling lies and and and you know and
[1:50:12] thinking foolish
[1:50:16] now so that was the first time Moses
[1:50:19] commission was on a do other two men
[1:50:21] seen in sickness it was a message of
[1:50:24] total Deliverance
[1:50:27] as simple as his message was
[1:50:31] it is not the message that is preached
[1:50:33] it's the commission that backs the
[1:50:36] message
[1:50:39] right praise the Lord
[1:50:42] amen
[1:50:44] sorry I'm not here to make you excited
[1:50:46] today
[1:50:47] I'm not a good teacher but I'm trying my
[1:50:49] best to teach
[1:50:51] because we have to place these things
[1:50:53] right
[1:50:55] now the second time we'll realize that
[1:50:58] God
[1:50:59] set an order in Leviticus chapter 13 how
[1:51:03] leprosy
[1:51:04] have to be observed
[1:51:07] so when a person had a spot in their
[1:51:10] flesh that looks like leprous they have
[1:51:12] to be watched over seven days
[1:51:17] years okay
[1:51:19] the the priests they will lock you up
[1:51:21] after seven days you'll come and show
[1:51:23] yourself to the priest again and the
[1:51:24] priest will examine you
[1:51:28] so yes another seven again
[1:51:32] amen
[1:51:37] we're realizing in second Kings chapter
[1:51:39] five
[1:51:40] Nehemiah the Syrian uh uh Captain how to
[1:51:44] be watched in the Jordan River how many
[1:51:47] times seven times for what cleansing
[1:51:56] are we together
[1:52:01] you know these things you know the
[1:52:02] scripture so we just read into you
[1:52:04] Numbers Chapter 12 we realize also that
[1:52:07] Miriam
[1:52:08] Miriam and uh
[1:52:11] and uh and Aaron got to gossiping
[1:52:18] they go to gossiping and they got
[1:52:20] leprosy Miriam was struck with leprosy
[1:52:26] praise the Lord
[1:52:28] you ask me the question about why Aaron
[1:52:30] was not struck
[1:52:36] but it because it was both of them
[1:52:39] why Aaron was not strong
[1:52:42] I will read something to you
[1:52:45] from the word that will answer that your
[1:52:47] question now second chronicles I think
[1:52:50] brother Chacha that goes back to what we
[1:52:52] were talking Wednesday night you know he
[1:52:54] was asking the question you know Moses I
[1:52:56] mean David David seen it against the law
[1:52:59] by numbering the people
[1:53:01] but when God sent the plaque David never
[1:53:03] die
[1:53:05] it was the people that died
[1:53:07] why why did God did not struck David
[1:53:12] it was the people that died hundreds of
[1:53:14] people lost their life
[1:53:16] David said Lord I have done this
[1:53:20] is very sinful that's that's just very
[1:53:23] simple principle
[1:53:25] amen
[1:53:29] now David prayed and asked the Lord to
[1:53:31] deal with him
[1:53:37] and the Lord in dealing with him there
[1:53:40] with his people
[1:53:44] so how how simple uh uh simple there
[1:53:49] could be and yet it sounds a little bit
[1:53:52] complicated is because
[1:54:02] it's more hurtful to a man when God is
[1:54:04] dealing with your children
[1:54:06] then when God deals with you
[1:54:10] praise the Lord
[1:54:11] amen amen
[1:54:13] when God these were for leader it can be
[1:54:16] more secrecy than when God deals with
[1:54:18] the people
[1:54:25] praise the Lord
[1:54:26] amen you have to remember that David was
[1:54:28] uh David was a leader
[1:54:32] and and the reason of the plan was not
[1:54:35] to kill
[1:54:36] David even though people lost their life
[1:54:39] but it was a correction
[1:54:43] now you see that's the reason why we all
[1:54:45] the responsibility not to sit down and
[1:54:48] allow our leaders to lead us in the dump
[1:54:51] when things are not right speak out and
[1:54:53] say it is not right
[1:54:56] and let's fix it
[1:55:05] praise the Lord
[1:55:06] now if you read Numbers Chapter 12 it
[1:55:09] was Mary and the Bible says the Miriam
[1:55:11] came to Iran now Miriam was a big sister
[1:55:13] she was trying to express her opinion
[1:55:16] about about Moses wife you know but
[1:55:20] whether the conversation was mirrored
[1:55:21] and Aaron
[1:55:23] when the law starts to deed Aaron said
[1:55:26] he went crying to Moses he said we have
[1:55:29] done wrong he never left himself out of
[1:55:32] the matter
[1:55:33] he said we have done wrong
[1:55:38] praise the Lord amen but you you can
[1:55:40] also understand and realize that he has
[1:55:43] just been placed into the office of a
[1:55:46] priest right yeah which is the office of
[1:55:50] a leader
[1:55:53] you can think it in a very same sense
[1:55:55] that's the reason why their iniquities
[1:55:57] of the father does not visit the father
[1:56:00] but the children
[1:56:02] why would God these were the children
[1:56:04] because of the iniquities of their
[1:56:05] father
[1:56:14] now so
[1:56:16] that was another time that leprosy
[1:56:18] struck the church I mean the uh the
[1:56:20] church because of gossip
[1:56:22] and then we saw also spiritual leprosy
[1:56:26] struck the New Testament Church when
[1:56:28] ananias and so far choose to stay in
[1:56:30] their house and gossip
[1:56:34] praise the Lord
[1:56:36] amen
[1:56:38] you having young people you have young
[1:56:40] children
[1:56:43] when you are dealing with things
[1:56:45] take it to the Lord in prayer
[1:56:49] don't say things unconsciously
[1:56:54] and influence your children
[1:56:58] your negative expression could put a
[1:57:00] spirit of rebellion on your children and
[1:57:03] they will never be able to submit to the
[1:57:05] word
[1:57:08] because they do not see summation in you
[1:57:10] right
[1:57:12] right because the things that you are
[1:57:14] talking who is he for him to say that to
[1:57:15] me
[1:57:16] how can he say that to me and me and
[1:57:18] then you are just putting evil spirit on
[1:57:21] your children
[1:57:37] now we see used here
[1:57:39] second Chronicle
[1:57:42] chapter 26 you see or die from leprosy
[1:57:46] why because he stepped his bound he
[1:57:48] never had no right to hold the holy
[1:57:51] sensor of God
[1:57:54] he thought because he was King he was
[1:57:56] eloquent
[1:58:02] and sometimes you you go through those
[1:58:04] things I mean you're going through
[1:58:06] things and you're asking yourself why
[1:58:07] why you are going through it maybe you
[1:58:09] were in the wrong position
[1:58:11] you were in the wrong place
[1:58:20] now so in in the Old Testament uh
[1:58:26] leprosy has been used to
[1:58:31] to uh signify uncleanness
[1:58:36] and just like I said it had to be
[1:58:38] watched over
[1:58:40] uh seven days
[1:58:42] the person is kept and washed over seven
[1:58:45] days until
[1:58:47] uh the you come and show yourself back
[1:58:50] to the priests now so we see here uh
[1:58:53] leave the young baby therefore enjoy
[1:58:56] herself
[1:58:57] amen
[1:58:59] let her praise the Lord out of the
[1:59:00] mouths of babes amen
[1:59:03] when he's when he's getting when he's
[1:59:05] getting disturbing the parent will know
[1:59:06] what to do
[1:59:07] amen now so we see here
[1:59:11] we want to look at this woman this woman
[1:59:14] Mary Magdalene
[1:59:17] now there are there are stories in the
[1:59:19] gospel that run across the report of the
[1:59:23] Full Gospel
[1:59:24] and they come very close to describing
[1:59:29] the situation that is happening for the
[1:59:31] moment
[1:59:32] praise the Lord
[1:59:34] amen we uh uh grateful to have our
[1:59:38] sister I think their sister Rochelle
[1:59:40] sister-in-law she's serving in the
[1:59:43] military
[1:59:44] we want to thank thank God for her
[1:59:46] service amen
[1:59:48] uh we we always start to appreciate our
[1:59:51] military people amen so we we thank her
[1:59:55] for her service
[1:59:57] now so uh we we see here you if you look
[2:00:01] into this into the scripture Matthew
[2:00:03] chapter 26 you write it down you go and
[2:00:05] do your own reading Mark chapter 14 Luke
[2:00:08] chapter 7 answering John chapter 12. now
[2:00:12] if you read these passages you will
[2:00:14] realize there are similarities of things
[2:00:17] that took place the Bible some places
[2:00:20] the Bible call her a certain woman
[2:00:24] the Bible never make mention of the name
[2:00:27] of the woman that took the alabaster bus
[2:00:31] and anointed Jesus feet
[2:00:34] the scripture for some reason never make
[2:00:37] mention of that woman
[2:00:39] amen
[2:00:41] and uh uh
[2:00:44] but it is in John 12
[2:00:48] it appears like it was married
[2:00:54] Lazarus sister
[2:00:57] praise the Lord
[2:00:58] amen now I'm I'm just I'm just putting
[2:01:01] scripture out there to you so you can go
[2:01:04] home and and and study but you will see
[2:01:07] here that I will pick up some few things
[2:01:09] from the prophet you appreciate it you
[2:01:11] will see here that uh there was
[2:01:13] something of this woman like there
[2:01:16] there's a scripture there that brought
[2:01:17] it out beautiful and as I was looking at
[2:01:20] it last night studying uh uh it's I mean
[2:01:23] it came out so beautiful I think that is
[2:01:25] Luke Luke chapter 8.
[2:01:29] Luke chapter 8
[2:01:31] are we together
[2:01:33] amen
[2:01:36] Luke chapter 8.
[2:01:44] don't never take your frustration before
[2:01:46] your children
[2:01:48] those children are far smarter than you
[2:01:55] they are fast far smarter than you they
[2:01:57] they are blessed and now the uh
[2:02:03] now in Luke chapter 8 the Bible says
[2:02:06] and and certain woman which have been
[2:02:11] healed
[2:02:12] of evil spirit and infirmities
[2:02:16] Mary
[2:02:18] called Magdalene she was called
[2:02:22] Magdalene but her name was Mary
[2:02:26] so Magdalene was not her surname
[2:02:31] Magdalene was a description they have
[2:02:34] for her
[2:02:35] because of what she suffered
[2:02:45] oh mine praise the Lord
[2:02:49] praise the Lord
[2:02:53] now so with Luke
[2:02:56] with Dr Luke approached to the scripture
[2:03:00] he was able to give us an Insight
[2:03:03] because the other scripture the other
[2:03:05] gospel just this traveled as a setting
[2:03:09] woman
[2:03:09] right but Luke brought her as a certain
[2:03:12] woman
[2:03:13] and then tore us
[2:03:18] so you see that's the reason why my
[2:03:20] brother Brandon preached about the woman
[2:03:22] that weep at Jesus feet he talks about
[2:03:25] all the life that she live
[2:03:28] which of course it was a life that was
[2:03:30] open because even Simon knew the woman
[2:03:33] and said if Jesus was really a prophet
[2:03:36] he would know that this woman is an
[2:03:38] unclean woman
[2:03:43] are we together
[2:03:49] now I can I can go in today I'm not
[2:03:52] going to do uh nemology and in order
[2:03:54] there for you this morning but I can go
[2:03:56] into into that and and and help you to
[2:04:00] appreciate the other uh uh uh the the
[2:04:03] Mary had had uh something that she
[2:04:07] suffered from
[2:04:09] and then in all of that was the cause of
[2:04:12] the the life that she she got herself
[2:04:15] into
[2:04:17] praise the Lord and you go back into
[2:04:20] history and then you read a little bit
[2:04:21] you realize that uh it was it was almost
[2:04:24] something like like like an epilepsy
[2:04:29] because she was always falling
[2:04:34] and that's what the name Magdalene means
[2:04:38] one that is thrown out
[2:04:41] one that falls
[2:04:45] now that's just history now that's just
[2:04:47] history so
[2:04:49] um
[2:04:50] that's just history
[2:04:53] leaving us there
[2:04:55] praise the Lord let's get back to our
[2:04:57] steady here so you see that that the
[2:05:00] gospel story surround and and it
[2:05:03] building a picture no wonder why Jesus
[2:05:07] was a friend to to to to to the house
[2:05:11] no wonder why when that woman was
[2:05:14] delivered from the seven demons she sat
[2:05:16] down all the time and just listened to
[2:05:19] she found so she found comfort
[2:05:22] in the words of Jesus
[2:05:25] because the spirit that was making her
[2:05:27] to run in the streets have left her
[2:05:37] a prophet of God will say to us amen
[2:05:41] he says Mary Magdalene she she knew his
[2:05:46] power
[2:05:48] she knew there was something about him
[2:05:51] was different from anyone else
[2:05:54] she has seven devil cast out of her
[2:05:58] everybody that ever been free from the
[2:06:03] Devils by the power of Jesus Christ
[2:06:05] knows where they are standing
[2:06:10] praise the Lord
[2:06:12] amen if you are delivered you know where
[2:06:15] you are standing
[2:06:16] if you are delivered you will not be
[2:06:18] able to find your way back because he
[2:06:21] takes the habit
[2:06:23] amen
[2:06:25] he takes the habit
[2:06:28] their desire that's what I mean sorry he
[2:06:30] takes the desire
[2:06:34] that's where the Holy Ghost does
[2:06:38] you might think foolish like you used to
[2:06:40] the things you used to do they will come
[2:06:42] through your mind but the desire to go
[2:06:44] and do it is not there
[2:06:49] amen the devil can blast your mind all
[2:06:52] he want to
[2:06:55] the strength to go and do it it's not
[2:06:58] there
[2:07:01] then he says
[2:07:03] no one
[2:07:07] no one presence
[2:07:08] and ever be the same person anymore you
[2:07:11] are changed there is something happening
[2:07:14] to you oh you can stand off
[2:07:18] and uh whatever it is and imagine this
[2:07:22] and accept this and and accepting
[2:07:25] thinking and curious to your logic and
[2:07:28] all of that
[2:07:30] something like that we believe in the
[2:07:33] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[2:07:35] Christ and when you come into His
[2:07:38] presence there is something that
[2:07:41] happened
[2:07:42] in your life amen praise the Lord
[2:07:47] if it does not happen to you which means
[2:07:49] you have not got a hold of him that's
[2:07:51] right
[2:07:52] you came you came to church and you got
[2:07:55] shot of coming to his presence
[2:07:57] sure
[2:07:59] because this is not his presence this
[2:08:01] building
[2:08:02] his presence is the atmosphere
[2:08:05] that the word creates
[2:08:08] the thing that makes you to step in and
[2:08:11] say Amen praise the Lord
[2:08:19] are we together
[2:08:21] okay Let's Stay Together
[2:08:27] and you and and you are never the same
[2:08:30] one same uh uh same animal a man
[2:08:34] that ever been in the presence of Christ
[2:08:37] so she has Seven Devils cast out of her
[2:08:42] pride and anything
[2:08:45] and she thought she was so pretty
[2:08:52] she thought she was so pretty
[2:08:57] you see how she got some of her evil
[2:08:59] spirit on her
[2:09:00] when she thought she was so pretty
[2:09:06] she got into the state of self-worship
[2:09:12] that's why it would do self-washing it's
[2:09:16] all about yourself
[2:09:21] praise the Lord
[2:09:22] now not only girls do it
[2:09:25] boys also do it
[2:09:33] praise the Lord
[2:09:35] when we just get so much concerned about
[2:09:37] our outward appearance how how we
[2:09:40] appeared and and and no attention to
[2:09:42] what's going down in our spirit
[2:09:44] she thought she was so pretty
[2:09:48] and because of that she got a proud
[2:09:51] Spirit on her
[2:09:53] and people a proud spirit is a religious
[2:09:56] spirit
[2:09:57] if you don't know
[2:10:00] it's more daily when it's religious
[2:10:06] Isaiah tore us of Lucifer
[2:10:09] how he taught in his heart that was that
[2:10:13] was that was his fault
[2:10:16] and without Pride Spirit he was able to
[2:10:20] deceive
[2:10:25] three quarters of the Angels
[2:10:27] yeah
[2:10:37] she thought she was so pretty
[2:10:39] and there was no one like her
[2:10:46] but when Jesus spoke and said be thou
[2:10:50] clinch
[2:10:52] oh
[2:10:54] that left her
[2:10:56] she became a new person amen
[2:11:02] she wasn't so pretty anymore
[2:11:05] in her own sight
[2:11:07] it's not that she was dressing dirty
[2:11:11] but the kind of for self-image that she
[2:11:14] have for herself
[2:11:16] if she was dressing
[2:11:18] it was by the scripture
[2:11:20] to the glory of God Amen now for
[2:11:24] self-presentation
[2:11:32] she became a new person she wasn't so
[2:11:34] pretty anymore in her own sight she
[2:11:37] wrapped herself in the Rob of meekness
[2:11:40] and gentleness
[2:11:42] and follow the master
[2:11:45] she loved him
[2:11:47] she loved him
[2:11:52] she love him
[2:11:54] if you put the story together if you
[2:11:56] just read the account
[2:11:58] of the disciples and put the story
[2:12:00] because I I think it's in Luke
[2:12:04] Luke 7 says Simon place was in Bethany
[2:12:08] where where was Lazarus house in Bethany
[2:12:14] so if you put the story together
[2:12:20] I'm just I'm creating the picture in
[2:12:22] your mind here amen I'm not interpreting
[2:12:26] scripture interpretation of scriptures
[2:12:28] for a prophet I'm only creating a
[2:12:31] picture right inspiration is different
[2:12:34] from interpretation many times people
[2:12:36] think about inspiration you are no no no
[2:12:38] no no
[2:12:38] it's completely different
[2:12:40] inspiration is to draw the people that's
[2:12:44] why some people can dramatize when they
[2:12:46] are preaching it's an inspiration it's a
[2:12:48] Channel of gifts to be able to draw you
[2:12:51] in
[2:12:52] create a picture
[2:12:58] are we together
[2:13:01] now so we see here he says uh
[2:13:10] okay I have to find a place to close
[2:13:12] here now
[2:13:16] I have to find a place to close on on
[2:13:18] setting sound there was there was
[2:13:21] another
[2:13:23] yes another
[2:13:28] I don't know where I put it maybe I left
[2:13:30] it out that's that's fine on on settings
[2:13:34] sound lucky look in the Bible times
[2:13:37] some of the best
[2:13:40] that come
[2:13:41] was Mary Magdalene
[2:13:45] some of the best
[2:13:48] that come
[2:13:50] was Mary Magdalene
[2:13:56] out
[2:13:58] of who he he cast Seven Devils
[2:14:04] to them
[2:14:07] that received much
[2:14:10] they appreciate much
[2:14:13] to people that have really experienced
[2:14:17] the grace of God in their life
[2:14:19] delivering them from Habits and things
[2:14:22] they know how to appreciate God for
[2:14:25] people that are just sticking around
[2:14:29] creating their own self-righteousness
[2:14:32] they don't know how to appreciate the
[2:14:34] grace of God
[2:14:36] she was one of the best of the scripture
[2:14:38] the Bible says she anointed him to his
[2:14:41] resurrection
[2:14:42] and she was the first that saw him
[2:14:49] you have never loved her
[2:14:52] before she got delivered
[2:14:56] you have never loved her
[2:14:58] you will have a have all the uglier
[2:15:00] thing to say about her
[2:15:04] yes praise the Lord
[2:15:08] but she was one of the best of the
[2:15:10] scripture Jesus said wherever this
[2:15:13] gospel is preached
[2:15:15] her art will never be forgiven forgotten
[2:15:30] praise the Lord
[2:15:32] now so let's wrap this whole thing up
[2:15:34] let's wrap this whole thing up because
[2:15:36] after this I want us to just have a have
[2:15:38] a little prayer meeting here and uh I
[2:15:41] don't want anybody going home with any
[2:15:43] kind of a wrong Spirit on them and I
[2:15:45] just I mean when you come to expose in
[2:15:47] spirit you have to be awake
[2:15:49] this is real young people this is real
[2:15:53] this is real
[2:15:55] you see all of those boys are taking
[2:15:58] drugs and running on the street yelling
[2:16:01] over their hair rolling on the ground
[2:16:02] they are possessed with evil spirits
[2:16:13] praise the Lord
[2:16:15] some people just get it by watching some
[2:16:17] kind of a stupid thing on the internet
[2:16:20] true you can contact an evil spirit
[2:16:23] and they can torment you the rest of
[2:16:25] your life until God be gracious to you
[2:16:33] now so when brother Branham teach
[2:16:34] demonology
[2:16:36] he teach demonology in three Reigns
[2:16:40] he teaches demon knowledge in a Physical
[2:16:42] Realm which of course he said that is
[2:16:44] responsible for our sicknesses
[2:16:50] and he he taught demonology in the
[2:16:53] spiritual Realm
[2:16:55] and he taught demonology that he called
[2:16:58] enticing spirit
[2:17:03] so that's the three realm of demonology
[2:17:05] brother Brandon preach now he's going to
[2:17:08] draw a story here I want you to listen
[2:17:10] to us listen to me before we pray he
[2:17:13] says here in demonology too the
[2:17:16] religious dream he says and I have got a
[2:17:19] vision wrote out here I want you people
[2:17:23] to get the benefit of faith
[2:17:26] what happened in December
[2:17:30] I was in the room one morning when the
[2:17:33] angel of the Lord came in you see when I
[2:17:37] was over there I disobeyed God
[2:17:40] and I picked up
[2:17:43] I remember that was over in South Africa
[2:17:46] but Brandon went for the campaign and
[2:17:48] the Lord told him to go with Sandy
[2:17:50] Jackson but he listened to the rest of
[2:17:52] the ministers because they have already
[2:17:54] booked you know they have booked they
[2:17:57] have taken money from their friends they
[2:18:00] wanted to have big campaigns and they
[2:18:01] put a lot of pressure on brother Brennan
[2:18:03] so brother Brandon had to go with them
[2:18:06] so that is what he's narrating him
[2:18:09] praise the Lord
[2:18:11] amen
[2:18:18] I keep quiet a little bit here
[2:18:21] because
[2:18:23] of the carnival
[2:18:25] humidity that was in
[2:18:28] this man's life
[2:18:31] with the kind of forgive that he had
[2:18:34] brother Brown I'm still waiting he's
[2:18:36] still high healing service
[2:18:38] people got healed during the meetings
[2:18:41] but he knew he was out of the way of God
[2:18:45] he never came by justifying himself
[2:18:51] he never came justifying himself he
[2:18:54] never came blaming those people
[2:18:57] he said I disobey
[2:19:10] and any man knows what
[2:19:12] I mean by this it's a parasite
[2:19:17] that gets nearly kill you and because I
[2:19:21] have done something God told me not to
[2:19:24] do
[2:19:25] how many heard the story of faith I
[2:19:28] guess some of you
[2:19:31] I know the folks of the Tabernacle had a
[2:19:34] story God told me to go
[2:19:39] told me to go to a place and to stay
[2:19:43] away from this place
[2:19:47] and then go back over to another place
[2:19:51] so he was supposed to go to Cindy
[2:19:52] Jackson God wanted him to take a rest
[2:19:54] from the Johannesburg meetings and and
[2:19:57] go to Sunny Jackson and then he was
[2:19:59] supposed to go to Delbert because in the
[2:20:01] vision that he saw of South Africa it
[2:20:03] was the black people that was in the
[2:20:05] vision so he was supposed to go to to
[2:20:08] Dublin but in South Africa at the time
[2:20:11] apata was ruling and those ministers
[2:20:14] that hosted brother Branham in in
[2:20:15] Johannesburg was trying to stop him from
[2:20:18] going to Delvin
[2:20:21] praise praise the Lord
[2:20:25] maybe he might answer some of your
[2:20:27] racist question around the message
[2:20:30] there was no streak of racism
[2:20:34] in their prophet of God
[2:20:40] this is not a white man message
[2:20:43] this is a message for the children of
[2:20:44] God
[2:20:57] I've done something that God told me not
[2:20:59] to do how many hear the story okay he
[2:21:01] says he gives the people on the
[2:21:02] Tabernacle there he says and God told me
[2:21:05] to go to a place and stay away from this
[2:21:07] place and then
[2:21:09] go back over to to another place and I
[2:21:14] let the preachers talk me out of it
[2:21:18] now
[2:21:20] preachers
[2:21:22] are wonderful
[2:21:25] I'm one of them
[2:21:28] praise the Lord preachers are wonderful
[2:21:32] and they are my brothers
[2:21:35] but you mind what God tells you
[2:21:40] wish me no matter what a preacher says
[2:21:43] bring it back to the word
[2:21:47] This Is What God Says
[2:21:50] bring it back toward the word
[2:21:56] God don't play favoritism
[2:22:02] when Moses disobeyed he stopped him from
[2:22:04] seeing the Promised Land
[2:22:09] says preachers are wonderful they are my
[2:22:12] brother but you mind what God tells you
[2:22:14] that's right see
[2:22:16] you got one Mission now listen to this
[2:22:20] now listen to this brother Branham is
[2:22:22] preaching
[2:22:24] a religious realm of demonology
[2:22:28] and now he's he's creating a scene
[2:22:33] to say disobeying the word of God made
[2:22:37] him to be exposed to Demons
[2:22:40] those amoeba were demons
[2:22:44] praise the Lord
[2:22:46] amen
[2:22:49] betterbam never went around uh uh
[2:22:52] Barfield in the South African water or
[2:22:54] run around to parties and and or living
[2:22:56] wrong
[2:23:00] he just disobeyed God's word
[2:23:03] and he got exposed to Demons that was
[2:23:06] afflecting his body
[2:23:15] now listen to this now he says
[2:23:18] how many how many remember one time
[2:23:22] there was two prophets in the bible
[2:23:27] and one of them
[2:23:29] said the Lord told me
[2:23:31] to go to a certain place that's in the
[2:23:34] book of Kings the man of Judah
[2:23:37] the man of Judea that
[2:23:40] a young man passing
[2:23:42] and the law says don't stop don't eat
[2:23:45] don't turn around
[2:23:48] just go forward
[2:23:50] and we'll make him to turn around
[2:23:54] a preacher
[2:23:56] a prophet he says the Lord revealed to
[2:23:59] me last night that you should come to my
[2:24:02] house and have a meal
[2:24:04] I think you need to go and read that in
[2:24:06] your Bible
[2:24:08] what was happening demonology
[2:24:11] that God killed that Prophet Allah no
[2:24:14] God slay the man of Judah because he
[2:24:17] disobeyed God's word
[2:24:19] then brother Branham says
[2:24:22] religious spirit
[2:24:24] religious demon
[2:24:28] it can prophesied in God's name
[2:24:31] they can tell you a dream and tell you a
[2:24:33] vision it can be exactly to the place
[2:24:53] you love the Lord
[2:24:56] praise the Lord
[2:24:58] oh Hallelujah
[2:25:02] what a wonderful wonderful God we have
[2:25:05] amen
[2:25:12] am I scaring you
[2:25:14] okay
[2:25:19] we just pray for you that's all we can
[2:25:21] do
[2:25:28] so you read first king chapter 13 when
[2:25:30] you get home you see the entire story
[2:25:31] there don't have time to read it
[2:25:34] so you can write in your notes and read
[2:25:36] the whole thing he said so you remember
[2:25:39] one time two prophets in the bible
[2:25:43] and one of them the Lord told him said
[2:25:45] you go and to a setting place and don't
[2:25:51] don't you come to him you go back
[2:25:54] another way and so far don't come back
[2:25:57] and said don't you eat or drink while
[2:26:00] you are dead and another true Prophet
[2:26:04] another truth prophet
[2:26:09] met him and said the Lord met me after
[2:26:14] he met you
[2:26:16] and said come to my house
[2:26:20] and the prophet listened to what the
[2:26:22] other one said
[2:26:24] and lost his life
[2:26:29] see
[2:26:30] you do what God tells you to do
[2:26:33] regardless of what anybody anybody as
[2:26:36] she says
[2:26:37] and just like I said God will not tell
[2:26:40] you anything out of his word so you have
[2:26:42] to bring it back to the word of God
[2:26:44] foreign
[2:26:54] let me let me start just close up with
[2:26:57] another one yeah I know what you want at
[2:26:58] the end time but when the Seven Seals
[2:27:02] become and open those Mysteries and
[2:27:05] reveal them
[2:27:07] that's when the frogs three unclean
[2:27:10] Spirit like frost come out come out to
[2:27:14] manifest themselves
[2:27:16] a trinity Doctrine against the truth
[2:27:21] before it was honored political powers
[2:27:26] it was able to unite
[2:27:30] the threeisms
[2:27:34] but when the seals were opened God
[2:27:37] expose it as a religious
[2:27:40] demon
[2:27:42] a trinity spirit that have fought
[2:27:44] against the truth all alone
[2:27:48] he's never able to bring the people to a
[2:27:51] life in Christ
[2:27:52] it's enough to bring you to a church
[2:27:55] member
[2:27:57] it can even make you
[2:27:59] argue and fight against the word of God
[2:28:02] is never able to bring you to a talking
[2:28:04] life
[2:28:12] praise the Lord
[2:28:17] now I wanted to go in this way
[2:28:20] Mary Magdalene in the first resurrection
[2:28:25] praise the Lord
[2:28:32] can I close with this brother bam said
[2:28:34] in a message in deckman he says
[2:28:37] as I read a book one time called the
[2:28:40] prince
[2:28:41] of the House of David if you have not
[2:28:43] read that book you should find it and
[2:28:45] read it and this is even there they are
[2:28:47] even audio uh uh I listen to the entire
[2:28:51] all the beautiful book beautiful but
[2:28:53] dramatized it's a fiction story
[2:28:56] is a fiction story
[2:28:58] praise the Lord
[2:29:01] it's a fiction story so you just you
[2:29:03] have to you have to uh but it's a story
[2:29:07] that is dramatized of of uh it's it's
[2:29:11] fictionally dramatized of of a ladies
[2:29:15] testimony
[2:29:18] so it's a true testimony but it there is
[2:29:21] law of fiction that is hard to Aid
[2:29:23] to make make the story look beautiful
[2:29:26] so he says here it was it was uh wrote
[2:29:31] bad in Graham the attorney Graham
[2:29:34] wonderful book It's a drama
[2:29:37] supposed to be
[2:29:39] a partly truth of some old manuscript
[2:29:43] that was taking off of a woman knee
[2:29:46] again now you see and that's where
[2:29:49] sometimes um
[2:29:52] you know we we as as message Believers
[2:29:57] we we have to be we have to learn you
[2:30:01] know and just pray that the Lord will be
[2:30:03] able to help us you know uh
[2:30:05] [Music]
[2:30:07] this this prophet of God was was of
[2:30:10] seventh grade education and there's
[2:30:12] nothing you cannot you can actually
[2:30:13] expect to come out of him if God never
[2:30:15] brought it out of him
[2:30:17] praise the Lord
[2:30:18] well you see he brought a brand name
[2:30:20] never used
[2:30:22] his education as a crutches
[2:30:27] he never used it as a crutches
[2:30:29] neither did he use his Divine gift
[2:30:33] to just go to bed and sleep
[2:30:35] right
[2:30:38] right no
[2:30:39] the prophet of God exercised himself in
[2:30:42] reading things
[2:30:44] he read history
[2:30:47] he read things
[2:30:52] praise the Lord
[2:30:53] he was a man that gave himself
[2:30:56] to Mush reading and praying
[2:31:00] brother Brandon will lock himself up
[2:31:03] and read history
[2:31:07] just like I said Wednesday night because
[2:31:08] of the responsibility that was on his
[2:31:11] shoulder
[2:31:12] he could have come and taught us that
[2:31:14] everything he said the angel told him to
[2:31:16] say it brother Branham never said that
[2:31:18] don't say that
[2:31:21] now everything brother Branham said the
[2:31:22] angel told him to say he said but when
[2:31:25] it comes to those seals
[2:31:29] he said I have never preached a message
[2:31:35] every time brother Branham said it
[2:31:37] before he comes out
[2:31:38] an angel comes down and correct his note
[2:31:48] praise the Lord now he's telling us
[2:31:50] something here I just have to say they
[2:31:53] are so uh to make a point
[2:31:55] praise the lord we find people also that
[2:31:57] go you know and read different books and
[2:31:59] they're just flying all over the place
[2:32:02] you have to bring it back to the word
[2:32:04] amen
[2:32:06] some people don't know how to use the
[2:32:07] thinking man's favor if you don't know
[2:32:09] how to use the thinking benefit read
[2:32:11] your Bible and the message
[2:32:14] praise the Lord just read your Bible in
