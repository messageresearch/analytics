[15:43] one amen
[15:44] he's the one that we have to see that
[15:46] when you see him your attitude of
[15:48] worship will completely be different

[46:39] shall be seated amen
[46:42] i told one i said it's going to be a
[46:44] short service amen i think
[46:47] we can just say praise god and go home
[46:49] at this point in time amen amen
[46:52] it's good to be in the presence of god
[46:56] i want to use this time to appreciate
[47:00] god for his grace in everyone of yours
[47:03] life
[47:04] i want to also appreciate god for sister
[47:06] naomi
[47:08] you've always been in our prayers um
[47:11] i think when we when we moved our 2016
[47:15] uh
[47:16] she was she sent us a send us a card
[47:19] and i really cherished that and also
[47:22] the
[47:23] wedding invitation for sister fate and
[47:25] we appreciate that
[47:29] thankful to god tonight
[47:32] i pray god uh
[47:34] bring an awareness upon us that will
[47:36] begin to take us from ourselves
[47:39] and actually begin to give us a true
[47:41] realization
[47:43] because if there is anything we really
[47:45] need we need a true realization
[47:50] we've had we've had enough of religion
[47:53] right and religion have spilled into
[47:55] god's blessings right so if there is
[47:57] anything we need it's just the
[47:59] realization of what god really wanted
[48:02] that's right
[48:04] i think we still have time to
[48:07] to be
[48:08] to be pointing uh at people
[48:12] uh instead of really realizing who we
[48:14] are
[48:15] and so
[48:18] there's a miscommunication somewhere
[48:20] and i pray god tonight that god will
[48:22] give entrance to my heart
[48:24] and to your heart
[48:26] so we can really we can really address
[48:29] the business of god
[48:31] because the business of god has been
[48:33] misunderstood
[48:35] and
[48:36] it's not just
[48:37] it's not just now
[48:39] it has been it has been a pattern that
[48:42] god brings a blessing the blessing is
[48:44] misunderstood
[48:45] and the people that the blessing was uh
[48:48] given to
[48:50] they feel so great
[48:52] and they begin to point fingers on other
[48:54] people
[48:55] condemning other people
[48:57] failing to see
[48:58] that they have not attained the blessing
[49:01] it happened to israel
[49:03] and paul in the book of romans will warn
[49:05] the gentiles which is you and me
[49:08] that don't don't vote don't bows don't
[49:10] both but unfortunately people don't read
[49:13] that scripture to see that warning they
[49:16] say don't both see because you are the
[49:18] you're the white vine
[49:20] that was grafted on the original vine
[49:24] the white olive that was grafted on the
[49:26] original olive it said don't boast
[49:29] because the original olive was cut off
[49:32] and so you've been the wide that was
[49:34] grafted in
[49:36] how do you think you commit the same
[49:38] crime that they committed and you you
[49:40] think you're going to remain there say
[49:42] don't do that say because you're going
[49:43] to be cut off so he saw that by prophecy
[49:46] that the gentiles when they get the
[49:48] blessing that israel had they would be
[49:51] as arrogant as israel because jesus said
[49:54] we are the people of god we are the
[49:56] people of god even when they were
[49:58] rejecting god they were still tapping
[50:00] their chest that we are the people of
[50:02] god even when they took god and nailed
[50:05] him on the cross they said we are god's
[50:07] people
[50:08] and they even told god jump down from
[50:09] the cross and we will see if you are the
[50:11] right thing that you claim
[50:13] so when paul won the gentiles before
[50:16] this thing really swept into
[50:18] where it is today paul warned in the
[50:21] infancy he said don't
[50:24] boast i don't know what scripture i'm
[50:27] going to read tonight but i just feel
[50:29] like going to the book of mark luke
[50:32] chapter
[50:34] 19 i think brother brown will that's not
[50:36] what i want to read but uh as i'm
[50:38] talking that is kind of he's kind of
[50:40] taking me into that right away and he
[50:44] you could see in the book of luke 19 i
[50:46] think that's where he took the story of
[50:48] zacchaeus and before he could take the
[50:50] story of zacchaeus in chapter 18 there
[50:54] was something very unique in chapter 18
[50:56] that played out in chapter 19 because if
[51:00] you read luke chapter 18 you will see
[51:02] the lord jesus talked about the publican
[51:05] and the pharisee
[51:07] so this way this is what he talked about
[51:09] in chapter 18 and when he spilled into
[51:12] 19 you will now see the story of
[51:14] zacchaeus and if you look at what the
[51:16] bible calls the curse he was called the
[51:19] chief publican he was not just a public
[51:21] guy he has a degree
[51:23] he was a certified publican
[51:25] he he earned his degree as a publican so
[51:28] but if you read chapter 18 the lord was
[51:31] talking about the publican and the
[51:34] pharisee and so when we're not advert
[51:37] into chapter chapter 19 we now saw the
[51:40] chief publican
[51:44] who saw the chief publican
[51:46] and now before we entered into the chief
[51:48] publican there was something so unique
[51:50] there was a pharisee
[51:52] that was something so unique about that
[51:54] pharisee now when you look at that story
[51:57] then you're not diving to the prophet of
[51:59] god shedding light on that buddha brown
[52:02] would tell us what a pharisee mean he
[52:05] said pharisee is an actor
[52:09] that's what abraham said he said
[52:11] pharisee is an actor he knows how to act
[52:15] so but a publican is a man that is
[52:17] living his life
[52:19] he's just a deadly man he's dead into
[52:21] the core
[52:23] so he gave us two categories of people a
[52:26] pharisee this man is an actor
[52:29] he knows the script
[52:31] and it's not just an actor he acts as
[52:33] certain script it's a religious script
[52:37] the script that the pharisee act is a
[52:38] religious script and so that religious
[52:40] script is given to him he acts it to the
[52:42] core
[52:43] that even when you see the real article
[52:46] you're going to choose the actor more
[52:48] than the article itself
[52:50] so but the lord jesus played out the
[52:52] story and showed us the pharisee and he
[52:55] showed us the publican and he would tell
[52:58] us that these two men they went into the
[53:00] temple to pray
[53:03] and while they went into the temple to
[53:05] pray he said the pharisee
[53:08] because he's an actor
[53:10] and he started playing out a script
[53:13] he said lord i pay my tithe
[53:15] is it good he could tap his chest
[53:18] because he was following the script
[53:20] he said i pay my tithe i pay my offering
[53:23] i am not like that baptist brother that
[53:25] is laying on the altar i'm not like that
[53:27] a catholic guy that's laying on the
[53:29] altar confessing this i'm not like that
[53:31] guy at all
[53:33] you see he was standing in god's
[53:35] presence
[53:36] and he had the audacity to justify
[53:39] himself before his creator
[53:42] he was so bold
[53:44] that when he stood before his creator he
[53:46] didn't see need of any it was not
[53:49] communicating he said
[53:51] he stood in the presence of god and was
[53:54] wrecking it was wrecking somebody who
[53:57] came just as he was
[53:59] but he is an actor he's not coming the
[54:01] ways he's telling god i paid my time i
[54:04] pay my offering those were the things he
[54:05] was doing that make him feel where i can
[54:08] tap my chest i am i am worthy of this
[54:10] altar i am wanting to stand here in your
[54:13] presence
[54:15] and he said i'm not i'm not like that
[54:17] guy
[54:18] that is just laying down there
[54:20] and that guy came and when he came to
[54:23] the altar he could you create a song
[54:25] being sung jose
[54:28] i am without
[54:31] one plea and then he lay down on the
[54:33] floor he said god be merciful to me a
[54:36] sinner
[54:40] mercy lord
[54:42] because he he met business
[54:44] he was not coming to say lord give me
[54:46] promotion let my job go well if those
[54:49] things were not part of the discussion
[54:51] on the altar that's not what the author
[54:52] is for
[54:54] the author was not elected to give you
[54:56] job the author was not elected to give
[54:58] you promotion in school the author is
[55:00] not erected to make you have in your
[55:02] classes the author was elected to
[55:04] connect man back aboard
[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] if you want to have air your classes
[55:09] read your book you pass
[55:11] nobody was born out of the mother's womb
[55:13] with a pain i'm telling you the gospel
[55:15] truth nobody was born out of the
[55:17] mother's womb with a chemistry textbook
[55:19] if you read you will pass
[55:21] there is no downside there is nobody
[55:24] that i said don't let nobody tell you
[55:25] that if you study you're going to pass
[55:29] so the author was not made for you to
[55:30] pass chemistry physics have good job
[55:33] that's not what this author is for the
[55:35] other jesus no was not nerd on the cross
[55:38] so you wear good clothes and eat chicken
[55:40] that's the part of it
[55:43] that adam did not fell from eating good
[55:45] chicken
[55:46] i don't fear from a relationship with
[55:48] this creator
[55:52] it was not a bad chicken it wasn't about
[55:54] good clothing it has no connection with
[55:56] that where adam fell from is where we
[55:59] are going back to
[56:00] it's not a good job if i have fun
[56:03] it isn't far from trekking around
[56:05] brooklyn park
[56:06] it didn't fare from renting houses i
[56:08] said well god i can't just stay in rent
[56:11] all my life i need to have my own man so
[56:12] that was not what adam fell from
[56:14] adam fell from a relationship with this
[56:17] creator
[56:19] and so that's where god is taking you
[56:21] and me to back to a relationship with
[56:24] him
[56:27] and this man just came just as he was
[56:30] and lay
[56:32] flat on the altar he said be merciful to
[56:35] me a sinner i tell you what he was
[56:38] having a communication
[56:40] and that's what we want to have when we
[56:41] come to a prayer meeting we want to have
[56:43] communication with god
[56:45] when you have queen with your wife and
[56:47] and things are going rough in your home
[56:49] and you come here and you're like oh
[56:50] lord i pray for the healing option so
[56:52] how can god heal when you are going back
[56:54] home with bitterness in your heart
[56:57] just come the way you are yes amen
[57:00] just come and say let us have priority
[57:02] oh god be merciful to us the blessings
[57:05] of god have become a reproach to the
[57:07] church
[57:09] it has going to be the topic tonight
[57:12] the blessings have become the reproach
[57:15] the blessings of god has become the
[57:17] reproach to the church
[57:21] people coming to the altar and asking
[57:23] for god to touch it bringing the real
[57:25] article to god god i'm i'm about to
[57:28] divorce my wife i'm really angry right
[57:30] now come to the altar that's what is
[57:32] going on amen that is what is going on
[57:36] come to the altar with that and god with
[57:38] that's what god wants you to talk about
[57:40] it's not talking about your job that's
[57:42] not your problem your problem is what is
[57:44] really going on in your heart all those
[57:46] weakeners that dark shadows are
[57:48] revolving in your heart god wants to
[57:50] have that
[57:52] conversation doesn't want you acting up
[57:55] on the seventh c and all that is the
[57:57] real seventh c but i said the seventh c
[57:59] is the end of all things
[58:01] that's right it's the end of time it's
[58:03] the end of the struggling nature is the
[58:06] end of what
[58:09] this struggling nature
[58:11] so that's a struggling nature
[58:14] the end of it is the presence of god
[58:17] discipleship christ coming down to you
[58:20] to have a relationship
[58:22] with you
[58:24] amen let's ask of tonight i've stolen
[58:26] the book of
[58:27] matthew

[58:31] service we've already prayed and we're
[58:33] just going to read the word and we say
[58:34] amen and then we

[58:56] chapter 3 and then we're going to read
[58:58] the book of luke
[59:00] now those three scripture that's the
[59:01] reason we're going to read them because

[59:21] and we are also thankful to you lord
[59:23] that you have opened the channel through
[59:25] a message in the hour
[59:27] and you told your prophet right from the
[59:29] very beginning of his ministry you gave
[59:32] him a condition
[59:34] if only thou will be sincere
[59:37] lord's sincerity became the core of the
[59:39] calling

[59:43] prayer not even cancer lord here we are
[59:46] today we want oh god to pray

[59:53] condition

[59:58] father that we may revert back to the
[1:00:00] calling
[1:00:01] to be sincere
[1:00:03] lord your prophet came to the end of his
[1:00:05] ministry
[1:00:06] he said god told me i am not sincere
[1:00:08] enough
[1:00:09] he said i have to be more sincere
[1:00:11] you see i have to fast i have to pray i
[1:00:13] have to go through purgatory to please
[1:00:16] myself to be more sincere because god
[1:00:19] said i am not sincere enough
[1:00:21] lord which saw the life of that man
[1:00:24] and lord we know how sincere he was
[1:00:27] how he tried to do things just the way

[1:00:48] may your word find interest in our heart
[1:00:51] in our homes and lead us will go to a
[1:00:53] revival as a family this reacts oh god
[1:00:56] in jesus name we pray with thanksgiving
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:01] so we're reading from the book of
[1:01:02] matthew chapter 10 verse 1.
[1:01:13] when he had called unto him
[1:01:15] his 12 disciples he gave them power
[1:01:18] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:01:20] and to heal all manner of sickness
[1:01:23] in all manner of diseases
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] gave them power to heal all manner of
[1:01:31] sickness and all manner of diseases we
[1:01:34] read mark chapter 6 verse 7
[1:01:36] and he called unto him 12
[1:01:39] and began to send them forth by 2 and 2
[1:01:43] and gave them power over unclean spirits
[1:01:49] he gave them power over unclean spirit
[1:01:54] now take note of that because that's
[1:01:56] what we are going to dwell on for the
[1:01:59] the
[1:02:00] few minutes that we will have tonight
[1:02:03] we're going to dwell on that it gave
[1:02:04] them power over
[1:02:07] unclean spirit
[1:02:11] all right that's uh
[1:02:13] gave them power over on clean spirit
[1:02:16] and commanded them that they should take
[1:02:19] nothing for their journey save staff
[1:02:22] only no script no bread no money in
[1:02:25] their pores and also the book of luke
[1:02:30] luke chapter
[1:02:32] nine verse one then he called his
[1:02:35] disciple he called his twelve disciples
[1:02:37] together and gave them power and
[1:02:39] authority over all devils and to cure
[1:02:42] diseases shall be seated with lord
[1:02:44] blessing to the reading of his word amen
[1:02:50] so we find out we're just going to
[1:02:51] really uh slow down and and and examine
[1:02:54] those scriptures
[1:02:56] you find out that we start the scripture
[1:02:58] uh continuing the message of sunday
[1:03:00] quickening power you see we most of the
[1:03:03] time when we when we hear the
[1:03:05] terminology but abram used to address
[1:03:07] the same old thing
[1:03:09] people already they already
[1:03:11] intellectually interpreted it in their
[1:03:13] mind and so they feed their emotional
[1:03:16] bucket
[1:03:17] as that world is coming quickly power
[1:03:19] they're jumping but they don't really
[1:03:20] understand what quickening power is
[1:03:24] because everybody has an understanding
[1:03:26] of what they think it means
[1:03:28] but we have to allow the world to tell
[1:03:29] us what quickly the power is
[1:03:31] so
[1:03:32] uh
[1:03:34] jesus took home to him 12 disciples
[1:03:36] and when he called his 12 disciples the
[1:03:38] bible said in matthew 10 and when he
[1:03:40] according to him his twelve disciples he
[1:03:42] gave them power now i'm going to really
[1:03:45] spare time a little bit to emphasize
[1:03:47] here but you used the word it gave them
[1:03:50] power against unclean spirit now take
[1:03:52] that word against
[1:03:55] now when you say against it means there
[1:03:57] is a combat involved
[1:03:59] it's war
[1:04:01] right now you're going to see how why
[1:04:03] this this people they tell the same
[1:04:05] story but they use different
[1:04:07] descriptions there's a purpose for it
[1:04:09] because the different description this
[1:04:11] theory uh uh
[1:04:13] uh
[1:04:13] peace to use
[1:04:15] they have a dealing on how god wanted to
[1:04:18] handle this devil in your life
[1:04:20] you're gonna see it so matthew in in his
[1:04:24] way of writing he would say this way and
[1:04:26] when he had called unto him his 12
[1:04:29] disciples he gave them power against
[1:04:32] unclean spirit now i'm giving you a task
[1:04:35] tonight when you go home
[1:04:38] put your message search and type the
[1:04:40] word unclean spirit
[1:04:42] you see because we we've gone where the
[1:04:44] days when you are trying to read the
[1:04:46] quotes to go give somebody no no no he's
[1:04:48] reading for yourself now because you at
[1:04:51] this world this is all about you
[1:04:53] this is all about you
[1:04:55] you are this way it's all about you all
[1:04:57] the struggle and the struggle to preach
[1:04:59] it's all about you
[1:05:01] because you and the world
[1:05:03] ephesians 4 will tell us that the
[1:05:04] five-fold ministry is giving what the
[1:05:06] identification to bring you it is about
[1:05:09] you
[1:05:10] it has zero to do with the ministry it's
[1:05:13] you
[1:05:14] it's all about you
[1:05:15] it's god trying to show you something
[1:05:18] and what god is trying to show you
[1:05:19] sister he's trying to show you yourself
[1:05:22] in the bible
[1:05:24] and people have missed that
[1:05:28] we see spending time on the historical
[1:05:30] the historical part of our journey our
[1:05:32] journey as a body of christ has
[1:05:34] historical part paul is history in our
[1:05:37] journey peter is his story in our
[1:05:38] journey this is the present tense of the
[1:05:41] journey that we are in but abram is
[1:05:43] history in our journey see that is
[1:05:45] strange yes
[1:05:46] it's history in our journey
[1:05:49] and so when you begin to dwell in
[1:05:51] history and you refuse to move with what
[1:05:54] god wants to move with you miss where
[1:05:56] you going to
[1:05:57] now we are going somewhere and where are
[1:05:59] we going to we are going to the image of
[1:06:01] the world
[1:06:04] we are going to be that world how can we
[1:06:06] be that one we don't know we are that's
[1:06:08] why god sent the prophet
[1:06:10] so that the prophet can carry you by the
[1:06:11] scripture open the scripture to you so
[1:06:13] you can see yourself when the prophet
[1:06:15] opened the scripture we were able to see
[1:06:17] him and a lot of people stop right there
[1:06:19] brother one they stopped right there i
[1:06:22] seen buddha bro
[1:06:24] now how many of us believe that buddha
[1:06:25] brahma is the prophet in here tonight
[1:06:27] raise up your hand
[1:06:31] okay yeah i just went down all of it
[1:06:32] sorry what's wrong with that
[1:06:34] before i turn around there i didn't even
[1:06:36] see who raised up your hand
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:40] yeah keep that that's
[1:06:43] i wanted to call your name bro because
[1:06:45] because these days we don't know who is
[1:06:47] who anymore yes so we are free we are
[1:06:49] free to express ourselves amen
[1:06:52] so that's i'm talking about the history
[1:06:54] that is history that you believe that
[1:06:57] abraham is a prophet it's easy it
[1:06:59] doesn't mean you are a christian
[1:07:01] they never believe you before you were
[1:07:02] born
[1:07:03] amen that's right
[1:07:05] you see these are the things that we
[1:07:07] begin to use to tap our chest and we
[1:07:10] feel that we are bright that does not
[1:07:11] make you bright
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:13] never believed that same thing he knows
[1:07:15] it
[1:07:16] before you were born the devil knows
[1:07:17] that
[1:07:18] that for abraham is malacca for he knows
[1:07:20] it
[1:07:24] so but abram is malacca for that's not
[1:07:26] an argument
[1:07:27] there are so many of us right now if
[1:07:29] they were to bring some men with
[1:07:31] ammunition maybe m16 i said now say it
[1:07:34] do you believe what the brahman is the
[1:07:35] prophet write that himself and it's my
[1:07:38] father i believe it
[1:07:39] i
[1:07:40] i just come to church i have to be
[1:07:42] obedient to my parents i'm there with my
[1:07:44] father that's him behind you my father
[1:07:46] is right there at the backseat the back
[1:07:48] row that's my dad right there
[1:07:51] say pat can you tell him that you're the
[1:07:53] one that brought me to church
[1:07:55] you know how i used to respond you you
[1:07:57] brought me here
[1:07:59] that's what they will say but i tell you
[1:08:01] the fact when you wreck that thing there
[1:08:02] are some people that will die believing
[1:08:05] that brother abraham is a prophet
[1:08:08] because it was not told to them they
[1:08:10] caught the revelation
[1:08:15] but that is not the zenith but that's
[1:08:18] not the zenith of what we're going to do
[1:08:20] because god did not send for abraham so
[1:08:22] you will believe that i said prophet
[1:08:24] that was not that was not with the
[1:08:25] brahms ministry but the bran's ministry
[1:08:27] was not to tell you that he's a prophet
[1:08:29] that's not his ministry but the brown's
[1:08:30] ministry was to get christ a bride that
[1:08:33] was his ministry
[1:08:36] so believing that i say prophet doesn't
[1:08:37] make you anything right
[1:08:40] now by believing who you are
[1:08:43] by the word that he preached that make
[1:08:45] you something yes
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:48] the problem that paula brown ministry
[1:08:50] have with the pentecostal world today
[1:08:53] anytime you stumble online they
[1:08:55] acknowledge that he was a great man of
[1:08:57] god
[1:08:58] because they have seen great men of god
[1:09:00] before but what they have never seen
[1:09:02] they have never seen a man of god that
[1:09:05] takes scriptural identity
[1:09:08] it has never happened right
[1:09:09] even paul himself did not take
[1:09:11] scriptural identity
[1:09:14] have you read any part in your bible say
[1:09:16] malacca spoke about me it's not in the
[1:09:18] bible
[1:09:19] did you read any reports say joshua
[1:09:21] spoke about me it's not in the bible but
[1:09:24] paul knew that he was an apostle but he
[1:09:26] never took a scriptural identity in the
[1:09:28] altar he never did because in paul's day
[1:09:31] there was no new testament the bible
[1:09:33] ended in malacca paul never pointed
[1:09:35] himself in any of those scripture
[1:09:37] he never you would not say to your bible
[1:09:40] even though he was the first messenger
[1:09:42] of the age he never showed himself this
[1:09:45] is me he never did that
[1:09:47] but here comes a ministry that we have
[1:09:49] never seen that time before
[1:09:52] now because that ministry was oh god
[1:09:54] help me tonight that means it was christ
[1:09:57] christ coming down to show people that
[1:09:59] i'm here
[1:10:01] and so the only way he could do it he
[1:10:03] has to send a ministry they have a
[1:10:05] scriptural identity
[1:10:07] that that ministry have to be showing
[1:10:09] you it's not telling you i have no if
[1:10:10] you begin to see that ministry in peace
[1:10:13] to prayers to pray to peace from the old
[1:10:15] testament into the new you could see
[1:10:18] that meaning sunday
[1:10:20] but that's not the end of the story that
[1:10:22] solidify your faith that you are
[1:10:24] following the right person
[1:10:26] now when you know you are following the
[1:10:27] right person the journey has not started
[1:10:29] yet you are solidified i'm following the
[1:10:31] right person now when the person that
[1:10:33] you are following now tells you that you
[1:10:35] are in the world your turn is complete
[1:10:39] you have seen the man you are following
[1:10:42] has shown you
[1:10:43] himself in the world he has sold himself
[1:10:46] in the world and then when he brings his
[1:10:48] message he said the message is you
[1:10:50] brother
[1:10:52] oh glory to god
[1:10:54] and then you tell me that i i i will no
[1:10:56] longer believe the message the message
[1:10:57] is me how can i deny it i cannot am i
[1:11:00] crazy
[1:11:02] i can be poor but i'm not crazy right
[1:11:05] i had no hope something came to show me
[1:11:08] that i am in god's bible and you are
[1:11:10] telling me that that thing is false
[1:11:11] that's right
[1:11:12] what can you show me about myself
[1:11:16] what what can you show me about myself
[1:11:19] i tell you what even your father cannot
[1:11:21] show you the best about yourself
[1:11:23] your mother cannot show you the best
[1:11:25] about yourself but you become a message
[1:11:27] that is showing you the best about
[1:11:30] yourself
[1:11:31] and somebody is telling you that that
[1:11:33] message is false cloud did not appear
[1:11:36] declared smoke this is okay if rockets
[1:11:38] show me why i am in the bible i believe
[1:11:40] that rocket right
[1:11:42] i have to believe that rocket if a
[1:11:45] rocket shows you who you are in god's
[1:11:46] word you have to believe that rocket
[1:11:51] she's a jet smoke if a jet smoke show me
[1:11:53] who i am in my bible i would be so
[1:11:55] stupid not to believe that yet spoke
[1:11:58] yeah because the jasmine did not show me
[1:12:00] who i am in america he showed me who i
[1:12:02] am in the bible
[1:12:04] i will believe that smoke
[1:12:06] after a burning bush showed moses who
[1:12:09] moses walked out
[1:12:11] so if a burning bush could show moses
[1:12:13] whom was this was why won't i believe in
[1:12:15] a jedi
[1:12:17] if a jet smoke showed me who i am
[1:12:19] because moses for 80 years this man was
[1:12:22] running he thought he was a general he
[1:12:23] thought he was the head of the egyptian
[1:12:25] navy he thought was the head of the
[1:12:27] egyptian air force all those were just
[1:12:29] what he thought because their muscles
[1:12:31] were still flowing you know what i'm
[1:12:33] saying but when was 80 years old all
[1:12:35] those muscles were sagging
[1:12:37] he was no more than master man that was
[1:12:39] on this picture that he was putting on
[1:12:40] facebook now he look old wagged out and
[1:12:43] there was nothing so great about him he
[1:12:45] was not a handsome man anymore at that
[1:12:47] point in time he saw a bunny bush that
[1:12:50] showed him beyond all of that and
[1:12:52] showing who he really is
[1:12:58] praise be to god we're going to stay
[1:13:00] true to the message we're going to stay
[1:13:02] treated so we're going to try to close
[1:13:03] quickly so
[1:13:04] in verse verse 1 of matthew 10
[1:13:07] matthew said and when he had called on
[1:13:10] to him his twelve disciples he gave them
[1:13:13] power against unclean spirit this is
[1:13:15] what dragged me into all of that now i
[1:13:17] said when you go home tap on clean
[1:13:18] spirit in your message search
[1:13:20] and when you tap on clean spirit look at
[1:13:23] your life those things but the brown
[1:13:24] call on clean spirit look at your life
[1:13:26] if they are there
[1:13:30] that's an assignment
[1:13:32] when you tap on clean spirit look don't
[1:13:34] see you but abraham is calling on
[1:13:36] clinton look at your life and see if
[1:13:39] they are there and if they are there
[1:13:41] they will start from matthew 10 1.
[1:13:43] and it gives you power and gains
[1:13:47] and this means there is war
[1:13:50] now in the media of portland oregon the
[1:13:53] maniac when that maniac came he said i'm
[1:13:55] going to i'm going to break every bones
[1:13:57] in your body right and buddha say you're
[1:14:00] going to bow down before me because
[1:14:01] you've come to challenge god and he said
[1:14:03] we're going to see who who invited them
[1:14:05] before and he lifted up his head but the
[1:14:07] message that man was so big that he
[1:14:08] could equal security straight
[1:14:11] because he has been broken the jaws of
[1:14:12] ministers he goes on the platform beat
[1:14:14] up the minister break all their bones
[1:14:16] and go his way but he met god
[1:14:21] he met god with a little man and when he
[1:14:23] raised up his son and was coming he fell
[1:14:26] down and he bowed down before brother
[1:14:28] brown
[1:14:30] and they asked for abraham that's why
[1:14:31] we're coming to matthew 10 1. but
[1:14:33] abraham wasn't delivered but abraham
[1:14:34] said no
[1:14:35] you know why but i'm not saying he loved
[1:14:37] that devil that's right he said wasn't
[1:14:39] that devil
[1:14:41] he worshiped that devil
[1:14:42] and when you worship your anger you're
[1:14:44] washing your temper you worship your
[1:14:46] loss you worship your pride they will
[1:14:48] still remain in you you could be a
[1:14:49] preacher you could be a strong leader
[1:14:51] those devils will be in you they are
[1:14:53] caught unclean spirit and you are
[1:14:55] supposed to be against them when you are
[1:14:58] against something that is where oh god
[1:15:00] help me
[1:15:02] let me read that again when you are
[1:15:04] against something then you will do
[1:15:05] exactly what matthew 10 say listen what
[1:15:07] you can say listen
[1:15:09] and he gave them power against on screen
[1:15:13] spirit to do what
[1:15:14] cast them out to do what yes
[1:15:17] when you hate something that's when you
[1:15:19] cast that thing out
[1:15:21] they say to take them out
[1:15:25] when you when you are casting out some
[1:15:27] you are angry you you are upset with
[1:15:29] that thing
[1:15:30] sarcastic my child
[1:15:32] that child was giving you some crazy
[1:15:34] mess get out of this house you put some
[1:15:37] tone to it
[1:15:39] hey johnny johnny get out that is so
[1:15:41] busy right now but when the tool changes
[1:15:44] and there's gravity behind it
[1:15:47] that is casting out
[1:15:48] you are really upset with what is going
[1:15:51] on and the bible say give them what
[1:15:53] power the power he gave you is to be
[1:15:56] against anything unclean in your life
[1:16:01] don't worry about the next man because
[1:16:03] that's how we misunderstand that
[1:16:04] scripture oh we're just going to lay
[1:16:05] hand cast out of place but no no no it
[1:16:07] is in your life right now watch for the
[1:16:09] full rescue slowly
[1:16:11] because when you've done that
[1:16:14] to cast an unclean spirit
[1:16:18] to be against unclean spirit to cast
[1:16:21] them out that the power that god give
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:24] is not to do anything but to be against
[1:16:27] the unclean spirit in your life and to
[1:16:29] send them parking
[1:16:31] to cast them out
[1:16:33] and after you have cast them see the way
[1:16:35] the scripture arrange it we're talking
[1:16:36] about healing healing there's no healing
[1:16:39] before you go into the step of the
[1:16:41] healing you must also forecast that the
[1:16:43] unclean spirit
[1:16:45] once unclean spirits have been casted
[1:16:47] out then there's no condemnation in your
[1:16:49] heart and the dog said if our heart
[1:16:51] condemns us not then we know that god
[1:16:53] outside us then you can pray from your
[1:16:55] heart at that point in time you can pray
[1:16:57] freely but you have to first of all cast
[1:17:00] out every ugly spirit
[1:17:05] you should be against them now might use
[1:17:08] the word against so much you set a war
[1:17:11] with this unclean spirit
[1:17:15] he sat there he he opened a warfront
[1:17:17] that you had to war with them he opened
[1:17:19] the war front now this is how mark who
[1:17:21] said
[1:17:23] max
[1:17:24] 6 7 and he called on to him the 12th
[1:17:28] and began to send them forth by two and
[1:17:31] two and gave them power over unclean
[1:17:35] spirit now watch that word over
[1:17:38] now to be against your fighting war to
[1:17:41] be over it means you are controlling
[1:17:45] him
[1:17:47] to be against his war
[1:17:50] now when you now have power over you are
[1:17:52] controlling you're in control
[1:17:55] so the power that god is giving you is
[1:17:57] to control that's why person modify your
[1:18:01] members bring them under control
[1:18:05] come on brother break them on everybody
[1:18:08] in this church this evening you are all
[1:18:10] pastors so don't blame your pastor
[1:18:13] because your own congregation they are
[1:18:15] running you crazy
[1:18:18] come on brother at least your pastors
[1:18:20] here have congregations of believers you
[1:18:23] know what i'm saying jordan you have
[1:18:24] congregation your own congregation they
[1:18:27] will never be saved
[1:18:29] that's what the bible said the bible
[1:18:30] says notify the members of your assembly
[1:18:33] the members
[1:18:36] the only commandment god gave you to
[1:18:38] your own church members is to bring them
[1:18:40] under control they will not be safe
[1:18:42] lost fornication these are devils yeah
[1:18:45] they are very ugly you will never be
[1:18:47] able to save them but you have to bring
[1:18:49] them under control
[1:18:52] to bring them under control so god said
[1:18:55] notify what your pastor know the members
[1:18:58] of your own congregation the members of
[1:19:00] your body so you are the pastor and you
[1:19:02] have members
[1:19:03] these are reckless members they can run
[1:19:05] you crazy they are crazy members and
[1:19:07] they make you crazy at times at times
[1:19:09] when people look at you they see your
[1:19:10] members
[1:19:12] right
[1:19:14] they say this is your member because
[1:19:15] someone will run you this way they run
[1:19:17] you that way they're going this way
[1:19:18] because you are failing to do what the
[1:19:20] scriptures say bring them under control
[1:19:25] and that's what mac is saying here
[1:19:27] that's why i say say he has gave them
[1:19:29] power
[1:19:30] over
[1:19:31] oh i love this
[1:19:33] let's say together and give them power
[1:19:35] over overwatch unclean spirits
[1:19:44] unclean spirit
[1:19:46] but abram said jesus cast that seven
[1:19:49] words
[1:19:50] unclean spirit from who mary magdalene
[1:19:53] now take time and read those seventies
[1:19:56] see you have to be honest to yourself
[1:19:59] you're gonna see them in your life so if
[1:20:01] put abraham call them
[1:20:02] devils in this woman why do you think
[1:20:05] that they are not devils in you
[1:20:07] you see when those same spirits are in
[1:20:09] you you call them say this society if
[1:20:10] you just offend me this i don't come to
[1:20:12] church again this is just how my my
[1:20:14] nature is that's how i used to do this
[1:20:16] brother it's an unclean spirit
[1:20:18] it's not how you are you are trying to
[1:20:20] deceive yourself to begin to believe
[1:20:22] that this unclean spirit is you it's not
[1:20:24] you
[1:20:26] that's right
[1:20:27] these are intelligence they speak
[1:20:30] the reason and they begin to break into
[1:20:33] your memory tell you the way pastor
[1:20:34] talked to me the way sister and naomi
[1:20:36] looked at me uh the way she's affected
[1:20:37] my point i think i do every time i did
[1:20:39] like this and they were suffering
[1:20:42] that is an intelligence talking to you
[1:20:45] that's not you thinking it is an
[1:20:46] intelligence talking to you
[1:20:52] let's say praise the lord
[1:20:54] we're going to come to this a few quotes
[1:20:56] like i said i'll keep a promise we're
[1:20:58] going to close
[1:20:59] i'm just going to read luke and then
[1:21:00] we're just going to read some few quotes
[1:21:02] and then we'll close the mission can
[1:21:03] come up just to let you know that we're
[1:21:05] going to close amen
[1:21:08] that's an assurance all the musicians
[1:21:10] can come up amen and just start playing
[1:21:12] so they will believe that we are
[1:21:14] actually close
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:20] yes we have to do so soon
[1:21:25] you have the message i just wanted to
[1:21:27] know that
[1:21:29] god will continue uh it won't fall the
[1:21:31] remaining part to you because it is all
[1:21:33] about you it's not there's no great
[1:21:35] thing it's not all about dress well or
[1:21:37] try there's nothing i'm going to say
[1:21:39] that will change you
[1:21:41] but if god can open a channel for you to
[1:21:43] see who you really are
[1:21:45] that's all
[1:21:47] your pastor
[1:21:48] brother
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:50] val
[1:21:51] and all the ministry that comes around
[1:21:53] that's what the genuine minister is
[1:21:54] struggling to do is to show you who you
[1:21:56] are it's gonna show you me what is me
[1:21:58] if you look at my journey i have gone
[1:22:00] through bumps
[1:22:03] but that thing that kept me
[1:22:05] and show me who i really am
[1:22:08] that's all you need to see who you
[1:22:10] really are
[1:22:12] because you're hearing another voice
[1:22:13] that is telling you this is not who you
[1:22:15] are you can't make it you're not going
[1:22:17] to go to heaven this is all about heaven
[1:22:19] and hell
[1:22:20] this is about identity who am i
[1:22:23] that's right but abram said in the
[1:22:25] message a trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:22:27] sound 1963
[1:22:30] but abram said no he said none of god's
[1:22:34] children we go to hell
[1:22:38] i was listening to that a few weeks ago
[1:22:39] coming from work i was just sharing with
[1:22:41] your brother
[1:22:42] and asking me a question that struck me
[1:22:45] so deep i have never in all my christian
[1:22:47] journey i have never looked at it that
[1:22:49] way
[1:22:55] i kind of look at the word of the lord
[1:22:57] jesus
[1:22:59] he said hell was created for the devil
[1:23:02] and his angels
[1:23:04] i never looked at it that way before
[1:23:08] that instructed me really deep i said
[1:23:09] what am i reading
[1:23:11] hell is created for the devil and his
[1:23:14] angels i said a process said
[1:23:17] why have i not seen this all my life
[1:23:20] sister kelly why have i not seen this
[1:23:23] is it the devil and his angels that's
[1:23:26] the people god created helpful
[1:23:29] god does not make mistakes
[1:23:34] in the politics of america
[1:23:36] you could be voting for a democrat a
[1:23:38] republican ticket can fall in there but
[1:23:40] when god created hell he created it for
[1:23:43] the devil and his angel
[1:23:45] nothing more we fall in there
[1:23:48] that's the word of the lord jesus
[1:23:50] himself
[1:23:51] and i was telling his brother i said it
[1:23:53] kind of sounds strange to him like oh
[1:23:55] bruh if you want to bring a new tissue
[1:23:56] no this is your bible i said that's the
[1:23:58] lord jesus that said it before we're
[1:23:59] going to walk with the brain we say
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] it's a norm of it's not bountiful
[1:24:07] not of god's children we enter there he
[1:24:10] said it was created for the devil and
[1:24:12] his children and i asked his brother i
[1:24:14] said brother when anything asset of the
[1:24:17] devil's children enter ahead he was kind
[1:24:19] of stumped he said
[1:24:21] i say it's not the trickiest question
[1:24:22] it's just as simple as i said there's no
[1:24:24] trick it is because maybe you think that
[1:24:26] there's this there's a bigger bigger
[1:24:28] fish to fry me i know there's nothing
[1:24:30] behind it's just as simple as i'm saying
[1:24:32] i said is there any other person that
[1:24:34] would be in hell beside the devil and
[1:24:36] his children he said uh i said but i
[1:24:38] don't don't stop it it's a simple
[1:24:40] question
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:43] would there be any other person in
[1:24:45] health beside the devil and his children
[1:24:47] i said brother let me just help you the
[1:24:49] answer is no
[1:24:52] i said now let me not tell you where we
[1:24:54] where we should ask a question who's
[1:24:55] tired are you
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:02] when you answer that question of what
[1:25:05] side you are then you are no more
[1:25:06] worried about hell anymore
[1:25:08] that's not the story we're talking about
[1:25:10] and that's why god sent a prophet to
[1:25:13] show you who you are
[1:25:16] and then when you can see who you are
[1:25:18] and you can know your father then you
[1:25:20] know where you're going to you are not
[1:25:22] going there because you are good you are
[1:25:24] not going there because you can pray you
[1:25:26] are not going there because you pay your
[1:25:27] tax you must pay your title for a
[1:25:29] christian you must be interested very
[1:25:30] christian you must be praying for your
[1:25:32] blessing but that is not all of it
[1:25:35] is because you know who you are
[1:25:39] quickening power did that
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:47] god sent onto us
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] power against all unclean spirits
[1:25:58] to be against them
[1:26:01] to be over them
[1:26:05] and to cast them out
[1:26:08] to cast them out
[1:26:11] he didn't say to call by the brown to
[1:26:13] help you out no to cast them out
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:17] but abraham has done his job
[1:26:19] he has left a message and he said put it
[1:26:21] on tapes there's a reason for that
[1:26:24] because somebody could come and tell you
[1:26:25] something different
[1:26:27] but now you can listen to those tapes
[1:26:29] and you are seeing yourself clearly you
[1:26:30] are not saying for the brown you already
[1:26:32] believe he's a prophet so you're not
[1:26:33] seeing him again he said that part is
[1:26:35] history for you but now you are not
[1:26:37] seeing yourself through the eye of the
[1:26:39] prophet god sends to you
[1:26:42] and you can look at the bible you can
[1:26:44] see yourself in every story
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:50] now we are not reading the bible like
[1:26:52] like we read in pentecost i said
[1:26:54] something somebody was shocked i said
[1:26:55] when you read about judas you will see
[1:26:57] yourself there
[1:26:59] see brussels and you're going too far no
[1:27:01] you will see yourself in judas and you
[1:27:02] see what messi did for you
[1:27:05] what did you guys do he saw christ is
[1:27:07] that what he did how many times have you
[1:27:09] sowed christ
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:14] we are talking about now we are on the
[1:27:15] altar now we are not actors how many
[1:27:18] times have you sold christ
[1:27:22] when you read the bible and you read
[1:27:23] about account you see yourself in anchor
[1:27:26] but the only thing you see you see what
[1:27:28] mercy did for you so when you're reading
[1:27:30] the story of ekka you say mercy
[1:27:33] you say mercy
[1:27:35] when you restore your
[1:27:36] beloved you say oh lord mercy
[1:27:40] another quote from the brahman said i
[1:27:42] committed the same crime but i'm
[1:27:43] committed that's what abram said yes
[1:27:46] many times god told me to do this i did
[1:27:48] my own thing that's what i said
[1:27:52] so you see when you see yourself in
[1:27:54] every positive and negative story in the
[1:27:56] bible you will see yourself in every
[1:27:58] story
[1:27:59] some of those stories will humble you
[1:28:01] someone will lift you up so we knock you
[1:28:03] to the ground i crumble your boats
[1:28:06] and your big me
[1:28:08] we go down solo meeting like a candle
[1:28:10] wasp
[1:28:12] and i say oh lord
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] the lie to god how many times have you
[1:28:17] lied in the church and yeah you are not
[1:28:19] singing i
[1:28:21] love him
[1:28:23] they didn't have a second privilege to
[1:28:24] sing i love him
[1:28:26] peter said they're going to pack your
[1:28:27] dead body
[1:28:28] where you are
[1:28:30] you're saying i love him
[1:28:32] so as you read every page in the bible
[1:28:36] some parents will lift you up
[1:28:38] so we humble your pride
[1:28:40] so we lift you up again your pride will
[1:28:42] be humble so you are going to journey up
[1:28:45] and down up and down what is happening
[1:28:48] god is more than you he's pounding you
[1:28:51] sending you through the fiery corners
[1:28:57] so now all your acting
[1:28:59] begin to fade away
[1:29:01] the real beginning to come out
[1:29:04] and when you step into that door
[1:29:06] you come into the ass of god you're not
[1:29:08] looking at blasting stephen's face
[1:29:09] you're not looking at your wife's face
[1:29:11] you are coming right here boom
[1:29:13] you say god
[1:29:15] i just look lostfully at this woman
[1:29:17] today
[1:29:18] you're talking to god you're not talking
[1:29:20] to somebody you are talking to god
[1:29:23] you're having a conversation with your
[1:29:25] king
[1:29:30] you say lord i don't feel like coming to
[1:29:31] church today
[1:29:32] but i begin to lose desire to be among
[1:29:35] your children they begin to irritate me
[1:29:37] you bring it right here
[1:29:40] one of the oldest sacrifice in the bible
[1:29:42] is the point of offering
[1:29:44] and that's where the church has failed
[1:29:48] oh but i want to pay my attention so
[1:29:50] what
[1:29:52] we're failing about suffering
[1:29:54] because a burnt offering is the only
[1:29:56] offering that comes in contact with fire
[1:29:59] sister naomi fire has to come in contact
[1:30:01] with it
[1:30:03] we put a delight there for it we put all
[1:30:05] can offerings we give him afraid of
[1:30:07] praise we're giving off not this and
[1:30:09] nothing of that but the burnt offering
[1:30:11] we fell in the boundary
[1:30:14] when we are coming to the church
[1:30:16] maybe the devil is telling you kill
[1:30:18] yourself kill yourself kill yourself and
[1:30:20] you keep that spirit outside when you
[1:30:21] are coming in so you can pack it home
[1:30:24] successfully
[1:30:26] but you know what you need to do
[1:30:28] god wants you to come with your blunt
[1:30:30] offering
[1:30:31] just as i am come with your loss
[1:30:35] come with your pride come with your
[1:30:38] arrogance bring them to the altar
[1:30:40] because the fire of god has to leak on
[1:30:43] that sacrifice
[1:30:45] the fire of god to lick on your pride it
[1:30:48] had to leak on all those devils holding
[1:30:50] some clean spirit let us rise on this
[1:30:52] hour
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:31:11] oh
[1:31:22] hallelujah glory to god
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:34] oh
