haircut look for the change amen glory be to god amen amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord the lord bless you you may have your seat praise the lord amen amen i don't think i have to work on brother lord back he welcomed himself back home amen praise the lord [Applause] and you know you know that's the way every son behave it don't have to be a prodigal son every son when he gets back home praise the lord you are never stranger home amen you know what it is when you get back home brother you go right down to the kitchen you know you go to your favorite spot in it you know and you just you are home that's what home is praise the lord amen amen amen brothers let your stay right after the service for the short meeting and we have just few things that we want to catch up with right after the service now now there were uh there are few brothers that have been helping us in the in the usher to be ushering with everything that we have going on we needed some help for the deacons so we have a brother dan for many of us that know brother dan he's uh he's been around yet as us right from being an usher helping in ministering in different things so i mean whenever we can get the deacons and we need somebody to come in we always try to get a hold of brother dan praise the lord so but then i've been helping to usher we just try to get a few brothers to help him and uh brother uh johnny but johnny uh you know he came to me some time ago a long time ago and said brother juan is there anything i can do is there anything that you want to be done that i can do and uh you know you you have seen brother johnny up here leading sons and uh you know he having his favorite song flat away his hands is up ready to fly praise the lord so he's helping out there also brother brother stephen wolves and then brother joseph they come in do the setup back there and out of there because it was just too much thing for one person to do amen uh but jordan has been multi-taxing so we just needed these extra hands to come in and a few of other things we will talk about when we meet as brothers but we just wanted to mention these brothers to you now let me see this is uh for the need that we are having these brothers are appointed to help us in this area and that is completely different from people that have voted into office because you know every every church has has its bad laws it has its uh rule of ordinance so uh i know pretty soon it's so it's so quick for people to start trying to look in there and see whether there are some qualifications that are made keep your qualification in your pocket for now until this kovac is over amen praise the lord we need the help of these brothers and we're going to make use of them for now so uh uh uh uh you know uh the uh sometimes some of these things we pray that the lord will give us grace that we'll be able to talk about them and and be able to place them you know rightly into their place because most of the time i've seen churches running right into crisis because uh sometimes these things are not understood among the people you know you have people that god has given gifts in ministry to the church but is also different when people are voted into office you know when the church votes certain people into office the church empowered him praise the lord amen that is the reason why when we moved down here to this local assembly even though i was a preacher for as long as being preaching but i was never voted by this church into office even though i force myself to be a deacon praise the lord because you know every time the door will sound back there i want to see who's coming in amen praise the lord i think i could take the heat so i would step back there and talk a little bit and brother john got so used to it that's not he had a door sign he would tell me go back praise the lord amen you know so uh uh uh but uh until until you know it got to the place where the church fell uh you know fell fake that we could save them then you know we were voted into office and then we could play the role fully play the role but until then you know just like i said these brothers will be out there to help us before the service and we also want them to help us after the service if you are leaving after the service you want to back up we have a lot of kids running through the parking lot you know just get one of these brothers and and have them help you to safely back up and and drive home praise the lord amen let's turn to our feeling and uh we just sing a chorus here and then we go right into the word of the lord praise the lord but lord it's good to have you back home buddy amen amen when you start crying then you make me cry amen you know he saw he's a he's a brother he's a son to me amen we are very good friends very very good friends amen praise the lord what a wonderful wonderful thing i hope you followed the the message we played this morning for sunday school paradox and uh brother lord pick up something from from there while he were praying and i played that message because there is something in there i want us to look at so we'll be talking a little bit about god's family tree this morning so i just pray that the lord will be able to help us i'm feeling a little bit of a weakness in my body so pray for me while we we all fellowship around the word of god word of god ever truth let's sing there changing me changing you amen word of god ever truth word of god [Music] ever truth changing me [Music] changing you we have [Music] let's sing that one more time yeah word of god oh ever true [Music] changing me [Music] high [Music] long present for our in this world [Music] there [Music] word of life [Music] in this world where we [Music] word of god or word of god changing me [Music] changing praise the lord let's pray together heavenly father lord you are the word you are the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god father we come this morning we come just as we are precious lord father and lord we can see the word we can see the impact of the world and that's what we want to be identified with that's what we want to talk about this

you father in your wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians sorry i was very flat on that song amen i'm always flat praised amen glory be to god amen let's take our bibles this morning we're going to be running very very fast kind of a marathon this morning to be able to keep up with our times in john chapter 1. it's in john chapter one we're gonna go right in there and start our reading with saint john chapter 1 praise the lord in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god praise the lord are we together in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god i would want to say this before i continue reading this word is not about god this word that we are reading is not about god the word is god praise the lord the word is god i mean we can argue about it and says men were inspired and we can we can i mean we can use our mind to run about it but if you if you look at the details of the word if you look at the acts that is in the word if you look at the accuracy of the word men can never put this book together what you are holding in your hands what you are reading is god that's that's the greatness of our god he can be so humble so simple that we can handle him in our hands just as humble as he was that he could spit in his face that could nail him to a tree praise the lord amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made praise the lord let's drop down a little bit verse 11 he came unto his own in his own receive him net but as many as receive him to them give he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name amen now there is something that i want for you to to to take note of as many as receive him he gave them power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name keep that belief on his name in your mind as we stated together this morning which were now born not of blood none of the weight of the flesh none of the word of man but of god amen so these ones that receive him these ones that believe on his name were born of god praise the lord the lord bless you have your seat keep your bible handy let's go to first period chapter three verse first peter chapter one sorry first peter chapter 1 verse 23. amen now we are talking about these ones we'll receive him these ones who believe on his name peter describe it here also born of god the ones that are born of god being born again net of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and the barrett forever praise the lord so peter year is letting us know that uh they are ones that are now born of corruptible seed let us say this way the children of god the new birth that we call born again the new birth it is not of corruptable seed is of is it's a seed incorruptible now take note of that word seed because we're going to be talking about plants here a little bit amen now let's take another scripture that would be as chapter 17 as chapter 17. let's take a seventeen and we will read there uh 17 verse 22 at 17 let's read verse 22. this was paul then paused two in the midst of mars held and said yeah men of alton i perceive that in all things they are two superstitions if there is ever a time where the word is caught in that same place is this time amen i mean because of all the superstitions that is happening there's that that is what is all behind all of our uh our our theories most of our theories let me say that way for us i passed by i beheld your devotion and phone an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worshipped him declare unto you god that made the word and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwarf net in temple made with hands neither is worshiped with man's hands as though he he needed anything seeing he gave it all life and breath and all things and have made of one blood all nations of men fall to dwarf on all the face of the earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation praise the lord that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him dull he be not far from every one of us amen is that not a good thing to know that he's here with us amen he's not found he's just a prayer away amen for in him we live we move and have our being a certain also of your own part have said for we are also his offspring amen that would be one of the words we will be dealing with too as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone or gravy by arts and man device a man amen let's stop right there let's stop right there we are his offspring amen praise the lord we are his offspring now this this subject caught my attention uh uh by reading the book of isaiah the book of isaiah had this subject to catch my attention and and and the way that it caught my attention if if if we want to quickly look at isaiah chapter 4 verse 2 i will just cope these scriptures and i will go quickly in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of israel the branch of the lord isaiah used that language the branch of the lord amen and in in uh chapter 11 he used the same word the branch of the lord jeremiah came he started using that very same word the branch of the lord now it kind of cut my my attention most especially from isaiah chapter 11 verse 1 the scripture says and there shall come forth a road out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his root now so looking at branch looking at a root and all of that it got to my mind that i mean god is the first one that started this whole family tree business amen he's the whole he's the first one that started this whole family tree and i believe that is what the apostle paul was pointing to when he said we are all his offspring of one blood of one blood god make all men upon the face of the earth praise the lord so we want to talk about god's family tree i say this way god's family tree and uh just because over and over the scripture uses this language the branch of the lord uh there as i said the branch of the lord will be beautiful in john chapter 15 jesus said i am the vine and you are the branches praise the lord now in the old testament they saw him as the branch but when he came in the new testament he made you the branches and he says i am divine are we together now so over and over we see we see this language uh let's look in revelation chapter 22 revelation chapter 22 as the as the bible closest as the bible closes the last chapter almost the last verse the bible says verse 16. the ones the one who this book is all about because the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ amen the one that this book is all about the one that the entire bible is all about because he is the principal team of the bible as he closed the bible this is the way he close it he says i jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david the bride and the morningstar in another word to say everything of this book sprung out of me amen everything of this book sprung out of him praise the lord amen so you look over and over you see the uh you know the scripture uh uh speaks about that maybe that would give you some uh home bible studies to do to go and look for everywhere where the bible talks about branches that would be a good bible studies for you amen because i'm having lists of scriptures here but it will take us all of the time to be able to go through it i want to grab your attention by pointing those things out to you that uh god is the beginning of the family tree praise the lord are we together amen i would take uh something from a testimony upon the seed and uh uh shared with you this morning i never believed that any man was to be a slave god made man a man made slave nobody to be a slave under the other we are all brothers we come from one great family tree praise the lord we come from one great family tree adam and eve in a garden of eden now spiritually we are born of god that changes our character we are all from one great family tree amen praise the lord amen now but what what what what made us uh different in our characters what make us different even in our complexion paul mentioned that in uh in acts chapter 17 if you never pick that up while we were reading it maybe let's look at that a little bit as chapter 17. he mentioned that a little bit i mean he just he just skipped over it but uh you know you can you can hide anything from the ego eyes amen praise the lord because we've been taught to read between the lines verse 26 and have made of one blood all nations of men fall to the word on all the face of the earth water europe america and africa uh ensure all the face of the earth and have determined by times before appointed and the bounds their habitation amen the balance of their habitation looking at that word the bounce of their habitation our complexion can also fit into that our heights can fit into that amen some are tall some are short amen praise the lord but of one blood god hath made all men to fill the face of the earth praise the lord amen but more than that we will also uh appreciate that uh there are other things that contribute to us being different some talk quietly some loud and uh some are fast some are slow and uh and and all of these different things they are they are things that contributed to it and and those are some of the things that we want to look at and you know the reason why this is important because if you are a child of god if you are a son or a daughter of god you have to know that your birth is by an incorruptible seed amen is by an incorruptible seed that cannot be corrupted praise the lord it cannot be corrupted oh i feel like speaking in tongues this morning praise the lord when david said when david said in the psalm chapter 16 when he said uh uh your holy one will not see corruption it was about all of god's children it was that it was that incorruptible seed it can never be corrupted sickness cannot corrupt it death cannot corrupt it amen there is there is nothing from from the family bloodline that can corrupt that sea because it's incorruptible are we together and that incorruptible seed is your true identity praise the lord is your true identification but we've been trapped in this body amen we we have been trapped in this body i was looking at that this morning and uh i pulled that out and trying to to uh to build my case here amen i have to build my case speak to this jury gotta bear my case glory to god i gotta convince you that you are off an incorruptible seed i'm speaking to this jury i gotta build my case and convince you that this world is not your home praise the lord your birth is not a flesh and blood amen gathering i gotta encourage you build my kids so i was building my case i pulled something up here about cells the cells of your body it says cells are the basic building blocks of all human of all living things the basic building blocks you see the reason why it's hard for you to really know yourself building blocks are all keeping you behind you are behind building blocks the human body is composed of trillions of cells but the incorruptible seed is behind those trillions of cells trillions of sales when they just put you behind one cell you are crying trillions of cells praise the lord they provide structure for the body they take in nutrition from food and all of that the more you eat they take out your cell age amen they take all your iron by that is keeping you behind say i'm building my case this morning i'm speaking to this jury amen are we together so this human body is a prison you are walking around with your own prison are you ready this morning you are carrying your own prison praise the lord you are present in that body you see that is the reason why notorious criminal when they place them in prison i mean they have lived in prison so long they have made praise in life their life praise the lord they have got so used to the atmosphere in prison that when they set them free they are not able to keep up with the with the environment of a big world they are so used to confinement they have to commit crime to go back in prison again because that's what they are used to praise the lord that's what they are used to and we get so used to this prison house that the world comes to set us free praise the lord and then sometimes we get angry with the preacher what is he talking what he knows why why do you want to tell me and so you is because we get so used to this prison house are we together praise the lord it's not a nice way to start a message by calling you prisoners but i told you i'm building my case glory to god amen praise the lord are we together so that incorruptible seed that incorruptable seed has been sowed into this earth being sown into this earth this body now that was the reason why we play the message paradox because your life is a paradox amen your life is a paradox it's incredible but it's this truth that's what a paradise is a paradise is something that is incredible but yet it's truth and that's what your life is guess what this new verb that's what this holy ghost is all about oh i'm a little bit over my head this morning praise the lord i'm a little bit over my head this morning but i just i just have to hold myself praise the lord i just have to hold myself amen let's talk about this paradise 1963 that was the message you were listening to this morning he said i believe that every born again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themself i mean what makes you a paradise is because the incorruptible seed of god is in you but it's praising in trillions of cells is trying to express itself out amen you ever heard or read about prison breaks you ever heard of i read about notorious prisoners they have been able to convince the prison guide while they are in prison that's what the incorruptible sea is doing to you it's convincing yourself and slowly yourself is believing that see that is inside it's incredible but it's truth praise the lord hallelujah because something happened to you that change your whole being and anyone could look at that and knows what a paradise is is a miracle the greatest miracle you will ever have is the one that is happening inside of you that's the greatest miracle you will ever have is the one that is happening inside of you amen amen praise the lord amen have you ever slapped yourself before because you felt foolish oh i do that all the time i do that all the time i was listening to to a message one time i was i was actually driving and i just i felt overwhelmed because i saw it oh i just i just slapped myself in the face say wake up that's the reality praise the lord amen this is not just church membership this is not becoming part of a group no that is the reason why i want to talk about the word this morning the word of god the power that it has and what it is unless unless that happens you cannot be a christian unless you know uh uh uh there must be a paradise for you to become a christian something has to change that you cannot explain it's not because you identify yourself with a church something have to change that you cannot explain something happened to you that you cannot put in words [Music] you cannot put in words and when you start to talk about it you feel the chills you cry because something happened to you because no one can change the spirit of a man amen and gave him a new birth that was the reason why it blown naked dumas mind when jesus talked about being born again he said what do you mean go back in my mother's womb because that is the only form of birth that we know but god have many form of birth there is your natural birth there is a spiritual birth and there is a constant birthing [Laughter] amen amen every time god brings you into a new experience it's a birth for god for you to grow in god you have to be born born again every day you have to be born as you go along the way oh this thing is becoming so guilty outside of god god alone is the only one can do it it is a miracle how god can make a man's thinking his way his life and everything change it from what it was how god can make a man a man mind poor with that anger i would kill these christians and god will meet that man on the road of damascus and affect him change his mind around the very thing that he wanted to crucify he says i will die for this wife nothing woman i will die for this i took a life for it i will give my life for it only god this is far beyond gut trains this is far beyond what we think our belief system is is far beyond that i'm talking about almighty god coming down and taking anger from your heart almighty god coming down and taking lust out of you taking the desire of sin and and and and things that are that are contra that's what i'm talking about that is the paradox only god can do it no church can do it amen praise the lord no church can do it no preacher can do it it has to be almighty god our responsibility is to put you in the presence of god is to expose you to the word of god expose you to the presence of god and let that present affect your life and change your nature only god can do it how we together only god only god can do it that's the reason why no matter what you are struggling with no matter what the devil tried to to spit in your face with or push it on you and and and you have to allow your god become greater than your problems you have to allow your god in your mind god i know you are greater than this i know you are bigger than this the only way your problem can wear you down is because you have made your problem bigger than your god that's the only reason why they would drag you down that's the only reason why it will enslave you whether it is sin whether it is habit is because you have made that problem bigger than god are we together only god praise the lord what are we talking about this morning we are talking about the family tree why god uses all of this word branch stem roots offspring jesus said ah jesus testified unto you by my angels i'm the root in the offspring of david amen revelation chapter five no man could open a book the one that was water was the was was the root of devin why god uses all of these words it's because god deal with us just like how he deals with the earth that's why man was made out of the earth he deals with us just like how he did with the earth amen he deals with us everything starts from a seed no matter how tall we are and how much weight we have amen we started from a seed that was planted in our mother's womb so god always thought god believed in the seed principle because the principle of seed is the ability of that plant is in the seed that is the principle of seed i mean you see this big drive wall that is standing right by the side of this church it could fall down down and smash this whole building in but it started from a seed praise the lord it started from a seed that's the reason why god would tell us you are born by the incorruptable seed your spiritual birth your new birth the thing that god is doing in you don't have anything to do with church membership they don't have anything to do with what kind of organization you begin you belong to what they have to do with is the seed of god it's the seed that was planted amen that's where it begins is the seed god believe in sea principle and every tree starts with a seed that was put into the ground are we together amen are you here with me this morning glory be to god glory be to god amen let me share something with you ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 9 let's look at that together are we together everything starts with a seed starts with a seed are we together that is the reason why when you want to believe god when you when when you want to have you when you want to want to have faith it just it is not just in the blues and this is why i believe god no you got to stop with the sea you got to stop planting that seed god said it you got to find where god said it in his word and you can take that promise of god as a seed and hold it in your heart and say god you say by your strife i'm healed and you put that seed planted in this body this body will obey your confession praise the lord oh man let's look at ecclesiastes chapter 7 the last verse solomon said something there verse 29. if this would make sense to you i mean when we read this then the quote i would read would make more sense to you law he said this owner have found that god have made men upright but they have sought out many inventions amen that god has made man upright praise the lord now that word upright commands there are a lot of lot of meanings for it equal means straight upright correct right level pleasing uprightness righteousness that which is upright so because we are made by a holy god we can take the concept that god made us to be truthful amen he made us to live right we can take that concept and apply it to god made men to be upright but there is another concept also when we deal with family tree there is another concept that i want for us to look at this morning i share that with you some time ago but uh this will bring it into the picture let's look at this on on genesis question and answer on genesis and you and you will appreciate this you see because if you if you think about the c principle many of the times like i said year uh uh uh uh i i've always thought about it god making men out of the dust of the earth i've always thought that god you know what four men just like uh you know on a clay just made a clay on the ground and and everything like that you know that's that's the way i've always imagined because the bible said he made man and then he breathed into his nostril and man became a living soul so you always think about that sippy arrasty amen you think god was playing cpr that's what you would think but follow me in here a little bit now with this uh you will appreciate it as we back it up from the word of god a little bit question answered in genesis he formed man out of the dust of the earth are we together amen he formed man out of the dust of the earth and put this supernatural spirit i can see adam standing let's let's take this way see him standing like a tree god had made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots stick in the ground so if you think about the sea principle adam was not made flat adam was made upright if you think about the seed principle he was now made flat now you remember when jesus opened that blind man eyes what did he say i see men like trees that's what he said and here he said solomon telling us that god made man upright he made man upright he made man to stand oh glory be to god i had a little shout in faith this morning when i was studying praise the lord you will realize that that in child growth when a child is born sweet innocent baby they will just wreck that baby all over everybody want to grab the baby and everything pretty soon they all type glory be to god amen but there is one stage of the child that is that that captured the attention the first time the child stands the first time a child stands it captured the attention why because man was made up right the first time that baby will stand and try to take step everyone watch watch [Music] praise the lord because i just saw you standing on the word yours now glory to god because man was made upright i mean look in ephesians chapter 6 what paul said the three times the apostle paul when he was talking about putting on the armor of god three times he used the word stain because that was the way you were made to stand not to lay down and cry and food around you must be able to stand to the devil life [Music] [Applause] stand up as the son of god stand up as a daughter of god standing on the promises because you were made up right praise the lord for a long time we have we have bowed down to christ and darkness praise the lord we don't even care to see whether it was in the bible or not we just believe it because we said that's our denomination you know that's my father church my grandfather used to go to that church and all of them right we were just bowing down to idolatry now the new birth has come so you can stand paul said after you have done all of these things stand stand there for oh my goodness praise the lord man glory be to god hallelujah that's the reason why no matter what is happening to a child of god when god sees his son standing amen he might even be standing in the wrong god just love to see you standing that's what conviction is your conviction is your stance amen i know we all like to be part on the back we all like to have friends but god love a man that can stand on the word of god because a man was made upright he was never made lying down on the ground god was not performing cpr on you amen he was not performing cpr on adam he made man right from the ground up and when and when that image stood up he breathed into man and man became a living soul glory be to god glory be to god amen i feel like i can go through this war amen i don't know if the war will close on that but my goodness we're not living in a time where we have to bow down to to sin and sickness and the devil lies just to know that you were made by almighty god stand up for what you know this truth and what you know this right praise the lord man was made upright young people stand to stand on the promises of god staying as a son of god and paul says don't let no man to despise your youth because you know the word of god you know the promises you know what you want from god you're supposed to know what you want as a church amen you're supposed to know what you want as a church what you want from yourself as a as a daughter of god as a son of god what you want from yourself and stand for it glory be to god amen amen man was made upright that's how the family tree starts amen that's how the family tree starts when that tree starts growing and laying down it's a problem it has to start coming up because it's going to provide shade it's going to provide realm when men can run for comfort and rest are we together god had to made him he was dead as could be his toes like root sticks in the ground and god said let there be or breathe the breath of life into him and he jumped but abraham said he jumped his toes kicked out of the earth and he starts to step my goodness coronavirus restriction is stopping me from running down this eye every time i want to go i have to remember i have to remember now to come spit on you amen oh we are home folks hey man praise the lord amen now i was thinking about that when lord started singing knocking timber in i says my goodness i hope he will see the i hope he will see the signs stay right here because pretty soon he would tell everybody get off the road let's go i was just there i said oh my god lord help us this morning [Music] oh my goodness man praise the lord ephesians chapter six let's just read that a little bit yeah i have a little more to cover you okay i see i have a few minutes so amen amen amen are we together are you are you grabbing what we are talking about this morning amen we talking about that family tree amen it begins with a seed incorruptible which is god himself and when god make you your representation in adam was for you to stand the reason why we are born with our head we came down with our hair is because of the fall if not every son of god was going to be towards we're going to come just like adam we were going to come to this world standing to our feet glory be to god amen but jesus went down and he lifted us up he said stand up my children you were made to stand in the beginning praise the lord my goodness [Music] verse 10 he said finally brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his mind put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the walls of the devil amen we come to this world about our natural birth we are born defeated but when the new birth comes amen when you are born again you are born just like adam in the beginning you're born standing on the word of god you are not born again uh uh like like some baby that that we have to carry you born standing on the word of god even though you are a baby fair with the milk sincere milk of god's word but you're born standing on the word of god amen that's the that's your first thing on the word of god praise the lord amen you know when it's your second stain oh my goodness where do we go about the grave oh we go by the rapture we are not leaving from yet defeated praise the lord oh you might uh i died in whatever way and we prayed in and lay you there but let me tell you my goodness me that incorruptable seed david said they will not see corruption that's why paul said if this effort tabernacle be dissolved there is another one waiting for us because whatever happened if this body drop you don't see corruption in the twinkling of an eye you step into the new body and when you step into the new body you are standing that is your second stand glory be to god oh my and then when we get over to internet we will not be crying around like denominational babies we will be standing like sons and daughters of god that is the reason why behind the curtains there is nothing like a prophet there is nothing like a brother i mean nothing like a pastor there is nothing brother branham said behind there they said my precious brother they didn't say our prophet there is nothing like pastor dave there is nothing like father there is just one father that's the heavenly father [Music] because when we get over in eternity we're not coming 12 year or four year or we will all be the same end and we will be stealing like children of god you were mental stan don't complain about school and complain about this complaining about peer pressure stand you are made to stand you are able you have the steady material in you glory be to god amen my goodness what are we talking about talking about standing that's what we're talking about amen not complaining and uh uh uh you know uh just just complaining fascinating you know and this one said and this one said you are made to stand criticism gossip you are made to stain it what people say you are made to steal it it's in you to sing it so why are you complaining they once said there but i mean the other one said here about me glory be to god lord brother you really never did the right thing because i'm not going to stop now i was trying to manage the water but he brought another one so i'm going on praise the lord [Applause] glory be to god amen praise the lord see when god made you it was not your hair that was in the moth it was your feet that was in the mud right it was not your head in the mud so don't let the devil put your head in the mouth amen praise the lord it was the devil head that was in the mud because he licked the dust the bible said the dust he will eat so you have to be standing on his head that's what i'm telling you young people i feel like just crossing this note and all i can say this morning is stan stay like a son of god don't lie some weak and lustful demon just control your life [Music] amen you were made up right god make you upright he make you to stan praise the lord oh i know the devil is not going to be happy amen but you see you cannot dance sitting your best dancer sit you find people the music playing if you really get the move stand up [Music] glory be to god and we're telling the devil we get the move that's why we are standing because we have the moves praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah oh satan we get the move let me just get you on few things here and then we go powder powder of gold powder transformation listening to this brother branham said listen there is one thing i can do he says i can't brag on my ancestors no i come through an awful mess when i read this thing i asked myself why do i want to be a branham it's an awful mess oh yeah why do i want to be a branham i'm not a branamite i'm a son of god amen i can brag on my ancestors he said it's an awful mess my father was an irishman my mother was was an indian half indian her mother was an indian draw on pension he says now all of them drunks most all of them die with their shoes on fighting gunfighting and so forth i can brag on nothing about that because my ancestors and my family tree is terrible and i can say that same thing of my family tree is terrible praise the lord amen i can say the same thing of my family tree is up to you to sit off yours i don't want to offend you this morning i'm talking about mine and brother branham say about his so i can i can stand right behind this prophet and say the brown and family tree was an awful mess but yet god could raise up a prophet out of that family tree praise the lord god could bring us the word the opening of the seal out of that family tree why should we settle down for the family when we can take the word and become like christ glory be to god amen maybe i might get in trouble for this but i can stand it i was made to stand that's right oh my goodness this boarding it has been roasted it has been boiled it has been fried glory be to god amen they back it also amen he said but brother there is one thing i can break on i can break oh my lord jesus who has redeemed me and with his transforming power planted a seed by predestination and i sought it and that's what i want you to do this morning i want you to see it i want you to see that there is a seed incorruptible that is that is that seed that makes you miserable when you do things that you're not supposed to do that see makes you so uncomfortable you don't know if you want to vomit or go to the bathroom it just makes you so uncomfortable you go and push up left you stay uncomfortable you go and eat you stay uncomfortable is the sea incorruptible whenever you step out of the word of god it makes you uncomfortable i'm thankful to god because i saw it i saw there was a seed planted in me why am i different why are these things happening to me from a family that never went to church all he knew was just his mother was a catholic father never went to church he was drinking and i mean always in trouble and with his transforming power plant at the sea and by predestination and i saw it whose son i am now not charles branham but a son of god and that's what i want you to see that predestinated seed it changed your identity it gives you a birth it gives you a name change that's the next thing that comes after a birth you have to name the child they give you a birth and they give you a name change my goodness yeah i can break on him i have spent 33 years of my life bragging on him and if he will spare me another 33 years i can breathe more on him see i can't brag on my ancestors hallelujah he there redeemed me and planted the sea of life in here and let me look down upon this word sent down his spirit and said here is it speak this and it happened if you don't appreciate what the grace of god is doing in your life changing your habits judging you drawing you close to god you think life is just all about all of these flashy perishable things that is the reason why we don't have fullness of joy is because we have put joy in perishable things we have put joy in perishable things it has to be money house cars but we still have them and we're not happy because they are not substance of joy i mean they are not substance of jaw they are job pacifiers you just suck on it a little bit and before you realize you want another one praise the lord oh my goodness glory be to god are we together this morning oh i believe it i believe it oh my i can break on him how he how he did do that through the watching of the water by the word the water the separation watch which we could explain it true predestinated believers will stay with the world because they are part of the word no matter what happened we will stay with the word and let me tell you that that that incorruptible seed is not your choice you don't choose it amen is the husband man that plant ate that's right and if he had planted it in you you better obey to bring fruit or as you will never be happy god is not going to change his mind [Music] because you are stubborn amen you will just make life more uncomfortable for yourself until you submit it's not your choice believing god is not your choice accepting salvation is not your choice he was the one that choose you are we together now let's take another one here then we can be able to find a place to close here now he says and now there is many things i'm talking about my natural birth there is many things in my natural birth that i can't break on i tell you i ain't got nothing to brag on my mother was a sinner amen praise the lord to begin with my father was a sinner it takes an earnest person to come out and see this every every one of us try to to build some kind of a proud image of our family you know why we do it it's because we loved him we identify with them but when it comes to truth confronting god's word praise the lord when it comes to truth they come out of a bunch of uh cut throats and gunfighters and and most of them die with their boots on drunk bootleggers and and everything else out of kentucky my mother have indian i've got nothing to break on i can break on my family tree i can brag on my family tree like i say i don't know about yours glory be to god amen are we together amen i will tell you something also it might blow your mind but jesus of nazareth you see that is the reason why when john introduced jesus when he talks about the genealogy of jesus he never did like matthew matthew went back adam he went to david he went all the way down and abraham he you know much when abraham you know were the son of base and said he went macho went all through those things luke did the same thing talking about the genealogy of jesus christ but when it came to john honor that ego anointing amen when he talks in the beginning talking about the genealogy he traced it back to the beginning in the beginning was the word listen now and that word was with god and that word was god praise the lord now he's trying to help us to understand that the word that was god condescended and took on flesh are we together that word that was with god the word that is god took on flesh came among his own now owned it because they were jews his own hemorrhage his own he created him by the word they were all created came on his own and his own rejected him are we together now so you see the thing there is that the emphasis goes back to the word so listen to me carefully now because all the all the church word when they talk about jesus what they have in their mind is jesus of nazareth or in their mind when you talk about jesus i want to be like jesus the thing about that man in nazareth praise the lord but when you and myself talk about jesus is jesus the word of god for our day amen that's what god is bringing you to he wants you to be the word he wants you to be the son of god the daughter of god living out his word in this day no matter how you dress like jesus and nazar nobody going to believe you amen praise the lord i can't even try because i have to bless bleach my body i either have to grow my hair or wear wheat over my head so being like jesus is not that jesus of nazareth is jesus the word in your day being the word of god a son of god living out the word of god because the word is the sea incorruptible are we together let me take something here this will be my last two material that will use and then i will let you go life is the healer god promised he did visit to three or four generations the sin of the father upon the children amen that's what is written over in the book of deuteronomy in the old testament god did promise to visit the sin and not not only the sin but also the the blessings of the father now this is bringing us in a context that when god start watching over a seed he watched over that seed for four generations when god started watching over that seed so god interest in you was from the foundation of the world amen praise the lord when he start started looking on earth to watch out for your coming it was not in your father it was not in your grandfather amen beginning from your great-grandfather god started taking interest in you let's read this other one again you were watching see you hebrew chapter seven the bible said here that levi paid tithes when he was in the limbs of abraham four generations before he come on earth abraham isaac jacob levi was the fourth generation so when when abraham paid tithe to mechisity god saw that as an act of levi from the lambs of abraham that was when god took interest in levi for the priesthood amen are we together amen so he started watching watching out for your coming full generation whether your grandfather was a drunk or he was a smoke god saying down that bloodline it's coming my son amen whatever will happen to him let him give birth to the next generation that's not your great your your your uh uh uh grandfather was born god said okay the great grand can go now i'm watching that sea lion praise the lord when your father was born god said okay the grandfather can go now i'm watching that sea lion because down that blood strain is a vessel with a tiny sea like a button glory be to god glory be to god amen that's the reason why god don't get time for your race you don't get time for your age what he gets time for is that seed it's the seed are we together that's god's family tree all god children are his offspring they spring out for him and that is the reason why when they start to identify themselves in their day they can get so mad with the system they can get so mad with the churches they can get mad with all the lies that has been around them when the son of god or the daughter of god really start to identify themselves with the word of god they can say why i never knew this all of my life why because that seed is coming to manifestation so a lot of the things you have as habits attitudes and all of that they are yourself that the thing they are praising in you those things are not from you they are from your great grandfather grandfather your father is all of those things that give you the complexity that you have i mean it's what gave us the complexity we have the other they are the things that we inherit you see that's the reason why the new birth is very important broadband was talking in that tip this morning if you were listening about that boy amen he was a german can never apologize hide his hair high up but ram see if he stayed that way he can never make a husband to look to the wife what he needs is the new birth amen he call it the the the family strain the thing that runs down into your family that runs down into our family praise the lord now so if i mean if you if you if you love a man or love a you woman sometimes you know the people talk about this you know soulmate and soulmate they don't even really know what it is praise the lord amen they think so male 1 is is just a lustful companion oh glory be to god if you have been able to identify you don't have to be a husband or wife he can even be a pastor than a young man or a young woman identified that that is the seed of god no matter how they get caught up in india in in in in in their praising their carbon attitude you know that person have a test for god their ability to identify that helps you to overlook all their struggles but when a person does not have the first regard and respect for god that teach you to respect your parents then we know that we i mean we have a problem here you see that's the reason why peter said what baptism show us is a good conscience towards god so that's what we look for in the young people we don't look i don't want you to to come and cut me 20 bible verse because you can have the whole chapter on your own on your lips and you have no good conscience towards god no fear of god but when our little baby start having a conscience towards god then they are ready to go down to the water because even as we receive the holy ghost we still have the holy ghost in a complex body praise the lord amen we still have the holy ghost in praising [Laughter] glory be to god my goodness just like peter he went with the holy ghost in praise him john went with the holy ghost in prison you have your holy ghost in praising and your praising is yourself it's yourself now you see that is the reason why you don't play with the word of god young people we say this we say this we say this and brother good friend of mine we will talk all the time you know you just come here come together church and we meet and talk he said bro you talk about the word the word i don't know the word like you i mean you you've been you've been reading the word you always talk about the word you know you got to be in the word i come to church for you to teach me the word i said the word is jesus the word is what god is doing in your life amen the word is not just ignoring the the first book to the last book it's not just oh okay uh yeah must be born again yeah it's it's in john chapter three yes sin john chapter three you know no that's not the word that's not the word the word is a person the word is a man the word is christ the one to have closeness with you that's the word in the beginning was the word it was with god it was god that word came down and taken flesh that's god's family tree it started as a seed when god said let us make man in our image it was the spoken word seed that brought adam and when adam came forth he came up upright that was brother brahm teaching on statue of the peppermint that's what he was teaching on how we can grow in an image to be a living monument for god the lord don't the lie no backsliding devil you know the demons they are backsliders amen the ones used to have a good estimate backslidden from the promise of god so they know how to make you backslide praise the lord oh my goodness while the musicians come amen i feel like preaching though i feel like preaching though glory be to god god took his time he's been watching over you let's let's finish that a quote there on hebrew chapter seven the bible said that levi paid tithe when he was in the limbs of abraham four generations before he ever come to earth he was paying tithe to make chance today and bless him be the name of the lord then you that can believe in predestination before ordination and year four generation before levi whoever come out of the lands of abraham he paid tithe to make changes there which we had time to run this through the scripture you can run it through the scripture you can run it from genesis to revelation praise the lord you see that is the reason why the jews the jews that the favorite prayer of a jewish boy is the god of abraham isaac and jacob because they know that their ancestors came forth in the patriarch the 12th tribe are we together let's continue this he says if if you take it over like in jeremiah 1 4 god said i knew you before you were ever formed in your mother's womb before you were formed in your mother's womb i knew you when did he know you from the foundation of the word he hired you in his mind but as that time was coming close for you to be manifested he started taking interest in watching the sea lion from your great great grandfather that's the reason why nothing could have happened to your great grandfather until your grandfather was born and nothing could have happened to your to your grandfather until your father was born nothing could have happened to your father until you were born because god was taking interest in you before you were found in your mother's womb i have sanctified you and ordained you to be a prophet you love the lord this morning all this afternoon praise the lord amen are you angry with me oh amen let's set to eight outside amen glory be to god set to it outside oh my but i stand before this jury this morning to convince you that you never did it in the first place amen that it was not your fault amen it was not your fault [Music] it was all the cells that was running down your body that's why you were born in sin that's why you used to love the things you used to love it was not your fault you were trapped in this body but now that the word of god has come to call you forth is there somebody that can stand with me this morning let's stand on the promises of god let's stand on the word of god let's stand as the son of god i said god of god you don't have to hang

choices that we are making and the way we are dealing with things oh glory be to god glory be to god i'm feeling so good this morning amen i'm feeling so good because i make the devil so mad every

for you to stand as a son of god amen now that you know you are trapped in this body don't let this body hold you amen praise the lord don't let this body hold you [Music] amen you know we used to i
