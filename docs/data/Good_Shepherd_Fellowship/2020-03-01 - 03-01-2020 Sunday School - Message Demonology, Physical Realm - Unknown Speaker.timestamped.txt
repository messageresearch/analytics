[0:00] I have some lovely brother Bosworth
[0:02] Baxter Lindsay more always got 5m barons
[0:06] on others they're just very fine man but
[0:09] there's just something about when you
[0:11] get a group of man together one has one
[0:13] thing one has another sometimes that's
[0:15] conjuring or I think myself and so I
[0:17] feel like I'm just free now we can just
[0:20] have a big time mmm-hmm it's roll up our
[0:23] sleeves and you dive in and eat I think
[0:26] about rolling up your sleeves and having
[0:28] a a big time my first Bible was nature

[0:35] hundred feet hmm I love the peach and
[0:38] you like to be Sonny Boy if you like the
[0:41] feasts and love your mother you're gonna
[0:42] make a good boy and even my conversion
[0:46] didn't take it all out of me so one day
[0:48] I was up in the mountains of fishing
[0:49] away I said for the benefit of this
[0:50] little boy and I was finishing up there
[0:53] in the mountains and for the other
[0:54] little kiddies of course sitting around
[0:56] and how efficient route and oh it's
[0:59] wonderful the springtime I go along
[1:01] there cutting over the straps just in
[1:03] the next hole you like acting just
[1:05] praising the Lord and having a big time
[1:06] shot sometimes drop my line down
[1:09] I believe in shopping well I know
[1:13] something gets ahold of me it just does
[1:16] something to me so I've been going quite
[1:18] a little bit that morning and when I
[1:19] come back the strangest things a lot of
[1:22] bear in the country up there New
[1:23] Hampshire
[1:24] I have little camp but there were a
[1:26] seashell I had a little old tent setting
[1:28] up little pup tent I've been living in
[1:30] and a black bear is the most mischievous
[1:32] thing there is so an old mother bearing
[1:36] and a couple little cubbies that got in
[1:39] there
[1:40] and had they made have out of my tent
[1:42] now what do you think I ought to go to
[1:44] that bear little girl back house that
[1:46] red hair back there I want to go to
[1:48] actually I really shouldn't but here's
[1:50] what she done she come in she tore my
[1:52] pants down and she scattered everything
[1:54] out and eat up all my food I had there
[1:57] and she is just doing fine so when I
[1:59] come up away she went and she squealed
[2:02] to her cub and Wonderlic up run off with
[2:05] her the other one run he just set there

[2:12] enough in the hand but a little old hand
[2:13] acts have been shopping around some
[2:14] elders down there
[2:16] well sure no thought for is all I guess
[2:19] that telephone pole out there and she
[2:21] sat down she squealed on this a little
[2:24] bear he didn't pay attention to it he
[2:25] skipped it I thought what's that little
[2:28] fella doing I walked up a little kosher
[2:30] I'm afraid to get too close free she'd
[2:31] scratched me his look so good to see a
[2:34] tree and I know she could climb too so
[2:36] don't get too close to her called odd
[2:39] and all the nature of there
[2:40] so I went just a little bit closer and
[2:43] you know what happened I like pancakes I
[2:47] make you boys like pancakes oh boy old
[2:49] boys do I've seen them put their hand
[2:51] stuff we all like pancakes and I just
[2:53] love them and I like to pour honey on
[2:56] them being a bad dish you know that's
[2:58] what keeps us straightened out you know
[2:59] is the honey you know so and listen I
[3:03] don't sprinkle him a really bad time
[3:05] them I really pour it on works really
[3:07] good in the heavy
[3:07] I don't just Frank a little bit here and
[3:09] there I really poured on him get him all
[3:11] filled up with honey and then you know I
[3:13] had a bucket of honey up there that's a
[3:16] gallon bucket of honey and bears are
[3:18] very fond of honey so this little fella
[3:20] had got in there he got the lid off that
[3:22] bucket of honey and he was sitting there
[3:24] like this but this was a bucket of honey
[3:26] hungary's are my kids he comes up and
[3:28] you know how to eat it like you would
[3:29] know so he just saw his little paw down
[3:32] in and lick it like that and licking and
[3:35] he turned around to look to me and his
[3:37] little eyes was all matted together his
[3:39] little belly was just a sick as hiccup
[3:40] evil honey
[3:41] he was just setting a duck and he's
[3:42] handing out a look at honey like this is
[3:44] heart is aching legs
[3:45] oh my I thought about a good old time
[3:49] Holy Ghost meeting when we just kicked
[3:50] the bucket over sicker hand down a jar
[3:52] Nick away this key protocol just licking
[3:55] away and you'll want to throw funny
[3:58] thing was old

[4:03] run off out there
[4:04] you know what happened the mother
[4:05] bearing the other little bear
[4:09] honey oh so well maybe our meeting will
[4:12] be something on the head order I hope so
[4:14] we can keep telling how there is in the
[4:15] glory of God falling upon us all right
[4:18] I'm glad see they look children out I
[4:21] like to tell you something like that and
[4:23] make it more action we have more time we
[4:25] can talk a little more and we'll talk to
[4:27] dad mother now about something we're go
[4:29] talk on demonology in Psalms 103 1 2 3
[4:36] we read these verses most every minister
[4:39] clergyman or Bible reader knows and by
[4:42] heart bless the Lord O my soul and all
[4:45] that is within me bless His Holy Name
[4:47] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[4:50] all of his benefits who forgiveth all
[4:52] thine iniquity who healeth all of their
[4:55] diseases I want you to notice there it
[4:59] was an all who forgiveth all thine
[5:01] iniquities who heals all of our diseases
[5:04] now can we bow our heads just a moment
[5:06] now Heavenly Father we thank thee this
[5:08] afternoon for being out here we thank
[5:11] thee for these little children it's
[5:12] sitting around there's the man of
[5:14] tomorrow and women if there is a
[5:16] tomorrow if Jesus Terri's and our Father
[5:19] we pray that that you'll bless us now as
[5:21] we're talking now on your word and about
[5:24] the great enemy we have Satan we pray
[5:29] God that you'll let us put a thrown out
[5:33] on mechanized unit here the power of God
[5:35] that'll wish spending tonight and every
[5:37] inch of his ground Lord and showing that
[5:40] he don't have no legal rights at all
[5:42] that Christ defeated him in our stead
[5:44] there at Calvary when he died and he
[5:47] spoiled principalities and robbed Satan
[5:49] have ever ever his power that he had and
[5:52] God give us wisdom and understanding now
[5:54] to know and to explain to the people how
[5:58] that they might know how to be healed
[5:59] and to defeat Satan in Jesus name we
[6:01] pray amen now for a few minutes we go to
[6:06] speak on demonology you hear so much
[6:09] about demons now tomorrow afternoon
[6:11] we're probably finish up I wanted two
[6:13] days of this week anyhow to preach on
[6:15] this just are two days for afternoon
[6:17] services to talk on this
[6:20] now the first thing what a demon is you
[6:23] hear so many people talking about a
[6:25] demon well now a demon devil all comes
[6:30] from one word and in the English is
[6:32] called tar matter a fellow that torments
[6:36] is a devil a evil one he say now the
[6:43] Bible today there's two most so many
[6:48] people is some old backed book that
[6:51] Graham Paul Graham all read or something
[6:53] like that there's not much to it it's
[6:56] for the old folks and so forth but
[6:58] that's wrong it's for everybody and
[7:03] demons are tormentors that torment us
[7:05] now there is demons that comes into the
[7:09] soul of man and that is in the
[7:13] phraseology that would be that would be
[7:15] in the I'd say this'll the demon that
[7:18] comes into the soul is something at
[7:22] torments the soul many times you can see
[7:26] a person maybe of insanity now they may
[7:30] be yet a converted person fill with the
[7:33] holy spirit and yet be totally insane
[7:36] see that's right that has nothing to do
[7:39] with the soul it's a tormentor something
[7:43] at torments them now all sickness we
[7:46] have to find first that all sickness
[7:48] came from the devil God is not the
[7:51] author of sickness no sickness comes
[7:54] from God God sometimes permits Satan to
[7:58] put sickness on you as a whip to bring
[8:01] you back to the house of God when you've
[8:02] disobeyed but sickness in its beginning
[8:05] come from the devil could you imagine a
[8:08] person would believe that God our
[8:10] Heavenly Father would be the author of
[8:14] such a thing as sickness and death well
[8:17] no he isn't
[8:18] never was never will be
[8:22] dog permits death because of
[8:24] disobedience
[8:25] God permits death as one writer said all
[8:28] the deaths can do God harness the to of
[8:31] buggy and it
[8:32] pulls us into the presence of God a
[8:33] believer but a the word death means
[8:36] separation jesus said he that heareth my
[8:39] word and believeth on him and sent me
[8:41] hath everlasting life and he said I am
[8:45] the resurrection life he that believeth
[8:47] in me though he were dead yet shall he
[8:49] live and whosoever liveth and believeth
[8:50] in me shall never die and we packed the
[8:56] bodies of each other over the Saint
[8:58] lists of our graves but he shall never
[9:00] die now if you watch when he spoke of
[9:03] Lazarus he said Lazarus sleepeth the
[9:07] disciples man like we are they said all
[9:09] if he sleep as he do as well he meant
[9:12] taking a rest but they thought but he'd
[9:14] come and talk to them in their language
[9:15] he said he's dead
[9:17] what you believe but said I go wakey
[9:21] waking see when your death means
[9:26] separate now if one of you should one of
[9:29] your family died or something he is if
[9:32] it's converted they're not dead they're
[9:34] dead in the humanistic standpoint but
[9:37] they're just separated from us but
[9:39] they're in the presence of God they're
[9:42] not dead and they can't die it's
[9:44] impossible for him to die
[9:46] jesus said he that heareth my word and
[9:48] believeth on him that sent me has
[9:50] everlasting life and shall not come into
[9:53] judgment but has passed from death to
[9:55] life so he can't die anything it's
[9:59] immortal eternal it came perish it's
[10:02] imperishable life he's got it because
[10:05] God has give it to him and not not
[10:07] meritorious it's what it's unconditional
[10:10] God gives it to him God calls no man
[10:14] could come to God except God called him
[10:16] jesus said no man can come to me except
[10:19] my father causing drowsing that right so
[10:24] it's God and all maybe tomorrow
[10:26] afternoon we'd get a little bit more on
[10:27] that cause I want to get this thing of
[10:29] disease to you so that you'll see that
[10:31] there was a time when we become Dermott
[10:35] eyes and our great-grandfather you know
[10:38] that doctor knows that would you do to
[10:41] you Bible readers you know the germ of
[10:43] life started in your great-grandpa
[10:45] to becoming a germ and come out to your
[10:47] grandfather then into your father and
[10:49] then to your mother and where you are
[10:50] now that's right
[10:52] scripture even teaches that here's the
[10:55] scripture for you if you want I believe
[10:57] it said that Levi paid tithes when he
[11:00] was in the loins of Abraham which was
[11:02] his great-grandfather that right so see
[11:05] the germ become back there but your
[11:07] souls were made up before the foundation
[11:10] of the world and God created man in his
[11:12] own image spirit of man not a man in his
[11:18] own image but man in his own image see
[11:20] and then he made them male and female
[11:24] before he ever had a man in the dust the
[11:27] earth which we had a chance to Sassoon
[11:30] and take a time and go back into that
[11:32] just see how God now it's between the
[11:34] line but when you see it comes right up
[11:36] with the line and seeing how that God
[11:38] back in the beginning what he did there
[11:40] and how he moved down into the earth and
[11:42] how that may he made man in His image
[11:45] and then God turned around was made in
[11:47] the image of man to redeem man now when
[11:52] God made man in His image he was a
[11:53] spirit man and there then there was no
[11:56] man to till the soil that he created man
[11:58] how the dusty earth a chronologist and
[12:01] so forth and these people are searched
[12:03] and get old bones and so forth and
[12:05] believe in evolution
[12:06] I've even a right kind of evolution man
[12:08] a volutes from himself but not all from
[12:10] one cell no sir the calls a a bird has
[12:14] been a bird ever since God made him a
[12:16] bird and a monkeys been a monkey a man's
[12:19] been a man that's right now I was
[12:22] talking to a doctor here while back and
[12:24] Louisville he said while revered grandma
[12:27] told about how the navies of Africa how
[12:28] they eat just go down below some of the
[12:30] office things you'd ever see how they
[12:32] would eat just pick up things it's
[12:34] contaminated maggots in it just shake
[12:35] him on a maggot no don't make any
[12:37] difference to him see they said drink
[12:40] anything don't make any difference what
[12:42] it is he said but Brevard brand then
[12:44] people are not human I said oh yes they
[12:45] are
[12:46] they sure are human I said the closest
[12:49] thing to a human being in the beasts
[12:50] line is the Japan Sea and you tried for
[12:53] 4000 years get one motor out of that
[12:55] Japan
[12:55] and he can't do it I said cause he can't
[12:58] think yes nothing to think with or you
[13:01] can learning little things like a horse
[13:03] gee and haw put on glasses or smoke a
[13:05] cigar ballon see step on a bicycle ride
[13:08] a horse or something like that but just
[13:09] like Jian Hall to a horse or to a dog or
[13:12] something like that
[13:13] I said he's an animal but you let me go
[13:16] back in Africa to the wildest ride they
[13:18] got and that's the little tribe of the
[13:20] Bushmen now it said probably his great
[13:22] great great great grandfather never saw
[13:25] a white man or nothing the only thing he
[13:26] knows he don't even know which is right
[13:28] in left hand the only thing he knows is
[13:29] eke and he eats white and get his hands
[13:31] off it's human flesh anything else they
[13:33] can difference to him just so he eat but
[13:36] let me get him at five years old and at
[13:38] 15 years old you'll speak good English
[13:40] and have a good education why he's got a
[13:43] soul God made him a human being and he's
[13:47] got just as much right to hear the
[13:48] gospel at least once as we have the
[13:50] preaching around here all over America
[13:52] so the people over and over and over
[13:54] begging persuading and everything
[13:55] letting hear it one time in washing
[13:57] screen and run to the altar real quick
[13:58] see yes sir that's what my heart is
[14:02] brother today when I think of African
[14:04] that poor little black hands raising up
[14:05] sin brother branham one more time about
[14:07] Jesus whole mercy there's something in
[14:10] me digs and burn just as quick as I get
[14:13] money enough up I get over there too
[14:15] that's what I do is every penny I get
[14:17] everything God knows besides just what I
[14:20] can eat and most people give me the
[14:21] clothes and just what I can barely live
[14:24] by myself just as close as I can I
[14:27] thought right into missionary funds
[14:28] which the government has ranged you
[14:30] don't even pay income tax on it to get
[14:32] up three or four or five thousand
[14:33] dollars and I take a cross over there
[14:34] and preach the gospel to the people that
[14:36] I know that that day I'll have to answer
[14:39] now know what I answer for I used to
[14:42] want to go in a city at a hold a big
[14:43] meeting back when he had lots of money
[14:45] and they have great campaigns and
[14:47] thousands of dollars I give it order to
[14:48] Red Cross and so forth that's no slam to
[14:51] them but coming down the street in a
[14:53] four thousand dollar car is a big
[14:55] diamond studs own smoking a cigar five
[14:57] hundred dollars a week on the money
[14:59] that's sick people no sir no indeedy
[15:01] only as soon as you get out of the city
[15:04] they said of holy rollers and everything
[15:05] like I had to make him
[15:06] and down in the religion that we're
[15:08] sending it for no sir I take it myself
[15:10] and before God as my judge I put it in
[15:12] the gospel work on her so I know it on
[15:14] that day and I have to give an account
[15:16] for my stewardship it's given correctly
[15:18] that's exactly right cause I realize as
[15:21] I treat the people I'm treating God just
[15:23] my attitude towards you is my attitude
[15:25] towards Christ your attitude towards me
[15:28] is the same thing that's right towards
[15:30] Christ now to see of people like that
[15:33] and see how that a human being man with
[15:36] an immortal soul now that can't die
[15:39] can't perish kajan guns that have
[15:41] everlasting life that God sovereignly in
[15:43] his own will gave it to you and now then
[15:47] now I for all any correct this just a
[15:50] little bit of say something somebody's
[15:52] gotta go and say brother brand there's a
[15:53] Calvinists no I'm not I'm a Calvinist as
[15:56] long as Calvinist is in the Bible
[15:57] but when Calvinist gets out of the Bible
[16:00] then I'm on Armenian see I believe in
[16:02] holding this now I believe in Calvinists
[16:03] too but both of them one run out on the
[16:05] limb and went this way one rail the lamb
[16:07] and went that way if it wasn't for the
[16:09] book of Ephesians to bring it back and
[16:10] put it the right place where God did we
[16:12] don't hold Bo mixed up but they both got
[16:15] adopting but to go to seat on it each
[16:17] one that's the holiness and the
[16:19] Calvinists to the Armenian now Calvinist
[16:23] has something true I believe that that
[16:25] the Calvinistic doctrine oddly this
[16:27] insecurity I believe the church has
[16:29] eternal security any reader the Bible
[16:32] knows that calls God's already said it
[16:34] with a period or without blemish that
[16:36] right then it's go to be there is that
[16:38] right
[16:38] the by the church is eternally secured
[16:42] now are you in the church as the next
[16:44] thing if you're in the church all right
[16:46] you're secured with the church but you
[16:48] better stay in the church and how do you
[16:51] get in the church by shaking hands no
[16:53] put your name in the book no sir by one
[16:55] Spirit we were all baptized into one
[16:57] body and that body God judged at Calvary
[16:59] was the body of Jesus Christ and we're
[17:02] baptized into that body by one spirit we
[17:04] have eternal security as long as we're
[17:06] in the body of Christ nothing can
[17:08] separate us nothing can touch us if you
[17:11] go out you go out by your own will but
[17:13] just too sure if you're in the body of
[17:15] Christ as sure as Jesus rose from the
[17:17] dead you'll rise to
[17:18] God's already done that you can't sin or
[17:22] you die my be a sinner in your sight but
[17:24] if I'm the Christ God don't see it
[17:26] because his sins atones his blood atones
[17:28] for my sins there see I can't see him
[17:30] he's born of God does not commit sin for
[17:32] he cannot sin the seed of God remains
[17:35] anything see he's willing to if he's
[17:37] makes a mistake sure he's right then
[17:39] willing to confess it if he's a real
[17:41] Christian he will do it if he holds it
[17:43] back he shows he ain't got nothing in
[17:44] the first place right yeah he got
[17:47] nothing to begin with but if he's a real
[17:49] Christian right here you playing a grain
[17:50] of wheat in the ground it'll always be a
[17:52] grain of wheat chuckle burrs may be all
[17:54] around and everything else but it'll be
[17:55] a grain of wheat as long as it stands
[17:57] that right and if a man is really born
[18:00] to the Spirit of God he isn't in and out
[18:01] and back and forth your honor in the
[18:03] world out here no sir no no huh
[18:05] you're not a cocklebur one day and a
[18:07] grain of wheat the next day God don't
[18:08] have that in the field yes sir if you're
[18:10] born to the Spirit of God you're a
[18:12] Christian from that time until it till
[18:14] you go away and then you're you're
[18:16] immortal with God that's right if you're
[18:18] in the church now now let's talk about
[18:21] the death side now how could a person on
[18:23] that estate and that kind of a condition
[18:25] ever be sick because that your body is
[18:30] not yet redeemed your body is not
[18:34] redeemed no matter how much how good you
[18:37] are how saintly and how holy how much
[18:39] Holy Spirit that's only your soul and
[18:42] your soul is not completed yet it's just
[18:46] got the blessing the promise of God
[18:47] which is the earnest of our salvation
[18:50] but now if we have no earnest of our
[18:53] resurrection no divine healing then I'll
[18:57] have no assurance or nothing to prove to
[18:59] me that there is a resurrection just
[19:03] like oh Christ doesn't live in my heart
[19:04] if I have to take it from some kind of a
[19:07] psychological thing back gutter had to
[19:10] be somewhere like that well then I'd be
[19:13] a little skeptic oven and that's reason
[19:16] over in Africa when they come here come
[19:18] missionaries up bringing thousands of
[19:20] those natives and there's packing the
[19:21] little mud idols and everything else is
[19:23] because that they had just heard
[19:26] psychic side of the Bible that's right
[19:29] my own church is Baptist Methodist
[19:31] Presbyterian all went in there but when
[19:33] they seen the power of God come in
[19:35] demonstration that settled it they know
[19:37] that God was God but now what starts
[19:40] this sickness now the first thing it's a
[19:43] spirit before it becomes a disease just
[19:47] the same as you as a spirit before you
[19:50] become a human being now I'm going to
[19:52] take brother Woollett share as an
[19:54] example brother with it all right
[19:58] there was a time when you and I wasn't
[20:00] nothing and then the first thing God
[20:04] gave us a life and estate say if I take
[20:07] your body down this afternoon you're
[20:09] made up of a bunch of cells held
[20:13] together with atoms and now someday them
[20:18] atoms will be destroyed if Jesus Terri's
[20:20] you'll go on back they'll be just like
[20:23] they was in the beginning go back into
[20:24] the air but when your spirit returns
[20:26] will atom or gather together again with
[20:29] this spirit and bring forth another
[20:30] brother well that's just like that only
[20:32] younger when he was at his best when a
[20:35] man gets passed about 25 years old he
[20:37] finds a few wrinkles under his eyes and
[20:39] some gray hairs coming in let's go to be
[20:41] cause this after you and one of these
[20:45] days it's go to take you no matter who
[20:47] you are it's going to take you but it
[20:49] gradually you'll get in the corner here
[20:51] and God will get you out of that corner
[20:52] you're getting this corner here death
[20:53] alone was having over here but actually
[20:55] while it'll get you in but then what
[20:57] death can do it takes us full toll and
[20:59] then at when it's done all it can do
[21:03] when God gave you this life and used
[21:05] it's your best at about 23 when you come
[21:07] into the resurrection you'll come back
[21:09] just exactly like he was when you're 23
[21:11] years old 25 for death city and death
[21:15] will have everything that it can do it's
[21:17] set in there but you'll come right back
[21:19] where you were
[21:20] now if each one of your your cells in
[21:24] your body let's take it down now you
[21:27] come sell at your cells tell that you're
[21:29] selling lay it apart you're on a
[21:30] platform that you're each cell in your
[21:32] body you'll come down to one little tiny
[21:35] germ where you begin
[21:39] can be seen as a natural I yet to look
[21:42] under scope glasses I've seen the term
[21:44] of life under a microscope it looks like
[21:46] a little bitty thread and the first
[21:49] thing starts is writing a spine it's
[21:52] like a little knot that's the first
[21:54] little cell cumulates on top of a cell
[21:58] now if I had to take that one sing a
[22:01] little cell as ever wanted he come from
[22:03] one little teeny cell germ what is the
[22:06] germ a germ is the little teeny the
[22:09] smallest of cell dwell what's that to
[22:14] that now Chuck you down from every piece
[22:16] of you down to this one little cell and
[22:19] I haven't found you yet
[22:20] I've just got yourselves lay down well
[22:24] then next thing blood cells and flesh
[22:26] cells and whatever they are laying them
[22:27] all out here but I haven't got you yet
[22:29] now I'm down to one germ now well I'm
[22:32] going to take that little cell apart now
[22:34] where you at your life and the life
[22:39] makes the first cell which is a germ
[22:42] then everything actor its nature dog
[22:44] after dog bird after bird manager man
[22:47] developing cells cell on cells cell on
[22:49] cell comes up to where you are human
[22:52] being developing of cells now that was
[22:56] our deigned of God to be so but not what
[22:59] about a cancer of self of him a little
[23:01] bit now God gave you your life and say
[23:05] here you are today Here I am there if
[23:07] there's nothing on my hand but there
[23:09] might be a cancer on my hand sometimes
[23:12] well how'd that cancer get there let's
[23:14] see what the cancer is nice take him
[23:16] apart let's go take him now he's a bunch
[23:20] of cells soon did you know that tumor
[23:23] cataract any of those things or cells
[23:25] they don't have no form some of them
[23:27] spreads out and some look like a spider
[23:30] and some looks run streets the red
[23:32] cancers it's like long red threads that
[23:35] runs through and then needs a rolls
[23:37] cancer which usually comes out of the
[23:39] breasts of a woman
[23:40] it's like pancakes laying on one another
[23:42] and any court Spradling out they just
[23:43] grow anywhere sometimes tumors are
[23:46] lopsided this way long low oblong and
[23:49] everything they have no farm
[23:51] because they're after a spirit which has
[23:55] no farm but it's a developing of cells
[24:00] it's about yourselves it's saying you're
[24:03] right now is a tumor or cancer this
[24:06] developing cells growing growing growing
[24:09] it's eating
[24:11] suckin your life from you living on the
[24:14] blood stream cataract takes the mucus of
[24:16] the eye girls run over covers yourself
[24:18] over shut your eyes off someone comes in
[24:23] never gets like chewbert ler that comes
[24:26] just a little small germs there's
[24:28] nothing to the size of it the same sized
[24:30] germ makes an elephant makes a a
[24:33] nothing is the size of the germ and some
[24:35] of them takes body forms some never does
[24:37] and some ever goes into cells some
[24:39] become spirit torments the soul we're
[24:42] trying to get that party I'll leave that
[24:43] part for tomorrow afternoon if I can or
[24:46] that soul spirit comes and how down
[24:48] already here now friends I'm not telling
[24:51] this from some kind of a psychologic I
[24:52] have dealt with demons for years and you
[24:55] know that if you only knew the thing
[24:57] after the services is over at night what
[25:00] goes on sometimes you don't all remember
[25:03] when you come against the spirit you
[25:05] better know what you're speaking about
[25:08] just don't stand there and carry on
[25:10] cause it angle to do any good but when
[25:13] actually a demon has to obey you you'll
[25:16] recognize it it ain't how loud you
[25:17] holler and then how much aura you put on
[25:20] its what's back here that he'll
[25:22] recognize the truth Jesus just said
[25:25] James come on
[25:28] remember the sign
[25:41] [Music]
[25:54] you
[25:54] [Music]
[26:08] you
[26:10] [Music]
