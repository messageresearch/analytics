[50:05] for giving us a time of praying
[50:08] a touch from the Lord will make a big
[50:10] difference amen
[50:12] praise O Lord let's turn to Exodus
[50:15] chapter 19 to 9.
[50:17] Exodus chapter 19.
[50:44] Exodus chapter 19.
[50:59] the Lord has been good
[51:02] the Lord has been gracious
[51:06] water
[51:08] what a wonderful savior that we serve
[51:14] Exodus chapter 19.
[51:18] let's read from verse 1.
[51:28] in the third month when the children of
[51:31] Israel were gone forth
[51:33] out of the land of Egypt the same day
[51:37] came day Into the Wilderness of Sinai
[51:44] for they were Departed from raphidham
[51:48] and will come to the desert of Senate
[51:50] and have passed in the wilderness
[51:54] and there Israel come before the mount
[51:58] and Moses went up unto God and the Lord
[52:02] called unto him out of the mountain
[52:05] saying
[52:06] those shall their say to the house of
[52:10] Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[52:13] now listen to this listen to this
[52:15] conversation very very very clearly
[52:19] ye have seen what
[52:22] I did unto the Egyptians
[52:25] and how I beg you on ego wings
[52:30] and brought you to myself
[52:34] praise the Lord
[52:36] amen
[52:39] have anyone ever experienced being taken
[52:41] on ego range
[52:43] praise the Lord
[52:45] if you if you are saved by grace that's
[52:47] what Grace did for you
[52:51] praise the Lord
[52:52] unless you make your your unless you
[52:55] have made your own way to Salvation
[52:58] to be able to experience that this
[53:00] salvation
[53:01] by the grace of God
[53:04] is what it is to be bad on ego wings
[53:11] you have seen what I did unto the
[53:13] Egyptian and how I beared you on Eagle
[53:16] wings and brought you unto myself
[53:19] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[53:24] in be
[53:25] and keep my combining
[53:28] then years shall be a peculiar treasure
[53:33] unto me
[53:34] above all people
[53:37] for all the Earth is mine
[53:40] now if you listen to this conversation
[53:43] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[53:46] indeed it sounds like God is asking the
[53:52] people to do something
[53:55] does that sound like that
[53:58] if you ever obey my voice indeed and
[54:01] keep my combining
[54:03] praise the Lord
[54:04] but they covered in that God gave to
[54:07] Abraham was an unconditional Covenant
[54:11] right
[54:13] praise the Lord
[54:15] are we together
[54:17] now but if you follow this conversation
[54:20] it looks like God is establishing
[54:24] either a covenant or you have to do this
[54:29] that's how it might sound so you have to
[54:32] listen very carefully
[54:33] now therefore if ye will obey my voice
[54:36] indeed and keep my Covenant then
[54:40] ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[54:44] above all people
[54:47] for all the Earth is mine
[54:51] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[54:55] praise
[54:57] and a holy nation
[55:00] these are the words which thou shall
[55:04] speak unto the children of Israel
[55:07] and Moses came and called the other
[55:11] people
[55:13] and lay before their faces all these
[55:16] words which the Lord commanded him
[55:22] which the Lord told him to go and tell
[55:24] the people
[55:26] not not a commitment as this is my Lord
[55:30] you have to do it
[55:33] it's two different things
[55:37] and all the people answer together
[55:40] and said
[55:42] all that the Lord has spoken
[55:45] we will do
[55:49] and Moses returned
[55:52] the words of the people unto the Lord
[55:58] amen
[55:59] and the Lord said unto Moses Lord I come
[56:02] on today in a tech Cloud that the people
[56:05] may hear
[56:07] when I speak with them and believe thee
[56:10] forever
[56:11] and Moses told the words
[56:14] of the people unto the Lord
[56:18] let us pray
[56:19] heavenly father in the name of the Lord
[56:21] Jesus we just want to ask your blessings
[56:24] tonight Lord come in a special way
[56:27] father Lord and bless this Wednesday
[56:30] service tonight bless your people in the
[56:33] get so Lord father take your word
[56:34] tonight speak to our hearts o God In The
[56:37] Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[56:40] amen amen the Lord bless you you may
[56:43] have your seat praise the Lord come up
[57:06] [Music]
[57:08] thank you I had this I had this uh
[57:11] subject so much on my mind
[57:14] that when I came into church tonight I
[57:16] mean
[57:18] as
[57:19] my mind was just so much on what
[57:22] was burning on my heart
[57:24] tonight I want to I want to speak on a
[57:27] subject
[57:29] they are there
[57:31] I want to I want to start
[57:34] and I don't know when I will finish it
[57:37] but it's one of those ones
[57:39] all that the Lord has spoken
[57:42] mm-hmm we will do
[57:46] all that the Lord has spoken
[57:50] we will do
[57:54] praise the Lord
[57:56] all that the Lord have spoken
[58:00] we will do
[58:06] glory be to God
[58:08] now I will take you on the on a little
[58:10] journey tonight before we will We Will
[58:14] We Will Get Down uh to what we want to
[58:17] talk about tonight
[58:19] all that the Lord has spoken
[58:22] we will do take you through uh uh
[58:25] through the scripture and see how we got
[58:27] down to this place
[58:30] but
[58:32] if you if you go back and study you will
[58:35] realize that
[58:39] this was one of the place over and over
[58:42] about Brandon say that we were there a
[58:44] lot of quotes who will read on this
[58:45] subject
[58:46] but this is the place
[58:51] Exodus chapter 19 where is remain
[58:56] the most felter mistake
[59:03] I was going to speak on filter errors
[59:07] before I travel
[59:09] talking about all the different things
[59:11] we were talking about
[59:13] there are some things I wanted to to
[59:15] bring out through the scripture you know
[59:17] the Bible address our mistake in the
[59:21] book of first second John as Saints with
[59:24] an S those are our mistakes
[59:27] praise the Lord
[59:28] and I was like the common saying says it
[59:31] is it is uh you know it is it is human
[59:34] to Earth that's that's what comes with
[59:37] our fallen nature
[59:39] but there is a there is an error that a
[59:42] man or a woman a young boy or a young
[59:45] girl
[59:47] we fall into
[59:50] either by their choice
[59:52] or by deception
[59:54] that would become a filter mistake
[59:59] in your life
[1:00:01] praise the Lord
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:05] and uh one of those ones are the ones
[1:00:09] that is very common you know brother
[1:00:11] Branham in him in an instance give him
[1:00:13] message uh uh speak on that uh uh when
[1:00:16] he was talking about the virtues that
[1:00:18] were giving giving to the woman for
[1:00:20] Redemption you know and then he he talks
[1:00:23] about those three virtues and then he
[1:00:26] says if you might want he says uh uh you
[1:00:30] know uh you you you you will be
[1:00:33] forgiving he says but you will not be
[1:00:34] justified
[1:00:37] praise the Lord now those are some of
[1:00:41] the areas where you can say there's a
[1:00:42] filter mistake when the children of
[1:00:44] Israel said let his sin be upon us
[1:00:47] and on our children that was a fatal
[1:00:50] mistake
[1:00:52] praise the Lord
[1:00:54] and right here this is one of the the
[1:00:57] Fatal mistake that Israel made
[1:01:00] when they said all that the Lord has
[1:01:03] spoken
[1:01:05] we will do
[1:01:10] praise the Lord
[1:01:15] and how many times I've read through
[1:01:17] this chapter
[1:01:19] and uh and I've heard brother Brandon
[1:01:22] talking about it how the people for so
[1:01:24] Grace and they decided to take long
[1:01:28] and I've I've
[1:01:29] always played on my mind and and and and
[1:01:33] I I really wanted to to see it you know
[1:01:37] well you can you can see it brother
[1:01:38] Brandon says you know God God wanted to
[1:01:41] speak to the people they said no let
[1:01:42] Moses speak unto us you know uh uh you
[1:01:46] speak unto Moses and Moses will come to
[1:01:48] speak unto us now I've always used that
[1:01:51] as as where the people talk Lord and and
[1:01:54] reject Grace until recently uh we at
[1:01:58] home who was reading through the uh the
[1:02:00] book of Exodus and I came to this verse
[1:02:03] all that the people have spoken we would
[1:02:05] do and and it just stuck on my mind and
[1:02:08] now I kept thinking about it uh in in
[1:02:12] that the first time I look at it to me
[1:02:14] it was looking like an interesting verse
[1:02:16] it was looking like the people were
[1:02:18] taking a commitment
[1:02:20] but when you study the scripture you
[1:02:23] will realize that this was a defined
[1:02:27] statement
[1:02:30] praise the Lord
[1:02:32] this was a very defined statement
[1:02:38] as we look through the scripture
[1:02:41] as we will study tonight and I pray that
[1:02:44] the grace of God will be able to help us
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:48] as we look at this
[1:02:51] now David said something in Psalm 109
[1:02:56] let's read that
[1:02:58] Psalm 109 brother Brandon uh I took
[1:03:03] there when he preached a message God
[1:03:05] being misunderstood
[1:03:10] and you will see how this will soon tied
[1:03:13] into what we want to look at tonight
[1:03:16] praise the Lord
[1:03:18] Psalm 109
[1:03:41] praise the Lord
[1:04:02] now as we as we look into this
[1:04:07] as you will look into this let me let me
[1:04:10] help myself here this like
[1:04:12] um
[1:04:13] I'm a little bit off
[1:04:22] praise the Lord
[1:04:40] are we together
[1:05:00] okay
[1:05:03] now let's go ahead oh I will try to grab
[1:05:07] myself right in here
[1:05:11] trying to get ahead of myself a little
[1:05:13] bit
[1:05:19] now so we see here that uh
[1:05:23] Israel
[1:05:26] in the air joining
[1:05:30] they came through the rare sheet
[1:05:33] and uh
[1:05:38] we saw how God stood for his people
[1:05:42] and and give them a great victory
[1:05:47] he gave them a very Mighty victory
[1:05:51] uh in the uh in their walk with the Lord
[1:05:54] opened the red seed
[1:05:59] even the calling of Moses the prophet
[1:06:04] we saw the grace of God
[1:06:07] coming down just like we try to show
[1:06:10] this going uh
[1:06:12] Sunday
[1:06:14] why it was called the shout of the king
[1:06:17] in the camp of Israel
[1:06:20] because of the way that God
[1:06:23] manifested himself the provision that he
[1:06:25] gave to his people
[1:06:27] praise the Lord
[1:06:30] and uh
[1:06:33] brother Branham shared this
[1:06:36] this caught my mind when I was telling
[1:06:38] the message or he saw by himself he
[1:06:45] the prophet of God says I got out in the
[1:06:48] wilderness talking about Israel said oh
[1:06:51] give us something to do
[1:06:55] we want
[1:06:57] to form an organization
[1:07:00] and we want you to give us something to
[1:07:04] do
[1:07:05] let us let us make us something like
[1:07:09] that
[1:07:10] give us a law to keep
[1:07:14] Exodus 19 was the greatest mistake
[1:07:18] that Israel ever made
[1:07:22] praise the Lord
[1:07:24] when Grace has already provided their
[1:07:28] salvation
[1:07:31] then they wanted something to do
[1:07:33] to marinate
[1:07:37] God already sold to Abraham
[1:07:41] what he was going to do
[1:07:44] and he said let us have a lord
[1:07:48] and the Lord
[1:07:51] never did no one never kept it
[1:07:55] they never did
[1:07:59] praise the Lord
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:03] so we see here the other
[1:08:06] there was Israel fatal mistake
[1:08:11] there was an awful mistake
[1:08:19] and as we'll realize that uh
[1:08:23] is
[1:08:25] it has been that way with men I'm trying
[1:08:28] to find a place to put my foot here
[1:08:30] tonight
[1:08:32] believing that the Lord will be able to
[1:08:34] to grant us Grace
[1:08:37] you'll be able to grant us Grace
[1:08:40] the Lord
[1:08:43] that the Lord in his Mercy will be able
[1:08:46] to grant us Grace
[1:08:48] Hallelujah
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:59] now when Israel came through the Red Sea
[1:09:04] we all know the story
[1:09:06] Exodus chapter 15 that was when Moses
[1:09:09] raised his hands and he sank and he
[1:09:12] praised the Lord
[1:09:13] Miriam took the tambourine and she beat
[1:09:16] and she danced and praised the Lord
[1:09:20] but then we saw that after in Exodus
[1:09:23] chapter 16 just follow me in a little
[1:09:26] bit yeah
[1:09:29] right after that great victory in Exodus
[1:09:32] chapter 14 where we witnessed Exodus 13
[1:09:35] there the pillar of fire going and
[1:09:37] defending them you know uh
[1:09:41] uh the the
[1:09:44] Egyptians were running they were not
[1:09:46] they were not playing fun you know they
[1:09:48] were they were on the speed
[1:09:50] but yet the pillow fire caught them in a
[1:09:53] place where they were going nowhere
[1:09:55] they were running but they were going
[1:09:57] nowhere
[1:09:58] the children of Israel were walking
[1:10:01] but they were moving faster than the
[1:10:04] terror of Egypt
[1:10:06] praise the Lord
[1:10:09] I'm trying to build a story tonight for
[1:10:12] us to realize how it is so easy
[1:10:16] for us
[1:10:18] to honor estimate the grace of God
[1:10:21] that have kept us all of these years
[1:10:25] how it's so easy for us to underestimate
[1:10:28] the grace of God
[1:10:30] that is that is dealing with us and
[1:10:33] sometimes we think we need to do this
[1:10:36] you know to make ourselves to feel like
[1:10:39] we are fit in and you know we're ready
[1:10:41] for the Rapture and then you know we are
[1:10:43] doing this
[1:10:44] and then uh they went walking through
[1:10:47] the red seat
[1:10:49] the Egyptians only achara came right in
[1:10:52] the middle of the sea the Lord allowed
[1:10:53] them to get right in the middle where
[1:10:55] the the distance of going back was fire
[1:10:58] the distance of going forward and then
[1:11:00] the sea closed them up
[1:11:03] praise the Lord
[1:11:06] and the water swallowed him
[1:11:10] and then pretty soon
[1:11:14] we see the other
[1:11:16] in Exodus chapter 16.
[1:11:22] even in Exodus chapter 15 at the end at
[1:11:24] the end of uh of the verse chapter 15.
[1:11:31] the people were sown get across and they
[1:11:34] get tested and they want him to drink
[1:11:36] water
[1:11:38] is starting to call unto God to ask him
[1:11:42] for water to drink
[1:11:44] praise the Lord
[1:11:47] let me read this also
[1:11:53] that's Exodus chapter 15 verse 22 and
[1:11:57] Moses brought Israel from the rare seed
[1:11:59] and and he went out into the wood into
[1:12:02] the Wilderness of short and they went
[1:12:04] three days in the wilderness and found
[1:12:06] no water
[1:12:08] and when they came tomorrow they could
[1:12:12] not drink the water Samara fall
[1:12:15] they were better therefore the name of
[1:12:18] it is called married and the people
[1:12:19] murmured against Moses saying what shall
[1:12:24] we drink
[1:12:25] and Moses Cried unto the Lord and the
[1:12:28] Lord showed him a treat which when he
[1:12:31] have cast into the water the water were
[1:12:34] made sweet there
[1:12:36] he may for them a stature and an
[1:12:40] audience and there he proved him
[1:12:44] now listen to this now
[1:12:46] Moses did there the Lord showed Moses a
[1:12:49] trade he threw the treaty into the water
[1:12:52] the water became a water good for
[1:12:54] drinking but the Bible says there he
[1:12:57] made them a stature and an audience
[1:13:01] and there he proved him and said if thou
[1:13:05] will diligently yanking onto my voice
[1:13:08] onto the voice
[1:13:11] he came to the voice of the Lord thy God
[1:13:14] and will do that which is right in his
[1:13:17] sight
[1:13:18] and will give ears to his commandment
[1:13:22] and keep all his stature I will put none
[1:13:28] of these diseases
[1:13:30] upon thee which are broad which I have
[1:13:34] brought upon the Egyptians
[1:13:36] for I am the Lord they are healeth thee
[1:13:41] praise the Lord
[1:13:42] now if you read thou also it's almost
[1:13:45] like God is saying if you keep my
[1:13:47] Commandments then I will heal you but
[1:13:50] that's not what he's saying
[1:13:55] that is not what he's saying
[1:14:00] if you keep all of my statue then the
[1:14:03] diseases that are brought upon the
[1:14:05] Egyptians I will not bring it upon you
[1:14:07] that's not what he's saying
[1:14:11] now the scripture make us to know for
[1:14:13] the verified that that God instructed
[1:14:17] Moses to take a treat and put it in that
[1:14:19] water the Bible said he make a stature
[1:14:22] he did something to grab their attention
[1:14:25] but he never saw it
[1:14:28] they were so consumed in their needs and
[1:14:32] their loss he did something he make a
[1:14:35] stature and an audience to grab their
[1:14:37] attention
[1:14:40] but they never saw it
[1:14:47] praise the Lord
[1:14:53] oh may the Lord help us tonight
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] Hallelujah
[1:15:01] are we together
[1:15:03] praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus
[1:15:06] we serve
[1:15:09] he's a faithful God
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] oh
[1:15:16] he's a faithful God
[1:15:18] you love him
[1:15:22] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:15:31] now you will see here
[1:15:34] better
[1:15:37] uh
[1:15:42] I'm trying to find my voting tonight
[1:15:43] there's Psalm 106. I said 107 I see why
[1:15:48] uh I can't get where I want to get
[1:15:51] there's something I want to read to you
[1:15:52] tonight one or six
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:03] Psalm 106 let's read from verse 7.
[1:16:14] I'll just just listening to that last
[1:16:17] night
[1:16:19] David said our father
[1:16:22] understood that
[1:16:24] wanders in Egypt
[1:16:28] they remember net
[1:16:31] the multitudes of their Mercy
[1:16:35] but provoke him at the rare sea
[1:16:39] provoking by the Sea even at the Red Sea
[1:16:42] nevertheless he saved him
[1:16:45] for his name's sake
[1:16:48] that he might make his mighty power
[1:16:52] known amen make his mighty power to be
[1:16:56] known
[1:16:56] now
[1:17:02] it shows that
[1:17:05] these people got down in Egypt
[1:17:09] you have to realize that brother Branham
[1:17:11] says it was it was it was because of
[1:17:13] jealousy you know and hatred towards uh
[1:17:17] Jacob they got down there and uh uh and
[1:17:20] ran and naturally they realize they
[1:17:23] realized that everything that that
[1:17:24] Joseph said sorry not Jacob Joseph
[1:17:27] everything that Joseph said was truth
[1:17:31] praise the Lord
[1:17:33] amen amen
[1:17:36] the Bible says that in Genesis when
[1:17:38] Jacob one time told the dream to his
[1:17:41] father Joseph to the dream to his father
[1:17:43] Jacob
[1:17:44] Jacob said you mean mean and your mother
[1:17:48] and all your brothers
[1:17:51] will bow down to you
[1:17:54] you know I thought about this one time
[1:17:55] and realized that uh
[1:17:59] um Rachel never made it over to Egypt
[1:18:04] but yet it did not disqualify the
[1:18:07] Fulfillment
[1:18:09] of Joseph's dream
[1:18:12] you know when people get technical on
[1:18:14] Prophecy
[1:18:17] you have to realize that
[1:18:19] you are not a Josh of Prophecy
[1:18:25] you are not the judge of Prophecy the
[1:18:28] one that gave the prophecy and the
[1:18:30] purpose that he gave it for
[1:18:34] praise the Lord
[1:18:37] we all will talk about Joseph Dream
[1:18:40] and we never think on the fact that
[1:18:42] Rachel never make it to Egypt
[1:18:46] it did not make Joseph a false prophet
[1:18:53] okay let's go ahead let's let's leave
[1:18:55] that
[1:18:57] but they got down there and then pretty
[1:19:00] soon as as they settled down uh uh uh
[1:19:04] and and and and and not realizing that
[1:19:07] they were all playing in the in the
[1:19:10] enhance of Prophecy
[1:19:12] we we see here that uh pretty soon the
[1:19:16] people started settling down and then
[1:19:18] when it got under the hands of the uh of
[1:19:20] the Pharaoh that never knew Joseph
[1:19:23] they started getting angry against God
[1:19:28] praise the Lord
[1:19:30] when he came into Egypt and Joseph
[1:19:32] identified himself and said don't harm
[1:19:35] yourself God sent me in ahead of you to
[1:19:38] preserve life
[1:19:40] they brought the the family down and
[1:19:43] they all settled down they got the best
[1:19:45] part of the land they were all rejoicing
[1:19:48] in the god of Abraham
[1:19:50] they could all reflect back to what
[1:19:52] Joseph told them
[1:19:54] or or Jacob told them that Isaac told
[1:19:57] him that Abraham told Isaac about the
[1:20:00] land
[1:20:02] that we were so John that we all reflect
[1:20:04] into that could this be the prophecy
[1:20:07] could this be what what Abraham said
[1:20:11] praise the Lord but pray this song when
[1:20:14] there rose up a pharaoh that never knew
[1:20:17] Joseph
[1:20:18] and the people God honored the burden
[1:20:20] and and now they were whipped to make
[1:20:22] breaks and build a city and different
[1:20:25] things started happening instead of the
[1:20:27] people started conditioning their mind
[1:20:31] and thinking in their mind could this be
[1:20:33] happening for us to go back to the
[1:20:35] promised land which of course that's
[1:20:37] exactly what God was doing God was
[1:20:40] taking their comfort wrong on them so
[1:20:43] they can start preparing their heart to
[1:20:44] goes over to the promised land
[1:20:46] praise the Lord and the Very preparation
[1:20:50] the very condition that God had caused
[1:20:53] to prepare the people
[1:20:55] started making the people to get angry
[1:20:57] against God
[1:21:01] praise the Lord where is God what is the
[1:21:03] god of our fathers Abraham how could we
[1:21:06] be in this situation
[1:21:09] how could this be happening to me
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:14] when that is just the very condition
[1:21:17] that God wants you to be in
[1:21:20] to get you out of Egypt
[1:21:26] the praise the Lord
[1:21:27] are we together
[1:21:30] that's just the very condition
[1:21:33] that he wanted them to be
[1:21:39] when Jacob died he told him
[1:21:43] to take his bones and bear it with his
[1:21:45] father
[1:21:47] when Joseph will also die he told him
[1:21:49] don't leave my bones here because I know
[1:21:51] God will visit you
[1:21:55] praise the Lord
[1:21:57] Hallelujah now when all of these things
[1:22:01] are happening around them why couldn't
[1:22:03] they think
[1:22:05] could this be
[1:22:08] praise the Lord
[1:22:09] oh my brother Brandon said God is never
[1:22:11] without a witness
[1:22:13] teaching them Moses brother Branham said
[1:22:15] there was a man called amram Praise the
[1:22:18] Lord he said I'm wrong will come from a
[1:22:20] high day of work
[1:22:23] with his back bleeding and peace he says
[1:22:26] he would climb up into the Arctic and he
[1:22:29] would lift his hands up and say Jehovah
[1:22:31] God
[1:22:32] you promised to get us out of here if we
[1:22:35] would get out of here you have to send a
[1:22:37] deliverer this place is not our home
[1:22:41] while the others were looking for
[1:22:43] comfort in Egypt amram was crying to get
[1:22:46] out of Egypt
[1:22:52] praise the Lord Brother bam says Jacob
[1:22:55] Bell would come and says Hamra you are
[1:22:57] so tired you you worked so hard
[1:23:01] he would say honey
[1:23:03] somebody have to pray we have a promise
[1:23:05] there's a promise in the world for us to
[1:23:08] get out of here
[1:23:10] praise the Lord
[1:23:12] and God always reward them that seek Him
[1:23:16] diligently
[1:23:20] he's a rewarder of them that seek Him
[1:23:23] diligently and God rewarded amra
[1:23:27] because you pray for the deliverer
[1:23:29] through you the deliverer will come yes
[1:23:31] sir
[1:23:35] Hallelujah while the others were seeking
[1:23:38] comfort in Egypt was crying
[1:23:43] for a deliverer to get out
[1:23:48] are we together
[1:23:52] praise the Lord
[1:23:54] so you see pretty soon the people forget
[1:23:56] about it
[1:23:58] and that has just been man's condition
[1:24:01] that is just our situation pretty soon
[1:24:04] we forget about how God has been so
[1:24:07] gracious
[1:24:08] and so merciful to us
[1:24:11] and many times we don't even understand
[1:24:18] praise the Lord
[1:24:19] let me tell you you are born with a
[1:24:22] selfish nature if God don't use Grace to
[1:24:25] force your life from you you will force
[1:24:28] yourself to hell
[1:24:30] right you will be so selfish for
[1:24:32] yourself
[1:24:36] right if Grace Grace have to rise up
[1:24:38] with you the same way he rise up with
[1:24:41] Jacob and
[1:24:43] Grace have to rise up with you to get
[1:24:46] your attention Grace have to rise up
[1:24:49] with you
[1:24:52] if not with your own selfish nature you
[1:24:55] will deny God from saving you
[1:24:57] and run yourself to hell
[1:25:05] oh let's understand the grace of God a
[1:25:07] little bit tonight because that's what I
[1:25:09] want to travel to
[1:25:11] let's understand this thing we call
[1:25:13] Grace
[1:25:15] gods of merits of favor
[1:25:21] let's understand what the grace of God
[1:25:23] is
[1:25:27] you hear the statement of the people all
[1:25:29] that the Lord says we will do
[1:25:32] same thing we are saying today
[1:25:37] you think that you now you have a
[1:25:39] revelation
[1:25:40] of the message
[1:25:44] I'm taking this thing
[1:25:46] you can stain
[1:25:49] you are able to stand
[1:25:51] with Father grace of God
[1:25:58] praise the Lord
[1:26:00] let the Lord just allow the little thing
[1:26:02] to happen then we write into a ticket
[1:26:04] then we think now we have a revelation
[1:26:05] of the word of God or the word of God
[1:26:10] that we cannot even wait to see Lord
[1:26:13] what are you doing right
[1:26:15] right what is this all about
[1:26:19] praise the Lord
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:29] when it used to be that uh when the
[1:26:32] people of God will have a problem the
[1:26:34] way they solve their problem was to come
[1:26:37] together and call on the name of the
[1:26:39] Lord they get down on their knees in
[1:26:41] fasting and praying but let there come
[1:26:43] probably the way we solve our problem is
[1:26:46] we leave church
[1:26:50] we leave church
[1:26:53] let's just come and issue the way that
[1:26:55] we solve our problem is to leave church
[1:26:58] because we're taking a stand you don't
[1:27:01] understand the grace of God
[1:27:03] whenever you do that is
[1:27:05] self-righteousness and you are
[1:27:07] understanding on what you think
[1:27:11] is right
[1:27:17] because walls are fought for principle
[1:27:21] praise the Lord you cannot stay outside
[1:27:24] and solve the problem that is in the
[1:27:25] house you have to stay right there
[1:27:30] when there's a problem stay right there
[1:27:32] that's what family do they stay right
[1:27:34] there in the summit
[1:27:37] how can you stay outside and clean the
[1:27:39] floor
[1:27:48] all that the law says we will do
[1:27:54] was a defy statement
[1:27:58] it means that they never understood what
[1:28:01] God was saying
[1:28:06] Moses go and tell the Lord oh all that
[1:28:09] Allah said whatever he required of us
[1:28:12] you see these people came from honor
[1:28:14] bondage they came from honor the whip of
[1:28:17] the Egyptians if the Egyptian wanted
[1:28:19] them to work from six to six they
[1:28:21] whipped their back and they would do it
[1:28:24] all right
[1:28:25] praise the Lord
[1:28:27] so when that when a person when a person
[1:28:29] is on up on a burden on a bondage
[1:28:32] praise the Lord you you don't do the
[1:28:35] work because you love it
[1:28:37] you do it because you are bound to do it
[1:28:42] amen you want to reduce the the whip on
[1:28:45] your back
[1:28:47] so you ask yourself to say you are
[1:28:49] working you are working you you are not
[1:28:51] happy you're not enjoying it
[1:28:54] and they took their attitude before God
[1:29:00] how could they see the opening of the
[1:29:03] rare seed
[1:29:05] they saw the Terrors of the Egyptian
[1:29:07] behind them how could people like that
[1:29:12] starts to murmur
[1:29:15] starts to complain
[1:29:20] the god that split the rest he came he
[1:29:23] gave you water to drink
[1:29:26] it's so easy for the human mind
[1:29:29] to disappreciate the grace of God
[1:29:42] we have reduced Our God to tangible
[1:29:45] substance
[1:29:50] praise the Lord
[1:29:53] that's the reason why this age is so far
[1:29:56] from God
[1:29:58] is so far from God
[1:30:01] is because we have reduced God
[1:30:07] tangible substance
[1:30:14] and then when we're ready we are in a
[1:30:17] message
[1:30:18] we are the bride
[1:30:22] it's not even said with Grace
[1:30:26] it said with pride and a boastful spirit
[1:30:31] it's not even said with grace that God
[1:30:34] in his grace
[1:30:38] it has picked me up
[1:30:42] we don't even see it like that
[1:30:48] we don't see you like that
[1:30:57] all that the Lord has spoken
[1:31:00] we will do brother Brandon said in God
[1:31:03] Be Misunderstood he said you know
[1:31:07] misunderstanding get us in a lot of
[1:31:09] trouble
[1:31:12] misunderstanding get us in a lot of
[1:31:15] trouble many times
[1:31:17] there are people say things
[1:31:20] that they repeat after somebody else
[1:31:25] where
[1:31:26] the misunderstooding
[1:31:30] right you see that's what he was saying
[1:31:31] I I was there I hear it that's what he
[1:31:34] was saying
[1:31:36] and they are completely
[1:31:38] hmm
[1:31:40] Flyway
[1:31:44] praise the Lord
[1:31:46] I just had to deal with a situation
[1:31:47] yesterday talking to a brother
[1:31:50] and uh
[1:31:51] when that's when he said wow that was
[1:31:53] completely different from what I heard
[1:31:58] that's just I told him I said well
[1:32:01] anyway
[1:32:03] I was there
[1:32:06] praise the Lord I was there
[1:32:09] well let's go here
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:13] misunderstanding get us into a lot of
[1:32:16] trouble many times people say things
[1:32:18] that they repeat after somebody else
[1:32:22] were they they misunderstand him that
[1:32:26] gets a person in trouble
[1:32:28] I believe it will be good for us if we
[1:32:32] will just well wait
[1:32:36] wait
[1:32:44] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:32:47] you would not you will not be a good
[1:32:49] judge if you want to run judgment by
[1:32:51] just hearing one party
[1:32:53] right there you go
[1:32:57] praise the Lord
[1:33:01] oh Hallelujah
[1:33:04] all that the Lord said
[1:33:07] we will do
[1:33:09] me
[1:33:11] that is a challenging statement
[1:33:16] that is a challenging statement you will
[1:33:18] not you will not you will not realize
[1:33:21] what I'm struggling to preach this
[1:33:24] you won't realize it
[1:33:26] because to me it's not just a message
[1:33:30] praise the Lord
[1:33:34] when the Lord
[1:33:36] started dealing with my heart on this
[1:33:38] subject and I started seeing
[1:33:41] what brother Branham has made all true
[1:33:44] when he talked about how Grace provided
[1:33:47] them a prophet
[1:33:49] Grace provided them a savior
[1:33:56] Grace provided them a brazing serpent
[1:34:05] praise the Lord
[1:34:06] and yet the people
[1:34:11] wanted law they wanted something to do
[1:34:17] they wanted something to do
[1:34:23] and just like how those people were
[1:34:26] enslaved
[1:34:27] that's how the sin nature enslaved us
[1:34:31] right from birth
[1:34:37] that's how the same nature enslaved us
[1:34:40] so you don't have to go in a word and
[1:34:42] and be on drugs
[1:34:45] you don't have to go in a word and and
[1:34:47] say what you want to experience sin
[1:34:51] you are already born on a slave nature
[1:34:59] and nature that enslaved you when you
[1:35:01] came right from the womb
[1:35:05] and because of that nature
[1:35:11] we always have anything
[1:35:16] yeah
[1:35:19] we want to do something it's always in
[1:35:22] US
[1:35:26] praise the Lord it's always in US
[1:35:33] that we don't even appreciate the grace
[1:35:36] to realize when brother Brown says
[1:35:38] wanting a million that there were
[1:35:40] million cells
[1:35:43] blood cells that came from your father
[1:35:45] and blood cells that came from our
[1:35:47] mother
[1:35:49] and it is by grace that elected the one
[1:35:52] that met the blood cells to make you
[1:35:56] if there were two other that was going
[1:35:58] to meet you will not be here
[1:36:03] all of those blood cells they
[1:36:05] are your brothers and sisters
[1:36:10] all of those air shelves they are your
[1:36:12] brothers and said but God he did the
[1:36:14] choosing
[1:36:15] the one that would meet the excess to
[1:36:17] make you was God that did the choosing
[1:36:20] you never had no work in it
[1:36:32] yourself what we are
[1:36:35] I'm telling it if God
[1:36:38] take his grace back
[1:36:41] in every one of us here tonight
[1:36:44] let me tell you there is more evil in US
[1:36:49] than good
[1:36:51] the only goat you have in US
[1:36:53] tonight is the grace of God
[1:36:57] that's the only good
[1:36:59] that is in you tonight
[1:37:03] tell me about all that you want to tell
[1:37:05] me about I will tell you to not write in
[1:37:07] your blood cells there is more evil if
[1:37:11] God will just extract that Grace
[1:37:14] may God be merciful if God would just
[1:37:18] extract that Grace
[1:37:25] Elijah told uh that Captain I Hazel
[1:37:30] he says I see the evil that you would do
[1:37:32] to the daughters of Israel how you will
[1:37:34] ravage them and dash their babies on the
[1:37:36] wall
[1:37:37] he said am I a dog
[1:37:40] am I a dog that I will be that Wicked
[1:37:44] he was the man
[1:37:47] he was the man that led War to Israel
[1:37:50] because a prophet has said a dog will
[1:37:53] lick the blood of Ahab
[1:37:55] so it was not going to be a gentle War
[1:37:57] it has to be a bloody one he was the
[1:38:00] captain
[1:38:03] in God
[1:38:05] take his grace
[1:38:07] your life
[1:38:13] we better learn to start appreciating
[1:38:15] the grace of God more than anything
[1:38:18] appreciate the grace of God more than
[1:38:20] the breath that you breathe
[1:38:25] because if it's not the grace of God
[1:38:27] your breath will not even smell better
[1:38:29] to yourself
[1:38:34] oh that the Lord says
[1:38:37] we will do
[1:38:39] praise the Lord
[1:38:42] even for us to be here tonight is the
[1:38:45] grace of God
[1:38:47] oh yeah
[1:38:50] to stay home
[1:38:53] you go I found some kind of a reason to
[1:38:54] stay home I'm tired from work
[1:38:58] praise the Lord I have to get up get up
[1:39:00] and go to work tomorrow or you know the
[1:39:02] children got to go to school you could
[1:39:03] have found some kind of her
[1:39:06] reason not to be here
[1:39:14] but we come to the to us of God
[1:39:17] God people when we come to the house of
[1:39:20] God
[1:39:24] you have to fight yourself every meaning
[1:39:28] praise the Lord
[1:39:29] amen
[1:39:31] not to take anything against a brother
[1:39:33] that is singing or a person that is
[1:39:35] doing something or whatever you have to
[1:39:38] fight yourself
[1:39:39] and try to be in the right mental state
[1:39:42] and say Lord I'm thanking you for being
[1:39:45] here
[1:39:48] that's the reason why we have to press
[1:39:50] through and go in the bill
[1:39:52] and go beyond every distraction
[1:39:58] from working and whatever you have to do
[1:40:00] come to the house of God just to show up
[1:40:06] just to show up
[1:40:08] and you are not in the service

[1:40:21] are we together
[1:40:26] thank you so easy to misunderstand
[1:40:38] we have to understand these things we
[1:40:40] have to understand it
[1:40:44] praise the Lord
[1:40:46] the message of the hour
[1:40:49] has come to be able to teach us
[1:40:52] how to deal with this present life
[1:40:56] brother Branham says there is two-thirds
[1:40:58] of our being
[1:41:00] that is under the prince of the power of
[1:41:02] the air
[1:41:04] praise the Lord
[1:41:06] this flesh of ours will never be
[1:41:08] converted
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:12] the spirit man is birthed between Eve
[1:41:16] and the second
[1:41:26] so in in this body
[1:41:29] in this body
[1:41:31] is is more even science proven
[1:41:36] I can I can bring you a diagram on
[1:41:38] Sunday and and show you how things
[1:41:42] drift to the left
[1:41:45] more than to the right
[1:41:50] praise the Lord
[1:41:51] amen you clean up the garage or clean up
[1:41:55] the house
[1:41:56] pack everything
[1:42:01] unless you travel as long as you stay in
[1:42:04] that place is going to scatter
[1:42:10] it's going to scatter
[1:42:12] unless you just leave it like that like
[1:42:15] the house in golf
[1:42:17] as long as you stay there
[1:42:21] what's up with this thing
[1:42:23] um
[1:42:24] where did I leave it maybe honor this
[1:42:26] before you realize it think that you're
[1:42:28] feeling parking you're not feeling
[1:42:29] disorganizing everything
[1:42:31] after three months he said after I clean
[1:42:34] this house
[1:42:36] it's more easy to drift to the left
[1:42:49] are we together
[1:42:51] so you see there are uh that's the
[1:42:53] reason why we we have to
[1:42:56] stay Stayed under the grace of God keep
[1:43:01] appreciating the grace of God keep
[1:43:03] thanking God for his grace
[1:43:06] praise the Lord that's why James said we
[1:43:09] cannot just break and say tomorrow I
[1:43:11] will be there he said Say by the grace
[1:43:13] of God
[1:43:18] praise the Lord Paul says he says Lord
[1:43:20] ceasing seizing my seizing my words by
[1:43:23] your grace
[1:43:31] what I'm doing tonight
[1:43:33] I want to bring us to the place for
[1:43:35] those two
[1:43:37] appreciate what Grace have done for us
[1:43:40] praise the Lord if there is any good in
[1:43:44] our life
[1:43:46] is what Grace had given to you
[1:43:51] and then when when you when we start to
[1:43:54] take some of the some of the simple
[1:43:57] irrelevant things
[1:44:00] to to to disappreciate
[1:44:07] praise the Lord
[1:44:12] better man said Grace give them a
[1:44:14] prophet
[1:44:17] the man I will come right there and and
[1:44:19] and right before the eyes they see Moses
[1:44:21] speaking the word of God
[1:44:26] praise the Lord
[1:44:28] have some things I want to go into on
[1:44:30] Sunday by the grace of God if the Lord
[1:44:31] will just would just help me keep
[1:44:33] praying for me
[1:44:36] and the program talks you know right
[1:44:37] there in in uh in Exeter more the most
[1:44:40] thing that we think about is uh uh uh
[1:44:43] James and Jamber throwing down the Aztec
[1:44:45] but there were other things that Moses
[1:44:46] did
[1:44:47] that they were able to do
[1:44:52] oh yeah
[1:44:55] praise the Lord
[1:44:57] it's also amazing that God gave Egypt
[1:45:00] templates
[1:45:02] and he gave the Hebrews 10 Commandments
[1:45:06] what was that for
[1:45:09] what was that for
[1:45:12] I was talking to to the kids in bed last
[1:45:14] night we were reading and that says
[1:45:16] assist you you know you
[1:45:19] you think about that
[1:45:21] they had 10 10 10 plagues
[1:45:25] in the Hebrew had Ten Commandments
[1:45:28] what was it for
[1:45:36] I know I get your wheels all spinning
[1:45:38] numbers just stay here with me stay with
[1:45:41] me I will soon let you go home for the
[1:45:43] night
[1:45:44] praise the Lord
[1:45:47] ah
[1:45:50] all that the Lord said
[1:45:53] will do but Brandon said that was the
[1:45:56] greatest mistake
[1:45:58] that is remain
[1:46:01] chapter 16 uh the cry for food
[1:46:05] it was better for us to be in Egypt we
[1:46:07] had enough food to eat
[1:46:11] it was better for you to be in Egypt
[1:46:14] you know what you're talking about
[1:46:24] praise the Lord
[1:46:29] we always like to hold glory in our past
[1:46:33] our past has become our hero
[1:46:41] praise the Lord
[1:46:46] and God came down again and God give him
[1:46:49] manner give them food and he repeated
[1:46:52] the same word to them if I will keep my
[1:46:55] Commandments
[1:46:58] oh this is what I want to do
[1:47:00] man
[1:47:02] the thoughts of God are deep brother one
[1:47:05] they are very very deep When God says
[1:47:09] one thing to you his thoughts are deep
[1:47:16] that's the reason why you don't take a
[1:47:17] Bible verse and just run with it
[1:47:22] because those are the internal thoughts
[1:47:24] of God
[1:47:27] your idea about it is just a grain of
[1:47:29] sin
[1:47:31] it just like you struggle on the ground
[1:47:33] and you pick up the grain of sand and
[1:47:34] you're running with it nobody can see it
[1:47:43] that's the reason why we need to come
[1:47:45] back
[1:47:48] that's the reason why we need to come
[1:47:50] back let me read some few things to you
[1:47:52] then we find a place to close here I
[1:47:54] think I've I struggle but I think I got
[1:47:56] you to a good place tonight
[1:47:59] I can leave you here but Brandon says
[1:48:01] they started out really with Grace the
[1:48:05] message paradox
[1:48:06] with grace to begin with before the high
[1:48:10] Lord the high Grace
[1:48:13] while they were in Egypt with our Lord
[1:48:16] no one down there was just the priest
[1:48:21] and so for bad they didn't have any law
[1:48:26] their law had not yet been given Grace
[1:48:30] provided them a prophet
[1:48:33] also Grace provided and atuming
[1:48:37] the sacrificial lamb
[1:48:39] we are getting into this week on the
[1:48:43] sacrifice the blood because
[1:48:46] there lays your healing
[1:48:49] it's in the grace of God
[1:48:53] that will lay your healing
[1:48:56] the atonement has been provided before
[1:48:59] there was any law Grace was before law
[1:49:03] during law and after Lord
[1:49:07] it will be the grace of God
[1:49:10] that's right
[1:49:11] it was before the Lord even when the
[1:49:14] Lord was giving Grace was there
[1:49:20] if God just caught them by the Lord you
[1:49:22] have wet them out
[1:49:35] oh may we just learn to appreciate the
[1:49:37] Lord Jehovah Jeremy says now the
[1:49:40] Covenant was giving unconditionally
[1:49:43] now Israel they see natural exchange
[1:49:48] that
[1:49:50] and lost it in Exodus 19. God gave their
[1:49:56] father Abraham an unconditional Covenant
[1:50:00] but they exchange it
[1:50:02] Lord
[1:50:07] praise the Lord
[1:50:08] oh if you understand the grace of God
[1:50:13] the grace of God is not selfish
[1:50:17] for God so loved the word
[1:50:19] that he gave his only begotten son it's
[1:50:22] now for God so Lord the elect oh God so
[1:50:24] Lord the bride for God so loved the word
[1:50:31] if you understand the grace of God
[1:50:34] he gave you so much grace for others
[1:50:43] Exodus chapter 17.
[1:50:46] after they finish eating manner from
[1:50:48] heaven
[1:50:52] driving today I said oh God have mercy
[1:50:55] on us man has not changed after the
[1:50:57] finish eating man and Moses told them
[1:50:59] don't keep nothing they still defy him
[1:51:02] they want to keep it in the morning it
[1:51:04] turned to Maggie
[1:51:06] when were we listing people
[1:51:10] when will we listening
[1:51:13] when were we listening you talk to
[1:51:16] somebody and says God will reveal it to
[1:51:18] me I will pray for God to reveal it to
[1:51:19] me
[1:51:21] foreign
[1:51:33] we have all become Divine prophets for
[1:51:35] God to to revate I'm I'm not I'm not
[1:51:37] putting any kind of a stand that God can
[1:51:40] relate to you
[1:51:43] praise the Lord but there are many ways
[1:51:46] that God speak to his children
[1:51:54] we'll get into that as we go here
[1:51:55] because we're not finished with the just
[1:51:57] now
[1:51:58] would travel in there a little bit
[1:52:01] we would travel in there and then we
[1:52:03] realized that many of the things that we
[1:52:06] do
[1:52:08] many of the things that we do
[1:52:10] with good intention
[1:52:12] we are not appreciating the grace of God
[1:52:18] our intentions are good
[1:52:21] but we are out
[1:52:22] of the grace of God
[1:52:32] praise the Lord
[1:52:37] I just I just want to take it easy you
[1:52:42] I read this one and yet and then and
[1:52:44] then I kind of a close he had a
[1:52:49] close and leave you here
[1:52:51] stay here and enjoy what you're a better
[1:52:53] branches look God after he had made the
[1:52:56] confidence with Abraham Grace already
[1:52:59] provided a prophet deliverer for them
[1:53:04] praise the Lord
[1:53:06] amen
[1:53:11] we see all of those things
[1:53:13] we think about a prophet
[1:53:15] Grace has given us a prophet
[1:53:18] that we can find ourselves honor a
[1:53:21] prophet
[1:53:23] a prophet messenger
[1:53:28] brother made himself a prophet and say
[1:53:31] come and believe me as a prophet
[1:53:35] praise the Lord
[1:53:36] many times he caught himself in the
[1:53:38] prayer line honor a Divine gift he still
[1:53:41] struggle
[1:53:42] sorry I mean your brother
[1:53:46] honor a Divine girl he still struggle to
[1:53:48] shout away from that
[1:53:52] he was a prophet because the word of God
[1:53:53] Vindicated him as a prophet
[1:53:56] Malachi 4 said before I send you Elijah
[1:53:59] the prophet before the great and
[1:54:01] Dreadful day
[1:54:03] God says if I don't send Elijah I will
[1:54:06] smash the Earth with a curse
[1:54:09] God reaching Mercy brother Branham says
[1:54:12] that was God's atonement to this
[1:54:14] generation
[1:54:24] let me tell you Church brother Branham
[1:54:26] is now part of your faithful Ministry
[1:54:28] prophet
[1:54:29] he's not a fight for Ministry Prophet no
[1:54:35] don't put him in among the efficients
[1:54:37] prophet
[1:54:39] right
[1:54:51] we get time to get into all of that
[1:54:54] he says already provide a prophet and
[1:54:57] deliver think about it
[1:55:00] lead the prophet
[1:55:02] Grace
[1:55:05] give you parents
[1:55:08] Grace gave you Paris
[1:55:13] to take care of you to deny themselves
[1:55:17] wanting the best for you
[1:55:27] and sometimes you see a dividing a
[1:55:29] defined age
[1:55:32] where people don't even regard their
[1:55:34] parents
[1:55:41] this age the Bible says it's an age that
[1:55:44] is very unthinkable
[1:55:47] yeah
[1:55:50] praise the Lord
[1:55:53] this group we have here that we call the
[1:55:56] church Grace provided this group yes
[1:55:59] yes right we never went campaigning
[1:56:01] around the contract or around the state
[1:56:03] and say come to Minnesota
[1:56:10] and here we come we don't appreciate
[1:56:14] having a church
[1:56:16] where we can come to
[1:56:19] we don't appreciate it
[1:56:23] we get our qualification and
[1:56:25] classification in our mind
[1:56:30] we want this that and the other
[1:56:34] no one effort
[1:56:40] to believe God get out on your knees and
[1:56:42] cry to God
[1:56:47] praise the Lord
[1:56:50] Grace gave you a pastor
[1:56:55] praise the Lord give me the choice I
[1:56:57] don't want it
[1:57:00] I'm I'm being I'm Being Earnest with you
[1:57:02] give me the choice I don't want it
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:15] Grace gave you a wife
[1:57:22] well we'll think that we are the man of
[1:57:24] the house
[1:57:29] we can find all the courts to protect
[1:57:32] ourselves and now make us rule us
[1:57:36] you don't know the grace of God
[1:57:39] you don't know the grace of God
[1:57:45] you don't know the grace of God
[1:57:48] Grace gave you the children you have
[1:57:54] when you stand there with a defined
[1:57:56] Spirit you don't know why your path uh
[1:57:58] why your mind
[1:58:00] hmm
[1:58:07] because we because we want whatever we
[1:58:09] want to to you now you you have found a
[1:58:12] child you put the legs you put the head
[1:58:14] everything together that child must be
[1:58:15] the way you want it to be
[1:58:17] you don't know the grace
[1:58:25] all that the Lord has spoken
[1:58:29] can you do all that the Lord has spoken
[1:58:33] God said some of the people to the
[1:58:35] mountain
[1:58:36] bring them up
[1:58:40] he had not even started speaking
[1:58:43] mostly like
[1:58:45] I thought you say all that the Lord has
[1:58:46] spoken you would do
[1:58:49] you're supposed to stand up get out
[1:58:50] yourself like he told job staying and
[1:58:53] listening how will you do everything
[1:58:55] that he said if you will not stand there
[1:58:56] to listen
[1:58:58] now you want him to speak to Moses
[1:59:01] for Moses to come and speak to you
[1:59:03] right when sometimes you show people
[1:59:05] thing right in the word
[1:59:07] you say the scripture has said the
[1:59:09] prophet has said you say I'll pray so
[1:59:11] God can relate it to me
[1:59:20] how we spring the mercy of God
[1:59:23] we trample over the grace of God
[1:59:26] because we have God so smart
[1:59:30] praise the Lord
[1:59:33] you know why God gave the Ten
[1:59:35] Commandments to those people let me get
[1:59:36] ahead of myself we will get there
[1:59:38] The Ten Commandments was to show the
[1:59:42] human flawed
[1:59:43] everything that God asks for in the Ten
[1:59:46] Commandment was was the fault of the
[1:59:48] people
[1:59:50] it was an expulsion of their sin
[1:59:56] that I shall not convert because he know
[1:59:59] is Indian
[2:00:02] it's in him
[2:00:04] so God was just exposing them God was
[2:00:07] telling them this is what is in you
[2:00:10] I'll pick you up my ego with I snatch
[2:00:14] you out of Egypt
[2:00:16] I took you for the curse of your first
[2:00:18] birth
[2:00:19] I snatch you as an eagle I gather you to
[2:00:23] myself and are you asking me
[2:00:27] for something to do
[2:00:43] may God help us
[2:00:59] you see I pick you up as an eagle
[2:01:02] brought you to myself
[2:01:04] God Express him his desire to the people
[2:01:08] I want to make you a family of priests
[2:01:13] a holy nation
[2:01:16] praise the Lord now if this thing was a
[2:01:19] Commandment that God was requiring them
[2:01:21] to do Peter would not say the same thing
[2:01:24] that we are a holy generation it's the
[2:01:26] same thing as the expression of God's
[2:01:28] mind God was just expressing his talk
[2:01:31] this is my thought concerning you
[2:01:36] have snatched you to draw you to myself
[2:01:39] to make you a different people from all
[2:01:42] the nations of the Earth
[2:01:46] but because of that enslaving nature
[2:01:51] they are banished that they were in
[2:01:55] they have got used to working
[2:01:58] they have to earn it
[2:02:01] oh that the Lord have spoken
[2:02:04] everything that pharah asks us we did
[2:02:09] I have a
[2:02:10] have a
[2:02:12] uh
[2:02:13] a drama version of the Bible when I'm
[2:02:16] playing that
[2:02:17] is it's beautiful
[2:02:19] oh I got the Lord has spoken we would do
[2:02:21] you can just see the arrogance
[2:02:25] that is India expression sure
[2:02:35] for the fact that they were murmuring
[2:02:37] after seeing the hands of God
[2:02:39] Exodus chapter 17 they started crying
[2:02:42] for water God told Moses I will go and
[2:02:44] stand on the rock
[2:02:46] smash the rock what shall we come out
[2:02:49] just from one thing to another God
[2:02:52] showing his provision to the people
[2:02:59] the way he's keeping us put your feet
[2:03:01] down say I'm better than that
[2:03:14] the way he's keeping us
[2:03:21] they sometimes just called a young man
[2:03:22] or called a young woman set them down
[2:03:25] and try to advise them they will
[2:03:27] misunderstand you completely you are
[2:03:30] talking to them their mind goes why
[2:03:34] they get angry they take an attitude
[2:03:40] they take a defensive attitude
[2:03:43] in a sense who are you to tell me what
[2:03:46] to do
[2:03:52] the grace of God people
[2:03:55] we don't know the grace of God
[2:03:57] especially people that have come around
