Lovell dr. arthur sheen and he found a tumor on the left ovary that I'd found 1516 years before tumor on the left ovary about the size of a walnut I said what about it doctors said let's see what happens bring her back again in a few months about two months or something we tuck her back he had grown from a walnut to about sizable lemon to better come out to get soft and turn malignant I said well my I said we're going to Tucson the Lord has sent me out to Tucson he sent her up to a female specialist he didn't want it on his hands so he must have told him about my ministry cause he don't the female specialist said we'll have to come out so he said we told me is going to Tucson he said well I've got a specialist there a dear friend of mine he used to live in Tucson he said I'm going to st. you to him so he wrote a note or sent it to him and said mr. Ames a nice lady and when all I get said senator diagram how big the tumor was and so forth it turned tumor then and said how big it was and said I know you know you know I think he thought called me a divine healer that's not what you know what I would put it but said I have agreed that it could come out if it has to be taken out take it out but it's testing our faith constantly we prayed and more we pray bigger the tumor grown cut got to a place till you're sticking out on her side we kept it quite a few of the people here knew it trying to see what would happen on and on it went finally

said I'll pray for you be merciful to her and I said help me in the meeting down there and then I kept out the Lord don't let it be malignant and let that doctor wait till after the first year to take it out I just hate to see her as the Lord she didn't mean what she did that morning she didn't mean that as a lord not one time and she ever said one word about me going in the meetings to M months or whatever it was not one time is she ever open her mouth about she's always set my clothes to the cleaners and wash my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting then she wonders how she can serve God you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course and now and then when I come in all tired and wore out people coming from everywhere I'd have quad somewhere on a fishing trip or Hunt trip while many women would have blown up at that what'd she do got my hunting clothes ready for me to go let me go I said Lord she didn't mean that now I said she's had to be cut open three times on account of she's to Syrian and I said uh lord I hate to see her have to do it again just then I heard something in the room I looked up and a boy said stand up so now whatever you say that's the way it'll be now Whigs met I said before the doctors hands shall touch her the hand of God shall take the tumor away and it won't even be found that's settled it to me I never called her we went long went got Billy Lewis when Shreveport next time I call her she's happy she's in a bit I want to tell you I hear she isn't she can verify this I had to hop her way over there went in the room with the nurse and mr. Noland put her clothes on for the gown for the examination the doctor came out and she could hardly get on the table the tumor hanging up there so big and when she the doctor come in was talking to her and he come over to Ray's back the sheet to touch her and just before he touched her it left and the doctor didn't know which side it was on he said wait a minute weather draw diagrams and all the pictures and everything else he couldn't find one trace of it examiner over and over he said I might not be able to explain it but Miss Brennan that tumor isn't there and she's never had one symptom of its center what was it notice just exactly the way it's saying before the doctors hand can touch it one split second and his hand would have touched it how perfect is the Word of God there's my wife and we're both before God but before the doctors hand could even touch her body on the road coming to her like that something happened the tumor left and they could he he said I believe it was when his sweetheart I want to reassure you miss Brennan is that right away he said it that's right that that tumor isn't there you don't have any tumor I was it just exactly according to the word of the Lord that was holy amen that's the fifth time five is a number of grace a number of FA rth - there's no more doubt in my mind I don't know what the third pull is now and what it does I be revered just keep quiet the hour or sooner I where God is going to do some great things for us now let us bow our heads for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus I'd seen it upon other people but when he come to my own precious wife it was in my home landlord I looked at it with my own eyes felt it with my own hands and I be sixteen years before that it was also Lord knowing and revealed by you when anything is spoken it must be done you were showing me Lord then that my confidence and what you're done for the people and would let me know so I could help them you brought it to pass in my own home that was the first pull and now the third pull confirmed the first pull we are thankful Father forgive us of our shortcomings we are a small people we are uneducated more or less than illiterate people but we are so thankful that we have a great omnipotent God who watches over and cares for us for we don't know how to care for ourselves we commit ourselves to you now father I pray that you'll help me and in this third poll may old Lord as you've been speaking for the last couple of years about it showing it on marking on mountains and so forth and bring it on up now I was watching to see what it was until it was completely confirmed now I pray father that you'll help me to be more revered with this than it was before and may you get glory as right over this same pulpit where the first was said the second and now the third and what you have said has come to pass exactly what you said we believe you Lord God help every one of us to throw away our disbelief and our superstitions that we might stand in the presence of the Living God knowing that the same God that took that tumor from my wife is sitting present now verified by some of the highest medical science we got in the country yes who examined it and then looked and pictured it and now it's gone your God and there's no other besides you and we love you because that you have you have let us become your servants and may we serve you with reverence and honor all the days of our life granite Lord may I be able and my family and all these people be able to be shining lights salty salt that will create a thirst and others to love this Jesus that has done so much for us now as I open the word to read it for our little cakes and then pray for the sake help me Lord speak to to us and heal the sick in Jesus name we pray amen amen would you have I got time so just first about hurry real quick own some texture I want you to read now or markdown or whatever you wish to do the first one is found in the Book of Numbers 21 5 to 19 and we want to read this and the people speak against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness or there is no bread neither is there any water and our souls Lord this light bread angels food and the large sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the Lord therefore the people came to Moses and said confession launch we have sinned that's the first thing for healing confession first we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he may take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make the fiery Serpent and set it up on a pole that it shall become come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh up on it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it up on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived now also I wish to read a scripture out of Zechariah the twelfth chapter the tenth first and I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first-born now for a text I'm going to take this look away to Jesus look away from the world to Jesus Moses made the Serpent and here the prophet later was speaking of it what would happen looking away to to Jesus the Bible said in isaiah 45:22 we find that God said look unto me all the ends of the earth and now when the Earth has come to its end or the system of the earth has come to its ends let the people look unto him now you might say we have heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time that is true has been preached for a long time many ministers has took this same text thousands of them but here is the thing I want to ask you tonight for these next few minutes but when you look the question is is what do you see when you look what do you see when you do look that only depends on what you're looking for now I said look unto me all the ends of the earth Moses lifted the serpent up never who look got healed now it depends on what you're looking for I've seen people come in to the meetings in this last day could only be able to set in the meeting for just about one or two minutes that's all they could stain hey they couldn't stand it I never forget I hope this don't reflect on any bar from Iowa when I had the meeting at Waterloo Brotherly bail he was sure this morning I don't know where he shared an honor a yearly he was sure this morning oh yes back over in a recording record all right brother Lee and I done everything we could and give the Ministerial Association of breakfast free just to come down and speak to them brother Lee bailiff course is a scholar and and a Doctor of Divinity if he really earned his degree and so I try to get him to speak before these Lutheran Presbyterians and so forth but he said no they're looking to you to do it well I went out and took my text before these ministers said that all got through Eaton I took my text I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision no more than I'd read the scripture about to look out the door they win so as I started to say as Paul in his day with an odd ministry and now he stands before grip and said that he wasn't disobedient to it about two or three morgana ever time I got to where I could say something about the text it was just about three or four set in there that all got up and gone the reason of it is is this some come to a meeting when they hear of an evangelist the way he dresses has something to do with the people if you don't wear the right kind of clothes some of them I heard a psychologist state of the day doctor narramore a fine man Christian man his programs don't care they're all dumb he said the way to tell that a man was losing his it's when he didn't dress according to his disposition you know the High has to appear before the public that was a sign that he was losing his mind well then I've been crazy all my life and hey cuz I wear overalls and everything's so fitting to my position I must dress like a clergyman in other words to be a clergyman I don't think Jesus dressed like a clergyman he dressed like an ordinary man he went in among men and was nothing dressing but that's just see how that the ideas of man it doesn't hi about if this man I wonder what the doctor think of this one a prophet in the Bible was commanded to strip off his clothes and walk naked before the people he really would be crazy wouldn't you no but God told him to do it another one had to lay on his side for three hundred and forty months I believe it was laying on his side one side then turned over the other side and eat a pot of little that he had made there to go and see this stuff and make it up together and eat it all that time to reach over get a handful and eat lay it on his son for a son hmm oh how far people can get from really a word of God they just get so educated till they educate themselves away from God when a man talks about he's got a education I know that's just how far he is from God a doctor's degree not saying this against doctor of a uncles he isn't that time but usually when a man gets a doctor's degree that just means to me is that much farther from God unless he can hold himself to the word into God now we find out that some comes to hear the way you speak when they come to look you talk about divine healing and the Lord if a man isn't typical uneducated genius that people just can't stand here and use words as he isn't hatin and words like they just they don't they think that's way away from God and when Jesus spoke sat simple language until the day it's got the professor's confused for they tried to interpret it according to the scholarships and the language of that day and it was Street language therefore while there's so much difference even here in our United States I call from Florida to New York and had to get a woman at over here to st. Louis to translate between this southern girl that northern girl that's how much difference there was me certainly now the thing of it is that people look for those same speeches and still of the word the word being manifested is the evidence that it's right I think the word being manifested they'll never look at that you've got to have an intellectual conception to know ago at the seminary and learn how to bow how to stand in one place and all that would choke a minister to death that was really filled with the Holy Spirit wow that's interesting and that's the way that this whole nation is got it's got an intellectual conception of Christ that's what they look for and if Christ is in you you've got to be a scholar you got to be an intellectual cause that's what they think Christ is and another time another thing they form their own opinions what he ought to be their own idea instead of taking what the word said that's the way when they look and even see Jesus himself they failed to recognizing they did it on the day of Pentecost they did it when he was in flesh they did it when he was in the manger they did it when he's on the streets of Jerusalem they did it when he's on the cross and he was the fulfillment of that word and yet they had the Messiah coming down on a Carter out of heaven and everything else and was wrong because it was their intellectual conception and they failed a scene and looking right at him so is it today what do you see when you look some look to see when they look at him they look to see some great intellectual Church founder somebody who can really produce a creed that will cause all the people to fall for this cream something you know that's what they look when they see some look to see a myth like Santa Claus when they look to read the Bible and say oh that's a mythical thing it's just something that man wrote that's what they call us when the what opinion you take of the Bible is what you take of him thing some look to see a baby some look and see a rabbit or Santa Claus some look to see some historical book that was yesterday enough today but the question is what do you see when you look so many of you that claimed to have the Holy Ghost look and see the second person of a Trinity when it's not even mentioned in the Bible there's no such a thing the word Trinity is not even in the ledge of the Bible but yet when you look at Jesus you regard him as the third person or the second person of a Trinity and that's the reason you go get nowhere you know what he said I am God and there's none other besides me depends on what you're looking at if you want to put some little mascot boy in an old man with beard and so forth if that's what you look at Jesus as being some different person from God you're looking wrong you don't see it here not long ago I was to hit a pair of field-glasses I was trying to watch some antelope or an antelope over in the field and my son was trying to show me he's quite a bit younger so he said take on glasses daddy there's sense antelope right out there I said I can see him with my natural eye he said take these glasses when I looked I've seen about ten antelopes but the glasses was out of focus and when I went to focus them in all ten of them become one if you focus your mind the God's Word the three will be one [Applause] but your ecclesiastical glasses get out of focus when you try to make him three he's one thing but it depends on what you're looking at what do you see when you do look remember you can only see him as you look at him through the word you can't look at it through a textbook you can't look at him through a Creed you'll see two or three gods and everything else name Creed's but look Eddy to the word and you'll see that he is Emmanuel God made flesh among us he said I'm guarding besides me there's none other he's gone I say look one time the Prophet and when he's seen Jesus my subject is looking to Jesus look away to Jesus when I say it looked away from the worldís Eve he said I see a counselor a Prince of Peace the mighty God the everlasting father that's what Isaiah looked away and saw Daniel one time we're standing when he saw the the ending of the Gentile kingdoms he saw the image that Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed he saw how each one would succeed the other as he come down and when he looked to see what it was all going to happen at the end when he saw Jesus he was a stone you dial him out without hands that crushed the Gentile kingdoms never can Izzard told three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace that believed in God and stood on his word if you had to die for it there's go to stand anyhow just a little thing of bowing there needs some other way but when he looked away and saw Jesus he was the fourth man that was in the fiery furnace and it kept all the heat off of his obedient servants that's what Nebuchadnezzar saw Ezekiel looked away to see one day and he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel we're up in the middle of the air he was a hub to the wheel where ever spoke is fastened to a man the big wheel run by faith but the little wheel turned by the power of the Lord that's ooh Ezekiel saw when he looked away John the Baptist looked away one day and when he did he saw a dove and a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in that's what he saw then he saw Jesus and God being the same person goes the spirit come down from heaven like a dove saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's what II saw notice he identifies himself in that way Noah when he looked away to see Noah saw the just judgments of God coming upon a people of this world who had rejected his word that's what Noah said when he looked away Moses when he looked away he saw a bush on fire a pillar of fire had brought itself back into a bush and when Moses dropped close to it he said take off your shoes for I am huh if you'd weigh that word I am it's past tense present tense and future tense I am eternal see I am he saw the I am that's what he saw in the burning bush Israel looked at the brass serpent that Moses made and saw the suffering of Christ for the judgment for the sink bar we know that the serpent spoke of the atonement Jesus was that atonement as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose see why they had sinned and I got sick that was for the taking away their sins and for their sickness and that's what Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed take divine healing away from Christ you cut half the atonement into what are you seeing when you look do you see that do you see that he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed when you look away can you see that or can you just see one side of the atonement can you see both sides of it when you look if you look at through the Creed they'll tell you the days of healing is past but if you look at through the word you'll see he's the same yesterday today and forever the disciples looked to him when they were in a trouble see and they saw the only help that could help him coming Martha looked to him in a time of death and she saw that he was a resurrection in the life amen in time of death Martha saw when she looked at him he had been rejected by her people you have been turned down even she had sent for him and he did not come to her brother but when finally he come and she went and fell down so she could look at him she found
