presence come down so i can see here we have a prayer request from our brother juan hernandez i want to bring that before you he's asking prayer for a neighbor friend who has spinal cord degeneration disease he's in a wheelchair now and been like that for a year today i visited with him and prayed for him i witnessed to him about christ our lord his name is tom thomas and he just quotes here he wrote down hebrews 13 and 8. you know he's the same yesterday today and forever and no matter how far gone medical science would look and see and say it's too late it's never too late with our god let's remember this neighbor of our brother juan hernandez thomas that god could still do something here if not a physical healing although he's more incapable of that maybe a spiritual healing would be far greater so let's just take him and lift him before the lord each one of you would have a need on your heart just lift your hand before the lord tonight he knows that need he can come down and meet that need for you tonight let's pray heavenly father lord we just come before you this evening just thanking you for your presence here this evening lord for we know wherever your presence is at

down and lord touch him and his where he's at right now father in his need father lord that he would know that something is moving and on the scene father lord that we hear a testimony of what you've done in his life father just lift that up before you we lift your people for each one who had a lifted hand father by a need you know what that need is father yes you meet that need here tonight father lord that you would move on the scene for your people or we ask you to bless the minister father that he'd be able to get himself out of the way and you'd be able to come and speak through him to each and every individual we pray father lord we surrender ourselves as well as the hearers father lord that you would comment to speak directly to our hearts father we'd have an open ear to hear

before we go into business tonight i see a testimony here from so let's let's just give room to that and then we will go into what we want to do tonight praise the lord josh you can come and give your testimony all right god bless you thanks [Music] you know god has really been working in my life this past month and it actually started this easter when thank you it actually started this easter when uh i believe it was brother ben that came to preach and you know i kind of came here with my cousin emmanuel and we sat down and i'm not sure if we came kind of late or during the song service or the preaching but when i started hearing it was like i was kind of getting rebuked and i know that was the spirit you know you know he just was talking about how people would come and sit down in church and be statues or you know well see the holy spirit moving and just be quiet you know love the world so much to the point where they were dressed like him and look like them you know and at first i was getting kind of mad and when he was saying that he kind of pointed at me he was like people say that hey when we point at them but who else am i supposed to point at you know i still remember that you know and i when he said that i'm like oh yeah that's god talking to me right there you know and i got kind of i got kind of humble inside and i just really listened to him you know came back sunday you know and it was a blessing after that day i just i wasn't the same i could feel it you know even though i was still hanging around the same people i just didn't feel the same you know and that sunday my god's grace is when i really gave my life to god you know when i really made the decision you know because we have to make a decision you know to actually walk and serve him and i believe that sunday is when i really made that decision to walk and serve him so i give him glory for that you know so i moved back home i had to stop hanging out with certain people it just didn't feel right no more and when i got back home my dad he told me you know you want to come work at my job in chanhassen and i'm like yeah sure he's like you don't got nothing on your record right you know i kind of went really fast i'm like no i don't you know said it real quick because i didn't want him to think anything like okay we're gonna do it then he gave me the computer everything had me signed up for it you know time goes on i'm thinking you know they ain't gonna hit me back i'm gonna just keep on working while i'm working right now i get an email saying i got an interview probably like two weeks ago i got an email saying i have an interview in two days you know so i told him he's like okay get ready call off take the day off get ready for an interview so i do that and that night before the interview i actually had a dream and i told my mother about it that i got the job at chanhassen's general mills and i told her in my dream when i got the job it was like i got i received a text or a phone call saying that i got the job and then i turned around and when i turned around my brother and somebody else was dancing like they were super happy about it you know and i told her right before i went to my interview and she was like okay you better hurry up before you miss it and then you don't get the job you know so i took my shower i get in i do an interview and two hours after the interview i receive a phone call saying that they want me to have the job praise praise the lord they say they want me to have a job and um when i turn around when i turn around there go my mom and godzilla dancing you know that is so you know that's amazing you know so time goes on and they the lady gets talking about yeah we're just gonna have to do a background check now on the drug test and you know and everything else and to be honest god works so mysteriously it's so wonderful though because that sunday when i listen to brother ben you know i used to to be honest i used to smoke i used to drink and that sunday when i listened to brother man i stopped that sunday i haven't smoked i haven't drank i haven't touched none of that you know and it just worked so good for that drug test that was coming up right here you know so i passed the drug test and now it's only yeah and then i was only the background check you know the background check is going on and then the lady calls me and she's like yeah there's something wrong with your background check we're gonna send you the paper in the mail and when you get it you should call us so i waited you know my dad's like you checked amelia i'm like no it's sunday meal don't come on sunday he's like just go check the mail i'm like mail don't come on sunday you know cause i was kind of scared and he was like you know what go tell email check the mail so i was i knew he knew that i didn't want to go check the mail you know so he said email to go check the mail and there was the paper you know i opened it and the stuff i saw i'm like if i even applied for the garbage company they wouldn't give me a job to be honest and i was looking at it i just got so discouraged i'm like yeah and i kind of put it down and daniel came with me was like you're good you're good you just gotta you gotta keep strong you got to keep your faith and i was telling him like i know i know i know but inside i was kind of i was kind of worried a little bit you know we prayed about it and my dad asked me what was on it i'm like you know just i told him one of the lesser things on there and he was like you know what when you you're okay okay well let me see it and i'm like man he wants to see it oh my goodness i didn't really want him to see it and he's like let's pray and when we're done praying you're gonna go show it to me i'm like okay so we prayed he was praying for a while i'm like okay he probably forgot so we got done praying i shake his hand i'm thinking i'm gonna walk upstairs just go to sleep he's like everything's gonna be okay everything's gonna be okay let me see it though i'm like okay so i go downstairs i grab it and to be honest i was looking at the page numbers to see if i could take one out but it was like one of two one of three you know it was all organized i couldn't take nothing out so i go and i give it to him he reads it but before he reads i'ma go go to sleep let you read it and then we talk in the morning he reads it he actually calls me back he was like you know god can do anything as long as you believe you know you just got to have faith you got to believe in him you know don't let your faith whether you know a devil he's told me like a double-minded person and is unstable in all his ways you know like and god can't use that person you know so it gave me more faith and i have a jesus calling book that i read every night before i go to sleep and i opened it you know it was may 9th that day i opened it and it said do not let your past discourage you just right there i'm like wow you know just you don't know what that did to me it just made me so happy gave me my faith right back you know had to go knocking the door this time i was disturbing my dad you know i'm

into the service tonight we just pray the lord god father you will you will just bless us all together we thank you and we appreciate you father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you tonight you may have your seed praise the lord i was i was speaking on the uh on the message on on sunday and i just took a portion of it to use for to use for our mother's day uh team we just took a portion of it to use and uh and that portion that we took out of uh what we wanted to talk about was uh and so a good praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than some sometime the preacher can do on the platform praise the lord now we we use that to be able to show uh the the virtue that god bestowed upon the woman even though we are living in an age where people think that i mean the women have have to rise to the highest of power you know and and we see the we see the saints you know we see the the cry for equality and all of that and and and they cannot be doing it in the natural uh uh if god has now already fulfilled it in the spiritual praise the lord is because god has brought his church his bride uh to that place you know where it is christ in bright form amen christ in bright form it is at a place where the bride is is is at the same place you know like brother branham shared the same spirit you know the same the same word the same anointing same flesh flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit and he said word of my word now so so we we see all of that but you know god held hear the power of the woman you know in her virtue in those three sacred vectors that god gave the woman that's where he hate her power now re recognize now that also has is comparison to the church as god gave the woman three sacred vets you he gave also to the church three sacrifices so the power of the church the power to raise the dead the power to speak to nature the power to bring our body to obedience is in those three sacrificed you the power of the woman was hid in her virtue what did the serpent attack her virtue when said when when when when when uh when the second attack her vets you then she lost her power when the devil can take prayer out of the church when the devil can take the pure word away from the church then we just left with form and formality that's right that's right we just we just make drama and just make fun and make everybody laugh and you know and tell some funny story then and and and just just amuse the people are we together so the power of the church just like the woman like i said and and and uh uh uh god had to pull the entire creation to sleep praise the lord now you see he even repeated the very thing under the covenant of redeeming israel honor the covenant of redemption when he told abraham to make a a a a covenant with him that you will have a seed it will be your seed and through sarah you will become the father when abraham was crying and abraham wanted to make eliza to be the one that will inherit his inheritance god said not not nassau is not going to be you will have a son by the matter of fact he brought abraham out in the evening time and what he did he repeated the very same thing that took place in genesis that's right at the forming of the woman he repeated because why like that's why that's why the prophet of god said in invisible union that virtue was given to her for redemption so god here repeated the very same thing when it came to the covenant of redemption he put army abraham to a deep sleep he pulled the entire creation to a deep sleep because there was darkness and it was god alone that was left to to to to uh uh drive the flowers away from the sacrifice praise the lord amen the power of the woman is in a virtue it's not in knowledge praise the lord the power of the church is in her virtue yeah praise the lord but branson is the beauty of the church is the character of the people the beauty of the church is the character of the people how the people submit themselves to the word how they respect and reference the word of god now how they ride on the word of god for their own selfish gain are we together praise the lord so we realize that the ministry of intercession is one of the greatest ministry in the church one of the greatest ministry in in in the scripture in in i mean in the bible one of the greatest ministry in the world praise the lord uh amen i'm looking for a better word to use amen now so we use their code to be able to uh uh speak on the gift of mother that was that was one of the greatest gift that god gave to the word when he gave us mothers praise the lord but there was another portion there was another quote that i read amen and [Music] that was from the mighty conqueror and brother dear brother branham says if there is any credit to be giving to the brandon family is to my wife she is the one who stands between me and the public now so uh uh uh that quote related to the scripture that we read i want us to go back to the book of numbers chapter 16. because on sunday i felt like i was caught between two tops you know i wanted to i want to go on and preach on the uh the ministry of intercession and and then i wanted to keep the thought of of the gift of motherhood praise the lord amen and to be able to show the gift of motherhood i needed to stay in in line of of trying to do my best like i did on sunday praise the lord so i won't ruin the whole thing glory be to god but we we read this scripture on sunday numbers chapter 16 and it was there from verse 44 and the lord speaks unto moses saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces that's moses and aaron and moses said unto aaron take a sensor and put a fire there in from of the altar and put on incense and go quickly onto the congregation and make an attorney for them praise the lord for there is raft gone out from the lord and the plague is begun and aaron talk as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was big was big uh the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people in his tool between the living and the dead and the plague will still praise the lord amen you will find that you will find that that became as that became a that became a statement that became a statement that brother branham use in few cases i really want to you tonight it wouldn't it would not be up there so just follow me he says i come as a priest standing between the living and the dead and i offer to you lord these prophets of this meeting tonight these ones who have come and hear the word flat hi staying preaching but the truth and they have accepted you upon the basis of your sheer blood the reconciliation the reconciliation work of the holy spirit bringing them through the blood to their savior the lord jesus christ jairus daughter brother branham said as he prayed he says he says we pray that your that your great grace will reach down and and and forgive us forgive every sin that's honored the tent tonight i prayed are standing between the living and the dead that you will forgive every trespass now so you see just like how it was in the in in the ministry of moses you know because you have to realize god called moses you know to be the prophet of the exit and uh and and and and uh because of moses uh uh uh humbleness and uh and you know like brother branham says after his experience uh with the burning bush he became one of the most meekest man and and he even started yeah he he struggled to speech to speak and and based on that god told moses to call his brother brother aaron so it was the prophet that was calling the fifo ministry because the priest in the old testament was a type of the fight for ministry and if you if you if you read the book of leviticus you will you will realize that moses had to even watch his brother aaron and his sons he has to wash them he had to anoint them he had to address them so that's the work that the prophetic ministry do told the fightful ministry and but you will see here that uh uh moses we know the first time uh uh the people rebelled against god and god got so angry you know with the people we saw that moses threw himself in the gap right praise the lord he said lord you have to kill me before you get to these people praise the lord and uh and and that was a perfect type of christ now so you can see that there is something there is something the the minister of intercession is right to the heart of god praise the lord that ministry is right to the heart of god because the bible says to wait it was god in christ reconciling the word back to himself praise the lord so it's always the ministry of jesus christ the ministry of intercession is the ministry of jesus christ we realized that back in in eden when uh uh uh when when he fell and uh we we we saw adam in uh in one sense taking the ministry of intercession why because uh paul would let us know that adam was not deceived that's right amen adam was not deceived it was the woman that was in the transgression so which means adam with an eye open he stood in the gap to be able to redeem his wife praise the lord amen he's still in a gap to redeem his wife because he knew that the lord of god was broken praise the lord amen now it was not like eve tried to to to seduce him praise the lord or he tried to convince him i i can see better than you no it was adam there was there was not much of a conversation right he knew what has happened amen you see when when when we make that wrong for conversation that's where all the reasoning power comes in he realized what has happened and he stepped right in the gap he stood between the living and the dead so we see that it's a ministry right from the heart of god if god not if god god had a plan of redemption at the back part of his mind amen amen so with that plan of redemption he had an interceding heart ignoring that for him to display his attributes that's right there will come this order there will come chaos that will come seen praise the lord so intercession is right from the heart of god are we together praise the lord now so when you take this language year where the the the the scripture says verse 48 and he stood between the living and the dead and the bible says and the plague still praise the lord when jesus was on the cross he was between the living and the dead and he said it is finished the same question was answer right just like how when aaron stood between the living and the dead the plague still when jesus said it is finished the same question was answered right praise the lord amen now so then and then and then brother brandon brings this right into the family life praise the lord he brings this right into the family life which of course the man is a type of christ and the woman is a type of the church i call into efficiency are we together praise the lord now this is not just a complimentary statement he's complimenting his wife but it's more than a complimentary statement it's a calling it's a calling i praise the lord you see that's the reason why on sunday we try to we we we made a little bit of emphasis on on the victory that is given to the church as to the woman and the purpose of it god had a purpose he had a design in his mind praise the lord are we together amen she's the one who stands between me and the public praise the lord hallelujah we can go in a way of of family life and talk on uh you know how their their the responsibility you know uh of uh of the woman or how the woman carried this out but we we kind of trying to focus merely on the church on the spiritual life i think we can learn from this i think all of our sisters must learn from this praise the lord and if you want to know how it is i mean uh it's in a way that uh you reference and appreciate your husband praise the lord amen there's a way that you reference and appreciate your husband because we have to realize that's the position of the church the church is representing christ because of the failure of the church and and the poor example of christian life that's the reason why the name of jesus is is almost like uh uh it has it has become uh you know very loyal to to the world today praise the lord it's not because of our lord is because of the church praise the lord the church that is the wife of jesus that is the bride of jesus christ that's supposed to be standing between the public and our lord she's becoming worse than the public amen she sits with the public and she laughed at her husband you know and she said things you know are that are that are complete contrary so you see you see why the word is the way it is today is because the church has lost her position right right that's right praise the lord now so as we as we as we as we go along with this we see here that uh it's a ministry that is right right at the heart of god a ministry of intercession that's the reason why the prophet prophet of god could say that a praying woman can do more on her knees than the poop there the preacher in the pulpit we know the preachers are doing a lot for the lord amen are we together tonight brother branham speaks this again year as he's praying over here in this mighty conqueror message that he preached he says in god we pray that as these handkerchiefs lay upon the bodies of sick may christ look through his own sheer blood and ah the faith that these people had and made the devil get scared and leave the people and may they pass tall the good land of health and strength as god has promised them bless these who are present here these who are sick and afflicted this wave their hands on each other i ask in their behalf as standing between the living and the dead that i challenge the devil you are nothing but a bluff satan you bluff the people but jesus christ hide the keys of the kingdom of heaven and gave them to the church he took the keys of death and health away from you he's the mighty conqueror and you are stripped of everything that you ever possess you are nothing but a bluff and we are calling your hands in in the faith and and uh the faith of our lord jesus christ the faith of the son of god praise the lord amen now so we see the other uh and as you will look every time that brother branham used this statement it was always uh uh and in most times as you you you can go and make your session on it you will see that it was always in a time of praying and it was always when he was standing for the people of god praise the lord now you think about this we have this uh uh uh uh uh situation word brother brandon master prophet and he came uh you know when and uh you know just just as a a young preacher god dealing with him and taking him through the different stages of his ministry and and also he's learning the word of god and he's even learning to understand what vision is and learning to understand what you know what what his gift is you know brother branham talks about the first time he preached and he preached the message you know talking about uh uh abraham and lots you know and then he left for his head and he cried you know and brother barum said he preached and he says he left what he said and he cried he says and i cried and he says and the people cried praise the lord then he says after the service her pastor told him and says billy that was one of the most sign preaching i've ever heard praise the lord he says he says because you know barely preaching is not appealing to the to the sympathy of the people praise the lord brother branham says jesus did not die for you to feel sorry for him so you can feel sorry that he died or because he died for me i gave my life to him that's not the reason why he died praise the lord amen he did not die for you to feel sorry for him are we together so preaching is not to appeal for your sympathy amen oh for you or for me to convince you no my work is for me to preach this word and the holy ghost do the convicting is god that do the convicting he convicts the people heart and what what what he used to convict people i don't know anything about it that's right praise the lord be to god so he said he said that was one of the most sad preaching that i've ever heard billy he says because you were just appealing to the sympathy of the people he says he said think about a lawyer go into a court to go and stand on behalf of someone that have done wrong praise the lord he has he don't go and tell the people in the court or tell the jury see this boy he's just a little boy he didn't know what he was doing you feel sorry for him can you see that he's a little boy you don't win a case like that you have to bring a convincing argument praise the lord why he's not guilty praise the lord amen the preaching of the gospel is to bring a convincing argument why your sin is forgiven [Music] yes sir amen we have the evidence here that's what the preaching of the gospel is is to bring a convincing argument that before the foundation of the word the father knew you he hired you in his plan come on come on yes sir it's not to kind of make a story to make you a church member or just a convincing story just to show that you know i uh you know what uh you know our preacher our pastor know the message the preaching of the gospel i was looking at the scripture today my goodness i remember i read it year one one either wednesday night or on a convenience service let's let's go to uh uh corinthians 15. glory be to god are we together tonight amen that's the reason why brother branham says no man has the right to preach the gospel until he has met god amen because you are going between the living and the dead amen oh praise the lord tonight are we together first corinthians chapter 15. is that what i said see what paul says here and when i read this this morning i read this early this morning i was kind of meditating praying and uh i read it i started thinking about it see what the apostle paul said verse one see moreover brethren i declared unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also you have received and we're in year 10 praise the lord amen by which also ye are saved you are saved by the gospel if you keep in memory what i preach unto you unless ye have believed in vain listen now he says for i i deliver unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sin i calling to the scripture listen carefully now and that he was buried and that he rose again the teddy a calling to the scripture that's what the gospel is praise the lord you remember jesus said it's in john chapter five sess the scripture [Music] so what paul is saying the gospel is what god has already spoken by the prophets being fulfilled amen are we together amen how jesus was born according to the scripture it has to be a calling to the scripture [Music] yes praise the lord that's what makes it the good news yes amen that whatever we are believing that we call the message we can prove it by the scripture which means god have said it amen amen god has prophesied god has spoken by the prophets of all hundred years or two thousand years ago and hear that very word being fulfilled amen he said i would call a people from the gentiles by my name so you are here tonight according to the scripture [Music] that's the gospel no coincidence amen praise the lord so you see we have a defense that's why john could say we have an advocate we have a defense we can make our argument because we have the scripture right praise the lord we have the word we can bring it back to the word the word speaks about the dead and the time that we are living in amen it speaks about the grace that will come to a people in this age he speaks uh last wednesday we were talking a little bit about uh uh death cannot change your nature and and uh you know talking about after after the you know the the the the the millennium and and all of that and i you know as i was studying on that i mean there were other things that that i was looking into i was saying to myself oh my goodness oh my goodness praise the lord amen praise the lord even the prophet of god over and over brother branham talk uh uh as in john chapter five that jesus statement says the scripture he took it he ran with it in his ministry what was he doing because everything that is was fulfilling in his ministry had to be a calling to the scripture that's right yes sir praise the lord amen now sometimes we get this thing a little bit mix-up as i was thinking about it this morning we get it a little bit mix-up brother branham said a prophet is a divine interpreter of the word amen a prophet is a divine interpreter of the scripture praise the lord on the basis of that statement many people think the message has the interpretation for the bible sure no that's not what brother branham meant a prophet is a divine interpreter of the scripture and the scripture is of nose man's interpretation right you can add to it you can subtract from it so what a prophet ministry does a prophet ministry comes and place the people rightly in the scripture it show us in the scripture our dispensation right amen it show us in the scripture the types and shadow that was speaking of our day and that's how the prophet divinely interpret the scripture he does not divinely interpret the scripture out of the scripture no he divinely interpreted scripture by taking us back to the scripture look at jesus ministry he came and he says i said it's written in the scripture read the gospel and see how many times jesus referred back to the scripture because that is the gospel what is it all about is showing that god talked about that time right he said it by a man isaiah or a man jonas or a man you know he even played in the life praise the lord he played things concerning us in the life of man that that did not even know they were fulfilling scripture or they were plain types that would be fulfilled in our day praise the lord that's why when brother branham talks about the opening of the seals and the mystery on the back of the book some people thought brother brown was going to bring something extraordinary he said no it has to be there right it has to be in a scripture so the work of a prophet is to come and take this very same scripture and open it and say this prophecy this day this scripture is fulfilled right that's the work that that is the divine interpretation work he's doing it's not interpreting something that is not in the scripture he preached what paul preached and we believe that he preached what paul preached paul says everything that i've preached all that was given to me this this um uh corinthian chapter 15 when he says the things that were given to me we know what paul was those things were given to him by divine revelation he never lend those things from uh from gamalia right those things were given to him when paul says what i have received praise the lord the lord the night that he was crucified paul was living at that time but he was not among the apostles he was not there that night when he was crucified praise the lord even all the apostles marty mcluhan even peter that the king was giving talk none of them could have bring us a teaching and order they could not bring to us what the significance of the communion they had that night the night that he was crucified paul was the only one that could teach it how did he taught it because it was revealed to him he said that wish i have received i gave unto you now you think about it a man being taught in the scripture as he was right do you think he would just take anything you think he would take anything just because peter said it or james said it oh he's the brother he's the brother of jesus so you know i believe it no that was my paul no no no no no no no that was not paul that was not paul it has to be a calling to the scriptures that's what the gospel is if it is not a calling to this scripture it's garbage it's not a gospel because it's only the spoken word only the spoken word has the power to reproduce itself i mean we can we can we can be we can be smart to connect the prophet said the prophet said so it means this this this if it is not calling to the scripture it's just it's just going to make the people laugh or happy wow wow wow it does not have the power to produce itself until it's according to the scripture praise the lord the ministry of intercession it's the ministry that has been given to us just like brother branham said if there will be any credit that will be given to christ after he died and resurrected praise the lord do you see that's the reason why throughout all the ages will be rewarded brother branham talks about that story about that evangelist after my call they had a dream when he died and got to the to the gate of heaven his name was not in the book he said no you're making a mistake he says he says i'm evangelist my call you're making a big mistake praise the lord say well you want to go and play your case he said yeah he went there and brother branham says before that great light the simplest thing was made so great that's why no man can stand justified praise the lord but the prophet of god says he feeling that condemnation in his heart and realizing there was there was every reason why his name was not in the book but there came the sweetest voice father he's two for me he's too between me and the public he's two for me on earth that's the reason that's the reason why before we go into our internal inheritance god we have to give rewards says you stood for me is too between me and the public your little christian life you live praise the lord standing between the living and the dead is a ministry right from the heart of god praise the lord the scripture says the king of sodom came and all the nations around came and fought against sodom and captured the king and lot and you know and took every one of them and the bible says and abraham heard about it praise the lord he was not a king he never had a kid um he never had an organized army all he had was just children that were born in his house that was seven praise the lord he took what he had yes sir he did he took what he had to go and rescue his brother and bring back lot and because that was right to the heart of god god came down maggie said it came down and gave him a convenient service praise the lord so you see that ev every time every time every time you pray for somebody the bible says over here in the book of john you know that he that restored a brother it's a ministry of intercession it has to be god because that's the ministry of god that's the purpose of the gospel is to reconcile people with god praise the lord like jesus said greater love have no man than for the man to lay down his life for his friend amen as a ministry of intercession and we have to be god in your heart crying out for another soul i mean where you are crying crying out lord save this person lord help this person it will have to be god because it's the ministry of intercession to wait that god was in christ reconciling the word praise the lord amen and that's the reason why you know when you get down and you just selfishly pray for somebody you know how you feel praise the lord amen you know how you feel you know you just don't feel right amen and then and and and i mean you can brag on it well i've been praying for you you know i've been praying for her you know i i do pray for her yeah yeah i do pray for her those kind of a statement people say shoving their shoulder yeah i do pray for her that's what the church is called for remember like i said the power of the church is in her venue that's the reason why when the church starts becoming wally amen start dressing like the wall and start doing like the world she robbed herself just like just like i said on sunday you see the the entertainment world they go to look for that virtue and a woman to make her a star you go and see a pretty young girl a virgin young girl very pretty and he says do you know that you can be you can be a uh you know uh you can be a mother she can be you know whatever way they call it and then they go and take her then and you know this the spray her face and paint her head and do whatever they want to do to her and set her up praise the lord and pretty soon that innocence flies away and now she thinks she's somebody she's on a magazine praise the lord then she's right in the trap of the devil and just like jesus said he comes to stay killed and destroyed he will rob her of everything her vets you her woman who her mother who rubber of everything just because of pride and because of money it ever came true the channel of reasoning but what he affected was the virtual that eve had and that's the same thing he would do when he take praying from our home and take praying from our life we are going in the rapture because we're in the message no prayer life no time with the word no intimacy with the word where you can read your bible and see it speaking back to you you can get down on your knees and speak to the father like he's right there praise the lord the devil can rob the church of dead and just give us a name in that name he knows that is a blasphemous name that is the greatest ministry praise the lord you see it is a ministry for all of god's children because it's god's ministry when he birth you by his word you start praying and reading that's what brother branham said when he was asked how can i get closer to the lord pray and read your bible every day it's a sign that you are breathed by the word the word has break you right because you are having the desire of the father you think about somebody to pray about pray for you pray for your parents you pray for your friends and that word is closing you up and and and and it's burning on your heart like jeremiah said young jeremiah the world like a fire burning in my bones you want to tell somebody about jesus praise the lord you don't feel ashamed to invite somebody to church that thing is burning in your heart you say oh god can you give me just one soul to my name someone i can encourage to the kingdom of god the ministry of intercession right from the heart of god god will give the credit to his bride when he reward her for the things i read that quote to you our time is late here and brett brown says you know media hair turning white on her head she got to deal with the children and all the guests and people all filled in the house she got to keep the children quiet she got to entertain the people when they come give them a place for their sake to sleep give them a little space for them to sleep and they have to stay there cup days to wait for brother branham to return back standing between me and the public that's why he said that's a godly wife praise the lord you know that's that's all god desired from us what he desired praise we must just praise him just praise him just worship him praise the lord that's all he desired for us praise god and see how he moved on your behalf and that's the same thing in the families in in in the family cycle when the wife can praise the husband you know he's a good man praise the lord sometimes he says well yeah i'm just telling the truth you are telling the truth but you're just out of place because where you should tell the truth is on your knees go to god and tell the truth i must tell jesus that way you should tell the truth it's not standing on the street and telling everybody where your husband is you see this man this is the way he is i'm just telling the truth i'm the truth oh you get people that were listening to you the word today will buy your story they'll put it in the magazine before you realize it will be on on news feed almighty god heart will be broken i told somebody today when god came in in eating with adam and eve he listened to adam he never told adam you are right eve is wrong god don't judge case like that right praise the lord i'll leave you as that musicians you can come i must there jesus [Music] here [Music] [Music] um [Music] jesus can help me only jesus [Music] yes i must tell jesus oh i must tell jesus lord i cannot [Music] oh i must tell jesus i must tell jesus jesus

praise the lord we just we are so grateful amen we are so grateful yes sense is just to be able to see those things that uh you know the prophet a lot of things brother branham said he said it in stories he said in statement he said it you know sometimes you don't pick up those deep things in deep things you pick up the deep things in simple things very simple things that he says right you have to know that his ministry was to bring the loose ends together that's right it was the climax the calling of the brine so his the the minister of better brand was was featuring on the brine right you know was calling the fullness of the bride and uh so i mean there are things that that are there and we can see the type the pattern in the word you know and uh i was i was i was studying something to that and and i thought i could speak on it but it's amazing you think about boaz and ruth you think about the many gentile women that we use in the scripture yes listen to this now do you know that the scripture did not recall the death of any of those gentile women the scripture not that they did not die they died but the scripture did not record it that's amazing they're deaf that's amazing let's keep there for another day oh praise the lord thank you jesus [Music] oh thank you lord thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus [Applause] when god thought about you he was thinking about the rapture he was not thinking about you going to the grave why don't you go to the grave on that but he taught about you in the rapture amen he taught about your resurrection praise the lord amen let's turn to our feet no one else [Music] let's sing that one more time down [Music] like you do i could search for [Music] thank you jesus [Music] for the last time [Music] and no one
