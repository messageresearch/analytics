[44:23] sit with our families and Lord ones and
[44:27] uh uh be grateful to the
[44:30] Lord Brother bam said is uh is uh should
[44:34] be a truth American uh holiday uh
[44:37] Christian in a sense they are the men
[44:40] used to gather and thank God for their
[44:43] Harvest thank God for their health thank
[44:46] God for their family and that's what it
[44:48] should mean to us praise the Lord amen I
[44:52] know that uh we're living in the
[44:54] society that is that that term to be
[44:58] truth but manying of what the
[45:01] society is as truth you know the
[45:04] go behind the monument and the dig the
[45:07] truth uh for the monument to be breaking
[45:09] down the go behind holidays and dig the
[45:12] truth uh so we can get rid of those
[45:14] holidays we have to know that the spirit
[45:17] that is that is driving those people is
[45:20] not a spirit of Christ praise the lord
[45:24] it's a spirit that uh that have got hold
[45:26] of this uh uh Nation uh way back uh uh
[45:29] uh in 1950s brother brandham was talking
[45:32] about how uh uh the spirit of communist
[45:35] is trying to break the American value
[45:39] and uh and and he says uh uh it's
[45:41] creeping into the schools is creeping
[45:43] into our politics and these are the
[45:45] spirits that is that is driving these
[45:47] people now men will always have to find
[45:51] their reason to fight for something so
[45:54] they might have behind civil rights they
[45:56] might hide behind Justice they might
[45:58] hide behind whatever they are hiding
[46:00] behind trying to Proclaim truth you have
[46:04] to realize that it's not the spirit of
[46:06] Christ praise the Lord because the
[46:08] spirit of Christ will first take us to
[46:10] the foot of the cross amen recognize
[46:13] that we are seen or saved by grace and
[46:16] then uh and then it would it would take
[46:18] us more closer to God it will brings it
[46:21] will bring us Christian value praise the
[46:23] Lord now what is what is the important
[46:26] of saying that uh uh uh after all
[46:29] Thanksgiving used to be where where they
[46:32] used to hang people and they used to eat
[46:34] food and and celebrate and all of that
[46:36] what is the value if we would just
[46:39] destroy you know uh uh uh the the
[46:42] principle of sitting down and saying
[46:45] thank you praise the Lord if if for the
[46:48] rest of America T giving is just to have
[46:51] a turkey on their table it must not be
[46:53] the same for you and you and I amen amen
[46:56] praise the Lord because we know it's not
[46:58] just one day every day that we live is a
[47:01] Thanksgiving to the Lord but if if that
[47:04] day is set aside it's almost like
[47:07] Christmas we know the myth that is
[47:09] around Christmas we know there is
[47:11] nothing truth about December 24th being
[47:13] the birthday of Jesus Christ it's not
[47:15] proven biblically but if the word will
[47:18] gather together and they will think that
[47:21] is a day for them to make a remembrance
[47:24] or a commemoration of Our Savior then we
[47:27] must do it better than they do it amen
[47:29] we must not get into their culture of uh
[47:33] uh meeting lighting funding party but it
[47:36] must be a day where we can say because
[47:39] he live amen we can say God send the
[47:41] greatest gift to the word praise the
[47:44] Lord they might have the date wrong we
[47:46] uh uh the date does not matter it's the
[47:48] gift that matter praise the Lord amen so
[47:52] we want to say Happy Thanksgiving to
[47:54] each and every one of you whichever way
[47:56] you choose to celebrate we pray that the
[47:59] Lord will be at your table we pray that
[48:01] he will be at your heart praise the Lord
[48:04] amen and as we go into this week uh
[48:08] there will not be service on Wednesday
[48:10] night like we normally do praise the
[48:12] Lord and uh we will have look forward to
[48:16] meet you on next Sunday but uh on Friday
[48:21] we will be having uh uh a little
[48:23] memorial for Brother Steve jamb BBE year
[48:26] uh uh the the deacons will give uh uh
[48:30] sheets out after the service this
[48:32] morning for direction for the funeral
[48:35] home time and uh and all the things but
[48:38] on uh on on Friday we we place on the
[48:42] sheet here I put a time for 6: p.m. we
[48:45] will start at 7:00 but I put 6: p.m.
[48:48] because uh uh uh the family will be
[48:52] inviting other people and uh uh we have
[48:55] a call of lateness so I just PST 6:00
[48:58] p.m. so we can be able to get people in
[49:00] the building and we'll be able to start
[49:02] on time but whether people come on night
[49:03] we're going to start 7 700 p.m. and then
[49:07] we're going to make sure that we are out
[49:08] of here before 10:00 or by 10:00 so uh
[49:13] uh and then on
[49:15] Saturday uh comes the funeral uh uh the
[49:19] address is there you can take it and
[49:21] then uh find a place somewhere there in
[49:24] Crystal Lake that's for the funeral and
[49:26] then after the family is having the
[49:29] repass and and uh uh that it called the
[49:33] celebration of life and that is
[49:35] somewhere in uh uh krai the the address
[49:39] is also there so that would be for
[49:41] Friday and Saturday there's uh uh
[49:45] brother Steven Jambi that's have us here
[49:48] as Deacon and uh uh he and brother Ben
[49:53] came to the Deacon office at the same
[49:55] same time but uh I think because of his
[49:58] age and his experience brother brother
[50:01] Ben treated him as the head deacon now
[50:04] he's gone chronologically Brother D

[1:05:37] you you may have your seat this morning
[1:05:41] uh I want to take a thought from what we
[1:05:44] read entitled what we want to speak this
[1:05:47] morning how beautiful are the
[1:05:50] feet that bringeth good tidings
[1:05:54] how beautiful are the feet that bring It
[1:05:58] Good Tidings I I mentioned that when I
[1:06:00] said are the feet something came to my
[1:06:03] mind uh uh uh that's years back I can't
[1:06:06] remember the years now but uh uh we were
[1:06:10] there uh having uh uh um a civil crisis
[1:06:16] in our country and then we have left
[1:06:18] home you know we were you know driven
[1:06:20] from our home and uh I think there
[1:06:23] should be
[1:06:25] 92 or so alus whatever it was and uh we
[1:06:30] were in the were in the set town
[1:06:34] uh and then because of what was going on
[1:06:38] uh men of great statures everybody was
[1:06:40] trying to disguise thems you know dress
[1:06:44] simple you know and dress uh uh you know
[1:06:48] the the best simplest way that they can
[1:06:51] dress uh yeah that's I remember I said
[1:06:54] that how beautiful are the feet I
[1:06:56] remember my dad and uh so I think he was
[1:07:00] wanted to go out he was trying to walk
[1:07:02] up the street so he took uh one of my
[1:07:05] sister's Sanders it was an elas elastic
[1:07:08] Sanders he took the Sanders and he wore
[1:07:11] the Sanders you know he just pulled the
[1:07:13] elastic back and he snap on his feet and
[1:07:15] he went with his with his friend in the
[1:07:17] walking up the road and um and and it
[1:07:22] was not too long and and then he was
[1:07:24] arrested by one of uh uh the malians and
[1:07:27] or Rebel of who called him and uh uh but
[1:07:32] then good enough uh one of uh the senior
[1:07:36] officer was able to identify my dad he
[1:07:38] knew him and then you know he caught up
[1:07:41] the the court so and uh but uh the boy
[1:07:44] told my father he says uh we shall know
[1:07:47] them by their
[1:07:49] feet you know because he he felt like it
[1:07:53] was strange for this for this man the
[1:07:56] way he's looking to be wearing Gil
[1:07:59] Sanders so he knew that he was trying to
[1:08:02] hide himself so when I just now when I
[1:08:05] read how beautiful are the feet it just
[1:08:07] snaap in my mind so I couldn't help but
[1:08:09] share the story with you but we're going
[1:08:11] to talk about different feet this
[1:08:12] morning
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:25] how beautiful are the feet that bringeth
[1:08:28] good tidings that's what we want to
[1:08:30] speak about morning when I was reading
[1:08:33] this actually I was I was I was studying
[1:08:36] I was listening to a commentary on
[1:08:38] Isaiah chapter
[1:08:40] 52 and as I was uh listening and and
[1:08:45] studying and uh uh I realized
[1:08:49] that uh there is not an even let me say
[1:08:53] this there is not an even that is on
[1:08:56] this earth that is not mentioned in the
[1:09:00] bible praise the Lord amen there is not
[1:09:04] an even on this earth that is not
[1:09:06] mentioned in the Holy Scripture that's
[1:09:08] the reason why we believe that this is
[1:09:10] the word of God praise the Lord it cover
[1:09:14] the day of
[1:09:15] creation amen and onto the time that God
[1:09:19] is going to work work this whole earth
[1:09:21] away not only that time it cover I will
[1:09:24] return back to the Earth to walk on the
[1:09:26] arches of the wicked it cover the
[1:09:29] Millennium the 1,000 year reign that is
[1:09:32] our future we are looking up to that
[1:09:34] amen whatever we are planning for we are
[1:09:37] planning for that 1,000 years I don't
[1:09:38] know what you planning to do but U I'm
[1:09:41] working on my
[1:09:43] plans and then it also cover after a
[1:09:46] thousand year rain with Christ a cover
[1:09:51] inity praise the Lord
[1:09:55] amen so as I was reading the the year
[1:09:59] there is something that that that caught
[1:10:01] my mind and I want to share with you uh
[1:10:06] I I will not have the time but uh if you
[1:10:11] if you look at the last verse you look
[1:10:14] at the last verse of Isaiah 52 that's
[1:10:17] verse 15 so shall he sprinkle many
[1:10:21] nations the Kings shall shut their
[1:10:24] mouths at him for that which had not
[1:10:28] been
[1:10:29] told them shall they see for that which
[1:10:33] have not been told them shall they
[1:10:37] see and that which they have not heard
[1:10:41] shall they
[1:10:43] consider now this this is a this is a
[1:10:46] prophecy and then that goes right into
[1:10:49] Isaiah chapter
[1:10:51] 53 now in the in the new New Testament
[1:10:55] Church or the beginning of the New
[1:10:57] Testament Church there is an event of
[1:11:00] Isaiah 53 that have to do with the
[1:11:03] Ethiopian
[1:11:05] unic now if you read Isaiah
[1:11:09] 52 carefully and with lot of prayers you
[1:11:13] will see that the prophet Isaiah
[1:11:17] prophesy of Acts chapter
[1:11:22] 8
[1:11:24] praise the Lord because it was Isaiah
[1:11:28] 53 the Ethiopian Uno was
[1:11:33] reading when Phillip was drawned to his
[1:11:37] chub are we together
[1:11:41] amen and uh uh
[1:11:45] uh but it it would take us a whole lot
[1:11:48] of uh Bible studies this
[1:11:51] morning it will take us a whole a whole
[1:11:53] lot of a Bible study but think about
[1:11:55] this look at verse 12 for for ye shall
[1:11:58] go not out with his none go by
[1:12:02] flight for the Lord will go before you
[1:12:06] and the god of Israel will be your re
[1:12:10] reward Philip joined that man from a
[1:12:15] Revival he never went by haste he never
[1:12:18] went by
[1:12:21] flight but God took him from Samra
[1:12:24] Revival and throw him on the
[1:12:28] desert praise the
[1:12:30] Lord man uh I mean uh it blew my mind
[1:12:34] some of the things I were looking at it
[1:12:37] blew my mind but we that's not way we we
[1:12:39] want to go into this uh this morning we
[1:12:42] can do it another time if the Lord will
[1:12:44] give us but we want to look at how
[1:12:47] beautiful at the feet of them that bring
[1:12:49] good Tiding now the thought really hait

[1:14:36] love uh we don't know him we love him we
[1:14:38] appreciate him and uh uh for his uh his
[1:14:43] uh his St in the word amen for his St in
[1:14:47] the word so we had a good Fellowship but
[1:14:49] while we were fellowshipping together
[1:14:51] spending time together the thought his
[1:14:53] mean you know how beautiful are the feet
[1:14:57] that brings Good
[1:14:58] Tidings so then I went to start uh uh
[1:15:02] looking at it and uh that was what put
[1:15:05] put me into Isaiah chapter 52 and uh and
[1:15:08] I want to share some of uh uh uh that
[1:15:12] with you this morning praise the Lord I
[1:15:16] also had a had a time that I believe
[1:15:19] that was that was designed by the Lord
[1:15:21] we went out and then while we were
[1:15:23] coming I thought okay I would just we
[1:15:25] just go somewhere and then I will try to
[1:15:28] get some few things for him and then we
[1:15:31] went and then uh uh you know uh uh
[1:15:36] I just try to get some on the shirt for
[1:15:39] him and and then I just saw him as his
[1:15:42] as as his uh I said pastor Martin said
[1:15:45] you know what if if there's something
[1:15:46] you want take it and that thing almost
[1:15:50] broke the old man down because he
[1:15:52] remember his son
[1:15:53] son you know we came home no Sunday
[1:15:57] morning when we were driving to church
[1:15:59] we that happened on Saturday and then
[1:16:01] Sunday when we were coming to church and
[1:16:03] we were talking on something and then he
[1:16:05] said he says brother
[1:16:07] one what you did
[1:16:10] yesterday he says you never know what
[1:16:12] that means to me and I mean he started
[1:16:15] crying I was just I was just overwhelm
[1:16:19] so it was a good time for me praise the
[1:16:22] Lord enjoy the preaching if you did
[1:16:24] enjoy it but I enjoy the
[1:16:28] fellowship and uh uh but how
[1:16:35] beautiful are the feet that brings Good
[1:16:40] Tidings in Matthew in uh St John Chapter
[1:16:45] 13
[1:16:47] Jesus at the end of his
[1:16:50] ministry he introduced to the church one
[1:16:55] of the greatest event that took place in
[1:16:59] history praise the
[1:17:01] Lord now that I said this I
[1:17:05] remember uh uh December 31st will turn
[1:17:10] out to be on the
[1:17:12] Sunday so we will see what the weather
[1:17:15] will bring for us but I'm hoping that we
[1:17:19] will have a morning service and I want
[1:17:21] us to have a communion service in the
[1:17:24] evening we might not stay late after the
[1:17:28] the whole uh uh December 31st Church
[1:17:32] tradition to stay until the next morning
[1:17:35] if we will have two services that day we
[1:17:37] might not stay uh uh late till the next
[1:17:41] morning uh because uh uh uh if we if I
[1:17:45] have to preach in the morning and then
[1:17:46] stay till the next day and uh uh uh it
[1:17:50] tells on my body praise the Lord so uh
[1:17:53] let's just pray that's that's what I'm
[1:17:55] having on my heart that uh uh if if the
[1:17:59] weather don't turn out to be rough if
[1:18:01] the weather turned out to be rough we
[1:18:03] will cancel the morning service and then
[1:18:06] we will come sometime in the afternoon
[1:18:09] and then we just go on with the service
[1:18:11] but I will wish that we'll have a time
[1:18:14] of communion and have a time of foot
[1:18:16] washing because I'm about to talk about
[1:18:18] foot washing that was one of the
[1:18:20] greatest evening that Jesus introduced
[1:18:24] to the New Testament Church if you look
[1:18:27] in the Bible the first time the Bible
[1:18:29] will speak about a feet being watch was
[1:18:32] Genesis
[1:18:33] 18 when when when Elohim came to visit
[1:18:38] Abraham praise the Lord concerning the
[1:18:41] promised
[1:18:42] son when Elohim came down Abraham
[1:18:48] said let me uh he says let a little
[1:18:51] water I prayed you be Fetch and wash
[1:18:55] your
[1:18:56] feet and rest yourself under the tree he
[1:19:00] was talking to the
[1:19:01] angel that have come uh uh to visit
[1:19:05] him the second time the the scripture
[1:19:09] will talk about that it was when the two
[1:19:11] angels went to meet lot in Genesis
[1:19:15] chapter 19 lot said the same
[1:19:18] thing he says uh uh I prayed
[1:19:27] you I prayed you into your servant's
[1:19:30] house and TI all night and I'll wash
[1:19:32] your feet and you shall rise up early
[1:19:36] and go your way praise the Lord
[1:19:42] amen the next time the the scripture we
[1:19:44] talk about uh uh the washing of feet was
[1:19:49] uh uh the marriage of Isaac
[1:19:53] and Rebecca when Ela went to
[1:19:57] Rebecca parents to go and
[1:20:00] engage Rebecca for Isaac that the next
[1:20:04] time that the Bible will talk about feet
[1:20:07] watching it have now started becoming uh
[1:20:10] uh a tradition is now started becoming a
[1:20:13] custom among them that uh they will wash
[1:20:16] the feet of their guest the next time
[1:20:19] the Bible will address there will be
[1:20:21] when Joseph Brothers came to Egypt and
[1:20:26] Joseph sent the Egyptians to bring his
[1:20:28] brother into the palace he instructed
[1:20:32] them to wash their
[1:20:35] feet praise the Lord
[1:20:38] amen are we together praise the
[1:20:43] Lord and uh then we we see over in
[1:20:50] exodor feet took a different path and
[1:20:54] and it represented Redemption when God
[1:20:58] came down uh uh in Exodus chapter
[1:21:04] 3 he spoke to Moses he said draw not
[1:21:07] night hether put off thy shoes from off
[1:21:11] thy feet for the place where On th
[1:21:16] standed is a Holy Ground you know like I
[1:21:19] said the last time sometimes you just
[1:21:21] take the the concordance in your Bible
[1:21:24] or on your Bible app just put in the
[1:21:27] word go through the scripture and see uh
[1:21:30] you know well it will just blow your
[1:21:32] mind it will just blow your mind because
[1:21:34] it comes out in different way the next
[1:21:37] time will be when
[1:21:39] Zapora circumcised her son and took the
[1:21:42] forse skin and threw it at the feet of
[1:21:46] Moses a sign of the
[1:21:51] cross praise praise the
[1:21:53] Lorden and she said what a bloody
[1:21:56] husband thou are to
[1:22:00] me how
[1:22:02] beautiful are the
[1:22:04] feet that bringeth good
[1:22:08] tidings I don't know what's the size of
[1:22:10] your feet but I'm going to talk about
[1:22:12] your feet this
[1:22:15] morning amen praise the Lord amen your
[1:22:19] feet might not be beautiful pray maybe
[1:22:21] you didn't do cutting of the nails or
[1:22:24] the you know all the special things you
[1:22:26] do on your feet but how beautiful are
[1:22:30] the feet of them that bring Good
[1:22:32] Tidings praise the Lord are we together
[1:22:42] amen so it's a it's uh it's uh
[1:22:50] uh it's a great event you remember in
[1:22:54] Matthew chap 13: 7 Jesus told the
[1:22:59] disciples he said what I do unto you now
[1:23:02] ye know that but ye shall know
[1:23:07] after the Bible says after supper he
[1:23:09] took a towel and he tired it around
[1:23:12] himself he took a basin and he put water
[1:23:15] in it and uh and and and then he got
[1:23:17] down to the disciples he started washing
[1:23:19] their feet and weing it and and uh uh
[1:23:22] and he get a Peter Peter said no don't
[1:23:24] don't don't watch me was my whole body
[1:23:27] now Peter said watch my whole body
[1:23:30] because Peter was speaking about a
[1:23:32] Leviticus order because that's how the
[1:23:36] priest was introduced into the levitical
[1:23:38] priesthood they will first be watched
[1:23:41] Moses had to was them he would take a
[1:23:44] basing a very big top like the one we
[1:23:46] can do baptism in or maybe bigger than
[1:23:49] that and then he will pour water in it
[1:23:51] he will wash them from head to their
[1:23:54] feet and then uh uh before the
[1:23:56] congregation and they will come out of
[1:23:58] the water to go in there and change and
[1:24:00] then he will go uh uh uh uh uh and dress
[1:24:04] them in their in their Priestly Rob and
[1:24:07] he will bring them before the
[1:24:09] congregation and he will anoint them God
[1:24:12] was setting an order where uh uh uh it
[1:24:15] will have to take a prophetic Ministry
[1:24:18] to be able to bring a man into the pries
[1:24:22] to which is the fful ministry amen
[1:24:25] praise the Lord that's the reason why if
[1:24:28] a man will be uh uh h a successful fful
[1:24:32] Minister under the order of God for the
[1:24:35] New Testament he have to sit down and be
[1:24:39] watched God did it to Paul God had to
[1:24:42] watch Paul from all his tradition from
[1:24:44] all his Pharisees IDE did Tak him at the
[1:24:47] backside of the desert of Arabia for
[1:24:49] three
[1:24:51] years praise the Lord
[1:24:54] amen so that's what Peter was thinking
[1:24:56] about he was thinking about the
[1:24:58] Leviticus order I need to be watched
[1:25:01] Jesus said no he that is watch is watch
[1:25:04] Once amen now you will have to realize
[1:25:07] that under the Leviticus order when the
[1:25:10] priest is watched complete body he's
[1:25:13] watched once but every time of the
[1:25:16] sacrifice there was the lava sir before
[1:25:19] the brazing altar yes sir so before he
[1:25:22] goes to the sacrifice he will have to
[1:25:24] wash his hands and wash his feet it was
[1:25:27] something that they did every time
[1:25:30] praise the Lord so you see that's what
[1:25:33] we do when we come to the house of the
[1:25:36] Lord every service we come for a feet
[1:25:41] washing praise the Lord because we are
[1:25:44] we come to be reminded how to walk
[1:25:48] before the Lord how to walk with one
[1:25:51] another
[1:25:55] yeah are we
[1:25:59] together so Jesus said in St John
[1:26:04] chapter 13 verse 7 he said what I do
[1:26:08] unto you you know that but you will know
[1:26:11] here
[1:26:12] after here after you will know
[1:26:15] that and Paul will take that in Ephesian
[1:26:19] chapter
[1:26:20] 5 he will take there in Ephesians
[1:26:23] chapter 5 let's read it
[1:26:25] together because we're traveling now
[1:26:29] amen we're traveling now we want to see
[1:26:31] how beautiful our feet are praise the
[1:26:35] lord we spend a lot of time making our
[1:26:38] head and we don't know our will feet it
[1:26:39] are
[1:26:40] beautiful praise the
[1:26:43] Lord
[1:26:45] amen while you looking at your head God
[1:26:48] is looking at your
[1:26:51] feet
[1:26:55] are we together Ephesians chapter
[1:27:05] 5 love the
[1:27:07] Lord praise the Lord what a wonderful
[1:27:11] Jesus we Ser
[1:27:14] amen oh I love the
[1:27:16] Lord he's so good amen let's look at
[1:27:20] verse 24
[1:27:23] in Ephesians chapter 5 now in Ephesians
[1:27:26] chapter 5 Paul speaking there before he
[1:27:29] gets to verse 24 and he's talking all of
[1:27:32] these things about uh uh uh you know uh
[1:27:36] uh he gets down and and talk about uh
[1:27:40] wife submit yourself to your husband and
[1:27:43] you know husband love your wife and then
[1:27:45] I mean we can get in there and then we
[1:27:47] become so personal but Paul is going to
[1:27:51] make us to understand Jesus said you
[1:27:53] will know
[1:27:56] Hereafter Paul being the prophet
[1:27:59] Messenger to the New Testament
[1:28:02] Church is now going to bring an
[1:28:05] interpretation to what Jesus said you
[1:28:09] will know
[1:28:12] herea are we together amen amen because
[1:28:16] that's what a prophet is he's a Divine
[1:28:18] interpreter of the
[1:28:21] word glory be to
[1:28:24] God now so Paul here teaching the
[1:28:28] Ephesian
[1:28:31] church he he says
[1:28:38] this and
[1:28:44] uh it talks about the wife and husband
[1:28:47] and all of that you can go and read it
[1:28:49] and then you fuss with yourself but
[1:28:51] that's fine
[1:28:53] verse
[1:28:56] 24 he said therefore as the church is
[1:29:01] subject to
[1:29:04] Christ now he's bringing it from the
[1:29:06] natural to the spiritual to be able to
[1:29:09] give us an idea but sometimes we get so
[1:29:12] stuck in the
[1:29:15] natural as soon as we start to say that
[1:29:18] and and and sometimes it's easy for us
[1:29:20] to start putting up a spirit of
[1:29:23] resentment and you won't get the
[1:29:24] blessing because he's driving to
[1:29:27] something praise the Lord amen he's just
[1:29:31] giving us a picture he says therefore as
[1:29:34] the church is subject to Christ so let
[1:29:37] the wife be to their own husband in
[1:29:40] everything husband love your wife even
[1:29:43] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:29:46] himself for it that he might
[1:29:50] sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:29:55] watching of Water by the word this is
[1:30:00] what Jesus said you will know
[1:30:03] Hereafter what I do unto you
[1:30:06] now he says you don't know but year
[1:30:10] after when the Holy Ghost will
[1:30:14] come every time you come to church I
[1:30:18] will be watching
[1:30:20] you amen
[1:30:22] amen every time you will have the
[1:30:25] watching of the Water by the
[1:30:29] word and that's what we come to church
[1:30:32] for yes Lord amen praise the Lord amen
[1:30:36] hallelujah amen amen
[1:30:40] amen and if you
[1:30:43] remember Jesus
[1:30:48] before his
[1:30:50] uh his crucification that will be in uh
[1:30:54] uh
[1:30:56] uh St John chapter 12 but Jesus stood
[1:31:02] there over in Matthew you remember
[1:31:05] Matthew 26 you remember when uh when
[1:31:08] when when Mary brought that Alabaster
[1:31:10] bus and and and you know she she she
[1:31:13] washed the Lord Jesus feet with her
[1:31:15] tears and and she break the box and and
[1:31:18] anointed him and and he made this
[1:31:21] statement he said wherever the gospel
[1:31:24] will be preached this is done unto my
[1:31:29] Memorial praise the
[1:31:32] Lord
[1:31:35] amen whever the gospel will be preach
[1:31:37] you just think about
[1:31:39] that M Mar Anointed The Lord after
[1:31:43] watching his Fe anointed him even before
[1:31:47] he came and did this in in in St John
[1:31:50] Chapter 13 to the disciples
[1:31:54] praise the
[1:31:56] Lord you see how how how powerful God is
[1:32:00] in his
[1:32:01] design you realize that if you are
[1:32:04] familiar with some of those things
[1:32:06] around the seals even before the seals
[1:32:08] were
[1:32:10] open there were people that that God
[1:32:12] gave dream and and and and even uh uh uh
[1:32:16] uh oh what what's the sister name she
[1:32:19] had a dream and and and and all of that
[1:32:22] was leading to the opening of the seals
[1:32:24] right all of that helped brother
[1:32:27] brandham to realize that uh this is what
[1:32:30] is
[1:32:32] happening all of those
[1:32:35] dreams brought him to the realization
[1:32:38] that this is what is
[1:32:41] happening that this woman will come and
[1:32:44] then uh get down on her knees and and
[1:32:47] and and weep and wash the feet of our
[1:32:50] Lord Jesus use her head and and wept his
[1:32:53] feet and and anoint
[1:32:56] him uh uh with with this costly
[1:33:00] oil and he would
[1:33:05] remember that now as the sacrifice of
[1:33:07] the word I'm I'm I'm now preserved as a
[1:33:10] priest I'm now being watched and now
[1:33:12] being anointed I can now go and step
[1:33:14] into that office to offer the
[1:33:18] sacrifice of the
[1:33:20] word
[1:33:22] praise the Lord when all the clergy and
[1:33:26] and and and and Pharisees priests they
[1:33:28] were all
[1:33:31] there but yet a woman got him ready for
[1:33:36] the
[1:33:40] job a woman got him ready for the
[1:33:47] job it's one of the greatest
[1:33:50] events
[1:33:52] church and that's why we are here let me
[1:33:55] read this to
[1:33:57] you the report reproach for the ca of
[1:34:01] the word I put this year to to kind of
[1:34:05] read it as an introduction of what I
[1:34:08] want to speak this
[1:34:09] morning because I want to I want to stay
[1:34:13] do my best to stay the uh in line now
[1:34:17] with what I want to stay with my
[1:34:19] inspiration I get not to get too SASS
[1:34:22] and running all over the place God has a
[1:34:26] time and a
[1:34:29] reason for that time to fulfill his
[1:34:33] word God know just exactly what he's
[1:34:36] doing what he's going to do
[1:34:39] sorry we
[1:34:41] done he he just have to receive it as he
[1:34:46] gave it to us we just have to receive it
[1:34:49] as he gave it to us he knows and there
[1:34:52] is nothing going to go wrong with what
[1:34:58] he has planned to do praise the
[1:35:02] Lord that's the reason why God do not
[1:35:07] worry
[1:35:09] amen God do not
[1:35:11] worry there is one thing that God can do
[1:35:15] he cannot do he can
[1:35:19] learn God cannot learn
[1:35:25] no because he knows everything he knows
[1:35:29] the end from the beginning amen praise
[1:35:32] the
[1:35:35] Lord nothing going to go
[1:35:38] wrong with what God has planned to
[1:35:43] do even with the
[1:35:45] word with what everything that is
[1:35:48] happening and everything that is going
[1:35:50] on nothing is going going to go wrong
[1:35:53] God is in control
[1:35:55] amen praise the Lord because God has a
[1:35:59] purpose for everything that he's
[1:36:02] doing Hallelujah am we can rest assur on
[1:36:06] that there has to be
[1:36:10] something rocket and high things to only
[1:36:14] bring out the real truth nature of the
[1:36:17] object you know rain is born in the r uh
[1:36:22] red lightning and tunder skies and if we
[1:36:26] didn't have rain we wouldn't have life
[1:36:29] but you see what it takes to bring rain
[1:36:31] thunder lightning flashing like anger
[1:36:36] and out of there comes rain a sea Must
[1:36:39] Die Rod
[1:36:41] corrupt smell and go back to the dust of
[1:36:44] the Earth in order to bring for New
[1:36:47] Life it takes the pounding of God
[1:36:51] turning over and over back and forth and
[1:36:55] pounding until all the drust is taken
[1:36:59] out of eight praise the Lord think about
[1:37:03] that that is just nature but think about
[1:37:08] yourself because just the way that God
[1:37:11] deals with nature that's the way he's
[1:37:12] dealing with every one of
[1:37:15] us for him to be able to bring his
[1:37:19] purpose out of your life he got to turn
[1:37:22] you around he got to put you back on the
[1:37:25] wheels he got to cause this to happen
[1:37:28] and cause that to happen just to be able
[1:37:31] to get he's he the one that made us
[1:37:37] amen praise the Lord amen the sooner we
[1:37:41] come to that realization the easy life
[1:37:44] will become for
[1:37:50] us
[1:37:53] you don't have a
[1:37:54] choice you didn't choose your
[1:37:58] birthday praise the Lord you can't
[1:38:01] choose the day you will die
[1:38:06] either you
[1:38:08] can
[1:38:09] until his purpose is done you're not
[1:38:14] going

[1:39:19] together you see them out
[1:39:22] to one side you can hardly tell them
[1:39:24] apart but P them together you can tell
[1:39:27] it and the be the be always has to be
[1:39:32] till he sees or the beater sorry has to
[1:39:36] beat till he see his own image
[1:39:37] reflecting in the God and God set a time
[1:39:41] and has a purpose for everything he does
[1:39:45] there is nothing happened just
[1:39:48] accidentally to those who love of the
[1:39:51] Lord and Accord according to his purose
[1:39:54] see we are predestinated and everything
[1:39:57] work just right for that because he

[1:40:38] that he was behind it praise the Lord
[1:40:41] before you even start the
[1:40:44] journey he knew he was behind every
[1:40:47] move and sometimes you think that
[1:40:51] everything is going
[1:40:53] wrong it's up to us that's how we think
[1:40:56] those things are put upon us triers and
[1:40:59] wondering is testing to see how we will
[1:41:03] react to an action and remember the
[1:41:07] reproach of the word the word has always
[1:41:10] bought a reproach All Through the Ages
[1:41:13] God anointed word has always been
[1:41:17] reproached and that's the reason it's so
[1:41:21] are for people who doesn't
[1:41:25] understand who know how to accept that
[1:41:28] reproach because I mean that's that's
[1:41:31] the way the the the sa Church the word
[1:41:33] says it I mean you serving God
[1:41:35] everything must be
[1:41:36] easy and now I'm serving God why why

[1:42:21] that this one that have been reproached
[1:42:24] All Through the Ages has always come as
[1:42:28] Victorious if you would just remind
[1:42:31] yourself there and tell yourself pretty
[1:42:34] soon we will turn the
[1:42:39] corner can you
[1:42:44] remember the disciples returning back

[1:46:51] we will be able to see and appreciate
[1:46:54] what we are called
[1:46:56] to what we are called to praise the Lord
[1:47:01] let me tell you we are not making a
[1:47:04] church we are not coming together to
[1:47:06] make a
[1:47:11] church the church of the Lord is never
[1:47:13] made by
[1:47:18] men Jesus said I will build my
[1:47:22] church and the gats of Hell shall not
[1:47:25] Prevail against it am praise the Lord

[1:47:37] make us happy no no no it's it's God
[1:47:40] that have called
[1:47:43] us praise the Lord he has called us
[1:47:46] together and there's no way you can get
[1:47:48] away from it try
[1:47:51] it I challenge you to try it now so when
[1:47:56] you look through the scripture you will
[1:47:58] see all of these different example that
[1:48:01] I gave of of God allowing this thing to
[1:48:05] happen yeah those angels came down to
[1:48:07] Abraham there and he choose to wash
[1:48:10] their feet and make them to feel welcome
[1:48:13] it became an eting cultured and and you
[1:48:15] know what and we we know about the foot
[1:48:17] wash flunky you know and and and all of
[1:48:20] that you know where they they come to
[1:48:22] the house and they have a Bott bucket or
[1:48:25] the tub there where you wash your feet
[1:48:27] and then you go in in the house and all
[1:48:29] of that but you will see that uh God
[1:48:33] kind of introduced that and here is said
[1:48:36] that uh uh the scripture that will
[1:48:39] introduce the Messiah Jesus Christ the
[1:48:42] greatest sacrifice of the word the the
[1:48:45] the Jews in the Torah called Isaiah 53
[1:48:48] as the Hest the the holiest of holy of
[1:48:51] the scripture that's how they they term
[1:48:53] it that is the holiest of of holy of the
[1:48:57] entire scripture Isaiah chapter 53 and
[1:49:01] here is the prophet
[1:49:03] introducing the suffering
[1:49:06] seven praise the Lord he's introducing
[1:49:11] God becoming flesh to take upon
[1:49:15] himself the sin of the word he will be
[1:49:18] rejected by his own people
[1:49:20] but it will it will still not bother him
[1:49:24] praise the Lord and yet the prophet is
[1:49:27] introducing it as how
[1:49:29] beautiful are the feet that bringeth
[1:49:33] good
[1:49:35] tidings praise the
[1:49:39] Lord how
[1:49:41] beautiful are the feet that sound that
[1:49:47] salvation are we together praise the
[1:49:51] Lord now as I was looking at that I
[1:49:55] started to look at uh
[1:49:59] uh we know that over in in uh uh in
[1:50:04] Joshua ver make us to understand that
[1:50:07] firststep mean possession praise the
[1:50:11] Lord and then when I was looking at it
[1:50:13] in uh uh it also bring that out that
[1:50:17] four step is is uh uh
[1:50:20] possession but it also had a uh uh
[1:50:25] another
[1:50:27] uh
[1:50:29] definitions I want for us to look at it
[1:50:31] a little bit here this uh this morning
[1:50:34] praise the Lord are we
[1:50:36] together
[1:50:38] amen now
[1:50:40] so and you see that all through the
[1:50:44] scripture you see that and and and uh
[1:50:47] many times the the the message
[1:50:52] messenger that brings the message right
[1:50:55] from Eden the Bible says that uh uh uh
[1:51:01] the voice of God was walking in the
[1:51:05] garden calling out Adam Adam where are
[1:51:08] you the Bible mentioned walking and that
[1:51:13] will give us an idea that God was
[1:51:16] bringing that message on
[1:51:18] feet
[1:51:21] amen if the voice of God was walking he
[1:51:25] was bringing that message on
[1:51:27] feet how
[1:51:29] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:51:33] bring It Good
[1:51:39] Tidings when in a strong concordance
[1:51:42] when you look at feet it says as used in
[1:51:45] Walking By by implication of
[1:51:48] steps
[1:51:50] it speaks of being able to
[1:51:55] endure praise the Lord you hear the word
[1:51:59] that says stay like a
[1:52:04] man Faith speaks of being able to
[1:52:08] endure according as coming is also speak
[1:52:12] as
[1:52:13] following the great told jinning it
[1:52:16] speaks of
[1:52:18] possession and time
[1:52:21] how beautiful are the faith that brings
[1:52:24] good
[1:52:25] Tiding praise the Lord to realize that
[1:52:30] this is not only speaking about the
[1:52:33] mesiah is not only speaking about the
[1:52:36] preachers in Romans chapter chapter 10
[1:52:39] let's turn to Romans chapter 10 Paul
[1:52:42] used that
[1:52:44] also in Romans chapter 10 he referred to
[1:52:48] this very scripture
[1:52:50] that we are talking
[1:52:53] about you will see how he he plac it
[1:53:05] there Romans chapter 10 let's read from
[1:53:07] verse
[1:53:14] 13 for whosoever shall call upon the
[1:53:16] name of the Lord shall be saved how then
[1:53:20] shall they call upon Him whom they have
[1:53:23] not
[1:53:24] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:53:27] him of whom they have not
[1:53:29] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:53:33] preacher yes sir and how shall they
[1:53:36] preach except they be sent right as it
[1:53:40] is written how
[1:53:42] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:53:46] preach the
[1:53:47] gospel praise the Lord now you see Paul
[1:53:51] after the crucification he's bringing
[1:53:53] that very prophecy in a different
[1:53:58] way making us to realize that when God
[1:54:03] call us and he choose us it's for a
[1:54:05] purpose it's not just to come and warm
[1:54:07] the bench it's not just to you know uh
[1:54:10] uh H uh feel indifferent God do not have
[1:54:14] no less part of his body God do not have
[1:54:17] no useless part of his body every part
[1:54:20] of God's body is important that Paul
[1:54:23] will say even the ones that causing
[1:54:26] trouble he says they are
[1:54:29] necessary that's what he said in the
[1:54:31] book of Corinthians even the ones that
[1:54:33] are the Troublemaker they are
[1:54:43] necessary are we

[2:13:37] reason he gave it to us for a
[2:13:42] reason that is the reason why we come
[2:13:45] into death by water baptism
[2:13:49] only them that are baptized in the name
[2:13:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ are introduced
[2:13:55] into that

[2:16:06] by it praise the Lord sometimes we take
[2:16:11] coming to church just as a
[2:16:14] duty but it's more than
[2:16:16] there
[2:16:18] praise the
[2:16:19] lord it's more than
[2:16:24] that knowing that we coming for one
[2:16:28] reason we're coming
[2:16:31] to to fellowship and meet with our
[2:16:36] maker praise the
[2:16:39] Lord

[2:16:55] fulfilling all of that I think you know
[2:16:58] I'm I'm I'm in good
[2:17:02] standing but yet there is more to
[2:17:06] do praise the Lord there is more to
[2:17:10] do and there is lot that you can do
[2:17:13] behind the
[2:17:16] scenes
[2:17:18] there is lot that you can do behind the
[2:17:28] scenes for sure we come here we meet
[2:17:31] here Wednesday night Sunday
[2:17:34] morning I know for the fact there are
[2:17:37] people that
[2:17:39] comes and try to get the building
[2:17:44] ready after the while we we being a time
[2:17:48] where we went back and forth and we put
[2:17:50] schedule up and we you know we contact
[2:17:54] people But as God sometimes we
[2:17:57] work you know men order and Men
[2:18:01] strive we try to get ourself into it
[2:18:05] sometimes God don't use those
[2:18:09] things you come
[2:18:11] around and he will put burdens on people
[2:18:16] heart
[2:18:18] praise the
[2:18:28] Lord Sometimes some of the the the the
[2:18:33] the the scenes that do the sounds and
[2:18:37] things they come early before
[2:18:42] 10:00 because I was scheduled say 10:00
[2:18:45] that that uh uh uh uh life thing is
[2:18:50] going to go
[2:18:51] life they try to be here before that
[2:18:54] time run through here I was here the
[2:18:57] other day and seeing one of the sisters
[2:19:00] doing there running through making sure
[2:19:02] that everything is connected and all of
[2:19:06] that praise the
[2:19:10] Lord how beautiful their feet bringing
[2:19:13] Good Tidings
[2:19:16] amen
[2:19:19] and all of the different things and even
[2:19:21] the things we do when we are not in
[2:19:29] church we have to realize
[2:19:33] that that
[2:19:38] commandment when the scripture says Thou
[2:19:40] sht not take the name of the Lord thy
[2:19:44] God in vain
[2:19:51] thou sht not take the name of the Lord
[2:19:54] thy God in
[2:19:56] vain and when you say you are a
[2:20:01] Christian you are taking the name of the
[2:20:07] lord it's not just what you
[2:20:10] say it's not just
[2:20:12] swearing that is
[2:20:16] ambassadorship that you will be joined
[2:20:19] to the name of Jesus
[2:20:23] Christ and we will take his name to
[2:20:26] places that we go things that we
[2:20:30] say things that we talk
[2:20:33] about he promised I will not leave
[2:20:37] you he said I will not leave you you
[2:20:41] just got a partner that tell you say I
[2:20:43] will not leave
[2:20:44] you where you going he say I will go
[2:20:47] there with with
[2:20:53] you I mean that's why we will not go to
[2:20:55] the club because we can't take Jesus to
[2:20:57] the
[2:20:58] club he said I will not leave
[2:21:01] you well sometimes we take him to places
[2:21:05] he still right at the door and wait for
[2:21:06] you to go have your
[2:21:08] fun and then as soon as you get back
[2:21:11] then he start dealing with your
[2:21:14] conscience say you just left me outside
[2:21:19] I told you that I will not leave you I
[2:21:21] will not forsake
[2:21:23] you Jesus never forsake right he never
[2:21:35] forsake his
[2:21:38] ambassadorship is not just misusing the
[2:21:40] name of
[2:21:42] God for all them that call on the name
[2:21:45] of Jesus all them that I have taken on
[2:21:48] his name that's what the Apostle Paul
[2:21:55] says when you take on his name as a Son
[2:21:59] of God as a daughter of
[2:22:01] God and your feet become
[2:22:06] beautiful why because he expects you by
[2:22:10] your manner of Life your
[2:22:13] conversation to bring good Tiding you
[2:22:16] are now on a
[2:22:18] mission you have become a Good News
[2:22:21] Messenger not a messenger of gossip and
[2:22:27] fces and evil speaking
[2:22:33] of you become a messenger of good news
[2:22:37] so if you don't have nothing good news
[2:22:39] to say then don't say anything right
[2:22:44] am look people that's what we are C
[2:22:48] that's what Christianity is about it's
[2:22:51] not joining the church no it's about you
[2:22:56] being an
[2:22:58] ambassador it's about you bearing the
[2:23:00] name of Jesus
[2:23:04] Christ even when you are to yourself
[2:23:06] even when it is you and your
[2:23:08] phone when it's you and your cell
[2:23:15] phone I didn't want it to be on
[2:23:18] evangelist I wanted to preach like a
[2:23:21] pastor this
[2:23:22] morning praise the Lord I don't know
[2:23:25] what the enery is coming from but I was
[2:23:27] I was praying I said Lord I don't I
[2:23:29] don't want to go into you know prophecy
[2:23:32] and start is chasing this scripture here
[2:23:35] the scripture I said Lord I'm I'm doing
[2:23:37] just like the disciples
[2:23:40] did Jesus said let's feed these
[2:23:43] people the
[2:23:45] disciples said Lord
[2:23:47] there was only a Le here with
[2:23:51] bread he said bring it the disciple went
[2:23:54] and got the bread from the little boy
[2:23:57] give it to Jesus he lift it up he
[2:24:01] blessed it and he gave it back to them I
[2:24:03] told the Lord I say take this little
[2:24:06] thought on my heart let me be able to
[2:24:09] speak to the people tomorrow not to run
[2:24:11] all over the place and run you through a
[2:24:14] lot of scriptures and through lot of
[2:24:16] Prophecy
[2:24:17] I mean we could spend we could spend the
[2:24:19] rest of the year in Isaiah 52 but there
[2:24:22] are a lot of beautiful things there but
[2:24:26] just to be able to think that prophecy
[2:24:30] how
[2:24:31] beautiful are the
[2:24:33] feet that bring Good
[2:24:36] Tidings praise the
[2:24:38] Lord to know that when God called a man
[2:24:42] or God called a
[2:24:44] woman and as he have gathered us from
[2:24:47] different backgrounds and
[2:24:50] different life and different
[2:24:54] upbringing to be able to achieve his
[2:24:57] purpose are we driven to the thought of
[2:25:00] why why are we
[2:25:04] here are we driven to that thought why
[2:25:07] do we come
[2:25:08] here I mean there are other nice
[2:25:11] churches
[2:25:12] around this place is just like a
[2:25:15] box
[2:25:17] why do we come
[2:25:22] here are we able to follow just in the
[2:25:26] past
[2:25:27] month what has the spirit been saying to
[2:25:30] the
[2:25:32] church we have all these brothers come
[2:25:35] around and they come to visit and you
[2:25:36] know they come and and we allow them to
[2:25:38] preach for us and uh I mean it's it's

[2:25:46] get somebody into to change the
[2:25:48] Flor what are we
[2:25:50] doing what are we
[2:25:54] achieving or are we just hoping that the
[2:25:57] next service will be better than this

[2:31:05] preacher after he have prayed and he
[2:31:07] have studied and and wait on the
[2:31:10] Lord and to come and meet a group of
[2:31:14] people sitting waiting
[2:31:17] to preach he's struggling to convey the
[2:31:20] thought and he want to achieve something
[2:31:22] you look at the time the time is going
[2:31:24] it's getting late he's striving but yet
[2:31:26] you are there and you are saying amen
[2:31:28] and you are saying thank you Jesus you
[2:31:30] know what you do to a
[2:31:33] preacher you know what will happen to a

[2:32:42] was
[2:32:44] rejection Jesus Jesus died from
[2:32:47] rejection more than the
[2:32:49] nails that went through his hands it was
[2:32:53] not the nails it was his own creatures
[2:32:55] rejecting
[2:32:57] him and said crucified
[2:33:05] him if you want to
[2:33:07] kill your children reject him just a
