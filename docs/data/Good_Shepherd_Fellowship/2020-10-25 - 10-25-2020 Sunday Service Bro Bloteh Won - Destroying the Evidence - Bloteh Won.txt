thank you musicians i will do the rest of the singing at the end of the series amen let's just take our bibles now now saint john chapter 12 amen john chapter 12. it's in john chapter 12 we read you all again in the name of the lord jesus and those that are streaming in we greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ in john chapter 12 we read from verse 1 praise the lord amen then six then jesus praise the lord amen then jesus sixth day before the passover came to bethany yeah i said then six because there was something that was in my head so i just i was trying to say that and i started reading at the same time i wanted to say you know uh i watched that seven because it's always a mystery that's why the prophet god said in souls in praising either sixth day before or sixth day after something always happened in the scripture but this was six days before the passover came to bethany jesus came where lazarus was which have been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper a matter of self but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took mary a pound of ointment of sparckner very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and whipped his feet with her head and the house was filled with the order of the ornament then said one of his disciples judas oscar simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 penny pence and giving to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the beg the money back the treasurer by the way and bad uh what was put there in then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burial have she kept this for the paul always he have with you but me ye have not always now knowing that he knows all things knowing that he even knew the thought of judas as curse but see his approach he never said you thief amen it is written here there because he was a thief after everything has happened this is john making the report but at that time jesus never dealt with that he knew what was going on amen verse nine most people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake on it but that they might see lazarus also whom he have raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believe on jesus amen having the second scripture here that's uh 2nd timothy chapter three second timothy chapter three and i have a i have a verse there you know he will read that verse or the verse along with faith but that second termite chapter 3 amen verse second to minute chapter three let's read from verse one this also the lord bless you you can have your seed let me not keep you up stand alone this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves cavultures boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parent unthankful and unholy and all of these things will be happening but let's just drop down to verse 5 amen they will also be having the form of godliness they will be having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away they will be having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof this morning i want to speak on destroying the evidence destroying the evidence praise the lord destroying the evidence that's what i want to speak on this i i pick up this talk many years ago many years ago i can't remember but i still remembered i was somewhere back in abidjan went back home and i was i was listening to you of to a tape and i heard i heard i heard the prophet of god saying out there in in some of his jehovah gyra series and if you check it up you can see it and i have i have one year do i really have it praise the lord yeah i don't i don't think i pull it in this in my note but uh [Music] and what he was talking about actually he was talking about uh abraham going to sacrifice isaac after abraham has waited 25 years for this promised son a year god coming on the scene and asking him to go and offer isaac up and then he's dramatizing it and he's saying and satan is speaking to abraham and mine and saying do you mean that you are going to destroy the evidence so that thought caught my mind for as many as long time ago and and and but i was what i was trying to struggling in my mind i'm trying to reconcile destroying the evidence you know uh uh what what what a benefit it can be that's i've struggled with that in my mind many years many years ago and it comes back to me and i think about it it comes back to me and recently i started thinking about it again as i was i was looking at something else the talk came back to me and destroying the evidence so uh uh you know i started studying but i compare this with uh [Music] lazarus situation year amen the bible says the chief priests they consulted they plotted to get rid of lazarus to put him back to death because he wasn't evidence [Music] so we're talking about destroying the evidence of the resurrection if you can take it from the church you can bring everything of the word in the church the only thing that is stopping a flood gate of sin and word from the church is the evidence of the resurrection that is dwelling in the hearts of the believer because satan can stand dead so everything every pressure that he's putting on the believer is to destroy the evidence praise the lord is to destroy the evidence whenever there is a coup case or there is a crime and things happen that is the first thing people try to look for to try to erase the evidence because if they can get rid of the evidence then there is no case but i'm telling you it's hard to destroy evidence amen it's hard to destroy evidence oh my goodness put on your seatbelt this morning hey man you can't stop evidence that's why we have a forensic theme and people have been taught how to go in and you know and and they can go into a crown spot and they can look around and look around and they will be looking around and and i mean if they see a shoes on the kitchen table is that is not a normal place for her shoes to be so as shoes being on the kitchen table know grab that grab the attention of the the you know grab the attention of the the investigators praise the lord and then the the the starts to look into it so i mean and all of that praise the lord so uh i heard sister evie back there [Laughter] she's always working with evidence in the cold so i think is catching her attention this morning i have to be careful now praise the lord i don't work in the cult system so i have to be careful how i use my language praise the lord amen it's just a wonderful thing to be a a child of god amen praise the lord and and we just love the lord for that amen but we want to talk about destroying the evidence it's something that is difficult to do and you know i i said thought about it you know sometimes the lord gave you a thought and and it can go for years and years and years waiting for the appointed time and just at the point of time he can give you the right material and give you the right thoughts amen but when we look back to our scripture year the bible makes us to know sixth day before the passover and we have to realize that jesus was the truth pass over lamb amen he was the truth passover lamb and uh and years said he went down over to uh to visit with his friend lazarus and when he got in the synod you just read the chapter back that was where lazarus was resurrected and we know all of the things that have happened you know mary mattered the same for jesus and he was not coming you know the council came he says you you see that's what happened you left the church you'll follow that man and uh you know and now the priests can come and counsel your weary seat and we know all the other things that you know people nature has not changed amen man is stay the same praise the lord and but we see that but we know what happened when jesus came praise the lord he said lazarus comfort and the grave could not hold him praise the lord amen the grave could not hold him a man been dead four days he resurrected amen and and and jesus jesus allowed for corruption to set in his body when it went over 72 hours and corruption has already set in his body praise the lord and i believe one of the reasons it will bring us back to what paul said in the book of uh timothy that immortality dwells with us praise the lord so we might be sick with this uh problem and sick you having many of god's children that are still fighting cancers and different things but yet in that body immortality does in their soul amen the bottom is struggle with pains and different things but there is life that dwarf india saw is now when we cross over before we get eternal life we get a full test of a year in this body oh that's the thing that keeps us with joy that's the thing that keeps us praising god you know for the believer saving jesus is not a means many people take christianity as a means to be happy christianity is not a means christianity is the end praise the lord amen oh people i mean uh they want to serve god because they want to get a good job they want to serve god because they believe that you know at the end of the day they're going to have a happy life they got to get a good wife they got to go to good marriage you gotta get you know uh uh you know uh and and all of that christianity is not a means praise the lord that's not what i'm going anyway but yeah so we see here that lazarus it's a life and evidence now you have to know that was the subject of discuss in the sahebrance council because the pharisees believed the resurrection the sadducees don't believe the resurrection but yet in the sanhedrin's council they could put their doctrine aside and agree when it comes to council meeting let's not talk about resurrection before we support this meeting you'll leave that subject they can agree the scientists uh the the uh scientist council the pharisees you know sadducees herodians and ered or zadok and all of the different groups that were there they had their petty difference and petty in doctrines and that is the same thing they do in the word council of churches but so but we we see here that jesus in his teaching started preaching about he that believed in me will not die and you know he started saying all of these things and this was the thing that was causing problems this kind of a teaching because they were not heard in you know in those different groups that were there praise the lord you remember one time the the the sahindrans wanted to i mean the uh the sadducees wanted wanted to attack him and he brought the story of this man that married his wife he died calling to the lord his his his brother should marry her and the brother died calling to the lord the other brother and there were seven brothers and she never had a child now in the resurrection whose wife she's going to be because they wanted to prove that there is no resurrection amen now as jesus talked about the subject of the resurrection he was not going to allow them to go to the grave and go to the other side lazarus would be resurrected right in the city this would not be when we die this would be when we are all alive praise the lord they were talking when when when you know when the in in the resurrection who wife they would be praise the lord jesus said let not wait for that time let's do it right now amen the holy ghost is not for the rapture it's not for the millennium the holy ghost is for right now is for right now it's for today it's for the challenges of today it's for the hour that we are living in praise the lord oh when we get to heaven we're going to be happy we're going to praise the lord that prison right now we can praise him right now oh because heaven is on earth heaven is in our soul praise the lord destroying the evidence glory be to god whenever there is a plane crash they always want the black box because if they can get the black box they can be able to have some evidence what actually went wrong praise the lord amen oh may the lord help us this morning amen he helped me and i'm feeling nervous but i know that that is the way for me to get out of the way and for god to speak to his children this morning so yeah yes yes yes the deal most of these people came in you know now the whole story has gone around town all over jerusalem and man raised from the dead after four days no that was just that was just that was just a lie they were just tricking go there you know didn't you read in the newspaper you know go back in and check your newspaper you know this setting did you know look on the uh the obituary page there is one lazarus that died it was in the newspaper i have the paper you know and this man that was dead and on that setting day he's alive really no you're i mean you're bringing all sorts of things in this town and uh you know and it was just all over so people were floating into the city you know people was coming back you know whenever they are traveling whether they're going to jericho or whatever they will stop by bettany was a hot spot amen all rose leads to bethany amen because a man that was once dead is now alive amen praise the lord glory be to god can you imagine you know the awake lazarus from his sleep 6 a.m last lazzy my son would come lazzy yeah sorry sorry sorry for disturbing your sleep someone is here to see you amen praise the lord all they want to see is just to see him yeah oh the jedi stabbed his sleep just to see him praise the lord amen glory be to god but why all of this uh uh excitement was going on and bethany being a hot spot and uh in every role leading there then people coming and floating in and you know i mean malta she like making food amen i mean she was just serving people she got to make you know a sandwich for people when they come around you know and all of their acting is they got to keep the house clean because they don't know when people will show up and all of that praise the lord you see that i mean that's one of the things you also have to think about when you're thinking about wanting a miracle amen you got to think about that too what goes with wanting a miracle amen so uh but on the other side we have this council of the chief priests the hindrance council discussing on this side we have to put an end to it we have to put an end to it these are religious people these are the people that we will call our bishops and act bishops discussing to put an end to something that not not what a man has done so something that the very god they claim to self they wear their big robs they stand on their high platform pages and they talk about god but the very god that they claim to self has raised a man from the dead praise the lord and they are discussing plotting and planning how to kill him all because he's on evidence praise the lord all because he's an evidence but it's hard to stop an evidence amen lazarus was a gentleman there was no crime it's never regarded of what crime he has done the only crime that lazarus did was he was on evidence his crime was his life was a rebuke to a religious system and that's what the church the the council of churches will come after you that's the reason why they will come after you is because your life is an evidence praise the lord amen look this is serious business all of these things that is happening the lord is just preparing us for for our time there is coming on another to this world where the uh uh uh politics and and and and religion is going to join together they're going to blend together they're going to agree and they're going to compare every claiming church to fall under that belief system it's coming people praise the lord that was the only crime that lazarus committed because his life he being alive his choice of leaving the synagogues and following jesus that then they had a church they were meeting either on on the mountain or they would meet uh on the sea where he would use a boat to preach you know or they'll meet on a tree they have out of this house fellowship for him to leave that big uh uh uh uh a temple that was built by solomon and and you know and and where people had their family records for generation and generation and generation they left the system and they choose to follow the message of their day they choose to follow the messenger of the hour the lord and hear it said the alive now becoming a rebuke a rebuke to a corrupt system that is the way your life is young people when you choose to stand by god's word amen it's a rebuke you must be proud of it and don't be ashamed for paul says i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for is the power of god unto salvation amen or you might think you you're going through your little battle out of all of these things but on the other hand your life is a rebuke to this filthy and corrupt generation a generation that is just full of filth amen god is raising you up he's possessing your being he's dealing with your heart for you to be a rebuke when young people are leading in singing and uh uh sex is the order of the dating and drugs is the order of the day but yet god have people in every generation oh we have a people for his namesake let them call you whatever they think they want to call you praise the lord that was lazarus only crime it's because he was on evidence praise the lord and one thing that people don't like people don't like to be reminded i mean people don't like to be reminded that's why we try to destroy evidence because as long as an evidence see that's why all of these people that work on crime evidence they are able to build an evidence to be able to bring you back to the scene they will bring you back to the scene and people are afraid of that to come back to the scene but a believer is not afraid of to come back to the scene amen oh i don't want to go get ahead of myself praise the lord oh i don't want to get it get ahead of myself amen and that is the same thing with the church they are denying the power thereof just having the form of godliness they can belong to a church put their name on the church bulk they don't care how they run their life get a little church or drinks and and you know and just fly loose and stay they can hold to their profession praise the lord they are denying the evidence they are denying the evidence glory be to god are we together amen oh what a wonderful jesus that we serve amen praise the lord glory be to god when you think about there is a nation in israel today and you think about how hitler choose to wep those people of the earth a trouble any of those men that will that will that they were eating with uh with with hitler regime it troubled them when the year jerusalem on the news because it plays back to their mind that they were not able to wipe out the evidence when he heard about jews and he heard about jerusalem it brings your mind back because hitler was planning to whip the jews out of the earth glory be to god amen my my my mind destroying the evidence glory be to god david said in sin that my mother conceived me i came to the world speaking lies praise the lord that was an evidence that in sin my mother conceived me because i came to the word speaking lies i never went to school to learn how to lie amen i never learned how to go to school to learn how to lie when mama and asked me at two years old you ate the cookies i said no it was right in my blood that was the evidence that i was born and seen shipley in iniquity and how men tried to destroy that evidence by just hiding on a religion that was what adam tried to do i mean he never knew he was naked but when when he when he committed the same unbelief and expose himself to what god told him not to do he realized that he was naked while he tried to do hide the evidence praise the lord amen that's the reason why when god came down god said who told you you were naked he tried to hide the evidence oh my goodness me praise the lord oh my what a day that we are living in what a time that we are living in that's the reason why the baptising of the holy ghost is the dynamics of this church amen the refilling of the holy ghost amen yesterday that was i was listening i actually wanted to play this morning for for the bible study but i didn't know where the brothers were with the tape i was listening to a testimony and the brother had on the believer's website of of a young woman i mean it just so blessed my heart yesterday while i was sitting there in the office studying and a young woman this happened in in san antonio a couple of years back there was there was there was a serious uh killer that was that was hunting down the town yeah i mean the entire town he had the time on a siege because he was going in and and i mean he was just destroying the lives of young women and you know and all of that and this young woman believing young woman she said she left her house she was going somewhere that morning and and when she left her house and i mean she just got through reading and praying and she was going to do some things and she and her husband had an appointment to go out and while she were leaving her house she just failed in her heart to go back and get some some gospel tape get some message to play and she went back in the house and she got she got the gospel taping and and and got some books she says i mean she just fell like that and then when she got in uh got in her car uh as soon as she left the house she went i think to a shopping place also but when she got back in her car yeah that that young man was in her car haha under the rest asked her to move to the passenger seat and uh and he uh got into the driver's seat but oh you you you love to listen to that she said something just came over here and she told a young man straight to his face i'm not afraid of you you know and she started ministering to him and started quoting scriptures to him and and and and and right away the the spirit of god took over the vehicle praise the lord the spirit of god took over the vehicle and uh uh uh but while we are talking this you know just like i said about lazarus this this young man his name is all in the newspaper it's all around san antonio the police the fbi are all on the run trying to find find this guy and he knew that his life was out there amen are we together now so uh uh and she started ministering to him and started you know uh talking to him and she said you know i just believe that this was the law because there was no fear that was in my heart as she started to talk and prayed as soon as a young man i won't spend all my time on this testimony the young man started to tell her and says you are different see you are different why are you not afraid haven't you heard what i've been doing in this town haven't you read the newspaper and he was he was trying to tear her of all the evil that she he has done but she said i just block him instruct i don't want to hear what you have done i'm telling you about what jesus has done because he was trying to use his language to intimidate her and bring her out of fear and she was trying to she said she didn't want to listen to it you know i was just thinking about you know what we spoke about last week how the holy ghost just possessed her and she said that's exactly what happened because after a period of time the boy i mean he got he got on a such a conviction until he asked her to call her husband say call your husband tell him you are okay she said when she called her husband and told and her husband wanted to know where she was she was not telling him she just said i would be home soon and this that she said but when she broke out of that rain to start to talk to her husband then she started getting afraid she's not getting the fresh she's that she said she started shaking then he asked her all this why you not been shaking why are you shaking what is happening then she realized that it was a spirit of fear amen fear is a demon it's not just a thought it's a spirit it's a devil praise the lord but as the story goes on she led him to christ she led him to christ she started talking he says they were driving i mean i mean this was about uh maybe uh uh about a morning time or or maybe at noon he he uh you know arrested this woman and it was up to about six seven eight nine in the night she would stay there with him but at the evening time where they were driving she i mean said he said just pull over and she said to her surprise she didn't know what happened you know as soon as she pulled the car over he raised his hand up and said lord jesus forgive me for all i've had done took his gun empty all the bullet in her purse and everything as the story goes on and uh and finally he told her take me to the bus station she took him bought a bus ticket give give him the book that she was reading and the bible and she went home at that time her husband freaking out she said when she got home police have surrounded her house and when she got out she started smiling her husband got so angry where have you been where have you been we've been looking for you you are laughing and at this and she told him that she was wave the man that had been hunting the time down she said his knees knock he fell to the ground he fell to the ground so being afraid and that's how the police interrogated her and everything finally she had to tell them where he was to the bus station they went there they saw this young man as calm sitting down reading the book that the lady gave him he turned himself in gave his gun give all his knives and told the detective the story he says it would have been the bloody fight here today it is because of that young woman i give my heart to the lord jesus there is no evil in my heart and that's how he want to praise him the end of the story i mean they gave him the death penalty but just before the death penalty he he he said a prayer that was typed out you know how he prayed to the lord jesus and you know committing himself he said father i'm coming home i just played the story of the thief on the cross but the the praising god testified that he became a christian because of that young man and many inmates gave themselves to the lord jesus why because of a young woman that was possessed by the holy ghost a young woman that decided not to be terrified by the devil god always having evidence praise the lord if you have not seen it don't doubt it because it's it's real praise the lord oh my goodness i was just reading that i said oh my father what is this what is this thing happening it just looked like oh my goodness praise the lord praise the lord and just before his execution they asked her to go and visit him she got so afraid she said she was so afraid she was just afraid that she couldn't go to the prison she said i couldn't understand but i just believe that at that time in the vehicle the presence of god was just like a bubble around me amen praise the lord and that's just how it is god will possess your body in the time of trial glory be to god how did i got myself into this but we're talking about destroying the evidence young people this holy ghost is real this power of god is real amen it changes life it can break habits it can take same desire away it can empower you to stand in the face of the devil lies don't let anybody tell you that it's not truth there is power in the blood amen and the blood will never lose its power until this ransom church be safe to say no more amen let me read something to you here from the unfailing realities of the living god and that's what pentecost is doing today they want to make intellectual giants they want to take the power of the power out of the church that's what they want to do just bring us intellectual giants people that would just use words you know they just just bring terminology they play on the minds of the people bring laughter in the church people to make jokes to take the power of god away from the people robbing the people they want to take the power out of the church they want to make a denomination grow just big churches that's all just the numbers let's open the door let everybody float in just the numbers paul said denying the power they're off bringing more members in that's nonsense and when you buy the man to a creed when you do that you take the holy spirit away from him denying the power thereof destroying the evidence we have evidence over and over god has delivered people with drugs people in same-sex marriages people that have even transformed their body god is god amen he will have an evidence in every age of how real he is praise the lord oh what almighty god we serve amen what a mighty god we serve blessed be the name of the lord amen what is the holy ghost giving for what is the holy ghost then power from on high now power from from the bishop our power from from the church but power from on high how did the power come now that joining church he said i challenge you to do it see by joining church shake the hand of the preacher how did it come power from on high this is when they assembled together in one accord and god empower his people that's what the holy ghost is for is to empower you to make you to stand in the face to for you to face your fear believe that this the church still has a power god has never taken his power from the church but the church don't have faith enough to act upon it amen the power is there praise the lord the church don't have faith enough to add upon it that's all it just it's just that simple we try to make it so complicated sometimes but but the more simple you make the gospel the more real you will have it when you just get real simple with it god said it that set to it and that's all and just believe it and go ahead that's the human mind we always try to come you know make it complicated by reasoning how we it happen amen if we were just think about who said it then how will it happen things will be much better for us who said it god said it if god said it god is able to back it up praise the lord oh my god hallelujah so let's get to the story we see god gave abraham a promise 25 years he waited for it and year he said god is saying abraham if you love me then you have to give me your son you have to sacrifice him to me praise the lord amen abraham told his wife took his seventh the wing left them down on the mountain took his little boy up the hill you think about it praise the lord yes god has given him a promise and here is god going to destroy the evidence that this man has waited for him 25 years and only god can destroy evidence because when god destroyed an evidence he wrote it back to the original when men destroyed evidence they used clorox they tried to change the color they tried to whip it up they tried to hide it they tried to do everything but the evidence is still there but when god destroyed an evidence he wrote it back to the original so he told abraham oh when the lord helped me to understand this i was just having a shouting fight amen i said god you are so good praise the lord he told abraham take your son up there and and you sacrificed him to me now you have to remember that every sacrificial in the bible from adam that the lamb that god slayed to cover adam a a a a sin in the garden of eden all of that represented christ because that was the lamb of god that was flamed from the foundation of the word in god's mind so when god told abraham to prove his love to him god was not just so cruel over the son of of of of abraham god was thinking about what he had in his mind praise the lord abraham and his son got up there and and he built the altar that he and little isaac so excited for his first sacrifice running around picking up the wood and his fat oh daddy i would do it and he built the altar put the wood together and everything how does it look papa it looked good but where is the lamb where is the sacrifice praise the lord he says son god will provide himself a sacrifice that was what abraham said he said god will provide himself praise the lord even though god told him to do that praise the lord now you see that the thing about it there is that this is one of the things that the church through the ages has suffered from praise the lord this uh this uh uh uh a kind of a a humanistic gospel where man is so much in the picture people tell you what they have done for the lord they want to talk about what they have done for the lord you can do nothing for god you can't even suffer from for god when you suffer you are partaking of his suffering it is his suffering that you are partaking on amen god will provide himself a sacrifice that's what that's that was the answer that abraham told his son and every time isaac comes and says papa where is the sacrifice isaac god will provide himself a sacrifice amen now so what god will do he will roll back amen he will roll back to the original sacrifice by providing a ram in the ticket because what abraham was going to do was representing the lamb of god that was flamed from the foundation of the world and he's the only one that can destroy the evidence praise the lord oh my goodness only him can destroy the evidence because what he does is that he take our sin and put it in the sea of forgetfulness he wrote it back and justify you and say you have never done it in the first place praise the lord amen it's just not a lived confession but i mean he deeds with your life he changed your life so much that the things that you used to cry for the things that used to rule your life have no longer power over you he break the drug's habit the sex habit the lying habits even if you try high you'll never be able to find your way back that's how he destroyed the evidence only god can destroy the evidence praise the lord that was what he did for adam amen he provided alarm and you know what he did covered covered them in the lime skin in the bleeding skin that when adam and eve was growing out of the garden of eden it was not it was not human blood that was dropping but it was a lime blood speaking about the lamb of god god covered up the evidence by rolling it back to the original the original sacrifice praise the lord he sent joshua and his men out there to jericho he says bring thou we could set it down amen go and bring down city down go inspire the land then there is a woman a rehab that has such an ugly reputation she was an infant woman she was a prostitute but she saw this mess she saw these men at first she approached them she thought they were strangers they might need a place to sleep because that was the weight of her life she knew this man that came in the city and went out praise the lord we know the story about it how the word of jericho came down but later did rahab knew that when that war came down all the evidence of her past life came down with the wall all the evidence of her past life the past men that she slept with came down the past house said she slept and came down and god wept the evidence away only god can destroy the evidence and that's what the promise of the holy ghost is that's what the promise of the holy ghost is to the church is to destroy the evidence of sin change our lives paul says because we believe in grace should we continue in sin say god forbid god forbid now what is the purpose of his death and we must just be hanging around in every scene and just we are on a grace we are not on what is the purpose of his death now you have to remember you cannot destroy the evidence you might try and every try that you you try you will just be using makeup that's why people use makeup for to this do to cover up the evidence every try you try you will just be using makeup it will not take away the evidence the only thing that takes away the evidence is the blood of jesus christ is the lamb of god you join this church you're just using makeup you run to this other church you're just using makeup you do this church screen you're just using makeup [Music] but there is one makeup you can use repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the holy ghost power from on higher and whip away the evidence oh my goodness oh praise the lord what a mother god we sell amen oh what a mighty god we serve praise the lord that's that's the one we are talking about amen that's the god we are talking about amen oh you love the lord amen are you grateful that he had destroyed the evidence amen can you do you feed it that there is nothing against you do you feed it that your evidence has been destroyed praise the lord if there is something that is still haunting your life i promise you this morning there is there is enough blood in this world there is enough bleeding in this world if you still have the accuser coming after you you got to take the book and say show me the evidence you devil show me the evidence because when i look in this book it says my name is on the line book of life and when i look in this book you must be able to take this word put it in the devil hands and say show me the evidence don't talk in my ear show me the evidence that's what a young woman was trying to avoid because she knew if she allowed that guy to keep talking he even stopped at a gas station and asked her to go and buy the papers and when she brought she said promise me one thing i will buy the paper but don't read anything of yourself to me because i don't want to hear it i don't want to hear it she was keeping him in his tracks because when you allow the devil to talk he get a loud mouth amen and because there is no teeth in his mouth he just he just use all of that to intimidate you give him the book say look it's an open book it's an open book show me the evidence praise the lord amen oh that's that is the promise that is given to the bride amen yeah i was i was reading this last night i want to read a quote here from from invisible union i thought in my mind i says well maybe i should keep this for thanksgiving day i say no it's thanksgiving every day is thanksgiving for the believer every day because when you remember that there is nothing against you you wake up in the morning you don't have to be looking over your shoulder i mean you don't have to be looking looking on your phone and saying i i mean who's coming after me if they are texting me or uh you know there's nothing coming after you because you are saved in his arms when you wake up in the morning the first thing that comes to your mind lord jesus thank you thank you for watching over me thank you for another day you don't have to go and turn the news on to see you know what if if the city is burning you you know that if it is burning my house is going to stand alone praise the lord so thank you jesus but see how the enemy plagues our mind and he having you know he having a very slow softer way of doing it praise the lord he makes you to feel like you are not afraid you just want to know what is on the news i'm not afraid we ever win the election but i just want to know how the pools the polls are going i just i don't want to know the polls i i don't care when they're already praise the lord amen you love the lord amen let's just take this one i'll leave you in a little bit here praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah sorry mr josh we're just having a good time i hope you're enjoying yourself okay i don't want to leave you out of this party but that's that's just the way it is here for us it's just church [Laughter] praise the lord amen you know don't don't get mad with her bringing you just get out with me invincible union how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your honor daughter's parents eve your adulterous parents sorry is no fault of your own amen praise the lord i was fellowshipping with uh with one one of the believers and we were talking on something and they did the thought just crossed my mind you know so so i asked ask you know ask the person that says well you know this thing that you're talking about you know did you went to the store to buy and and i think the lord just gave us a breaking point there because it came so real some of the things that we struggle with is it it's genetically you know but the devil has a way of making a u but you have to realize the real you is in this cell this is a prison for the real you amen and honor the praising system the way to make you to lost your identity is by giving you a number they don't call you by name they call you by number amen and age is just a number oh i'm getting all all i get is just a number young that's the reason why when the war comes you can jump up you can say hallelujah that is that that is the expression of the rear you don't let the devil put a number on you and come and tell me you're getting old i don't want to hear that i was sitting in the office dead and uh and uh yeah uh you know brother hillary leading never grow oh i said oh my goodness what why is that brother leading the sun like a finium never grow old should be a song a believer should be never grow oh you must express it [Applause] you must be able to express it because it's a confession it's a reality [Applause] don't sing it like we're standing over a grave amen it's just a number that's the devil prison system he put a number on you amen no matter what your age is there he said there was a 18 year old behind our body glory be to god amen i'm telling you we have an emergency right now you see how all of these bodies will be flipping through that door just like but you don't have to wait for an emergency to express your youthfulness you don't have to you have to express it every day every moment let the devil knows that's a young vibrant person living in his body [Applause] glory to god amen whoo but bram says that's the reason you were born you know he says uh you were a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it we were born in sin amen even before committing no sin we were born in sin that is by the sin of our our parents adam and eve but you can be able to change the course you can be able to cut yourself from that same line because there is a provision through the cross of jesus christ there is no need of making poor excuse i'm just a sinner saved by grace yes that's the reason why jesus died so you will not stay as sinners saved by grace you will be a sinner redeemed amen and now a son and daughter of god he says this is my message to the church now you are standing if you are standing in god's word amen and with god's word every amen every jug every title where you are standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from the shark and get into the wheat where you can get wrapped before the sun i heard the coming of the combined he says you are standing complete justify like you never did it in the first place amen that's the thing that destroyed the evidence amen and that was the thing that the pharisees were trying to kill lazarus for instead of rejoicing that the god of abraham is in our midst they're trying to kill him because he came back to life he came back to life god allowed it that it was not just a family matter of mary and martyr they took him to the grave they opened the tomb they put him there they put a stone that's why when jesus came back to bethlehem the whole town came when he told mary i am the resurrection and the life where you laid him praise the lord the bible says the whole town came to see what he was going to do he stood right there he left his head to heaven and he wept but he wept like a man and he says where you laid him roll this the stone away see all of those hypocrites wearing maxis at the grave of elijah they were all weary maxies because they don't want to smell glory be to god amen but he said lazarus come forth and the man that was dead for four days he came up praise the lord glory be to god his feet were bound hands were bound lars were coming from the tomb mata are you here married glory be to god that was what he said turn him loose they didn't even hurry because the evidence of the resurrection that's what it is the evidence of christianity is a new life it's not it's not you dragging your own life and struggling it's a birth of a new life it's a resurrection amen we die with christ and we are buried in baptism when we rise up it's a newness of life then god gave you an evidence you are a living evidence that god can change the life praise the lord people are trying to hide the evidence they think by coming on a religion they can i know until god do a work in your heart until there is a work in the inside of the inside amen you will just be using makeup for a while until the power of god comes inside your religion would just be a bennett you pull one bandit to stop the blood and you change it and put another banner and you changing it put another banner but let the healer takes your hands when he takes your hands and say father put his hands back together when he remove his hands not even a scar not even a scar nothing to point back to because he destroyed the evidence musicians you can come praise the lord just before we prayed and uh you know just commit the
