TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going away of the bride discern the face of the skies but the signs of the time you cannot discern and on his trial it is in the federal courts to make these council of churches and everything you can discern communism and all these things that preachers are preaching about and walking right over the signs of the time and calling into fanaticism calling it mental telepathy or something like that and walking away and forbidding their people to come even here if history has to repeat itself i'm my name's not william branham exactly right what's going to happen it throws the blood of jesus christ right back on your hands and you're calling an unclean spirit like they did then all around the world i guess you know what i meant man everywhere why'd you turn me down in switzerland why did you do it finland the blood's gonna be up on your own hands that's upon you not me you never turn me down you turn him down not me because you said i don't believe in such the word says such there you are blind pharisees they can discern communism discern all these things but the hour they're living in they can't discern it that's exactly right now it's about to reach it's my final goal again the crucial hour is sure again what is it crucify we don't make we can't all make them all methodists we can't make them all bad because we can't make them all oneness we can't make them all trinity we can't make them all this side of the other but we can have a council where you disagree as far as the east is from the west and the whole thing's wrong it's a satellite to rome exactly right now as an individual i'm going to ask you what will you do with this anointed word which is the christ the word that was promised for this day you as an individual pilate never got it off his hands you know that he screamed cried in every scheme he could do he failed to do it there's a legend up and switzed on there where a blue water washes up where he committed suicide you know the history of it he finally running crazy and he committed suicide why didn't he repent he couldn't repent no more than esau could repent he had done it don't you let that happen to you he's on your hands the works is done the bible's preached the holy ghost has identified it amen any sinful man dare you to say it isn't soul the holy ghost in this last days and the words that's been spoken said it would come to pass and here it is right before us don't try to do it don't let your end be like pilate no he should have accepted him in his heart that's the only way you can get him off your hands is take him in your heart oh don't make that same mistake listen hebrews 10 says this if we sin willfully disbelieve willfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin if you sin willfully after it's been identified to you and you turn it down you are absolutely no chance of ever repenting just a moment i got a note here i want to bring to you before closing like the spies on the road to the promised land there was in an exodus coming out of egypt come out by a promised word of god god made his word known by a prophet moses sent him down there he was identified that he was a god to bring him out under the conditions that he would promise to the i am when they come to the borderland katie sparnia the great mistake they made when they got to the land and looked over into the promised land they said we can't take it what was the other ten they looked at the circumstances their prestige they would lose wear grasshoppers through the sodom but joshua and caleb checked up they went back to the word and the lord said i've given you this land it's a good land flowing with milk and honey they didn't count what it looked like what this was and what this evidence was god's word said i'll give it to you go get it they were the only ones that went in oh let us check the promises of god for today that's right remember we're in another exodus a time of exodus this time not into a promised land of the earth but into the promised land of glory worth there's no return no more glory that god we're going to be there will you do it while we bow our heads i'm going to ask this question while every man and woman is still what will you do with this jesus called christ will you accept him will you take him as your savior will you be a are will you wash him off your hands will you try to pass on well my my creed doesn't say this or my denomination doesn't believe it just like that it's right on your hands you can't get away from it what will you do with jesus call christ his blood is on your hands since this week in the meeting let us pray lord jesus us just now in this hour let thy grace and mercy be with us let this congregation see lord with our god and there's none except thee let the power of god now the word identify itself in this people that it might be known that your god and i've told the truth lord i've done it this at your command as elijah said long ago i've did this all at your command grant lord that'll be so in jesus christ's name amen now with your heads bowed every one of you the holy spirit just stopped me a few minutes ago when i started praying he said there's some here that don't know that yet may god of heaven leave you without anything maybe throw it right back in your lap today then you sick people sure i've never done this in a business man's meeting you sick people here that believe god i believe you have faith to touch his garment and you remember the bible said in hebrews 4 the word of god is sharper than a 2 8 sword a discerner of thoughts that's in the heart we all know that you believe it will you pray let not one person move from now on let everyone be real reverend real quiet real quiet pray may the holy ghost now lead us to what to do and what to say for this crucial hour is you're now against this lord jesus it's in your hands i'm in your hands i commit myself to you throw it back in their laps lord put it right bang sure your great holy spirit tells me here what's right and wrong and i know this tape's going to meet many out there i pray that you'll let it be known today that i've told them the truth and i've been sent for this like you said on the river that time when that angel of the lord stood there in that pillar of fire let it be known today that i've told the truth through jesus christ's name amen raise your heads in look this away and don't you doubt god almighty be the judge of us when jesus christ stood here on earth when he died he healed the sick he saved the lost you believe that but when he sure how they know he was because he was the word how many knows that to be true he was the word and the word discerns the thoughts it's in the heart is that right i can't see a person in this building this time i know except these pastors and so forth back here or maybe brother roberts is sure i'll just have him start a prayer line his brother robert's back in there all right my ministry will do for this kind i challenge you in the name of jesus christ to believe me that i've told the truth about the word and believe it what i've said to be the truth will you do that amen let it be lord let it be there's a man standing right here why won't you turn your eyes can't you see that light hanging there there's a man sitting there looking at me
