[19:07] [Music]
[19:14] [Music]
[19:45] The
[19:47] sand
[19:49] have been washed in.
[19:52] [Music]
[20:01] This is an old hymn. It's really a
[20:03] blessing. You enjoy this. The words as
[20:07] much as I will enjoy singing.
[20:10] I sung this many decades ago. I just
[20:14] thought of this yesterday.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:33] The sand
[20:37] in the footprints
[20:41] [Music]
[20:43] of the stranger
[20:46] of Galile.
[20:47] [Music]
[20:52] And the voice that subdue the rough
[20:57] pillows
[21:01] will be heard in Judea
[21:05] no more.
[21:09] But the path of that lone gallon
[21:16] with joy I will follow today.
[21:24] For the tolls of the road will seem
[21:28] nothing
[21:32] when I get to the end of the way.
[21:39] For the tolls of the road will seem
[21:44] nothing
[21:47] when I get to the end of the way.
[21:58] There are so many hills to climb upward.
[22:05] I often am longing for rest.
[22:12] But he who appoints me my pathway
[22:19] knows just what is needful and best.
[22:26] I know in his word he has promised.
[22:33] His strength shall be be as my day.
[22:40] For the talls of the road will sing
[22:44] nothing
[22:46] when I get to the end of the way.
[22:53] For the tall of the road will seem
[22:57] nothing
[23:00] when I get to the end of the way.
[23:06] [Music]
[23:10] He loves me too well to forsake me
[23:17] or give me one trial too much.
[23:24] All his children have been dearly
[23:28] purchased
[23:29] [Music]
[23:30] and Satan can never claim such.
[23:37] By and by I shall see him and praise
[23:42] him in the city of unending
[23:47] day.
[23:49] And the talls of the road will seem
[23:53] nothing
[23:56] when I get to the end of the way.
[24:02] And the top of the road will see nothing
[24:09] when I get to the end of the way.
[24:19] When the last faithful step has been
[24:23] taken
[24:24] [Music]
[24:26] and the gates of that city appear
[24:32] and the beautiful song of the angels
[24:38] float out on my listening ear.
[24:45] When all that now seems so mysterious
[24:51] will be bright and as clear as the day.
[24:57] The trolls of the road will be nothing.
[25:04] When I get to the end of the way,
[25:09] [Music]
[25:11] the tall of the road will be nothing
[25:17] when I get to the end of the way.
[25:27] Thank you, Jesus.
[25:30] [Music]
[25:32] [Applause]
[25:36] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.

[46:50] I think as he's growing he's growing out
[46:52] of it
[46:53] &gt;&gt; and you will grow right into his
[46:55] position
[46:57] &gt;&gt; so Isaiah chapter 6 let's read from
[46:59] there tonight and trust that the Lord
[47:02] will give uh blessing to the reading of
[47:06] his word. Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw
[47:11] also the Lord sitting upon his strong
[47:15] high and lifted up and his train filled
[47:18] the temple. Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; And his train filled the temple. We sang
[47:24] this little song yesterday morning after
[47:26] we got before we pray. And the Lord just
[47:30] blessed us with his presence. Yeah.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; And uh uh above it stool the saraphim.
[47:36] Now what I want us to pay attention to
[47:38] here is that uh the scripture says uh
[47:42] Isaiah saw the Lord sitting upon his
[47:45] throne. That was in a vision. He was
[47:47] high and lifted up and his train filled
[47:51] the temple. Pay attention to that. His
[47:53] train filled the temp the temple above
[47:57] it. about his train. The saraphin each
[48:02] one has six wings.
[48:04] With twins they cover their face and
[48:07] with twins they cover their feet and
[48:10] twins they did fly.
[48:13] And one cried unto another, that is the
[48:16] saraphim now crying on one onto another
[48:20] and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[48:23] of hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[48:26] glory." and the post of the door move at
[48:30] the voice of him that cried and the
[48:33] house was filled with smoke.
[48:36] Then sorry
[48:42] something cold that I was not supposed
[48:44] to do but it's okay. Then say I, woe is
[48:48] me, for I am undone because I am a man
[48:53] of unclean lips, and I dwared in the
[48:56] midst of a people of unclean lips. My
[49:00] eyes have seen the king, the Lord of
[49:03] hosts. Then flew one of the saraphene
[49:07] onto men, having a life coat in his
[49:09] hands, which he have taken
[49:13] with the thong from off the altar, and
[49:16] he lay it upon my mouth.
[49:20] And and said, Lo, this have touched thy
[49:24] lips, and thine iniquity is taken away,
[49:28] and thy sin is ped.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also I heard a voice of the Lord
[49:35] saying whom whom shall I send
[49:38] &gt;&gt; and who will go for us? Then I said here
[49:42] am I sent me.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Here am I sent me. The Lord bless you.
[49:48] You may have your seat while you turn to
[49:50] Ephesians chapter 6.
[49:55] Why you turn to Ephesians chapter 6
[49:57] tonight. Praise the Lord. I hope you all
[50:00] had a wonderful wonderful week going on
[50:03] for you. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you all had have a wonderful week
[50:09] going on uh uh for you. So, Ephesians
[50:12] chapter 6 in my reading there. I say
[50:14] from verse one, but I won't read from
[50:16] verse one. I will read from verse 10.
[50:19] If you said verse 10, I said from verse
[50:21] 1 to 10, but it's from verse 10.
[50:24] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[50:26] Lord and in the power of his might. put
[50:29] on the whole armor of God, that ye may
[50:31] be able to stand against the ws of the
[50:34] devil. For we rise not against flesh and
[50:37] blood, but against principality, against
[50:40] power, against rulers of the darkness of
[50:44] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[50:47] in high places.
[50:49] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[50:53] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[50:57] in the evil days and having done all to
[51:00] stand. Praise the Lord.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Paul is now coming to dress. Stand
[51:04] therefore having your your Leon's guilt
[51:07] about with truth and having on the
[51:09] breastplate of righteousness. And then
[51:12] he goes on and then he goes on and and
[51:15] and and we you will see here when you
[51:18] when you count the the the the
[51:23] dress code of this uh Christian soldier
[51:27] uh uh uh Paul actually gave us seven of
[51:32] them. Seven of them. Praise the Lord.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; So he gave us seven of them. Let's look
[51:39] at it together. And verse 14, uh uh you
[51:43] standing therefore and your lambs guilt
[51:45] about with truth. That's one. Your
[51:47] breastplate of righteousness, that's
[51:49] two. Your your your feet shs with the
[51:52] preparation of the gospel. That's three.
[51:56] Above all, take the shield of faith.
[51:58] That's four.
[52:00] Wherewith ye shall be able to quench the
[52:03] fairy doubt of the wicked. Take the take
[52:06] the hermit of salvation. That's five.
[52:10] And the sword of the spirit which is the
[52:13] word of God. There are six.
[52:16] Praise the Lord.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] The seventh is praying always.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Praying always. Now, so tonight I want
[52:29] to I want to take a a little talk
[52:32] tonight that I call wash that seven. is
[52:36] it's actually a quote. I just took that
[52:39] phrase from a quote that brother Brandon
[52:41] sh said in uh souls that are in prison.
[52:45] He says this in in the message souls
[52:47] that are in prison. He says uh uh the
[52:51] seven is always a mystery.
[52:54] Wash that seven.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the seven is always a
[53:01] mystery. Wash that seven. So when you
[53:03] see right here all the armor that Paul
[53:06] gave us, six of them are physical. The
[53:10] seven is a mystery.
[53:12] Praise the Lord. Because you don't put
[53:14] on prayer.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't put on prayer.
[53:22] You put on the ha. You put on the the
[53:24] the shade of faith. You put on the
[53:26] breastplate and all of that, but you
[53:28] pray always without ceasing.
[53:31] Praise the Lord. Amen. So like like like
[53:35] he says here, he says the seven is
[53:37] always a mystery. Watch there seven.
[53:40] That's the finish.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; That was the coming of the Lord.
[53:47] Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody moved.
[53:50] He's talking about the seven the seven
[53:56] seal. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; So, I'm taking that little thought
[54:00] tonight. Watch that seven. That's what I
[54:02] want to go. But I'm that I'm I'm going
[54:05] to use that to be able to jump to
[54:07] something tonight. and uh and just trust
[54:10] that the Lord because what what actually
[54:12] I want to do tonight is that u like I
[54:15] said before you remember when we talk
[54:18] about uh Moses telling the children of
[54:21] Israel that uh if uh if a man steal a
[54:26] sheep he must restore it four times
[54:30] &gt;&gt; and and and what we learn from there is
[54:33] that God deals with principles
[54:37] praise the Lord
[54:39] Amen. God deals with principles. You see
[54:42] the reason why the law was given. It was
[54:45] not for us to keep it because nobody can
[54:48] keep the Lord. But God gave the Lord to
[54:52] be able to show our need for a savior.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; When you realize that you can't keep the
[54:59] Lord, then you found out that you have a
[55:02] need of a savior.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So you see there are a
[55:07] lot of principles the entire world that
[55:10] God created he created it with
[55:12] principles and until we until we
[55:17] understand the principles of God you
[55:19] will just be you will just be following
[55:22] the strict
[55:24] trying to keep this and trying to keep
[55:26] this and trying to do this and trying to
[55:28] avoid this because there are a lot of
[55:30] things I mean God could he could have
[55:33] created the entire world in one day. Why
[55:36] he used six days and the seven he rested
[55:40] &gt;&gt; is a principle.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; He put the principle of our redemption
[55:45] in creation.
[55:49] So when you understand
[55:51] God's principle,
[55:55] then you can be able to unlock
[55:59] the secret, you can be able to unlock
[56:01] the blessings of God. you can be able to
[56:03] unlock because lot of things that people
[56:06] look at from the Bible all they see is
[56:09] just rules don't do this done do and
[56:12] done that's all they see but they don't
[56:14] see God's principle now so
[56:18] and that is the reason why
[56:21] uh uh uh uh God promised for the
[56:24] mysteries to be revealed in this day to
[56:27] be able to show us his principles. So,
[56:30] we're going to look at some tonight.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery,
[56:37] brother. Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the at the the the wedding of
[56:48] Karna, Jesus took six pot,
[56:53] you know, and told him to fill it. He
[56:55] told the woman uh the uh the word you
[56:58] have five husband the one you are with
[57:00] is now your husband that was the six.
[57:03] Where was the seven?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; The seven was a mystery. He was the
[57:06] seven.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; He was the seven.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; You look at the city of refuge. You go
[57:13] back there. You read it in in in uh in
[57:16] Exodus. Uh uh there you will find that
[57:19] there were six city of refuge. And yet
[57:22] Jesus would come and say, "Come unto me
[57:24] all you that live and I will give you
[57:26] rest."
[57:27] &gt;&gt; So the seven is always a mystery.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham in the message uh
[57:34] uh in the on the wings of a snow white
[57:36] dove, he talks about that vision
[57:39] concerning the problem he had in his
[57:41] stomach.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You know, uh that stomach he had uh uh
[57:45] you know, in the vision, he swallowed
[57:47] that animal that was battering his
[57:48] stomach. It bothered him all of his
[57:50] life. But the Lord told him it was just
[57:53] six inches long.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Six is six is the number of men.
[58:01] Six is a human number. Six is the number
[58:05] of time.
[58:07] Praise the Lord. And the seven will
[58:10] bring him his healing.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; So watch that seven. It's always a
[58:15] mystery.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the reason
[58:19] why after every seven years we we
[58:22] experience a major change in our life
[58:24] that we don't even understand because
[58:26] it's a mystery. We we are breaking into
[58:28] a new age and new things happening all
[58:30] in our mind, our body, everything.
[58:33] That's not where I want to go tonight.
[58:35] But I just have to stir myself up. Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; I just I just have to stir myself up
[58:41] tonight. So I will be going in in and
[58:43] out of uh wash the seven is always a
[58:47] mystery. Now this is the thing that
[58:50] caught my mind on this. That's the
[58:51] reason why I'm I'm saying this to you
[58:54] because as you read the word of God, as
[58:57] you read the message of the hour, uh uh
[59:00] I mean you can't know God by letters.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; God is known. The prophet of God said
[59:07] he's identified by what? his
[59:10] characteristics.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And one of God's characteristics is that
[59:18] he's the God of principle.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; You got to watch his principle.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The moment you see it, it will never
[59:24] lie.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It will never lie.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; He's the God of principle. Now, so on on
[59:33] on Sunday, uh uh time is not my friend
[59:36] yet. I have to run.
[59:39] Something I I really wanted to speak on
[59:41] tonight uh uh in bringing this to you,
[59:44] but I have to go through this for us to
[59:46] get there. And and what it is is that I
[59:49] was down in in uh uh uh Johannesburg
[59:53] this long long time that I that I I went
[59:55] away and I spoke on the subject and I I
[59:58] I I treated something and the Lord
[1:00:02] really bless it in a way that I have not
[1:00:04] dealt with that subject before.
[1:00:06] And I and I thought after the service I
[1:00:09] thought about it and I said well maybe
[1:00:11] when I get home I will review it. I
[1:00:13] spoke about it year before but in the
[1:00:16] way that the Lord bless it uh uh it was
[1:00:19] it was different. So I want to see if I
[1:00:21] can be able to go in that direction. If
[1:00:24] we don't do it today tonight we will
[1:00:26] finish it on Sunday. So, but on Sunday
[1:00:30] when we when we spoke, we dealt with the
[1:00:33] the wars of Isaiah chapter 5.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The wars of Isaiah chapter 5, which of
[1:00:41] course we we said that uh Isaiah were
[1:00:45] describing the the the the civilization
[1:00:50] that was supposed to come. Praise the
[1:00:52] Lord.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Woe unto them that build house upon
[1:00:56] house. war unto them that call good
[1:00:58] evil. War unto them that rise up early
[1:01:00] in the morning and they go after strong
[1:01:03] drinks. I mean, he he just he's
[1:01:05] prophesying. He's dealing with the
[1:01:07] culture. He's dealing with the the the
[1:01:10] present destructive h civilization.
[1:01:14] But now, watch it. Now, if you go back
[1:01:18] to Isaiah chapter 5, uh we don't have
[1:01:21] all the time to run after it, but if you
[1:01:23] pay attention on Sunday and you count
[1:01:26] those walls, they were six.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; If you count the walls, they were six.
[1:01:36] Wo unto them that join house to house.
[1:01:38] One, woe unto them that rise up early in
[1:01:40] the morning and go after strong drink.
[1:01:42] Two, woe unto them that drink iniquity.
[1:01:45] Three, woe unto them that call evil
[1:01:48] good. Four, woe unto them that are wise
[1:01:52] in their own eyes. Five, woe unto them
[1:01:56] that
[1:01:57] are mighty to drink wine. Six, where is
[1:02:00] the seven? It's always a mystery.
[1:02:03] The seven will come in the next chapter.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Whoa, it's me."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; That was the thing that just
[1:02:12] It just it it it just blew my mind.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; It just it just threw me. I mean, it it
[1:02:18] threw me against the wall.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I I said, "Oh my god."
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; A principle of redemption is right
[1:02:27] before my eyes.
[1:02:31] So I then went back and and and and I'
[1:02:33] I've listened to brother brand message I
[1:02:35] think just few days a couple of uh last
[1:02:38] week on his presence because he preached
[1:02:40] that message in September. So I I had to
[1:02:43] go back again. There was some things uh
[1:02:45] so I had to go back and listen to it
[1:02:47] again just to be able to pick up some
[1:02:50] few things. But that's where I want us
[1:02:52] to go tonight. That's what that's what I
[1:02:55] want to grab your attention tonight.
[1:02:57] We're not just coming to church just to
[1:02:59] be in church people. We are not just
[1:03:01] coming to church just to play religion.
[1:03:04] God is releasing his his his presence,
[1:03:08] his being to us.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; He's he's releasing himself to us. And
[1:03:13] if there is ever a time that we need
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; h God as a person is right now.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. right now with all the
[1:03:25] craziness that is that is that is going
[1:03:26] on in the world and especially in this
[1:03:29] nation with with all the the the the the
[1:03:33] religious things that is going on. I
[1:03:35] mean we we have to prepare ourself.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; We have to get a hold of God.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; We have a promise one of these days this
[1:03:42] church these churches those will be
[1:03:44] shut.
[1:03:46] I was just thinking about that when when
[1:03:48] uh when uh when I started showing to you
[1:03:50] in a scripture that churches begins from
[1:03:52] home. That was one of the thing that was
[1:03:54] in my mind. I wanted to go down that
[1:03:56] route. It begin uh uh in homes, it will
[1:04:00] end in homes because when the church's
[1:04:02] doors are shut, we will have to meet at
[1:04:04] homes.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] Because now unless you are preaching the
[1:04:19] revealed word, unless you are preaching
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ, you are so tempted to say
[1:04:25] something and you might be misunderstood
[1:04:27] by people on the on on on the internet
[1:04:29] and then pretty soon before you know
[1:04:31] they start running to your church to to
[1:04:32] put you in in in in handcuffs because I
[1:04:35] mean the whole society now is just so
[1:04:38] polarized.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; With everything that is happening.
[1:04:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:46] You could say something and not even
[1:04:49] trying to go in the way of politics or
[1:04:51] what is happening and and and and
[1:04:54] somebody will just misunderstand you and
[1:04:56] and then blow blow you on on on YouTube
[1:05:00] and make you saying that thing over and
[1:05:01] over and over and everybody that hear it
[1:05:04] don't even know you. They will start to
[1:05:06] hate you and and where is that place?
[1:05:08] Let's go down to that church and and out
[1:05:10] of there.
[1:05:12] But that's not what I'm talking tonight.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you tonight is
[1:05:16] that watch that seven
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; is always a mystery.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Even in your life.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Even in your life.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; The things that God will do, the things
[1:05:29] he will allow,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; wash that ser.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Because if you can wash it and grab it,
[1:05:37] you get the blessing.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You can be in the midst of it. If you
[1:05:42] don't see it, it does not mean anything
[1:05:44] to you.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Watch that. Seven is always a blessing.
[1:05:49] Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. So that's the thing that
[1:05:52] caught my mind here. Six walls. Isaiah
[1:05:56] spoke about uh uh uh talking about the
[1:05:59] the you know the the the society, the
[1:06:02] cosmos uh and and and you know the word
[1:06:05] because we what we were talking about is
[1:06:07] turn the word upside down. So we were
[1:06:09] looking at cosmo. We were trying to see
[1:06:12] how that the world was already upside
[1:06:14] down. These guys were just trying to
[1:06:16] bring it back to where it's supposed to
[1:06:18] be, the way that God wanted it to be.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So, so we were looking at that.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. now. So, uh uh but just
[1:06:29] just just thinking on that, just
[1:06:32] meditating on that, then uh it got to
[1:06:34] the place where my mind I was just I was
[1:06:37] just reading this and and I says, "Oh my
[1:06:39] god, I've not seen this. I read this. I
[1:06:42] preach preach uh message after message
[1:06:45] from here. I've not seen this until
[1:06:49] a couple of days when the Lord just uh
[1:06:51] now." So, that's what I want to go
[1:06:53] tonight. You know, that's what I want to
[1:06:54] go tonight. That's exactly where I want
[1:06:57] to go tonight. This is a prayer meeting.
[1:07:01] I will take the message uh uh the great
[1:07:03] commission. I'll take the message the
[1:07:05] great commission. Let's let's go
[1:07:07] quickly. If I have found grace in your
[1:07:09] sight, listen now. If I have found grace
[1:07:12] in your sight through God,
[1:07:15] you take my word for this, brethren.
[1:07:19] If you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:07:23] blessing, when a man has done you wrong
[1:07:27] and he's absolutely justly, I mean, he
[1:07:30] has done you wrong and you know, praise
[1:07:34] the Lord.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] And uh I was just thinking I was just
[1:07:41] thinking uh uh you know I was just
[1:07:45] thinking
[1:07:47] about what I just said
[1:07:50] uh and and what what was running to my
[1:07:52] mind is that it is always in a time of
[1:07:55] crisis
[1:07:57] you know when people start feeling you
[1:08:00] know the need of crisis that's when they
[1:08:03] start running to God.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I mean uh the churches will
[1:08:08] soon start getting full again because
[1:08:11] people will uh uh you know somebody says
[1:08:14] uh when
[1:08:17] u is is is is having trouble that's when
[1:08:19] man runs to the moon. The moon is a type
[1:08:23] of the church.
[1:08:25] So let's let's go ahead here. The
[1:08:28] prophet of God says if I found grace in
[1:08:31] your sight through God you take my word
[1:08:34] for this. If a man if a person if you if
[1:08:37] you want a blessing and get a blessing
[1:08:40] when when a person has done you wrong
[1:08:42] and he's absolutely wrong. I mean he has
[1:08:45] done you wrong and you know that he's
[1:08:48] done you wrong. He's done you evil.
[1:08:52] Don't mention that. You take him to
[1:08:54] prayer before God.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; He said take my word for this. If I if I
[1:09:03] mean anything to you,
[1:09:06] praise the Lord. I mean this this is
[1:09:08] just a a humble simple way to say if you
[1:09:11] consider me
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; to be anything to you,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; take my word for this.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; There there is there's something he say
[1:09:22] here. That's what I want to come to. He
[1:09:24] says if a man has done you wrong, don't
[1:09:27] mention that you take him to prayer
[1:09:30] before God. That is one of the difficult
[1:09:34] things to do.
[1:09:36] That is one of the difficult things to
[1:09:38] do.
[1:09:40] It's It's not him to do it,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; No, it's not him. God has to get a hold
[1:09:46] of you.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; For you to do this.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; It's not him to do it.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I will soon show you where it is now.
[1:09:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says uh and don't take it in a
[1:10:01] way of just a selfish and say well I'm
[1:10:05] supposed to do this but stand with your
[1:10:10] shoulder to his shoulder and stand in
[1:10:13] the presence of God our father
[1:10:19] where the prayer should be made in his
[1:10:21] presence and say father yes my brother
[1:10:24] or yes my sister he's justly he deserve
[1:10:27] punishment because he has done me evil
[1:10:30] and I don't see why he did it then let
[1:10:34] God go to talking to you allow God to
[1:10:39] talk to you now that's that's why I say
[1:10:41] is this thing is not human because the
[1:10:44] problem there is that many times when we
[1:10:47] say we feel sorry for people
[1:10:50] it is not
[1:10:52] it is not in a place of us having
[1:10:55] Compassion it is in a place of us having
[1:10:58] sympathy.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Now we've been taught compassion is the
[1:11:02] will of God.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; So if you approach it this way you will
[1:11:06] be having compassion on that person.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because most of the
[1:11:11] time when we when we when we say that we
[1:11:15] we feel sorry for a person, the way our
[1:11:18] mind channel been feeling sorry for a
[1:11:21] person is that is uh uh you know I I
[1:11:25] just wish that God will whip that person
[1:11:27] back.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; I just wish that God would really give
[1:11:31] it back to him 10 times that he did.
[1:11:35] That's the way we feel sorry for the
[1:11:36] person.
[1:11:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together now? So he says here and
[1:11:47] uh standing should I should stand in the
[1:11:48] present God our father. The way the
[1:11:51] prayer should be made say father yes my
[1:11:53] brother he's just he deserve to be
[1:11:55] punished. He's done me wrong. I don't
[1:11:57] see why he did it. Then let God go
[1:12:00] talking to you and you will see maybe we
[1:12:03] have read this before. We'll see. You
[1:12:05] will see maybe what that man has been
[1:12:08] through.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Now that's when you are coming to the
[1:12:15] place of having compassion for him
[1:12:19] because now you are beginning to step in
[1:12:22] his shoes. Now you are beginning to
[1:12:25] think, "Oh my god, how the devil is
[1:12:29] trying to destroy this my brother." You
[1:12:31] are no longer thinking about what he did
[1:12:34] to you, but you are thinking of how God
[1:12:37] is how the devil is about to destroy
[1:12:40] this man life and Satan purpose for this
[1:12:43] person is to send them to hell. You
[1:12:45] start getting so mad with the devil.
[1:12:47] You're not even thinking about what the
[1:12:49] person has done because now you are
[1:12:52] getting so mad that the devil has blind
[1:12:55] this guy. He can see that Satan is is is
[1:12:58] using him.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There you go.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Then let God go talking to you and you
[1:13:10] will see maybe what that man has been
[1:13:13] through. The devil has twist him up
[1:13:16] somewhere and caused him to do that.
[1:13:21] Though he's absolutely wrong,
[1:13:24] before you leave the throne of God, you
[1:13:28] will feel sorry for that man. Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; You will be sympathizing
[1:13:33] for that brother.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You'll be stepping in his shoes.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] He says, "And and and and when you get
[1:13:45] back down
[1:13:48] toward earth again, when you come out of
[1:13:51] prayer, when you come from out of
[1:13:53] prayer, which mean you have already
[1:13:57] broke the barrier of of of of getting
[1:14:00] over your frustration, you have broke
[1:14:02] the barriers of getting over all the
[1:14:04] thoughts that is going through your
[1:14:05] mind. You have broke the barrier of
[1:14:07] getting all over your emotions that you
[1:14:10] don't even know where you are. You so
[1:14:12] lost in the spirit. You are so mad with
[1:14:15] the devil and I mean you are just reing
[1:14:17] it down on Satan. You are a beast. You
[1:14:20] are a serpent. You are cursed from the
[1:14:22] beginning. I rebuke you. I mean you you
[1:14:24] are so much on the devil when you get
[1:14:26] back down to earthise.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; You will go over to that brother and
[1:14:34] shake his hands cuz you know what he has
[1:14:37] been through.
[1:14:39] You understand that it is just the devil
[1:14:42] that has messed this guy mind up. The
[1:14:46] devil has just messed this person up
[1:14:50] that they are they they are just they
[1:14:52] are just filled with uh with with person
[1:14:56] stuff from the devil in their mind and
[1:14:58] their spirit. I mean when you open their
[1:15:00] mouth you can just smell the breath of
[1:15:02] Satan.
[1:15:10] cuz you know what he has been through.
[1:15:13] You can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:15:15] presence of God and condemn anybody.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I don't believe no sir. Even if he is a
[1:15:23] ranked sinner,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; when you ever get into God's presence,
[1:15:30] we're coming into his presence now.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was where Isaiah got in
[1:15:36] chapter five. He could see the evil that
[1:15:40] was in the word. You know, word unto
[1:15:43] them that is doing rise of early. Wo
[1:15:45] unto them that is wise in their eyes. Wo
[1:15:47] unto them that are drunk. W onto them
[1:15:49] that are that are immoral. Woe unto them
[1:15:52] that are abominable. He could see all of
[1:15:54] that. But when he came into the presence
[1:15:57] of God,
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; when he came into the presence of God,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and he stepped beyond his mind, beyond
[1:16:08] his emotion,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; he couldn't see the destruction of the
[1:16:12] city or the pollution of the city, he
[1:16:15] could only see himself. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; He could only see himself and his need
[1:16:24] for God.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; When he's out there, he was seen uh the
[1:16:28] world is evil. He's righteous. But when
[1:16:30] he gets in the presence of God,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; he see his need
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; for God.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] Even if he's a ranked sinner,
[1:16:49] you can stand with any mortal in the
[1:16:51] presence of God and condemn them.
[1:17:01] how it's so easy for us to to uh forget
[1:17:04] these things. You know, we can we can
[1:17:08] forget forget about it. When we when we
[1:17:11] say we forget about something, we we
[1:17:13] pack it nicely
[1:17:16] and forget about it.
[1:17:20] You pack it and keep it to the place
[1:17:22] where nobody will touch it. When you're
[1:17:24] ready, you go pick it up again.
[1:17:33] Praise the Lord. Watch that seven.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; When When Isaiah broke into that
[1:17:41] principle, it changed his life forever.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; When he broke into that principle,
[1:17:50] it changed his life forever. His life
[1:17:53] was not the same. Read Isaiah 1:5
[1:17:57] and after chapter 6 read the rest of
[1:18:00] Isaiah is completely different his
[1:18:04] ministry change
[1:18:06] the things that he begin to see
[1:18:09] right in chapter 7 he saw 700 years
[1:18:14] telling Ahaz I gave you a sign ask God
[1:18:17] for the sign he said no I can't ask God
[1:18:19] he said is there anything too hard for
[1:18:20] the Lord asking for the sign behold a
[1:18:22] virgin shall conceive let me tell you
[1:18:24] Now let me give you a sign. If God will
[1:18:26] make a virgin to conceive,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; it changed his life. It changed his
[1:18:33] ministry. He was no longer looking at
[1:18:36] the filthiness around him. He was break
[1:18:39] into a vision, looking at the promise,
[1:18:42] looking at the millennium, Isaiah 53. He
[1:18:45] was looking at Calvary. I mean, he was
[1:18:47] he has he he has gone.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Why? because he broke into a he broke
[1:18:53] into a principle of God. Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] Our sight is is uh all we can see is as
[1:19:18] far as our nose.
[1:19:22] That's why we quick to condemn. And
[1:19:24] that's why we quick to criticize because
[1:19:26] it's just right our nose.
[1:19:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] I wanted to say something but I should
[1:19:39] just skip it.
[1:19:41] Go ahead with this.
[1:19:44] No. So that's that's what is bringing us
[1:19:46] to the subject. And I'm not going into
[1:19:48] the mysteries or nothing like that, but
[1:19:49] I just took this because it's a
[1:19:51] principle that never fail.
[1:19:55] It never fail.
[1:19:57] You can take it all through the
[1:19:59] scripture. It never fail.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] When Ruth took the courage and broke
[1:20:16] into the field of
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Bo,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; when she took the courage and Moab gale
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; took the courage to break into the field
[1:20:27] that field the field of the harvest
[1:20:30] was a was gathering with men that have
[1:20:33] drunk and they were drunk.
[1:20:36] They have drank all night.
[1:20:39] They are rejoicing over the harvest.
[1:20:46] It was a place for una boys. Girls were
[1:20:48] not invited.
[1:20:50] But she took the courage.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Because she wanted something from the
[1:20:56] Lord.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; She brave herself to sneak that nobody
[1:21:02] will see her.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] How will she be able to identify Boas
[1:21:12] among all these drunky men?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; She had to be tipping over her toe,
[1:21:21] dashing down and and and you know,
[1:21:23] holding her breath so nobody can hear
[1:21:25] her breathing even when the guys came
[1:21:27] closer.
[1:21:30] But then when she got there and she was
[1:21:33] able to find boys,
[1:21:37] she cover herself with his skirt.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get to that.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; She used his skirt at the end of uh of
[1:21:48] and and she just cover herself.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; When Boaz realized,
[1:21:54] Amen.
[1:21:56] He got a a feeling a stranger is in my
[1:21:59] tent.
[1:22:02] The Bible says he commanded his men to
[1:22:06] give her six ballet loath.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; He gave her six. One, two, three, six.
[1:22:15] It's because the seven was a mystery.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; The seven was himself.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. He never failed.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; The servant was himself.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He knew that it was time to redeem this
[1:22:34] woman.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; She needed redemption.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Watch the seven. It never failed.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; So, yes. Yes. Isaiah here. Isaiah, he's
[1:22:52] he's breaking into this place here where
[1:22:54] the uh uh uh uh you know uh can use he
[1:22:59] got it into the temple. And I mean this
[1:23:02] guy pouring out his heart before God, he
[1:23:04] don't even know where to begin from.
[1:23:08] But he got a principle from God.
[1:23:12] Not even having the revelation of this
[1:23:14] thing. I think he never even knew the
[1:23:17] seven. He didn't even know that. Praise
[1:23:20] the Lord.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; But he stepped right into it.
[1:23:25] He stepped right into it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And sometimes that is the way with our
[1:23:33] life.
[1:23:35] You can walk right into the into the
[1:23:38] seven seals and don't even know it.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; But because you have stepped into it,
[1:23:42] God is going to bless you.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are stepped into a
[1:23:50] place with God.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says right there the h
[1:23:59] where is this guy name? Kenas.
[1:24:03] Kena was just doing what he was doing.
[1:24:08] But he did it one more time and God says
[1:24:11] your arm has reached up to me.
[1:24:17] He was just doing what he was doing.
[1:24:21] He was not publicizing it on Facebook or
[1:24:24] going on on on YouTube or Instagram,
[1:24:27] nothing. He was just doing the Bible
[1:24:29] says he was a man that gave arms.
[1:24:32] But there was one more time he did it.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; An angel came down
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; and say, "Your arms has reached out to
[1:24:40] me."
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; One more time he did it.
[1:24:48] He broke into a seven seal. Whenever you
[1:24:51] get into the presence of angels,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; you are in the seven semen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[1:25:08] It's always a mystery.
[1:25:11] Now, so we see uh you know, he he gets
[1:25:15] to that place and and and he says,
[1:25:17] "Lord, woe is me.
[1:25:19] I'm a man or dumb. You just watch that."
[1:25:23] He did not he did not talk about the
[1:25:25] president. He didn't talk about the king
[1:25:27] and say, "Oh, you didn't talk nothing."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:25:41] that Lord, this is my time.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I'm the one in need of prayer. I'm the
[1:25:47] one that need to be changed. I'm the one
[1:25:49] that needs help.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that needs deliverance.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God, one of the
[1:25:57] angels took a coat of fire
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; from off the altar,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; come and touch his lip.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Say, "Your lip is clean and your
[1:26:07] iniquity are forgiven." Yeah,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; it changed his life. It was almost like
[1:26:12] Jesus saying to that woman, "Go and sin
[1:26:15] no more." It was not a commandment.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; It was an instruction. It's two
[1:26:21] different things.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has taken the sin desire
[1:26:28] out of her and said, "Go even if you
[1:26:30] try, you will never sin again."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It was not an instruction
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; or a commandment. He was instructing
[1:26:37] her. Yeah,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; something has happened to you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; When I wrote it on the ground, I wrote
[1:26:43] everything that was in you on the
[1:26:44] ground. I raised it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; God, even if you try, you will never
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; says, "I gave you water. You never come
[1:26:53] back to this place again."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. She thought it was just
[1:26:56] a casual conversation. But that word was
[1:26:59] a word of eternal life. It was a word
[1:27:02] that could go through her body and
[1:27:03] change her desire.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. the very people she was ashamed to
[1:27:09] run and walk before. She went all in the
[1:27:11] city. Come and see the man that told me
[1:27:13] the things that I have done.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was power in the word
[1:27:18] to change her life that very moment.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; She didn't need to go through all your
[1:27:23] seven step and 12 steps.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together tonight? Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Now, see what brother Brandon was saying
[1:27:37] here. I'll leave the rest with you.
[1:27:39] Amen. See what he will say. He says uh
[1:27:42] in Revelation chapter 4 uh uh uh uh uh
[1:27:46] uh throne of mercy message. He says,
[1:27:49] "Now listen, in a year that Yuzia King
[1:27:53] died, I I saw also the Lord sitting upon
[1:27:56] the throne high and lifted up and his
[1:27:59] train filled the temple glory." What?
[1:28:02] His dream.
[1:28:04] There it is. What is his dream?
[1:28:08] He says angels
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; being
[1:28:13] his tree that follow him.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So there were two sets of angels.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted you to pay
[1:28:22] attention to
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; because the trains were not the
[1:28:26] saraphins.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; the train was the cherubim. Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; It was not the saraphins.
[1:28:44] See what he was says here. He says uh uh
[1:28:47] uh uh his train. There it is. Angels
[1:28:51] being his train that follow him. The the
[1:28:55] train
[1:28:56] the trains what come behind.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:00] Okay. The train is what come behind. Are
[1:29:03] we together?
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Train is what come behind. His train
[1:29:09] filled the temple. Now watch the what he
[1:29:12] says. And above it stole the seraphim.
[1:29:18] And each of them had six wings. Praise
[1:29:22] the Lord. Yeah.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; So this was the complete throne of God
[1:29:28] because the seraphims are the one that
[1:29:30] are responsible for prayers and praises.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; But the train is the god to the throne.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; We you we will go on a little bit here
[1:29:43] and see and see what he says here in the
[1:29:46] message influence of another. He said,
[1:29:47] "Notice, Asa know that he must find
[1:29:51] something different."
[1:29:53] So what he did? What did he do? He went
[1:29:57] to the temple.
[1:29:59] He uh he raised up his hands and he
[1:30:02] cried to God
[1:30:04] and he fell into a vision.
[1:30:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You people that don't like crying, I
[1:30:12] don't know how how it's going to happen
[1:30:13] to you.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You know, he cried to God. He fell in
[1:30:16] the vision. And as he fell into the
[1:30:19] vision, he saw God not on a thrown down
[1:30:23] year, but lifted up way up. Oh mine, his
[1:30:27] tree was following him and and lifted up
[1:30:32] into
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's Wednesday night. It's almost 5
[1:30:41] minutes to 9:00. Don't get me to stop
[1:30:43] preaching now. Amen. Don't get me to
[1:30:46] stop preaching. Hallelujah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just feeling so good tonight. Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; A train that follow him and and and and
[1:30:54] lifted up into heavens and he saw back
[1:30:58] and forth through the temple saraph
[1:31:00] flying. And so what brother Brandham is
[1:31:03] eluding here told is that is that Isaiah
[1:31:07] was caught up into the constellation.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why he's ill yet
[1:31:15] told when he sees this he says here uh
[1:31:18] uh uh where am I praise the lord
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; follow him lifted up in and he saw back
[1:31:27] and for through the temple saraphin
[1:31:29] frying oh mine sarin it means burner the
[1:31:32] word saraphim means burner
[1:31:35] uh uh which is next to the altar
[1:31:38] actually the saraphins is the one who
[1:31:41] received the sacrifice and cleanses the
[1:31:44] wor the the worshippers and then present
[1:31:46] him to God. The saraphene does that. Now
[1:31:49] this saraphene was angelic being and
[1:31:52] they are very next one to God right at
[1:31:56] the altar.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God and and God want to bring
[1:32:13] every one of us into that place.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; This the the the woman at the word she
[1:32:19] never she never calculated.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; She never calculated because it is it is
[1:32:24] God unwritten principle.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; The same reason why God had to work six
[1:32:33] day and rest seven. That very same
[1:32:37] reason. the same reason why he had to do
[1:32:39] that. Wrongs all the time.
[1:32:45] It's the same reason why uh uh he
[1:32:47] allowed six men in the in that woman's
[1:32:50] life and then at the seventh he came on
[1:32:52] the scene.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That's the same reason why he allowed
[1:32:59] Boaz under inspiration gave her six B
[1:33:02] low because the next day Boaz is going
[1:33:05] to redeem her.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] Yeah,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; these are divine principles.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; They are divine principles. We said all
[1:33:16] of these things, we hear them, they
[1:33:18] become so common to us.
[1:33:23] That's what brother Brian is saying
[1:33:25] here. If you consider me to be anything,
[1:33:27] take this from me.
[1:33:34] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:40] Now, so we see here uh uh
[1:33:45] we see uh I I mean I've I've already uh
[1:33:48] uh gone through my time here and uh uh
[1:33:55] let's let's just see if we can we can be
[1:33:57] able to to uh do something here before
[1:34:02] we we go home. And uh really what I
[1:34:05] wanted to bring to you is is that
[1:34:07] principle so you can see it is is for
[1:34:10] you so so you can be aware of it.
[1:34:15] So you can be aware of it. If you listen
[1:34:18] to the message, the winds of the snow
[1:34:20] white do brother even experienced that.
[1:34:22] God gave him that vision of that animal
[1:34:25] many years back. But just at the time
[1:34:29] where his healing would come, God
[1:34:31] brought the vision back to his mind. He
[1:34:34] said, remember in the vision it was only
[1:34:38] 6 in long.
[1:34:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:44] And no matter what we go through in this
[1:34:46] life is just 6 in long.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's God's
[1:34:54] measurement.
[1:34:58] You might think your trial is in just 6
[1:35:00] in. It it have to be in human time. It
[1:35:04] never goes beyond human time.
[1:35:09] It never goes beyond human time. God's
[1:35:12] that's God's length to be able to to to
[1:35:15] measure your sickness, measure your
[1:35:18] sorrow, measure your pain is just 6 in
[1:35:21] long.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why we have a 6,000
[1:35:29] years time span on earth. The seven is a
[1:35:32] mystery, a millennium.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:40] The seven is a millennium.
[1:35:44] It's a principle.
[1:35:52] You have to see it.
[1:35:56] You have to believe it.
[1:36:04] You know because sometimes what what
[1:36:06] happened to us is that we we we get to
[1:36:08] this place where we we we get we get to
[1:36:11] to to to soon you know running our mind
[1:36:14] exercising our mind. So what happened is
[1:36:16] that uh you start to think okay it's
[1:36:19] it's uh it's three years I've been going
[1:36:22] through this now.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So you counting for for seven years
[1:36:27] that's your time. That's not God's time.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Maybe in God's time you
[1:36:33] have you are just at the end of your
[1:36:35] six.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; The thing about it there is that he
[1:36:44] don't want to work on your calendar. He
[1:36:47] want you to believe
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; that this is his principle.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; If you believe that God is your internal
[1:36:55] principle.
[1:36:56] So it gave you faith to know that
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; when the seventh comes, you will break
[1:37:03] into the mystery.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; You will understand the mystery of your
[1:37:07] trials.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; You will understand the mystery of your
[1:37:11] pains.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Don't put God on your watch or put him
[1:37:15] on your calendar.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You are just giving the devil room to
[1:37:22] mess your mind up because now you finish
[1:37:24] counting seven. Nothing happened.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I told I thought the servant is a
[1:37:29] mystery. My owner servant is dark.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; It's because you are on your you are you
[1:37:35] on your time. You're not on God's time.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe to God you just maybe to God you
[1:37:42] have not even started yet.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So it's a principle.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's not a time principle. It's a divine
[1:37:53] principle. Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's almost like when
[1:37:59] Moses said, you know, uh uh uh uh uh
[1:38:02] when when you when you when you catch
[1:38:03] the man that that steal uh uh uh a
[1:38:07] sheep, you can't catch him. You can't
[1:38:10] catch him. There is no way you can catch
[1:38:12] you can't catch the devil.
[1:38:15] No, you can't catch him. This guy is
[1:38:18] sneaky.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is one that can
[1:38:22] catch him. Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is one that can
[1:38:28] catch it
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; because we go through those exercise.
[1:38:36] Oh, you know I I I grab the devil. You
[1:38:39] have to restore. The Bible say you will
[1:38:41] restore res.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; It's a divine principle. And what God
[1:38:47] want you to do is to believe it.
[1:38:54] is to believe it
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; that Lord you gave these principles
[1:39:00] for us for our benefit and as I see it
[1:39:03] in your word is playing out in your word
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; how many servants came to Job the Bible
[1:39:12] says the first one come say your
[1:39:13] children are done the second one come
[1:39:15] how many counted four
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; so right in There
[1:39:23] a principle of restoration,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; a seed of restoration was already sown.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; But then how many years did it take take
[1:39:40] God to to to to redeem Job? 14 years.
[1:39:49] But the principle will never fail. It
[1:39:52] will never fail.
[1:39:56] God say I will restore all that the pa
[1:39:59] want the the kanga one the caterpillar
[1:40:02] the locust.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; When it goes through those four stages I
[1:40:07] will restore.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you go through justification,
[1:40:12] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:40:15] Ghost, the Holy Ghost himself, I will
[1:40:17] restore.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; God is not restoring your physical body.
[1:40:24] David said, "Restore my soul."
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; When you go through those experience,
[1:40:33] then God is bringing consciousness to
[1:40:36] your soul.
[1:40:39] You start to walk with God from the rim
[1:40:41] of your soul, not your mind, not your
[1:40:43] eyes,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; now your environment,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; your soul has stepped up in the place.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say in a walk with God, it
[1:40:51] was not a physical feat. No, he have got
[1:40:54] into a realm where he started believing
[1:40:56] God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; He could walk with God into the future.
[1:41:00] That's the reason why he could prophesy
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; and talk about the judgment in the end.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. SL
[1:41:09] tonight.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come.
[1:41:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; My work is just to just to be able to to
[1:41:26] arm you, give you things for you to use.
[1:41:29] I don't know how to entertain.
[1:41:32] Amen. Because I'm not just a funny guy.
[1:41:38] But I just come up with all of these
[1:41:40] little message by the by, you know, by
[1:41:42] the the the, you know, the the the
[1:41:45] inspiration of the Holy Ghost just to,
[1:41:47] you know, uh uh
[1:41:50] uh
[1:41:54] just to be able to encourage you. Praise
[1:41:58] the Lord.
[1:42:00] Love the Lord tonight.
[1:42:04] Are we grateful
[1:42:06] that God said watch that seven? You know
[1:42:09] the thing about it then is that it is
[1:42:12] God that is watching your seven.
[1:42:15] He's watching when you come into the
[1:42:17] seven when you will come into the
[1:42:19] seventh cycle.
[1:42:24] Pray for me. Just hold this thought. We
[1:42:27] will go we will go there on Sunday
[1:42:30] because where I want to get to here is
[1:42:32] is to is to just show you uh the benefit
[1:42:35] of what what God has given to us in this
[1:42:39] last day.
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:42:50] Heavenly Father, the hour is late. Lord,
[1:42:54] the hour is late.
[1:42:58] More than 50 years. More than 50 years
[1:43:03] going on Lord God to 50 plus stay
[1:43:06] counting
[1:43:09] since your servant the prophet
[1:43:13] left Lord.
[1:43:16] Your word has been here. We have made
[1:43:18] doctrine out of it. We have made forces
[1:43:21] division. But Lord these were divine
[1:43:24] principles.
[1:43:25] that you give to us for this hour that
[1:43:28] we are living in.
[1:43:33] That's why your prophet would tell us
[1:43:35] over and over, you never ask us to
[1:43:37] understand. You ask us to believe.
[1:43:41] When we see a principle and we see what
[1:43:43] you have done in your word, let's
[1:43:45] believe that that same God,
[1:43:50] that same God
[1:43:55] that could change Sarah body.
[1:43:57] That same God is here tonight.
[1:44:01] That same God
[1:44:04] that could come down in a furnace fire
[1:44:09] that the burning flame
[1:44:11] will not even burn the clothes on those
[1:44:13] Hebrew boys that same God is here
[1:44:16] tonight. If we see those things, they
[1:44:18] are not just Bible stories. They are
[1:44:21] reality. raise our faith, Lord. Let's
[1:44:25] get away from all this uh religious
[1:44:28] spirit and church playing. Let's let's
[1:44:30] go in just like Isaiah. Getting away,
[1:44:34] Father, from uh uh uh just learning how
[1:44:38] to criticize and just gossiping and and
[1:44:40] and and forcing and and just going into
[1:44:44] that chamber and say, "Wo is me, Lord.
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:49] I'm a man of unclean lips.
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:55] I'm the man of cleanings.
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:01] Father,
[1:45:02] you know how long we will have to be
[1:45:04] here.
[1:45:07] You know exactly the meaning, the second
[1:45:09] to the rapture.
[1:45:12] Father, you know the the exact time, oh
[1:45:14] God, where we will step into our
[1:45:17] servant,
[1:45:19] where we will step into our mystery.
[1:45:23] You know, Father, Lord, that exact
[1:45:25] moment, it does not come, it's not by
[1:45:27] power or by might. It does not come by
[1:45:30] our hard work. It does not come by our
[1:45:33] smartness.
[1:45:34] It comes by our surrounding to you.
[1:45:39] It comes. I believe Asia went to the
[1:45:41] temple that day frustrated. His good
[1:45:44] friend is dead. He don't know what to
[1:45:46] do.
[1:45:48] But he realized that he needed you. He
[1:45:50] needed something to change.
[1:45:53] He can't continue this way.
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:01] Father,
[1:46:05] you know all Lord God that we become of
[1:46:07] this uh local assembly.
[1:46:13] We can we are doing the best that we
[1:46:15] know how to do, Father, to be able to
[1:46:18] encourage your people
[1:46:21] to be able to lead them, Lord.
[1:46:26] Father,
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:31] we're looking forward to God. Father,
[1:46:33] Lord God,
[1:46:36] we are watching that seven is a mystery.
[1:46:41] I don't know how many
[1:46:44] I don't know the number where we are. I
[1:46:46] can only wish that Lord Father, we are
[1:46:48] in the number of grace.
[1:46:51] I can only wish that Lord God this
[1:46:53] assembly has gone through deliverance.
[1:46:57] Father, maybe we are in the six Lord
[1:47:00] with all our human
[1:47:02] errors and failures just playing around
[1:47:05] us Lord and and we are becoming not very
[1:47:08] concerned.
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:11] But when the seventh come on the scene,
[1:47:14] it's a mystery.
[1:47:17] You brought it for every man in the
[1:47:19] Bible. You brought it for the woman at
[1:47:21] the word. You brought it Lord God for
[1:47:22] now for for Ruth for now me. You're
[1:47:25] going to bring it for us Lord.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:30] I pray that God you bless us Lord. Bless
[1:47:32] your children. Oh Father God as we as we
[1:47:35] go home and the rest of the week
[1:47:38] everything we be going about to do. I
[1:47:41] pray that God you will keep each and
[1:47:42] every one of us. Oh father
[1:47:46] bless your people in their home. Lord,
[1:47:48] if there is any house of God, Father,
[1:47:51] that is struggling, Lord God, we pray
[1:47:54] that oh Father God,
[1:47:57] may they be lifted up, Lord God, out of
[1:48:00] whatever, Lord Jesus,
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:05] bring us to that place in our prayer
[1:48:06] life, oh God, our commitment, our
[1:48:09] devotion to you.
[1:48:12] I pray Lord Jesus.
[1:48:17] Father we ask for strength Lord.
[1:48:20] We ask for strength oh God.
[1:48:24] And oh you bring us to that place Lord
[1:48:26] Jesus where all our childishness and
[1:48:28] foolishness will be gone away.
[1:48:31] And very soon we will know that Father
[1:48:33] God it is for this reason you have us to
[1:48:37] be here.
[1:48:40] We love you tonight. We love you
[1:48:42] tonight. Father,
[1:48:46] I wish that Lord I know that God,
[1:48:48] Father, your children know, Lord God, we
[1:48:51] don't come here to play games. Lord,
[1:48:55] we come so you can make yourself known
[1:48:57] to us.
[1:48:59] We want to break into something. Lord,
[1:49:01] the prophet said the dynamics of this
[1:49:04] church will be the outpouring of the
[1:49:06] Holy Ghost. Oh, give it to us, Father.
[1:49:09] Give it to us where the young people
[1:49:11] will experience the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[1:49:13] our little children, Father God,
[1:49:16] something that would just be so real to
[1:49:18] them. Oh God,
[1:49:22] we love you tonight. We love you
[1:49:25] tonight, Father.
[1:49:28] We love you tonight. Oh, we love you
[1:49:31] tonight, sweet Jesus.
[1:49:34] We love you tonight.
[1:49:38] come and go with us now, Lord. Father,
[1:49:40] those that are traveling,
[1:49:43] Father, Lord, carry us safely.
[1:49:46] Bless the rest of the week
