blessed be your name bless the rest of the service this evening in jesus name amen amen amen the lord bless you tonight it's going to be in the house of the lord and it's 10 minutes after 8. let's just take our bibles praise the lord let's take our bibles we've been we've been reading uh um a little bit here we've been kind of a dwelling on uh uh second king chapter four the sheminate woman any larger there is something that i'm i'm believing that the holy spirit will be able to bring out of there for us i don't seem to feel there is just something dwelling in there but we want to talk a little bit on the inspiration of the almighty uh that's that's why we we we started talking on oh my goodness i know i did something tonight uh i will sound people i just i just have one one code to share so let me send it back there and you can get it up for us tonight okay it's on this way and uh second samuel chapter four second samuel chapter four we will read from verse eighteen second samuel chapter four or even verse eighteen uh praise the lord amen that's the second samuel chapter four okay okay second king chapter four second kings chapter four you know why i said second samuel chapter four i will tell you why i'll tell you why i was dwelling on the on the scripture uh uh i was dwelling on the scripture from david that was on my mind that's what i wanted to read but i felt like i would bring it in at the right time so second kings chapter four let's read from verse 18 i see uh uh a visitor in our gates sitting back there uh good to have you visiting with us if you would just join us saying for the reading of the word we just appreciate you being with us this evening uh verse 18 and when the child was grown a fair on a day that he went out so his father told the reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to the lad carry him to his mother one of the young men in the field and when he he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees at noon and then die it appeared like it was uh uh kind of for early morning sunstroke or something like that but uh the little boy died and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god shut the door upon him and went out the lord bless you you may have your seed as we continue to read but i'm thinking here that she told her husband but because it don't looks like she told her husband amen let's just get into the drama of this uh chapter it don't appear like you would soon see that it don't appear like she told her husband they bought shots on her knees and died almost like he fall asleep praise the lord and she knew because he was not breathing but she took him in the kind and quietness into the prophet's room lay the boy on the bed of the prophet took the key to make sure that nobody go in there and lock the door praise the lord shut the door and went out she called unto her husband and said send me i pray dee she called to her husband and says our son has died no she called to her husband and she said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the isis that i may run to the man of god and come again and he said wherefore will thy go unto him so he did not even knew that his son has died now my question this was before the holy ghost and this woman was not even a jewish woman she was a gentile woman praise the lord this was before what what was it that gave her such a compulsion what was it inspiration praise the lord inspiration when peter said lord if it is you be me come he was he was inspired to go and meet the lord he never thought he did not reason in his mind that oh our lord is walking on water no he said lord if it is you build me come when he got out of the inspiration then he started to sink and he said wherefore will that go to him today it is neither new moon non-saber and she said it shall be well praise the lord you mean that this man has lived all of his life or much of his life with this woman and he he can tell that she's in a moon in in in a ceremony you mean that he can tell sure praise the lord certainly he knew that she want to go and see the prophet for something but this is the matter of life and death this is the my the model of losing her only beloved son the only child that she have ever had praise the lord amen what is it that takes over that takes over this is not mind over matter it's not mine it's not you figuring it out right this is word inspiration this is word when the breath of god when when the when the holy ghost possess a person you behave stupid to the natural mind the same thing of david you know inspiration took him to see the act of the covenant coming back he draw he throw his priestly robe down and and and i mean he just he just got down to worshiping they never he never care what who says what amen who says what complain or you want to complain criticize all you want to criticize you see that's what happened inspiration do not consider criticisms amen don't even know that praise the lord amen do you know what will happen here tonight if inspiration take hold of every one of us oh my goodness praise the lord people will be smiling laughing hallelujah lifting up your hands the lord you will not even know how much time we have been here it will not matter to you when we leave from here it's a word by itself praise the lord it's a word when when uh when the prophet of god said that you can create a word and go and live in it you know that's how you can create it it's not it's not you imagining it you create that word by faith amen the word struck you you are reading something in the word instructs you my goodness oh wow i've not seen this i think there is something in john that is related to this then you go and read john i think peter said this and then you go i mean you are just doing that and before you realize two hours has passed it's a word of inspiration praise the lord amen the thing that makes a uh uh a believer gets down on their knees and he just starts singing one song to another song and they say lord i thank you and and just keep praising god and the thing about god goodness and they start crying and then they sing another song they keep praying and you just get lost of time praise the lord it's a word where the invisible god dwars amen is a word that makes the invisible god visible to you it makes the invisible god visible to you praise the lord let's continue to read you verse 24 then she saddled and asked and he said on 207 drive and go forward slack net they're riding for me except a baby so she went and came unto the man of god to my candle and and it came to pass when the man of god saw her far off he said unto gaza he seven behold yonder is that sheminite run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with the husband is it well with thy son and she answered it is well praise the lord praise the lord you know you see what inspiration will do when inspiration comes on the person when the word that you believe possess your body it takes over your human emotion a natural person will first make that man to know give him a peace of mind that's what a natural person would do i would give you a peace of mind a piece of my mind praise the lord all you fake pastors fake preachers and you just you just go express yourself praise the lord but when the words you believe possess your body praise the lord it takes over your fear it takes over your anger praise the lord the situation that should make you better and make you all filled with complex it takes it away it's beautiful when we look at this together tonight and trust that the lord will will will will minister to us let's continue to read and she answered it's all well and when she came to the man of god now she answered geiser when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet praise the lord and gaza came now to trust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and lord have hated from me and have not told me then she said did i desire a son of my lord then i did not i say do not deceive me then he said to get his get of the lands and take my staff now when she said that she have not said anything yet as the boy being dead but elijah elijah could pick up by her supplication that something has happened amen so she he he takes his staff and and says you know go gold and he called uh uh geheza oh i'm reading some words now and he said yes get up their lungs take my staff in the hand and go that way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any saluting answer him not again do you see a parlor of the same behavior of the woman praise the lord she didn't even get into conversation so it shows a sense of urgency amen a man that is burdened with the lord don't have time to argue with people and satisfy people's opinion this is what i think what you think about this and and and you know no only gimmicks do that brother and say gimmicks are the people that have answers to every question sure a man that is on the mission for god he's burdened with what god tells him to do and he goes and do it are we together lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as long as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee praise the lord but branham said on that verse he says the woman of faith was not in the staff the woman of faith was in the prophet praise the lord so she never got emotion and says well i will follow you uh uh i guess let's go i will direct you nope right she was certain she knew what she wanted her faith was in the in in the in in the prophet her faith and look at the expression here as the lord god live it as the lord your god live it amen and as your soul live it living now it shows that the confidence that that was the reason why the woman never had an attitude that was the reason why she was not disrespectful because it shows that she has come to a level of confidence she she have come to a level of confidence where she can overlook the the man's mistake because she knows that in his soul he's genuine and that's the place where the church has failed praise the lord let's let god start to use a man we deify him and when he makes a mistake we demonize him amen oh we deify him that brother his ministry is special who made that you know we we just set him like that it's all in the mind and as soon as he makes a mistake we turn around 360. and we make him a demon he bound to hell he is and we just say all sorts of things from our mouth who even know the kind of a life he's living but it shows that the confidence of this woman and i believe that's the reason why it pleased almighty god to put this in the text of the bible yes not just to give us a story for us to amuse ourselves but it shows that the confidence that this woman had was not in the ability of the prophet was not in the way he looks not in the way he dress her confidence was in his sword to know that from the inside he's genuine and genuine people from the inside makes mistake on the outside praise the lord that's the reason why brother branham says you have to pray before you choose a pastor you know why you have to pray because you are dealing with a man that is born insane right a man that has all sorts of mistakes praise the lord this is not part of my notes i don't know why i'm going this way but it's okay amen you know uh the reason why you have to pray because there has to be something that uncles you it's the same thing as a man looking for the wife you have to pray amen because uh uh i mean uh you know you can have more than one wife you only have to choose one and just like a woman you are praying for the husband you are you have to pray that's why you have to take it serious you have to know that it's life and death for you it's not fun to just leave it in haircut the way he talked to me and all of those things that life and death it can even either start your heaven here or your health begins there have to be something that anchors you something that you have seen and you say i've i've i trust this man praise the lord amen and as soon as you come to that place to say i trust this man then now the tests begin then now the tests begin and the different things start happening praise the lord but we're talking about inspiration i'm just i'm just trying to show you when inspiration takes over now you you realize that it's when the word possesses possesses a person praise the lord amen the bible says in the moment in the twinkling of an eye the word that is prophesied in the bible we capture your body amen you taking your flight it will be the world that will capture your body enoch you know kept meditating on the word that god you know the word became so real to him until it captured it lift him off of the earth that's how the rapture that's the reason why the rapture is not by chance the rapture is a process it's a group of people that are engaging in the word you know they are loving the word they are meditating they are moving in the word it's not you that is neglecting the word you don't read the word you don't you you have no connection with the word how are you going to be raptured it's not by chance it's not by chance so then you would just be there and then you would just be raptured no you are in fellowship you are in connection with this word you are thinking about the word it's on your mind it's part of your life you ask the word shall i do it or should i not do it [Music] praise the lord people that want to go in the rapture they are not ready for the rapture yet they are just afraid to go to hell they really don't want to go in the rapture they are afraid of going to hell but yet they want to be lucky to be cut away elijah told elisha if you see me in goring he have to keep his eyes on elijah yeah everything he's doing he has to be he he has to be so conscious where is he because that was the only way he will have the double portion it's not well you know okay i will see you i will see you at i want to double push somebody you know i'll be back next week praise the lord elisha you have i i don't know if i will be there this morning but i want a double potion praise the lord the sons of the prophet knew elijah was going they knew they heard the word they knew that he was going but there was nothing in them [Music] to get them interested in the rapture that's how people are they want to go in the rapture but they are not interested in the rapture they are not interested but they want to go they are not interested they have so much time on their hands for what they want to do in this life they have less time for the rapture but i want to go amen i want to go but you know i get so much to do but i want to go i hope i can make it are we together praise the lord oh my the god of the almighty we we started this talk a little bit and we talked about how inspiration is the breath of god and god do not have no bad birth praise the lord god do not have no bad breath oh man that thing hit my mind this afternoon i said glory be to god praise the lord you know job was the one that said his wife turned away from his birth you know and and and you know he was he was all so up and and and never even had the strength to brush his mouth and now she's you know the the man that she loved and slept by the nanny she can't even stand the breath from his mouth but i'm here to tell you tonight that god don't have no bad breath there is no bad birth from almighty god praise the lord amen god don't have no bad breath praise the lord are we together tonight amen so the reason why this is important the reason why this is important that we have to realize is that just like i said as we as we get as we get close to the rapture which of course we are getting close to the rapture we are we are in the sequence of the rapture with everything that is happening around us the opening of the word and all of that the people of god the the bride of jesus christ is going to take on uh a similar characteristics like this woman amen she's going to be like paul said sons of god are led by the spirit of god she's going to move slowly into the realm of inspiration you see but inspiration is not what we made up praise the lord it's not why we met up well you know i was sitting there and something just came over me i don't know why i did it something just came over me and i just did it that's not inspiration praise the lord that's not inspiration inspiration is by the word of god inspiration foundation is the word of god if there is nothing in the world that says that it's not inspiration you might have been inspired by the wrong spirit sure praise the lord amen and and and and and what i want to say and as i talk about this is it's very important it's very important the reason why it's important is because as we come to church tonight and you sit in the pills and i come and preach to you tonight or anybody that comes behind this puppet to preach now if if my vessel is not consecrated and devoted to to be able to preach to you tonight i can say a lot of things to convince you that this message is true you hear what brother cop said on on on sunday but brother brown and abraham lincoln you got to believe that i can say all of those things your soul will not feed on it you see so that is it's not games that we are playing that's what the prophet of god says no man must come behind the sacred this until he has spent time with god it's not just so i've come and put some few cults together and just no this is the channel where god breathed upon the people praise the lord i was i was just thinking about that uh you know i was thinking about that in and i was saying oh my god oh my god you realize why why peter and those apostles say she says sir uh you know you people find men that can be able to take care of your affairs let's give ourselves to the world and to prayers praise the lord because the ministry is not just a place of privilege right no it's not a place of privilege and every and everything in anything that we do for god is not just a place of privilege praise the lord it's hard to to understand how to put into words i'm just i'm just cut into the shimmy knife story there so well so we're talking about the inspiration of the almighty you know let's let's read this quote from the message pride uh that might be the only quote i'll refer back to some of the quotes i've i've read during this series but i'm hoping that i can be able to to to wrap this up pray for me i'll be away this weekend and be helping uh group somewhere so just just keep meaning pray be back on sunday by the grace of god and uh uh brett bram says here just listen to that he says how the bible means so much more than it speaks how it means so much more can you imagine just the few verses that we have just read the picture that we have taken from indy another person with with fancy english and can can pick up those few verses and just read it like a newspaper how the bible means so much more than it speaks if we can only have the holy spirit to interpret it for us we only read it as we look down upon it that's what we can do as humans amen with our human ability praise the lord we can only look down on it and read it we try to read it mispronounce the words that's all that's all human can do right praise the lord but oh how the holy spirit says when you pick up the bible and open it oh i love this quote and you and you are reading it and take the 10 loaves and you are reading it he says you can only read it as a human king but but if you can listen he says and who oh how the holy spirit says child of mine you are looking into my face as you are reading the bible sounds of solomon chapter two i am the rose of sharon and the lady of the valley as the lady tones so it's my beloved among the daughters principles this is all how the holy spirit says child of mine you are looking into my face you are looking into my face now when you look into the bible praise the lord you are looking into my face do you see why sometimes when you are reading the bible and you have a little inspiration that brings an understanding to you you get stuck and you look at it again because you are not looking at words you are looking at his face oh child of mine you are looking into my face praise the lord oh how we how we wish that we knew this all alone we would take the habit to look in his face every morning praise the lord and look at his face praise the lord say that's that's what happened when the person just got saved and and and and the love of god becomes so real to them and you know they read the bible the kiss they all didn't like the only ordinary mind just look at that person that it's a fanatic that's sacrilegious what are you reading that paper it don't make sense to you but when inspiration make you to realize that you are looking into his face children young people if we only kneel if we only knew that it is just 10 of the reality of what takes place in service that you grab ten percent praise the lord have you ever come to church being in service the word of god preached and you go back home again and say let me play that service and then when you play the service you ask you it looks like was i really in that service amen was i did my goodness where was i when that happened why i missed a lot of things when i was in church i challenge you play it again then you ask yourself oh my goodness even just before the service end the anointing that came down but you were here praise the lord but you know what we do we go back and we play the service and we are looking around he says see how josh was sitting there in our church oh it sounds funny you only lie because you feel guilty [Music] look at the services see how he's sitting down see the other one moving his hair like that just chicken you say that just all we look at only 10 person sometimes we get less than 10 percent especially when you come to church to sleep sleeping in church party just negative zero praise the lord it was better you just stay home stay to your house enjoy the comfort of your bed praise the lord because you know what happened it sounds funny to you but what happened is that when a person is in is in that kind of a state and the word being preached the devil tried to look for the most vulnerable person as he retreats and people are celebrating amen thank you jesus he retreats and look for the most vulnerable person the person that put themselves in a critical state they're not a get more thing to criticize because all thy evil spirits start creeping in your corner the person that wants to sleep then you feel more sleepy because all that evil spirit is just getting right in your corner praise the lord so it's a church there are a lot of things that take place people get healed and god comes in a supernatural way they break people from hobbits and and we don't see those things with our eyes we don't see it the way each individual receive the word and the different things that happen while the preacher is preaching talking and he can just say one thing and this person in mind just pick up something else and and god is dealing with them on it and that other person picks something and god is dealing with them on it and and you don't even know how god is dealing with the other person you can't even fathom how god is dealing with you how much will you know about the other person do you see how we ought to be serious now brother braham says we come to church we have to pray we have to be prayed up now using the church quiet time to start cleaning your nails and and and all all of that looking at your nails looking at your fingers what were you doing home but we're talking about the inspiration of the almighty tonight let me just take time and get and go into this yeah because as i was as i was thinking about this you see how the that shimina woman the confidence that she had like i said was was in was in the prophet it was in the the the quality of of his spirit the quality of what she knows that that man possessed as the lord live it it's actually as the lord your god leave it that's what she said as the lord your god liveth and as your soul believe it she's saying i know your god liveth in you the god that you talk about he's living in you you see that that was the reason why she had such such a character because she knows she was not dealing with a man and men don't give life amen can i give time praise the lord a man can give child a man that tells you that by this time i call in tol the time of life you will be carrying a child she knew that it was god almighty god that was dwelling in that man so when she says that ask the lord your god liveth and he's living in you i'm not going to leave you i don't want a staff i want a living god i want a god with skin on amen that was the kind of confidence that she had in the prophet praise the lord she has such a confident that she was not going to make noise about it because she knows that when the critics takes it they will blow it i told you that that matter was just fake he just wanted to come in your house and you know what she never wanted people saying things you have to realize that she was the one that convinced her husband she had a conviction for them to build him a room so she even never wanted her husband to speak ill of the prophet because she knew that almighty god was living in that man she knew that almighty god was living in that man praise the she don't want her husband to say anything ill i'm going to see the man of god uh hunting is not the new moon yet it's not sabbah what's going on it would be well how we have to have such a character when people start to say oh thing you can grab any media and say no don't say that don't say that not to stop blowing the film yeah i might say i was thinking on that very same thing i i just been watching i i've just i've been observing all the politics and all the things i just been was there blow blood and talk and talk and talk and talk you know what brother braham says when you take that kind of attitude you put the holy ghost into a corner in your home because you are talking about a child of god you are talking about a seven of god you're talking about a daughter of god someone that god is working in their life it shows the amount of confidence that she had she did not want her husband saying anything she didn't want her workers even the man that was driving her never had no conversation he never even knew where he was going get on the road let's go don't stop until i say stop that was only her conversation right and he was just going since of god that was before the holy ghost that was before the holy ghost she was not even under the coveted yet but she could identify god in a man and have such a respect many of us we only know brother branham by what they say brother branham we only know him by what we hear on the tapes and what we read in the box you never met the man you never sat in his presence praise the lord why would people choose to believe what is on on the internet if it is not the devil why would make people to choose to believe what is on the internet why will make them a few days ago there's a man that called me on my phone i was i was uh yeah i was at work he called me left me the voicemail in and then i saw the car i saw the voicemail so i knew okay this person leave me in the voicemail so i called uh as i said i called you pick up the phone says he says yeah how are you fine yeah he says uh uh do you know william branham i i just got stuck in my truck because you're just calling it you know and talking says yeah i got your number then uh uh and you know i was looking at some video on the internet uh oh my goodness uh what a man i mean what a testimony and this is not somebody that's in the message but this is somebody that has been around pentecost and are just looking at you know when and just you know go from one thing to another and so you start asking me different questions and all of that now in my mind after a while we talked we had a nice conversation talk about different things you know he talked about different revival as a alain and different people over rival and all of that and uh then you you realize that a person like that has been around the movement the pentecostal movement because he just he just appreciated the testimony and uh just to be able to watch a 20th century prophet and all of that in my mind i'm saying to myself with all there is just only two possible videos of brother branham ceremony other ones are images that are put together you know of him traveling and all of that and you know with his family and different things and all of that and uh uh there and and there are more things that are placed i mean uh things lies in and you know all sorts of things that people put up there you know uh broad brand i'm thinking to myself [Music] you have just read about this man and talk maybe making research and looking at youtube about different people and then you you learn about william branham and in i mean what is it that never drove him to start looking at all of the negative things that he said about this man praise the lord and we just talk and we plan to meet some time in in fellowship and all of that and now just think yes i said oh my goodness in the mess of believe the sound in the midst of people going away from the message there are still people that are believing that god can still use man there are still people that are believing never been to a message church you'll look at something on youtube and say wow and you know the thing the thing there is there there is is it's all about which one of the dogs you are feeling it's all about it if if there is an if there are just negative things in you you it would just draw you to negative things it would just be looking for every negative thing because that is what is in you sure you know and that is that is one of the amazing thing i'm all over the place from that but it's fine that is one of the amazing thing about the power of transformation romans chapter 12 be you renew bob uh you know the transformation of your mind like our brother preached on saturday night you know one of the things that blew my mind is that uh when you when you when you read the power of transformation you realize the way you think about it is that uh uh transform is to move from one state to another praise the lord but if you go in the message and you study when brethren preach the power of transformation the way he preached it is that this word brings out of you what is in you and because you are a son of god you are a daughter of god and the seed of god is lying dormant in your soul when you hear the word and keep feeling the word then encourage that see and keep giving you desire to move towards god because that is what is in you so the change that is taking place is not coming from fire no the change is coming from your soul because deep down in your soul that's there's a seed of god just like a button and the more you hear the word the more you hear no matter how much your mind has been polleted with master thing there is succeeding your soul the more you hear the word the more it draws you to do what is right this is not a magic show what a person says i would change this bottle of water to an oil they bring it down here and says whoa [Applause] that's night that's not the transformation we are talking about power of transformation is to bring out what god has placed in you from the foundation of the world that's the power of transformation that is what god is doing if it is not there you can practice it you can learn the language you can know the dress call you can know everything and do everything that you want to do go to all the conventions and just go everywhere if it is not there you will put your own list on facebook pretty soon praise the lord so you see that's the reason why the the power of transformation is in the word it was the word that transformed the earth when the earth was in darkness it was the word god said let there be it was the spoken word that transformed the earth because those seas were lying in the earth god never went breaking the ground plenty seats he said let the earth bring forth the sea was there that's what the power of transformation is is to bring what is already in the earth this is not a pentecostal movement to make people work out right praise the lord we're not running the boss scout let's go left right everybody left everybody right this word is only looking for what is in you it's looking for what is in you if i were you just like i myself i will be looking for what is in me what is in me lord what's my desire what's my desire what's my desire not making it up here but what is really down here do you really want to change do you do you really want the holy ghost oh it's just a show up if it is one it's not going to last children it's not going to last right that's what a prophet god will tell you you have to look at your motives and objectives all the time don't make it up don't cover up the inspiration of the almighty let me let's take something here maybe the law will give us another opportunity again but let's let's look at something here that that woman she was captured in an inspiration okay [Music] and when she came to me the prophet the prophet saw how solid she was that this woman paul did not reveal anything to me he said he said but take my staff so the inspiration of the woman inspired the prophet sure [Music] her inspiration inspired the prophet praise the lord preachers does that all the time one preacher preached a message another preacher is inspired to preach something else praise the lord amen when verb brian preached we saw the bride the the restoration of the bride tree he said i heard a brother talking about the enforcing anger you know he says that that enforcing that that that you know uh he says you know it struck him for him to go looking the hard talk about how the holy ghost is our you know our enforcing agent so her inspiration inspired the prophet sure praise the lord then he took his staff and said go and lay on the baby praise the lord his inspiration inspired the apostle paul verb says is from is from elijah inspiration of taking his staff to go and lay on the baby as chapter 19 paul took things from his body his clothes to go and lay on the sick his inspiration inspired the apostle paul they asked chapter 19 to talk things from the body of paul to lay on the sick that inspiration inspired brother branham praise the lord and what abraham says he says he says some he says take that he says take the the the prayer claw off or take that prayer and need and just lay it right on us chapter 19. praise the lord you see it's the inspiration of the almighty nobody have a franchise to it it's what god breaks down is what god gave to his people for the benefit of his people praise the lord amen you see the elijah elijah was inspired by the woman but he did not impersonate the woman there's a difference between inspiration and impersonation praise the lord paul was inspired by elisha but he did not impersonate elisha well now he's going everywhere with her staff take my staff and lay on him take my staff and lay on him take my staff and lay on them no praise the lord amen oh praise the lord i'm a little over nine o'clock tonight you love the lord i didn't even go into my scripture uh uh saint john chapter nine jesus saw the blind man the blind man came to him and uh and and he was inspired and what he did the bible said he spit on the ground and play in his own spate mix it with the dirt and rub it on the man eyes inspiration it looks stupid to medical science but it is the breath of god because it's the breath of god because it's god breathing in that instance is bound to give a result it's bound to give life because it's god's breath in that very moment you are just a china that god is breathing through to do what you are doing go back and try again it will not work because it was only good for that moment go smith on the ground and dropping on somebody either like you're in jail right praise the lord amen it will lock you open jay uh uh uh brown did uh by faith moses he talks about how moses uh you know the persecuted for the world he says yeah we'll be pers he said but don't do things to be persecuted don't do things to bring persecution on yourself and say they are persecuting me you are misrepresenting the world you are misrepresenting the truth that's the reason why as children of god we have to live every day our best we have to be in the right state of mind no matter how the devil tried to blast our mind from year to day we came in the right state of mind in the right attitude because you will never know when god will want to breathe for a situation he will just want to inspire you right there for you to do something to give life to somebody god breathed into man a man became a living soul every time the breath of god every time the breath of god goes into man he lives when the church comes together and by the word i was going to talk about different things anointing oil and there's no time for that tonight the church comes together and it says we have a media church this brother is sacred this sister is sick let's buy our heads and pray when the church comes together and pray and there is nothing that handles that prayer god sees the the attitude of the people everybody is involved everybody is engaged there is no nothing there he just and the sister or the brother says oh thank god when the church pray for me i was healed is god finding a china to breathe true it's you being a china it's me being a china for god to breathe through to give life if god is not breathing through me to give life to this church we are just working ourself up yes we are just working ourselves up pretty soon we will catch ourselves that we're going nowhere but if his god is breathing through the ministry the life of people will change people will be delivered people will be challenged people will be encouraged is because god is breathing true that's the reason why the church don't run by people idea oh i think we must do this i think we must do that i think we must do that instead of you thinking be praying that's how inspiration comes by praying not by thinking why we can't do this why we can do this why we can do this musicians you can come tonight much [Music] let's try let's try let's play that song i don't know if i will be able to sing or will be able to sing it tonight this is the air i breathe amen i praise the lord it's just a faith that you're inspired to help me okay let's just worship together um [Music] this is [Music] thank you father this is [Music] yes more

[Music] uh that people are surprised the way we go about improving our things if you come in and then start bringing us closer to inspiration trying to lead us through the process by which we can attain that inspiration my father ensures that you are really closer to your children and it also shows that you are the very god in the body of a man using the vocals of a man when by your way lord you call you guiding your children to yourself to prepare us for where you are know the lord you know you whenever you send a visiting preacher away you always have something for him to bring to us for an inspiration to quickeners from where we are and this night we want to thank you the lord from the first time that lord you started dealing with us on this world of inspiration tonight you have come in in a very different way all together the lord you have cited us one from your own way a woman whose inspiration started even before you know the prophet came to give her a promise of a child so father we want to thank you want to bless you and let me give you the glory that our channel of inspiration in us is open unto us anytime father in our life we will just look at things differently until our lord by the way inspires inspires the inspiration is the breath of god upon your children okay and we are praying that not only here when we come here to hear the word but any time lord at home wherever we take our bibles to read we might find inspiration from you and more particularly in the message that you are called as onto this is the message of inspiration that is gathering your children together by the prophet is only a man by the way that comes from you is what we look at that is the jesus christ of our day amen jesus christ of our day is our inspiration for our generation and may this inspiration lead us further in the name of jesus christ our lord we want to thank you for our [Music] without your inspiration upon us and some will say we are lost without you so we are
