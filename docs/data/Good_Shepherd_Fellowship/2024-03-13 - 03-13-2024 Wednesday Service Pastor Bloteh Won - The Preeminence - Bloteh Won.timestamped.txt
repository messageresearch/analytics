[37:30] let's take our Bibles and uh we go to uh
[37:34] T
[37:38] John as we come in uh to
[37:42] closing this that we have taken as a
[37:45] series since the beginning of the year I
[37:47] want us to read T John reading from
[37:52] verse
[37:56] one
[37:58] praise the Lord the he unto the well
[38:01] beloved G whom I love in the truth
[38:05] belove I wish above all things that thou
[38:09] May prosper and be in health even as thy
[38:12] Soul
[38:13] Prosper for I Rejoice greatly when the
[38:17] Brethren came and testify of the truth
[38:21] that is in
[38:22] the even as thou walth in the truth I
[38:27] have no Greater Joy than to hear that my
[38:30] children Walk In Truth
[38:34] beloved that thus Faithfully whatsoever
[38:37] there does to the Brethren and to
[38:40] strangers praise the Lord so this
[38:43] brother had a testimony of uh of being
[38:46] well to the Brethren and also to
[38:48] strangers which have borne witness of
[38:51] that charity before the church whom uh
[38:55] if thou uh bring forward on their
[38:59] Journey after a Godly sck thou sh do
[39:03] well because there for his name's sake
[39:06] they went forth thinking nothing of the
[39:10] Gentiles so there's there is H there's a
[39:12] testimony here and uh and and that's
[39:15] what we we we we want to talk about a
[39:17] little
[39:18] bit and uh uh this this individual uh
[39:24] that John referred to here uh has has
[39:27] being referred to in in several places
[39:30] in U in the in the New Testament but
[39:34] let's let's go down a little bit here
[39:40] uh I will read verse five again belove
[39:44] thatou does Faithfully whatsoever that
[39:47] does to the Brethren and to
[39:51] strangers which have bought witness of
[39:53] thy charity before the church whom whom
[39:57] if thou bring forward on their Journey
[40:01] after a Godly s thou shall do well now
[40:05] so there there's a little thing that is
[40:06] that is kept right in here this is
[40:09] almost like what we would term in our
[40:12] day of uh supporting missionaries
[40:14] supporting people that are on the field
[40:16] or ministers that are coming in our
[40:19] gates that's that's that's what uh John
[40:22] is referring to here because you will
[40:24] soon see why he's saying that because
[40:27] that for his name's sake they went These
[40:31] Guys these brothers that are going out
[40:33] they went out for Christ's name sake
[40:35] taking nothing of the
[40:37] Gentiles we therefore ought to receive
[40:42] such that we might be fellow helpers of
[40:46] the truth if you can go you can also
[40:50] send one amen you can send one by your
[40:53] prayers you can send one by your support
[40:56] praise the
[40:58] Lord I wrote onto the
[41:01] church but there trets who loveth to
[41:07] have the preeminence among them
[41:09] receiveth us
[41:12] net where if I come I will remember his
[41:17] deeds which he does pring against us
[41:21] with malicious words and not content
[41:24] therewith neither does he himself
[41:27] receive the
[41:29] Brethren and forbade them that hold and
[41:34] casteth them out of the church so
[41:36] there's a character here and we want to
[41:38] look at that character tonight beloved
[41:41] follow that that which is evil but that
[41:44] which is good he that does good is of
[41:47] God but he that does evil have not seen
[41:50] God praise the
[41:53] Lord Demitri has good report of all men
[41:57] and of the truth itself yeah and we also
[42:01] bear record and ye know that our record

[44:02] good work that's a good
[44:08] work praise the Lord tonight I just like
[44:12] I said we're trying to close uh it's
[44:15] easy to start a series difficult to
[44:17] close it amen you get down one of these
[44:20] Rabbit Trail you keep going you keep
[44:23] turning Corner missing your way you come
[44:25] back again and it's it just like there
[44:27] praise the Lord some of the easier way
[44:30] to stop a series is to just travel and
[44:33] then when you come back you start
[44:34] something different
[44:36] amen praise the Lord but tonight as uh
[44:39] as we have been looking on this we had
[44:41] the privilege to pretty much go through
[44:44] the the the three uh records of John
[44:47] first second and third John and uh uh
[44:52] tonight I want to look at a character
[44:55] here that uh John is reporting here say
[44:58] he's talking uh uh of of of a brother
[45:02] here he talking of one of uh uh
[45:07] uh
[45:09] um one of the Saints there and and if
[45:12] you look in the in the New Testament
[45:15] there there are few different places
[45:17] that uh this uh this Brother G was uh
[45:21] mentioned Acts Chapter 19 Verse uh
[45:25] 29 the scripture mention him there also
[45:30] uh the whole city was filled with
[45:31] confusion and having cult GES and and
[45:34] all of those men you go to Acts Chapter
[45:36] 20 The Bible mention him also now that
[45:39] was that was a common name uh uh when
[45:42] you look through uh some of the
[45:44] commentaries there that was a common
[45:46] name so whether this is just one person
[45:48] or or the or you know is someone that
[45:51] was bearing the same name and but there
[45:54] is something that is that is that is
[45:56] remarkable and that's what we want to
[45:58] look at not the man himself but the
[46:01] character of Christ that he was bearing
[46:03] praise the Lord that's what matters
[46:09] amen and he's speaking here uh which of
[46:13] course we took on Sunday uh talking
[46:16] about the son of righteousness Rising
[46:18] with healing in his wings beloved I
[46:20] which above all things that thou May
[46:23] prosper and be in health even as th soul
[46:27] Prosper it now uh uh John here coming
[46:31] from uh the island of pmos where we talk
[46:33] uh taking the series from and uh he's
[46:36] seeing how the church on a vision has
[46:40] prospered with Christ in his midst amen
[46:44] Christ in the midst of the seven golden
[46:46] candlesticks and John uh on the vision
[46:50] he's beginning to understand some of the
[46:53] things that he live out in the ministry
[46:55] of Jesus Christ some of the things that
[46:57] Jesus said to them why he was with them
[47:00] that they never understood John
[47:02] beginning to understand it after the
[47:04] Holy Ghost has come and here he is on
[47:07] the island of pmos seeing these
[47:08] different things you know on the vision
[47:11] and then he comes back to the church and
[47:13] giving the report things that were a bit
[47:16] difficult to express so he's telling the
[47:19] church here as he talks to this brother
[47:22] Above All Things how God desired to have
[47:26] a healthy
[47:27] Church praise the Lord
[47:31] amen because when God first
[47:35] manifested his children in Eden their
[47:38] beginning was
[47:40] healthy like we said on on Sunday Adam
[47:44] was one of the most healthy of men the
[47:47] scripture never gave us uh how long he
[47:49] Liv even before Genesis chapter 3 praise
[47:54] the Lord amen
[47:58] whether the years recorded in the Bible
[48:01] is after Genesis chapter 3 or from the
[48:04] very day that God created him
[48:07] but what is important here is that he
[48:10] was in good
[48:12] health praise the Lord and even when you
[48:16] look at the the the the the the realm of
[48:20] Health that Adam was in you cannot
[48:23] compare it because there was no sickness
[48:27] so we we look at Health in a way that we
[48:31] think about health now because we have
[48:33] all of the names of all of these
[48:35] sickness and different experiences in
[48:37] our body so we we can we we know what
[48:40] health is we know when when a person
[48:42] says why I'm not feeling well well I'm I
[48:45] mean I'm doing good it's it's it's in
[48:47] comparison to
[48:50] something but before Genesis chapter 3
[48:53] Adam never had no
[48:55] comparison praise the Lord
[48:58] am he was in he was in a state of
[49:03] fullness in so much that you know his
[49:06] thought was in according to God he speak
[49:09] and that's exactly what God was thinking
[49:12] to name this thing and and everything he
[49:14] had a holy Veil on him I mean so much in
[49:17] health that his mind was not corrupted
[49:20] his mind was not polluted he never knew
[49:23] fear in in all of that praise the Lord
[49:29] amen and uh and and and even now no
[49:33] matter how much by God's grace we will
[49:37] prosper in health we will still have
[49:39] some form of illness in our body because
[49:42] our body is not redeemed praise the lord
[49:45] we get sick we be treated by the doctors
[49:47] or we be prayed for or whichever way the
[49:50] healing will comes to us it comes by God
[49:53] but we will get sick again praise the
[49:56] Lord
[49:57] and until we leave from
[50:00] here Lazarus after uh being dead 3 days
[50:07] went into
[50:09] corruption he
[50:11] resurrected but yet he had to die
[50:15] again praise the Lord he had to die
[50:18] again because he was in a corrupt
[50:23] body glory be to God but just like uh uh
[50:29] John said here the desire here is that
[50:33] uh our body will will will prosper in
[50:36] health you know will go from from from
[50:40] from Health uh stages of from glory to
[50:43] glory from Better Health and uh even as
[50:46] our soul prosperous so you see the thing
[50:49] the thing about it uh about being
[50:52] healthy in this light is uh as uh you
[50:56] know uh uh coming to a place of
[50:59] understanding praise the Lord coming to
[51:02] a place of understanding just like when
[51:05] we look at Malachi 4 on Sunday we saw
[51:09] that uh there in Malachi 4 under that
[51:12] promise you know uh uh the prophet said
[51:17] uh we we we we listed
[51:21] uh there were there were four things
[51:23] that we listed that uh uh Malachi spoke
[51:28] about praise the Lord let me let me see
[51:31] if I can drop back uh uh to my notes and
[51:34] there I help
[51:43] me praise the
[51:48] Lord the son of righteousness will rise
[51:51] with healing in his wings he will go
[51:54] forth which of course we say healing
[51:57] healing in his wings speaks of health
[51:59] and protection he will go forth it
[52:02] speaks of Deliverance and freedom he
[52:05] will grow
[52:07] up as a calf in the stall it speaks of
[52:11] safety and we will be careful and then
[52:14] also we will be
[52:16] wellfed and we will also tread down the
[52:19] wicked it speaks of overcoming power so
[52:23] we we see there these four things also
[52:25] just like in Isaiah 53 the Bible talk
[52:29] about how he was bruised and uh uh he
[52:33] was chastin for our peace and uh uh um
[52:38] he was bruised for our uh uh our
[52:41] iniquity he was chasten for our Peace by
[52:44] his tribes we are healed and there's
[52:46] another one for our iniquity I mean our
[52:49] iniquity our transgression Bru for our
[52:51] transgression and another one for our
[52:53] iniquity so we see also there honor
[52:56] their Pro is there is four now I was
[52:58] also thinking in a place of
[53:02] healing we realized that brother
[53:04] brandham talks about uh uh or the
[53:07] scripture tells us about the four beasts
[53:10] around the throne praise the
[53:12] Lord and uh uh which of course the there
[53:16] are four anointing that comes uh uh
[53:20] right from Eden all the way down we know
[53:22] it was the same chuban that was guarding
[53:24] the tree of life and then over in
[53:27] Revelation they were around the throne
[53:29] praise the Lord and uh and and just like
[53:33] we have these four promises in Malachi
[53:36] we have those four over there in Isaiah
[53:39] 53 yeah we have these four living
[53:43] creatures we have these four anointing
[53:45] we have these four powers that goes from
[53:48] the Throne of God praise the Lord one is
[53:53] represented by the
[53:55] lion are we together the other one is
[53:59] represented by uh uh the
[54:03] ox amen and we also have another one
[54:07] that is represented by the
[54:10] man and one is also represented by the
[54:13] ego now so just like you are seeing
[54:17] these four
[54:18] promises or four element Under This
[54:21] Promise of the son of righteousness if
[54:23] you bring there to the anointing that
[54:26] comes from the throne now take it this
[54:28] way every healing comes from God every
[54:32] form of
[54:33] healing are we together amen so every
[54:37] form of healing that we will ever
[54:40] experience will be projected to us or
[54:44] ministered To Us by one of these
[54:49] anointing every form of
[54:52] healing are we together praise the Lord
[54:59] amen now so we if if if we want to take
[55:03] uh uh uh you know uh healing
[55:10] under the anointing of the
[55:14] lion praise the Lord amen we want to
[55:19] take healing honor the anointing of the
[55:21] lion you'll realize and and and and we
[55:24] know that is that's the word of God
[55:26] every every form of healing comes from
[55:28] God praise the Lord you will realize
[55:30] that uh uh there is there is an
[55:33] anointing that comes from the Throne of
[55:35] God that that you know there's uh
[55:37] there's that that that fight against
[55:39] sicknesses I mean just like it was in
[55:42] Isaiah uh uh 14 uh uh you know uh
[55:47] running down a road here that's not part
[55:49] of my notes but it's okay I think I'm in
[55:50] a safe place praise the Lord now so you
[55:54] will see that under the on the Lion's
[55:57] anointing just like how it was with uh
[56:01] with with under the church ages the
[56:03] Lion's anointing was the anointing that
[56:07] was that that uh that brought forth the
[56:09] word on the first three Edge and on
[56:14] those age there were great uh uh uh uh
[56:18] missionaries you know uh uh Paul and all
[56:21] of those Apostles they were crossing the
[56:23] great sea and trying to carry the gospel
[56:26] to India they were all operating Under
[56:29] The Lion
[56:30] anointing are we together praise the
[56:33] Lord and under the ox anointing like it
[56:37] is uh uh applied to the church that is
[56:40] the anointing under the anointing that
[56:43] God gave uh the the the Believers in the
[56:46] dark ages for them to be able to give
[56:49] their B
[56:51] willingly okay praise the Lord for the C
[56:55] of the Gospel
[56:57] praise the Lord the Lord anointed them
[56:59] so much their their fear a sense of fear
[57:03] were taken uh H uh from them that uh you
[57:06] know they they were they were willing to
[57:08] do their wedding and be burned to the
[57:11] Stak I mean I mean children would rather
[57:13] go with their parents to the Stak and
[57:16] and and and uh you know they were honor
[57:18] the anointing and and on uh uh uh in the
[57:21] fourth Church age brother Brandon says
[57:24] the church can do nothing will respond
[57:26] to the anointing of her age that's right
[57:30] praise the Lord
[57:32] amen
[57:35] hallelujah in as much as we love the
[57:38] Lord and in as much as God has given us
[57:41] great Revelation and great mystery our
[57:44] anointing is not an ox anointing that's
[57:48] right so no matter how much Revelation
[57:51] you have you will still have a sense of
[57:54] Fear To Die For The Gospel
[57:57] because that's not your
[57:59] anointing it does not make you a weaker
[58:02] believer it's just that you are not
[58:04] anointed for death your anointing is an
[58:07] ego rapturing anointing so the first
[58:11] thing you think is either you get in a
[58:13] carard or find a plain ticket and get
[58:15] out of
[58:16] there that's your anointing you are
[58:18] responding to your anointing praise the
[58:21] Lord amen and we know under the man's
[58:25] anointing that God was able to bless
[58:28] great men under the Reformation praise
[58:31] the Lord that were able to to take the
[58:34] gospel out and uh and great men great
[58:37] men were blessed under the anointing
[58:40] they had great Insight in in the word
[58:44] praise the Lord they had great Insight
[58:47] in the word even though it was not their
[58:49] age for the mystery to be open but they
[58:52] gave time to steud because they were
[58:54] anointed for that time it was the time
[58:56] that man was blessed to start the
[58:58] printing press because God wanted his
[59:00] word to come in a Bible form praise the
[59:03] Lord you know so God was using men just
[59:05] giving men breakthrough you know they
[59:07] were having they were having knowledge
[59:08] and all of that and then the the the
[59:11] last anointing there is the eagle the
[59:14] rapturing anointing amen where the
[59:16] quickening power has returned back to
[59:18] our hearts amen the spirit that raised
[59:21] up Jesus from the dead will Quicken your
[59:23] mortal body amen that's the eag that
[59:26] anting but when we bring it down in the
[59:28] sense of uh of uh of uh uh this promise
[59:34] that God want us to prosper in health
[59:37] even as our soul prospering because you
[59:40] will
[59:42] realize down through the church
[59:44] ages many struggled during that time
[59:49] because you know with all the promises
[59:51] in the word many Believers thought that
[59:54] if you believe in Jesus Christ you know
[59:57] you you are a believer in the word you
[1:00:00] know sickness should be far from you so
[1:00:04] many people struggle in their faith when
[1:00:06] they get sick right and they prayed and
[1:00:08] they prayed and they not feeling
[1:00:10] well they go back and start to look for
[1:00:13] things in their life have I failed the
[1:00:15] Lord and uh and and some would say is
[1:00:18] you know it's it's family curse and and
[1:00:20] and maybe my father did something but
[1:00:23] you know Jesus there with that blind man
[1:00:25] he said it was NE of the father it was
[1:00:27] need of the mother God allowed that that
[1:00:30] he must be
[1:00:32] glorified praise the Lord so uh before
[1:00:36] the opening of the word for us to come
[1:00:38] to this place to be able to understand
[1:00:40] that every healing proceed from the
[1:00:43] Throne of God every healing that we ever
[1:00:46] that that any mortal we ever experience
[1:00:49] we come on the wings of one of these
[1:00:54] anointing praise the Lord amen God will
[1:01:00] either bless uh uh uh a person to go
[1:01:06] through uh uh uh
[1:01:09] uh their healing
[1:01:14] process you will see that uh honor the
[1:01:18] man's anointing God has has blessed this
[1:01:22] age of science with with great Medical
[1:01:25] doctors I mean Medical Science have gone
[1:01:28] to the level that the word has never
[1:01:31] seen praise the lord it's God's love for
[1:01:34] us wanting to keep us in good health I
[1:01:37] mean sicknesses uh that that that that
[1:01:40] will kill people you know well that was
[1:01:43] that was uh Dame terminal disease and
[1:01:45] now something very common for medical
[1:01:48] science praise the
[1:01:50] Lord even though it's it's Medical
[1:01:53] Science but because healing comes from
[1:01:56] God like brother brandham said he says
[1:01:58] uh you know the doctor can put the bones
[1:02:00] together but God has to do the healing
[1:02:04] amen they can get in there and do the
[1:02:07] surgery but God has to do the healing he
[1:02:10] has to bring life back to the
[1:02:15] tissues glory be to God am that's what
[1:02:18] the prophet of God says I spend time
[1:02:20] praying for
[1:02:22] doctors he said because they are God
[1:02:24] gift to the word
[1:02:29] are we together praise the Lord they are
[1:02:31] God gift to the word now you will see

[1:02:50] name of Christ to be able to go you know
[1:02:53] into the lion Den or be burned at the
[1:02:55] stake God put that anointing on them so
[1:02:59] there is a power that that that is
[1:03:01] released from the Throne of
[1:03:04] God that a Believer or a a a child of
[1:03:07] God can can can be going through
[1:03:10] illnesses and different things in their

[1:03:15] for their
[1:03:17] healing praise the Lord amen amen they
[1:03:20] are anointed with an O anointing that
[1:03:23] comes from the Throne of God

[1:05:15] they are so anointed they feel like they
[1:05:17] will rise up but they are not going

[1:17:23] it he has the pre preeminence because is
[1:17:28] none other than God himself in the
[1:17:30] spoken word and it has to come to pass
[1:17:34] all my days I have I have tried solemnly
[1:17:38] to keep the people on the word of God
[1:17:42] praise the
[1:17:43] Lord the the the healing testimonies is
[1:17:47] just to build our
[1:17:49] faith we testify that God have done this
[1:17:53] go because he is the same yet yesterday
[1:17:55] today and forever praise the Lord but if
[1:17:59] there is one place we want to rest our
[1:18:02] faith and is the only solid place that
[1:18:04] faith can rest on is on the word of
[1:18:08] God praise the
[1:18:11] Lord I was looking at something out of
[1:18:14] the message half his time you know I was
[1:18:16] talking about uh uh the scheme of the
[1:18:19] devil he was talking about uh uh Jesus
[1:18:22] in his trials you know the the what on
[1:18:24] on the Mountain at the beginning of his
[1:18:27] uh of his ministry and uh you know and
[1:18:30] he he was he was just trying to to show
[1:18:33] there and and says uh you know uh the
[1:18:36] devil can hand you he can give you a
[1:18:39] handful of Supernatural if a man just
[1:18:42] want to rest you know his faith on
[1:18:45] Supernatural things he says Satan can
[1:18:48] hand you a handful of
[1:18:51] Faith praise the
[1:18:53] Lord
[1:18:55] if you want to rest your faith on
[1:18:56] speaking in tongues or prophesy it or
[1:18:59] some kind of a manifestation the devil
[1:19:01] can produce
[1:19:04] that praise the
[1:19:11] Lord but we must try to keep the people
[1:19:15] on the
[1:19:16] word for that was his promise to me he
[1:19:19] told me that he will bless me what uh
[1:19:22] wherever I went and a who prospered
[1:19:25] and the work of the Lord should grow but
[1:19:28] that that the word that I must be sure
[1:19:33] that the word was first in
[1:19:38] everything praise the Lord the word must
[1:19:42] be first in
[1:19:44] everything and that's and that is our
[1:19:47] inspiration on this beginning Series in
[1:19:49] the beginning was the
[1:19:51] word amen in the beginning was the word
[1:19:56] so when John came back from the island
[1:19:58] of pmos with the things that he saw you
[1:20:01] go through all his his book there you
[1:20:05] will realize that he kept printing the
[1:20:07] church back to the
[1:20:10] beginning amen first John 2 John uh he
[1:20:15] that was in the beginning he that we
[1:20:17] have touched uh H H and and and he kept
[1:20:19] printing the church back to that because
[1:20:21] that is the beginning of everything the
[1:20:23] word is the beginning brother Braham
[1:20:27] says if you want to start a church start
[1:20:29] it on the word amen you want to start a
[1:20:33] family start your family on the word you
[1:20:36] want to do a business start it right on
[1:20:39] the word praise the Lord because the
[1:20:43] word is that solid
[1:20:46] foundation are we
[1:20:49] together we'll take another one yeah
[1:20:51] yeah he says and no matter
[1:20:55] in any kind of service the word should
[1:20:58] have
[1:21:00] preeminence it should be
[1:21:03] first and the healing of the soul is
[1:21:06] always first why because the healing of
[1:21:10] the Soul comes by the
[1:21:12] word are we
[1:21:15] together why a
[1:21:18] man when a man is Born Again of the
[1:21:21] spirit of God he has Immortal in eternal
[1:21:25] life and shall never perish but when a
[1:21:27] man is healed of his body it is just for
[1:21:31] uh a limited time but Salvation of the
[1:21:34] soul is
[1:21:36] forever he becomes a new creature in
[1:21:39] Christ when he's healed of his soul
[1:21:44] praise the Lord now if you if you can
[1:21:47] just look in a few codes that I've read
[1:21:49] you will see what I'm going tonight and
[1:21:51] where actually I want to go tonight is
[1:21:54] as John spoke to the church there the
[1:21:58] brothers there he identified a character
[1:22:02] he talks about this man like Jude would
[1:22:06] say certain man has creep in unaware he
[1:22:09] talks about this man that is called deot
[1:22:13] tropus and one thing that John said
[1:22:16] about him is that he love the
[1:22:20] preeminence among the
[1:22:23] brethren and while we try to show you in
[1:22:26] the word there is one thing that must
[1:22:28] have the preeminence Among Us that's the
[1:22:31] word praise the Lord the pastor don't
[1:22:35] have the preeminence nobody have the
[1:22:37] preeminence brother brandham don't have
[1:22:39] the preeminence no is the word that have
[1:22:43] the preeminence
[1:22:46] amen praise the Lord now you think about
[1:22:49] it in the early church that John will be
[1:22:53] able after after after such an
[1:22:55] experience when he could see from
[1:22:57] Revelation chapter 1 to the closing of
[1:23:00] the vision it was all about Jesus Christ
[1:23:04] and then to return back to the church
[1:23:06] and see a
[1:23:07] man as s such a place among the
[1:23:11] Brethren that he has to approve for a
[1:23:15] man to come in or he shut him up he
[1:23:18] destroyed him he he took such a place
[1:23:22] among the
[1:23:23] Believers
[1:23:25] praise the lord it's easy to
[1:23:28] identify praise the lord it's easy to
[1:23:31] identify because when we spoke about our
[1:23:35] H H sin sinner in the beginning in one
[1:23:37] of our beginning series we we look at
[1:23:40] this the the F of
[1:23:43] Lucifer I took I took that and add to
[1:23:45] our notes tonight and when we read in
[1:23:48] Isaiah chapter uh uh 14 we saw that he
[1:23:52] says I will extend in into heaven I will
[1:23:56] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:24:00] will sit in the Mount of the try it was
[1:24:03] just an eye and an ey and an eye and an
[1:24:08] eye praise the
[1:24:10] Lord I will exalt myself above the stars
[1:24:14] of
[1:24:16] God what what brought him down what cast
[1:24:19] him out is because he was taking the
[1:24:22] preeminence wow
[1:24:25] he was taking the
[1:24:28] preeminence the desire to have the
[1:24:32] preeminence above the stars of
[1:24:35] God and here it said
[1:24:38] John is identifying the same character
[1:24:41] in the
[1:24:43] church this is still the Ephesian church
[1:24:47] this is still the beginning of the
[1:24:49] church and if we have it at the
[1:24:51] beginning we will have it until we go in
[1:24:54] Rapture there will always be
[1:24:58] men there will always be
[1:25:02] men that we want to have the
[1:25:05] preeminence praise the Lord you see that
[1:25:08] is the beautiful
[1:25:09] thing about the word of
[1:25:13] God is that no
[1:25:16] man's understanding of the word is the
[1:25:20] interpretation of the word the
[1:25:22] interpretation of the word only it comes
[1:25:25] to a prophet that's
[1:25:27] right he's the one that God give that's
[1:25:30] what that's the word the ministry of a
[1:25:32] prophet
[1:25:33] is praise the
[1:25:35] Lord your understanding is just an
[1:25:40] inspiration my understanding is just an
[1:25:43] inspiration but when a man try to exer
[1:25:46] his understanding that until you see it
[1:25:50] the way that I see it my you are wrong
[1:25:55] then we have a spirit here yes sir of a
[1:25:58] man that is trying to take their
[1:26:00] preeminence among the Brethren
[1:26:03] yes praise the lord we talking about a
[1:26:06] health at church we're talking about
[1:26:08] going going back to full health praise
[1:26:11] the Lorden Adam and Eve enjoy full
[1:26:14] health when when they were under the son
[1:26:18] of
[1:26:20] righteousness as long as they stay under
[1:26:22] the word amen
[1:26:25] as long as the word was having the
[1:26:27] preeminence in their
[1:26:29] home the word was having preeminence in
[1:26:32] Eden they enjoy full health when they
[1:26:36] left the word sickness comes
[1:26:41] in Praise the
[1:26:43] Lord that's the reason
[1:26:46] why in the local church no one is above
[1:26:50] the word right praise the Lord amen amen
[1:26:55] Even in our homes the husband is ahead
[1:26:57] but he's not above the word that's
[1:26:59] right praise the Lord if a woman love
[1:27:03] her husband and he step out of the word
[1:27:05] you're having a god-given responsibility
[1:27:07] to tell him look the scripture did not
[1:27:08] say that that's
[1:27:14] right it's only the word that has the
[1:27:21] preeminence are we together
[1:27:25] now John identifying this thing in the
[1:27:30] church above all I desire that you
[1:27:33] prospered in health even as your soul
[1:27:35] prospered we heard about your testimony
[1:27:37] and how you are you you been a blessing
[1:27:39] to The Strangers that have come among
[1:27:41] you you've been a blessing to the fellow
[1:27:43] laborers that have traveled your
[1:27:46] way but we also
[1:27:48] heard there is
[1:27:51] one that is having the preeminence on
[1:27:54] the
[1:27:56] Brethren praise the Lord it was either
[1:27:59] his way or the
[1:28:03] highway glory be to God and that's
[1:28:06] exactly the way of
[1:28:09] King and so much that God will come down
[1:28:12] and say King if you will do what your
[1:28:14] brother ail it yes

[1:28:39] Myster of God
[1:28:42] revealed in Christ is the Myster of God
[1:28:45] revealed that's
[1:28:47] word we learn and and and he he taught
[1:28:50] us of uh the three four
[1:28:53] purpose of this whole Plan of
[1:28:56] Redemption the one goal that God
[1:29:00] had of stepping out of
[1:29:03] internity expressing
[1:29:05] himself the one goal that was in his
[1:29:10] mind but yet he made known that one go
[1:29:14] in a threefold
[1:29:17] manifestation praise the Lord let's read
[1:29:20] a little on that find a place to close
[1:29:22] it tonight notice God had a three-fold
[1:29:29] purpose in this great mystery
[1:29:32] secret God in his great mystery secret
[1:29:35] that he had before the word began he's
[1:29:39] got a threefold purpose in
[1:29:42] it the first thing was that God wanted
[1:29:47] to reveal himself to his people
[1:29:51] amen God want to be new
[1:29:56] no praise the Lord yes sir Hallelujah
[1:30:00] you see there is one thing about
[1:30:04] adolat
[1:30:06] adolat is where when an image is there
[1:30:10] that image is set up is giv a setting
[1:30:13] name and and and you are only told the
[1:30:16] things that you're not supposed to do
[1:30:19] before he gets angry with
[1:30:21] you praise the Lord
[1:30:24] amen amen you're not supposed to do this
[1:30:27] I mean the things that you need to do to
[1:30:30] appease more than a peing God he desire
[1:30:36] to be
[1:30:39] known praise the Lord more than just the
[1:30:42] dos and the done God's desire is to make
[1:30:48] himself
[1:30:52] known
[1:30:55] praise the Lord
[1:31:00] amen I think that is the attribute that
[1:31:02] is in every
[1:31:05] parent where the the love to tell their
[1:31:08] children about uh their parents and
[1:31:10] where they came from and and uh you know
[1:31:13] and and uh you know and and and just and
[1:31:16] just and and just everything about
[1:31:19] them praise the
[1:31:21] Lord and I believe that's a desire of
[1:31:24] the heavenly
[1:31:25] father that we must know
[1:31:29] him to know him is
[1:31:33] life praise the
[1:31:35] Lord not to know his word and know the
[1:31:38] right quotation to know
[1:31:40] him he want to be
[1:31:43] known praise the
[1:31:47] Lord because in knowing him we get to
[1:31:50] know ourself we get to know where we
[1:31:52] came from
[1:31:54] Our Truth identity the first thing God
[1:31:57] the first thing was that God wanted to
[1:32:00] reveal himself to his people he couldn't
[1:32:02] do that as a great Jehovah God who cover
[1:32:06] all space Time and Eternity he couldn't
[1:32:09] do
[1:32:12] that he's too great to ever be revealed
[1:32:16] to people because it will be too
[1:32:20] mysterious praise the Lord
[1:32:25] amen now I see I see maybe maybe maybe I
[1:32:28] see where that that first that first
[1:32:31] place I was trapped talking about a f
[1:32:33] anointing maybe it was from his
[1:32:35] book maybe because I mentioned that you
[1:32:38] know committing the book that he wrote
[1:32:40] and uh sister Nami Shar that book with
[1:32:43] me maybe that's what trapped me in there
[1:32:45] I was just reading that it just came to
[1:32:46] my mind maybe maybe I'm just saying
[1:32:48] maybe but thank God I'm out of there
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:55] he's too great to ever be revealed to
[1:32:57] people because it will be too
[1:32:59] mysterious and the only way that he
[1:33:02] could express it was to become a son of
[1:33:07] man that God who condem himself yes sir
[1:33:13] praise the Lord just to be
[1:33:17] known just so we can know
[1:33:21] him praise the Lord
[1:33:24] that he's not just this angry being that
[1:33:27] is up
[1:33:28] there the Bible says he's touched by the
[1:33:31] feelings of our
[1:33:35] infes he will
[1:33:37] condescend just so we will know
[1:33:41] him praise the
[1:33:46] Lord the only way that he will uh he
[1:33:50] could express it was to become a son of
[1:33:53] man that's the reason Jesus kept saying
[1:33:56] the son of man see they didn't know what
[1:33:59] he was talking about many of them but
[1:34:02] now you get it he wanted to express
[1:34:06] himself that was the first F the first
[1:34:09] uh uh uh uh part of the three four
[1:34:12] purpose God wanted to be known the
[1:34:15] second the second to have the
[1:34:19] preeminence in his body of
[1:34:21] Believers praise the Lord
[1:34:24] that is his bride that he might live in
[1:34:28] people now he could do that in Adam and
[1:34:32] Eve but sin separated them so now there
[1:34:36] had to there had to be some way to get
[1:34:40] it back
[1:34:41] again praise the Lord hallelujah now see
[1:34:46] see this if if the Lord can help us to
[1:34:49] bring it out uh for us to be able to see
[1:34:51] it tonight this great God
[1:34:54] that wanted to be made known he humbled
[1:34:57] himself the Bible say even to the death
[1:34:59] of the
[1:35:00] Cross he condemns himself he made
[1:35:04] himself so
[1:35:06] simple and then when he's known among
[1:35:09] his
[1:35:10] people that gave them a Grace of
[1:35:15] Revelation to put this one that has made
[1:35:18] himself so simple to put him back to his
[1:35:21] first place that's right amen
[1:35:24] amen praise the Lord amen amen
[1:35:29] amen not everyone has the ability to do
[1:35:32] that that's right it's a grace of God
[1:35:35] Amen praise the Lord yes sir take take
[1:35:39] it in our natural our natural h h h
[1:35:43] relationship you know uh uh uh parents

[1:35:50] they get uh H H better education than
[1:35:52] their parents
[1:35:55] praise the Lord they get more degree
[1:35:58] than their parents and and then pretty
[1:35:59] soon the the you know were uh they just
[1:36:03] that old man he just he just like his

[1:36:34] another but yet God give us roles in the
[1:36:38] family praise the

[1:36:59] that she's supposed to
[1:37:02] be praise the Lord and that's the reason

[1:37:07] bride that can give Christ the
[1:37:09] preeminence that's
[1:37:12] righten why because she she has been
[1:37:15] given the grace to submit herself to the

[1:39:03] blessed that they don't have time for
[1:39:09] God getting involved in other missions
[1:39:11] and all different things but the
[1:39:16] bride praise the Lord amen that's one of
[1:39:20] his purpose of having a people
[1:39:24] that we give him the first
[1:39:26] place the word had the preeminence in
[1:39:30] eating when Adam was under that word he
[1:39:33] was prospering in health his soul was

[1:39:44] Lord giving Christ the preeminence is
[1:39:47] not being a message believer no praise
[1:39:50] the lord it's not ignoring the courts
[1:39:54] all knowing the three four purpose
[1:39:55] that's that's not that's not giving

[1:40:46] a people that will bring him to that
[1:40:48] place and here is a
[1:40:52] man

[1:41:00] people that it is
[1:41:03] me praise the
[1:41:06] Lord do you see
[1:41:08] how it is so easy to get to that place
[1:41:11] you know what Paul
[1:41:13] said Paul
[1:41:15] said because of the the Revelation that
[1:41:19] has been given to me he said if God did
[1:41:22] not give me an
[1:41:24] reflection okay it could be easy for me
[1:41:27] to exalt
[1:41:29] myself among the rest of the
[1:41:32] disciples so God dropped an infirmity in
[1:41:35] his life and taught him my grace is
[1:41:40] sufficient for

[1:42:29] baptized us he can be the one that marry
[1:42:32] us he might be the one that bury us but
[1:42:35] he might never take that place in our
[1:42:39] lives praise the
[1:42:42] Lord as much as we love our our pastor
