[54:18] revelation chapter 1
[54:21] praise the lord
[54:25] amen this is my personal note it's not
[54:28] supposed to be
[54:33] let's read from verse nine what i want
[54:37] to do with this revelation chapter one
[54:39] tonight
[54:40] if the lord can be our help
[54:44] i want to i want to just encourage you
[54:48] and uh as as we did
[54:52] you know encouraging you to pick up your
[54:54] church age book
[54:55] uh since we got to playing the
[54:59] the the revelation series
[55:03] of the seven church ages and
[55:06] for our our sunday school we want to use
[55:09] there to encourage you like i said if
[55:11] you don't have one of those books
[55:13] we have some back there that we have for
[55:17] library purpose
[55:18] and if you want to buy one we would be
[55:20] glad to sell it to you
[55:22] we sell it the price that we bought it
[55:24] so we're not making no money out of you
[55:26] praise the lord
[55:28] amen and uh uh
[55:32] uh and yeah just in the introduction
[55:36] it says that uh this book holds
[55:39] all the major doctrine of the bible
[55:43] praise the lord and i think as as a
[55:46] church
[55:48] as we beginning to grow we must get off
[55:51] the milks
[55:52] and stairs to eat the food
[55:57] what is the church what makes a church
[55:59] is what this stands for
[56:02] and what this church stands for is it is
[56:04] its doctrine
[56:06] praise the lord the prophet of god said
[56:09] the doctrine is the backbone of the
[56:11] church
[56:12] and uh
[56:16] we you know we really never
[56:20] decided to approach things doctrine uh
[56:22] on
[56:23] on a doctrinal matter uh
[56:26] all because we we were trying to be nice
[56:32] praise the lord because sometimes when
[56:35] you start well you start
[56:38] taking doctrine of things that's when
[56:40] people sign up
[56:41] you know because sometimes they want to
[56:43] stay the way they are
[56:45] but uh i think we appreciate changes
[56:48] with growth
[56:50] so uh it would be good especially you
[56:52] young people
[56:54] uh get one of those church each book and
[56:57] read it
[56:59] the the internet edge is taking books
[57:02] away from our hands
[57:04] you know we can we can take our cell
[57:07] phone and
[57:08] scroll it down if you if you get on your
[57:10] cell phone you want to read it i mean
[57:11] that's nice
[57:12] you know you want to read it on your
[57:13] ipad it prays a lot of good
[57:15] as long as you are reading it whatever
[57:17] you want to read it on you know
[57:19] you want to read it on the chuck ball i
[57:22] think you will learn better after you
[57:23] finish writing all of those pages on the
[57:25] chalkboard
[57:26] they're going to stick in your head
[57:27] [Laughter]

[1:02:16] a comparison some chords
[1:02:20] on
[1:02:30] it would not be in my notes tonight
[1:02:32] because
[1:02:38] i compiled some quotes and
[1:02:41] in these quotes
[1:02:47] brother brown was talking about uh uh
[1:02:50] commentaries
[1:02:51] you know commentaries he said uh uh and
[1:02:55] the reason why
[1:02:56] i'm i want to refer to this is because
[1:02:59] he referred to the seventh church age
[1:03:01] book
[1:03:02] as a commentary that he has
[1:03:06] written on the book of revelation
[1:03:11] praise the lord he said the 77th church
[1:03:14] each book was
[1:03:16] a commentary that he has written
[1:03:19] we know that he asks brother the bill to
[1:03:22] help him write it
[1:03:24] but uh
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:29] and and i mean there are few
[1:03:32] few places where
[1:03:43] where he sits dead and
[1:04:09] okay i don't have much time tonight so i
[1:04:12] won't take
[1:04:13] take off all the time but you you can
[1:04:16] check that out you will see that
[1:04:18] you know that uh he referred to dashing
[1:04:22] he talked about writing another
[1:04:24] commentary on divine healing
[1:04:28] and all of that well so
[1:04:32] uh i'm just i'm just saying that
[1:04:36] you know to to kind of give you an
[1:04:38] appetite
[1:04:39] to to be able to pick up uh
[1:04:43] the church each book and read and
[1:04:47] you want to you want to read it in a
[1:04:49] group you want to read it as a family
[1:04:51] you want to read it you know uh my
[1:04:53] husband and wife it
[1:04:55] is it's just a wonderful book to read
[1:04:57] you know with all the subtitles

[1:05:03] you can just fight your way from one
[1:05:05] subtitle to another
[1:05:08] and close it but it's a wonderful book
[1:05:13] i'm sure that the lord will bless you
[1:05:15] and you begin to see
[1:05:16] things that that you will
[1:05:20] appreciate are we together
[1:05:24] praise the lord amen i was
[1:05:27] i was playing the message on my way here
[1:05:30] to
[1:05:30] uh arrived from work and i was playing
[1:05:34] the message proving his word
[1:05:36] and and you know when and and brought
[1:05:39] branham
[1:05:40] shares something i almost preached
[1:05:42] proving his word tonight because
[1:05:44] i was just so inspired when he said that
[1:05:47] and
[1:05:47] and and what inspired me is that he was
[1:05:49] talking about
[1:05:50] jesus coming to the
[1:05:53] to the jairus house when his little girl
[1:05:57] died
[1:05:58] praise the lord and he says and he went
[1:06:02] to that minister's house
[1:06:04] and he that ministers that minister
[1:06:06] little daughter died
[1:06:08] and he said uh but when he got there
[1:06:11] they said they get
[1:06:12] is dead and he said but
[1:06:16] jesus said to get is asleep
[1:06:21] she's not dead so he said i just enjoy
[1:06:25] this
[1:06:25] he said and then he put them out to
[1:06:28] prove his word
[1:06:32] that she was asleep yes
[1:06:35] praise the lord he said she was asleep
[1:06:39] so he had to prove his word
[1:06:44] by waking her up amen
[1:06:48] praise the lord amen
[1:06:53] if you just think about it with with all
[1:06:55] with all the
[1:06:56] the the bad news they had about jesus
[1:06:59] and
[1:07:00] all that you know the the thing that the
[1:07:02] scandal that was in the papers
[1:07:04] you know uh uh if they uh behind any
[1:07:07] form of
[1:07:08] internet those days they have all sorts
[1:07:10] of lying information
[1:07:12] how he was born of illegitimate child
[1:07:14] and you know
[1:07:15] uh and and and i mean the people
[1:07:19] the people that believe in jesus
[1:07:23] they they had a personal experience
[1:07:26] that's right amen they had a conviction
[1:07:33] for them to be going against the order
[1:07:36] of that day
[1:07:39] going against the system that they were
[1:07:42] raised
[1:07:43] under the church system and all the
[1:07:46] different things
[1:07:47] and to be following the man that had
[1:07:50] such a
[1:07:51] social scandal made made of scandal
[1:07:56] praise the lord they might have had
[1:08:00] an experience something that they cannot
[1:08:03] explain
[1:08:06] praise the lord even nicodemus came by
[1:08:11] night
[1:08:11] and said we
[1:08:14] we know we the sahendra's counsel
[1:08:19] know that no man
[1:08:22] can do these things yes
[1:08:26] except god be with him
[1:08:29] praise the lord amen and i heard brother
[1:08:31] bran saying today on tape
[1:08:33] he said these things were not done in a
[1:08:37] that's corner these things were not done
[1:08:40] in the corner
[1:08:41] i'm going to speak on something tonight
[1:08:43] but uh uh
[1:08:44] uh i'll just i just leave there for
[1:08:46] another time but what i was going to
[1:08:48] speak about
[1:08:49] is that that's what i want you to get in
[1:08:50] the church book because
[1:08:52] i mean you you're really going to learn
[1:08:56] many things there
[1:08:58] scripturally this is a scriptural order
[1:09:02] and that is the reason why people
[1:09:06] frown at gift in the church because we
[1:09:09] are living in such an
[1:09:11] age where there is a proud spirit that
[1:09:14] one of our digital age is a proud spirit
[1:09:17] for the person to be blind and you don't
[1:09:19] know it it's because
[1:09:20] they are too proud to realize what their
[1:09:22] situation
[1:09:23] is and because of this proud spirit that
[1:09:27] is
[1:09:27] in the church it make the people
[1:09:34] they re they they don't want to be
[1:09:36] corrected
[1:09:38] they resent correction
[1:09:42] and when when you resent correction
[1:09:45] god can use you
[1:09:50] you know why i say that because i call
[1:09:52] into the book of
[1:09:54] corinthians when the gift comes to the
[1:09:57] church
[1:09:59] every birth is a mess
[1:10:03] and if you have a gift and you mess up
[1:10:05] the world must correct
[1:10:07] you
[1:10:11] and because people don't want to be
[1:10:14] corrected
[1:10:17] so even if they have a gift
[1:10:24] they either shot away from it or they
[1:10:26] suppress it or they quench the spirit
[1:10:28] they greet the holy ghost and and all of
[1:10:30] that because they don't want to be
[1:10:32] corrected
[1:10:35] that's a scriptural order
[1:10:38] paul said if one prophesied
[1:10:41] and uh that this will happen
[1:10:45] and it don't happen
[1:10:48] that person must immediately realize it
[1:10:51] does not have
[1:10:52] anything to do with your salvation you
[1:10:54] will just honor a wrong influence
[1:10:57] and you must be delivered from that
[1:10:58] spirit
[1:11:00] now let me say this
[1:11:03] let me say this because i i've i've i
[1:11:06] wanted to
[1:11:07] preach this thing in in in the talk that
[1:11:09] i had
[1:11:10] that's the problem with all of these
[1:11:12] people
[1:11:13] that have been following this message
[1:11:17] for 20 30 40 years if you come to the
[1:11:21] place and realize
[1:11:22] that all of these years you've been
[1:11:24] wrong if you really
[1:11:27] have the holy ghost you will sit down
[1:11:30] and ask god to deliver you you see the
[1:11:34] reason why
[1:11:35] people are fussing against the message
[1:11:37] is because they are under a wrong spirit
[1:11:41] the scriptural order i realized i've
[1:11:44] been deceived all of these years
[1:11:46] sit down push yourself
[1:11:49] yes sir right
[1:11:53] you're not going to start digging in the
[1:11:54] scripture and brother branham said that
[1:11:56] he was wrong here
[1:11:57] you are just honor a wrong spirit
[1:12:01] you are honor a wrong spirit if they
[1:12:03] really believe the bible
[1:12:05] they will follow the scriptural order
[1:12:13] praise the lord
[1:12:18] he will follow that's that scripture or
[1:12:20] order goals
[1:12:22] for for for every everyone if a man is
[1:12:25] preaching and he's preaching the wrong
[1:12:26] doctrine and he realized
[1:12:28] that he's preaching something contrary
[1:12:30] to the word he must push himself
[1:12:33] he must sit down
[1:12:36] because if you don't do it you will go
[1:12:38] from one error
[1:12:40] to another error to another error
[1:12:46] and then when you start manifesting in
[1:12:48] your flesh it just become a mess
[1:12:57] that just might advise for these
[1:12:58] brothers
[1:13:00] some of them are good brothers they love
[1:13:02] the lord you know
[1:13:04] they they are trying to be concerned for
[1:13:06] their soul but if you have gone 40 years
[1:13:11] and that now you realize you were wrong
[1:13:13] sit down
[1:13:15] you don't have nothing to tell sit down
[1:13:18] and push yourself
[1:13:20] that's exactly what the apostle paul did
[1:13:25] three years at the back side of the
[1:13:27] desert
[1:13:28] to push himself yes he did
[1:13:32] yes he did
[1:13:36] and that goes for every gift whether you
[1:13:38] are a song leader you are a preacher you
[1:13:40] are a musician
[1:13:41] if a man is wrong on a wrong anointing
[1:13:46] you will sit down and push yourself
[1:13:49] that's the scripture or it's good for
[1:13:51] you
[1:13:54] you don't have to be preaching you don't
[1:13:56] have to be it does not have to be a
[1:13:58] public gift
[1:14:00] that's right when you realize you've
[1:14:02] been entertaining the wrong spirit
[1:14:04] push yourself of it
[1:14:09] you'd be entertaining the wrong thought
[1:14:12] thinking about a brother or thinking
[1:14:13] about
[1:14:14] a sister and you just think that person
[1:14:16] don't like me or that
[1:14:17] and you just keep feeling on that keep
[1:14:19] feeding them push yourself here because
[1:14:21] if you don't do
[1:14:22] it it's going to harm to you
[1:14:26] praise the lord it's definitely going to
[1:14:29] haunt you
[1:14:30] and before you realize you start feeling
[1:14:33] better that person don't even know about
[1:14:35] it you just start feeling ugly in
[1:14:40] right brother yourself yes
[1:14:45] absolutely sometimes it don't even have
[1:14:47] to be
[1:14:48] something major i mean that's the reason
[1:14:50] why christians take time to concentrate
[1:14:52] themselves
[1:14:52] are you doing you just pushing yourself

[1:16:50] will actually put us to the place
[1:16:52] for us to realize uh where we are
[1:16:55] because

[1:16:58] representing the church
[1:16:59] john represented the bride of all the
[1:17:02] ages amen
[1:17:03] from the first church age to the last
[1:17:05] church age
[1:17:06] sunday we were trying to talk about the
[1:17:08] home landing and we were just trying to
[1:17:10] bring
[1:17:11] something memorable for independence
[1:17:14] but uh uh
[1:17:19] we realized that our land is not a
[1:17:22] physical lane
[1:17:26] our land god gave israel a promise
[1:17:30] he gave israel a natural promise
[1:17:34] amen and he gave us a spiritual promise
[1:17:41] praise the lord and and that's why we
[1:17:45] read there in the book of ada that this
[1:17:47] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:17:50] and to many as the lord our god shall
[1:17:52] call because our promise
[1:17:54] is the holy ghost the holy ghost is our
[1:17:57] homeland
[1:17:58] amen praise the lord
[1:18:02] if you don't have the holy ghost you
[1:18:03] have not arrived yet
[1:18:07] the holy ghost is our homeland

[1:18:39] there but that's not my home lane
[1:18:42] jeffersonville is not my homeland
[1:18:46] my homeland is the holy ghost
[1:18:52] if you don't have the holy ghost you
[1:18:54] have not arrived
[1:18:56] that's the reason why don't take an
[1:18:58] experience for the holy ghost
[1:19:01] don't take a thought for the holy ghost
[1:19:04] don't think because i'm in a message

[1:20:05] praise the lord amen let it possess your
[1:20:08] body
[1:20:10] you will have battles but there is a
[1:20:13] sweet experience that is inside
[1:20:16] praise the lord amen i mean every battle
[1:20:23] what a victory or defeat you know that
[1:20:27] you
[1:20:27] are the man that is in the arena
[1:20:33] you know victory you no defeat
[1:20:43] we might lost some fight but we never
[1:20:45] lost a wall
[1:20:51] so we just want to look at this tonight
[1:20:54] yeah
[1:20:54] john is saying here i want you to watch
[1:20:57] this now
[1:20:58] he's talking here i was in the spirit
[1:21:02] on the lost day and i heard
[1:21:05] behind me now for john to have her
[1:21:08] behind him
[1:21:10] he might have either passed
[1:21:13] or his back is turned to where the voice
[1:21:17] is coming from
[1:21:21] praise the lord now what this will show
[1:21:24] you
[1:21:24] is that it will show you the position of
[1:21:28] john before the church ages was revealed
[1:21:38] follow me now a little bit he says and
[1:21:40] and i heard
[1:21:43] uh behind me a great voice as
[1:21:46] of a trumpet i'm the alpha and omega the
[1:21:49] first
[1:21:50] and the last this is this is
[1:21:53] an introduction of a man amen
[1:21:57] me alfa romenga the first and the last
[1:22:00] he says
[1:22:01] and he's giving john an instruction what
[1:22:03] their series
[1:22:05] write in the book what you see
[1:22:09] where
[1:22:12] what what you see where what you see
[1:22:15] behind you
[1:22:20] follow me a little bit now
[1:22:24] what does syria write in a book and send
[1:22:28] it on to the seven church
[1:22:31] churches which are in asia onto ephesus
[1:22:35] until laodicea he says and john says
[1:22:38] and then i turn now to see the voice
[1:22:42] that was
[1:22:43] that was talking to me praise the lord
[1:22:48] amen so in in in one sense
[1:22:53] john
[1:22:56] is looking back to see the voice let's
[1:22:59] let's let's just go a little bit
[1:23:01] he says i turn to see the voice that
[1:23:04] speak with me
[1:23:05] and being turned i saw seven golden
[1:23:08] candlesticks
[1:23:09] that represent the seven church ages
[1:23:15] and one in the midst of the seven golden
[1:23:18] candlesticks
[1:23:19] that represent this man that is
[1:23:21] introducing himself
[1:23:24] so john is in a position
[1:23:28] between the church ages in some way
[1:23:36] as he's looking back at the church agent
[1:23:38] he's not in the edges
[1:23:40] right he's not in the mess of the seven
[1:23:43] goal in canada
[1:23:44] he's somewhere he was going somewhere
[1:23:47] and he heard a voice sure and he turned
[1:23:51] around
[1:23:52] and then when he looked looking for the
[1:23:54] voice
[1:23:56] he saw seven golden candlestick and he
[1:23:59] saw one
[1:24:00] in the midst of the seventh goal in
[1:24:02] candlestick and this one is
[1:24:04] instructing him that everything you see
[1:24:07] in there
[1:24:08] right so john is in a position
[1:24:14] where the seven golden candles take is
[1:24:16] dead
[1:24:17] and he's he's he's going somewhere
[1:24:20] praise the lord amen
[1:24:24] my goodness i really didn't thought i
[1:24:26] would preach tonight
[1:24:29] but it looks like there is enough
[1:24:32] pulling here tonight
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:39] you love the lord you can see the
[1:24:43] picture
[1:24:45] amen now this book
[1:24:48] is written by jesus himself
[1:24:55] he's the writer of this book
[1:24:59] you'll find all of that in the church
[1:25:01] ages as you read you'll learn that
[1:25:04] but i i just want to show you john
[1:25:10] position
[1:25:12] i want to show you john's position
[1:25:19] john is standing
[1:25:24] he's standing on the bridge or he's
[1:25:27] standing in the bridge
[1:25:29] he's standing between the church ages
[1:25:36] and the rest of time standing between
[1:25:39] the church ages
[1:25:40] and and and eternity
[1:25:44] now watch here now
[1:25:54] in revelation chapter 4 the revelation
[1:25:58] series the preach series now the church
[1:26:00] book
[1:26:01] the preacher version chapter 4 we read
[1:26:04] here now we
[1:26:06] we find that after these things
[1:26:09] after means that after
[1:26:12] the church ages has ceased
[1:26:17] then john was summer to come up higher
[1:26:21] now so
[1:26:22] what what is that pointing us to
[1:26:25] revelation chapter 4
[1:26:28] amen that's why revelation chapter 4
[1:26:31] verse 1
[1:26:34] says
[1:26:36] praise the lord
[1:26:42] revelation chapter 4 verse 1 says after
[1:26:45] this after this
[1:26:51] so that's what brother branham is
[1:26:52] referring to after what
[1:26:56] after the church ages now you see
[1:26:59] that that that is that is the wonderful
[1:27:02] thing
[1:27:03] about a prophet ministry
[1:27:07] people just think a prophet being an
[1:27:10] interpreter of the world
[1:27:11] he's going to bring some kind of
[1:27:13] interpretation from a far blue end that
[1:27:16] you have never heard is just to be able
[1:27:19] to
[1:27:19] pick up those the between the lines
[1:27:28] praise the lord and by the grace of god
[1:27:31] i will show you i'll show you a few of
[1:27:33] those between the lines
[1:27:35] uh uh you know between the lines things
[1:27:39] but uh because i could run what i want
[1:27:41] to say here tonight
[1:27:43] after that so that's what he's referring
[1:27:45] to here
[1:27:46] he says after distance after means dead
[1:27:50] after the church ages has seized then
[1:27:53] john was
[1:27:54] summer to come up higher after these
[1:27:56] things unlocked
[1:27:57] and behold a door was open in heaven and
[1:28:00] the voice
[1:28:01] which i heard was
[1:28:04] as it were of a
[1:28:07] trumpet the very same voice again
[1:28:11] that called john here to turn
[1:28:14] to the seven goalie candlestick is now
[1:28:17] calling john on this other side
[1:28:21] okay the same voice that caught him yet
[1:28:26] and said turn he turn and lock
[1:28:29] write all these things as soon as he
[1:28:31] finished the voice call him on the other
[1:28:33] side come up higher
[1:28:38] are you seeing the picture
[1:28:44] are we together
[1:28:51] which means come up
[1:28:56] he showed him all that were going to
[1:29:01] happen
[1:29:02] in the world of the church ages
[1:29:06] then after the church ages was over we
[1:29:10] find then that john
[1:29:13] was a type of every true believer
[1:29:16] now so he showed him all the things that
[1:29:19] was happening in the world now
[1:29:21] you see you see
[1:29:25] the wednesday night is not enough for
[1:29:26] this but we try
[1:29:28] [Laughter]
[1:29:32] now so you see what i want you to see
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:35] understand and appreciate is that uh
[1:29:40] john is now shown all the things
[1:29:44] i want to say this way john is showing
[1:29:47] the flashing red light john is showing
[1:29:51] even me clever prophecy john
[1:29:54] is now being shown the world is falling
[1:29:57] apart again
[1:29:58] the condition of the church john is
[1:30:01] shown
[1:30:01] all those things
[1:30:06] praise the lord
[1:30:17] are you understanding what i'm saying
[1:30:18] tonight
[1:30:21] amen
[1:30:26] it will help you to understand
[1:30:29] that those those inspiration besides
[1:30:33] the the the the healing services that
[1:30:37] brother branham had
[1:30:39] right those inspiration that he had
[1:30:43] when he was burdened to preach a message
[1:30:46] recognizing your day
[1:30:49] and this message that's what the angel
[1:30:52] was doing to
[1:30:53] john to recognize where you are john
[1:30:59] talking about birth pains
[1:31:03] those were not just titles
[1:31:10] those were the things that john was
[1:31:14] shown
[1:31:17] the word in its condition
[1:31:20] the church in its condition
[1:31:25] john was pointed back look at that
[1:31:33] praise the lord because you see the
[1:31:35] thing about it there is that
[1:31:37] is it's hard for you for the person
[1:31:41] to really be able to identify
[1:31:46] their ugly state when they are in it
[1:31:50] most of the time they don't even agree
[1:31:53] nothing wrong with me what wrong with me
[1:31:55] what do you see
[1:31:58] amen it's after when they come
[1:32:01] out of it and it looked out wow
[1:32:06] wow was that the kind of a life i was
[1:32:10] living
[1:32:10] wow wow
[1:32:15] but when you are in it nothing wrong
[1:32:17] with it
[1:32:20] everybody is foolish to you
[1:32:23] amen they are just
[1:32:26] they are just wacky their brain don't
[1:32:28] work they don't see anything
[1:32:30] you know you want to catch up with the
[1:32:33] faction of the world you want to
[1:32:34] you know it's you are in it
[1:32:41] and see that that is the reason why
[1:32:44] john had to be out
[1:32:48] and now he was shown the word
[1:32:52] that's the reason why revelation chapter
[1:32:55] 18 4 say come out of her my people
[1:33:00] brother branham said the same voice that
[1:33:02] called revelation 18
[1:33:04] 4 is identified in revelation chapter 3
[1:33:07] after knocking at the door it was that
[1:33:10] voice that was saying
[1:33:11] come out
[1:33:19] are we together
[1:33:23] that's the reason why this revelation
[1:33:26] could
[1:33:27] could not has come in the first church
[1:33:29] age
[1:33:33] because john was part of it he was in
[1:33:35] the first church age
[1:33:39] the second church is it could not have
[1:33:41] come unto laodicea church age
[1:33:44] which is the pentecostal age
[1:33:47] it had to be after
[1:33:54] then now the bride is now shown
[1:33:58] see where you came out of see the
[1:34:01] system you came out of
[1:34:09] are we together are you seeing the
[1:34:11] picture
[1:34:13] what i'm trying to do tonight i'm trying
[1:34:15] to show you a movie
[1:34:17] i want to grab your attention so you can
[1:34:20] be caught up in this picture
[1:34:27] praise the lord so john
[1:34:31] the church traveling from ephesus to
[1:34:34] laudisha
[1:34:36] he comes out of laodicea he's on his way
[1:34:39] and the voice turned around he said
[1:34:42] look back
[1:34:46] you think about the preview of the bride
[1:34:53] when the first church was marching
[1:34:57] that's right that was
[1:35:01] the episode church
[1:35:04] sure and then when the days of the
[1:35:06] nicolaitans and
[1:35:08] all the false teaching entered they
[1:35:10] started dancing to rock and roll
[1:35:14] dancing to rock and roll taking off
[1:35:17] their clothes
[1:35:18] little by little when it got to laudisha
[1:35:21] they were completely naked
[1:35:24] and they didn't know about it and
[1:35:26] brother branham crying that vision and
[1:35:27] say is this what we have
[1:35:29] is this what we have lived for
[1:35:36] then the voice says the bride would come
[1:35:40] again
[1:35:43] praise the lord so you see that that
[1:35:46] shows
[1:35:46] john from ephesus
[1:35:50] walking he's the bride he's he
[1:35:53] represents the bride
[1:35:54] in every age
[1:36:01] praise the lord
[1:36:07] you represent the bride in every age
[1:36:10] now the bride has walked through
[1:36:14] the seven church ages and the voice call
[1:36:17] said look back seven golden candlestick
[1:36:23] amen and there was one in the midst of
[1:36:26] the seven golden candlestick
[1:36:28] and since now everything you see you
[1:36:31] write it
[1:36:32] so john is standing right here now
[1:36:34] writing everything he sees
[1:36:38] the messenger of uh ephesus the
[1:36:40] messenger
[1:36:41] of uh uh philadelph all the church ages
[1:36:45] and the voices the message to the ages
[1:36:47] john is writing all of that
[1:36:52] are you getting the picture
[1:37:02] young people
[1:37:08] this message don't stop it to
[1:37:12] just your dress call
[1:37:16] and think because you dress in decent
[1:37:19] you are in the message
[1:37:21] don't stop it this message is more than
[1:37:23] dress code
[1:37:28] it's more than dress code
[1:37:34] this message is a person
[1:37:38] is the person of jesus christ
[1:37:46] is the person of jesus christ
[1:37:59] are we together so you see
[1:38:04] here uh let's let's read here
[1:38:07] uh uh now we find
[1:38:10] after these things after means death
[1:38:13] after the church ages has ceased
[1:38:16] then john was summoned to come up higher
[1:38:19] come up higher which means come up here
[1:38:21] he showed him all that was
[1:38:25] going to happen in the world of the
[1:38:28] church ages
[1:38:31] then after the church ages was over
[1:38:35] we find then that john was a type of
[1:38:38] every true believer
[1:38:40] that will be summer by christ on high
[1:38:44] summer come up higher
[1:38:48] and we find out that the voice we speak
[1:38:51] we we spoke to him was
[1:38:55] the voice of a trumpet now so you see
[1:38:59] over in revelation chapter 1 the voice
[1:39:02] was a trumpet
[1:39:04] over in revelation chapter 4 1 the voice
[1:39:07] was a trumpet so it was the same voice
[1:39:11] just speaking from two different
[1:39:13] direction
[1:39:19] because what what is a trumpet giving
[1:39:22] for to assemble the people
[1:39:27] so a trumpet called john to look back
[1:39:30] look at the church
[1:39:31] in his condition and everything you see
[1:39:35] right yes
[1:39:39] are we together
[1:39:42] now so uh uh
[1:39:46] we find that the voice that spoke to him
[1:39:49] was the voice of a trumpet
[1:39:51] clear distinguished and it was the same
[1:39:55] voice
[1:39:55] that spoke to him year on earth
[1:40:01] so one voice spoke to him year on earth
[1:40:05] and another voice spoke to him from
[1:40:08] heaven
[1:40:10] praise the lord oh my goodness i can run
[1:40:12] down the eye with this one brother
[1:40:14] jordan
[1:40:17] praise the lord but it's a wednesday
[1:40:20] night
[1:40:29] it was the same voice that spoke to him
[1:40:31] here on earth see
[1:40:32] as long as he was in the midst of the
[1:40:36] seven golden candlestick
[1:40:38] he was speaking
[1:40:41] to or from or
[1:40:44] i i like that
[1:40:48] speaking from the seven goal encounters
[1:40:51] not
[1:40:52] john speaking now but the alpha and
[1:40:54] nominee
[1:40:56] the one in the midst of the seven golden
[1:40:58] candlestick
[1:40:59] amen as long as he was speaking from the
[1:41:02] church
[1:41:02] he was speaking on earth
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:12] see he was in the seventh
[1:41:16] he was in a candlestick speaking
[1:41:18] speaking from them
[1:41:20] to his church
[1:41:24] then when the church ages seized
[1:41:29] he left the earth and move up into
[1:41:32] the heavens
[1:41:36] and call his redeemed up with him
[1:41:42] praise the lord
[1:41:46] that's the reason why seven angels
[1:41:52] had to bring
[1:41:56] the rapture message
[1:42:01] because the bride was no longer going to
[1:42:04] year from earth
[1:42:06] christ was kicked out of the church
[1:42:09] she will now be hearing from heaven
[1:42:20] praise the lord
[1:42:24] so you see you cannot
[1:42:28] you cannot start another pentecostal
[1:42:30] church with this message
[1:42:33] you will fail sure
[1:42:39] praise the lord you will fail you
[1:42:42] you try emotion you will burn out
[1:42:47] i mean you will burn out because you
[1:42:50] will go with such a speed and you will
[1:42:51] lose your breath
[1:42:53] and there will be no strength
[1:42:56] and that's that's where many people are
[1:42:58] coming home
[1:43:03] out of it i mean they have done all of
[1:43:07] that
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:15] i was uh on the weekend i was i was
[1:43:18] studying and i was just
[1:43:19] listing all the doctrines that have come
[1:43:22] out of this message
[1:43:24] and they have all filled away
[1:43:28] the word christ is still standing strong
[1:43:36] praise the lord
[1:43:42] the word christ is still standing strong
[1:43:45] people have tried to you know
[1:43:49] bring us to worship brother branham it
[1:43:51] fit away
[1:43:54] amen people have tried to
[1:43:58] uh uh i mean the broad millennium the
[1:44:01] broad polygamy the broad
[1:44:03] uh uh uh
[1:44:09] how you call it now i'm kind of looking
[1:44:12] for
[1:44:12] the the greek word here but uh
[1:44:16] uh two souls and and and two laws
[1:44:19] and i mean there's there's no time for
[1:44:22] that tonight
[1:44:28] seven thunders and i mean in all of that
[1:44:32] they have brought it and they have all
[1:44:34] failed
[1:44:36] right everyone came with with its
[1:44:40] you know emotions and grabbed the people
[1:44:44] and they thought it was it
[1:44:48] you know millennial and all of that
[1:44:52] that's the reason why you have to fall
[1:44:54] in love with jesus christ
[1:44:57] fall in love with jesus christ
[1:45:02] fall in love with this word let it be so
[1:45:05] precious to you
[1:45:16] don't worry if you don't know what about
[1:45:18] those doctrine then there is nothing
[1:45:20] good for you to know about them anyway
[1:45:22] so don't worry about it amen
[1:45:25] but i will have if i have if we have
[1:45:27] time i will take you through some of
[1:45:28] them in
[1:45:29] and and just exposed what the devil was
[1:45:31] trying to do
[1:45:33] praise the lord amen
[1:45:39] then when the church aged sees he left
[1:45:42] and moved
[1:45:43] up into the heavens now bible said this
[1:45:45] let me just
[1:45:46] get through this quickly and i think
[1:45:48] i've
[1:45:49] i've given you i've given you a picture
[1:45:51] now for you to look at
[1:45:53] so when you're reading the book of
[1:45:54] revelation see what he says here he says
[1:45:58] feast of the trumpet his first quote he
[1:45:59] says that the first
[1:46:01] three chapters of the book of revelation
[1:46:04] reveal
[1:46:05] all the happiness onto the church
[1:46:10] we just read where john was showing
[1:46:14] all that was happening so all that was
[1:46:17] happening
[1:46:18] is right here in the first three
[1:46:20] churches in the first three chapters
[1:46:29] praise the lord all that was happening
[1:46:32] i mean every doctrine every
[1:46:36] cut every evil spirit
[1:46:40] that have ever hanged around the church
[1:46:42] is right here in revelation 1-3
[1:46:52] praise the lord
[1:46:56] when you read history you realize that
[1:46:58] when when when
[1:47:00] when luther got the inspiration that the
[1:47:03] just shall live by faith
[1:47:05] and and and and and he was standing
[1:47:07] against the church just just imagine he
[1:47:10] was a catholic priest
[1:47:14] he was a catholic priest and god just
[1:47:18] gave him that inspiration and and and
[1:47:21] and and
[1:47:22] there there were there were there were a
[1:47:23] lot of people i mean it just opened
[1:47:25] people's eyes people started
[1:47:27] saying i mean what what i mean what have
[1:47:28] we been reading you know
[1:47:30] i mean the bible was was i mean in in
[1:47:33] all sorts of different forms
[1:47:36] praise the lord you go into all of these
[1:47:38] different groups there's a group there
[1:47:39] now in
[1:47:40] in in indiana where the grace of god has
[1:47:43] god among the amish people and many of
[1:47:45] them
[1:47:46] are coming to the lord jesus christ they
[1:47:48] are because why they are getting
[1:47:50] their hands on the bible
[1:47:54] and realizing that all of these years
[1:47:57] what they
[1:47:57] what they talk was the bible something
[1:48:00] written in in one old faction
[1:48:02] german that they can't even understand
[1:48:09] only the elders can understand so
[1:48:11] whatever interpretation they give them
[1:48:12] they just swallow it
[1:48:19] one old-fashioned german
[1:48:26] yeah the guy says they don't they just
[1:48:28] they i mean they just chewed their mouth
[1:48:30] when they are reading yep
[1:48:36] they can't even pronounce it they can't
[1:48:38] even understand it
[1:48:39] but because they are other they have to
[1:48:41] perform
[1:48:45] praise the lord
[1:48:48] and you know what could have happened
[1:48:52] if we did not have this message on tapes
[1:48:55] for you to be able to listen to her
[1:48:58] people will tell you things that brother
[1:49:00] branham said
[1:49:02] that's right
[1:49:06] it's still on tape and it's trying to
[1:49:08] confuse us how much more if it was not
[1:49:10] on tag
[1:49:16] praise the lord yes sir
[1:49:19] a person can just say one paragraph
[1:49:23] and explain it the way you want to
[1:49:25] explain it
[1:49:32] and there is no footing in the bible
[1:49:39] he cannot trace that thought back to the
[1:49:54] bible
[1:49:56] praise the lord
[1:49:59] i've i you know i've used to say this
[1:50:02] years back i said
[1:50:03] we didn't have this message they will
[1:50:05] have to whip some people
[1:50:07] to get the holy ghost
[1:50:12] praise the lord amen
[1:50:18] most especially the ones that love
[1:50:20] laying on hands
[1:50:24] they will have people lay hands on them
[1:50:28] with a king
[1:50:32] so the first three chapters of the book
[1:50:34] of revelation reveal
[1:50:37] all the happiness onto the church
[1:50:41] and then from the 10th chapter on to
[1:50:45] the 19th chapter of the revelation there
[1:50:48] is
[1:50:48] no more sin of the church
[1:50:52] praise the lord amen
[1:50:55] do you know that people in this message
[1:50:57] that believe brother branham says this
[1:50:59] so we must not preach
[1:51:01] from any of those chapter because it
[1:51:04] does not concern the church
[1:51:08] a complete misunderstanding right
[1:51:20] the church goes up at the
[1:51:23] fourth chapter of revelation and return
[1:51:25] back
[1:51:26] at the 19th chapter of revelation
[1:51:30] the bride and the groom together come to
[1:51:33] the earth
[1:51:34] and then from the 19th chapter
[1:51:37] to the conclusive of
[1:51:41] of the 22nd chapter and it's all
[1:51:45] it's all on the millennium and what will
[1:51:47] be
[1:51:48] in the years that is to follow
[1:51:51] praise the lord but that's what i wanted
[1:51:54] to grab
[1:51:54] grab your attention to show you how
[1:51:59] where all that was happening
[1:52:02] the flashing red light of his coming
[1:52:06] amen and right in revelation chapter 2
[1:52:09] he kept saying behold i come
[1:52:11] quickly that was the flashing red light
[1:52:14] of his coming
[1:52:17] before i come
[1:52:28] praise the lord let me just read one
[1:52:30] more quote here to you
[1:52:33] very important so uh uh just listening
[1:52:36] and then we will close
[1:52:37] here feast of the trumpet again he says
[1:52:42] this is the complete revelation of jesus
[1:52:44] christ
[1:52:45] and the seven seals how the mystery hit
[1:52:49] of
[1:52:49] what it all was
[1:52:55] and it's supposed to open in
[1:53:00] the last day now you see that's the
[1:53:02] reason why
[1:53:04] i i was talking about the loosing of the
[1:53:06] seals the releasing of christ
[1:53:11] amen
[1:53:15] just trying to find the best word so you
[1:53:18] can be able to understand what what
[1:53:20] actually it is
[1:53:25] because here is it take take for example
[1:53:27] yet now
[1:53:28] john going through the first church age
[1:53:32] remember now he was part of the
[1:53:34] believers in in
[1:53:38] pentecost
[1:53:40] okay he was part of the believer at
[1:53:43] pentecost the birth of the church he saw
[1:53:45] all of that
[1:53:46] you know going from the first church age
[1:53:50] and he traveled through the church ages
[1:53:55] and did not even understand
[1:53:58] until the voice called his attention
[1:54:04] the one in the midst of the seven golden
[1:54:06] candlestick
[1:54:07] now start to tell him in the ephesus
[1:54:10] church
[1:54:11] age
[1:54:14] start started to point out things to him
[1:54:20] praise the lord that is as much
[1:54:23] as people that can walk in this
[1:54:26] message and still don't understand
[1:54:29] what it's all about they take it to be a
[1:54:32] church
[1:54:34] they take it to be another form of
[1:54:35] religion
[1:54:39] they can walk all these years
[1:54:42] around this message and still don't
[1:54:45] understand what
[1:54:46] it is
[1:54:53] wow in this message we can play this
[1:54:56] this message it's not just for everybody
[1:54:59] this
[1:55:00] they try to make it like something
[1:55:12] he went from the first age and walked
[1:55:16] through
[1:55:18] a representation through the church ages
[1:55:23] and never had an idea
[1:55:26] what the seven golden candlestick meant
[1:55:30] he never had an idea
[1:55:35] never had an idea until the voice
[1:55:40] called his attention and then he turned
[1:55:44] around
[1:55:47] and a voice starts to show him
[1:55:50] everything
[1:55:51] this thing is connected to this
[1:55:55] world war one was the first war world
[1:55:58] war
[1:55:59] ii was the second war and the voice
[1:56:02] started to explain all of that to john
[1:56:17] are we together this is the complete
[1:56:20] revelation of jesus christ
[1:56:22] and the and the in this and the seventh
[1:56:24] seal how the mystery hate
[1:56:27] of what it all was and it's supposed to
[1:56:30] be open
[1:56:31] in the last days to some preachers
[1:56:35] this message is just to condemn
[1:56:37] denomination
[1:56:38] they just condemn nobody will be saved
[1:56:41] they just condemn anything they just
[1:56:43] condemn
[1:56:48] a smart religious way to to be
[1:56:51] rude any sought
[1:56:55] a very soft religious way
[1:56:59] to be arrogant
[1:57:02] that's why they call the message of the
[1:57:04] hour right
[1:57:06] we are in the message
[1:57:11] yes sir
[1:57:16] this is the complete revelation of jesus

[1:57:31] age at the end time
[1:57:37] now let me give you another picture now
[1:57:40] watch very closely
[1:57:42] so john year at ephesus
[1:57:47] going through with all of this what is
[1:57:50] happening
[1:57:51] everything that is happening here is
[1:57:54] sealed to him
[1:57:56] because he does not understand it it's a
[1:57:58] mystery it sealed to him
[1:58:02] he had to come to the end
[1:58:06] to the end of time for him to
[1:58:10] understand everything that happened back
[1:58:14] there
[1:58:14] and that was what our voice called him
[1:58:18] for
[1:58:21] to open his understanding
[1:58:25] just like jesus did those men on the
[1:58:27] road of emirates
[1:58:29] opened their understanding
[1:58:33] at the end of time he walked with them
[1:58:39] from the beginning he walked with them
[1:58:44] just talking about scripture they were
[1:58:46] blind

[1:59:16] the end of the day he took a breath
[1:59:21] and he broke it yes then they remember
[1:59:27] they remember the eyes were open
