[44:05] we'll try to find a way to finish our
[44:09] our
[44:12] subject that we started
[44:14] on uh
[44:17] on uh sunday
[44:20] we try to find uh
[44:22] get back to dating
[44:24] and be able to
[44:27] properly arrange ourselves
[44:29] and get in
[44:31] and be able to go back and
[44:34] i would have loved to gone through the
[44:36] entire
[44:38] uh
[44:39] matthew chapter 24
[44:43] in parallel with revelation chapter six
[44:45] but we'll get back to that
[44:47] so uh uh let's look at
[44:51] something here that paul
[44:55] addressed to
[44:58] the believers here
[45:04] i want to find a
[45:06] decent place to start from
[45:14] the verse i want to read is verse
[45:16] 12. let's look at verse 12.
[45:29] for what
[45:30] for when for the time you ought to be
[45:33] teachers
[45:35] you have need that won't teach you again
[45:40] which be the first principle
[45:44] of the oracles of god
[45:47] the phrase the first principle of the
[45:49] oracles of god
[45:51] caught my mind
[45:52] when i was uh
[45:54] reading
[45:55] uh studying true yet a little bit
[45:58] the first principle of the oracle of god
[46:00] so paul is saying teaching
[46:03] is the first principle
[46:05] of the oracle of god
[46:07] for when
[46:08] for when for the time you ought to be
[46:11] teachers
[46:12] you have need that
[46:14] won't teach you again
[46:16] which be the first principle
[46:19] of the oracle of god and
[46:22] uh become such
[46:26] as have need of milk
[46:28] and net of strong meat
[46:32] for everyone that uses milk is
[46:35] unskillful
[46:37] in the word of righteousness
[46:40] for he is a babe
[46:42] but strong meat belonged to them that
[46:45] are of full age
[46:47] which is those that are mature
[46:50] even those who by reason
[46:54] of youths have their senses exercised
[46:59] to discern both good and evil
[47:03] let's pray together
[47:05] heavenly father
[47:07] lord uh we just want to
[47:09] look at
[47:10] this first principle lord
[47:13] and so we are asking tonight
[47:16] that you bless lord father
[47:19] the service law bless the visible
[47:21] audience and those that are streaming
[47:24] the service tonight
[47:25] just lord let the holy spirit come with
[47:28] god and and be able to inspire us lord
[47:30] father and
[47:32] and break the bread of life break the
[47:33] word to our house tonight may we father
[47:36] be able to learn
[47:38] at your feet lord we give you the praise
[47:41] we give you the glory father bless your
[47:43] word now in jesus name we pray
[47:46] amen amen the lord bless you
[47:50] praise the lord
[47:52] amen
[48:05] hallelujah
[48:07] praise the lord
[48:11] praise the lord what a wonderful
[48:14] wonderful uh
[48:16] father wonderful savior
[48:19] that
[48:22] that we have
[48:24] we can
[48:26] be able to just come in and enjoy his
[48:28] presence
[48:30] because
[48:33] he has been good to us amen
[48:36] now so uh uh just like uh i said
[48:40] we want to
[48:42] we just want to look at that phrase that
[48:44] uh uh the apostle
[48:46] used
[48:49] that
[48:50] teaching
[48:51] is the first principle
[48:53] of the auricles of god
[48:56] is the first principle
[48:59] of the holy course of god
[49:01] and uh
[49:02] i was i was looking at that
[49:05] uh
[49:06] and then
[49:07] some other few things started
[49:10] coming over for us to to you know
[49:13] look at so
[49:15] we will we will just
[49:18] trust the lord in
[49:20] and ask that he will be able to bless us
[49:22] tonight
[49:23] praise the lord
[49:24] a couple of
[49:26] uh
[49:28] services back we talked on
[49:31] how
[49:33] using the same phrase but in a different
[49:35] way
[49:37] how
[49:40] jesus says
[49:43] those that are taught how he draw us how
[49:45] teaching is the way that god draws us to
[49:48] himself
[49:49] you know when when he brings us to that
[49:52] place
[49:53] to be able to instruct us there are some
[49:55] few things that the prophet of god said
[49:58] and
[49:59] we want to look at them tonight
[50:02] and
[50:04] also paul says some things
[50:06] that
[50:07] as i look closely in the scripture
[50:10] i started to realize that
[50:13] even myself i got the picture wrong when
[50:15] i first talked that uh
[50:18] uh
[50:21] there's there's
[50:22] thought of what he was talking about
[50:25] and if i will
[50:27] create an example here for us to look at
[50:31] let's look at uh
[50:36] first corinthians chapter eight
[50:38] let's look at first corinthians chapter
[50:40] eight
[51:14] shhh
[51:28] first corinthians chapter 8 that's what
[51:30] i said i'm i'm over in second corinthian
[51:32] i'm sorry
[51:38] looking at it in his neck
[51:41] making sense to me
[51:48] paul says in verse 7 he says
[51:51] how be there is not in every man
[51:55] that knowledge
[51:59] for so for some with conscience of the
[52:02] idols on
[52:05] onto this hour eat it as a thing offered
[52:09] unto idol
[52:10] and their conscience being weak
[52:15] is defined
[52:17] but meat
[52:19] commanded us not i mean yeah commanded
[52:22] us not to god
[52:24] for neither if we eat
[52:27] uh we better neither if we eat net
[52:31] are
[52:33] we the worst
[52:34] but take it least by any means
[52:37] this liberty
[52:40] of
[52:41] of yours become a storming block to them
[52:44] that are weak now
[52:46] is is that is is those that are weak
[52:50] and uh
[52:51] that's that's that's what struck me when
[52:53] i when i actually realized the ones that
[52:56] paul was talking about
[52:59] if any man
[53:01] for if any man see thee we should have
[53:04] knowledge said admit
[53:06] in
[53:07] the idol temple
[53:09] shall not be conscious of him which is
[53:12] weak
[53:13] be uh in in border to eat those things
[53:16] which are offered
[53:19] to idols
[53:21] now so as we've been talking about a
[53:24] little better of the early church
[53:26] which was uh
[53:28] uh
[53:30] we had a lot of
[53:31] uh
[53:32] jewish believers there that was
[53:34] struggling with leaving the lord and
[53:37] coming on to what the grace of god have
[53:39] started to do
[53:41] so uh uh
[53:43] you know
[53:46] most of the time in in in time past this
[53:48] this is the way that i taught about this
[53:50] scripture i thought that the person that
[53:54] you know was uh uh struggling with
[53:57] eating meat what whatever that paul was
[54:00] dealing with there i really thought that
[54:02] it was the one there was there was the
[54:04] week i thought that the one that had
[54:06] just been converted from uh
[54:10] from idol worship you know they have
[54:12] given their heart to the lord and now he
[54:15] received that
[54:17] you know they stay eat uh
[54:19] at those feasts and all of that
[54:22] but as as he was telling the text you
[54:25] will realize that uh
[54:27] paul was talking to those ones
[54:31] and
[54:32] and the ones that were struggling with
[54:35] that
[54:36] were the ones that were not partaking of
[54:38] it right
[54:43] praise the lord
[54:45] the ones that were that were struggling
[54:47] with faith was the ones that were not
[54:50] partaking of faith the ones that were
[54:53] partaking of it because they you know
[54:57] something that they have been doing you
[54:59] know they don't feel condemned in it and
[55:02] they think that now they are they are
[55:04] believers they can continue their way
[55:06] and here is a group of believers you
[55:10] know that have come from
[55:12] a
[55:13] jewish background that had nothing to do
[55:15] with idols or things offered unto idols
[55:19] to be in the same same assembling scene
[55:22] all of these ones now that have now
[55:24] become believers you know that are
[55:27] gentiles you know partaking of those
[55:29] things these guys just like what
[55:32] happened to peter
[55:35] when the lord told him eat he said lord
[55:37] i have never eaten anything that is
[55:39] unclean
[55:40] praise the lord
[55:41] so you see
[55:43] because he was exposed to death he
[55:46] really did not have the boldness of
[55:48] faith to say well this is a vision from
[55:51] the lord or you know the law of saying
[55:53] speaking to me so i'm going to do it
[55:56] right now so uh
[55:58] you will soon grab the concept
[56:00] that uh i'm trying to bring tonight
[56:04] as we go along i'm just trying to use
[56:07] this to start up the water and see if
[56:10] you will be able to jump in it amen
[56:12] so we realize here that uh as paul is
[56:16] instructing these believers
[56:19] the the ones that have had unto the lord
[56:24] are the ones that are
[56:26] having
[56:27] difficulty to relax
[56:30] even if they will not partake of it to
[56:33] be able to accommodate those that will
[56:36] partake of faith right
[56:38] and what our sense of
[56:40] uh uh you know uh
[56:44] hesitation we go
[56:46] in in light of tonight is where brother
[56:49] branham talks about you know how
[56:53] with brotherly kindness which of course
[56:55] is that is a stage of grace
[56:58] and and faith that we walk into
[57:01] allow us to be able to accommodate
[57:05] you know
[57:06] and overlook
[57:08] support
[57:10] the ones that are struggling the ones
[57:13] that are dealing with things
[57:15] and and brother branham would bring it
[57:17] up in a way as we will see it as we go
[57:19] along it's in a way that it shows our
[57:23] maturity
[57:24] if we can now support the weak we are
[57:27] not growing right
[57:29] sure
[57:31] if we think that we are growing and in
[57:34] our growth we condemn everything around
[57:36] us it's not a sense of growth
[57:42] it's not a sense of growth
[57:44] it's a hidden fear
[57:52] praise the lord so the week once year
[57:56] in in in corinthian chapter 8 is not the
[57:59] ones that were eating
[58:00] right
[58:04] praise the lord
[58:08] is the ones that were offended
[58:15] have you seen the picture
[58:19] praise lord
[58:24] so
[58:26] that's the reason why paul is speaking
[58:28] to
[58:29] the the hebrew believers here and saying
[58:33] teaching
[58:34] is the first principle
[58:38] in the oracle of god
[58:42] praise the lord
[58:43] if we are not properly taught
[58:46] uh uh in the way that he was speaking to
[58:49] them
[58:50] you could be you could be holding the
[58:52] lord and zealious in the lord and yet
[58:56] you could be uh
[58:57] you know uh
[59:00] uh in in some sense uh uh condemned you
[59:03] could because you will realize as we
[59:06] look in the scripture paul did not only
[59:08] address that to the hebrew believers he
[59:11] spoke the same thing to to the
[59:14] christians in rome
[59:17] that why you you are now supposed to be
[59:21] uh uh uh mature christians you you are
[59:24] stay
[59:25] you are state babes and the end
[59:27] and word
[59:29] that uh that uh
[59:31] infant nature was is that they were stay
[59:36] they were they were holding to the lord
[59:41] they were holding to the lord
[59:44] and and and one of the reason there is
[59:46] that is because that's all they know
[59:51] the word has now become a revelation to
[59:54] them
[59:55] when the word becomes a revelation to
[59:57] you it frees you
[1:00:01] absolutely
[1:00:02] it frees you
[1:00:05] praise the lord
[1:00:07] when the word is just a law to you it
[1:00:11] bounces you
[1:00:13] you stay to that place where uh uh uh i
[1:00:16] mean uh you you you
[1:00:19] you look over your shoulder and uh uh
[1:00:22] you are afraid that uh you know uh you
[1:00:25] could do wrong and and you know and and
[1:00:28] you want to walk right in and all of
[1:00:31] that which of course is beautiful that
[1:00:34] that is the infant state
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:39] just like uh you know i i i said before
[1:00:42] you know when when when the baby is is
[1:00:45] uh it's about to walk it's you know you
[1:00:48] you get
[1:00:49] we are all excited
[1:00:52] as he stands up
[1:00:54] but you see the consciousness that the
[1:00:56] the the father hand the parent hand is
[1:00:59] very close because we know he's not
[1:01:01] stable
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] so all eyes are on him
[1:01:10] okay calm down come you know everybody
[1:01:13] watching and he's taking his
[1:01:15] come come you know it's almost like
[1:01:17] you're going back but you're going in
[1:01:19] front because you know that any moment
[1:01:21] he will lose balance
[1:01:25] are we together
[1:01:27] praise the lord
[1:01:30] teaching is the first
[1:01:34] oracle of god let me start here tonight
[1:01:37] brother branham talks something about
[1:01:39] his pastor
[1:01:41] roy davis
[1:01:42] and it was it was it was amazing to me
[1:01:44] and i was
[1:01:47] listening to
[1:01:49] to brother always owens juggers in uh a
[1:01:54] book that he wrote
[1:01:56] you know on brother branham live story
[1:01:58] and then i realized that
[1:02:00] you know brother branham talks about a
[1:02:02] preacher
[1:02:03] you know a young preacher
[1:02:05] that
[1:02:06] uh one time on an infidel ca you know uh
[1:02:09] uh unbelieving men challenge and says uh
[1:02:13] you know he brought uh uh uh something
[1:02:16] that was uh you know uh
[1:02:19] that could kill you know and he says you
[1:02:21] know jesus said you would drink the
[1:02:23] other things and you will not die
[1:02:27] you know and he says all you christians
[1:02:29] here and this was at a revival yeah
[1:02:32] he says all you christians here i
[1:02:34] challenge you
[1:02:36] if you believe what jesus says come and
[1:02:38] take this and drink it
[1:02:42] praise the lord
[1:02:44] and at that time
[1:02:47] rord davis there was a baptist boy the
[1:02:50] baptist minister he was a young baptist
[1:02:52] preacher
[1:02:53] and at the convention he was sitting in
[1:02:56] a meeting
[1:02:58] he was sitting in a meeting and uh and
[1:03:02] he was so challenged in his heart
[1:03:05] you know that that the infidel is making
[1:03:07] that challenge
[1:03:09] and and and everybody is just sitting
[1:03:11] down and looking at him
[1:03:13] you know
[1:03:14] and then and then roy davis
[1:03:17] uh being a young preacher
[1:03:19] uh because
[1:03:20] uh uh uh this this is one of the things
[1:03:23] that will that will you know that would
[1:03:25] bring uh
[1:03:27] uh uh
[1:03:28] it would challenge brother branham's
[1:03:30] faith
[1:03:31] you know so rod davis he he woke up from
[1:03:34] his seat
[1:03:35] and he says he went right there to the
[1:03:37] feeder and took uh
[1:03:38] uh well i think it was an assay or
[1:03:40] something like that you know and took it
[1:03:43] from his hands and he's and he says he's
[1:03:45] his church
[1:03:46] i will now stand here for this man you
[1:03:49] know to uh uh uh you know uh uh
[1:03:53] challenge uh you know us on the word of
[1:03:56] god
[1:03:57] if i died i know i'm going to my savior
[1:04:00] you know but i believe what jesus said
[1:04:04] that we would drink person and nothing
[1:04:06] will happen and he took that little
[1:04:08] bottle and he just drank it
[1:04:11] and the lord blessed his little faith
[1:04:13] and nothing happened to him
[1:04:16] you know and and and brother branham
[1:04:18] said at the time he he was just a young
[1:04:21] young christian he he said
[1:04:23] and he was just reading his bible he's
[1:04:25] he read it you know in in the scripture
[1:04:28] he said but when rob davis did that he
[1:04:30] says well he saw that in the church you
[1:04:32] know he heard uh rod david's testifying
[1:04:35] about that he said he sat down there he
[1:04:37] says well that was a good fit but i
[1:04:39] don't think you were wise
[1:04:41] why if you die
[1:04:43] you know that's that's uh that's a young
[1:04:45] you know uh young william branham saying
[1:04:47] that in his mind
[1:04:49] but what happened is that
[1:04:52] that also will influence brother branham
[1:04:57] you know it will influence brother
[1:04:58] branham on on on taking stand on god's
[1:05:02] word but in the way that it will
[1:05:04] influence him not just in his young baby
[1:05:09] stage you know it was influencing as he
[1:05:11] grows on i see as he understand the word
[1:05:14] of god you know and comes to maturity
[1:05:16] now brother brahm said something here in
[1:05:18] god keep his word it was actually a
[1:05:21] blessing to me when i when i listened to
[1:05:23] that because uh
[1:05:25] uh i've heard i've heard that testimony
[1:05:27] brother brown said it many times but i
[1:05:30] did not really put the picture together
[1:05:32] that it was it was roy davies that did
[1:05:34] that
[1:05:35] brother branham said yeah he said
[1:05:38] when i was first converted
[1:05:41] and
[1:05:42] was ordained in the baptist church i had
[1:05:45] a good old teacher
[1:05:49] the name
[1:05:51] of dr roy davis
[1:05:55] praise the lord
[1:05:56] amen so before brother branham will come
[1:05:59] to his ministry
[1:06:03] to be taught by the angel of the lord
[1:06:06] he had a good old teacher
[1:06:10] sure which was his pastor
[1:06:16] praise the lord so brother branham
[1:06:19] we will talk here he says
[1:06:22] he was a lawyer
[1:06:24] before his conversion and he took
[1:06:26] everything
[1:06:27] from a legal legal standpoint in the
[1:06:30] bible praise the lord
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] now and then brother brown will talk
[1:06:36] about
[1:06:37] the the first time that he preached he
[1:06:39] says i remember my first semen
[1:06:43] i remember
[1:06:44] my first seminar i preach i preach on
[1:06:46] something
[1:06:48] praise the lord
[1:06:49] and and as you read the story down you
[1:06:52] know he he he talks about something and
[1:06:55] you know and and you know he's he's
[1:06:58] demonstrating all of these things and
[1:07:00] and how something compromises gifting
[1:07:03] you know when uh uh you know and he
[1:07:06] cried when he went on
[1:07:08] and i went over and had
[1:07:10] my hand
[1:07:12] tied to the pulse you know he says he's
[1:07:14] dramatizing this and all i went through
[1:07:17] every emotion that that i guess that i
[1:07:22] thought the preacher could go through
[1:07:26] and when and and when i noticed all
[1:07:29] david sitting there
[1:07:31] with his finger up to his mouth maybe
[1:07:33] probably sitting like this
[1:07:38] look looking at his uh his young
[1:07:40] preacher preaching and just sitting like
[1:07:42] this
[1:07:43] what is he doing
[1:07:45] you know
[1:07:48] he says
[1:07:54] and after the service was over
[1:07:57] i had made my altar call
[1:08:01] a lot of the old mothers woke up petting
[1:08:04] me on the shoulder oh they said billy
[1:08:07] that was
[1:08:08] wonderful and dr david said i want to
[1:08:11] see you in my study
[1:08:18] i said yes sir he said
[1:08:20] that was just about as ridiculous
[1:08:25] as i've ever heard in my life
[1:08:28] and then see see this uh this uh this
[1:08:30] young preacher preaching and and
[1:08:32] something and he compromised and they
[1:08:34] tie him you know then he's dramatizing
[1:08:37] all of that
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:50] oh it really took the sale off of me
[1:08:54] since when when when his pastor told him
[1:08:56] that he took the seal off of him
[1:09:01] well what's the matter
[1:09:03] dr david he said one time when i was
[1:09:06] practicing law now so he's he's bringing
[1:09:10] brother branham to the place
[1:09:12] not to feed on the emotion of the people
[1:09:18] okay
[1:09:19] now brother branham will learn from that
[1:09:22] and then he will he will he will bring
[1:09:24] us to the place and says uh you know uh
[1:09:27] that jesus did not die that somebody
[1:09:30] would feel sorry and gave their life to
[1:09:32] god you know he said that
[1:09:34] praise the lord
[1:09:35] you know so he's he's telling brother
[1:09:37] branham you know comparing it with lord
[1:09:40] and and you know you you you get in the
[1:09:42] court and uh uh you are the lawyer to
[1:09:46] defend the the you know the the guilty
[1:09:48] person
[1:09:49] you can you cannot tell the jury or you
[1:09:52] tell the court oh
[1:09:54] look at this little boy he's just an
[1:09:56] innocent boy
[1:09:58] can you see his face
[1:10:01] how innocent he is
[1:10:03] oh feel sorry for him
[1:10:06] his if he goes to prison his mother is
[1:10:08] going to cry
[1:10:10] you know
[1:10:12] that's that's what he's bringing brother
[1:10:13] bran and that you you cannot you can you
[1:10:16] you have to make your case
[1:10:19] you are there to defend
[1:10:22] that person you are not there to play on
[1:10:25] the emotion of the people
[1:10:28] and make them feel sorry
[1:10:30] you know so that's what he was watching
[1:10:33] now you see so brother bran i'm learning
[1:10:36] from there that's what he's pointing
[1:10:38] back to to say i had a good old teacher
[1:10:43] because he taught me
[1:10:46] yes
[1:10:50] because if ned he will have enough to be
[1:10:53] in this this preacher that will be
[1:10:55] preaching and says you know your mother
[1:10:57] was a good member of this church why
[1:10:59] can't you give your life to god son
[1:11:04] we dedicated you are this puppet
[1:11:08] and all you are doing you are just plain
[1:11:10] on the emotion of the person
[1:11:13] you are not bringing him to a place of
[1:11:15] conviction
[1:11:19] praise the lord
[1:11:22] so he says i had a good old teacher
[1:11:29] someone i can that that could correct
[1:11:31] him and says i mean i mean you you you
[1:11:33] don't preach like that what is that
[1:11:36] is that i say a drama we are here for
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:42] so are you are you grabbing the
[1:11:43] principle that i'm trying to bring to
[1:11:45] you because that is the first principle
[1:11:49] of the oracle of god teaching
[1:11:52] right sure
[1:11:54] praise the lord
[1:11:56] and even in our natural life as as we
[1:12:00] grew up
[1:12:01] from uh uh us as babies that's that's
[1:12:05] the first thing
[1:12:06] we're taught to say mama
[1:12:08] little baby said mama
[1:12:12] that's that's the first thing
[1:12:18] we are exposed to
[1:12:20] teaching
[1:12:21] praise the lord
[1:12:22] so brother branham goes through out of
[1:12:24] there this is a kind of a long
[1:12:26] conversation you might take the whole
[1:12:27] night so
[1:12:29] i just i just kind of for share that
[1:12:31] with you
[1:12:33] praise the lord
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:42] i'll drop down a little bit he says i
[1:12:44] think that was that that was a very good
[1:12:46] thing i said dr davis i thank you he
[1:12:50] said billy
[1:12:52] all of your emotion and going on and and
[1:12:56] and uh
[1:12:58] tying something to the pulse and and
[1:13:01] whipping him and putting his eyes out
[1:13:04] you don't get very much scripture
[1:13:08] men are not saved by emotion
[1:13:13] and all the little side
[1:13:16] stories you tell
[1:13:19] men saved by the word of god
[1:13:26] that's right
[1:13:27] if you don't give your life to jesus you
[1:13:28] will die you'll burn in hell you will
[1:13:30] just be burning
[1:13:39] praise the lord
[1:13:41] by you grabbing the picture
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:44] so he's uh he's he's he's he's teaching
[1:13:48] brother branham
[1:13:49] to you know to stay with the word of god
[1:13:55] they'll bail you off your your message
[1:13:58] you know
[1:14:00] on the word of god
[1:14:02] and then and then moreover it again it
[1:14:05] brings us to the place you know just
[1:14:07] like i said on sunday
[1:14:10] you know
[1:14:11] we have a message
[1:14:15] praise the lord
[1:14:17] it's a message
[1:14:19] of the hour this is is what god has
[1:14:21] given to us the revealed word
[1:14:26] and the prophet of god says you know
[1:14:28] well you cannot take one verse in the
[1:14:31] bible
[1:14:34] and make a doctrine
[1:14:35] you got to run it through the scripture
[1:14:41] are we together yes right
[1:14:48] so if you bring that in comparison with
[1:14:51] the picture we look at in the book of
[1:14:53] corinthian you realize that uh those
[1:14:57] those early jewish believers that god
[1:14:59] stuck in in the in in the lord in you
[1:15:03] know in
[1:15:04] in
[1:15:05] what whatever was given to them that for
[1:15:08] them to be able to embrace
[1:15:12] yes
[1:15:13] these are the new believers that were
[1:15:16] coming uh you know people that were
[1:15:17] converted in korean from the worship of
[1:15:20] dinan and all of that to to be able to
[1:15:23] give them grace
[1:15:26] as long as they have not rise to their
[1:15:29] level
[1:15:31] no they were not saved yet
[1:15:36] praise the lord
[1:15:38] but the picture that i want you to see
[1:15:41] is there there
[1:15:42] in doing that
[1:15:44] those ones that were just saved were not
[1:15:46] the weaker ones
[1:15:54] are we together
[1:15:58] as we go along the picture we get
[1:16:00] clearer to you
[1:16:03] brother graham says something yet also
[1:16:05] in a message uh
[1:16:09] way to have fellowship
[1:16:16] he says this
[1:16:18] their word it is tonight
[1:16:20] god has to give it
[1:16:25] then love produce a fellowship
[1:16:30] now when god said back there that they
[1:16:34] their sin has separated that divine love
[1:16:38] god told adam and eve not to eat these
[1:16:42] setting fruits and they did and sin
[1:16:45] brought separation
[1:16:47] and and sin by separation brought hatred
[1:16:51] miley strife envy is that right
[1:16:54] what happened
[1:16:56] they separated from
[1:16:58] divine love
[1:17:00] and when you separate from divine love
[1:17:04] then
[1:17:05] you can overlook
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:09] your brother's mistake no more
[1:17:17] praise the lord
[1:17:19] now in in in in another sense
[1:17:22] if you look at it in another sense in in
[1:17:26] uh in the sense of sticking with the
[1:17:29] lord us in the sense of uh in you know
[1:17:32] in our term we would say is uh the the
[1:17:35] legalist
[1:17:38] praise the lord right
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:41] the legalists will look at it in in a
[1:17:44] way word he would think that is the is
[1:17:48] is is divine love you got to wreck that
[1:17:50] person down i mean you got to tell them
[1:17:52] the word of god whether they like it or
[1:17:54] not that's that's the love of god
[1:18:01] are we together
[1:18:07] but see the picture that brother branham
[1:18:09] is going to to
[1:18:10] to to present to us here now
[1:18:13] he says that
[1:18:16] they separate from divine love
[1:18:18] and when you separate from divine love
[1:18:23] then you can't
[1:18:24] overlook your brother's mistake no more
[1:18:29] you've got to bore him out
[1:18:32] amen you got to blast the guide
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:43] that's right
[1:18:44] they can overlook
[1:18:46] sister's mistake no more
[1:18:49] because
[1:18:50] you have got away from that divine path
[1:18:55] you are holding to the word
[1:18:57] but you have got away from that divine
[1:19:00] part
[1:19:04] praise the lord
[1:19:06] when a person
[1:19:08] do you wrong
[1:19:10] as a mortar as a falling
[1:19:13] motor bonus in ship shipley in iniquity
[1:19:17] it is the right thing
[1:19:19] for you to force back at the person
[1:19:22] that's what the fallen nature will do
[1:19:26] for you to forgive
[1:19:29] it's not natural
[1:19:30] right
[1:19:35] praise the lord
[1:19:36] you say brother one what are you
[1:19:37] preaching tonight
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:42] i told someone that last night
[1:19:44] and uh and i said it and then
[1:19:47] it's it's just it's just quick into
[1:19:49] meanness oh my god
[1:19:51] uh i've never said this like this before
[1:19:53] and i've never seen it like this
[1:19:59] praise the lord
[1:20:01] so brother branham says you you you you
[1:20:03] have got away from that divine path
[1:20:07] that love fact but if you really love
[1:20:11] the lord jesus
[1:20:13] if a sister or the brother does
[1:20:15] something to you all well that's all
[1:20:18] right
[1:20:20] they didn't mean to do it
[1:20:22] praise the lord
[1:20:24] that's the kind of love that christ had
[1:20:27] father forgave them
[1:20:29] they didn't know what they were doing
[1:20:32] right
[1:20:33] praise the lord
[1:20:35] now you think about it now even though
[1:20:38] we we are looking at
[1:20:40] the fullness of god dwelling in this
[1:20:41] body but we have to realize that
[1:20:44] that that was the expression of the love
[1:20:47] of god
[1:20:48] christ was the expression of the love of
[1:20:51] god
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:57] because on
[1:20:59] on on on the on the human level you know
[1:21:02] uh since i've been having ten thousand
[1:21:05] legions of angels i can call right now
[1:21:08] to just close this whole thing
[1:21:10] right
[1:21:12] yeah
[1:21:18] i hope you're getting the picture i'm
[1:21:19] trying to pin out tonight
[1:21:21] praise the lord
[1:21:28] you have to you have to see that we are
[1:21:30] drawing from
[1:21:31] from the from the top of where paul was
[1:21:35] saying
[1:21:36] you
[1:21:37] you needed to be teachers
[1:21:40] but it looks like
[1:21:42] you are you you are i mean you are you
[1:21:45] are stay babes because on the on the on
[1:21:48] the principal thing the elementary thing
[1:21:50] you have not grown up yet so that's that
[1:21:53] is the sense that we're trying to to
[1:21:55] project tonight
[1:22:01] but bam says and what if
[1:22:04] what if he had had my sin against me
[1:22:07] what an awful person i was
[1:22:10] but he loved me so well that he forgave
[1:22:13] me for them
[1:22:16] when i was on them he forgive me
[1:22:19] he loved me a pure
[1:22:21] love
[1:22:26] praise the lord
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:30] now so uh
[1:22:32] i think you grab the sense of of what
[1:22:34] i'm talking about it's not in a place
[1:22:37] when a person does wrong you don't you
[1:22:39] don't tell them that what you did is
[1:22:40] wrong that's not what i'm saying sure
[1:22:45] but it's also in a place where the love
[1:22:48] of god in you will make accommodation
[1:22:51] for the person
[1:22:56] praise the lord
[1:22:58] you'll be able to bear with him
[1:23:08] let's take another thought here also
[1:23:11] divine healing he says everything that
[1:23:13] god promised is there
[1:23:16] is yours
[1:23:18] just ask for it
[1:23:21] anything that he died for belongs to you
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:28] there it is it's the whole thing
[1:23:30] and and and how we love it
[1:23:33] is in
[1:23:34] it full to the soul yes it is amen
[1:23:38] that's the word of god and every time we
[1:23:41] believe now listen listen to me
[1:23:44] carefully now every time we believe
[1:23:46] believe what the word of god
[1:23:50] amen every time we receive the word of
[1:23:53] god
[1:23:55] every time we say lord be it unto me
[1:23:58] that calling to your word
[1:23:59] every time the word is preached we say
[1:24:02] amen we are we are claiming it as as
[1:24:05] ours our a man is not a chicked a man
[1:24:09] where you are thinking about somebody
[1:24:11] and says and preach it because you think
[1:24:14] it's somebody it belongs to
[1:24:19] you are saying amen because you are
[1:24:21] receiving the word
[1:24:23] praise the lord
[1:24:25] amen because the word is either a
[1:24:27] correction to you
[1:24:29] or is an instruction
[1:24:32] instructing you that these things might
[1:24:35] come up wash out and this is what you
[1:24:37] should do
[1:24:38] so you say amen thank you lord jesus
[1:24:43] praise the lord
[1:24:44] so he says every time we believe
[1:24:47] that little speck in there
[1:24:50] just get bigger
[1:24:57] every time you receive the correction of
[1:24:59] the word
[1:25:02] that little speck indeed just get bigger
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:09] it gets bigger
[1:25:13] it swears out
[1:25:15] till after a while
[1:25:18] it just become
[1:25:20] you believe
[1:25:21] all things
[1:25:23] you get to the place where you don't
[1:25:26] struggle with the word of god
[1:25:34] praise the lord
[1:25:44] and as
[1:25:45] all things begin to coming
[1:25:48] love begins
[1:25:50] it comes in
[1:25:52] doubt hatred malice feared just flat out
[1:25:57] you see that you see the principle that
[1:26:00] john
[1:26:01] uh lays there in the book of john when
[1:26:04] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:26:06] light the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:26:10] us from all unrighteousness
[1:26:14] so brother branham says as we receive
[1:26:16] the word
[1:26:19] as we say amen to the word
[1:26:23] it begins to swir swirl in us it begins
[1:26:26] to get bigger and then feared and doubt
[1:26:30] and knowledge
[1:26:32] gossip
[1:26:35] it pushes it out
[1:26:38] are we together
[1:26:40] so is is is uh
[1:26:43] is the growth that we're beginning to
[1:26:44] see in that way
[1:26:46] it's maturity that we are coming to
[1:26:51] because now
[1:26:52] you realize that is the word that is
[1:26:55] giving you strength the word is the
[1:26:57] overcoming power
[1:26:59] amen you are not relying on your
[1:27:02] self-righteousness
[1:27:05] because if you are holding to
[1:27:07] self-righteousness it gave you the sense
[1:27:09] to think that i have achieved it so you
[1:27:12] can you must do the same thing
[1:27:18] are we together
[1:27:23] see where i am i have claimed on the
[1:27:25] ladder you have to come up to
[1:27:32] no but if you grow it in this way you
[1:27:34] say see where i am well take my hand let
[1:27:36] me bring you up
[1:27:38] now that you should come up
[1:27:46] are we together
[1:27:50] so down hatred molly's fear
[1:27:53] just flies out
[1:27:55] like that
[1:27:58] it just spray out
[1:28:00] just gets so bigger it's the word i keep
[1:28:04] tell it just burst a little
[1:28:07] all share out
[1:28:10] see what i mean all the word is part
[1:28:14] we grow daily
[1:28:16] in the grace of god
[1:28:20] praise the lord
[1:28:24] he said now you notice those people
[1:28:29] they can sit and say well i accept the
[1:28:31] lord
[1:28:34] you take their word for it i would too
[1:28:38] i can't judge god does
[1:28:40] but in 10 years from now
[1:28:44] they have never progressed a bit
[1:28:49] just staying right in the same old place
[1:28:53] no sense of growth
[1:28:57] no sense of growth
[1:29:00] you can tell from their conversation
[1:29:02] they are negative
[1:29:05] always tearing other people down
[1:29:11] praise the lord no sense of growth
[1:29:18] are we together yes sir
[1:29:22] so they have been 10 years there they
[1:29:25] have been hearing the word
[1:29:27] what has been lacking
[1:29:29] teaching
[1:29:34] teaching for them to be able to
[1:29:38] position themselves
[1:29:46] all their growth is how much they are
[1:29:48] attached to the local church
[1:29:55] our growth is now how long we have
[1:29:57] belonged to this church
[1:29:59] or how long we have been in the message
[1:30:01] our growth is in the word
[1:30:06] yes sir
[1:30:08] we must be growing in understanding
[1:30:16] he says we grow daily each day our
[1:30:19] hearts hunger
[1:30:22] keep moving on
[1:30:24] there is something
[1:30:26] growing inside of you
[1:30:33] praise the lord
[1:30:34] there is something growing inside
[1:30:38] of you amen
[1:30:40] it gets bigger it's prayer out
[1:30:44] paul said he told the corinthian church
[1:30:46] said
[1:30:47] you are mentoring you are growing but
[1:30:50] when you are to be teachers you are step
[1:30:52] babies needing teaching
[1:30:55] is that right
[1:30:57] when you are to be teacher sometimes
[1:31:00] he says something in there growing out
[1:31:02] putting out uh uh
[1:31:05] making bigger the holy spirit growing
[1:31:09] right
[1:31:11] you are growing
[1:31:13] in the statue of christ
[1:31:17] praise the lord
[1:31:20] the new birth
[1:31:22] if
[1:31:23] if a birth is born from the outside or
[1:31:26] from the inside out
[1:31:29] the child it grows if a life
[1:31:33] if it doesn't it remains
[1:31:35] is that right well
[1:31:37] when a birth
[1:31:38] is on the inside
[1:31:41] shouldn't it grow
[1:31:42] the christ in your heart ought to be
[1:31:45] growing daily
[1:31:52] praise the lord
[1:31:54] and that's to think
[1:31:58] that fights the enemy
[1:32:04] praise the lord
[1:32:05] that's the thing that fights the enemy
[1:32:08] that's the inner strength
[1:32:12] praise the lord
[1:32:16] the christ in your heart ought to be
[1:32:18] growing dearly getting bigger more
[1:32:20] powerful understanding things better
[1:32:25] forgiving
[1:32:27] walking on as god who till christ be
[1:32:30] form in you
[1:32:31] the hope of glory
[1:32:36] praise the lord
[1:32:47] we must contend with the weak until they
[1:32:50] are fully mature in christ jesus
[1:32:53] then
[1:32:54] they are good soldiers
[1:32:56] then they have got
[1:32:58] on the fore armor talk about them and
[1:33:01] you see there and and just and just like
[1:33:04] uh you know i've said before uh uh
[1:33:09] you know those those things happen
[1:33:11] especially in in family life you know uh
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] we we uh
[1:33:19] sometimes put a lot of
[1:33:21] expectations a lot of
[1:33:24] burden even on the little kids
[1:33:26] that we don't see the area of their
[1:33:29] growth
[1:33:31] because we have created this picture in
[1:33:33] our mind that this is the way a
[1:33:35] christian supposed to be
[1:33:40] and as long as they are not measuring up
[1:33:42] to death we don't see the area of their
[1:33:45] growth
[1:33:47] right
[1:33:49] praise the lord
[1:33:50] sometimes uh uh husband do it to wife
[1:33:53] sometimes wife do it to a husband you
[1:33:55] know sometimes our brothers do it to
[1:33:57] sisters we have created this picture
[1:34:00] this is the bride of jesus christ
[1:34:06] praise the lord
[1:34:09] but before
[1:34:11] that lady became a bride
[1:34:13] she was first born a little girl
[1:34:16] right
[1:34:18] praise the lord
[1:34:19] it was not our birth that she became a
[1:34:22] bride this is not a muslim religion
[1:34:23] where we give babies to marriage
[1:34:27] we allow them to grow
[1:34:32] praise the lord
[1:34:34] we allow them to grow
[1:34:48] you know so all of those things are
[1:34:50] there
[1:34:55] let's look a few scriptures tonight
[1:34:59] and then
[1:35:08] okay
[1:35:11] praise the lord
[1:35:18] let's look in romans chapter 2.
[1:35:31] you get the picture from here from verse
[1:35:33] 17 behold thou thou i call a jewel
[1:35:38] and rested in the lord
[1:35:41] and make it that boss in god
[1:35:44] now as as we go with this thought paul
[1:35:47] we comes right back to the same thing so
[1:35:49] he says you know uh these
[1:35:52] believers
[1:35:54] there you know well uh they are in room
[1:35:57] they they
[1:35:58] they are they are jews they are resting
[1:36:00] in the law they are making their boss in
[1:36:02] the lord and know with
[1:36:04] his will
[1:36:05] and approve of the things that are more
[1:36:08] excellent being instructed out of the
[1:36:10] lord
[1:36:14] and are confident that they are thy self
[1:36:17] are the guide of the blind
[1:36:22] a light of them that are in darkness
[1:36:25] but what were they using
[1:36:27] just the law they never have
[1:36:30] the reveal word for their for their day
[1:36:35] amen the reveal word of the day was what
[1:36:38] the holy ghost was doing
[1:36:43] it was the message of paul the the
[1:36:46] messenger of that age
[1:36:50] they did not have the revealed word for
[1:36:51] their day
[1:36:54] so what were they doing they were
[1:36:55] sticking to self-righteousness they were
[1:36:58] making up their own righteousness by
[1:37:00] holding to the lord
[1:37:05] praise the lord
[1:37:06] so paul goes on a little bit yet and
[1:37:09] says an instructor of the foolish a
[1:37:12] teacher of babe which
[1:37:14] we should have a form of knowledge
[1:37:18] and of the truth in the lord
[1:37:21] because the law was just a shadow of
[1:37:23] good things to come so they had a form
[1:37:25] of knowledge
[1:37:27] of the truth
[1:37:29] now therefore which teaches another
[1:37:34] teachers not that self
[1:37:37] doubt they are preached preached and man
[1:37:39] should not steal
[1:37:41] does that steal
[1:37:44] praise the lord
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:47] let me let me in uh uh
[1:37:50] let me read this a little bit from uh
[1:37:53] from the amplifier so you you can you
[1:37:55] can be able to appreciate
[1:38:02] verse 20 you are
[1:38:04] a corrector of the foolish a teacher
[1:38:07] of the childish
[1:38:09] having a law
[1:38:11] having in the law the embodiment of
[1:38:14] knowledge and truth well then you will
[1:38:17] teach others
[1:38:19] do not
[1:38:22] teach yourself
[1:38:24] why you teach against stealing do you
[1:38:27] steal
[1:38:28] take what does net really belongs to you
[1:38:35] praise the lord
[1:38:40] so you see you see where paul is is uh
[1:38:43] uh uh is kind of for bringing them to
[1:38:46] realize
[1:38:49] you know you you are holding to the lord
[1:38:51] but what actually is happening is that
[1:38:54] you are dealing with lot of guilt in you
[1:39:02] with all your self-righteousness you are
[1:39:04] now over your guilt
[1:39:07] right
[1:39:11] are we together
[1:39:16] he says here
[1:39:17] you who say do not commit adultery do
[1:39:20] you commit adultery
[1:39:23] are you unchaste in action
[1:39:26] and in thoughts
[1:39:30] now see here now let's let's take this
[1:39:32] this this uh
[1:39:34] uh amplifier verse and bring it to
[1:39:36] matthew chapter five
[1:39:38] jesus said
[1:39:40] it is written thou shalt not commit
[1:39:42] adultery
[1:39:44] but i said unto you
[1:39:46] that whosoever locket upon the woman
[1:39:51] so the law here paul is saying
[1:39:54] you you are saying that i do not commit
[1:39:57] adultery
[1:39:58] he says but what's happening in your
[1:40:00] mind
[1:40:05] what what's happening in your mind
[1:40:09] praise the lord
[1:40:22] are you on chasing action any types
[1:40:25] you who are hub and uh and i love others
[1:40:28] do you
[1:40:30] rob temple
[1:40:32] do you appropriate to your own use
[1:40:36] what is consecrated to god
[1:40:39] thus robbing
[1:40:40] the temple
[1:40:43] and doing
[1:40:44] sacrilege
[1:40:47] you must in the lord
[1:40:49] do you honor god by breaking the lord
[1:40:56] now so he's he's he's dealing also so so
[1:41:00] what just like what he expressed over in
[1:41:03] romans chapter 9 his zeal was after his
[1:41:06] brethren
[1:41:08] because he realized that they were they
[1:41:10] were they were zealous after the lord of
[1:41:13] god but the knowledge of god was not
[1:41:15] there
[1:41:17] right
[1:41:18] why because
[1:41:20] the revelation of the word
[1:41:26] see in christ
[1:41:28] from the old testament to the new they
[1:41:31] could not see it
[1:41:36] praise the lord
[1:41:39] you know and and and that's and that's
[1:41:41] the thing
[1:41:42] that
[1:41:43] that that happens in the world that we
[1:41:46] that we live in today
[1:41:49] praise the lord you have a you have a
[1:41:51] lot of these uh wonderful works that are
[1:41:54] done you know uh uh uh
[1:41:56] um
[1:41:58] in in the muslim world and you know
[1:42:01] and
[1:42:02] and none of those people now you realize
[1:42:05] that uh with some of the laws the the
[1:42:08] sharia law and all of that the people
[1:42:11] feel
[1:42:12] the suppression
[1:42:16] of that religion on them
[1:42:18] praise the lord so it's almost like if i
[1:42:22] confess the lord jesus christ as my lord
[1:42:25] and savior i'm free from that
[1:42:27] suppression
[1:42:29] but yet it does not mean that you have
[1:42:30] the revelation
[1:42:33] of the word no
[1:42:39] praise the lord
[1:42:43] you just only want to get away from that
[1:42:45] suppression well you cannot condemn him
[1:42:47] with the muslim law because i'm not a
[1:42:48] muslim i'm a christian
[1:42:55] but the understanding of of what christ
[1:42:58] have brought the the the the the the
[1:43:01] love of labor take that that set us free
[1:43:05] is not there
[1:43:13] praise the lord
[1:43:18] so you see that's the reason why
[1:43:22] god gave us
[1:43:24] all of these things he gave us
[1:43:27] a fightful ministry
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] he put the gifts in the body
[1:43:35] praise the
[1:43:36] lord just like how a parent will buy a
[1:43:40] gift for a child
[1:43:42] even though it looks like a toy but in
[1:43:46] the same way is to be able to teach the
[1:43:48] child to know the alphabet
[1:43:52] even though the the child is going to
[1:43:54] play and and be touching the you know
[1:43:57] the the child touch uh d and it sounds
[1:44:01] like a dog
[1:44:03] the dog back
[1:44:04] right even though it's a toy
[1:44:09] but it's designed to teach
[1:44:16] because that is the first principle of
[1:44:19] life that brings that that shows our
[1:44:21] growth yes
[1:44:25] that's why when the child is at a
[1:44:26] setting age and they are not able to
[1:44:29] identify certain things it worries the
[1:44:31] pairing
[1:44:32] right
[1:44:35] even though they are growing in stature
[1:44:38] but their level of understanding
[1:44:41] now starts to be questionable
[1:44:44] right
[1:44:46] yes
[1:44:48] praise the lord
[1:44:50] so the same thing i mean uh in in in the
[1:44:53] local assembly is not is not to get a
[1:44:56] church for on sunday
[1:44:59] but we have to be growing in the world
[1:45:02] yes
[1:45:04] praise the lord
[1:45:06] we have to be growing in the
[1:45:08] understanding of what we are doing as a
[1:45:11] local assembly
[1:45:12] right
[1:45:17] what we are doing in this body as a
[1:45:19] local assembly
[1:45:26] praise the lord
[1:45:32] it's almost like uh uh uh trying to okay
[1:45:35] let me take another example tonight
[1:45:38] i'll leave you in a few minutes
[1:45:43] head shoulder knees and toes
[1:45:46] all the children lock it hair shoulder
[1:45:48] knees centers knees and toes hair
[1:45:50] shoulder knee centers
[1:45:52] what is that is for you to identify your
[1:45:55] body parts
[1:45:58] even though they love the music but it's
[1:46:00] designed for them to identify
[1:46:03] their body parts
[1:46:13] praise the lord
[1:46:15] and when the child sings that over and
[1:46:17] over
[1:46:18] something sticks in their mind that this
[1:46:20] is head
[1:46:22] so the parents where's your head
[1:46:25] head
[1:46:26] head shoulders knees and toes
[1:46:29] and shoulders knees and toes a place in
[1:46:31] their mind
[1:46:36] but the purpose is to teach
[1:46:39] yes
[1:46:45] praise the lord
[1:46:47] the purpose is to teach
[1:46:52] and pretty soon it sticks in the in the
[1:46:55] mind of the child that this is head and
[1:46:57] this is shoulder and this is knees and
[1:47:00] toes and you know and then and they
[1:47:02] learn about
[1:47:04] praise the lord
[1:47:06] you see that's the same way
[1:47:08] we have
[1:47:09] a responsibility
[1:47:12] to know
[1:47:14] our body parts
[1:47:16] in this liquid assembly
[1:47:18] this is a body
[1:47:22] this is a body
[1:47:29] let us not just desire to grow as a
[1:47:32] church where we don't have places for
[1:47:35] people to see them and then we think
[1:47:36] that is growth if we are not growing in
[1:47:39] understanding
[1:47:40] what we are doing as a local assembly
[1:47:45] praise the lord
[1:47:48] and you have little you know uh uh uh
[1:47:51] fusses here and little things that you
[1:47:54] know that is dragging in people's mind
[1:47:56] and uh that that's that's not a church
[1:47:59] that's a time bomb
[1:48:01] right when you're ready to explode
[1:48:06] then you wonder where all the worship
[1:48:08] gone
[1:48:08] where all the messages that was preached
[1:48:11] where did they go
[1:48:12] why because the people were not growing
[1:48:15] right
[1:48:16] they would just enjoying coming together
[1:48:19] i love to come together
[1:48:21] to see their their best friend i want
[1:48:24] let's sit down together let's sit down
[1:48:25] together
[1:48:28] when you go reserve my seat for me
[1:48:32] just just to enjoy that that communion
[1:48:34] together
[1:48:35] or that friend it's a good time for us
[1:48:37] to visit together that's not growth
[1:48:48] that's not growth
[1:48:52] praise the lord and it is the same thing
[1:48:54] that is happening to the society today
[1:48:58] as i was telling this i was thinking
[1:48:59] about it yeah there is five full
[1:49:01] ministry
[1:49:03] in the in in in in the in the in the
[1:49:05] church that is given to the church
[1:49:08] and one of those ministry is the teacher
[1:49:11] a man that that is blessed with the gift
[1:49:13] to teach
[1:49:15] he knows how to place the word he knows
[1:49:17] how to spread the word out he knows how
[1:49:19] to bring us and pick up things you know
[1:49:22] in the scripture pick up things in the
[1:49:24] message
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:26] but you see yet
[1:49:29] he can be the you know wonderful we have
[1:49:31] wonderful gifted brothers that do that
[1:49:37] but in another sense
[1:49:40] the teaching of the local church
[1:49:44] rely on the pastor
[1:49:47] that's his responsibility
[1:49:51] the society has has fallen short of that
[1:49:54] because
[1:49:55] we think that
[1:49:57] the schools that we send our children to
[1:50:00] is responsible to teach them
[1:50:04] right
[1:50:06] praise the lord
[1:50:11] and we as parents we don't we don't we
[1:50:13] we don't get involved with what they are
[1:50:16] learning
[1:50:19] praise the lord right
[1:50:23] it's the home responsibility
[1:50:28] when paul when when when solomon said
[1:50:30] train up a child
[1:50:33] it has the same context of
[1:50:36] teaching
[1:50:37] yes
[1:50:41] praise the lord
[1:50:42] absolutely
[1:50:43] if not that's the reason why the the
[1:50:46] children have all the challenges out
[1:50:48] there
[1:50:49] and then when they come when they also
[1:50:51] have challenge at home
[1:50:53] right
[1:50:58] and then
[1:50:59] you know and the young and the young
[1:51:00] child can argue no that's that's that's
[1:51:02] what my teacher said
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:06] he says no that's why that's what i'm at
[1:51:08] you don't know that i mean that's what
[1:51:09] my teacher said
[1:51:12] well because now a strong influence of
[1:51:15] teaching is from out there
[1:51:19] and there is a lesser influence from
[1:51:21] teaching
[1:51:22] in the home
[1:51:23] right yeah
[1:51:27] for sure
[1:51:29] praise the lord
[1:51:30] and when that when when when when the
[1:51:33] home teaching is weak
[1:51:35] then you see them
[1:51:37] you know starts to dress because the the
[1:51:40] the stronger influence of teaching is
[1:51:42] from outside so they pick up the
[1:51:44] dressing from outside they pick up their
[1:51:46] language from outside
[1:51:49] and they bring it home because the
[1:51:51] teaching home is weak
[1:52:04] teaching is the first principle
[1:52:08] is the first principle when the child
[1:52:10] get it out when the child get it from
[1:52:12] home when they go out they will
[1:52:15] challenge whatever they see out there
[1:52:18] absolutely say no my my my mom don't
[1:52:21] dress like that
[1:52:23] that's right
[1:52:24] we don't we don't dress like that
[1:52:33] that's the first principle
[1:52:35] and that's that's the parent's
[1:52:36] responsibility
[1:52:38] to teach the child
[1:52:40] you might not know uh uh
[1:52:42] what two times two is
[1:52:45] but you know what decency is
[1:52:50] praise the lord
[1:52:58] take for example when a when a parent is
[1:53:00] teaching
[1:53:01] division to a child what do they do
[1:53:04] they say so
[1:53:07] it says
[1:53:09] uh trinium if we have
[1:53:11] if we're having four
[1:53:14] four apple
[1:53:16] and you
[1:53:18] and mama
[1:53:19] and your sister and myself we about to
[1:53:22] divide it
[1:53:23] how many each person would take each
[1:53:26] person will take one now so you see that
[1:53:29] way of teaching
[1:53:31] keeps the family in the mind of the
[1:53:33] child
[1:53:36] they associate what they are learning
[1:53:39] with the home
[1:53:41] sure
[1:53:45] praise the lord the teacher will get on
[1:53:47] the ball
[1:53:49] and you know they will write all the
[1:53:51] letters they will they will say you know
[1:53:53] one two three four five six but when the
[1:53:55] parents are teaching
[1:53:57] it just happened subconsciously you
[1:54:00] always relate the teaching to what is
[1:54:02] happening home
[1:54:04] sure
[1:54:10] if you ate the thing that your mind gave
[1:54:11] gave you yesterday what would remain
[1:54:13] there
[1:54:15] so home
[1:54:17] stays in the mind of the child
[1:54:20] when they go out to school
[1:54:22] and a work is given to them they relate
[1:54:25] at home
[1:54:33] praise the lord
[1:54:37] but the the that that is the default of
[1:54:41] the society that we are living in
[1:54:45] the children are turned over
[1:54:49] to a destructive society to teach them
[1:54:56] praise praise the lord
[1:55:10] and that's and and that's some of the
[1:55:11] things that affect also the local
[1:55:16] church if the church is not rightly
[1:55:19] taught in the word and the people can
[1:55:22] you know just feed from the
[1:55:24] different youtube channel and listen to
[1:55:25] their different things that they are
[1:55:27] listening to they get confused
[1:55:29] sure
[1:55:35] if it creates a sense of resentment
[1:55:38] when the preacher is preaching now that
[1:55:41] their wrong teaching or whatever has you
[1:55:44] you have been following stays in the
[1:55:46] back of your mind is is now is you are
[1:55:49] now fighting with what what is coming
[1:55:51] from behind the puppet
[1:56:02] are we together
[1:56:04] do you see you see the the direction we
[1:56:06] were going tonight
[1:56:11] god's purpose is to bring us to maturity
[1:56:17] and our sense of growth is in a way that
[1:56:19] we are taught
[1:56:23] the beauty of the church is the
[1:56:24] character of the people
[1:56:31] is the character of the people
[1:56:33] right
[1:56:36] let's buy with his tonight

[1:57:55] instruction
[1:57:57] in righteousness
[1:58:02] and your word says
[1:58:04] that your word would not go out and

[1:59:19] where men may see our good words and
[1:59:21] give the glory to you
[1:59:23] knowing that it is only god who can do
[1:59:26] it

[1:59:29] that you have brought us this far
