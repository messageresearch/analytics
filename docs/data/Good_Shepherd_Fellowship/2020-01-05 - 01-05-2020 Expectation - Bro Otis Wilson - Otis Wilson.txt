finish it tonight praise the Lord I know everybody from eating can a little bit I am I am really really tired yeah our done in Alaska have services in in a way the where is that on a seven degrees negative freezing cold and now you have to be outside on a mountaintop in that Co having wedding yes right after the wedding my weapon now gotta run and take off riding just just just tired brother so just keep me pretty tonight amen I said not to take much time I don't think I will be able to take much of your time but I just want us to just look at a few things get our heart ready for the communion service amen just want to just take the terms in chorus you in the word amen and I pray that God will help us all go reach the Blessed letter just open our Bible to the book of John chapter 14 god bless the musician appreciate that amen we just want to just go to the world quake we get in very short time it's doing the Seas right okay we just fish a very short time just ago I might not be so much emotion today of shutting here and there because I trust I just want to kind of make you to understand what I were preaching at last I was here I didn't finished I'm messy because there was no time so there's there's a major part of the message that I wanted you to see and I pray that God gave me grace tonight so you can see that and I trust that each and every one of us this morning you know and what better one were preaching this morning you know I was standing back in Alaska on Friday and I was thinking as a lawyer if I go down to Minnesota why you want me to just encourage these things you know and he kind of the Holy Spirit kind of bring it in a different way but as we go through you'll be able to see what I'm talking about but those of you who really get a spiritual understanding you'll be able to see exactly what I'm talking about because we're live in such an age but we need a revolution I would say that again we are live in social age we need revelation if you don't have revelation you will leave this messy I'm telling you seriously this is 2020 I was telling the church in Alaska butter brown said I will come in to read the world amen I'm just gonna talk to you tonight but Brown said when you preach the message alone he said that two things are happy in every year I don't know if you know that you say every year that comes two major thing happening you see the world were in greater darkness and in the light so if you're not working the lag you are going to work in a greater chaos so though like last year 2019 the killing the rib day the evil that took place gonna multiply more this year because they are already photo by a profit so if you don't work in the lag you're walking pretty badly so brother God need to give up grace I trust that glory happy this man just a short association definitely for a bridge am i nothing table you will see what I'm getting and then we'll leave it open the game for and other time we can't press the law now in John chapter 14 verse 12 this into what Jesus a yes it's a very familiar scripture on the tangle of a better one you know it's a very humble brother I've been knowing for a very long time and always coming yeah we are standing year to just encourage the students of the Lord the privilege amen just want to thank the Lord for that he said John chapter fourteen listen what he said you rest with it's a very very I'd say unto you and this is when Jesus was the season when he was about to leave very very I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go on to my father praise the Lord god bless you you may be seated now when I was here um last time I was looking at a message on protection for the change if you yeah you can remember that amen and I pick up the story on this blind guy who was sitting at the gate of beautiful and now we went through the whole series and uh you could see how and I were trying to show you a picture and I want you to keep everything attention to my be very sure we go through this and you'll be able to see we come to our communion service but I was trying to bring a picture so you can understand brothers and sisters our existing on earth is very important you are not just yet because you want to be God now I just brought you on earth and place you on the face of the ethical go so you'll be a good guy you work make good money and that's not the purpose go play so yeah and I trust that God would get for almost a me that's why when we Roma saying this money will refund as I said who we are saying and that's the part we miss it because we we claim it a big Christian we claim to be believers all year we believe a messy Gaussian a profit and this is what it is ABC and D we can call all that message we can we can say all we can say but this is the this is the thing this is where God is telling this money to say who we are saying everybody's running up a job everybody running after your physical livelihood everybody want to see how best you can get on the top how wet can get this amount of money in here I can't how oh I need to marry this person and in 2 3 4 5 the thing is you know we are diverting from the major part of our existing on earth and running after the the negative part of our little sister this part of us is the negative so if go out don't open our understanding to see the reality of who we are and the major purpose or why we're here whether you miss the home Mac in every effort you put in coming to church every effort you put in paying your tithes every effort you put in doing everything you miss them might because you you you you you you caught us in the stage of Elisha and the devil deceive you you walk in at the vain things just to modify and glorify and bring satisfaction though this man and not forgetting that this man is going to the doors now listen to what Jesus said when he was a battery we say is a hitter believer in me the work that I do so he do greater now what one way he said that there is a portion of the ministry to continue okay you understand what I'm saying brother sister it varies a portion of the ministry the container jesus here is looking at the disciple intelinet he that believes a main greater world in there so Richmond there is a portion that remains there is an appropriate part of the ministry that must be complete now we are going to do that and our the voice is saying this morning who shall I say so the question comes to each and every one was better look at yourself look at what you're doing when you woke up in the morning what you think about when when when we just where you've been what is for of your mind what do you think in the back while it's evening do you want what what is really your priority in life everyday who I'm talking to someone because if you mention that you miss everything so let this this is what I were trying to bring to your mom when about yeah this is the man that we just carry around sit on his knee what's called drunk door right he was here right and now you're saying this John Doe man he was born crippled I'm not going to go back to the mess you undo the mess by just starting from this you can understand to pick up from this morning after the stands we can take communion but just to be able to just elevate your faith a little bit to see brothers and sisters we are not on this earth just because we are yay we are not called to this messy just to cut what better brands say no there is a great great reason why and I trust that God would give our understanding tonight before we can come to this table because this is the part of identification you come in your community with God you are identifying yourself with him brother you will need revelation I trust that God would give her grace so now so this John does get with her bad okay we spin the whole story is the 14 years 40 years he was born in he was born the doctor pronouncing that he would never walk him mom and dad pray for him did they everything the cool but yeah he never walk 14 years he went through that part of his life now I was senior a child of God because every child of God a single mind before the foundation of the way you were single mind I was single mind so God knows everything about you he knows everything about me he knows everything we go into him everything we well go to septum I can say or distance is going to go to this team there yeah let me just another simplified but they're like they won't do we get honorable and weird writing down okay I had to do that God is not leaning back he already knows the beginning he knows your head and estimated we're gonna go true in this light pre-planned now as a child of God as we are children of God it is he his divine power he controls our life he honest you I'm saying to my church so you're like this managing seemed to come in this motor flight never ever seen on a day it's not the world but the sea war had nothing to do with it is the border that is manageable I said we baptized shall feel funny to do what - be well tested that's the messy this yet the prophecy you as a child of God and gamma u naught u naught you from God toward you not come escaped into your to fight as the war body will happen he baptized you from the war body into the dimension of mortality in order for you to be tested so you don't know the next minute from yet you don't know tomorrow it is go purpose you doing that in order to be well test it now what is the test your test is different from my test my own I'm saying this is one see like gotcha or get drawn bow you're gonna come in there you're gonna be you will be born lame you were now work because I have a greater profit now this is what I'm trying to get to the austere tribe the bride and believe for the Christian who father who I catch the revelation of this message I believe this message sometimes we don't we only said what we don't we found out the crowd oh we supposed to go to church didn't let go to church or to the Eva 70 we father the crying and and rejoicing in emotional in the I believe the message versus sister your action prove you don't believe the message you how did you prove you don't believe the message the revelation you expressed in the way you grabbed at a a proof that you don't believe the message now so let's just open our Bible net to the book of Acts chapter 3 let then you beyond understand I don't have sufficient time but at least I get Ted a minute to preach and that would be 8 you know for coming up but I trust that it will help us praise the law now Acts chapter 3 listen now I want us to read very carefully very carefully just really follow me very carefully I stepped the tree first one we're gonna read everything missing we're gonna we're just gonna run with that am I gonna have chapter 3 verse 1 now listen very carefully now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being announced out and the setting man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they live dated at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful so a team of them they enter into the temple who we see Peter that John about to go into the temple eyes and Ames and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John said look on us he did he onto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said silver and go have our North but such as I have give IP in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk we want you out of there right and to him and he took him by the hand and lift him up and emitter his feet and ankle bones received strength the very thing that dad to say we're not happy because the doctor gave the parents that report that did shy uncle boo and feet we never be strong so he can walk now bringing you to understand that your existing on earth go up replaying your lab because he had a purpose for what he going to do in your life on this so the fact that God at the point in time will open your eyes to the revelation of the message in your bed it's not just for you to rejoice is not just for you to say oh yes I believe the mess around corner there is a great my god opening your eyes to see who you are in one day with me to wake up because you will walk on the air I walk on the earth and you unless they actually serve either they're gonna be a writer because you not pay attention to who you are and that is what the devil is doing too many people in the in the rezidentura said there's not taking people out of the message yeah he's doing that also but he even made you scare in the message he bring a religious spirit on you and he said oh that's enough all you need to do go to church pay your tax pay you're free and that's enough you don't read you don't pray you you play games with if you come into church there is no pool you know that desire where we should let go to child labor but I want to seem to me that God calling or back to the book of that is our well-being you how to cylinder today a service day I couldn't do everything today to be in church nothing going to stop me I would do everything on my schedule just because today is the gallery of the Saints that pool I'm not talking about they I'm talking about the pool the desire way ain't you a defeat in your session or today Saturday I wanna be I got to be Wesen saying that somebody calling you it's not the pasta pocket to you know it is something in you and deep calling for that feeling you want to feta show your father you have enough and when the devil cannot speed that away from the child of God no better sister Deborah cannot steed that said okay he will come telling with dysentery your daddy Barry should be caught with that deep down when I walk in here to Deborah download come you see your kids are excited when you see you and I saw they I left over for days something they want to see daddy something you wanna be something you just want to see I want to be in the presence of my life Brennan sister if you lacking that something is happening to your Christian this very first a lot okay now so let's just read so after 40 and I got him down in bring strength it's a dealings of this guy who did that to say according to a record he wrote it down his stomach inside of this man would never walk after 40 years go prove the signs that no science is my decision praise the law the gunner can tell you get can't so you're going to die that is a lie as well my mother said by the strap and you must believe a reporter board in the repair of the

why will you see tonight before you come to the altar and take the come here and you walk out of the door I want you to have a change of mine a change of spirit a change the perspective of how you

in me I am the living manifestation of the invisible God you don't catch ability sister I am the living manifestation or be invisible God [Music] now watch we're happy Larry Peter 70 he will remember 60 then Peter says 7 and go home or not but such as I'd give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediate his feet and ankle bones received strength no why and he leaping up stood and walk and enter with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God why and all the people saw him walking and praising God pay attention and then knew that it was he was sad for him at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with one not in amazement at that which are happening on to them now see why God is

you may have you seen let's take our Bibles [Music] he was there by faith I receive and I'm so happy although first corinthians chapter 11 first corinthians chapter 11 or read from verse verse 23 first Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night that's what we are yet is evening the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament of my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for us of us ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come Werfel whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat the bread and drink that drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep and I'll sleep actually is part in this life as soon as I'm in ourselves we think on our way we are not looking into the righteousness of our flesh we remind ourself all the time that is the Lamb that gets on an examination is now the worshipper but here is the thing that brings damnation when we don't believe in what the sacrifice that he had made he died like Paul says actually in the book of Timothy to abolish death and if his death was it if his death was to abolish death then is it also abolished seen [Music] praise the Lord [Music] Saint John chapter praise the Lord chapter 13 [Music] so John chapter 13 verse 2 after supper was ended the devil having put now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betrayed him Jesus nor either his father are given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and lay aside his Galman and took a towel and gather himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wept in wave the towel wherewith he was gathered then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto Him Lord does they I wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what I what I do that I knoweth not now but - I know yeah after Peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if if I washed in there there had no part with me Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head jesus said unto him he that is watch needeth now saved to wash his feet but is clean everywhere and yeah I clean but not all for he knew who she betrayed him therefore he said yea and not all claim you know this is a very strong statement Jesus norine Judas was sitting right there he just may talk of the wine he partook of the bread and that is the reason why when we come to this place we try to be earnest with ourselves and confess our sin because if you don't do it you will leave from here and just go and do worse what you were doing Judas left from there and went straight to betrayed Jesus he left that table and went in betrayed Jesus that's why we pour our hearts we try to be earnest Lord you know who I am you know you know help me my desire is to walk away from this wheel of life and God will honor your earnest desire first words so after he had washed their feet and have taken his garment he was sit down again and he said unto them know ye what I have done unto you ye call me master the Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the seven is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he has sent him if ye know
