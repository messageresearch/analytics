[34:34] their service down and and wanting all
[34:37] those that can make it up talking to

[34:51] able to make it so we we're just looking
[34:53] forward to have a wonderful time and uh

[34:59] it's good for our little space don't get
[35:01] worried amen we we are serving the god
[35:05] that open the rest he can open these
[35:07] walls amen so don't get worried the how
[35:09] God can bless us don't stop panicking
[35:12] don't stop panicking please no panick
[35:14] here amen praise the Lord don't startop
[35:19] panicking
[35:22] amen don't stop panicking if we have an
[35:25] earthquake we just pray we all survive
[35:27] what happened is that now we can have a
[35:31] basement praise the
[35:34] Lord
[35:35] amen amen so we looking forward to that
[35:39] looking forward to that that we all have
[35:41] a wonderful time in the presence of the
[35:43] Lord amen I know when we were having
[35:46] those special meetings years ago it was
[35:48] hard to GA the people from Iowa here you
[35:51] know two years we went down there and
[35:53] supported the meeting and brother Brooks
[35:55] was so heartbroken that you know they
[35:57] couldn't come but this time they are
[35:58] fired up so that we'll look and see it
[36:01] amen we'll look and see they are all
[36:04] they are all fired up and uh uh I'm
[36:07] going to change what I was talking about
[36:10] uh Wednesday night I was talking a
[36:12] little bit on on
[36:16] U uh I was talking on
[36:19] uh uh the move of Vision on this uh the
[36:24] effect of the move of God and what I was
[36:26] trying to bring to us on Wednesday night
[36:29] is for us to just understand when the
[36:32] Bible
[36:34] says one day to God is a thousand years
[36:39] to us we are very
[36:42] slow no matter how fast we try to
[36:45] go because uh uh when when we live in
[36:49] the Spheres of M matter in
[36:53] time it slow us down science prove that
[36:57] that gravity slow us down so uh
[37:04] uh and what what I what what I was
[37:07] trying to help us to see is
[37:10] that when God speak his word because
[37:14] he's not on our time
[37:16] zone the word goes
[37:19] out the word has already goes out we
[37:23] take time to catch up with what God said
[37:26] we take time to catch up with what he
[37:28] promised but his word has already gone
[37:31] out it has already performed what he has
[37:34] said that's the reason why Jesus I mean
[37:38] brother B would said if Jesus was here
[37:40] this morning wearing my suit and you
[37:43] come for prayer he will say I've already
[37:45] done it amen it was already done you
[37:49] just need to catch up with
[37:51] that praise the Lord now you see the
[37:54] reason why that is important is because
[37:58] it it establish our faith in the
[38:00] finished
[38:02] work it's not what you are doing is what
[38:05] he has already done and you have to
[38:09] constantly believe it until it
[38:11] materialize in your
[38:14] body praise the Lord or else we would
[38:18] just we would just be working ourself up
[38:20] and you know and and you know when uh uh
[38:24] uh uh but that's that's what I was
[38:26] trying to bring and you know
[38:28] uh bless his heart after the service my
[38:31] good our good friend brother Derek you
[38:34] know we met out there and we were
[38:35] talking he he he appreciate the
[38:38] service then he he said brother one I I
[38:40] will I will text some things to you I
[38:42] will you know uh we just talk a little
[38:44] bit and I said well send those
[38:45] information to me those are things I
[38:47] have read before but a few of the things
[38:49] that he sent to me uh you know based on
[38:53] the fellowship we had in the service we
[38:55] pre uh
[38:58] he send this uh um Einstein you know uh
[39:03] T of General uh
[39:07] relativity and in
[39:10] there he say the time is also time is
[39:14] also different when uh you start to
[39:17] travel faster if we took a trip
[39:21] traveling as fast at H as the speed of
[39:26] light for six months away from the earth
[39:28] and then and then uh came back for 6
[39:32] months you will experience that trip as
[39:36] one year of
[39:38] travel you just go 6 months you come
[39:41] back yeah uh and and what happen is
[39:43] there
[39:45] the the person that
[39:47] gos when they come back we become older
[39:51] than
[39:53] them we become older because the tri in
[39:57] the speed of
[39:59] light it does not affect or
[40:03] change their atoms in the way it affect
[40:06] us here praise the
[40:09] Lord
[40:11] amen now we we we talk about the body
[40:14] change is truth though because when the
[40:17] the ones that have left us and have gone
[40:21] before us one fact there is that they
[40:24] didn't go with the body that they had
[40:26] that we know Year Praise the Lord but
[40:29] another fact there is that if they will
[40:31] even come back they will be younger than
[40:34] we
[40:36] are that's why when we look for our
[40:39] loved ones we don't look uh for you know
[40:42] uh them in an older body we look for
[40:44] them in the younger body and I hope I
[40:46] will be able to dwell on there because
[40:48] all all I'm trying to do okay I think I
[40:51] did something wrong here I didn't ping
[40:54] this thing to the back of my so bugging
[40:58] me okay I think it's better now so uh uh
[41:02] that's that's what I was trying to do
[41:04] but last night as I was I was just

[41:10] running my mind through everything and I

[50:37] able to pull out of me this morning now
[50:39] as we were studying on the on the uh the
[50:43] effect of the move of God we we read
[50:46] this scripture we read this quote sorry
[50:49] we read this quote from the spoken word
[50:51] is which is the Original Seed and and
[50:54] and and brother Brandon says now that's
[50:56] why each Revival has its own he says uh
[51:00] each generation has its own Revival and
[51:04] and and you know God raised him up a man
[51:07] and and set him with the word and start
[51:09] him out for the uh with the message he
[51:12] says as soon as the man is taken of the
[51:15] scene somebody else come and and catch
[51:17] it and hybrid it he says if it fall back
[51:20] to be perfect he says I will stop here
[51:22] for a
[51:24] minute we are in know hry see go back
[51:28] that's exactly what it start uh it
[51:32] started wait in the beginning of Genesis
[51:36] God set
[51:38] forth his crup in the human Rays okay
[51:41] that's that's not what I want to get to
[51:43] I will drop down a little bit he says
[51:44] each
[51:45] generation CA is repeating back again to
[51:48] Adam and Eve he says
[51:52] here uh this is what I want to get to
[51:54] it's giving me too much of for read
[51:58] he says now remember okay now I remember
[52:01] correctly that's why each generation has
[52:04] its own
[52:05] Revival it get a chance at the word amen
[52:11] so God gave every one of us a fresh
[52:13] chance at the word that's why we can't
[52:16] live on Pentecostal Revival we can't
[52:18] live on uh you know metad this revival
[52:21] or uh the Luther Revival he gave us a
[52:25] fresh chance at the word amen he gave us
[52:29] an opportunity for us to see when Luther
[52:32] said the judge shall live by faith
[52:35] something from this Bible was quicking
[52:37] in his heart to make him to realize that
[52:40] this word is real I we together praise
[52:44] the Lord when John Wesley was uh was
[52:47] returning back uh from his Revival year
[52:50] in America and on the shap he was with
[52:52] these uh uh uh uh Christian men you know
[52:56] uh and and he realized that this man had
[53:00] something that he never had just imagine
[53:02] he was a preacher he grew up in the
[53:04] church the son of Susanna Wesley and
[53:07] Samuel Wesley that was a preacher he
[53:09] grew up in the church he became an
[53:11] evangelist came to America you know had
[53:14] a Revival but yet in his heart he
[53:16] realized that H uh he need more of God
[53:20] praise the Lord and when he met this man
[53:23] on the ship it changed his life that's
[53:25] how he broke in to his Revival he got a
[53:28] fresh chance of the word so God gave
[53:32] each and every one of us a chance at the
[53:36] word amen he don't want he don't want us
[53:38] going on Mama experience or daddy
[53:41] experience he want you to have your own
[53:44] experience praise the Lord he want you
[53:47] to have your own experience are we
[53:51] together praise the Lord I've done this

[1:00:34] lord well in in in a good term if you go
[1:00:37] back to Revelation chapter 17 and 18 is
[1:00:40] because the church was caught in
[1:00:43] adultery she was committing fornication
[1:00:45] with the kings of the earth so that's
[1:00:48] the reason why Revelation 184 sounded in
[1:00:52] Revelation 3 14 come out of home on
[1:00:56] people because he couldn't go into that
[1:00:59] adulter system so he said come out of
[1:01:02] her are we

[1:01:43] coming of the Lord has been spoken
[1:01:46] about praise the
[1:01:49] Lord the Rapture message is preached in
[1:01:52] you know in in many different ways BR

[1:01:57] that went out looking for the brde but
[1:02:00] this morning I want to talk on uh uh uh
[1:02:03] uh a life and
[1:02:06] remain a life and remain that that that
[1:02:10] is the condition where the church the
[1:02:13] Rapture Church supposed to be
[1:02:15] in she's not a sleeping virgin amen no
[1:02:21] she's not a sleeping virgin she's an

[1:02:55] have have nothing to say we prayed and
[1:02:57] go home brother bam says now I choose
[1:03:00] this he's talking about the message how
[1:03:02] can I overcome he says now I choose this
[1:03:06] because that I think that it is a time
[1:03:09] that we should never let the spirit of
[1:03:12] Revival
[1:03:13] die praise the Lord amen you see that's
[1:03:17] the reason why we talking about the move
[1:03:20] of God because what is Revival Revival
[1:03:23] is the move of God when God move in
[1:03:25] power
[1:03:27] praise the Lord amen and and and that's
[1:03:31] what the spirit of Revival is to the
[1:03:33] church is the move of God God is moving
[1:03:36] Us in different ways amen he's moving us
[1:03:39] he's changing our ideas you know he's
[1:03:42] taking us from a legalistic approach to

[1:03:48] relationship with him is now dos and

[1:16:08] I come back to that and you know uh
[1:16:10] during the week uh uh brother Lawrence
[1:16:13] gave me the call and and I I I just I
[1:16:16] felt so blessed with our little
[1:16:17] conversation we had I think the you know
[1:16:21] the their night uh uh uh prayer meeting
[1:16:24] and think the they were doing is
[1:16:25] somewhere there in the Book of Judges so
[1:16:27] you know last week we we spoke a little
[1:16:29] bit about the rare haer you know uh
[1:16:32] taking her as a type of Christ amen uh
[1:16:36] Christ in Bride form because uh she's a
[1:16:39] female now so what there uh uh there in
[1:16:43] in in the Book of Judges you remember
[1:16:46] Samson referring to his his girlfriend
[1:16:48] as Maher he told the Phil the the
[1:16:52] Philistine you won't get this thing
[1:16:53] until you temper with Myer you know so
[1:16:56] it looks like that CAU is mine you know
[1:16:58] and he called me and and then you know
[1:17:01] and then we we I was I was just I was
[1:17:04] just sitting there and and what was
[1:17:06] happening to me is that I was thinking
[1:17:07] in my mind see how God can bring his
[1:17:10] word Al life amen yeah uh the preacher
[1:17:14] might not have the the ability to really
[1:17:16] break it down but the Holy Ghost can be
[1:17:19] able to pick up something and just you
[1:17:22] know and just make that word real to you
[1:17:24] amen so when he called me I mean I was
[1:17:26] just I was blessed with the conversation
[1:17:28] praise the Lord
[1:17:31] hallelujah and it's it's very beautiful
[1:17:33] when you studed on there it's very very
[1:17:35] beautiful and and I think that is the
[1:17:38] place where you know uh uh uh you know
[1:17:41] uh sisters we we get our comfort we get
[1:17:44] our strength from you know because uh uh
[1:17:48] uh uh we we we living we living in a
[1:17:50] world you know where with with all the
[1:17:53] the struggle that and gender struggle
[1:17:56] and everything that is going on in the
[1:17:58] in the present world that we are living
[1:17:59] in you know people will come to the
[1:18:01] church and see us and say oh no you know
[1:18:03] uh uh uh uh you guys approach it you you
[1:18:07] put you put the women down and all of
[1:18:08] that I mean she has a very special place
[1:18:11] in the scripture you will you will not
[1:18:14] believe it the amount of types the
[1:18:16] amount of places where the woman type
[1:18:18] Christ praise the Lord when Jesus say I
[1:18:21] will H you as a hand that's a type of
[1:18:24] the right I mean the hand is not it's
[1:18:27] not a male it's a female praise the Lord
[1:18:29] when God appeared to Abraham like elshad
[1:18:33] is not a male is the breasted one it's a
[1:18:35] female praise the Lord so you see she
[1:18:38] has this hidden place because the
[1:18:40] strength of the woman is hidden praise
[1:18:43] the Lord amen the strength of the woman
[1:18:46] is hidden yeah like like like we learn
[1:18:48] from the word you know God plac it in
[1:18:50] those Godly virtues that he gives to
[1:18:53] woman praise the Lord and and and and if
[1:18:55] the grace can come for our young sisters
[1:18:58] to be able to grab the revelation of
[1:19:01] that amen praise the Lord they will know
[1:19:03] that I mean no there there is no
[1:19:05] Philistine boy in the word can be able
[1:19:08] to talk anything in their ear because
[1:19:10] they realize that uh you know that this
[1:19:12] joy that I have the word didn't give it
[1:19:14] to me this virtue that I have the word
[1:19:17] didn't give it to me the world can't
[1:19:18] take it away praise the Lord I mean
[1:19:21] beautiful types to see how she typed the
[1:19:24] red half her you know uh uh uh she was
[1:19:28] the one that the promise of redemption
[1:19:30] is given to I mean it's it's just
[1:19:31] beautiful I just believe that is uh the
[1:19:35] ignorance or Revelation that makes
[1:19:37] people to think that the woman is uh you
[1:19:40] know she's she's cast down she's nothing
[1:19:42] she she she's so uh no no no God has a
[1:19:45] very special place for her amen and so
[1:19:48] much that he he gave her the the the the
[1:19:50] promise of redemption because she has
[1:19:53] the mystery of redemption
[1:19:55] are we together I'm almost feel feel
[1:19:58] feel like changing my my subject now and
[1:20:00] just go into that direction and just
[1:20:03] show you tipes over ties that is right
[1:20:05] in the scripture that speaks of the
[1:20:07] place of the woman how special she is to
[1:20:10] God you think about it that was the
[1:20:13] animal for sacrifice that's what Israel
[1:20:16] cannot have their Temple worship because
[1:20:18] they don't have that animal and see the
[1:20:21] way that God designed it the harer is
[1:20:23] never born
[1:20:31] M praise the
[1:20:34] Lord and when they have that that haer
[1:20:38] and and and they burn it they got to use
[1:20:40] the a sparingly because I mean it might
[1:20:43] not appear for many
[1:20:51] years how manyan we can go down this
[1:20:53] road
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] uh and what a blessing it is amen now so
[1:21:00] he speak here he says uh getting over
[1:21:03] that Old Log and what what is called
[1:21:05] Hollow he talks about that you know he
[1:21:09] was going over a rotten log he says and
[1:21:11] that is the way uh the Christians are
[1:21:14] becoming uh they've been dead in sin and
[1:21:17] trespass so long
[1:21:19] till become dting they can hold no way
[1:21:25] praise the Lord
[1:21:29] amen they can hold no weight I heard I
[1:21:32] heard one one old old preacher friend
[1:21:33] saying you know uh uh he says uh I mean
[1:21:37] if if uh if you know if if they should
[1:21:40] uh if they should arrest us they won't
[1:21:42] have enough to accuse us off of being
[1:21:48] Christian because the church has driven
[1:21:51] so much to the world that there would
[1:21:52] not be enough to to accuse them of being
[1:21:58] Christians praise the
[1:22:01] Lord the only thing that that is left
[1:22:04] with the church is just a
[1:22:10] profession brother bam say she loves her
[1:22:12] weight they hold no weight they don't
[1:22:16] know what the overcoming
[1:22:19] means I begin to
[1:22:22] think on the text then over coming keep
[1:22:25] life in you that's what overcoming

[1:22:48] this tell yourself over and over I will
[1:22:50] get out of
[1:22:52] this the desire to live the desire to to
[1:22:56] to to to bounce back the desire to fight
[1:23:00] through you just don't surrounder
[1:23:02] yourself to situation well you know well

[1:24:38] we are just legalistic everything were
[1:24:40] legalistic everything was legalist you
[1:24:42] see God did not bring the church out of
[1:24:44] catholism like that it was not from
[1:24:47] catholism to Pentacost no he started
[1:24:50] bringing them out by Reformation to
[1:24:53] justification Luther into sanctification
[1:24:56] but what is happening today people come
[1:24:59] and and they just want to get rid of
[1:25:01] legalism before you realize they far
[1:25:04] away from the
[1:25:06] truth they are far away from the
[1:25:09] truth they are not allowing God to
[1:25:11] cleanse them they are not allowing God
[1:25:14] to change them they are not allowing God
[1:25:16] to show them why they must not do
[1:25:20] this but they take they take it against
[1:25:23] the preacher or the take it against the
[1:25:25] message or the take it against the Bible
[1:25:27] to take it against Christianity and then
[1:25:30] before you realize they fire
[1:25:32] away they are worshiping Earth I believe
[1:25:35] in
[1:25:37] Earth who made the
[1:25:42] Earth I'm a I'm I'm I'm spiritual I
[1:25:45] believe in the universe I believe in
[1:25:50] wi you will not believe some of the
[1:25:52] things that people believe you think you
[1:26:03] believe let the life of God go from then
[1:26:06] and experience the joy of serving
[1:26:09] Christ and living in the church where
[1:26:13] such is going on the joy of serving

[1:27:50] make yourself uh
[1:27:52] known when you don't have nothing to
[1:27:56] show are we
[1:28:00] together so if we are trying to follow
[1:28:02] the message of the hour or at least this
[1:28:05] part of the message we should live
[1:28:08] constantly in the Life of
[1:28:11] Christ we should live constantly in the
[1:28:14] Life of
[1:28:16] Christ every day was a good day Genesis

[1:29:27] the hour at least this part of the
[1:29:28] message we should live constantly
[1:29:31] constantly in the Life of Christ see
[1:29:33] because if you don't you lay around and
[1:29:38] know that these things that you supposed
[1:29:41] to do and don't do it if you don't you

[1:30:40] Bible says he that know it to do good
[1:30:42] and does it n to him it sin then you
[1:30:46] become Dy
[1:30:48] rotting when you

[1:30:53] life from the life of God so strive with
[1:30:58] all that's in you the little strength
[1:31:02] that is
[1:31:03] left praise the Lord remember there's a
[1:31:06] prophet that told you when the weakest
[1:31:08] Christian get down on their
[1:31:11] knees use that little strength and drag
[1:31:15] yourself to God say father I come praise
[1:31:19] the Lord I'm losing it
[1:31:25] because I mean the devil is there to
[1:31:27] sound a loud you are nothing you are
[1:31:29] backsliding you are nothing you just
[1:31:32] fooling yourself he he sounds so loud
[1:31:35] but that stay verse is calling you in

[1:32:07] promise we that are alive and remain we
[1:32:10] must remain in the
[1:32:13] truth amen now we that are alive and
[1:32:17] have forsaken the message now we that I
[1:32:19] have life and you know and and turn on
[1:32:21] God we we must me we must be out a place
[1:32:25] out a position our post of Duty
[1:32:28] remaining in the truth abiding in the
[1:32:33] truth praise the
[1:32:35] Lord there will be a
[1:32:38] people hallelujah there will be one day
[1:32:42] one year but there will be a
[1:32:44] people because God is never without a
[1:32:48] witness he's never without a
[1:32:51] witness praise the Lord
[1:32:56] Hallelujah Supernatural he says right
[1:32:59] here you see the failure of the church
[1:33:01] the Pentecostal Church the Methodist
[1:33:03] Church the Baptist and all is a failure
[1:33:07] of that abiding grace of
[1:33:11] God abiding grace of God we want it we
[1:33:15] we want I mean everything is just
[1:33:16] becoming like a cash app we want to
[1:33:19] Quake we want to cash it in qu no stay
[1:33:22] there believe the word hold
[1:33:25] wait that abiding grace of God still
[1:33:29] right there hold to the
[1:33:33] promise are we together he says that is
[1:33:37] the failure you will shout you will clap
[1:33:40] your hands dance in the eyes speak in
[1:33:43] tongues that's
[1:33:45] gift gift is no good unless you are
[1:33:48] abiding in the shakana
[1:33:51] glory praise the Lord
[1:33:54] unless you are abiding in the Shak of
[1:33:57] Glory because pretty soon you will
[1:33:59] realize that uh I mean uh uh you don't
[1:34:02] even know what they said when you say
[1:34:03] Amen you don't even know when they said
[1:34:05] before you clap your hands because you
[1:34:07] are not
[1:34:13] abiding we that are alive and remain
[1:34:17] praise the
[1:34:18] Lord
[1:34:21] hallelujah I mean we we we we have all
[1:34:24] these little spiritual discipline that
[1:34:26] we had you know we we we we set up a
[1:34:30] little time for meditation a little time
[1:34:33] for for for for praying a little time
[1:34:35] for this but all of those things is
[1:34:37] becoming redundant why why are they
[1:34:39] becoming like that why are we feeling
[1:34:42] that they are not
[1:34:44] important because we are in an internet
[1:34:46] age no that's the that's the time where
[1:34:49] they're supposed to be more
[1:34:52] important because if I can't carry my
[1:34:54] Bible I have it on the phone when that
[1:34:57] time I can set an alarm on my phone to
[1:34:59] be able to remind me at 12:00 I just
[1:35:03] need to get a slice of word to meditate
[1:35:06] on I can set that up I can abide in that
[1:35:11] my day might be so busy but I can set an
[1:35:15] alarm to remind
[1:35:21] me my alarm R ring said be grateful I
[1:35:25] look at be grateful oh my thank you
[1:35:30] Lord praise the Lord amen thank you Lord
[1:35:35] just that moment just that moment it
[1:35:38] helps me to
[1:35:43] abide praise the Lord because I know I
[1:35:46] have to get out there I have to get
[1:35:47] things
[1:35:52] done praise the Lord Lord it used to be
[1:35:55] those days people write their memory
[1:35:57] verse uh of the day they put it in their
[1:35:59] pocket in their upper pocket when they
[1:36:01] work work work the take it up the Lord
[1:36:03] is my shepherd they put it back again
[1:36:05] they work work work work what what are
[1:36:07] you doing you are
[1:36:13] abiding you see the the time time is
[1:36:16] becoming busy time is becoming and and
[1:36:19] we ourself also we must prepare for the
[1:36:22] time that we are in
[1:36:29] are we
[1:36:32] together so gifts are no good unless you
[1:36:35] are abiding in the shakana glory if now
[1:36:38] you will realize your gift is going from
[1:36:43] you even if it is singing even if it is
[1:36:47] just you know a joyful person if you are
[1:36:50] not finding time to keep that that that
[1:36:54] sacred thing that God gave you in his
[1:36:57] presence in a time of meditation a time
[1:37:00] of uh uh uh uh uh you know concentration
[1:37:03] it will go away from
[1:37:08] you that's just the parable of he that
[1:37:11] have much much is given to
[1:37:15] him and it is taken from the one that is
[1:37:18] not making use of it why because you're
[1:37:21] not keeping it in his presence
[1:37:26] are we
[1:37:29] together you are living in the presence
[1:37:31] of the shakana glory the atmosphere
[1:37:34] around you is
[1:37:39] ging it's an abiding presence to know
[1:37:43] the word of God then don't look what the
[1:37:48] word what the word going to say about
[1:37:51] you
[1:37:53] is what God thinks about you praise the
[1:37:56] Lord I mean that's the reason why all
[1:37:59] the you know everything that is going on
[1:38:01] just get to us so easily because we are
[1:38:04] abiding the wrong
[1:38:06] place if we are abiding in his presence

[1:38:19] promises commit your ways to the Lord
[1:38:22] and He will direct your path he will
[1:38:23] direct your thoughts all of those things
[1:38:25] are promises if I'm abiding in that and
[1:38:29] and and committing it to the Lord I
[1:38:31] don't care what people
[1:38:33] say praise the
[1:38:37] Lord I don't care what they
[1:38:42] say I'm about in his presence because I
[1:38:44] know he can make a truth amen he can
[1:38:47] bring his word to pass he's able to
[1:38:50] bring his word to pass praise the Lord
[1:38:54] he's able to bring his word to pass
[1:38:59] Hallelujah he says I will build a church
[1:39:01] and the gates of hell would not Prevail
[1:39:03] against it I can abide in that amen I
[1:39:07] can abide in that truth and say Lord no
[1:39:10] matter what what what uh what is going
[1:39:12] on no matter how the enemy is uh you
[1:39:14] know uh uh you know coming against our
[1:39:17] people coming against the church Lord
[1:39:19] you said you will build your church and
[1:39:22] the gifts of hell will not pre against
[1:39:25] it I can abide in that
