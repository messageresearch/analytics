========================================

Oh Lord that you have brought us this far when we look at our personal lives and we look at further old God where you have taken us from and how far you have brought us we know that it is nothing but God and we owe you dear Lord Jesus all of our lives or God and we are going to save you come with me what Irina's shine we are going to glorify you further old God in this flesh we just thank you so much that you are the author and the finisher of our faith we worship the father this morning we bless the old God and we uplift your holy name our Lord and our master Jesus we don't want our service to you to be a matter of convenience that we do things because it's in our comfort zone we want to go a step further the even when the odds are against us Lord we shall do it because it pleases you further we are going to look at tithing and we are trusting in your grace or glad to help us because this is an area of opportunity sometimes it becomes a bed in doing this we are supposed to be doing and in it we'll lose our blessing but there is a lot of blessing that comes further or God when we do your will as a specter of you not the way we think about it and further we are trusting in your grace or God that you are going to help us father I be with us during this this this this this teaching and help us to see kids who may have seen but have overlooked that we may look at them again help us father we pretty in Jesus name Amen yes so as I said last week we are going to talk about money not so much about money but goes money praise be to God if I'm going to talk about your money then there is something else but we will talk about goes money it's a little of a very sensitive area and I see a lot of men of God would want who rather not talk about it because if care is not taking there people may think oh maybe he was my morning friendly to see or get into the revelation of what he is trying to say so if I first I came out today to talk about Heights he may not talk about it the way I am going to do it and I'm happy he is not the one talking about it so people may think that oh is because he wants our money praise be to God so we are going to take a before we read what I want to say is that seven God must cost you something and why it doesn't cost you anything then you have to take a second look at your walk with God I am NOT saying that there is something wrong but there may be something wrong there may be something you are not doing right praise be to God so as we are looking at tied in this morning I want us to read if we can open our Bibles to first emoji six first Timothy 6 first Timothy 6 we read 6 to 10 I'm sorry first emoji 16 I read for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows praise be to God now we are going to zero in on money even though you can pay your tithe in various forms once upon a time I paid my tights in how would I call this let me just go directly to it just land building plots of land that I just looked at what God gave me and I took the tiles out I didn't sell it I just took it land and I've also been in areas where people like tide pain when we look at where he started from when Abraham defeated the enemy he paid estate was the spoils he got from the war it was not money we have also seen where ties are paid in author of animals in food and what a view but in our setting here I don't know how many people pay ties in another form other than cash there may be famous in our midst but maybe they would even sell their produce before they think of paying their tithes so we are just going to zero in on money now just a little foundation the love of money is the root of all evil money is a very dangerous element of life we have to look at and look at it very very very well it's okay to like money that is what we are all waking we go to school we study very hard we look for good jobs why because we want good-paying jobs we want money we like it but it only becomes bad when you don't like it but then you love it then that is where the danger comes in because once it becomes a love affair with money then guess what the bubbles is it is the root of all evil it's very very very easy to be taken on our ways in our Bibles to prove s Terry nine Provost 37 profits Terry seven profits okay seven I read a prophet 379 I think I have something else here okay it's correct two things have I required after of D deny me not before I died remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with good convenient with food convenient for me lest I be full and in ID and say who is the Lord or lest I be poor and still and take the name of my God in vain we'll be getting to this very soon I remember when I was in Ghana I worked in the western part of the region for two years I was there and they brought in a guy who killed his own brother over three thousand CFA and when I converted that money around that time it was about five hundred and thirty dollars his own blood brother they went to a village and they wait for three months the money the gut they crossed a stream and when they cross the stream garnishes bother with that country and when they cross the stream the brother went down to just drink from the stream and he hugged his brother to death and then he came to the town looking so distraught and the people saw blood on him and accorded police the police arrested him and they realized that oh he took his own brother's life just because of five hundred and thirty dollars this is why I say money can be really really really dangerous and money is something you have to look at because we are going to talk of money in a little I mean all we are talking about ties has to do with money so that's why I want to build a little foundation here on money praise be to God again people can do the love of money would compel people to do anything for money again in the western region where I worked before people who go through tunnels just for the love of for the sake of money people became rats your thing is only foxes that live in holes human beings to live in holes they're brought through tunnels and the idea for two three four weeks chasing gold and people carry kerosene and food every day in those tunnels to go and sell it to them and come out they don't even know what time of day it is and then they ask you what is today's date what time of day what what what day of the week is it today that is what the love of money can do to people and we have to actually watch our relationship with money money can be a good thing money can be a button it is not how much money you have dhaka make it a button and also it is not how less of it you have Dhaka make it a good thing you can be so rich and the money becomes a problem to you and you can be so poor and a lack of it also becomes a problem to you it is not to say that God does not give his children blessings or bless him with money god bless his children his journey with money and when you see genuine blessing in the form of money in a child of God's life you can identify it you not keep that money it's like when God has given a man a gift that gift is not meant for you it's meant for the church and don't forget that God blesses his true and also with gifts with with with wealth you can have riches and it's a gift from God and your thing Oh is your effort your thing is your education you think it is your sweat so you just keep it to yourself I am NOT saying that when you have it you start by the roadside and then who has a problem and then you dish it out that's not what I'm saying that would be a very reckless way to use God's money remember the way God gives his children gifts and they use it in the house of God they'll use it for the churn of God to prosper the kingdom of God to bless the churn of God their Sam well Berta also bless you with wealth and it's not yours and God opens your eyes to see various needs in the house of God God will open your eyes to see needs in brothers and sisters life needs in the church and what I supposed to do with that money sit on it No it can become a problem it can become a blessing depending on the way you use it so don't think it is just in the first place and you can be so poor that you get yourself involved in things you shouldn't do why because you are so poor and you need money at all costs you need money to pay your rent you need money to pay your bills you need money to pay your car note you need money to put food on the table think about it and then you end up doing things you shouldn't the reason why you see people out there and getting the prostitution is just for that reason there is a why you see people day who still and go into robbery into drugs they want first money first money the love of money can put you in harm's way that was why I read proverbs thirty seven to nine too much of it can create a problem not to have it at all can create a problem and in this life don't work with the intention that oh I am going to get rich I want to get rich wealth is a blessing from God you can work as hard as a donkey and you would never get rich it will only lead you astray dunno whether it's a blessing that comes from God one time I was listening to a story I love listening to Katy yeah I sell Katy is a lot and then they told a story about a guy whose grandmother died and then when they were sharing the the wealth they gave him a blanket now think about it they may have given I didn't get all the story but they may have given somebody maybe 10,000 maybe 20,000 there may be 100,000 eh maybe somebody a car and then they gave him a blanket the first thing you would think Oh mind this is an insult oh so she didn't even love me at all when she was her life what am I going to do with a blanket but she took the blank he took the blanket and kept it and according to the story this guy was homeless he was living in a shelter and then he was given is it two hundred and fifty dollars I don't know what it was a week or a month two hundred and fifty dollars and life was very difficult for him and then he moved to somewhere in California and one thing led to another and then he had to sell oxygen the blankets on line and he auctioned the black up for two million dollars a blanket who would buy a blanket for two million dollars what whoa I mean what blanket what sort of blaka would that be and according to the story now he didn't believe it himself I mean nobody will believe the story a blanket two million dollars and the first in according to the story he paid his tide out of it and then part of the money I think he bought a home and then he donated part of the money to charity and he saying he didn't believe the story so God blesses it sure in a very peculiar way you can you would never see it coming you would never see it coming but after God has visited you in that unusual way it blows your mind they so know this must be God just work hard enough to take care of your financial needs to pay the bills but I am just going to make it either by rain or shine I must get rich no never got to that point if we get to that point you are opening yourself up for the devil to take advantage of you praise be to God so we are going to talk about money I want us to take the grid the grid out it's okay to like money as I said from the beginning because once you get greedy you never get satisfied with what you have you can have your your left hand holding maybe a million dollars here because of greed you are going to put your right hand in somebody's pocket to make sure you take the last cent they have on them is what greed can do to a man the Bible says godliness with contentment is a great gain that is first Timothy 6:6 you can read that later our time is running out godliness with contentment is a great game whatever God has given you be happy with it there isn't why some people who not pay their tithe is because of greed it's because they are not satisfied with what they have that which belongs to them the portion of the income or their earnings which is dears because they are not satisfied with it they would want to take the little that belongs to God and add it to what they have that is what greed can do you fail to see how much you have you have the greater part of it but you don't value it you never get satisfied with it you want to get the little that belongs to God you want to take it and add it to what you have that is what great can do and it's not going to help you would I help you when I raise you up at all to bring you down now God expects every child of his to pay tight there is clean money that is also dairy money you get up you go to wait you work so hard you put in your time at the end of the period you are paid it's clean money it is not your sweat it is not your energy it is not your education it is not your smartness is God blessing you the way he has done you may say oh I have good education there are people that have better education than you and yet they have never gotten to that position sometimes we think that when you have a lot of money you enjoy life no it's not true to tell you the truth a lot of the rich men you see all day they have sleepless nights we go to bed in less than ten five minutes we are gone and we're sleeping with sleep very well praise be to God the blessings of God come in various ways so when God has blessed you with genuine wealth you have way very hard clean money you are expected to pay twice from this money but remember also that the devil has a way of also giving people money that is why as a church we don't believe in gambling don't believe in gambling you can win gamble and then you have maybe mention it somebody can well rob the bank somebody can steal as I was saying you can engage in a crooked this business deal and you know what you did was wrong it's contrary to the Word of God now what I want to say here is that if anybody ever engaged in any money-making venture that is contrary contrary to the Word of God God will not even expect ties out of that money because it is contrary to the Word of God if God does not approve of that way of making money God doesn't expect any type from you but archeron of God who are genuinely working so hard who are blessed of God will take our money God expects you to pay tight now I want us to hey I see my time it's writing so let me just take a few things here in the message witnesses 1953 the prayer of God said put God first pay your tithe first pay everything pay God firsts pray fast at morning pray all through the day give God the first place in everything praise be to God in the message the faith once delivered to the Saints he also says it's part of our calling the believer today is a man who goes to church and pays his tight when I cannot try to get I mean it over clothes 200 coats or partitions I could get from the Prophet talking about pay your tithe pay your tithe pay your tithe tight pain is part of our Christian duty never take it lightly as God would grant us grace to look at this topic it will get very interesting as we go on this is just to lay the foundation I have not picked up yet this is just laying the foundation and I chose to go this way because that pain is about taking money not taking money from you it's about you giving out and there are a lot of reasons why people would want to hold on hold on to God's money that is not a good thing to do that is not a good thing to do so my time is up and by the grace of God next week we are going to go into it very well praise be to God shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank you so much for what you have learned today just trying to lay the foundation further for tithing when no father it is not a very popular subject but we have to talk about it because it's part of your word and father we are trusting in your grace Oh God as we go through this since Lord and to open our eyes to see things we may have seen before but have not given regard to them that you open our eyes further to see the blessings that come with paying our tithes now you will help us further just help us in one way or the order in any way it pleases thee we commit the rest of the service father into your hands this morning our Lord and our Savior Jesus our help in time past and our hope in ages to come the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the ending we are so grateful dear Lord Jesus for being our present help in time of trouble you are never too late you are an on-time God father we are depending on you especially coming to the end of the year we poured our hearts unto you many way they request we laid before you for our loved ones for our spouses for our children for our friends for our brothers for our sisters and we know that at your own time you are going to glorify yourself in our various situations when Lazarus was dead and he was buried after 72 hours when corruption had already set in and people were saying oh it was all gone Lazarus was dead and gone they give up but father it was not too late for you when you even came he was still on time it doesn't matter how wrong things have gone in our life it doesn't matter how bad the situation is we may have given up dear Lord Jesus but we know that one of these days you are going to visit us in a very special way you are on time God will call upon your holy name this morning come and touch every heart touch every soul speak to every need glorify yourself in every life and in every home bless us Lord will commit the man of God into your hands this morning may you speak through him minister unto us let something be said with our names attached to them now we can put our fingers or something and say this came because of me help us Lord for we have come to see you and we know we see before we live here in Jesus name Amen god bless you Saints [Music]
