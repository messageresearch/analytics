goodness praise the lord and uh but juan had a testimony that he wanted to share so seeing us it was still good to us but on sunday morning i got ready to come to church and um last weekend on saturday we had literal olivia and daughter over in and you know summer is a busy season for wasps it's a physicism for the enemy all the time too so anyways um my wife got stung on saturday and uh she didn't say nothing about it she just complained about it she says i got stunned by a wasp i said oh okay but we i gotta find i usually get on on that and and and find the nest to wherever he's at and just annihilate them get rid of them but the week went by and she kept kind of a complaining this itches you know this that on sunday morning i i said how's that how's that stains and i looked at it and it was trying it was starting to get um um what do you call those blisters on them you know and she must be allergic to uh to the sting of a wasp anyways i as i got ready like i was saying i got ready to come to church i said you know i started thinking about paul or brother paul back then in the gospel where he kind of was just riding along and persecute the christians at that age and he got knocked off his uh horse of course you you know the full story of that you know the story behind that but my wife proceeded to to to bring an empty bottle that she had run out of oil and she brought a bigger bottle and i said hmm do you need help with that hun so i said no not really but how are you going to put it you know because those bottles are empty they got this little white cap on it and you can't if you pull pour something in it it'll overflow and you'll spill it so i said let me help you honey and i took it off i took the cap off and as i was just finishing talking about the lord you know and just just meditating on those things that happened back then she started pouring that oil in that other bottle i didn't think nothing of it but it started going all over my hand and her hand and all the stuff and i said hey you know what let me see that you know and i just it just came to my heart for some reason let me see that thing you know and i looked at it again and it was just i said that that looks bad let's let's put some oil on that on that that sting and and and just spray you know so i i put oil i put all my hand put all over it and just pray to the lord and you know what i came to church had a we had a grand time we had a good time in church when i got back home when we dismissed and that was that was communion day if i'm not mistaken this past sunday and i got home and i'm thinking of it on myself i'm thinking you know i wonder if the lord i know in my heart that the lord started the healing process i know she's going to be healed because i i usually don't do stuff like that i just leave it alone you know just let it take its course when i got home i went and we sat at the table to eat and i say hun let me see that that's this thing and you can see that this thing was the the boils were gone the blisters were gone and and and and the sting was starting to clear out it was all red i mean red red with blisters okay and you could see that it just started to clear out the blisters were gone it was starting to clear out it's just just just it's just the lord in action to me you know and i and i appreciate that and i and i just thank the lord for that that to her it was a witness because of course you know she's not coming to church but but to her it was a a witness to her that god is still real you know i know he's real you know i don't nobody has to convince me of that but but to her you know she's seen that and i just appreciate that you know that was my testimony to you so don't dismay [Music] praise the lord amen lord

appreciate you father as we surrounded ourselves in your hands now in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians that will be it for the music for now maybe we could water the world with praise when we are done speaking tonight praise the lord and let's take our bible uh ecclesiastes chapter five there's uh solomon after proverbs ecclesiastes chapter five we will read solomon says here keep their fault when they are going to the house of god and be more ready to year than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider net that they do evil be now rish with their mouth and let that thine height be history to alter anything before god for god is in heaven and doubt upon earth therefore let thy words be filled praise the lord romans chapter 12. verse one abisescu brethren's by the mercy of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service praise the lord i will read that verse again but from the the amplified bible i pee to you therefore brethren and beg of you in view of all the mercy of god to make to make a decisive dedication of your body presenting all all your members and faculties as a living sacrifice holy devoted consecrated and well pleasing to god which is your reasonable rational intel intelligence service and spiritual worship let's pray one more time father we have read your word your word is internal lord this book is blessed father by inspiration and the anointing of your holy ghost you inspired men of all father lord is of no private interpretation but we're just coming tonight and asking that father you will bless the inspiration that is on our heart and father lord that our sacrifice to you tonight will be acceptable we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed tonight i want to speak on sacrifice for the wednesday night i want to speak on sacrifice i was going to entitle the sacrifice of fools but i just think that sacrifice will be enough amen even though we will talk a little bit about the sacrifice of fools because that's one sacrifice that god will not accept the sacrifice of fools amen god will not accept the sacrifice of fools so uh uh i have a i have a quote that i want to i want to start off reading uh and this is it's right there from where jesus met those disciples on the road now you have to listen to me uh uh carefully tonight um i pray that lord will be able to help us and uh i left work and came down to the church and tried to uh just rest my mind a little bit but for some reason i had just a kind of a terrible headache and then i said well let me let me rush home if i can be able to just lay down a little bit maybe i need it kind of for rest because i mean until we get back to church i keep we i keep thinking about church praise the lord amen so uh we we went home and not we're not really able to do much but we will just trust the lord that he will be able to meet us tonight amen spoke with brother prater yesterday he wanted us to want to also send his greetings to the church he looking forward to come up for uh labor day weekend so we will just continue to pray that the lord will be able to keep each and every one of us i will say that uh on sunday uh i saw myself preaching and pretty soon i was going down the air then i caught myself i said well i have to step back so if i do that i'm not doing it intentionally that's the reason why i'm staying there praise the lord amen we're doing our best to keep the rules but if you see me stepping a little bit i'm not trying to break the rules it's just that maybe i've lost my mind amen praise the lord so what uh yeah if the preacher lost his mind it's a good thing amen because you might be able to find the man of christ that way but let's look at this tonight now as we look at the subject of sacrifice and and we go back to the old testament ordinance in the book of leviticus that these with sacrifices there are five major sacrifice let me say that way five major sacrifice that moses gave to the children of israel and uh uh and and those sacrifices that moses gave the people uh those sacrifices is strange you look there in in leviticus chapter one it starts off with the burnt offering sacrifice the meal offering and the peace offering the sin offering and the trespass offering now uh uh those were the the you know the the sacrifice is that the believer comes over to the worshipper comes over to to the tabernacle and he meets the the priest and he he uh uh offered his sacrifice by bringing the lamb or bringing a tortured dove or bringing uh uh a flavor okay for the new offering now all of these five sacrifices was met in our lord jesus christ amen it was met in our lord jesus christ he was our burnt offering when jesus gave himself he never gave a part of himself he gave his all right and in the burnt offering all of the beasts was to be burned praise the lord now there's a reason why i'm saying this and uh [Music] and then the the new offering uh you know the new offering was uh uh the offering that was that was awful without living so it was without living and which of course living uh uh represents sin so christ also fulfilled that we had our peace offering we have a sin offer now if you read the book of leviticus and you and you look into this off into these sacrifices it's amazing that three of these sacrifices [Music] moses used this word that when they are offered to god they they they create sweet smell before the lord and and you will be surprised that sin offering and trespass offering are the only two offering that don't give a sweet smell to the lord now you listen to me carefully tonight as we look at this because there's this reason why i'm approaching this uh uh and and i pray that the lord will be able to to bless it he will be able to get our attention we know that we living in the dead in an age where uh uh i mean with with everything that is happening around the world the religious world you know we know that we are all born in sin shiplet in iniquity coming to the world speaking lives that is truth we are all sinners saved by grace amen but the truth there also is that christ has paid the price and that is the reason why paul the apostle who says uh uh uh she should uh sing continue because of grace he said god forbid because there is a price that is already paid and the purpose of that product that that price that is paid is to redeem us to redeem us and bring us back to our original state are we together now so uh uh looking at that looking at god purpose like uh like uh brother brandon preached the message the creator of sin and the penalty that he took to read sin out of our life that was the reason why christ went to the cross that was the reason why god took the form of a man praise the lord and you know i was i was studying and and i saw something that just gave me the jubilee dance you know uh uh it was just so it it just gave me a jubilee dance in in in israel in israel when when you buy a lane you never buy a land like we buy a land on this side of the world the term of buying the land is just a lease you never buy a land to own it praise the lord man when i was i was studying there whoo i was looking at the the the two different harvesters and i was just telling different things man it just gave me such a dance as oh my goodness what is this you know you you and and the thing there is there because you have to remember they have a jubilee year where the land returned back to its original owner praise the lord amen amen so i mean the devil is just a loser amen because this land is going to return back to its original owner amen at the end of the day praise the lord amen amen so let's let's get back to our offering here so uh christ he he fulfill all the offering the peace offering the meal offering the the same offering the trespass offering the trespass offering is more like the the the guilt offering praise the lord because yet we have we have confessed our sin yet we have accepted the lord jesus christ but the accuser of the brethren will not allow us to be free from guilt so because he will not allow us to be free from guilt there is a guilt offering that is called the trespass offering now but both the sin offering and a trespass offering never bring a sweet smell before god never bring a sweet smell before god what is that telling you tonight praise the lord amen that god is expecting you to identify more with his word than to identify with your sin nature praise the lord shall i say that again can i say it louder praise the lord amen i wish the spirit can follow me let me just speak in tongues amen then they can fall on another person then they can interpret maybe it might grab our attention but god expect us more to be to identify with his word to identify with his promises to identify with the identification that he has revealed to us as sons and daughters of god then to identify with the sin nature because the the the the the thing about this uh uh johnny crowe nature is that whenever we find ourselves in the presence of god we think dead we are appealing to god when we say lord you know i'm a sinner i'm born in sin shall iniquity we think that we are appealing to god that does not bring no good smell to god it doesn't bring no good smell to god because what is happening is that he's he's he's looking at us just like johnny crawled that the rope is cut from his legs but he will not move into the farm he keep running around that tree because he has stayed in that place for many years we got stick brother says sin is a sticky nature we get stick to those things and and and then we want to use that to appeal to god that is the reason why when we when we sin or we trespass we must we must confess it we must approach it by the word if you cover your sin you will not prosper god will not hear your prayer we must confess our sin we must deal with it according to the word and when we deal with it according to the word we must believe that it's settled are we together so as we look at sacrifices tonight that's one of the first thing i would i wanted to look at and then also in sacrifices we have to remember we have to remember in sacrifice in dealing with the subject of sacrifices jesus christ he is the ultimate sacrifice amen he is the priest and he is the offerer praise the lord he is the sacrifice he is the priest and he is the offerer are we together then you say brother one then uh where is our place we are just part of the congregation we adjust witnesses we adjust and in some places with his life in us we become part of the sacrifice i'll try to explain that praise the lord amen lets look at ah when we when we read over in in romans chapter 12 and it speaks about presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice which is our reasonable service i went looking at that and and and you know seeing how the prophet of god used that through the through the scriptures through the messages and one of the things that that caught my attention was that uh in as much as it sounds like a dedicated thing which of course it is it is also one of the simplest thing that god asks us to do is to just present ourself be there he wants you to be there he wants you to present yourself be there and in another way brother branham used that as the way of yielding yourself yielding yourself now uh solomon warned us here about offering the sacrifice of fools i did a little reading on the on the book of ecclesiastes and i i got caught up with a thought that if i have to teach on it or preach on it i like to preach on the subject that only the i mean the thing done for god is the only thing that lasts because you will realize that's what solomon brought out of the book of ecclesiastes that only the thing that is done for god will last every other thing is vanity praise the lord but i see as he talks about places in the in the the i mean the market place and the different places he comes to this subject about approaching the house of god approaching the place of worship he says wash your feet as you go into the house of the lord that we will now offer the sacrifice of fools praise the lord amen and that is and that is one of the things we you we have to know that it is one of the spirit of our age laodicea age this age that is rich and in in an increase in ghouls this age that this know it all age have just brought the ancient generation to the place of where people approach god as fools because they are so much trapped in they close the world they have so much trapped in you know everybody's seeing them driving into the parking lot they are so much trash in the big building and the cafeteria and and remember now he says be ready for what be ready to hear which means the ultimate thing in worship is the word if you miss that you miss everything if you miss the word your sacrifice it's a food amen be ready to year that is the highest thing in the house of god the highest thing is the word what is the sun service for to prepare us for the word what is the praying for to prepare us for the word the highest thing is their word and sometimes i don't know how people would dress themselves up drive to church and and just at that time for the preaching of the world that's when they fall asleep just at that time for the preaching of the word that's when they fall to sleep i mean you went through all the preparation when the lamb was being brought out the lamb were you supposed to be identified where was brought out you fall to sleep right before your priest you are sleeping when you're supposed to lay your hand on the lamb identify yourself with the lamb to be sacrificed they precede you sleeping they put every other thing before the word they would sometimes even put their feelings before the word well i never enjoy the way the sun seven leader lead the leader songs today so i mean i'm not even in the spirit that is the most tank now so let's let's go to this uh uh coat here that will be the only one i'll read to you tonight it's a little bit length late when the eyes were open they knew him and jesus was the christ and everything that patin told the christ he had vindicated it he have vandicated it everything that paid him to the christ he has vindicated it this this were vindicated vindication is one of the word that that that was that is that was used greatly around the message cycle vindication and the thing about vindication is that god do not vindicate a man no god don't vindicate any man god vindicate his word you hear people say god will vindicate me god will benefit me god do not vindicate a man god do not vanicate flesh he don't vindicate flesh and blood he only vindicate his word now i say this because this will stand out this will stand out that's the reason why no matter what were the uh miss pronunciation of brother branham but no matter what uh i mean everything that is out there brother branham will always at the end of his preaching he will always say if these things that i have told you are the truth god will vindicate it amen he would say if these things that i have told you are the truth god will vindicate it before he goes into the prayer line and that is the reason why he said how can the lord allow me to do all of these things visions and healing and allow me to teach wrong because the healing the manifestation of the gifts was a dedication to the word if the word was not right god would not back it up because god do not back a man god do not back a line praise the lord so uh uh when when when when the people when he came over to the opening of the word and the people says well you know if he's discerning is the spirit of the law but when he starts teaching he's wrong as the spirit of the devil remember god gave moses two signs amen remember god also taught moses about the voice and the sign the voice and the sign if the voice is right which is the word of god god will back it up okay it looks like i'm going away from what i want to get into tonight but that's okay and jesus was the christ and everything that petaine told the christ he had vindicated it a virgin birth healed the sake discerned the thoughts of the heart everything that he was supposed to do to be the messiah so those things that he was doing healing the sick why was god allowing him to do that because god was vindicating his word that he gave to isaiah a virgin to conceive god was vindicating his word that this man was the messiah are we together and yet raised from the dead and still didn't recognize it and they still didn't recognize it they still didn't know it after the scripture had been revealed still they never recognized him though he was the promised word now remember how beautiful that is the word that he was revealing to them showed him they have walked right with him for three years and recognize that know that he fulfilled the word there they went walking on down to emirates is that so hmm just didn't understand it they didn't get it praise the lord amen and what i want to say to to us tonight especially our young people this message is not just a a an identification in a sense like we are in the message amen with the thing that god is is uh is revealing to us from the scripture understanding these things and the things that he's doing in our life he wants us to be able to recognize and identify his presence praise the lord every every move of god in our life is from glory to glory we talk about the attraction on our mountain god takes us through different experiences for us to be able to identify him you may realize that your experiences are now for you your experiences is for you to see god it's not for you to boast how you went 40 days without food but for you to be thankful that there was a god that sustained you and the same thing as a local church as a local assembly we want to be able to understand what god is doing in our little group the messages that are coming in the way that god is helping uh uh uh he's helping us one another and things that we are seeing we want we want to understand that it's to be able to identify his presence in our midst not just that feeling of oh i came to church praise the lord the servants were good today i enjoy the song enjoy the preaching thank you brother for the preaching and and i mean and then we just go because even if i preach in any of the brothers that preach as it is the ministry of jesus christ that is in our midst whether it's a visiting preacher whether it is any of the local brothers in the church that preach we must realize that he god will not contradict himself amen he will not confuse us he's bringing us out of confusion so we want to pay attention to that and trust his grace to help us so that's the same thing that brother branham is saying here god vanicate jesus christ to this disciple when he did it he says now we know that thou art the christ for no man can do this work you know they were saying those things but it's it's almost like they they they see it this is not as the christ and then there's a time where uh when when they get into one trial or there's something happening you know uh uh their boat is in trouble and then they they get they get in despair they get trouble they forget of what he did yesterday with all that they have seen and he even taught them it is needful for me to go for the comforter to come they were right there they were listening to him as soon as he was not around they started feeling discouraged so it said that all his preaching and teaching just went over their head and he never got it and sometimes that's the way we are and if and if you and if and if we walk with god like that we will be offering sacrifice of fools you have to remember when jesus appeared to those men that was the first thing he said to them all fools slow of heart all full slow of heart you are talking about these things you are talking about all the things that he did but yet you are having doubt in your mind are we together all fools and slaw of heart solomon said we must watch our our steps watch our walk with god that we ourself will not offer the sacrifice of fools job says do should we always thank god for good things and not for evil also because when when things started happening that it did not expect his wife said let's cause curse god and die you will be offering the sacrifice of fools we have to know the important thing the highest thing in the service is the word of god that's why the prophet of god said no service is complete without the word praise the lord no service is complete without the word because the word is the highest way that god can speak to you my sheep hear my voice is the highest way that he can speak to you whether you have the gift of a dream or the vision you still have to bring all of that back to the world and are you hearing god speaking to you from the word of your day is he speaking to you from the word of your dead is he speaking to you from uh uh uh uh the message of yahweh now so all of these things let's go along a little bit he says notice then when a canto told the place after him revealing the word over again to them and show them how christ must do these things and still they didn't get it notice they rebuilt the gut them preachers for not knowing and recognizing their fulfilled scripture that was fulfilled before their eyes jesus rebuked him i mean and and and he will rebuke us the same if if uh if we were if we would soon be caring about things that are popping up on the internet and we will soon be caring about i mean uh popular views and and and people jumping into writers and and we start expressing our opinion which means we're not listening to what the messenger told us because prophecy have told us that these things will happen which means we are not listening so he has to rebuke them notice the rebuilt the god them preachers for not ignoring and recognizing the fulfilled scripture that was that was fulfilled before their eyes look tonight i was i was almost going to go into something different i wanted to talk on the three different curtains and uh but there was there was this this particular code kind of for just kind of assuming down to talking on sacrifices tonight because he is our sacrifice and he is the word praise the lord if we miss the word we miss our sacrifice there is no way we are identified with him and and and then we miss him notice his word to them fools law of understanding and how how many times many of us can be found in that situation god keeps teaching us one lesson and he keeps allowing things to happen for us to grab it and we're still not getting it and he says i will bring it back again see if they will grab it and we're still not getting it because we are not looking at the teacher we are not listening to the teacher we have put other people into the picture we have put other people into the picture take for example if god is trying to deal with with anger in your life he just see a little angry spot and he say i have to get rid of that and you have to use me to step on your toes now if you make me the subject you will never see what god want to get out of your life praise the lord are we together since we must realize that he's preparing us for a prepared city we're not we not we're not playing church we're not just coming together everything that he's doing in our life is to prepare us because brother branham says we the only thing we leave from here with is character and he want to make sure that we have it he want to make sure that we have it he want to make sure that we have reverence that we know how to reverence him because when we when we get there and worshiping the lamb the lion will be the attraction he don't want you not having a character or reverend you just looking all around looking for something that you don't like you never lost when the lamb is the attraction he's the one we must be focusing on he's the one we must be worshipping we must put no man in that place no man must feel that place and that's the reason why he's preparing us he's pointing us to the word he's teaching us the word so we cannot put our pastor in that place we cannot put the prophet in that place now jesus christ must fill that place because he's preparing us for a prepared city god will always use man whether to do good to you or to do bad to you amen he will always use man one man or the other what a good or bad but the one he wants you to see is him the one he wants you to see it is him so just like paul said present your body as a living sacrifice paul was coming from under the inspiration of the burnt offering because the burnt offering every part of the animal was burned every path surrounding it shows a life of surrounding complete surrounding to god every part remember brother branham preached those indoors he says people we will allow him in some doors of our life and we will shut other places of our life we have our own personal life our own personal things that we are doing all when it comes to the burnt offering is everything every part of that beast is burned and when it's burned it just gives a good smell to god heavenly father said oh i love it i love it when it just surrounds all and everything praise the lord he rebuked them full slow to understanding year was god himself the resurrected messiah walking along with them as we get down as we read this and get down you will see how brother branham is going to show us here because people are walking are fools they will walk right into the council of the world churches the world council of churches and they will not even know it that's what happened when a man when a person walked foolishly before the lord you will walk right into the place where you will seal yourself away from god and that was the thing that caught my attention this evening here was god himself the resurrected messiah walking along with them showing them and the same one is here with us showing us that is the thing we want to make real that the same resurrected christ is here with us showing themselves why don't you understand that christ must do these things why don't we understand that that that that the prophet of god brother branham talks about a spirit that he identified during the civil rights movement where he says they will leave multitudes to the slaughter it was a kind of a i don't want to get into those things tonight but i mean that that is exactly what we are seeing that is exactly what we are seeing because they are taking all of this uh a black live uh uh movement or whatever it is and attaching it to the civil right uh movement taking out of the gay rights and attaching it to the civil rights movement and all of that and what is it doing because it's under the wrong spirit is leading the people to the slaughter he told us about the the the the economy of america coming to the place where it is now because this is an image of the beast and she must surround everything over to the roman power rome must step in or when the when all of these things started uh and and and started talking about taking temperature and he started talking about uh i mean all the all the online preachers jump on it the mark of the beast if they take your temperature it's the mark of the beast he's going to put a chip into your head but we have been taught we have been taught what it is it's just simple rejecting rejecting when king rejected god instruction he was giving a mark when you reject the word of god god turned you over to a rebellious spirit a strong delusion so that's the thing that's the thing uh uh you know trying to contratize ourselves now feed our minds with the media we have a word i would rather a young person come to me and says did brother branham said anything about all of this uh uh uh uh economy stuff sometimes i just i feel so heartbroken when i see even uh uh uh i mean sometimes preachers get so caught up in those things and they are sending things you know that is floating through through the internet they did not even read it at some time looking at this what is this we want things to happen we want things to happen there's something i'll share with you on sunday by the grace of god but let's go ahead with this walking with them showing them why don't you understand that christ must do these things don't you know that it must be this way this way in this way and thus and thus there are sequence they are anti-sequence that are that are unfolding before our eyes praise the lord we know that by by the word of god before that be system fully comes here then and that anointing takes a man to be identified as the man of sin the bride must be out of here praise the lord so whether they are talking about chip or what are they whatever they are talking about it does not bother us because a man that is sealed with the seat of god don't worry about the mark of the beast because it's either one or the other if you get the seed of god i mean you don't have to worry they have to put a machine through your head you don't have to worry because your soul is healed if we are not sure that's when we get carried is this the mark of the beast well am i taking the mark on the beast praise the lord and all day long espounding to them the scripture and still is that soul and and they didn't know that he was standing right there then he looked around after he had preached the word and had told them and showed them the things that was supposed to be and still they didn't understand it he said fools slow of heart to understand see understand the vindicated scripture of the hour understand the vindicated scripture of the hour i was talking to uh uh a gentleman one of the guys that was working for us here then we got into talking a little bit one time and we're talking about revival talking about you know i was you know i was telling them a little bit about the revival that ran around the country while we are having everything we are having because because of the rejection of christ and and you know and then he was also he was also sharing with me you know uh uh an experience that he had in in some few revivals then he said he says you know there's there's some prophecy that is going to come back that those days those revival days are going to come back i said well what i know is that the revival is over that's why we are having what we are having we are having such a spirit of apostasy strong delusion getting a hold of people he says well you know there have been some prophecies that is those revival days are going to come back and and and that just that's the church world view that's the church world view hoping the people are hoping not realizing that they have despised their day of visitation and that's the same thing with us a desire to pray that desire to read the word of god god is visiting you don't despise that because when it goes away you know solomon in the book of uh sons of solomon he dramatized that he talks about how this woman wanted her love to come her beloved she waited for him she waited for him he never came until she slept in bed and she went under her covers and he came and knocked the door and knocked the door and knocked the door and she and she gave some excuse and quickly she woke up to uh to find her beloved but he was gone praise the lord he was gone and and and she's and and and he said she went down the street looking for her beloved and and and and she and she found a man that's supposed to be the preacher and everyone that she found that wounded her with false doctrine false teaching people with true desire wanting god but on the wrong anointing wrong teachings being wounded so just like paul says if god is dealing with your heart open your heart to him the devil will not tell you to pray satan will i give you the thought to go and pray so if you feel that thought you better go and pray just having that communion just having that devotion and having that fellowship with god it helped us that that is some of the things that reduce the stress the evil stress that is in this day just don't do nothing you get so tired as safe to say you have been taking breaks the whole day is the spirit of the age is the spirit of the time that we are living in just don't make yourself useful if you don't make yourself useful you'll be useless praise the lord you don't make yourself useful you just feel useless that's the reason why they can just dress they just jump on the street they're just walking from from one street to another what are they looking for they don't know they're just all out there they're just going they're just going they're just going at the end of the day they can't even tell what they have done with their lives is the spirit of the age and it's upon the people it's the last day of spirit then it's nine o'clock year so i should be able to close here let me just drop down yeti and uh that would be uh on paragraph 66 sister faith why the church ought to be the most why it ought to be in a glorious stage now and the power of his resurrection great signs and wonder listening to that they they have fooled around so much with this till they are walking blindly into the incommunica council they have fooled around so much with this pentecostals they are all embracing the pope they are all embracing unity because they have fooled around so long that he can no longer take his thing for the world and that's that's where my emphasis is tonight offering the sacrifice of fools watch how you are walking with the word they are blindly walking blindly into the incoming council to take on the mark of the beast and know it now that's exactly ignoring his word saying that it would do it would do that and and the thing is it's real good it's nice it makes a good offer if everybody can be one it makes a good offer we can just unite it makes a good offer let's watch our fault how we go into the house of the lord amen let's watch our steps how we are walking with him it must be a just a closer walk that's what we need musicians come up that's what we need just a closer walk and as we walk closer to him we are observing the things he's teaching us we are observing the things that he's saying to us praise the lord i mean if we don't come to service on time it's easy for you to offer the sacrifice of fools because there is no time of preparation no time of preparation you either be waiting for the the drum to put you in the spirit or the piano to put you in the spirit or the bass guitar to to just get down all your your bones so you can feel happy but we must be in the spirit we must be praying our heart must be before god we must be anxious to praise him lord i want to thank you i have come to thank you to appreciate you we must be in in the spirit and one must be i mean in the spirit of worship a lot of few things we could talk about tonight let's stand on our feet i am weak but that was strong just a closer walkway today i am weak was wrong [Music] oh jesus keep me
