[16:20] of the lord tonight we want to greet you
[16:22] all in the name of the lord jesus
[16:25] we just have we just want to have a
[16:26] little prayer meeting tonight before we
[16:29] change the order of the service
[16:32] and uh
[16:36] i think the lord has been
[16:38] so good and remains so good to us
[16:42] and
[16:43] we want to thank him for his
[16:44] faithfulness
[16:46] and everything that he's doing
[16:48] but i i just felt in my heart this
[16:50] evening that uh
[16:52] we should just
[16:54] bring ourselves before the lord
[16:57] bring all our needless pains to him
[17:01] with the privilege that we have to call
[17:03] upon the name of the lord let make use
[17:06] of it all the time praise the lord
[17:09] so i will start off here by reading
[17:11] psalm chapter 103 bless the lord all my
[17:13] soul
[17:15] and all that is within me bless his holy
[17:19] name
[17:20] bless the lord o my soul
[17:22] and forget not all his benefits
[17:26] who forgiveth all thine iniquity who
[17:29] healeth all thy diseases but branham
[17:32] says we have to remember it's an all
[17:35] amen
[17:37] who redeemeth that life from destruction
[17:41] we'll crown of thee
[17:43] with loving kindness
[17:45] and with ten of mercy
[17:48] we'll satisfy that mouth with good
[17:50] things
[17:51] so that that youth is renewed
[17:55] like an ego
[17:56] praise the lord
[17:59] and that will remind us
[18:02] that uh
[18:04] what
[18:05] the lord have started doing
[18:07] with us in this assembly
[18:10] started
[18:12] with hours of prayers
[18:16] a lot of service of
[18:19] counseling concentration
[18:23] and
[18:25] putting a lot of emphasis of getting
[18:27] back to the world
[18:29] and all of that
[18:31] i just feel you know like brother
[18:33] branham said
[18:36] he says a new church in the dedication
[18:39] of the branham tabernacle he talks about
[18:41] it in light of the church building
[18:44] but is now on it in light of the church
[18:47] building even when god starts blessing
[18:50] the people
[18:51] and instead having some sense of growth
[18:54] just like every teenagers do church do
[18:57] the same
[18:59] and
[19:00] we start changing our attitudes we start
[19:03] getting starchy
[19:05] we start
[19:06] you know picking on habits
[19:09] that we never used to pick on
[19:11] so i just feel like
[19:14] we should bring ourselves before the
[19:15] lord
[19:16] we should constantly remind ourselves
[19:19] where he took us from
[19:20] and where he's taking us toll
[19:23] praise the lord
[19:24] we have a service coming this weekend
[19:27] saturday night
[19:28] and sunday morning with brother clay
[19:30] farmer we trust in that the lord will
[19:32] give us an outpouring
[19:34] he will be able to bless us
[19:36] praise the lord you see it is now only
[19:39] to bring a good preacher to time
[19:41] it's not only to have wonderful
[19:43] preaching
[19:45] but
[19:48] god's desire is for us to bear fruits
[19:52] praise the lord
[19:53] is for us to bear fruit it's for
[19:56] is for the world to leave these pages
[20:00] and start to take a hold of our body
[20:03] that's god's desire
[20:05] that's what god wants to achieve in his
[20:07] people
[20:09] whether the young people whether the
[20:11] elderly
[20:12] he wants his word to be made flesh in us
[20:16] so let's just take our hearts before the
[20:18] lord tonight we'll just want to remember
[20:20] a few needs
[20:22] and
[20:27] and also pray that the lord will bless
[20:29] the service this weekend

[29:52] since let's let's remind ourselves how
[29:56] the enemy fought in in many ways to have
[30:00] closed this church door
[30:02] to have eliminated this assembly
[30:06] but god in his promise stands sure to
[30:09] keep us here
[30:11] and let me remind you that the devil has
[30:14] never stopped
[30:15] whenever he had a thought in the plan to
[30:17] do things he just changed his tactics
[30:22] i mean it's not a it's not a problem to
[30:24] the enemy we come and fold this building
[30:27] and yet the world is not having effect
[30:29] in our lives
[30:31] we come and fill this building and we
[30:34] don't and our attraction is not to god
[30:37] our attraction is just to a man to a
[30:40] preacher or to a name
[30:42] [Music]
[30:44] we want our attraction to be to god
[30:46] [Music]
[30:47] we want to look unto jesus
[30:51] the altar
[30:52] and the finisher of our faith
[30:55] we are not looking onto how good we are
[30:59] we are not looking onto how long we've
[31:01] been believing
[31:03] don't look onto what we are doing
[31:06] because it's so easy for the enemy to
[31:08] take our eyes from looking onto him
[31:12] and we start looking at ourselves and
[31:14] looking at how much we have achieved and
[31:16] looking at how far we have come
[31:20] and we're now looking to him
[31:29] but let's look tonight
[31:31] unto jesus
[31:32] [Music]
[31:36] how many times we have been reminded
[31:38] that the worshiper is never on an
[31:40] examination
[31:44] it's a sacrifice
[31:45] [Music]
[31:50] and all the devil want us to do is to
[31:52] examine our lives examine our thoughts
[31:55] examine what good we are doing as zombie
[31:58] how well we are addressing the zombies
[32:00] and all the things that we are achieving
[32:02] when the worshiper is never on the
[32:05] examination
[32:11] [Music]
[32:14] let's look at our sacrifice tonight
[32:18] [Music]
[32:24] let's look at our sacrifice tonight
[32:28] [Music]
[32:32] let's look unto jesus
[32:37] let's behold the lamb
[32:42] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[32:45] of the word
[32:49] can we fill him
[32:51] with our minds tonight
[32:53] can he occupy us our thoughts tonight
[32:56] [Music]
[33:07] can he be the one that is the desire of
[33:09] our house tonight
[33:12] [Music]
[33:19] can we say lord it's because of you and

[55:19] the message the god
[55:23] verse 13
[55:25] how be it when he
[55:26] the spirit of truth is come
[55:29] when he the spirit of truth is come

[55:36] for he shall not speak of himself i want
[55:38] you to underline that in your mind
[55:40] he shall not speak of himself
[55:43] but
[55:44] whatsoever
[55:45] he shall hear
[55:47] there shall he speak
[55:49] and he
[55:51] will show you things to come
[55:55] praise the lord
[56:00] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[56:02] of mine and shall show it unto you

[56:10] that he shall take of mine
[56:13] and shall show it unto you a little wine
[56:18] and ye shall
[56:20] not see me and again a little wine
[56:23] and yeah shall i see me because i go to
[56:26] the father okay i just added that verse
[56:28] there because i want us to see something
[56:31] over in genesis 22 the lord bless you
[56:34] you can have your seat
[56:38] as i said this is a prayer meeting the
[56:40] preacher will preach for you on sunday
[56:42] let me just do my little shirt amen
[56:46] praise the lord
[56:48] let me just do my little shear
[56:51] i made a statement on sunday after the
[56:53] service
[56:54] and uh which of course that is something
[56:56] i've shared with you before
[56:58] and but what happened is that when i
[57:00] went home i decided to go back and look
[57:03] at it in in the in the scripture
[57:05] and then and just like every time the
[57:08] bible will surprise you amen
[57:10] when you look at it then then then you
[57:12] start to see it clearer amen i bet you
[57:15] look at it another time you see it more
[57:17] clearly praise the lord
[57:19] hallelujah
[57:21] so
[57:22] uh
[57:24] i want to i want to just look at a
[57:26] little bit on this principle of a little
[57:28] while
[57:29] but
[57:30] uh you know after the service i was
[57:32] talking with my friend brother daley by
[57:34] the way that uh he flew out this morning
[57:37] to flagstaff to preach for brother
[57:39] brother dale smith
[57:41] and uh
[57:43] [Music]
[57:45] and then he will be there with uh
[57:47] brother doug baker and then spend some
[57:49] time in that area for a while
[57:51] just spoke to him on my way coming here
[57:53] he thank you for this for having him on
[57:55] sunday and he wanted to
[57:58] make sure that i sent my his greetings
[58:00] to
[58:01] to you all
[58:02] praise the lord
[58:04] amen
[58:06] now uh
[58:09] uh
[58:11] he was dwelling on
[58:13] abraham's sacrifice
[58:15] on sunday
[58:16] we'll do a little review
[58:19] and
[58:20] [Music]
[58:21] and look at some few things that uh that
[58:24] are in the scripture
[58:26] uh as i was thinking about this i was
[58:28] thinking how to bring it
[58:30] and when i look in the bible
[58:32] uh
[58:33] uh there's only there
[58:36] uh imagine the gospel jesus
[58:40] uh make reference to
[58:43] uh
[58:44] as jonah
[58:46] was three days and three nights
[58:49] the wheel belly
[58:50] so the son of man
[58:53] will
[58:54] stay in the heart of the earth three
[58:55] days and three nights
[58:58] so there is there is this thing of
[59:03] just looking at jonah only having the
[59:06] three days and three nights
[59:08] uh
[59:10] type in the scripture
[59:12] but it's not only jonah
[59:14] there are many places if you remember we
[59:17] talked about rahab
[59:18] how she told the spies to go and spend
[59:21] three days and three nights
[59:24] and that was also a type of the
[59:25] resurrection
[59:28] and
[59:30] there is
[59:34] i just remember
[59:36] that uh there was a picture i was going
[59:38] to show you
[59:39] a drawing i was going to show you but uh
[59:42] uh yeah okay it's okay
[59:44] praise the lord but you will you will
[59:46] realize that
[59:48] there is
[59:49] there is uh there is no place
[59:52] in the bible
[59:54] there have
[59:56] a perfect picture of calvary
[59:59] then genesis 22
[1:00:01] praise the lord
[1:00:05] and
[1:00:06] genesis 22
[1:00:08] do not only have the picture of calvary
[1:00:11] but they also have the picture of the
[1:00:14] resurrection
[1:00:17] because you must
[1:00:18] we must realize that that was the thing
[1:00:21] that drove abraham
[1:00:24] to the mountain
[1:00:25] is to see the resurrection
[1:00:28] abraham wanted to see
[1:00:31] the the same effect of the resurrection
[1:00:34] that he experienced in his body
[1:00:38] he was looking forward to see the same
[1:00:40] thing in isaac's body
[1:00:44] abraham never went to the mountain with
[1:00:46] any fear or any doubt in his mind
[1:00:53] he was more eager
[1:00:58] he was eager and anxious to kill him
[1:01:00] because he believed
[1:01:02] that god would raise him up
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:08] praise the lord
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:13] and uh
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:17] we will we will go back to genesis 22.
[1:01:20] there are just few things i want to show
[1:01:21] you uh uh
[1:01:23] just for an hesitation tonight
[1:01:25] and then uh we will we will pray and go
[1:01:27] home
[1:01:29] just to be able to
[1:01:31] uh
[1:01:32] wake up your spiritual appetite for this
[1:01:34] weekend
[1:01:36] so we see here that i mean but daily
[1:01:39] preach all through this so we will not
[1:01:41] uh go over words here
[1:01:43] but uh we realize one thing i would want
[1:01:46] you to
[1:01:47] also remember in your mind that god
[1:01:49] never wanted
[1:01:50] isaac
[1:01:52] what god wanted was abraham
[1:01:58] god never wanted isaac
[1:02:02] god wanted abraham
[1:02:04] and it's a principle
[1:02:08] when
[1:02:10] when
[1:02:11] your loved one is going through
[1:02:13] something
[1:02:15] take for example that is a parent and
[1:02:17] children relationship
[1:02:18] if the children is going through
[1:02:20] something
[1:02:22] that
[1:02:23] has wake up something in you
[1:02:27] i'm afraid they will do something wrong
[1:02:31] god allowed there to deal with their
[1:02:33] fear in you
[1:02:39] whether it's your wife or whether it's
[1:02:41] your husband
[1:02:44] when it gets to the place where
[1:02:47] is is uh is is concerning to you and you
[1:02:51] and you be coming
[1:02:52] oh god
[1:02:53] lord i pray you help them lord
[1:02:56] i pray you help them it's not about that
[1:02:58] person
[1:03:00] it's about you
[1:03:05] praise the lord
[1:03:06] i mean it's not your appealing to god
[1:03:09] constantly appealing that would make god
[1:03:11] to do what he want to do he already know
[1:03:13] what he wants to do
[1:03:15] he created a scene
[1:03:21] to help you to see an area in your life
[1:03:28] i believe that was one of the reason why
[1:03:30] abraham never took his wife because it
[1:03:32] was not about sarah
[1:03:35] he came to the revelation that it was
[1:03:37] about him
[1:03:42] and i believe also that's the reason why
[1:03:45] the scripture intentionally used this
[1:03:47] word god did tempt abraham
[1:03:51] that that is the attracting word that
[1:03:54] shows that it was about abraham
[1:03:59] and it was not about isaac
[1:04:06] praise the lord
[1:04:11] are we together
[1:04:13] and we and we read here
[1:04:16] that uh uh abraham verse three abraham
[1:04:20] arose early in the morning and saw that
[1:04:22] his eyes and he took uh two of his
[1:04:26] younger men with him and isaac his son
[1:04:29] and
[1:04:31] cleave the wolf for the burnt orphan and
[1:04:33] rose up in the wind now verse 4
[1:04:37] will envelop
[1:04:39] our three days
[1:04:42] and three nights
[1:04:47] praise the lord
[1:04:52] now the reason why the reason why
[1:04:57] the three days and three night
[1:05:00] emphasis is net is not greatly fixed to
[1:05:04] this is because the three days
[1:05:07] comes before the sacrifice
[1:05:12] so it looks like it's not is not seen
[1:05:17] but it's a design of the holy spirit
[1:05:21] because in god's mind
[1:05:24] the works were finished from the
[1:05:25] foundation of the word
[1:05:31] are we together
[1:05:33] so
[1:05:35] then on the third day abraham lifted his
[1:05:37] eyes
[1:05:38] and saw the place far off
[1:05:43] and then he said to the young man about
[1:05:45] here
[1:05:46] with the eyes and eye and the leg would
[1:05:48] go
[1:05:50] yeah i'm there to worship
[1:05:51] and we will come again
[1:05:55] praise the lord
[1:05:58] we will come again
[1:05:59] now so if you if you look at that you
[1:06:02] will realize the other
[1:06:05] abraham made a promise
[1:06:07] and then what what what i want to show
[1:06:09] you here
[1:06:11] tonight
[1:06:13] is that it looks like i will have to
[1:06:15] open
[1:06:16] mine uh
[1:06:18] my bible here to help myself out
[1:06:21] i'll open my my notes here
[1:06:24] now what i want to show you tonight is
[1:06:26] is that
[1:06:31] right here in genesis 22
[1:06:38] if you look closely you will see that
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:42] uh
[1:06:48] praise the lord
[1:06:56] look at verse 9 let's look at verse 9.
[1:07:06] verse 8 abraham said
[1:07:08] my son god will provide himself a lamb
[1:07:11] for a burnt offering so they went both
[1:07:14] of them together
[1:07:16] and he came to the place
[1:07:18] which god had tore him off
[1:07:21] and abraham built an altar there and
[1:07:24] laid
[1:07:25] the wood in order
[1:07:27] and bound isaac
[1:07:29] his son
[1:07:30] and lay him on the altar upon the wood
[1:07:37] that was the last time the bible
[1:07:41] mention isaac
[1:07:45] bound him and lay him on the wood
[1:07:49] that was the last time the bible
[1:07:51] mentioned isaac in this story
[1:07:54] sure
[1:07:57] which is a perfect type of calvary
[1:08:04] praise the lord
[1:08:09] and uh
[1:08:15] and then from right there
[1:08:17] uh uh you know
[1:08:19] isaac is bound he's on the wall and
[1:08:23] and abraham stretched for his hand and
[1:08:25] took the knife and then the angel
[1:08:27] dealing with abraham and all of that
[1:08:32] praise the lord
[1:08:37] are we together
[1:08:41] now verse 19
[1:08:45] will also tell us here i mentioned that
[1:08:48] on sunday so abraham returned
[1:08:51] his young men
[1:08:53] i thought abraham said i and the lead
[1:08:55] will go and return
[1:08:57] but the bible says abraham return
[1:09:02] without mentioning isaac
[1:09:04] sure
[1:09:06] now that does not mean that abraham and
[1:09:09] isaac did not come back
[1:09:12] but the holy spirit is intentionally
[1:09:15] removing isaac
[1:09:17] out of the
[1:09:18] text because that's how it's going to
[1:09:22] play in the fulfillment this is just a
[1:09:24] type
[1:09:31] praise the lord
[1:09:33] because after jesus paid the price on
[1:09:37] calvary
[1:09:39] to god his work was finished
[1:09:42] he no longer had a public ministry
[1:09:48] jesus never went to the sahendra's
[1:09:50] council he never went to the synagogues
[1:09:52] to preach he never went to the temple to
[1:09:54] pray
[1:09:55] because he did not had a public ministry
[1:10:02] the only ones he dared was
[1:10:04] the believers the sins
[1:10:07] am i right
[1:10:10] so here
[1:10:11] the holy spirit is intentionally moving
[1:10:14] isaac out of the text because
[1:10:18] the picture will be right
[1:10:22] in the fulfillment
[1:10:27] praise the lord
[1:10:29] now the next time
[1:10:31] isaac will be mentioned
[1:10:34] will be genesis 24.
[1:10:39] praise the lord genesis 24 verse 4.
[1:10:45] verse 3 abraham speaking i will make
[1:10:48] this word
[1:10:50] by the law thy thy god
[1:10:53] by the lord the god of heaven and the
[1:10:55] god of the earth that thou shalt not
[1:10:58] take a wife unto my son
[1:11:00] of the daughters of the canaanite among
[1:11:02] whom adword
[1:11:05] but thou shalt go on to my country
[1:11:08] and
[1:11:10] to my kindred to take a wife onto my son
[1:11:14] isaac
[1:11:15] now isaac is mentioned here
[1:11:19] but his person is not there
[1:11:25] praise the lord
[1:11:27] another thing about this chapter 24 that
[1:11:30] is also beautiful
[1:11:32] is that the bible says when abraham
[1:11:35] verse 1
[1:11:36] was worth striking in age the lord has
[1:11:39] blessed abraham with all things and
[1:11:41] abraham said unto his other seven of his
[1:11:46] house the rule left over all that he had
[1:11:50] put
[1:11:51] i pray thee the hand honor my time you
[1:11:55] will realize
[1:11:56] that
[1:11:58] this seven name is not mentioned
[1:12:01] all through the text
[1:12:06] praise the lord
[1:12:10] there is one scriptural reason why we
[1:12:12] say it's elaiza
[1:12:15] there was one scriptural reason why
[1:12:17] brother branham said it was eliezer you
[1:12:19] will not find eliezer or through the
[1:12:22] text
[1:12:28] praise the lord
[1:12:30] the reason why is proving that it's
[1:12:32] elijah is chapter 15.
[1:12:37] when abraham was telling god that one of
[1:12:41] my house one of my seven that was born
[1:12:43] in my house
[1:12:44] for him to be a hearse for me eliezer
[1:12:47] that's when the name was mentioned
[1:12:50] but remember we have just read in
[1:12:55] john chapter 16 when he
[1:12:57] the holy ghost
[1:13:00] will come
[1:13:02] amen he will not speak of himself
[1:13:12] he will not speak of himself
[1:13:16] and go check it study it the name
[1:13:18] eliezer means comforter
[1:13:32] here
[1:13:33] the father
[1:13:35] is now instructing his seven
[1:13:38] his faithful seven
[1:13:40] to go and get a bribe
[1:13:44] so it has been the holy ghost in every
[1:13:46] age that's been looking for the bride
[1:13:53] the holy ghost in every age has been
[1:13:55] using men
[1:13:58] to look for the bride
[1:14:01] praise the lord
[1:14:03] and you see where the devil gets the
[1:14:05] people makes up is that the the the the
[1:14:09] the they see they identify the fall in
[1:14:12] love with the man and then they leave
[1:14:14] the working of the holy ghost
[1:14:19] he will not speak of himself
[1:14:23] that's the reason why there's no true
[1:14:25] messenger that will come and say i'm the
[1:14:27] messenger
[1:14:30] no he will come fulfilling what the word
[1:14:33] says
[1:14:34] and the people that would believe that
[1:14:36] word will identify him with that promise
[1:14:47] because when he the holy ghost is come
[1:14:50] he will do everything that i've
[1:14:52] commanded him to do but he will now
[1:14:54] speak of himself
[1:15:01] praise the lord
[1:15:02] so
[1:15:03] year the father is mentioned the next
[1:15:05] time
[1:15:09] isaac will be mentioned
[1:15:11] will be
[1:15:12] when he sees rebecca
[1:15:18] or when rebecca sees him in the field
[1:15:20] sure
[1:15:24] that's the next time he will be
[1:15:27] mentioned
[1:15:29] in the text
[1:15:33] praise the lord
[1:15:39] so you see that uh
[1:15:41] i was i was just i was fellowshipping
[1:15:43] with my friend to the house and
[1:15:45] we were
[1:15:46] we were talking about this you know he's
[1:15:49] he says i really didn't see it i said
[1:15:51] well
[1:15:52] that was just something that attracted
[1:15:54] me to it
[1:15:55] and then i started looking at it very
[1:15:57] closely
[1:15:59] you know because
[1:16:00] uh just like brother branham said you
[1:16:03] know
[1:16:04] is
[1:16:05] it's all playing out there it's it's
[1:16:07] it's written in the word
[1:16:11] praise the lord
[1:16:15] that's how
[1:16:16] uh a scriptural
[1:16:18] uh uh
[1:16:22] a scriptural messenger is identified is
[1:16:25] by the scripture
[1:16:28] praise the lord
[1:16:31] is by the scripture
[1:16:35] and then when you look in in
[1:16:37] uh in genesis
[1:16:40] 24 also
[1:16:42] the father
[1:16:43] called
[1:16:44] his seven eliezer
[1:16:47] and when you read
[1:16:53] you start to read you realize right from
[1:16:56] the beginning
[1:16:58] the bible talks about
[1:17:02] uh
[1:17:09] how
[1:17:10] when
[1:17:13] this 7 was about to take
[1:17:16] his trip
[1:17:20] he took candles
[1:17:22] and the bible says he took
[1:17:24] ten candles
[1:17:27] praise the lord
[1:17:32] and it looks like
[1:17:34] when you read true it looks like
[1:17:38] eliza went on this joining asset solo
[1:17:42] mission with which made one man mission
[1:17:47] but if you look closely in a text
[1:17:51] he was accompanied by men
[1:17:57] but yet
[1:18:00] the holy spirit designed it that the
[1:18:02] bible never says abraham
[1:18:05] called
[1:18:06] eliza and his men
[1:18:10] no the commission was given to eliezer
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:17] the commission was given to him
[1:18:21] but yet
[1:18:24] he took faithful men
[1:18:29] that helped him alone to go and get this
[1:18:32] bride
[1:18:34] praise the lord
[1:18:37] two times the bible mentioned it
[1:18:40] let me see if i can find it
[1:18:49] so you see
[1:18:53] a commission like paul says over there
[1:18:56] how
[1:18:58] he was jealous over the church
[1:19:02] with godly jealousy
[1:19:06] and he was desiring to expose the church
[1:19:08] to christ as a chess virgin
[1:19:13] that was a commission that was given to
[1:19:16] to the holy ghost
[1:19:20] but yet he choose men
[1:19:23] throughout the ages
[1:19:25] and with every messenger that came there
[1:19:28] were faithful men
[1:19:30] that stood with him
[1:19:32] to be able to carry out
[1:19:35] the promise
[1:19:38] praise the lord
[1:19:52] are we together
[1:20:01] verse 32
[1:20:14] and the man came into the house
[1:20:17] and then gathered his candles
[1:20:19] and gave straw and
[1:20:21] providence for the camel
[1:20:23] and water
[1:20:24] to wash his feet and the man's feet that
[1:20:28] were with him
[1:20:36] verse 59.
[1:20:49] and they send away rebecca their sister
[1:20:52] and her nurse
[1:20:54] and abraham seven and his men
[1:21:00] so i mean daily in the church ages
[1:21:02] brother brennan made emphasis of
[1:21:04] faithful man
[1:21:06] he gave an example of someone like
[1:21:08] timothy that's too faithfully with
[1:21:11] paul
[1:21:12] and uh you know men does too faithfully
[1:21:15] and that uh uh example like elisha he
[1:21:19] was faithful is to uh with the message
[1:21:22] of elijah and and all of that he talks
[1:21:25] about how faithful man will take this
[1:21:27] word
[1:21:29] praise the lord
[1:21:30] and carry it to the coming of the lord
[1:21:32] now so you see there is the the the the
[1:21:36] commission the message is given to the
[1:21:38] messenger
[1:21:40] but you see along the way the message
[1:21:42] also gather faithful men right
[1:21:46] to be able to fulfill the commission so
[1:21:48] you see the holy spirit design it in a
[1:21:51] way
[1:21:52] that when we look into the text of the
[1:21:54] scripture there is no way we can argue
[1:21:57] with what god has been doing throughout
[1:21:59] all the ages
[1:22:04] praise the lord
[1:22:07] you see that's the reason why
[1:22:09] the it has to move from a one-man
[1:22:12] ministry to a body ministry
[1:22:19] amen god will always bring that man as a
[1:22:22] wave shift before the people
[1:22:27] but then it will become above the
[1:22:29] ministry because that's the reason why
[1:22:31] uh the apostle paul taught us about the
[1:22:34] fightful ministry
[1:22:37] that is that is there
[1:22:39] there's another thing that was on my
[1:22:40] mind also to share with you
[1:22:43] uh but i will keep it for another day
[1:22:47] praise the lord
[1:22:49] and i will keep it for another day
[1:22:50] because the reason why i got into this
[1:22:53] is that
[1:22:55] we have to realize just like we spoke
[1:22:57] last week what
[1:22:59] manner of love that the father
[1:23:02] have bestowed upon us
[1:23:04] that we can be called the children of
[1:23:06] god and john said it does not yet appear
[1:23:10] what we shall be
[1:23:12] but when we see him
[1:23:16] we shall be like him
[1:23:19] praise the lord
[1:23:21] the the the the emphasis emphasis there
[1:23:24] is that there's a church word that is
[1:23:26] waiting to see him after the
[1:23:28] resurrection
[1:23:29] right but there is an elected people
[1:23:33] that are longing to see him every day of
[1:23:35] their lives
[1:23:40] because that's the thing that changed us
[1:23:46] praise the lord
[1:23:49] that's the thing that changed us to be
[1:23:51] like him is not our completion is not
[1:23:54] the physical side but to be like him
[1:23:57] christ the word
[1:24:04] praise the lord
[1:24:06] so that's the way we see him like you
[1:24:09] look in abraham's
[1:24:10] uh uh joining
[1:24:13] where brennan makes uh you know uh
[1:24:16] expression like that in
[1:24:18] we have heard and now we see he says
[1:24:21] there were
[1:24:23] different ways that god did appear to
[1:24:26] abraham
[1:24:29] remember when he appeared
[1:24:32] when we see him
[1:24:35] every time he appears
[1:24:38] and that's the same thing every time he
[1:24:41] appears in the scripture every time
[1:24:44] the holy spirit can be able to show
[1:24:46] christ in the scripture
[1:24:48] that's the thing that changed us
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:56] praise the lord
[1:25:00] i mean it's not it's not to be able to
[1:25:03] look for you know the uh uh
[1:25:06] amazing things in the scripture just to
[1:25:09] blow your mind just keep your mind
[1:25:11] together if your mind is blown i mean
[1:25:13] you might not carry out that word right
[1:25:16] right your mind is blown you'll be
[1:25:18] foolish
[1:25:20] oh wow oh wow
[1:25:22] you know we get but is to be able to
[1:25:25] appreciate him
[1:25:27] you see him it brings it home
[1:25:33] it brings it home
[1:25:38] because that is god's secret
[1:25:41] for the changing of our body
[1:25:49] that is his secret
[1:25:52] that is the thing that overcomes the
[1:25:54] word
[1:25:56] right
[1:25:59] praise the lord
[1:26:02] you have to remember
[1:26:04] it's not what we overcome it's how
[1:26:08] to overcome
[1:26:12] it's now what is how
[1:26:21] praise the lord
[1:26:22] because the more
[1:26:25] he's appearing in the scripture and the
[1:26:27] more he's appearing in your daily life
[1:26:30] you can be able to recognize christ in
[1:26:33] the things that is happening around you
[1:26:37] the more victory it gives you
[1:26:43] praise the lord the more i vindicate his
[1:26:45] presence around you
[1:26:50] more you increase your trust your faith
[1:26:52] in him because you can see it
[1:26:57] lord i know that was i know i know that
[1:26:59] that was you
[1:27:01] i just love it when you do it it makes
[1:27:04] it more real to you
[1:27:06] it's not a mental thing
[1:27:08] it's not it's a reality you are living
[1:27:10] with it
[1:27:11] i don't have to convince you i don't
[1:27:14] have to convince you
[1:27:17] praise the lord
[1:27:19] i don't have to convince you
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:27] i mean it would be it would be crazy for
[1:27:29] the person to live and you know to to
[1:27:31] try to convince everybody around them
[1:27:33] that they love their wife
[1:27:38] praise the lord sure amen
[1:27:41] but she's not complaining because we are
[1:27:43] enjoying it
[1:27:46] praise the lord i mean she's now if
[1:27:48] she's running out of the house it's
[1:27:49] obvious everybody knows there is fire in
[1:27:51] the house
[1:28:02] that is the thing
[1:28:04] that's that's where john emphasis was
[1:28:08] just listening to a message for you that
[1:28:10] brother bram says when he came out of
[1:28:11] the island of patmos he was so consumed
[1:28:14] by the things that he saw
[1:28:16] the way jesus will work
[1:28:18] in his future church if the people can
[1:28:21] only see it
[1:28:33] this is little children your faith
[1:28:35] overcome
[1:28:36] the word
[1:28:40] is to be able to see him
[1:28:43] right
[1:28:46] and that's the thing the devil
[1:28:48] fights against
[1:28:52] he tries to blur our vision
[1:28:56] if we can see the pastor if we can see
[1:28:58] the prophet if we can see this other
[1:29:00] ministry there and we can see that other
[1:29:02] brother and see this other person
[1:29:07] he's trying to blur our vision
[1:29:12] because the scripture talks about the
[1:29:14] perfect liberty
[1:29:18] looking into the perfect liberty
[1:29:25] the things we look at changes our life
[1:29:38] the lord
[1:29:42] it's it's just it's right there
[1:29:48] it's right there it's right there it's
[1:29:51] lying right there in the word
[1:30:02] praise lord
[1:30:06] looking
[1:30:07] into the perfect liberty we have time to
[1:30:09] look at that also
[1:30:10] how
[1:30:12] how that
[1:30:14] you know god designed it that way
[1:30:18] just like the brazing serpent
[1:30:21] just look
[1:30:24] don't fight against the serpent
[1:30:28] don't be afraid of the abide just look
[1:30:31] as you keep your eyes they will keep
[1:30:32] going back
[1:30:34] if you keep looking at them they keep
[1:30:36] coming closely
[1:30:43] praise the lord
[1:30:45] it just don't only keep them away
[1:30:48] but they also heal you of their bite
[1:30:57] praise the lord
[1:30:59] what the devil would do is to is to
[1:31:02] remind you of the symptoms
[1:31:06] that you are feeling and as long as your
[1:31:08] mind is on the symptoms your mind will
[1:31:10] be on the animal that bites you
[1:31:14] because you are thinking about how it
[1:31:16] hurts
[1:31:18] how i fed it
[1:31:20] is a connection
[1:31:26] the word
[1:31:27] the word of god
[1:31:29] will work for you when you can see it
[1:31:37] since this is homegoing time
[1:31:43] the rapture is right around us
[1:31:48] it's right around us
[1:31:53] it's right around us
[1:31:57] we have to make this world work for us
[1:32:04] and as much as we appreciate the great
[1:32:07] things that god has done in our
[1:32:09] generation
[1:32:12] word
[1:32:12] want to be made flesh in you
[1:32:15] god want to bring you to a personal
[1:32:17] experience
[1:32:22] a personal experience
[1:32:26] where you can be able to identify
[1:32:28] yourself in scripture
[1:32:30] right
[1:32:32] you can say god has put a garment of
[1:32:35] praise on me because i don't have the
[1:32:37] spirit of heaviness
[1:32:43] praise the lord
[1:32:45] if you feed
[1:32:46] i mean depressed that's all you need
[1:32:49] just go find a government of praise
[1:32:51] it's going to work it works very well
[1:32:54] [Laughter]
[1:32:57] just find a garment of praise
[1:33:05] i mean we can get we can get excited we
[1:33:08] can you know we can bring things out of
[1:33:10] the scripture i mean every time we come
[1:33:13] to the house of god i mean when we come
[1:33:16] in and our hearts is ready i mean god
[1:33:18] will speak to us
[1:33:20] we can preach amazing message but if it
[1:33:23] is just for an excitement
[1:33:26] then we are missing the mark
[1:33:33] but you see when the people comes
[1:33:36] because they want to see him
[1:33:39] in that expectation of seeing god
[1:33:42] i want to see him i want him to speak to
[1:33:44] me
[1:33:45] i mean
[1:33:47] a five-minute message can break a
[1:33:50] revival year
[1:33:53] because everybody will go home with an
[1:33:56] effect of the world on their heart
[1:34:00] thank you lord thank you what i was
[1:34:02] looking for god really spoke to me
[1:34:03] tonight
[1:34:09] praise the lord
[1:34:14] but you see if you can only see god
[1:34:16] speaking to somebody and now speaking to
[1:34:17] you then you know exactly what is
[1:34:19] happening
[1:34:23] you are listening to the evangelist that
[1:34:24] is in the room
[1:34:28] praise the lord
[1:34:33] if nothing good was said in the in the
[1:34:37] message
[1:34:39] if the preacher just stood there and he
[1:34:41] make you sleepy the problem is not the
[1:34:44] preacher you have the problem
[1:34:53] you have the problem
[1:35:01] because even if the preacher don't have
[1:35:03] his you know his message quotes together
[1:35:06] and he can sing his thought together
[1:35:08] only the reading of the scripture
[1:35:11] that scripture he read
[1:35:16] that was beautiful
[1:35:18] yes sir
[1:35:26] i mean that's that's the place
[1:35:29] that uh
[1:35:32] we are coming to that's the place where
[1:35:33] the bride is
[1:35:35] right
[1:35:38] that's the place where the bride is
[1:35:40] that's the place where
[1:35:42] the message
[1:35:44] has turned from the messenger
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:49] like the prophecy the prophecy
[1:35:53] has turned from the messenger to the
[1:35:54] prophet or to the message
[1:35:57] or the attraction that's the way he said
[1:35:59] it the attraction is no longer on the
[1:36:02] man but to the message because the
[1:36:04] message is the releasing of christ
[1:36:09] is the releasing of christ
[1:36:12] all that denominational did all through
[1:36:15] the ages were to bound christ
[1:36:18] keep christ from the people
[1:36:20] and just give them dogmas creeds you
[1:36:23] know if they can form to certain things
[1:36:28] without the experience of christ
[1:36:31] the message has come to release christ
[1:36:37] to take christ from the pages of the
[1:36:39] bible
[1:36:48] praise the lord
[1:36:52] that's what we are looking forward to
[1:36:54] that's there's uh that's that's what we
[1:36:56] are putting our energy behind
[1:36:58] uh uh you know that that that christ
[1:37:01] will be released among the people
[1:37:03] right
[1:37:04] when that happened the work becomes easy
[1:37:06] for the pastor
[1:37:11] praise the lord
[1:37:13] because the people have the word they
[1:37:15] know how to go to the world to address
[1:37:16] their needs sure
[1:37:18] i mean all the ones you just just said
[1:37:20] and where is it in the world
[1:37:23] just tell them
[1:37:24] i'm dealing with this what we say in the
[1:37:26] scripture where did the prophet say that
[1:37:30] and as if you can give it to them i mean
[1:37:32] they can walk the devil with that thing
[1:37:37] they will just walk the devil
[1:37:40] yeah okay yeah okay thank you pastor god
[1:37:42] bless you
[1:37:45] praise the lord
[1:37:52] will the lord bless you tonight
[1:37:55] the lord bless you tonight
[1:37:58] thank you for coming
[1:38:00] and uh
[1:38:02] i just wanted to spend this time with
[1:38:04] you in and remind you of these things
[1:38:07] uh
[1:38:08] that uh
[1:38:10] they uh
[1:38:13] they are very interesting things very
[1:38:15] very interesting things are happening i
[1:38:18] mean even even in this local assembly
[1:38:20] they are very interesting things that
[1:38:21] are happening
[1:38:23] you see
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:28] the devil want to take advantage of
[1:38:30] setting things
[1:38:32] you know and and uh
[1:38:35] you know and
[1:38:36] we keeping our eyes on those things
[1:38:39] and trusting that the lord will
[1:38:41] will just we just help us praise the
[1:38:44] lord
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:47] let's let's not let's not slack
[1:38:51] praise the lord let's not slack i was
[1:38:53] listening to brother branham a man
[1:38:55] running away from the presence of the
[1:38:57] lord everything in this life is a
[1:38:58] responsibility
[1:39:02] if you leave your house and drive here
[1:39:05] you are responsible for what happened in
[1:39:07] this building
[1:39:12] praise the lord
[1:39:13] the way we order our life
[1:39:16] we are responsible for it
[1:39:23] he says to everything there is a
[1:39:25] responsibility
[1:39:27] right
[1:39:29] and sometimes not seeing
[1:39:34] how much we are responsible
[1:39:36] that's why sometimes we become
[1:39:38] negligent sure
[1:39:42] praise the lord
[1:39:47] you don't we don't realize how much the
[1:39:50] service tonight depended on your
[1:39:52] presence
[1:39:56] when we got down to pray
[1:39:58] i mean the the service was depending on
[1:40:02] your prayer
[1:40:03] so you just don't sit there and and blow
[1:40:06] your mind away and go shopping
[1:40:19] we have a
[1:40:20] responsibility and our responsibility is
[1:40:23] to bring christ in our midst
[1:40:26] it's our responsibility each and every
[1:40:29] one of us are responsible for that yes
[1:40:32] absolutely
[1:40:37] that's how we that's why we have to keep
[1:40:39] the right attitude we have to come pray
[1:40:41] up
[1:40:42] if you can't make it a service on time
[1:40:44] to pray stop praying when you are coming
[1:40:50] praise the lord don't spend all the time
[1:40:52] fussing and then when you get right to
[1:40:53] the church door
[1:40:54] then uh then i mean you will just stay
[1:40:57] in that moon you keep fussing with
[1:40:59] yourself you keep blaming yourself you
[1:41:01] keep you know uh uh
[1:41:05] or the devil knows how to use that
[1:41:16] praise the lord i'm i'm of a very strong
[1:41:19] conviction that the lord want to do
[1:41:21] great things in our mess
[1:41:25] you know god only trusts people that are
[1:41:27] responsible
[1:41:31] if you are not responsible he can give
[1:41:33] you
[1:41:34] spiritual things
[1:41:44] the prophet god said long prayers should
[1:41:46] be done to our house
[1:41:48] yes
[1:41:49] you know sometimes people will think you
[1:41:51] know prayer meeting legends let's just
[1:41:53] rock the whole night with prayer meeting
[1:41:57] there are times for that
[1:42:01] there are times for that
[1:42:03] but when we come like this on wednesday
[1:42:05] night you know uh and we call it a
[1:42:08] prayer service is is just to be able to
[1:42:11] you know just gather ourselves believing
[1:42:13] that we are praying home
[1:42:15] believing that we are remembering the
[1:42:17] church home and then when we come that
[1:42:19] few minutes we just come to just put a
[1:42:21] flame on it and let it bless
[1:42:27] it's not to be uh you know dragging you
[1:42:29] down and and let's pray let's pray let's
[1:42:31] pray let's pray no sleeping let's pray
[1:42:33] let's pray
[1:42:35] like we are in our auction center
[1:42:44] you lord the lord tonight
[1:42:47] praise the lord i believe it was a
[1:42:49] wonderful service on on sunday
[1:42:52] the last two services has been
[1:42:54] great uh he's been
[1:42:57] giving me some time to
[1:42:59] to rest also and and some time to study
[1:43:03] there was there was a talk that kind of
[1:43:05] a breakup for my heart and i'm trusting
[1:43:07] that law will help us when we bring it
[1:43:09] this scripture has always puzzled me
[1:43:12] i've always thought about it what was
[1:43:14] behind it but i think the lord helped me
[1:43:16] to see a little bit now out of it
[1:43:18] you know when elisha
[1:43:20] cried to elijah my father
[1:43:22] my father
[1:43:25] the houseman of israel
[1:43:28] the chariot of his israel and the
[1:43:30] houseman thereof
[1:43:31] so if the lord
[1:43:33] keep us and bless us who would like to
[1:43:35] talk on that
[1:43:36] you know would like to talk on how
[1:43:40] god uh
[1:43:41] make us powerhouse
[1:43:44] or talk on god's powerhouse for every
[1:43:47] age
[1:43:49] you know
[1:43:51] god's powerhouse and i believe that's
[1:43:53] what this bride is that's why the
[1:43:55] prophet of god said every every er all
[1:43:58] the devil weapon is against this bride
[1:44:01] that's right
[1:44:02] because she's the powerhouse
[1:44:06] she is the powerhouse
[1:44:09] so if the lord bless us pray for me i'll
[1:44:12] be praying for you but let's come this
