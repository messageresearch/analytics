morning before we go into what we want to we want to do this is almost 11 46 so uh we are starting a little bit late I wish I had two two services to preach today but I try to put everything you want amen praise the Lord if I'm a federal preacher today then you just have to send for the Moses amen but uh you know I just I just want to thank the Lord and you know we were we were speaking on Wednesday night talking about uh all that the Lord have said we will do we know that we cannot do or that the Lord have said we have to rely on his grace amen trying to talk about appreciating the grace of God and uh uh uh I wanted to do something this morning and uh and I'm still going to trust the Lord to see if uh if we would do that but just before we do that first brother Dan reminded me and uh uh our brother Ben uh given an announcement uh yeah last week for the for the I think Thanksgiving and open house at the Ali's place I think that's that's brother Dan and his family opening their home and uh they have not had the privilege to invite the sins to their home since they moved there so they choose to do that on Thanksgiving and because I was curious to know whether it was a church Thanksgiving or the home Thanksgiving so they said home Thanksgiving so uh that was that was the correction from there so but then reminding me to do that and uh we we want to thank the Lord the Lord has been good to us us amen as a people he has been good to us as a church and uh but this was something that I that I observed and I taught a wise you know that that I should learn from it and uh uh I was going away and we were we were helping the situation and preaching some services and and one night I was up what I was studying and I was praying and and the thought just hit me and because I was thinking about a situation I was thinking that you know how how did the people got in the situation that they got themselves in and then I remember some things that brother Braham said in the church age book you know he was talking about the church in his struggle which of course the next morning when I was preaching I sharing with the church you know the church in his struggle you know to get away from the grip of catholism the grape of legalism and he has struggle to get away from legalizing they went far away from the grace of God now like like we said on Wednesday night brother Graham said we read it he says Grace was before the Lord he said Grace well even during the Lord and Grace was after the Lord praise the Lord so even during the time of the Lord during the time when the people are under this thing of of a bondage and and legalism from the church there is still Grace there now so what the church needs as us as God a little bit we will show you this morning will will deliver the people from there they need to follow the grace of God praise the Lord but what happened is that the people this is all we we are we are we are we are we we are not on a legal lesson we are so bound you know we are free and are in the sense of Freedom they go completely away from the grace of God and then this this starts to allow things that they will have never allowed in their life and and you see those things you cannot help but ask God to give you Grace that you learn from it so I think uh you know I would say is that God has blessed us as a church praise the Lord I mean this this local assembly he has blessed us as a church I was I will also say that uh he's blessing us in our growth uh the growth that I'm talking about is not Amiga church it's not a many member of you know people I'm talking about people growing in the Lord you know in a way they are dealing with things and uh you know the Lord is also blessing people in their jobs in their homes and uh and and and all of those things but you see what happens with the human because we uh uh you know uh creature of habit uh when when uh when when the law starts to bless us in this way pretty soon we start becoming Slack and we start turning away from the very thing that have brought us these blessings praise the lord we start attributing the blessings to our many hours that we work attributing the blessings to the new job that we got and the degree that we have just got just tell our you know our upgrade my degrading that and then pretty soon we start attributing the blessings of God to those things whether those things were there on that God will stay bless us praise the Lord amen whether those things were there or not God will stay bless us praise the Lord he's a good God Amen and then pretty soon just like I said the people you know we will soon start turning away you know from uh from uh from prayer meeting and uh you know and now now we we will not have time again even to be be to church on time you know we we come to Service as if to say the service have to wait for us instead of coming to wait on the service you know that's what brother Branham said he says that's the reason why gifts have gone from the church because the people don't come and wait you know they don't come and wait praise the lord we want God to wait on us when we have to be here waiting on the Lord and waiting and praying the service time is it's 10 o'clock the doors are open we're supposed to be in praying and and waiting on the service praise the Lord you see those those are just the simple principle that brings God's blessing praise the Lord is a simple principle I mean we don't have to be one in the engine yet and you know trying to uh chase people down and say so this other person is doing this and this other person is doing this no we don't have to look for the devil let's look for God we will find him because God is head and revealed in Simplicity if he's he then look for God you will find him stop looking for the devil because the devil is all over the place you want to see him you will see him he won't see Satan behind the puppet this morning you will see him praise the Lord amen so I mean that would just be uh my conscious advice to you as a church you know uh let's let's let's let's uh let's hold those things that were very valuable to us amen praise the Lord hallelujah let's hold those things God I mean the Lord has been good to us he has been very very good to us and uh uh you know it's it's also some of those things with with uh with children and parents you know we grow up like some of our young people you are blessed to have parents that always want to be in church and you and you come with them you come with them and then pretty soon you start becoming an adult you start you start working you get your apartment and all of that and uh you know uh I mean you you never knew how he has got in a car you never knew how the car was repaired you know you just had it and now pretty soon you get your card and and then you start using yours now for for an excuse or my car break then I can make it to church today all those things you are experiencing that they were experiencing it it's just that he was not making a kind of a noise that you are making now praise the Lord now I wanted to uh are you going to do my special I requested you're able to do it okay I wanted to do something uh uh in honor of you know the the the beginning of the Reformation I call it the first nail in the coffin when Martin Luther's two out and and and he was led by the Holy Spirit to write those 95 Theses and put it on the church door the All Saints Church that was the first nail that God puts in the devil coffin praise the Lord amen thou was the first snail and there's there's a whole lot that I have to to deal with this morning I'm just praying and hoping that the Lord will just be able to to you know uh uh you know compress me just help me praise the Lord and and if you can yeah you know because sometimes the church can just can just sweep the preacher out of his notes I know you can do that so if you can pull I might just run out of my notes so quickly and then but you see uh uh let me get ahead of myself tomorrow is Halloween amen and do you know that that was the very same day Luther put the thesis on the All Saints Church do you know that oh you are out for the treat I can promise you are for the tree if you didn't know that you are for the treat praise the Lord and my question when I was studying last night well yesterday I wrote something down here I said why didn't the religious word the word council of churches make a big celebration of the day of the Reformation why why because as as we will go into detail this morning Halloween is a 2.4 billion dollar hmm Market 2.4 billion dollar Market just last night when I got home I was listening to the news in South Korea a Halloween party killed 150 people at their Halloween party it's a 2.4 billion dollar is the 10 most popular party uh party activity in America next to uh New Year Eve in Super Bowl that's American statistics is the 10 biggest party night next to New Year Eve in Super Bowl it's a 2.4 million there are billion dollar market business praise the Lord and uh as we as we as we will look into some of the things that I would like to share with you this morning is to be able to show you how there are a lot of things in our culture that uh that are from Pagan's root they are from Pagan Road they are Roman traditions praise the Lord and believing Christians are falling in love with faith all or most of our days of the week months of the year strangely not that uh Exodus chapter 12 God told Israel that this month will be for you the beginning of months God was setting up a new calendar for them at the beginning of months and what what will be their beginning was to pass over what is the Christian beginning is a new birth amen because if you are not born again you have no right eating communion so the Passover is is is our new beginning this is our beginning of months now so we we see all of those things we we know that uh you know Christmas is a big Babylonian tradition amen all of his celebration uh you know Christmas Street in one of you even even Easter it's all from the goddess of Asian Babylon the biggest thing around around it is the other uh extra the the golden egg it is all in honor of the worship of the god of fatality you know how how do you how do you bring uh Easter rabbit and eggs together when did rabbit start laying eggs when the rabbits are laying eggs you know all of those things that are caught up in those things why why people that have gone to school in all of the degrees while Common Sense can just help them connect it that is a lie praise the Lord you know uh uh I mean even even our Valentine's Day also is a Roman feast uh that was that is attributed to to something else our childhood Tooth Fairy thing is an Asian Voodoo thing and all of that you know so and on and on and on and on we can go and uh and we will go because I have I have a whole lot to look into this morning just taking this to uh but as as I was thinking on this and just to realize that this big big uh celebration because uh uh we will look into the history of Halloween a little bit it has been a long a long tradition being a long tradition is is it came over newly to to America but it has been something that has been there in Europe for for a long time and it was even before before the Reformation but then I was thinking in my mind I was thinking in my mind I said I said God is just amazing praise the Lord I don't I don't I don't believe that it was a kind of a premeditated thing of Luther to say I'm going to wait for Halloween night I'm going to scare them with this thing praise the Lord I'm going to scare the church with this uh uh uh 195 theses but I believe that honor inspiration God did that God did that amen almighty God himself did that to be able to Port uh uh it was like a signature God own handwriting but just like I said I was I was thinking on that and I wrote this down so I I can forget while they're in the religious world the World Council of churches set up a big big celebration because this was net an outward movement of God praise the Lord even though after the Reformation took fired in the Church of England separated from the Catholic Church then they came out with the All Saints Day November 1st they make November 1st All Saints Day and November 2nd became All Souls day a big celebration of uh purgatory praise the Lord so you see we we have all of these things around us all of these things surround us and uh and and we are not free from them if if God don't help us because all of these things are in are in the root of the church you know what the church has always done is that they're wrong with the same thing they just dress it in a new clothes they just change the dressing of their Idol but it's just the same old Idol that the church has always run with now so I was thinking about that I said because I felt in my mind that this was not an outward move you remember when when when when Elijah came in and stood on my Campbell when Elijah challenge the prophets of barn praise the Lord and after they did all of their crying they did all of their movement and everything and everything and it was about an evening time the Bible says Elijah took 12 Stones he he gathered the songs together then he says oh Lord God May Israel know that I have done everything I call into your word and let this be that which we turn the heart of the people back to you that's the emphasis of the Elijah Ministry turning the heart back that's the reason why Malachi pick up the same thing now so but Elijah prayed our prayer and we know that fire came down from heaven and consumed the sacrifice praise the Lord but did the heart of the people turn back so you see the move was not an artwork you you were thinking that after that great demonstration with fire coming down from heaven consuming the sacrifice drying up the water and burning the altar you will think that the heart of the people everybody with that Jehovah is God and it will get back and start worshiping God the worship of bar increase the reason there is because the move of God is not a artwork show it's not an hour show it's not something that we put on the outward something that God is doing in the heart of his people it's something that God is doing in the heart of his people because if the heart of man is not converted he can put up whatever he want to put up wickedness lies in his heart even to his own heart he will keep weakness in his heart it was not an hour move the move of God is God moving the heart of man back to his word if God breaks your heart and say this thing you are doing is is not according to the word of God you better take that as the voice of God don't say I will thank you you don't think right you better take that as the mercy of God and do what the word of God says do what you know is right according to the word of God not according to your feelings um very good because after you have struggled against it you struggle and make your choice to do whatever you want to do there will be a time you will never hear that voice again there will be nothing to break your conscience you will do things and that's the thing that we are seeing around the message people doing things that don't move they are conscious when they don't have no ground on the word of God that back what they are doing Lord but there was a little boy that was born to a coal mine family and he saw how his dad struggled and struggle struggle with the workers you know working Union and you know all of that and Martin taught that when he grew up he don't want to be a coal miner he want to be a lawyer you want to go to school and learn to be a lawyer so he can he can be able to Define defend his daddy's business he went to school and God bless the intention that he had on his heart and then uh it was one night there came a storm that he have never been able to explain you have never really been able to explain it was it was a stormy night with tundles and stormy was he was in here uh I think in a college traveling from the dorm and and it just looks like that storm was just for him and he never thought that he would make it to the Dom and he cried out and say oh God if you save me and I become a monk and among those days where the people those were the people that were though those devoted Catholics that's how he cried out say oh God if you save me and he kept his word that was one of the first Supernatural things in his life so brother Brown talking about a voice talking to him in the word in in the bush as a as a little boy saying don't smoke Don't drink don't defy your body because I haven't worked for you it was it was not unique to blood branding every messenger of the age Paul had his own on the road of Damascus the man around him never heard the voice praise the Lord but they saw the effect because he was blind after he was looking for help for people to lead him so little how this strange experience and right after that the storm sees and that's how he changed his course of life from a lawyer to become a monk and because he was a man of of such a zeal impassion he was always aiming for the top so he started taking his uh his relationship with God in a very in a very you know because this this monk are just like the Catholic norms yeah they are the people you know uh they have different stages of none they have the ones that are the Black Veil those ones they they give themselves over to Thomas you know uh they would crawl on breaking grass battle they would I mean they would just give they would just reflect themselves thinking their their Desiring to to to please God amen and uh it's it's written that even ludov will wait for some of the coldest night of winter he go and sleep outside without a blanket because he's trying to deal with the sinful nature he's trying to cry to God God deliver me from lust or God Deliver Me From Evil thought a kind of a sinful desire or lust or all of that they will reflect themself and he was in there for a couple of years and and you know Eve he decided to travel to Rome we have talked about their story that's where he met these people you know they told him to read the book of habaku where he came across their structure the judge Chalet by faith and it started ringing in his head it started ringing in his head he started ringing in his head and when he got to Rome he was disappointed when he's the things that he saw there is this young man trying to live a life of devotion he got to Rome that should be the holy city he made a life of felt among the priests and the norms and all of those people he was so disappointed he decided to come back to Germany and God started dealing with him God started dealing with his heart kept bringing him in his mind until he took his Bible he decided to take the Holy Bible you know you have to realize you know all of that time they are instructed by the church you know to to follow what the church is don't follow what the Bible says follow what the church says and right there God started to deal with him he got in the Book of Romans the Holy Ghost just got a hold of him and started opening the pages of the scripture to his understanding something completely completely different from the church wow man Luther's God I mean he got he got a holy index nation in him a holy wrath was burning in his heart he said this thing is now going to be mine I'm going to write all of these things expose the church you're having people paying for their soul the scripture says this you are you are doing this the scripture says this you are you are saying sir the Bible says call no man father you I mean he wrote all of those things down praise the Lord I think brother Jordan I have a picture of the 95 thesis in one of my things there let's let's show there I'm getting ahead of myself so this this was this was how the 95 pieces were hmm he sent it over to the bishop of the church a copy and he took this copy and put it right on the All Saints Church door praise the Lord now you think about it those days people never have phone to to take picture quickly and say let me snatch it they were writing and this thing took place just in the time when the printing press was birthed you see how God moved right in a time when the printing press when they have just developed the printing press right there people started making copies before you realize it was widespread went over the borders of the Reformation started praise the Lord so why I was thinking on the air I taught on one of the songs that Ludo wrote Mighty Fortress praise the Lord so I was listening to uh I was listening to the song and I was listening to a piece that was playing on the on the violin so I said well okay I will call the uh joy and Becky and ask them to do a special so they would play there I told him to to tell sister Naomi and so they can play something on the violin of Mighty Fortress and then we will go into this the service December has already started so don't don't ask me when have I started I've already started yeah thank you foreign [Music] foreign thank you foreign thank you praise the Lord amen let's stand on our feet God bless you thank you amen I was thinking what was going through little mind when he was writing that song the artist our Mighty Fortress praise the Lord he knew his life was hanging in the balance he knew that uh this was not something that was going to be greatly embrace by the word and I was thinking brother Benham shared that in the seals he said every time I see you open he said the seal declared a war and the seal what is the seal he says Christ revealing his own word he said the seal is Christ he says whenever Christ is make known to the people and Christ is the word amen oh just like I said I'm kind of for cutting now let's let's take first Psalm here first psalmia chapter 28. first Samuel chapter 28. first Samuel chapter 28. foreign chapter 28 let's read from verse 6. I'm all spread about all over the place but the Lord will be my help amen first Samuel chapter 28 let's read from verse 6. and when Samuel inquired of the Lord and the Lord answer him net neither by dreams none by urine none by Prophets then said did I say Samia that's all sorry so something in the back of my head was telling me you that is you said something wrong and when Saul inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered him that neither by dreams known by urine known by the prophets now I caught myself because I was about to say because Samuel the prophet had died then you know in my in my subconscious I'm thinking you just said Samuel you know okay so we thank the Lord for that then said saw unto his servant seek me a woman they have a familiar spirit that I may go to her and inquired of her now God will not speak to him by dreams he's not getting the word from the Lord neither by visions you know and uh yeah now he's wanting to hear from God he's desperate so seek me in a woman that have a family my familiar spirit that I may go to her and inquire of her and his servant said unto him behold there is a woman that have a familiar Spirit at India praise the Lord are we together

I get mine uh the name of mine the title of my my message today and recognizing your dead in this message I want to read uh uh something here remember the vision of of last week that's who that's when the bride comes to preview of faith there came they came up the little bride lovely in the vision not thinking about it just sitting there watching outside and there there came the bride and I heard by the voice of me saying year is a preview of the Bride and she came by and I noticed her the way she was very lovely pretty young she was walking just the step as she could not a match amen now I I was thinking about this last week we we uh we show uh Israel India match the formation of Israel India match amen all the tribes uh free on each side Judah was the one that was leading from the East Israel always traveled to the by the way of the East and and then the rest of the tribes were in their position the North and the South and the west and they were in their position now as Israel traveled that way praise the Lord now if if you are on the ground and and the Ark of the Covenant is is in the midst you will not you will not see it like the way we show it like someone in the air you know then you will see that projection of the cross you know so uh uh as Israel make their travel you we have to realize that uh they they then that they were all taught to stay in their place of position praise the Lord they move the eye can see in the middle every try move they move they move they are not they are not joining and mixing and uh no they just move like that they have to stay in their place now I was thinking about that when I was thinking about the preview of the Bride uh what I'm what I'm reading to you here and uh uh to for us to see why uh the prophet had to cry in the vision stay in line amen why he had to cry in in Vision when he saw the bride getting out of step and as he married and narrated in a vision a masterpiece you were you would see that he he he says every you know every nation you know what they were dressed the way the word and and all of that but the important thing there is there that I wanted to bring out was uh for them to for him to cry out in a vision stay in line the importance of staying in the matching other the Martian order of the church is the word of God Amen the first step like this Ahmed was said left right the first step is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord that's the first step that's the first step of the Martian order repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin if you want to get in this match that is the way to start amen so you see uh just like how Israel had a martian order they had to keep the act of the Covenant in the middle the church also have a matching order amen that's why we can go on our own ideas we can do like other churches we want to do why can't we do this uh uh a birthday party do Halloween party and do all of these things and and and and you know and Bongo games for for money raising that's that's not if the church ever do that we are Marching out of order amen the Martian order of the church is the word of God you don't know your life in right until you are about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know how to throw a salute you don't go to theological school to know how to throw a salute when it comes to this Army you have to get down to that pool and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you get up then you know what is right and left praise the Lord if you were not just a dry sinner that needed to be a wet one amen come anytime dry Cena become a wet one and they come up with the same nature the same attitude but if you are dead and bear it you resurrect in the image of Christ are we together now so we look at this uh preview of The Bride he's talking here this bride coming she's looking pretty she's walking just in the step as she could emerge a woman how the world gracefully and little like that's the way she was walking coming to my left on this side and she went out of my sight then I turned to uh uh then he turned me to the right side and he showed me each church as they come up out of the ages oh how vocal and he says and the last one was this last day Church age which was led by a witch now that's the message I'm preaching the last this church led by the witch that's the title of my message praise the Lord I'm just trying to show you where I got my title from are we together are you okay with that should I change the title did it scare you praise the Lord I'm not going to change it as long as it's the word of God praise the Lord you can write something different on your note if you are afraid I'm going to leave it just like this amen are we together and the last day and this last one was the last day Church age which was led by a witch now we read that in first time here to show how the choice of the people when they rejected Samuel as a king and choose uh Samuel as a prophet and true sword as a king now the choice of the people have run into crisis right amen he could only follow the word of God as as much as he can now he has run into crisis he has to make an option praise the Lord Hallelujah and we see here because he will not listen to the prophet Samir he was always trying to appeal to the feelings of the people he won't listen to The Prophet Samia Samia told him God has rented your kingdom just the same way that you have rented my skirt because he told the Garment of Samuel the Lord has rejected you let's go to a first Samuel chapter 15. that's where this conversation was first Samuel chapter 15. first Samuel chapter 15. praise the Lord are we together first Samuel chapter 15 verse 22 Samuel said have the Lord has great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hacking then the facts of RAM for Rebellion for Rebellion to rebel against God's word is as the sin of witchcraft praise the Lord any form of rebellion against God's word it is just as the sin of Witchcraft in in Israel we'll get back that I will get back there like like I just said I have my hands full this morning you will realize like I said on Wednesday night when Moses came down there to to uh to Egypt and he throw his serpent down uh uh Pharaoh called his magician and says my boys can do the same they did the same thing the next plague that Moses brought out they did the same thing praise the Lord read your scripture the next plague that Moses brought out they did the same thing until the fourth plague praise the Lord amen and then you said they said to Pharaoh they said this one is the Finger of God they said this one is the finger praise the Lord now so this thing you will you will realize you go over to Exodus chapter 20. you will realize that Magic uh uh uh all of these uh mysterious things witchcraft things there were things that were very common in Egypt it was a kingdom where the people learned to exercise power and a way to show yourself Superior over another person you have to either bring out a trick or you got to be under some kind of a diva Nation right that was the way that the Egyptian knew how to to to subject their friends so when Moses came throwing his his uh stick down they told that oh you're not going to Humble Us by this you're not going to Humble Us by this praise the Lord are we together so it was just a common thing it's a common thing uh uh uh with the Egyptians and it's a common thing that I was looking at uh the the statistics last night to just uh uh see uh uh uh how you know all of these divination and Witchcraft thing it is in the society that we live today it it just it's just a way that people try to exercise being Superior over another person and it doesn't tell them they are well there is something that I know that you don't know praise the Lord amen and I mean it's just it's just all over the word back home travel uh just a few years come back uh you know uh uh you find all of the young boys out of out of University they are all going into the Masonic craft they are all trying to measure power they want to be at state level are we together and also all of these things are things that are coming to the to the Egyptians so you will realize that God told the children of Israel in Exodus chapter 20 as he was laying out the the Commandments he warned him and told them that there should be no witch that should live among you there was a reason for that to come to that as we as we travel so uh uh uh the the practice of uh of waiting Necromancer and all of that it was a kind of a capital punishment in Israel when a person was found doing that yeah because the reason is because the god of Israel was the supernatural God and he was among his people he was not a God that was far off amen that's that's the reason why we spoke about the shout what was war was creating a shout in the camp of Israel was the manifestation of God in a camp so God never wanted another mystical power to be among his people no he wanted his power because he knows there was nothing that he could not do thank you praise the Lord if the people need God they just need to call upon him he's a present help in time of trouble are we together or break a rock or stress Iraq or spring got some blood around the house all they needed to do was just call upon God so God frown against that from the games the people Consulting any Spirit beside the Holy Ghost are we together oh this is Halloween Eve we will have our party Halloween Eve before the witches can get out we going to put the blood on the door of the lane tail before the witches can get out [Applause] glory be to God God is God and the God we serve he's a living God he's not a dead God he lives among his people he said God that do yeah he said God that can speak he's the one that rocked on the world of Babylon he's a God that moves among his people he's a living God foreign he said God that can save he can deliver he said God that can heal praise the Lord that's the reason why even if it's a two egg we bring a prayer request if it's a stretching hair we bring a prayer request because we know our God can heal [Music] praise the Lord oh maybe you have not experienced God yet maybe you have not experienced him yet you have just known him in the name of a church know him as a religious God but I'm talking about a living God the that lives among his people praise the Lord so it was a capital punishment it was one thing that God detested among his people truth of the matter is those things already been among the Hebrews um they have been attracted to those things you you have to realize this is a these are people that they were not just there for five years all of these Quran and Dayton they were all born in Egypt Jacob only came with his sons and their wives all of these people they were born right there in Egypt they went to Egyptian schools praise the Lord the same way that our educational system now is trying to teach honor as children about sex and all of that that is the same way this polluted Egyptian system was they taught their magic in school they didn't know anything about God they taught them about the idols if this thing is happening to you go to the river and do that that was what they taught them thank you oh my God yep so a generation that grew up the Bible's talked about a pharaoh that knew not Joseph but there was a generation of Hebrews that never knew God they were all exposed to the Egyptian wisdom don't look at the story from one side because there is always two sides to a queen no matter how thin you slice it so it was not only a pharaoh that did not know Joseph there was a people that did not know their God they don't even knew the meaning of their names instead of looking into the Hebrew a dictionary they were defining their names by the Egyptian dictionary praise the Lord you talking about a generation around this message that I don't know nothing about a prophet all they have heard about is what preachers have said and now they are confused yeah yeah praise the lord we are not far away it's just about taking 14 hours from Jeffersonville praise the Lord how many times brother Brown came true he had a Minneapolis to God in Peterson In This Very City not too far from that from the whole from the airport uh uh the Ramada Inn they just broke it down I learned more of America about that place it was right in that hotel whatever Brahm got the vision about Joseph having a son by the name of Joseph he said when I was in Minneapolis by the Ramada Inn what are we talking about these were not things that were done with Dawn under behind the curtains over over one thousand plus tapes things have been said over and over and let me tell you this country has in order of his weakness a state has a good defense system praise the Lord amen a security system is very good even right in real right now when I was in Liberia the U.S government helped to track a a ship that was taking drugs to Liberia it was coming from South America going to Liberia to come back to South America and they arrested that shape in life and we helped them it was the U.S government it was the airbn praise the Lord so I just I just sat there to tell you that if brother Branham was deceiving the American public the FBI would have picked him up if there was something on of his sleeves praise the Lord right now the the the the the Latter Day Saints over in Utah they are having a case with the FBA because of all the the all the the the the ugly things that have been happening in the group that's not the only group of people even the Watchtower praise the Lord said I'm better than that sit straight are we together oh I'm just I'm just trying to wake you up a little bit that these are not calling device people we are not saying things to play on your mind amen it's not to get your mind is to get your soul thank you so the word of God can have a place to grow so Saul will not listen to Sam your advice you will not take instruction and because of that God will not speak to him anymore praise the Lord he will hear from the Lord anymore the uretry mean that was a representation of the word of God he will go to the Bible and you will read and nothing will make sense and nothing will make sense if the grace of God is helping you to read your Bible and something from the scripture can entrust you you better take that as the grace of God and may it make you humble may I humble you praise the Lord because there are people that are well educated in you wish that they can be able to pick up John 3 16 for it to make sense to them right because when you read that verse God so loved the whole world how can God love the whole world and and there were war in Ukraine die alone back for them that alone makes them to close their Bible and they don't want to read it anymore but you can take up that bible and read God so loved the word and live for your hands say thank you Lord Jesus I see your love in my heart some of us we think we are smart don't worry God will help you praise the Lord so we see we see this uh uh this this move of God and here Samuel now that he can hear from God he's not having no spiritual dreams he's he's in trouble he's now going to find another medium praise the Lord well he didn't know how Google those days so he couldn't search on Google he didn't have Facebook to know what Facebook is doing the most smartest thing he had in the land was a wage praise the Lord amen Hallelujah depending on what you are using Siri for she could be a wish for you said alibra won't say Siri is a witch don't go and say that foreign but you will realize that when you go to the scripture when Sam your king or saw when he took over to be king this was one of the things that he impressed the People by getting rid of all of the witches he wanted to gain the favor of the people and also to show that the people have not rejected Samuel they just wanted a king for an addition praise the Lord so he's saying that he sent a campaign to get rid of all of the people that was practicing which in the land get rid of them praise the Lord but now that he's in need glory be to God you know what this tell me it tells me that this was not Samuel I mean so our first time looking for the witch the reason that is because we always keep the Bible says where your heart is where your treasure will be we just keep it in a treasure place for the day of need you say Lord Deliver Me Lord deliver me but you are just keep in the day keeping it in now if this thing does not work go back to that praise the Lord amen Elisha had nothing to go back to because what he broke them and he breaks [Music] he had nothing to do to go back to because he burned it praise the Lord he killed his ox broke all his tools and burned it as an offering to God praise the Lord in the book of Acts that was what they did the bro they brought all the mystical books and everything over to the feet of the Apostles they say bring them and that's what the Holy Ghost would do to you amen he knows that you are still living in a word where you have all of this attractions to what he does he comes and burned the desire [Music] he burns the desire amen you look at it oh I used to love that thing but there's no desire to go back oh praise the Lord Hallelujah you love the Lord oh let's give the Lord a hand of Praise Hallelujah foreign thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen thank you Jesus now so we see you we see here that uh uh uh uh Samir is telling Saul for Rebellion is as a scene of witchcraft in stubbornness as a knowledge as iniquity in adultery now so Samir being the prophet he's identifying something in Saul already now if you look at this thing that Samir is saying to Saul you will not be surprised that he end up at the faith of which because Samia is saying the spirit of rebellion in you that make you no instruction I gave you you take praise the Lord is the spirit of witchcraft so I mean witchcraft just go to witchcraft praise the Lord amen yeah witchcraft just go to witchcraft is that spirit that led him to find a solution there are we are we together praise the Lord so we are taking that that's that's where we're taking our inspiration from to show how how how how how in their Vision brother Branham is now saying that this last this church she's led by a witch amen so the concept before we go into into looking at the concept there is the other because the last this church has left the word of God amen she's finding all the mediums to bring Miracles and bring healing and bring it she's looking for all sorts of things and they'll knock the people hell let them be slayed under the spirit under the spirit in the morning service in the evening to go right back to their clubs and the drink and the dance and they mess themselves around and come back to be slay the next service praise the Lord amen are we together now so you we we see all of these things we see all of these things that's the position of the age that we are living even with the with the society that we have that have kicked the Bible out of schools no no matter what no no wonder why they are resolving to all of these things praise the Lord I've just I was just following some news for you last night and and saw that you know uh I mean uh those people that in South Korea could lost their life 150 people it's even more than that yeah because there were a lot of casualty on the Halloween party praise the Lord now so as we as we look at this we were glory be to God let's let's let's go back a little bit here uh brother Jordan if you go back to my to my slice there let's let's look at this I'm I'm just I'm just all caught up here and there but I found my way out here soon let's go back let's look at the root of Halloween the roots of Halloween yeah it originated its origin Asian Brighton and Ireland it was aesthetic Festival saham God that's the god of the Dead just just shut this light off for me back there for the journey so he can help the people to see it was reserved the evening of October 31st follow November 1st praise the Lord amen and one time before we have uh we before we had our January 1st as the new year November 1st was a new year praise the Lord so you see the same connection of this of this uh of this Asian devilish feasts that was on on October 31st which was a New Year Eve is the Same Spirit that gets on December 31st you see the date has changed but the spirit is still there praise the Lord amen so you see yeah uh uh that's that's where the the you know these people that are giving are the the statistics of uh Halloween being the the the the the Ted uh popular party activity you know after uh uh New Year Eve the first and Super Bowl the second uh Halloween the place there as the third let's go to the next now now so this celt they were you know came from the drones that practice their practice believed they believe in reincarnation transmigration of Souls human can be reborn as animals you know that's a common thing that they believe and we see that that's the same thing that the Hindu believe praise the Lord amen now you see people will will believe all of these things and yet they will struggle with the serpent seed of Genesis chapter 3. they will believe that humans can die and become animals but yet they will struggle with the truth of Genesis chapter 3. that the serpent was not ereptide he was a man because God says from this day on your base on your belly you will go and thus you will eat the curse was the one that deformed him they won't struggle with reincarnation and all of that no I was I was I was somebody was kind of pushing the thought of the Netherlands and nephilims in Genesis 6 and nephilims and that's that's what I got that thought from us as this God is trying to prove you know that Angels came down and and became human beings and went out with the with the daughters of men and yet he struggled with the serpency so you see unless God gives you a revelation unless God open your heart to believe the truth you might even stop with just acknowledge because it don't stop there right praise the Lord let's let's go forward let's go forward these cells they engage you know in occult's arts and worship nature the Jews they were Priestly class the I believe in practices are uh show uh very same to the Hindus praise the Lord now I'm I'm having some confusion in my slides here but let's take October 1st so uh shhh October 1st uh it's the Asian fire Festival was set up to frighten away evil spirits The Souls of the Dead were said to visit their homes praise the Lord it was a festival acquired you know with the significance of ghosts and witching and black cats and fairies and demons in order there I'm just I'm just only bringing these things just to you know kind of forgive us uh uh I don't want to spend much of my time in this praise the Lord so it came from uh [Music] uh Sahan which is the Lord of death he gathered The Souls of the Evil Dead that have been condemned to to enter the body of human I mean of animals and the source of the good there were reincarnated to humans as humans you know the Drew believes that that the punishment of the Evil Dead will be like uh lightened by sacrifice prayers and gifts to the Lord of death so the whole big thing behind this whole uh Halloween October 31st was just a big celebration tour you know the god of death the god of death but it was said that the early American in the early American history Halloween was now practice Halloween was now practiced because one of the reasons that is there when the early fathers came over they frowned against those things okay because they knew that it was it had a big significance to purgatory and Purgatory was one of the things that the Catholic Church used to to bankrupt the Europeans okay because if you're if you're far if your family have wealth they are going to make sure they are they use every money that is in that well for you to pay for your father or pay for your loved one that is gone that was how they use to to rob the people so the early fathers did not do that they did they never you know gave heed to that it was not a it became widespread in the 20th century it's a culture that came with the Irish Catholic immigrants they brought their because Halloween is a national holiday in Ireland praise the Lord are we together now they're having all of these things on why they do you know they do the traits you know trick-or-treats and all of that they have in all sorts of things like I said I don't want to spend much of my time on it the only reason why I'm bringing this is because uh you know uh tomorrow is Halloween and also to be able to show uh you know the kind of a society that we are living in you know and it's it's I mean it's not to scare you no if you are afraid you just have the spirit of fear on you you need to be prayful and I don't think I'm trying to scare you praise the Lord I mean things that people choose to do and and you know uh I mean that's that's your choice you know that is your choice I'm not I'm not trying to uh uh establish an anti-hollow Halloween movement praise the Lord it is because we are in a society word uh uh that that don't have the the history of these things and you find people that I ignorantly involving themselves in it praise the Lord amen you you have many many Church groups that try to do you know a special thing for Halloween you know well yeah we don't we don't want to be uh dressing in that you know and then we we can just uh form our own thing to substitute for Halloween praise the Lord but just like just like I said and watching that you know that God in the Supernatural way will will will begin a move you know will will right at that very same time like I said to me was that was the first nail in the devil's coughing amen that God will raise up uh a sincere young man that all he want to do is just to please God and he got enslaved by the church and all of his rules in all office and knew nothing about the grace of God oh that we talked about today the grace of God the grace of God praise the Lord what actually Luther saw was the grace of God what he saw he looked in a scripture and he realized that a woman caught in adultery was was born to the feet of Jesus the ones that they taught and that they were they taught in the Catholic church that we that that that they as monks and as none must measure up their life talk right praise the Lord hallelujah oh you don't know that the Catholic Talk Church teach that when a man has been gone able to go through all of his training and he has come to the place to be confirmed as a priest in the local assembly that area where he word that a chopper that is turned over to him he says to those people as the Lord Jesus oh you don't know that Heat that he's giving the power to be able to take that that whiffer your little bread he's giving the power to be able to take that little bread and turn it to the body of the Lord Jesus now because Jesus turned water into wine that was his first miracle so that would be the first miracle a priest that has been ordained his first miracle will be able to hold that that uh glass in his hands and say the Latin ritual is being in power that your first miracle is to turn this wine into the blood the Electoral blood of the Lord Jesus and because of the power that is invested in them by the church a priest can abuse a woman that is married and she have no right to tell her husband because she's forgiving so you see the perverse that is in the church you see the evil that is upon the people how they will come to their confession boxes and they will pollute the minds of innocent girls they will abuse their minds just from a young age praise the Lord now if you don't know these things then you can sit around and allow it to happen in the churches Where You Are with some of us that know these things we don't lose a lot of sleep praise the Lord we were hindering a situation and his brother was trying to force us to do something I told him I says I said we're not going to do it I don't I don't want to go into the details it's not edifying you know it's not edifying so I'm not going to go into the details if you want to know come meet me in my office praise the Lord but I told him I said I said brother what are you trying to force us to do you you only want it for your gratification it's not the word of God praise the Lord and you don't see the danger of it because what you want us to do you are going to abuse your daughters now so these are the things these are the things that was birthed and the church and you have to know all that after the reformation and all these people went out uh you know uh uh uh uh on a looter not being properly taught in the word they say carry out those things they still practice it a way of keeping the church holiday is to know about the people life who are you you are born in seen simply in iniquity sir yes now you'll be calling people and demanding them to confess their sins to you who are you right which day were you born that is now on the calendar of men all of those perverseness praise the Lord preachers always looking for something to condemn the people they feel like they have preached when the people feel condemned where is the message of justification the preaching of the Gospel must convict us not condemn us it must convict us praise the Lord Hallelujah Oh What A Time what a time it was a disgraceful time and pretty soon the people started introducing things that were seem like um harmful plane amen samely I'm harmful play but yet they did not know that they were introducing themselves to a harmful spirits praise the Lord amen someone says well let's let's make a play Let's do uh saw and a wish of angel praise the Lord now whose child are you going to pour the spirit of which on praise the Lord oh it's just a play glory be to God let me tell you Halloween was considered the only day the help of the devil could be provoked for luck marriages relationships and all of that the only day that the help of the devil praise the Lord Hallelujah at 2.4 billion dollar business I realized their time will fail us to go into out of death to go into the rest of all there but in 1965 the UNICEF the United Nations Branch for children adopted Halloween as a day to collect money for children the United Nations branch that must be concerned for suffering children decided to do trick-or-treating it's one of the ones that are bound to be deceived that are that are you know that are moved by the uh their their human feelings Amen to thank the others that is an organization that is taking care of children now so we have all of these things people there are just a lot of things here we can I don't have the time to go into you know I don't have the time to go into all of that I think I've covered most of my business for a while uh the Halloween part of this subject but you know there was there was nothing the the really really uh that really inspire me look into this subject then to know that that was the very day that God pulled the first nail and the devil's coughing amen showing that even though The Babylon and traits and worship has had the grip of men Through the Ages but almighty God that promise that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent no matter how dark it is how deceitful and how evil men will be God is never without a witness praise the Lord he's never without a witness God show it through that the Book of Judges how he used insignificant people and even at times where it was needful for him to use woman like jail put a nail in it in a man's Temple God will always have someone that believed in his word he will always have someone that would take him by his word he's going to have a people praise the Lord a people that I impress with their messenger's message amen not not looking for interesting spirit that's just another face on this I was ourselves I was standing let me close this book because I just keep going long past the time here amen thank you for bearing with me praise the Lord but I think I got you to the place where I could preach from now until five o'clock it won't it won't matter to you because I know I've I've been able to put all of your spirit in a straight line praise the Lord but I would not abuse that amen I will not abuse that but what I want to bring to you and help you to realize people is data we must mean business with God is not a man praise the Lord you take this Bible you hold it in your hands and put it on your arm you're not putting God under your arm praise the Lord all right I was just looking at things and and studying through the message uh uh uh in touch and spirit this morning and and that prophet of God picking up things and uh and some things she talks about there he preached a subject on demonology which of course this is what will go on because you see this thing has has been with the church another part of this is the beast from the beginning is the beast at the end it has been like this with the church Paul in the book of galaxian he won the Gallatin church he talks to them who have been with you so but you see the bewitching in a Gallatin Church is uh uh was was a different kind of for bewitching amen the bewitching in the galatian church is a different kind of a bewitching let me tell you the Witchcraft power that is in this world is no match to the spirit of God amen it's no match to the spirit of God I'm out there with people with familiar spirit in church before I'm there with that praise the Lord [Music] it's just that we don't learn that we don't learn to say everything you know but uh uh it just doesn't have things that uh that scare me because I know I have the word to deal with it amen and there's a spirit here to pick it up [Music] praise the Lord but you see when Jews started to speak about setting May creep in one way praise the Lord and those were the people that Paul was talking about when he says talking to the church who has Bewitched you we're going to go into all of that we will go into all of that you know because brother Branham talks to yet about you know how it is easier to deal with demon in the flesh because when a demon is in the flesh it makes a person sick everybody can see it everybody can see it because we got to rush this person to the hospital they are sick no matter what name that the doctors call it it's a demon that is making this person sick but when the person has a religious demon praise the Lord is the one that is difficult to deal with because there is one thing of that Spirit it justify itself in everything that he does so you see that's what I want to bring bring you know I want us to get to what we close this thing I can take care of everything tonight or today as a church just like I said the Lord has been good to us the law has kept us the Lord has blessed us praise the Lord the Lord blessings some of our brothers you know with job and uh you know some of our sisters you know uh we we we're having nurses in church and all of that all of those things are God's blessing blessing our love for young people you know who are into relationship marriage and children and all of that they are all of God's blessing but you see we cannot underestimate oh belittle the thing that had brought us this far praise the Lord amen we came out I mean when God is blessing his people that's when the church the people rise up with with a standard a standard of gratefulness praise the Lord amen oh that's where we're supposed to be on fire for God we get so blessed that we go away from church I mean God is blessing us so much that he don't want us to be in church he don't want us to be in church he's blessing us so much that we don't have time to pray oh God you have blessed me so much I don't have time to pray I don't have time to read the word let's check ourselves praise the Lord the thing about it there's also there is that I mean with uh with uh with a group like this you you you you you you see it and appreciate a lot of discipline in the head of the ones that God has placed in our midst the ones that I mean you you look to them you know as as in in a kind of a parent figure if they will not be in church they'll let you know they will not be in church yeah praise the Lord they are the ones that are up there in age they are supposed to be you know uh uh uh you know uh uh trusting the grace of God for strength in the morning but yet they get to church before many of you young ones you that have the energy you use your energy to come to church late but Bram says that's what that's what the meditation time for he says we come and wait on God we come and wait on our gifts that's why I'm going with this that's that's the thing that is concerning me just like I said you go I mean you go out you see things there are things that you see it it impresses you you say oh my God the Lord Jesus bless you brother Brian even even the church others I can read I can I can read that brother says he went to this church he saw so much other he said wow I have longed to see a church like this how the the discipline that the people have in honor of the world they are worship and all of that he says what a spirit of God can just come in among the people and people like that it's easy to preach you don't have to fight spiritual battle but before but when the people don't have no regard for the church oh no they don't have no regard for seven they don't come and prepare themselves right all they bring their battles from whom right into church then you have to deal with all of that settle down before you even start entering into your message and just like I said the Lord has been good to us the Lord is Blessing us as a church praise the Lord let's not slack in well-doing that's why Paul said to the church let's not slack in well-doing let's now slack in our our home prayer meetings let's not slop in our own personal uh devotion and discipline to the word that's all we can give God is a life of appreciation we are not living by the Lord we are living doing what we are doing because we thank God that he have brought us to this life of decency it's not a lord it's not a root it's a life of that's all we owe the Lord a spirit of gratefulness let's Stand Together
