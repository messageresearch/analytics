[52:15] pulpit I was saying that from one
[52:18] service to another
[52:19] service even though it's a short time
[52:22] it's a long time for the enemy to do
[52:24] anything he wants to do and it's also a
[52:27] long time for God to honor
[52:32] himself
[52:34] yesterday um A call came from Brother
[52:37] one it was very very early in the
[52:40] morning um 12
[52:42] something so I woke up in the morning
[52:46] and I said no this call 12 something it
[52:49] must be something urgent so I I called
[52:52] him and uh he told me brother
[52:56] uh Max brother Max was not doing fine
[53:00] and uh he he needed us to pray for him
[53:03] so right away I called uh brother Marx
[53:07] and I didn't get him but he called back
[53:10] and um when I was talking to
[53:12] him um I wouldn't I wouldn't tell his
[53:15] story for him but from the little I
[53:18] gathered and from what happened it was
[53:22] an
[53:24] attack the brother was not sick when he
[53:27] went to
[53:28] bed and all of a sudden in the state in
[53:32] which he found
[53:34] himself so much
[53:36] so that he even got a hold of his phone
[53:40] he was able to D dial
[53:42] 911 and yet could not even
[53:47] speak I mean I I have heard two stories
[53:52] of this nature that never ended well
[53:56] and for him to be here with his family
[53:59] this morning is nothing but the glory of
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:10] God the enemy would never P stop
[54:13] perceiving you as a child of
[54:15] God but one thing is sure that the Lord
[54:19] Our God always has his eyes on
[54:24] you
[54:26] it doesn't matter whether you're on top
[54:27] of the hill you're in the valley whether
[54:31] you're on the sick bed it doesn't change
[54:33] anything always remember that the Lord
[54:36] Our God has his eyes on

[54:49] yes we are serving a great and a
[54:51] wonderful God wonderful praise be to God
[54:58] yes so what do we have this
[55:02] morning one morning I just woke up just
[55:05] between the master
[55:06] bedroom and the doorway to the master
[55:10] the the the
[55:12] toilet the white conference just came to
[55:17] me and it was it was it was so so hard
[55:22] normally when those things come to me
[55:25] then I just go to work I sit down I go
[55:29] to my computer just you know and a few
[55:33] things come I just put them down but on
[55:35] this occasion I just remember that no I
[55:37] have heard a few quotes and a sermon on
[55:40] conference and I believe the prophet of
[55:42] God has preached this so let me go
[55:44] search it and I went and searched and
[55:47] there were seven
[55:49] messages
[55:51] conference amen and I said I was going
[55:54] to listen to all of
[55:55] them I listened to the first
[55:59] five and on
[56:01] Friday the plan was to listen to the
[56:04] sixth
[56:06] one and I started listening to
[56:09] it then about halfway I realized that it
[56:13] was not even the message conference I
[56:15] was listening to something said turn it
[56:18] off and go back to conference and I said
[56:21] no let go of it and then I realized
[56:25] why I went there I didn't even know I
[56:29] was there though and that was the
[56:32] message confirmation and evidence amen
[56:36] and there was something that I picked
[56:38] there even though I didn't intend to go
[56:41] there which is very important to what we
[56:42] are going to do this morning praise be
[56:44] to God am so by the grace of God we are
[56:49] going to look at the message
[56:52] conference it so much blessed me
[56:55] so so much blessed me that I just want
[56:59] us to encourage ourselves this morning
[57:02] praise be to God there is nothing that
[57:05] can ever be compared to being a child of
[57:09] God there is nothing that can ever be
[57:12] compared to being a Christian amen not
[57:15] just going to church on Sunday or
[57:18] Wednesdays but seeing the word of God
[57:22] becoming flesh in you am
[57:25] amen experiencing the nature of God in
[57:29] this life the power and the authority of
[57:33] God in your
[57:35] life beginning to taste of heavenly
[57:38] things even on this Earth there is
[57:42] nothing that compares to it praise be to
[57:45] God and we are in a conference here this
[57:48] morning if we can please turn and turn
[57:50] our Bibles to um Isaiah 11:16
[58:09] Isaiah 11
[58:23] 16
[58:27] I would probably start from
[58:30] 15 and I
[58:33] read and when ye spread forth your hands
[58:38] I will hide my
[58:40] eyes from
[58:42] ye when you make many prayers I will not
[58:46] hear your hands are full of
[58:49] blood wash you make you clean put away
[58:55] the evil of your doings from before mine

[59:29] Crimson they shall be as
[59:32] wool may the Lord add His blessings to
[59:35] the reading of his word in Jesus name
[59:40] amen shall we be
[59:44] seated praise be to

[59:56] not when you feel
[1:00:00] convenient come
[1:00:04] now and let us Rasen together sayth the
[1:00:08] Lord though your sins be as
[1:00:11] Scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[1:00:15] though they be red like
[1:00:17] Crimson they shall be as W praise be to
[1:00:23] God with we are
[1:00:30] looking at the message
[1:00:35] conference now what is a
[1:00:38] conference I looked it up a conference
[1:00:41] is a formal
[1:00:43] meeting for
[1:00:46] discussion so then I had to go look out
[1:00:50] what the word formal
[1:00:53] is the word formal means that it is done
[1:00:59] the meeting is done in
[1:01:02] accordance with rules of
[1:01:06] convention that is
[1:01:09] suitable for any situation or
[1:01:14] occasion so the meeting is not
[1:01:17] held just in a
[1:01:21] balance but there are a set of rules
[1:01:26] and
[1:01:27] regulations there are
[1:01:30] laws pertaining to this
[1:01:33] meeting that whatever discussion that we
[1:01:35] are going to
[1:01:37] have we are going to have that
[1:01:40] discussion in relation to a set of
[1:01:45] rules or
[1:01:48] regulations or
[1:01:53] lws then and while I was thinking about
[1:01:56] it the a school conference just came in
[1:01:59] the
[1:02:00] view for those of you that have gone
[1:02:03] school I mean gone to school in this
[1:02:06] country our parents here who have
[1:02:09] children going to
[1:02:10] school once in a while you are called to
[1:02:13] the school for a
[1:02:17] conference and then you go in as a
[1:02:19] parent why
[1:02:21] because the school has a set of rules
[1:02:25] rules that they expect every student in
[1:02:28] the school to abide by so when you have
[1:02:31] a child in the school that is not
[1:02:33] obeying the rules is misbehaving in
[1:02:36] school then they call you for a
[1:02:38] conference and then you come in and they
[1:02:41] tell you these are our
[1:02:47] regulations this is the expectation we
[1:02:50] have of every student in this school how
[1:02:54] be it this is what your son or your
[1:02:58] daughter is doing which is alien to what
[1:03:01] we stand
[1:03:03] for so the meeting is just not a meeting
[1:03:06] in the
[1:03:08] air but the school has an
[1:03:12] expectation for every student in the
[1:03:15] school and because they had they are not
[1:03:19] behaven according to those set of rules
[1:03:22] or the regulations and com conf is
[1:03:26] called and then you
[1:03:29] come and then they discuss
[1:03:32] it and there are expectations
[1:03:41] thereafter sometimes a child may not be
[1:03:46] misbehaving but they may not be doing
[1:03:48] well in
[1:03:51] school again the school has an
[1:03:55] expectation for every
[1:03:57] student so what is going on could there
[1:04:01] be something in the house could there be
[1:04:03] something in school could there be
[1:04:04] something bothering them they call a
[1:04:09] conference your child is not doing well
[1:04:11] in this
[1:04:12] area not doing well in this area his
[1:04:16] grace are not meeting our expectation we
[1:04:18] are wondering whether there is something
[1:04:20] wrong a conference is called to discuss
[1:04:23] the matter
[1:04:24] and to find a way
[1:04:28] out whenever those conferences are
[1:04:32] called it's not just for the sake of it
[1:04:36] it's to discuss the problem and then
[1:04:39] find a way
[1:04:41] out not to discuss it and leave it where
[1:04:44] it is but to discuss it and find a
[1:04:47] solution to
[1:04:51] it praise the Lord amen
[1:04:56] and here the prophet of God talks about
[1:04:59] you know a lot of conferences after the
[1:05:02] world war the big four he talks about
[1:05:04] the UN conference the Geneva conference
[1:05:07] the Paris conference and um a lot of
[1:05:11] conferences he talks about now in these
[1:05:14] conferences they are
[1:05:18] just
[1:05:22] politicians subject matter
[1:05:27] intellectuals that come together from
[1:05:30] all the
[1:05:35] countries into that conference just to
[1:05:38] make rules for the
[1:05:41] rest they don't ask your
[1:05:44] participation they don't ask your
[1:05:48] opinion it doesn't matter whether you
[1:05:50] agree with it or not but they go in they
[1:05:54] represent you
[1:05:55] anyhow it doesn't matter whether you
[1:05:57] like them or
[1:05:58] not and then they come to an agreement
[1:06:02] that this is what we are going to do and
[1:06:04] they enforce it on the rest of the
[1:06:09] people and you would realize that in a
[1:06:13] lot of these
[1:06:15] conferences the political will is not
[1:06:19] there we can talk about the Kyoto
[1:06:21] conference and the other conference that
[1:06:23] has to do with the latest that is the
[1:06:25] ozone layer
[1:06:27] depletion where the countries meet
[1:06:29] together and then they talk about
[1:06:31] cutting down on greenhouse gases because
[1:06:35] the ozone layer is depleting there is um
[1:06:39] the the weather is changing um the the
[1:06:42] the the ice in the in the in the in the
[1:06:44] colder regions are
[1:06:46] melting I mean but there is no political
[1:06:51] will they
[1:06:53] meet they come to an agreement on what
[1:06:55] to
[1:06:56] do and yet they don't follow it with
[1:07:05] action you can have a
[1:07:10] conference get to the cracks of the
[1:07:13] problem and the solution is
[1:07:17] prescribed because there is no lack of
[1:07:21] commitment you can walk out
[1:07:24] and 10 20 30 40 years later you are
[1:07:28] still the same or you can even get worse
[1:07:31] yes it is not because there was no
[1:07:34] conference it was not because the
[1:07:36] problem was not discussed it was not
[1:07:38] because the problem was not dealt with
[1:07:41] but then there was lack of
[1:07:44] commitment there was lack of commitment
[1:07:48] you were not committed to it that's
[1:07:51] true and because of that you didn't take
[1:07:54] it
[1:07:55] up and why there is no
[1:07:58] commitment why that will is not there it
[1:08:01] doesn't help
[1:08:03] you now in this
[1:08:08] messages the prayer of God talks about
[1:08:11] the Garden of Eden
[1:08:15] conference and we are going to start
[1:08:17] right there the garden of aen
[1:08:20] conference praise the
[1:08:22] Lord
[1:08:24] that God created the heavens and the
[1:08:30] Earth the Earth was so
[1:08:33] beautiful everything was in order there
[1:08:37] was no man to till the ground God formed
[1:08:40] Men Out of the Dust of the
[1:08:44] earth breathe light into
[1:08:47] him
[1:08:49] everything was what God wanted it to be
[1:08:57] now God brought man into this
[1:09:01] life everything was
[1:09:04] perfect there was
[1:09:07] love not just between Adam and
[1:09:10] Eve even in the animal kingdom there was
[1:09:14] so much
[1:09:15] love there was
[1:09:17] peace there was
[1:09:20] Harmony between the lion the bear the
[1:09:24] antelope the deer there was so much
[1:09:27] peace that they could sit and fellowship
[1:09:32] together but that was going to be
[1:09:35] interrupted
[1:09:37] why because God had in
[1:09:42] him an attribute to be a
[1:09:46] savior and to be a
[1:09:49] savior something must get lost for you
[1:09:53] to salvage
[1:09:55] but if everything is what it is what do
[1:09:57] you save there is nothing to
[1:09:59] save so something must get out of order
[1:10:05] amen and God was going to ensure that
[1:10:10] something would get out of
[1:10:14] order that the peace that they were
[1:10:18] enjoying was going to be
[1:10:22] interrupted the Lord that was
[1:10:25] there was going to be
[1:10:27] interrupted the harmony there was it was
[1:10:31] going to be
[1:10:33] interrupted in fact as I was looking at
[1:10:36] this a thought came to me that it was
[1:10:39] not an easy thing for
[1:10:41] God remember we are talking about a just
[1:10:46] God we are talking about a holy
[1:10:52] God and to think of what is going to
[1:10:55] happen in the garden or what was going
[1:10:58] to happen in the
[1:10:59] garden I don't think it was easy for
[1:11:03] God that by that
[1:11:08] act this Earth we are living in was just
[1:11:11] going to become one big prison I don't
[1:11:15] think it was an easy thing for
[1:11:20] God I remember years ago
[1:11:24] when I was serving in the Ghana prison
[1:11:27] service I was at a local prison called
[1:11:29] TAA TAA prison
[1:11:32] service and a
[1:11:36] mother brought her only
[1:11:40] son he was not just an only son but he
[1:11:44] was the only
[1:11:45] child I am not sure where the father was
[1:11:48] at
[1:11:49] then I think the father had passed or
[1:11:51] something to that effect
[1:11:54] so the mother was the mother and the
[1:11:56] father at the same
[1:12:00] time and as we said every every every
[1:12:05] parent has an expectation for their
[1:12:09] children and this child was
[1:12:12] growing and then the child started
[1:12:16] fellowshipping with people and doing
[1:12:19] things they ought not to
[1:12:21] do so the father
[1:12:26] actually the mother the mother went to
[1:12:30] court and spoke to the judge that you
[1:12:34] know what this is what my son is
[1:12:37] doing I don't want him to grow to be a
[1:12:40] bad
[1:12:41] child I want you to put him in behind
[1:12:44] bars just for 6
[1:12:48] months let him go and experience life in
[1:12:51] prison and when he come comes back he
[1:12:54] will be a changed
[1:12:57] person it's unfortunate
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:00] though being a prison
[1:13:03] officer I can tell you for a
[1:13:07] fact that the people who come to prison
[1:13:10] with minor crimes when they leave they
[1:13:13] go and they commit bigger
[1:13:15] ones because it's like the prison is a
[1:13:18] school that they come and they learn
[1:13:20] about all the dirty tricks and they to
[1:13:23] use them when they get
[1:13:25] out the mother didn't know but how be it
[1:13:29] this child I mean a very innocent
[1:13:31] teenager I mean I used to see him and my
[1:13:34] heart would
[1:13:35] break because in the prison he didn't
[1:13:38] even have any
[1:13:39] company he was just by
[1:13:42] himself he just took life as it
[1:13:47] was but do you know between the mother
[1:13:50] and her son who was in prison the mother
[1:13:54] was actually more in prison than his her
[1:13:57] son the mother was leing 94 miles
[1:14:00] away and normally prisoners are allowed
[1:14:04] one visit in a week and that one visit
[1:14:07] is just of 15 minutes the mother will
[1:14:09] travel 94 miles to come to the
[1:14:14] prison and then she'll come and sit with
[1:14:16] the son it's 15 minutes the mother
[1:14:18] doesn't want to
[1:14:19] leave yeah and we are telling her it's
[1:14:23] time the mother doesn't want to
[1:14:26] leave finally she was allowed two visit
[1:14:29] visits in a week instead of one and she
[1:14:33] will come and she doesn't want to leave
[1:14:36] she couldn't stand it she went back to
[1:14:38] the court and they took the boy out
[1:14:40] before the six
[1:14:46] months and for God to think that what I
[1:14:50] am allowing what is going to happen to
[1:14:53] him humanity is going to create chaos
[1:14:57] it's going to create mder it's going to
[1:14:59] create Wars it's going to create
[1:15:01] earthquake it's going to create
[1:15:02] tornadoes it's going to create problem
[1:15:05] between a man and his neighbor father
[1:15:07] and son mother and daughter there is
[1:15:09] going to be Chaos on the earth and God
[1:15:12] still looks on and allows it to happen I
[1:15:15] don't think it was an easy
[1:15:19] thing I don't think it was an easy thing
[1:15:23] just imagine you a father having your
[1:15:26] only
[1:15:28] daughter fathers love their daughters so
[1:15:30] much and a daughter you so much love and
[1:15:34] then you sit down and then you watch
[1:15:36] your enemy to come under your roof to
[1:15:40] come in misbehave you will put a bullet
[1:15:42] in the head of that man if God doesn't
[1:15:44] come
[1:15:48] down and then God sits on his
[1:15:51] throne and here comes
[1:15:53] the
[1:15:55] Devil comes to his only
[1:15:59] daughter has God
[1:16:01] said that you should not eat of the
[1:16:04] Trees of the garden oh no God said we
[1:16:07] can eat any tree we want but the tree of
[1:16:09] knowledge of Good and Evil which is in
[1:16:11] the midst of garden we should not eat it
[1:16:14] for the very day we eat it we shall
[1:16:16] surely die oh you will not surely die it
[1:16:19] will make you wise it will make you Gods
[1:16:22] it will make
[1:16:23] I as I was thinking about it again it
[1:16:25] just hit
[1:16:27] me that you can put a
[1:16:31] can by the roadside and people would
[1:16:34] just walk past it 24 hours a day and
[1:16:37] nobody would B to open it but the very
[1:16:42] day you say nobody should open this can
[1:16:45] here yeah right then human beings get
[1:16:49] curious why did they say we shouldn't
[1:16:51] open it no there should be something
[1:16:55] inside there then the people want to
[1:16:58] know what is inside human beings are
[1:17:00] always human
[1:17:03] beings it's only God who can handle
[1:17:06] us we are so so so stubborn God have
[1:17:12] mercy but under these
[1:17:15] circumstances this fall was ordained to
[1:17:19] be nothing could stop this fall
[1:17:23] nothing could stop this
[1:17:25] fall because there was an attribute in
[1:17:28] God to be a
[1:17:30] savior and something must
[1:17:33] fall amen Adam and Eve had no
[1:17:37] choice and as a matter of fact brother
[1:17:40] Bram said everything that was in God's
[1:17:43] original creation couldn't
[1:17:47] fall so for the fall to take
[1:17:50] place God had to bring if out of Adam
[1:17:54] after he had rested on the seventh
[1:18:00] day and then here comes the
[1:18:03] devil gets so dangerously
[1:18:07] close to God's only daughter and the
[1:18:11] father is sitting on the throne and
[1:18:14] looking
[1:18:15] down and I guess the Angels were just
[1:18:18] going to
[1:18:19] him Master have you seen what is
[1:18:22] happening down in in the
[1:18:23] garden said how do you know fast forward
[1:18:28] in several
[1:18:29] messages brother talks about when the
[1:18:32] three Hebrew children were being mared
[1:18:35] into the fairy
[1:18:37] fness and how the angel Gabriel went to
[1:18:40] God with his sron he said Master have
[1:18:44] you looked down in
[1:18:46] Babylon that your three children that
[1:18:48] have stood for you are being mared into
[1:18:50] the fairy furnace should I go down and
[1:18:53] wipe it out of out of the map God said
[1:18:56] no calm down you have been a very
[1:18:59] faithful Angel to
[1:19:02] me take it easy and here comes
[1:19:07] wormwood that flooded the all
[1:19:09] Earth with
[1:19:12] water and destroyed every single
[1:19:14] everything
[1:19:15] single creature that was on the Earth
[1:19:18] surface Master have you seen what is
[1:19:21] going on in Babylon
[1:19:23] let me go and then just waste water
[1:19:25] there and wipe it out of History the
[1:19:28] father said no
[1:19:31] take and I believe I
[1:19:35] believe that when the
[1:19:38] enemy when Satan went so close to the
[1:19:41] daughter of God I believe the Angels
[1:19:44] were not sitting
[1:19:46] down I believe they were ready don't
[1:19:49] forget that a war had just been fought
[1:19:52] in heaven that's right when Lucifer and
[1:19:54] his angels fought against Angel Michael
[1:19:58] and his angels till there was no room
[1:20:00] left was in heaven and he was cast down
[1:20:02] on
[1:20:04] Earth and I believe that when the Angels
[1:20:07] saw it they knew there was going to be
[1:20:10] another Showdown yeah they were ready
[1:20:12] with their sords ready to go to war
[1:20:16] Master have you seen what is going on
[1:20:18] the enemy is getting too close and God
[1:20:21] says take it take it see wased on wased
[1:20:24] on wased on
[1:20:27] till the devil
[1:20:31] beguiled God's only
[1:20:37] daughter I believe the
[1:20:40] Angels were
[1:20:44] confused they asked themselves what just
[1:20:48] happened how would the holy
[1:20:51] God sit down and look at this happen
[1:20:55] what just happened we know God loves his
[1:20:59] children could God have stopped this yes
[1:21:02] but what just
[1:21:04] happened they never understood
[1:21:09] it praise the
[1:21:12] Lord they questioning
[1:21:18] themselves and at the appointed time God
[1:21:21] went down as you usual to have
[1:21:24] fellowship with his
[1:21:26] children that did not stop
[1:21:29] him and probably the Angels were looking
[1:21:31] on oh he is going to destroy them he is
[1:21:35] going to destroy them because they know
[1:21:38] he is a holy
[1:21:41] God he is the god of light in whom there
[1:21:44] is no Darkness not even a trace of
[1:21:47] Darkness God does not fellowship with
[1:21:50] sin and as he was going down I believe
[1:21:53] they were saying in their house oh these
[1:21:55] people are consumed he's going to
[1:21:57] destroy
[1:21:59] them because they
[1:22:02] know that the first group that attempted
[1:22:05] it Lucifer and his angels never had a
[1:22:09] second chance right and those up there
[1:22:13] who have never fallen do not know what
[1:22:16] Redemption
[1:22:19] means but in between the angel that fell
[1:22:24] who never had a second chance and those
[1:22:26] that have not Fallen who do not know
[1:22:29] what sin means or Redemption means there
[1:22:32] are a people in between amen praise be
[1:22:35] to God who knows what Redemption
[1:22:39] means and God comes
[1:22:42] down and they were thinking God was
[1:22:44] going to destroy them and God rather
[1:22:48] performs a
[1:22:51] sacrifice takes an an innocent animal
[1:22:55] and offers a sacrifice for his
[1:22:59] children they were confounded what just
[1:23:10] happened there is a
[1:23:15] song a song that
[1:23:18] says the song is not
[1:23:21] coming but when We Gather Before the
[1:23:24] Throne of God and we begin to sing the
[1:23:27] the Redemption song that the Angels
[1:23:29] cannot follow that song they can't
[1:23:33] that's true because they don't know what
[1:23:36] Redemption means but you and I know what
[1:23:38] Redemption means
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:42] hallelujah and God comes down to have a
[1:23:47] conference with his
[1:23:50] children and in that conference
[1:23:56] God tells his
[1:23:57] children you have broken my
[1:24:04] heart what is it that you guys have
[1:24:08] done we know the story I'm not going to
[1:24:11] spend too much time on that but God
[1:24:14] cured the
[1:24:17] serpent on your belly th shall go all
[1:24:19] the days of your life and dust thou
[1:24:21] shall eat
[1:24:24] and when it comes to the woman he said
[1:24:27] you are going to give birth in sorrow in
[1:24:30] sorrow you are going to experience birth
[1:24:33] pain it came to Adam he cursed the land
[1:24:36] for Adam's
[1:24:38] sake praise be to God
[1:24:41] Amen but God established
[1:24:48] something that an innocent blood was
[1:24:54] shed and innocent blood was
[1:25:00] shed because they were supposed to
[1:25:04] die but an innocent lamb had to die for
[1:25:09] them to
[1:25:12] live and that was an established
[1:25:20] order and now to
[1:25:28] it was a bing Bush
[1:25:34] conference that a man by the name
[1:25:39] Moses who looked at
[1:25:43] Egypt and then he kissed Egypt
[1:25:47] goodbye and promised himself never to
[1:25:51] return back to Egypt
[1:25:53] just went
[1:25:55] away and in the wilderness of media he
[1:25:58] got himself a wife was taking care of
[1:26:00] his father-in-law and he was happy with
[1:26:04] life he was happy with
[1:26:07] life and I believe in the 40 years he
[1:26:12] was in the wilderness I believe with all
[1:26:15] my heart that he asked himself a lot of
[1:26:18] questions because growing up his mother
[1:26:21] would tell him
[1:26:22] you are born to deliver the children of
[1:26:24] Israel from their bondage that you are a
[1:26:27] promised child you are a good child you
[1:26:30] are the Redeemer you redeem these people
[1:26:32] from their bondage and he grew up
[1:26:35] knowing that he was going to be the
[1:26:38] deliverer so when he saw that an
[1:26:41] Egyptian and an Israelite were fighting
[1:26:44] he just went in and then he killed the
[1:26:49] Egyptian he thought he did it in
[1:26:53] secret the next time he would
[1:26:55] realize that his cover was
[1:26:58] blown was when his two
[1:27:01] brothers were having an argument and
[1:27:04] then he weighed in and one said do you
[1:27:07] think you can kill me the way you kill
[1:27:09] the Egyptian he said oh my cover is
[1:27:12] blown he feared for his life and he ran
[1:27:16] away so in those 40 years he was in the
[1:27:19] wilderness I believe he was asking
[1:27:21] himself a
[1:27:22] question Oh I thought I was going to be
[1:27:25] the
[1:27:26] deliverer so mommy lied to
[1:27:29] me I wasn't after
[1:27:32] all if I was how come I am here or maybe
[1:27:37] I had all the opportunity in the world
[1:27:40] because I was going to be the next
[1:27:41] Pharaoh maybe I acted too fast maybe I
[1:27:44] should have just rested myself and
[1:27:46] waited till I took over the throne then
[1:27:49] I can free these people so true you may
[1:27:52] you may think that the Mind battles you
[1:27:54] are going through today just started
[1:27:56] with you it has always been and it would
[1:28:00] always
[1:28:02] be the Mind battles we are going through
[1:28:07] today in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:28:10] this is the
[1:28:13] ground praise be to
[1:28:16] God you would be having
[1:28:19] thoughts and you would think it's you
[1:28:21] it's not you
[1:28:25] you the devil can never get in
[1:28:28] here until he's able to conquer you up
[1:28:33] here
[1:28:36] amen and he was going through
[1:28:39] this but one
[1:28:41] day it was meant to be another usual day
[1:28:47] he goes up with his
[1:28:49] sheep and in the wilderness
[1:28:52] where he had
[1:28:54] been all these years he saw that there
[1:28:59] was a bush that was burning yet it was
[1:29:01] not
[1:29:05] consumed and the Bible says he
[1:29:08] turned to look at
[1:29:11] it then he heard
[1:29:14] Moses Moses say yes here I
[1:29:19] am said don't move any
[1:29:22] further the ground on which you are
[1:29:25] standing is a Holy
[1:29:26] Ground take the shoes off your
[1:29:32] feet praise be to
[1:29:34] God the Bible says be ye holy because
[1:29:39] the Lord our God is
[1:29:42] Holy it is not dos and
[1:29:46] don'ts it is not do and
[1:29:49] don'ts that you sit down and then you
[1:29:51] you can plan what to do and what not to
[1:29:54] do so you can be holy no it has nothing
[1:29:57] to do with you your good works at best
[1:30:02] is as filthy rat in the sight of
[1:30:05] God it has nothing to do with your good
[1:30:11] works be you holy because the Lord your
[1:30:15] God is Holy is when God can you imagine
[1:30:19] on that piece of land where God was
[1:30:22] telling Moses to take off his shoes
[1:30:24] because it was a Holy Ground can you
[1:30:26] imagine how many times in his life in
[1:30:29] those 40 years can you imagine how many
[1:30:32] times he passed there amen and the shoes
[1:30:35] jumping there and head butting one
[1:30:37] another but on this day it was a Holy
[1:30:41] Ground why because the glory of God had
[1:30:44] come
[1:30:45] down amen it's when
[1:30:49] God comes into you yeah amen it doesn't
[1:30:53] matter what life you have lived amen it
[1:30:56] doesn't matter how useless that life is
[1:30:59] it doesn't matter how wretched you think
[1:31:01] it
[1:31:02] is when God comes into that life that
[1:31:05] becomes a holy
[1:31:07] life know ye not that you are the Temple
[1:31:10] of the Holy
[1:31:12] Ghost God does not dwell in

[1:31:24] holy vessel amen You Are Holy praise be
[1:31:28] to God
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] am and then the discussion
[1:31:34] starts
[1:31:36] Moses I have seen the afflictions of my
[1:31:40] people I have heard their Cry by reason
[1:31:43] of their task

[1:32:43] hide behind our
[1:32:47] disabilities in order to get
[1:32:50] away from from the service of the
[1:32:53] lord we try to find
[1:32:56] excuses why we should not be in the T of
[1:32:59] God why we should not be in the service

[1:35:43] called you for the task yes how fast can
[1:35:46] you run away how far can you
[1:35:50] go how far can you go we saw in the life
[1:35:54] of
[1:35:56] Jonah when God sent him to nineve he
[1:35:59] wanted to run
[1:36:01] away instead of him enjoying that cruise
[1:36:05] to

[1:36:09] of a
[1:36:10] whale praise the
[1:36:13] Lord how far can you go to get
[1:36:17] away the book of
[1:36:19] Psalms say that whe shall I go to get
[1:36:23] away from thy Spirit or whe shall I go
[1:36:26] to get away from thy
[1:36:28] presence if I Ascend up into heaven
[1:36:33] behold Thou Art there yes if I make my
[1:36:36] bed in hell behold Thou Art
[1:36:40] there if I should take the wings of the
[1:36:43] morning and dwell in the uttermost part
[1:36:46] of the sea even day thy hand shall guide
[1:36:50] me and thy right hand hand shall Lead Me

[1:37:27] you and whatever
[1:37:29] purpose God has brought you into into
[1:37:32] this life to do or to
[1:37:35] accomplish you would accomplish it to
[1:37:38] the
[1:37:44] letter God is not
[1:37:49] looking at you
[1:37:53] in whatever state you see
[1:37:56] yourself he has a better picture of
[1:38:01] you which you have no idea
[1:38:06] of with every
[1:38:09] trial with every
[1:38:12] Temptation with every
[1:38:14] disappointment with every
[1:38:17] failure you are taking a step towards
[1:38:20] that perfect picture

[1:39:35] depending
[1:39:37] on and the generations Yet to Come are
[1:39:40] depending
[1:39:41] on they were all dependent on this
[1:39:44] conference and his
[1:39:48] outcome that when job
[1:39:53] went through all the
[1:39:58] trials and God just opened his eyes just
[1:40:01] a little on that Easter
[1:40:04] morning when he
[1:40:09] saw what he saw he
[1:40:13] screamed I know my redeemer
[1:40:16] liveth and in the last day I shall see
[1:40:20] him

[1:49:49] think
[1:49:51] that when you begin to serve God things
[1:49:55] automatically should get
[1:49:59] better but as a matter of fact a lot of
[1:50:02] the times they get
[1:50:06] worse praise be to
[1:50:10] God a lot of the times they get
[1:50:14] worse don't expect an easy
[1:50:19] Road for it is not an easy road we are
[1:50:21] walking
[1:50:23] on some people gave their lives for this
[1:50:29] gospel it's a gospel that is dripping
[1:50:32] with
[1:50:33] blood as a matter of fact some people
[1:50:36] were given the option just deny Christ
[1:50:41] and we will set you free they chose to
[1:50:44] die believ in
[1:50:47] God it is not how long you live live
[1:50:51] that
[1:50:53] mares
[1:50:55] metella lived the

[1:51:22] is it is certain that this world has
[1:51:26] surely come to an
[1:51:29] end we are living in a b time there is
[1:51:33] no more
[1:51:34] time we are living in a borrow time God
[1:51:38] is just waiting for the last person to
[1:51:41] come in and that will be the
[1:51:44] end one thing the Bible says God would
[1:51:47] not lose one

[1:51:53] child of God God will bring you in am if
[1:51:56] it will cause you to come on broken

[1:52:28] all those
[1:52:29] things and then say not my will but let
[1:52:33] the will of God be
[1:52:35] done that I want to identify myself with

[1:55:17] and
[1:55:18] Resurrection something had to be done
[1:55:21] there were men that had intellectual
[1:55:24] conception so there was another great
[1:55:26] conference set we know
[1:55:32] it they had to have a
[1:55:34] conference and something had to be done
[1:55:38] for Jesus said Don't Preach no more
[1:55:41] don't sing no more don't sing anymore
[1:55:44] don't go out and Minister anymore but I
[1:55:48] want a conference with you
[1:55:50] you and in this conference I'm going to
[1:55:54] bring the Holy Spirit but go up to the
[1:55:58] city of Jerusalem and there you wait
[1:56:01] until I get back I've got to go up to
[1:56:05] heaven and let them
[1:56:08] rejoice and I've got to go
[1:56:14] up to the throne of
[1:56:16] majesty the body of Jesus but I am going
[1:56:21] we are going to have a conference up up
[1:56:23] there and the god that dwells in me has
[1:56:28] promised that I could return back again
[1:56:32] and I will be with you I'll will be in
[1:56:34] you with you in you even to the

[1:56:49] works that I do will you do
[1:56:53] also so they didn't know how they ever
[1:56:57] do this so they went to Pentecost and
[1:57:03] 120 went into the upper room and closed
[1:57:06] the door and they waited and they
[1:57:11] waited the trouble with
[1:57:14] us if we don't
[1:57:16] get audience with God in about 10
[1:57:20] minutes we are
[1:57:21] tired our knees are
[1:57:24] hurting we want to
[1:57:28] live if he hasn't answer us again
[1:57:32] according to what we
[1:57:33] want the way we
[1:57:36] think we are disgusted with
[1:57:39] him oh come let us reason
[1:57:43] together go up to
[1:57:46] Pentecost I want to reason I want to
[1:57:50] reason it with you just go up there and
[1:57:54] wait 10 days there had been sitting
[1:57:58] standing praying everything waiting for
[1:58:01] the
[1:58:02] promise and all of a sudden the result
[1:58:06] of the conference in heaven came down
[1:58:08] the Holy Ghost like a rushing Mighty
[1:58:11] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:58:14] they were sitting they were filled with
[1:58:16] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and they went
[1:58:18] forward preaching the
[1:58:20] word when they
[1:58:24] had when we have World conferences we
[1:58:28] usually have their selected place and
[1:58:32] what they
[1:58:34] do at these
[1:58:36] conferences they
[1:58:38] drink drinks cocktails they smoke cigars
[1:58:41] and cigarettes they lie to one another
[1:58:45] and deceive one
[1:58:47] another and peace talk of the world but
[1:58:51] when God calls a conference is
[1:58:54] fasting cleaning up
[1:58:58] prayer receiving orders and going
[1:59:01] forward that's God's conference not
[1:59:05] feasting but fasting not indulging in
[1:59:08] filth but
[1:59:10] separating cleansing yourself from all
[1:59:14] unrighteousness when you go before God
[1:59:18] cleaning yourself
[1:59:20] by faith through applying the hisop to
[1:59:23] the blood and cleansing your heart and
[1:59:27] walking before God for a conference
[1:59:30] that's the kind of conferences when you
[1:59:33] meet with God then God gives you orders
[1:59:37] then go you for and then you go forward
[1:59:41] praise be to
[1:59:43] God Amen the Pentecostal
[1:59:48] conference
[1:59:50] getting the Holy
[1:59:52] Ghost is not an
[1:59:57] option it's not I will think about it
[2:00:01] it's not when I feel like like
[2:00:05] it it's not I want to or I don't want
[2:00:12] to God sent down the Holy Ghost for you
[2:00:16] and
[2:00:18] me the Holy Ghost is looking for a
[2:00:21] dwelling
[2:00:24] place and the Holy Ghost dwells in our
[2:00:33] hearts the Bible says by one Spirit are
[2:00:36] we baptized into one
[2:00:40] body except you have the Holy
[2:00:46] Ghost you would surely perish

[2:01:22] Christ comes in the middle of the night
[2:01:24] I'll be
[2:01:26] gone it's times to be
[2:01:29] certain this is not a time of

[2:02:31] that is of an encouragement to you
[2:02:32] praise
[2:02:37] God if your eye would cause it your F
[2:02:40] plug it
[2:02:41] out and if your right hand will cause
[2:02:44] you to sin cut it

[2:03:07] God
[2:03:10] conference
[2:03:13] conference praise the
[2:03:16] lord and there is another conference
[2:03:20] that is the Judgment
[2:03:22] conference praise the Lord amen
[2:03:26] now of all these conferences I have had
[2:03:30] to skip some just for the sake of time
[2:03:34] of all these
[2:03:35] conferences you realize
[2:03:38] that you can have a
[2:03:43] choice now when we go back to the
[2:03:47] beginning
[2:03:49] there is no
[2:03:53] man that had a
[2:03:57] choice to come into this
[2:04:01] world other than the way God has
[2:04:03] ordained
[2:04:05] it of
[2:04:07] course we KN we know according to
[2:04:10] scripture it was not supposed to be the
[2:04:13] way it is today but because of the Fall
[2:04:16] God permitted it praise the Lord Lord
[2:04:20] and the Bible says every man is born a
[2:04:26] sinner every man every woman in sin did
[2:04:31] my mother conceive me and in iniquity
[2:04:34] was I shiing so before you came into
[2:04:37] this life you were already a
[2:04:39] sinner you had no choice about
[2:04:42] it that is why the prophet of God says
[2:04:46] that God would not condemn a man
[2:04:49] man for being a
[2:04:52] sinner but when you choose to remain a
[2:04:55] sinner right then God is going to
[2:04:57] condemn you because there is a provision
[2:05:01] now that has been
[2:05:05] made a provision has been
[2:05:09] made you didn't have a choice then but
[2:05:13] now you have a
[2:05:15] choice that you can choose to be free or
[2:05:18] you can choose to remain in your
[2:05:21] sins praise be to God and there is a
[2:05:24] judgment
[2:05:25] conference that is coming and in this
[2:05:28] conference all will be there as the song
[2:05:36] says there is a
[2:05:40] song all will be there in this judgment
[2:05:42] each one
[2:05:44] receiving praise the Lord I can just see
[2:05:48] the song hovering around
[2:05:50] here praise the
[2:05:52] Lord
[2:05:53] amen yes now
[2:05:57] remember
[2:06:01] remember that you as a child of
[2:06:05] God you are going through your judgment
[2:06:07] right
[2:06:10] now the bride of
[2:06:12] Christ would never go through that white
[2:06:16] Throne
[2:06:17] judgment
[2:06:20] because we are going through our
[2:06:22] judgment right
[2:06:26] now when Christ take his judgment seats
[2:06:30] his bride is going to be by his side
[2:06:34] amen and we are going to judge the world
[2:06:39] together but before that Throne of
[2:06:43] judgment would be all
[2:06:46] Sinners and the remnant
[2:06:49] of the church that didn't go in the
[2:06:51] Rapture that is another topic on his
[2:06:54] own praise the
[2:06:56] Lord in this judgment you have no
[2:07:01] choice you have no
[2:07:05] choice you would be there
[2:07:09] anyhow you will be there anyhow you have
[2:07:12] no choice to
[2:07:15] make this brings me back
[2:07:19] to the story I was sharing last week
[2:07:23] about the prophet talking about um John
[2:07:27] John Daniel
[2:07:30] Curry praise the
[2:07:32] Lord that this was a
[2:07:34] man that lived a Godly
[2:07:38] life a man that demonstrated the power
[2:07:42] of
[2:07:44] God a man that one soul
[2:07:49] to
[2:07:50] Christ he was a great
[2:07:54] evangelist and then he had a dream or a
[2:07:57] TR you would call it that he had died he
[2:08:01] got Before the Throne of
[2:08:04] God and the gatekeeper told him we can't
[2:08:07] find your name here oh there must be a
[2:08:10] mistake somewhere I am that great
[2:08:12] evangelist I want a lot of souls for
[2:08:14] Christ my name should be there he
[2:08:16] checked he said sir your name is not I
[2:08:18] can't find your name do you want to
[2:08:21] appeal your case before the great white
[2:08:22] Throne judgment he said yes I want to
[2:08:25] appeal my
[2:08:26] case and then in the story he was just
[2:08:30] going up and going up it was light it
[2:08:33] was light it was light he kept going and
[2:08:36] going and going till he got to that
[2:08:38] place it was just
[2:08:40] light thousand
[2:08:43] times stronger than the sun the light of
[2:08:46] the
[2:08:47] Sun the then he heard Daniel
[2:08:53] Curry did you ever tell a
[2:08:56] lie he thought he never did but in that
[2:09:01] light you would come
[2:09:05] clean yes I
[2:09:08] did Daniel Curry were you
[2:09:13] Faithful he Once Upon a Time thought he
[2:09:16] did no I was not faithful then carry and
[2:09:21] then he realized that
[2:09:23] no it was not what he thought it
[2:09:27] was and now he was just waiting for the
[2:09:30] final
[2:09:32] instruction you hypocrite come on go
[2:09:35] into hell and burn forever and then he
[2:09:38] just heard he just heard the sweetest
[2:09:43] voice the sweetest voice there could
[2:09:45] ever
[2:09:46] be praise be to God father he stood for
[2:09:51] me whil he was on Earth I stand for him
[2:09:56] praise be to
[2:09:58] God and the Bible says if the
[2:10:02] righteous
[2:10:04] scarly is scarely saved where would the
[2:10:08] Sinner and ungodly
[2:10:11] appear if the
[2:10:13] righteous is scarcely saved where with
[2:10:17] the sinners
[2:10:19] and the ungodly
[2:10:22] appear we are having a conference right
[2:10:24] now it's
[2:10:26] 103 I will not keep you here longer than
[2:10:29] um I promise I'll be ending very soon
[2:10:32] praise be to
[2:10:34] God when the
[2:10:37] righteous are scarcely
[2:10:41] saved where would the Sinners and
[2:10:43] ungodly
[2:10:46] appear but be before that Dreadful
[2:10:52] Day praise be to
[2:10:55] God God has sent us a
[2:11:01] message praise be to
[2:11:03] God we are serving a great and a
[2:11:06] wonderful
[2:11:08] God you are not here by
[2:11:11] accident it never was and it will never
[2:11:15] be you may not understand it you have to
[2:11:19] understand it if you can understand
[2:11:22] God the Bible says it's way our pass
[2:11:24] finding
[2:11:25] out can you imagine with our human brain
[2:11:29] we want to understand god Till some
[2:11:32] people even want to prove God in the
[2:11:39] laboratory I was listening to One space
[2:11:43] scientist I forgotten his name he wrote
[2:11:45] a book and he was saying that there was
[2:11:48] an interview he was having he said um
[2:11:51] there there is there is
[2:11:54] 95% of the
[2:11:56] things that they don't know
[2:11:59] about this is a space scientist he's
[2:12:02] gone to space and come back that there
[2:12:04] is 95% of the things they don't
[2:12:08] understand they don't know
[2:12:10] about and then he went on you will think
[2:12:13] that people that have gone up there and
[2:12:14] come down you will think that they are
[2:12:16] going to fear God more you will think
[2:12:18] that they are going to see the glory of
[2:12:19] God more but this man is a
[2:12:23] hidden today as we speak I don't know of
[2:12:26] tomorrow he may be a child of
[2:12:29] God he was saying that um those things
[2:12:33] uh and of the
[2:12:35] 5% they understand that he has realized
[2:12:40] that um if time goes on the 9 the 95% of
[2:12:46] the things we don't understand we will
[2:12:48] get to understand them and he was coming
[2:12:50] from the point that uh things they used
[2:12:53] not to understand before now they
[2:12:55] understand
[2:12:56] them and that is difficult to prove the
[2:12:59] existence of
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:04] God God is
[2:13:07] real you can never prove God in the
[2:13:11] laboratory God is real
[2:13:15] amen that is why the Bible says without
[2:13:18] faith it is impossible to please
[2:13:23] God and they that come must first
[2:13:26] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[2:13:29] them that diligently seek Him is by
[2:13:32] faith it's by
[2:13:34] faith we are called to Faith not to
[2:13:38] understand praise God if you understand
[2:13:42] praise God if you don't and that is
[2:13:44] where Faith K kicks
[2:13:46] in
[2:13:49] praise the Lord
[2:13:51] amen so but before this great judgment

[2:17:20] presidency in the K and he became the
[2:17:23] head of
[2:17:25] state and my dad went and wherever he
[2:17:27] dug that picture from he dug it out see
[2:17:32] I took a picture with him see we were
[2:17:34] friends and they used to have a j on
[2:17:37] because he was half Scottish and then he
[2:17:40] would tell my dad ab ab ab ab B B is in
[2:17:45] in how means white man and my dad will
[2:17:47] say no you not be B that means you're
[2:17:49] not a white man so they had that J on
[2:17:51] they were they just had that
[2:17:54] relationship so my dad took it out and
[2:17:56] showed it to us and then we go to the go
[2:17:59] to school oh yes he's a friend to my dad
[2:18:02] so no oh yeah he took a picture to my
[2:18:04] dad and then we're also bragging about
[2:18:06] it praise the Lord now this man comes to
[2:18:11] salaga a place in the northern region
[2:18:13] where we were and then my dad told the
[2:18:17] family
[2:18:18] that Rollins is coming here
[2:18:20] today and then you know when they even
[2:18:23] go on uh retirement they still have some
[2:18:26] of their old uniforms that they can put
[2:18:28] on to frighten the people in the street
[2:18:31] so um he put on his old uniform dressed
[2:18:36] he said I'm going to meet him and we
[2:18:38] were all happy because we knew that if
[2:18:41] Daddy should be able to meet the head of
[2:18:43] state our lives would
[2:18:46] change and then he goes to where he was
[2:18:50] camping in that district and guess what
[2:18:54] these are Cuban trained
[2:18:56] Commandos will not allow
[2:18:58] him he said no we were friends in the
[2:19:01] Army he showed them his picture and they
[2:19:04] saw it but they will not allow him to
[2:19:06] come
[2:19:08] in daddy came back and he was very
[2:19:12] disappointed we also got very
[2:19:14] disappointed because we thought it was
[2:19:16] going to change our lives
[2:19:20] and who
[2:19:21] knows I don't think he would have
[2:19:23] forgotten of him though but it was
[2:19:26] possible that he was going to see him
[2:19:28] and still
[2:19:31] forget but
[2:19:33] here we are not talking about a
[2:19:36] one-sided
[2:19:38] conference a conference that you would
[2:19:42] attend and by the time that conference
[2:19:44] is over your host has even forgotten you
[2:19:48] were
[2:19:49] there that only you have a good memory
[2:19:54] of that
[2:19:55] conference and your host has
[2:19:59] forgotten that they ever met you and
[2:20:02] only you have a picture of them with you
[2:20:06] and you go bragging about them and they
[2:20:08] don't even know you
[2:20:10] exist but we are talking about a
[2:20:13] conference that when you go to that
[2:20:16] conference
[2:20:18] that your
[2:20:20] host brags more about you than you brag
[2:20:24] about
[2:20:25] them that you have a
[2:20:28] picture that you attended that
[2:20:31] conference and your host also has a
[2:20:34] picture am as a matter of fact the best
[2:20:38] of the
[2:20:39] pictures that you are in the conference
[2:20:41] with
[2:20:42] him that when you are in the street and
[2:20:46] you are break in about him you are
[2:20:48] preaching about him you are blessing his
[2:20:51] name you are glorifying his name that he
[2:20:54] is of there and he looks down and he's
[2:20:57] also bragging about you and his angels
[2:21:01] are just around you keeping you that
[2:21:04] there is a constant relationship that he
[2:21:07] never forgets about you he never forgets
[2:21:11] about you his eyes are upon you by day
[2:21:14] and by night and he thinks of you every
[2:21:18] single day what put job into
[2:21:23] trouble it was because God was bragging
[2:21:27] about
[2:21:29] him when the children of God
[2:21:32] guarded the devil came
[2:21:35] in the devil was not part of the
[2:21:38] meeting right he had to be given
[2:21:41] audience to
[2:21:44] speak and God told him have you you
[2:21:48] noticed that of all that are on earth
[2:21:52] there is none like my servant
[2:21:54] job God
[2:21:58] bragging true about his
[2:22:01] own not a onesided
[2:22:05] conference a conference where God is
[2:22:07] calling you come and let us risen
[2:22:15] together come let us re
[2:22:18] together though your
[2:22:20] sins be as Scarlet they be as white as
[2:22:23] snow though they be red as Crimson they
[2:22:26] will be as
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:30] wool now when you go back to Isaiah 1
[2:22:35] which we read we didn't start from the
[2:22:37] first verse we started from 15 to 18 you
[2:22:41] can go back and read from the starting
[2:22:43] um from from the verse one you would
[2:22:45] realize that they were not a people God
[2:22:47] was happy
[2:22:52] with everything Isaiah was talking about
[2:22:55] and prophesying it was against the
[2:22:57] people God was not happy with their
[2:22:59] lives they had turned their backs on
[2:23:03] God they were not doing what God wanted
[2:23:06] them to do they were not living the
[2:23:10] life they had embraced sin and they has
[2:23:13] cast go they had cast God
[2:23:15] out God was not happy with
[2:23:18] them and you would think that God was
[2:23:22] going to say fire upon these people and
[2:23:25] God gets to this place and God says
[2:23:30] come in spite of your sins come let us
[2:23:33] reason together in spite of your
[2:23:35] iniquities come let us reason together
[2:23:39] in spite of your difficulties come let
[2:23:41] us reason together it is time to reason
[2:23:44] together it's time to reason together
[2:23:51] praise the
[2:23:54] Lord and when I was listening to the
[2:23:57] song leader this morning he got to a
[2:24:00] place he said don't let him pass you by
[2:24:03] and I had that down
[2:24:04] here that don't let him pass you

[2:27:50] there will be a great white Throne
[2:27:52] judgment
[2:27:54] set um God has permitted His prophets to
[2:27:59] look in and said the books were opened
[2:28:04] and another book which is The Book of
[2:28:07] Life then 10,000 times
[2:28:11] 10,000s of ministers and angels
[2:28:16] ministered to him then it was
[2:28:19] written if the righteous be scarly
[2:28:23] saved where will the Sinner and ungodly
[2:28:28] appear what will be your stand at that
[2:28:34] conference you might have bypassed all
[2:28:37] of them down through your life you may
[2:28:41] walk out of this door this
[2:28:44] morning and bypass this one
[2:28:47] one but my friend you will never bypass
[2:28:51] that
[2:28:52] one you are going to be

[2:28:58] to die but after that the

[2:29:09] and we all give an
[2:29:12] account for this morning of this Earthly
[2:29:15] conference
[2:29:17] that we've held this morning the
[2:29:19] musicians can come over praise the
[2:29:23] Lord praise the Lord amen
[2:29:27] so there
[2:29:29] is a last
[2:29:34] conference that is going to
[2:29:39] be and it's going to be a a
[2:29:43] terrible conference if you have not
[2:29:45] accepted Christ
[2:29:50] the only
[2:29:52] thing the only
[2:29:54] thing that would provide us with a way
[2:29:57] of
[2:29:59] Escape is the
[2:30:02] blood the
[2:30:05] blood the blood of our
[2:30:09] Redemption the blood of the Lord Jesus
[2:30:11] Christ that is the only way out that is
[2:30:15] the only ESC
[2:30:19] route that is the only Escape Route God
[2:30:23] has given to
[2:30:25] humanity for there is no
[2:30:28] human that can come in their personal
[2:30:31] righteousness Before the Throne of God
[2:30:33] you can't you dare
[2:30:36] not we are coming in the righteousness
[2:30:40] of our Lord and our savior Jesus for he
[2:30:43] alone died for us he alone let his night
[2:30:46] die done for us he alone took our place
[2:30:48] on the
[2:30:51] cross he is the Lamb of our
[2:30:56] sacrifice and that sacrifice was a
[2:30:59] worthy
[2:31:01] sacrifice once you accept him God is not
[2:31:05] looking at what you used to be God as a
[2:31:08] matter of fact is not even looking at
[2:31:10] what you are today he is looking at the
[2:31:13] blood if you have truly accepted Christ
[2:31:18] CHR praise be to God when God looks down
[2:31:23] and he sees your cry he sees your cry
[2:31:26] through the
[2:31:29] blood what a merciful father he
[2:31:33] is that is the only Escape Route you and
[2:31:36] I have which is the blood of the Lord
[2:31:39] Jesus Christ and we are talking of the
[2:31:42] life in the blood the Holy Ghost
[2:31:45] baptism for there is life in the blood
