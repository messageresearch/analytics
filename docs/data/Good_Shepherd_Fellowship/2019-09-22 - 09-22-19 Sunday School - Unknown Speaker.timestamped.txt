[1:32] was a wonderful moment you know I always
[1:35] had you know wise don't have very big
[1:39] weddings normally a small wedding but I
[1:42] was surprised between 250 and 300 people
[1:47] not surprising they were saying that was
[1:51] probably the wedding the wedding of the
[1:54] season and whatever they said yeah so it
[1:57] was so wonderful and I had to read some
[2:01] scriptures they requested that I did it
[2:04] and I brought up the set a few things I
[2:08] don't even remember everything I said
[2:12] but it was just so amazing after the
[2:16] program you know people were just
[2:18] looking for me here and there telling me
[2:20] how they felt so blessed and I was just
[2:24] amazed you know how God does things so
[2:28] god bless you of your prayers we went
[2:30] and we are back
[2:32] praise God so by the grace of God we are
[2:36] still looking at our topic prayer we
[2:44] were probably supposed to be closing the
[2:49] chapter on this topic but but I want as
[2:54] I we stay on this topic for a little
[2:57] while maybe do a revision so we are
[3:04] going to do some little revision I don't
[3:08] know how is going to go but I'm trusting
[3:11] that God would glorify himself in all of
[3:15] this praise the Lord so for everything I
[3:21] want us to take look 22
[3:39] you
[3:44] Luke 22:31 32 and a lot said Simon Simon
[4:01] behold Satan have desired to have you
[4:05] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[4:08] prayed for thee that I faith fail not
[4:12] and when thou art converted strengthen
[4:14] thy brethren praise be to God Satan has
[4:24] desired to have you better have prayed
[4:28] that your faith fail not but when thou
[4:34] art converted strengthen thy brethren
[4:36] now I have prayed for thee I have prayed
[4:46] for thee this is what I want us to have
[4:49] at the back of our minds as we look at
[4:52] this scripture I have prayed for thee
[4:54] this reminds me of father song brother
[4:58] one taught us last two weeks ago was the
[5:01] last three weeks ago and while somebody
[5:03] prayed for you somebody had you in his
[5:05] mind and he prayed for you it was a
[5:09] wonderful song when we got home my song
[5:13] leader in the house for every devotion
[5:16] you bring that song off every devotee
[5:18] who bring that song up and every day he
[5:21] was up and down singing that song I
[5:23] wasn't surprised he came to church and
[5:25] he had to sing a special and it was a
[5:28] special somebody prayed for you and for
[5:33] all of us somebody prayed for us
[5:37] somebody had it in his mind or in her
[5:40] mind somebody prayed for you Jesus told
[5:45] Peter I have prayed for thee that thy
[5:47] faith fail not I have prayed for thee
[5:53] all of us have come this far because
[5:56] somebody had us on their mind
[5:59] and somebody prayed for us praise be to
[6:03] God last month when I stood behind there
[6:07] and I was listening to brother Ezekiel
[6:09] giving his testimony I said to myself
[6:13] I said somebody prayed for him whether
[6:18] that he was praying or mommy was praying
[6:20] or pasta was praying or the church was
[6:22] praying or SISTAR's brother was praying
[6:25] somebody prayed for him because a man
[6:30] that has gone through all that and can
[6:33] still be a good testimony in the
[6:35] household of God
[6:36] somebody must have prayed for him praise
[6:39] be to God Peter I have prayed for thee
[6:43] that I faithful not remember we are so
[6:48] talking about prayer sometimes we do not
[6:53] live long enough to see when our prayers
[6:58] have been answered
[6:59] but in a prayer that is said in faith I
[7:03] can assure you even though we would die
[7:07] and go that prayer has been said in
[7:10] faith would put go to work and God will
[7:14] still be working praise be to God I
[7:17] don't care what it is that happens our
[7:23] players would never go in vain if that
[7:27] prayer is said in faith said by faith
[7:32] let's Christ hurry let us die and go
[7:38] that prayer is going to be answered will
[7:41] not only be here to see when it is been
[7:44] answered by praise be to God one day we
[7:48] would know that the prayer was answered
[7:51] somebody how do you honest mind somebody
[7:57] prayed for you somebody
[8:02] prayed for you you know for all of us
[8:06] somebody is keeping us in prayer you may
[8:12] never get to know who is praying for you
[8:16] you may never get to know but somebody
[8:20] is praying for you that is why we have
[8:23] all come this far
[8:25] praise be to God I can give my personal
[8:30] testimony when I was at my lowest low my
[8:35] lowest low I had a dream one day that a
[8:40] raptor took place and I didn't make it
[8:43] in the rapture and I got so terrified in
[8:47] a dream where a group of people just
[8:51] running up and down just running up and
[8:53] down and then we met this brother a
[8:57] minister and we met him and all of us
[9:01] just run to him and when we got there
[9:04] and we are calling his name and calling
[9:06] his name that he stood and was looking
[9:08] at us and then I remember probably 16 17
[9:12] 18 years ago remember and then he
[9:14] pointed at me and pray there are two
[9:17] other people and he asked us to go and
[9:19] appeal for our case and the rest go away
[9:23] so as I started walking I got to a place
[9:27] and I opened my eyes and I said wow so
[9:32] it was a dream
[9:33] praise God it was a dream in fact if I
[9:39] was a movie actor you couldn't pay me 1
[9:43] million dollars to just act that part of
[9:47] the movie I know is nothing but fiction
[9:51] just pretend I oh yes you couldn't pay
[9:57] me 1 million to act that order of the
[10:02] second place I didn't make it you
[10:03] couldn't pay me 1 million dollars to do
[10:05] it it's a terrible moment and
[10:12] a year or two years later again I had a
[10:14] dream hour somewhere and this same
[10:19] brother I peered again yes what straight
[10:24] to me and he stood and he was looking
[10:26] into my face
[10:27] and I was looking at him you could see
[10:30] who was angry and then he turned to go
[10:32] away then I caught his name I say you
[10:35] can't go this way then he stood and he
[10:38] came back and then he said I would never
[10:42] remember I would never forget praise be
[10:44] to God he said until you are ready
[10:48] God is not ready but when you are ready
[10:52] God is ready
[10:54] praise be to God and this is somebody I
[10:59] know it's always praying for me he never
[11:04] told me nobody ever told me but I know
[11:08] it and God showed it to me you may never
[11:11] get to know who they are but somebody is
[11:15] keeping you before the turn of God by
[11:18] day and by night and we also owe it a
[11:23] duty to our loved ones we owe it a duty
[11:28] to also bear somebody up in prayer
[11:33] freely have you received and freely give
[11:37] we also owe it a duty to bear orders one
[11:42] another before the throne of grace of
[11:46] God praise be to God somebody is praying
[11:57] for you whoever they are I don't know
[12:00] wherever they are I don't know
[12:04] but certainly somebody somewhere is
[12:07] praying for you and you ought to be
[12:11] praying for somebody - you ought to be
[12:14] praying for somebody - if you are not
[12:17] doing it there is something wrong
[12:20] somewhere praise be to God
[12:26] when you read acts 12 want to take him
[12:34] we are not going to read that for the
[12:37] sake of time but let's just take one or
[12:40] two verses from day acts 12 one acts 12
[12:52] one probably we can skip and then get to
[12:57] the sixth get to verse 6 X 12 6 and when
[13:02] Herod would have brought him forth the
[13:06] same night Peter was sleeping between
[13:08] two soldiers bound with two chains and
[13:12] the keepers before the door kept the
[13:15] prison and before the angel of the Lord
[13:17] came upon him and a light shined in the
[13:22] prison and his smoke Peter on the side
[13:25] and rest him off saying arise up quickly
[13:28] and his chains fell off from his hands
[13:31] and the angel said unto Him did I self
[13:35] and bind on thy son das and so he did
[13:38] and he said unto Him coz I commend abadi
[13:42] and follow me and as you read on Peter
[13:46] was led out of the prison what happen
[13:52] here
[13:52] Herod the king after he laid his hands
[13:56] on James and killed him and he started
[13:59] the Jews were happy he went ahead and he
[14:02] took Peter put him in prison waiting for
[14:08] the deaths of the unleavened bread to be
[14:10] over and he will bring him before the
[14:12] public but this time this time their
[14:17] brother said no enough is enough
[14:19] and they decided to pray for Peter a
[14:24] prayer was being offered should I take
[14:28] that part I think I jumped too much I
[14:31] jumped that a
[14:37] so
[14:46] what part is that why the believers
[14:48] prayed five praise be to God Peter
[14:52] therefore was kept in prison but prayer
[14:56] was made without season of the church
[14:59] unto God for him the believers said no
[15:06] enough is enough
[15:07] and asura pray for Peter because they
[15:12] knew the Herod was going to kill him the
[15:15] same way he killed James and that night
[15:19] he was lying down he did not even care
[15:22] about what was going on because he was
[15:25] asleep he was asleep he didn't care Paul
[15:30] said for me to live is Christ and to die
[15:31] is gain if you had child of God death
[15:37] doesn't mean anything to you it doesn't
[15:43] matter whether you live or you die
[15:47] make sure that you are in the will of
[15:49] God make sure that your life is in
[15:54] accordance with the word make sure that
[15:57] you have this testimony that you please
[15:59] God it doesn't matter whether you live
[16:03] it doesn't matter what he died he was
[16:06] asleep was changed
[16:08] then when the Saint said no we want our
[16:13] Arabic and he prayed the angel came down
[16:17] that night the light shone in the room
[16:20] he's changed further off he was led out
[16:23] of the prison that doors open praise be
[16:26] to God why because somebody was praying
[16:31] for him somebody was praying for him
[16:36] somebody had it on their mind to pray
[16:40] for him and obey Him in prayer follow me
[16:43] as we go along you may not know why I'm
[16:46] doing this but in a minute or two you'll
[16:49] get to know praise be to God
[17:01] last Wednesday when we came for Prius
[17:04] I was excited when burello I began to
[17:08] pray for sis quiche I didn't even know
[17:11] she was admitted to the hospital again
[17:13] and something just struck me from
[17:17] Wednesday up until this morning
[17:19] something hasn't been very right with me
[17:22] and I just kept thinking and then
[17:25] brother Scott came and then he gave a
[17:27] testimony and rather one came over and
[17:31] then he gave us a report about his case
[17:35] and just one thing I saw that the Holy
[17:43] Spirit had made a move and when you see
[17:48] the Spirit of God move and God gives you
[17:53] enough grace identify it all you have to
[17:57] do is just follow go in line praise be
[18:02] to God God is going to do something our
[18:07] God is a prayer answering God we have
[18:11] not believed in vain now I want you to
[18:16] think of it for a moment pain we all
[18:21] know ken was that of Adam Cain was a
[18:26] seed of the serpent but look at Cain
[18:32] after he had killed his brother and then
[18:37] he was afraid somebody would see him and
[18:40] then take his life and he cried out to
[18:43] God what did God do even the Serpent's
[18:48] seed the serpent seed who killed girls
[18:52] own son
[18:54] God had him that bird granted unto him
[18:59] the desire of his heart to live and God
[19:02] said that and a body would slay of say
[19:05] who slay earth King
[19:08] shall be avenged sevenfold Sevenfold and
[19:18] this is the seed of the serpent we are
[19:20] talking about God granted it look at the
[19:31] man of God ara who was possessed by
[19:35] unclean spirits who was living in the
[19:38] tombs and everybody feared him you put
[19:42] him burning with any chain he would
[19:44] break it he was strong
[19:47] nobody could tame him but when Jesus
[19:51] came his way the Bible says when he saw
[19:54] him afar he bowed and he worshiped him
[19:58] praise be to God and the demons cried
[20:02] out what have you to do with us what
[20:08] have you got to do with us
[20:11] have you come to punish us before our
[20:13] day and when Jesus asked who his name
[20:18] was he said we are many that my name is
[20:21] legion because we are many and just
[20:28] listen the demons now speaking telling
[20:33] Jesus not to cast them into the outer
[20:36] country but to cause them in the pigs in
[20:39] the in the in the end in the in the
[20:42] group of pigs to cut them into the pigs
[20:45] and Jesus grunted and these were demos
[20:51] that was is speaking jesus granted it go
[20:57] you have it and they went to enter the
[20:59] pigs and into the sea they went and it
[21:01] all perished
[21:05] even Satan our enemy when he received
[21:13] the angels in heaven to wage war against
[21:17] God because he wanted to pitch his
[21:19] throne about the turn of God and
[21:21] to be worshipped instead of God God and
[21:26] his angels fought against him and cast
[21:27] him down what was sitting looking for
[21:30] worship he wanted to become God he
[21:33] wanted to be wash it in place of God God
[21:37] said no not here but here on earth has
[21:40] he achieved it or not he is the god of
[21:43] this earth if God will listen to demons
[21:50] and greater wishes and what Satan wanted
[21:53] in heaven didn't get if God would allow
[21:55] him to get it here if Cain the seed of
[21:58] the serpent would cry out to God and
[22:01] bird would hear him and then say that
[22:05] anybody who kills Cain shall be Avenged
[22:08] Sevenfold so granting protection how
[22:13] much would God do for his elect praise
[22:17] be to God how much more would God do for
[22:20] his elect for his own sons and daughters
