[24:52] gracious to us on on sunday
[24:55] and uh for blessing us with
[24:58] his presence and the service we
[25:01] appreciate the lord for that
[25:03] there were a few things that i mean the
[25:06] lord himself just put in order to have
[25:08] the service go
[25:09] right because only him can bring it
[25:12] outright praise the lord
[25:14] and i was actually thinking on that
[25:16] message
[25:18] why it had to be shepherds remember
[25:22] i was speaking a few time in the weekend
[25:26] i talked
[25:26] something about the shepherds you know
[25:29] the shepherd king
[25:32] the the shepherd prophet you've seen
[25:34] that message brother branham
[25:38] said that so i will encourage you to
[25:41] listen out for that
[25:43] and see the way he plays some of those
[25:45] few things but that's what i was
[25:47] actually thinking for
[25:49] our christmas message and then
[25:53] on my way to church i heard that heard
[25:55] the
[25:57] technicians playing that message and i
[26:00] just thought wow
[26:01] i mean it's just it's just
[26:04] it's just the lord amen is just the lord
[26:08] praise the lord amen
[26:10] and i mean the lord just have a few
[26:13] things
[26:14] just to be able to to bless us and
[26:18] and make things come a right but i would
[26:20] love for us to
[26:21] play that message as they are playing it
[26:24] and and also you have time listening to
[26:26] it
[26:27] uh if we have the opportunity that's why
[26:30] we will speak on
[26:31] for our christmas message there are some
[26:33] few things i want to bring in light
[26:35] of what brother branham said in that
[26:36] message and
[26:42] and then also i want to encourage the
[26:44] church
[26:47] [Music]
[26:48] as we on the countdown
[26:52] to the end of this year i would just
[26:56] want us to
[26:56] [Music]
[26:58] take uh this time
[27:01] and the rest of the time that is before
[27:03] us
[27:05] if the law can be able to burden your
[27:07] heart to
[27:08] [Music]
[27:10] find a time to pray concentrate yourself
[27:12] that would be a good thing to do
[27:15] and brother branham says something i was
[27:19] reading
[27:20] this quote and it kind of uh uh
[27:23] it caught my mind something something
[27:25] came out of it that uh that i never saw
[27:27] before
[27:29] uh or that i was not looking in that
[27:32] direction
[27:32] he said he will not post it up
[27:36] he said ask the person sit down this
[27:40] is healing what sickness
[27:43] is the person who won't settle down
[27:48] we are in no hurry asked him
[27:51] he says that's what the matter with the
[27:54] word today
[27:55] we are too much of a rush he says
[27:59] businessmen take inventory
[28:02] of yourself before god sometimes when
[28:05] the meeting goes
[28:06] over an hour on an hour and 10 minutes
[28:09] oh mine
[28:10] what kind of a meeting remember
[28:13] he says remember how long you
[28:17] you are here and and then he goes on to
[28:20] say
[28:22] that if if we haven't got
[28:26] faith enough for healing
[28:29] of our bodies listen to this now
[28:32] if we haven't got faith enough
[28:36] for healing of our bodies
[28:39] how you going to go
[28:43] in the rapture
[28:44] [Music]
[28:46] he says because this mortar must
[28:49] take on immortality now so you see
[28:53] what we need is not healing
[28:55] [Music]
[28:57] what we need is faith for healing
[29:03] praise the lord amen
[29:08] i don't know what maybe maybe i'm the
[29:09] one but uh
[29:11] i mean when i read the code i just it
[29:13] just caught my attention
[29:15] you know most of the time we put the
[29:18] emphasis
[29:18] on healing praise the lord
[29:23] now what we need is faith
[29:27] because it would not be healing that
[29:29] would take us
[29:30] in the rapture it would be faith that
[29:32] would take us in the rapture
[29:36] amen so if if if
[29:40] if we have if if we are building our
[29:42] faith
[29:43] even if we don't have the
[29:46] the healing there were people that
[29:49] experienced
[29:50] healing that did not have faith
[29:54] there are people that experience divine
[29:56] healing
[29:57] that benefit from the faith of the
[29:59] congregation
[30:01] that benefit from the faith that is
[30:03] created in the meeting
[30:05] praise the lord so the emphasis
[30:08] is on faith and faith cometh
[30:12] by hearing so in one sense brother
[30:15] branham is saying here
[30:17] when it comes to the word that build our
[30:20] faith
[30:20] let us not be in a rush
[30:22] [Music]
[30:24] if you are reading the word whether at
[30:28] home
[30:28] or in church don't be in a raj because
[30:31] that's the thing it takes to build your
[30:34] faith
[30:38] praise the lord amen
[30:42] so the emphasis is on faith
[30:45] we need enough faith praise the lord and
[30:49] but but what i'm talking about tonight
[30:52] is to kind of
[30:53] encourage us to use this time
[30:56] and rest of the week to to take an
[30:58] inventory
[31:00] of ourself let's let's uh
[31:04] let's give ourselves you know give
[31:06] ourselves

[31:13] strike amen
[31:14] what we want to do is that we want to we
[31:17] want to take an inventory we want to
[31:18] look at those areas
[31:20] in our life where we need god to help us
[31:23] we want to pay attention those things
[31:25] that are causing destruction
[31:27] and are taking much time much of our
[31:30] time
[31:32] we want to sit down a little bit
[31:33] [Music]
[31:35] we want to look at it we want to just

[49:35] praise the lord
[49:38] amen praise the lord now so
[49:42] uh tonight i i just want to i want to
[49:45] step back a little bit in
[49:47] and uh and and be able to
[49:50] to uh just do a little review and go
[49:54] back to some of the few things
[49:56] that we were talking about now now
[49:59] uh uh brother harold baker over in south
[50:03] africa
[50:04] he have this this saying you know every
[50:07] time he talks about every time he speaks
[50:10] most every time you you hear him use
[50:12] this saying he says uh
[50:15] he says if there was no serpent see
[50:17] there will be no new birth
[50:19] he said the seventh sea makes a way for
[50:22] the new birth
[50:23] praise the lord amen because the reason
[50:27] why we had to be born again
[50:29] is because uh of the serpent seed amen
[50:34] so uh uh sunday we were we were trying
[50:38] to look at
[50:40] um you know uh few things in the
[50:43] scripture
[50:45] and uh we were looking at the the
[50:48] terrestrial body
[50:50] the celestial body and the glorified
[50:53] body
[50:55] praise the lord uh
[50:58] we were looking at uh the terrestrial
[51:02] body
[51:03] which is the ethnic body the celestial
[51:06] body
[51:07] which is the heavenly body and the
[51:10] glorified body
[51:12] praise the lord amen
[51:16] and uh
[51:23] so as as we look at that
[51:26] we started talking from genesis chapter
[51:29] one
[51:29] we look at genesis chapter one god made
[51:32] man in his
[51:32] image which was a spirit man and we said
[51:36] that there was the celestial body
[51:41] amen and then god came down and made man
[51:44] out of the dust of the earth that was
[51:46] the terrestrial body are we together
[51:51] now uh uh
[51:54] on the brother brandon ministry he
[51:57] he he helped us to be able to see
[52:00] uh in the scripture
[52:08] i'm i'm i'm kind of trying not to go in
[52:11] to
[52:13] take you through a kind of a
[52:17] long route here for the wednesday night
[52:19] because uh
[52:21] uh they are just a lot of things on my
[52:23] mind
[52:24] but we we we saw like like when we talk
[52:27] about
[52:28] abraham uh the father of faith
[52:31] god established with abraham and the way
[52:35] that he dealt with abraham brother
[52:37] branham says that's the way he's going
[52:39] to deal with abraham's seed
[52:41] amen and in his visitation to abraham
[52:47] we we we can see through the scripture
[52:49] from genesis chapter 12
[52:52] and over to genesis chapter 18
[52:56] there were seven visitations
[53:00] seven visitation seven seven different
[53:02] times
[53:03] that god visited abraham and in those
[53:07] seven
[53:07] visitation there were two visitation
[53:11] where god took a form
[53:15] praise the lord amen now you're
[53:18] you know you you just follow me in a
[53:20] little bit here
[53:22] and and and just like we said uh
[53:25] uh you know uh we read the scripture
[53:28] we talked about where paul went to the
[53:31] tear heavens
[53:33] and we seized the other john
[53:36] uh uh you know the apostle john that
[53:39] wrote the book of
[53:40] uh revelation the book of saint john
[53:44] first john ii john t
[53:45] john brother branham said he was also
[53:48] caught up
[53:48] just like paul was caught up amen
[53:52] so there were three men you know in the
[53:55] history of the scripture
[53:57] that were caught up into the heavens
[54:01] that's paul that's john and there's
[54:04] brother branham praise the lord amen
[54:09] and and uh uh we also talked about
[54:13] uh uh the first resurrection and second
[54:16] resurrection we will come to death
[54:18] but what i want what i wanted to show to
[54:20] us today
[54:21] is that uh to see how god
[54:28] put in man he he locked in man
[54:33] a mystery of himself
[54:36] praise the lord amen he locked in man a
[54:40] mystery of himself he gave
[54:42] man soul body and spirit
[54:45] praise the lord they soul body and
[54:48] spirit that we have
[54:49] uh i mean in this body this is my body
[54:52] you know i have a spirit i have a soul
[54:54] that is inside that is the nature of my
[54:56] spirit now so
[54:58] and and and that is the same way
[55:01] god in his manifestation
[55:04] manifested himself as father son
[55:08] and the holy ghost praise the lord
[55:11] amen now we have to realize
[55:15] that this god that we worship is not a
[55:18] one that we have made
[55:21] amen we have not made god with our
[55:24] understanding of the bible he has made
[55:26] us
[55:29] and until we leave from here to go to be
[55:32] with him
[55:33] there is more of him that we will learn
[55:36] every day
[55:37] praise the lord there is more of him
[55:39] that he will keep
[55:40] revealing to us and keep on falling to
[55:43] us
[55:45] praise the lord now so we see here that
[55:49] god like i said on sunday when he made
[55:52] that declaration
[55:54] let us make man in our image
[55:57] he started out of our trouble praise the
[56:00] lord but yet
[56:03] there was something that he was going to
[56:05] unfold it's
[56:06] it's beautiful if the law would just be
[56:08] able to help us be young myself
[56:10] and uh there were there were things that
[56:13] he was going to bring out to help he
[56:15] made man in his image a spirit man
[56:17] and then genesis chapter two he came
[56:19] down and made
[56:20] man out of the dust of the earth praise
[56:22] the lord and
[56:24] and uh so we see that there there's
[56:27] there's two form and the reason why
[56:30] is because god would deal with us in
[56:33] that way
[56:36] praise the lord he would deal with us in
[56:39] that way
[56:41] now after the flood and god will
[56:44] establish a covenant with our father
[56:47] abraham
[56:49] he gave abraham a word come out of your
[56:51] father house
[56:53] and make you the father of nation go to
[56:55] a land
[56:56] whose mirror and builder is god we know
[56:59] that was the inspiration of abraham's
[57:01] heart
[57:02] praise the lord he heard the voice of
[57:05] god
[57:05] just like faith cometh by hearing
[57:09] amen and and abraham pick up and he
[57:12] started to travel
[57:14] but yet in this walk god will deal with
[57:17] him
[57:18] in different manifestation
[57:22] praise the lord he would deal with him
[57:25] in different manifestation
[57:27] visions god would deal with him with
[57:29] visions god would speak to him he would
[57:31] hear the voice of god
[57:33] he would capture it by faith just like
[57:35] god speaks to you
[57:37] it's not audible but you can capture it
[57:39] by faith
[57:40] you're having a little attention when
[57:42] you tone yourself up in prayer
[57:45] and you tune yourself up in the word of
[57:47] god when god speaks
[57:48] you can be able to capture that little
[57:50] voice of god
[57:52] praise the lord amen so he he
[57:56] he would deal with our father abraham
[57:58] that way he would deal with him by
[58:00] visions
[58:01] and different manifestations he would
[58:03] give to abraham
[58:06] but there was another manifestation
[58:10] two major manifestation one was
[58:13] in genesis chapter 15. let's read there
[58:19] genesis chapter 15.
[58:29] praise the lord genesis chapter 15
[58:35] genesis chapter 15 verse
[58:39] 18. genesis chapter 15 verse 18.
[59:01] praise the lord are we together
[59:12] now we see here that
[59:16] god has just called abraham out
[59:24] he have just called abraham out and he
[59:26] have just
[59:28] he have just
[59:31] took abraham to the place no i'm
[59:34] giving you the wrong scripture it is now
[59:36] 15 is 14
[59:39] is genesis chapter 14.
[59:47] genesis chapter 14 verse 18.
[59:51] now so we see here uh this was
[59:54] after abraham went to to uh to rescue
[59:58] lot and
[1:00:00] and the king of sodom praise the lord
[1:00:03] which of course brother branham over and
[1:00:06] over
[1:00:07] he he lacking there to go in after
[1:00:10] a falling brother amen
[1:00:14] the part of god like the bible says
[1:00:16] there is only one mediator
[1:00:19] between man and god amen
[1:00:22] the man christ jesus and the scripture
[1:00:25] says
[1:00:26] that uh uh you know is is
[1:00:30] god reconciling us back to jesus christ
[1:00:34] amen so that ministry of reconciliation
[1:00:39] is not the one of going out to pass
[1:00:42] tracks
[1:00:43] amen no it's not the one to invite
[1:00:46] people to our church
[1:00:49] but the one that goes out
[1:00:52] for the sole purpose of the saving
[1:00:55] of a soul it has to be god
[1:01:00] but ram says when man fell in the
[1:01:02] beginning god never sent an angel
[1:01:06] amen he came down himself
[1:01:11] praise the lord he was the one saying
[1:01:14] adam
[1:01:14] adam where are you the ability to
[1:01:18] reconcile
[1:01:19] men back to god is not the ability of
[1:01:23] a man it has to be god
[1:01:30] are we together now so
[1:01:33] brother branham lacking this efficient
[1:01:36] parallel joshua over and over
[1:01:38] you will see how he lacking this this
[1:01:40] experience
[1:01:41] abraham going after lot
[1:01:44] you have to realize lord has already
[1:01:46] gone to sodom
[1:01:47] he has settled down in sodom i mean he's
[1:01:50] living there happily
[1:01:51] now sodom has been captured abraham
[1:01:53] heard about
[1:01:54] it and he's going there he i'm the man
[1:01:57] of his house
[1:01:58] to go and and bring ba and bring lot
[1:02:02] back not only a lot but just to be able
[1:02:06] to save the people
[1:02:07] out of the hands of the the their
[1:02:10] captives amen
[1:02:11] now so we see here after
[1:02:14] abraham did that
[1:02:19] in the way that it moves
[1:02:24] god the bible says
[1:02:27] he came down amen verse 18 14
[1:02:31] 18 the the the the the the scripture
[1:02:34] will now speak of mecidic
[1:02:38] the king of salon brought for bread and
[1:02:41] wine
[1:02:42] and he was the priest of the
[1:02:46] most high god and he blessed him
[1:02:50] and said blessed be abraham of the most
[1:02:53] high god
[1:02:54] possessor of heaven and earth
[1:02:57] and he blessed and and and blessed be
[1:03:00] the most high god which have uh
[1:03:03] delivered an enemies into
[1:03:05] thy hand and he gave him
[1:03:08] tithe of all abraham was the one giving
[1:03:10] him in tired of all amen
[1:03:12] and the kingdom of sodom said unto
[1:03:15] abraham
[1:03:16] give me the person and take the ghost
[1:03:19] okay then we we know the rest of the
[1:03:21] story
[1:03:21] but after abraham has gone out
[1:03:24] and rescued now god explained
[1:03:29] the plan of redemption in a shadow
[1:03:33] praise the lord
[1:03:37] in the message communion brother branham
[1:03:38] says this was
[1:03:40] the battle of life god
[1:03:44] is playing the plan of redemption in a
[1:03:47] shadow
[1:03:48] now so after abraham went out and
[1:03:51] and he redeemed a lord and and the king
[1:03:54] of sodom and the people of sodom from
[1:03:56] the hands
[1:03:57] of those that captured them god came in
[1:04:00] a form
[1:04:02] he came in a form now follow me now
[1:04:06] but in this form god
[1:04:09] self abraham what we have
[1:04:12] in a type as the communion
[1:04:15] god says abraham bread and wine
[1:04:20] but what is amazing in this form
[1:04:23] there is no scriptural evidence that he
[1:04:27] took of it
[1:04:30] that's what i wanted i want to catch
[1:04:32] your mind
[1:04:35] he offered abraham bread and wine
[1:04:39] amen and the bible says
[1:04:42] abraham in return gave him the tenth of
[1:04:46] all abraham paid tithes
[1:04:49] which of course an order was established
[1:04:52] there
[1:04:54] are we together now when i'm trying to
[1:04:57] balance us tonight
[1:04:59] or trying to help us to see that
[1:05:03] when jesus resurrected
[1:05:07] there was one form where he told
[1:05:10] mary don't touch me
[1:05:13] amen i have not ascended to the father
[1:05:17] yet
[1:05:20] but then just in the evening time
[1:05:24] when he came into the amaze
[1:05:28] he was able to have them to touch him
[1:05:33] praise the lord he was able to eat bread
[1:05:39] and fish
[1:05:42] but yet he could disappear from the
[1:05:45] amaze
[1:05:47] are we together now so
[1:05:50] we see here yeah god
[1:05:53] came as the priest
[1:05:57] he came as the priest the chief
[1:06:00] shepherd the pastor of all
[1:06:03] and he gave abraham a communion service
[1:06:09] then we will also see in genesis chapter
[1:06:12] 18
[1:06:14] there was another form that god came in
[1:06:20] praise the lord amen
[1:06:24] abraham saw three men coming
[1:06:29] praise the lord which of course brother
[1:06:32] branham says
[1:06:32] and god took the dust and blew and said
[1:06:35] you get inside one angel
[1:06:37] and say you get inside and he blew a
[1:06:39] body
[1:06:40] and god himself got in that body
[1:06:45] praise the lord amen
[1:06:48] are we together
[1:06:51] what i'm trying to bring i'm trying to
[1:06:54] bring what happened in genesis one
[1:06:56] and two went through the
[1:07:00] scripture it was the different
[1:07:03] ways and form
[1:07:06] you remember when the angel met manoa's
[1:07:10] wife
[1:07:13] praise the lord the anger she says
[1:07:16] uh uh uh uh you know uh uh go and call
[1:07:19] your husband the husband came and they
[1:07:21] were all there
[1:07:22] he says who are you he says my name is
[1:07:23] secret it says
[1:07:25] uh uh uh you know can we fetch bread and
[1:07:28] wine for you
[1:07:29] and and this that and and and they try
[1:07:32] to face
[1:07:32] you know food for the angel and they
[1:07:34] realize he consume it in a fire
[1:07:37] and he disappears oh our eyes have seen
[1:07:40] god
[1:07:42] they were formed that he talked
[1:07:46] that he could sit down and partake of
[1:07:49] bread
[1:07:51] they were formed that he talked he would
[1:07:54] visit men
[1:07:55] he would bless them and he would just go
[1:07:58] away
[1:08:01] are we together
[1:08:05] praise the lord amen
[1:08:11] so yet in genesis chapter 18 we see
[1:08:15] almighty god elohim took a form
[1:08:19] and he and he came down
[1:08:22] and abraham recognized him and said my
[1:08:25] lord
[1:08:26] said amen and he sent word
[1:08:30] to sarah face food and milk to feed them
[1:08:33] to eat
[1:08:35] praise the lord amen
[1:08:39] and and it was it was in that it was
[1:08:42] it was at a place where her back was
[1:08:45] turned to the tent
[1:08:48] and he descended the need
[1:08:51] of sarah praise the lord
[1:08:55] amen now because of
[1:08:58] this experience
[1:09:01] and in fulfillment to sin luke 17
[1:09:05] 30 when jesus said
[1:09:08] as it was in the days of sodom amen
[1:09:12] so shall it be in the son of man
[1:09:17] praise the lord jesus prophesied
[1:09:20] that that will repeat in our day
[1:09:24] praise the lord and uh
[1:09:27] and and and we and we witness it in
[1:09:30] brother bran and ministering
[1:09:31] as we listen to the tape you know uh the
[1:09:34] sign of the masai there's a clear one
[1:09:36] where he says
[1:09:37] now i turn my back to the to the
[1:09:39] congregation you know he says that
[1:09:42] but what has happened here is that and
[1:09:45] what i want to show you
[1:09:47] because of the experience of
[1:09:50] uh genesis 18 and what the lord did in
[1:09:55] brother branham ministry
[1:09:56] it brought out a teaching called elohim
[1:10:02] people falsely taught that brother
[1:10:03] branham was elohim
[1:10:09] what what spo what destroyed that
[1:10:11] teaching
[1:10:12] is because brother branham was born of a
[1:10:15] father and a mother
[1:10:19] the natural birth destroyed that
[1:10:21] teaching
[1:10:23] because of the natural birth no man
[1:10:27] can be elohim no flesh
[1:10:30] elohim can take flesh but no flesh can
[1:10:34] be elohim
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:39] are we together
[1:10:43] praise the lord amen
[1:10:46] because we are going from
[1:10:50] the terrestrial to the celestial
[1:10:54] and back to the glorified
[1:10:58] the glorified body is when
[1:11:01] their celestra takes on the terrestrial
[1:11:05] that's what makes a glorifier when they
[1:11:08] are separate
[1:11:09] they are terrestrial and celestro
[1:11:15] when they are separate their terrestrial
[1:11:18] body can eat
[1:11:19] they can sleep amen
[1:11:22] praise the lord but the celestial body
[1:11:26] don't eat like the terrestrial body
[1:11:30] but when the celestial body takes on
[1:11:32] terrestrial
[1:11:33] and becomes glorified then it eats
[1:11:45] are we together
[1:11:49] we talk about tiofani tiofani is
[1:11:52] celestra body
[1:11:56] praise the lord amen
[1:12:02] glory be to god
[1:12:05] so god
[1:12:08] show himself to our father
[1:12:12] abraham he took a
[1:12:15] form praise the lord
[1:12:18] now because when i'm bringing you two
[1:12:21] when we read the book of corinthian when
[1:12:25] paul was talking first corinthians
[1:12:27] chapter 15
[1:12:28] paul was talking about the different
[1:12:31] ones that have seen him
[1:12:33] amen he said seafarers have seen him
[1:12:36] there were 500 i also saw him in there
[1:12:39] he says but i also saw him
[1:12:43] and the form that paul saw him in
[1:12:46] was not a terrestrial body
[1:12:52] paul saw him in a different form
[1:12:57] praise the lord amen
[1:13:02] and in that form that paul saw him
[1:13:05] is the form that he's been dealing with
[1:13:08] us in
[1:13:15] praise the lord amen
[1:13:22] glory to god are we together
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:29] praise the lord you love the lord
[1:13:32] tonight
[1:13:36] praise the lord jesus
[1:13:39] amen amen amen
[1:13:47] question and answer number two
[1:13:51] uh praise the lord and
[1:13:55] uh jordan if you're able to refer
[1:14:00] to that for us
[1:14:10] that is part of what we use on
[1:14:13] uh sunday
[1:14:18] well let's just let's take uh number one
[1:14:21] let's take number one
[1:14:22] there's a question and answer number one
[1:14:24] and there's a question and answer number
[1:14:25] two
[1:14:26] those whom he called he justified
[1:14:31] those whom he justified he glorified
[1:14:35] praise the lord amen
[1:14:39] now and and the reason why i was i would
[1:14:42] get to the reason why
[1:14:43] uh you know i had to i want to explain
[1:14:47] that
[1:14:48] you know uh because uh
[1:14:54] there's there are some teachings that
[1:14:57] are not right
[1:14:58] you know and and sometimes it confuses
[1:15:01] people
[1:15:03] because when when the when the psalmist
[1:15:05] said who is man
[1:15:07] that they were mindful of him and that
[1:15:10] thou
[1:15:11] visited him if you look at that word
[1:15:14] visit is god
[1:15:20] moving in and out of our dimension
[1:15:24] is god dealing with his children
[1:15:28] he visit us in different ways
[1:15:33] praise the lord he visits some true
[1:15:36] dreams
[1:15:38] he visits some true inspiration
[1:15:42] praise the lord amen
[1:15:46] we will get to that but he says those
[1:15:49] whom he called he
[1:15:50] justified those whom he justified he
[1:15:53] glorified
[1:15:55] and every redeemed person in the word

[1:16:10] and is already in
[1:16:13] heavenly places with christ
[1:16:16] jesus every redeemed person
[1:16:20] under the blood filled with the holy
[1:16:22] ghost has everlasting life
[1:16:24] and can perish and is
[1:16:27] already amen
[1:16:31] jesus in in john chapter 6
[1:16:34] he says the son which is already with
[1:16:37] the father in heaven
[1:16:38] why he was on earth he was telling the
[1:16:40] pharisees
[1:16:41] he said the son or that is already with
[1:16:43] the father
[1:16:45] but he was yet on earth
[1:16:52] it's already in heavenly places in
[1:16:54] christ jesus
[1:16:55] and shall never come to condem
[1:16:57] condemnation
[1:16:59] already redeemed isn't that wonderful
[1:17:02] seed already redeemed sitting in
[1:17:06] heavenly places
[1:17:07] in christ jesus already glorified

[1:17:32] amen the presence of
[1:17:35] the holy spirit which is your glorified
[1:17:39] condition
[1:17:40] that's the reason why when it bumps into
[1:17:42] this flesh
[1:17:43] you shall aiming
[1:17:46] sometimes you shy you surprise yourself
[1:17:49] i never even knew i was going to shout
[1:17:53] amen when it bounced into your body yeah

[1:23:38] pressurizing the mind
[1:23:41] and all that we might be left to if god

[1:25:45] don't you know john saw the souls
[1:25:48] under the altar crying
[1:25:52] how long lord how long
[1:25:55] to to come back to earth
[1:25:59] to be clothed upon
[1:26:03] amen there ain't
[1:26:07] a celestial body
[1:26:12] praise the lord they are in a celestial
[1:26:15] body i'm going to read something to you
[1:26:18] here
[1:26:18] and uh
[1:26:23] i'm trying to get it here they are in a
[1:26:25] celestial body
[1:26:30] uh let's take uh brother uh jordan if
[1:26:33] you
[1:26:34] can help me did uh the arrow
[1:26:37] the arrow of god's deliverance shot
[1:26:40] from the board
[1:26:44] for some reason some of these quotes i
[1:26:46] have i have the names at the bottom
[1:26:48] of them some of them have them at the
[1:26:50] top i don't know what i was doing i was
[1:26:52] just enjoying myself
[1:26:56] but let's let's take this one he said
[1:26:59] you see
[1:27:01] you will never be an angel
[1:27:06] you know that you will never be
[1:27:09] an angel
[1:27:13] you will never get old you will never be
[1:27:16] wrinkled
[1:27:18] you will never be sick he's talking
[1:27:19] about on that other side
[1:27:21] you will never have worry you will never
[1:27:25] be an
[1:27:25] injured you will be a human being
[1:27:31] only immortal you will have
[1:27:35] a glorified body like his body
[1:27:40] you will both eat and drink
[1:27:43] and live and love and associate
[1:27:47] forever and ever
[1:27:53] amen now so the souls
[1:27:57] under the altar brother branham said
[1:28:01] uh we're almost on time here so i will
[1:28:04] pick that up
[1:28:05] uh another time here to show to you he
[1:28:08] says the souls
[1:28:09] under the altar the crying how long
[1:28:12] he says they wanted to come back and be
[1:28:14] clothed upon
[1:28:17] in another quote he says they wanted to
[1:28:19] come and eat
[1:28:29] praise the lord amen they wanted to come
[1:28:32] and eat and drink why because in a
[1:28:35] celestial body you don't eat and drink
[1:28:38] and because they were not made to be
[1:28:41] like that
[1:28:44] it was not their ori it was only a
[1:28:46] temporary state
[1:28:48] it was not their original state
[1:28:53] so they wanted to come back to the
[1:28:56] original state
[1:28:59] that's the reason why last wednesday i
[1:29:01] said when he said
[1:29:03] how long in the sense of
[1:29:07] vengeance it was to show
[1:29:11] that they were jews amen
[1:29:15] they were not the gentile bride because
[1:29:17] the gentile brother will not call
[1:29:18] for vengeance amen
[1:29:22] but in their state where they were
[1:29:25] dwelling
[1:29:28] because that was not the state they were
[1:29:31] ordained to be in
[1:29:32] they wanted to come back
[1:29:36] and put on the flesh where they can eat
[1:29:38] and drink
[1:29:44] are we together amen
[1:29:47] he make man in his image
[1:29:51] male and female in the image of god
[1:29:54] created hidden
[1:29:59] because they were ordained for the earth
[1:30:04] he put them in a body
[1:30:08] praise the lord in a body
[1:30:13] and in that body man
[1:30:17] was dominating man was ruling the earth
[1:30:20] adam was naming the animals
[1:30:23] he was speaking to the mountains and
[1:30:24] everything
[1:30:26] praise the lord are we together
[1:30:31] amen that's the reason why
[1:30:34] when the the scripture says when
[1:30:37] when uh when when adam and eve
[1:30:40] when when when they broke the veil
[1:30:43] they knew something left him
[1:30:48] more than just being naked physically
[1:30:50] they knew
[1:30:51] that something left him
[1:30:56] but branham says he think his man felt
[1:30:58] her he said that holyfield
[1:31:00] left him
[1:31:04] amen praise the lord
[1:31:09] are we together
[1:31:14] when the scripture speaks about you know
[1:31:17] uh i mean we would not uh uh uh we would
[1:31:20] not be
[1:31:21] hungry really does not means that we
[1:31:23] will not eat
[1:31:26] it it means that just like we will not
[1:31:28] feed pain there would not be
[1:31:31] a feeling of hunger
[1:31:35] we would not feed it like man i'm really
[1:31:37] hungry
[1:31:39] i need to get something to eat man i'm
[1:31:41] hungry i mean hunger will
[1:31:43] be turning your eyes you won't feed it
[1:31:47] but it does not mean that we will not
[1:31:49] eat
[1:31:54] praise the lord it does not means that
[1:31:57] we will not drink
[1:31:59] now you see that is the reason why when
[1:32:02] brother branham
[1:32:03] taught fasting and praying
[1:32:06] he taught it a different way
[1:32:10] he said the human body was made for food
[1:32:13] and water
[1:32:18] don't deny yourself food and water
[1:32:23] when your body is desiring it
[1:32:27] that's the way he said
[1:32:31] when your body is desiring it go and eat
[1:32:39] praise the lord
[1:32:42] because
[1:32:47] a feast a
[1:32:50] a fast in the flesh is a feast with the
[1:32:53] lord
[1:32:55] praise the lord if you are not praying
[1:32:59] and you're not reading the word you're
[1:33:00] just starving yourself
[1:33:02] you're not fasting and for you to pray
[1:33:09] you need your body needs water
[1:33:13] you need energy
[1:33:17] unless god call you to eat don't do it
[1:33:22] that's what brother branham said
[1:33:26] that has made people to give themselves
[1:33:29] to familiar spirits
[1:33:32] they have turned their body over to
[1:33:35] demonic attack
[1:33:37] god called moses to 40 days and
[1:33:41] fought at night god called him and
[1:33:43] clothed him with the shackana glory
[1:33:47] if god don't call you don't starve your
[1:33:50] body
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:53] and be spitting all over the place
[1:33:57] that's not fast
[1:34:01] if you are fasting you must be spending
[1:34:03] time in god's word
[1:34:05] you must be praying you must have the
[1:34:08] energy to do it
[1:34:13] you don't have the energy you get laying
[1:34:14] down there when will the time reach six
[1:34:17] twelve o'clock
[1:34:21] then you're spending time on facebook
[1:34:23] and you're all over the place
[1:34:26] that's not fast
[1:34:34] that's not fast you are abusing your
[1:34:38] body
[1:34:44] because the thing that keeps the body
[1:34:46] together
[1:34:47] is full in water
[1:34:53] praise the lord
[1:34:57] you want to deny yourself from food and
[1:34:59] water do it in the space of time where
[1:35:00] you know
[1:35:01] you can pray and concentrate on the lord
[1:35:05] because the devil when jesus fasted the
[1:35:07] devil tempted him
[1:35:09] then what about you and myself
[1:35:17] the devil tempted him
[1:35:23] and if you are not spending that time
[1:35:25] with the lord
[1:35:26] it's a feast with the lord you must
[1:35:28] enjoy it
[1:35:32] if you are not enjoying it god is not
[1:35:34] enjoying it just forget about it
[1:35:41] if you are not enjoying it god is not
[1:35:44] enjoying it just get away from it
[1:35:47] because our god don't believe in abuse
[1:35:50] god don't abuse his children
[1:35:55] are we together are you understanding me
[1:36:01] because that's what sustained this
[1:36:03] terrestrial body
[1:36:06] that's what sustained this terrestrial
[1:36:08] body
[1:36:12] it's food and water all i mean all of
[1:36:15] those
[1:36:15] those uh uh you know uh uh uh uh
[1:36:18] you know uh religious idea where people
[1:36:21] says well i mean you you have to
[1:36:23] you have to punish your body you you
[1:36:25] have to subject your body
[1:36:27] if you can do it and concentrate
[1:36:30] if you can do it and keep your mind on
[1:36:33] god
[1:36:34] god bless you if you can't keep your
[1:36:37] mind
[1:36:38] on god
[1:36:42] praise the lord please go find something
[1:36:45] to eat
[1:36:48] are we together please go find something
[1:36:51] to eat
[1:37:03] are we together
[1:37:06] praise the lord don't worry um
[1:37:09] there's there are a lot of things that
[1:37:10] we'll bring in this in this
[1:37:12] because there's another part of it where
[1:37:15] brother branham also talks
[1:37:16] about the ted element that benefit this
[1:37:19] body full
[1:37:20] water and sleep
[1:37:23] we will deal with that amen
[1:37:28] sleep is a gift that god
[1:37:32] give us he gave
[1:37:35] sleep to his beloved
[1:37:39] it's a gift
[1:37:44] are we together
[1:37:47] but uh we after nine o'clock here
[1:37:49] tonight
[1:37:50] so uh we would just we'll stop here
[1:37:54] and uh you know
[1:37:58] and then be able to find a place here to
[1:38:02] pray them and then we can go home
[1:38:05] so trying to show
[1:38:08] that god
[1:38:13] when he make man in his
[1:38:16] image that's the thought you should you
[1:38:19] should be able to keep in your mind
[1:38:21] when he make man in his image brother
[1:38:23] branham said that over and over
[1:38:24] he make man a spirit man because god is
[1:38:27] a spirit
[1:38:31] but man was not ordained to be spirit
[1:38:36] praise the lord he was not ordained to
[1:38:39] be
[1:38:40] spirit that is the reason why we
[1:38:42] struggle
[1:38:43] just to be spiritual i just want to be
[1:38:46] spiritual lord
[1:38:48] i just want to be spiritual i want to be
[1:38:50] in the spirit you in the flesh
[1:38:54] subject yourself to the spirit
[1:38:58] amen praise the lord
[1:39:01] subject this body to the holy spirit
[1:39:03] that's what we are called to do
[1:39:09] it's not to rule out if you have a
[1:39:11] feeling
[1:39:12] deal with it amen
[1:39:16] what a good feeling or a wrong feeling
[1:39:18] dean with it
[1:39:19] and bring a subject to the word of god
[1:39:26] he made us to inhabit the earth that's
[1:39:29] the reason why after we go
[1:39:31] one thousand years we will come back on
[1:39:32] earth after the one thousand years
[1:39:34] eternity we coming back on earth
[1:39:36] because we are ordained for this earth
[1:39:41] we are ordained for this elf you will
[1:39:43] not be an angel
[1:39:47] when the pharisees came to jesus the
[1:39:49] sadducees
[1:39:51] trying to destroy his teaching on
[1:39:52] resurrection and said that
[1:39:54] you know that woman she has seven
[1:39:56] husbands who will be jesus says
[1:39:58] you will be just like the angels the
[1:40:00] reason why he said that
[1:40:02] is to erase the fact that when we leave
[1:40:05] this body
[1:40:06] the sexual emotion is taken away
[1:40:09] that's what he was dealing with because
[1:40:11] that was the question they brought to
[1:40:13] him
[1:40:15] it does not mean that you would be
[1:40:17] injured no
[1:40:19] but you would be like angels without no
[1:40:22] sexual
[1:40:23] emotion and affection
[1:40:27] because sex came by the serpent
[1:40:31] and when we leave this body it stays
[1:40:33] right here it came from the dust it
[1:40:35] would go back to the dust
[1:40:38] praise the lord you see while the enemy
[1:40:43] tried to make this age
[1:40:44] pollute the minds and and support the
[1:40:47] minds of the people
[1:40:48] and and i mean it should not be because
[1:40:51] of sexual desire
[1:40:53] you should want to get married
[1:41:01] praise the lord are we together
[1:41:09] young people are we together
[1:41:18] we are made to inhabit the earth
[1:41:21] and because this body is part of the
[1:41:24] earth
[1:41:25] you must subject it to the word of god
[1:41:28] that is the way to be
[1:41:29] in the spirit is to bring your thoughts
[1:41:32] your feeling
[1:41:33] everything subject to the word of god
[1:41:40] are we together
[1:41:46] praise the lord if i create question on
[1:41:48] your mind
[1:41:49] just write it down we will address it
[1:41:54] the lord bless you tonight musicians you
[1:41:56] can come
[1:42:04] because when you give yourself to a
[1:42:05] little consecration
[1:42:07] the devil knows that so he will try to
[1:42:10] to blast your mind he tried to bring
[1:42:14] you know he makes the the the smell of
[1:42:17] food
[1:42:18] sweet he just put your mind on all sorts
[1:42:21] of kind of things
[1:42:22] just to be able to rob you and then
[1:42:25] right there now you says oh god
[1:42:27] you know then then you start feeling
[1:42:29] condemned because you are thinking about
[1:42:31] food
[1:42:32] and say lord i'm not supposed to be
[1:42:33] thinking about food and
[1:42:36] no it's because you are abusing your
[1:42:39] body
[1:42:40] we all does not have the same limits
[1:42:44] there are people that can concentrate
[1:42:46] themselves and go
[1:42:47] three days we don't have the same
[1:42:51] measure of
[1:42:51] faith praise the lord
[1:42:56] we don't have the same measure of faith
[1:43:00] and god want to deal with you according
[1:43:02] to your measure of faith
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:07] praise the lord
[1:43:13] it's a wrong teaching so says our
[1:43:16] fasting
[1:43:16] is from sister says you don't you didn't
[1:43:20] you break the fat before sisters say you
[1:43:22] are kana it's a wrong teaching
[1:43:26] all of those things expose young people
[1:43:29] young christians
[1:43:32] to spiritual challenges
[1:43:36] and ministers think they are making
[1:43:37] their church spiritual
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:42] the messenger never taught it that way
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:48] even brother branham he says the monster
[1:43:51] have fasted
[1:43:53] three days
[1:43:56] but yet he had a way to spend more time
[1:43:59] with god
[1:44:04] he had a way to spend more time with god
[1:44:19] trying to
[1:44:21] help us to appreciate what god has given
[1:44:24] to us
[1:44:25] appreciate what god is doing in your
[1:44:27] life
[1:44:29] appreciate your measure of faith don't
[1:44:32] compare yourself to anybody
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:43] if you pray one hour you don't have to
[1:44:45] brag about it
[1:44:46] like i pray one hour i was in the spirit
[1:44:49] i prayed two hours
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:58] you could spend five hours and don't say
[1:45:01] nothing to
[1:45:02] god
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:09] you can spend five hours just before
[1:45:11] your idol
[1:45:15] and no connection with god
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:19] god is real he's real
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:26] when you talk give him time to talk
[1:45:31] that real conversation when you finish
[1:45:34] talking give god time to talk
[1:45:38] sit back and that's the one that is
[1:45:40] difficult for us
[1:45:43] we just want to tell him lord jesus lord
[1:45:46] i want you to do this
[1:45:47] lord okay amen
[1:45:50] give him time to talk
[1:45:53] that's not conversation you just you are
[1:45:55] the commander
[1:45:59] are we together praise the lord
[1:46:03] we appreciate the lord tonight let's
[1:46:05] give the lord a hand of praise
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:20] let's just sing that song tonight in the
[1:46:21] city where the lime is the light
[1:46:26] before we pray
[1:46:31] i am
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:52] is
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:47:06] in the city where the land is
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:34] is
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:53] where the line is
[1:48:04] that's the reason why the emphasis
[1:48:10] is giving christ the preeminence
[1:48:14] the emphasis is subjecting ourself
[1:48:18] to god praise the lord
[1:48:22] that is the proof of your new birth
[1:48:27] that you can humble yourself to the word
[1:48:31] that you can submit yourself to the
[1:48:33] world
[1:48:36] because that's all god is doing he's
[1:48:39] going to use this body in the millennium
[1:48:42] he's going to use this body in eternity
[1:48:45] that's the reason why he want to subject
[1:48:47] this body to the world
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] even though it's not going to be as as
[1:48:54] as
[1:48:55] elderly as it is amen
[1:49:00] is going to be in his tenderness
[1:49:03] praise the lord is going to be
[1:49:06] in his tenderness
[1:49:09] it's going to be in its best form and
[1:49:12] best shape
[1:49:15] that's why the emphasis
[1:49:19] is to submit ourselves to the world
[1:49:24] can we just pray tonight the more i
[1:49:27] surrender
[1:49:28] let's just sing the accuracy the more i
[1:49:30] surrender
