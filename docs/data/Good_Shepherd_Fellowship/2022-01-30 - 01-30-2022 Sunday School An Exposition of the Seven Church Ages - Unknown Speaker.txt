========================================
[Music] so [Music] remember this is the false vine let it name the name of the lord it does so only in a lie its headship is not of the lord but of satan it finally ends up completely identified with the beast the riding on the scarlet beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force satan and not our god the lord jesus christ in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the commerce of the earth for no man can buy or sell apart from her this is borne out in revelation 18 9-17 which shows her involvement with kings princes merchants all of whom have to do with rome and commerce in revelation 13 14 we learned that the beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him the image that is made is a worldwide ecumenical council wherein all the organized churches will get together with the roman catholics they are doing it even now it is quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of communism but since communism like nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to burn the flesh of the harlot rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere the romish church went communism followed it has to be that way and let me warn you now don't get thinking communism is your only enemy no sir it is the catholic church also and even more so now let us read revelation 13 1-4 and compare this with revelation 12 1-5 revelation 13 1-4 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him revelation 12 1-5 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts in revelation 14 the beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is imperial pagan rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in papal rome do you see it the nation that ruled by crushing all in which became the strongest empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as to control by armies etc but under constantine she came back to life for papal rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute she uses kings and merchants and in her deadly religious and financial strength she is governing as the goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the man-child herod tried to kill the lord jesus and failed later jesus was crucified by roman soldiers but now is caught up to the throne now along with what i have just said recall the vision of daniel the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet that was iron and clay see the iron is the roman empire but now it is no longer solid iron play is mixed in it yet it is there in running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more despotic ones the romish church is in every nation it is mixed up in it all let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when khrushchev beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n well there were five eastern nations there and five western khrushchev spoke for the east and president eisenhower for the west in russian khrushchev is clay and eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay were side by side we are in the end of it all in verse 4 it asks who is able to make war with the beast now there are at present some great names in the world there are some mighty nations but right now rome is calling the tune the pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can war against him verse 6 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy teaching for doctrine the commandments of men heady high-minded lovers of pleasure having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof he blasphemed the name of god changing that name to titles and refusing to do otherwise verse 7 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints persecution death to the true believer and all in the name of the lord in order that the name of god be blasphemed even as it is in russia because of what the catholic religion did there verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth all whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world shall worship him thank god the sheep will not worship him everyone but the very elect will be deceived but they will not be deceived for they hear the shepherd's voice and they follow him now then see this what we have been trying to show you this seed of death that started in the first age this seed of organization has finally grown into the tree in which every foul bird is lodged in spite of her claims that she is the giver of life she is the giver of death her fruit is death they that partake of her are dead this mighty world church system that fools the world that in her is physical and spiritual salvation deceives and destroys the multitudes but not only is she death personified but this dead carrion creature will be itself put to death with death which is the lake of fire oh that men would perceive what their end will be by remaining in her come out of her for why will ye die a final warning revelation 2 23 and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works god looketh on the heart that has never changed neither will it ever change here as through all the ages there are two groups both proclaiming their revelation from god and their relationship to god nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them which are his second timothy 2 19 the lord searcheth the reigns the word search means to track or follow up god tracks down our thoughts reigns he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is out of the heart that precedes either righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes all are known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought into judgment when the accounting for our lives is given there was no fear of god before the false fine and dearly shall they pay let all who name his name so live as becometh saints we might fool the people but we will never fool the lord the promise in those dark days revelation 2 24-25 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depth of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come now before we go into the promise let me show again that the church as spoken of by the spirit in this book has two vines whose interwinding branches compose it but i say unto you and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine there it is he is speaking to the two groups one has the doctrine another has not there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each one's doctrine opposing the other one is of god knowing his depths the other of satan knowing the depths of satan i will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the dark ages was either bend or be broken bow or die it was the inquisition the power of the empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last stage is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in this fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden it was to defy rome stand up for the word even unto death they have not known the depths of satan it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is meant let us first know what the depth of god is and the opposite will be true for the depth of satan in ephesians 3 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of god in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of god indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word but the depth of satan will be and that he will attempt to destroy this he will as always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of god how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of god destroy the word by putting forth his own yea hath god said he will then substitute the personal christ in our spirits he will do it as he caused israel to do the same by a human being reigning as king instead of god the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining the depths of satan had been entered into in that age and the fruit of that depth of satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came forth from it the rewards revelation 2 26-29 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh and keepeth my works to the end it is very evident from the remarks of the spirit on works that the lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentions works and now he says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power over nations and will be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons this is very amazing but let us look at this promise in the light of the age powerful rome with state backing employing kings and armies and legislators breaks and grinds all before it she has killed millions and hungers to kill millions more who will not bow to her she intolerantly sets up kings or brings them low whenever she can yea her interference has actually caused nations to fall because she has determined to destroy the elect of god her works are the works of the devil for she murders and lies as did he but there is coming a day wherein the lord is going to say bring these mine enemies before me and slay them then shall the righteous be with their lord when his righteous indignation will fall upon the blasphemers the righteous coming with him in glory shall destroy those who destroyed the earth and made havoc of the saints of god this was the age of turning the cheek of terrible distress but a day is coming when truth shall prevail and who shall stand in its fire and be safe only the redeemed of the lord and i will give him the morning star according to revelation 22 16 and 2nd peter 1 19 jesus is the morning star i am the root and offspring of david the bright and morning star until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts the spirit is therefore making a promise to the elect of the dark ages relative to himself and then in the ages to come as we have already stated jesus identifies himself with the messengers of each age they receive from him the revelation on the word for each period this word revelation brings the elect of god out of the world and into full union with jesus christ these messengers are called stars because they shine with a borrowed or reflected light of the sun even jesus they are also called stars because they are holders of light at night thus in the darkness of sin they bring the light of god to his people this is the dark ages it is especially dark for the word of the lord is almost entirely hidden from the people knowledge of the most high has almost ceased death has overcome vast numbers of the believers until their ranks are decimated the things of god are at the lowest ebb to this date and it seemed that satan would surely conquer god's people if ever a people needed a promise embracing the land where there is no light it was the people of the dark ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star he is telling them that the chief star even jesus who dwelleth in light unto which no man can approach will in the future kingdom illuminate them by his own personal presence he will not be using the stars messengers to give light in darkness any longer it will be jesus himself speaking to them face to face as he shares his kingdom with them it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine when our son jesus comes there will be no further need of messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day what else could we desire above jesus himself is he not everything even perfect everything he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen even so lord god by thy spirit let us hear thy truth chapter 7 the sardisian church age revelation 3 1-6 and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast to name that thou livest and art dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raymond and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches sardis sardis was the capital of ancient lydia it passed from the hands of lydian monarchs to the persians and thence to alexander the great it was sacked by antiochus the great the kings of pergamus then succeeded to the dominion until the romans took over in the time of tiberius it was desolated by earthquakes and plagues today it is a heap of ruins and uninhabited this city was at one time very important commercially pliny said that the art of dying wool was invented here it was the center of wall dying and carpet weaving it had a goodly amount of silver and gold in the area and it is said that gold coins were first minted there it also had a slave market the religion of this city was the impure worship of the goddess civilly the massive ruins of the temple may still be seen you will recall that in the pergamian age i mentioned that the babylonish concept of mother and son known as samiramus and ninus became the sibley endious of asia the attributes attached to these two are most enlightening as we view them side by side he was the sun god she the moon goddess he was the lord of heaven she the queen of heaven he the revealer of goodness and truth she of gentleness and mercy he the mediator she the mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise he as the judge of the dead she as standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried their bodily by the sun now in rome this same god is given the title of our lord he is called the son of god while she is called the mother of god now that is what we found back there in the other two ages where the mother and son concept took on such tremendous proportions but now notice that even as it was back in babylon that the worship of the sun began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the sun we see in this age that the pagan worship of sardis was the worship of the woman it is civilly alone not civilly and eoes the mother has literally taken the place of the sun endowed with the merits of godhead all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded mary by the roman church to understand where the religion of this age came from two things really struck me with force as i looked into this worship of civilly one was the fact that she wore a key like janus which gave her the same authority as janus key to heaven and earth and the mysteries and the fact that the worshipers whip themselves until blood spurts from their bodies which thing is done right today by the catholics who feel they are suffering like the lord the fact that this is the age of the first real break with papal rome that actually flourished no doubt caused the jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of meriolatry in decided opposition to the protestants who denied her any part whatsoever in the plan of salvation apart from her favor with god as the virgin chosen to bear the babe as luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to works penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed christians glorified the sun the roman catholics increased their deification of mary until the 20th century saw in opposition to most high-ranking roman theologians pope pius literally exalt mary to glorification in a resurrected body that doctrine is absolutely the babylonish one of the sun carrying the mother bodily into heaven no wonder this fifth age goes right along with the other ages and will do so until it ends in the lake of fire where the and her children are killed in the second death there it is mariola tree the worship of civilly by the way did you know that sibylli was the astarte that jezebel was priestess too and caused israel to stumble by the licentious rights that she conducted yes that is who she was in the bible the age the sardisian or fifth church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 it is usually called the age of the reformation the messenger the messenger to this age is the best known messenger of all the ages he was martin luther martin luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition he was studying to be a lawyer when the lingering illness and death of a near friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his life he entered the augustinian convent at effort in 1505. there he studied philosophy and also the word of god he lived the life of severest penance but all the outward acts could not banish his sense of sin he said i tormented myself to death to make peace with god but i was in darkness and found it not the vicar general of his order staupitz helped him to gain the insight that his salvation would have to be the experience of an inner work rather than a ritual with this encouragement he further sought god later he became a priest as yet he was not saved he became an avid and deep student of the word and of the great theological works extent he was sought out as a teacher and preacher for his depth of knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he had made to himself he went to rome there he saw the futility of the church's imposed works that were to bring salvation and the word of god struck home to his heart the just shall live by faith on his return home the evangelical truth of this scripture flooded his mind and he was set free from sin and born into the kingdom of god soon after this he was elevated to doctor of divinity and commissioned to devote his whole life to study and faithfully expound and defend the holy scripture this he did and with such effect that his heart and the hearts of those around him were deeply fixed upon the truth of the word the word soon came into open conflict with the abuses of church creeds and doctrines thus when leo the tenth became pope and john tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin luther had no choice but to rise up against this anti-scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then wrote his famous 95 theses which on october 31 1517 he nailed to the door of castle church in a short time germany was ablaze and the reformation was on now let it be remembered that martin luther was not the only one who had protested the roman catholic church he was but one of many others had denied the popes their self-granted temporal and spiritual power and even amongst the popes there were minor temporary reforms yes there were many others who raised issues but in the case of luther god's time was ripe for a definite move that would be the beginning of the restoration of the church to an outpouring of the holy ghost at a much later date now martin luther himself was a sensitive spirit-filled christian he was definitely a man of the word for he not only had a profound passion to study it but to make it available to all in order that all might live by it he translated the new testament and gave it to the people this laborious work he did himself correcting a passage as much as 20 times he gathered around him a group of hebrew scholars amongst whom were jews and translated the old testament this monumental work of luther is still the work upon which all successive works of the scripture in germany have rested he was a mighty preacher [Music]
