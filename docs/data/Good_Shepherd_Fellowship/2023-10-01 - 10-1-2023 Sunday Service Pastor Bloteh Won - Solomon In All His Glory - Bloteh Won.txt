the Lord but we are here this morning amen and what matter most is that the Lord is here this morning that's what matter most he's the one that we come to celebrate amen he's the one that we come to worship praise the Lord and uh I'm also uh glad to see my good friend uh uh Pastor Celestine uh he's a he's a old friend of mine old friend of mine in the day of my pilgrimage you know when he asked uh Jacob what was his age when Pharaoh asked him what was his age he said all of the days of my pilgrimage that's what make my age you know so uh brother celon is a good friend of mine it goes way back he he came for the a conference in the states is actually from the aost uh uh originally from Nigeria but he's based in the aost and uh he came for the conference and I thought he had a longer time so he would he trying to get a hold of me and I'm I'm busy doing what I'm doing I'm saying to myself he should be done with what he's doing I'm going to have him to come and and all of there so I talked to him and asked him when are you going he said I'm going next week Wednesday and I really want to see you before I go I said well okay and let's see how we can what we can do here so he was able to make his way down to come and see me and uh this goes back to many many years back to many many years when I was just when I was just a boy preacher and uh uh by the way today is my birthday so uh uh I'm not much a boy preacher because I've I've uh I've about 50 years or I'm about 50 years praise the Lord maybe when the date is done I will be completely 50 30 years in the ministry so uh uh but when I was a boy preacher you know back in the AR Coast we were there uh it was uh uh a refugee uh group that we had you know uh pastoring a group of people that that could highly support you you had to support them you know uh uh I never I never really learned living living on ties you know I had to live by the sweat of my brow so I think uh uh good sheeper you've been very nice to me you sp po me amen you poly me than uh what I'm what I'm used to so uh uh but uh uh brother uh uh Celestine he was in another city uh he was in another city it would be about uh I think about a two two to to three hours drive uh coming to the city where where we were and uh uh at the time he was he was not a missionary he was a merchant he used to sell and he was into clothes so he will come over uh uh to sell uh uh during our Market there and the market there was Thursday so he would come Wednesday night and sleep and then sell on Thursday and then travel at the end of the day so uh uh uh there was there was a preacher in time one time they had a had a crusade and then uh somewhere I don't know how it is but he he got a hold of me and wanted me to preach on his Crusade and then when I when I preach on the Crusade that night I got I got lot of lot of friends that were that were blessed and they decided that they will they will come around and and support us so there was one brother that used to come to our church brother lenus he's a good friend to brother Celestine so Celestine will come and stay to Lea's house and then they will go to to business together and all of that so since he came was coming Wednesday night he will come with uh Celestine to church we just we just had a small group at that time the church were wheresoever two or three are gathered you know that's that's that was the church I was pastoring whever two or three I GA so he will come and then we will we will have service and then uh the next day but uh as as God would design it I saw that as God's design and God's provision all of these brothers they will come and then uh you know the the they really appreciate what we were doing we were all young men at the time so uh they took it upon them themselves in the way of supporting the ministry you know every time I think about it you know the Bible says that when Moses and were walking through the Wilderness their shoes never were out neither their clothes praise the Lord and it it was because of the the the supernatural presence of God the pillow of fire the glory of the Lord that was following the the people at the time uh uh I did not have that Supernatural presence in that way but I had it in a different way in a different way that now I have all of these friends that will come and visit us and uh Wednesday night and go to self so every time they come and uh uh uh they will they would take the best you know the best shirt the best trouses the best socks the best Singler the best they will take the best and uh and then uh they will come every I mean every every uh uh every week you know pretty much every week I had new clothes I didn't have anything to eat but I had new clothes praise the Lord yeah so they were very very good friend to me very very good friend so after a couple of years one time he came and he talked to me and and told me that he wanted me to come down to him to where he were living so I traveled there and then uh uh he asked me that he wanted for us to spend some time together with the Lord so we we decided to spend uh uh I think it was about 3 days uh seeking the face of the Lord because at the time he started feeling the desire to go into the Ministry so we spent some time together we prayed and uh uh you know I I just I just encouraged him you know uh he's he's a Pentecostal preacher he's uh you know uh and then uh but uh uh over the years and and uh you know the war came and we had to leave that area and we all moved down to to the capital AB Jan and and then uh after the while I heard he was around so uh he was sent for me uh uh uh over in in yugan you know to to come and see the little work that he was doing there praise the Lord so um uh you just he brought fls of memory to my mind and uh he came in yesterday evening he be leaving tomorrow evening and uh he just wanted us to spend some time together I mean uh because uh uh it's been it's been uh it's been a good wi since we seen one another uh pretty much uh yeah getting to some close to some 10 years now uh since the last time we saw one another so I was so glad to see him and uh uh rev celest God bless you thank you for coming to to visit with us and uh maybe as as my customers maybe I'll give him the privilege to come and greet greet the church come come over and and just and greet the people what he's saying is true it was not easy I love you so much so I see him a young preacher thirsty for the work of God other people are looking for money B he was tasty sacrifice his time for God I said what kind kind of Life what kind of man is this so I said no I have to do my best for him so I have forget all what he was saying we look for fine clothes the best I said no my brother person some wear this clothes I put it aside said Pro let's go and eat a better food so he sacrifice his time if you have somebody like this you a blessing and I encourage you to listen to what he saying because what can save you is the world is the world that can saves you not your imagination the world and there are people that have the world of the Living World I think he's one of the people that have the living world and that living world is going to help you when you got it you take it it will help you a lot because of the test he have for God he traveled down to Nigeria to pre the word of God before he arrived back to aast her family have gone back to United States he was crying care of this what but all for God but today he was a United States he joined back to his family so that is he may take time that God know what he's doing God know what he's doing you see I will take you past the fire I will take you past the stress but he know what he's doing be yourself oh are God I love you people and I pray the almighty God continue to guide us to the word of his truth and to strength us and I promised him that anytime I come to us I must try to come and visit you people and worship you people together as

let's uh let's go to first king chapter 4 I want to I want to speak on U uh uh a message this morning that I entitled Solomon in all of his glory so first king chapter 4 I want to do a comparison this morning there is there is something that is on my mind on my heart that I want to bring and um I'm I'm trusting that uh the Lord can be able to help me to deliver it praise the Lord the Lord can be able to help me to deliver it amen you know I've I've always said I've always told my wife I said uh uh the Lord has never he has never make uh uh uh he has never blessed me with money God has blessed me with friends and it's so unique that God will bring one of my good friend on my birthday praise the Lord I'm telling you amen by his grace I can never go anywhere in the word and gu Tred God has given me good friends good friends praise the Lord good friends you know some of those things it makes life easy for you you know when when you can when you can watch how God is dealing with your life and you just stay in that lane you you will have no reason you know to compare yourself with other people because you will never be other people they will never be you praise the Lord you just have to know your lot what was given to Ephraim was different from what was given to Manus praise the Lord amen and you I mean yeah so uh we we get caught up in all of the drama of life and especially Facebook have just make it so ugly when people go and put their McDonald's on Facebook and and all of that and then it just create you know uh so much of comparison and so much of that if we can just only you know uh see uh word God the love that God has given to us and that's where he will bless you you know he will bless you in a lot some God has blessed to to you know he has given them the grace and uh uh uh to have a uh big congregation that God's blessing some God has given the grace to have small congregation it's not the measure of ministry it's just the lot that God has given you praise the Lord I've seen wonderful preacher with with wonderful gift and they they just have a small group of people let's go to first king chapter 4 this morning let's go in first king chapter 4 this morning and we'll read from verse 20 first king chapter 4 we will read from verse 20 praise the Lord first king 4:20 verse 20 Judah in Israel were many as the sand which is by the seed in multitude now what I want you to notice here is that this was a promise that God gave to Abraham I will bless you and your seed will be like the the sin at the seed of so right on the Fulfillment here is here is the the the the the kingdom of David here is the mesiah kingom here is the the promised son Kingdom you have to remember God promised Abraham that he will have a Son by whom he will be the father of many nations And that son was speaking of Jesus Christ even though Isaac was a type of the son and and and also Solomon here also is playing a road a type of the son so he's coming into office the kingdom is coming together the picture that God told Abraham is coming together Abraham was in the desert he couldn't see it he couldn't imagine how would this ever happen but the picture is coming together and God is re-echoing his promise I love that amen he's re-echoing his promise Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the seed in multitude eating and drinking and making Mary so Solomon reigned over all ketom from the river onto the land of the Philistine and onto the border of Egypt they brought presents and serve Solomon all the days of his life and Solomon provision for one day one day Just One Day meal praise the Lord oh my God he had a different L than mine his provision for one day was 30 measure of fine flour and three score measure of MEK 10 fat oxin what will you do with order there Solomon praise the Lord was there nobody there to advise the king but you see the Lord bless you you can have your seat because I know I'm I'm beginning to do too much talking and I might keep you standing along but you see the the emphasis here that the scripture want you to grip is that this is a kingdom this is a son of prosperity amen Joseph was a son of prosperity but you see his Prosperity was to prosper the Earth his gift prospered the Earth at that time because he saved the Earth from drought so the the the the holy spirit is is trying is trying to make us is setting a scene so we can see what the Millennium will looks like because Solomon Reign is a type to the millennium is going is it's giving us the seam to let us to know that we will lack nothing in the Millennium praise the lord we will lack nothing brother brandham says all our wrongs will be made right praise the Lord amen I know I know people struggle with that you know what because brother brah talking in a way of marriage he says if we if we marry the wrong spouse there it will be me right and they think that maybe God will change their wife and gave them a new one no because sin will be bound so you will not have the trouble that you are having sin will be bound for the Thousand Years so it's not swapping mate it is just that all of the things that is making us not to understand one another will be done away with and we will be happy with one another and we be happy the question is why I couldn't get along with you praise the Lord we'll be happy ever amen we will be happy ever so the holy spirit yet is giving us a picture is is creating the scene even though there was a a a physical manifestation in uh in uh uh uh in uh the life of what was happening there with Solomon but it's setting the scene yet there's a reason why God allow everything that is in the Bible every name every nation even if we can't pronounce it praise the Lord there's a reason why he allow it in the holy street now so that was Solon uh uh uh 10 F oxin 20 oxin out of the pasture and the 100 sheeps beside herbs and uh Robo and uh uh follow the and father fouls and all of that oh my God for for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river praise the Lord I'm trying to get get somewhere here let's drop down to verse 26 let's drop down to verse 26 and Solomon had 40,000 stars of of herses for his Chariot and 12,000 hear men that in itself break the the the Leviticus law because uh Moses told him in uh uh in Deuteronomy that the king should not multiply uh herses neither should he multiply wives neither should he multiply so Solomon broke everything that Moses said are we together verse 27 for those officers Pro provided uh vure for for King Solomon and for all that came onto King Solomon table every man you see the you see the the the picture of the wedding supper when Jesus says everybody that came was giving a Welling G that was the same thing everybody that came to Feast with Solomon you were giving a special Rob to word everybody that sat down at Solomon table you were given a special Rob to word water kiddom it was called the Golden Age the Bible called it the golden age that was the Golden Age there was never a time like this in Israel there were Prosperity on every hand a type of our Millennium praise the Lord that's the reason why we shouldn't miss it whatever plans we are making on Earth include the Millennium in your plan praise the Lord include the Millennium in your plan praise the Lord 1,000 years make your plans what are you going to do for 1,000 years praise the Lord what are you going to do for 1,000 years everybody that came to the king to every man uh that sat at his table every man in his mouth they lack nothing nothing everybody had enough everybody had enough you see God said it in such a way in such a way in such a way that when we step out of this life and step into his presence you will have not one regret no matter what you suffer in this life and what you la in this life praise the Lord amen you see that's that is the hope that we have inside that is the thing that give us Grace for us to to to to Bear our trials for us to to be faithful to the Lord and keep trusting the Lord because we know there will be a time where we will lack nothing praise the Lord and you know the reason why God designed it that way is because the only thing you will need to do is worship you will not need to work you will not need a cook you will not the only thing you will need need to do is worship so everything is supplied so you think about it now in a time where we have all of our challenges if the grace of God can raise you to a place where you can have no excuse you can make no excuse in your mind say Lord no matter what I'm going through I'm going to serve you then how much more when you have plenty praise the Lord amen the human the human mind and the human nature every time h a man in his Fallen state will say well if the Lord blessed me I will give it if you cannot give him now while you are lacking if you have a house full you will never be able to give him that's if you cannot make time now for him why you are busy and you have strings everywhere and and iron in the fire everywhere you can't make time for him when you have all of the time you will not be able to make time for him look at the Young Rich ruler example look at the Young Rich ruler because he rejected Jesus the Bible says he went on prospering now at a time where he had enough what did he say oh my soul lay down and sleep the internal life that he was seeking for he he never went seeking for it praise the Lord you have to realize it's it's it's not it's not what we have in our hands that God want is what we have in our hearts it's what we have in our heart there was something that blew my mind blew my mind uh during the week uh and I was listening to to something by the way there is there is one Young Brother uh uh over in Alabama every time he talk to me please greet the church for me please greet the church oh yeah I would do it I will greet the church for you I forgot keep forgetting so I got to my office I wrote it down to remind myself so church I'm greeting you for brother Benjamin amen okay every time you remind me I feel [Laughter] guilty so as soon I got through talking with him I just wrote it down and I put it on my notep good that I took it it's right before me so so I I was I was I was I was listening to this thing and and it was actually a Jewish robber that was talking I was I was I was studying something I was looking into something uh uh uh a testimony I will share it with you very beautiful but but he says something something he said he said God don't need our praise we need to praise God when he said it was almost like my hair spin around my shoulder I said what did he said just just now God don't need our praise we need to praise God it might sound like is the same but it's not the same praise the lord it's not the same it's not the same because if you don't praise God God will stay exist if you don't praise him it will not change him from being God let me tell you he have the births to praise him he has the leaves to praise him the heaven declare the glory of God yes so if you as an individual will birth in your body if you don't praise God it won't change him a bit we need to feel the need we need to feel it in us that we need to praise him we need to join the creation we need to join we we must feel the need praise the Lord that we need to praise him are we together when we have such a generation in such an age that we are living the people are coming across and attacking God let me get to this this thing here quickly I'm I'm hoping that'll keep you long since we have to come back uh uh uh this evening for the time of prayer and uh and and communion so the scripture yet is giving giving us uh h a beautiful picture here beautiful picture let's drop down to verse 29 it's it's right in the same reading there and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largess of heart gave him such a heart to be able to accommodate Solomon has such a heart to take in to accommodate praise the Lord largess of heart even as the sin that is on the seed Shore still speaking about that promise still talking about the promise of Abraham praise the Lord and Solomon wisdom see the wisdom of all the children of the East country and the wisdom of Egypt verse 32 he speaks uh 3,000 Proverbs and his Psalms were 1,5 and he speaks of trees from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the house of uh that sprink it out of the well he you know he he made song out of everything he saw he said look at the ants he said you slothful you lazy man look at the ants the ants know how to gather food in the winter or in the summer to prepare for the winter everything he look around you see the the the gift there was that he could see God in everything that he look around praise the Lord when he got over to the book of ecclesiastic he talk about Vanity Vanity all is Vanity what what he said the underline thing in that book you have to remember he said everything under the Sun so he was trying to make us to know that beyond the sun is not vanity everything under the sun is temporary everything under the song will pass away everything under the song will change and then he closed the book remember your creator in the days of your youth are we together so we talking about this man Solomon uh let's go right there over in Luke chapter 12 Luke chapter 12 that's where I took my uh my uh thought from this morning l Luke chap 12 Luke 12 I mean Matthew chap 12 I said Luke 12 but one there's something in in Matthew chapter 12 the scripture also there too is in uh Matthew chapter 6 but I just wrote wrote down Luke chapter 12 this morning because that's that's where I I kind of forgot it from now so Luke chapter 12 let's read verse 27 Luke chap 12 Luke 12 verse 27 Jesus this is our lord Jesus that is making this comparison that I want for us to pay attention to Jesus here is saying consider the lady how they grow the to n the Spain that and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory that's where I took my my my my subject from this morning Solomon in all his glory so Jesus here is is is bringing a comparison between Solomon glory and another Glory he's not mentioning but he's bringing a comparison here and and and and what I want you to pay attention to is that in the way that Jesus is bringing this if you can gra it Solomon Glory was outward Glory that is the reason why we could count the fats we could count how many uh food he ate that or numbers were given to him because they were all outward they were all visible they could tell they could tell that that that nations were sending clothes to Solomon because it looks like he changed every second when he just go in to come out he's wearing something different they were all outward Glory but yes see Jesus here now making this comparison he says consider the lady consider the lady How It Grow How It Grow can we say that together How It Grow can we say that together How It Grow there's a reason why I'm I'm I'm repeating that because consider the lady Jesus is saying and he's going to let you know that is the same way God is dealing with you your glory will not come one your glory is a growing Glory consider the lady How It Grow we go from glory to glory praise the Lord consider the letter how it grow we must be willing to grow and to grow we must be willing to change because that's one thing that comes with growth is change are we together consider the lady how they grow the to net the spin net and yet I said unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not array like one of these if then God so cloth the grass the lady the grass that is just a grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast in the oven how much more will he clothe you how much more will he clothe you praise the Lord amen how much more will he clothe you Solomon in all of his glory all of his rayen and everything he can change and he can wear cannot be compared to this this this Chanel that Jesus is take taking this comparison if the father can give the lady of the field praise the Lord and you have to realize that the lady of the field when the lady changes his Rob is not taking it from up down it's taking it from inside out amen are we together praise the Lord if then God so clothe the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast in the oven how much more will he clothe you oh ye of little faith oh ye of little faith you know what Jesus is trying to help us to see it he want you to start seeing from the inside out not from the outside in Praise the Lord because after the lady it TOS after the lady struggle in the mud and and it brings out that LE and it it PS out his perfume and everything the one that come outs after the while it dries out it dies but again there is something that comes back from inside the next season and it redress himself it's not dressing itself from outside on is dressing itself from inside out oh ye of little faith if you can look at how much value that God puts in you that he can call you his sons and daughters that he can pour a predestinated seed in your sick body and pre pour a predestinated seed in your poor body no matter what family you coming from where you were born but yet he set his love upon you Jesus is saying oh ye of little faith your faith is only captured by the outside the temporary things your faith has never got the revelation of what is really in you you have not C the revelation of who you are that's why you complain that's why you get into the right race that's why you get into comparing because you have really not got the revelation of who you are because who you are is not defined by what around you what you have around you who you are is defined but what is in you oh ye of little faith praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen you love the Lord so see what he's going to say now all ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of a doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of of the word seek all these things that is very common to everybody that is born everybody on Earth is common to them but for you a predestinated seed you a child of God it must be different that's what he's saying for all these things the nation seek you go you go to places like Dubai you see young you see young young children they are not even to your age they are not even to to your educational level I mean they they are playing in wealth praise the Lord why are we sitting out in this little building this morning I mean they they they children people and their children cruising on the lake praise the Lord maybe they on the cruise or maybe they they are some fun fed and and and they are having what they will call the blast of their life can you call this service the blast of your life do you have to be at the Mall of America before you know you having a blast can we come to church and say let's have a blast let's enjoy the Lord do you ever feel like that in you or you have to go to Las Vegas or you have to go to California and go to some kind of a parking yeah we really had a blast I think when the Holy Ghost comes down and the word of God is being preached and the power of God is fed it's a blast that the believer have that is the believer's blast because it's enough to blast every demon from my mind blast every complex from my spirit are we together oh let's have a blast this morning come on let's have a blast this morning praise the Lord hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand of Praise hallelujah amen amen if I was preaching in a warness church this morning I mean all of those guys will be taking their coat and throwing it all over the place running around the building they having so much energy and I'm telling you praise the Lord sometimes emotion must not drive the service let the word drive us amen for all of these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things he knows it he knows that you have need of it amen oh yeah he knows he knows your need better than you do are we together but rather seek ye the kingdom of God what did we describe as as as as David's treasure one thing will I seek after that's what David said one thing will I seek after that I will DW in the house of the Lord amen all the days of my life amen is that your desire this morning praise the Lord is that your desire and I I I believe that that desire can be Bast amen amen I believe that there can be an increase of that desire one thing without seek after yet Jesus confirming the same thing here but rather seek seek here the kingdom you know what that word means it means discover discover because there are lot of treasure in this Kingdom there are a lot of things that will Amaze you there are things that will capture your mind and you will just be I mean I was I was upset last night and there there are things I was looking at in the word I said oh my God oh my God praise the Lord but seek discover may God help us to find something new every day that he's doing in our life may he help us to find to discover how the grace of God is helping my prayer life how he's helping me in the word how he's helping me I'm you know I'm I'm I'm feeling different I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm thinking different because that's what the kingdom is all about is to be discovered amen amen you know what a Bible word we have for it is called Revelation the Lord revealed to me something was just you just discover something it's being there all of this world you just Discover it oh wow come and see this this thing the Lord just revealed to me are we together but seek here the kingdom of God and Order and uh and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little FL for it is your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom praise the Lord is your father good pleasure now think about a year Solomon was giv the kingom and in and in his kingdom he was given all things he he he he had plenty he had plenty it was it's a kingdom that was [Music] F he never like anything the Bible says those that came at the king's meal never like anything and I pray that when we come to the house of God we will not like anything amen praise the lord we can say that my joy is forth I mean it's a curse to come to the house of God and go back homeside Jesus had his table spread unless we are preaching some kind of a dogat or we we are preaching something unless it's not the Living Word but if you pray to God that God should speak to you you pray to God that you you want your soul to be fed if you really talk to almighty God praise the Lord hallelujah and if I what I'm preaching is not feeling your soul then come and talk to me come and tell me S I don't I don't I don't feel fed I mean it it would not be adjusting for me to have you and I'm not feeding your soul it will not be ajusting for you to be praying for the preacher just to come to be entertained and you not you you are not really being fed spiritually come and talk to me are we together oh praise the Lord what a what an awesome God we serve what a wonderful father we serve sorry my brain is not too good like it used to be so have to write things down to remind myself now so let's go into this this morning as we look at it see Jesus here bringing this comparison Solomon in all of his glory can never be compared to one of these in another sense the way Jesus is bringing the the the comparison Solomon in all of his glory cannot be compared to your glory your glory is not a physical Glory your glory is a spirit you see the thing that is that when we were talking on about the Tabernacle that's where I got a taught about this is because what we call the sh the shakina okay it's called It's called The shakina Glory but the glory is called the shakina praise the Lord the Shak the shaking out okay which which best way it is but you see that it was something it was something now on the the the Tabernacle with Moses you have to know the Tabernacle was moved from one place to another there was a beautiful picture I saw but uh Pastor Jim yam show me there last week we were we were helping that group down there and he showed me a very beautiful picture now what it is is that uh uh uh is is a pillow of fire like a light from the heaven right over the the the the the Tabernacle praise the Lord amen now but when it came to Solomon Temple the the the pillow of fire the the the shakana glory was not seen from outside the the the the the glory filled the temple that's what the Bible says the glory of the Lord filled the temple that even the priest did not had a place to minister praise the Lord now so you see what God was witnessing to those people is that he want his children to live in his glory he want his glory to to fill our homes his glory will fill our hearts and fill our mind the glory of the Lord will just be all around us are we together oh my sin is not a good thing our natural birth is not a good thing neither denomination has helped this the the situation because it have just kept us in in in such a deprived state when God had bestowed so much Glory upon you praise the Lord so much Glory are we together let's look at another one let's look at another another scripture yeah uh we we want a look at are you are we together Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chapter 12 we read Luke chapter 12 let's read Matthew chapter 12 Jesus again he's coming in another comparison here I'll read I read a few quotes to you but I I want to I want to I want to you to grab my thoughts what I'm going this morning amen Matthew chapter 12 let's read verse 24 Matthew 12: 24 Solomon in all his glory you love the Lord did I say 24:42 sorry 42 now Matthew 42 turn it around from 24 to 42 let's read 42 now this is this is the same time here now the the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon Behold a greater then Solomon is here praise the Lord now Jesus is is saying he stay in this in this place of comparison he's trying to grab our attention to something he's trying to draw our attention so we can be able to appreciate something here he says the queen of the South it will rise up against this this generation she came from far she she travel hundreds of miles and like brother BR would dribe it with all the danger that was on on the road because she heard about the wisdom of Solomon she traveled and she sat the Bible says she sat she asked Solomon all of her questions praise the lord and there was now one that she asked that he did not answer but yet Jesus is identifying something here just like he brought the lady on the other side yeah he saying also a greater than Solomon amen he says a greater than Solomon is here so when you look at you look at Solomon Glory you can also realize that there is a greater glory than what Solomon have remember that Solomon was a type of Jesus Christ just like Joseph was a type of Jesus just like Isaac was a type of Jesus they were all proning to the promised son and here he coming on the scene and he says you you you seen Solomon Glory you heard about it but I'm telling you a greater than Solomon is here then the kind of mind now is looking around and says well we see you you only wear only one Rob Solomon changed his Rob every minute but the greater than Solomon had only one fly Rob praise the Lord but what did the glory that he had that was God in flesh amen the glory that he had is that he was God in flesh praise the Lord that he was now born of a sex birth but he was born of a virgin birth and God was wearing his flesh Solomon was wearing clothes from all the nation but God was wearing this man flesh and that's the same thing God want to wear your flesh I'm looking for room to preach I'm looking for room to preach because I'm feeling inspired praise the Lord hallelujah amen he could change his clothes by meaning and meaning and meaning and hour and and he come then he get another rope around his neck and another thing on him and and then he just Shunk it down and he pick up another one again and wear it Jesus had one Rob and even at his crucification they gamble over his rob it did not had no value to him because he know that God almighty God was wearing his flesh whatever Solomon was wearing was made by men falling men but God was wearing that body that came out of a virgin God was wearing that body that sisting element God was wearing it praise the Lord I was reading something I hope I can find it this morning uh uh uh uh they describ Solomon Throne it was made out of gold it had two lions when you clim into the step of his throne it was made out of gold out of gold it was not painted yellow amen they did not paint it yellow it was made out of gold praise the Lord but where is the throne that the greater than Solomon where is his throne he says the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my I first told I can't dwell in a house like Solomon but give me a body a body will that give me that almighty God will choose to dwell in your heart as a throne praise the lord we be captured with with oh wow wow see the go wow praise the Lord and yet we can see that Glory that almighty God has choose your heart as his throne and he's saying it's greater than Solomon it's greater than Solomon Throne Solomon Throne is stuck one place but my Throne can move about I can be I can do in this one and D in this one and move everywhere that I want greater than Solomon is here a greater than Solomon is right here praise the Lord amen praise the Lord when you feeling broke and you don't have money tell yourself a greater than Solomon is sitting right here there is more Glory here than what is physical oh my goodness man I'm not even started yet people praise the Lord talk about Solomon Temple talk about Solomon Temple it have never been one even even the rebuilding of the temple has never come to the same level it have never come to the glory that it had when Solomon built it because the the person that built the temple after the temple was destroyed you have to remember the Babylonians looted Solomon Temple and they destroy it and the person that rebuilt the temple was Hera well he's not a jewel either so he would not have the value he just buildt it so that people can have a place to worship he won't have the same kind of a value and inspiration that Solomon had so since that time they have never had a temple like Solomon had but the one that said greater than Solomon is here praise the Lord he said destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up praise the Lord amen Solomon Temple was destroyed it can never gets his glory but he said destroy this temple in 3 days I will raise it up from mortar to immortality oh man may God help us that we will not just be entertained by the word but we will be so captured by this word we will be so captured that we will drive into discovering discovering the beauty the treasure the thing that the father have in store for you the thing that the father have in store for you Solomon Glory was temporary amen his glory was temporary the the queen of the South came praise the Lord but you know the people that are coming to hear the wisdom of the greater than Solomon is now the queen of the South is the bride it's his own bride his own Queen are coming to hear his wisdom that's the reason why his word thrill our hearts because the the the the the the the queen of the South she was coming to hear his wisdom and hear the thing about uh Israel and Amaya the god of Israel but when we come to hear the word we are not talking about a foreign God we're talking about our God we are talking about our kingdom when we talk about the kingdom of of of Heaven we're not talking about a kingdom that we talking about our kingdom we're talking about a kingdom that is promised to be in you Jesus said the kingdom of God is in you you see that that that is the thing when you get yourself in the word you are embracing the word you're making yourself a part of the word you are not a stranger to the word it's almost like you standing here looking at it no no no you are you are taking the word wow that's my kingdom that's my king that's my Lord that's my promise we're not talking about somebody else when we talk about the bride it's not it's not the woman down there in St Paul with the governor when we talking about the bride we're talking about you praise the lord we are talking about you I'm talking about you I can't even see smile on your faces oh my God oh my God oh my God what's wrong what's wrong are you surprised I'm I'm not gossiping about you I'm telling you what the word says about you that's why we must rejoice in the word because the word is talking about [Music] you we're not talking about somebody far away oh man I really want to preach please make me preach praise the Lord we're not talking about an arra thing we are talking about you that's your promise that's your word that's your kingdom that's your message when we read the prophet that's your prophet thank Solomon in all his glory can never be compared Solomon in all his glory can never be compared to the glory that is Hing in your life you know what the new birth brings to you you know what the new birth brings to you to be born again it's not a mental think it's not a change mind is not taking on a on a a church membership you know what the new birth brings to you you know denomination have made this thing about church you got to put your name on the church book you know you got to be part of the church you know that the church I will born in that the church I would die in that have nothing to do with the new birth the the new birth brings an identity praise the Lord it brings an identity it it's it's it's almost like Paul was arrested they arrested Paul the Jews well oh this man is blaspheming they arrest him and then the the the Roman soldiers started pulling him Paul all he had to say is he said he said um you're pulling him and so oh you are disrupting the city you are disrupting the city you know they're just pushing him and he just say he said I myself I'm a Roman as soon as he said he was a Roman on they back off because they knew that he had a citizenship he had a citizenship that they must respect praise the Lord as soon as he said I myself I'm a Roman the backup he was now born a Roman he he he just God citizenship as a Roman like like many of us God citizenship As Americans and from that time they started to treat him different praise the Lord amen amen oh as soon as the devil and his demon power can know that you are a child of the king praise the Lord now when you think it when you tell him when you are able to identify yourself as as a child of the king the devil must back up praise the Lord he must back up when you when you start to tell him that this world is not my home not only when we sing it when when it's become our confession praise the Lord are we together am I making sense this morning or am I kind of for just shouting all over the place amen hallelujah well if I'm making noise anyway I'm shouting to tell you that I'm alive today is my birthday I'm alive praise the Lord yeah we must not be celebrating me we must be celebrating him amen amen let's take something here from wisdom versus faith I hope I didn't ruin this one but yeah let's let's let's just take something here the lady told hard you remember my not long ago few years on Mr lady he told where Jesus said neither does he speak and yet I said unto you that Solomon all of his glory was not array like one how that lady draws to make a pretty for what just to be given out her glory was now for herself she draws just so she can be able to give out praise the Lord Solomon in all of his glory the pass by sniff smell the perfume the bees flies right in into his heart and take the very horing right away from him he just gives it freely told to do it Hallelujah there's a real man of God Pastor ly Reverend Mr lady yes sir there TOS at the word laid on his face and cried to God God I can see where this will meet here year is a a got to come by the word when you see and and God give it to you then go freely amen not to have some big campaign if you guarantee me so many thousand do I will come Jesus said Solomon in all of his glory is not a ray like it said consider the lady the poor fellow have to suffer like like everything to get what he gets and laugh at made fun of and all the big ecclesiastical kick him out and call him all kinds of dead names but he still right with that word touring day night laid in the valley he's in a place where he can draw from the rivers of Life praise the Lord remember we we we we stay on our subject a prisoner of love that's what I thought I was going to preach this morning but uh I'm I'm still working on it I'm still working on it I'm still praying there there are many things that that that came that that started open up to me and uh thinking about subject you know and uh I mean even even uh uh I was thinking about a part were uh you know just the subject prisoner of love you know uh uh when when you get when you get married you get into a prison of love amen pretty soon you have you you you have a you have a uh uh a praising Commander okay taking instruction from your wife taking instruction from your husband I'm not saying it in a bad way I'm saying it in a good sense because while your vow before the Lord has locked you it's not a contract that you can go in for two months and you get out your vow is still death do you part praise the Lord and that's where many many prisoners suffer in prison when they don't want to take command and that's where many homes and many relationships suffer are we together so I was just looking at all of these different thing I'm not preaching that I'm just telling you I'm still working on that subject praise the Lord I'm still working on it I still working on it don't worry we will get there are we together now now this morning I was I was looking right there in position in Christ let's let's read uh a few things from there position in Christ I put post it up there and this one kind of for hit me it hit me in a way that there that was so beautiful let me read it to you we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us and we should be so sweet and so pleasant so kind so Christlike in our life this is not just a makeover it's not a makeover it's not it's not it's not something that we can we can no it's it's all part of the lady's character you got to work at it amen you got you got to stay in the presence of Christ you got to fall in love with him you got to say Jesus take this thing out of me I don't like it amen I don't like it you have to find it in yourself and say Lord I don't like this thing so Christ like in our life it takes everyday life you see brother B say it takes every everyday life for us to come to that place not just a Sunday morning thing it takes an everyday life what what what we don't realize is our everyday life that we live is part of your internal life praise the Lord because you don't get internal life when you get there Jesus said if you believe and you receive him you he will give you eternal life it begins right here so if you are a son of God and you have the Holy Ghost your everyday life is part of your internal life you are just living portion of it behind the side of the river you see the church word has made those things something for the future when you die you go to heaven then you get eternal life they make it for the future so it deprive us it deprive the people from breaking into that reality of Christ life because they make it for the future when you die you go to heaven and Jesus will give you eternal life it begins right here praise the Lord so I don't know are you using your internal life to force you using your eternal life to fight when eternal life supposed to be living for others consider the lady of the field how it grow it told and spin yet I said unto you Solomon in all of his glory it's not a raay like one Solomon had robs that was AR raay with glorious skin and needle work in things that was how that guy clothes was very expensive very expensive I mean he could run some of our billion near Brook if they would just want to buy one of his attire if you will bring that nature of work year now to this present market value it will run some of our billing here broke his clothes was neither work that wasn't what he was talking about you see so brother bam said that was not what Jesus was talking about you were not talking about you know the skin the Glorious King and needle work no in order for a lady to grow it has to toore both day and night praise the Lord amen it has to to is something that you we have to be conscious of we just don't go go out of church step out of church and then we forget that we you are a son of God you forget that you are a daughter of God and have the devil to have the best of you until the next service it's something that we to we toore it praise the Lord I'm not going to allow this thing to back me I'm going to fight my way through I'm going to rebuke the devil I'm going to stand Toe to Toe with him it has to told and there both they and night what do you want to come up back here on the little end of the line if the righteous be scarcely saved where will the Sinners that's the unbeliever and the ungodly the man that he the word and refus to walk in it that's ungodliness that's ungodliness hearing the word and can never come to a place of Victory can never come to a place of position in Romans chapter 1 Paul identify that amen say the wrath of God is against them that hear the word and take the word of God in on righteousness God man man that hear the word and refuse to walk in it now what are you going to do now see where he's going to take this now he's going to take it straight into ad that is the thing that kind of hit me we look at this adoption thing and the way we look at it the way we look at it brother brandham gave us a picture of what would take place in the East okay a son on a tutorship and a father right ready to adopt him will now bring set up a stage and and make it public but it's it's completely different the way that he's dealing with us under the Holy Ghost amen the way he dealing with us honor the Holy Ghost praise the Lord adoption plac in position where they are show me word they are God calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something happen positionally placing his sons getting getting him into order just exactly with the same thing he just as in much Authority his word just as good as the ACT Angel better amen even his words is better than the ACT injur that's the Son of God now I was I was telling on that Authority because you read in the Bible there the Bible say Jesus Jesus says I have given you power to cast out scorpions praise the Lord now so that that now is taking in a place where the church go and and and you know we try to use H you know physical Satan I rebuke you Satan I you know you you try because you think it's power that's the way you understand power but the prophet will come and let us know that he says see right at this fourway stop a policeman can come he uh slim and you know uh uh weak in the body but he can come right in the middle of that road and he can put his hands up praise the Lord and in a truck with hundreds of tons when you see that man standing in the middle of the road the D the driver has to run for the brakes praise the Lord now as I was thinking about that I thought also what if a man that is a police officer if he's not dressed right even though he's a police officer praise the Lord amen he have his bash in his pocket he's wearing some kind of a shirs and he get right in the middle of the road and says stop I'm a police officer praise the Lord so you see it's not uh it's not the man that the truck tried to to to to to respect is the uniform he's wearing a uniform that has been given to him by the state praise the Lord he's wearing a badge that tells that he has the authority to do that work praise the Lord so you see it's not it's not the shouting it's not him standing there and streaming Satan about you in Jesus no is when a Son of God can dress right and live right a daughter of God can take a position in the word and live right and
