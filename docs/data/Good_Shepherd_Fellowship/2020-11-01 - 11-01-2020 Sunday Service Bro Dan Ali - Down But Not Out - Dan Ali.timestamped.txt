[44:44] shall we be seated for a while
[44:51] good to see you once again
[44:54] on such a beautiful sunday morning
[44:57] musicians god bless you you can take
[45:00] your seats
[45:06] um in fact as
[45:11] i was seated over there just
[45:15] getting prepared in a way and i saw that
[45:19] 10-minute clip about the missionary trip
[45:23] somewhere in tanzania in fact it broke
[45:26] my heart
[45:30] that people go through a lot
[45:35] to serve the same god we are serving
[45:39] just look at the church
[45:43] why they were seated having fellowship
[45:48] that was not something in isolation
[45:51] you can find 1001 places like that
[45:56] spread across the continent
[46:01] and as a matter of fact here in america
[46:05] we just jump in our cast and we drive to
[46:07] church
[46:09] people walk for hours
[46:13] to go to church and they walk
[46:16] hours to come back home and sometimes
[46:19] they come and there is not even food to
[46:21] eat
[46:22] in fact i don't know how many of you
[46:25] know what it means to glean
[46:28] it's one thing being a farmer you have
[46:31] your farm
[46:32] and your crop and your harvest it's
[46:35] another thing
[46:36] that the farmer finishes harvesting
[46:38] their crop and then you
[46:40] go in to see whether there were some
[46:44] leftovers
[46:45] and then you pick those leftovers that's
[46:48] what we call cleaning
[46:51] so as a matter of fact if you were
[46:53] standing outside and somebody was
[46:54] harvesting their field
[46:56] you'll be praying that they should just
[46:58] they shouldn't even enter some areas
[47:01] so you can go and have a bumper gleam
[47:05] in fact and anytime it's not you have to
[47:08] reduce yourself
[47:10] to do something like that
[47:13] and anytime you saw somebody doing that
[47:17] they were doing that to put food on the
[47:19] table
[47:22] and for somebody to go and do that to
[47:24] raise up
[47:25] a house for the lord and to refuse
[47:29] help my goodness
[47:36] we have no excuse excuses
[47:39] we have no excuse whatsoever
[47:44] we need a lot of sister marias in this
[47:47] day and age
[47:50] praise be to god
[47:53] in fact you know the devil has always
[47:56] been a liar
[47:58] he has been a liar from the start and he
[48:01] is going to be a liar in the end
[48:06] you know um i believe he's a very good
[48:09] rnd guy rnd is just
[48:12] research and development i happen to be
[48:15] in that field
[48:17] if you are in the r d field don't get
[48:19] offended
[48:20] i'm not talking about you i'm just
[48:22] talking about the operation
[48:23] what goes on in that field that there is
[48:27] a standard
[48:28] recipe and then what
[48:31] these guys do they just take a little
[48:34] from the standard
[48:36] add a little just to create something
[48:39] new
[48:40] because the people are craving for it
[48:43] we have a standard recipe the word of
[48:46] god is the standard
[48:48] anything less than that is unacceptable
[48:52] the devil will just come take a little
[48:55] here
[48:56] add a little there and when you accept
[48:58] it
[48:59] you accept damnation
[49:02] amen the other day just last sunday
[49:05] after service
[49:07] i went home and there was a call when i
[49:09] picked the call it was my son joshua
[49:12] it's a daddy i have always been having
[49:17] this
[49:17] notion that heaven is going to be boring
[49:20] and um i heard a preacher talking about
[49:23] this talking about that
[49:25] and i had the opportunity to deal with
[49:27] those things
[49:29] and i told him heaven is not a boring
[49:33] place
[49:37] the bible says in first corinthians 2 9
[49:41] that the eyes have not sinned nor the
[49:44] ear head
[49:46] neither had the man the heart of man
[49:48] conceived
[49:50] what god has prepared for his children
[49:53] or for them that
[49:54] fear him or love him
[49:57] now when you look at this scripture
[50:01] what does it tell you it tells you that
[50:04] there are simply no ways to describe it
[50:09] there are no adjectives to describe it
[50:15] and as a matter of fact when you go to
[50:16] revelation 21
[50:21] while you are so seated if you can just
[50:24] turn to revelation 21 just take
[50:26] a few scriptures there
[50:41] revelations 21
[50:44] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[50:49] for the first heaven and the first eight
[50:52] were passed away and there was
[50:54] no mercy and i john saw the holy city
[50:58] new jerusalem
[51:00] coming down from god out of heaven
[51:03] prepared as a bright
[51:04] adorned for her husband and i had a
[51:07] great voice
[51:08] out of heaven saying behold the
[51:11] tabernacle of god is with men
[51:13] and he will dwell with them and there
[51:16] shall be his people
[51:18] and god himself shall be with them
[51:21] and be their god and god shall wipe away
[51:25] all tears
[51:26] from their eyes and there shall be no
[51:29] more death
[51:30] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[51:33] there be any more pain
[51:34] for the former things are passed away
[51:38] and he does sat upon the throne said
[51:41] behold
[51:42] i make all things new
[51:45] and he said unto me right for these
[51:48] words
[51:49] are true and faithful praise be to god
[51:53] and he said unto me it is done
[51:57] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[52:01] and the end i will give unto him that is
[52:04] a thirst
[52:05] of the fountain of water of life freely
[52:08] he that overcometh shall inherit
[52:12] all things and i will be his god
[52:16] and he shall be my son we are sons and
[52:19] daughters of god
[52:21] he that overcometh
[52:26] we ought to overcome there are things to
[52:28] overcome
[52:29] praise be to god now when you read
[52:32] something like this
[52:33] does it tell you that heaven is going to
[52:35] be a boring place
[52:40] death is abolished
[52:43] there are no motifs to steal
[52:46] no more armed robbery no sickness
[52:50] no disease no heartaches
[52:53] no headaches no hate no greed
[52:58] no selfishness no temptation
[53:02] praise be to god what is better than
[53:04] this
[53:06] and the devil can just come and pollute
[53:08] people's mind
[53:10] look and when i left with them i said
[53:12] you know what
[53:13] i just don't know where it came from in
[53:15] an instant i said in any case if
[53:17] heaven is going to be a boring place a
[53:20] boring heaven
[53:22] is by far better than a busy hell
[53:24] [Music]
[53:26] praise be to god
[53:32] he said daddy is hell going to be busy i
[53:36] said yes
[53:38] hell is going to be a busy place because
[53:40] the bible says there'll be nothing of
[53:42] teeth
[53:43] they'll be wailing they'll be shouting
[53:45] so it's going to be busy
[53:50] you know
[53:56] when i was asking why don't you come to
[53:58] church he was blaming it on
[54:00] transportation
[54:02] and again just look at what the clip was
[54:06] just saw
[54:07] i'm very mindful of what the youth
[54:10] meeting
[54:12] i will not keep you here a minute longer
[54:14] than we are supposed to
[54:16] it's not a promise though but
[54:21] praise the lord yes
[54:24] you know if the desire is there
[54:28] god will always make a way
[54:33] it's a genuine excuse to say that i have
[54:35] no transportation
[54:37] but is it worthy of the gospel brother
[54:40] brother said a
[54:41] life full of excuses is not worthy of
[54:43] the gospel
[54:45] for some of us oh it's because of
[54:47] transportation that is why i don't come
[54:49] to church
[54:50] for some of us it's because of work
[54:54] sometimes it's not just work because
[54:58] you realize that during service whether
[55:01] wednesdays or sundays
[55:02] you are free to come to church but
[55:06] it's because of the little over time
[55:10] that keeps you away from service
[55:14] and sometimes it's because of school
[55:16] work
[55:17] that keeps you away from service
[55:20] sometimes you don't have the time
[55:23] the 24 hours a day we have it's not even
[55:26] sufficient for some of us here
[55:28] so there is no time for god
[55:31] and for some of us it's none of the
[55:33] above
[55:35] all you know is that i'm not coming i
[55:37] don't even know why
[55:40] you know if for nothing at all
[55:44] if for nothing at all it's better to
[55:47] come to church
[55:48] when the church does have opened up to
[55:50] sit in the house
[55:52] a man and his family left for church one
[55:55] day
[55:56] they got back home they didn't realize
[55:58] the house
[56:00] they just saw the police light around
[56:03] and before they got there
[56:04] there was a semi the head was in the
[56:06] building and the trailer was outside
[56:11] so if they were in the house just
[56:13] imagine what was going to happen
[56:16] by coming to church and going but you
[56:19] don't know what god takes you from
[56:22] there are a lot of dangers that god
[56:24] takes us away from
[56:26] which we have no idea about
[56:31] if for nothing at all it's better to be
[56:34] in the house of god
[56:35] when service is going on than to choose
[56:38] to do otherwise
[56:43] you may feel sometimes that oh i come
[56:46] and i don't benefit i'm not getting
[56:47] anything
[56:48] it's still better to be in the house of
[56:51] god
[56:52] you know i just love the wild
[56:56] unfortunately here in america even the
[56:59] wild
[57:01] it's not even a while
[57:05] i don't care how far you go in the bush
[57:07] you also see light
[57:09] you see water there is gas you can heat
[57:13] up
[57:13] what but you know i love the wild
[57:20] you can set fire
[57:23] and then you go to the river and then
[57:25] pick a wet log
[57:28] or you can cut a fresh branch fresh with
[57:31] leaves on
[57:32] and then put it right in the fire
[57:36] it is not going to bend it will never
[57:40] bend
[57:41] but so long as it is keeping company
[57:45] with those that are on fire something
[57:48] happens
[57:51] it is getting too dry
[57:54] it is not lighting up but the water
[57:57] inside
[57:58] from the tip is drying it is drying
[58:02] and it's drying and then over time
[58:05] it begins to catch fire
[58:09] you may come and feel you are not
[58:10] getting anything it's because you don't
[58:12] even know what you are getting
[58:15] but when you stay amen you stay under
[58:19] the anointing of the world
[58:22] the worldliness in you is gradually
[58:25] being pushed out
[58:27] you are getting dry that ain't right
[58:30] catching up with fire and you don't even
[58:32] know it
[58:35] and when that white love catches fire
[58:38] just pick it up and you see at the end
[58:41] of it you see some
[58:43] water something like
[58:46] grease coming it's just paging the water
[58:49] out of his
[58:50] system when a man or a woman gets to
[58:53] that point
[58:55] even when you come to church and they
[58:56] check god's help i know service is going
[58:58] on
[58:58] you can even pass through the window
[59:01] because
[59:02] something has happened to your life
[59:04] praise be to god
[59:06] amen so sometimes you come and it's like
[59:09] oh i didn't get anything
[59:10] you got something brother brother said
[59:13] there is no way you would come and go
[59:15] back the same
[59:18] something happens anytime you come
[59:22] praise be to god
[59:26] brother branham said that when you take
[59:30] the holy spirit out of the church
[59:32] it becomes a lodge and a lord
[59:35] is one of the most secretive societies
[59:38] in the world
[59:40] very demonic and we don't want no we
[59:44] don't want a lodge
[59:46] we want a church that is filled with the
[59:48] power of god
[59:50] that when you come you can see yourself
[59:54] in the mirror of the word of god
[59:58] see yourself as you are
[1:00:01] and then cry out for mercy praise be to
[1:00:05] god
[1:00:07] just remember that your services to god
[1:00:10] would never be invented i was so
[1:00:14] much touched about what sister maria
[1:00:17] was is doing um
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:21] yeah we we have a very comfortable place
[1:00:24] very cozy we don't care whether it's
[1:00:25] raining or not
[1:00:27] we don't care whether the sun is shining
[1:00:28] or not but you think of
[1:00:31] a place where people would be and they
[1:00:34] are praying that oh
[1:00:35] there shouldn't be rain because you are
[1:00:38] going to have service
[1:00:39] if the rain comes it's going to destroy
[1:00:42] our service
[1:00:44] just imagine where you would stand
[1:00:48] on that day with all the opportunity we
[1:00:51] have
[1:00:55] may the lord be merciful
[1:00:58] praise be to god as i said i'm very
[1:01:01] mindful of my time today
[1:01:04] and i'm not going to keep you here for
[1:01:05] long
[1:01:07] but there is something i want us to look
[1:01:09] at
[1:01:10] in the book of judges if we can stand
[1:01:13] for the reading of the word
[1:01:22] judges 13
[1:01:26] 1-7
[1:01:34] judges 13 1-7
[1:01:38] and the children of israel did evil
[1:01:41] again in the sight of the lord
[1:01:46] and the lord delivered them
[1:01:49] into the hand of the philistines
[1:01:52] 40 years
[1:01:55] and there was a certain man of zorah
[1:01:59] of the family of danites whose name was
[1:02:03] manual and his wife was barren
[1:02:07] and bear not and the angel of the lord
[1:02:11] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[1:02:13] her behold
[1:02:15] now thou art barren embarrass not
[1:02:20] but thou shalt conceive and
[1:02:23] bear a son now therefore beware
[1:02:27] i pray i pray
[1:02:30] and drink not wine no strong drink
[1:02:35] and it's not any unclean thing
[1:02:39] for lo thou shall conceive and bear a
[1:02:42] son
[1:02:44] and no razor shall come on his head
[1:02:48] for the child shall be another right
[1:02:52] unto god from the womb
[1:02:55] and he shall be he shall begin to
[1:02:58] deliver israel
[1:03:00] out of the hand of the philistines then
[1:03:03] the woman came and told her husband
[1:03:05] saying
[1:03:06] a man of god came unto me and his
[1:03:09] countenance was like
[1:03:10] the countenance of an angel of god
[1:03:13] very terrible but i asked him
[1:03:17] not whence he was neither told he me
[1:03:20] his name but he said unto me
[1:03:23] behold thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:03:27] son
[1:03:29] and now drink no wine no strong drink
[1:03:34] neither eat any unclean thing for the
[1:03:37] child
[1:03:38] shall be another right unto god from the
[1:03:41] womb
[1:03:42] to the day of his death praise be to god
[1:03:47] shall we pray
[1:03:50] our lord and our savior jesus
[1:03:55] we thank thee once again for this
[1:03:56] opportunity we have had to come before
[1:03:58] the old god
[1:04:00] we have come with expectations great
[1:04:02] expectations lord
[1:04:04] on our hearts to hear from you
[1:04:09] we have come because we know
[1:04:13] and we believe that you would meet us at
[1:04:16] the various points of our needs
[1:04:19] we have come because we know that will
[1:04:22] not leave your presence the way we have
[1:04:23] coming
[1:04:25] we have come trusting and believing
[1:04:28] that we behold your faith oh god
[1:04:31] we are so grateful for everything you've
[1:04:34] done for us
[1:04:36] we ask you dear lord jesus to come and
[1:04:38] take over the service lord
[1:04:41] touch every heart lord touch every soul
[1:04:44] in ways only you can and let our name be
[1:04:47] praised this morning
[1:04:49] father in the name of jesus we pray and
[1:04:52] we thank you so much
[1:04:54] for having ahead and answered our praise
[1:04:57] amen shall we be seated
[1:05:14] i have titled my message this morning
[1:05:18] down
[1:05:19] but not out
[1:05:23] down but not out
[1:05:28] it's one thing to be down
[1:05:32] and it's another thing to be out
[1:05:36] uh let's just take the boxing arena
[1:05:40] it's one thing when you are boxed down
[1:05:44] or you are knocked down and it's another
[1:05:47] thing
[1:05:48] when you are knocked out
[1:05:52] to be knocked down doesn't mean
[1:05:55] that you are knocked out
[1:06:00] praise be to god down
[1:06:03] but not out
[1:06:07] i used to love boxing a lot
[1:06:11] not because i was an amateur boxer
[1:06:13] coming up
[1:06:14] but i just loved that spot for whatever
[1:06:17] reason
[1:06:19] and i would sit for very long i was
[1:06:21] watching boxing
[1:06:24] and there was one boxing boat i watched
[1:06:29] just for the purpose of this
[1:06:31] illustration
[1:06:32] let's say one was in the right corner
[1:06:34] the other was in the yellow corner
[1:06:38] and the one in the yellow corner
[1:06:42] almost every single round he was knocked
[1:06:45] down
[1:06:47] almost every single round he visited the
[1:06:50] canvas
[1:06:53] but he never gave up
[1:06:57] he was so bloody and he was so swollen
[1:07:00] up
[1:07:01] and i sat there and i was asking myself
[1:07:05] why would he not give up
[1:07:08] and i was again asking if he is not
[1:07:10] giving up
[1:07:11] why is that afraid not discontinuing the
[1:07:13] fight
[1:07:15] because the refrigerant uses discretion
[1:07:19] to stop the fight but the referee wasn't
[1:07:21] doing that
[1:07:23] and again his coach he's at the corner
[1:07:26] there
[1:07:26] the coach can also throw in the towel
[1:07:29] and stop the fight
[1:07:31] but for every time they went on recess
[1:07:34] the court will just come and tell him
[1:07:36] you beat him
[1:07:38] you can do this trust me you can fight
[1:07:41] this guy you are going to win this fight
[1:07:43] and the guy is there nodding his head
[1:07:45] with all the blood
[1:07:47] and then they will go in he will go down
[1:07:49] again
[1:07:51] and as they continued fighting
[1:07:54] they both just landed blows on each
[1:07:57] other's jaw and
[1:07:58] both of them went down remember that
[1:08:01] there was one that was already used
[1:08:04] to falling down and rising up
[1:08:07] so when they went down i knew that he
[1:08:10] was going to rise up
[1:08:11] and he never disappointed me he got onto
[1:08:14] his feet
[1:08:15] but the one that went down who was
[1:08:18] supposedly winning the fight
[1:08:20] was just lying down the referee counted
[1:08:24] one two three
[1:08:27] up to ten he never woke up they had to
[1:08:30] come and carry him out
[1:08:34] down but not out
[1:08:38] he was knocked down several times
[1:08:41] but he was never knocked out he came
[1:08:44] back
[1:08:45] and he won the fight praise be to god
[1:08:49] i want you to have this picture in your
[1:08:51] mind as we travel together this morning
[1:08:55] now we read about something
[1:09:00] the children of god israel had done evil
[1:09:04] and god gave them up to the philistines
[1:09:07] 40 years
[1:09:09] to rule over them but it got to the
[1:09:13] point
[1:09:14] i believe the table was turning
[1:09:17] and god sent forth
[1:09:23] something to deliver the children of
[1:09:26] israel
[1:09:27] from the hands of the philistines
[1:09:30] now there is something i want us to take
[1:09:32] note of
[1:09:34] the bible says
[1:09:37] that he was a nazirite
[1:09:41] from the womb praise be to god
[1:09:46] and he was going to be another right
[1:09:48] unto his death
[1:09:52] but in between
[1:09:55] in between from the womb
[1:09:59] to death in between the bible didn't
[1:10:02] tell us
[1:10:04] that trouble he was going to go through
[1:10:07] the bible didn't tell us the storm that
[1:10:10] was going to come his way
[1:10:12] that things he was going to go through
[1:10:14] the bible didn't talk about it
[1:10:16] but the bible said he was a nazarite
[1:10:19] from the womb
[1:10:20] and he would be another right even unto
[1:10:22] death
[1:10:23] praise be to god if you are a child of
[1:10:27] god
[1:10:27] you were before the foundation of this
[1:10:29] world
[1:10:30] and you are going to die a child of god
[1:10:34] there is nothing that can change it
[1:10:38] before you were born you were a child of
[1:10:41] god
[1:10:42] a son or a daughter and i don't care
[1:10:45] what it
[1:10:46] is that happens between
[1:10:49] your breath till the time you die
[1:10:54] i don't care what it is that you go
[1:10:55] through and god is not interested in
[1:10:58] your fault
[1:10:59] that is why the bible says that just
[1:11:01] shall fall seven times
[1:11:02] and rise up again
[1:11:06] amen i know seven times by now you are
[1:11:08] counting how many times have i fallen
[1:11:10] already
[1:11:13] i have fallen over 100 times and what am
[1:11:16] i talking about
[1:11:18] seven is the number of completion
[1:11:21] so you can fall and fall completely
[1:11:25] and still never fall out of grace
[1:11:30] praise be to god
[1:11:33] so it doesn't matter you can carry a
[1:11:36] ship
[1:11:36] to the tenth floor of a building and let
[1:11:39] go of it
[1:11:41] it will come and crash and die when you
[1:11:43] come down you will never come and see a
[1:11:44] goat
[1:11:46] you will see a dead sheep children of
[1:11:49] god
[1:11:49] are born we are born of god
[1:11:55] praise be to god whatever
[1:11:59] it is that you may be going through god
[1:12:02] is not looking at all those things the
[1:12:04] fallen
[1:12:04] god is looking at you at the cross line
[1:12:12] he was a nazarite from the womb
[1:12:15] and he will be another right unto death
[1:12:20] but everything that happened in between
[1:12:22] or was going to happen
[1:12:24] was inconsequential amen
[1:12:32] something came
[1:12:36] he was a very very strong man as we all
[1:12:38] know
[1:12:39] my brother brother said that something
[1:12:42] was some tiny fellow
[1:12:45] very tiny you would look at him and
[1:12:48] think you will run him over 10 times in
[1:12:49] a second
[1:12:52] embryo said it had to be so so god can
[1:12:56] take the glory
[1:12:58] if he was like a man the size of goliath
[1:13:02] that would say oh it was his strength
[1:13:05] but you looked at this man the way he
[1:13:08] was
[1:13:09] and he could just go and then catch
[1:13:11] foxes one time he caught 300 foxes
[1:13:15] tied their tails together would catch
[1:13:17] one here one day tidy a test
[1:13:18] one day one they cut tie their tails
[1:13:20] together put a brush
[1:13:22] light at it and they entered the farms
[1:13:24] of the syrians and bent everything down
[1:13:28] amanda would come and lift up an iron
[1:13:31] gate
[1:13:32] over a thousand pounds and not just
[1:13:34] throw it down
[1:13:35] but will climb the hill and go and dump
[1:13:37] it
[1:13:40] when he went into the into the rocks to
[1:13:42] go and hide and the syrians came and
[1:13:44] surrendered the place
[1:13:46] his own brethren went to him and said
[1:13:49] something what have you done again
[1:13:52] the syrians are here
[1:13:55] it's okay we have just come to tie you
[1:13:57] up
[1:13:58] and to hand you over to them so we can
[1:14:01] be at peace
[1:14:03] someone said that is all right just make
[1:14:05] sure
[1:14:06] that you are not coming to fight me it
[1:14:08] is okay to tie me up
[1:14:10] they tied something and went and
[1:14:12] delivered him up
[1:14:14] the series were happy when they got to a
[1:14:18] place
[1:14:19] the spirit of the lord came upon him and
[1:14:22] those costs melted
[1:14:23] and when he turned what did he find the
[1:14:25] jawbone of an ass
[1:14:28] he slew a thousand felicia soldiers with
[1:14:31] a jawbone of an
[1:14:32] ass this tiny fellow
[1:14:36] very insignificant if you should look at
[1:14:38] him in that perspective
[1:14:41] this tells you that god can use anybody
[1:14:45] god can use anything
[1:14:49] it is not your strength when you think
[1:14:51] you are strong
[1:14:53] god is out of it when you think it is
[1:14:55] your wisdom
[1:14:56] god is out of it when you think it's
[1:14:58] your intellect
[1:14:59] god is out of it but when you come to
[1:15:02] that place
[1:15:03] and you can reckon that oh you are just
[1:15:07] i mean you are nobody you are trusting
[1:15:10] on him
[1:15:10] and you are believing in him god will
[1:15:12] never let you down
[1:15:15] god can use anybody
[1:15:19] praise be to god
[1:15:22] that tiny fellow so that baffled
[1:15:26] baffled they the syrians the philistines
[1:15:29] a lot
[1:15:30] i mean who is this guy so they
[1:15:34] knew that it was not his natural
[1:15:37] strength
[1:15:40] they knew that there was a secret behind
[1:15:42] his strength
[1:15:45] and they decided to find out what this
[1:15:49] secret was
[1:15:53] your enemy will never get tired running
[1:15:56] after you
[1:16:00] and we used to have a saying
[1:16:04] that the thing that is throwing after
[1:16:05] you is not complaining of tiredness
[1:16:09] you that are running away are the one
[1:16:11] complaining of tiredness
[1:16:14] no
[1:16:18] the devil would never stop
[1:16:24] they set up to find that secret
[1:16:28] now remember that they couldn't get
[1:16:31] to something they know it was going to
[1:16:35] be a death penalty
[1:16:38] but they had somebody very close to
[1:16:41] something
[1:16:42] through whom they could get to him
[1:16:46] the devil cannot get to you as a child
[1:16:48] of god
[1:16:52] the devil can never get to you
[1:16:56] but the devil can always get to this man
[1:16:59] here
[1:17:01] in order to get to you the devil can
[1:17:03] always get in contact
[1:17:05] with this man here and delilah was
[1:17:08] something's weakness
[1:17:10] and this flesh here is our weakness
[1:17:14] brother branham said you know every man
[1:17:17] has a weak point
[1:17:20] and the devil knows your weak point
[1:17:23] the devil will not attack you why he
[1:17:26] knows you are strong
[1:17:28] when he is coming he comes from the
[1:17:30] weakest point
[1:17:32] because he knows that it's your weak
[1:17:34] point again
[1:17:36] it's like two boxes in the ring when you
[1:17:39] know
[1:17:40] because before the boxes come together
[1:17:42] they watch each other's clip
[1:17:44] and if you ever had an injury
[1:17:47] and they come in the ring with you that
[1:17:50] is what they are focusing on
[1:17:52] because they know that if they can hit
[1:17:54] that place
[1:17:55] they would overcome you and if you also
[1:17:58] know that that is your weak point you
[1:18:00] don't think you're going to allow
[1:18:02] put your head on the line for your
[1:18:04] opponent to hit no way
[1:18:06] you'll guide it and you guide it
[1:18:07] jealously
[1:18:09] so that weak point you have don't let
[1:18:13] the devil capitalize on it or take
[1:18:14] advantage of it
[1:18:16] you have to guard that weak point and
[1:18:18] guard it jealously
[1:18:21] because if the devil is coming that is
[1:18:23] how he is going to come in
[1:18:27] so the philistines knew how to get to
[1:18:31] to something so they came to delilah
[1:18:38] to entice delilah
[1:18:41] with money money is a dangerous thing
[1:18:46] the bible says the love of money
[1:18:50] is the root of all evil and the prayer
[1:18:54] of god made us understand that
[1:18:56] we should watch money
[1:18:59] money has its own influence
[1:19:04] too little of it problem too much of it
[1:19:07] problem
[1:19:13] in fact
[1:19:18] for the love of money human beings can
[1:19:21] do
[1:19:21] anything if the
[1:19:24] grace of god does not help you
[1:19:28] for the love of money you can settle for
[1:19:32] anything
[1:19:35] i have seen people in the name of my
[1:19:37] name
[1:19:38] go into tunnels for weeks
[1:19:43] till they don't know what day what time
[1:19:45] of day it is or the day of the month
[1:19:47] they don't know it
[1:19:52] chasing gold
[1:19:55] and here in america i have had over a
[1:19:58] thousand times already
[1:20:02] how because of insurance money
[1:20:05] husband is killing wife wife is killing
[1:20:07] husband father is killing son
[1:20:09] and it's a mess just for the love of
[1:20:13] money
[1:20:15] one time a husband took his wife on his
[1:20:18] on her birthday
[1:20:19] essa honey i'm going to give you a
[1:20:21] birthday you will never forget
[1:20:24] the wife asked what is it honey he said
[1:20:25] it's a surprise
[1:20:27] and indeed it was a surprise an
[1:20:29] unpleasant surprise that he took his
[1:20:32] wife on her birthday
[1:20:34] in the car and as they were driving they
[1:20:36] went out of town
[1:20:38] and they were still driving and the
[1:20:40] woman asked honey
[1:20:41] where are we going
[1:20:44] i don't remember ever coming this way
[1:20:47] with you for anything it's a honey
[1:20:49] it's a surprise not knowing he had
[1:20:52] already arranged with somebody to kill
[1:20:54] his wife
[1:20:55] they got to the place he pulled up and
[1:20:58] then she asked honey
[1:21:00] i mean what are we doing here
[1:21:04] and then they saw a man coming he rode
[1:21:06] on the glass
[1:21:07] the man just came took a gun shot the
[1:21:09] woman
[1:21:11] but the good news was that after
[1:21:14] shooting the woman
[1:21:16] he turned the gun on the man and shot
[1:21:17] him too
[1:21:23] insurance money is very bad
[1:21:31] do not let the love of money
[1:21:35] ever enter your heart it will ruin your
[1:21:40] life
[1:21:44] in any case why are we carrying the
[1:21:45] money too
[1:21:47] if you are as rich as bill gates what
[1:21:50] are you carrying the money to
[1:21:52] the day you die they just go and bury
[1:21:54] you in that six
[1:21:55] by six hope and that is the end of the
[1:21:58] story
[1:21:59] everything you tried for is useless
[1:22:03] put god first praise be to god
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:09] a somalian woman who had five children
[1:22:13] had a visa where she ended up in
[1:22:16] australia
[1:22:17] and then went back to somalia on a visit
[1:22:21] and then she went out two men arrested
[1:22:24] her
[1:22:25] and they said your husband has paid us
[1:22:27] to kill you
[1:22:29] so what are talking about my husband is
[1:22:31] dead he said no you have a new husband
[1:22:33] the one who just got married to in
[1:22:36] australia
[1:22:38] the woman they didn't believe it they
[1:22:40] called the husband's number
[1:22:42] and spoke with the husband and they said
[1:22:44] we have done the job
[1:22:46] he said guys send me the picture i want
[1:22:47] to be very sure say okay we'll send you
[1:22:49] the picture
[1:22:51] and the other woman is that husband's
[1:22:52] voice is that his number i said yes
[1:22:56] and what made me to read that i had i
[1:22:58] saw the caption
[1:22:59] a woman who attended her own funeral
[1:23:02] i said what is this let me read it
[1:23:06] so the man thought oh i have killed a
[1:23:07] woman already
[1:23:09] and was preparing the purpose to go for
[1:23:10] the insurance money so they did the
[1:23:12] funeral
[1:23:13] on the day of the funeral the woman
[1:23:15] walks into the funeral home
[1:23:20] praise be to god why insurance money
[1:23:24] he is behind bars now
[1:23:28] the love of money money can let people
[1:23:31] stoop so
[1:23:32] low and live like dogs
[1:23:37] live a wretched and a filthy life and
[1:23:40] they will make you think that they are
[1:23:41] enjoying life
[1:23:42] they are not enjoying life
[1:23:47] they came and enticed her with money
[1:23:50] and she went before before something and
[1:23:54] we know the story
[1:23:55] how she tried to dig in i mean
[1:23:59] something would give her one clue and
[1:24:02] delilah would have the man hiding only
[1:24:05] to realize that no
[1:24:06] it wasn't it and the ladder would just
[1:24:09] come oh something
[1:24:10] you don't love me something you are a
[1:24:13] killer something you hate me
[1:24:14] something you are not telling me the
[1:24:16] truth i don't even know who you are
[1:24:18] until the bible says something so god
[1:24:20] vexed
[1:24:21] and he had to tell her the truth
[1:24:24] but you know delilah was not samson's
[1:24:27] enemy
[1:24:29] samson's enemy was something
[1:24:34] he was his own enemy
[1:24:37] because he saw all the signs
[1:24:42] but the brother said it is not how close
[1:24:44] you get to sin
[1:24:46] without sinning that makes you spiritual
[1:24:49] it shows how reckless you are
[1:24:53] to show that you are a spiritual person
[1:24:55] when you see sin
[1:24:56] you keep your distance away from it
[1:24:58] because the bible says that we should
[1:25:00] flee
[1:25:01] from every appearance of evil
[1:25:06] if you keep hanging around sin
[1:25:10] if you keep hanging around evil
[1:25:13] guess what you are going to fall for it
[1:25:18] when i lived once in northern ghana
[1:25:22] we were drawing water from the wells
[1:25:24] it's not the american
[1:25:26] wells here you can just enter the
[1:25:28] hardware call it
[1:25:29] just be in the house and press a button
[1:25:31] and then the water flows through the
[1:25:33] well
[1:25:33] into the pipe no we go there and we draw
[1:25:36] it with
[1:25:37] buckets with rope and they are open
[1:25:40] wells
[1:25:43] sometimes it will rain and to be so full
[1:25:46] you can't even tell which is the well
[1:25:48] and where the road is
[1:25:51] a very dangerous place now
[1:25:55] sometimes you have a heat goat i don't
[1:25:57] know he got is very stubborn
[1:25:59] i never saw the female goal do that but
[1:26:02] he goes
[1:26:03] they come and then they peep inside the
[1:26:06] open well
[1:26:07] and then they look inside and then they
[1:26:10] are going around it
[1:26:12] and then you see somebody chasing it
[1:26:14] away
[1:26:15] it will go and then stop when you're
[1:26:18] telling you are going
[1:26:19] when you turn your back you see the he
[1:26:20] got coming back
[1:26:23] and when it comes it doesn't go anywhere
[1:26:26] if you just come and stop around the
[1:26:27] world again
[1:26:29] just be looking inside and going around
[1:26:30] it if you are the owner of the he goat
[1:26:35] just get the fire ready get some pepper
[1:26:37] and salt
[1:26:40] you will soon eat pepper soup
[1:26:44] you know you know water has a mirroring
[1:26:47] effect
[1:26:48] when you look inside the water you can
[1:26:50] see yourself
[1:26:51] so the ego looks inside and it's like oh
[1:26:54] there is a colleague inside there
[1:26:56] and there to be bleeding it looks he
[1:26:58] says oh it's like it's ready for fun
[1:27:01] let me drop you so we can have
[1:27:02] fellowship there is job sin only to
[1:27:04] realize that oh
[1:27:08] it's a different thing it was not what i
[1:27:11] thought
[1:27:13] that is how sin is
[1:27:17] you will see it attractive when you lock
[1:27:21] in
[1:27:21] then you realize oh that was not what i
[1:27:23] thought
[1:27:26] and when you keep your distance away
[1:27:29] you are free but so long as
[1:27:32] you keep close to it and you will not
[1:27:35] leave that vicinity
[1:27:37] you keep going around sin keep going
[1:27:40] around sin
[1:27:41] keeping company with sinners
[1:27:44] you are going to fall for it
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:50] it's just a matter of time
[1:27:53] it's just a matter of time
[1:27:57] something so is coming
[1:28:00] he could have invented it
[1:28:05] but he kept going around it going around
[1:28:08] it
[1:28:09] so finally his soul got so
[1:28:13] vexed and he gave out the secret
[1:28:16] and what did the men do they came and
[1:28:19] bound him
[1:28:21] did allah shave him very well
[1:28:26] and i think my head is even better
[1:28:30] praise the lord they made sure they
[1:28:33] saved him very well
[1:28:38] their strength was gone
[1:28:42] something's strength was not his hair
[1:28:49] his strength was not his hair
[1:28:54] he had a nazarite vow
[1:28:58] god said that no razor would touch his
[1:29:00] head
[1:29:03] so long as he was keeping the hair
[1:29:06] and there was no result going in he was
[1:29:08] obeying the lord's command
[1:29:11] and so long as he was obeying the word
[1:29:14] of god
[1:29:15] there was that there was that channel
[1:29:18] there was that channel there was that
[1:29:21] highway
[1:29:22] that super highway from the throne of
[1:29:24] god that god could step into that
[1:29:26] channel
[1:29:27] at any time to do exploits
[1:29:32] but when that razor touched his head he
[1:29:36] went against that commandment
[1:29:38] it was not just the hair i have seen a
[1:29:42] lot of men in the street with very long
[1:29:44] hair
[1:29:45] enough you can whip them they will not
[1:29:48] stand for a second
[1:29:59] god is the secret of our strength
[1:30:08] heaven and earth shall pass away
[1:30:13] but the word of god would never pass
[1:30:15] away
[1:30:17] if you have the word in you you can't
[1:30:20] pass away
[1:30:22] how do you pass away with the word of
[1:30:24] god in you it's impossible
[1:30:28] the secret of our strength
[1:30:31] is taking god at his word amen
[1:30:36] amen when something
[1:30:39] misbehaved and did the things he did
[1:30:43] and went against gave the secret out
[1:30:46] and they shaved him oh
[1:30:50] then he realized that no
[1:30:54] the game plan had changed and remember
[1:30:59] there is always a penalty for sin
[1:31:04] don't think that because you're a child
[1:31:06] of god you can do anything and get away
[1:31:08] with it no
[1:31:11] you can't get away with it
[1:31:16] as a matter of fact when we started
[1:31:18] reading judges 13 it says that
[1:31:20] the children of israel did sin again and
[1:31:23] god gave them to the philistines
[1:31:25] 40 years a child of god
[1:31:28] if you go against the word there is a
[1:31:31] penalty to pay
[1:31:35] don't think you can get away with it
[1:31:40] and something had a penalty to pay
[1:31:44] his eyes were scooped out they burned
[1:31:48] him in prison
[1:31:49] and he was there grinding
[1:31:54] oh it's a dangerous thing
[1:31:59] to live in darkness
[1:32:03] when you have the opportunity
[1:32:06] to live in the light it's a dangerous
[1:32:10] thing to choose to live in darkness
[1:32:15] for somebody that is already living in
[1:32:17] darkness do you know
[1:32:18] when you stay in darkness for too long
[1:32:21] it tends to get a little brighter for
[1:32:23] you
[1:32:24] but for you that is living in the light
[1:32:28] you fall in darkness is gross darkness
[1:32:31] it's not a place you want to be as a
[1:32:33] child of god
[1:32:36] something was reduced to nothing
[1:32:40] you can never quantify the grace of god
[1:32:43] upon the life
[1:32:44] of a man or a woman you can put a value
[1:32:48] to it
[1:32:51] when god takes his grace away from you
[1:32:55] you'll be more useless than the word
[1:32:57] useless
[1:32:58] you'll be more hopeless than the word
[1:33:00] hopeless
[1:33:04] when god takes his grace away from you
[1:33:06] you are finished
[1:33:12] something now in prison in chains
[1:33:17] grinding but the bible says that even in
[1:33:22] prison
[1:33:23] his head started to grow again
[1:33:28] now remember that at this point
[1:33:32] the philistines knew that his strength
[1:33:36] had something to do with his head
[1:33:40] and i believe they would have been very
[1:33:42] very reckless
[1:33:44] to let his health grow again
[1:33:47] i believe they heard men that were
[1:33:50] probably doing over time
[1:33:52] watching his head
[1:33:56] probably with your razors ready any hair
[1:34:00] that is coming they will just take it
[1:34:01] off
[1:34:02] because if they were not doing it then
[1:34:05] they were very reckless
[1:34:07] praise be to god but word where god has
[1:34:11] made a way
[1:34:12] praise be to god the devil is confounded
[1:34:19] the hair was growing
[1:34:23] but something himself knew that at this
[1:34:25] point
[1:34:26] he had no comfort of growing his long
[1:34:29] hair again
[1:34:30] he knew that because he knew
[1:34:35] that the philistines would not sit down
[1:34:39] and let that hair grow long again
[1:34:43] but then he could feel the hair growing
[1:34:48] praise be to god
[1:34:51] and the philistines went and looked for
[1:34:52] trouble
[1:34:55] they had their fists
[1:34:59] and they were going to celebrate their
[1:35:01] god
[1:35:03] because they said your god had given
[1:35:05] philistine
[1:35:06] substance to their hands that something
[1:35:09] had destroyed them so long
[1:35:12] killed your man and they were going to
[1:35:15] celebrate their god
[1:35:16] to thank their god for delivering
[1:35:18] something into their hands
[1:35:23] the purpose of god in a man's life can
[1:35:26] never be defeated
[1:35:28] whatever god has brought you into this
[1:35:31] life to do
[1:35:32] nothing will stop it something
[1:35:35] was brought for one purpose
[1:35:41] he was brought for one purpose to
[1:35:44] deliver the children of israel from the
[1:35:45] philistines
[1:35:47] to kill them to torture them that was
[1:35:50] the purpose of which he was brought
[1:35:52] now at this point while he is in the
[1:35:55] prison
[1:35:56] bound in chains it looked like oh
[1:36:00] it is a wasted dream it looked like oh
[1:36:04] that purpose has been defeated
[1:36:09] how maybe his people would have been
[1:36:10] complaining something
[1:36:13] you were brought to deliver us you were
[1:36:15] brought for this see where you are
[1:36:16] behind bars and where are you
[1:36:20] and every reasonable person would look
[1:36:23] at that situation
[1:36:25] and then paint one picture that oh
[1:36:28] it's a wasted dream but i say it again
[1:36:32] to the glory of god
[1:36:34] that the purpose of god for your life
[1:36:37] can never be defeated
[1:36:40] and where it looks like the purpose is
[1:36:42] being defeated you are getting closer it
[1:36:44] than you ever thought
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:47] here comes something that brought him
[1:36:51] out of prison
[1:36:54] to come and entertain the people
[1:36:59] and the bible says that all the laws of
[1:37:03] the philistines
[1:37:04] had gathered together
[1:37:10] substance name was a name of a terror
[1:37:15] that each time they had something
[1:37:20] looked for the door and they ran for
[1:37:22] their dear lives
[1:37:28] when the governors and the and the lords
[1:37:30] heard of something
[1:37:32] they locked their doors up nobody's
[1:37:35] going out because something is in town
[1:37:41] now but look at the picture
[1:37:45] here is something now
[1:37:49] his eyes blocked out his strength gone
[1:37:54] he has become an entertainer now so the
[1:37:57] people that would have been running away
[1:37:58] from him
[1:37:59] if they heard something now all of them
[1:38:01] are gathering together now
[1:38:03] to come and see him
[1:38:07] instead of running away now they are
[1:38:10] gathering together
[1:38:13] all the dignitaries the loss
[1:38:17] the politicians the judges
[1:38:20] the men and the women who they were
[1:38:23] running away
[1:38:25] they all came together just to come
[1:38:29] and make merry and have something to
[1:38:32] entertain them
[1:38:36] praise be to god they were gathered
[1:38:40] together
[1:38:41] 3 000 people men and women
[1:38:46] and in his lifetime
[1:38:50] he hadn't killed that much we can count
[1:38:53] the thousand he killed
[1:38:55] we can count the other teddy and a few
[1:38:58] year few day
[1:39:01] but all his life he never killed after
[1:39:05] three thousand
[1:39:07] because they will not stand and wait for
[1:39:10] him to come
[1:39:12] but now they are comfortable to come
[1:39:14] together
[1:39:16] because they knew that his strength was
[1:39:19] gone
[1:39:21] praise be to god amen when something
[1:39:24] stood there
[1:39:26] and they wanted some form of
[1:39:27] entertainment
[1:39:29] some say the little boy that was leading
[1:39:31] him can you please lead me to where
[1:39:35] this building is sitting those two
[1:39:36] pillars the pillars
[1:39:38] upon which this building is sitting and
[1:39:41] then he let him there
[1:39:43] samson put his hand on those pillars
[1:39:46] and something cried out to god
[1:39:49] remember me lord remember me lord
[1:39:55] it's not my brother it's not my sister
[1:39:57] that is in need of prayer
[1:39:58] it's me oh lord it's not my father it's
[1:40:01] not my mother
[1:40:02] it's me something who is in need of
[1:40:05] prayer
[1:40:06] remember me oh i know i have let you
[1:40:09] down
[1:40:11] i know i have not behaved
[1:40:15] but once more this was
[1:40:18] this once remember me
[1:40:23] and the people were looking what is this
[1:40:25] guy up to
[1:40:27] what is he doing what show has he got to
[1:40:29] give us
[1:40:31] and the hair had grown a little
[1:40:35] i don't think it was easy for something
[1:40:40] i don't think it was easy
[1:40:43] the battle we are fighting today those
[1:40:46] mind battles
[1:40:48] every child of god has fought it in
[1:40:51] their time
[1:40:54] i could see something saying you know
[1:40:56] what my hair is not grown yet my
[1:40:58] strength has not come
[1:40:59] what if i fail and something comes and
[1:41:02] say no
[1:41:02] something you know what the condition
[1:41:05] which you are
[1:41:06] you are already dead just do it anyhow
[1:41:09] he said no but the hair is not much how
[1:41:12] do i know if my strength would come
[1:41:14] how would i know if it would work but
[1:41:17] against all us
[1:41:18] he prayed praise be to god
[1:41:22] when we pray something happens
[1:41:26] god answers prayer god hears our prayer
[1:41:31] he prayed and when he
[1:41:34] shook the building the building came
[1:41:37] down
[1:41:39] and 3 000 people including samson
[1:41:42] himself
[1:41:44] perished and the bible says
[1:41:47] in his death he killed more
[1:41:51] than when he was alive
[1:41:55] in his death samson
[1:41:59] lived his most glorious time his death
[1:42:02] was the most glorious time of his life
[1:42:06] because he achieved the purpose of god
[1:42:08] in his life to the letter
[1:42:12] he achieved it to the letter
[1:42:17] that was why god brought him
[1:42:21] he was down but he was never out
[1:42:25] something was down but he was never out
[1:42:30] a child of god the word the devil can do
[1:42:34] to you
[1:42:36] is just to get you to fall but you
[1:42:39] falling down doesn't mean you are out
[1:42:43] i don't care how low you fall
[1:42:46] the grace of god is lower than your fall
[1:42:51] and by that time you will be followed to
[1:42:53] that level the grace of god is already
[1:42:55] there to pick you up
[1:42:59] praise be to god a child of god
[1:43:03] i don't care what situation you find
[1:43:04] yourself in i don't care how messed up
[1:43:07] you are
[1:43:08] i don't care how many times you're
[1:43:09] falling whether your legs are up or
[1:43:11] you're down
[1:43:12] yo i don't give a damn about that if you
[1:43:15] can get to that place
[1:43:18] to reckon that you are child of god
[1:43:22] and that there is a higher purpose to
[1:43:23] which you are called
[1:43:25] and you can stand and confess your sins
[1:43:29] repent of your sins and ask
[1:43:33] the grace of god to take over the grace
[1:43:35] of god is going to take over
[1:43:42] this reminds me of that pilot whose son
[1:43:45] went
[1:43:46] into the into the mountains to go and
[1:43:47] hike and then he was in the house
[1:43:50] and i said you know what let me just fly
[1:43:52] the plane go to the mountains
[1:43:54] maybe i'll see my son and then he flew
[1:43:56] into the mountains
[1:43:58] and then he saw his son just fell from
[1:44:01] the mountain
[1:44:02] and was just coming down to hit the
[1:44:05] rocks
[1:44:06] and the father just came down just
[1:44:09] shouted at the sun hold the wing hold
[1:44:12] the wing
[1:44:13] the sun held the wing and his father
[1:44:15] just drove him up
[1:44:16] to safety
[1:44:19] you may have fallen off and all you are
[1:44:23] looking at is the ditch
[1:44:26] but the grace of god is there to sustain
[1:44:28] you
[1:44:30] the fact that you are down doesn't mean
[1:44:32] you are out
[1:44:35] god is not looking at your situation now
[1:44:38] god is looking at your situation across
[1:44:40] the line
[1:44:42] once you are born a child of god you are
[1:44:45] going to die a child of god
[1:44:47] he was a nazarite from the womb and he
[1:44:50] died
[1:44:50] another right even though he was shaving
[1:44:54] shaving he still died another right
[1:45:02] you can fall 10 23 times
[1:45:06] don't turn the grace of god into
[1:45:08] disgrace
[1:45:11] if you have found favor in the sight of
[1:45:13] god and god has rescued you
[1:45:16] you have no reason you have no cause
[1:45:19] to go back into sin anymore
[1:45:22] stay your grounds repent of your sins
[1:45:27] ask god for forgiveness and god will
[1:45:30] restore you where you belong
[1:45:34] once a child of god always a child of
[1:45:37] god
[1:45:38] children of god are born the
[1:45:41] circumstances
[1:45:42] we got through in this life do not
[1:45:45] change us
[1:45:47] they don't define who we are your true
[1:45:50] identity
[1:45:51] is in the man before the foundation of
[1:45:53] this world
[1:45:54] that is why your true identity is
[1:45:58] the circumstances of this life do not
[1:46:01] define you
[1:46:08] we were children of god before the
[1:46:11] foundation stone was laid
[1:46:14] we are children of god it doesn't matter
[1:46:17] what we go through
[1:46:20] we are children of god when we come to
[1:46:23] the end of the road
[1:46:24] and we have to live
[1:46:28] nothing can hold us back
[1:46:31] there are a lot of choices wrong choices
[1:46:33] we've made
[1:46:35] there are things we have done which we
[1:46:36] shouldn't do
[1:46:38] but those things do not define you
[1:46:43] remember that you are son of god
[1:46:46] remember that you are a daughter of god
[1:46:50] god is looking at you across the
[1:46:52] finishing line
[1:46:56] make things right
[1:47:00] praise be to god
[1:47:03] down but not out we can talk about david
[1:47:09] we can talk about king soul
[1:47:13] we can talk about adam and eve
[1:47:16] when they fall came in the garden
[1:47:20] they were down but they were not out
[1:47:26] for their sake god cares the earth
[1:47:31] but they were not out of the will of god
[1:47:37] we can talk about a whole lot of
[1:47:38] characters in the bible
[1:47:41] i just want to spare you that
[1:47:46] so it's one thing to be down and it's
[1:47:50] another thing
[1:47:52] to be out to be down is not synonymous
[1:47:57] to being out all you have to reckon
[1:48:01] is that where you fall it's not your
[1:48:03] destination
[1:48:07] why you fall it's not your destination
[1:48:11] rise up and keep moving
[1:48:16] praise be to god
[1:48:19] can the musicians come over
[1:48:29] and as you pray
[1:48:34] everyone can come over
[1:48:48] our lord
[1:48:51] and our savior jesus
[1:48:57] we thank this so much
[1:49:02] that we can gather together
[1:49:05] on a sunday morning like this father oh
[1:49:07] god to encourage ourselves
[1:49:13] we know that the days
[1:49:18] are getting closer
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:23] there is coming a time one will not be
[1:49:27] here
[1:49:28] anymore
[1:49:31] for this is not our home
[1:49:34] you have prepared for us a place
[1:49:38] that where you are there we shall be
[1:49:40] also
[1:49:43] we reckon that we are in a journey
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:48] and in this journey that a whole lot of
[1:49:51] things
[1:49:52] are going to happen but the things that
[1:49:56] are going to happen
[1:49:58] do not define who we are for our true
[1:50:01] identity
[1:50:06] is in the man before the foundation of
[1:50:08] this world
[1:50:11] we thank you for your amazing grace
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:16] that we that were once blind can now see
[1:50:21] that even though we're wretched and
[1:50:23] filthy you have cleansed us
[1:50:25] by your shed blood
[1:50:30] that even though we had no hope lord
[1:50:33] you have given us hope and joy
[1:50:39] that there are not enough adjectives in
[1:50:41] any language to express our joy
[1:50:45] that in all the songs that we think
[1:50:48] there are not enough notes to express
[1:50:53] our joy that there isn't enough breath
[1:50:57] in our lungs
[1:50:59] to pour out our gratitude lord
[1:51:07] like just to say thank you lord
[1:51:10] thank you lord jesus thank you lord
